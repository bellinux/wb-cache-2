5|$|Experts {{estimate}} {{that with the}} accession of Armenia, the internationally unrecognised Nagorno-Karabakh Republic would not {{be integrated into the}} Eurasian Union. Armenia <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>permanent</b> political, military and economic ally of Russia, whereas Azerbaijan holds close ties with the west. The Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev expressed concern in 2013 that no reliable customs border between Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh could be drawn. However, Nazarbayev expressed that he holds all the existing disagreements preventing Armenia's integration into Eurasian Economic Union are surmountable. The Chairman of the Foreign Policy Committee in the Armenian Parliament, Artak Zakarian, announced on 14 May 2014 that Armenia will build no customs border including the region of Nagorno-Karabakh.|$|E

5|$|Much {{floating}} plastic trash {{does not}} biodegrade, instead disintegrating {{over time and}} eventually breaking down to the molecular level. Rigid plastics may float for years. In {{the center of the}} Pacific gyre, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>permanent</b> floating accumulation of mostly plastic waste and there is a similar garbage patch in the Atlantic. Foraging sea birds such as the albatross and petrel may mistake debris for food and accumulate indigestible plastic in their digestive systems. Turtles and whales have been found with plastic bags and fishing line in their stomachs. Microplastics may sink, threatening filter feeders on the seabed.|$|E
5|$|Ny-Ålesund <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>permanent</b> {{settlement}} based entirely around research. Formerly {{a mining}} town, {{it is still}} a company town operated by the Norwegian state-owned Kings Bay. While there is some tourism there, Norwegian authorities limit access to the outpost to minimize impact on the scientific work. Ny-Ålesund has a winter population of 35 and a summer population of 180. The Norwegian Meteorological Institute has outposts at Bjørnøya and Hopen, with respectively ten and four people stationed. Both outposts can also house temporary research staff. Poland operates the Polish Polar Station at Hornsund, with ten permanent residents.|$|E
5|$|On November 12, 2013, the Height Committee of the Chicago-based Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH) {{made the}} {{controversial}} announcement that One World Trade Center was the tallest {{building in the}} United States at 1,776 feet, declaring that the mast {{on top of the}} building is a spire since it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>permanent</b> part of the building's architecture. By the same reasoning, the building was also the tallest in the Western Hemisphere.|$|E

5|$|The United States has an {{established}} structure of foreign relations. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>permanent</b> {{member of the}} United Nations Security Council, and New York City {{is home to the}} United Nations Headquarters. It {{is a member of the}} G7, G20, and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Almost all countries have embassies in Washington, D.C., and many have consulates around the country. Likewise, nearly all nations host American diplomatic missions. However, Iran, North Korea, Bhutan, and the Republic of China (Taiwan) do not have formal diplomatic relations with the United States (although the U.S. still maintains relations with Taiwan and supplies it with military equipment).|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to combat, {{there is also}} a mild role-playing component. An experience point system levels up the player character and their equipment (weapons, armor, shields, helms, and magic rings). Equipment pieces have special properties and a predetermined amount of experience points required to master them. Mastering a piece of equipment increases its sale value but decreases the player's experience gain by 20%. Upon leveling up or mastering a piece of equipment, players gain attribute points that can be allotted towards four character attributes: health, attack, shield power, or magic. Each point can only be allocated once and <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>permanent</b> upgrade to the character. Players can purchase new equipment using in-game money from sacks and treasure chests found throughout the castle, defeated enemies, and sales of unused equipment. In-game money can be purchased with real money within the game.|$|E

5|$|Legislative: The {{legislature}} of India is the bicameral parliament. It operates under a Westminster-style {{parliamentary system}} and comprises the upper house called the Rajya Sabha ("Council of States") {{and the lower}} called the Lok Sabha ("House of the People"). The Rajya Sabha <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>permanent</b> body that has 245 members who serve in staggered six-year terms. Most are elected indirectly {{by the state and}} territorial legislatures in numbers proportional to their state's share of the national population. All but two of the Lok Sabha's 545 members are directly elected by popular vote; they represent individual constituencies via five-year terms. The remaining two members are nominated by the president from among the Anglo-Indian community, in case the president decides that they are not adequately represented.|$|E
5|$|The {{chairman}} {{is elected}} by the deputies (members) of the National Assembly in the first season of the assembly's tenure. The Standing Committee, of which the chairman is a member, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>permanent</b> body which controls {{the activities of the}} National Assembly when it is not in session. The chairman and {{the other members of the}} Standing Committee have to resign from their posts when the National Assembly dissolves itself, which it normally does every fifth year. The chairman presides over the sessions of the National Assembly and authenticates laws and resolutions passed by the National Assembly by signing them. The chairman leads the activities of the Standing Committee and organises its external relations with other state bodies and is responsible for maintaining cordial relations between the members of the Standing Committee. The deputies of the National Assembly have the right to question the chairman.|$|E
5|$|The {{range of}} the American crow now extends from the Pacific Ocean to the Atlantic Ocean in Canada, on the French islands of Saint-Pierre and Miquelon, south through the United States, and into {{northern}} Mexico. The increase in trees throughout the Great Plains during the past century due to fire suppression and tree planting facilitated range expansions of the American crow as well as range expansions of many other species of birds. Virtually all types of country from wilderness, farmland, parks, open woodland to towns and major cities are inhabited; it is absent only from Pacific temperate rain forests and tundra habitat where it is replaced by the raven. This crow <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>permanent</b> resident {{in most of the}} USA, but most Canadian birds migrate some distances southward in winter. Outside of the nesting season these birds often gather in large (thousands or even millions) communal roosts at night.|$|E

5|$|The {{state is}} governed by a {{parliamentary}} system of representative democracy. Uttar Pradesh {{is one of the}} seven states in India, where the state legislature is bicameral, comprising two houses: the Vidhan Sabha (Legislative Assembly) and the Vidhan Parishad (Legislative Council). The Legislative Assembly consists of 404 members who are elected for five-year terms. The Legislative Council <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>permanent</b> body of 100 members with one-third (33 members) retiring every two years. Since Uttar Pradesh sends the largest number of legislators to the national Parliament, it is often considered {{to be one of the}} most important states with respect to Indian politics. The state contributes 80 seats to the lower house of the Indian Parliament, Lok Sabha and 31 seats to the upper house of the Indian Parliament, Rajya Sabha.|$|E
5|$|There are {{six major}} concert halls in Baltimore.

Johns Hopkins University's Shriver Hall and the Peabody's Miriam A. Friedberg are also important concert venues, the latter being the oldest still in use.|$|E
5|$|Virginia voters {{approved}} a government-run lottery in 1987. Before the vote, supporters of a lottery suggested {{a number of}} possible ways in which lottery profits could be designated in Virginia, such as education, transportation and Chesapeake Bay cleanup. However, the referendum made no designation of how lottery profits would be spent. Sales began September 20, 1988. In 1989, the General Assembly directed Lottery proceeds to capital construction projects. From 1990 to 1998, the proceeds went to Virginia's General Fund. Starting in 1999, a provision in Virginia's budget called for all proceeds to be assigned exclusively to education. In November 2000, Virginia {{voters approved}} the creation of the State Lottery Proceeds Fund by an 83.5-point margin. The measure, which <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>permanent</b> part of Virginia's Constitution, directs the General Assembly to use all Lottery profits for educational purposes. The Lottery does not control how its profits are spent.|$|E

5|$|The adult {{stage is}} usually short, its {{function}} only to mate and lay eggs. The genitalia of female flies are rotated to a varying {{degree from the}} position found in other insects. In some flies, this is a temporary rotation during mating, but in others, it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>permanent</b> torsion of the organs that occurs during the pupal stage. This torsion {{may lead to the}} anus being below the genitals, or, in the case of 360° torsion, to the sperm duct being wrapped around the gut and the external organs being in their usual position. When flies mate, the male initially flies on top of the female, facing in the same direction, but then turns around to face in the opposite direction. This forces the male to lie on his back for his genitalia to remain engaged with those of the female, or the torsion of the male genitals allows the male to mate while remaining upright. This leads to flies having more reproduction abilities than most insects, and much quicker. Flies occur in large populations due to their ability to mate effectively and quickly during the mating season.|$|E
