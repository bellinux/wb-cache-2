[...] University of Washington, 2014 Judicial {{efficiency}} {{achieved by}} filtering cases {{that do not}} deserve trial and litigants' right to access to justice are competing values of most of civil justice systems. How these two values are interacting and how these are balancing influence actors of the system, decide effectiveness of legal institutions, and lead future civil procedure reforms. Through analysis of Korean civil litigation proceedings, existing studies, observations of court hearings, and interviews with Korean judges and lawyers, this dissertation investigates how <b>disposition</b> <b>without</b> <b>trial</b> and related procedural safeguards of Korean civil procedure are actually working and how interactions between efficiency and procedural fairness influence actual use of procedural mechanisms. Based on that, this dissertation evaluates comparative law projects that recommend adoption of <b>disposition</b> <b>without</b> <b>trial</b> of the U. S. civil procedure suggested by Korean legal scholars. This dissertation argues that fundamental procedural values in action that are unique in certain society and at certain time period decide actual use of procedural devices and effectiveness of legal reforms. It also contends that, in Korean context, maximum level of access to adjudication on the merits and truth finding function of civil litigation are driving judges' and lawyers' civil litigation practices toward minimal use of <b>disposition</b> <b>without</b> <b>trial</b> that limits litigants' access to court and maximum use of procedural safeguards, thus establishing a one-sided model biased with access to justice in terms of balancing model. By applying this explanatory theory to comparative civil procedure projects in Korea, this dissertation evaluates these projects in light of considering fundamental procedural values in action; and illustrates the ways of designing comparative civil procedure projects that appropriately reflects contexts of adopting society and raises effectiveness of the legal reforms...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{research}} {{has led to}} a growing awareness that the dominant method of settling criminal cases in the United States involves <b>disposition</b> <b>without</b> <b>trial.</b> The overwhelming majority of criminal cases are settled by guilty pleas, and the majority of guilty plea dispositions involve some kind of bargain on the charge or sentence. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to examine and analyze the phenomenon of negotiating the guilty plea in terms of its relationship to the functional needs and ideal goals of the court system. A basic assumption of this study was that case disposition through a bargaining process provides for both functional needs and ideal goals which are not clearly provided for in the trial system. A detailed examination of felony case <b>disposition</b> <b>without</b> <b>trial</b> in one Pacific Northwest urban court system was undertaken to ascertain the precise nature of the bargaining process. Records regarding the nature and outcomes of felony dispositions in 1976 and 1977 were researched, along with information on the formal structure, procedures and pOlicies of the court organization. Interviews with prosecutors, public defenders and judges in the felony court system provided attitudinal data. Observations of guilty plea hearings and negotiation conferences allowed the researcher to record actual activities in the disposition process. The data indicated that the majority of cases were settled by guilty pleas and that the majority of guilty pleas involved some kind of bargain. Plea negotiation in this court system was routinized, formalized and highly structured. The bargaining process was prosecutor-dominated, in part due to the District Attorney Office policy which was noticeably inflexible in terms of bargaining criteria. The one commodity of power held by the defense attorney was strength of case. If the defense could find legal 2 ̆ 2 loopholes 2 ̆ 2 in the state 2 ̆ 7 s case, the chances of the defendant getting a good deal improved. This emphasis on legal factors appeared to strengthen the professional orientation as well as the adversary perspective of the opposing attorneys. Pleading guilty to a reduced charge resulted in the greatest likelihood of a defendant receiving a non-incarceration sentence. The majority of reductions were to offenses necessarily included in the initial charge. Conviction by trial resulted in the highest, proportion of incarceration sentences of all closing types. However, there was evidence that circumstances of the case and the defendant were influential regarding the likelihood of incarceration at the sentencing stage. A balancing factor aFpeared to be at work according to comparisons of the 1976 and 1977 data. Changes in the District Attorney Office policy instituted in 1977 expanded the list of non-reducible offenses. While the proportion of trial closings consequently increased for these non-reducible offenses, this increase was offset by a decrease in the proportion of trials for offenses not included in the non-reducible category. Generally, the findings supported the theoretical assumption that disposition by guilty plea negotiation could fulfill functional needs of the court system within a legalistic framework...|$|E
40|$|While {{we know a}} {{great deal}} about the {{disposition}} of felony arrests that reach the trial stage, we know little about the details of the <b>dispositions</b> reached <b>without</b> <b>trial.</b> And yet, this latter category forms as a rule over 90 percent, in New York City 98 percent, of all dispositions. Basing his analysis on a study done in the early 1970 s, the author describes and presents data on the various stages in the process from arrest to final disposition through plea bargaining, trial, or dismissal of the case. For the first time, this usually opaque disposition pattern prior to trial emerges in the clarity of 23 graphs that illustrate the analysis. Of particular interest are some new insights into the mechanism of the plea bargaining process...|$|R
40|$|The {{system of}} public justice is in trouble, perhaps deeper trouble {{than that in}} which the system of justice perennially finds itself. It is beset by such delay that civil cases on the general docket in many jurisdictions take {{more than five years}} to get to trial. 2 ̆ 2 Big 2 ̆ 2 civil cases involve a {{discovery}} and pretrial apparatus that makes the legal process in Bleak House pale in comparison and a trial stage in which, some observers believe, the issues are untriable, at least by a jury. Civil cases generally involve seemingly excessive transaction costs, both for the parties and for the public. Criminal cases are brought to trial more rapidly under the imperative of the speedy trial requirement. However, this adherence to a nominally efficient schedule on the criminal side is achieved at a high price, often revealed in the prosecutor 2 ̆ 7 s erratic selection of cases for prosecution. Symptoms of trouble on the criminal side include a large number of <b>dispositions</b> <b>without</b> <b>trial</b> and pervasive plea bargaining. Big criminal cases become so complex that they, too, max be untriable by ordlinary procedure, while ordinary criminal cases are placed on a procedural treadmill that trivializes the ideals of criminal procedure and the -social purpose of penal sanctions Many domains of administrative agency adjudication suffer similar ills. The obvious symptoms are, again, delay and high transaction costs; the less obvious indications are erratic patterns of disposition and the dominance of process over substantive coherence...|$|R

40|$|In {{the wake}} of the US {{detention}} policy {{in the aftermath of the}} 9 / 11 attacks, the practice of detention <b>without</b> <b>trial</b> has gained a degree of attention unparalleled in the history of common law tradition. Legal analyses of all kinds have ensued, and countless policy plans and guidelines have been created. Yet, despite the pedigree of detention <b>without</b> <b>trial,</b> the historical dimension to the practice of detention <b>without</b> <b>trial</b> has not been invested with the scrutiny that it deserves. Drawing on the history of detention <b>without</b> <b>trial</b> in Britain, this research seeks to draw a roadmap for the evolving features of detention <b>without</b> <b>trial.</b> It will be argued that it is by virtue of this historical understanding that we can make sense of the modern laws governing the practice of detention <b>without</b> <b>trial</b> and its associated features...|$|R
