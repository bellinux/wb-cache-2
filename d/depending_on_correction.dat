These galaxies exhibit {{a relationship between}} the linestrength of Mgb (λ 0 ≈ 5170 ˚A) and their internal velocity dispersion σ similar to local dynamically hot galaxies. But for any given σ, the Mgb linestrength of the distant ellipticals is significantly lower than the mean value of the nearby sample. The difference of Mgb between the two samples is small (〈∆Mgb 〉 ≈ − 0. 4 ˚A) and can be fully attributed to the younger age of the distant stellar populations in accordance with the passive evolution model for elliptical galaxies.

Methods: This prospective randomized study included 54 patients who underwent repair of coarctation of the aorta. All patients were divided in 2 groups <b>depending</b> <b>on</b> the <b>correction</b> type: reconstruction using the modified reverse left subclavian artery flap plasty (Group I, 27 pts) or extended end-to-end anastomosis (Group II, 27 pts). Results: A postoperative follow-up period was 26 (21; 31) months. Recoarctation of the aorta during long-term follow-up was found in 1 patient (3. 84 %) in Group I and in 2 patients (7. 7 %) in Group II (p= 0. 5). Two patients in the Group I (7. 7 %) and 8 patients in the Group II (30. 8 %) had arterial hypertension (p= 0. 03). Conclusion: With modern types of surgical correction used, the anastomotic area tended to proportionally grow in different segments of the aortic arch and did not influence the postoperative complications rate. Endocardial fibroelastosis and ascending aortic wall rigidity could be considered as predictors of arterial hypertension in the late period after coarctation repair in infants. Low body weight before surgery is a factor of aortic recoarctation development in the late postoperative period. Arterial hypertension persistence <b>depends</b> <b>on</b> the <b>correction</b> type.
