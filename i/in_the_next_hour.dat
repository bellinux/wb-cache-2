25|$|The third match {{followed}} {{a very similar}} pattern to the second, with the West Indians making a good start through Roach (53) and Challenor (46), but no other batsman getting beyond the 30s. The total of 238 was, though, the highest of the series for the touring side. Hobbs and Sutcliffe made 155 for the first wicket, and Hobbs and Tyldesley then added 129 before Hobbs was out for 159 with the score at 284. Five further wickets then fell <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>hour</b> for 49 runs, {{all of them to}} Griffith, whose innings figures of six for 103 were the best of the series for the West Indies. Tate and Harold Larwood then added 61 in 25 minutes and the last three wickets made 105 runs. West Indies' second innings, as in the previous Tests, began badly, and only a stubborn 41 from Martin enabled the side to reach three figures. As at Lord's and Old Trafford, the match was over before lunch on the third day.|$|E

The storm moved north, making a second landfall near Navojoa. The storm continued inland, passing directly over Ciudad Obregón. The storm dissipated south-southeast of Sierra Vista in Arizona.|$|E

After Wellington had made 397 {{in their first}} innings, Auckland lost wickets steadily and were 112 for 7 at one stage. Hay [...] "took over two hours to make his first 50, [...] <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>hour</b> and a-half rattled on nearly double that number ... just when Auckland's plight seemed hopeless, he let out in most brilliant style and found the boundary time after time with powerful drives and leg strokes ... his 144 was a remarkable display of defence combined with hitting". Having gone in first, he was last out with Auckland's total at 262.|$|E

60|$|When the two men, {{crossing}} the river, climbed the zigzag trail up the slide, {{they found a}} closed cabin. Bill Saltman, who led the way, went softly to the door, listened, then beckoned Wild Water Charley up to him. From inside came the creak and whine of a windlass bearing a heavy load.

Then Wild Water knocked on the door.

60|$|Kit {{felt the}} señora had not used {{conventionally}} the polite good-bye; anyhow {{he had not}} given her an empty promise. He {{was going to find}} her husband, and Wolf was going to help. If it were necessary, Kit meant to force him, for he had noted that Cayman was in the harbour ready for sea. Wolf must charter her <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>hour</b> or two, and she must sail before the Commandante knew about the fight on the beach. Responsibility had developed Kit and brought into action qualities he had not altogether known were his. He could front a crisis and saw he must front one now. Cayman was in port, and with the fresh Trade-breeze abeam, would soon reach the wady. A few resolute men might find and make some bargain with the Moors, but if a gunboat landed a strong party the tribe would vanish in the desert.|$|E

Heroes of old were glad to die, if but some 'vates sacer' would sing their fame in worthy strains: and shalt not thou too be glad, Reinecke? Content thyself with thy fate.

50|$|Late in September, a {{vigorous}} tropical wave moved off {{the west coast}} of Mexico. By October 1, the National Hurricane Center issued a high probability (over 50% chance of development <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> 48 <b>hours)</b> for development into a tropical cyclone, but as the wave stalled offshore, it began losing vigor, with the NHC reducing the likelihood to medium (20-50% chance for development <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> 48 <b>hours)</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> day. As of 2100 UTC October 3, the likelihood of development within <b>the</b> <b>next</b> 48 <b>hours</b> was high again.

60|$|Thorne {{recognized}} {{that this would}} be judicious, particularly as he expected that a neighbor who had spoken to him that morning would pass close by <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>hour</b> or two. The man, who lived near Jordan, would, he felt confident, undertake to hand on the letter. A few minutes later he got down and entered his dwelling while Hunter drove on toward the grain. He found, however, that his ink had almost dried up, and when he sat down to write it was difficult to fix his thoughts on what he had to say. The relief he had experienced a little while ago had been great enough partly to bewilder him, and some time had passed before he produced a fairly intelligible letter. Putting it into his pocket, he went out again, and stopped a moment or two just outside the threshold with a sense of exultation that sent an almost painful thrill through him as he saw that Hunter had already got to work.|$|E
60|$|What {{he told me}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>hour</b> I cannot {{bring my}} mind to set on paper. I saw what I saw, I heard what I heard, and my soul sickened at it; and yet now when that sight has faded from my eyes, I ask myself if I believe it, and I cannot answer. My life is shaken to its roots; sleep has left me; the deadliest terror sits by me {{at all hours of}} the day and night; I feel that my days are numbered, and that I must die; and yet I shall die incredulous. As for the moral turpitude that man {{unveiled}} to me, even with tears of penitence, I cannot, even in memory, dwell on it without a start of horror. I will say but one thing, Utterson, and that (if you can bring your mind to credit it) will be more than enough. The creature who crept into my house that night was, on Jekyll's own confession, known by the name of Hyde, and hunted for in every corner of the land as the murderer of Carew.|$|E
60|$|In the meantime, Nauri, {{torn from}} her family by the hurricane, had been swept away on an {{adventure}} of her own. Clinging to a rough plank that wounded and bruised her and that filled her body with splinters, she was thrown clear over the atoll and carried away to sea. Here, under the amazing buffets of mountains of water, she lost her plank. She was an old woman nearly sixty; but she was Paumotan-born, and {{she had never been}} {{out of sight of the}} sea in her life. Swimming in the darkness, strangling, suffocating, fighting for air, she was struck a heavy blow on the shoulder by a cocoanut. On the instant her plan was formed, and she seized the nut. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>hour</b> she captured seven more. Tied together, they formed a life-buoy that preserved her life while at the same time it threatened to pound her to a jelly. She was a fat woman, and she bruised easily; but she had had experience of hurricanes, and while she prayed to her shark god for protection from sharks, she waited for the wind to break. But at three o'clock she was in such a stupor that she did not know. Nor did she know at six o'clock when the dead calm settled down. She was shocked into consciousness when she was thrown upon the sand. She dug in with raw and bleeding hands and feet and clawed against the backwash until she was beyond the reach of the waves.|$|E
