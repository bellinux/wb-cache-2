Pursuing her de-demonization policy, in October 2011, Marine Le Pen, as new president of the National Front, joined the <b>European</b> <b>Alliance</b> for Freedom (EAF).

After the 2014 European elections, the party joined the National Front, the Northern League, Vlaams Belang and the Czech Civic Conservative Party in forming the Movement for a Europe of Nations and Freedom, and participated along with these parties, the Dutch Party for Freedom, the Alternative for Germany, the Polish Congress of the New Right and a former member of the UK Independence Party in the Europe of Nations and Freedom parliamentary group.|$|E

25|$|The Alliance of European National Movements (AENM) is a European {{political}} party that {{was formed in}} Budapest on 24 October 2009 {{by a number of}} ultranationalist and far-right parties from countries in Europe. The alliance's founding members were Jobbik (the Alliance was established during their sixth party congress), France's National Front, Italy's Tricolour Flame, Sweden's National Democrats, and Belgium's National Front. At the end of 2011, Marine Le Pen, the new French National Front leader, resigned from the AENM and joined the EAF (<b>European</b> <b>Alliance</b> for Freedom). In 2016 Jobbik also left the AENM.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, {{it finally}} discredited Soviet moves {{to prevent the}} {{formation}} of a West German state and accelerated the construction of a West <b>European</b> <b>alliance,</b> the Treaty of Brussels, the following month; mutual security was the new watchword. Until early 1948, Western and Soviet representatives had communicated in regular meetings at the foreign minister level; the Czech coup constituted a final rupture in relations between the two superpowers, with the West now signaling its determination to commit itself to collective self-defence. By early March, even a previously wavering France was demanding a concrete military alliance with definite promises to help in certain circumstances.|$|E
25|$|The advance into Europe {{continued}} with Mongol invasions of Poland and Hungary. When the western {{flank of the}} Mongols plundered Polish cities, a <b>European</b> <b>alliance</b> among the Poles, the Moravians, and the Christian military orders of the Hospitallers, Teutonic Knights and the Templars assembled sufficient forces to halt, although briefly, the Mongol advance at Legnica. The Hungarian army, their Croatian allies and the Templar Knights were beaten by Mongols at the banks of Sajo River on April 11, 1241. After their victories over European knights at Legnica and Muhi, Mongol armies quickly advanced across Bohemia, Serbia, Babenberg Austria {{and then into the}} Holy Roman Empire.|$|E

500|$|Æthelstan's most {{important}} <b>European</b> <b>alliance</b> {{was with the}} new Liudolfing dynasty in East Francia. The Carolingian dynasty of East Francia had died out in the early tenth century, and its new Liudolfing king, Henry the Fowler, was {{seen by many as}} an arriviste. He needed a royal marriage for his son to establish his legitimacy, but no suitable Carolingian princesses were available. The ancient royal line of the West Saxons provided an acceptable alternative, especially as they (wrongly) claimed descent from the seventh-century king and saint, Oswald, who was venerated in Germany. In 929 or 930 Henry sent ambassadors to Æthelstan's court seeking a wife for his son, Otto, who later became Holy Roman Emperor. [...] Æthelstan sent two of his half-sisters, and Otto chose Eadgyth. Fifty years later, Æthelweard, a descendant of Alfred the Great's older brother, addressed his Latin version of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle to Mathilde, Abbess of Essen, who was Eadgyth's granddaughter, and had apparently requested it. The other sister, whose name is uncertain, was married to a prince from near the Alps who has not definitely been identified.|$|E

2500|$|In {{his role}} of Foreign Secretary he was {{instrumental}} in negotiating what {{has become known as}} the quadruple alliance between Britain, Austria, Russia, and Prussia at Chaumont in March 1814, in the negotiation of the Treaty of Paris that brought peace with France, and at the Congress of Vienna. [...] The Treaty of Chaumont was part of the final deal offered to Napoleon Bonaparte in 1814. Napoleon rejected it and it never took effect. However, the key terms reaffirmed decisions that had been made already. These decisions were again ratified and put into effect by the Congress of Vienna of 1814–1815. The terms were largely written by Lord Castlereagh, who offered cash subsidies to keep the other armies in the field against Napoleon. Key terms included the establishment of a confederated Germany, the division into independent states, the restoration of the Bourbon kings of Spain, and the enlargement of the Netherlands to include what in 1830 became modern Belgium. The treaty of Chaumont became the cornerstone of the <b>European</b> <b>Alliance</b> which formed the balance of power for decades.|$|E
