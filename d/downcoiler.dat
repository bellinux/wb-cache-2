The design solution incorporates a novel pneumatic/hydraulic hybrid cylinder, used to hold the <b>downcoiler</b> wrappers in position to guide the steel strip whilst coiling. A full size testing rig was constructed to fully test the new prototype cylinder. The data collected from these testing trials was used to improve and validate a computer simulation model of the new equipment, which was coded in MatLab Simulink. The paper provides a comparison analysis of experimental testing results and computer simulation modelling results for the behaviour of the prototype cylinder...|$|E
