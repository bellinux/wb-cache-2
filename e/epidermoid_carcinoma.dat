MATERIALS AND METHODS: We {{carried out a}} retrospective study of 28 cases of mouth and tongue <b>epidermoid</b> <b>carcinomas.</b> They were submitted to immunohistochemical study in order to check the expression of p 53 and Ki- 67 antibodies and statistically compare {{them in terms of}} lymph node status, gender, histological grade, tumor volume and pathological staging. RESULTS: The individually analyzed p 53 proved to have statistical significance (p< 0. 05) when compared to tumor volume (p= 0. 029). Despite a strong tendency, the p 53 /tumor volume relation was not significant. When p 53 + Ki 67 were analyzed, tumor volume had p < 0. 05 (p = 0. 029).

However these stage III or IV <b>epidermoid</b> <b>carcinomas</b> carry a heavy proportion of "high" recurrences, i. e. situated in the parapharyngeal, oropharyngeal and rhinopharyngeal regions. The reasons for this are: the lymphatic continuity between the oro- and hypopharynx and the parapharyngeal regions and the base of the skull; the limitation of neck dissections higher up {{at the tip of the}} mastoid and the lower parotid border; the limitation of postoperative irradiation directed upwards. Therefore for these lesions we propose an extended therapeutic programme comprising pre-operative chemotherapy based on cisplatinum, bleomycin and methotrexate, an adequately wide surgical resection followed by reconstruction and an irradiation extending upwards by two lateral fields to the oropharynx, the rhinopharynx and the parapharynx...|$|R

50|$|Beta-glucans immunomodulate by {{stimulating}} dectin-1 {{to trigger}} monocytes, macrophages and neutrophils. In 2002, Wei et al. demonstrated that glucans directly stimulate human fibroblasts. Low molecular weight oat beta glucan increased macrophage proliferation and cytotoxicity to cancer cells while leaving healthy tissue intact. This effect also increased significantly with continued application over time. The beta-glucan further significantly reduced human melanoma and human <b>epidermoid</b> <b>carcinoma,</b> without toxic effects to human tissue, keratinocytes, or macrophages. Through immunostimulation {{they can also}} serve a preventative role against tumours. But beta-glucan's immunomodulatory properties are heavily dependent {{on the degree of}} branching and molecular size. For instance, cancer-fighting properties have been demonstrated in fungi and yeast beta-glucans, and more recently in low molecular weight oat beta-glucans, but high molecular weight oat beta-glucans are hindered by their high viscosity.|$|E

50|$|Studies in {{prostate}} cancer find that human {{prostate cancer}} cell lines in culture overexpress ALOX12, overproduce 12(S)-HETE, {{and respond to}} 12(S)-HETE by increasing their rate of proliferation, increasing their cell surface expression of integrins, increasing their survival and delaying their apoptosis, and increasing their production of vascular endothelial growth factor and MMP9 (i.e. Matrix metallopeptidase 9); selective (but not entirely) specific ALOX12 inhibitors reduced the proliferation and survival of these cells (see also 12-HETE#prostate cancer). These finding suggest that ALOX12 and its 12(S)-HETE product {{may contribute to the}} growth and spread of prostate cancer in humans. Recently, hypermethylation of the ALOX12 gene in prostate cancer tissue was associated with clinical predictors for a high rate of recurrent disease. Some studies have found that 12(S)-HETE also promotes the growth and/or related pro-malignant behaviors of various other types of cultured cancer cell lines (see 12-HETE#Other cancers). ALOX12 has been shown to interact with Keratin 5 and LMNA as screened in a yeast two-hybrid interaction library from human <b>epidermoid</b> <b>carcinoma</b> A431 cells; these proteins are candidates for regulating 12-LOX, particularly in tumor cells.|$|E

This is supported by findings that BLT2 is abnormally expressed in many human cancers that concurrently overexpress these arachidonic acid metabolizing pathways viz., follicular thyroid adenoma, Renal cell carcinoma, urinary bladder Transitional cell carcinoma, esophagus squamous cell carcinoma, colon adenocarcinoma, the Serous cystadenocarcinoma type of ovarian cancer, and uterine cervical carcinoma.

40|$|SUMMARY-A case-control, {{community-based}} {{study of}} 400 patients with {{cancer of the}} esophagus, mouth, and pharynx was undertaken to explore the association of environmental and dietary factors and familial aggregation. Twelve hundred age- and sex-matched controls were inter-viewed and asked the same questions as were the cancer patients. Both controls and patients had diets deficient in fresh Fruits, vegetables, meat, eggs, and milk, but high in beans and carbohydrates {{in the form of}} rice, bread, and such starchy roots as potatoes and sweet potatoes. Patients differed significantly from controls in that they used more alcohol, tobacco, hot beverages (mostly coffee), and spices. Their meals were Fewer, scantier, and more irregular, served very hot and without beverage. -J Nat Cancer Inst 42 : 1069 - 1094, 1969. THE INCIDENCE of cancer of the esophagus and its associated mortality in Puerto Rico are {{among the highest in the}} world. Cancer of the mouth and pharynx also ranks higher than in many other countries (1 - 3, 6, 8, 18 - 20, 26, 27, 29, 40 - 42). The increasing number of cases and the upward trends of age-adjusted rates (6, 26, 27) for these particular cancer sites justified the exploration of factors associated with the disease in Puerto Rico. Because of the relative isolation and stability of the population, the reliable Cancer Registry data (28), and the reasonably good medical care services operating on the Island, this community-based, retrospective study was made. The people of Puerto Rico still are quite receptive to surveys by the interview method, a condition which favors reliable answers.

50|$|In 1951, Lewis {{isolated}} {{a spontaneous}} <b>epidermoid</b> <b>carcinoma</b> in a mouse lung, which {{became known as}} a Lewis lung carcinoma. This carcinoma {{was one of the}} earliest tumors that could be transplanted and used to determine if a compound had potential as an anticancer agent.

In her study on myeloid infiltration, Lewis found that this phenomenon occurred in the adrenals but was not common to all subjects tested with tumors. However, tumor growth seemed to be associated with the progression of neutrophilia in peripheral blood and myeloid hyperplasia in certain organs. In the tumor atrophy paper, Margaret Lewis showed that tumor tissue inactivated in environments devoid of sufficient circulation and continued to stay in this arrested state when transplanted to other rats. This led to absorption and resistance to viable tumor implantation.|$|E
