5|$|Her early {{style is}} less {{individual}} and more realistic or primitive, despite <b>her</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> knowledge of, or perhaps rejection of, basic perspective.

5|$|As Sayid and John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) {{discuss the}} attack on Sayid, Locke {{suggests}} that Sawyer is the culprit, since he is doing well for himself on the island, hoarding other people's possessions, and also seems to dislike Sayid. Meanwhile, Shannon begins to have trouble breathing due to <b>her</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> medication and panic resulting from this problem. Jack tries beating answers out of Sawyer by punching him, but stops when he sees others' disapproval.

After Spencer explains that her behavior was inappropriate, Holly tearfully leaves the restaurant. The next morning, she apologizes to Heidi for her actions, and confirms that an invitation {{has been sent}} to a special guest.

5|$|Ashley is a Riskbreaker, {{a militant}} {{division}} of the VKP responsible for upholding state security and law. Although Callo accompanies him, Ashley does not accept her as a combat partner due to <b>her</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> combat experience. Callo ends up being Sydney's hostage and discovers the truth of Müllenkamp's activities. Another Riskbreaker, Rosencrantz, appears during Ashley's battles in Leá Monde, briefing him on the plans of the VKP, Sydney and the Cardinal, and subsequently his take on Ashley's past.

5|$|Only in {{exceptional}} circumstances would {{there have been no}} dowry, since the lack of one could have been interpreted as proof that no legitimate marriage occurred. A dowry may have been occasionally overlooked if a bride's family connections were very favorable; Callias reportedly married Elpinice, a daughter of the noble Philaidae, to join that family and was sufficiently wealthy that <b>her</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> a dowry did not concern him.|$|E

50|$|Kavan’s {{reception}} as a ’woman writer’ {{has been}} complicated by <b>her</b> perceived <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> attention to gender politics, and her fiction has most often been interpreted as autobiography rather than experimental and aesthetic writing.|$|R
5|$|The episode {{closes in}} the prime universe, where Peter {{explains}} the events {{of his time in}} the parallel universe to disinterested government agents. Meanwhile, Fauxlivia engages in idle chatter with Walter, nearly slipping and revealing her identity to him due to <b>her</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> knowledge of the prime universe's popular culture.

5|$|Between October and December 2005, Stefani toured North America in her Harajuku Lovers Tour 2005 {{to promote}} Love. Angel. Music. Baby., {{performing}} 37 {{shows in the}} United States and five in Canada. Her opening acts included Ciara, M.I.A. and The Black Eyed Peas. Her performances received mixed reviews from critics, with criticism about <b>her</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> musical material, frequent costume changes and perceived inability to dance, but praise for her stage presence and elaborate costumes. Stefani finished the recording of her second album, The Sweet Escape, in late 2006, having recorded some of the material in 2005, suspended the project due to pregnancy, and resumed recording in summer 2006.|$|E
5|$|Criticism of Shiller in the 2007 {{election}} largely {{focused on}} the lack of communication with ward residents, failure to obtain input from residents for zoning changes in the ward, <b>her</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> involvement in community policing meetings, and the many years of blighted retail in the ward. Some critics charged that Shiller was frustrating developers while using the Wilson Yard project to maintain her political base. In 2007, Shiller defeated social worker James Cappleman with 53% of the vote. In October, 2007, Shiller became chair of the City Council's Human Relations Committee. In 2009, Shiller was criticized by Uptown residents for her perceived lack of engagement in address crime in the neighborhood, including a string of violent robberies in nearby Lakeview that attracted the attention of the Chicago Tribune, Chicago Sun-Times, and local TV news. Police interviewed said interventions from Shiller and her staff facilitated the protection of gang members from policing activity, allegedly for gaining voter base, {{according to a report in}} Chicago Magazine.|$|E
50|$|Tilsner {{currently}} {{writes a}} blog, {{in which she}} writes about <b>her</b> complete <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> know-how in the kitchen, and how her attempts to feed her friends, family and children like other mothers often backfire.|$|R
50|$|Lertcheewakarn is a counterpuncher {{with her}} two-handed backhand and forehand. She is {{intelligent}} on court {{and has a}} good strategy. <b>Her</b> game is <b>lacking</b> powerful strokes, but based on precise groundstrokes. Her main weakness {{is considered to be}} <b>her</b> serve, <b>lacking</b> <b>of</b> power, consistency and stability.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Ahsoka wears [...] "pseudo-samurai" [...] armor in Star Wars Rebels, and <b>her</b> lightsabers' <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> color {{indicates}} she {{is neither}} a Jedi nor evil. Her facial markings differ from those in The Clone Wars due to her age.|$|R
5|$|Educated at {{home until}} she was seven, Bishop then went to a private {{elementary}} school {{until the age of}} nine. In 1909, then ten years old, she entered the progressive Fielden School in her hometown of Manchester, where she studied for three years. She completed her high school education at the Manchester High School for Girls. Though Bishop intended to study chemistry, <b>her</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> education in physics meant that she could not pursue her preferred course in the Honours School of Chemistry. Instead, she matriculated at Manchester University in October 1918 to study botany, chemistry, and zoology. That first-year course in zoology sparked her lifelong interest in and commitment to the field. She graduated with honours from the School of Zoology, receiving her Bachelor of Science degree in 1921; she received her master's degree in 1922. During her undergraduate years, under the tutelage of the helminthologist R.A. Wardle and the protozoologist Geoffrey Lapage, Bishop studied ciliates acquired from local ponds.|$|E
5|$|In December 1800 George Austen {{unexpectedly}} {{announced his}} decision to retire from the ministry, leave Steventon, and move the family to 4, Sydney Place in Bath. While retirement and travel were good for the elder Austens, Jane Austen was shocked to be told she was moving from the only home she had ever known. An indication of her state of mind is <b>her</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> productivity as a writer during the time she lived at Bath. She {{was able to make}} some revisions to Susan, and she began and then abandoned a new novel, The Watsons, but there was nothing like the productivity of the years 1795–1799. Tomalin suggests this reflects a deep depression disabling her as a writer, but Honan disagrees, arguing Austen wrote or revised her manuscripts throughout her creative life, except for a few months after her father died.|$|E
5|$|MTV Unplugged is a live EP by American {{singer and}} {{songwriter}} Mariah Carey, {{released in the}} United States on June 2, 1992 by Columbia Records. Following the success of Carey's previous two albums and the growing critical commentary on <b>her</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> concert tours and unsubstantial televised performances, Sony BMG organised a performance show at the Kaufman Astoria Studios, New York on March 16, 1992. The show, titled MTV Unplugged, originally aired on MTV to help promote Carey's album Emotions, as well as help shun critics who deemed Carey a possible studio artist. However, after its success, the show was {{released to the public}} as an EP, with an accompanying VHS titled MTV Unplugged +3.|$|E

50|$|Utada {{disputed the}} government's claim. In August 2008, the matter {{remained}} pending in Federal District Court in New York. On 27 January 2009, the Federal District Court in New York ordered the confiscated money returned to <b>her,</b> citing <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> evidence.|$|R

5|$|Shortly after Corder {{left the}} house, Maria {{set out to}} meet him at the Red Barn which was {{situated}} on Barnfield Hill, about half a mile from the Martens' cottage. This was the last time that she was seen alive. Corder also disappeared, but later turned up and claimed that Marten was in Ipswich, Great Yarmouth, or some other place nearby, and that he could not yet bring her back as his wife for fear of provoking the anger of his friends and relatives. The pressure on Corder to produce his wife eventually forced him to leave the area. He wrote letters to Marten's family claiming that they were married and living on the Isle of Wight, and he gave various excuses for <b>her</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> communication: she was unwell, she had hurt her hand, or the letter must have been lost.|$|E
5|$|The tale's disappointing qualities {{have been}} {{ascribed}} to Potter's growing {{lack of interest}} in writing for children, to pressure from her publisher for yet another book, and to Potter's desire to exploit the lucrative American market. Potter's artistically successful books were written for specific children; Timmy Tiptoes however was composed for Potter's amorphous, ill-defined American fanbase. By 1911, the demands of her aging parents and the business operations at her working farm, Hill Top, occupied much of Potter's time and attention to the exclusion of nearly everything else, and are accounted as some {{of the reasons for the}} author's declining artistry and <b>her</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> interest in producing children's books.|$|E
5|$|Victorious after {{defeating}} the King in the war, Meliara returns to Tlanth {{to improve its}} dilapidated castle with the family's new riches. One day, Bran visits her, accompanied by his new fiance Lady Nimiar Argaliar and the Marquis of Shevraeth, who is preparing to take the throne of Remalna. Now accustomed to the fine fashions of court, Bran expresses dismay at finding Mel dressed in old clothes - she never before cared about her appearance. Mel becomes shy and embarrassed about <b>her</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> courtly finesse and grace, and avoids the visitors, especially Shevraeth, who she fears looks down on her. Nimiar convinces Mel to return with them to court, and begins to teach her the essential of life there, including its customs, clothing styles, and hand fan language.|$|E
50|$|Kahu was {{distinguished}} from other boats of the Moa class by the gantry on <b>her</b> quarterdeck and <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> funnels.|$|R
5000|$|In January 2013, Jennifer Lawrence {{declined}} {{the chance to}} appear on the show, citing <b>her</b> youth and <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> experience.|$|R
6000|$|... "Notwithstanding," [...] Mabane continued, [...] "our {{absolute}} {{ignorance of}} everything connected with <b>her,</b> our <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> {{any sort of}} claim or title {{to the charge of}} her, and the increasing number of people who still persist in trying to take her from us?" ...|$|R
