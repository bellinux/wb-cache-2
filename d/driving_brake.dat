30|$|Percentile {{contour plots}} reveal {{interesting}} features. Lets first consider the inner contour, corresponding to 99.9  % of driving time (0.1 percentiles label). This shows a distinct mushroom shaped pattern. The mushroom stipe corresponds to braking. At 0.1 percentiles (99.9  % of <b>driving</b> time) <b>braking</b> occurs between approximately − 0.5  m/s 2 and − 2  m/s 2. The corresponding lateral acceleration {{is smaller than}} 0.5  m/s 2. This means that for most of <b>driving,</b> <b>braking</b> occurs without significant lateral accelerations.|$|R

In {{order to}} improve the {{comprehensive}} and rationality of examination for <b>driving</b> <b>braking</b> performance with Mean Fully Developed Deceleration (MFDD) in road test, also to {{provide a basis for}} <b>driving</b> <b>braking</b> performance evaluation with MFDD when real driving, an approach for determining the MFDD threshold is proposed considering initial braking velocity and passenger capacity. According to the vehicle braking performance road test rules in GB 7258, a simulation model is built, and simulation tests are made with different initial braking velocities. Based on simulation data, MFDD is calculated, and the curve of MFDD with initial braking velocity is also given, and then the effects of initial braking velocity on MFDD and its threshold are analyzed; the curves of MFDD thresholds with initial braking velocity are plotted with no-load and full-load respectively. The influence of passenger capacity on MFDD threshold is analyzed, and the curve of MFDD threshold with passenger capacity is given, too. Finally, the formula of MFDD threshold with initial braking velocity, seating capacity and passenger capacity is resulted...|$|R

CIÉ converted the many different interior layouts to their own standard design (6201–08 ex 99521–22/24–29, Restaurant Buffet 6401 ex 99523), fitted their own Mark 3 type powered door and re-bogied with ABB bogies.

50|$|A <b>Driving</b> <b>Brake</b> Standard Open (DBSO) {{is a type}} of railway carriage, {{converted}} to operate as a control car (Not to be confused with DVTs as used in InterCity 225 sets). Fourteen such vehicles, numbered 9701 to 9714, were converted from Mark 2F Brake Standard Open (standard class coaches with brake van) carriages. Modifications included adding a driving cab and TDM equipment to allow a locomotive to be driven remotely. Using a system known as push-pull, the driver in the DBSO can drive the locomotive, even though it is {{at the rear of the}} train.|$|E

40|$|In this project, {{the authors}} {{investigated}} the dynamics {{and reliability of}} a brake control system using a test bench which is a Lincoln Town Car brake system. The objectives of the project are to: 1) experimentally characterize the brake system; 2) obtain good nonlinear models of the brake system; 3) perform reliability analysis of the brake control system; and, 4) develop algorithms for brake malfunction detection and brake reliability enhancement. By using the brake test bench, the dynamic characteristics of the brake-actuator system are studied experimentally. Based on the experimental results, two models are obtained {{for the first time}} - one for the whole brake-actuator system, the other for the hydraulic actuator. Efficient controllers are then designed to cancel the nonlinearities in the brake system. Through extensive experiments, algorithms for the malfunction detection have been developed. Additionally, the feasibility of the brake control system to Advanced Vehicle Control Systems (AVCS) applications has been investigated.
