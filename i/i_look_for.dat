In December, he wrote to a friend in Seattle, [...] "A message came yesterday that 1,000 people had left Nome during the last three days for here. <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> half of Dawson here before spring." [...] In January 1903, Barnette's cook, Jujiro Wada, arrived in Dawson City with word of the gold find. On January 17, 1903, the Yukon Sun newspaper ran the headline [...] "RICH STRIKE MADE IN THE TANANA" [...] across most of its front page, spurring miners from the Yukon to stampede to Fairbanks in the first big rush of the settlement's history.|$|E

[...] For myself <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> the contrasting effects in the foliage, which changes with the tones of the sky. [...] At times, when the tree bares its pale blossoms and big blue flies, emerald fruit beetles and cicadas in great numbers fly about, everything is immersed in pure blue. [...] Then, as the bronzer foliage takes on more mature tones, the sky is radiant and streaked with green and orange, and then again, further into autumn, the leaves take on violet tones something of the color of a ripe fig, and this violet effect manifests itself most fully with the contrast of the large, whitening sun within its pale halo of light lemon. [...] Sometimes, too, after a shower I've seen the whole sky pink and orange, which gave an exquisite value and coloring to the silvery gray-greens. [...] And among all this were women, also pink, who were gathering the fruit." ...|$|E

Ramsey Isler from IGN rated the episode 8.6/10, as he thought it [...] "delivered action, suspense, mystery, and the final climax" [...] to Peter discovering his origins, and it was [...] "a great achievement that marks a big turning point for the series". Like other critics, Isler also praised Jackson and Noble's acting. Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly lauded Noble and Jackson's performances, calling Peter's change back to [...] "the secretive, bitter, scurrilous character he was before the series started" [...] a [...] "wrenching daring move {{on the part of}} the show". Tim Grierson of the magazine New York was worried that the hype surrounding Peter's secret would not pay off, but believed [...] "Happily, last night's episode perfectly handled that anticipated plot point... turned out to be much better than could have been hoped".|$|E

Despite its underground reputation, the song {{became one of}} Scott-Heron's most successful singles, as it reached the number 15 spot on the R Singles Chart. According to an article on Scott-Heron for a November 1974 issue of Billboard, {{the success of the}} single [...] "has made his most recent album, 'Winter in America', a national best-seller and heralds his wide-ranging appeal." [...] The success of [...] "The Bottle" [...] also helped lead to Jackson's and Scott-Heron's following recording contract with Arista Records, which had been established in late 1974, the label at which they would enjoy further success and a larger amount of commercial notice. Upon signing them, Arista executive Clive Davis said of Scott-Heron in an interview with Rolling Stone, [...] "Not only is he an excellent poet, musician and performer—three qualities <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> that are rarely combined—but he's a leader of social thought." [...] Along with approval from Arista executives, Winter in America was well received by the underground music scene, in which Scott-Heron earned the majority of his fan base, and added to Scott-Heron's reputation as a socially aware and conscious artist.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} track, [...] "The Rock Show", is the opposite: {{an upbeat}} [...] "effervescent celebration of love, life and music". It was written as a [...] "fast punk-rock love song" [...] in the vein of the Ramones and Screeching Weasel. The song {{tells the story}} of two teenagers meeting a rock concert, and, despite failing grades and disapproving parents, falling and staying in love. It was inspired by the band's early days in San Diego's all-ages venue SOMA. [...] "Stay Together for the Kids" [...] follows and is written about divorce {{from the point of view}} of a helpless child. Inspired by DeLonge's parents' divorce, it is one of the band's darker songs. [...] "Roller Coaster" [...] was written when Hoppus had a nightmare when he and his wife, Skye, first began dating; the song is about finding something ideal but fearing for its certain departure. [...] "Reckless Abandon" [...] was penned by DeLonge as a reflection on summer memories, including parties, skateboarding and trips to the beach. [...] "Everytime <b>I</b> <b>Look</b> <b>for</b> You" [...] has no specific lyrical basis, according to Hoppus, and [...] "Give Me One Good Reason" [...] was written about punk music and nonconformity in a high school setting. [...] "Shut Up", a [...] "broken-family snapshot", revisits the territory of youthful woes, described by Shooman as a [...] "fairly familiar rites-of-passage tale" [...] that [...] "adds to general themes of isolation, alienation and moving on to a new place that pervade Take Off Your Pants and Jacket". [...] "Please Take Me Home" [...] concludes the standard edition of the album and was written about the consequences of a friendship developing into a relationship.|$|E

[...] In another interview, she identified the song as the one that best represented her at that time, explaining, [...] "if you think you can only conquer me if you're famous, rich and have an expensive car, you're wrong, because I'm a woman who needs affection, someone to open the door for me, to bring me flowers and sing to me." ...|$|E

2500|$|In February 1801 Pitt {{resigned}} as Prime Minister, {{having failed to}} convince the King {{of the necessity of}} Catholic Emancipation and repeal of the Test Acts. Henry Addington was appointed Premier. Fitzwilliam was eager to co-operate with the Pittites on Emancipation and foreign policy. He did not value Addington: [...] "the idea of an Addington administration is the joke of every party" [...] he wrote to Lady Fitzwilliam on 23 March. Fitzwilliam opposed Addington's negotiated peace with France. Thomas Grenville wrote to Lord Grenville on 22 October to say that Fitzwilliam was [...] "determined to oppose the peace even if he should be single". On 12 October Fox spoke at the Whig Club to rejoice at the peace. Fitzwilliam wrote to Laurence on 16 October that [...] "English humiliation has reached its acme... a great trial of patience, what passed at the Whig Club is no less so: I cannot bear to think of either. I stand up a little for English dignity and <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> English feeling: I find none of the first in the one, nor the latter in the other". On 3 November Fitzwilliam delivered his speech against the peace, describing it as [...] "a hollow and precarious truce...for the two islands of Trinidad and Ceylon, this country had been nine years engaged in war, and had wasted some hundred millions of money, and the lives of thousands of her subjects". He also claimed that the peace might lead to [...] "the letting loose of corresponding societies, and giving an opportunity of dispersing the pernicious principles of the French Republic to the seditious and disaffected". Fitzwilliam was one of sixteen opposition peers to vote against the definitive treaty of peace when it was put before Parliament in May 1802. He also opposed the government's policy on the civil list as it was not in accordance with Burke's Civil List and Secret Service Money Act 1782. He also opposed the government's Militia Act 1802 (which augmented the militia) due to his Whiggish opposition to standing armies and also because the militia was unequal socially and [...] "a levy on the poor". He also opposed the Combination Acts in principle, though had reservations about combinations which had a tendency to limit the freedom of trade.|$|E
