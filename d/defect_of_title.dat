In kind of execution is in this thesis analysed just execution on money judgement. Whole matter is observed from the position of beneficiary, as it is foreshown in Chapter One. The main accent is put on the chosen tasks inseperably connected with the position of beneficiary, that are in common standing of executions solved very often. The reason of such kind of specialization is that within positive legal regulation in Czech Republic cannot be solicitation of debts through the execution proceedings considered as troublefree. Chapter Two briefly describes execution proceeding. More detailed despcription is devoted just to relevant differences between the execution realized by executor and per curiam. To the contrary the Chapter Three is focused directly on procedural position of beneficiary pending execution proceedings, e. i. within single stages. Statutory conditions for ordering to execution are than analyzed in closer method. Fourth Chapter deals with selected <b>defects</b> <b>of</b> execution <b>title.</b> Main [...] ...|$|R
60|$|When I {{first came}} into a public trust, I found your Parliament in {{possession}} of an unlimited legislative power over the colonies. I could not open the statute-book without seeing the actual exercise of it, more or less, in all cases whatsoever. This possession passed {{with me for a}} title. It does so in all human affairs. No man examines into the <b>defects</b> <b>of</b> his <b>title</b> to his paternal estate or to his established government. Indeed, common sense taught me that a legislative authority not actually limited by the express terms of its foundation, or by its own subsequent acts, cannot have its powers parcelled out by argumentative distinctions, so as to enable us to say that here they can and there they cannot bind. Nobody was so obliging as to produce to me any record of such distinctions, by compact or otherwise, either at the successive formation of the several colonies or during the existence of any of them. If any gentlemen were able to see how one power could be given up (merely on abstract reasoning) without giving up the rest, I can only say that they saw further than I could. Nor did I ever presume to condemn any one for being clear-sighted when I was blind. I praise their penetration and learning, and hope that their practice has been correspondent to their theory.|$|R

Based on the analysis <b>of</b> various <b>defects</b> <b>of</b> tours, I {{have come to the}} concept <b>of</b> <b>defects</b> <b>of</b> tours in the Czech law and have assessed whether the <b>defects</b> <b>of</b> tours allows liberation reasons or not. When dealing with the issue chosen, I analysed the sources of inspiration for the interpretation and inference of legal concepts of the current legislation applicable to <b>defects</b> <b>of</b> tours, which present interpretive guidance for the interpretation and understanding <b>of</b> the <b>defects</b> <b>of</b> tours. First, I analysed the regulation of the consequences of a breach of contract as contained in the Package Tour Directive, which is a model for <b>defects</b> <b>of</b> tours in the Czech law and which regulates the reasons for liberation from the responsibility of a tour organiser for any breach of contract. Within the Czech legal order, I examined the relationship between the <b>defects</b> <b>of</b> tours and compensation for damage incurred as a result of any breach of a tour contract. I also considered the possibility of applicability of the general regulation of defective performance to <b>defects</b> <b>of</b> tours.
