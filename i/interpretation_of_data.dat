25|$|During the Earth flyby, the MESSENGER team imaged the Earth and Moon using MDIS {{and checked}} the status of several other {{instruments}} observing the atmospheric and surface compositions and testing the magnetosphere and determining that all instruments tested were working as expected.

Ensuring that the instruments functioned correctly at such an early stage in the mission allowed opportunity for multiple minor errors to be dealt with.|$|E

25|$|The general {{analytical}} approach employed by Lomborg {{is based on}} cost-benefit analyses as employed in economics, social science, and the formulation and assessment of government policy. Much of Lomborg's examination of his Litany is based on statistical data analysis, therefore his work may be considered a work of that nature. Since it examines {{the costs and benefits}} of its many topics, it could be considered a work in economics, as categorized by its publisher. However, The Skeptical Environmentalist is methodologically eclectic and cross-disciplinary, combining <b>interpretation</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> with assessments of the media and human behavior, evaluations of scientific theories, and other approaches, to arrive at its various conclusions.|$|E
25|$|A more {{stringent}} test would involve following the chemical shifts {{of each and}} every atom in the molecule by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) as a function of temperature/denaturant. Though time-consuming, this method does not require any specific model for the <b>interpretation</b> <b>of</b> <b>data.</b> The Tms for all the atoms should be identical within experimental error if the protein folds in a two-state manner. But for a protein that folds globally downhill the unfolding curves should have widely different Tms. The atomic unfolding behavior of BBL was found to follow the latter, showing a large spread in the Tms consistent with global downhill behavior. The Tms of some atoms were found to be {{similar to that of the}} global Tm (obtained from a low-resolution technique like CD or fluorescence), indicating that the unfolding of multiple atoms has to be followed, instead of a few as is frequently done in such experiments. The average atomic unfolding behavior was strikingly similar to that of CD, underlining the fact that unfolding curves of low resolution experiments are highly simplified representations of a more complex behavior.|$|E
500|$|Cheryl L. Gillespie gave Sexual Preference a mixed {{review in}} Family Relations, commending Bell et al. {{for using a}} {{sophisticated}} methodology and trying to avoid [...] "poorly designed measures and biased interpretation of data". Nevertheless, she found their methodology and <b>interpretation</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> open to question, writing that although their San Francisco Bay Area sample was arguably non-representative, they wrote as though the study was representative of the larger population, {{that they did not}} sufficiently explore the issue of bias in their subjects' self-reports, which might have been motivated by the subjects' ideology or desire to please the researchers by telling them what they thought they wanted to hear, and that they relegated the fact that respondents who had been exposed to scientific information regarding homosexuality were more likely to characterize their parents in accord with psychoanalytic models of emotionally absent fathers and domineering mothers to a footnote. She also suggested that readers might find Sexual Preference boring.|$|E
