5|$|The Soviets {{were less}} prepared. While they {{anticipated}} a German invasion, with possible Finnish support, Stalin did not <b>expect</b> <b>an</b> attack {{along the entire}} border so early. The border was heavily fortified, but Soviet leadership was unprepared for the German attack. The formation opposing Silver Fox was the Northern Front, consisting of the 7th and 14th Armies. They were commanded by Lieutenant-General Markian Popov. On 23 August 1941, the Northern Front was split up into the Karelian Front and the Leningrad Front, commanded by Valerian Frolov and Popov. Frolov remained {{in command of the}} Karelian Front until 1 September, when he was promoted and replaced by Roman Panin. During the first weeks the Axis would have a numerical superiority, as the Soviets only had 150,000 men north of Lake Ladoga along the border.|$|E
5|$|VOC forces {{landed on}} 4–5 May on Trunajaya's right flank. Trunajaya did not <b>expect</b> <b>an</b> attack on this flank, and {{consequently}} {{it was only}} lightly defended. VOC took Ampel after little resistance. In the following days, the VOC established its battery in Ampel, simultaneously conducting desultory negotiations with Trunajaya. Trunajaya accused Speelman of being unknightly by attacking his right flank instead of his main position. Both Trunajaya and VOC moved their works forward until their artillery batteries faced each other at pistol-shot distance. Trunajaya dammed the river, the VOC's source of fresh water; afterwards, the VOC troops were limited to brackish water, and diseases soon spread.|$|E
5|$|Div Cav {{spent the}} first three weeks of the pursuit camped near Bardia. On 2 December, as part of the {{outflanking}} move around El Agheila, the regiment began an eight-day drive on transporters to El Haseiat. After unloading its vehicles, the regiment continued its flanking movement. On 14 December, it was placed under the command of the 4th Light Armoured Brigade, with which it spent the night. C Squadron screened the brigade in the morning and by 16:00 the regiment had drawn away from the brigade as C Squadron reached the escarpment. The German 15th Panzer Division, halted on the road due to a fuel shortage, was targeted by Div Cav. During the night, the regiment withdrew and laagered while the Germans retreated. At 05:45 the next morning, XXX Corps headquarters ordered the division to attack the Germans and the regiment was advised to <b>expect</b> <b>an</b> attack from the east by a hundred tanks. Div Cav was ordered to withdraw south-west, along the line of its previous advance. When the regiment had gone back , it surprised a German column. ASquadron engaged, as the other squadrons hastily withdrew. In the evening, the regiment advanced a mile west and laagered.|$|E

5|$|The {{toxic dose}} of {{paracetamol}} is highly variable. In general the recommended maximum daily dose for healthy adults is 4grams. Higher doses lead to increasing risk of toxicity. In adults, single doses above 10grams or 200mg/kg of bodyweight, whichever is lower, {{have a reasonable}} likelihood of causing toxicity. Toxicity can also occur when multiple smaller doses within 24hours exceed these levels. Following a normal dose of 1gram of paracetamol {{four times a day}} for two weeks, patients can <b>expect</b> <b>an</b> increase in alanine transaminase in their liver to typically about three times the normal value. It is unlikely that this dose would lead to liver failure. Studies have shown significant hepatotoxicity is uncommon in patients who have taken greater than normal doses over 3 to 4 days. In adults, a dose of 6grams a day over the preceding 48hours could potentially lead to toxicity, while in children acute doses above 200mg/kg could potentially cause toxicity. Acute paracetamol overdose in children rarely causes illness or death, and it is very uncommon for children to have levels that require treatment, with chronic larger-than-normal doses being the major cause of toxicity in children.|$|E

Their imperium was nevertheless prorogued for the following year. The senate's instructions were that they should await their successors and then dismiss their troops and return to Rome, but when the plague claimed the life {{of one of the}} consuls for 180, public business was suspended, and the two proconsuls decided to march against the Ligurian Apuani, presumably without authorization.

25|$|The first {{movement}} of the retreating diversion were led by Fang Zhimin. Fang (and his deputy, Xun Weizhou) {{were the first to}} break through Kuomintang lines in June, followed by Xiao Ke in August. These movements surprised the Kuomintang, who were numerically superior to the communists and did not <b>expect</b> <b>an</b> attack on their fortified perimeter. However, Fang Zhimin's force was crushed after its initial success and Xun Weizhou was killed in action. Nearly every commander was wounded and captured alive (including Fang Zhimin), and all were executed by the nationalists. The only exception was Su Yu, who escaped. Xiao Ke fared no better, although his forces initially broke through and reached He Long's communist base in Hubei. Even with their combined forces they could not challenge the nationalist forces, and did not return until the establishment of the People's Republic of China 15 years later.|$|E
25|$|More {{controversial}} was {{the proposal}} for an “understanding” clause requiring each applicant to demonstrate {{an understanding of}} the Constitution to a county registrar. Alfred P. Thom, a railroad lawyer from Norfolk, explained “I would not <b>expect</b> <b>an</b> impartial administration of the clause.” There would be no “friendship by the white man to the suffrage of the black man”, but on the other hand, Thom did not expect a rigid examination for a white man, “this clause will not exclude any worthy white citizen of this Commonwealth from the suffrage…he will find a friendly examiner.” Robert William Blair of Southwest Wythe County objected to the provisions proposed by Carter Glass which were the same methods used to bring disenfranchisement other Southern states. The understanding clause would give too much power to the “caprice and corruption of a dishonest election officer.” In western Virginia, hundreds would be unable to meet the new requirements, without enough property, unable to pay the poll tax for three consecutive years, or who would fail the registrar’s examination on Constitutional understanding.|$|E

25|$|Assuming French {{hostility and}} a desire to recover Alsace-Lorraine, Moltke (the Elder) drew up a {{deployment}} plan for 1871–72, expecting that another rapid victory could be achieved but the French introduced conscription in 1872. By 1873, Moltke thought that the French army was too powerful to be defeated quickly and in 1875, Moltke considered a preventive war but did not <b>expect</b> <b>an</b> easy victory. The course of the second period of the Franco-Prussian War and the example of the Wars of Unification had prompted Austria to begin conscription in 1868 and Russia in 1874. Moltke assumed that in another war, Germany would have to fight a coalition of France and Austria or France and Russia. Even if one opponent was quickly defeated, the victory could not be exploited before the Germans had to redeploy their armies against the second enemy. By 1877, Moltke was writing war plans with provision for an incomplete victory, in which diplomats negotiated a peace, even if it meant a return to the Status quo ante bellum and in 1879, the deployment plan reflected pessimism over the possibility of a Franco-Russian alliance and progress made by the French fortification programme.|$|E
25|$|At 02:00 on 6 June 1944, the Germans {{reported}} the landing of parachutists east of Caen {{and in the}} Coutances, Valognes and Saint-Lô areas and hearing ships engines out at sea. In response the Germans ordered the 7th Army to increase {{the level of their}} preparedness and to <b>expect</b> <b>an</b> invasion, but General Hans Speidel decreased the level of alert when it was reported only dummy parachutists had been found. However, Generalfeldmarshall Gerd von Rundstedt ordered the 12th SS Panzerdivision Hitlerjugend to deal with a supposed parachute landing on the coast near Lisieux which was found to consist solely of dummies from Titanic III. The dummies and SAS teams of Titanic IV diverted a Kampfgruppe from the 915th Grenadier Regiment, the 352nd Infantry Division reserve away from the Omaha and Gold beaches and the 101st Airborne Divisions drop zones. The regiment, believing an airborne division had landed, were employed searching woods instead of heading to the invasion beaches. Enigma intercepts from the area of Titanic I revealed that the German commander was reporting a major landing up the coast from Le Havre (well {{to the north of the}} landing beaches) and that he had been cut off by them.|$|E
