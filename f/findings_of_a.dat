5|$|Estimates of lifespans {{for wild}} orcas vary. SeaWorld says wild lifespans are 30–50 years for females, and 19–30 years for males. These {{estimates}} {{depart from the}} <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> 2005 study, which pegged {{the mean age of}} females at 45.8 years and males at 31.0 during the period between 1973 and 1996. Marine conservation groups argue that even these estimates are low due to the effects of hunting, pollution, and capture on the wild populations, and that natural wild orca lifespans are equivalent to that of humans, with male orcas living up to 75 years and female orcas living up to 80 years.|$|E

The report indicated that 204 of 396 fatalities in U.S. jetliner crashes since 1967 had occurred in mid-air collisions. Additionally, near-miss situations involving jetliners occurred on average at least once per day, with the Los Angeles and New York areas noted as being especially high-risk. Finally, the report noted that the current trend in air casualties indicated that a further 528 people would die in mid-air collisions during the following ten years.

5|$|Small sized {{pterosaur}} species {{apparently were}} present in the Csehbánya Formation, indicating a higher diversity of Late Cretaceous pterosaurs than previously accounted for. The recent <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> small cat-sized adult azhdarchid further indicate that small pterosaurs from the Late Cretaceous might actually have simply been rarely preserved in the fossil record, helped by {{the fact that there is}} a strong bias against terrestrial small sized vertebrates such as juvenile dinosaurs, and that their diversity might actually had been much larger than previously thought.|$|E
5|$|The {{basic unit}} of {{measurement}} used during construction was the tala, defined as {{the length of a}} human face from the forehead's hairline to the tip of the chin or the distance from the tip of the thumb to the tip of the middle finger when both fingers are stretched at their maximum distance. The unit is thus relative from one individual to the next, but the monument has exact measurements. A survey conducted in 1977 revealed frequent <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> ratio of 4:6:9 around the monument. The architect had used the formula to lay out the precise dimensions of the fractal and self-similar geometry in Borobudur's design. This ratio is also found in the designs of Pawon and Mendut, nearby Buddhist temples. Archeologists have conjectured that the 4:6:9 ratio and the tala have calendrical, astronomical and cosmological significance, {{as is the case with}} the temple of Angkor Wat in Cambodia.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time that Salk was testing his vaccine, both Albert Sabin and Hilary Koprowski {{continued}} working on developing a vaccine using live virus. During a meeting in Stockholm to discuss polio vaccines in November 1955, Sabin presented results obtained on a group of 80 volunteers, while Koprowski read a paper detailing the <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> trial enrolling 150 people. Sabin and Koprowski both eventually succeeded in developing vaccines. Because of the commitment to the Salk vaccine in America, Sabin and Koprowski both did their testing outside of the United States, Sabin in Mexico and then in the Soviet Union, and Koprowski in the Congo and Poland. In 1957, Sabin developed a trivalent vaccine, containing attenuated strains of all three types of poliovirus. In 1959, ten million children in the Soviet Union received the Sabin oral vaccine. For this work, Sabin was given the medal of the Order of Friendship Among Peoples, described as the Soviets' highest civilian honor, despite having become an American {{during the height of the}} cold war. Sabin's oral vaccine using live virus came into commercial use in 1961. Once Sabin’s oral vaccine became widely available, it supplanted Salk’s injected vaccine because it was cheaper to produce and easier to administer.|$|E

25|$|While the {{available}} evidence is weak, tentative results suggest that frequent ejaculation may decrease the risk of prostate cancer.

The results were broadly similar to the <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> smaller Australian study and an American study.|$|E
25|$|The current superdominance of Eucalyptus in Australia {{may be an}} {{artefact}} {{of human}} influence on its ecology.

Though this occurs at different rates throughout Australia, it is compelling evidence for a relationship between the artificial increase of fire frequency with the arrival of Aboriginals and increased prevalence of this exceptionally fire-tolerant genus.|$|E
