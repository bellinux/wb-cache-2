5|$|After a {{telephone}} discussion with a Casper weather briefer, Reid {{decided to take}} off despite the worsening conditions at the airport, {{and to try to}} escape the poor weather by turning immediately eastward.

5|$|If Mirs main {{computer}} {{had failed}} after Progress M1-5 had docked, then the <b>flight</b> <b>plan</b> {{would have been}} modified to use either the station's BUPO rendezvous system, or the Progress for control. Under this plan, the third deorbit burn would have been conducted 24 hours after the first two burns, with the station being spin-stabilised again between {{the second and third}} burns. Controllers also planned for a failure of Mirs power system, which would have resulted in the deorbit being delayed one day, with all guidance and control functions being handled by the Progress spacecraft.|$|E
40|$|After {{a number}} of {{background}} studies (including surveys, a simulator study, and interviews with commercial air traffic controllers, dispatchers, and pilots), several design concepts have been developed t o guide {{in the design of}} tools to aid in enroute <b>flight</b> <b>planning</b> activities. Alternative versions of these tools have been implemented in the <b>Flight</b> <b>Planning</b> Testbed (FPT), a part-task simulation environment for studying interactions with <b>flight</b> <b>planning</b> tools. This testbed, which runs on a Macintosh IIfx, presents scenarios and records all interaction with the operators. Thirty commercial airline pilots participated in a between-subjects experiment involving three alternative system designs and four <b>flight</b> <b>planning</b> scenarios. The results provide some very interesting insights into planning strategies and the effects of cognitive tools on those strategies. BACKGROUND The <b>Flight</b> <b>Planning</b> Testbed is the culmination of a two year effort to design a system that would allow testing of various design concepts for supporting enroute <b>flight</b> <b>planning.</b> Enroute <b>flight</b> <b>planning</b> involves the adaptation of a <b>planned</b> <b>flight,</b> while it is airborne, in response to...|$|R

5|$|One of {{the first}} {{theories}} considered by investigators was that Flight 2511 {{was involved in a}} collision with another airliner, given the crash site's proximity to Wilmington Airport.

There was no record of any other aircraft, or of any military missiles having been fired. Furthermore, wreckage of Flight 2511 was confined to two general locations: the primary crash scene near Bolivia and the secondary scene in Kure Beach. All debris was accounted for as belonging to the DC-6.|$|E
5|$|Near {{midnight on}} 20 May, Eichmann was sedated by an Israeli doctor on the Mossad team and {{dressed as a}} flight attendant.

After a tense delay at the airport getting the <b>flight</b> <b>plan</b> approved, the plane took off for Israel, stopping over in Dakar, Senegal, to refuel. They arrived in Israel on 22 May, and Ben-Gurion announced Eichmann's capture to the Knesset—Israel's parliament—the following afternoon. In Argentina, the abduction was met with a violent wave of antisemitism carried out by far-right elements, including the Tacuara Nationalist Movement.|$|E

40|$|The {{objectives}} of this continuing effort are {{to develop and}} evaluate new algorithms and advanced concepts for flight management and <b>flight</b> <b>planning.</b> This includes the minimization of fuel or direct operating costs, {{the integration of the}} airborne flight management and ground-based <b>flight</b> <b>planning</b> processes, and the enhancement of future traffic management systems design. Flight management (FMS) concepts are for on-board profile computation and steering of transport aircraft in the vertical plane between a city pair and along a given horizontal path. <b>Flight</b> <b>planning</b> (FPS) concepts are for the pre-flight ground based computation of the three-dimensional reference trajectory that connects the city pair and specifies the horizontal path, fuel load, and weather profiles for initializing the FMS. As part of these objectives, a new computer program called EFPLAN has been developed and utilized to study advanced <b>flight</b> <b>planning</b> concepts. EFPLAN represents an experimental version of an FPS. It has been developed to generate reference <b>flight</b> <b>plans</b> compatible as input to an FMS and to provide various options for <b>flight</b> <b>planning</b> research.

5|$|The {{autopilot}} {{system used}} at the time had four basic control modes: HEADING, VOR/LOC, ILS, and INS. The HEADING mode maintained a constant magnetic course selected by the pilot. The VOR/LOC mode maintained the plane on a specific course, transmitted from a VOR (VHF omnidirectional range, a type of short-range radio signal transmitted from ground beacons) or Localizer (LOC) beacon selected by the pilot. The ILS (instrument landing system) mode caused the plane to track both vertical and lateral course beacons, {{which led to a}} specific runway selected by the pilot. The INS (inertial navigation system) mode maintained the plane on lateral course lines between selected <b>flight</b> <b>plan</b> waypoints programmed into the INS computer.|$|E
5|$|Planning began for {{the third}} U.S. orbital mission in February 1962, aiming for a six-or-seven-orbit flight {{to build on the}} {{previous}} three-orbit missions. NASA officially announced the mission on June 27, and the <b>flight</b> <b>plan</b> was finalized in late July. The mission focused on engineering tests rather than on scientific experimentation. The mission finally launched on the morning of October 3, having been delayed two weeks because of problems with the Atlas booster. A series of minor booster problems during launch and a faulty temperature controller in Schirra's pressure suit were the only technical problems noted during the flight. The spacecraft orbited in both automated and passive flight modes for prolonged periods while the pilot monitored it and carried out some minor scientific experiments. After six orbits, the capsule landed in the Pacific Ocean half a mile from the recovery carrier, and was hoisted aboard for Schirra to disembark.|$|E
5|$|Years later, {{six months}} after the Battle of New York, Stark's {{experiences}} during the alien invasion are giving him panic attacks. Restless, he has built several dozen Iron Man suits, creating friction with his girlfriend Pepper Potts. Meanwhile, a string of bombings by a terrorist known only as the Mandarin has left intelligence agencies bewildered by a lack of forensic evidence. Stark's security chief Happy Hogan is badly injured in a Mandarin attack, causing Stark to issue a televised threat to the Mandarin, who responds by destroying Stark's home with helicopter gunships. Hansen, who came to warn Stark, survives the attack along with Potts. Stark escapes in an Iron Man suit, which his artificial intelligence J.A.R.V.I.S. pilots to rural Tennessee, following a <b>flight</b> <b>plan</b> from Stark's investigation into the Mandarin. Stark's experimental armor lacks sufficient power to return to California, and the world believes him dead.|$|E

40|$|This book {{presents}} {{optimal control}} techniques for aircraft trajectory planning looking at reduction of fuel consumption, emissions, and overfly charges in <b>flights</b> <b>plans.</b> The <b>flight</b> <b>planning</b> {{problem can be}} regarded as a trajectory optimization problem. The most natural way to adress a trajectory optimization problem is using optimal control techniques. The multiphase nature of the problem, the non-linear dynamics of the aircraft, and the introduction of integer variables to model decision-making processes lead to the formulation of a multiphase mixed-integer optimal control problem. It is shown that the <b>flight</b> <b>planning</b> problem can be effectively tackled using mixed-integer optimal control, considering multiple phases and including decisión-making processes. Results show that the efficiency of current <b>flights</b> <b>plans</b> could be sustantially improved and that the techniques herein studied have a strong potentiality to be employed in the definition of more efficient <b>flight</b> <b>plans</b> undr future operational concepts in air traffic management.

Jackson was survived by two brothers and two sisters, and by his fourth wife, Terri, their daughter Brianna, and Aja, Jackson's stepdaughter. He was survived by his third wife Betty Bennett and their son Lindsey and daughter Alex. Jackson was survived by his second wife Ruth Davis who sang background vocals for Springsteen.
