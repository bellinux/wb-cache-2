2500|$|Longliners â€“ use {{one or more}} long heavy fishing {{lines with}} a series of {{hundreds}} or even thousands of baited hooks hanging from the main line by means of branch lines called [...] "snoods". Hand operated longlining can be operated from boats of any size. The number of <b>hooks</b> <b>and</b> <b>lines</b> [...] handled depends on the size of vessel, the number of crew, and the level of mechanisation. Large purpose built longliners can be designed for single species fisheries such as tuna. On such larger vessels the bridge is usually placed aft, and the gear is hauled from the bow or from the side with mechanical or hydraulic line haulers. The lines are set over the stern. Automatic or semi-automatic systems are used to bait hooks and shoot and haul lines. These systems include rail rollers, line haulers, hook separators, dehookers and hook cleaners, and storage racks or drums. To avoid incidental catches of seabirds, an outboard setting funnel is used to guide the line from the setting position on the stern down to a depth of one or two metres. Small scale longliners handle the gear by hand. The line is stored into baskets or tubs, perhaps using a hand cranked line drum.|$|E

He has known them to strike at the oars of the boat and at the end of the ropes that trailed in the water. At Pensacola they reach a length of twenty to thirty inches, and are considered good food fish.

This is the best fishing-place for the cutlass-fish, Trichiurus. The fishing takes place before day; all lines are pulled in as fast as they are thrown out, with the certainty that the cutlass has been hooked. As many as ninety boats have been counted on this fishing-ground at daybreak during the season.|$|E
60|$|The great rivals, {{in point}} of numbers, to the herring and other fish in the rivers of New Jersey (and the snakes in their winter {{quarters}} underground), were the wild pigeons in the air.

As it was unnecessary to use <b>hooks</b> <b>and</b> <b>lines</b> to catch a few fish out of the multitudes which swarmed in the streams, so it was hardly worth while to waste powder and shot on the vast flocks of pigeons which visited New Jersey in those days.
