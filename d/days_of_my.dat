With the entire heavenly court as my witness, I choose you this day for my Mother. I deliver and consecrate myself to you, my body and soul, myself, both interior and exterior, and the worth of my good actions, past, present and future; leaving to you the total right of disposing of me, and all that belongs to me, according to your wish, for the greater glory of God in time and in eternity.|$|E
500|$|After a tour {{supporting}} his album Cuts Like a Knife, he immediately started the recording sessions {{for the new}} album, Reckless. [...] "Summer of '69" [...] was finished on January 25, 1984, co-written with Jim Vallance in his basement studio. The song went {{through a number of}} changes because neither Adams nor Vallance was convinced it was a strong enough song to be featured on the album. In their first draft, the lyric [...] "summer of '69" [...] appeared only once. At that time the two were planning to title it [...] "Best <b>Days</b> <b>of</b> <b>My</b> Life" [...] instead. While the lyric [...] "Best <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> life" [...] appeared seven times in the first draft, on the final draft it had been replaced by [...] "summer of '69" [...] and appeared only two times throughout the song.|$|E
500|$|Filming for {{exterior}} scenes set in {{the country}} began on February 15, 1939 in Sologne and outside the Chateau de la Ferté-Saint-Aubin. Renoir later said he chose Sologne because his father Pierre-August Renoir [...] "regretted {{that he had never}} been able to paint [...] How well I understand the sincerity of those regrets before these beautiful landscapes of Sologne, in astonishing colors, of a grace so melancholy yet so gentle." [...] Renoir said Sologne's mist [...] "took me back to the happy <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> childhood." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1929, the {{building}} became vacant, {{and was given}} to Prince Edward, Prince of Wales, by his father, King George V. The king had originally expressed surprise at Edward's request asking him [...] "What could you possibly want that queer old place for? Those damn weekends I suppose", but then smiled and gave his permission. Edward's previous residence had been York House, part of St. James's Palace in London, which he had thought [...] "more an office than a home." [...] He would later write that he [...] "created a home at the fort just as my father and grandfather had created one at Sandringham... here I spent some of the happiest <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> life." ...|$|E
500|$|Prior to his death, Kaliokalani {{seemed to}} have been working as an {{interpreter}} in the Police Court with Charles Coffin Harris, a New England lawyer who later became a leading politician in the Kingdom. During his world tour in 1881 and upon learning of Harris's death, Kalākaua, who had also received his first instruction in law under Harris, wrote to their sister Liliʻuokalani reminiscing about their elder brother and his work as an interpreter: [...] "I feel it [...] the more when I recall the <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> childhood and that of our brother James Kaliokalani, who was our first instructor in Law and remained with him as assistant interpreter of the Police Court for two years".|$|E
500|$|The Christian {{element of}} the album was most obvious in the hymn-like [...] "Word on a Wing", though for some {{commentators}} religion, like love, was simply another way for the Duke to [...] "test his numbness". Bowie himself has claimed that in this song, at least, [...] "the passion is genuine". When performing it live in 1999, the singer described it as coming from [...] "the darkest <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> life... I'm {{sure that it was}} a call for help". The closing ballad, [...] "Wild Is the Wind", was the album's sole cover, and has been praised as one of the finest vocal performances of Bowie's career. Bowie was inspired to record it after he met singer/pianist/songwriter Nina Simone (whose version is on the eponymous 1966 album).|$|E

500|$|In 1977 Larwood {{attended}} the Centenary Test match at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, {{along with many}} survivors of old Ashes battles. As on similar past occasions {{he had to be}} persuaded to go; later he would describe it as [...] "one of the best <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> life". His presence created considerable interest among generations of cricket followers to whom the bodyline series was distant history. [...] Later that year he visited England, and watched England's cricketers play Australia at Trent Bridge, his old home ground; this was one of several trips he made to his home country, the last of which was in 1980. In 1982, the 50th anniversary of the bodyline series was commemorated with much publicity, some of which brought a revival of hate mail and hostility towards Larwood.|$|E
500|$|The four {{officers}} were {{taken aback by}} Taylor's searing words and felt they had been humiliated. A decade after the incident, Kỳ described Taylor as [...] "the sort of man who addressed people rather than talked to them", referencing the confrontation. Karnow said [...] "For the sake of their own pride, they [...] resented being treated in ways that reminded them of their almost total dependence on an alien power. How could they preserve a sense of sovereignty when Taylor, striving to push them into 'getting things done', behaved like a viceroy?" [...] However, Thi also took a perverse pleasure in riling Taylor. He was seen by a CIA officer soon after, grinning. When asked why he was happy, Thi said [...] "Because {{this is one of}} the happiest <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> life...Today I told the American ambassador that he could not dictate to us." [...] Nevertheless, Taylor's conduct had rankled the officers, stirring their latent sense of nationalism and anti-Americanism; Khánh would exploit this to strengthen his fragile position in the junta.|$|E

It's {{about one of}} the most horrible <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> life when I got dropped from my first record label and it's the story of what happened that day." [...] A second preview of the music video, shot in a dance studio, premiered on November 25, 2011. Gaga told Vanity Fair magazine that the video is [...] "autobiographical" [...] and illustrates [...] "the worst day of my life." [...] The entire video premiered on December 1, 2011 on E! Online at 8.00 pm EST. However, the video appeared online several hours before its official release. Gaga took her Twitter to express dissatisfaction with the leak of the video, saying that it was [...] "like an old tampon." [...] The video for the song is 13minutes long.|$|E

500|$|The deposal {{prompted}} US Ambassador Maxwell D. Taylor to angrily berate Thiệu, Thi, Kỳ and Cang in {{a private}} meeting and threaten to cut off aid {{if they did not}} reverse their decision. Although nettled by the outburst, Thi took a perverse pleasure in riling Taylor. He was seen by a CIA officer soon after, grinning. When asked why he was happy, Thi said [...] "Because {{this is one of the}} happiest <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> life...Today I told the American ambassador that he could not dictate to us." [...] The dispute escalated for a few days as the junta threatened to expel Taylor, and Khanh went on a media offensive. A CIA informant reported that the arguments with Taylor had incensed the volatile Thi so much he privately vowed to [...] "blow up everything" [...] and [...] "kill Phan Khac Suu, Trần Văn Hương and Nguyen Khanh and put an end to all this. Then we will see what happens." [...] However, the dispute galvanized the officers' nationalist sentiments and they rallied around the embattled Khánh for a time. They ignored Taylor's threats without suffering repercussions because the Americans were too intent on defeating the communists to cut funding in an attempt to force policy change in Saigon. Thi became notorious for his involvement in infighting. A CIA dossier compiled in the 1960s said that Thi [...] "is like a card player, placing his bets now on this leader, then on another; he plays his subordinates in the same manner. His only real objective is to continue the game." [...] Time described him as [...] "vain, ambitious, an inveterate intriguer". The New York Times described him as [...] "a coup specialist".|$|E
