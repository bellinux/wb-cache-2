50|$|In 1844, the French chemist Adolphe Wurtz {{synthesised}} copper hydride for {{the first}} time. This reaction consisted of the reduction of copper sulfate with <b>hypophosphorous</b> <b>acid.</b> In 2011, Panitat Hasin and Yiying Wu {{were the first to}} synthesise a metal hydride (copper hydride) using the technique of sonication.

Hydrogen telluride (H2Te) and hydrogen selenide (H2Se) are both borderline hydrides of high volatility that produce strong, unpleasant odors.|$|E
5000|$|Though {{dating back}} to the {{discovery}} of the drug, the Nagai route did not become popular among illicit manufacturers until 1982, and comprised 20% of production in Michigan in 2002. It involves red phosphorus and hydrogen iodide (also known as hydroiodic acid or iohydroic acid). (The hydrogen iodide is replaced by iodine and water in the [...] "Moscow route".) The hydrogen iodide is used to reduce either ephedrine or pseudoephedrine to methamphetamine. On heating, the precursor is rapidly iodinated by the hydrogen iodide to form iodoephedrine. The phosphorus assists in the second step, by consuming iodine to form phosphorus triiodide (which decomposes in water to phosphorous acid, regenerating hydrogen iodide). Because hydrogen iodide exists in a chemical equilibrium with iodine and hydrogen, the phosphorus reaction shifts the balance toward hydrogen production when iodine is consumed (see Le Châtelier's principle). In Australia, criminal groups have been known to substitute [...] "red" [...] phosphorus with either <b>hypophosphorous</b> <b>acid</b> or phosphorous acid (the [...] "Hypo route"). This is a hazardous process for amateur chemists because phosphine gas, a side-product from in situ hydrogen iodide production, is extremely toxic to inhale. The reaction can also create toxic, flammable white phosphorus waste. Methamphetamine produced in this way is usually more than 95% pure.|$|E
50|$|Wurtz's first {{published}} paper was on <b>hypophosphorous</b> <b>acid</b> (1841), and {{the continuation of}} {{his work on the}} acids of phosphorus (1845) resulted in the discovery of sulfophosphoric acid and phosphorus oxychloride, as well as of copper hydride. But his original work was mainly in the domain of organic chemistry. Investigation of the cyanic ethers (1848) yielded a class of substances which opened out a new field in organic chemistry, for, by treating those ethers with caustic potash, he obtained methylamine, the simplest organic derivative of ammonia (1849), and later (1851) the compound ureas. In 1855, reviewing the various substances that had been obtained from glycerin, he reached the conclusion that glycerin is a body of alcoholic nature formed on the type of three molecules of water, as common alcohol is on that of one, and was thus led (1856) to the discovery of the glycols or diatonic alcohols, bodies similarly related to the double water type. This discovery he worked out very thoroughly in investigations of ethylene oxide and the polyethylene alcohols. The oxidation of the glycols led him to homologues of lactic acid, and a controversy about the constitution of the latter with Adolph Wilhelm Hermann Kolbe resulted in the discovery of many new facts and in {{a better understanding of the}} relations between the oxy- and the amido-acids. In 1855, he published work on what is now known as the Wurtz reaction.|$|E
