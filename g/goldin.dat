5|$|On the day {{following}} the meeting, Shea offered his resignation, becoming instead a special advisor to Daniel <b>Goldin.</b> NASA {{reported that he}} had resigned due to health reasons. However, The Scientist offered a different interpretation, quoting sources who speculated that the bluntness of his speech, including criticisms of <b>Goldin,</b> may have been controversial in NASA circles.|$|E

5|$|Initially sold {{at auction}} for $1.62M in 2008, the 'Jumbo Wagner' was {{featured}} by <b>Goldin</b> Auctions in their 2013 Winter Auction, which closed on April 5, 2013. Historical price increases {{and the state}} of the sports collectible market contributed to projections that the auction could set a new overall price record for the sale of a T206 Honus Wagner. The card ultimately sold for $2,105,770.50, including the buyer's premium, a record price for a baseball card in a public auction.|$|E

5|$|After these incidents, the US Congress and NASA {{considered}} {{whether to}} abandon the programme {{out of concern for}} the astronauts' safety, but NASA administrator Daniel <b>Goldin</b> decided to continue. The next flight to Mir, STS-86, carried David Wolf aboard Atlantis. During the orbiter's stay, Titov and Parazynski conducted a spacewalk to affix a cap to the docking module for a future attempt by crew members to seal the leak in Spektrs hull. Wolf spent 119 days aboard Mir with the EO-24 crew and was replaced during STS-89 with Andy Thomas, who carried out the last US expedition on Mir. The EO-25 crew arrived in Soyuz TM-27 in January 1998 before Thomas returned to Earth on the final Shuttle–Mir mission, STS-91.|$|E
5|$|The agency's leader, NASA's administrator, is {{nominated}} by the President of the United States {{subject to approval}} of the US Senate, and reports {{to him or her}} and serves as senior space science advisor. Though space exploration is ostensibly non-partisan, the appointee usually is associated with the President's political party (Democratic or Republican), and a new administrator is usually chosen when the Presidency changes parties. The only exceptions to this have been: James C. Fletcher, appointed by Republican Richard Nixon but stayed through May 1977 into the term of Democrat Jimmy Carter; Daniel <b>Goldin,</b> appointed by Republican George H. W. Bush and stayed through the administration of Democrat Bill Clinton; and Robert M. Lightfoot, Jr., associate administrator under Democrat Barack Obama kept on as acting administrator by Republican Donald Trump. Though the agency is independent, the survival or discontinuation of projects can depend directly on the will of the President.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, eight-year-old Victoria becomes {{upset that}} her mother Nikki Newman (Melody Thomas Scott) has married Jack Abbott (Peter Bergman), even after he saves her from {{drowning}} in a swimming pool. When she continues to misbehave, her parents send her to boarding school in Switzerland. The following year, Victoria returns as a moody teenager who is working in the mailroom at her father’s company, Newman Enterprises, and becoming smitten with the Ryan McNeilwho is older than her. Victor offers Ryan money to leave town but he and Victoria elope. Their marriage ends when Ryan leaves her for Nina Webster in 1993. Victoria then {{falls in love with}} Cole Howard and they marry the following year, but their marriage is quickly annulled when it is believed by their parents that they are siblings. When this is proved untrue they wed again; this marriage breaks down four years later when in 1998 Cole has sex with Ashley Abbott. Victoria becomes pregnant with Cole’s child and chooses to raise it with Neil Winters. Her baby girl, Eve Howard, dies a few days after birth and Victoria ends her union with Neil. Victoria briefly tries and fails to win Cole back from Ashley. In 1999, Victoria meets Gary Dawson (Ricky Paull <b>Goldin)</b> and they begin dating, though she soon discovers that he is stalking her and ends the relationship. Enraged, Gary kidnaps Victoria in a tree house and she takes months to recover. She and Ryan then reunite and plan to remarry, but on their wedding day in November 2001 Ryan's ex-wife Tricia Dennison shoots and kills him, leaving Victoria devastated. She then has a brief relationship with Diego Guittierez in 2002, and afterward dates Michael Baldwin. The following year, some of Victor's crimes come to light and Victoria leaves town when these and other family problems overwhelm her. She moves to Florence, Italy, where she studies Art History.|$|E
25|$|<b>Goldin</b> married Laura Belle Dunwiddie in 1881. The {{couple had}} one son, Herbert D. <b>Goldin,</b> in 1884. Laura died in 1911, and <b>Goldin</b> married Sarah J. Murphy in 1929.|$|E
25|$|Beginning with {{a letter}} to the editor {{published}} in the Janesville Daily Gazette in 1886, <b>Goldin</b> began to publish his version of the Battle of Little Big Horn, in which he castigated Major Marcus Reno and praised General George A. Custer. <b>Goldin</b> claimed that Custer gave him a last message to be carried to Reno, shortly before Custer was killed. <b>Goldin</b> also campaigned to be awarded the Medal of Honor for his role in the Battle of Little Big Horn, writing to Captain Frederick Benteen and speaking to Lieutenant Luther Hare in person. In 1896 Joseph Doe, a fellow Wisconsin politician and Mason, and also Assistant Secretary of War, found that there was sufficient evidence for approval of a Medal of Honor for <b>Goldin.</b>|$|E
25|$|As {{the years}} went by, <b>Goldin</b> embellished {{his role in the}} battle more and more. The height of {{embellishment}} is found in a chapter in the book Northwestern fights and fighters by Cyrus Townsend Brady. In addition to his claims of carrying Custer's last dispatch, <b>Goldin</b> claimed he joined the Seventh Cavalry in 1873, witnessed the death of Lt. Benjamin Hodgson, and was present for a discussion of strategy between Captain Myles Keogh and General Custer. When others challenged his claims, <b>Goldin</b> claimed that Brady had distorted his letter.|$|E

25|$|<b>Goldin</b> {{also took}} part in the Battle of Bear Paw in September and October 1877. He was {{discharged}} from the Army on November 13, 1877 for having enlisted under false pretenses, after his parents appealed to the Army for his discharge.|$|E
25|$|<b>Goldin</b> {{enlisted in}} the U.S. Army on April 8, 1876, lying about his age. (His year of birth is thus often {{incorrectly}} listed as 1855.) He {{was assigned to the}} 7th U.S. Cavalry. Less than three months later, Goldin's regiment fought in the Battle of Little Bighorn.|$|E

25|$|In 1945, Finkelstein {{hired the}} theologian Abraham Joshua Heschel, {{who had been}} {{teaching}} {{for a brief period}} at Hebrew Union College.

25|$|Claudia <b>Goldin,</b> among others, {{argue that}} this new {{contraceptive}} technology was {{a key player in}} forming women's modern economic role, in that it prolonged the age at which women first married allowing them to invest in education and other forms of human capital as well as generally become more career-oriented. Soon after the birth control pill was legalized, there was a sharp increase in college attendance and graduation rates for women. From an economic point of view, the birth control pill reduced the cost of staying in school. The ability to control fertility without sacrificing sexual relationships allowed women to make long term educational and career plans.|$|E
25|$|After divorcing Mitch, Felicia was {{reunited with}} her old flame, Lucas Castigliano (John Aprea). Lucas hunted Felicia {{down in an}} attempt to find their daughter, {{who turned out to be}} none other than Felicia's enemy, Lorna Devon (Alicia Coppola). Lorna had gone behind the scenes at Felicia's talk show and {{switched}} the live footage with a pornographic videotape that Lucas and Felicia's adoptive daughter, Jenna Norris (Alla Korot), had unwittingly made. Felicia and Lucas ended up repairing their relationship with Lorna, but their time as a family was short-lived when Lucas was murdered. Meanwhile, Jenna found true love with rocker Dean Frame (Ricky Paull <b>Goldin).</b> Their happiness, and Dean's success as a rock star, was chronicled in the nighttime special, Summer Desire.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, a study (2000) {{conducted}} by economic experts Claudia <b>Goldin</b> from Harvard University and Cecilia Rouse from Princeton University shows that when evaluators of applicants {{could see the}} applicant's gender {{they were more likely}} to select men. When the applicants gender could not be observed, the number of women hired significantly increased. David Neumark, a Professor of Economics at the University of California, Irvine, and colleagues (1996) found statistically significant evidence of sex discrimination against women in hiring. In an audit study, matched pairs of male and female pseudo-job seekers were given identical résumés and sent to apply for jobs as waiters and waitresses at the same set of restaurants. In high priced restaurants, a female applicant's probability of getting an interview was 35 percentage points lower than a male's and her probability of getting a job offer was 40 percentage points lower. Additional evidence suggests that customer biases in favor of men partly underlie the hiring discrimination. According to Neumark, these hiring patterns appear to have implications for sex differences in earnings, as informal survey evidence indicates that earnings are higher in high-price restaurants.|$|E

500|$|The first Administrator of NASA was Dr. T. Keith Glennan; {{during his}} term he brought {{together}} the disparate projects in space development {{research in the}} US.

500|$|During the Rhodesian Cabinet {{meeting on}} the proposals, the judges were kept {{informed}} by the [...] "expression on Sir Hugh's face and from comments of increasing despair", <b>Goldin</b> later wrote; the Chief Justice [...] "spent the whole day in his chambers looking more anxious and despondent after each occasion on which he was smuggled into the Cabinet meeting to explain the meaning or effect of particular provisions". On 5 December 1966, when Beadle heard at Government House that Smith's ministers had rejected the terms, he stood [...] "as though pole-axed", Gibbs's Private Secretary Sir John Pestell recalled, and appeared close to collapse.

Beadle, <b>Goldin</b> and Macdonald rejected the state prosecution and unanimously overturned the conviction, ruling that Niesewand's reports had embarrassed the government but did not damage the Rhodesian state. [...] "Factual evidence as opposed to opinion was never given," [...] Beadle commented. The government promptly expelled Niesewand from Rhodesia.|$|E
