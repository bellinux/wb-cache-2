5|$|Following the {{rejection}} of the script, Roddenberry planned to convert his treatment into a novel. After his assistant Susan Sackett showed him the manuscript of a novel that actor Walter Koenig <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> type, Roddenberry sought Koenig's collaboration on The God Thing. Roddenberry had already produced 68 pages after working on it for a month when he handed it to Koenig, who added another 83 in two months. Roddenberry received the changes enthusiastically, but a few weeks later Sackett informed Koenig that the project had been abandoned. In his 1997 autobiography Warped Factors, Koenig stated that he still had copies of the work he had completed on the book.|$|E

500|$|The {{personal}} relationships of Michael Jackson {{have been the}} subject of public and media attention for several decades. He was introduced to the topic of sexual activity at age nine while a member of The Jackson 5. He and his brothers would perform at strip clubs, sharing the bill with female strippers and drag queens, and the sexual adventures of his brothers with groupies further affected Jackson's early life. The entertainer said his [...] "first real date" [...] was with the child actress Tatum O'Neal, when he was a teenager in the 1970s; he called her [...] "my first love - after Diana [...]" [...] The pair eventually [...] "cooled off" [...] and Jackson entered into a romance with model Brooke Shields in 1981. Although the relationship became largely platonic, Shields said there were times he <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> marry him. As they grew older, the two saw each other less.|$|E

[...] — a {{question}} that plays a prominent role throughout the game. Ravel is pleased with The Nameless One's answer because he offers his own thoughts; she claims she has killed many men in the past who, instead of giving their own answers, tried to guess what her answer might be. As the conversation progresses, Ravel explains that, in a past life, The Nameless One <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> make him immortal; however, the ritual she performed was flawed, causing him to lose his memory each time he died. She reveals that the mortality she separated from him was not destroyed, and that {{as long as he was}} alive, his mortality must still be intact. She does not know where his mortality is, but suggests that the fallen deva Trias might.|$|E
500|$|Andrew Garfield {{was given}} the role of Tommy, a well-meaning, rather dim young person who struggles {{to find a place}} in an {{environment}} which values imagination and creativity above all. He said of his character, [...] "There's a sense of anxiety that runs through these kids, especially Tommy, because he's so sensory and feeling and animalistic, that's my perspective of him." [...] Garfield was attracted to the film based on the existential questions the story expresses. He called the experience of being a part of Never Let Me Go a [...] "dream to come true". Garfield enjoys an opportunity to let loose with his roles. He said the scenes in which his character—unable to contain his frustration—erupts with a wail, was [...] "intense" [...] for him. [...] "I think those screams are inside all of us, I just got a chance to let mine out". Before shooting the film, he had read the screenplay and the book. In March 2009 Daily Variety reported that Knightley was signed to the project. Knightley admitted that she only agreed to appear in Never Let Me Go because co-star and friend Mulligan <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>to.</b> She portrays Ruth, a zealous, ambitious character who behaves manipulatively out of inner insecurity. When asked what she did and did not have in common with her character, Knightley said she was unable to relate to Ruth's situation of being involved in a love triangle.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Pitchfork Media, Matsoukas {{said that she was}} surprised with the professional standard of Rihanna's acting. The inspiration for Rihanna acting in the video came from when Matsoukas saw the clip for [...] "Man Down" [...] in April 2011; the director stated that she was taken aback at how Rihanna realistically re-enacted a rape scenario. Matsoukas described the process for choosing O'Shaughnessy as the male love interest, stating that Rihanna <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> find a man she could [...] "fake fuck" [...] while filming. The director said that she telephoned a boxer her friend had told her about, and asked him to make a tape of himself using the description of how the male love interest should act. When asked if any of the video was improvised, Matsoukas revealed that she would create a scenario and then it was left to Rihanna and O'Shaughnessy to elaborate upon what the director had given them. Matsoukas jokingly said that the scene in which O'Shaughnessy draws a tattoo on Rihanna's buttock cheek {{was not part of the}} video's treatment, and that O'Shaughnessy improvised it. Upon the video's release, multiple media outlets and music critics compared the content of the video to a reenactment of Rihanna and Brown's physical altercation. When asked about this, Matsoukas clarified that the video was not linked to Brown in any circumstance, and said, [...] " [...] doesn't even really look like Chris Brown to me." ...|$|E

Fisher (1900–86), known as King. The wedding was a private ceremony performed by United Methodist pastor Rev. Jack Grenfell and {{was the subject of a}} short story titled [...] "The 'Inside' Story" [...] written by Rev. Grenfell's wife, Dr. Clarine Coffin Grenfell, in her book Women My Husband Married, including Marian Anderson. According to Dr. Grenfell, the wedding was originally supposed to take place in the parsonage, but because of a bake sale on the lawn of the Bethel United Methodist Church, was moved at the last minute to the Elmwood Chapel, on the site of the Elmwood Cemetery in Bethel, in order to allow the event to remain private.|$|E

Minutes later, Fred entered the premises and asked Rose to accompany him on a date that evening; an offer she accepted. Shortly thereafter, Rose began a relationship with Fred, becoming a frequent visitor at the Lake House Caravan Park, and a willing childminder to Charmaine and Anna Marie, whom she noted were neglected and whom she initially treated with care and affection. On several occasions {{in the early days of}} their courtship, Rose would insist she and Fred take the girls on excursions to gather wild flowers.|$|E

So I knew they didn't want to publicize anything about me." [...] Perron then states that Lane [...] "says she was more offended by that myth than any slight to her as a dancer who worked 'painstaking' hours on the set. She says she's talked to her colleagues about 'how unfortunate it is that, as professional dancers, we work so hard, but people can actually believe that it's easy enough to do it in a year. That's the thing that bothered me the most.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|On August 7, 2006, {{state senator}} Joy Padgett {{announced}} that Ney was withdrawing his candidacy in the 2006 election, and that Ney and House Majority Leader John Boehner <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> run in his place. Later that day, Ney confirmed {{in an interview}} with the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review that he would not run for re-election to a seventh term, but intended to serve out his term until January 2007. About his future plans, Ney said [...] "I have some options in the nongovernment sector." [...] The Washington Post reported that Boehner met with Ney in early August [...] "to urge him to step aside, reminding him that with a son in college and a daughter nearing college age, he will need money. [...] If he lost his House seat for the party, Boehner is said to have cautioned, Ney could not expect a lucrative career on K Street to pay those tuition bills, along with the hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees piling up." [...] On August 14, 2006, Ney officially withdrew from the race. Because that occurred before August 19 (80 or more days before the election), Ohio Revised Code 3513.312 applied: [...] "the vacancy in the party nomination so created shall be filled by a special election". If Ney had waited until August 20, section 3513.31 of the Ohio Revised Code would have pertained: Ney's replacement in the November general election would be named by a district committee of the Ohio Republican party.|$|E
