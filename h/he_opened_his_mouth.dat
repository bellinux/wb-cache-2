25|$|During World War II, both Japanese {{military}} personnel, {{especially the}} Kempeitai, {{and the officers}} of the Gestapo, the German secret police, used waterboarding {{as a method of}} torture. During the Japanese occupation of Singapore, the Double Tenth Incident occurred. This included waterboarding, by the method of binding or holding down the victim on his back, placing a cloth over his mouth and nose, and pouring water onto the cloth. In this version, interrogation continued during the torture, with the interrogators beating the victim if he did not reply and the victim swallowing water if <b>he</b> <b>opened</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> to answer or breathe. When the victim could ingest no more water, the interrogators would beat or jump on his distended stomach.|$|E

I {{thought he was going to}} take a bite out of me so I lifted the veil I was wearing and had a stare-down with him and <b>he</b> <b>opened</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> and let out this huge roar. I got so frightened my heart fell in my shoe. When he finally walked away, the director yelled 'Cut' and I had to take a long breather. But I could really relate to the lion. I feel like in a past life I was a lion or a cat or something." ...|$|E
500|$|Bernthal was {{extremely}} comfortable with his character on set. [...] "The second <b>he</b> <b>opened</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> and started reading the scene, I {{knew it was}} him," [...] he said. [...] "There was no question. I saw Frank and I knew it. He's the guy. He's a wonderful actor, and he's going to kill it in this role." [...] Bernthal {{admitted that he had}} no prior knowledge of The Walking Dead. He reminisced that he reacted so [...] "organically" [...] to the script that he [...] "didn't want to be colored by anything else. When I did read the comic, I was shocked. Look, I'm not going to sit here and regret. One {{of the great things about}} doing TV versus film is to be surprised yourself, to not let where you're going color where you are." [...] The pilot episode's script was amongst several other scripts for proposed television pilots that Bernthal skimmed through; He felt that this script overshadowed the others. [...] " [...] pilot season, and I read everything that was out there. I still remember the day that I got this script. I told my agent that I'd be thrilled to be an extra in this, it's so good. It just blew the rest of them right out of the water." ...|$|E

2500|$|His {{indifferent}} manner vanished {{as soon as}} <b>he</b> <b>opened</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth.</b> [...] He {{went right}} to work. He turned up the cuffs of his shirt. [...] Next, he loosened his necktie, and soon after it he took it off altogether. [...] All the time, he was gaining upon his audience. [...] He soon had it as by a spell. [...] I never saw men more delighted. [...] He began to bubble out with humor. [...] For plain pungency of humor, {{it would have been}} difficult to surpass his speech. [...] The speech ended in a half-hour. [...] The bell that called to the steam cars sounded. [...] Mr. Lincoln instantly stopped. [...] ‘I am engaged to speak at Cambridge tonight, and I must leave.’ [...] The whole audience seemed to rise in protest. [...] ‘Go on! [...] Finish it!’ was heard on every hand. [...] One gentleman arose and pledged to take his horse and carry him across country. [...] But Mr. Lincoln was inexorable.|$|E

60|$|Some men, however, are decidedly bettered {{by being}} knocked down.
