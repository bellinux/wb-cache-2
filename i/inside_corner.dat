5|$|The {{interiors}} of each wing have separate uses. In {{the west wing}} is the baptistry, in the north is the main altar, the main entrance and a notary area, separated by <b>inside</b> <b>corner</b> walls made of chiluca stone and tezontle. Chiluca, a white stone, covers the walls and floors and the tezontle frames the doors and windows. At the crossing of the structure is an octagonal dome framed by arches that form curved triangles where they meet {{at the top of}} the dome. The principal altar is in the ornate Churrigueresque style and crafted by indigenous artist Pedro Patiño Ixtolinque. It was inaugurated in 1829.|$|E
5|$|The fortalice, {{or small}} fort, {{took the form}} of an {{enclosure}} castle, with a curtain wall protected by mural towers and a gate tower. It was constructed on land in the manor of Stoke Fleming, belonging to the Carew family, lent by them due to the threat of French attack, and was built around a pre-existing chapel to Saint Petroc on the site. It held catapults to attack enemy ships, and may also have been armed with early cannon and equipped with a chain to block the entrance to the harbour. It did not see active service, but may have deterred the original plans of the French and Breton attack force in 1404, which, under the command of Tanneguy du Chastel, landed at Slapton Sands instead, where they were then dispersed by the local militia. The Carew family subsequently built a family house in an <b>inside</b> <b>corner</b> of the fortalice.|$|E

500|$|The {{original}} {{house built}} in the 1850s is L-shaped. According to the architectural drawings made for the HABS, {{the bottom of the}} L is [...] north–south by [...] east–west. In 1935 the ground floor of this part of the house included the main door and entrance hall, living room, parlor, library, and stairs. The main entrance is on the west side, which has a porch [...] wide by [...] deep, supported by pairs of square pillars with stairs on the north, south, and west sides. The top of the L is [...] north–south by [...] east–west, and in 1935 the ground floor of the top of the L had the dining room, gun room, [...] "brush up room", toilet, stairs, and a passage to the 1913 addition. The <b>inside</b> <b>corner</b> of the L has a two-story covered porch along the south side, and an open terrace on the east side's ground floor. In 1935 the second story of the original house had four bedrooms and a bathroom in {{the lower part of the}} L and two bedrooms and a bath in the upper part, as well as two staircases and hallways.|$|E
2500|$|That said, the 2004 book {{opined that}} at third base, McGraw [...] "probably {{sometimes}} stood {{slightly in the}} path that runners wanted to take", to make it less likely they would score a run. [...] The book cites a 1948 statement by former Baltimore teammate Sadie McMahon that said, [...] "McGraw wouldn't give the bag to the base runner like they do today" [...] and also that he would [...] "stand on the <b>inside</b> <b>corner</b> and make the runner go around." ...|$|E
2500|$|A [...] "Sounds of the Game" [...] {{video was}} {{made during the}} Series by MLB Productions and played on TV {{a number of times}} since then. Kirk Gibson came to bat in the eighth inning with runners on second and third and the Tigers {{clinging}} to a 5–4 lead. Padres manager Dick Williams was shown in the dugout flashing four fingers (ordering an intentional walk), before San Diego reliever Goose Gossage summoned him to the mound. Anderson was seen and heard yelling to Gibson, [...] "He don't want to walk you!", and making a swing-the-bat gesture. As Anderson had suspected, Gossage threw a 1–0 fastball on the <b>inside</b> <b>corner,</b> and Gibson was ready. He launched a hard smash into Tiger Stadium's right field upper deck, effectively clinching the game and the series.|$|E

2500|$|Maddux was {{renowned for}} {{focusing}} on the outside corner. This approach was emphasized under former Atlanta Braves pitching coach Leo Mazzone. He would begin by throwing strikes with his fastball down and away, then expand the strike zone with his changeup—sometimes obtaining borderline strike calls from umpires simply {{on the strength of}} his reputation. In complement with this strategy, Maddux popularized a tactic of throwing his two-seam fastball off the plate inside to left-handed hitters, only to have the ball break back over the <b>inside</b> <b>corner</b> for a strike. Maddux said of that pitch, [...] "That was just my normal fastball that did that. ... I always had it. The pitch really started to work for me when I ... learned how to throw a cutter, it made that pitch more effective." ...|$|E
2500|$|Short {{radio waves}} reflect from curves and corners {{in a way}} similar to glint from a rounded piece of glass. The most {{reflective}} targets for short wavelengths have 90° angles between the reflective surfaces. [...] A corner reflector consists of three flat surfaces meeting like the <b>inside</b> <b>corner</b> of a box. The structure will reflect waves entering its opening directly back to the source. They are commonly used as radar reflectors to make otherwise difficult-to-detect objects easier to detect. Corner reflectors on boats, for example, make them more detectable to avoid collision or during a rescue. For similar reasons, objects intended to avoid detection will not have inside corners or surfaces and edges perpendicular to likely detection directions, which leads to [...] "odd" [...] looking stealth aircraft. [...] These precautions do not completely eliminate reflection because of diffraction, especially at longer wavelengths. [...] Half wavelength long wires or strips of conducting material, such as chaff, are very reflective but do not direct the scattered energy back toward the source. The extent to which an object reflects or scatters radio waves is called its radar cross section.|$|E

50|$|There are {{two common}} ways to fashion <b>inside</b> <b>corners.</b> One {{is to use}} a {{compound}} miter saw to cut the ends of the corner pieces along two axes simultaneously. The other, called coping, is a two step process, first to cut a simple miter and then to use a coping saw to undercut the miters.|$|R
50|$|One {{functional}} {{disadvantage of}} hexavalent chromium plating is low cathode efficiency, {{which results in}} bad throwing power. This means it leaves a non-uniform coating, with more on edges and less in <b>inside</b> <b>corners</b> and holes. To overcome this problem the part may be over-plated and ground to size, or auxiliary anodes may be used around the hard-to-plate areas.|$|R
60|$|Hanley, {{the fourth}} left-handed hitter, {{came up and}} Scott pitched {{to him as he}} had to the others--high fast balls over the <b>inside</b> <b>corner</b> of the plate. Reddy Ray's {{position}} was some fifty yards behind deep short, and a little toward center field. He stood sideways, facing two-thirds of that vacant outfield. In spite of Scott's skill, Hanley swung the ball far round into right field, but he hit it high, and almost before he actually hit it the great sprinter was speeding across the green.|$|E

I wouldn't say that to you, Peg, if I didn't feel it myself, honestly. I'd say for you to do your best. But I've sized up these State fellows, and they won't be able to touch you. Remember what I say. That's all." ...|$|E
60|$|Burr, the curly-haired {{leader of}} Herne's batting list, took his {{position}} {{to the left}} of the plate. Ken threw him an underhand curve, sweeping high and over the <b>inside</b> <b>corner.</b> Burr hit a lofty fly to Homans. Hill, the bunter, was next. For him Ken shot one straight over the plate. Hill let it go by, and it was a strike. Ken put another in the same place, and Hill, attempting to bunt, fouled a little fly, which Dean caught. Gallagher strode third to bat. He used a heavy club, stood right-handed over the plate, and looked aggressive. Ken gave the captain a long study and then swung slowly, sending up a ball that floated like a feather. Gallagher missed it. On the second pitch he swung heavily at a slow curve far off the outside. For a third Ken tried the speedy drop, and the captain, letting it go, was out on strikes.|$|E

The pavilion has a red rectangle on the upper left corner, representing the blood dropped by the bandeirantes, having inside a white circle and the map of Brazil in blue, being the color of strength. There are as well four yellow stars on the <b>inside</b> <b>corners</b> of the rectangle.|$|R
50|$|Too {{much water}} {{will result in}} {{segregation}} of the sand and aggregate components from the cement paste. Also, water that is not consumed by the hydration reaction may leave concrete as it hardens, resulting in microscopic pores (bleeding) that will reduce final strength of concrete. A mix with too much water will experience more shrinkage as excess water leaves, resulting in internal cracks and visible fractures (particularly around <b>inside</b> <b>corners),</b> which again will reduce the final strength.|$|R
60|$|Berne {{carefully}} {{stepped into}} the batter's box, {{as if he wanted}} to be certain to the breadth of a hair how close he was to the plate. He was there this time to watch the Rube pitch, to work him out, to see what was what. He crouched low, and it would have been extremely hard to guess what he was up to. His great play, however, was his ability to dump the ball and beat out the throw to first. It developed presently, that this was now his intention and that the Rube knew it and pitched him the one ball which is almost impossible to bunt--a high incurve, over the <b>inside</b> <b>corner.</b> There was no mistaking the Rube's magnificent control. True as a plumb line he shot up the ball--once, twice, and Berne fouled both--two strikes. Grudgingly he waited on the next, but it, too, was over the corner, and Berne went out on strikes. The great crowd did not, of course, grasp the finesse of the play, but Berne had struck out--that was enough for them.|$|E

50|$|Corrugated {{surfaces}} {{known as}} megamullions or oceanic core complexes measure 25 km along-axis and 10-15 km across. When found along other mid-ocean ridges such structures {{occur at the}} <b>inside</b> <b>corners</b> of ridge discontinuities, but at the FTFZ they occur {{on both sides of}} the ridge away from any non-transform discontinuities.These structures and ultramafic rocks outcropping on either side of the MAR (in contrast to other parts of the ridge) indicate considerably reduced magma supply near the FTFZ. Paradoxically, geochemical analyses of basalts near the FTFZ instead suggest an enriched mantle source and the presence of a mantle hotspot.|$|R

5000|$|Profly goaltenders {{tend to have}} {{an easier}} time [...] "skating" [...] on their knees, also known as the [...] "backside push", or the [...] "butterfly slide". This term {{describes}} where one leg is down, and one is up. The goaltender pushes with his/her leg up laterally from the heel, laterally toward the down leg. This allows for a slide from the up leg to the down leg without getting off the ice completely. If a goaltender is on the <b>inside</b> <b>corners</b> or if the pad faces as in non-progressed [...] "butterfly" [...] styles, the push results in a tendency to roll over onto one's chest and belly.|$|R

2500|$|The {{section of}} the {{mountain}} where Machu Picchu was built provided various challenges that the Incas solved with local materials. One issue was the seismic activity due to two fault lines. It made mortar and similar building methods nearly useless. Instead, the Inca mined stones from the quarry at the site, lined them up and shaped them to fit together perfectly, stabilizing the structures. Inca walls have many stabilizing features: doors and windows are trapezoidal, narrowing from bottom to top; corners usually are rounded; <b>inside</b> <b>corners</b> often incline slightly into the rooms; and outside corners were often tied together by [...] "L"-shaped blocks; walls are offset slightly from row to row rather than rising straight from bottom to top.|$|R
