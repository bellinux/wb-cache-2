50|$|The V251 {{connects to}} a mains power-supply unit via <b>DIN</b> <b>plugs</b> and a four-conductor cable (power, guitar output, organ output and common). The PSU in turn has {{individual}} amplifier outputs for guitar and organ.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} amplifier had {{so called}} <b>DIN</b> <b>plugs</b> (1958) as inputs, after 1960 they changed to jacks. The Beatles used this amp, rated at only 40W. Maybe they brought {{it with them}} when playing in Germany on the Reeperbahn? ...|$|R
50|$|Some {{versions}} of legacy consoles such as Sega's Master System, Genesis and Nintendo's SNES {{are capable of}} outputting RGB signals, and many older home computers (Amstrad CPC, later ZX Spectrum models, MSX, Commodore Amiga, Atari ST, BBC Micro and Acorn Archimedes, etc.) output RGB with composite sync suitable for SCART use, but most used varying non-standard <b>DIN</b> <b>plugs.</b> Standard-resolution arcade monitors use RGB signals with a composite sync, which is SCART-compatible.|$|R

50|$|It is also {{possible}} to connect some machines to certain electric typewriters {{for use as a}} printer (the typewriters are also able to be connected to PCs for this purpose, and the interface tends to be a standard RS-232 and/or <b>DIN</b> <b>plug),</b> and in some cases to access the typewriter's floppy or micro floppy drives.|$|E
50|$|It is now mainly {{found on}} older equipment, such as 16 mm movie projectors. The Becker radio {{found in many}} Mercedes-Benz {{automobiles}} uses this connector. The same connector is used on some LED lamps and halogen lamps to connect the bulb to the power supply. The two-pin <b>DIN</b> <b>plug</b> lacks the outer metal shell, so far less force is required to disconnect the plug accidentally. Worn two-pin speaker plugs often require only the slightest nudge to break contact. There are also three- and four-pin versions of this loudspeaker connector used for example by Bang & Olufsen.|$|E
5000|$|Power supply units' given {{names are}} often {{acronyms}} or abbreviations. [...] "NAPS" [...] stands for Naim Audio Power Supply, and its successor was called [...] "SNAPS", being short for Super Naim Audio Power Supply. [...] "Hi-Cap" [...] is an abbreviation for High Capacity Power Supply. Power supplies {{are connected to}} the preamps and amplifiers with a [...] "SNAIC" [...] - Super Naim Audio Interconnect Cable - terminated at both ends with <b>DIN</b> <b>plugs.</b>|$|R
50|$|In Germany, Perilex {{connectors}} {{have been}} standardised by DIN. The 16-ampere version is DIN 49445 (socket) and <b>DIN</b> 49446 (<b>plug)</b> and the 25-ampere version is DIN 49447 (socket) and <b>DIN</b> 49448 (<b>plug).</b> It did replace an earlier flat 4-pin connector (3 phases and neutral) that was standardized in DIN 49450 / DIN 49451. The earlier flat connector did {{continue to exist}} in East Germany - after German reunification, all machinery was required to be rebuilt to round connectors until 1998.|$|R
50|$|Naim's {{choice of}} {{connectors}} {{is part of}} its objective of achieving the Naim sound. Pre-amplifiers employ the BNC connector for phono inputs, as providing better impedance matching and earthing compared with RCA connectors. The DIN connector is also used in preference to the RCA connector for other inputs, as the DIN connectors help to ensure the equipment is properly earthed without multiple pathways that create hum-inducing earth loops and increase noise. Vereker noted that the cheapest RCA socketry was used with earlier designs as there was no sonic benefit to using the costlier <b>DIN</b> <b>plugs,</b> and that higher quality sockets were progressively substituted as systems improved. While Naim's practice of using DIN connectors has gained them fans and detractors alike, DIN sockets continue to be Naim's choice for line-level inputs, although some RCA inputs may be included, depending on the model.|$|R
50|$|The cover depicts {{connections}} with previous albums, {{which became a}} trend in Clearlight album covers from this point onward. On the cover of Clearlight Symphony, cables connect an electrical box to a head, with one cable leading off in the distance, over the horizon. On the cover of Forever Blowing Bubbles, the same cable comes over the horizon, and ends in a disconnected <b>DIN</b> <b>plug</b> lying in the grass, blowing bubbles. The grass {{appears to be a}} redrawing of the marijuana leaves from the back cover of Delired Cameleon Family, but are now just ordinary lawn grass.|$|E

5000|$|Although {{cassette}} {{tape was}} originally envisioned by IBM as a low-budget storage alternative, {{the most commonly}} used medium was the floppy disk. The 5150 was available with one or two 5-1/4" [...] floppy drives - with two drives the program disc(s) would be in drive A, while drive B would hold the disc(s) for working files; with one drive the user had to swap program and file discs into the single drive. For models without any drives or storage medium, IBM intended users to connect their own cassette recorder via the 5150's cassette socket. The cassette tape socket was physically the same <b>DIN</b> <b>plug</b> as the keyboard socket and next to it, but electrically completely different.|$|E
50|$|The Wasp was {{undoubtedly}} EDP's most famous product, distinctive for its black/yellow colour scheme and brittle construction. It was notorious for {{its lack of}} a mechanical keyboard; instead, it used flat conductive copper plates, hidden under a silk-screened vinyl sticker. This was claimed {{by some to be}} unreliable, unintuitive, and devoid of much of the expression present with a real keyboard. Despite these flaws, the Wasp was in fact fairly advanced technologically. It {{was one of the first}} commercially available synthesisers to adopt digital technology, which at the time was just beginning to become a standard. It also utilised a proprietary system for connecting several Wasp synthesisers together, predating the invention and standardisation of MIDI by several years. The digital interface should not, however, be confused with MIDI, even though similar <b>DIN</b> <b>plugs</b> are utilised (7-pin DIN instead of the 5-pin DIN which MIDI standardized to).|$|R
5000|$|Screw-locking {{versions}} of this connector have also been used in instrumentation, process control and professional audio. In North America this variant is often called a [...] "small Tuchel" [...] connector {{after one of the}} major manufacturers. Tuchel is now a division of Amphenol. Additional configurations up to 24 pins are also offered in the same shell size. A version with a bayonet locking ring was used on portable tape recorders, dictation machines and lighting dimmers and controls through the from the 1960's to the 1980's, an example of this is the microphone input connector and some others on the [...] "Report" [...] family of UHER (brand) tape recorders. The bayonet locking version is sometimes referred to by the trade name Preh. Belling Lee offered a version with a sprung-loaded collar which latched on insertion but required the collar to be pulled back to release the connector, similar to the LEMO B series connector. This connector was commonly referred to as the [...] "Bleecon", an example of its use is the Strand Tempus range of theatrical lighting dimmers and control desks. A version with a pushbutton latch similar to that on an XLR cable mounted socket was also available. Female connectors with screw-locking, Bleecon or bayonet latching features are compatible with standard <b>DIN</b> <b>plugs.</b>|$|R
50|$|Bi-directional {{data bus}} signal is {{available}} in SX-bus of the central unit. Standard connectors of SX bus are 5 pin <b>DIN</b> 45500 <b>plugs</b> and sockets. The topology of bus connections is free and Selectrix accessories can be connected together in closed circle, chained or daisy chain style. SX bus accepts any type of Selectrix accessories apart from system boosters. For connecting boosters to the central unit or to each other Selectrix systems have a dedicated PX-bus available. SX-bus signal of the first SX bus (in case the central unit {{has more than one}} SX bus available) {{is available in}} the track also and connected through two cables directly from central unit (or booster) to the track.|$|R
50|$|The use of NTSC coded {{color in}} S-Video systems {{completely}} eliminates the phase distortions. As a consequence, {{the use of}} NTSC color encoding gives the highest resolution picture quality (on the horizontal axis & frame rate) of the three color systems when used with this scheme. (The NTSC resolution on the vertical axis {{is lower than the}} European standards, 525 lines against 625.) However, it uses too much bandwidth for over-the-air transmission. The Atari 800 and Commodore 64 home computers generated S-video, but only when used with specially designed monitors as no TV at the time supported the separate chroma and luma on standard RCA jacks. In 1987, a standardized 4-pin <b>DIN</b> <b>plug</b> was introduced for S-video input with the introduction of S-VHS players, which were the first device produced to use the 4-pin plugs. However, S-VHS never became very popular. Video game consoles in the 1990s began offering S-video output as well.|$|E
5|$|Adaptors are {{available}} to allow connection of DIN regulators to yoke cylinder valves (A-clamp or yoke adaptor), and to connect yoke regulators to <b>DIN</b> cylinder valves. (<b>plug</b> adaptors and block adaptors) Plug adaptors are rated for 232/240 bar, and can only be used with valves which are designed to accept them. Block adaptors are generally rated for 200 bar, {{and can be used}} with almost any 200 bar DIN valve.|$|R
