50|$|A darkcutter or <b>dark</b> <b>cutter</b> is a carcass of beef {{that has}} been {{subjected}} to undue stress before slaughter, and is dark in color. Sometimes referred to as dark cutting beef, they have a dark color which makes the meat appear less fresh, making them undesirable to consumers. Darkcutters fetch a lower price than otherwise ordinary beef on the market. A darkcutter's eating quality is actually better because of the ability of the proteins to remain juicy.|$|E
40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} investigate biochemical factors that influence beef lean color and beef lean color stability. The first {{study was conducted to}} investigate biochemical traits contributing to lean color and lean color stability in dark cutting beef. The second study was conducted to evaluate the effects of mitochondrial functionality during electron transport on beef lean color stability in beef (n = 160). Beef carcasses exhibiting various levels of dark cutting were selected based on pH: (severe <b>dark</b> <b>cutter</b> SEDC; mean pH = 6. 50, n = 40), moderate <b>dark</b> <b>cutter</b> (MODC; mean pH = 6. 33, n = 40), mild <b>dark</b> <b>cutter</b> (MIDC; mean pH = 6. 09, n = 40), shady <b>dark</b> <b>cutter</b> (SHDC; mean pH = 5. 92, n = 40), and normal cohorts (mean pH = 5. 53; n = 160) from the same production lot and similar marbling. For both studies, strip loin subprimals were aged until 13 d postmortem, when longissimus lumborum steaks were cut for simulated retail display. Instrumental color attributes [lightness (L*), redness (a*), yellowness (b*), chroma and hue angle] were determined on d 0, 1, 4, 7, and 11 of simulated retail display. Overall color change from d 0 was calculated for d 1, 4, 7, and 11 of simulated retail display. Additional steaks were used for determination of electron loss from the electron transport chain utilizing succinate and glutamate as substrates, oxygen consumption, nitric oxide metmyoglobin reducing ability, glycolytic potential, mitochondrial abundance, myoglobin concentration and protein oxidation. The results from the first experiment suggested that greater electron loss is associated with decreased metmyoglobin reducing ability and, consequently, reduced beef lean color stability. The results from the second experiment suggested that dark cutting beef carcasses favored oxidative metabolism, and overall color stability was greater in dark cutting carcasses than cohort carcasses. Data from these experiments indicate that biochemical factors affect initial lean color attributes, as well as lean color stability attributes...|$|E
40|$|Dark {{cutting in}} beef {{carcases}} can represent a significant financial loss to processors and producers involved in direct marketing. In our study we valued dark–cutting downgrades {{to a loss}} of $ 100 to $ 150 per carcase since all such bodies had to be diverted away from their primary export market, and additional cattle had to be killed in their place. A supplier survey conducted in November 2000 documented the on-farm histories of 937 market-specific yearling cattle killed at the one meat plant over an 18 months period. This enabled the examination of on-farm records pertaining to the handling, treatments, grazing history and preparation for sale of turnoff lots that were then correlated to the number and percentage of <b>dark</b> <b>cutters.</b> By association we pinpointed a number of social and behavioural background factors that applied to the circumstances, such as handling issues, long pick-ups, purchased stock, mixed mobs and limited weaner training. Although not commonly observed, improving pasture conditions were a possible nutritional influence associated with less dark-cutting. In conclusion, we suggest that animal behavioural influences reported in this paper are worth managing in the lead up to processing. However the number of <b>dark</b> <b>cutters</b> was not considered to be high by industry standards for pasture fed cattl...|$|R

Cattle were fed to a constant fat thickneSs of 9 to 13 mm (target = 11 mm) over the 12 th rib as determined by periodic ultrasound measurements. Cattle were slaughtered in a commercial slaughter plant and stunned by captive bolt. Temperament rating {{had a significant effect}} on the incidence of borderline <b>dark</b> <b>cutters</b> which were downgraded by a USDA grader (P=O·Ol). Temperament score also had a significant effect on tenderness (P < 0 · 001) as evaluated by Warner-Bratzler Shear (WBS) force at day 14 post mortem. The calmest animals which stood still when restrained in a hydraulic squeeze chute had a mean WBS force of 2 · 86 ± 11 kg and cattle which became highly agi-tated and struggled violently during restraint averaged 3 · 63 ± 19 kg. Forty percent of these cattle had WBS force values which were over 3 · 9 kg which is a threshold value for acceptability in food service establishments.

40|$|The National Beef Quality Audit ? 2016 {{included}} in-plant {{cooler and}} instrument grading assessments to benchmark {{the current status}} of the fed steer and heifer beef industry in the United States. In-plant cooler assessments (n = 9, 106 carcasses) were conducted at 30 facilities across the United States. Approximately 10 percent of the day?s production were evaluated for USDA quality grade (QG) and yield grade (YG) factors. Frequencies of traits evaluated are as follow: steer (66. 5 %), heifer (33. 4 %) sex classes; native (81. 6 %), dairy-type (16. 3 %), and Bos indicus (1. 4 %) estimated breed types; and <b>dark</b> <b>cutter</b> (1. 9 %). Mean USDA YG factors were USDA YG (3. 1), adjusted fat thickness (AFT; 1. 42 cm), loin muscle (LM) area (89. 5 cm^ 2), hot carcass weight (HCW; 390. 3 kg), and kidney, pelvic, and heat fat (KPH; 1. 9 %). Frequency distribution of USDA YG were YG 1 (9. 6 %), YG 2 (36. 7 %), YG 3 (39. 2 %), YG 4 (12. 0 %), and YG 5 (2. 5 %). Mean USDA QG traits were USDA QG (Select^ 96), marbling (Small^ 70), overall maturity (A^ 64), lean maturity (A^ 55), and skeletal maturity (A^ 69). Frequency distributions of USDA QG were Prime (3. 8 %), Choice (67. 3 %), Select (23. 2 %), and lower score (5. 6 %). Marbling score distributions were Slightly Abundant or greater (0. 85 %), Moderate (7. 63 %), Modest (23. 54 %), Small (39. 63 %), Slight (23. 62 %), and Traces or less (0. 83 %) One week of instrument grading data were collected each month from 5 beef processing corporations encompassing 18 facilities beginning January 2016 through December 2016 to allow the evaluation of seasonal trends (n = 4, 544, 635 carcasses). Mean USDA YG factors were USDA YG (3. 1), AFT (1. 37 cm), LM area (88. 9 cm^ 2), HCW (393. 6 kg), and KPH (1. 9 %). Frequency distribution of USDA YG were YG 1 (9. 5 %), YG 2 (34. 6 %), YG 3 (38. 8 %), YG 4 (14. 6 %), and YG 5 (2. 5 %).

It {{was found that the}} pH value of longissimus dorsi was not significantly different among the 3 breeds (P> 0. 05), being reduced rapidly during the first 36 hours postmortem, and then stayed stable. The value was in the range that was considered to be normal. Conversely, the color values L*, a* and b* tended to increase and also stable at 36 hours postmortem, except that for LaiSind cattle at 48 hours. According to L* scale, the meat of Yellow and LaiSind cattle met the normal quality but the buffalo meat was considered to be <b>dark</b> <b>cutters.</b> The tenderness of longissimus dorsi was significantly different among the breeds (P< 0. 05).

40|$|Dark cutting is {{detrimental}} to meat quality and therefore {{is the major}} cause of carcass downgrades under the Meat Standards Australia grading system. This study quantified the variation between months {{in the incidence of}} dark cutting, in southern Australia. Four years of Meat Standards Australia grading data, from nine individual beef processors in Western Australia, South Australia, Victoria and Tasmania, was utilised for the analysis. The dataset contained 42162 slaughter groups, of 10 or more grass-fed cattle, which allowed for the percentage of <b>dark</b> <b>cutters</b> per slaughter group to be analysed. The interaction between month, year and state was significant (P < 0. 001). The lowest risk of dark cutting for South Australia and Western Australia was in October (1. 53 % ± 0. 75 and 6. 96 % ± 0. 76) and November in Tasmania and Victoria (7. 34 % ± 0. 9 and 5. 27 % ± 0. 81) potentially when feed availability and quality is highest. The incidence of dark cutting was highest for all states during the period from February to June. Lower pasture availability and quality in combination with higher levels of stress due to extreme high or low temperatures during this time could all contribute to the higher incidences. The findings of this study show that procurement and management decisions made by cattle buyers, producers and processors need to change throughout the year to help mitigate the incidence of dark cutting carcasses and reduce financial loss...|$|R
40|$|Two hundred eighty-eight {{predominantly}} British and British crossbred steers (702 lb) {{were used}} in a 2 × 3 factorially arranged experiment. Main effect factors were reimplant scheme [estradiol (E 2) vs estradiol plus trenbolone acetate (E 2 + TBA) ] and time on feed (111, 125 or 139 days). The initial slaughter occurred when 65 to 70 % of all steers were estimated to grade low Choice. No interactions occurred for any variable measured. Reimplanting 57 days after the initial implant with E 2 + TBA increased overall daily gain 6. 9 % (P<. 003) and feed efficiency 4. 9 % (P<. 005). Feeding steers for an additional 14 or 28 days resulted in linear decreases in overall daily gain (P<. 005) and feed efficiency (P<. 0004). Reimplanting with E 2 + TBA increased (P<. 001) carcass weight but did not reduce marbling score or percent Choice carcasses. Feeding steers for an additional 14 or 28 days resulted in linear increases (P<. 0001) in hot carcass weight, ribeye area, adjusted backfat (P<. 004), and skeletal maturity (P<. 0005).

Además, se registraron antecedentes sobre {{el comportamiento}} de los animales durante el viaje. Se utilizaron 20 novillos y 20 vaquillas Hereford y Angus de un mismo predio, de similar edad, peso y estado de gordura. Se utilizó un diseño {{experimental}} de bloques completos al azar según peso vivo y sexo, asignando 10 machos y 10 hembras a cada tratamiento: transporte prolongado con (n= 20) y sin descanso (n= 20). Los animales sin descanso fueron sometidos a un transporte continuo de 36 horas en camión desde el predio al matadero. Los animales con descanso fueron descargados, luego de 24 horas de viaje continuo, en una estación de descanso por un período de 8 horas, durante el cual se les ofreció agua y heno a discresión, completando después del descanso 12 horas más de transporte. Se utilizaron dos camiones de similar estructura, los que partieron simultáneamente del predio, uno con cada grupo; se usó una densidad de carga de 500 kg de peso vivo por 1 m². Se utilizó estadística descriptiva y un análisis de varianza para comparar los tratamientos con y sin descanso, y la prueba de Tukey para establecer si existían diferencias significativas entre ambos, con un nivel de significancia de 5 %. Las orientaciones más frecuentemente adoptadas por los bovinos durante el transporte fueron la perpendicular y la paralela a la dirección del movimiento. Se registraron 3 animales caídos en el grupo sin descanso y ninguno en el grupo con descanso. La pérdida de peso durante el transporte fue similar en ambos tratamientos, pero difirió durante el reposo en matadero, en donde el grupo sin descanso ganó en promedio 2, 2 kg, en tanto el grupo con descanso perdió 3, 5 kg; la pérdida total hasta el faenamiento fue similar (P 0, 05) en los animales con (10, 6 %) y sin descanso (9, 6 %). El peso y el rendimiento porcentual de la canal caliente fueron similares. Los bovinos sin descanso presentaron contusiones en mayor número y grado; los promedios de pH fueron altos en ambos grupos (con= 5, 8; sin= 5, 8) y el color del músculo post mortem medido objetivamente (Hunterlab) fue similar (P 0, 05). Sin embargo, se registraron más canales con pH sobre 6, 0 (5 vs 3) y 3 canales con corte oscuro a la vista en el grupo sin descanso. Se concluye que el transporte por 36 horas en camión tiene efectos negativos sobre la calidad de carne producida y que el descanso de 8 horas es benéfico en términos de menos animales caídos, menos contusiones en las canales, y menos canales con anomalías como corte oscuro, no observándose diferencias significativas en términos de pérdidas de peso ni rendimiento de canal. The {{effects of a}} resting period in cattle transported by road for 36 hours, on live weight changes, carcass yield, bruising, ph and colour of the meat postmortem were determined. Data on the behaviour of the cattle during transport were also recorded. The experiment was carried out with 40 Hereford and Angus steers and heifers produced by one farmer, of similar age, weight and fat cover. The experimental design consisted of random complete blocks according to live weight and sex, assigning 10 steers and 10 heifers to two treatment: long distance transport with (n= 20) and without a resting period (n= 20); the group without a resting period was transported from the farm to the slaughterhouse continuously by road for 36 hours; the other group was submitted to a resting period of 8 hours (offering water and hay ad libitum) after a journey of 24 hours and then completed 12 additional hours on the road after resting. Two lorries of similar structure were used and both groups, one in each lorry, left {{at the same time}} from the farm; a stocking density of 500 kg live weight per 1 m² was used. Descriptive statistics and analysis of variance were used to compare treatments with and without resting, and Tukey test to establish significancy of the differences, at a 5 % level. The most frequent orientations adopted by the cattle were perpendicular and parallel to the direction of the movement. Three fallen animals were found in the group without a resting period, and none in the rested animals. Both treatments had similar weight losses during transport, but animals without a rest gained 2. 2 kg during resting at the slaughterhouse whilst rested animals continued losing weight (3. 5 kg). Total mean losses were 10. 6 % in the rested and 9. 6 % in not rested animals (P 0. 05). No differences were found in terms of hot carcass weight and proportional yield respect to initial live weight on farm. The animals without a resting period had a higher number of and more severe bruises. The mean pH was high in both groups (5. 8 =with; 5. 8 =without rest) and the colour of muscle postmortem, as measured objectively (Hunterlab) was not affected by resting (P 0. 05). However, more carcasses of cattle without a rest period showed pH values higher than 6. 0 (5 vs 3) and three were found to be <b>dark</b> <b>cutters</b> in the same group. It is concluded that transport of cattle by lorry for 36 hours affects negatively the quality of meat produced and that a rest stop along these journeys improves aspects such as less fallen animals, less bruising and less <b>dark</b> <b>cutters,</b> but had no effect in terms of live and carcass weight losse...|$|R

One percent of the annual number of cattle processed in Canada were evaluated on the processing floor and 0. 1 % were graded in the cooler. Brands were observed on 37 % and multiple brands on 6 % of the cattle. Forty percent of the cattle had horns, 20 % of which were scurs, 33 % were stubs, 10 % were tipped, and 37 % were full length. Tag (mud and manure on the hide) was observed on 34 % of the cattle. Bruises were found on 78 % of the carcasses, 81 % of which were minor in severity. Fifteen percent of the bruises were located on the round, 29 % on the loin, 40 % on the rib, 16 % on the chuck, and 0. 02 % on the brisket. Grubs were observed in 0. 02 % of the steers, and injection sites were observed in 1. 3 % of whole hanging carcasses. Seventy percent of the livers were passed for human food and 14 % for pet food; 16 % were condemned. Approximately 71 % of the liver condemnations were due to liver abscesses. Four percent of the heads, 6 % of the tongues, and 0. 2 % of whole carcasses were condemned. The pregnancy rate in female cattle was approximately 6. 7 %. The average hot carcass weight was 357 kg (s = 40) in steers, 325 kg (s = 41) in heifers, 305 kg (s = 53) in cows, 388 kg (s = 62) in virgin bulls and 340 kg (s = 39) in mature bulls. The average ribeye area in all cattle was 84 cm 2 (s = 12); range 29 cm 2 to 128 cm 2. Grade fat was highly variable and averaged 9 mm (s = 4) for steers and heifers, 6 mm (s = 6) for cows, 5 mm (s = 1) for virgin bulls, and 4 mm (s = 0. 5) for mature bulls. The average lean meat yield was 59. 7 % in cattle (s = 3. 4); range 39 % to 67 %.

Approximately 0. 6 % {{of the number of}} cattle processed annually in Canada were evaluated. Brands were observed on 49 % and tag was observed on 43 % of the hides. Both brands and tag had increased from 1995. Seventy percent of the cattle were polled and 5 % had full horns; thus, the number of horned cattle had decreased from 1995. Bruises were found on 54 % of the carcasses, which was a decrease from 78 % in 1995. Sixty-eight percent of the bruises were minor, 28 % major, and 4 % critical in severity. The distribution of bruises on the carcass was 17 % on the chuck, 36 % on the rib, 30 % on the loin, and 16 % on the round. Grubs were observed on 0. 008 % of the carcasses, and surface injection site lesions were observed on 0. 2 % of the whole carcasses, a decrease from the 1. 3 % seen in 1995. Seventy-two percent of the livers were passed for human food and 14 % for pet food; 14 % were condemned. Approximately 64 % of the liver losses were due to abscesses. Five percent of the heads and tongues and 0. 3 % of the whole carcasses were condemned. The hot carcass weight was highly variable in all cattle, averaging 353 kg (s = 43). The average ribeye area was 90 cm 2 (s = 13). Both hot carcass weight and ribeye area had increased from 1995. The average grade fat was 9 mm (s = 5), ranging from 0 mm to 48 mm. Lean meat yield averaged 58. 8 % (s = 4. 6). One percent of the carcasses were devoid of marbling, 17 % were Canada A, 49 % were Canada AA, 32 % were Canada AAA, and 1 % were Canada Prime, which was an increase in marbling from 1995. <b>Dark</b> <b>cutters</b> were found in 1 % of all carcasses; 1 % of steers, 0. 5 % of heifers, 3 % of cows, and 14 % of bulls. Three percent of the carcasses were underfinished and 13 % were overfinished. The number of overfinished carcasses had increased from 1995. Stages, steers with bullish traits, were infrequently observed in 0. 5 % of the steers, and 0. 2 % of the steers and 0. 3 % of the heifers had poor conformation. Yellow fat was not observed in any steers or heifers, but it was found on 65 % of the cow carcasses. Only 0. 6 % of the heifers had an aged carcass, based on skeletal maturity. Based on August 1998 to July 1999 prices, it was estimated that the Canadian beef industry lost $ 82. 62 per head processed, or $ 274 million annually, from quality nonconformities, which was an increase from 1995.

40|$|An {{understanding}} of animal psychology combined with well designed facilities will reduce stress on {{both you and}} your cattle. Reducing stress is important because stress reduces the ability to fight disease and weight gain. The principles discussed in this book apply to all types of grazing animals. Stress increases weight loss, damages rumen function, and can interfere with reproduction. An animal 2 ̆ 7 s previous experiences will affect its stress reaction to handling. Cattle have long memories. Animals which have been handled roughly will be more stresses and difficult to handle in the future. Animals which are handled gently and have become accustomed to handling procedures will have very little stress when handled. The basic principle is to prevent cattle from becoming excited. Cattle can become excited {{in just a few}} seconds, but it takes 20 to 30 minutes for the heart rate to return to normal in severely agitated cattle. There is an old saying 2 ̆ 2 You can tell what kind of a stock man a person is by looking at the behavior of his cattle. 2 ̆ 2 In one feedlot survey, cattle form yards which had a reputation for rough handling were wilder and more difficult to handle at the packer. They also had more bruises and <b>dark</b> <b>cutters.</b> The degree of stress which will be induced by handling and restraint can vary from almost no stress in a tame show animal to very severe stress in a wild range cow. The degree of stress is determined by three major factors [...] 1) amount of contact with people, 2) quality of handling (rough vs. gentle) and 3) genetics. Frequent, gentle handling will reduce stress. Genetics is also an important factor. Some genetic lines of cattle are calmer and less likely to panic than others. Cattle with an excitable temperament will take longer to respond positively to gentle handling than cattle with a calm temperament. Most cattle will become less stressed and settle down when they are handled gently. However, there are a few individuals with a bad temperament that may never settle down and are dangerous to restrain and handle. Culling them is often advisable. Although painful procedures cannot be avoided, a reduction of agitation and excitement will still reduce stress. Cattle remember painful restraint methods such as nose tongs. Handling will be easier in the future if you use a halter to hold the heads and keep electric prod usage to an absolute minimum. If tail twisting has to be used to move a cow up a chute, let go of the tail when the cow makes one step forward to reward her for moving. The tail must be released the instant the cow steps forward, otherwise she will not make the association. Breeding cattle will quickly learn to move when their tail is touched. Timing is very important when using the principle of pressure and release. This principle is used in many situations where cattle, horses and other animals are handled and trained. If an animal is being taught to lead, one should let up and stop pulling when the animal takes one step forward. The principle is to give relief to reward the animal when it does what you want. When the horse stops, you should stop pulling on the bridle...|$|R
