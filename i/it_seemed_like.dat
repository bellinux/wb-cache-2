5|$|The {{day after}} Cleave's article {{appeared}} in the Evening Standard, Beatles press officer Tony Barrow offered Datebook, a US teen magazine, rights to all four interviews. Barrow believed the pieces were important to show fans that the Beatles were progressing beyond simple pop music and producing more intellectually challenging work. As Datebook was a socially progressive magazine that addressed subjects such as interracial dating and legalization of marijuana, <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> a suitable vehicle to carry this information.|$|E
5|$|The Windows {{version of}} the game had a more mixed reception, with {{criticism}} aimed mostly at the technical issues present {{at the time of}} the game's release, ultimately leading to sales being suspended. On June 23, 2015, the launch day for Arkham Knight, thousands of users reported major technical flaws and performance problems with the Windows {{version of the}} game, with some saying <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> the optimization phase of the game's development was skipped. Steam users immediately wrote scathing reviews of the game's performance, including reports of frame rate being capped at 30 frames per second (which could be raised, though with potential side effects) and dropping as low as 10 frames per second while gliding or using the Batmobile.|$|E

60|$|The {{room was}} chill {{and cold and}} gray. It had only two small windows. Its doors were low. Even Mrs. Field was forced to stoop in entering. This helped to make <b>it</b> <b>seem</b> <b>like</b> a den.

5|$|Solo {{was born}} in Richland, Washington on July 30, 1981 to Judy Lynn (née Shaw) and Jeffrey Solo. Her father, an Italian-American Vietnam War veteran, who {{was in and out}} of her life as a child and teenager, taught her how to play soccer at a young age. When Solo was seven, her father picked her and her brother Marcus up to go to a {{baseball}} game in the nearby city of Yakima, but ended up driving over three hours west to Seattle, where they stayed for several days at a hotel. Solo described how <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> a vacation at first, but soon realized it was not. Police later found them at a downtown bank and arrested Jeffrey for alleged kidnapping. Although her parents had divorced when she was six and she lived with her mother, Solo maintained a close relationship with her father after reconnecting with him during her college years at the University of Washington. He continued to be a major influence in her life until his death of a heart attack in June 2007.|$|E

Chang based these thoughts on a skull found in Sichuan and a skull found in Guangxi.|$|E

25|$|When Marissa {{finds out}} about Bianca helping JR {{with trying to}} win her back, she asks Bianca about. Bianca tells Marissa she did it because Bianca could not do all those things for Marissa herself. Another reason was because it looked like Marissa was {{falling in love with}} JR again and because <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> JR had changed. Marissa accuses Bianca of {{manipulating}} her and the situation. Bianca suggests that they should not see each other for a while and Marissa agrees.|$|E

In July, IndyMac went under and had to be placed in conservatorship.

Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were also put under conservatorship in early September.|$|E

25|$|When {{considering}} actors for {{the part}} of Spock, the producers of the film sent Nimoy video footage of each one.

Quinto, who previously had appeared as Sylar in the television series Heroes, had heard about the production on the new film and expressed his interest in a December 2006 interview with the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.|$|E

Chelsea, who O'Donnell said {{suffered}} from mental illness (but which Chelsea denied), was found a week later in Barnegat, New Jersey, with a 25-year-old man she met on Tinder. In a paid interview with the Daily Mail, Chelsea claimed that O'Donnell had kicked {{her out of the}} house, was smoking marijuana in the home, and that she had been mostly raised by nannies. Although <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> they reconciled, Chelsea revealed in an interview that they had another falling out and are not on speaking terms.|$|E
25|$|The Pacific Coast League, from 1952–1957, was {{the only}} minor league to obtain open classification. At this time, the major leagues only {{extended}} as far west as St. Louis and {{as far south as}} Washington, D.C. This classification severely restricted the rights of the major leagues to draft players out of the PCL, and at the time <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> the PCL would eventually become a third major league. The PCL would revert to Triple-A classification in 1958 due to increasing television coverage of major league games and in light of the Dodgers and Giants moving to Los Angeles and San Francisco, respectively. The open classification no longer exists in the major league rules.|$|E

The reality of the situation was that I hadn’t been playing very long at all, and I probably could have spent {{the same amount of time}} learning to play right handed. I did have a go at it, but I just didn’t have the patience. It seemed impossible to me. I decided to make do with what I had, and I made some plastic fingertips for myself.

25|$|Trevor Hoffman came on {{to try to}} {{earn the}} save in the ninth. After {{inducing}} two groundouts back to himself, <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> Hoffman, who, at the time, was second all-time in career saves, would finally send the American League to a loss in an All-Star Game {{for the first time}} in a decade. However, Paul Konerko hit a single to left past third baseman Miguel Cabrera, and was pinch-run for by José Lopez. Troy Glaus hit a ground rule double down the left field line, forcing Lopez to hold at third. While it looked like the National League received a break (as Lopez could have possibly scored the tying run if the ball stayed in play), Hoffman allowed a two-strike triple to Michael Young, who went on to win the MVP, scoring Lopez and Glaus and putting the AL up 3–2.|$|E
25|$|After a {{hot start}} to the season, the Stars {{dominated}} {{the first half of}} the season, staying on the Pacific Division lead and staying in the top three spots of the conference. <b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> the old Stars were back, as through {{the first half of the}} season, they went 30–15–6. But after the All-Star Game, the Stars went into a slump, going on numerous losing streaks and blowing games. Through this though, the Stars still remained in the playoff picture. On the day of the trade deadline, the Stars traded James Neal and Matt Niskanen to the Pittsburgh Penguins for defenseman Alex Goligoski. After an awful second half, the Stars still had a chance to make the playoffs by winning all their games in April. They won all of them except for last, as they lost to the Minnesota Wild 5–3, costing them a playoff spot.|$|E

25|$|Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode an A- grade, saying: What’s most {{striking}} about “No Sanctuary,” {{apart from its}} attempts at thematic resonance, is how quickly and brutally the question of Terminus is resolved. If you’d asked me beforehand, I would’ve guessed {{that it would take}} {{at least a couple of}} episodes before Rick and the others could free themselves. I wouldn’t have been exactly excited about that, because the longer you stay in a community full of murderous cannibals without any major character being killed, the more the tension just drips away, but <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> a reasonable assumption to make, especially when taking into consideration how tricky it was going to be to build the rest of the season. Without the prison home base or an obvious major villain (goodbye, the Governor), we need something to create structure—a group of psychos who harvest human flesh seems like too good a concept to dispose of immediately.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} argued the {{attitude}} of the East towards innovation is one of the other factors that might have played a big role in the West's advancements over the East. According to David Landes, after a few centuries of innovations and inventions, <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> the East stopped trying to innovate and began to sustain what they had. They kept nurturing their pre-modern inventions and did not move forward with the modern times. China decided to continue a self-sustaining process of scientific and technological advancement {{on the basis of their}} indigenous traditions and achievements. The East’s attitude towards innovation showed that they focused more on experience, while the West focused on experimentation. The East did not see the need to improve on their inventions and thus from experience, focused on their past successes. While they did this, the West was focused more on experimentation and trial by error, which led them to come up with new and different ways to improve on existing innovations and create new ones.|$|E
25|$|It's {{revealed}} that four days earlier, Jack West {{escaped from the}} Pit in the Ethiopian mine, rescued Pooh Bear from sacrifice and freed the Jewish slave-miners. In gratitude, the miners give him the sacred stones that Wolf had been using them to dig for - the Twin Tablets of Thutmosis, which contain the final incantation to activate the Machine when all the pillars are placed. Jack and Pooh travel to their old farm in Kenya, finding Horus (Jack's falcon) and the Adamson twins waiting; they'd come to the farm because <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> the best isolated safe place. They share with Jack {{the news that the}} Brotherhood has a mole in Wolf's unit, a marine code-named Switchblade, who plans to sabotage Wolf's effort to place the Second Pillar. Jack and the Adamsons head to Zanzibar, where an old friend of Jack's is hiding out, making a career after deserting the US army to attack gun-runners in Africa. Pooh leaves them at the airport to go north and rescue Stretch from the Mossad's torture chambers. Before he leaves, Jack gives him a GPS locator with which to signal Jack if he needs help.|$|E
