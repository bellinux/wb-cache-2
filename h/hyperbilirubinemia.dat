5|$|The first {{reported}} poisonings resulting in death from {{the consumption of}} A.bisporigera were from near San Antonio, Mexico, in 1957, where a rancher, his wife, and three children consumed the fungus; only the man survived. Amanita poisoning {{is characterized by the}} following distinct stages: the incubation stage is an asymptomatic period which ranges from 6 to 12 hours after ingestion. In the gastrointestinal stage, about 6 to 16 hours after ingestion, there is onset of abdominal pain, explosive vomiting, and diarrhea for up to 24 hours, which may lead to dehydration, severe electrolyte imbalances, and shock. These early symptoms may be related to other toxins such as phalloidin. In the cytotoxic stage, 24 to 48 hours after ingestion, clinical and biochemical signs of liver damage are observed, but the patient is typically free of gastrointestinal symptoms. The signs of liver dysfunction such as jaundice, hypoglycemia, acidosis, and hemorrhage appear. Later, there is an increase in the levels of prothrombin and blood levels of ammonia, and the signs of hepatic encephalopathy and/or kidney failure appear. The risk factors for mortality that have been reported are age younger than 10 years, short latency period between ingestion and onset of symptoms, severe coagulopathy (blood clotting disorder), severe <b>hyperbilirubinemia</b> (jaundice), and rising serum creatinine levels.|$|E
25|$|Severe {{prenatal}} {{deficiency of}} GH, as occurs in congenital hypopituitarism, has {{little effect on}} fetal growth. However, prenatal and congenital deficiency can {{reduce the size of}} a male's penis, especially when gonadotropins are also deficient. Besides micropenis in males, additional consequences of severe deficiency in the first days of life can include hypoglycemia and exaggerated jaundice (both direct and indirect <b>hyperbilirubinemia).</b>|$|E
25|$|Neonatal {{jaundice}} is {{the other}} chief complication {{that leads to the}} basal ganglia damage associated with this condition. Jaundice is caused by <b>hyperbilirubinemia,</b> or abnormally high levels of bilirubin in the blood. Bilirubin is usually bound to albumin immediately and sent to the liver. However, in neonatal jaundice, the concentration of bilirubin overwhelms that of albumin and some of the bilirubin remains unconjugated and can enter the brain through the blood–brain barrier. Normally bilirubin {{would not be able to}} diffuse across the blood–brain barrier, but in infants, the barrier is immature and has higher permeability. Bilirubin is toxic as it prevents the phosphorylation of many proteins, including synapsin I which binds vesicles in the presynaptic terminal. Therefore, it directly inhibits the exocytosis of neurotransmitters and severely hinders the synapses it affects. In autopsies of children who suffered from neonatal jaundice, chronic changes of neuronal loss, gliosis and demyelination were observed in the basal ganglia and more specifically within the globus pallidus.|$|E
25|$|Unconjugated {{hyperbilirubinaemia}} in {{a newborn}} {{can lead to}} accumulation of bilirubin in certain brain regions (particularly the basal nuclei) with consequent irreversible damage to these areas manifesting as various neurological deficits, seizures, abnormal reflexes and eye movements. This type of neurological injury is known as kernicterus. The spectrum of clinical effect is called bilirubin encephalopathy. The neurotoxicity of neonatal <b>hyperbilirubinemia</b> manifests because the blood–brain barrier has yet to develop fully, and bilirubin can freely pass into the brain interstitium, whereas more developed individuals with increased bilirubin in the blood are protected. Aside from specific chronic medical conditions {{that may lead to}} hyperbilirubinaemia, neonates in general are at increased risk since they lack the intestinal bacteria that facilitate the breakdown and excretion of conjugated bilirubin in the faeces (this is largely why the faeces of a neonate are paler than those of an adult). Instead the conjugated bilirubin is converted back into the unconjugated form by the enzyme β-glucuronidase (in the gut, this enzyme is located in the brush border of the lining intestinal cells) and a large proportion is reabsorbed through the enterohepatic circulation.|$|E
500|$|Individuals who are {{homozygous}} for {{a specific}} mutation (K404E) or compound heterozygous with a null allele in CPOX have a more severe erythropoietic porphyria, harderoporphyria, characterized by neonatal jaundice, <b>hyperbilirubinemia,</b> hepatosplenomegaly and skin lesions upon exposure to ultraviolet light. [...] HCP is a rare disease, but the exact incidence {{is difficult to determine}} due to the reduced penetrance of the acute porphyrias. [...] Overall, the incidence of all porphyrias is estimated at 1:20,000 in the United States. [...] The incidence of harderoporphyria is even lower, with less than 10 cases reported worldwide.|$|E

2500|$|Bilirubin encephalopathy, {{also known}} as kernicterus, is the {{accumulation}} of bilirubin in the grey matter of the central nervous system. The main accumulation targets of <b>hyperbilirubinemia</b> are the basal ganglia, ocular movement nucleus, and acoustic nucleus of the brainstem. Pathogenesis of bilirubin encephalopathy involves several factors, including the transport of bilirubin across the blood-brain barrier and into neurons. Mild disruption results in left cognition impairment, while severe disruption results in ADCP. Lesions caused by accumulation of bilirubin occur mainly in the global pallidus and hypothalamus. Disruption of the blood-brain barrier by disease or a hypoxic ischemic injury can also contribute to an accumulation of bilirubin in the brain. Bilirubin encephalopathy leading to cerebral palsy has been greatly reduced by effective monitoring and treatment for <b>hyperbilirubinemia</b> in preterm infants. [...] As kernicterus has decreased due to improvements in care, over the last 50 years the proportion of children developing athetoid CP has decreased. Usually normal intelligence and 40% will have IQ over 100.|$|E
