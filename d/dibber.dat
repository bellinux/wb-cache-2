40|$|Context. The unknown {{identity}} of the diffuse interstellar band (<b>DIB)</b> carriers poses {{one of the longest}} standing unresolved problems in astrophysics. While the presence, properties, and behaviour of hundreds of optical <b>DIBs</b> between 4000 Å and 9000 Å have been well established, information on <b>DIBs</b> in both the ultra-violet and near-infrared (NIR) ranges is limited. Aims. In this paper, we present a spectral survey of the NIR range, from 0. 9 μm to 2. 5 μm. Our observations were designed to detect new <b>DIBs,</b> confirm previously proposed NIR <b>DIBs,</b> and characterise their behaviour with respect to known line-of-sight properties (including the optical <b>DIBs</b> present in our spectra). Methods. Using the X-Shooter instrument mounted on the ESO Very Large Telescope (VLT) we obtained medium-resolution spectra of eight known <b>DIB</b> targets and one telluric reference star, from 3000 Å to 25 [*] 000 Å in one shot. Results. In addition to the known 9577, 9632, 10 [*] 780, 11 [*] 797, and 13 [*] 175 Å NIR <b>DIBs,</b> we confirm 9 out of the 13 NIR <b>DIBs</b> that were presented by Geballe et al.

We obtained high-resolution (R= 28, 300) spectra of 25 early-type stars with color excesses of 0. 07 <E(B-V) < 3. 4. In addition to the five <b>DIBs</b> previously detected in this wavelength range, we identified 15 new <b>DIBs,</b> 7 of which were reported as <b>DIB</b> "candidates" by Cox. We analyze the correlations among NIR <b>DIBs,</b> strong optical <b>DIBs,</b> and the reddening of the stars. Consequently, we found that all NIR <b>DIBs</b> show weaker correlations with the reddening rather than the optical <b>DIBs,</b> suggesting that the equivalent widths of NIR <b>DIBs</b> depend on some physical conditions of the interstellar clouds, such as UV flux. Three NIR <b>DIBs,</b> λλ 10780, 10792, and 11797, {{are found to be}} classifiable as a "family," in which the <b>DIBs</b> are well correlated with each other, suggesting that the carriers of these <b>DIBs</b> are connected with some chemical reactions and/or have similar physical properties such as ionization potential.

40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} study of the spatial {{distribution}} of the λ 6613 ˚A <b>DIB</b> carrier in the Perseus OB 2 association based on high resolution observations toward lines of sight representing different interstellar environments. We determined that in the studied region, the λ 6613 ˚A <b>DIB</b> carrier is concentrated in two distinct clouds with velocities of 1. 4 (± 0. 4) and 12. 0 (± 0. 9) km s − 1. We compared the λ 6613 ˚A <b>DIB</b> carrier’s velocity with the Na i velocity distribution derived from our survey measurements, as well as with CO, OH, H i and Ca ii measurements from the literature. We conclude that the behaviour of the carrier of the λ 6613 ˚A <b>DIB</b> follows the overall expansion motion of the gas in the association. The <b>DIB</b> velocity is directly linked to that of Ca ii and H i. The <b>DIB</b> total column density is proportional to the total column density of Ca ii and H i making those atoms good tracers of the λ 6613 ˚A <b>DIB</b> carrier. Those new results support the assumption that the λ 6613 ˚A <b>DIB</b> would arise from a gas phase molecule, possibly single-ionized (Sonnentrucker et al. 1997). We also conclude that the <b>DIB</b> carrier is distributed in shell structures over the whole association. We finally show from the <b>DIB</b> velocity structure that the <b>DIB</b> carrier, gas and dust are well mixed toward the association but that the <b>DIB</b> shells have an angular extent twice larger than that of the dust...|$|R
