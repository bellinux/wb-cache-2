Such role includes the ethical commitment to facilitate learning processes, removing barriers to adult students’ entry and persistence in higher education. This paper describes the implementation of <b>flexible</b> learning <b>pathways</b> in a technology and industrial management graduate course targeted at adult students. Findings confirm that adult students welcome <b>flexible</b> learning <b>pathways</b> and choose the pathways that better suit their needs. Despite academic background differences success rates are adequate and similar for different learning pathways, showing that adult students are capable of bridging the gaps in their academic development.

40|$|A {{general and}} {{scalable}} method {{has been developed}} for patterning nanometer scale lines hierarchically over large areas using nanowires as masks for etching and deposition. Core−shell nanowires with controlled diameter and shell dimensions were aligned with nanometer to micrometer scale pitches using a Langmuir−Blodgett approach and then transferred en mass to planar substrates. Transferred nanowires were used as deposition masks to define metal lines with pitches from the nanometer to micrometer scale over centimeter square areas. Hierarchical parallel nanowire arrays were also prepared and used as masks to define nanometer pitch lines in 10 × 10 ím 2 arrays repeated with a 25 ím array pitch over centimeter square areas.

40|$|Social impact, {{defined as}} an effect on society, culture, quality of life, {{community}} services, or public policy beyond academia, is widely considered as a relevant requirement for scientific research, especially {{in the field of}} health care. Traditionally, in health research, the process of knowledge transfer is rather linear and one-sided and has not recognized and integrated the expertise of practitioners and those who use services. This can lead to discrimination or disqualification of knowledge and epistemic injustice. Epidemic injustice is a situation wherein certain kinds of knowers and knowledge are not taken seriously into account to define a situation. The purpose of our article is to explore how health researchers can achieve social impact for a wide audience, involving them in a non-linear process of joint learning on urgent problems recognized by the various stakeholders in public health. In participatory health research impact is not preordained by one group of stakeholders, but the result of a process of reflection and dialog with multiple stakeholders on what counts as valuable outcomes. This knowledge mobilization and winding pathway embarked upon during such research have the potential for impact along the way as opposed to the expectation that impact will occur merely {{at the end of a}} research project. We will discuss and illustrate the merits of taking a negotiated, discursive and <b>flexible</b> <b>pathway</b> in the area of community-based health promotion...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In 1997, the {{academic}} requirement for Chartered Engineer (CEng) status {{was raised to}} a Masters Degree or equivalent. This has increased the pressure to develop a range of different provision at this level as alternatives to full-time education. Since 2006, the Engineering Council has worked {{with a number of}} universities and professional engineering institutions (PEIs) to develop flexible MSc Professional Engineering programmes as pathways to professional qualification. The model of provision adopted integrates the work-based development of Masters level knowledge and understanding with the development of the skills and competence required for CEng status. This paper presents the findings of the interim evaluation of the ‘Gateways to the Profession ’ project, initially funded by the then Department of Education and Science (DfES), and includes feedback from each stakeholder group through questionnaires and interviews. Overall, the responses have been positive and appear to confirm a high level of interest in this type of <b>flexible</b> <b>pathway,</b> as well as highlighting a number of areas that merit further investigation. Whilst {{the academic}} content and relevance of the programme is critical to all stakeholders, the quality assurance and administrative infrastructure have proved to be equally important, since the development of documentation that would be acceptable to a range of professional and academic organisations and enable professional accreditation {{at some point in the}} future is pivotal for the overall success of the programme...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} approaches {{towards the}} synthesis of some carbocyclic analogues of nucleosides and nucleaotides starting from the bicyclic lactam 1. The first compound considered was the analogue of cyclic adenosine diphosphate ribose 2. A crucial step {{in one of the}} retrosynthetic analyses involved conversion of a primary amine into a different functionality via a nucleophilic displacement of an amine derivative. Using a range of simple model compounds, attempts were made to achieve such a displacement via formation of a diazonium salt, a ditosyl imide or a pyridinium salt. Many side reactions such as elimination or rearrangement had taken place rather than nucleophilic substitution at the carbon bearing the amine derivative. These results led to the conclusion that this approach is not a suitable strategy to consider for further investigations into {{the synthesis of}} carbocyclic nucleotide analogues. The development of a new synthetic route towards carbocyclic thymidine 3 is described in chapter 3. Its synthesis was successfully performed in 8 steps via a linear approach which consisted of the construction of the thymine moiety on the carbocyclic cyclopentylamine 4. The amine 4, was made via a <b>flexible</b> <b>pathway</b> which also could be adapted to give a wide range of carbocyclic sugar analogues. In addition, enantiomerically pure (+) -thymidine analogue 3 was prepared from (-) 1 according to the strategy developed for the racemic series, and then converted into the phosphoramidite derivative 5. This monomer will be used to prepare hybrid DNA strands and then to undertake some biological studies on the stability compared to that of the natural DNA...|$|E

40|$|What is {{practice}} based assessment? Performance based assessment (ie. {{what the}} candi-date can demonstrate in the exam setting) has formed {{an integral part}} of the assessment process for general practice for many years. Practice based assessment (PBA) uses performance based assess-ment methods such as videotaped consultations and direct observation in the doctor’s own clinical setting to ‘measure what doctors can do in actual profes-sional practice’. 1 Practice based assessment was specif ical ly designed to suit the needs of doctors who were eligi-ble for The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) examination via the practice eli-gible route, but who did not wish to sit the examination. Both PBA and the RACGP examination are measured against the same competency stan-dard: ‘competent to practice unsupervised general practice in Australia’. 2 Practice based assessment is designed for doctors who are working in active general practice, and is open to doctors wishing to undertake assessment via the practice eligible route and/or candidates who are currently fully enrolled in the NCEPMC Alternative Pathway Program (Table 1). Practice based assessment is run twice a year and can be completed over a 6 or 12 month period. Successful candidates can apply for Fellowship of the RACGP as long as other administrative requirements are fulfilled. Background to PBA In December 1998, the RACGP Council resolved that a working group be formed to action a proposal for a more <b>flexible</b> <b>pathway</b> to RACGP Fellowship. It was this working group that researched and developed the original PBA. The pilot of this new program was con-ducted nationwide in 2000 with 12 participants and included: • portfolio including cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) that has been assessed within the past 12 months • patient feedback (Doctor’s Interpersonal Skills Questionnaire – DISQ) • peer review • viva examination (1. 5 hours), and • videotaped consultat ions of 35 hours duration.

40|$|Ribosomes are the {{universal}} ribonucleoprotein organelles that translate the genetic message from mRNA to protein. In prokaryotes, the ribosomal subunits are 30 S and 50 S subunit, which bind together during the translation process forming 70 S ribosome. The ribosome {{is a highly}} dynamic structure, and acts as a working platform for the different factors {{involved in the process}} of converting the genetic information into protein. Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) is an emerging imaging technology that combines the potential of three-dimensional (3 D) reconstruction at molecular resolution with a close-to-native preservation of the specimen. Here, we have applied this method to reconstruct rifampicin-treated Escherichia coli individual 30 S subunits in vitro and in situ, and individual 50 S subunits in situ. In the 30 S subunit, the head, the platform and the body show large conformational movements relative to each other. The particles are grouped into three conformational groups according to the width/height ratios. Also, an S 15 fusion protein derivative {{has been used as a}} physical reporter to localize S 15 in the 30 S subunit. In the 50 S subunit, the L 1 stalk, the L 7 /L 12 stalk, the central protuberance (CP), and the peptidyl transferase center (PTC) cleft are the most dynamic and flexible parts in the reconstructed structures with clear movements indicated. Different locations of the tunnel in the central cross-sections through the in situ 50 S subunits indicate a <b>flexible</b> <b>pathway</b> inside the large subunit. In addition, gross morphological changes were also been observed in our reconstructions. Our results demonstrate a considerable conformational flexibility among individual ribosomal subunits, both in vitro and in situ. Translation is an essential process for all cells and organisms. Translation initiation is the rate-limiting step and the most highly regulated phase of translation process. Several regions along the mRNA have been reported to influence translation initiation. The Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence located 5 - 9 bases upstream of the initiation codon supports translation initiation by complementary binding to the Anti-Shine-Dalgarno (ASD) sequence on the 16 S rRNA. We have here compared how an SD+ sequence influences gene expression, if located upstream or downstream of an initiation codon. The positive effect of an upstream SD+ is confirmed. A downstream SD+ gives decreased gene expression. If an SD+ is placed between two potential initiation codons, initiation takes place predominantly at the second start site. The first start site is activated if the distance between this site and the downstream SD+ is enlarged and/or if the second start site is weakened. Upstream initiation is eliminated if a stable stem-loop structure is placed between this SD+ and the upstream start site. The results suggest that the two start sites compete for ribosomes that bind to an SD+ located between them. A minor positive contribution to upstream initiation resulting from 3 ’ to 5 ’ ribosomal diffusion along the mRNA is suggested. Since the location of SD+ or SD-like sequences can strongly influence gene expression, this should be of significant evolutionary importance...|$|E

Technical and vocational and university graduates are increasingly more prepared for entry-level jobs than those who complete general education, but basic skills and life skills are still lacking.
