25|$|One toponym {{with a good}} {{claim to}} {{derivation}} from the saint's name is Chadkirk Chapel in Romiley, Greater Manchester, which {{dates back to the}} 14th century– although the site is much older, possibly dating back to the 7th century when it is believed St Chad visited to bless the well there. Cameron points out that -kirk toponyms more frequently incorporate the name of the dedicatee, rather than the patron, so there is <b>every</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> Chadkirk really was dedicated to St Chad in the Middle Ages. It is not so certain that Chadsmoor in Staffordshire, Chadwich in Worcestershire, or Chadwick in Warwickshire, were named after the saint.|$|E

25|$|Analysis of {{the wreck}} could not {{determine}} whether the escape hatch was workable from the inside. Analysts theorise that the men may have rejected risking the escape hatch {{even if it were}} operable, and would have preferred to wait for a submarine rescue ship to attach itself to the hatch. The sub was relatively close to shore {{and in the middle of}} a large naval exercise. The sailors had <b>every</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> rescue would arrive quickly. Using the escape trunk was risky. The sailors were in a compartment that was initially at surface atmosphere pressure, so they did not risk decompression sickness ('the bends') if they used the rescue hoods to ascend to the surface. But the Arctic water was extremely cold and they could not survive long in the water. Also, water was slowly seeping into the ninth compartment, increasing the atmospheric pressure and thus the risk of decompression sickness and death when they ascended to the surface. In addition it was likely that some of the men were seriously injured and escape would have been very difficult for them.|$|E

They included $14,531 a month to his mother, $12,363 a month to his fiancée and two daughters, and $3,500 a month to Taylor. Creditors challenged Vick's spending plan given his loss of salary and suspension from the NFL.

500|$|More {{controversial}} {{than the}} distribution of commendations was the debate over Bridport's decision {{to withdraw from the}} battle while the remainder of the French fleet was still within reach. In his official dispatch, the British admiral wrote that [...] "If the Enemy had not been protected and sheltered by the Land, I have <b>every</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> a much greater Number, if not all the Line of Battle ships, would have been taken or destroyed", going on note that [...] "When the ships struck, the British squadron was near to some Batteries , and in the Face of a strong Naval Port [...] [...] His subsequent concern for the Quiberon expeditionary convoy also demonstrates that he considered its protection his principal duty. But in the opinion of French admiral Kerguelen, [...] "S'ils avaient bien manouevré, ils auraient pu, ou prendre tous nos vaisseaux, ou les faire périr à la côte" [...] (If [...] had manouevred successfully they could have taken all of our vessels, or made them perish on the coast). Historians have considered this view and most agree that Bridport's retirement was premature: In 1827 James noted that the scattered remains of the French fleet could easily have been attacked by the unengaged British rear with the advantage of the weather gage, while William Laird Clowes wrote in 1901 that [...] "We may be pretty sure that had a Nelson, a Hawke or even a Boscawen commanded on the occasion, the fleet of Villaret would have been annihilated." [...] Twenty-first-century historians Noel Mostert and Richard Woodman have compared Groix with the battles of Genoa and Hyères fought during in the year in the Mediterranean, where in similar circumstances another elderly admiral, William Hotham, had also allowed scattered and retreating French fleets to escape when they might have been destroyed.|$|E

2500|$|General Lafayette's {{visit to}} America in 1824-1825 {{inspired}} {{the citizens of}} Easton. A group of 200 citizens traveled to Philadelphia on Wednesday, September 22 to meet Lafayette. Porter engaged in a positive exchange with Lafayette about Porter's family legacy and stories of war. Enlightened, Porter traveled to Norwich University and Dartmouth College, where he first got the idea to establish a college in Easton. Despite previous efforts to establish educational institutions in the borough, Porter advocated Easton's ability to sustain a college, saying that, [...] "Easton was 'rich and flourishing' in men, in location, in resources, and in prospects.

He relayed news from Salzburg, Munich, and Vienna to divert her, did his best to organize the maintenance of her fortepiano, paid for Wolfgang's music to be copied and arranged for her to receive it; collected musicians together when she had visited him so that she could play it with most of the parts; [...]. tried to look after her health; and encouraged her to stand up to her husband when he was being unreasonable."
