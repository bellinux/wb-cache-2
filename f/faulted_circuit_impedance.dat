50|$|Two {{types of}} wiring {{protection}} are standard thermal breakers and arc <b>fault</b> <b>circuit</b> breakers. Thermal breakers require an overload condition {{long enough that}} a heating element in the breaker trips the breaker off. In contrast, arc <b>fault</b> <b>circuit</b> breakers use magnetic or other means to detect increases in current draw much more quickly. Without such protection, visually detecting arc faults in defective wiring is very difficult, as the arc fault occurs {{in a very small}} area. A problem with arc <b>fault</b> <b>circuit</b> breaker is {{they are more likely to}} produce false positives due to normal circuit behaviors appearing to be arc faults. For instance, lightning strikes on the outside of an aircraft mimic arc faults in their voltage and current profiles. Research has been able to largely eliminate such false positives, however, providing the ability to quickly identify and locate repairs that need to be done.|$|R

40|$|Fault {{location}} and distance protection are essential smart grid technologies ensuring {{reliability of the}} power system. This paper describes an accurate algorithm for locating faults on double-circuit transmission lines. The proposed approach is capable of identifying the <b>faulted</b> <b>circuit</b> of a parallel transmission line by checking the estimated fault {{location and}} fault resistance. Voltage and current measurements from {{only one of the}} terminals of the faulty line are used. No pre-fault data are required for the estimation. The lumped parameter line model considering shunt capacitance is utilized for the derivation of the algorithm. It’s assumed that line parameters are known and transmission lines are fully transposed. The method is applicable to all types of faults. It’s evinced by evaluation studies that the proposed algorithm can correctly determine the <b>faulted</b> <b>circuit</b> in most cases. For exceptional cases, the current waveforms during the fault can be used to help identify the <b>faulted</b> <b>circuit.</b> The proposed algorithm generates quite accurate fault location estimates, and may be suitable for distance relaying...|$|R

40|$|An {{analytical}} method is presented {{for determining the}} potential impact that the connection of a single new generator may have upon {{the performance of a}} transmission system under balanced three-phase fault conditions. Expressions are derived that demonstrate the dependence of the system-wide fault behaviour of the modified network upon both the sub-transient or short <b>circuit</b> <b>impedance</b> of the new generator/transformer and the configuration of the original network. From these expressions sensitivity factors are developed that characterise the potential impact that the connection of the new generator can have upon network fault behaviour. The procedure is derived in general terms and verified with results from simulation of a 17 -bus test system. The results emphasize that the impact of the generator/transformer is often more contingent upon the network characteristics at the point of connection rather than the subtransient/ short <b>circuit</b> <b>impedances</b> of the new elements...|$|R

5000|$|As {{the main}} Miller theorem, besides helping circuit {{analysis}} process, the dual version {{is a powerful}} tool for designing and understanding circuits based on modifying impedance by additional current. Typical applications are some exotic <b>circuits</b> with negative <b>impedance</b> as load cancellers, capacitance neutralizers, Howland current source and its derivative Deboo integrator. In the last example (see Fig. 1 there), the Howland current source consists of an input voltage source VIN, a positive resistor R, a load (the capacitor C acting as impedance Z) and a negative impedance converter INIC (R1 = R2 = R3 = R and the op-amp). The input voltage source and the resistor R constitute an imperfect current source passing current IR through the load (see Fig. 3 in the source). The INIC acts as a second current source passing [...] "helping" [...] current I−R through the load. As a result, the total current flowing through the load is constant and the <b>circuit</b> <b>impedance</b> seen by the input source is increased. As a comparison, in a load canceller, the INIC passes all the required current through the load; the <b>circuit</b> <b>impedance</b> seen {{from the side of the}} input source (the load impedance) is almost infinite.|$|R
