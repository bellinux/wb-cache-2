500|$|... "Deuces" [...] {{was written}} by Chris Brown, Michael [...] "Tyga" [...] Stevenson and Kevin McCall, who also {{produced}} the track. Vocals were recorded by Michael Congdon at the In Your Ear Studios in Richmond, Virginia, with assistance by Dustin Faltz. The recordings were later mixed by Brian Springer at The Record Plant in Los Angeles, California, with assistance by Anthony Taglianett. [...] "Deuces" [...] leaked online on May 20, 2010, and was later released digitally on June 25, 2010 as the first single from Brown's collaborative mixtape with Tyga, Fan of a Fan (2010). In an interview with MTV News, Tyga elaborated on [...] "Deuces" [...] and its theme, stating: [...] "Basically it's about you getting rid of this girl, you {{tried to make it}} work, but you <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> on. So you put up one finger, put up another, and then 'Deuces. The song appeared as the opening track on Brown's fourth studio album, F.A.M.E. (2011).|$|E

500|$|After {{the high}} ratings for [...] "A Study in Pink", the BBC was {{reportedly}} eager {{to produce more}} episodes. On 10 August 2010, {{it was confirmed that}} Sherlock had been renewed for a second series. At the 2011 convention, Gatiss confirmed which stories would be adapted, and that the writers of the first series would each write an episode for series two. Acknowledging that [...] "A Scandal in Bohemia", [...] "The Hound of the Baskervilles" [...] and [...] "The Final Problem" [...] are amongst the best-known Holmes stories, Gatiss explained, [...] "We knew after having a successful first run that the natural order would be to do three of the most famous [...]" [...] "There's {{the question of how to}} go out on a cliffhanger and then the thematic things of the three stories, where we were trying to get to and what Sherlock and John's relationship is a little further on. You can't just go back to: 'You have no emotions.' 'I don't care.' You've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> on somewhere and make sure the other characters have something of a journey too." [...] Paul McGuigan directed the first two episodes, and Doctor Who director Toby Haynes handled the last one. The second series of three 90-minute episodes was initially planned to air in late 2011, but was delayed until early January 2012.|$|E

It's one of the most enjoyable experiences that you can have. But the point is: You've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> on ... I'm still a senator from the state of Arizona.

2500|$|An early 1996 Q {{magazine}} interview {{revealed that}} relations between Blur members had become very strained; journalist Adrian Deevoy {{wrote that he}} found them [...] "on {{the verge of a}} nervous breakup". Coxon, in particular, began to resent his bandmates and, in a rejection of the group's Britpop aesthetic, made a point of listening to noisy American alternative rock bands such as Pavement. Albarn grew to appreciate Coxon's tastes in lo-fi and underground music, and recognised the need to significantly change Blur's musical direction once again. [...] "I can sit at my piano and write brilliant observational pop songs all day long but you've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> on", he said, and decided to let Coxon have more creative control over their new album. Albarn visited Iceland during this period, stating that, [...] "I used to have a recurring dream, as a child, of a black sand beach. And one hazy, lazy day , I was watching the TV and I saw a programme about Iceland, and they had black beaches. So I got on a plane, and booked into the Saga hotel. I didn't know it meant Saga holidays, for older people—I thought it was Saga as in Nordic sagas. But it was actually an OAP cruise hotel. I was on my own: I didn't know anybody. I went into the street, Laugavegur, where the bars are, and that was it." ...|$|E

50|$|The AM {{transmitter}} allowed CBM to {{be heard}} across most of {{the eastern half of}} North America at night, including much of Eastern Canada.
