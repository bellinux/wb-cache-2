Additionally, fungal biomasses are susceptible to engineering improvements and regeneration of their capabilities. With regard to organic pollutants, excessive nutrients and dyes, fungi can remove them from wastewaters, leading to a decrease in their toxicities. However, the detoxification rates seem {{to be dependent on}} media and culture conditions. The postreatement by anaerobic bioprocesses of effluents that have been pretreated with fungi can lead to higher biogas than the original effluents. In addition to the degradation of organic pollutants, fungi produce added-value products such as enzymes (LiP, MnP, Lacc, amylase, etc.) and single-cell protein (SCP). Most research on fungal capacities to purify polluted effluents has been performed on a laboratory scale, hence {{there is a need to}} extend such research to pilot scale and to apply it to industrial processes...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{order to}} monitor the {{polymerisation}} process of an <b>industrial</b> <b>resin,</b> a study by infrared fiber evanescent wave spectroscopy has been carried out. To design the optical fiber, a special glass composition has been optimized in the Se-Sb-Ge-Ga vitreous quaternary system. This glass exhibits a large transparency in the mid-infrared range, and shows a temperature-viscosity behaviour that enables the preparation of optical fibers. Most important is the glass transition temperature, which is high enough to allow fiber measurement at about 200 °C. Infrared spectra have been recorded every 5 min during the curing process of the resin. A direct measurement of the integrated intensities of the relevant absorption band enabled to determine the times when the curing process started and when it finished. This direct analysis has been confirmed by principle component analysis, which is an unsupervised and very efficient method for applications at the industrial scale. Moreover, {{it has been shown}} that an autocatalytic kinetic model should be used to give a good account for the absorbency evolution versus time. From a practical point of view, the optical fiber can be integrated directly into the mould and be considered as a consumable. The use of chalcogenide glass fiber to record remotely infrared signals, coupled with modern spectral analysis techniques constitute a very powerful route for monitoring the curing of thermo-hardening resins...|$|E

40|$|Here, {{molecular}} {{models for}} {{the description of the}} dynamics and flow properties of melts of entangled branched polymers are developed. Their predictions are compared against data from MD simulations, NSE spectroscopy, and rheological measurements. Following an introductory chapter, in chapters 2 and 3 the attention is drawn to local branch point motion. Expressions for the MSD correlation functions are derived. The expression for the segmental MSD is compared against MD results [1], obtained from simulations in which arm ends are motionless, i. e. standard CR events are suppressed. This comparison suggests an apparent slow relaxation of the branch point localisation at early times; here, this process is referred to as “early tube dilation” (ETD). Standard CR events are also taken into account by utilizing the dynamic dilution hypothesis [2]. It is shown that the theoretical expression matches MSD data from simulations in which chain ends are mobile provided that CR and ETD are accounted for in the model. The theoretical MSD correlation functions are also used, {{in the context of a}} dynamic version of the RPA, for the calculation of the scattering signal from the branch point; the predicted signal is compared against NSE data [3]. Chapters 4 and 5 deal with the flow properties of pom-pom melts. FSR and cross-slot flow measurements [4, 5, 6, 7], from industrial melts, indicate a viscosity overshoot in extension. In chapter 4 this phenomenon is modelled by introducing the overshoot model, a variant of the pom-pom model of McLeish and Larson [8]. Following the approach of Inkson et al. [9], a multimode version of the overshoot model is employed to fit the FSR data for the <b>industrial</b> <b>resin</b> DOW 150 R [6, 7]. In chapter 5, CR events are incorporated. They are modelled by means of Rouse-like hops in common with Refs. [10, 11, 12, 13]. In analogy with Refs. [14, 15], the physical picture of thin and fat tubes is adopted in the description of the dynamics of the system. The model predicts strain hardening (thinning) at extension (shear) during start up of the flow. The maximum stretch, however, becomes dependent on flow-rate...|$|E
40|$|This {{investigation}} {{was carried out}} {{on behalf of the}} Momentive Specialty Chemicals Pty Ltd, Mt Maunganui. The aim of the {{investigation was}} to develop a method to analyse the formation of melamine formaldehyde resins via an in situ real time NMR experiment leading to quantitative NMR intensities of the resin up to the stages of its <b>Industrial</b> <b>Resin</b> Endpoint (IRE). In order to run an in situ reaction for the melamine formaldehyde resin system and monitor it in real time, both qualitative and quantitative NMR acquisition methods were required. The qualitative method was power gated and used to obtain results in situ and in real time. However to render it quantitative, it was necessary to develop a quantitative method which was initially executed to obtain a conversion factor for relating the qualitative results obtained in the in situ experiment to quantitative results performed by doing inverse gated NMR spectra on a final form of the resin. The development of this technique required the determination of the longitudinal relaxation times (T 1) of the species within the melamine reaction as these were required to derive the necessary repetition rates employed in the NMR acquisition methods. In general, this project involved the development of the above mentioned NMR analytical protocols with tailoring to run this type of experiment in a 5 mm NMR tube using a 400 MHz NMR spectrometer whereby previous research on urea and phenol formaldehyde resins and employing identical NMR methodologies had relied on analyses conducted in a 10 mm NMR tube on a 300 MHz NMR instrument. As a result, reaction profiles of the melamine resin reaction were obtained during a real time experiment. The reaction profiles of the addition stage of the melamine resin reaction showed that the increase in the methylol melamine species occurs very fast and is justified by the exponential decay of the methylene glycol species corresponding to the formaldehyde solution. The condensation stages of the resin reaction were also observed until the IRE. The reaction profiles of the ether and methylene bridge links are clearly given showing that ether linkages predominate in the addition stage and plateaus, and methylene linkages only increase after the addition stage of the reaction. They provided insight to the reaction progress corresponding to addition and condensation stages of the melamine resin reaction...|$|E

Current approaches for their analysis {{do not allow}} the characterization of pentaerythritol and phthalic acid esters, whose detection is interesting to fully characterize the materials, e. g. for forensic or cultural heritage applications. METHODS: A combined analytical approach based on Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS), HighPerformance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) /MS and flow injection analysis (FIA) /MS was adopted. GC/MS was used to characterize the fatty acid profile and the polybasic acids in extracts from <b>industrial</b> alkyd <b>resins.</b> HPLC/MS and FIA/MS {{were used for the}} characterization of the triglyceride profile of the oil used to manufacture the resin and for the identification of reaction products deriving from the synthesis process. RESULTS: The multi-analytical approach was applied on two different <b>industrial</b> alkyd <b>resins</b> produced from two different oils. The GC/MS analysis was successful in characterizing the fatty acid profile and the aromatic fraction of the resin. The HPLC/MS analysis allowed us to characterize the pentaerythritol and phthalic acid ester and the triglycerides residues from the synthesis process, by studying their high-resolution tandem mass spectra.

Therefore, finite element analyses were carried out in order to compute the stress levels under different loading conditions at the instant and the location corresponding to the onset of failure. The comparison of the stress levels computed in uniaxial tension of notched and unnotched specimens and in pure compression enables an estimation of the aspect ratio of the critical microdefects and of the critical principal tensile stress.

The {{tung tree}} (Aleurites fordii) is a plant of the Euphorbiaceae family, adapted to {{temperate}} climate, needs about 350 to 400 chilling hours (below 7. 2 ?? C) for vegetative and flower buds differentiation after the winter. This species is cultivated {{in order to}} produce oil with has a very important feature which is quick drying, and is widely used in <b>industrial</b> paints and <b>resins.</b> Although this plant is present in the State of Rio Grande do Sul for over 50 years, information about the behavior of the tung tree are recent. Therefore the objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the agronomic and phonological performance of two populations of tung tree from seeds, in order to identify genotypes with traits of interest. Assessments occurred in four consecutive crops evaluating the agronomic, morphological and phenological characteristics. The results show variability of interest to all features. Genotypes with high yield potential, were identified some early genotypes considering the start of production, and genotypes that have greater need of heat or cold, two very important features for cultivation in Rio Grande do Sul...|$|R
40|$|Polyolefins are {{the most}} {{important}} commodity polymers today. Their end use properties polymers depend primarily on their molecular weight (MWD) and chemical composition (CCD) distributions. Several characterization techniques are used to analyze the microstructures of the polyolefins. High-temperature gel permeation chromatography (GPC) is the most widely used technique for MWD determination. Temperature rising elution fractionation (TREF) and crystallization analysis fractionation (CRYSTAF) are routinely used for CCD measurement. There have been significant improvements {{over the last few years}} on CCD characterization techniques for polyolefins with the introduction of crystallization elution fractionation (CEF) and high-temperature thermal gradient interaction chromatography (HT-TGIC). The main objective of this thesis was to conduct systematic studies on HT-TGIC and CEF to provide a better understanding on the separation mechanism of these new techniques and to find out operational conditions that enhance the resolution of the measured CCDs. The effects of cooling rate, adsorption/desorption temperature range, heating rate and sample size on HT-TGIC fractionation were investigated using polyethylene and ethylene/ 1 -octene copolymers made with metallocene catalyst. It was found out that HT-TGIC was relatively insensitive to the cooling rate within the range investigated in this study. However, the obtained profiles depended strongly on the heating rate applied during the desorption cycle. Chromatograms measured under faster heating rates were broader and had lower resolutions, supposedly due to co-desorption effects. Analysis of polyolefin blends by HT-TGIC showed that sample volume was a very important parameter affecting peak separation of the blend components; reducing the volume of the injected sample can be used to minimize the degree of co-adsorption and co-desorption effects. The effect of solvent type on HT-TGIC analysis was investigated using o-dichlorobenzene (ODCB), 1, 2, 4 -trichlorobenzene (TCB), and chloronaphthalene (CN). Polyolefin blends were analyzed using these solvents and the best resolution was obtained iv when ODCB was used as the mobile phase. The profiles obtained using TCB and CN were similar and both were strongly affected by the co-adsorption and co-desorption phenomena. HT-TGIC profiles of ethylene homopolymers and ethylene/ 1 -octene copolymers were also compared with the equivalent CEF profiles. Interestingly, it was found out that the differences between the profiles measured by these techniques decreased as the comonomer content increased, with CEF systematically measuring sharper profiles for samples with low 1 -olefin comonomer content. A new method was also developed to quantify the degree of co-crystallization of polyolefin blends analyzed by CEF and was used to quantify operating conditions that influenced co-crystallization. The results showed that co-crystallization can be minimized using slower cooling rates, but heating rates play a less important role. A detailed study on the effect of CEF operating conditions on CCD resolution was also conducted using <b>industrial</b> LLDPE <b>resins</b> that have broad MWDs and CCDs. Cooling rate and solvent flow rate during the cooling cycle significantly affect the degree of co-crystallization of CEF profiles. However, varying the heating rate does not have a marked impact on these separations. The CEF profiles of these resins were compared with the equivalent HT-TGIC profiles, showing that CEF provided better peak separation than HT-TGIC. Finally, a new mathematical model was developed to simultaneously deconvolute the MWD and CCD of polyolefins made with multiple site-type catalysts such as Ziegler-Natta catalysts. The model was applied to several industrial linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) resins to estimate the minimum number of active site types, the number average molecular weight, the average comonomer mole fraction, and the mass fraction of soluble and non-soluble polymer made on each site type...|$|R
40|$|O objetivo deste estudo foi analisar a viabilidade técnica do uso de resíduo {{industrial}} composto de resina fenólica, lignocelulose, carbonato de cálcio, talco, mica e negro de fumo como carga para o polipropileno (PP). Compósitos de PP com 10, 15 e 20 % em massa do resíduo foram processados em extrusora de rosca dupla e moldados por injeção. Os compósitos moldados foram caracterizados por microscopia eletrônica de varredura (MEV), análises térmicas (DSC e TGA), ensaios mecânicos (tração, flexão e impacto) e ensaio termo-mecânico (HDT). Os compósitos moldados apresentaram partículas do resíduo com tamanhos inferiores a 500 µm dispersas na matriz de polipropileno. As partículas do resíduo atuaram como agentes de nucleação da cristalização do PP. Os compósitos apresentaram maior resistência à degradação térmica, balanço de rigidez e resistência com aumento do módulo sob flexão e diminuição da resistência à tração, manutenção da resistência ao impacto sob entalhe, e aumento da temperatura de distorção ao calor (HDT). O desempenho dos compósitos demonstrou que o resíduo industrial de resina fenólica pode ser empregado como carga funcional para o PP. Além disso, os compósitos desenvolvidos representam uma alternativa para a reciclagem do resíduo industrial de resina fenólica. The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the technical feasibility of using industrial waste composed of phenolic resin, lignocellulose, calcium carbonate, talc, mica and carbon black as filler for polypropylene (PP). Composites of PP with 10, 15 and 20 wt% of the waste were processed in a twin-screw extruder followed by injection molding. Molded composites were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), thermal analyses (DSC and TGA), mechanical tests (tensile, flexural and impact) and thermo-mechanical test (HDT). The composites showed residue particles with sizes less than 500 µm dispersed in the PP matrix. The residue particles acted as nucleating agents for PP crystallization. The composites showed greater thermal degradation resistance as compared to PP. The composites showed a balance of stiffness and mechanical strength with increase of the flexural module and decrease of the tensile strength. The notched impact strength was not altered and the heat distortion temperature (HDT) of the composites was increased as compared to PP. The performance of the composites developed here showed that the industrial waste based on phenolic resin can be used as functional filler for PP. Furthermore, these composites are an alternative for the recycling of the phenolic <b>resin</b> <b>industrial</b> waste...|$|R
40|$|Deals {{with the}} preparation, {{characterisation}} {{and testing of}} a series of new and improved synthetic anion exchange resins for selective absorption of the precious metals gold and silver, over the base metals, iron, copper, cobalt, zinc, nickel and aluminium, from an industrial leach solution. The major method employed by industry, over the last thirty years, to abstract gold from low grade ore or tailings has been cyanide leaching followed by activated carbon concentration. The inherent problems with carbon prompted investigations into alternative methods for the concentration and abstraction of the metal cyano complexes. Ion exchange resins were employed for this purpose due to their versatility towards derivatisation and inertness to chemical and physical attack. The aims of this study were three-fold. The first aim was to design, synthesise and characterise a series of precious metal selective, strong and mixed base, anion exchange resins, where the cationic active site of each is sterically hindered to the approach of the base metal complexes. This aim also included development of the synthetic procedure to yield a resin with the highest degree of substitution possible. The second aim involved the synthesis of each resin on a variety of solid supports, from Merrifield (gel) type resins with different percentage crosslinking to highly crosslinked macroreticular (macroporous) matrices, and comparison of the degree of substitution, precious metal selectivity, equilibrium loading and loading rate achieved with each. This would then allow the identification and use of the most suitable resin base for this study. The final objective of this research involved an investigation into the performance of each resin employing both synthetic and industrial metal cyanide solutions. These investigations were performed under varying chemical and physical conditions (pH, temperature and concentration, etc.) and various kinetic models applied to each resin to mimic its loading characteristics. The selectivity and loading properties of the prepared resins were compared to those of commercial anion exchange <b>resins,</b> <b>industrial</b> activated carbon and other specific gold selective resins. Twenty-four resins were prepared by attaching tertiary amines to blank, chloromethylated poly-styrene/divinylbenzene copolymer resin matrices via seven day reactions in DMF at temperatures of 110 °C, thus forming the strong base, quaternary ammonium anion exchanging active site. If required, the resins were then further functionalised to form the respective gold selective species. The degrees of substitution for the novel resins ranged from 0. 2 meq/g to 2. 5 meq/g depending upon the nature of the starting amine. As some resins are mixed base anion exchange, having one strong base site and one or more (up to four) weak/moderate base sites, gold loadings were obtained in the range 40 000 g Au/ton resin to 1 110 000 g Au/ton resin, or 4 % Au w/w to 110 % Au w/w. No obvious differences in substitution were noted between the different resin matrices trialed. The structure of these function-alised groups on the synthesised resins were characterised by microanalysis, difference infra-red and solid state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, atomic absorption spectrophotometry, and by comparison with model compounds. Similarities between the NMR spectral properties of the resins and model compounds as well as differences in these properties between the unattached amines and the resins were sought and inferences made as to the success of either the attachment or derivatisation reactions. Microanalysis and anion exchange were also employed to confirm the existence of each functionality and the type of novel resin formed. All the resins prepared show good to excellent selectivity for the precious metal cyano complexes, with four - NOTREN, TIPA, TIPAAPS and TEA-BE resins - displaying extra-ordinary discrimination at all pH values. The pH of the solution was observed to have no effect on the loading of strong base resins, however the equilibrium loading on the mixed base resins was limited by the acidity of the solution. Variation in solution temperature results in an almost linear increase in initial loading rate, indicating a first order process, with an average rate constant of 2 x 10 -³ sec-¹ and activation energy of 55 kJ/mol. At 30 ºC the reactions were complete in about six hours, while at 80 ºC the resins were fully loaded in approximately 45 minutes. An increase in temperature also resulted in a linear decrease in equilibrium loading, indicating an exothermic process, with an average ∆Hextraction of - 35 kJ/mol. Change in ionic strength of the solution resulted in a decrease in the final loading due to increased competition for the active site. Variation of resin matrix had little effect on the gold selectivity or loading of the respective resin. Each of the resins tested with the metal cyanide solutions (both synthetic and industrial) could be easily regenerated to their full capacity. The thiocyanate and thiourea elution procedures proved to be the most efficient for recovery of the precious metals with these selective resins. Rate constants of approximately 5 x 10 -³ sec-¹ (first order process) for the thiourea method and 1. 55 L/mol/sec (second order process) for the thiocyanate method were measured. The resins were recycled many times through loading, elution and regeneration cycles employing industrial leachate solutions for loading without any loss of selectivity or gold loading ability. There was also no evidence of the resins being poisoned by non-eluting metal cyano complexes during this trial. This reported research has thus led to the preparation {{of a series of}} resins which display a high selectivity for the precious metal cyano complexes while limiting the abstraction of the base metal cyano complexes. The performance of these resins compares favourably with that of other gold selective resins (some of which are being employed commercially as gold selective extractants) and as a result show enormous potential to industry for use as selective auro- and argento-cyanide concentrators from cyanidation leachates...|$|R
