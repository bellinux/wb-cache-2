5|$|By {{the period}} of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, Babylonian astronomers were making {{systematic}} observations of the positions and behavior of the planets. For Mars, they <b>knew,</b> <b>for</b> example, that the planet made 37 synodic periods, or 42 circuits of the zodiac, every 79 years. The Babylonians invented arithmetic methods for making minor corrections to the predicted positions of the planets. This technique was primarily derived from timing measurements—such as when Mars rose above the horizon, rather than from the less accurately known position of the planet on the celestial sphere.|$|E

5|$|As well {{as using}} events from his past, Fleming also used names of {{individuals}} he <b>knew</b> <b>for</b> {{some of his}} characters. The editor of The London Magazine, Alan Ross, had provided Fleming with details {{about the effects of}} the electroshock therapy that Bond went through and, by way of thanks, the novel's SIS station chief in Jamaica, Commander Ross, was named after him. Similarly, Fleming used the name of the secretary of the Royal St George's Golf Club, Mark Nicholson, for the CIA representative at the hotel. Tony Hugill, the sugar planter mentioned in the novel, was named after a member of Fleming's 30 AU unit who managed the Tate & Lyle plantations in West Indies after the war and the book's main villain, Francisco Scaramanga, was named after George Scaramanga, an Etonian contemporary of Fleming's: the pair are said to have fought at school.|$|E

5|$|Brezhnev's {{personality}} cult {{was growing}} outrageously {{at a time}} when his health was in rapid decline. His physical condition was deteriorating; he was a lifelong heavy smoker, he had become addicted to sleeping pills, and had begun drinking to excess. Over the years he had become overweight. From 1973 until his death, Brezhnev's central nervous system underwent chronic deterioration and he had several minor strokes as well as insomnia. In 1975 he suffered his first heart attack. When receiving the Order of Lenin, Brezhnev walked shakily and fumbled his words. According to one American intelligence expert, United States officials <b>knew</b> <b>for</b> several years that Brezhnev had suffered from severe arteriosclerosis and believed he had suffered from other unspecified ailments as well. In 1977 American intelligence officials publicly suggested that Brezhnev had also been suffering from gout, leukemia and emphysema. He was reported to have been fitted with a pacemaker to control his heart rhythm abnormalities. Yevgeniy Chazov, the Chief of the Fourth Directorate of the Ministry of Health, had to keep doctors by Brezhnev's side at all times, and Brezhnev was brought back from near-death on several occasions. At this time, most senior officers of the CPSU wanted to keep Brezhnev alive, even if such men as Mikhail Suslov, Dmitriy Ustinov and Andrei Gromyko, among others, were growing increasingly frustrated with his policies. They did not want to risk a new period of domestic turmoil that might be caused by his death. At about this time First World commentators started guessing Brezhnev's heirs apparent. The most notable candidates were Suslov and Andrei Kirilenko, who were both older than Brezhnev, and Fyodor Kulakov and Konstantin Chernenko, who were younger; Kulakov died of natural causes in 1978.|$|E

25|$|Being classically educated Englishmen, Grenfell and Hunt {{were mainly}} {{interested}} in the possibility that Oxyrhynchus might reveal the lost masterpieces of classical Greek literature. They <b>knew,</b> <b>for</b> example, that the Constitution of Athens by Aristotle had been discovered on Egyptian papyrus in 1890. This hope inspired them and their successors to sift through the mountains of rubbish at Oxyrhynchus for the next century. Their efforts were amply rewarded: {{it has been estimated}} that over 70% of all the literary papyri so far discovered come from Oxyrhynchus, both copies of well-known standard works (many in versions significantly closer to the originals than those that had been transmitted in medieval manuscripts) and previously unknown works by the greatest authors of antiquity.|$|E
25|$|On 2 March 1880, on his {{way from}} London to Switzerland, Gordon had visited King Leopold II of Belgium in Brussels and was invited {{to take charge of}} the Congo Free State. Leopold tried very hard to {{convince}} Gordon to enter his service, not least because Gordon was known to be modest in his salary demands, unlike Leopold's current agent in the Congo, Henry Morton Stanley, who received a monthly salary of 300,000 Belgian francs. Gordon rejected Leopold's offers, partly because he was still emotionally attached to the Sudan and partly because he disliked the idea of working for Leopold's Congo Association, which was a private company owned by the King. In April, the government of the Cape Colony offered him the position of commandant of the Cape local forces, which Gordon declined. A deeply depressed Gordon wrote in his letter declining the offer that he <b>knew,</b> <b>for</b> reasons that he refused to explain, that he had only ten years left to live, and he wanted to do something great and grand in his last ten years.|$|E

25|$|At Coruña {{the fleet}} was {{assembled}} {{under the command}} of Juan del Aguila as field master general, and Martín de Padilla the Adelantado, commander of the invading troops. The plan had now switched from Ireland with the objective of the Port of Falmouth in Cornwall. The Spanish were to hold the town and port and force Elizabeth into a peace or hoping to attract the Catholic followers and rise up in support. It was estimated that this would be far larger than that of the 1588 invasion attempt. The troopships were to take Falmouth, while the warships would also intercept and destroy Essex's returning fleet from the Azores. The other target as a failsafe as well as a strategic diversion was Milford Haven in Wales, a good landing ground from which Henry VII had landed his men to defeat King Richard III in 1485. A Spanish observer had noted that Milford contained many Catholics who were hostile to the English. The true intentions of the Armada however were confusing to the captains and officers, as they didn't really know whether this was an invasion, raid or naval interception. Only the high command <b>knew</b> <b>for</b> fear of spies & deserters in the fleet as they were taking no chances and all would only be revealed as they approached the English channel.|$|E
500|$|As {{with several}} others of his works, Fleming {{appropriated}} {{the names of}} people he <b>knew</b> <b>for</b> the story's characters. The name of one of Fleming's two travelling companions from the US, Ernest Cuneo, was used as Ernie Cureo, Bond's taxi-driving ally in Las Vegas, {{and one of the}} homosexual villains, [...] "Boofy" [...] Kidd, was named after one of Fleming's close friends—and a relative of his wife—Arthur Gore, 8th Earl of Arran, known to his friends as [...] "Boofy". Arran, an advocate of the relaxation of the British laws relating to homosexuality, heard about the use of his name before publication and complained to Fleming about it, but was ignored and the name was retained for the novel. During his trip to America Fleming had come across the name Spang—old German for [...] "maker of shoe buckles"—which he appropriated for the villainous brothers.|$|E

In his speech Prądzyński seriously inflated the Russian force, and also underestimated {{the strength of the}} Polish units. He also warned that the city's inhabitants would be massacred as in 1794 should fighting continue, and stated that the return to full independence under the sceptre of Nicholas was easily achievable, something he <b>knew</b> <b>for</b> sure was not true. He failed to convince his government and the Sejm that surrender was the only option, and a heated debate extended past the deadline of 13:00. The Russians resumed hostilities, and artillery from both sides started yet another duel.|$|E

At this point, Harrison switched back to his white Fender Stratocaster electric guitar and, as recounted to Anthony DeCurtis in 1987, {{he looked down at}} the setlist taped to the body of the guitar and saw the word [...] "Bob" [...] followed by a question mark.

500|$|Around {{the end of}} 1980, McCain {{decided to}} retire from the Navy.

[...] McCain thought he might make rear admiral, but probably not vice admiral, and never become a four-star admiral as his grandfather and father had been. McCain later wrote {{that he did not}} anguish over his decision, although it pained his mother, who thought congressional careers paled in comparison to top naval ones. [...] He was excited by the idea of being a member of Congress and was soon recruiting a campaign manager that Cohen <b>knew,</b> <b>for</b> a planned run at a House seat from Arizona. In early 1981, Secretary of the Navy John F. Lehman, {{who did not want to}} see McCain leave the liaison post, told McCain that he was still on the path to be selected for one-star rear admiral.

500|$|Hill {{started to}} {{participate}} in climbing competitions in the mid-1980s, but {{one of her first}} significant accomplishments was in 1979. She became the first person to free climb Ophir Broke in Ophir, Colorado, which has a difficulty rating of 5.12d and was the hardest route ever climbed by a woman at that time. It was the hardest crack climb in Colorado at the time and there were only one or two harder ones in Yosemite. Long was amazed by her feat. He has said [...] "that's when I <b>knew</b> <b>for</b> certain that this woman had extraordinary talent". The regional guidebook credits Long with the first free ascent of the route; Hill speculates {{the reason for this is}} that at the time she was an unknown climber and known only as Long's partner and protege. In her autobiography, Hill explains that it was during this climb that she realized it is not a person's size or strength but ability to be creative on the rock that is important: [...] "The big lesson for me... was to realize that despite what appeared to be a limitation due to my small stature, I could create my own method of getting past a difficult section of rock. John's size and power enabled him to make long reaches and explosive lunge moves that were completely out of my range. I, on the other hand, often found small intermediate holds that John couldn't even imagine gripping... Short or tall, man or woman, the rock is an objective medium that is equally open for interpretation by all." ...|$|E

500|$|Ron {{particularly}} despises {{talking to}} members of the public, which is why he deliberately designed his office to be uninviting to visitors, in part by mounting a double-barreled, sawed-off shotgun on a swivel atop his desk aimed at the guest chair, so it will be pointed at anyone who wants to speak to him, a claymore mine (front-pointed toward enemy), and a Czech hedgehog. Despite his lack of interest in the job, Ron occasionally demonstrates he is a good manager who recognizes the abilities of his co-workers. He claims not to be interested in the personal lives of those around him, and that his best friend was a co-worker he <b>knew</b> <b>for</b> three years without ever learning his name. However, Ron cares more about his colleagues than he lets on and often helps them in spite of himself. Despite sharing a nearly opposite view on the role of government, Ron gets along well with Knope, and the two share a strong mutual respect. Although Leslie had considered a job offer in the neighboring town of Eagleton, she stays based on advice from Ron that, no matter how many job offers she gets, Pawnee will always be her hometown. Ron also developed a grudging, avuncular affection for April's husband, Andy Dwyer, and decided to give him the [...] "Ron Swanson Scholarship" [...] ($940) so Andy can attend one college course: Women's Studies, after Andy and April couldn't afford to pay it. In the voiceover while Ron drops Andy off for his first day of class, he recalls his own first day of college when his father dropped him off at the steel mill. His father thought he shouldn't bother with college, but Ron hitched a ride to the school and went anyway.|$|E
