50|$|<b>Indatraline</b> is an indanamine homolog of tetralin-based tametraline, {{although}} {{in the case of}} <b>indatraline</b> the product is pm-dichlorinated.|$|E
50|$|Compare <b>Indatraline</b> with {{tametraline}} {{since they}} are directly homologous. There are some differences though. Superposition should {{make it possible to}} see that there is at least a relationship between the pharmacophore of <b>indatraline</b> and various phenyltropanes. More recently, additional work has been done also.|$|E
5000|$|If <b>indatraline</b> is N-alkylated it is {{possible}} to slow the onset of action, if the choice of alkyl group is sufficiently bulky, so that it is not until N-demethylation occurs that the molecules become really active. N-methyl <b>indatraline</b> has a much longer duration than <b>indatraline,</b> because norindatraline is inactive whereas demethylating N-methyl-indatraline does not terminate the actions of the parent compound. Most drug addiction programs are of the opinion that a [...] "slow onset, long duration" [...] DRI is less likely to be abused (c.f. Volkow and others). The N-methyl products are clearly not just inactive prodrugs though.|$|E
50|$|Although a {{new method}} of making <b>indatraline</b> was {{recently}} published, there is obviously {{more than one}} way of making this compound.|$|E
50|$|<b>Indatraline</b> (Lu 19-005) is a non-selective monoamine {{transporter}} inhibitor {{that has}} been shown to block the reuptake of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin with effects similar to those of cocaine. However, the effects have been shown to have slower onset and longer duration than cocaine, suggesting that the compound may, along with similar compounds, be used for treatment of cocaine addiction. Apparently, Lu 19-005 can be used to block the action of methamphetamine and MDMA.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{not right}} {{to think of the}} {{dimethyl}} analogs as a [...] "prodrug" [...] to the monomethylated drugs (cf. <b>indatraline,</b> [...] "31,345"), but it is correct that it is a [...] "" [...] form of the drug. This word is from the salsalate page. This was the reason why sertraline was made only as monomethylated because apparently according to the orders the 1° amine is inactive therefore the drug would have a shorter duration of activity.|$|E
50|$|Phencyclidine {{and related}} {{drugs such as}} benocyclidine, tenocyclidine, ketamine, and {{dizocilpine}} (MK-801), {{have been shown to}} inhibit the reuptake of the monoamine neurotransmitters. They appear to exert their reuptake inhibition by binding to vaguely characterized allosteric sites on each of the respective monoamine transporters. Benztropine, mazindol, and vanoxerine also bind to these sites and have similar properties. In addition to their high affinity for the main site of the monoamine transporters, several competitive transporter substrates such as cocaine and <b>indatraline</b> have lower affinity for these allosteric sites as well.|$|E
40|$|A new {{approach}} for {{the synthesis of}} <b>indatraline</b> was developed using as the key step an iodine(III) -mediated ring contraction of a 1, 2 -dihydronaphthalene derivative. Behavioral tests were conducted to evaluate the effect of <b>indatraline</b> and of its precursor indanamide on the motor activity of Wistar rats. Specific indexes for ambulation, raising and stereotypy were computed one, two and three hours after i. p. drug administration. <b>Indatraline</b> effects on motor activity lasted {{for at least three}} hours. On the other hand, no significant differences in motor activity were observed using indanamide. The results suggest that <b>indatraline</b> has a long lasting effect on motor activity and add evidence in favor of the potential use of that compound as a substitute in cocaine addiction...|$|E
40|$|The {{search for}} novel {{compounds}} of {{relevance to the}} treatment of diseases caused by trypanosomatid protozoan parasites continues. Screening of a large library of known bioactive compounds has led to several drug-like starting points for further optimisation. In this study, novel analogues of the monoamine uptake inhibitor <b>indatraline</b> were prepared and assessed both as inhibitors of trypanothione reductase (TryR) and against the parasite Trypanosoma brucei. Although it proved difficult to significantly increase the potency of the original compound as an inhibitor of TryR, some insight into the preferred substituent on the amine group and in the two aromatic rings of the parent <b>indatraline</b> was deduced. In addition, detailed mode of action studies indicated that two of the inhibitors exhibit a mixed mode of inhibition...|$|E

Gnawing on corrugated packing paper was measured. Results showed that: (1) indirect- but not direct-acting DAGs induced gnawing, (2) gnawing induced by indirect-acting DAGs GBR 12935, nomifensine and mazindol was potentiated in mice in which GABA type A receptors were stimulated either by THIP or muscimol, and (3) indirect DAGs had a differential sensitivity {{to the effects of}} THIP and muscimol.

40|$|Lyme {{disease is}} a leading vector-borne disease in the United States. Although the {{majority}} of Lyme patients can be cured with standard 2 – 4 week antibiotic treatment, 10 %– 20 % of patients continue to suffer from prolonged post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS). While the cause for this is unclear, persisting organisms not killed by current Lyme antibiotics may be involved. In our previous study, we screened an FDA drug library and reported 27 top hits that showed high activity against Borrelia persisters. In this study, we present {{the results of an}} additional 113 active hits that have higher activity against the stationary phase B. burgdorferi than the currently used Lyme antibiotics. Many antimicrobial agents (antibiotics, antivirals, antifungals, anthelmintics or antiparasitics) used for treating other infections were found to have better activity than the current Lyme antibiotics. These include antibacterials such as rifamycins (3 -formal-rifamycin, rifaximin, rifamycin SV), thiostrepton, quinolone drugs (sarafloxacin, clinafloxacin, tosufloxacin), and cell wall inhibitors carbenicillin, tazobactam, aztreonam; antifungal agents such as fluconazole, mepartricin, bifonazole, climbazole, oxiconazole, nystatin; antiviral agents zanamivir, nevirapine, tilorone; antimalarial agents artemisinin, methylene blue, and quidaldine blue; antihelmintic and antiparasitic agents toltrazuril, tartar emetic, potassium antimonyl tartrate trihydrate, oxantel, closantel, hycanthone, pyrimethamine, and tetramisole. Interestingly, drugs used for treating other non-infectious conditions including verteporfin, oltipraz, pyroglutamic acid, pidolic acid, and dextrorphan tartrate, that act on the glutathione/γ-glutamyl pathway involved in protection against free radical damage, and also the antidepressant drug <b>indatraline,</b> were found to have high activity against stationary phase B. burgdorferi. Among the active hits, agents that affect cell membranes, energy production, and reactive oxygen species production are more active against the B. burgdorferi persisters than the commonly used antibiotics that inhibit macromolecule biosynthesis. Future studies are needed to evaluate and optimize the promising active hits in drug combination studies in vitro and also in vivo in animal models. These studies may have implications for developing more effective treatments of Lyme disease...|$|E
40|$|Póster presentado en el IX Simposi de Neurobiologia Experimental, celebrado los días 22 y 23 de octubre de 2014 en Barcelona y organizado por la Societat Catalana de Biologia del Institut d'Estudis CatalansAlpha-synuclein protein (α-syn) accumulates in {{the brain}} of {{patients}} with Parkinson´s disease (PD) and leaves a degeneration of midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons. However, the normal function of α-syn on DA neurotransmission in vivo remains poorly understood. Here, we used two mouse models with a) reduced α-syn expression in the substantia nigra compacta (SNc) and ventral tegmental area (VTA) induced by antisense oligonucleotide molecule (ASO) and, b) modest α-syn over-expression in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) -positive neurons {{in the absence of}} overt toxicity. ASO sequence against α-syn was conjugated to a cell-specific ligand, <b>indatraline</b> (monoamine transporter inhibitor), to promote its selective delivery into monoamine neurons after intranasal administration. Indatraline-α-syn-ASO conjugate (1233 ASO) entered into midbrain DA cells followed by trafficking to deep endomembrane vesicles associated with Rab 7 resulting in an efficient α-syn knockdown. Indeed, 4 -day 1233 ASO treatment (30 µg/day) decreased α-syn mRNA and protein levels in SNc/VTA (84. 1 ± 1. 7 % and 57. 7 ± 7. 8 % of PBS-treated animals, respectively). Alpha-synuclein suppression displayed an enhancement striatal DA tone using intracerebral microdialysis. Local veratridine (50 µM) perfusion increased extracellular DA levels more efficient in 1233 ASO-treated than PBS-treated mice. Similarly, nomifensine (1 - 10 - 50 µM) or amphetamine (1 - 10 - 100 µM) showed a marked doseeffect which phenotypic differences. Tetrabenazine (VMAT 2 inhibitor, 100 µM) reduced striatal DA levels in 1233 ASO-treated mice. This effect was lower than in control mice. Conversely, we found that over-expressed α-syn inhibits striatal DA release. Together, this evidence indicates a physiological role for a-syn as a >fine tune> modulator of nigroestriatal DA release and the effects depend on the a-syn expression levelsSpanish Ministery of Economy and Competitiveness, INNPACTO Subprogram IPT- 2012 - 1208 - 300000; Instituto de Salud Carlos III (ISCIII) Grant PI 13 / 01390.
