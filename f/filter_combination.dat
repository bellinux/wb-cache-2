40|$|Whether a two-color {{reproduction}} from a red {{and green}} additive process is acceptable depends largely {{on the nature of}} the scene and its illumination. Additive two-color reproduction will be explored here using different scene illuminants and also different red and green filter combinations. Two projection methods are also examined. Red and green separations were produced by photographing a scene through 16 different filter combinations and 3 different scene illuminants. These separations are then projected two different ways. One method involves projecting the separations back through the red and green filters they were taken through, while in the other method the green filter is removed and replaced with a neutral density.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a statistical {{framework for the}} unsupervised learning of linear <b>filter</b> <b>combinations</b> for feature characterisation. The learning strategy is two step. In the first instance, the EM algorithm is used to learn the foreground probability distribution. This is an abductive process, since we have a detailed model of the background process based on the known noise-response characteristics of the filter-bank. The EM algorithm is therefore used to learn the parameters of a radial-basis expansion which describes the residual probability distribution when the background is subtracted. The second phase uses the a posteriori foreground and background probabilties to compute a weighted between-class covariance matrix. We use principal components analysis to locate the linear <b>filter</b> <b>combinations</b> that maximise the between class covariance matrix.

At high x-ray energies (> 35 keV) the subject {{contrast between the}} normal and Malignant tissues in the breast is poor, at very low x-ray energies (10 - 15 keV) the contrast is highest, however the high absorption result in a high tissue dose. To achieve to good result must be used the optimal energy, that could be achieved by using specific x-ray target and additional filter materials to generate characteristic x-ray of the desired energy. This research was aimed to evaluate the influence of target-additional <b>filter</b> <b>combination</b> and filter thickness to the x-ray energy spectrum.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of the thesis was {{to find the best}} way of storing samples of aerosol from {{drilling}} mud on filter. The patterns of loss depend on the properties of the base oil and the concentration of the sample. Most sample is lost during aspiration for high volatility samples, but the degree of loss during storage has similar patterns. Lower concentration samples loose more than higher concentration samples during aspiration. Filters should be taken out of the cassette before weighing rather than weighing the whole cassette with filter. Storage on cellulose acetate plus glass fibre <b>filter</b> <b>combination</b> and on double glass fibre filter have similar patterns, but more sample is lost during aspiration with a double glass fibre filter than with a cellulose acetate plus glass fibre <b>filter</b> <b>combination</b> for EDC Pearl and Sipdrill 2. 0.

How long a sample can be stored depends on the volatility of the sample, as high volatility (low viscosity) samples tend to lose more during aspiration. </p...|$|E

This prospective cadaver study aims at evaluating the image quality and assessing the changes that result when three different <b>filter</b> <b>combinations,</b> variation in the number of projections, and tube current are used in CBCT temporal bone imaging. The image acquisition was carried out using three <b>filter</b> <b>combinations,</b> Cu-Al, Cu-Cu and Al-Al, with varying thickness and the number of projections was changed from the standard 100 % to 150 %. Additionally, 8 mA and 12. 5 mA were used in all cases. The quality of the acquired images was then qualitatively (visually) and quantitatively (noise analysis) assessed. The visual assessment was carried out by two radiologists with over 20 years’ experience in the field of diagnostic radiology and the noise analysis (standard deviation), an algorithm-based assessment, was done in MATLAB user interface. The results showed that Copper and Aluminum (Cu-Al) filters offered the best image quality when compared with the Cu-Cu (factory-fitted) and Al-Al <b>filter</b> <b>combinations</b> in both visual and algorithm-based assessments. From the results, it was also demonstrated that increasing the number of projections from the standard 100 % number of projections to 150 % offered a better characterization of the complex temporal bone anatomy in both visual and noise analysis assessments. Finally, changes in the tube current from 8 mA to 12. 5 mA resulted in a minimal change of the image quality when visually assessed. However, the effects of the tube current variations increased when the algorithm-based noise analysis was carried out. In conclusion, variations in the material property of the filter, effective filter inter-positioning, and variations in the number of projections optimize the image quality in CBCT temporal bone imaging. /Kir 1...|$|R

30|$|Sequential convex {{combinations}} of multiple adaptive lattice filters using different exponential weighting factors in cognitive radio (CR) channel identification framework {{have been considered}} in this presentation. First, the sequential processing multichannel lattice stages (SPMLSs) are modified {{so as to be}} used in <b>filter</b> <b>combination</b> task. Then, two different combination schemes, i.e., regular combination of multiple lattice filters (R-CMLF) and decoupled combination of multiple lattice filters (D-CMLF), that utilize modified SPMLSs as filter structure have been proposed. A modified Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization of multiple channels of data, which is constituted in multiple <b>filter</b> <b>combination</b> task, is accomplished. A highly modular, regular, and reconfigurable filter structure, which is suitable for cognitive radios, is achieved with the combination processing implemented in an order-recursive fashion. The mean square deviation (MSD) performances of the schemes under stationary and nonstationary conditions have been presented and compared with the performances of multiple combination of least mean square (M-CLMS), decoupled combination of least mean square (D-CLMS) schemes, and component filters. It has also been shown that the fault tolerances of the proposed schemes are better than those of the component filters due to the redundancy introduced with combination processing, and that the proposed schemes bring together the desired adaptive filter features such as fast convergence and low steady-state MSD levels, which do not normally coexist.|$|E

This has {{been the result of}} a step-by-step optimization of the several factors affecting the sensitivity and specificity of multiple immunofluorescence analysis. First, 14 streptavidin-conjugated fluorochromes were evaluated by using spectrofluorometry. A primary selection was then made of ten spectrally separable dyes that could be evaluated by using image cytometry. These dyes were bound to latex particles, and specific filter combinations were assembled to minimize crosstalk between fluorophores while preserving sufficient fluorescence intensity and counting statistics. Potential probe associations were then assessed by measuring the emissions of all fluorochromes that were detected by each <b>filter</b> <b>combination.</b> The resulting crosstalk matrix served as the basic tool both for final selection of the optimal <b>filter</b> <b>combination</b> and for dye set (composed, in this case, of the seven fluorochromes described above) and for mathematical correction of residual spectral overlap.
