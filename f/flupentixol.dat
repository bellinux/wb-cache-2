50|$|The oldest depots {{available}} were haloperidol and fluphenazine, with <b>flupentixol</b> and zuclopenthixol as {{more recent}} additions. All have a similar, predominantly extrapyramidal, side effect profile {{though there are}} some variations between patients. More recently, long acting preparations of the atypical antipsychotic, risperidone, and its metabolite paliperidone, have become available thus offering new choices.

50|$|<b>Flupentixol</b> (INN), {{also known}} as {{flupenthixol}} (former BAN), marketed under brand names such as Depixol and Fluanxol is a typical antipsychotic drug of the thioxanthene class. It was introduced in 1965 by Lundbeck. In addition to single drug preparations, it is also available as flupentixol/melitracen—a combination product containing both melitracen (a tricyclic antidepressant) and flupentixol.Flupentixol is not approved {{for use in the}} United States. It is, however, approved for use in the UK, Australia, Canada, Russian Federation, South Africa, New Zealand, Philippines and various other countries.|$|E
50|$|As a {{long acting}} injection, {{zuclopenthixol}} decanoate {{comes in a}} 200 mg and 500 mg ampoule. Doses can vary from 50 mg weekly to the maximum licensed dose of 600 mg weekly. In general, the lowest effective dose to prevent relapse is preferred. The interval may be shorter as a patient starts on the medication before extending to 3 weekly intervals subsequently. The dose should be reviewed and reduced if side effects occur, though {{in the short term}} an anticholinergic medication benztropine may be helpful for tremor and stiffness, while diazepam may be helpful for akathisia. 100 mg of zuclopenthixol decanoate is roughly equivalent to 20 mg of <b>flupentixol</b> decanoate or 12.5 mg of fluphenazine decanoate.|$|E
50|$|Other {{permanent}} {{side effects}} {{are similar to}} many other typical antipsychotics, namely extrapyramidal symptoms {{as a result of}} dopamine blockade in subcortical areas of the brain. This may result in symptoms similar to those seen in Parkinson's disease and include a restlessness and inability to sit still known as akathisia, a slow tremor and stiffness of the limbs. Zuclopenthixol is thought to be more sedating than the related <b>flupentixol,</b> though possibly less likely to induce extrapyramidal symptoms than other typical depots. As with other dopamine antagonists, zuclopenthixol may sometimes elevate prolactin levels; this may occasionally result in amenorrhoea or galactorrhoea in severe cases. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is a rare but potentially fatal side effect. Any unexpected deterioration in mental state with confusion and muscle stiffness should be seen by a physician.|$|E

Both experiments were performed twice: first, rats were offered only standard chow, while in the second experiment they could choose between standard chow and a palatable/preferred chow. Cumulative light phase food intake was assessed for 7. h. Ip as well as icv injected ghrelin reliably increased intake of standard chow. <b>Flupentixol</b> did not affect ghrelin-induced intake of standard chow. Ip injected ghrelin failed to increase the intake of palatable chow, whereas icv injected ghrelin did. This effect was not blocked by ip <b>flupentixol.</b> In summary, ip administered ghrelin did not increase the intake of chow the rats preferred; whereas icv injected ghrelin further stimulated the intake of preferred chow suggesting a direct central mediation of this effect. Our results show that the dopamine antagonist <b>flupentixol</b> does not influence ghrelin-induced feeding in our choice paradigm...|$|E

40|$|A {{selective}} {{and sensitive}} method {{was developed for}} the simultaneous quantification of seven typical antipsychotic drugs (cis-chlorprothixene, <b>flupentixol,</b> haloperidol, levomepromazine, pipamperone, promazine and zuclopenthixol) in human plasma. Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) was used for complete separation of the compounds in less than 4. 5 min on an Acquity UPLC BEH C 18 column (2. 1 mm× 50 mm; 1. 7 μm), with a gradient elution of ammonium formate buffer pH 4. 0 and acetonitrile at a flow rate of 400 μl/min. Detection was performed on a tandem quadrupole mass spectrometer (MS/MS) equipped with an electrospray ionization interface. A simple protein precipitation procedure with acetonitrile was used for sample preparation. Thanks {{to the use of}} stable isotope-labeled internal standards for all analytes, internal standard-normalized matrix effects were in the range of 92 - 108 %.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to develop rapid {{disintegrating}} tablets of <b>Flupentixol</b> dihydrochloride, a slightly bitter antipsychatric drug. An attempt has been made to prepare bitterless rapid disintegrating tablet using Eudragit E 100 as a taste masking agent. The tablet was prepared with three superdisintegrants e. g. sodium starch glycolate, crosscarmellose sodium and crospovidone, each one was added in three different concentration 2 %, 3 % and 4 %; mass extrusion was the technique used for the preparation of these tablets. The blend was examined for angle of repose, bulk density, tapped density, compressibility index and Hausner’s ratio. The compressed tablets were evaluated for hardness, drug content, friability, disintegration time in-vitro and in-vivo, wetting time and dissolution rate. The contents of the prepared tablets were characterized by X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Different nine formulas showed in-vitro disintegration times ranges from 11. 8 sec to 61 sec, but it was 150 sec for F 1 (formula without any superdisintegrant). These results were nearly correlated with in vivo disintegration times for the ten formulas. In vitro dissolution studies showed the release in the following descending order of superdisintegrants: Crospovidone > Croscarmellose sodium > Sodium Starch Glycolate. Maximum in vitro dissolution rate was found to be with formulation F 10 which contains crospovidone (4 %). Thus, F 10 was considered the best among the other formulations. The stability study was conducted as the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guidelines and the formulations subjected again for changes in hardness, friability, drug content, wetting time and disintegration time.

40|$|Background: Cholecystokinin (CCK) is a peptide with anorexigenic effects. The serine/threonine kinase mTOR {{is thought}} to be {{involved}} in the integration of peptidergic satiety signals. So far it is unclear whether food intake regulation is influenced by the central CCK-B receptor system. Ghrelin and NUCB 2 /nesfatin- 1 were found in the X/A-like cell of gastric mucosa in rats. Their expression patterns vary depending on the nutritional status of the individual. Methods: For the first study fasted male Sprague Dawley Rats were injected intraperitoneally (IP) with 6 or 10 µg/kg (5. 2 or 8. 7 nmol/kg) body weight CCK- 8 S. Neuronal activity of phospho-mTOR- and oxytocin-positive neurons of the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) was assessed by means of immunohistochemistry. For the second study fasted rats received an intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of the CCK-B receptor antagonist CI 988 in combination with the CRF- 1 receptor antagonist CP 376395, the CRF- 2 receptor antagonist K 41498 or IP injection of the dopamine antagonist <b>flupentixol.</b> Subsequently, food intake was quantified. For the third study gastric mucosa of patients undergoing sleeve gastrectomy was investigated by western blot and immunohistochemistry regarding ghrelin and NUCB 2 /nesfatin- 1 expression depending on body mass index (BMI) of the subject. Results: IP injection of CCK- 8 S caused a dose dependent increase in neuronal activity of phospho-mTOR-positive neurons of the PVN, being partially colocalized with oxytocin. ICV injection of CI 988 reduced food intake significantly. This effect was abolished by <b>flupentixol,</b> but not the CRF receptor antagonists. In humans ghrelin and nesfatin- 1 are colocalized in the X/A-like cell of the gastric mucosa. In obese subjects less ghrelin, but more NUCB 2 /nesfatin- 1 immunoreactivity was observed with increasing BMI. Conclusion: Phospho-mTOR seems {{to be involved in the}} anorexigenic effects of peripheral CCK. Food intake regulation after fasting might be influenced by central CCK. In obese subjects ghrelin and NUCB 2 /nesfatin- 1 seem to be differentially expressed depending on BMI. This might represent an adaption mechanism to obesity...|$|E

40|$|The {{method of}} trans-striatal {{dialysis}} {{has been applied}} here {{to the study of}} the release and metabolism of dopamine (DA) in the awake rat. DA and its acidic metabolites, dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and homovanillic acid (HVA), present in the dialysates were separated by high performance liquid chromatography on reverse phase columns and estimated by electrochemical detection. In the awake rat, DA, DOPAC, and HVA could be recovered and quantitated in the dialysates for at least 4 days from the time of implantation of the dialysis tube. At a constant 2 -microliters/min flow of Ringer in the dialysis tube, the output of the substances recovered in 20 -min samples 24 hr after the implantation was as follows: DA, 0. 318 +/- 0. 035; DOPAC, 41. 3 +/- 4. 84; HVA, 32. 98 +/- 3. 79 (mean picomoles +/- SEM of six 40 -microliters samples). The output of DA, DOPAC, and HVA decreased slowly so that 4 days after the implantation the output of DA was reduced by about 35 % in respect to the 24 -hr values. After a 24 -hr recovery, drugs were administered and their effect on DA release and metabolism was investigated. Drugs of different chemical structure and spectrum, but having in common the property of blocking DA receptors and being effective neuroleptics such as haloperidol, sulpiride, and <b>flupentixol,</b> stimulated DA release and DOPAC and HVA output. Threshold doses for this effect were very low, being 0. 012 mg/k, s. c., for haloperidol, 2. 5 mg/kg, s. c., for (-) -sulpiride, and 0. 025 mg/kg, s. c., for cis-flupentixol. This effect was stereospecific as the (+) form of sulpiride and the trans- form of <b>flupentixol</b> were at least 10 to 100 times less potent than their enantiomer. The stimulation of DA release was shorter-lasting than the stimulation of DA metabolism and sedation or catalepsy. Moreover, whereas DA release did not increase by more than 100 % over basal values, DOPAC and HVA increased by more than 3 times after maximally effective doses of neuroleptics. gamma-Butyrolactone (200 mg/kg, i. p.) reversed haloperidol (0. 1 mg/kg, s. c.), and sulpiride (20 mg/kg, s. c.) induced stimulation of DA release while it potentiated the stimulation of DOPAC and HVA output. These data indicate that stimulation of DA release by neuroleptics is strictly dependent upon stimulation of DA firing and that different mechanisms underline their effects on DA release and on DA metabolism...|$|E

The identification of 11 phenothiazines with heavy side chains was performed by their protonated molecular ions [M + H]+ at m/z = 340 – 447, and the quantification was achieved using triflupromazine at m/z = 353 as the internal standard (IS). The relative ionization efficiencies of 11 phenothiazines and IS on MALDI-TOF-MS were different from those on ESI-TSQ-MS, but the product ion spectra on MALDI-MS-MS were quite similar to those on ESI-MS-MS except in the case of <b>flupentixol.</b> The limit of detection was 0. 3 ng/ml with its quantification range of 1 – 50 ng/ml urine in the best case, and limit of detection was 5 ng/ml with its quantification range of 10 – 100 ng/ml urine in the worst case for 10 phenothiazines except thiethylperazine.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} chronic administration of morphine on noxious stimulus-induced antinociception (NSIA) produced by intraplantar capsaicin injection. In the untreated (naive) rat, we previously found that NSIA depends on activation of dopamine, nicotinic acetylcholine, and mu- and delta-opioid receptors in nucleus accumbens. Rats chronically implanted with subcutaneous morphine pellets demonstrated tolerance to the antinociceptive effects of acute systemic morphine administration but did not show cross-tolerance to NSIA. Morphine pretreatment, however, significantly reduced NSIA dependence on intra-accumbens opioid receptors but not on dopamine or nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. As observed in naive rats, intra-accumbens microinjection of either the dopamine receptor antagonist <b>flupentixol</b> or the nicotinic receptor antagonist mecamylamine blocked NSIA in rats tolerant to the antinociceptive effects of morphine, but, in contrast to naive rats, intra-accumbens microinjection of either the mu-receptor antagonist Cys(2),Tyr(3),Orn(5),Pen(7) amide or the delta-receptor antagonist naltrindole failed to block NSIA. These findings suggest that although NSIA is dependent on nucleus accumbens opioid receptors in the naive state, this dependence disappears in rats tolerant to the antinociceptive effects of morphine, which {{may account for the}} lack of NSIA cross-tolerance. In separate experiments, intra-accumbens extracellular dopamine levels were measured using microdialysis. Dopamine levels increased after either capsaicin or systemic morphine administration in naive rats but only after capsaicin administration in morphine pretreated rats. Thus, intra-accumbens dopamine release paralleled antinociceptive responses in naive and morphine pretreated rats...|$|E
40|$|International audience: Gaining {{a better}} {{understanding}} of the biological mechanisms underlying the individual variation observed in response to rewards and reward cues could help to identify and treat individuals more prone to disorders of impulsive control, such as addiction. Variation in response to reward cues is captured in rats undergoing autoshaping experiments where the appearance of a lever precedes food delivery. Although no response is required for food to be delivered, some rats (goal-trackers) learn to approach and avidly engage the magazine until food delivery, whereas other rats (sign-trackers) come to approach and engage avidly the lever. The impulsive and often maladaptive characteristics of the latter response are reminiscent of addictive behaviour in humans. In a previous article, we developed a computational model accounting for a set of experimental data regarding sign-trackers and goal-trackers. Here we show new simulations of the model to draw experimental predictions that could help further validate or refute the model. In particular, we apply the model to new experimental protocols such as injecting <b>flupentixol</b> locally into the core of the nucleus accumbens rather than systemically, and lesioning of the core of the nucleus accumbens before or after conditioning. In addition, we discuss the possibility of removing the food magazine during the inter-trial interval. The predictions from this revised model will help us better understand the role of different brain regions in the behaviours expressed by sign-trackers and goal-trackers...|$|E
40|$|In Aplysia, the {{neurotransmitter}} dopamine {{is involved}} in the regulation of various physiological processes and motor functions, like feeding behaviour, and in the siphon-gill with-drawal reflex. In this paper, we report the characterization of the first Aplysia D 1 -like dopamine receptor (Apdop 1) mainly expressed in the CNS, heart and buccal mass. Following expression of the Apdop 1 receptor in HEK 293 cells, a higher level of cAMP was observed {{in the absence of the}} receptor ligand, showing that Apdop 1 is constitutively active. This activity was blocked by the inverse agonist <b>flupentixol.</b> Appli-cation of dopamine (EC 50 of 35 nM) or serotonin (EC 50 of 36 lM) to Apdop 1 -transfected HEK 293 cells further increased the level of cAMP, suggesting that the receptor is linked to the stimulatory Gs protein pathway. When expressed in cultured sensory neurons, Apdop 1 immunoreactivity was observed in the cell body and neurites. Control sensory neurons respon-ded to dopamine with a decrease in excitability mediated by a pertusis toxin-sensitive G protein. Expression of Apdop 1 pro-duced an increase in hyperpolarization in the absence of agonist and an increase in membrane excitability following stimulation by dopamine. In the presence of pertussis toxin to inhibit the Gi protein inhibitory pathway responsible for decrease in excitability mechanism, Stimulation of membrane excitability was observed. Apdop 1 sensitivity to dopamine makes it a potential modulator of operant conditioning pro-cedure...|$|E
40|$|Background: Cholecystokinin (CCK) is a peptide {{synthesized}} in the gastrointestinaltract and brain. After peripheral injection it is mediating a short {{inhibitory effect}} on food intake in rodents. However {{it remains to}} be established whether the central CCK 2 -receptorsystem is involved in the regulation of food intake. The serin/threonin-kinase, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTor) was detected in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) and paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus. It is suggested that mTor {{plays an important role in}} the integration of satiety signals in the brain. The aim oft the second study was to elucidate whether intraperitoneal (ip) injected CCK- 8 S affects the neuronal activity in cells immunoreactive for phospho mTor in the PVN. Serotonin and CCK have similar effects on food intake and both act via the vagus nerve. Therefore, we investigated whether CCK- 8 S injected ip modulates the concentration of serotonin in brain nuclei, which are involved in the regulation of food intake. Methods: For the first study male Sprague-Dawley rats were fasted for 24 h and received an intracerebroventricular (icv) injection of the CCK 2 receptor antagonist CI 988 alone or followed by a second consecutive icv injection consisting of a CRF 1 or CRF 2 receptor antagonist. Another group received an ip injection of the dopamine receptor antagonist <b>flupentixol</b> alone or in combination with an icv injection of CI 988. Finally cumulative food intake was quantified for 11 h. For the second study ad libitum fed male Sprague-Dawley rats received an ip injection of CCK- 8 S at two different doses. Subsequently the number of c-Fos-immunoreactive (IR) neurons, neurons that were positive for c-Fos and phosphor-mTor and neurons IR for c-Fos, phospho-mTor and oxytocin were assessed in the PVN, ARC and NTS. For the third study ad libitum male Sprague Dawley rats received an ip injection of CCK- 8 S at two different doses. Neuronal activity and the fluorescence of serotonin in nerve fibers in the PVN, ARC, NTS and dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMV) were assessed by means of immunohistochemistry. Results: The CCK 2 receptor antagonist CI 988 injected icv reduced food intake in rodents after a fasting period significantly. The dopamine receptor antagonist <b>flupentixol</b> injected ip abolished this effect. However the CRF 1 and CRF 2 receptor antagonists showed no effect. Immunohistochemistry showed an increase of activated phospho-mTor neurons in the PVN after an ip injection of CCK- 8 S, which were partly co-localized with oxytocin. In the NTS we detected an increase of neuronal activity after ip injection of CCK- 8 S and a decrease of serotonin-IR in the NTS and DMV. Conclusion: Our results suggest, that the CCK 2 receptor system is involved in the regulation of food intake in rats and acts via a dopamine mediated pathway. The metabolic status of the animals seems to be important, since there was no effect on food intake in ad libitum fed rats. Phospho-mTor seems to be part of the neuronal circuits mediating the effects of peripheral CCK- 8 S on food intake. Serotonin might be involved in the mediation of CCK- 8 ´s effects in the brainstem...|$|E
40|$|We {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that noxious stimuli induce pain modulation by activation of supraspinal structures. We found that intense noxious stimuli (i. e., subdermal injection of capsaicin or paw immersion in hot water) induced profound attenuation of the jaw-opening reflex in the anesthetized rat; forepaw subdermal capsaicin also elevated the mechanical hindpawwithdrawal threshold in the awake rat. These antinociceptive effects were blocked by previous injection of either a dopamine antagonist (<b>flupentixol)</b> or an opioid antagonist (naloxone) into the nucleus accumbens. Additional experiments in anesthetized animals showed that the antinociceptive effect of noxious stimulation by either capsaicin (� 100 �g) or hindpaw immersion in hot water (� 45 °C for 4 min) correlated with {{the intensity of the}} stimulus. The maximal antinociceptive effect of capsaicin was similar in magnitude to that of a high dose of morphine (10 mg/kg) injected subcutaneously. Injection of the GABA A-receptor agonist muscimol, but not naloxone, into the rostroventral medulla, a major component of descending pain modulation systems, blocked capsaicin-induced antinociception. Although it is widely thought that painful stimuli may induce analgesia by activating forebrain structures, this is the first demonstration that such a mechanism exists. Furthermore, this mechanism can be engaged by naturalistic stimuli in awake animals. These observations imply that painful stimuli might under certain conditions be rewarding. Key words: antinociception; capsaicin; nociception; noxious stimuli; nucleus accumbens; rostroventral medulla; opioids; dopamine; thermal stimulation; GABA; rats The nucleus accumbens, which is known to be {{an important component of the}} mesolimbic dopaminergic reward system and has been implicated in substance abuse, also plays a role in pain modulation. However, although microinjection of opioid directly into nucleus accumbens has been shown to induce antinociceptio...|$|E
40|$|Efflux-related multidrug {{resistance}} (MDR) {{is a significant}} means by which bacteria can evade the effects of selected antimicrobial agents. Genome sequencing data suggest that Staphylococcus aureus may possess numerous chromosomally encoded MDR efflux pumps, most of which have not been characterized. Inhibition of these pumps, which may restore clinically relevant activity of antimicrobial agents that are substrates for them, may be an effective alternative {{to the search for}} new antimicrobial agents that are not substrates. The inhibitory effects of selected phenothiazines and two geometric stereoisomers of the thioxanthene <b>flupentixol</b> were studied using strains of S. aureus possessing unique efflux-related MDR phenotypes. These compounds had some intrinsic antimicrobial activity and, when combined with common MDR efflux pump substrates, resulted in additive or synergistic interactions. For S. aureus SA- 1199 B, which overexpresses the NorA MDR efflux pump, and for two additional strains of S. aureus having non-NorA-mediated MDR phenotypes, the 50 % inhibitory concentration (IC 50) for ethidium efflux for all tested compounds was between 4 and 15 % of their respective MICs. Transport of other substrates was less susceptible to inhibition; the prochlorperazine IC 50 for acriflavine and pyronin Y efflux by SA- 1199 B was more than 60 % of its MIC. Prochlorperazine and trans(E) -flupentixol were found to reduce the proton motive force (PMF) of S. aureus by way of a reduction in the transmembrane potential. We conclude that the mechanism by which phenothiazines and thioxanthenes inhibit efflux by PMF-dependent pumps is multifactorial and, because of the unbalanced effect of these compounds on the MICs and the efflux of different substrates, may involve an interaction with the pump itself and, to a lesser extent, a reduction in the transmembrane potential...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Spontaneous {{reporting}} systems (SRSs) are pivotal for signal detection, especially for rare events {{with a high}} drug-attributable component, such as torsade de pointes (TdP). Use of different national SRSs is rarely attempted because of inherent difficulties, but should be considered {{on the assumption that}} rare events are diluted in international databases. Objective: The aim was to describe TdP-related events associated with antipsychotics, H 1 -antihistamines and anti-infectives in three national SRSs (in Italy, Germany and France) and highlight potential signals of torsadogenicity through a combined literature evaluation. Methods: A common search strategy was applied to extract TdP-related events: (1) TdP, (2) QT interval abnormalities, (3) ventricular fibrillation/tachycardia, and (4) sudden cardiac death. Signals of disproportionate reporting (SDRs) were calculated for TdP + QT interval abnormalities and defined by a lower limit of the 95  % confidence interval of the reporting odds ratio (ROR) > 1. Among SDRs with at least three cases without concomitant pro-arrhythmic drugs, we defined potential new signal of torsadogenicity as drugs with no published evidence from (a) the crediblemeds® website ([URL] as of November 1 st, 2014); (b) studies on the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS); and (c) safety trials or pharmaco-epidemiological studies (as of December 16 th, 2014). Results: Overall, 3505 cases were retrieved (1372, 1468, and 801 for France, Germany and Italy, respectively). Antipsychotics were mainly recorded in Germany (792 cases), whereas antibiotics peaked at 515 and 491 (France and Italy, respectively). Forty-one drugs met criteria for SDRs in at least one single source, of which 31 were detected only from one single SRS: 18, ten and three (French, German and Italian SRS, respectively). By contrast, only five SDRs were detected in all national data sources (amisulpride, aripiprazole, haloperidol, olanzapine, risperidone). Overall, five potential new signals of torsadogenicity were identified: <b>flupentixol,</b> ganciclovir, levocetirizine, oxatomide and tiapride. Conclusions: We found differences across and within national SRSs in the reporting of drug-induced TdP, which finally resulted in five potential new signals of torsadogenicity. These findings warrant targeted pharmacovigilance studies to formally assess the existence of actual drug–event associations...|$|E
40|$|Background: Although {{therapeutic}} drug monitoring (TDM) {{is considered an}} underused tool in psychiatric care, the prevalence of TDM is largely unknown. The {{aim of this study}} was to analyze the prevalence of TDM for antidepressants and antipsychotics during 2006 – 2013. Methods: The study population consisted of individuals $ 5 years of age residing in Stockholm County. The prevalence of TDM for each study year was calculated with the number of individuals in whom TDM had been performed as nominator (extracted from the TDM database at Karolinska University Laboratory) and the number of treated individuals as denominator (extracted from the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register). All data were obtained at the third and the fifth level of the anatomical therapeutic chemical classification sys-tem (pharmacological subgroup and chemical substance, respec-tively). The prevalence of TDM was compared between substances according to the level of TDM recommendation by guidelines. Results: For antidepressants, the prevalence of TDM decreased from 0. 48 % (95 % confidence interval, 0. 45 %– 0. 52 %) in 2006 to 0. 36 % (0. 33 %– 0. 39 %) in 2013 (among 133, 275 and 162, 998 treated individuals, respectively). For antipsychotics, the prevalence of TDM increased from 2. 3 % (2. 2 %– 2. 5 %) to 4. 1 % (3. 9 %– 4. 3 %) (31, 463 and 32, 534 treated individuals). For both drug groups, TDM was more common in men than in women. The most fre-quently analyzed drugs were clozapine, perphenazine, zuclopenthix-ol, nortriptyline, and <b>flupentixol.</b> Although not reaching statistical significance, the TDM prevalence was greater for substances strongly recommended for TDM than for substances with a lower level of recommendation, median (interquartile range) : 5. 6 % (2. 8 %– 22 %) versus 1. 1 % (0. 2 %– 2. 2 %), P = 0. 063. Conclusions: The prevalence of TDM is generally low, more frequent, and increasing for antipsychotics, and more frequent for men and substances where TDM is strongly recommended...|$|E
40|$|The {{plasma protein}} binding (PPB) data of twelve {{antipsychotics}} (aripiprazole, clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, sertindole, ziprasidone, chlorpromazine, <b>flupentixol,</b> fluphenazine, haloperidol, zuclopenthixol) were estimated using computed molecular descriptors, {{which included the}} electronic descriptor – polar surface area (PSA), the constitutional parameter – molecular weight (Mw), the geometric descriptor – volume value (Vol), the lipophilicity descriptor (logP) and aqueous solubility data (logS), and the acidity descriptor (pKa). The relationships between computed molecular properties of the selected antipsychotics and their PPB data were investigated by simple linear regression analysis. Low correlations were obtained between the PPB data of the antipsychotics and PSA, Mw, Vol, pKa, logS (R < 0. 30) values, while relatively higher correlations (0. 35 < R 2 < 0. 70) were obtained {{for the majority of}} logP values. Multiple linear regression (MLR) analysis was applied to access reliable correlations of the PPB data of the antipsychotics and the computed molecular descriptors. Relationships with acceptable probability values (P< 0. 05) were established for five lipophilicity descriptors (logP values) with application of the acidity descriptor (pKa) as independent variables: AlogP (R 2 = 0. 705), XlogP 3 (R 2 = 0. 679), ClogP (R 2 = 0. 590), XlogP 2 (R 2 = 0. 567), {{as well as for the}} experimental lipophilicity parameter, logPexp (R 2 = 0. 635). The best correlations obtained in MLR using AlogP and pKa as independent variables were checked using three additional antipsychotics: loxapine, sulpiride and amisulpride, with the PPB values of 97 %, “less than” 40 % and 17 %, respectively. Their predicted PPB values were relatively close to the literature data. The proposed technique confirmed that lipophilicity, together with acidity significantly influences the PPB of antipsychotics. The described procedure can be regarded as an additional in vitro approach to the modeling of the investigated group of drugs.
