25|$|The band {{began its}} tour for One Hot Minute in Europe on September 27, 1995 and played 16 shows. A US tour was to follow but was {{postponed}} after Chad Smith broke his wrist. The band considered carrying {{on with the}} tour even at one point considering Jack Irons {{as a replacement for}} Smith but there just was not enough time to rehearse with anyone new and the dates were rescheduled for early 1996. The band spent most of 1996 playing shows in the United States and Europe. By 1997, for the first time, the band cancelled many shows. Most of this was again due to problems within the band. Flea at that point was exhausted, tired of playing the same songs each night and was seriously talking about quitting the band while Kiedis had recently been involved in a motorcycle accident which left one arm in a sling and created yet another drug relapse due to his use of painkillers. Even Navarro was back to using drugs. 1997 saw the band playing just one show. This was at the very first Fuji Rock Festival on July 26, 1997. A massive typhoon hit that day but the band played anyway. They played through an 8-song set before having to cut the show short due to the storm. This would be the final show with Navarro and due to Flea's previous comments left many speculating if <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the band.|$|E
