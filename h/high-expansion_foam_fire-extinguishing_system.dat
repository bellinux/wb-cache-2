There are holes in the narrowest section for gas saturation of the extinguishing agent in data Venturi tube. This design allows the sprinkler to increase the effectiveness of <b>fire-extinguishing</b> <b>foam</b> due to its gas saturation, for example, the calculation of the hydrodynamic characteristics of the sprinkler taken universal foam. Data foam is approved for use in the Republic of Belarus. Injector elements are confuser, narrow (constriction) section and diffuser. To reduce losses, an injector inlet diameter is assumed to be the diameter of the output distribution pipe. This technique can be applied to the hydraulic design of automatic foam fireextinguishing systems...|$|R

50|$|Every type of foam has its application. <b>High-expansion</b> <b>foams</b> {{are used}} when an {{enclosed}} space, {{such as a}} basement or hangar, must be quickly filled.

If there is oil or grease left in the clothes after washing may the heat from the dryer cause a chemical reaction. This reaction may, under certain circumstances cause a fire inside the drum. Competitors to Electrolux has developed its own systems that extinguishes fire inside a tumble dryer and customers have expressed desire to purchase a <b>fire-extinguishing</b> <b>system.</b> Therefore, the project team received the task by Electrolux to develop a <b>fire-extinguishing</b> <b>system</b> that extinguishes a fire in a tumble dryer. The purpose of the project has been to develop a system that both detects and responds to fire in an industrial tumble dryer to meet the competitors and to satisfy customers' requirements. The goal was to develop a <b>fire-extinguishing</b> <b>system</b> for Electrolux Laundry Systems and develop a fully functioning prototype. The project began with information searches on a variety of methods to both detect and extinguish a fire. Subsequently, a number of different methods were used to develop a final solution and make a prototype. The result of the project is a <b>fire-extinguishing</b> <b>system</b> that extinguishes a fire inside a dryer. The system is entirely mechanical and uses water to extinguish the fire.

50|$|Unable to {{get close}} enough to safely fight the fire directly, the fire brigades forced <b>high-expansion</b> <b>foam</b> into {{ventilation}} shafts far from the fire. This created blockages that starved the fire of oxygen. By mid-afternoon the next day, the inferno was no longer burning, though the fire was by no means knocked down. Petrol continued to leak from the derailed wagons through the tunnel drainage and ballast and the vapour sporadically reignited when it came into contact with the hot tunnel lining. It also became apparent that petrol vapour had leaked into the nearby River Roch, possibly creating explosive atmospheres in the nearby towns of Summit and Todmorden.

5000|$|AirFLEX - This vehicle {{incorporate}} three {{special service}} fireground support functions into one apparatus. The first service is air cascade and breathing apparatus support. AirFLEX units {{are equipped with}} a supply of extra, full SCBA cylinders and a cascade and compressor for filling SCBA and SCUBA cylinders {{at the scene of}} incidents, as well as basic repair service for SCBA components. AirFLEX can also provide static breathing air via air lines for specialized rescues such as confined space, etc. The second service is floodlight service. Historically, in the fire service, before every front-line apparatus was equipped with power inverters, generators, and scene lighting, stand-alone floodlight units responded to support night-time operations. Original AirFLEX units were equipped with multiple portable floodlight fixtures for such operations, but have adapted to current needs; modern AirFLEX units are equipped with mobile light towers for scene lighting at incidents. The third service is <b>high-expansion</b> <b>foam.</b> Each AirFLEX unit is equipped with a high expansion foam generator, a supply of foam concentrate, and the delivery hose. <b>High-expansion</b> <b>foam</b> is traditionally used for stubborn fires in below-grade or confined environments, where water cannot adequately penetrate, and entry by firefighters is unsafe or unrealistic. In addition to the three [...] "namesake" [...] services, AirFLEX units also provide drinking water for fire scenes, and a supply of freshly charged portable radio batteries for extended incidents. AirFLEX units are staffed by one Emergency Vehicle Driver (or acting EVD). Two front-line AirFLEX units are in service continuously, splitting the city east and west of Charles Street for primary service. An AirFLEX unit is dispatched on working fires, or fires where the Fire Communications Bureau believes that the balance of companies will be utilizing SCBA. An AirFLEX unit is also dispatched automatically on any report of a fire in an ocean-going ship at port, fires below grade (tunnels), and on responses where the SCUBA team is utilized.|$|R

40|$|Stricter {{emission}} requirements {{have led to}} ship operation on low flashpoint fuels, such as liquefied natural gas and methanol. These differ in many ways from traditional fuels (e. g. heavy fuel oil and marine gas oil), but requirements and guidelines for fire detection and extinguishment have been sparse. This was addressed in the proFLASH project, first theoretically and then experimentally. This report documents the experimental part of the project, focusing on methanol, and gives technical guidance for fire detection and extinguishing systems. It was for example concluded that methanol flames exhibit similar radiation to ethanol in the IR spectrum, despite limited observability in the visual spectrum. Approved IR flame detectors (tested against ethanol) are thereby likely suitable to detect methanol fire; tested detectors could even detect fully obstructed methanol fire. The design concentration of carbon dioxide gas <b>fire-extinguishing</b> <b>systems</b> should be increased from 40 % to 55 % {{to achieve the same}} safety margin for methanol as for traditional fuels. The primary extinguishing mechanism of a water-based <b>fire-extinguishing</b> <b>system</b> used against methanol is dilution, but almost 90 % water may be necessary for extinguishment. Furthermore, dilution makes the methanol flames increasingly invisible. It is recommended to use alcohol resistant foam injection with fixed water-based extinguishing systems, since this significantly reduces the time required for extinguishment. The effectiveness of the system depends on the foam/water application rate. Hence, a higher discharge rate is more effective and a concealed pool is difficult to extinguish. In different compartment fire test scenarios, water-spray with foam injection was more effective against methanol than water-spray without foam against standardized fuels. High and low pressure water mist performed better than water spray against standardized fuels but worse against methanol (with foam injection). proFLAS...|$|R
50|$|Deionized {{water is}} used in water-fog <b>fire-extinguishing</b> <b>systems</b> used in {{sensitive}} environments, such as where high-voltage electrical and sensitive electronic equipment is used. The 'sprinkler' nozzles use much finer spray jets than other systems, and operate at up 35 MPa (350 bar; 5,000 psi) of pressure. The extremely fine mist produced takes the heat out of a fire rapidly, and the fine droplets of water are nonconducting (when deionized) and {{are less likely to}} damage sensitive equipment. Deionized water, however, is inherently acidic and contaminants (such as copper, dust, stainless and carbon steel, and many other common materials) rapidly supply ions, thus re-ionizing the water. It is not generally considered acceptable to spray water on electrical circuits that are powered, and it is generally considered undesirable to use water in electrical contexts.|$|R
5|$|Several major {{weaknesses}} in Akagis design were not rectified. Akagis aviation fuel tanks were incorporated {{directly into the}} structure of the carrier, meaning that shocks to the ship, such as those caused by bomb or shell hits, would be transmitted directly to the tanks, resulting in cracks or leaks. Also, the fully enclosed structure of the new hangar decks made firefighting difficult, at least in part because fuel vapors could accumulate in the hangars. Adding to the danger was the requirement of the Japanese carrier doctrine that aircraft be serviced, fueled, and armed whenever possible on the hangar decks rather than on the flight deck. Furthermore, the carrier's hangar and flight decks carried little armor protection, and there was no redundancy in the ship's <b>fire-extinguishing</b> <b>systems.</b> These weaknesses would later be crucial factors in the loss of the ship.|$|R
