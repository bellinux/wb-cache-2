In 1955, Caithness County Council constructed a new harbour on the south coast of the island at the then great cost of £28,500. Although it was <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> stem the exodus of people from the island, Stroma was abandoned only a few years after the harbour's completion.|$|E

5|$|Amanita rubrovolvata is {{classified}} in the subgenus Amanita of the genus Amanita, according to the systems proposed by Cornelis Bas (1969), and Rolf Singer (1986). It was one of 49 Amanita species included in a 1998 molecular phylogenetic analysis <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> clarify natural groups and phylogenetic relationships within the genus. In the cladogram, A.rubrovolvata is on a branch next to a cluster of species including A.pantherina var. lutea, A.gemmata, A.farinosa, and A.sinensis. These results were comparable to those published in later phylogenetic analyses (1999, 2004, 2010) that have included A.rubrovolata {{as part of a}} larger dataset.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} of the 2008 Democratic National Convention in August, media outlets {{observed}} that her presence on the campaign trail had grown softer than {{at the start of the}} race, focusing on soliciting concerns and empathizing with the audience rather than throwing down challenges to them, and giving interviews to shows like The View and publications like Ladies' Home Journal rather than appearing on news programs. The change was even reflected in her fashion choices, wearing more informal clothes in place of her previous designer pieces. The View appearance was partly <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> soften her public image, and it was widely covered in the press.|$|E

5|$|Ajay {{encounters}} Pagan, who chastises him for fleeing at {{the start}} of the game, claiming that he only ever <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> Ajay. Pagan offers Ajay a final decision: shoot him now, or listen to him. If Ajay shoots Pagan, the game ends immediately and the credits roll. If Ajay instead chooses to listen, Pagan reveals that Ajay's father sent Ishwari to spy on Pagan in the early days of the Golden Path, but they fell in love and had a daughter together, Lakshmana, which would make her Ajay's half-sister. Ajay's father, Mohan Ghale, killed Lakshmana for Ishwari's betrayal, and Ishwari killed him in turn before leaving the country with the infant Ajay. Pagan shows Ajay to a shrine containing Lakshmana's ashes, and Ajay places Ishwari's ashes inside. Pagan then boards a helicopter and departs peacefully, leaving the country in Ajay's hands.|$|E

5|$|The {{construction}} of the World Trade Center, of which the Twin Towers (One and Two World Trade Center) were the centerpieces, was conceived as an urban renewal project and spearheaded by David Rockefeller. The project was <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> revitalize Lower Manhattan. The project was planned by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which hired architect Minoru Yamasaki. Yamasaki {{came up with the}} idea of building twin towers. After extensive negotiations, the New Jersey and New York State governments, which supervise the Port Authority, consented to the {{construction of}} the World Trade Center at the Radio Row site, located in the lower-west area of Manhattan. To satisfy the New Jersey government, the Port Authority agreed to buy the bankrupt Hudson & Manhattan Railroad (renamed to Port Authority Trans-Hudson), which transported commuters from New Jersey to Lower Manhattan.|$|E
5|$|Four non-engineering {{scientific}} experiments were planned, two requiring the active {{involvement of the}} astronaut and two completely passive. The first involved the astronaut watching for four high-powered flares while passing over Woomera, Australia, and for a xenon arc lamp while passing over Durban, South Africa. The second involved two sets of photographs to be taken using a 70mm Hasselblad camera as well as conventional color photographs of the Earth from orbit. Focusing on geological features and cloud patterns, photographs were to be taken {{through a set of}} colored filters provided by the U. S. Weather Bureau. The latter were <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> calibrate the spectral reflectivity of clouds and surface features, which in turn would help improve the cameras on future weather satellites. The passive experimentation packages were two sets of radiation-sensitive photographic films, from the Goddard Space Flight Center and the U. S. Navy School of Aviation Medicine, and a set of eight different experimental ablative materials attached to the outside of the spacecraft to test their performance during re-entry.|$|E
40|$|Many {{people from}} the {{developed}} world, who <b>intend</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> the poor in less developed countries, actually end up doing harm by creating more dependence, demonstrating ignorance of the local culture, not {{understanding the importance of}} long-term relationships, and offering solutions to problems without ever getting input and buy-in from those they <b>intend</b> <b>to</b> <b>help.</b> There is very little published research in scholarly journals regarding how those from the developed world can best approach humanitarian relief and development work in the developing world. In this qualitative analysis using a collective case study design, humanitarian relief and development organizational leaders share best-practices that focus on the following recommendations: 1) Empower and develop the indigenous people, 2) Focus on long-term relationships and partnerships with the indigenous people, and 3) Work on understanding the local culture...|$|R

5|$|The {{relationship}} between Link and Zelda {{was quite different}} from earlier incarnations, in particular the fact that Zelda was {{not a member of}} royalty. According to Aonuma, a recurring difficulty was how contrived the necessity for Link to rescue Zelda became with each passing installment, as their contact may only have been fleeting beforehand. In response to this, the team considered how to make the player care about Zelda and want to rescue her. Having the two characters as childhood friends both served this purpose and cut down on extraneous plot elements. They continued to encourage the player by having Link only just miss her on her early travels across the Surface. Mischievous elements were also added to Zelda's personality by her pushing Link over an ledge: initially intended as a rule of three-style gag, it was cut down to two during development. The figure of Hylia was a new addition to the world's lore, although her existence was linked to Zelda, with the two being essentially the same character known under different names in subsequent ages. Groose, who acted as Link's rival, was introduced to make the story more interesting within the school setting. Groose's maturation {{during the course of the}} story was <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> convey Link's parallel growth as a character as he was otherwise mute and static.|$|E
5|$|With {{the area}} having a {{generally}} low density and lacking transit-oriented development, the Metrorail {{was designed as}} a park and ride system, with the idea being that suburban residents would drive to the stations, then commute {{the rest of the way}} into the city. Nearly all of the stations outside of downtown Miami have parking facilities, except Tri-Rail Station. Several have large parking garages, such as Dadeland North and South stations, located at the southern end of the system, which combined have space for over 3,000 cars. Earlington Heights, located just northwest of Downtown and adjacent to Interstate 95 and the Airport Expressway, has a large garage that was formerly dedicated to Metrorail riders. However, that is now used by the county due to the station's low ridership, with only 95 vehicle spaces currently available. The successful Dadeland garages are at or over capacity, with two of Metrorail's proposed extensions, the West Kendall Corridor and South Link, <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> alleviate them. The two northernmost stations, which are located near the Palmetto Expressway, Palmetto and Okeechobee, appeal to Broward County commuters with nearly 2,000 combined spaces. Additionally, the proposed North Corridor to the Broward/Miami-Dade county line would have included five park and ride facilities totaling 2,650 spaces. In the late 1990s, the plan was to potentially even continue the Metrorail line into Broward County along 27th Avenue (University Drive), ending at Broward Boulevard near Broward Mall in Plantation.|$|E
