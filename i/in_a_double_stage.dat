40|$|In the {{photovoltaic}} (PV) systems, {{the main}} {{objective of the}} control strategy is to extract the maximum power from the source; usually such objective is obtained by combining {{the action of the}} MPPT algorithm with a voltage regulator used to attenuate the disturbances at the source terminals.

The method is based on the modeling of the complete PV system (source, converter and load) and takes into account the main parasitic components also. Thanks to this global approach, the design of control strategies to regulate the PV panel output voltage can be optimized.

Conventionally either a solenoid operated electromagnetic valve or a rotary valve driven by a hermetically sealed motor is used for this. In this article, we present a novel {{pressure wave}} generator design based on cam operated valves for use with pulse tube refrigerators.

The possible application of partial nitritation SHARON (Single reactor for High activity Ammonium Removal Over Nitrite) coupled with autotrophic ANAMMOX (ANaerobic AMMonium OXidation) or heterotrophic denitrification via nitrite processes would represent a technical- and cost-effective technology: partial nitritation has been studied and commonly applied at full scale to treat anaerobic digester supernatant and landfill leachates, while only few studies focusing on the treatment of industrial wastewater containing toxic substances {{have been carried out}} so far. In this study, a SHARON reactor was used to treat synthetic and real ammonium rich refinery wastewater (sour water) : since availability of inorganic carbon (IC) determines the amount of NH 4 +-N being converted into NO 2 [...] N by partial nitritation, different influent IC/N (as HCO 3 -/NH 4 +-N) molar ratios were tested and SHARON feasibility as the preliminary treatment <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>double</b> <b>stage</b> SHARON-ANAMMOX or SHARON-Denitrification via nitrite process was assessed. In order to retain only ammonium oxidizing bacteria (AOB) in the system, the reactor was run at controlled temperature and operated as a chemostat (no biomass recirculation) at low hydraulic and solids retention time. A synthetic medium containing NH 4 +-N (2, 000 mg/L) was initially fed to promote biomass acclimation, then real sour water containing also organic substrate, cyanides, sulphides and phenols was supplied. In both synthetic and real wastewater, the IC/N molar ratio was progressively increased from 1 to 2. Effluent from the SHARON reactor fed with the synthetic medium (influent IC/N molar ratio of 1) was suitable for subsequent treatment by ANAMMOX; increasing the IC/N molar ratio up to 2 enhanced NH 4 +-N conversion into nitrite, producing a final effluent suitable for denitrification via nitrite.

40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} to the Faculty of Science, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy. October 2013. Johannesburg, South Africa. We report {{the role of a}} double step heat treatment process in the synthesis of novel GaN nanostructures (NSs) using a two stage furnace following a catalyst free vapour-solid growth mechanism. Morphological analysis revealed that GaN NSs were composed of rod-like structures with average diameter of 250 nm and accumulated particulates of GaN with diameter of 12 – 16 nm providing enhanced surface area. The wurtzite phase of GaN nanorods of agglomerated nanoclusters was synthesized at temperatures as low as 750 °C. An X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic study confirmed formation of GaN. The surface areas of the GaN NSs were high at 20 m 2 /g with respect to that expected for solid nanorod structures. The GaN NSs were of high crystallinity and purity as revealed by structural studies. Raman spectral analysis showed stronger intensity of the A 1 (LO) mode with respect to that for E 2 (high) mode indicating the high electronic quality of the sample. A photoluminescence study revealed the dominant presence of a defect band around 1. 7 - 2. 1 eV corresponding to nitrogen di-vacancies. Subsequent annealing in NH 3 has demonstrated a compensation of the defect state and evolution of a band edge peak with possible hydrogen compensation of surface states. We also report the role of activated carbon on Ga 2 O 3 to make GaN/C nanostructure composites using a single stage furnace. TEM analysis showed that GaN/C nanostructures gave different morphologies with different ratios of GaN/C. The surface areas of these materials showed an increase as the ratio of activated carbon was increased. PXRD showed that a ratio of Ga 2 O 3 : C of 1 : 0. 5 (w/w) was sufficient to form GaN. TGA revealed that the ratios of Ga 2 O 3 : C of 1 : 0. 5 – 1 : 2 gave materials that were thermally stable. Raman spectra showed that the material had excellent electronic properties. The material with a Ga 2 O 3 /C 1 : 2 ratios showed a poor gas response due to the change in reference value of resistance with the variation of hydrogen concentration. iv This study also provides the first investigation of GaN as a catalyst support in hydrogenation reactions. The GaN NSs were synthesized via chemical vapour deposition (CVD) <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>double</b> <b>stage</b> furnace (750 ºC) while nitrogen doped carbon spheres (NCSs) were made by CVD in a single stage furnace (950 ºC).

40|$|Optical {{switching}} {{has been}} proposed as an effective solution to overcoming the potential electronic bottleneck in all-optical network nodes carrying IP over WDM. The solution builds {{on the use of}} optical labelling as a mean to route packets or bursts of packets through the network. In addition to the selected wavelength, a short label of fixed length can be added to the information flow in order to be processed in intermediate nodes. The main advantage of this approach is the ability to route packets or bursts independently of bit-rate, packet format and packet length, increasing network flexibility and granularity. In this thesis the systems aspects of optical labelling will be investigated for several labelling techniques, in order to identify the strengths and drawbacks of each one with respect to system performance. Orthogonal labelling {{has been proposed}} as one of the potential labelling techniques. It is based on the transmission of two types of modulation on the same optical carrier. The orthogonal nature of the signal ensures that the label and the payload would be able to be detected independently of each other. In order to asses the limits and possibilities of such schemes, several orthogonal labelling schemes will be investigated with regard to generation, transmission, wavelength conversion and label swapping. The resulting subsystems are then combined in order to emulate the functionalities of a network node within a transmission system. The two main addressed labelling schemes are the IM/DPSK and the IM/FSK schemes. In IM/DPSK the payload is modulated in the intensity of the carrier, while the label is differentially encoded on its phase. The IM/FSK labelling scheme, on the other hand, modulates the payload on the intensity, while the label is modulated on the frequency of the signal. Other labelling techniques are also presented and analyzed, including carrier-suppressed sideband labelling and the DPSK/IM scheme that interchanges the roles of the modulation formats from the IM/DPSK scheme. A mention on time-serial labelling is done with regard to wavelength conversion and an experimental assessment of a packet switching node. Several methods for generating the labelled signals are studied. For the FSK transmitter, a novel method is presented, which is based on direct modulation of a DFB laser, accompanied by an intensity stabilization using the conjugated data on a EAM. The receiver performance is also analyzed with respect to several filtering schemes. A major performance limitation of orthogonal labelling comes from the crosstalk between the two modulation formats induced by the simultaneous amplitude and phase/frequency modulation on the same optical carrier. The receiver sensitivity of the IM signal improves as the IM extinction ratio is increased, while the sensitivity of the DPSK or FSK label deteriorates. Thus, the IM extinction ratio has to be optimized in order to correctly detect the information in the phase or frequency modulation. This requirement on the IM extinction ratio limits the network scalability and the system transparency to signal format. However, the need to use a poor extinction ratio can be completely eliminated by utilizing special line coding on the IM signal, such as Manchester coding or 8 B/ 10 B coding. The degradation of the orthogonal modulation formats, due to transmission over fiber spans, is compensated in single channel and WDM systems. Several compensation schemes are compared and limits to channel spacing and receiver performance are identified. The stabilization of filtering process throughout the systems are shown to be of importance. Wavelength conversion of orthogonally labelled signals is performed on passive and active devices. In HNLF both the FWM and XPM effects are exploited in order to achieve wavelength conversion of 40 Gb/s signals. Active devices as SOA, EAM and SOA-MZI are also investigated for wavelength conversion of labelled signals. Most of the employed wavelength conversion processes are only sensitive to the amplitude of the incoming signal, and can ??therefore effectively be used for label erasure. Label insertion can in some cases also be done in the same device, thus performing label swapping and wavelength conversion in a single device. However, this method is unable to re-use the same wavelength for the output signal, and requires a fast tunable filtering scheme at the network node. These limitations are overcome by performing wavelength conversion and label swapping <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>double</b> <b>stage</b> system, that makes use of an intermediate wavelength between label erasure and label insertion. The above mentioned functionalities are assembled in whole network systems experiments that validates the different labelling schemes with respect to transmission, wavelength conversion, label swapping and retransmission. Optical labelling and specially the orthogonal schemes for optical labelling, are thus shown to be an effective solution to all-optical networks...|$|E

The {{first part of the}} work deals with the development of an angular position estimation system. The goal was to obtain an integrated system within the sensor logic, <b>in</b> particular for <b>a</b> 6 DoF (Degrees of Freedom) gyro plus accelerometer sensor. Quaternions were chosen to represent the angular position for their flexibility and easy algebraic manipulation. A sensor fusion algorithm derived from the Kalman filter was developed.

The first filter stage used the accelerometer data, while the second filter stage used the magnetic compass data to correct the angular position. The system was modeled with Matlab Simulink and the algorithms were validated with both synthetic and real acquired data. A Simulink bit true model of the system was developed, using fixed point arithmetic. The experiments shown that 20 bits are necessary to reach the target precision. It was chosen to design an ASIP (Application Specific Instruction Set Processor) to process the algorithm using a 20 bit ALU with minimal area occupation and power consumption. An FPGA prototype was realized using the SensorDynamics SD 746 for the gyro plus accelerometer and the Honeywell HMC 5843 for the magnetic compass. A real time 3 D demo was realized. Moreover, the system was tested in the laboratory with repeatable rotations. A LabView program was designed to command the test machines. The resulting precision of the prototype was 1 deg for roll and pitch and 3 degs for the yaw. The second part of the work is about a fall detection system for elderly people.

The RAM-EP concept is to use electric propulsion together with gas collected from the atmosphere to provide thrust for counteracting the S/C altitude decay caused by drag. This technology would enable low altitude missions below 250 km and/or very long lifetime missions above 250 km. The purpose of this master's thesis is to investigate the main features of this relatively new kind of space propulsion {{and to develop a}} quasi-onedimensional model for describing the plasma behaviour inside the proposed RAM-EP thruster (<b>a</b> <b>Double</b> <b>Stage</b> Hall Effect Thruster), thus estimating its performances and verifying its capability to withstand LEO and VLEO aerodynamic drag. Since the expected inlet mass flowrates are very low, <b>a</b> <b>Double</b> <b>Stage</b> Hall Effect Thruster is employed in order to enhance ionization by plasma confinement in the ionization stage. The developed model relies on <b>a</b> one-dimensional approach <b>in</b> magnetic coordinates, in which the dominant plasma gradients are assumed to be orthogonal to the magnetic field lines. All the plasma equations are then integrated over the magnetic surfaces constituting the domain: as a result, differential equations as function of a unique coordinate are obtained.

The model predicts higher performances when the voltage dedicated to the ionization stage is increased up to one half the total discharge voltage. Due to the lack of an emissive intermediate electrode, the desidered plasma confinement is not achieved in the ionization stage and most of the ionization takes place at the acceleration channel entrance and in the near plume region.

40|$|MITO is a {{multi-purpose}} experiment mainly finalized for sub/mm cosmological observations. Here {{we describe}} essentially the SZ-meter version specifically dedicated to photometric {{measurements of the}} Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect towards near and large clusters. The instrumentation consists of a 2. 6 meter in diameter ground-based flux collector located {{at the top of}} the Testa Grigia mountain (3480 m a. s. l. AO - Italy). A single-pixel photometer (17 arcmin FWHM) operating at 150, 209, 270 and 335 GHz cools down four bolometric detectors to 290 mK for 4 nights continuously by <b>a</b> <b>double</b> <b>stage</b> He- 3 -He- 4 fridge. An electromechanical system allows for a field of view sky modulation with several profiles and high duty cycle limiting the microphonic noise on the detectors. Atmospheric fluctuations are thus reduced by means of triple-beam subreflector spatial modulation and synchronous demodulation...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} a plant {{concept of a}} solar-driven steam jet ejector chiller with latent heat and cold storage. The concept will be realized <b>in</b> <b>a</b> first demonstration plant. The solar cooling plant will consist of a solar collector field based on evacuated tube collectors with a thermal output of 200 kW, <b>a</b> <b>double</b> <b>stage</b> steam jet ejector chiller with a cooling capacity of 80 kW and two thermal energy storage units, meaning a heat storage unit using polyethylene as latent heat storage medium and a cold storage unit using a paraffin/water dispersion as latent cold storage fluid. While designing the solar cooling plant some preliminary research works have been accomplished with special regard to the development and integration of the heat and cold storage units. The results of this research {{as well as the}} overall design of the system will be presented in this paper...|$|R
