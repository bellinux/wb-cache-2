External stores capacity will be boosted to 5,000 kg (as opposed to 4,000 kg for the Tejas Mk 1), while the twin internal air-intake ducts will be minimally enlarged to cater to the increased airflow requirements of the 98 kN thrust F414-GE-INS6. The Ministry of Defence had sanctioned US$542.44 million (Rs 2,431.55-crore) for ADA to develop the Indian Navy's LCA Mk 2 (Navy) variant. The IAF is committed to procuring an initial 83 Tejas Mk 2s and the Indian Navy has expressed a firm requirement for 46 LCA Mk2 (Navy). The Mark 2 may feature an indigenously developed active electronically scanned array (AESA) fire control radar named Uttam. The Mk2 will also see the incorporation of a new electronic warfare suite which is being jointly developed with Israel. This is to have a new glass cockpit with larger 8 x 12 inch displays. The Mk2 will have some 25-30 percent commonality in parts with the Mk1 and these parts are already in production. The Mark 2 is scheduled for flight testing by 2018, but this may be delayed by two or three more years to allow time to engineer the installation of the GE 414 engine. In August 2015, the Indian defence minister stated the first flight is likely to be 2019 with an entry into service in 2022.|$|E
40|$|This work {{introduces}} the work {{conducted in the}} EU JTI project ANOLOCO, which has aimed at an assessment of aerodynamic and aeroacoustic performance of several high-lift configurations of a regional aircraft. The high-lift designs are for a laminar and slat-less wing, including configurations with a double slotted flap, single slotted flap, <b>drooped</b> <b>nose</b> and a Krueger flap. The aerodynamic performance is assessed from steady state RANS calculations up to maximum lift. The aeroacoustic performance is based on hybrid RANS-LES calculations for flow-induced noise generation, and using acoustic analogy methods for far-field noise propagation. Three different analogy methods are evaluated and compared. The assessment shows that the configuration with a Krueger flap gives the best performance. The maximum lift is close to 20 % higher than for any other configuration and the noise levels are also reduced, up to 10 dB lower than the configuration with a double slotted flap...|$|E

40|$|Resume : In {{work package}} 2. 3. 1 "LNC Application Studies for 130 -seat Regional A/C" of the Clean Sky GRA LNC project, Fraunhofer proposes a {{high-lift}} wing having {{a leading edge}} depressed downwards (a. k. a. <b>droop</b> <b>nose)</b> for reducing noise radiated from the leading edge. As opposed to the precedent wing models, the current model has a <b>droop</b> <b>nose</b> extended almost over the entire wing from 18 % to 98 % span. Good aerodynamic performance (cl max = 2. 6 at 15 degree angle of attack) of this model has been estimated in CFD analysis conducted in a full-scale condition. Due to the Reynolds number effect, CFD analysis in a 1 : 6 -scaled condition has shown smaller cl max = 2. 0, smaller angle of attack and less abrupt stall behavior. The current study aimed {{to confirm that the}} same performance expected in the scaled condition is actually observed in a wind tunnel. For this purpose, a 1 : 6 -scaled half wing model was first designed and manufactured {{so that it can be}} set in three different configurations: (1) clean wing,(2) high-lift baseline having deployed TE flaps but no <b>droop</b> <b>nose</b> leading edge and (3) full high-lift with <b>droop</b> <b>nose.</b> WT tests with this model were performed in an automotive WT facility in Weissach, Germany. Flow speed was set at 40 m/s. Aerodynamic forces and moments were measured by a six-component balance at various angles of attack ranging from - 6 to 20 degrees with 2 degree step. In these tests, the model was placed upright on a platform covering a balancerig raised above the WT floor in order not to disturb the flow. In the tests with a transition tripping strip attached on the suction side near the LE, cl max of 1. 0 at AoA of 10 degree for the clean wing, cl max of 1. 7 at AoA of 8 degree for the high-lift baseline and cl max of 1. 9 at 12 degree angle of attack for the droop-nose configuration. All the configurations have less abruptstall behavior as expected. These results are in good agreement with those of the CFD analysis. In the test without the transition tripping strip, very similar results were observed in the clean wing and high-lift baseline configurations. In the <b>droop</b> <b>nose</b> configuration, however, a large cl max of 2. 5 at a very large stall angle of 20 degree was observed during the WT test. This results hould be more investigated. In addition to aerodynamic examination, aeroacoustic noise sources were also examined with an acoustic beamforming system during the WT tests. No noise sources would be detected for the clean wing. For both high-lift configurations, these were found at few points on the leading edge, at the outer flap and at one of the stay supporting the inner flap. No qualitative difference insource distribution could be found between these two configurations...|$|R

Three main objectives are targeted by influencing the elasto-mechanics of structures. These objectives are vibration control, noise reduction and shape control. The latter is directly re-lated to morphing of airframes, thus being a focus of DLR’s aeronautical research programme. DLR initiated the national morphing activities with the project ADIF (Smart structures for wings) which investigated a local profile bump for flow inducement and concepts of variable camber {{as well as with}} the project AROSYS (Active Rotor Systems) dealing with adaptive rotor blades for active twist generation.

40|$|The {{high lift}} system noise of current {{transport}} aircraft is dominated by slat noise under certain operating conditions. Suitable means to reduce the noise impact {{in the vicinity of}} airports are (i) to increase the distance between the source and the observer and (ii) to reduce source noise levels. Both objectives can only be achieved by means of a multi-disciplinary aerodynamic and acoustic development since the slat {{is at the same time}} a very important element to achieve the necessary high lift performance and the dominant noise source of a {{high lift system}} 1. First attempts to reduce slat noise by means of a slat setting optimization were conducted at DLR in the mainframe of the project Leiser Flugverkehr 2. This purely acoustically driven study revealed that a slat gap reduction results in a local flow speed decrease at the slat trailing edge and thus to remarkable noise reductions of up to 10 dB, the latter of course depending on the magnitude of the slat gap reduction. The drawback of this approach was that at the same time the aerodynamic performance of the high lift system was degraded by a non-acceptable level. However, this study was the starting point of the DLR project LEISA (Low noise exposing integrated design for start and approach) that combined activities in the research areas of high lift system design and aero-acoustic design, which were carried out rather independently up to this point in time. In the project LEISA different types of high lift configurations were addressed and investigated in a 2 -dimensional approach. The first one is a long chord slat that provided a source noise reduction of about 6 dB while maintaining the aerodynamic performance of the reference slat system. The second, and more radical concept was to omit the slat and apply a <b>droop</b> <b>nose</b> system in order to reduce the aerodynamic losses as much as possible. The finally achieved source noise reduction with the <b>droop</b> <b>nose</b> system was about 8 dB while from the aerodynamic point of view about 50 % of the losses were recovered. Based on these promising results the transposition of these high lift systems to a real 3 -dimensional wing was carried out in the follow-up project SLED (Silent Leading Edge Devices). The final outcome of the project SLED can be summarized as follows. From the aerodynamic point of view the performance of the 3 -dimensional long chord slat compares very well to the reference slat system. The final <b>droop</b> <b>nose</b> design was capable to recover about 40 % of the lift loss due the omitted slat. The final acoustic results in terms of source noise levels are an overall 4 dB noise reduction for the long chord slat and about 6 dB noise reduction in case of the <b>droop</b> <b>nose.</b> The obtained aerodynamic and acoustic characteristics were finally transposed to flight in order to assess the effect on community noise which can be expressed in terms of noise iso-contour areas. Regarding the 60 dB(A) and the 65 dB(A) noise iso contour areas the achieved benefit is a reduction of up to 40 % of the respective area’s size...|$|R
