30|$|We require every sensor to {{indicate}} how much bandwidth it needs. The bandwidth request is split into the number of <b>full</b> <b>slots</b> and a fractional representation of a slot. The fraction {{of the number of}} <b>full</b> <b>slots</b> over the total number of slots in a frame is represented by means of Egyptian Fractions, where the denominators are a power of two. By means of a binary tree, each unit fraction is fit into a certain slot. The selection of slots ensures that collisions are avoided. The fractional representation of a slot, which is also an Egyptian Fraction, is scheduled by means of a binary tree. The resulting allocation indicates in which frame the slot may be used. This scheme leads to a schedule that is cyclic, which cycle length is determined by the lowest fraction in the approximations. As can be noticed, this protocol is not work conserving, as the time that no slots are scheduled, can be used to put the sensors to sleep.|$|R

However, reopening was first delayed to January 2015, then summer 2015, and then pushed into 2016. The delays were attributed to a combination of factors: the need for construction to proceed carefully and the difficulties in obtaining financing. The company obtained a $29 million loan in November 2014 that allowed construction to begin. [...] An additional $20 million equity line of credit is also financing the project.|$|E

40|$|Abstract We {{consider}} a simple automatic warehousing sytem {{with a lot}} of storage spaces called slots in which only a single type of items are stored and retrieved. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to develop an efficient method for obtaining the marginal probability that each of the slots in the warehouse is full. The set of such probabilities for all the slots constitutes the spatial inventory distribution of the items in the system. This distribution, which we call the inventory distribution in short, enables us to evaluate key performance characteristics of the system such as the mean travel time of a crane for a single operation of storage or retrieval of items. Such characteristics cannot be obtained from the distribution of the total number of <b>full</b> <b>slots</b> alone. We assume that inventories are controlled by an (S, S) reordering policy, and that received items are stored from the closest open slot to an 110 point and retrieved items are chosen randomly among currently <b>full</b> <b>slots.</b> Furthermore the time between retrievals and the time between placing of order and receipt of items are exponentially distributed. Under these assumptions the system can be modeled as a Markov chain. If we use joint inventory levels of slots, the number of states of the Markov chain amounts t o 2 m, where m is the total number of slots. Here we devise exact aggregation methods of the states to reduce the size of the Markov chain. By exploiting the special structure the total computational complexity for obtaining the inventory distribution is reduced to 0 (m 4). 1...|$|R

30|$|In principle, {{whenever}} the heating state changes, the DEWH will either start or stop preheating. Before {{the start of}} a preheating phase (Hi=MIN), the DEWH will heat as late as possible and thus heats the demand of the slot to maintain minimum temperature and only preheats when heating the <b>full</b> <b>slot</b> is insufficient. At {{the start of a}} preheating phase (Hi=MAX) the heating rate will be at a maximum level, e.g. heating the <b>full</b> <b>slot</b> (hi= 1). However, the actual heating rate depends on the maximum required temperature, which depends on the demand of later slots and also on later heating states {{as well as on the}} effective price (13).|$|E

30|$|Both wire {{types in}} this {{experiment}} were ligated with elastic ligatures. The effect of elastic/metal ligation type {{is not expected to}} influence torque magnitude in <b>full</b> <b>slot</b> size wires and in the 0.018 [*]×[*] 0.025  in. steel archwire in the 0.018 -in. slot system. However, for the 0.019 [*]×[*] 0.025  in. steel wire in the 0.022 -in. slot, the measured moment with elastic ligation could be 20  % lower than with metal ligation at 5 °– 15 ° of torque, since the archwire may not completely seat during torquing [44]. The 0.120 -in. elastic ligatures presenting high seating force were used {{in this experiment}} in order to ensure the initial seating of the archwire with consistent and similar ligation forces between the different bracket systems [45, 46]. Unfortunately, the main disadvantage of the elastic ligatures still remains their rapid force loss—which could exceed 50  % in 24  h—and consequently, this fact makes the engagement of the wire into the slot flexible and incomplete. In cases of maximum torque demands, steel ligatures should be preferred to provide increased torque expression [2, 45].|$|E
