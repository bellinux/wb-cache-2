40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were: 1) to describe supplement consumption pattern on under-five children, 2) to describe mothers perception about supplement <b>health</b> <b>claim</b> and benefits for under-five children. 3) to analyze the factors that influence mother's perception about supplement <b>health</b> <b>claim</b> and benefits and 4) to analyze the relationship between mothers perception about supplement <b>health</b> <b>claim</b> and benefits with supplement consumption on under-five children. This study conducted in Public kindergarten "Pembina" at Jemurwonosari street JN/TK, Surabaya regency. 71 mothers of under-five children were selected as respondents. The data about respondent and family characteristics, supplement consumption pattern, mother's perception about supplement <b>health</b> <b>claim</b> and benefits, the factors that have relationship with mother's perception and supplement consumption were collected by using open-closed questionnaire. The factors that have relationship with mother's perception about supplement <b>health</b> <b>claim</b> and benefits analyzed by using logistic regression test. The factors that have relation with supplement consumption were mother's perception and supplement consumption on under-five children identitied by using Chi-square test.

40|$|This paper {{concerns}} the procedure {{and the scientific}} approach to obtain market authorization for a microorganism {{to be recognized as}} a novel food with a <b>health</b> <b>claim.</b> Microorganisms that have not been traditionally used during food production in Europe prior to 1997 are considered as novel foods, which should undergo an in-depth characterization and safety assessment before being authorized on the European market. If a novel food bacterium is claimed to provide a beneficial effect on <b>health,</b> these <b>claims</b> must also be investigated before they can be authorized. Some requirements to obtain novel food certification are shared with those required to obtain a <b>health</b> <b>claim.</b> Although regulation exists that deals with these issues for foods in general, bacteria in food raise a specific set of questions that are only minimally addressed in official documentation. We propose a framework and suggest a list of criteria that should be assessed to obtain marketing authorization and <b>health</b> <b>claim</b> for a bacterium in accordance with European health policy...|$|R
