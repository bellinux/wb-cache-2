Exploiting a large opening, Kaepernick held onto the ball and ran it into the end zone to narrow Maryland's lead to one touchdown, 42–35, with 2:19remaining. Jaekle attempted an onside kick in an effort to give Nevada another chance on offense, but the ball was recovered by Maryland receiver Danny Oquendo. Scott rushed for two and then 19yards. With the first down, Maryland <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> run out the clock and clinch the 42–35victory.|$|E
5|$|The assault started around 16:00. The left column {{suffered}} significant casualties, but reached Fort 74, {{only to be}} met by Polish reinforcements dispatched by General Antoni Wroniecki, {{the commanding}} officer of this sector. Two thousand Russians clashed with less than 850 Poles inside the fort, but were defeated in a bayonet charge and had to retreat. As the attack failed and the Polish artillery batteries were still active, von Toll decided to use his cavalry reserves. Two regiments of the 3rd Cuirassier Division (1,200 cavalry) followed a road linking Szczęśliwice and Czyste, and were ordered to charge the Polish artillery from behind. The Poles had full visibility of the battlefield and <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> prepare for the attack, as the Russian advance slowed down due to swampy terrain. When the Russian cavalry switched from columns to battle line, Polish artillery opened canister shot fire on the Russians, dispersing them. The Russian commander reorganised his forces and repeated the charge, but the Russians were again repelled before reaching the Polish artillery emplacements. The Novgorod Cuirassier Regiment alone lost over 200 men out of 450 {{taking part in the}} charge.|$|E

It is a matter of debate whether Beeching left by mutual arrangement with the government or if he was sacked. Frank Cousins, the Labour Minister of Technology, told the House of Commons in November 1965 that Beeching had been dismissed by Tom Fraser. Beeching denied this, pointing out that he had returned early to ICI as he would not have <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> undertake an in-depth transport study before the formal end of his secondment.|$|E

30|$|Also in Table  4, we {{summarize}} teachers’ self-report {{data from}} the survey on prompts related <b>to</b> <b>having</b> <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> plan for all their content areas, to plan for mathematics or science instruction, to investigate additional resources, and to meet with other teachers about mathematics or science instruction. The first of these factors is significant for both mathematics and science, such that specialists are more likely <b>to</b> report <b>having</b> <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> plan {{for all of the}} subjects they teach. It is important to recognize that, even for these specialists, the mean is low, less than 3 for both content areas on a 1 – 6 scale. In mathematics, EMS are significantly more likely <b>to</b> report <b>having</b> <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> plan for their mathematics instruction. Although not statistically significant, specialists also are more likely <b>to</b> report <b>having</b> <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> investigate additional resources related to their mathematics or science instruction. Thus, the specialists’ indications of having more specialized content-focused planning time and the affordances that this provides are supported by the self-report survey data.|$|R
25|$|After {{several months}} of recuperating from Eylau, Napoleon ordered the Grande Armée on the move once again. Learning that the Russians had encamped at their {{operational}} base {{in the town of}} Heilsberg, by the Alle River, Napoleon decided to conduct a general assault in the hopes of dislodging what he thought was the rearguard of the Russian army. In fact, the French ran into the entire Russian army of over 50,000 men and 150 artillery guns. Repeated and determined attacks by the French failed to dislocate the Russians, who were fighting inside elaborate earthworks designed to prevent precisely the kind of river crossing Napoleon was attempting. French casualties soared to 10,000 while the Russians lost about 6,000. The Russians eventually withdrew from Heilsberg as their position became untenable, prompting Napoleon to chase after them once again. The French headed in the direction of Königsberg to gain additional supplies and provisions. On June 13, the advance guard of Marshal Lannes reported seeing large numbers of Russian troops at the town of Friedland. Both sides engaged one another {{for the remainder of the}} day with no result. Crucially, Bennigsen believed he <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> cross the Alle the following day, to destroy the isolated units of Lannes, and to withdraw back across the river without ever encountering the main French army.|$|E
25|$|As {{the network}} had {{thirteen}} months until its contract with KDFW ended—on July 1, 1995—to {{find a new}} affiliate in the Metroplex, CBS <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> seek other stations {{to reach an agreement}} with. The network first approached NBC affiliate KXAS-TV; however, its then-owner LIN Broadcasting ultimately declined CBS's offer. WFAA was eliminated as an option as its owner during that time, Belo, would reach a new long-term agreement with ABC for its Dallas flagship station and other ABC-affiliated stations that the group owned. This left KTVT, an independent station, as CBS's only viable option in the Dallas–Fort Worth market for it to affiliate with a VHF television station. The two parties would come to a deal on September 14, 1994, when Gaylord Broadcasting reached a ten-year affiliation agreement with CBS to transfer the network to KTVT (Gaylord and CBS also signed an affiliation agreement in which KSTW in Tacoma, Washington, also an independent station, would replace KIRO-TV as the CBS affiliate for the Seattle market). Time Warner, majority owner of The WB, filed several lawsuits in attempts to block the Gaylord-CBS affiliation deal and enforce an alleged contract with Gaylord to affiliate with The WB. The WB later reached an agreement with KDAF, which Fox Television Stations had announced it would sell in order to affiliate KDFW with the Fox network; KXTX-TV, in the meantime, agreed to serve as The WB's Metroplex charter affiliate in a temporary arrangement until the sale of KDAF to Renaissance Broadcasting and Fox's subsequent move to KDFW was finalized.|$|E
500|$|Post-production was {{severely}} delayed when Gilliam {{disagreed with the}} Weinsteins over the final cut privilege. In the meantime, the conflict lasted so long that Gilliam <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> shoot another feature film, Tideland. To create the visual effects, Gilliam awarded the shots to Peerless Camera, the London-based effects studio he founded in the late-1970s with visual effects supervisor Kent Houston. However, two months into filming, Houston said that Peerless [...] "ran {{into a number of}} major issues with The Brothers Grimm and with the Weinstein Brothers". He continued that [...] "the main problem {{was the fact that the}} number of effects shots had dramatically increased, mainly because of issues that arose during shooting with the physical effects." [...] Meanwhile, the Queen's chamber inside the tower was actually built by the Art Department as 2 sets. One set was resplendent and new while the other was old and decrepit. The sets were joined to each other by the central mirror, a piece of transparent glass giving the illusion that a single set was reflected and used to create the effect.|$|E

500|$|Aronofsky had {{the idea}} for The Wrestler for over a decade. He hired Robert D. Siegal to turn his idea into a script. The actor Nicolas Cage entered {{negotiations}} in October 2007 to star as Randy, the film's protagonist. The following month Cage left the project, and Mickey Rourke replaced him in the lead role. Aronofsky said that Cage {{pulled out of the}} movie because Aronofsky wanted Rourke to star; Aronofsky said, stating that Cage was [...] "a complete gentleman, and he understood that my heart was with Mickey and he stepped aside. I have so much respect for Nic Cage as an actor and I think it really could have worked with Nic but, you know, Nic was incredibly supportive of Mickey and he is old friends with Mickey and really wanted to help with this opportunity, so he pulled himself out of the race." [...] Cage responded, [...] "I wasn't quote 'dropped' from the movie. I resigned from the movie because I didn't think I <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> achieve the look of the wrestler who was on steroids, which I would never do".

500|$|Grönholm was {{disappointed}} with his race, admitting {{that he thought}} {{he might be able to}} beat Sordo, if not Loeb. But after having gearbox and tyre problems on , he settled into third place and stayed in that position to the rally's conclusion. [...] "We got it wrong on the tyre choice, which we had to have approved by the FIA early in the week," [...] he explained. [...] "We thought it would rain. Harder tyres would have made life easier for us." [...] BP-Ford was also unhappy. Christian Loriaux, the team's Technical Director said, [...] "Having Marcus finish behind Sordo is disappointing. Being behind Loeb is easier to understand, because I didn't expect the C4 to be any slower than the Xsara, and that car had a performance edge over us last year." [...] Petter Solberg also had issues with his tyres throughout the rally. After Subaru switched to es from Pirelli following the 2006 season, and with the shortest break between seasons the WRC had seen, the crews had not <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> test the new compounds. The Subarus had had their problems with the Pirellis, too. To protect them from breaking up too quickly the drivers had learned how to look after them, but driving that way on the new brand meant that he could not get the BFs up to temperature and ended up running slower. He finished the rally in sixth place. His teammate Atkinson did not have that problem though, and after fighting with Hirvonen in the final half of the rally, finished in fourth place. [...] "It's been a massive battle, and so much fun to be in a battle with these guys again," [...] he said after being congratulated by Hirvonen. Two drivers in non-manufacturer cars, Gardemeister and Kopecký, finished in seventh and eighth place to receive drivers points.|$|E
