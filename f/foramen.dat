5|$|Due to its {{distinctive}} position, the <b>foramen</b> {{is used as}} an anatomical landmark during neurosurgery. As a landmark, the <b>foramen</b> spinosum reveals the positions of other cranial foramina, the mandibular nerve and trigeminal ganglion, <b>foramen</b> ovale, and <b>foramen</b> rotundum. It may also be relevant in achieving haemostasis during trauma surgery.|$|E
5|$|In the newborn, the <b>foramen</b> spinosum {{is about}} 2.25mm long and in adults about 2.56mm. The {{width of the}} <b>foramen</b> extends from 1.05mm to about 2.1mm in adults. The average {{diameter}} of the <b>foramen</b> spinosum is 2.63mm in adults.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} perfect ring-shaped {{formation of}} the <b>foramen</b> spinosum was observed in the eighth month after birth and the latest seven years after birth in a developmental study of the <b>foramen</b> rotundum, <b>foramen</b> ovale and <b>foramen</b> spinosum. The majority of the foramina in the skull studies were round in shape. The sphenomandibular ligament, derived from the first pharyngeal arch and usually attached to {{the spine of the}} sphenoid bone, may be found attached to the rim of the <b>foramen.</b>|$|E
5|$|The <b>foramen</b> spinosum is a <b>foramen</b> {{through the}} sphenoid bone {{situated}} in the middle cranial fossa. It {{is one of two}} foramina in the greater wing of the sphenoid bone. The <b>foramen</b> ovale is one of these two cranial foramina, situated directly anterior and medial to the <b>foramen</b> spinosum. The spine of sphenoid falls medial and posterior to the <b>foramen.</b> Lateral to the <b>foramen</b> is the mandibular fossa, and posterior is the Eustachian tube.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the fifth}} week, {{there is an}} opening in the fetal heart known as the <b>foramen</b> ovale. The <b>foramen</b> ovale allowed blood in the fetal heart to pass {{directly}} from the right atrium to the left atrium, allowing some blood to bypass the lungs. Within seconds after birth, a flap of tissue known as the septum primum that previously acted as a valve closes the <b>foramen</b> ovale and establishes the typical cardiac circulation pattern. A depression in the surface of the right atrium remains where the <b>foramen</b> ovale once walls, called the fossa ovalis.|$|E
5|$|The <b>foramen</b> spinosum {{is one of}} two {{foramina}} {{located in}} the base of the human skull, on the sphenoid bone. It is situated just anterior to the spine of the sphenoid bone, and just lateral to the <b>foramen</b> ovale. The middle meningeal artery, middle meningeal vein, and the meningeal branch of the mandibular nerve pass through the <b>foramen.</b>|$|E
5|$|The <b>foramen</b> spinosum {{varies in}} size and location. The <b>foramen</b> is rarely absent, usually unilaterally, {{in which case the}} middle meningeal artery enters the cranial cavity through the <b>foramen</b> ovale. It may be incomplete, which may occur in almost half of the population. Conversely, in a {{minority}} of cases (less than 1%), it may also be duplicated, particularly when the middle meningeal artery is also duplicated.|$|E
5|$|The entepicondylar <b>foramen</b> is absent, as in {{all members}} of the Sigmodontinae; if present, as in some other rodents, this <b>foramen</b> (opening) {{perforates}} the distal (far) end of the humerus (upper arm bone). The pelvis and the bones of the hindlimbs are heavily built. The femoral tubercle of the acetabulum (part of the pelvis), which anchors the rectum femoris muscle, is reduced relative to Holochilus and Lundomys.|$|E
5|$|The fibres of {{the spinal}} {{accessory}} nerve originate solely in neurons {{situated in the}} upper spinal cord, from where the spinal cord begins at the junction with the medulla oblongata, {{to the level of}} about C6. These fibres join together to form rootlets, roots, and finally the spinal accessory nerve itself. The formed nerve enters the skull through the <b>foramen</b> magnum, the large opening at the skull's base. The nerve travels along the inner wall of the skull towards the jugular <b>foramen.</b> Leaving the skull, the nerve travels through the jugular <b>foramen</b> with the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves. The spinal accessory nerve is notable for being the only cranial nerve to both enter and exit the skull. This is due to it being unique among the cranial nerves in having neurons in the spinal cord.|$|E
5|$|The <b>foramen</b> may {{pass through}} the sphenoid bone {{at the apex of}} the spinous process, or along its medial surface.|$|E
5|$|The <b>foramen</b> spinosum {{permits the}} passage of the middle meningeal artery, middle meningeal vein, and the meningeal branch of the mandibular nerve.|$|E
5|$|As {{usual in}} oryzomyines, 12 ribs are present. The first rib articulates {{with both the}} last {{cervical}} (neck) and first thoracic (chest) vertebrae, a synapomorphy of the Sigmodontinae. The anapophyses, processes {{at the back of}} vertebrae, are absent from the fifth lumbar. Between the second and third caudal vertebrae, hemal arches (small bones) are present with a spinous back border. The entepicondylar <b>foramen</b> is absent, as in all members of the Sigmodontinae; if present, as in some other rodents, this <b>foramen</b> perforates the distal end of the humerus.|$|E
5|$|Earlier {{analyses}} {{had shown}} Kentrosaurus closer {{in the tree}} to Stegosaurus. Basal traits include a prominent paraquadratic <b>foramen</b> at the quadrate in the skull; maxillary teeth with only seven denticles at the margin; and a shoulder spine.|$|E
5|$|Forming {{the sides}} {{of the back of the}} skull is the exoccipital, which {{surrounds}} most of the <b>foramen</b> magnum. The Eustachian tube extends downwards across the basoccipital and basisphenoid; these bones are thickened on either side of the tube in K. langenbergensis. K. guimarotae has a small rounded <b>foramen</b> beside the tube on the basoccipital, and a tuberosity bearing a ridge above. On the front of the basoccipital in both species, there are two rounded depressions near the bottom. The basisphenoid resembles a triangular hatchet in shape when viewed from the side.|$|E
5|$|In {{other great}} apes, the <b>foramen</b> spinosum is found {{not in the}} sphenoid bone but {{in parts of the}} {{temporal}} bone such as the squamous part, found at the sphenosquamosal suture, or absent.|$|E
5|$|On the mandible, the {{diastema}} is {{very large}} and the incisor is procumbent (projecting forward), which distinguishes Apeomyoides from most eomyids apart from Megapeomys. There is a masseteric scar (associated with the jaw muscles) from below the m1 forward to a point in front of p4, below the mental <b>foramen,</b> {{an opening in the}} jawbone. In Apeomys and Megapeomys this scar only reaches {{to the level of the}} front root of p4. The mental <b>foramen</b> is very small and opens in the diastema, near the ventral shelf of the scar; in Apeomys and Megapeomys it is located near the dorsal shelf. Further foramina are present on the lingual (inner) surface of the bone, below the cheekteeth.|$|E
5|$|The <b>foramen</b> spinosum {{is often}} used as a {{landmark}} in neurosurgery, due to its close relations with other cranial foramina. It was first described by Jakob Benignus Winslow in the 18th century.|$|E
5|$|The maxillary {{division}} of the trigeminal nerve (V2) passes through <b>foramen</b> rotundum in the sphenoid bone to supply {{the skin of the}} middle of the face.|$|E
5|$|The pudendal nerve passes {{between the}} {{piriformis}} muscle and coccygeus (ischiococcygeus) muscles {{and leaves the}} pelvis through {{the lower part of}} the greater sciatic <b>foramen.</b> It crosses over the lateral part of the sacrospinous ligament and reenters the pelvis through the lesser sciatic <b>foramen.</b> After reentering the pelvis, it accompanies the internal pudendal artery and internal pudendal vein upwards and forwards along the lateral wall of the ischiorectal fossa, being contained in a sheath of the obturator fascia termed the pudendal canal, along with the internal pudendal blood vessels.|$|E
5|$|The stapes {{develops}} {{from the}} second pharyngeal arch during the sixth to eighth week of embryological life. The central cavity of the stapes, the obturator <b>foramen,</b> {{is due to the}} presence embryologically of the stapedial artery, which usually regresses.|$|E
5|$|The ulnar styloid process (a {{projection}} on the ulna, one of {{the bones}} of the forearm, where it meets the wrist) is not as hooked as in other lorisids, according to Schwartz, which Groves suggests may indicate that the wrist is more mobile. Another alleged diagnostic feature is the presence of an entepicondylar <b>foramen</b> (an opening near the distal, or far, end of the bone) on the humerus (upper arm bone); however, Sarmiento found this feature in 4 out of 11 specimens, and on one side of a fifth, and Stump noted that the <b>foramen</b> occurred in specimens from across the potto's range.|$|E
5|$|Compared to E.nitidus and E.macconnelli, {{the skull}} is {{relatively}} small and slender. It has broad and short incisive foramina (perforations of the palate between the incisors and the molars) and lacks sphenopalatine vacuities which perforate the mesopterygoid fossa, the gap behind {{the end of the}} palate. The animal is similar to other members of the genus in the pattern of the arteries of the head. The alisphenoid strut, an extension of the alisphenoid bone which separates two foramina (openings) in the skull (the masticatory-buccinator <b>foramen</b> and the <b>foramen</b> ovale accessorium) is rarely present; its presence is more frequent in E.nitidus. The capsular process, a raising of the bone of the mandible (lower jaw) behind the third molar, houses the back end of the lower incisor in most Euryoryzomys, but is absent in E.emmonsae and E.macconnelli. Traits of the teeth {{are similar to those of}} E.nitidus and other Euryoryzomys.|$|E
5|$|In their {{descriptions}} of Plesiorycteropus, Lamberton and Patterson posited different {{interpretations of the}} location of the mandibular fossa, where the mandible (lower jaw) articulates with the cranium. MacPhee found problems with either interpretation and suggested that the true mandibular fossa was part of the area Lamberton identified as such, {{at the side of the}} braincase. The fossa is small and low, suggesting that the animal was not capable of powerful biting. At the back of this fossa is a pseudoglenoid proces, which is more prominent in P.germainepetterae. In P.germainepetterae but not P.madagascariensis, a small opening, perhaps the vascular <b>foramen,</b> is present next to the <b>foramen</b> ovale. The petrosal bone forms a relatively large portion of the roof of the tympanic cavity, which houses the middle ear; parts of the petrosal are more developed in P.madagascariensis. Endocasts (casts of the inside of the skull) indicate that the neopallium part of the brain was relatively small.|$|E
5|$|Paley {{considers}} {{how some}} structures {{are seen to}} be prepared for future function, like the milk-teeth of a baby, ready formed inside the gums at birth. Similarly, the circulation of the foetus is supported by temporary short-circuits with the <b>foramen</b> ovale and the ductus arteriosus, as the lungs are not yet in use for breathing.|$|E
5|$|The King Island emu and the {{mainland}} emu show few morphological differences {{other than their}} significant difference in size. Mathews stated that the legs and bill were shorter than those of {{the mainland}} emu, yet the toes were nearly of equal length, and therefore proportionally longer. The tarsus of the King Island emu was also three times longer than the culmen, whereas it was four times longer in the mainland emu. Additional traits that supposedly distinguish this bird from the mainland emu have previously been suggested to be the distal <b>foramen</b> of the tarsometatarsus, and the contour of the cranium. However, the distal <b>foramen</b> is known to be variable in the mainland emu showing particular diversity between juvenile and adult forms and is therefore taxonomically insignificant. The same is true of the contour of the cranium, which is more dome-shaped in the King Island emu, a feature that is also seen in juvenile mainland emus.|$|E
5|$|The {{back margin}} of the {{zygomatic}} plate is located close {{to the front of}} the upper first molar. The incisive foramina do not extend between the molars. Unlike in both Holochilus and Lundomys, the palate is flat, lacking a distinct ridge at the midline. The parapterygoid fossae, which are located behind the palate at the level of the molars, are excavated somewhat above the level of the palate. A strut of the alisphenoid bone is present, separating two openings in the skull, the masticatory–buccinator <b>foramen</b> and the <b>foramen</b> ovale accessorium. The subsquamosal fenestra, an opening at the back of the skull determined by the shape of the squamosal, is present but small. The squamosal probably lacks a suspensory process that contacts the tegmen tympani, the roof of the tympanic cavity, a defining character of oryzomyines.|$|E
5|$|The maxilla (upper jaw) {{is known}} only for A.donovani. In these fossils, the back {{margin of the}} incisive <b>foramen</b> (an opening in the palate) is about {{at the same level}} as the front of M1, and the back margin of the {{zygomatic}} plate (a bony plate {{at the side of the}} skull, connected to the zygomatic arch) is also close to the front of M1. Mandibles (lower jaws) of both species are known. The mental <b>foramen</b> (an opening in the front of the jaw bone) opens towards the labial side of the bone, except in one mandible of A.praeuniversitatis, in which its opening is located higher. There is a well-developed capsular process—a raising in the bone that houses the root of the lower incisor. The masseteric ridges (two ridges on the labial side of the bone that anchor some of the chewing muscles) are joined into a single crest towards the front and reach to a point below the front of m1.|$|E
5|$|The nasal and premaxillary bones do {{not extend}} back beyond {{the point where}} the lacrimal, frontal, and maxillary bones meet. The {{zygomatic}} plate, the flattened front part of the zygomatic arch, is broad and develops a notch at its front end. The plate's back margin is located before the first upper molar. The jugal bone, part of the zygomatic arch, is reduced, as usual in oryzomyines. The sphenopalatine <b>foramen,</b> a <b>foramen</b> (opening) {{at the side of the}} skull above the molars, is small; it is much larger in the marsh rice rat. The narrowest part of the interorbital region is towards the front and the edges are lined by prominent shelves. The parietal bones extend to the sides of the braincase. The interparietal bone is narrow and wedge-shaped, so that the parietal and squamosal bones meet extensively.|$|E
5|$|The premaxillary bones {{each house}} a single incisor, {{which is located}} at the front tip. They end in a V shape at the front margin and in a narrow point at the back margin. Inside each premaxilla is a large opening, the {{anterior}} palatal <b>foramen.</b> The maxillary bone contains the other upper teeth. The mandible ranges from thin to robust and houses the lower teeth.|$|E
5|$|The root of {{the lower}} incisor is visible {{at the back of}} the {{mandible}} (lower jaw) as a slight protrusion; a true capsular process is absent. There are 13 thoracic (chest), 7 lumbar, 4 sacral, and 38 or 39 caudal (tail) vertebrae. The humerus (upper arm bone) lacks an entepicondylar <b>foramen.</b>|$|E
5|$|The skull shows a short {{front part}} (rostrum) {{and a broad}} interorbital region (located between the eyes). The roof of the braincase is marked by supraorbital shelves. The incisive foramina, which {{perforate}} the front part of the palate, are very broad and extend between the first molars. The zygomatic plates, the flattened anterior portions of the zygomatic arches (cheekbones), are expansive and show well-developed notches at their front ends. The palate itself is flat and ends a little behind the third molars. The posterolateral palatal pits, located near the third molars, are well developed. The mesopterygoid fossa, the opening behind {{the end of the}} palate, is rounded at the frond and broad. An extension of the alisphenoid bone known as the alisphenoid strut is usually present, separating two foramina (openings), the <b>foramen</b> ovale accessorium and the masticatory-buccinator <b>foramen.</b> The roof of the tympanic cavity, the tegmen tympani, is small.|$|E
5|$|The summer pelage of {{different}} subspecies varies drastically but is generally dark or cinnamon brown. The back is dull, yellowish, ochre-grey in colour, with dark brown to black {{tips of the}} hairs. The latus (side of the body between therib cageand theuppermost and largest part of the hip bone) is tinged with rust-red, and the underside is pale yellowish ochre. In winter, its pelage turns grey, with a yellowish tinge; the underside becomes greyish brown, and the anterior dorsum and head are tinged with yellow. The incisive <b>foramen</b> (funnel-shaped opening in the bonyplate of theskull, located in {{the roof of the}} mouth,immediately behind theincisor teethwhere blood vessels and nerves pass) are round, small, and are detached from the palatine <b>foramen.</b>|$|E
5|$|According to {{the initial}} description, the eye socket of Euchambersia is rather small. The {{branches}} of the postorbital and jugal that usually surround the back {{and bottom of the}} eye socket in therocephalians appear to be either very reduced or absent entirely. Meanwhile, the top of the eye socket is formed by the prefrontal, and the frontal is also small. The skull does not bear a pineal <b>foramen.</b> Like Whaitsia, the pterygoid and palatine of the palate are not separated from the transpalatine, further {{to the side of the}} jaw, by any sort of opening.|$|E
5|$|Apical abscesses {{can spread}} to involve {{periodontal}} pockets around a tooth, and periodontal pockets cause eventual pulp necrosis via accessory canals or the apical <b>foramen</b> {{at the bottom}} of the tooth. Such lesions are termed periodontic-endodontic lesions, and they may be acutely painful, sharing similar signs and symptoms with a periodontal abscess, or they may cause mild pain or no pain at all if they are chronic and free-draining. Successful root canal therapy is required before periodonal treatment is attempted. Generally, the long-term prognosis of perio-endo lesions is poor.|$|E
5|$|Hence, {{weakness}} of shrug {{on one side}} and head-turning on the other side may indicate damage to the accessory nerve {{on the side of the}} shrug weakness, or damage along the nerve pathway at the other side of the brain. Causes of damage may include trauma, surgery, tumours, and compression at the jugular <b>foramen.</b> Weakness in both muscles may point to a more general disease process such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Guillain-Barre syndrome or poliomyelitis.|$|E
5|$|In Kirkland's initial {{description}} of Eolambia, he considered {{it to be}} a member of the Hadrosauridae, as defined by David B. Weishampel, David B. Norman, and Dan Grigorescu in 1993. Weishampel and colleagues used seven unifying characteristics to define the Hadrosauridae: the upward expansion of the ascending process of the maxilla; the absence of the paraquadrate <b>foramen,</b> which separates the quadrate and quadratojugal; the location of the angular on the inner surface of the lower jaw; the absence of the surangular <b>foramen</b> on the surangular; the narrow teeth of the maxilla; the presence of three or more teeth in each dentary tooth position; and the reduction of the top margin of the scapular blade. The first, fifth, sixth, and seventh of these traits were recognized in Eolambia, with the rest being unknown due to missing material. Kirkland further assigned Eolambia to the Euhadrosauria, defined by Weishampel and colleagues to include the common ancestor of Hadrosaurinae (now the Saurolophinae) and Lambeosaurinae – the two primary branches of hadrosaurids – and all of its descendants. This assignment was based on five characteristics, all present in Eolambia: the presence of denticles on the premaxilla; the quadrate's narrow joint with the lower jaw; the narrow dentary teeth; the presence of a single edge, or carina, on each dentary tooth; and the angled deltopectoral crest on the humerus.|$|E
