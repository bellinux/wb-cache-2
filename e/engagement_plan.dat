By chance, an emergency motorized police unit, which usually serve as immediate reinforcement to police officers in the field, was conducting exercises not far from Uherský Brod. The unit arrived within twenty minutes of the first emergency call. Heavily armed and well trained, their officer in charge gave order to immediately engage the perpetrator. Within a minute, the local police station chief arrived and ordered them to stand down, began securing the perimeter, gathering information, and preparing an <b>engagement</b> <b>plan.</b> Meanwhile, [...] called the emergency line 158 and mentioned he had five unharmed hostages and was demanding the presence of TV Prima. The officer in charge ordered the policemen to stand down {{just as they were}} about to enter the building in order to start negotiating. At that time, he could not have been aware of the status of victims inside. Fifteen minutes later, the Zlín region police chief arrived. In total, the command over the operation was passed between five people within the initial 40 minutes. The fact that the police rules allow passing of command during engagement had been condemned a week earlier by Member of Parliament Stanislav Huml, who pointed out to the Czech firemen's rules, according to which the first person in charge at the place of engagement remains in charge even if a general happens to come to join an operation afterwards. He noted that the passing of command requires briefing which not only leads to loss of time, but often also to subsequent mistakes.|$|E

5000|$|To engage ground targets, PCAS-Ground {{comprises}} a {{smart power}} hub, customized Android tablet computer loaded with situational-awareness and mapping software, and a digital radio that altogether weigh only 5 lb, plus a laser-targeting device that weighs another 5 lb. When a JTAC identifies {{a target for}} attack, they create the [...] "nine-line" [...] <b>engagement</b> <b>plan</b> on the tablet and transmit the plan to the aircraft, {{with the ability to}} [...] "stack" [...] multiple identified targets. PCAS-Air software then evaluates and auto-populates the plan with whatever sensor and weapons data is available, sharing the information with PCAS-Ground to confirm the attack. The JTAC gets a countdown to weapons release, and can see an impact line as well as weapon damage radius; both aircrew and JTAC can see video of the target on their tablets, eliminating the need for the larger, dedicated ROVER laptops currently used by JTACs to view airborne video. PCAS makes it easier to accurately deploy weapons with smaller warheads for less collateral damage and gives [...] "Level 3" [...] control to JTACs to remotely steer airborne sensors if needed.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} {{and study the}} {{effectiveness}} of customer <b>engagement</b> <b>plans</b> that clearly specify the amount of intervention in customer 2 ̆ 7 s load settings by the grid operator for peak load reduction. We suggest {{two different types of}} plans, including constant deviation plans (CDPs) and proportional deviation plans (PDPs). We define an adjustable reference temperature for both CDPs and PDPs to limit the output temperature of each thermostat load and to control the number of devices eligible to participate in demand response program. We model thermostat loads as power throttling devices and design algorithms to evaluate the impact of power throttling states and plan parameters on peak load reduction. Based on the simulation results, we recommend PDPs to the customers of a residential community with variable thermostat set point preferences, while CDPs are suitable for customers with similar thermostat set point preferences. If thermostat loads have multiple power throttling states, customer <b>engagement</b> <b>plans</b> with less temperature deviations from thermostat set points are recommended. Contrary to classical ON/OFF control, higher temperature deviations are required to achieve similar amount of peak load reduction. Several other interesting tradeoffs and useful guidelines for designing mutually beneficial incentives for both the grid operator and customers can also be identified...|$|R
