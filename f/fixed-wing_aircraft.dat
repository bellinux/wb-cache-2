40|$|Abstract. The <b>fixed-wing</b> <b>aircrafts</b> rely {{mainly on}} thrust {{generated}} by engine and lift produced by wings to keep flying, {{so there are}} strict requirements on their speeds and angle of attack. The flappers can hover freely {{in the air like}} insects because they have different flight principles and forms compared with <b>fixed-wing</b> <b>aircrafts.</b> The flapper is consisted of the flapping-wing, the flapping-wing mechanism and the drive. The flapping-wing is used to generate lifts and thrusts while the wing mechanism and the drive provide main power to the flapping wing. Traditionally, flapper uses rigid wing to provide lift and thrust force. The researches of the insect flapping wing process indicate insect wings would produce certain flexibility and umbrella effect in this process. Based on the above research, the compression molding is employed to manufacture the bionic flexible wing in this article. What’s more, in order to imitate the umbrella deformations at the wing tips, IPMC (Ionic Polymer Metal-Composites) are fixed on the flexible wings to achieve umbrella deformations...|$|R
40|$|Unmanned aerial {{vehicles}} (UAVs) {{have been}} more and more widely used not only in military areas but also in civilian and commercial areas nowadays. UAVs could be categorized by <b>fixed-wing</b> <b>aircrafts</b> and rotor-crafts. In contrast with other <b>fixed-wing</b> <b>aircrafts,</b> the helicopters could take off and land vertically, to hover, and to fly forwards, backwards and laterally. Miniature helicopters are more agile and unstable than the full-size counterparts in the flight. Development of a reliable high-performance helicopter-based unmanned aerial vehicle requires an accurate and robust model that contains essential aerodynamic of the helicopter in typical flight conditions. This thesis presents a method of experimental setup and results of the dynamic modeling of a miniature unmanned helicopter (Trex- 500). Working from first principle and basic aerodynamics, the equations of motion for full six degree-of-freedom with flybar-degree of freedom are derived. The experiment is setup to test {{the thrust of the}} main rotor and verify the model structure in the hover condition...|$|R

5|$|Because of the {{difficulty}} and risk of meeting the Huaorani on the ground, the missionaries chose to drop gifts to the Huaorani by <b>fixed-wing</b> <b>aircraft.</b> Their drop technique, developed by Nate Saint, involved flying around the drop location in tight circles while lowering the gift from the plane on a rope.

50|$|A <b>fixed-wing</b> <b>aircraft's</b> wings, horizontal, and {{vertical}} stabilizers are built with airfoil-shaped cross sections, as are helicopter rotor blades. Airfoils {{are also found}} in propellers, fans, compressors and turbines. Sails are also airfoils, and the underwater surfaces of sailboats, such as the centerboard and keel, are similar in cross-section and operate on the same principles as airfoils. Swimming and flying creatures and even many plants and sessile organisms employ airfoils/hydrofoils: common examples being bird wings, the bodies of fish, and the shape of sand dollars. An airfoil-shaped wing can create downforce on an automobile or other motor vehicle, improving traction.|$|R
