The <b>epidemic</b> <b>risk</b> is quantified by the epidemic threshold of the SIRS model for the propagation of communicable diseases, i. e. the critical value of disease transmissibility above which the disease turns endemic.

Here, we first show how these discrepancies affect the prediction of the <b>epidemic</b> <b>risk</b> when these data are fed to numerical models of epidemic spread: low participation rate, under-reporting of contacts and overestimation of contact durations in contact diaries with respect to sensor data determine indeed important differences in the outcomes of the corresponding simulations with for instance an enhanced sensitivity to initial conditions.

40|$|The {{impact of}} climate {{variability}} {{and climate change}} on tickborne diseases in Chiredzi District was investigated. Ticks are responsible for several diseases (tickborne diseases) that significantly affect livestock, especially cattle. The treatment of tickborne diseases and the resulting secondary infections result in very high economic losses in cattle production. Ticks attach themselves on the cattle and this causes irritation and this affects the feeding of cattle resulting in reduced milk production and poor meat quality. Several methods have been developed in tick control, however a more climate based method is required especially where climate variability and change are significant. A climate based method if combined with the already present methods like the use of acaricides and vaccines allows better resource use and more efficient disease management. The research used historic climatic data provided by the Zimbabwe Meteorological Services Department (ZMSD). The data included total monthly precipitation, maximum and minimum temperature values. The data was used to construct time series graphs which showed that generally rainfall is on the decrease while temperature has increased for the periods 1965 / 66 â€“ 2007 / 08 and 1979 - 2007 respectively. Data on tickborne disease incidence {{was obtained from the}} Department of Veterinary Services Zimbabwe (DVSZ) as collected by local farmers at household level. Downscaled climate data from Global climate models were used to make future climatic prediction for the period 2046 - 2065 using the Climate Change Explorer Tool. Regression analyses as well as RMSE analysis were done to assess model efficiency. The models performed better in predicting minimum and maximum temperatures with R 2 values of about 0. 80 and 0. 6 respectively. However the models were very poor in predicting rainfall values.

40|$|Chikungunya is a mosquito-borne viral {{infection}} of humans that previously {{was confined to}} regions in central Africa. However, during this century, the virus has shown surprising potential for geographic expansion as it invaded other countries including more temperate regions. With no vaccine and no specific treatment, the main control strategy for Chikungunya remains preventive control of mosquito populations. In consideration for the risk of Chikungunya introduction to the US, we developed a model for disease introduction based on virus introduction by one individual. Our study combines a climate-based mosquito population dynamics stochastic model with an epidemiological model to identify temporal windows that have <b>epidemic</b> <b>risk.</b> We ran this model with temperature data from different locations to study the geographic sensitivity of epidemic potential. We found that in locations with marked seasonal variation in temperature there also was a season of <b>epidemic</b> <b>risk</b> matching {{the period of the}} year in which mosquito populations survive and grow. In these locations controlling mosquito population sizes might be an efficient strategy. But, in other locations where the temperature supports mosquito development all year the <b>epidemic</b> <b>risk</b> is high and (practically) constant. In these locations, mosquito population control alone might not be an efficient disease control strategy and other approaches should be implemented to complement it. Our results strongly suggest that, {{in the event of an}} introduction and establishment of Chikungunya in the US, endemic and epidemic regions would emerge initially, primarily defined by environmental factors controlling annual mosquito population cycles. These regions should be identified to plan different intervention measures. In addition, reducing vector: human ratios can lower the probability and magnitude of outbreaks for regions with strong seasonal temperature patterns. This is the first model to consider Chikungunya risk in the US and can be applied to other vector borne diseases...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Entities in the Internet, {{ranging from}} {{individuals}} and enterprises to service providers, face {{a broad range}} of <b>epidemic</b> <b>risks</b> such as worms, viruses, and botnet-driven attacks. Those risks are interdependent risks, which means that the decision by an entity to invest in security and self-protect affects the risk faced by others (for example, the risk faced by an individual decreases when its providers increases its investments in security). As a result of this, entities tend to invest too little in self-protection, relative to the socially efficient level, by ignoring benefits conferred on by others. In this paper, we consider the problem of designing incentives to entities in the Internet so that they invest at a socially efficient level. In particular, we find that insurance is a powerful incentive mechanism which pushes agents to invest in self-protection. Thus, insurance increases the level of self-protection, and therefore the level of security, in the Internet. As a result, we believe that insurance should be considered as an important component of risk management in the Internet. I...|$|R

Therefore, phlebotomine captures were performed throughout this region and an analysis of the distribution of reported ACL cases was conducted in order to assess the vector diversity in ACL endemic and epidemic scenarios in the Chaco region. The results support the hypothesis of two distinct patterns: (1) the DC, where Lutzomyia migonei was the most prevalent species, had isolated ACL cases and a zoonotic cycle; (2) the HC, where Lutzomyia neivai was the most prevalent species, had an increase in ACL incidence and outbreaks and an anthropozoonotic cycle.

In this paper, we study source location from a deterministic point of view by modeling it as the minimum weighted doubly resolving set (DRS) problem, which is a strengthening of the well-known metric dimension problem.

A vertex subset S of G is DRS of G if for every pair of vertices u,v in G, there exist x,y∈ S such that the difference of distances (in terms of number of edges) between u and x,y is not equal to the difference of distances between v and x,y. The minimum weighted DRS problem consists of finding a DRS in G with minimum total weight. We establish Θ(n) approximability of the minimum DRS problem on general graphs for both weighted and unweighted versions.

40|$|Purpose - Holistic {{approaches}} {{to public health}} such as ‘One Health’ emphasize the interconnectedness between people, animals, ecosystems, and <b>epidemic</b> <b>risk,</b> and many advocate for this philosophy to be adopted within disaster risk management (DRM). Historically, animal and human diseases have been managed separately from each other, and apart from other hazards considered for DRM. Shifts in DRM, however, may complement a One Health approach. The taxonomy of hazards considered under DRM has expanded to include medical and social crises such as epizootics and terrorism. However, there is a gap in understanding how <b>epidemic</b> <b>risk</b> is integrated into DRM at the community-level. Approach - TACTIC adopts a participatory case study approach examining preparedness for multiple hazard types (floods, epidemics, earthquakes, and terrorism) at the community-level. This article reports on findings from the epidemic case study which took as its focus the 2001 Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD) epidemic in the UK because of the diverse human, social, and environmental impacts of this ‘animal’ disease. Findings - Epizootic preparedness tends to focus on biosecurity and phytosanitary measures, and is geared towards agriculture and farming. Greater engagement with public health and behavioral sciences to manage public health impacts of animal disease epidemics, and activities for citizen engagement to improve preparedness are discussed. The impermeability of boundaries (hazard, institutional, disciplinary, etc.) is a key constraint to integrating One Health into DRM.

To reduce the probability of risk, an Internet user generally invests in self-defense mechanisms like antivirus and antispam software. However, such software does not completely eliminate risk. Recent works have considered the problem of residual risk elimination by proposing the idea of cyber-insurance. In this regard, an important decision for Internet users is their amount of investment in self-defense mechanisms when insurance solutions are offered. In this paper, we investigate the problem of self-defense investments in the Internet, under full and partial cyber-insurance coverage models. By the term ‘self-defense investment’, we mean the monetary-cum-precautionary cost that each user needs to invest in employing risk mitigating self-defense mechanisms, given that it is fully or partially insured by the Internet insurance agencies. We propose a general mathematical framework by which co-operative and non-co-operative Internet users can {{decide whether or not}} to invest in self-defense for ensuring both, individual and social welfare.

State of the art discussions pointed towards little attention being paid to crisis risk management in EU agriculture and the incompleteness of risk management instruments available. Proposed solutions, although not entirely agreed upon by all workshop participants, envision some form of public¿private partnership. For technology risks, which are rather'manageable' by individual farmers, partnerships are recommended to be a mix of regulation, risk mitigation and non-subsidised market instruments with a clear focus on incentives for risk prevention. For weather risks, these partnerships include financial aspects whereby governments offer free cover for the catastrophic part of losses. The Income Stabilisation project will integrate workshop recommendations with wider research project activities and will eventually advise on prospective risk management instruments for various farm types and regions throughout the European Union...|$|R
