The simulation results showed the <b>exhaust</b> <b>rate</b> hav-ing two V-type fluctuations, whereas the semi-empirical method shows the <b>exhaust</b> <b>rate</b> having only one V-type fluctuation.

This is because fume hoods contribute to the achievement of lab spaces' required air exchange rates. Put another way, savings from closing fume hoods can only be achieved when fume hood <b>exhaust</b> <b>rates</b> are greater than the air exchange rate needed to achieve the required ventilation rate in the lab room. For example, in a lab room with a required air exchange rate of 2000 cubic feet per minute (CFM), if that room has just one fume hood which vents air {{at a rate of}} 1000 square feet per minute, then closing the sash on the fume hood will simply cause the lab room's air handler to increase from 1000 CFM to 2000 CFM, thus resulting in no net reduction in air <b>exhaust</b> <b>rates,</b> and thus no net reduction in energy consumption.|$|R

40|$|Mechanical {{smoke exhaust}} systems are usually {{required}} in big atria of the Far East. However, the design criteria are not clearly demonstrated {{to be worked}} out through systematic full-scale tests. There are many arguments on sizing the exhaust fans, and whether a high <b>exhaust</b> <b>rate</b> is required in an atrium is a puzzle. Atrium hot smoke tests might be required to be carried out occasionally to evaluate their performance, especially when the design does not comply with the prescriptive code in having a high-enough <b>exhaust</b> <b>rate.</b> Experimental studies on mechanical smoke exhaust systems are necessary and have been carried out. The results are reported in this paper. The measured results are also compared with the empirical equations used in designs, following NFPA- 92 B derived by a two-layer picture. A simple zone model reported earlier is applied to justify the results. This model is also developed based on a two-layer picture. There are significant deviations of the measured results from those predicted by the equations with a two-layer pattern. Mass exchange through the two layers in an atrium fire is suggested to be the key point. By taking the estimated mass flow rate across the two layers by experiments to be 30 % of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>rate</b> under high ventilation conditions, the two-layer zone model is modified.

40|$|Single-sided natural {{ventilation}} is an energy efficient ventilation strategy {{that could provide}} satisfactory indoor air quality and thermal comfort. However, one of its possible negative influences is the cross-infection between households due to the two-way airflow. The present study aims at assessing the efficacy of mechanical exhaust (ME) devices to eliminate this possible cross-infection. CFD method was employed to simulate the buoyancy driven single-sided {{natural ventilation}} and the cross-contamination. Different occupant behaviour scenarios, such as ME-on centrally or ME-on individually, were compared with the no-ME case. It is found that mechanical exhaust could reduce the outflow of indoor air and increase the inflow of fresh air. However, the weakened outflow {{tends to be more}} attached to the façade and the re-entry risk may be increased. As the <b>exhaust</b> <b>rate</b> is large enough, the two-way airflow will turn into one-way inflow, and accordingly the vertical cross-household infection can be avoided. With ME-on in both floors, a low <b>exhaust</b> <b>rate</b> of 5 h- 1 could reduce the presence of the tracer from the lower floor in the upper floor by an order of magnitude. But if the ME is on only in one of the two floors, the re-entry of outflow to the upper floor may be aggravated at some specific <b>exhaust</b> <b>rate.</b> Therefore, in epidemic seasons, appealing residents to switch on their individual exhaust fans, or alternatively switching on a central exhaust system is recommended.

40|$|Although {{the cabin}} design {{is widely used}} for {{providing}} fire safety in big and tall public transport terminals in the Far East, there are many debates on its performance. Very few experimental studies with big fires in a cabin were reported in the literature. In many applications, smoke exhaust was at low level in the cabin. The performance of such systems has to be justified. Full-scale burning tests were carried out to study smoke exhaust at low levels in a cabin fire. A cabin of length 3 m, width 4 m and height 3 m was constructed. Smoke temperature, average smoke layer height in the cabin, and velocity in the fan duct were measured with different heat release rates and heights of the ventilation opening. Eight sets of tests were carried out with results reported in this paper. For smoke exhaust at low level, the interface of smoke layer was low, usually lower than {{the height of the}} ventilation opening. The fire plume was then at the continuous flame zone. The interface of the smoke layer would be tilted. The smoke layer near the mechanical exhaust ventilation was lower than that at the opposite wall. The calculated smoke production rate would then be lower than the mechanical <b>exhaust</b> <b>rate,</b> as air would be extracted directly from the lower layer. In designing mechanical exhaust system in a cabin, the plume coefficient should be tuned up by a factor. In this paper, the mechanical <b>exhaust</b> <b>rate</b> used in cabin design at low levels would be estimated by changing the coefficient concerned. Plume correlation expression due to McCaffrey was taken as an example. Semi-empirical correlation of the flow rates of the fan in controlling smoke not to spill out was derived based on the experimental data...|$|E
40|$|The Building Code of Australia (BCA) {{generally}} requires large spaces to {{be protected}} by a mechanical smoke exhaust system. This requires the spaces to be divided at the ceiling level into smoke reservoirs to contain the smoke layer; and exhaust fan(s) installed to remove the smoke from each reservoir. Even though this is a Deemed-to-Satisfy solution, the BCA sets out both prescriptive and performance requirements the system must be designed to satisfy. One of the key performance requirements is that the smoke layer must be contained within the smoke reservoir. Series of parametric {{studies were carried out}} using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analyses to examine the smoke filling of smoke reservoirs. The studies reveal that, with the BCA prescribed smoke extraction rates, smoke reservoirs with a minimum depth of 0. 5 m specified by the BCA are insufficient to contain the smoke layer within the reservoirs. For smoke layer containment, the necessary reservoir depths are significantly larger than the BCA prescribed minimum of 0. 5 m. These were investigated in the parametric studies and the necessary depths for smoke containment in the ideal, best case situations are given in the paper. Further studies were also carried out to investigate the smoke extraction for a smoke reservoir with a minimum depth of 0. 5 m. The results show that the smoke extraction rate required for containment of smoke within the reservoir is significantly higher than that prescribed by the BCA. The high <b>exhaust</b> <b>rate</b> is unlikely to be practical and may also introduce significant issues with make-up air. The viability of adopting the minimum reservoir depth and increasing the smoke <b>exhaust</b> <b>rate</b> for containing the smoke layer is questionable.
