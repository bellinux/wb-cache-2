30|$|Our {{findings}} indicate that, {{with the exception}} of HER 2 overexpressing tumors, for which we lacked precision, the risk of all subtypes of breast cancer increased with increasing alcohol, as measured by average weekly intake; the risk seemed to be similar for <b>hormonal</b> <b>receptor</b> positive breast cancers, i.e., luminal A and luminal B subtypes, and for TNBC. Our findings are consistent with those of previous studies, which found alcohol consumption to be primarily associated with an increased risk of hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, primarily ER+ breast cancer (Lew et al. 2009; Li et al. 2010; Chen et al. 2011), although there was also an increased risk for ER− breast cancer. A meta-analysis of 20 studies reported an increased risk of 27  % of all ER+ and of 14  % of all ER-breast cancers for the highest vs. the lowest consumption categories of alcohol drinking (Suzuki et al. 2008). However, majority of previous studies centered on studying the effect of alcohol in ER+ breast cancer versus ER− breast cancer because they lacked information on HER 2 receptor, which precluded them from examining more specific breast cancer subtypes further defined by HER 2 receptor. Because we had this information, we were able to examine the four major cancer subtypes, i.e., luminal A, luminal B, TNBC, and HER 2 -overexpressing breast cancer. Thus, among the group formerly categorized as <b>hormonal</b> <b>receptor</b> positive breast cancer (majority ER+ breast cancer), we found increased risk for both luminal A (ER+, PR+, HER 2 −) and luminal B (ER+, PR+, HER 2 +) breast cancers. Among the group categorized as <b>hormonal</b> <b>receptor</b> negative breast cancer (majority ER− breast cancers), we found increased risk for TNBC (ER−, PR−, HER 2 −), a finding consistent with a few studies that previously examined the TNBC subtype (Dolle et al. 2009; Trivers et al. 2009), although one prior study did not find this effect (Kabat et al. 2011), but did not find increased risk for HER 2 − overexpressing breast cancer (ER−, PR−, HER 2 +).|$|E
30|$|Clinically, {{breast cancer}} {{represents}} a heterogeneous disease that is mainly grouped {{based on its}} hormone receptor (estrogen receptor [ER] or progesterone receptor [PR] positivity) and amplification of the ERBB 2 gene (hereafter referred to as HER 2 +) (Sorlie 2004). Genomic profiling has identified at least two major groups (luminal and basaloid) primarily based on their hormone receptor status (Perou et al. 2000; Sorlie et al. 2001). These two major groups differ by age, race/ethnicity, reproductive patterns, lifestyle factors, stage at diagnosis, and survival (Carey et al. 2006; Millikan et al. 2008; Parise et al. 2009; Trivers et al. 2009). Epidemiological studies also support these differences (Martinez et al. 2010). Thus, many breast cancer factors such as age at onset, menopausal status (Clavel-Chapelon 2002; Althuis et al. 2004), and timing and number of births (Pathak et al. 2000; Palmer et al. 2003), affect {{the risk of breast}} cancer in an opposite direction (increasing or decreasing risk) depending on its <b>hormonal</b> <b>receptor</b> status (Anderson et al. 2014). Similarly, breast cancer risks from genetic variants that have recently been identified in genome-wide association studies, also clearly differ by <b>hormonal</b> <b>receptor</b> status, as there are specific genetic variants associated only with ER+ breast cancers and other with TNBC (Michailidou et al. 2013; Garcia-Closas et al. 2013).|$|E
30|$|To our knowledge, this is {{the first}} study to examine the {{association}} of breast cancer subtypes and alcohol intake in Spanish women. Our findings indicate that breast cancer risk increased with increasing alcohol intakes for three out of the four major subtypes of breast cancer. The association appeared to be similar for <b>hormonal</b> <b>receptor</b> positive breast cancer, i.e., luminal A and luminal B breast cancer, and for TNBC. The association seemed to be slightly more pronounced for lobular than ductal breast cancers. No differences were detected by grade.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Body {{mass index}} (BMI) {{may be an}} {{important}} factor affecting breast cancer outcome. Studies conducted mainly in Western countries have reported a relationship between higher BMI and a higher risk of all-cause death or breast cancer-specific death among women with breast cancer, but only a few studies have been reported in Japan so far. In the present prospective study, we investigated the associations between BMI and the risk of all-cause and breast cancer-specific death among breast cancer patients overall and by menopausal status and hormone receptor status. Methods The study included 653 breast cancer patients admitted to a single hospital in Japan, between 1997 and 2005. BMI was assessed using a self-administered questionnaire. The patients were completely followed up until December, 2008. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated according to quartile points of BMI categories, respectively: 2. Results During the follow-up period, 136 all-cause and 108 breast cancer-specific deaths were observed. After adjustment for clinical and confounding factors, higher BMI was associated with an increased risk of all-cause death (HR[*]=[*] 2. 61; 95 % CI: 1. 01 – 6. 78 for BMI ≥ 25. 8 vs. ≥ 21. 2 to 2) among premenopausal patients. According to <b>hormonal</b> <b>receptor</b> status, BMI ≥ 25. 8 [*]kg/m 2 was associated with breast cancer-specific death (HR[*]=[*] 4. 95; 95 % CI: 1. 05 – 23. 35) and BMI 2 was associated with all-cause (HR[*]=[*] 2. 91; 95 % CI: 1. 09 – 7. 77) and breast cancer-specific death (HR[*]=[*] 7. 23; 95 % CI: 1. 57 – 33. 34) among patients with ER[*]+[*]or PgR[*]+[*]tumors. Analysis by <b>hormonal</b> <b>receptor</b> status also showed a positive association between BMI and mortality risk among patients with ER[*]+[*]or PgR[*]+[*]tumors and with BMI ≥ 21. 2 [*]kg/m 2 (p for trend: 0. 020 and 0. 031 for all-cause and breast cancer-specific death, respectively). Conclusions Our results suggest that both higher BMI and lower BMI are associated with an increased risk of mortality, especially among premenopausal patients or among patients with <b>hormonal</b> <b>receptor</b> positive tumors. Breast cancer patients should be informed of the potential importance of maintaining an appropriate body weight after they have been diagnosed. </p...|$|E
30|$|Results of {{this study}} must be {{interpreted}} in light of its limitations. First, we could not examine the alcohol-breast cancer relationship by type of alcoholic beverages such as wine, beer and spirits since {{we did not have}} information on beverage types. Also, measurement of alcohol intake can be difficult and misclassification of this variable can occur. Another limitations are the retrospective nature of the study. However, any misreporting of alcohol consumption is unlikely to be influenced by tumor subtype. Conversely, an important strength of our study is the available information on HER 2 in addition to <b>hormonal</b> <b>receptor</b> status.|$|E
30|$|It is {{well known}} that when {{conservative}} procedures are chosen, free surgical margins are less common for ILC than for IDC; thus, the rate of re-excision is significantly higher for ILC treated with conservative surgeries [34]. Mastectomy as an option for re-assessment is used in 16 – 48  % of patients [30]. However, when surgical margins are free in conservative surgeries, there is no difference in local recurrence, disease-free survival or overall survival compared with IDC [26]. Accordingly, the indications for surgical treatment, radiotherapy and chemotherapy do not differ between ILC and IDC [2]. Endocrine therapy is often used in women with ILC, given their high proportion of <b>hormonal</b> <b>receptor</b> expression [2].|$|E
30|$|Although ILC {{has some}} good {{prognostic}} factors, such as lower grades, lower mitotic indexes, positive <b>hormonal</b> <b>receptors</b> {{and a lack}} of HER 2 overexpression, there is no difference in the survival rates of patients with these two histological types [26], which may be justified by the fact that, usually, ILC is diagnosed in more advanced staging than IDC [33].|$|R

30|$|When we {{categorized}} {{breast cancer}} by HER 2 expression regardless of <b>hormonal</b> <b>receptor</b> status, our {{study showed that}} alcohol may be more strongly associated with the risk of HER 2 − than HER 2 + breast cancer, although very slightly so.

(2005), alcohol significantly increased {{the risk of breast}} cancer in HER 2 − breast cancer but not in HER 2 + cases. Similarly, in a case-case design by Kwan et al. (2009), women diagnosed with luminal A (ER+, PR+, HER 2 −) breast cancers were more likely to drink alcohol compared to women diagnosed with luminal B breast cancers (ER+, PR+, HER 2 +).|$|E
30|$|The study {{population}} consisted {{of all women}} diagnosed with primary invasive breast cancer from 1988 – 2008 in the SEER population-based cancer registries in Detroit, New Jersey and California. For each case, the following information from routinely collected registry data was obtained: age at diagnosis, race, <b>hormonal</b> <b>receptor</b> status, tumor characteristics, staging, and survival time. The Reporting Recommendations for Tumor Marker Prognostic Studies (REMARK) guidelines were followed in the reporting of the <b>hormonal</b> <b>receptor</b> results (McShane et al. 2005). Assay results for estrogen and progesterone receptor status, prior to neoadjuvant therapy, if available, were abstracted by the SEER registries from the medical record (Johnson & Adamo 2008). Cases where the assay was not performed or was borderline or undetermined {{were not included in}} our logistic regression model of marker status by race/ethnicity. The percent of individuals over 25 years of age without a high school diploma within a census tract was also obtained from the SEER registries. We categorized the census-tract level education as high, middle, and low based on tertiles of the overall distribution of this variable in our dataset as follows: High education = < 10.85 % less than high school graduate; Middle education = > 10.85 % less than high school graduate and < 21.97 % less than high school graduate; Low education = > 21.97 % less than high school graduate. Women 50 years of age and older were considered post-menopausal while those under the age of 50 were considered pre-menopausal.

Materials and Methods. -A total of 92 patients with 96 invasive breast cancer lesions were enrolled; all had undergone 3 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for local staging. All lesions were confirmed by histological analysis, and tumor grade was established according to the Nottingham Grading System (NGS). MRI included oth dynamic contrast-enhanced and DWI sequences, and ADC value was calculated for each lesion. ADC values were compared with NGS classification using the ManneWhitney U and the KruskaleWallis H tests. Grading was considered as a comprehensiveprognostic factor, and Rho Spearman test was performed to determine correlation between grading and tumor size, <b>hormonal</b> <b>receptor</b> status, HER 2 expression and Ki 67 index. Pearson's Chi square test was carried out to compare grading with the other prognostic factors. Results. -ADC values were significantly higher in G 1 than in G 3 tumors.

40|$|Background & aim: Breast {{cancer is}} the most common cancer among women and one of the factors {{threatening}} the health of women worldwide. Leptin is a 16 kD glycoprotein hormone produced predominantly by white adipose tissue. Leptin binds to receptors in the hypothalamus and {{plays a key role in}} regulation of metabolism. Both leptin and leptin receptor have recently been implicated in processes and progress leading to breast cancer initiation. The aim of this study was to identify if there is association between leptin and pathological indexes in patients with breast cancer Methods: 45 women with breast cancer were enrolled. Serum leptin levels of patients were measured by the ELISA method. Pathological information such as stage of the breast cancer, <b>Hormonal</b> <b>receptor</b> (ER, PR) and Her 2 status in these patients were determined. Result: Results revealed that the patients who were in stage one and two, the mean serum leptin level was (34. 18 ± 21. 22 ng/ml) And patients who were in stage three and four, the mean serum leptin level was (32. 21 ± 21 / 93 ng/ml). Also the mean serum leptin levels in patients whose receptor status of ER, PR and HER 2 positive were (35. 90 ± 23. 55, 35. 74 ± 23. 91 and 37. 02 ± 24. 25 ng/ml), respectively.

40|$|AIMSThis study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the influence of <b>hormonal</b> <b>receptor</b> and Ki- 67 proliferation marker in predicting MRI accuracy of measuring residual tumor size in HER 2 negative breast cancer receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). METHODSFifty-four women were studied. Patients received AC and/or taxane-based regimens. The accuracy of MR determined clinical complete response (CCR) was compared to pathological complete response (pCR). The size of detectable residual tumor on MRI was correlated with pathology-diagnosed tumor size using Pearson’s correlation. RESULTSMRI correctly diagnosed 16 of the 17 pCR patients. There were 8 false negative diagnoses, 7 <b>hormonal</b> <b>receptor</b> (HR) positive and one HR negative. The overall sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of MRI were 78 %, 94 %, and 83 %, respectively. The positive predictive value was 97 % and the negative predictive value was 67 %. For MRI-pathology tumor size correlation, HR negative cancers showed a higher correlation (R= 0. 79) than HR positive cancers (R= 0. 58). A worse MRI-pathology size discrepancy was found in HR positive cancer than in HR negative cancer (1. 6 ± 2. 8 cm vs. 0. 56 ± 0. 9 cm, p= 0. 05). Tumors with a low Ki- 67 proliferation (< 40 %) showed a larger size discrepancy than those with a high Ki- 67 proliferation (≥ 40 %) (1. 2 ± 2. 0 cm vs. 0. 4 ± 0. 8 cm p= 0. 05).
