40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Fish, {{especially}} fatty fish, are {{the main}} contributor to eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA) intake. EPA and DHA concentrations in red blood cells (RBC) has been proposed as a cardiovascular risk factor, with 8 % associated with the lowest and greatest protection, respectively. The relationship between high fat fish (HFF) intake and RBC <b>EPA</b> + DHA <b>content</b> {{has been little investigated}} {{on a wide range of}} fish intake, and may be non-linear. We aimed to study the shape of this relationship among high seafood consumers. METHODS AND RESULTS: Seafood consumption records and blood were collected from 384 French heavy seafood consumers and EPA and DHA were measured in RBC. A multivariate linear regression was performed using restricted cubic splines to consider potential non-linear associations. Thirty-six percent of subjects had an RBC <b>EPA</b> + DHA <b>content</b> lower than 4 % and only 5 % exceeded 8 %. HFF consumption was significantly associated with RBC <b>EPA</b> + DHA <b>content</b> (P [overall association] = 0. 021) adjusted for sex, tobacco status, study area, socioeconomic status, age, alcohol, other seafood, meat, and meat product intakes. This relationship was non-linear: for intakes higher than 200 g/wk, <b>EPA</b> + DHA <b>content</b> tended to stagnate. Tobacco status and fish contaminants were negatively associated with RBC <b>EPA</b> + DHA <b>content.</b> CONCLUSION: Because of the saturation for high intakes, and accounting for the concern with exposure to trace element contaminants, intake not exceeding 200 g should be considered...|$|R

This study quantifies the impact of different incident light intensities on the biomass, TAG and EPA yield on light in nitrogen starved batch cultures of P. tricornutum. The maximum biomass concentration and maximum TAG and <b>EPA</b> <b>contents</b> were found to be independent of the applied light intensity. The lipid yield on light was reduced at elevated light intensities (> 100 μmol m - 2 s - 1). The highest TAG yield on light (112 mg TAG mol ph - 1) was found at the lowest light intensity tested (60 μmol m - 2 s - 1), which is still relatively low to values reported in literature for other algae.

Previous studies have indicated an increase in muscle protein synthesis (Smith et al. 2011 a; Smith et al. 2011 b) and peak torque development (Rodacki et al. 2012) after supplementation of LCn- 3  s was combined with an anabolic stimulus. In advanced cancer populations, EPA LCn- 3 supplementation (often in conjunction with a protein-rich supplement) has been associated with improvements in physical function (Moses et al. 2004) and strength (Fearon et al. 2006), while EPA and DHA LCn- 3 [*]+[*]NSAIDs have been shown to improve handgrip strength (Cerchietti et al. 2007). Our results both agree and disagree with the previous literature base with no clear reason for the opposing directions for the associations between physical function, DHA and EPA.

40|$|Omega- 3 {{fatty acids}} are {{products}} of secondary metabolism, essential for growth and important for human health. Although there are numerous reports of bacterial production of omega- 3 fatty acids, less information {{is available on the}} biotechnological production of these compounds from bacteria. The production of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20 : 5 ω 3) by a new species of marine bacteria Shewanella electrodiphila MAR 441 T was investigated under different fermentation conditions. This strain produced a high percentage (up to 26 %) of total fatty acids and high yields (mg / g of biomass) of EPA at or below the optimal growth temperature. At higher growth temperatures these values decreased greatly. The amount of EPA produced was affected by the carbon source, which also influenced fatty acid composition. This strain required Na+ for growth and EPA synthesis and cells harvested at late exponential or early stationary phase had a higher <b>EPA</b> <b>content.</b> Both the highest amounts (20 mg g- 1) and highest percent <b>EPA</b> <b>content</b> (18 %) occurred with growth on L-proline and (NH 4) 2 SO 4.

Chemical mutagenesis using NTG allowed the isolation of mutants with improved levels of <b>EPA</b> <b>content</b> (from 9. 7 to 15. 8 mg g- 1) when grown at 15 °C.

40|$|The {{nitrogen}} (N) sources including nitrate, ammonium, urea, tryptone and {{yeast extract}} were optimized for eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) production by the diatom Nitzschia laevis in heterotrophic cultures. First, nitrate and urea {{were found to}} be the preferred N sources for both cell growth and <b>EPA</b> <b>content.</b> The optimal concentrations of nitrate and urea for cell growth and EPA yield were 620 mg/liter and 600 mg/liter, respectively. Secondly, tryptone and yeast extract were respectively added to the medium and both of them were found to enhance EPA production compared with the control. To investigate the co-effects of tryptone and yeast extract, in the subsequent experiments, a central composite experimental design was used to optimize the two complex nitrogen sources. The results showed that the EPA production was influenced not only by tryptone or yeast extract, but also by their interactions. The cell dry weight (DW), <b>EPA</b> <b>content</b> and EPA yield could be described by the second-order polynomial equations with high confidence levels (> 99 %). Based on the surface plots of the responses, the optimal concentrations of tryptone and yeast extract were determined to be 1. 6 g/liter and 0. 8 g/liter, respectively. To verify the predicted models, the alga was grown in the medium with tryptone and yeast extract at optimal concentrations. The resulting DW, <b>EPA</b> <b>content</b> and EPA yield reached 6. 48 g/liter, 2. 74 % (w/w), and 175 mg/liter, respectively, which agreed with the predicted values, and were much higher than those obtained in the previous studies. © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

30|$|The aim of {{this study}} was first of all to get a better insight into the {{intraspecific}} variability in <b>EPA</b> and DHA <b>content</b> in response to irradiance and temperature. To investigate this, cellular <b>EPA</b> and DHA <b>content</b> of a polar and a temperate diatom was followed after acclimation to a range of irradiance levels at two temperatures.

To this end, <b>EPA</b> and DHA <b>content</b> of two polar and three temperate species, cultured at equivalent growth conditions were investigated. So far, no comparative analysis between temperate and polar algal species had been carried out. In addition, many earlier studies reporting on EPA and DHA variability in polar species focused on relative variability, rather than on absolute cellular production rates. To be able to measure true interspecific differences, taking into account differences in total fatty acid content relative to algal biomass, the absolute amounts of EPA and DHA were determined, using biovolume as biomass unit.|$|R

In aquatic food webs, these highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFA) are essential for many physiological processes and mainly synthetized by distinct phytoplankton taxa. Consumers at different trophic levels obtain essential fatty acids from their diet because they cannot produce these sufficiently de novo.

The <b>EPA</b> and DHA <b>content</b> of phytoplankton biomass (mg HUFA g− 1) was significantly lower in the eutrophic lakes than in the oligo-mesotrophic or dystrophic lakes. We found a strong significant correlation between the DHA content in the muscle of piscivorous perch and phytoplankton DHA content (r = 0. 85) as well with the contribution of DHA-synthesizing phytoplankton taxa (r = 0. 83). Among all DHA-synthesizing phytoplankton this correlation was the strongest with the dinoflagellates (r = 0. 74) and chrysophytes (r = 0. 70). Accordingly, the <b>EPA</b> + DHA <b>content</b> of perch muscle decreased with increasing total phosphorus (r 2 = 0. 80) and dissolved organic carbon concentration (r 2 = 0. 83) in the lakes.

This study characterized ovary fatty acid composition of wild female jundiá catfish (Rhamdia quelen) in their different gonadal maturation stages. Female jundiá (n = 36, average weight= 383. 8 + 208. 8 g) were captured in the rio Uruguay, comprising all seasons. Ovaries were extracted and classified according to their gonadal maturation stage. Gonad-somatic ratio varied significantly among seasons, being higher in spring (3. 7), followed by summer (2. 2), winter (0. 9) and autumn (0. 6). Main fatty acids groups detected were: saturated (SFA= 35. 5 %), monounsaturated (MUFA= 28. 1 %) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA= 33. 5 %). Over the four seasons, palmitic acid was recorded in large quantities, followed by docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and arachidonic acid (ARA).

40|$|The marine {{oleaginous}} diatom Fistulifera solaris JPCC DA 0580 is {{a candidate}} for biodiesel production because of its high lipid productivity. However, the substantial eicosapentaenoic acid (<b>EPA)</b> <b>content</b> in this strain would affect the biodiesel quality. On the other hand, EPA is also known as the essential health supplement for humans. EPAs are mainly incorporated into glycerolipids in the microalgal cell instead of the presence as free fatty acids. Therefore, the understanding of the EPA biosynthesis including the incorporation of the EPA into glycerolipids especially triacylglycerol (TAG) is fundamental for regulating <b>EPA</b> <b>content</b> for different purposes. In this study, in order to identify the biosynthesis pathway for the EPA-containing TAG species, a lipidomic characterization of the EPA-enriched polar lipids was performed by using direct infusion electrospray ionization (ESI) -Q-TRAP-MS and MS/MS analyses. The determination of the fatty acid positional distribution showed that the sn- 2 position of all the chloroplast lipids and part of phosphatidylcholine (PC) species was occupied by C 16 fatty acids. This result suggested the critical role of the chloroplast on the lipid synthesis in F. solaris. Furthermore, the exclusive presence of C 18 fatty acids in PC highly indicated the biosynthesis of EPA on PC. Finally, the PC-based acyl-editing and head group exchange processes were proposed to be essential for the incorporation of EPA into TAG and chloroplast lipids...|$|E
40|$|Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20 : 5 n- 3) and {{docosahexaenoic acid}} (DHA, 22 : 6 n- 3) have important {{nutritional}} benefits in humans. EPA and DHA are mainly derived from fish, but {{the decline in}} the stocks of major marine capture fishes could result in these fatty acids being consumed less. Farmed fish could serve as promising sources of EPA and DHA, but they need these fatty acids in their diets. Generation of fish strains that are capable of synthesizing enough amounts of EPA/DHA from the conversion of α-linolenic acid (LNA, 18 : 3 n- 3) rich oils can supply a new EPA/DHA source. This may be achieved by over-expression of genes encoding enzymes involved in HUFA biosynthesis. In aquaculture, the successful of this technique would open the possibility to reduce the enrichment of live food with fish oils for marine fish larvae, and to completely substitute fish oils with plant oils without reducing the quality of flesh in terms of EPA and DHA contents. Here, three genes, i. e. Δ 6 -desaturase-like (OmΔ 6 FAD), Δ 5 -desaturase-like (OmΔ 5 FAD) and elongase-like (MELO) encoding EPA/DHA metabolic enzymes derived from masu salmon (Oncorhynchus masou) were individually transferred into zebrafish (Danio rerio) as a model to increase its ability for synthesizing EPA and DHA. Fatty acid analysis showed that <b>EPA</b> <b>content</b> in whole body of the second transgenic fish generation over-expressing OmΔ 6 FAD gene was  1. 4 fold and that of DHA was 2. 1 fold higher (P< 0. 05) than those in non-transgenic fish.  The <b>EPA</b> <b>content</b> in whole body of transgenic fish over-expressing OmΔ 5 FAD gene was 1. 21 -fold, and that of DHA was 1. 24 -fold higher (P< 0. 05) than those in nontransgenic fish.

Healthy young males were randomised to consume one of seven oil blends for a period of 12 weeks (9 g oil/day) (n = 8 – 12 subjects/group). Palm oil, sunflower oil, an EPA-rich oil, borage oil (rich in GLA), and Echium oil (rich in STA) were blended in various combinations to generate a placebo oil and oils providing approximately 2 g GLA + STA + EPA per day, but in different combinations. Blood was collected at 0, 4, 8 and 12 weeks and the fatty acid compositions of plasma triacylglycerols, cholesteryl esters and phospholipids and of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) determined. Significant effects were observed with each lipid fraction. Neither STA nor its derivative 20 : 4 n- 3 appeared in any of the lipid fractions studied when STA (up to 1 g/day) was consumed. However, STA (1 g/day), in combination with GLA (0. 9 g/day), increased the proportion of EPA in some lipid fractions, suggesting that STA-rich plant oils may offer a novel means of increasing EPA status. Furthermore, this combination tended to increase the dihomo-?-linolenic acid (20 : 3 n- 6; DGLA) content of PBMCs, without an increase in arachidonic acid (AA) (20 : 4 n- 6) content. EPA consumption increased the <b>EPA</b> <b>content</b> of all lipid fractions studied. Consumption of GLA (2 g/day), in the absence of STA or EPA, increased DGLA content with a tendency to increase AA content in some fractions. This effect was prevented by inclusion of EPA in combination with GLA.

Such effects may offer new strategies for manipulation of cell composition in order to influence cellular responses and functions in desirable ways...|$|E

When normalized to biovolume, absolute <b>EPA</b> <b>content</b> was highest in F. japonica (2.93 fg μm- 3). Lowest EPA levels were found in Emiliania huxleyi (0.89 fg EPA μm- 3) while EPA was undetectable in Pyramimonas sp.. Overall, DHA levels showed the highest interspecific variability, varying two orders of magnitude on a biovolume basis (Table  2).|$|E
40|$|Physical and {{chemical}} properties of biodiesel {{are influenced by}} structural features of the fatty acids, such as chain length, degree of unsaturation and branching of the carbon chain. This study investigated if microalgal fatty acid profiles are suitable for biodiesel characterization and species selection through Preference Ranking Organisation Method for Enrichment Evaluation (PROMETHEE) and Graphical Analysis for Interactive Assistance (GAIA) analysis. Fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) profiles were {{used to calculate the}} likely key chemical and physical properties of the biodiesel [cetane number (CN), iodine value (IV), cold filter plugging point, density, kinematic viscosity, higher heating value] of nine microalgal species (this study) and twelve species from the literature, selected for their suitability for cultivation in subtropical climates. An equal-parameter weighted (PROMETHEE-GAIA) ranked Nannochloropsis oculata, Extubocellulus sp. and Biddulphia sp. highest; the only species meeting the EN 14214 and ASTM D 6751 - 02 biodiesel standards, except for the double bond limit in the EN 14214. Chlorella vulgaris outranked N. oculata when the twelve microalgae were included. Culture growth phase (stationary) and, to a lesser extent, nutrient provision affected CN and IV values of N. oculata due to lower eicosapentaenoic acid (<b>EPA)</b> <b>contents.</b> Application of a polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) weighting to saturation led to a lower ranking of species exceeding the double bond EN 14214 thresholds. In summary, CN, IV, C 18 : 3 and double bond limits were the strongest drivers in equal biodiesel parameter-weighted PROMETHEE analysis...|$|R
40|$|Abstract We {{examined}} {{responses of}} batch {{cultures of the}} marine microalga Nannochloropsis sp. to combined alterations in salinity (13, 27, and 40 g/l NaCl) and light intensity (170 and 700 μmol photons/m 2 ·s). Major growth parameters and lipid productivity (based on total fatty acid determination) were determined in nitrogen-replete and nitrogen-depleted cultures of an initial biomass of 0. 8 and 1. 4 g/l, respectively. On the nitrogen-replete medium, increases in light intensity and salinity increased the cellular content of dry weight and lipids due to enhanced formation of triacylglycerols (TAG). Maximum average productivity of ca. 410 mg TFA/l/d were obtained at 700 μmol photons/m 2 ·s and 40 g/l NaCl within 7 days. Under stressful conditions, content of the major LC-PUFA, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), was significantly reduced while TAG reached 25 % of biomass. In contrast, lower salinity tended to improve major growth parameters, consistent with less variation in <b>EPA</b> <b>contents.</b> Combined higher salinity and light intensity was detrimental to lipid productivity under nitrogen starvation; biomass TFA content, and lipid productivity amounted for only 33 % of DW and ca. 200 mg TFA/l/day, respectively. The highest biomass TFA content (ca. 47 % DW) and average lipid productivity of ca. 360 mg TFA/l/day were achieved at 13 g/l NaCl and 700 μmol photons/m 2 ·s. Our data further support selecting Nannochloropsis as promising microalgae for biodiesel production. Moreover, appropriate cultivation regimes may render Nannochloropsis microalgae to produce simultaneously major valuable components...|$|R

40|$|Objective To examine n? 3 {{polyunsaturated}} {{fatty acid}} (PUFA) incorporation into atherosclerotic plaques and the association with plaque inflammation and stability. Methods and results Patients awaiting carotid endarterectomy (n = 121) were randomised to consume control capsules or n? 3 PUFA ethyl ester capsules until surgery (median 21 days). The fatty acid compositions of plasma and carotid plaque phospholipids, plaque features, and expression of inflammatory genes were determined. The proportion of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) was higher (P < 0. 0001) in carotid plaque phospholipids in patients in the n? 3 PUFA group. Plaques from patients in the n? 3 PUFA group had fewer foam cells (P = 0. 0390). There were no other differences between plaques {{in the two groups}} with regard to histological characteristics or morphology. Plaque stability was not different between the two groups. However, the <b>EPA</b> <b>content</b> of plaque phospholipids was inversely associated with plaque instability (P = 0. 0209), plaque inflammation (P = 0. 0108), the number of T cells in the plaque (P = 0. 0097) and a summary score considering a range of plaque features (P = 0. 0425). Plaques from patients who received n? 3 PUFAs had significantly lower levels of mRNA for matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) - 7 (P = 0. 0055), - 9 (P = 0. 0048) and - 12 (P = 0. 0044) and for interleukin- 6 (P = 0. 0395) and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (P = 0. 0142). Conclusions Atherosclerotic plaques readily incorporate EPA. A higher plaque <b>EPA</b> <b>content</b> is associated with a reduced number of foam cells and T cells, less inflammation and increased stability...|$|E
40|$|The red {{microalga}} Porphyridium cruentum is a {{new source}} for eicosapentanoic acid (EPA) and arachidonic acid (AA) fatty acids of potential pharmaceutical value. The conditions leading to a high content of either fatty acid were investigated. The highest <b>EPA</b> <b>content</b> was obtained under conditions resulting in high growth rate (2. 4 % of ash free dry weight in Strain 1380 - 1 d). High AA content was obtained under slow growth conditions and was maximal in the stationary phase or under nitrogen starvation (2. 9 %). Strain 1380 - 1 a had the highest content (1. 9 %) of arachidonic acid under exponential growth conditions. By imposing nitrogen starvation, {{it was possible to}} obtain a lipid mixture which may be separated into AA and EPA rich fractions...|$|E
40|$|Background: Epidemiologic {{studies suggest}} a reduced risk of esophageal {{adenocarcinoma}} in populations {{with a high}} consumption of fish, and n 3 fatty acids inhibit experimental carcinogenesis. One possible explanation is the suppression of eicosanoid production through inhibition of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX- 2). Objective: The objective {{was to determine the}} effects of dietary supplementation with the n 3 fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) on a number of biological endpoints in Barrett’s esophagus. Design: Fifty-two participants with known Barrett’s esophagus un-derwent endoscopy. Biopsy samples were obtained from a recorded level within the area of Barrett’s esophagus, and then 27 patients were randomly assigned to consume EPA capsules (1. 5 g/d) for 6 mo or no supplement (controls). At the end of this period, patients again underwent endoscopy, and biopsy samples were collected at the same level. Tissue samples were analyzed for mucosal lipid, pros-taglandin E 2, leukotriene B 4, COX- 2 protein, and RNA concentra-tions. Cellular proliferation was also measured, by Ki- 67 immuno-histochemistry. Results: The <b>EPA</b> <b>content</b> of esophageal mucosa increased over the study period in the n 3 –supplemented subjects and was signifi-cantly different from the content in the controls (P 0. 01). There was also a significant decline in COX- 2 protein concentrations (mea-sured by immunoblotting) in the n 3 group, and the difference was significant from that in the controls (P 0. 05); no difference in COX- 2 RNA concentrations was observed between groups. This change in COX- 2 protein was inversely related to the change in <b>EPA</b> <b>content</b> (P 0. 05). There was no significant difference in the change in prostaglandin E 2, leukotriene B 4, or cellular proliferation between the 2 groups. Conclusion: Supplementation with EPA significantly changed n 3 fatty acid concentrations and reduced COX- 2 concentrations in Bar-rett’s tissue. Am J Clin Nutr 2008; 87 : 949 – 56...|$|E
40|$|Current {{recommendations}} for arachidonic (AA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA) acids in infant formulae {{are based on}} milk of Western mothers. Validity may be questioned {{in view of the}} profound dietary changes in the past 100 years, as opposed to our slowly adapting genome. Hominin evolution occurred in the proximity of East-African freshwater lakes and rivers and early homo sapiens had higher intakes of AA and DHA from a predominantly lacustrine-based diet. In search of milk AA and DHA contents of our African ancestors, we investigated the milk of 29 lactating women living in Doromoni near lake Kitangiri (Tanzania). They consumed sunflower oil-fried local fish as only animal lipid sources, maize and local vegetables. AA and DHA contents of Doromoni milk may be close to that of early homo sapiens, because of the similarity of their life-long consumption of East-African lacustrine-based foods. Human milk fatty acid relationships from our historical worldwide database and the literature revealed that disparities between the Doromoni diet and the presumed ancient diet (i. e. higher carbohydrate and linoleic acid intakes) are unlikely to affect milk AA and DHA contents. Doromoni milk had high contents of AA (median 0. 70 mol%), DHA (0. 75) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 0. 17), and low AA/DHA ratios (median 0. 91; 0. 55 - 2. 61). This tracks down to consumption of fish with high AA and DHA contents, and AA/EPA ratios. We conclude that the milk AA, DHA and <b>EPA</b> <b>contents</b> of Doromoni women might provide us with clues to optimize infant formulae and perhaps the milk of Western women...|$|R
