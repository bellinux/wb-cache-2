His work, Metamorphosis, involving 20' tall pupating luna moths, officially opened the 2000 Henson International Festival of Puppet Theatre. In 2002, he and Michahelles initiated a midsummer pageant project in the Italian Alps village of Morinesio, drawing on local folklore and oral history to create a unique site-specific pageant. Inspired {{by the success of}} the now-annual tradition, they have seeded similar projects in diverse locales in Ukraine, Turkey, Italy, Texas, New York, and elsewhere. In 2006, Kahn was awarded a Fulbright Scholarship to Trinidad and Tobago, to study the artistic and cultural structures behind Caribbean Carnival and Trinidadian [...] "Mas'", or costumed procession.

50|$|Founded by NY Halloween Parade {{designers}} Alex Kahn and Sophia Michahelles in 1998, SCM creates large-scale site-specific performance works {{specifically for}} the medium of procession, involving giant puppets, mobile scenography, shadow and projection, and other visual elements. These works often involve hundreds of volunteers who build and rehearse in community workshops, and then perform in the final event. Beyond their work for the Halloween Parade, PAW has travelled to communities {{around the world to}} create site-specific processions and parades based on local themes. Drawing on regional cultures, oral history, and current sociopolitical concerns, the group encourages local residents to participate at every stage of production from initial design to final performance. thus empowering them to identify and preserve narratives that uniquely define “local” in their own community. To date they have created events in Italy, Trinidad, Maine, Texas, New York, and other locales. Other recent <b>PAW</b> <b>works</b> have included major commissions for Socrates Sculpture Park the NY Architectural League's Beaux Arts Ball, the PEN World Voices Festival, Houston's Buffalo Bayou Park, the Grand Opening of the High Line over Penn Rail Yards.|$|R

5|$|Botanist Robert Brown was {{the first}} to write a {{detailed}} scientific description of the koala in 1814, based on a female specimen captured near what is now Mount Kembla in the Illawarra region of New South Wales. Austrian botanical illustrator Ferdinand Bauer drew the animal's skull, throat, feet, and <b>paws.</b> Brown's <b>work</b> remained unpublished and largely unnoticed, however, as his field books and notes remained in his possession until his death, when they were bequeathed to the British Museum (Natural History) in London. They were not identified until 1994, while Bauer's koala watercolours were not published until 1989. British surgeon Everard Home included details of the koala based on eyewitness accounts of William Paterson, who had befriended Brown and Bauer during their stay in New South Wales. Home, who in 1808 published his report in the journal Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, gave the animal the scientific name Didelphis coola.|$|R

5000|$|In {{the first}} round, Tinker and Ball were let loose, and both made a gallant attack; the lion having waited {{for them as}} if aware of the {{approach}} of his foes. He showed himself a forest lion, and fought like one. He clapped his paw upon poor Ball, took Tinker in his teeth, and deliberately walked round the stage with him as a cat would with a mouse. Ball, released from the <b>paw,</b> <b>worked</b> all he could, but Wallace treated his slight punishment by a kick now and then. He at length dropped Tinker, and that poor animal crawled off the stage {{as well as he}} could. The lion then seized Ball by the mouth, and played precisely the same game with him as if he had actually been trained to it. Ball would have been almost devoured, but his second got hold of him through the bars, and hauled him away. Turpin, a London, and Sweep, a Liverpool dog, made an excellent attack, but it was three or four minutes before the ingenuity of their seconds could get them on. Wallace squatted on his haunches, and placed himself erect at the slope where the dogs mounted the stage, as if he thought they dared not approach. The dogs, when on, fought gallantly; but both were vanquished {{in less than a minute}} after their attack. The London dog bolted as soon as he could extricate himself from the lion's grasp, but Sweep would have been killed on the spot, but he was released. Wedgbury untied Billy and Tiger, casting a most piteous look upon the wounded dogs around him. Both went to work. Wallace seized Billy by the loins, and when shaking him, Tiger having run away, Wedgbury cried out, 'There, you see how you've gammoned me to have the best dog in England killed.' Billy, however, escaped with his life; he was dragged through the railing, after having received a mark in the loins, which (if he recovers at all) will probably render him unfit for any future contest. The victory of course was declared in favour of the lion. Several well-dressed women viewed the contest from the upper apartment of the factory." ...|$|R

50|$|Paw Oo Thet's second genre was his {{free-standing}} watercolor paintings, sold {{to private}} collectors, to be framed and hung in homes or offies. These paintings borrowed much from Dong Kingman with their bold vibrant colors, but not often of Kingman's fluid composition. Many of these paintings {{were done in}} a geometric format, semi-cubist in style, {{and it seems that}} Paw Oo Thet's largest inspiration here came from his training in modernistic painting and design from Kin Maung (Bank). The paintings were often of market or village scenes or squeezed arrangements of temples, the last typical of some of Kin Maung's oil <b>work.</b> <b>Paw</b> Oo Thet's taste for cartoon passed over into this work also, as one of the singular marks in these watercolor paintings are the wide, exaggerated comic grins on the faces of figures. These cheerful paintings had many fans among Burmese, and they sold at a price which could be afforded by middle-class Burmese. These may be called Paw Oo Thet's commercial work, his bread and butter. It is said of these paintings that his nephew, the tapestry artist Sein Myint, would copy Paw Oo Thet's paintings, and sometimes Sein Myint completed the copy before the original was done.|$|R
40|$|Robert K. Anderson {{was born}} in Colorado in 1922. He {{received}} his DVM from Colorado State University in 1944 and an MPH from the University of Michigan in 1950. He {{served in the military}} from 1944 to 1946. He practiced veterinary medicine in 1944 and 1946, before and after serving in the military. He worked as Chief of Veterinary Public Health Services for the City of Denver from 1947 to 1956 and as an instructor at the University of Colorado Medical School from 1950 to 1956. In 1956, he came to the University of Minnesota with a joint appointment as a faculty member in the School of Veterinary Medicine and the School of Public Health. He served as the Associate Dean of the College of Veterinary Medicine from 1965 to 1971. With Ruth Foster, he invented the Gentle Leader® Headcollar in 1982. In his dual roles in Veterinary Medicine and Public Health, Anderson co-founded and served as director of CENSHARE, the Center to Study Human-Animal Relationships and Environments, one of the first centers to train and promote companion animal therapy. He retired in 1985. He served as a professor emeritus in both the School of Public Health and the College of Veterinary Medicine until his death on October 12, 2012. In the first interview, Robert K. Anderson begins by describing his background, including his childhood, education, his service in the military, his early career, and his reasons for pursuing degrees in veterinary medicine and public health. He discusses his experiences on the faculty of the University of Colorado Medical School, in private practice, as a faculty member of the University of Minnesota, and as an epidemiology teacher for the Pan American Health Organization. He goes on to describe the following: One Health and comparative health; collaboration among the different health science units at the University; his research on brucellosis; his work with rabies for Veterinary Public Health in Denver; the College of Veterinary Medicine’s (CVM) accreditation; the relationship among Veterinary Medicine, UMN central administration, and the Legislature; comparative funding for the CVM and the School of Public Health; and the CVM’s relationship with industry and the USDA. Concerning education within the CVM, Anderson discusses his teaching, the growth of veterinary manpower, women in veterinary medicine, and the recruiting of minority students. He then explores the merging of the CVM with the health sciences and his research on radiation and bovine leukemia. Later in his career, Anderson studied psychology, which led to his interest in human-animal bonds and animal behavior. He considers this work as foundational to creating the Gentle Leader®, reforming his beliefs about dog training, and prompting the establishment of the American College of Veterinary Behaviors, the Delta Society, and the Center to Study Human Animal Relationships and Environments. Among the figures he discusses in his interview, Anderson is particularly attentive to the roles of William T. S. Thorp, Joseph Massey, and Sidney Ewing in his career. In the second interview, Robert K. Anderson and David Garloff focus most of their discussion on the Center to Study Human-Animal Bonds and Environments (CENSHARE), including its establishment, research, interactions with other university centers, and programs doing work on human-animal bonds, funding, educational programs and courses, its products and programs, many of the people and volunteers involved over the years, and other topics. They also discuss Temple Grandin, the Gentle Leader®, NIH funding of veterinary medicine studies, the Delta Society, Helping <b>Paws,</b> Anderson’s <b>work</b> as Chief of Veterinary Public Health Services for Denver, and disease transmission between animals and humans...|$|R
