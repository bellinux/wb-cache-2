In Canada, clinical chemists {{are members of the}} medical laboratory management team that consists of pathologists, laboratory managers and senior technologists. They are primarily responsible for setting the standards of performance for the clinical biochemistry laboratory.

They monitor the quality of the testing services and act as technical experts to evaluate and select methods and instrumentation.

40|$|COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY IN TESTING Although {{computers}} {{have had an}} important role in educational and psychological testing for decades, the widespread availability of personal computers has focused interest on the appropriate role of computerization in the development, administration, scoring, and <b>interpretation</b> <b>of</b> <b>tests.</b> Although the early decades of computer usage found hardware and services concentrated in large computer installations, future decades will find hardware and services distributed more widely among individual users. With this rapid diffusion of technology and the lightning speed with which technology is changing, it will be increasingly difficult to predict the directions that computerized testing will take. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to discuss some broad themes in the future of computer technology as applied to testing, but, at the same time, restricting the discussion to methodology and usages that appear feasible for application in the near future. Although it is always tempting in the discussion of any innovation, this review will resist the urge to view computerized testing or computerized <b>interpretation</b> <b>of</b> <b>tests</b> as a panacea for all of the limitations of non-automated procedures. In fact, computerized test interpretation raises several new ethical issues and complications that magnify the latent problems of inexperienced test users (Zachary 2 ̆ 6 Pope, 1983). It remains clear that skillful and imaginative clinical use of tests and assessment will always require the reasoned guidance of the experienced professional. Computers remain a tool to the professional, admittedly a more complex tool than previously available to the individual user. This chapter has two time perspectives: (1) current status and (2) future directions. Within each of these perspectives, four areas of computerization are discussed: (a) aides to test development, (b) test administration, (c) scoring, and (d) the interpretation of test results...|$|E

This paper compares two specimen designs with a different length-to-width ratio through finite element analysis, using a design-of-experiments approach to account for different influential factors. The results reveal significant differences between the <b>interpretation</b> <b>of</b> <b>tests</b> with net section collapse and gross section collapse, promoted by weld strength overmatch. Further, both investigated designs tend to provide similar estimates of failure mode, strain capacity and crack driving force.

These fi ve sources are validity evidence based on test content, response processes, internal structure, relations to other variables, and testing consequences. In this article, we describe validity evidence based on test content. Our goals are to describe (a) content validity evidence, (b) methods for gathering content validity data, and (c) methods for analyzing and summarizing content validity data.

A 72 hour fast demonstrated hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia. Abdominal CT scan and endoscopic ultrasound guided biopsy demonstrated a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (pNET). Symptoms persisted despite pNET resection and on further testing he was found to have a highly specific insulin antibody resulting in insulin autoimmune syndrome. He responded well to prednisone therapy with resolution of hypoglycemia and decline in the insulin autoantibody titers. This study concludes that autoimmune forms of hypoglycemia are uncommon and <b>interpretation</b> <b>of</b> <b>tests</b> can be challenging.

40|$|In the {{clinical}} laboratory to allow an effective testing process, post-analytical activity can have two goals {{in trying to}} improve patient safety: result interpretation and communication of critical values.

With the awareness that the incorrect <b>interpretation</b> <b>of</b> <b>tests</b> and the breakdown in the communication of critical values are preventable errors, laboratorians should {{make every effort to}} prevent the types of errors that potentially harm patients. In order to improve the reliability of laboratories, we attempt to explain how interpretative reporting and automated notification of critical values can be used to reduce errors.
