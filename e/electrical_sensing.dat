His approach uses electrical signals for high-sensitivity, label-free detection, {{for use in}} wireless/remote medical applications. More recently, Lieber demonstrated a general approach to overcome the Debye screening that makes these measurements challenging in physiological conditions, overcoming the limitations of sensing with silicon nanowire field-effect devices and opening the way to their use in diagnostic healthcare applications. Lieber has also developed nanoelectronic devices for cell/tissue electrophysiology, showing that electrical activity and action potential propagation can be recorded from cultured cardiac cells with high resolution. Most recently, Lieber realized 3D nanoscale transistors in which the active transistor is separated from the connections to the outside world. His nanotechnology-enabled 3D cellular probes have shown point-like resolution in detection of single-molecules, intracellular function and even photons.|$|E

The work is the basis of a new startup (Daktari, Inc.) and is being applied to detection of CD4+ white blood cells for the global health and detection of AIDs/HIV infection. Prof. Bashir has continued his impact on development of electrical based biosensors by developing selective nanopore channel sensors which showed that short 18mer single stranded DNA molecules (akin to miRNA molecules) cane detected selectively using Solid State Nanopore Sensors that are functionalized with DNA molecules. This new class of hybrid Nanopore sensors combines the power of solid state devices with exquisite selectivity of biological molecules.|$|E
