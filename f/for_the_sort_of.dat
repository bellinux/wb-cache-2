25|$|The United Kingdom, Ireland and France {{shared the}} hosting of the 1991 Rugby World Cup. Twickenham was used during pool A England matches. Twickenham was also {{host of the}} 1991 Rugby World Cup Final in which Australia beat England 12-6. For this game, England changed their style of play, opting <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> running game that had brought them victory against Ireland in the March 1988 game {{referred}} to above. During this match, with the English facing a 12-3 deficit, David Campese reached one-handed for a ball thrown to England winger, Rory Underwood. He dropped it and the ball rolled forward, gifting England a penalty {{that proved to be}} the last score of the game. Some have claimed that Campese's action should have been interpreted as a deliberate professional foul, with possible disciplinary action against the Australian player. However, on the same ground in November 1988, Campese had intercepted a similar pass and run the length of the field to score a try.|$|E
25|$|Because Sum and Product are binary operations, M6 and M7 {{admit the}} sum and product {{of only a}} finite number of objects. The fusion axiom, M8, enables taking the sum of {{infinitely}} many objects. The same holds for Product, when defined. At this point, mereology often invokes set theory, but any recourse to set theory is eliminable by replacing a formula with a quantified variable ranging over a universe of sets by a schematic formula with one free variable. The formula comes out true (is satisfied) whenever the name of an object that would {{be a member of the}} set (if it existed) replaces the free variable. Hence any axiom with sets can be replaced by an axiom schema with monadic atomic subformulae. M8 and M8' are schemas of just this sort. The syntax of a first-order theory can describe only a denumerable number of sets; hence, only denumerably many sets may be eliminated in this fashion, but this limitation is not binding <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> mathematics contemplated here.|$|E

Botham did not win any man of the match awards in the World Cup until 1992 when he won two.

Against Australia at Sydney Cricket Ground later in the competition, Botham won the award <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> all-round performance which had made his reputation. Australia won the toss and decided to bat first. They scored 171 all out in 49 overs and Botham took four for 31 in his ten.

500|$|Balzac's {{inspiration}} for the characters of Hector and Adeline remain unclear, but several critics have been eager to speculate. Three officers named Hulot were recognized for their valor in the Napoleonic Wars, and some suggest that Balzac borrowed the name of Comte Hector d'Aure. None of these men, however, were known <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> philandering or thievery exhibited by Baron Hulot in the novel.

Balzac's friend Victor Hugo, meanwhile, was famously discovered in bed with his mistress in July 1845. The similarity of his name to Hector Hulot (and that of his wife's maiden name, Adèle Foucher, to Adeline Fischer) has been posited as a possible indication of the characters' origins.|$|E

500|$|Another {{view is that}} Section 3 {{provides}} a much strengthened basis <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> [...] "weak review" [...] the scope of which carefully determined between courts {{on one hand and}} parliament on the other [...] in a statutory form. There have been at least three criticisms put forward: firstly that the impossibility of implied repeal goes against some formulations of parliamentary sovereignty that require that no parliament can bind a future parliament. Secondly, whether section 3 interpretations follow parliamentary intent is questionable; thirdly, if it does allow interpretations contrary to intent, section 3 may render section 4 necessary. However, judicial powers are probably not unconstrained. The analysis of what the courts can and cannot do would also provide the answer the third criticism, depending on the viewpoint. Whilst the scope of section 3 has been criticised for being vague, and leading therefore more easily to the imposition of the judiciary on the legal domain of parliament, this viewpoint is controversial: they do not seem to have yet so encroached and there are rules emerging about the application of section 3.|$|E

40|$|Actin-severing {{proteins}} ADF/cofilin {{are required}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sorting</b> <b>of</b> secretory cargo at the trans-Golgi network (TGN) in mammalian cells. How do these cytoplasmic proteins {{interact with the}} cargoes in the lumen of the TGN? Put simply, how are these two sets of proteins connected across the TGN membrane? Mass spectrometry of cofilin 1 immunoprecipitated from HeLa cells revealed the presence of actin and the Ca(2 +) ATPase SPCA 1. Moreover, cofilin 1 was localized to the TGN and bound to SPCA 1 via dynamic actin. SPCA 1 knockdown, like ADF/cofilin 1 knockdown, inhibited Ca(2 +) uptake into the TGN and caused missorting of secretory cargo. These defects were rescued by the overexpression of the TGN-localized SPCA 1. We propose that ADF/cofilin-dependent severing of actin filaments exposes and promotes the activation of SPCA 1, which pumps Ca(2 +) into the lumen <b>of</b> <b>the</b> TGN <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sorting</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> class of secretory cargo that binds Ca(2 +) ...|$|R

Among these conditions the most important ones are that the purchaser should carefully examine whether the slave who is put up for sale has been justly or unjustly deprived of his liberty, and that the vendor should do nothing which might endanger the life, virtue or Catholic faith of the slave who is to be transferred to another's possession." ...|$|E
