40|$|Background:Chronic obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD) {{is a major}} cause of morbidity and mortality, and is an important health economic problem. Since 1960, there has been an increase in mortality associated with COPD, especially in men. Acute exacerbations form a major component of the socioeconomic burden of COPD which mainly results in long-term hospitalization. Despite the high number of COPD-related hospitalizations, relatively {{little is known about the}} mortality rate and related determinants of patients hospitalized for this acute deterioration in the clinical course of COPD. The aim of this study was to evaluate the factors affecting <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>hospitalization</b> in Iranian patients with COPD.   Methods: This cross-sectional study was performed on 68 COPD patients who were   hospitalized in Rasool-e-Akram hospital in Tehran, Iran for the period 2005 - 2006. During hospitalization, patients’ chief complaint, symptoms and signs, results of physical examinations,spirometry, arterial blood gas (ABG) and ICU admission were recorded. Data were analyzed using Independent T-test, One Way ANOVAand Correlation tests. Results: The patients were 41 (60. 3 %) males and 27 (39. 7 %) females with the mean age of 69. 7 (SD= 13. 52) years. The mean <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>hospitalization</b> was 11. 82 (SD= 5. 49) days and 3 (4. 4 %) patients died. The family history of {{pulmonary disease}} (P= 0. 018), habitual snoring (P= 0. 031), and mean baseline arterial PaO 2 (P= 0. 010, r= - 0. 361) were determined as factors affecting <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>hospitalization.</b> On the other hand, other factors such as smoking (P= 0. 992), patient’s gender (P= 0. 735) and spirometric indices did not significantly associate with <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>hospitalization.</b>   Conclusion: The fact that people hospitalized with COPD have a subsequently increased risk of death compared with those not hospitalized suggests the former are an atrisk group and shows the importance of factors affecting <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>hospitalization.</b> Our results show that more attention must be paid on habitual snoring and low arterial pO 2 which may have potential effects on <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>hospitalization</b> in COPD patients. ...|$|E

We related smoking and alcohol to hospital admission from any cause, smoking- and alcohol-related diseases and <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>hospitalization</b> in a two-part random effects model. Results: Smoking status was strongly associated with admission and <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>hospitalization.</b> For smoking-related admissions, odds ratios (OR) of 2. 77 (95 % CI 2. 13 – 3. 59) in men and 6. 30 (95 % CI 4. 80 – 8. 26) in women were observed among smokers of> 20 g/day compared to never-smokers.

40|$|PurposeAcute {{pericarditis}} {{is rather}} frequent. Annual incidence {{is estimated to}} 27. 7 new cases per 100, 000 inhabitants in Europe. About 5 % of all non-ischemic chest pains admitted at emergencies could be pericarditis. Most of the patients are young patients, with a significant cost to society, particularly as regards hospitalizations. Indeed, pericarditis represents 1 % <b>of</b> all <b>hospitalizations</b> in department <b>of</b> cardiology. It could be very interesting if clinical presentation and especially heart rate could help predict <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>hospitalizations.</b> MethodsBetween March 2007 and February 2010, we conducted a retrospective study concerning all patients admitted in our center for acute pericarditis. Diagnosis criteria included 2 among the 4 following: typical chest pain, friction rub, pericardial effusion on echocardiography, or typical ECG findings. We evaluated hospital events (heart failure, acute pains, death) and biology during hospitalization (CRP on admission, on days 1, 2, 3, and especially peak). At one month, clinical events were recorded through phone calls when not noticed in clinical settings. ResultsWe included 73 patients. Mean age was 41. 0 y (CI 95 % 37. 2 - 44. 8) and mean hospitalization duration was 3. 5 d (2. 5 - 4. 5). Heart rate on admission was 88 bpm (83. 6 - 92. 4) and 71. 8 bpm (68. 9 - 74. 7) on discharge. CRP peak was strongly correlated with heart rate (r= 0. 54; p< 0. 0001) and with hospitalization duration (r= 0. 8; p= 0. 007). Finally, we found {{a positive correlation between}} heart rate on admission and <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>hospitalizations</b> (r= 0, 226; p< 0. 06).

ConclusionIn acute pericarditis, cardiac frequency at admission is correlated with hospitalization duration, and could be a new prognostic marker. This point deserves to be explored, in order to reduce hospitalization duration...|$|R
40|$|Background: Normal vaginal {{delivery}} {{is the best}} method of delivery. Vaginal {{delivery is}} followed by the best pregnancy outcomes. Reducing the rate of cesarean delivery has been a health goal for the United States with economic and social advantages. This study has been conducted with aim of maternal and neonatal outcomes of Normal Vaginal Delivery (NVD) and comparing with cesarean delivery. Methods: This descriptive- analytic study was conducted in Ghaem University Hospital in Mashhad during years 2007 until 2013. Five hundred thirty six full term infants aged 3 - 14 day, born either by NVD as control group or cesarean delivery as case group par-ticipated in this study. Sampling was a convenient method. The data in questionnaire containing maternal information (maternal age, mode of delivery, maternal weight, du-ration <b>of</b> delivery, <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> maternal <b>hospitalization,</b> let down reflex, breast feeding status) and neonatal information (age, sex, Apgar score, urination frequency and defe-cation frequency) were collected by a researcher. Results: According to the findings of this study, the infant’s age (P= 0. 425), admission weight (P= 0. 278), jaundice access (P= 0. 162), urination frequency (P= 0. 165), maternal weight (P= 0. 869) showed no statistically significant difference between two delivery methods. Time of the first breast feeding after childbirth (P= 0. 000), defecation fre-quency (P= 0. 000), maternal age (P= 0. 000), maternal parity (P= 0. 003), <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> de-livery (P= 0. 000), <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> maternal <b>hospitalization</b> (P= 0. 025), feeding position (P= 0. 029), let down reflex (P= 0. 012), mastitis (P= 0. 025) and breast problems (P= 0. 027) showed statistically significant difference between the groups. It means defecation frequency, <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> maternal <b>hospitalization,</b> Apgar score, mastitis and breast problems were more in cesarean group, but early breast feeding after delivery, <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> delivery, proper breastfeeding position and let down reflex were more in NVD group.
