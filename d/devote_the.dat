5|$|England {{hosted the}} first three competitions. The ICC decided that England should host the first tournament because it was ready to <b>devote</b> <b>the</b> {{resources}} required to organising the inaugural event. India volunteered to host the third Cricket World Cup, but most ICC members preferred England as the longer period of daylight in England in June meant that a match could be completed in one day. The 1987 Cricket World Cup was held in India and Pakistan, the first hosted outside England.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{conditions}} of the 1982 competition was that the new wing had to include commercial offices as well as public gallery space. However, in 1985 it became possible to <b>devote</b> <b>the</b> extension entirely to the Gallery's uses, due to a donation of almost £50 million from Lord Sainsbury and his brothers Simon and Sir Tim Sainsbury. A closed competition was held, and the schemes produced were noticeably more restrained than in the earlier competition.|$|E
5|$|While McLaren {{once again}} succeeded in {{advancing}} both cars into Q2, Fernando Alonso's car {{stopped in the}} first corner due to an electrical fault {{at the start of}} the second session, and he took no further part in qualifying. Team mate Jenson Button was more successful, missing out on Q3 when his second fast lap was interrupted by Nico Rosberg going off at Sainte <b>Dévote.</b> <b>The</b> second Williams of Felipe Massa completed a problematic Saturday for the team, claiming only 14th on the grid, while Nico Hülkenberg and Romain Grosjean also did not make it into Q3.|$|E

25|$|Bad Brains were {{plagued by}} {{internal}} tensions nearly from their beginning.

25|$|On March 7, 2005, Thorsteinson {{announced}} his resignation {{as leader of}} the Alberta Alliance, citing {{that he would not be}} able to <b>devote</b> <b>the</b> time and energy into the party.

Eleanor Maroes was appointed leader by the Provincial Council to serve in the interim until the new leader was chosen.|$|E

However, when looking at illegal immigration, PBS dedicated much less coverage than CBS, while CNN gave more coverage than Fox.|$|R

On 27 July 2006, the WPBSA confirmed that, following a members' vote, the organisation's rules would be changed to allow Hunter to sit out the entire 2006/2007 season with his world ranking frozen at 34. He intended to <b>devote</b> <b>the</b> year to treatment for his cancer.|$|E
25|$|Shortly after World War I, the yeshiva {{managed to}} leave Russia and {{to return to}} Slabodka, which, after the war, was re-annexed to Lithuania. At one point, the Alter asked Rabbi Sarna to deliver shiurim (lectures) in the yeshiva, but he {{declined}} the offer, explaining that he preferred to <b>devote</b> <b>the</b> early {{years of his life}} to Torah study. Although Rabbi Sarna held no official position in the yeshiva, his influence there was keenly felt.|$|E
25|$|Dallaire {{resigned}} from the Senate on June 17, 2014, seven years prior to reaching mandatory retirement.

25|$|From 1667 through 1674, Swammerdam {{continued}} his research and published three books. In 1675, he {{came under the}} influence of the Flemish mystic, Antoinette Bourignon, renounced his work, and decided to <b>devote</b> <b>the</b> remainder of his life to spiritual matters. Niels Stensen, a gifted anatomist, and once his co-student, invited him to work for the Duke of Tuscany, but Swammerdam refused. The grand duke of Tuscany offered 12,000 florins for Swammerdam's collection, on condition of Swammerdam coming to Florence to continue it.|$|E
25|$|The union {{might have}} escaped this {{disaster}} {{if it had}} characterized the strike as a first step, rather than attempting to pass it off as a victory. That, however, would have required that the union also <b>devote</b> <b>the</b> resources necessary to follow up with renewed, systematic organizing efforts {{in the immediate aftermath}} of the strike, instead of concerning itself with the futile effort to win reinstatement for discharged strikers through the Textile Labor Board. The memory of blacklisting and defeat soured many Southern textile workers on unions for decades.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the debate}} was planned to focus on foreign policy and {{national}} security, Lehrer did <b>devote</b> <b>the</b> {{first half of the}} debate to the ongoing financial crisis. McCain repeatedly referred to his experience, drawing on stories from the past. Often, he joked of his age and at one point seemed to mock his opponent. Obama tied McCain to what he characterized as Bush Administration mistakes and repeatedly laid out detailed plans. Neither McCain nor Obama broke from talking points, and neither candidate made any major gaffe.|$|E

25|$|What {{is there}} that any man desires,—any man or any woman,—that does not lose half its value when it {{is found to be}} easy of access and easy of possession? Wine is valued by its price, not its flavour. Open your doors freely to Jones and Smith, and Jones and Smith will not care to enter them. Shut your doors obdurately against the same gentlemen, and they will use all their little {{diplomacy}} to effect an entrance. Captain Aylmer, when he heard the hearty tone of the girl’s answer, already began almost to doubt whether it was wise on his part to <b>devote</b> <b>the</b> innermost bin of his cellar to wine that was so cheap.|$|E
25|$|One belief {{was that}} American Indians were too unsophisticated to have {{constructed}} such complex earthworks and artifacts. The associated stone, metal, and clay artifacts {{were thought to}} be too complex for the Indians to have made. In the American Southeast, and Midwest, numerous Indian cultures were sedentary and used agriculture. Numerous Indian towns had built surrounding stockades for defense. Capable of this type of construction, they and ancestors could have built mounds, but people who believed that the Indians did not build the earthworks did not analyze it in this manner. They thought the Native American nomadic cultures would not organize to build such monuments, for failure to <b>devote</b> <b>the</b> time and effort to construct such time-consuming projects.|$|E
25|$|Proenneke {{enlisted in}} the United States Navy {{the day after the}} attack on Pearl Harbor and served as a carpenter. He spent close to two years at Pearl Harbor and was later {{stationed}} in San Francisco waiting to join a new ship assignment. After hiking a mountain near San Francisco he contracted rheumatic fever and was hospitalized at Norco Naval Hospital for six months. During his convalescence the war ended and he was given a medical discharge from the Navy in 1945. According to friend and writer Sam Keith, the illness was very revealing for Proenneke, who decided to <b>devote</b> <b>the</b> rest of his life to the strength and health of his body.|$|E

25|$|Gleason {{kicked off}} the 1966–1967 season with new, color episodes of The Honeymooners. Carney {{returned}} as Ed Norton, with MacRae as Alice and Kean as Trixie. The sketches were remakes of the 1957 world-tour episodes, in which Kramden and Norton win a slogan contest and take their wives to international destinations. Each of the nine episodes was a full-scale musical comedy, with Gleason and company performing original songs by Lyn Duddy and Jerry Bresler. Occasionally Gleason would <b>devote</b> <b>the</b> show to musicals with a single theme, such as college comedy or political satire, with the stars abandoning their Honeymooners roles for different character roles. This was the show's format until its cancellation in 1970. (The exception was the 1968–1969 season, which had no hour-long Honeymooners episodes; that season, The Honeymooners was presented only in short sketches). The musicals pushed Gleason back into the top five in ratings, but audiences soon began to decline. By its final season, Gleason's show {{was no longer in}} the top 25. In the last original Honeymooners episode aired on CBS ("Operation Protest"), Ralph encounters the youth-protest movement of the late 1960s, a sign of changing times in both television and society.|$|E

500|$|Over {{the course}} of their construction, Rivadavia and Moreno were the subject of various rumors insinuating that Argentina would accept the ships and then sell them to a European country or Japan, a fast-growing rival to the United States. The rumors were {{partially}} true; Argentina was looking {{to get rid of the}} battleships and <b>devote</b> <b>the</b> proceeds to opening more schools. This angered the American government, which did not want its warship technology offered to the highest bidder—yet they did not want to exercise a contract-specified option that gave the United States first choice if the Argentines decided to sell, as naval technology had already progressed past the Rivadavias, particularly in the adoption of the [...] "all-or-nothing" [...] armor scheme. Instead, the United States and its State Department and Navy Department put diplomatic pressure on the Argentine government.|$|E
