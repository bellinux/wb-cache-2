The present work investigates {{the potential of}} <b>food</b> <b>proteins</b> as safer stabilizers for nanoemulsions to deliver hydrophobic drugs. Nanoemulsions stabilized by <b>food</b> <b>proteins</b> (soybean protein isolate, whey protein isolate, β-lactoglobulin) were prepared by high-pressure homogenization. The toxicity of the nanoemulsions was tested in Caco- 2 cells using the 3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazoliumbromide viability assay. In vivo absorption in rats was also evaluated. Food protein-stabilized nanoemulsions, with small particle size and good size distribution, exhibited better stability and biocompatibility compared with nanoemulsions stabilized by traditional emulsifiers. Moreover, β-lactoglobulin had a better emulsifying capacity and biocompatibility {{than the other two}} <b>food</b> <b>proteins.</b> The pancreatic degradation of the proteins accelerated drug release.

40|$|The current {{methodology}} {{to identify}} allergenic <b>food</b> <b>proteins</b> {{is effective in}} identifying those {{that are likely to}} cross-react with known allergens. However, most assays show false positive results for low/non-allergens. Therefore, an ex vivo/in vitro DC-T cell assay and an in vivo mouse model were used to distinguish known allergenic <b>food</b> <b>proteins</b> (Ara h 1, β-Lactoglobulin, Pan b 1, bovine serum albumin, whey protein isolate) from low/non allergenic <b>food</b> <b>proteins</b> (soy lipoxygenase, gelatin, beef tropomyosin, rubisco, Sola t 1). CD 4 + T cells from protein/alum-immunized mice were incubated with corresponding protein-pulsed bone marrow-derived DC and analyzed for cytokine release. All known allergens induced Th 2 responses in vitro, whereas soy lipoxygenase, gelatin or beef tropomyosin did not. Sola t 1 and rubisco induced a more generalized T cell response due to endotoxin contamination, indicating the endotoxin-sensitivity of the DC-T assay. To analyze responses in vivo, mice were orally sensitized on days 0 and 7. Known allergens induced IgE and mMCP- 1 release upon oral challenge at day 16, whereas the low/non-allergens did not. Both the DC-T cell assay and the mouse model were able to distinguish 5 known allergens from 5 low/non-allergens and may be useful to identify novel allergenic <b>food</b> <b>proteins.</b> © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Lt...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Food allergies affect an {{estimated}} 3 to 4 % of adults {{and up to}} 8 % of children in developed western countries. Results from in vitro simulated gastric digestion studies with purified proteins are routinely {{used to assess the}} allergenic potential of novel <b>food</b> <b>proteins.</b> The digestion of purified proteins in simulated gastric fluid typically progresses in an exponential fashion allowing persistence to be quantified using pseudo-first-order rate constants or half lives. However, the persistence of purified proteins in simulated gastric fluid is a poor predictor of the allergenic status of <b>food</b> <b>proteins,</b> potentially due to food matrix effects that can be significant in vivo. The evaluation of the persistence of novel proteins in whole, prepared food exposed to simulated gastric fluid may provide a more correlative result, but such assays should be thoroughly validated to demonstrate a predictive capacity before they are accepted to predict the allergenic potential of novel <b>food</b> <b>proteins.</b> </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{need for}} widely {{accepted}} and validated animal models {{to test the}} potential allergenicity and potency of novel (biotechnology-derived) proteins has become an important issue for their safety evaluation. In this article, we summarize {{the results of the}} development of an oral sensitization protocol for <b>food</b> <b>proteins</b> in the rat. Young Brown Norway rats were exposed to either various purified allergenic proteins (e. g., ovalbumin, partly purified), a whole food (cow’s milk), or total protein extracts (hen’s egg white, peanut) by daily gavage dosing during 42 days without the use of an adjuvant. The results showed that Brown Norway rats can be sensitized orally to the various allergenic <b>food</b> <b>proteins</b> tested, resulting in antigen-specific immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgE responses, without the use of adjuvants. Animals orally exposed to cow’s milk or total protein extracts of egg white also developed specific IgE and IgG antibodies that recognized the same proteins compared with antibodies from patients allergic to egg white or cow’s milk. We also studied local and systemic immune-mediated effects. In ovalbumin-sensitized rats, some clinical symptoms of food allergy were studied upon an oral challenge with ovalbumin. The results demonstrated that gut permeability was increased and that in some animals breathing frequency and systolic blood pressure were temporarily decreased.
