Similar to the {{mentioned}} above molecular bistability {{induced by the}} hidden PJTE, a magnetic-dielectric bistability due to two coexisting equilibrium configurations with corresponding properties may take place also in crystals with transition metal centers, subject to the electronic configuration with half-filled e2 or t3 shells. As in molecular systems, the latter produce a hidden PJTE and local bistability which, distinguished from the molecular case, are enhanced by the cooperative interactions, thus acquiring larger lifetimes. This crystal bistability was proved by calculations for LiCuO2 and NaCuO2 crystals, in which the Cu3+ ion has the electronic e2(d8) configuration (similar to the CuF3 molecule). Giant enhancement of observable properties in interaction with external perturbations. In a recent development of the PJTE applications in materials science it was shown that in crystals with PJTE centers, in which the local distortion are not ordered (before the phase transition to the cooperative phases), the effect of interaction with external perturbations acquires an orientational contribution which enhances the observable properties by several orders of magnitude. This was demonstrated on the properties of crystals like paraelectric BaTiO3 in interaction with electric fields (in permittivity and electrostriction), or under a strain gradient (<b>flexoelectricity).</b> These giant enhancement effects occur due to the dynamic nature of the PJTE local dipolar distortions (their tunneling between the equivalent minima); the independently rotating dipole moments on each center become oriented (frozen) along the external perturbation resulting in an orientational polarization which is not there {{in the absence of}} the PJTE ...|$|E

40|$|<b>Flexoelectricity</b> is a {{universal}} property of all dielectrics by which they generate a voltage {{in response to an}} inhomogeneous deformation. One of the controversial issues in this field concerns the magnitude of flexoelectric coefficients measured experimentally, which greatly exceed theoretical estimates. Furthermore, there is a broad scatter amongst experimental measurements. The truncated pyramid compression method is one of the common setups to quantify <b>flexoelectricity,</b> the interpretation of which relies on simplified analytical equations to estimate strain gradients. However, the deformation fields in three-dimensional pyramid configurations are highly complex, particularly around its edges. In the present work, using three-dimensional self-consistent simulations of <b>flexoelectricity,</b> we show that the simplified analytical estimations of strain gradients in compressed pyramids significantly overestimate flexoelectric coefficients, thus providing a possible explanation to reconcile different estimates. In fact, the interpretation of pyramid compression experiments is highly nontrivial. We systematically characterize the magnitude of this overestimation, of over one order of magnitude, {{as a function of the}} truncated pyramid configuration.
