50|$|The Electronics Division {{was formed}} in 1948. Its {{progress}} was rapid and the Division also designed and manufactured such diverse specialist equipment as Analogue Computers, Control Simulators {{and a variety of}} Electronic Equipment and Electronic Test sets associated with Guided Weapons. When using strain gauges of the normal wire type in the dynamic testing of helicopter components, notably rotor blades, Saunders-Roe found that such a high proportion of the gauges were failing that development was considerably retarded. The Electronics Division was therefore asked to devise an improved gauge and, in collaboration with Messrs. Technograph Printed Circuits Ltd., produced the <b>foil</b> <b>strain</b> gauge.|$|E
40|$|Three {{distinct}} strain {{measurement methods}} (i. e., <b>foil</b> resistance <b>strain</b> gages, fiber optic strain sensors, and a three-dimensional digital image photogrammetry that gives full field strain and displacement measurements) were implemented to measure strains {{on the back}} and front surfaces of a longitudinally jointed curved test article subjected to edge-wise compression testing, at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, according to ASTM C 364. The pre-test finite element analysis (FEA) was conducted to assess ultimate failure load and predict strain distribution pattern throughout the test coupon. The predicted strain pattern contours were then utilized as guidelines for installing the strain measurement instrumentations. The <b>foil</b> resistance <b>strain</b> gages and fiber optic strain sensors were bonded on the specimen at locations with nearly the same analytically predicted strain values, and {{as close as possible to}} each other, so that, comparisons between the measured strains by strain gages and fiber optic sensors, as well as the three-dimensional digital image photogrammetric system are relevant. The test article was loaded to failure (at ~ 167 kN), at the compressive strain value of ~ 10, 000 micro epsilon. As a part of this study, the validity of the measured strains by fiber optic sensors is examined against the <b>foil</b> resistance <b>strain</b> gages and the three-dimensional digital image photogrammetric data, and comprehensive comparisons are made with FEA predictions...|$|R

For a structural model of gravity dam section, beside installing displacement transducers and <b>foil</b> resistance <b>strain</b> gauges on the surface, fiber grating sensors were installed in dam body and dam foundation so that the internal displacement of structural mode could be monitored during overloading.

50|$|So {{far there}} has been only one {{published}} scientific experiment on {{the source of the}} ringing ability. In the 1960s a Rutgers University professor did an informal experiment where specimens of 'live' and 'dead' ringing rock boulders from the Bucks County park site were sawn into thin slices and then measured for changes in shape (Gibbons 1970). The rock slices were measured with delicate <b>foil</b> <b>strain</b> gauges which could measure minute changes in size. According to the professor, the dead rocks showed no change after the rocks were sawn, however the live rocks showed a distinctive expansion or 'relaxation' within 24 hours after they were cut. This relaxation indicates that the rock was under internal elastic stresses which were released by the mechanical sawing of the rock. The professor went on to make the observation that the live rocks were generally found toward the middle of the boulder fields where they did not come in contact with soil and the shade of the surrounding trees. He then theorized that the slow weathering rate in the dry 'microclimate' of the fields caused the stresses because the outside skin of the boulders would expand due to the conversion of pyroxene to montmorillonite (a clay mineral). Boulders along the periphery of the fields weather too quickly and break apart before the stresses can develop.|$|E

MATERIALS AND METHODS In office set-ups were fabricated for different orthodontic malocclusions. PETG foils, multi-layer foils, Clear Aligner expansion screws and acrylic components {{were used for the}} manufacturing of invisible appliances. Foil thickness and heat behavior, strain values, using special strain gauges and esthetics were taken into account. A 4 week recall was scheduled in order to observe the treatment progress regarding PETG appliances. Measurements were performed to determine to optimal foil thickness. RESULTS Dental alignment and expansion were observed in all cases. Regarding behavior to heat, the 1 mm foil presented only a small reduction in thickness compared to other <b>foils</b> and the <b>strain</b> values seem to be higher for the thinner aligners. CONCLUSIONS The orthodontic appliances made out of polyethylene provide good results due to rigidity and dimensional stability.

40|$|Force and moment {{balances}} {{have proved}} to be essential in the measurement and calculation of aerodynamic properties during wind tunnel testing. With the recent advancements of technology, new fiber optic sensors have been designed to replace the conventional <b>foil</b> <b>strain</b> gage sensors commonly found on balances, thereby offering several distinct advantages. The use of fiber optic sensors on a balance brings with it some potential advantages over conventional strain gage balances including increased resolution and accuracy, insensitivity to electromagnetic interference, and the capability of use at high temperatures. By using the fiber optic sensors, some of the limitations of the conventional balance can be overcome, leading to a better overall balance design.

40|$|An {{improved}} fiber-optic {{strain gauge}} {{is capable of}} measuring strains in the approximate range of 0 to 50 microstrains with a resolution of 0. 1 microstrain. (To some extent, {{the resolution of the}} strain gauge can be tailored and may be extensible to 0. 01 microstrain.) The total cost of the hardware components of this strain gauge is less than $ 100 at 2006 prices. In comparison with prior strain gauges capable of measurement of such low strains, this strain gauge is more accurate, more economical, and more robust, and it operates at a higher update rate. Strain gauges like this one are useful mainly for measuring small strains (including those associated with vibrations) in such structures as rocket test stands, buildings, oilrigs, bridges, and dams. The technology was inspired by the need to measure very small strains on structures supporting liquid oxygen tanks, as a way to measure accurately mass of liquid oxygen during rocket engine testing. This improved fiber-optic strain gauge was developed to overcome some of the deficiencies of both traditional <b>foil</b> <b>strain</b> gauges and prior fiber-optic strain gauges. Traditional <b>foil</b> <b>strain</b> gages do not have adequate signal-to-noise ratios at such small strains.

40|$|Multifunctional {{materials}} {{both with}} damping properties and strain sensing properties are very important. They {{promise to be}} more weight-efficient, and provide volume-efficient performance, flexibility and potentially, less maintenance than traditional multi-component brass-board systems. The goal of this dissertation work was to design, synthesize, investigate and apply polyaniline/Multiwall carbon nanotube (PANI/MWCNT) and polyurethane (PU) /MWCNT composites films for structural vibration control and strain sensors using free layer damping methods and static and dynamic strain sensing test methods. The PANI/MWCNT was made by in situ polymerization of PANI {{in the presence of}} MWCNT, then frit compression was used to make circular and rectangular PANI/MWCNT composite films. PU/MWCNT composites were made by the layer-by-layer method. Free end vibration test results showed both of PANI/MWCNT and PU/MWCNT have better damping ratios than each of their components. Static sensing test indicated that though there appears to be residual strain in both composite sensors after the load is removed, both the sensor and the <b>foil</b> <b>strain</b> gage react linearly when re-engaged. A drift test of the sensor showed that it is stable. The dynamic sensing test results showed that over the range of 10 - 1000 Hz, the PANI/MWCNT composite sensor was consistently superior to <b>foil</b> <b>strain</b> gage for sensing purposes since the highest peak consistently corresponded to the input frequency and was much higher, for example, at 20 Hz, 820 times higher than those of the strain gage. Using the same criterion, the PU/Buckypaper composite sensor was comparable to or superior to the <b>foil</b> <b>strain</b> gage for sensing purposes over the range of 10 Hz to 200 Hz. The relationship of loss factor, η, and beam coverage length, L 1 /L, is discussed for single sided and double sided attachment. For both PANI/MWCNT and PU/MWCNT, the loss factor, η, was found to increase as coverage length, L 1 /L, increases. The loss factor, η, was found to have a maximum as with coverage length, L 1 /L, as the coverage length continues to increase.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe self-heating of small <b>foil</b> resistance <b>strain</b> gages is studied both analytically and experimentally. The thermal {{resistance of the}} strain gage-specimen combination is obtained and utilized in relating the steady state temperature rise of the gage grid to {{the magnitude of the}} electrical current flowing through the gage. It is shown that the primary mechanism for dissipation of the gage self=heat is conduction through the gage backing, bonding adhesive, and specimen, then radiation and convection from the specimen surfaces to the environment. The heat dissipation paths provided by the lead wires and the exposed gage grid and tab surfaces are found to account for a negligible fraction of the heat transferred. For the smallest gages the backing and adhesive contribute nearly all of the thermal resistance of the primary path. In the latter cases it is shown that gage heating is substantially independent of the thermal conductivity or size of the specimen and that the gage power dissipation per unit grid area is the dominant parameter in predicting the steady-state temperature rise of the grid.
