500|$|For {{causing the}} {{collision}} with Will Stevens, Romain Grosjean was given two penalty points on his FIA Super Licence and {{said after the}} race: [...] "I thought I was past the Manor, but it was soon clear that I wasn't. It was my fault entirely and I apologise for it. You never stop learning as a driver." [...] Meanwhile, Sebastian Vettel insisted that [...] "it was fairly clear [...] When I got close enough <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>around</b> the outside, braking later and still managing to get the corner. I was clearly ahead and then I saw him opening the brakes into {{the last part of}} the chicane, so I reacted and jumped the second part because if I started on the track, we would have crashed." [...] Nico Hülkenberg in turn declared that Vettel [...] "didn't leave me anywhere to go so to avoid contact I kept braking, lost the rear and spun". He did however voice satisfaction with his result, finishing eighth and taking four championship points.|$|E
500|$|Several {{breaking}} {{practitioners and}} pioneers tend {{to side with}} the camp that does not believe breaking came from capoeira. B-boy Crazy Legs states: [...] "We didn't know what the f-ck no capoeira was, man. We were in the ghetto!" [...] According to Pabon, [...] "Unlike the popularity of the martial arts films, capoeira was not seen in the Bronx jams until the 1990s. Top rockin' seems to have developed gradually and unintentionally, leaving space for growth and new additions, until it evolved into a codified form." [...] B-boy crew Spartanic Rockers adds: [...] "Despite of [...] many rumours and opinions Breaking didn't originate from Capoeira but during the last few years many moves, steps and freezes of this Brazilian (fight-) dance have inspired more and more B-Girls and B-Boys who integrated them into their dance." [...] B-boy Ken Swift was breaking long before he saw capoeria: [...] "In '78 I started [...] and I didn't see it [...] til '92 ... I was around, too—I was in Brooklyn, Bronx, Queens, <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>around</b> and I didn't see it. What we saw was Kung Fu—we saw Kung Fu from the 42nd Street theaters. So those were our inspirations... when we did the Kung Fu sh-t we switched it up and we put this B-boy flavor into it..." ...|$|E
500|$|Tricky {{eventually}} grew {{frustrated with}} {{his role in}} Massive Attack, finding it limiting, and wanted to record an album with a female vocalist whose singing would offer another dimension to his lyrics and their meaning. In 1993, he discovered Martina Topley-Bird, then a teenager at Clifton College, {{when he saw her}} sitting against a wall near his house, singing to herself. [...] "That's really how it happened," [...] she recalled. [...] "A few weeks later, <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>around</b> to his house with some friends. We'd been drinking cider after our GCSEs. We were banging on his door, but he wasn't in. Then Mark Stewart, who lived there, came up to us and said: 'Yeah, this is Tricky's house, jump in through the window.'" [...] Tricky, whose lyrics had matured from raps about street violence and sex to more personal and introspective writing, said Topley-Bird found his songs [...] "quite depressing", which he believed was because of her more privileged background: [...] "It's just reality. She's been a student all her life, grew up in Somerset, and I don't think she's ever faced the real world. She finds it all a bit weird. But she's my best mate." [...] They would form a musical and romantic partnership over subsequent years, and their first recording together, [...] "Aftermath", later appeared on Maxinquaye. After offering the song to Massive Attack, who were not interested in including it on their 1991 album Blue Lines, Tricky released [...] "Aftermath" [...] independently to local record stores in September 1993 before he signed a record deal with 4th & B'way.|$|E

5000|$|During a radio {{interview}} he remarked {{that he had}} always wanted a pair of checked trousers. A young boy immediately wrote that his father, a tailor, {{would be glad to}} make them for nothing. Léautaud took it as an insult and snapped, on the air, [...] "Do these people imagine <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>around</b> bare-arsed?" [...] (p. 148) ...|$|R

2500|$|From a New York Times {{interview}} in 1942: [...] "When the war started... {{felt that it}} was up to me to do something, and the only thing I know is show business. <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>around</b> during the last war and I saw that the boys needed something besides chow and drills. I knew the same was true today, so I told the people in Washington that I would go anywhere and do an act for the Army." [...] Shortly after the war began, he wrote a letter to Steven Early, press secretary to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, volunteering [...] "to head a committee for the entertainment of soldiers and said that he [...] "would work without pay... would gladly assist in the organization to be set up for this purpose". A few weeks later, he received his first tour schedule from the newly formed United Services Organization (USO), [...] "the group his letter to Early had helped create".|$|E
2500|$|Netanyahu defines {{capitalism}} as [...] "the {{ability to}} have individual initiative and competition to produce goods and services with profit, but not to shut out somebody else from {{trying to do the}} same." [...] He says that his views developed while he was working as an economic consult for Boston Consulting Group: [...] "It {{was the first time that}} the Boston Consulting Group looked at governments and worked for governments. They wanted to do a strategic plan for the government of Sweden. I was on that case and looked at other governments. So <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>around</b> to other governments in Europe in 1976 and I was looking at Britain. I was looking at France. I was looking at other countries, and I could see that they were stymied by concentrations of power that prevented competition. And I thought, hmm, as bad as they are, ours was worse because we had very little room for private sector competition to the extent that we had government-controlled or union-controlled companies, and so you really didn't get the competition or the growth... And I said, well, if I ever have a chance, I'll change that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Impossible, I think. Oh yes, quite impossible! <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>around</b> the dormitories {{as usual}} at eleven o'clock last night, {{and all the}} boys were asleep--all of them." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "No," [...] said Mary Bell. [...] "I {{will not}} stop to rest; I am not very tired; so <b>I</b> will <b>go</b> <b>around</b> by this little path. It will come into the road again very soon." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{couple of}} days later <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>around</b> to the hotel. There was Denver in his old place, looking like the hero of two {{historical}} novels, and telling 'em what a fine time he'd had down on his orange plantation in Florida.|$|E

5000|$|Sullivan {{was quick}} to take offense if {{he felt he had}} been crossed, and could hold a grudge for a long time. As he told biographer Gerald Nachman, [...] "I'm a pop-off. I flare up, then <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>around</b> apologizing." [...] "Armed with an Irish temper and thin skin," [...] wrote Nachman, [...] "Ed brought to his feuds a hunger for combat fed by his {{coverage}} of, and devotion to, boxing." [...] Bo Diddley, Buddy Holly, Jackie Mason, and Jim Morrison were parties to some of Sullivan's most storied conflicts.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why {{will you}} persist in {{treating}} {{me like a}} child, uncle? I am very impressionable, I grant you; but <b>I</b> have <b>gone</b> <b>around</b> the world alone, and {{do not need to}} be dry-nursed through a tour in Ireland." ...|$|R
60|$|In the afternoon, <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>around</b> to {{the hotel}} where the Chippertons always staid, {{when they were in}} New York, to see Corny and her mother. I found them rather blue. Uncle Chipperton {{had not been able to}} keep his plan from them, and they thought it was dreadful. I could not help letting them see that I did not like it, and so we didn't have as lively a time as we ought to have had.|$|E
6000|$|... "Cheese it," [...] {{said the}} Captain, harshly. [...] "I'm not hogging it yet. It's {{all on the}} outside. <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>around</b> on Essex and {{proposed}} marriage to that Catrina that's got the fruit shop there. Now, that business could be built up.

60|$|The beauties and joys of {{that hour}} were lost to every {{person on the}} place, who were all, no doubt, in their soundest sleep. I did not even see a dog. Quietly and stealthily {{stepping}} from bush to hedge, <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>around</b> the house, and as I drew near the barn I fancied I could hear from a little room adjoining it the snores of the coachman. The lazy rascal would probably not awaken {{for two or three}} hours yet, but I would ran no risks, and in half an hour I had sped away.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, yes--it IS {{a little}} {{different}} from the idea I had--but I thought <b>I</b> might <b>go</b> <b>around</b> and get acquainted with the grandees, anyway--not exactly splice the main-brace with them, you know, but shake hands and pass the time of day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "News!" [...] {{says the}} {{newspaper}} man, taking his pipe out; [...] "do you think I could use this? I don't {{want to lose}} my job. Suppose <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>around</b> {{to the office and}} tell 'em this happened. What'll the managing editor say? He'll just hand me a pass to Bellevue and tell me to come back when I get cured. I might turn in a story about a sea serpent wiggling up Broadway, but I haven't got the nerve to try 'em with a pipe like this. A get-rich-quick scheme--excuse me--gang giving back the boodle! Oh, no. I'm not on the comic supplement." ...|$|R
60|$|I buy, {{during the}} hot weather, boxes of oranges {{from time to}} time, and {{distribute}} them among the men; also preserved peaches and other fruits; also lemons and sugar for lemonade. Tobacco is also much in demand. Large numbers of the men come up, as usual, without a cent of money. Through the assistance of friends in Brooklyn and Boston, I am again able to help many of those that fall in my way. It {{is only a small}} sum in each case, but it is much to them. As before, <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>around</b> daily and talk with the men, to cheer them up.|$|R
6000|$|... "After banging {{and working}} {{for some time}} I got out the bung {{of one of these}} hogsheads, and {{immediately}} air began to bubble up, and I could hear the water running in. It was plain the hogshead was empty, and I clapped the bung in again as quick as I could. I wasn't accustomed to sounding barrels or hogsheads under water, but as I knew this was an empty one I sounded it with my hatchet; and then <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>around</b> and got the same kind of a sound from each of the others that I hammered on. They were all empty, every blessed one of them.|$|E
60|$|Sunday {{afternoon}}, {{opening of}} 1865.--Pass'd this afternoon among {{a collection of}} unusually bad cases, wounded and sick secession soldiers, left upon our hands. I spent the previous Sunday afternoon there also. At that time two were dying. Two others have died during the week. Several of them are partly deranged. <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>around</b> among them elaborately. Poor boys, they all needed to be cheer'd up. As I sat down by any particular one, the eyes of all the rest in the neighboring cots would fix upon me, and remain steadily riveted as long as I sat within their sight. Nobody seem'd to wish anything special to eat or drink. The main thing ask'd for was postage stamps, and paper for writing. I distributed all the stamps I had. Tobacco was wanted by some.|$|E
60|$|Left Falmouth, January, 1863, by Aquia creek railroad, {{and so on}} Government steamer up the Potomac. Many wounded {{were with}} us on cars and boat. The cars were just common {{platform}} ones. The railroad journey of ten or twelve miles was made mostly before sunrise. The soldiers guarding the road came out from their tents or shebangs of bushes with rumpled hair and half-awake look. Those on duty were walking their posts, some on banks over us, others down far {{below the level of}} the track. I saw large cavalry camps off the road. At Aquia Creek Landing were numbers of wounded going North. While I waited some three hours, <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>around</b> among them. Several wanted word sent home to parents, brothers, wives, etc., which I did for them (by mail the next day from Washington). On the boat I had my hands full. One poor fellow died going up.|$|E

60|$|Tuesday, Aug. 1, 1865.--About 3 o'clock this {{afternoon}} (sun broiling hot) in Fifteenth street, by the Treasury building, {{a large and}} handsome regiment, 195th Pennsylvania, were marching by--as it happen'd, receiv'd orders just here to halt and break ranks, {{so that they might}} rest themselves awhile. I thought I never saw a finer set of men--so hardy, candid, bright American looks, all weather-beaten, and with warm clothes. Every man was home-born. My heart was much drawn toward them. They seem'd very tired, red, and streaming with sweat. It is a one-year regiment, mostly from Lancaster county, Pa.; have been in Shenandoah valley. On halting, the men unhitch'd their knapsacks, and sat down to rest themselves. Some lay flat on the pavement or under trees. The fine physical appearance of the whole body was remarkable. Great, very great, must be the State where such young farmers and mechanics are the practical average. <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>around</b> for half an hour and talk'd with several of them, sometimes squatting down with the groups.|$|E
