All the patients had been referred to us after previous failed or inadequate excisions. All the tumours were high-grade malignancies in an extracompartmental location (stade IIB according to Enneking). Histopathologic diagnosis was : synovial-sarcoma in 11 cases; fibrosarcoma in 2 cases; malignant fibrous histiocytoma <b>in</b> 1 <b>case,</b> soft tissue osteosarcoma <b>in</b> 1 <b>case,</b> epitheloid sarcoma <b>in</b> 1 <b>case.</b> <b>The</b> site of the tumour was <b>the</b> hand <b>in</b> 2 <b>cases,</b> <b>the</b> wrist <b>in</b> 6 <b>cases,</b> <b>the</b> forearm <b>in</b> 5 <b>cases</b> and <b>the</b> elbow <b>in</b> 3 <b>cases.</b> <b>The</b> free flaps used for soft tissue reconstructions were the latissimus dorsi <b>in</b> 6 <b>cases,</b> <b>the</b> dorsalis pedis <b>in</b> 2 <b>cases,</b> <b>the</b> lateral arm flap <b>in</b> 2 <b>cases,</b> <b>the</b> serratus <b>in</b> 1 <b>case,</b> <b>the</b> gracilis <b>in</b> 1 <b>case.</b> <b>The</b> island flaps were the radial forearm flap <b>in</b> 1 <b>case,</b> <b>the</b> posterior interosseous flap <b>in</b> 1 <b>case,</b> <b>the</b> cubital flap <b>in</b> 1 <b>case.</b> 14 cases required immediate associated reconstructive procedures such as tendon transfers or grafts (5 cases), vascularized or non vascularized bone grafts (4 cases), articular allografts (1 case), ligament reconstruction (1 case), nerve grafts (2 cases). Brachytherapy was associated to microsurgical reconstruction <b>in</b> <b>the</b> last 6 <b>cases</b> of this group. The catheters were charged with the radioisotope 5 days after surgery. No complications were observed. At the last follow-up 12 patients had no evidence of disease with a good or excellent functional result; 2 cases presented no new sign of disease after having been amputated because of a local recurrence; on subject is alive after lung metastasectomy; one patient is dead with distant metastases...|$|R

5|$|Polish {{headquarters}} {{decided to}} man the outer line of defences, the furthest from the densely populated areas.
