5|$|The Austro-Hungarian assault {{began at}} Lazarevac, a {{strategically}} located town {{just south of}} Belgrade whose capture would have given them access to the Mladenovac railway line {{and the ability to}} outflank the Serbian forces holding the road to Belgrade. Further south, the Austro-Hungarians attacked the Serbian 1st Army. During this assault, they made the mistake of attacking its stronger right flank and were met with determined Serbian resistance which prevented them from gaining any ground. Military historian David Jordan notes that had the Austro-Hungarians attacked the junction splitting the 1st and Užice armies, they {{might have been able to}} split the Serbs down the centre and gotten hold of an unimpeded passage to the Morava River. The Serbian 1st Army was quick to reinforce its left flank, realizing that any subsequent attack against <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>far</b> less easy to repel.|$|E
25|$|Tryon {{became a}} strong {{supporter}} of the idea that in time of war there should be a national insurance scheme for merchant vessels. He was concerned that in the event of war insurance rates for vessels against loss by enemy action would immediately become impossibly high, so that merchant ships would simply stop trading with Britain, even if the numbers being lost were relatively small. This would be disastrous for the country, so <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>far</b> better for the government to implement its own scheme to reimburse owners for lost cargoes and ships.|$|E
2500|$|At the {{sentencing}} hearing, Atwater turned to Carson's parents and said, [...] "I'm sorry for everything that's happened ... No {{matter what the}} court did today, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>far</b> from anything I should receive." [...] Carson's parents declined to speak during the hearing.|$|E
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>would</b> likely <b>be</b> <b>far</b> {{easier to}} scratchbuild a display train, rather than {{converting}} a V kit.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Marian. [...] "Gerald has {{finished}} his lessons by this time. Mamma thought <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> too <b>far</b> {{for him to}} go with us, and besides he frightens the fish." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No indeed,' said Flora. 'We {{all know}} it is a pity; but <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a <b>far</b> greater pity to break it off now--and do Tom an {{infinity}} of harm. Now tell me all.' ...|$|R
2500|$|Due to {{the sheer}} number of claims {{submitted}} each day, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>far</b> too expensive for insurance companies to have employees check each claim for symptoms of fraud. [...] Instead, many companies use computers and statistical analysis to identify suspicious claims for further investigation. [...] There are two main types of statistical analysis tools used: supervised and unsupervised. [...] In both cases, suspicious claims are identified by comparing data about the claim to expected values. [...] The main difference between the two methods is how the expected values are derived.|$|E
2500|$|Though {{the general}} {{principle}} of the freeholder franchise was accepted without debate, {{one aspect of the}} question gave rise to much discussion at the time ... The bill provided that the freeholders in boroughs who did not occupy their property should vote in the counties in which the borough was situated. This clause drew forth a torrent of complaint, especially from the Conservatives. Peel pointed out that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>far</b> simpler for the freeholders in the represented boroughs to vote in the borough where their property was situate instead of being forced to travel to the county polling place; moreover if the borough freeholders were allowed to vote in the counties he felt that the boroughs would have an unfair influence in county elections and the rural element would be submerged by the urban.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{production}} {{mistakes were}} kept for the album. The breakdown in [...] "Bring the Noise" [...] {{in which the}} kick-drum sample from James Brown's [...] "Funky Drummer" [...] plays solo was a mistake. Apparently, the wrong sequence {{came up in the}} SP1200 sampler and Shocklee decided not only to keep it but to have Chuck rewrite his rhyme to fit the pattern. The album itself was mixed with no automation, instead of being recorded on analog tape and later painstakingly mixed by hand. This is a significant fact due to its nature as being one of the most intricate albums of digitally sampled music. Asked years later if replicating the number of samples used on the album would be possible , Hank Shocklee said while possible, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>far</b> more expensive than at the time to do so.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't you think, Mr. Crews, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> going <b>far</b> {{enough if}} I {{put him on}} the bench with the substitutes?" [...] he pleaded. [...] "To be thrown out of the team entirely is a terrible blow for any one." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sir," [...] {{she returns}} {{without looking up}} from the ground on which her eyes are now fixed, [...] "I had better have gone. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>far</b> better not to have {{detained}} me. I have no more to say." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'This was {{not what}} my Lady expected,' he muttered; but though Berenger silenced him by a stern look, he took the first {{opportunity}} of asking Philip if <b>it</b> <b>would</b> not <b>be</b> <b>far</b> wiser for his brother to place himself in safety in England.|$|R
2500|$|The Brooklyn–Queens Connector has {{received}} criticism {{in regards to}} its operation and cost. Several complaints are that while it is planned to connect to 17 subway stations, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>far</b> from BMT Canarsie Line (...) at Bedford Avenue. The line would also not go near the BMT Jamaica Line (...) at Marcy Avenue. Much of the areas that the new streetcar would serve are all [...] from the IND Crosstown Line (...) , while areas in Eastern Queens and parts of Brooklyn do not have nearby subway lines. Since the project would be constructed and run by New York City and not the MTA, {{it is not known}} how it would integrate to the MTA's fare system, if at all. Public officials on Staten Island, including Staten Island Borough President James Oddo, did not oppose the plan, but they have stated that they felt under-represented after previous plans in Staten Island, including light rail along the island's North and West Shores, were rejected.|$|E
2500|$|In the Breeders' Cup Turf Golden Horn, {{the only}} one of the twelve horse field not running on Lasix, started odds-on {{favourite}} ahead of the other European challenger Found. The best of the ten American horses appeared to be The Pizza Man (Arlington Million) and Big Blue Kitten (Joe Hirsch Turf Classic Invitational Stakes, Sword Dancer Invitational Handicap). The colt broke slowly but was settled behind the leaders as the outsider Shining Copper set the early pace. He moved into second place half a mile out and overtook the leader to gain the advantage approaching the final furlong. He was headed by Found in the closing stages, and although he rallied in the final strides he was beaten half a length by the filly. Gosden accepted the colt's defeat but felt he had been unable to produce his best on the soft ground, commenting [...] "It was too loose for Golden horn, but full marks to the filly for beating us fair and square... I said to everyone beforehand that after all the rain and three inches of it, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>far</b> from ideal... Frankie said he was spinning his wheels all the time" [...] but added that [...] "he appears to be bright after his race".|$|E
6000|$|... 'I think I'll go {{and meet}} her,' said Alice, for, though the flowers were {{interesting}} enough, {{she felt that}} <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>far</b> grander to {{have a talk with}} a real Queen.|$|E
6000|$|... "I hope so," [...] {{answered}} her father; [...] "but {{they are a}} timid folk. Still, though <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>far</b> better never to have come, I think with {{you that it is}} best to stay where we are, and trust to God." ...|$|R
25|$|Several {{potential}} Irish Sea tunnel {{projects have}} been proposed, including one between Dublin and Holyhead put forward in 1997 by the British engineering firm Symonds. At , <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> by <b>far</b> the longest rail tunnel in the world, and would cost an estimated €20 billion.|$|R
6000|$|The captain [...] "allowed" [...] this <b>would</b> <b>be</b> safer, although, to <b>be</b> sure, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> also <b>be</b> <b>far</b> more laborious, for {{everything}} not {{left in the}} boat <b>would</b> have to <b>be</b> carried over the roughest kind of a trail, running some distance away from the stream.|$|R
6000|$|... "But this is {{not very}} wise," [...] cried the Frenchman. [...] "See, my friends! Here are the ladies being carried off alone. Surely <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>far</b> better that one of us should be with them to advise them." ...|$|E
60|$|Mildred {{smiled and}} laid down her book. Inez in this mood was worth cultivating, if {{she hoped to}} win her confidence. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>far</b> easier to get on in her new {{situation}} if Inez would learn to like her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sometimes," [...] said he, [...] "old Campos {{keeps the}} dried nuts {{in his little}} store on the hill. But <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>far</b> better, my daughter, to {{restrain}} unusual desires, and partake thankfully of the daily dishes that the Lord has set before us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Clara {{would find}} a {{companion}} in the younger Mary in the holidays, and if James would make Fitzjocelyn his charge, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> complete the obligation. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> by <b>far</b> the best arrangement for Mary's comfort, and <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> the greatest satisfaction to me to see her with you at Ormersfield.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I rather think not, Sir Gervaise; <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> too <b>far</b> to {{windward}} {{for any of}} his two-deckers. It {{may turn out to}} be a look-out ship of the French, got round on the other tack to keep her station, and carrying sail hard, because she dislikes our appearance." ...|$|R
6000|$|Miss Macroyd {{came out}} with her laugh. [...] "I should {{like to know what}} she makes of you, Mr. Verrian, when she is alone with herself. She must have looked you up and {{authenticated}} you in her own way, but <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> as <b>far</b> from your way as--well, say--the Milky Way." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “As for that, adobe costs nothing,” said Arthur, “and <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>far</b> {{cheaper to}} make a solid wall than a hollow one. But between the blocks {{are a lot of}} spaces favored as residences by our enemies the rats, and there they are safe from our reach.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Zat Arrras {{commands}} me {{to bring}} our 'prisoners' before him. There is naught else to do. He is supreme in Helium, yet <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>far</b> more in keeping with chivalry and good taste were he to come hither and greet the saviour of Barsoom with the honours that are his due." ...|$|E
60|$|One moment. Don't make up {{your mind}} hastily. You don't know with whom you have to deal. Those letters will not appear in your speech to-morrow. Take that from me. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>far</b> wiser to sell for a fortune than to get nothing for them {{and at the same time}} not use them.|$|E
50|$|Murphy doubts {{the details}} of the story. He points out that De Doot had {{previously}} had two stones removed from his bladder. Therefore, the stone may have extruded through the former incisions into the subcutaneous tissue, from which <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>far</b> easier for De Doot to remove it.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{just what}} I don't know. However, if he's there now I'll go to him. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> better <b>far</b> {{that he should}} have come to me." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{influence}} of Miltiades in Athens after the Persian troops were withdrawn was paramount and supreme. Finding himself {{in possession of}} this ascendency, he began to form plans for other military undertakings. It proved, in the end, that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>far</b> better {{for him to have}} been satisfied with the fame which he had already acquired.|$|R
6000|$|... 65. I believe {{an immense}} {{gain in the}} bodily health and {{happiness}} of the upper classes would follow on their steadily endeavouring, however clumsily, to make the physical exertion they now necessarily exert in amusements, definitely serviceable. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>far</b> better, for instance, that a gentleman should mow his own fields, than ride over other people's.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. Let me take Idella--keep her--adopt her! I've {{nothing to}} do, {{as you know}} very well, and she'd be an occupation; and <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>far</b> better for her. What Ralph says is true. She's growing up without any sort of training; and I think if she keeps on she will be mischievous to herself and every one else." ...|$|E
60|$|A {{few days}} later, however, the {{negotiations}} were renewed. The count {{pointed out that}} they could not hope, finally, to resist the whole force of France; and that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>far</b> better for them to make terms, now, than when in an extremity. But he was able to give no guarantees that were considered acceptable by the citizens.|$|E
6000|$|... "A little less," [...] {{said the}} Princess, contemptuously, [...] "and you <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> cut to pieces; for {{you have not}} sense enough {{to take care of}} yourself. I am sorry I listened to you, and left the inn to which the Gryphoness took me. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>far</b> better to wait there for her as she told me to do." ...|$|R
25|$|Most of {{the reports}} in the media tended to be {{critical}} of Patriarch Kirill and laughing at the claims that the dust was harmful, saying that it was just sand and <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>far</b> more efficient to just hire a maid to vacuum it up. The Patriarch himself then said he thought it to be inappropriate to forgive Shevchenko.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, I know, I know! There's nobody like you, but I don't {{know what}} I {{say in this}} awful suspense. If I had only seen him lying white and cold and peaceful, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>far</b> better than {{to think of him}} pining and miserable among wicked people, who would try to bring him up like themselves. Mother's own little boy!' ...|$|R
