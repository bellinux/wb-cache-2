40|$|This work is {{concerned}} with the investigation of the concentration fields in an electrokinetic micromixer and its optimization in order to achieve high mixing rates. The mixing concept is based on the combination of an alternating <b>electrical</b> <b>excitation</b> applied to a pressure-driven base flow in a meandering microchannel geometry. The <b>electrical</b> <b>excitation</b> induces a secondary electrokinetic velocity component, which results in a complex flow field within the meander bends. A mathematical model describing the physicochemical phenomena present within the micromixer is implemented in an in-house finite-element-method code. We first perform simulations comparable to experiments concerned with the investigation of the flow field in the bends. The comparison of the complex flow topology found in simulation and experiment reveals excellent agreement. Hence, the validated model and numerical schemes are employed for a numerical optimization of the micromixer performance. In detail, we optimize the secondary electrokinetic flow by finding the best <b>electrical</b> <b>excitation</b> parameters, i. e., frequency and amplitude, for a given waveform. Two optimized <b>electrical</b> <b>excitations</b> featuring a discrete and a continuous waveform are discussed with respect to characteristic time scales of our mixing problem.

In {{clinical}} practice, observations of intraventricular blood pressures are too sparse and noisy. In spite of many efforts which are aimed to recover intracardiac <b>electrical</b> <b>excitations</b> from body surface potentials [39], the coupling of <b>electrical</b> <b>excitations</b> and active forces remain unknown in clinical practice because of difficulties. So {{it is a good}} strategy to assume the whole input forces to the cardiac system are a Gaussian random variable, which represents the unobservable nature. The uncertainties of input forces could be removed or reduced if new observations of input forces can be reliably collected in clinical practice in the future. In the ideal case, where the input forces are fully known, the least-square filter will vanish, and the Kalman filter will be able to recover the motion from images directly.|$|R

40|$|Methods for probing {{mechanical}} {{responses of}} mammalian cells to <b>electrical</b> <b>excitations</b> can improve {{our understanding of}} cellular physiology and function. The electrical response of neuronal cells to applied voltages has been studied in detail, but less is known about their mechanical response to <b>electrical</b> <b>excitations.</b> Studies using atomic force microscopes (AFMs) have shown that mammalian cells exhibit voltage-induced mechanical deflections at nanometre scales, but AFM measurements can be invasive and difficult to multiplex. Here we show that mechanical deformations of neuronal cells in response to <b>electrical</b> <b>excitations</b> can be measured using piezoelectric PbZr_xTi_(1 -x) O_ 3 (PZT) nanoribbons, and we find that cells deflect by 1 nm when 120 mV {{is applied to the}} cell membrane. The measured cellular forces agree with a theoretical model in which depolarization caused by an applied voltage induces a change in membrane tension, which results in the cell altering its radius so that the pressure remains constant across the membrane. We also transfer arrays of PZT nanoribbons onto a silicone elastomer and measure mechanical deformations on a cow lung that mimics respiration. The PZT nanoribbons offer a minimally invasive and scalable platform for electromechanical biosensing. ...|$|R
