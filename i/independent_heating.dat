With the proposed optimal load ratio of horizontal to vertical GHEs, three-dimensional numerical heat transfer GHE models were established using <b>independent</b> <b>heat</b> transfer calculation method, and a design method for hybrid GHEs of GCHP system was put forward and then applied in one project. A combined heat transfer calculation method considering the mixing outlet water temperature was proposed and validated by a built experimental platform, which shows an improvement in accuracy prediction compared to the <b>independent</b> <b>heat</b> transfer calculation.

50|$|A {{truck with}} {{conventional}} setting of cabin was demanded especially by Tatra's customers from Russian Siberia (where Tatra's air-cooled engines require less maintenance compared to water-cooled ones).

50|$|In April 2013, a {{cold wave}} swept across Tianjin and {{temperature}} dropped immediately. The municipal government’s {{central heating system}} had already stopped its supply on March 15. Without the heating supply, the theatre’s temperature could not reach 23℃ (the minimum requirement for normal performances), which directly caused the suspension of Royal New Zealand Ballet’s performance. After this incident, the theatre submitted its proposal to the municipal government for the installation of its <b>independent</b> <b>heating</b> system.

50|$|The inventor, William Joseph Still, {{patented}} his {{device in}} 1917 and on 26 May 1919 in London he announced it at a meeting, chaired by steam turbine inventor Charles Algernon Parsons, at the Royal Society of Arts.

He explained how the reserve of energy represented by the steam pressure in the boiler provided for any occasional overload which would defeat a standard internal combustion engine of the same power. <b>Independent</b> <b>heating</b> of the boiler was occasionally used, to provide extra power for exceptional conditions, and in the first stage of operation to allow the engine to start itself from steam power alone, even against a load.|$|E
