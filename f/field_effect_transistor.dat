25|$|The {{regenerative}} circuit allows {{an electronic}} signal to be amplified many {{times by the}} same vacuum tube or other active component such as a <b>field</b> <b>effect</b> <b>transistor.</b> A regenerative circuit is often an AM detector, converting the RF signal on the antenna to an audio waveform. Their use of positive feedback greatly increases both the selectivity and sensitivity of a simple receiver. Positive feedback builds up the input signal to very high levels. Edwin Armstrong, invented and patented the regenerative circuit {{while he was a}} junior in college, in 1914.|$|E
25|$|Vacuum Tube Voltmeters or valve {{voltmeters}} (VTVM, VVM) {{were used}} for voltage measurements in electronic circuits where high input impedance was necessary. The VTVM had a fixed input impedance of typically 1megohm or more, usually through use of a cathode follower input circuit, and thus did not significantly load the circuit being tested. VTVMs were used before the introduction of electronic high-impedance analog transistor and <b>field</b> <b>effect</b> <b>transistor</b> voltmeters (FETVOMs). Modern digital meters (DVMs) and some modern analog meters also use electronic input circuitry to achieve high input impedance—their voltage ranges are functionally equivalent to VTVMs. The input impedance of some poorly-designed DVMs (especially some early designs) would vary {{over the course of}} a sample-and-hold internal measurement cycle, causing disturbances to some sensitive circuits under test.|$|E

40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a basic cell for a channel-less gate array layout (''Sea of Gate'' (SOG) array) in a combined CMOS and bipolar technology, whereby each basic cell comprises {{at least one}} bipolar transistor and several metal-oxide semiconductor <b>field</b> <b>effect</b> <b>transistors</b> (MOSFET) whose gate electrodes each have two terminal areas located {{on the opposite side}} from the associated source drain area. According to the invention, a bipolar <b>transistor,</b> MOS <b>field</b> <b>effect</b> <b>transistors</b> of the first {{as well as of the}} second channel type are arranged in a central area of the basic cell, whereby on opposite sides of the central area, there are three parallel rows composed of several MOS <b>field</b> <b>effect</b> <b>transistors.</b> The first row is composed of oxide-insulated MOS <b>field</b> <b>effect</b> <b>transistors</b> of the first channel type, the second row is composed of gate-insulated MOS <b>field</b> <b>effect</b> <b>transistors</b> of the first channel type and the third row is also composed of gate-insulated MOS <b>field</b> <b>effect</b> <b>transistors</b> of th e second channel type. Furthermore, both terminal areas of the gate electrodes of the MOS <b>field</b> <b>effect</b> <b>transistors</b> of the first, second and third rows are placed in an offset arrangement to each other in a perpendicular orientation to the direction of the rows, whereby the gate electrodes are arranged with their terminal areas parallel to a row of associated MOS <b>field</b> <b>effect</b> <b>transistors.</b> [...] ...|$|R

2500|$|Throughout 1956 {{most members}} of the lab were {{assembling}} and tuning the equipment, and [...] "pure scientists" [...] Hoerni and Noyce carried out individual applied research. Shockley refused to hire technical staff, believing that his scientists should be able to handle all technological processes. After resettlement, he focused on fine-tuning Shockley diodes for mass production, and five employees, led by Noyce, continued the work on a <b>field</b> <b>effect</b> <b>transistor</b> for Beckman Instruments. Shockley refused to work on bipolar transistors, which later was proven a strategic mistake. Because the work on Shockley diodes took so much effort the produced devices were commercial failures.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] basic {{principle}} {{of this kind}} of transistor was first patented by Julius Edgar Lilienfeld in 1925. Twenty five years later, when Bell Telephone attempted to patent the junction transistor, they found Lilienfeld already holding a patent, worded {{in a way that would}} include all types of transistors. Bell Labs was able to work out an agreement with Lilienfeld, who was still alive at that time (it is not known if they paid him money or not). It was at that time the Bell Labs version was given the name bipolar junction transistor, or simply junction transistor, and Lilienfeld's design took the name <b>field</b> <b>effect</b> <b>transistor.</b>|$|E
40|$|In this paper, two {{dimensional}} modulation {{of the potential}} in sexithiophene (T 6) / N,N-bis(n-octyl) -dicyanoperylenediimide (PDI- 8 CN 2) heterojunction <b>field</b> <b>effect</b> <b>transistors</b> due to the specific microstructure at the interface is used to explain the negative transconductance effect (NTC) experienced in sexithiophene (T 6) / N,N-bis(n-octyl) -dicyanoperylenediimide (PDI- 8 CN 2) heterojunction <b>field</b> <b>effect</b> <b>transistors.</b> The NTC <b>effect</b> has been experienced in tunnel devices, such as the tunnel diode, the resonant tunneling <b>field</b> <b>effect</b> <b>transistors</b> (RT-FETs), resonant tunneling double barrier devices.

Since in T 6 / PDI- 8 CN 2 heterojunction <b>field</b> <b>effect</b> <b>transistors</b> the NTC <b>effect</b> is irrespective of the order of the semiconductor layer and since the modulation of the transport properties is deeply influenced by the island dimension of the semiconductor layer, we argue that the origin of the NTC effect resides in the achievement of a specific microstructure of the heterostructure in the charge transport plane...|$|R
