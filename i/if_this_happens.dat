5|$|It is even {{possible}} {{that in any}} one generation no marbles of a particular colour are chosen, meaning they have no offspring. In this example, if no red marbles are selected, the jar representing the new generation contains only blue offspring. <b>If</b> <b>this</b> <b>happens,</b> the red allele has been lost permanently in the population, while the remaining blue allele has become fixed: all future generations are entirely blue. In small populations, fixation can occur {{in just a few}} generations.|$|E
5|$|Some pugs {{are also}} born with {{stenotic}} nares {{which can also}} inhibit their breathing. In serious cases, the pinched nostrils make breathing even more difficult for this breed and put added pressure on the larynx. In some cases, the dog could pass out from blocked airways. <b>If</b> <b>this</b> <b>happens,</b> one should inquire with their veterinarian whether or not surgery is needed to modify the breathing passages.|$|E
5|$|Three years later, Isaac, Garet, and Jenna {{join their}} teacher, Kraden, in his {{research}} of Mt. Aleph. Their research coincides with a second raid of the sanctum by Saturos and Menardi, now assisted by Felix and Alex, who coerce Isaac into giving them {{three of the four}} stars. The volcano erupts before they can retrieve the final star, but before escaping they capture Jenna and Kraden as eventual bargaining chips. The guardian of Mt. Aleph, the Wise One, appears before Isaac and Garet and instructs them to prevent Saturos' group from casting the Elemental Stars into their respective Elemental Lighthouses across Weyard; <b>if</b> <b>this</b> <b>happens,</b> Alchemy will be restored and the period of instability will begin anew.|$|E
50|$|Since the {{champion}} always spun first, {{it was possible}} for him/her to win without giving the challenger an opportunity to play. <b>If</b> <b>this</b> <b>happened,</b> the challenger returned to play again in the next game.|$|R
50|$|Royalex was {{extremely}} tough but if hit hard enough could be dented. <b>If</b> <b>this</b> <b>happened</b> such dents could be recovered by applying a hand held {{hot air gun}} which re-expanded the core to blow out the dent.|$|R
50|$|It {{is presumed}} {{that because of}} its {{relationship}} to fish pathogens, Rhinosporidium evolved from aquatic pathogens similar to the other Mesomycetozoea and evolved to infect mammal and bird hosts. It is not known <b>if</b> <b>this</b> <b>happened</b> once or more than once.|$|R
5|$|Mass {{transfer}} {{came to an}} {{end when}} the surface layers of the mass-losing star were depleted, and the core slowly shrunk to a white dwarf. Now the stars peacefully orbit around each other. The long-term prospects for PSR B1620-26 b are poor, though. The triple system, which is much more massive than a typical isolated star in M4, is slowly drifting down into the core of the cluster, where the density of stars is very high. In a billion years or so, the triple will probably have another close encounter with a nearby star. The most common outcome of such encounters is that the lightest companion is ejected from the multiple star system. <b>If</b> <b>this</b> <b>happens,</b> PSR B1620-26 b will most likely be ejected completely from M4, and will spend the rest of its existence wandering alone in interstellar space as an interstellar planet.|$|E
25|$|The premixing/prevaporizing {{injectors}} work {{by mixing}} or vaporizing the fuel {{before it reaches}} the combustion zone. This method allows the fuel to be very uniformly mixed with the air, reducing emissions from the engine. One disadvantage of this method is that fuel may auto-ignite or otherwise combust before the fuel-air mixture reaches the combustion zone. <b>If</b> <b>this</b> <b>happens</b> the combustor can be seriously damaged.|$|E
25|$|One {{criticism}} already {{prevalent in}} the late 19th century, and still sometimes heard today, is that an international language might hasten the extinction of minority languages. One response has been that, even <b>if</b> <b>this</b> <b>happens,</b> the benefits would outweigh the costs; another, that proponents of auxlangs, particularly in the Esperanto movement, are generally also proponents of measures to conserve and promote minority languages and cultures.|$|E

5000|$|On 7 March 2008 it was {{reported}} [...] that Pegah Emambakhsh was {{at risk of being}} deported to Iran after losing the latest round in her battle to be granted asylum. <b>If</b> <b>this</b> <b>happened,</b> then she faced a possible death penalty, on the grounds of her sexual orientation.|$|R
25|$|It is also unfair for {{a member}} of the fielding side to {{deliberately}} attempt to distract or obstruct either batsman after the striker has received the ball by word or action. <b>If</b> <b>this</b> <b>happens</b> a procedure similar to the procedure for the first instance of ball tampering occurs, although the batting side also scores any runs that they have scored before the attempted (or actual) distraction or obstruction.|$|E
25|$|The President of Mongolia {{is elected}} using the two-round system. Mongolia's electoral law {{consider}} the blank votes casts in presidential elections as valid votes. The General Election Commission thus includes blank votes in its calculations of {{the proportion of}} the vote won by each candidate; as a result, it is possible for no candidate to receive a majority of the vote in the second round. <b>If</b> <b>this</b> <b>happens,</b> the entire election is annulled and fresh elections would be held with new candidates.|$|E
25|$|This is {{a special}} form of cast and mold formation. If the {{chemistry}} is right, the organism (or fragment of organism) {{can act as a}} nucleus for the precipitation of minerals such as siderite, resulting in a nodule forming around it. <b>If</b> <b>this</b> <b>happens</b> rapidly before significant decay to the organic tissue, very fine three-dimensional morphological detail can be preserved. Nodules from the Carboniferous Mazon Creek fossil beds of Illinois, USA, are among the best documented examples of such mineralization.|$|E
50|$|As long as {{the winning}} {{contestant}} matched at least one answer on a row, he/she continued playing. The round ended if the contestant could not give a matching answer, with $100 given for each match made to that point. <b>If</b> <b>this</b> <b>happened,</b> the other three contestants would return to play the next game.|$|R
60|$|Ida hesitated. If Clare {{were not}} the girl she thought, she might, by {{appealing}} to her compassion, supply her with a reason for giving Dick up, but <b>if</b> <b>this</b> <b>happened,</b> {{it would be to}} his advantage in the end. Still she did not think she was mistaken and she must take the risk.|$|R
60|$|For {{the first}} time, {{he thought it}} likely that the heat in the house might induce some of the inmates to try the cooler {{atmosphere}} in the grounds. <b>If</b> <b>this</b> <b>happened,</b> and <b>if</b> he continued to smoke, curiosity might tempt them to follow the scent of tobacco hanging on the stagnant air.|$|R
25|$|If any {{of these}} rules is violated, an umpire will call the {{delivery}} a no ball. Additionally a player may not make any significant movement after the ball comes into play and before the ball reaches the striker. <b>If</b> <b>this</b> <b>happens,</b> an umpire will call and signal 'dead ball'. For close fielders anything other than minor adjustments to stance or position {{in relation to the}} striker is significant. In the outfield, fielders may move in towards the striker or striker's wicket; indeed, they usually do. However, anything other than slight movement off line or away from the striker is to be considered significant.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} for the dry suit or BCD inflation valve to freeze while inflating, for similar reasons to regulator freeze. <b>If</b> <b>this</b> <b>happens</b> it can cause a runaway ascent {{if it is not}} dealt with immediately. If possible the low pressure inflator hose should be disconnected before it freezes onto the valve, while dumping air to control buoyancy. Excessive dumping of air may leave the diver too negative so it is preferable to have at least two controllable buoyancy systems, such as a dry suit and BCD, preferably supplied from different first stages. If the dry suit inflation valve freezes open it may allow water to leak into the suit once disconnected, so this usually results in aborting the dive.|$|E
25|$|The bowling of fast short pitched {{balls and}} of high full pitched balls is {{dangerous}} {{and is also}} considered unfair. Where the umpire considers that there are regular fast short pitched balls, that by their length, height and direction, coupled with the relative skill of the batsman is dangerous, the umpire calls no ball and cautions the bowler. <b>If</b> <b>this</b> <b>happens</b> a second time in an innings, the bowler is barred from bowling again in that innings, also is reported to the authorities he is responsible to for further disciplinary action. Where a delivery, after pitching, passes {{over the head of}} the striker, the umpire calls no ball and includes it in his consideration of whether fast short pitched bowling is unfair, even though such a delivery is not dangerous.|$|E
50|$|If William was not {{survived by}} a {{legitimate}} child when he died, and Victoria became queen, but then afterwards Adelaide {{gave birth to}} William's child, the Act stipulated that William's child was to immediately and automatically become monarch, replacing Victoria. <b>If</b> <b>this</b> <b>happened</b> then Adelaide would become regent until the new monarch was 18.|$|R
50|$|In 1911, Dimitrijević {{organised}} {{an attempt}} to assassinate the octogenarian Austrian Emperor Franz Josef. When this failed, Dimitrijević {{turned his attention to}} the heir to the throne, Archduke Franz Ferdinand. Dimitrijević was concerned about Ferdinand's plans to grant concessions to the South Slavs, fearing that, <b>if</b> <b>this</b> <b>happened,</b> a unified Serbian state would be more difficult to achieve.|$|R
5000|$|Bonus CategoryA three-part {{question}} was asked, which, if answered correctly, gave the contestant another turn. The categories were shuffled before the extra turn; as a result, {{it was possible}} for the champion to win the game on his/her first turn by repeatedly selecting <b>this</b> category. <b>If</b> <b>this</b> <b>happened,</b> the challenger was invited back to compete on a future episode.|$|R
25|$|The Armed Forces {{are today}} funded by {{approximately}} $20.1 billion annually and are presently ranked 74th in size {{compared to the}} world's other armed forces by number of total personnel, and 58th in terms of active personnel, standing at a strength of roughly 68,000, plus 27,000 reservists, 5000 Rangers, and 19,000 supplementary reserves, bringing the total force to approximately 119,000. The number of primary reserve personnel {{is expected to go}} up to 30,000 by 2020, and the number of active to at least 70,000. In addition, 5000 rangers and 19,000 supplementary personnel will be serving. <b>If</b> <b>this</b> <b>happens</b> the total strength would be around 124,000. These individuals serve on numerous CF bases located in all regions of the country, and are governed by the Queen's Regulations and Orders and the National Defence Act.|$|E
25|$|In many states, {{fundamental}} mistakes, misrepresentations {{and similar}} defects {{may make a}} contract void ab initio, i.e. the defect is so serious that it prevents an agreement from ever coming into being. <b>If</b> <b>this</b> <b>happens,</b> every term in the contract including the express selection of the proper law, would be unenforceable. This {{raises the question of}} whether the lex fori should operate a policy of saving the validity of contracts wherever possible. Suppose that a contract would be valid under many potentially relevant laws but not under the putative proper law, and that, until problems arose, the parties have acted in good faith on the assumption that they will be bound by the agreement, some courts might be tempted to ignore the apparent proper law and choose another that would give effect to the parties general contractual intentions.|$|E
25|$|The {{final round}} of the game is the Countdown Conundrum, in which the contestants are shown a {{combination}} of two or three words with a total of nine letters. They have 30 seconds to form a single word using all the letters, and must buzz-in to respond (a bell for the champion, a buzzer for the challenger). Each contestant is allowed only one guess, and the first to answer correctly scores 10 points. If neither contestant can solve it, the presenter asks whether anyone in the audience knows the answer and, if so, chooses someone to call it out. (This practice was stopped temporarily in 2009 due to difficulties with camera angles after the studio layout was changed.) The Conundrum is designed to have only one solution, but on occasion more than one valid word is found by happenstance (e.g. REACH SORT can become both CARTHORSE and ORCHESTRA). <b>If</b> <b>this</b> <b>happens,</b> any of these results is accepted.|$|E
5|$|B. Lance Armstrong was {{declared}} winner of seven consecutive Tours from 1999 to 2005. However, in October 2012 he {{was stripped of}} all titles by the UCI due {{to the use of}} performance-enhancing drugs. The Tour director Christian Prudhomme had previously declared that <b>if</b> <b>this</b> <b>happened,</b> there would be no alternate winners for those years, but this has not yet been made official.|$|R
50|$|The desertions of Bulgaria and Romania {{had opened}} a 650-kilometer gap in Friessner's Army Group South. As Friessner desperately {{struggled}} to reform a defensive line, news filtered through to Berlin that the Hungarian leader, Admiral Miklós Horthy {{was preparing to}} sign a separate peace with the Soviet Union. <b>If</b> <b>this</b> <b>happened,</b> the entire front of Army Group South Ukraine would collapse.|$|R

Polk was elected President of the United States in 1844, and considered his election a mandate for his expansionist policies.|$|R
25|$|Once all {{the cars}} have formed on the grid, a light system above the track {{indicates}} {{the start of the}} race: five red lights are illuminated at intervals of one second; they are all then extinguished simultaneously after an unspecified time (typically less than 3 seconds) to signal the start of the race. The start procedure may be abandoned if a driver stalls on the grid, signalled by raising his arm. <b>If</b> <b>this</b> <b>happens,</b> the procedure restarts: a new formation lap begins with the offending car removed from the grid. The race may also be restarted {{in the event of a}} serious accident or dangerous conditions, with the original start voided. The race may be started from behind the Safety Car if officials feel a racing start would be excessively dangerous, such as extremely heavy rainfall. As of the 2017 season there will always be a standing restart. If due to heavy rainfall a start behind the safety car is necessary, then after the track has dried sufficiently, drivers will form up for a standing start. There is no formation lap when races start behind the Safety Car.|$|E
25|$|The Binou sect uses totems: common {{ones for}} the entire village and {{individual}} ones for totem priests. A totem animal is worshiped on a Binou altar. Totems are, for example, the buffalo for Ogol-du-Haut and the panther for Ogol-du-Bas. Normally, no one is harmed by their totem animal, even {{if this is a}} crocodile, as it is for the village of Amani (where there is a large pool of crocodiles that do not harm villagers). However, a totem animal might exceptionally harm if one has done something wrong. A worshiper is not allowed to eat his totem. For example, an individual with a buffalo as totem is not allowed to eat buffalo meat, allowed to use leather from its skin, nor even to see a buffalo die. <b>If</b> <b>this</b> <b>happens</b> by accident, he has to organise a purification sacrifice at the Binou altar. Boiled millet is offered, and goats and chickens are sacrificed on a Binou altar. This colours the altar white and red. Binou altars look like little houses with a door. They are bigger when the altar is for an entire village. A village altar has also the 'cloud hook', that will catch clouds and make it rain.|$|E
25|$|Originally a {{sub-category}} {{of direct}} discrimination, harassment {{is now an}} independent tort which requires no comparator. The Protection from Harassment Act 1997, and now the Equality Act 2010 sections 26 and 40, define harassment as where a person's dignity is violated, or the person is subject to an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment. An employer will be liable for its own conduct, but also conduct of employees, or customers <b>if</b> <b>this</b> <b>happens</b> on 2 or more occasions and the employer could be reasonably expected to have intervened. In a straightforward case, in Majrowski v Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Trust a gay man was ostracised and bossed about by his supervisor {{from the very start}} of his work as a clinical audit co-ordinator. The House of Lords held the laws create a statutory tort, for which (unless a statute says otherwise) an employer is automatically vicariously liable. Under the Equality Act 2010 section 27, an employer must also ensure that once a complaint is brought by a worker, even if it ultimately proves to be unfounded, that worker should not be victimised. This means the worker should not be subject to anything that a reasonable person would perceive as detrimental. In St Helen’s MBC v Derbyshire the House of Lords held a council victimised female staff who were pursuing an equal pay claim when it sent letters warning (without much factual basis) that if the claim went ahead, the council would be forced to cut school dinners and make redundancies. Because it attempted to make the workers feel guilty, a reasonable person would have regarded this as a detriment. By contrast, in Chief Constable of West Yorkshire Police v Khan, a sergeant with a pending race discrimination claim was denied a reference by the employer that he was suing. The House of Lords held this could not be considered victimisation because the Constabulary was only seeking to protect its legitimate interests by not giving a reference, so as to not prejudice its own future case in the discrimination hearings.|$|E
25|$|Following surgery, if {{a partial}} {{colectomy}} has been performed, colonoscopic surveillance {{of the remaining}} colon is necessary as the individual still has a risk of developing colon cancer.
