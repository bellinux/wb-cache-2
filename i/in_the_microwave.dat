5|$|In 1959, {{observations}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>microwave</b> part of {{the electromagnetic}} (EM) spectrum (0.1–10GHz) led {{to the discovery of}} the Jovian decimetric radiation (DIM) and the realization that it was synchrotron radiation emitted by relativistic electrons trapped in the planet's radiation belts. These synchrotron emissions were used to estimate the number and energy of the electrons around Jupiter and led to improved estimates of the magnetic moment and its tilt.|$|E
5|$|In 1964 Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson serendipitously {{discovered}} the cosmic background radiation, an omnidirectional signal <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>microwave</b> band. Their discovery provided substantial {{confirmation of the}} big-bang predictions by Alpher, Herman and Gamow around 1950. Through the 1970s the radiation {{was found to be}} approximately consistent with a black body spectrum in all directions; this spectrum has been redshifted by the expansion of the universe, and today corresponds to approximately 2.725K. This tipped the balance of evidence in favor of the Big Bang model, and Penzias and Wilson were awarded a Nobel Prize in 1978.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of distributed element filters was {{spurred on by}} the military need for radar and electronic counter measures during World WarII. Lumped element analogue filters had long before been developed but these new military systems operated at microwave frequencies and new filter designs were required. When the war ended, the technology found applications <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>microwave</b> links used by telephone companies and other organisations with large fixed-communication networks, such as television broadcasters. Nowadays the technology {{can be found in}} several mass-produced consumer items, such as the converters (figure 1 shows an example) used with satellite television dishes.|$|E

5|$|The initial non-military {{application}} of distributed element filters was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>microwave</b> links used by telecommunications companies {{to provide the}} backbone of their networks. These links were also used by other industries with large, fixed networks, notably television broadcasters. Such applications were part of large capital investment programs.

Experimental complete filters with an operating frequency of 30GHz have been produced using cantilever varactors as the resonator elements. The size of this filter is around 4×3.5mm. Cantilever resonators are typically applied at frequencies below 200MHz, but other structures, such as micro-machined cavities, can be used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>microwave</b> bands.

The effect is less for higher frequencies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>microwave</b> region, as well as lasting a shorter time – the effect falls off both in strength and the effected frequencies as the fireball cools and the electrons begin to re-form onto free nuclei.|$|E
25|$|The {{combination}} of atoms into molecules {{leads to the}} creation of unique types of energetic states and therefore unique spectra of the transitions between these states.
