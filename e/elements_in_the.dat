5|$|Many <b>elements</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> panel {{incorporate}} earlier iconographical conventions depicting hell. However, Bosch is innovative in that {{he describes}} hell not as a fantastical space, but as a realistic world containing many elements from day-to-day human life.|$|E
30|$|<b>The</b> Apache <b>element</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{customized}} {{model is}} mapped to <b>the</b> Agent <b>element</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Hyperic model. It is a one-to-one mapping relationship. <b>The</b> Apache <b>element</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> customized model contains the ApacheSwConfig element, which describes the configurations of Apache instance, {{as the same}} as <b>the</b> Apache <b>element</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Hyperic model. So <b>the</b> ApacheSwConfig <b>element</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> customized model is mapped to <b>the</b> Apache <b>element</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Hyperic model. The attributes of ApacheSwConfig element are also mapped to the ones of Apache element.|$|R

5|$|Station model plots use {{an internationally}} {{accepted}} coding convention {{that has changed}} little since August 1, 1941. <b>Elements</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> plot show the key weather elements, including temperature, dew point, wind, cloud cover, air pressure, pressure tendency, and precipitation.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea of a}} multi-scale pattern {{extends back}} to the interwar period in Europe. Early printed {{patterns}} of camouflage, like the 1929 Italian telo mimetico, have larger and smaller <b>elements</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> patterns.|$|E
5|$|The {{replacement}} of the underpass was one of twelve <b>elements</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Castleford Regeneration Project, originally proposed in 2001. It was featured in a four-part television series, Kevin McCloud and the Big Town Plan, broadcast by Channel 4 in August–September 2008.|$|E

50|$|Pedalfer is a {{formative}} <b>element</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States soil taxonomic {{system for}} the Alfisols soil order. Alf is <b>the</b> formative <b>element</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Alfisol name, and refers to aluminium (Al) and iron (Fe).|$|R
25|$|Silicon is {{the eighth}} most common <b>element</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{universe}} by mass, but very rarely occurs as <b>the</b> pure <b>element</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Earth's crust. It is most widely distributed in dusts, sands, planetoids, and planets as {{various forms of}} silicon dioxide (silica) or silicates. Over 90% of the Earth's crust is composed of silicate minerals, making silicon the second most abundant <b>element</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Earth's crust (about 28% by mass) after oxygen.|$|R
5|$|The {{score of}} For Your Eyes Only {{was written by}} Bill Conti, who {{retained}} a number of John Barry-influenced brass <b>elements</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> score but also added elements of dance and funk music.|$|E
5|$|A cow, {{identified}} with Kamadhenu, is often depicted accompanying the god Dattatreya. In {{relation to the}} deity's iconography, she denotes the Brahminical aspect and Vaishnava connection of the deity contrasting with the accompanying dogs—symbolizing a non-Brahminical aspect. She also symbolizes the Panch Bhuta (the five classical <b>elements)</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> icon. Dattatreya is sometimes depicted holding the divine cow {{in one of his}} hands.|$|E
5|$|A {{hierarchical}} structure of matter began to form from minute {{variations in the}} mass density of space. Matter accumulated in the densest regions, forming clouds of gas and the earliest stars, the Population III stars. These massive stars triggered the reionization process and {{are believed to have}} created many of the heavy <b>elements</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early Universe, which, through nuclear decay, create lighter elements, allowing the cycle of nucleosynthesis to continue longer.|$|E
25|$|Choose a new {{separator}} (either <b>the</b> largest <b>element</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> left subtree or <b>the</b> smallest <b>element</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> right subtree), {{remove it}} from the leaf node it is <b>in,</b> and replace <b>the</b> <b>element</b> to be deleted with the new separator.|$|R

5|$|Carbon is the 15th most {{abundant}} <b>element</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Earth's crust, {{and the fourth}} {{most abundant}} <b>element</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> universe by mass after hydrogen, helium, and oxygen. Carbon's abundance, its unique diversity of organic compounds, and its unusual ability to form polymers at the temperatures commonly encountered on Earth enables this element {{to serve as a}} common element of all known life. It is the second most abundant <b>element</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> human body by mass (about 18.5%) after oxygen.|$|R
5|$|According to Takahashi, the amyloid spores, the cheilocystidia {{covered with}} one or more, knob-like, apical excrescences, the diverticulate <b>elements</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{cortical}} layer of cap and stem, and the diverticulate caulocystidia suggest that the species is best classified in the section Fragilipedes, {{as defined by the}} Dutch Mycena specialist Maas Geesteranus.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the lighter}} elements, fluorine's {{abundance}} value of 400ppb (parts per billion) – 24th among <b>elements</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> universe – is exceptional: other elements from carbon to magnesium are twenty {{or more times}} as common. This is because stellar nucleosynthesis processes bypass fluorine, and any fluorine atoms otherwise created have high nuclear cross sections, allowing further fusion with hydrogen or helium to generate oxygen or neon respectively.|$|E
5|$|An {{elaborated}} APXS {{setup is}} equipped with a sensor head containing six curium sources having the total radioactive decay rate of several tens of millicuries (roughly a gigabecquerel). The sources are collimated on the sample, and the energy spectra of the alpha particles and protons scattered from the sample are analyzed (the proton analysis is implemented only in some spectrometers). These spectra contain quantitative information on all major <b>elements</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> samples except for hydrogen, helium and lithium.|$|E
3000|$|... {{does not}} {{necessarily}} have a solution {{because of the fact}} that a solution of the preceding equation constrains the equality between an <b>element</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> domain and an <b>element</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> range of <b>the</b> mapping. <b>In</b> such circumstances, one raises the following questions: [...]...|$|R

500|$|Potassium {{makes up}} about 2.6% {{of the weight}} of the earth's crust and is the seventh most {{abundant}} <b>element</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> crust. [...] It is the 17th most abundant <b>element</b> by weight <b>in</b> <b>the</b> earth, and 20th most abundant <b>element</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> solar system. <b>The</b> potassium concentration <b>in</b> seawater is 0.39g/L (0.039 wt/v%), about one twenty-seventh the concentration of sodium.|$|R
5|$|As {{tetravalent}} transition metals, {{all three}} elements form various inorganic compounds, generally in the oxidation state of +4. For {{the first three}} metals, {{it has been shown}} that they are resistant to concentrated alkalis, but halogens react with them to form tetrahalides. At higher temperatures, all three metals react with oxygen, nitrogen, carbon, boron, sulfur, and silicon. Because of the lanthanide contraction of the <b>elements</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fifth period, zirconium and hafnium have nearly identical ionic radii. The ionic radius of Zr4+ is 79picometers and that of Hf4+ is 78pm.|$|E
5|$|Astatine is an {{extremely}} radioactive element; all its isotopes have short half-lives of 8.1 hours or less, decaying into other astatine isotopes, bismuth, polonium or radon. Most of its isotopes are very unstable with half-lives of one second or less. Of the first 101 <b>elements</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> periodic table, only francium is less stable, and all the astatine isotopes more stable than francium are in any case synthetic and do not occur in nature.|$|E
5|$|Construction of {{the mosque}} began under the reign of Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in either 1634 or 1635, and was {{completed}} in approximately seven years. In the late 1880s, John Lockwood Kipling, father of Rudyard Kipling, wrote about the mosque and its decorative <b>elements</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> former Journal of Indian Art. The British scholar Fred Henry Andrews noted in 1903 that the mosque had fallen into disrepair.|$|E
30|$|The Apache {{element is}} mapped to <b>the</b> Server <b>element</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> OpenStack model. It is a {{one-to-one}} mapping relationship. The id, applicanceId, name and ip attributes of Apache element are mapped to the id, tenant_id, name and ip attributes of Server element. The flavor and status attributes of HwConfig element, are mapped to the flavorId and status attributes of Server <b>element.</b> <b>In</b> addition, <b>the</b> Apache <b>element</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> customized model represents the appliance with Apache platform deployed and the id of the {{certain type of}} virtual machine image is “ 6 ebf 952 c”. So the imageId attribute of <b>the</b> related Server <b>element</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> OpenStack runtime model should be “ 6 ebf 952 c” too.|$|R
50|$|Hence every <b>element</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> compact Hermitian {{symmetric}} space H / K is <b>in</b> <b>the</b> K-orbit {{of a point}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> polysphere; {{and every}} <b>element</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> image under the Borel embedding of the noncompact Hermitian symmetric space H* / K is <b>in</b> <b>the</b> K-orbit of a point <b>in</b> <b>the</b> polydisk.|$|R
5000|$|The {{name of the}} {{municipality}} (originally the parish) comes from the old Fjotland farm (Old Norse: Fjósaland). <b>The</b> first <b>element</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> name comes from the word fjøs which means [...] "barn" [...] and <b>the</b> last <b>element</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> name comes from the word land which means [...] "land".|$|R
5|$|Differential {{fields are}} fields {{equipped}} with a derivation, i.e., allow to take derivatives of <b>elements</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> field. For example, the field R(X), together with the standard derivative of polynomials forms a differential field. These fields are central to differential Galois theory, a variant of Galois theory dealing with linear differential equations.|$|E
5|$|Dynasty Warriors 4 {{is set in}} Ancient China {{during the}} time of the Three Kingdoms era. The game begins at the fall of the Han Dynasty, shortly before the death of Emperor Ling when the Yellow Turban Rebellion led by Zhang Jiao begun an {{uprising}} against the Empire. A number of <b>elements</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> game build on aspects of Chinese Mythology and there is a mix between fact and fiction as the game is built on the story of Romance of the Three Kingdoms.|$|E
5|$|Harassment and {{censorship}} {{imposed by}} the French colonial authorities led to the commercial failure of the Nam Dong Thu Xa. By the autumn of 1927, the group's priorities turned towards more direct political action, {{in a bid to}} appeal to more radical <b>elements</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> north. Membership grew to around 200, distributed among 18 cells in 14 provinces across northern and central Vietnam.|$|E
