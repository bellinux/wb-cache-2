5|$|The binary <b>ferrous</b> and ferric halides are well-known, {{with the}} {{exception}} of ferric iodide. The <b>ferrous</b> halides typically arise from treating iron metal with the corresponding hydrohalic acid to give the corresponding hydrated salts.|$|E
5|$|Sodium borates {{are used}} as a flux for {{soldering}} silver and gold and with ammonium chloride for welding <b>ferrous</b> metals. They are also fire retarding additives to plastics and rubber articles.|$|E
5|$|The {{spent acid}} {{has long been}} reused as iron(II) {{chloride}} (also known as <b>ferrous</b> chloride) solutions, but high heavy-metal levels in the pickling liquor have decreased this practice.|$|E
5|$|This {{reaction}} {{closely resembles}} the Schikorr reaction {{observed in the}} anaerobic oxidation of the <b>ferrous</b> hydroxide in contact with water.|$|E
5|$|For a few limited {{purposes}} {{when it is}} needed, {{pure iron}} is produced in the laboratory in small quantities by reducing the pure oxide or hydroxide with hydrogen, or forming iron pentacarbonyl and heating it to 250°C so that it decomposes to form pure iron powder. Another method is electrolysis of <b>ferrous</b> chloride onto an iron cathode.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{developed}} as a method to detect flaws or irregularities in magnetic materials, magnetic particle inspection {{can be used on}} firearms to visualize the serial number underneath the obliterated area. When performing this technique, examiners place the weapon in a magnetic field. The irregularities in the metal, in this case the serial number, cause the field to deform. When a solution of <b>ferrous</b> particles is added to the weapon's magnetized surface they will be attracted to the area where the magnetic field has deformed and will build up in the area. If fluorescent particles are added to the <b>ferrous</b> solution, ultraviolet light {{can be used to make}} it easier to visualize any recovered serial number.|$|E
5|$|Several {{chemical}} tests {{can be used}} to confirm the identify of the mushroom. A drop of <b>ferrous</b> sulfate (FeSO4) on the flesh turns it greenish, while potassium hydroxide (KOH) turns it brown. The cap cuticle turns yellow with nitric acid (HNO3), and yellow with ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH).|$|E
5|$|Several {{chemical}} tests can {{used to help}} confirm identification of the mushroom. The cap cuticle turns grayish with {{the application of a}} drop of <b>ferrous</b> sulfate (FeSO4), and dark brown to amber with a dilute solution of potassium hydroxide (KOH). The flesh turns pale brown with KOH, and pale yellow with ammonia (NH4OH).|$|E
5|$|Another line of {{research}} involved the biochemistry of the hemoglobin-oxyhemoglobin system. Conant ran a series of experiments with electrochemical oxidation and reduction, {{following in the footsteps}} of the famous German chemist and Nobel laureate Fritz Haber. He determined that the iron centre in methemoglobin is a ferric (FeIII) centre, unlike the <b>ferrous</b> (FeII) centre found in normal hemoglobin, and this difference in oxidation state is the cause of methemoglobinemia, a medical condition which causes tissue hypoxia.|$|E
5|$|Chemolithotrophy {{is a type}} of {{metabolism}} {{found in}} prokaryotes where energy is obtained from the oxidation of inorganic compounds. These organisms can use hydrogen, reduced sulfur compounds (such as sulfide, hydrogen sulfide and thiosulfate), <b>ferrous</b> iron (FeII) or ammonia as sources of reducing power and they gain energy from the oxidation of these compounds with electron acceptors such as oxygen or nitrite. These microbial processes are important in global biogeochemical cycles such as acetogenesis, nitrification and denitrification and are critical for soil fertility.|$|E
5|$|Designed in {{accordance}} with the standards of Maharishi Vastu Architecture, it features a blend of architectural styles across India. It is entirely constructed from Rajasthani pink sandstone and Italian Carrara marble. Based on traditional Hindu architectural guidelines (Shilpa shastras) on maximum temple life span, it makes no use of <b>ferrous</b> metal. Thus, it has no support from steel or concrete.|$|E
5|$|It {{was during}} his stay in Dnipropetrovsk {{that he met}} Leonid Brezhnev, a future leader of the Soviet Union. Tikhonov joined the All-Union Communist Party (bolsheviks) in 1940 {{and by the end}} of the decade, had secured a job as a plant director. As a director, Tikhonov was able to show off his {{organisational}} skills; under his leadership the plant became the first in the region to reopen a hospital, organising dining rooms and restoring social clubs for workers caught up in the aftermath of the Eastern Front. Tikhonov was quickly promoted, and started working for the Ministry of <b>Ferrous</b> Metallurgy in the 1950s. Between 1955 and 1960 Tikhonov became a Deputy Minister of the Ministry of <b>Ferrous</b> Metallurgy, a member (and later chairman) of the Scientific Council of the Council of Ministers, and finally, a deputy chairman of the State Planning Committee. At the 22nd Party Congress Tikhonov was elected to the Central Committee as a non-voting member. At the 23rd party congress in 1966, Tikhonov was elected a member of the Central Committee. Tikhonov was awarded the Hero of Socialist Labour award for his first time.|$|E
5|$|Overdoses of {{ingested}} iron {{can cause}} excessive levels of free iron in the blood. High {{blood levels of}} free <b>ferrous</b> iron react with peroxides to produce highly reactive free radicals that can damage DNA, proteins, lipids, and other cellular components. Iron toxicity occurs when the cell contains free iron, which generally occurs when iron levels exceed the availability of transferrin to bind the iron. Damage to {{the cells of the}} gastrointestinal tract can also prevent them from regulating iron absorption, leading to further increases in blood levels. Iron typically damages cells in the heart, liver and elsewhere, causing adverse effects that include coma, metabolic acidosis, shock, liver failure, coagulopathy, adult respiratory distress syndrome, long-term organ damage, and even death. Humans experience iron toxicity when the iron exceeds 20milligrams for every kilogram of body mass; 60milligrams per kilogram is considered a lethal dose. Overconsumption of iron, often the result of children eating large quantities of <b>ferrous</b> sulfate tablets intended for adult consumption, {{is one of the most}} common toxicological causes of death in children under six. The Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) sets the Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) for adults at 45mg/day. For children under fourteen years old the UL is 40mg/day.|$|E
5|$|Several {{chemical}} tests {{can be used}} to distinguish I.torosus from other similar boletes, such as I.rhodopurpureus. I.torosus displays the following characteristic colour changes with tests performed on cut flesh less than 12 hours old: ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH)–yellow centre bordered by a blue circular outer ring; potassium hydroxide (KOH)– deep buff (instantly); <b>ferrous</b> sulphate (FeS04)–no change; Melzer's reagent–dark blue; phenol–blue green (very slow); formalin–mid blue (slow).|$|E
5|$|Similar alloys {{with the}} {{addition}} of a small amount of lead can be cold-rolled into sheets. An alloy of 96% zinc and 4% aluminium is used to make stamping dies for low production run applications for which <b>ferrous</b> metal dies would be too expensive. For building facades, roofing, and other applications for sheet metal formed by deep drawing, roll forming, or bending, zinc alloys with titanium and copper are used. Unalloyed zinc is too brittle for these manufacturing processes.|$|E
5|$|Some {{chemical}} tests {{can be used}} to help identify the mushroom. A drop of dilute potassium hydroxide placed on the cap cuticle will stain dark red to blackish, and orange-yellow on the flesh, while <b>ferrous</b> sulphate solution turns the cuticle yellow and then greenish-yellow. Melzer's reagent will turn the flesh dark blue, after the natural bluing reaction to injury has faded.|$|E
5|$|Industrial use of {{diamonds}} {{has historically been}} associated with their hardness, which makes diamond the ideal material for cutting and grinding tools. As the hardest known naturally occurring material, diamond {{can be used to}} polish, cut, or wear away any material, including other diamonds. Common industrial applications of this property include diamond-tipped drill bits and saws, and the use of diamond powder as an abrasive. Less expensive industrial-grade diamonds, known as bort, with more flaws and poorer color than gems, are used for such purposes. Diamond is not suitable for machining <b>ferrous</b> alloys at high speeds, as carbon is soluble in iron at the high temperatures created by high-speed machining, leading to greatly increased wear on diamond tools compared to alternatives.|$|E
5|$|Lithotrophic {{bacteria}} can use inorganic compounds {{as a source}} of energy. Common inorganic electron donors are hydrogen, carbon monoxide, ammonia (leading to nitrification), <b>ferrous</b> iron and other reduced metal ions, and several reduced sulfur compounds. In unusual circumstances, the gas methane can be used by methanotrophic bacteria as both a source of electrons and a substrate for carbon anabolism. In both aerobic phototrophy and chemolithotrophy, oxygen is used as a terminal electron acceptor, whereas under anaerobic conditions inorganic compounds are used instead. Most lithotrophic organisms are autotrophic, whereas organotrophic organisms are heterotrophic.|$|E
5|$|Mild steel corrodes {{more readily}} than wrought iron, but is cheaper and more widely available. Carbon steel {{contains}} 2.0% carbon or less, with small amounts of manganese, sulfur, phosphorus, and silicon. Alloy steels contain varying amounts of carbon {{as well as other}} metals, such as chromium, vanadium, molybdenum, nickel, tungsten, etc. Their alloy content raises their cost, and so they are usually only employed for specialist uses. One common alloy steel, though, is stainless steel. Recent developments in <b>ferrous</b> metallurgy have produced a growing range of microalloyed steels, also termed 'HSLA' or high-strength, low alloy steels, containing tiny additions to produce high strengths and often spectacular toughness at minimal cost.|$|E
5|$|The {{process is}} {{versatile}} {{and can be}} performed with relatively inexpensive equipment, making it well suited to shop jobs and field work. An operator can become reasonably proficient with a modest amount of training and can achieve mastery with experience. Weld times are rather slow, since the consumable electrodes must be frequently replaced and because slag, the residue from the flux, must be chipped away after welding. Furthermore, the process is generally limited to welding <b>ferrous</b> materials, though special electrodes have made possible the welding of cast iron, nickel, aluminum, copper, and other metals.|$|E
5|$|A more {{progressive}} extraction process involves directly reducing manganese ore {{in a heap}} leach. This is done by percolating natural gas through {{the bottom of the}} heap; the natural gas provides the heat (needs to be at least 850°C) and the reducing agent (carbon monoxide). This reduces all of the manganese ore to manganese oxide (MnO), which is a leachable form. The ore then travels through a grinding circuit to reduce the particle size of the ore to between 150–250 μm, increasing the surface area to aid leaching. The ore is then added to a leach tank of sulfuric acid and <b>ferrous</b> iron (Fe2+) in a 1.6:1 ratio. The iron reacts with the manganese dioxide to form iron hydroxide and elemental manganese. This process yields approximately 92% recovery of the manganese. For further purification, the manganese can then be sent to an electrowinning facility.|$|E
5|$|Catabolism is {{the set of}} {{metabolic}} {{processes that}} break down large molecules. These include breaking down and oxidizing food molecules. The purpose of the catabolic reactions is to provide the energy and components needed by anabolic reactions which build molecules. The exact nature of these catabolic reactions differ from organism to organism, and organisms can be classified based on their sources of energy and carbon (their primary nutritional groups), {{as shown in the}} table below. Organic molecules are used as a source of energy by organotrophs, while lithotrophs use inorganic substrates, and phototrophs capture sunlight as chemical energy. However, all these different forms of metabolism depend on redox reactions that involve the transfer of electrons from reduced donor molecules such as organic molecules, water, ammonia, hydrogen sulfide or <b>ferrous</b> ions to acceptor molecules such as oxygen, nitrate or sulfate. In animals, these reactions involve complex organic molecules that are broken down to simpler molecules, such as carbon dioxide and water. In photosynthetic organisms, such as plants and cyanobacteria, these electron-transfer reactions do not release energy but are used as a way of storing energy absorbed from sunlight.|$|E
5|$|Celadon: Named after a pale-tinted spring green colour, Chinese {{archaeologist}} Wang Zhongshu (1982) {{asserts that}} shards having {{this type of}} ceramic glaze have been recovered from Eastern Han Dynasty (25–220 AD) tomb excavations in Zhejiang; he also asserts {{that this type of}} ceramic became well known during the Three Kingdoms (220–265). Richard Dewar (2002) disagrees with Wang's classification, stating that true celadon—which requires a minimum 1260°C (2300°F) furnace temperature, a preferred range of 1285° to 1305°C (2345° to 2381°F), and reduced firing—was not created until the beginning of the Northern Song Dynasty (960–1127). The unique grey or green celadon glaze is a result of iron oxide's transformation from ferric to <b>ferrous</b> iron (Fe2O3 → FeO) during the firing process. Longquan celadon wares, which Nigel Wood (1999) writes were first made during the Northern Song, had bluish, blue-green, and olive green glazes and high silica and alkali contents which resembled later porcelain wares made at Jingdezhen and Dehua rather than stonewares.|$|E
5|$|Gases {{from the}} furnace are cleaned using {{selective}} non-catalytic reduction (SNCR), spray absorbers and active carbon injection. These processes remove nitrogen oxides, acidic gasses, dioxins and heavy metals from the plants emissions. The remaining gases are passed through fine-fabric bag filters to remove and solid particles, {{before it is}} released from the chimney. Each incineration line has its own independent stack in the chimney, and the flue gases are continuously monitored before being released. This information is relayed to the control room. The remaining fly ash from the filters contains particles from the incineration, lime from the spray absorbers, salt and carbon dust, and so is stored in a sealed silo until it is taken from the site for disposal. Incinerator bottom ash left on the incineration grate after the burning is moved by converyor to a bunker. Whilst on the conveyor, a magnet removes <b>ferrous</b> metal from the ash for recycling. The remaining ash is then used as an aggregate in the construction industry.|$|E
5|$|Most {{industrial}} applications of synthetic diamond {{have long been}} associated with their hardness; this property makes diamond the ideal material for machine tools and cutting tools. As the hardest known naturally occurring material, diamond {{can be used to}} polish, cut, or wear away any material, including other diamonds. Common {{industrial applications}} of this ability include diamond-tipped drill bits and saws, and the use of diamond powder as an abrasive. These are by far the largest industrial applications of synthetic diamond. While natural diamond is also used for these purposes, synthetic HPHT diamond is more popular, mostly because of better reproducibility of its mechanical properties. Diamond is not suitable for machining <b>ferrous</b> alloys at high speeds, as carbon is soluble in iron at the high temperatures created by high-speed machining, leading to greatly increased wear on diamond tools compared to alternatives.|$|E
25|$|Copperas Rock {{has been}} stained a coppery-yellow color by <b>ferrous</b> sulfate that has leached {{from a small}} coal deposit. <b>Ferrous</b> sulfate is {{a leading cause of}} stream {{pollution}} in the streams of Pennsylvania, but the small amounts found in the Copperas Rock area are not enough to cause a significant problem in Great Trough Creek. A small cave found near Copperas Rock is thought to have been carved out by early settlers who used the <b>ferrous</b> sulfate mordant to set dyes to homespun fabrics.|$|E
25|$|Examples of oral iron {{that are}} often used are <b>ferrous</b> sulfate, <b>ferrous</b> gluconate, or amino acid chelate tablets. Recent {{research}} suggests the replacement dose of iron, {{at least in the}} elderly with iron deficiency, may be as little as 15mg per day of elemental iron.|$|E
25|$|Like any {{magnetic}} device, compasses {{are affected}} by nearby <b>ferrous</b> materials, {{as well as by}} strong local electromagnetic forces. Compasses used for wilderness land navigation should not be used in proximity to <b>ferrous</b> metal objects or electromagnetic fields (car electrical systems, automobile engines, steel pitons, etc.) as that can affect their accuracy. Compasses are particularly difficult to use accurately in or near trucks, cars or other mechanized vehicles even when corrected for deviation by the use of built-in magnets or other devices. Large amounts of <b>ferrous</b> metal combined with the on-and-off electrical fields caused by the vehicle's ignition and charging systems generally result in significant compass errors.|$|E
25|$|Spark {{testing is}} a method of {{determining}} the general classification of <b>ferrous</b> materials. It normally entails taking a piece of metal, usually scrap, and applying it to a grinding wheel in order to observe the sparks emitted. These sparks {{can be compared to}} a chart or to sparks from a known test sample to determine the classification. Spark testing also can be used to sort <b>ferrous</b> materials, establishing the difference from one another by noting whether the spark is the same or different.|$|E
25|$|Historically ironworkers mainly {{worked with}} wrought iron, but today they utilize many {{different}} materials including <b>ferrous</b> and non-ferrous metals, plastics, glass, concrete and composites.|$|E
25|$|Extensive or pancolitis. Patients usually {{require a}} {{combination}} of oral Mesalazine or sulfasalazine along with topical Mesalazine or steroid enemas. Oral prednisone (40–60mg/day) should be given only in severe cases or if oral Mesalazine fails. Once remission is induced, maintenance therapy is with standard oral Mesalazine doses. Supplemental iron (<b>ferrous</b> sulfate or <b>ferrous</b> gluconate) may be given due to chronic blood loss. Loperamide may be given for symptomatic relief of chronic diarrhea, but should not be given in suspected toxic megacolon.|$|E
25|$|Electron {{counting}} of this <b>ferrous</b> complex indicates 5 electrons {{from the}} cyclopentadienyl anion, 2 electrons {{from each of}} the carbonyls, and 1 electron from the iodide.|$|E
25|$|The {{chemistry}} of oxidation of pyrites, {{the production of}} <b>ferrous</b> ions and subsequently ferric ions, is very complex, and this complexity has considerably inhibited the design of effective treatment options.|$|E
25|$|The city is {{also home}} to Tamco Steel, which runs the only steel {{mini-mill}} in California. This mill recycles <b>ferrous</b> scrap, such as junked cars and appliances, to produce rebar.|$|E
25|$|Cleaning: These {{compounds}} {{are usually}} dilute acids or soaps designed to remove soil, grease, or {{oil from the}} incoming parts. They also provide corrosion resistance for <b>ferrous</b> and non-ferrous parts.|$|E
25|$|Titanium: Although {{titanium}} is a non-ferrous metal, {{it gives}} off {{a great deal}} of sparks. These sparks are easily distinguishable from <b>ferrous</b> metals, as they are a very brilliant, blinding, white color.|$|E
