At {{the end of the}} episode, Debra turns on the television in Dexter's apartment and shows him the news: a team of scuba divers in Biscayne Bay has uncovered over 30 <b>garbage</b> <b>bags,</b> each containing parts of Dexter's mutilated victims. As he watches, his heart races.|$|E
5|$|Switzerland {{also has}} an {{economic}} system for garbage disposal, which is based mostly on recycling and energy-producing incinerators {{due to a lack}} of space for open pit garbage disposals. As in other European countries, the Illegal disposal of garbage is not tolerated but usually the enforcement of such laws is limited to violations that involve the unlawful disposal of <b>garbage</b> <b>bags</b> at traffic intersections and public areas. In some cities, stickers need to be purchased that allow for identification of disposable garbage.|$|E
50|$|In 1984, the {{drawstring}} <b>garbage</b> <b>bag</b> {{was introduced}} by GLAD and Hefty. In 2001, Hefty introduced a <b>garbage</b> <b>bag</b> with a drawstring designed to stretch around the garbage can's rim and stay in place. In July 2004, ForceFlex, a flexible plastic <b>garbage</b> <b>bag,</b> {{was introduced by}} GLAD (followed by Hefty's Ultra Flex brand in September).|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} of the film's special effects were cheaply and efficiently produced using practical and in-camera effects. Early in the film, for example, de Ravin walks toward the camera out of a tunnel as a <b>garbage</b> <b>bag</b> floats downstream and engulfs the camera, transitioning to Joseph Gordon-Levitt back in his character's bedroom. To achieve this, the desired effect was filmed in reverse order. The <b>garbage</b> <b>bag</b> began over the camera and was pulled away during filming, as de Ravin walked backwards into the tunnel. This footage was then cut into {{a scene in which}} a <b>garbage</b> <b>bag</b> was simply pulled over Gordon-Levitt's head.|$|R

5|$|What Were You Hoping For? was {{released}} on September 27, 2011, by Hunt's independent record label Godless Hotspot in {{a joint venture with}} Nashville-based distributor Thirty Tigers. It was distributed by RED Distribution. Thirty Tigers reached out to Hunt during 2009 and offered their distribution and marketing services to him pending the album's completion. He subsequently assembled a marketing team and Godless Hotspot. What Were You Hoping For? was executive-produced by music manager and executive Randy Jackson, who originally helped Hunt get his first major-label record contract in 2003. The album's cover is a photograph taken by Hunt in North Hollywood that depicts an elderly woman looking askance at a collection of white <b>garbage</b> <b>bags</b> set against a concrete wall. The interior packaging of the album also features Hunt's photography, including a kaleidoscopic collage of photographed subjects in the fold-out CD booklet.|$|E
5|$|Leslie quickly seeks revenge against Lindsay {{by getting}} her parks {{employees}} to throw garbage over the Eagleton {{side of the}} fence. When Lindsay arrives to stop it, the two get into a fight amid the <b>garbage</b> <b>bags.</b> The police arrive and arrest both women: Lindsay is jailed in Pawnee, while Leslie is jailed in Eagleton's pristine and hotel-like holding cell. After Ann bails Leslie out, she tells her that Lindsay built the fence because she is jealous that Leslie was offered the Eagleton job first and wants to get a rise out of her. Ann suggests that Lindsay should be hit with a baseball bat, which gives Leslie the idea to turn Pawnee's side of Lafayette Park into a wiffle ball field, with the fence serving as the outfield wall. Lindsay is impressed by how fast Leslie turned the fence into something positive, and remembers why she and Leslie joined the parks department in the first place. With their relationship on the mend, the two agree {{to get a drink}} together. Later, Leslie returns to the office to throw Ron's party: she takes him to an empty room with steak, whiskey and his favorite movies waiting for him, and reveals that April and Andy's duties were false leads to trick him. Leslie explains she made a party that he would want and leaves a content Ron alone to enjoy his birthday.|$|E

2500|$|After the murder, Sarah and Cory took Adrianne's body to Sarah's grandparents' farm in Aledo, Illinois, {{where they}} tried to burn it [...] with gasoline. When it failed to burn after several hours, they {{recruited}} Nathan Gaudet, a 16-year-old boy from Moline, to help dismember the body. Nathan used his grandfather's handsaw to remove Adrianne's head and arms and placed them in a <b>garbage</b> <b>bag.</b> The three teenagers ate lunch at McDonald's, then later disposed of the <b>garbage</b> <b>bag</b> at the Black Hawk State Historic Site.|$|R
25|$|Maintenance {{measures}} include proper {{storage of}} garbage, removal of water sources, and elimination of environments suitable for nesting. Garbage cans {{need to be}} rat-resistant and made out of metal rather than plastic. Because rats easily chew through plastic, the Health Department recommends placing plastic <b>garbage</b> <b>bags</b> inside rat-resistant metal garbage cans. Garbage should be placed {{out on the street}} close to the pickup time, rather than the night before.|$|E
25|$|A twist tie is a {{metal wire}} that is {{encased in a}} thin strip of paper or plastic and is used to tie the {{openings}} of bags, such as <b>garbage</b> <b>bags</b> or bread bags. A twist tie is used by wrapping it around the item to be fastened, then twisting the ends together. The original twist tie was invented by the California-based packaging company T and T Industries, Inc. It was patented in 1939 and marketed as the Twist-Ems.|$|E
25|$|After the sorting of {{materials}} is finished, the Zabbaleen sell the sorted materials, such as paper, tin, rags, plastic materials, cloth, etc. The Zabbaleen sell these sorted materials to factories that then reuse these products, such as paper, {{in the creation}} of new material. According to Engi Wassef, the director of the documentary film, Marina of the Zabbaleen, PT plastic, which is the plastic used to make plastic bottles for water and other beverages, {{is one of the most}} highly sought out materials. In the case of PT plastic, the Zabbaleen would even export this material to China. However, the simple re-sale of sorted materials is not the only activity that the Zabbaleen do in terms of re-using these materials. They also create new materials from the materials that they have sorted. For example, granulators are used to change regular opaque-colored plastic into small plastic pellets. From these plastic pellets, a variety of plastic product can then be made, including <b>garbage</b> <b>bags</b> and plastic hangers. Handmade crafts are also made from rags and paper. Thus, the Zabbaleen system is a multi-tier system that is not limited to the simple collection of waste but also encompasses the creation of new materials from found recyclables.|$|E

500|$|There {{are three}} types of {{foraging}} behaviour observed in the common starling. [...] "Probing" [...] involves the bird plunging its beak into the ground randomly and repetitively until an insect has been found, and is often accompanied by bill gaping where the bird opens its beak in the soil to enlarge a hole. This behaviour, first described by Konrad Lorenz and given the German term zirkeln, {{is also used to}} create and widen holes in plastic <b>garbage</b> <b>bags.</b> It takes time for young common starlings to perfect this technique, and because of this the diet of young birds will often contain fewer insects. [...] "Hawking" [...] is the capture of flying insects directly from the air, and [...] "lunging" [...] is the less common technique of striking forward to catch a moving invertebrate on the ground. Earthworms are caught by pulling from soil. Common starlings that have periods without access to food, or have a reduction in the hours of light available for feeding, compensate by increasing their body mass by the deposition of fat.|$|E

[...] Rachelle Bond alleged that McCarthy had punched the toddler in the stomach multiple times after claiming Bella was a [...] "demon", {{and that he was}} the sole perpetrator of the murder. Prosecutors of McCarthy allege that Bella was murdered in one of many abusive occasions after she had been uncooperative about going to bed. Citing that McCarthy had decided to [...] "calm the child down," [...] they say Rachelle had not entered the room alongside her boyfriend. When she did enter, they say she witnessed him near the girl's body, which was [...] "swollen and gray," [...] indicating she was deceased. Rachelle Bond's attorney claims McCarthy threatened to murder her client if she contacted authorities. She also maintained that Rachelle was not involved with hiding the victim's body, which had initially been placed in <b>garbage</b> <b>bags</b> and concealed in a refrigerator. Bond later admitted to this accusation as part of a future plea deal. A cadaver dog brought to the house later indicated that it smelled something on the refrigerator. Bond contradicted the belief that the body was placed on Deer Island; she stated that McCarthy had [...] placed the body in a weighted duffel bag and disposed of it in the water, suggesting it drifted to the location where it was found.|$|E

Thus this research investigates the potential uses of <b>garbage</b> <b>bag</b> as a novel binder system in metal injection molding. Stainless steel SS 316 L was used which is <b>garbage</b> <b>bag</b> (HDPE) and palm kernel acts as binder system. Feedstock with three composition 30 %, 40 % and 55 % powder loading (PL) were injected by injection molding machine with several injection parameter were optimized such as injection temperature (A), barrel temperature (B), injection pressure (C) and Speed (D). The optimum parameter for highest green density, strength were optimized in Taguchi Method orthogonal Array L 9 (34) and analysed by using Signal to Noise Ratio (S/N ratio). Results shows the optimum variables for 30 % PL the highest density is A 0, B 2, C 1 and D 0 while for green strength are combination of A 0, B 0, C 0, D 1. For powder loading 40 %, the optimize parameter for highest green part density are A 2, B 2, C 0 and D 2 and A 0, B 0, C 1, and D 0 for green strength. Besides, the highest green density for 0. 55 PL by following the optimum variable are A 2, B 2, C 0 and D 2 while for highest green strength are A 2, B 2, C 2, and D 2. <b>Garbage</b> <b>bag</b> are suitable acted as a binder system in metal injection molding.
