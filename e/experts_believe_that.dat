5|$|Tuatara {{probably}} have the slowest {{growth rates of}} any reptile, continuing to grow larger for the first 35years of their lives. The average lifespan is about 60years, but they can live to be well over 100years old. One such male even reproduced successfully {{for the first time}} at 111 years of age with an 80 year old female. Some <b>experts</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> captive tuatara could live as long as 200 years.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} side, the cement {{industry}} in Iran {{is one of}} the economic sectors that will be hit the hardest in Iran following of the subsidy reform plan, because many Iranian cement factories are energy inefficient (Notwithstanding possible adjustment and/or liberalization of commodities prices by the government during implementation). Taxi, delivery and truck drivers have also been adversely affected by the recent gas price increase. <b>Experts</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the removal of subsidies is likely to have an adverse impact on the profitability of the automotive sector {{for at least the next}} 2–3 years.|$|E
5|$|The very {{extensive}} survey {{carried out}} (2005–2009) by the Battlefields Trust headed by Glenn Foard led eventually {{to the discovery}} of the real location of the core battlefield. This lies about a kilometer further west than the location suggested by Peter Foss. It is in what was {{at the time of the}} battle an area of marginal land at the meeting of several township boundaries. There was a cluster of field names suggesting the presence of marshland and heath. Thirty four lead round shot were discovered as a result of systematic metal detecting (more than the total found previously on all other C15th European battlefields), as well as other significant finds, including a small silver gilt badge depicting a boar. <b>Experts</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the boar badge could indicate the actual site of Richard III's death, since this high-status badge depicting his personal emblem, was probably worn by a member of his close retinue.|$|E

5|$|At {{the turn}} of the century, the {{psychiatric}} reform that had been implemented by Franco Basaglia in Italy became known and was publicly declared to be implemented in Russia, with the view of retrenchment of expenditures. But {{when it became clear that}} even more money was needed for the reform, it got bogged down in the same way the reform of the army and many other undertakings did. Russia is decades behind the countries of the European Union in mental health reform, which has already been implemented or is being implemented in them. Until Russian society, Gushansky says, is aware of the need for mental health reform, we will live in the atmosphere of animosity, mistrust and violence. Many <b>experts</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> problems spread beyond psychiatry to society as a whole. As Robert van Voren supposes, the Russians want to have their compatriots with mental disorders locked up outside the city and do not want to have them in community. Despite the 1992 Russian Mental Health Law, coercive psychiatry in Russia remains generally unregulated and fashioned by the same trends toward hyperdiagnosis and overreliance on institutional care characteristic of the Soviet period. In the Soviet Union, there had been an increase of the bed numbers because psychiatric services had been used to treat dissidents.|$|E

25|$|Iran's {{nuclear program}} has been a subject of {{international}} debate for decades. The Iranian government claims the purpose of its nuclear development is to produce electricity and Khamenei has said that they fundamentally reject nuclear weapons, while <b>experts</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> Iran is technically able to enrich uranium for producing a bomb within a few months.|$|E
25|$|According to Transparency International, the {{government}} of Afghanistan is the third most-corrupt in the world. <b>Experts</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the poor decisions of Afghan politicians contribute to the unrest in the region. This also prevents foreign investment in Afghanistan, especially by Western countries. In 2012, there were reportedly $3.9billion paid to public officials in bribes which contributed to these issues.|$|E
25|$|The human {{digestive}} system is omnivorous, capable of consuming {{a wide variety}} of plant and animal material. Some nutritional <b>experts</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> early hominids evolved into eating meat as a result of huge climatic changes that took place three to four million years ago, when forests and jungles dried up and became open grasslands and opened hunting and scavenging opportunities.|$|E
5000|$|Carlos Menem Jr., {{son of the}} president, died in a {{helicopter}} accident on March 15, 1995. He was 26 years old.

25|$|On October 10, 2006, {{an unnamed}} North Korean {{official}} {{was quoted as}} saying that North Korea could launch a nuclear missile unless the United States would sit down for face-to-face talks.

25|$|Many <b>experts</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the timing, {{which was}} in the very early hours of July 5 in Korea, but midday of July 4 in the United States when space shuttle Discovery was about to lift off, was {{deliberate}} to get attention from the United States, and possibly an attempt for one on one talks rather than the six party talks regarding North Korea's nuclear capabilities.|$|E
25|$|Some {{messages}} are {{presented to the}} listener backwards. While listening to a normal forward message (often somewhat nonsensical), one is simultaneously being treated to a backwards message (in other words, the lyric sounds like one set of words going forward, and {{a different set of}} words going backwards). Some <b>experts</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> while the conscious mind is absorbing the forward lyric, the subconscious is working overtime to decipher the backwards message.|$|E
50|$|On 14 January 2010 it was {{reported}} that the National Parks and Wildlife Service and shipping <b>experts</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> the Sygna could rust to the waterline within ten years.

25|$|Another main {{factor is}} the tension placed on the ligaments that support the navicular bone. Some <b>experts</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the {{degenerative}} process begins with excess tension placed on these ligaments, causing strain and inflammation. Inflammation from strain of the impar ligament can decrease blood flow {{to and from the}} navicular bone, as the major blood vessels supplying the bone run up and down this area. If the ligament continues to be strained, it can thicken and permanently reduce blood flow to the navicular bone.|$|E
25|$|On June 18, 2015 Kudrin {{proposed}} to hold early presidential elections. He justified this need for global reform and cited {{the example of}} the President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev, who did just that. State Duma deputy from the party A Just Russia Mikhail Emelyanov considered this statement Kudrin's entry into the presidential race. The next day, Alexei Kudrin said that {{he is not going to}} run for the presidency, however, many <b>experts</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> Kudrin wants to return to the Federal Government, and even take the place of the Prime Minister.|$|E
25|$|In March 2008, the {{government}} approved Resolution 24/2008, which {{created a new}} natural gas market called “Gas Plus” to encourage private investment in natural gas exploration and production. The Gas Plus regime applies to new discoveries and to “tight gas” fields. The price of the new gas, whose commercialization will be restricted to the domestic market, will {{not be subject to}} the conditions established in the “Agreement with Natural Gas Producers 2007-2011” but will be based on costs and a reasonable profit. <b>Experts</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that,</b> if the Gas Plus regime is successful, it could stimulate new investments in electricity generation plants under the Energy Plus regime as it could ensure fuel supply to the new plants.|$|E

5000|$|As {{a result}} of the recent attacks in Germany, the hashtag #Merkelsommer and phrase [...] "Merkel summer" [...] trended on Twitter {{starting}} on 25 July 2016 and appeared in other social media. <b>Experts</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> the recent attacks could create an anti-foreigner sentiment in the country, thus presenting criticism and pressure for Angela Merkel, the Chancellor of Germany since 2005.|$|R
5000|$|Critical systems whose network {{addresses}} {{would not}} be generally known were targeted, including those serving telephony and financial transaction processing. Although {{not all of the}} computer crackers behind the cyberwarfare have been unveiled, some <b>experts</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> such efforts exceed the skills of individual activists or even organised crime as they require a co-operation of a state and a large telecom company.|$|R
25|$|In the end, the Russian {{population}} {{pays for}} this corruption. For example, some <b>experts</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the rapid increases in tariffs for housing, water, gas and electricity, which significantly outpace {{the rate of}} inflation, are {{a direct result of}} high volumes of corruption at the highest levels. In the recent years the reaction to corruption has changed: starting from Putin's second term, very few corruption cases {{have been the subject of}} outrage. Putin's system is remarkable for its ubiquitous and open merging of the civil service and business, as well as its use of relatives, friends, and acquaintances to benefit from budgetary expenditures and take over state property. Corporate, property, and land raiding is commonplace.|$|E
25|$|Medicare {{finds itself}} in the odd {{position}} of having assumed control of graduate medical education, currently facing major budget constraints, and as a result, freezing funding for graduate medical education, {{as well as for}} physician reimbursement rates. This halt in funding in turn exacerbates the exact problem Medicare sought to solve in the first place: improving the availability of medical care. However, some healthcare administration <b>experts</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the shortage of physicians may be an opportunity for providers to reorganize their delivery systems to become less costly and more efficient. Physicians' assistants and Advanced Registered Nurse Practitioners may begin assuming more responsibilities that traditionally fell to doctors, but do not necessarily require the advanced training and skill of a physician.|$|E
25|$|Lengthy fasting can be {{dangerous}} due {{to the risk of}} malnutrition and should be carried out only under medical supervision. During prolonged fasting or very low calorie diets the reduction of blood glucose, the preferred energy source of the brain, causes the body to deplete its glycogen stores. Once glycogen is depleted the body begins to fuel the brain using ketones, while also metabolizing body protein (including but not limited to skeletal muscle) to be used to synthesize sugars for use as energy {{by the rest of the}} body. Most <b>experts</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> a prolonged fast can lead to muscle wasting, although some dispute this. The use of short-term fasting, or various forms of intermittent fasting have been used as a form of dieting to circumvent this issue.|$|E
