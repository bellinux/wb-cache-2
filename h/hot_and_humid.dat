5|$|Plymouth's {{climate is}} a {{transitional}} humid continental/cold humid subtropical/marine type, {{which is the}} predominant climate for Massachusetts. Due to its location on the Atlantic Ocean, humidity levels can be very high year-round. Plymouth's coastal location causes it to experience warmer temperatures than many inland locations in New England. Summers are typically <b>hot</b> <b>and</b> <b>humid,</b> while winters are cold, windy and often snowy.|$|E
5|$|Saint Paul has a {{continental}} climate {{typical of the}} Upper Midwestern United States. Winters are frigid and snowy, while summers are warm to <b>hot</b> <b>and</b> <b>humid.</b> On the Köppen climate classification, Saint Paul falls in the hot summer humid continental climate zone (Dfa). The city experiences {{a full range of}} precipitation and related weather events, including snow, sleet, ice, rain, thunderstorms, tornadoes, and fog.|$|E
5|$|The {{race was}} {{won by the}} Spanish rider Samuel Sánchez in 6hours, 23minutes, 49seconds, after a six-man {{breakaway}} group contested a sprint finish. Davide Rebellin of Italy and Fabian Cancellara of Switzerland, finishing second and third place with {{the same time as}} Sánchez, received silver and bronze medals respectively for the event. The <b>hot</b> <b>and</b> <b>humid</b> conditions were {{in sharp contrast to the}} heavy rain weathered in the women's road race the following day.|$|E

5|$|Washington {{is in the}} {{northern}} part of the humid subtropical climate zone (Köppen: Cfa) However, under the Trewartha climate classification, the city has a temperate maritime climate (Do). Winters are usually chilly with light snow, and summers are <b>hot</b> <b>and</b> <b>humid.</b> The District is in plant hardiness zone 8a near downtown, and zone 7b elsewhere in the city, indicating a humid subtropical climate.|$|E
5|$|As {{a part of}} Terengganu, Kuala Terengganu has a {{tropical}} rainforest climate under the Köppen climate classification (Af) with constant temperature and high humidity. The amount of rainfall varies according to the monsoon season. It is generally fairly <b>hot</b> <b>and</b> <b>humid</b> all year round, averaging from 28°C to 30°C in daytime and slightly cooler after dusk. Nevertheless, the sea breeze from South China Sea hsomehow moderates the humidity in offshore areas while the altitude and lush forest trees and plant has cooled the mountain and rural areas.|$|E
5|$|Thunderstorms {{began to}} form again just before midday, as the <b>hot</b> <b>and</b> <b>humid</b> {{conditions}} became more acute {{in the middle}} part of the day. The Bureau of Meteorology radar picked {{up a series of}} cells to the north-west of Brisbane, the capital of Queensland, and the data suggested that there was a possibility of large hail. The Bureau immediately issued a Severe Thunderstorm Warning for the coastal region between Brisbane and the Sunshine Coast, 100km to the north.|$|E

5|$|The FCI {{refused to}} suspend Petacchi, and he {{returned}} to racing in late July. Their decision, however, was not made to exonerate Petacchi, but rather {{because they did not}} believe they should hear the case, instead deferring to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). The CAS heard the case, and Petacchi testified to the court, stating that the <b>hot</b> <b>and</b> <b>humid</b> day on which the stage was the run had made it so that he took several extra puffs from his inhaler, but that this was accidental and that most had come after he had already crossed the finish line and won the stage.|$|E
5|$|Hassett {{batted in}} a {{restrained}} manner, while Bradman attacked. The Australian captain was 31 and his deputy 13 as the tourists reached stumps at 1/63. Bradman did {{the majority of}} the scoring during the closing stages of the afternoon, adding 31 in a partnership of 50. On the third morning, play resumed in <b>hot</b> <b>and</b> <b>humid</b> conditions. In the second over delivered by Dick Pollard, the bowler made the second ball lift unexpectedly. Hassett was unable {{to get out of the}} way and edged the ball to Jack Crapp for 13. Bradman was out in the same over and Australia were in trouble at 3/68, but they recovered after a middle-order counterattack took them to 458 early on the fourth day. Hassett then caught Bedser during England's second innings.|$|E
5|$|Most ants are univoltine, {{producing}} {{a new generation}} each year. During the species-specific breeding period, new reproductives, females, and winged males leave the colony in {{what is called a}} nuptial flight. The nuptial flight usually takes place in the late spring or early summer when the weather is <b>hot</b> <b>and</b> <b>humid.</b> Heat makes flying easier and freshly fallen rain makes the ground softer for mated queens to dig nests. Males typically take flight before the females. Males then use visual cues to find a common mating ground, for example, a landmark such as a pine tree to which other males in the area converge. Males secrete a mating pheromone that females follow. Males will mount females in the air, but the actual mating process usually takes place on the ground. Females of some species mate with just one male but in others they may mate with as many as ten or more different males, storing the sperm in their spermathecae.|$|E

5|$|The {{architecture}} of Kuala Lumpur {{is a mixture}} of old colonial influences, Asian traditions, Malay Islamic inspirations, modern, and postmodern architecture mix. Being a relatively young city compared with other Southeast Asian capitals such as Bangkok, Jakarta and Manila, most of Kuala Lumpur's notable colonial-era buildings were built {{toward the end of the}} 19th and early 20th centuries. These buildings were designed in a number of styles – Mughal/Moorish Revival, Mock Tudor, Neo-Gothic or Grecian-Spanish style or architecture. Most of the styling has been modified to use local resources and acclimatised to the local climate, which is <b>hot</b> <b>and</b> <b>humid</b> all year around. A significant architect of the early period is Arthur Benison Hubback who designed a number of the colonial era buildings including the Kuala Lumpur Railway Station and Jamek Mosque.|$|E
5|$|The <b>hot</b> <b>and</b> <b>humid</b> {{conditions}} in Nanning slowed the runners' pace and twelve of them remained within the main pack by the 10km point. The following five kilometres was decisive for the race, as Samuel Tsegay, Titus Masai and Mosop were all left trailing. The leading four runners were soon reduced to three, as Kipruto fell away to leave Zersenay Tadese, Wilson Kiprop and Sammy Kitwara to {{battle for the}} medal positions. Zersenay and Kiprop were neck and neck in the lead from the last kilometre and it was Kiprop who pulled away in the final 100metres to break the Eritrean's four-year undefeated streak. Zersenay faded badly {{at the end and}} appeared injured after taking second place. Kitwara and Kipruto were third and fourth, sealing the Kenyan team victory, while Samuel Tsegay's fifth place helped Eritrea to the team silver.|$|E
5|$|On {{the third}} morning, play resumed under <b>hot</b> <b>and</b> <b>humid</b> conditions. There had been {{rain on the}} pitch at 07:00, and Bradman resumed {{proceedings}} by taking a single from a Bedser no ball. In same over, one ball reared from the pitch and moved into Bradman, hitting him in the groin, causing a delay as he recovered from the pain and recomposed himself before play resumed. In the second over of the day, Pollard got the second ball to lift. Caught out by the unexpected bounce, Hassett was unable {{to get out of}} the way and edged the ball to Crapp in the slips for 13. Miller came to the crease and drove his first ball for three runs, bringing Bradman on strike for the fourth ball of the over. Pollard then pitched a ball in the same place as he did to Hassett, but this time it skidded low off the pitch, deviated back in and knocked out Bradman's off stump for 33. According to O'Reilly, Bradman backed away from the ball as it cut off the pitch with a noticeable flinch. O'Reilly attributed Bradman's unwillingness to get behind the ball to the blow inflicted on him by Bedser in the previous over and the rearing ball that dismissed Hassett.|$|E

5|$|This region's land is {{appropriate}} for agricultural and livestock activities. It is mostly a flat area, interrupted only by the Tandilia and Ventana hills in its southern portion. The climate of the Pampas is temperate and humid with no dry season, featuring hot summers and mild winters (Cfa/Cfb according to the Köppen climate classification). The weather in the Pampas is variable due to the contrasting air masses and frontal storms that impact the region. Maritime polar air from the south produces the cool pampero winds, while warm humid tropical air from the north produces sultry nortes - a gentle wind usually from the northeast formed by trade winds, and the South Atlantic High that brings cloudy, <b>hot,</b> <b>and</b> <b>humid</b> weather and is responsible for bringing heat waves. The Pampas {{are influenced by the}} El Niño–Southern Oscillation which is responsible for variations in annual precipitation. An El Niño year often leads to higher precipitation, while a La Niña year leads to lower precipitation. The Pampas are moderately sunny, ranging from an average of 4–5 hours of sunshine per day during the winter months to 8–9 hours in summer.|$|E
5|$|Initial weather {{forecasts}} predicted rain for the Thursday qualifying sessions, but {{it failed}} to materialise. The teams had two full sessions of clear but <b>hot</b> <b>and</b> <b>humid</b> conditions. Nick Tandy's Porsche led the session with a three minutes and 18.862 seconds lap, but remained in third position on the provisional grid. Audi No. 7 {{was the only other}} car to put in an improved lap time amongst the top ten cars. TDS Racing was the fastest LMP2 car in the session with a three minutes and 40.441 seconds yet still over two seconds behind the pole time of KCMG. The LMGTE categories also remained much the same, as Aston Martin still occupied the top four qualifying positions. Twice the session was stopped for heavy accidents, first for the No. 55 AF Corse Ferrari of Duncan Cameron who became stuck in a gravel trap for about fifteen minutes. The second stoppage occurred when Jan Magnussen suffered a mechanical failure in his No. 63 Chevrolet Corvette C7.R and hit the barriers twice in the Porsche Curves. Repairs to the barriers forced the cancellation of the remainder of the session, although half an hour was added to the final qualifying session. Magnussen was transported to the track's medical centre for a check-up and later released by the race organiser's medical staff. The Corvette was unable to be repaired and the team was forced to withdraw from the race because they did not bring a spare chassis to Le Mans.|$|E
5|$|Moncton has a {{warm summer}} {{continental}} climate (Köppen climate classification Dfb) with uniform precipitation distribution. Winter days are typically cold but generally sunny with solar radiation generating some warmth. Daytime high temperatures usually range {{a few degrees}} below the freezing point. Major snowfalls can result from nor'easter ocean storms moving up {{the east coast of}} North America. These major snowfalls typically average 20–30cm (8–12in) and are frequently mixed with rain or freezing rain. Spring is frequently delayed because the sea ice that forms in the nearby Gulf of St. Lawrence during the previous winter requires time to melt, and this will cool onshore winds, which can extend inland as far as Moncton. The ice burden in the gulf has diminished considerably {{over the course of the}} last decade (which may be a consequence of global warming), and the springtime cooling effect has weakened as a result. Daytime temperatures above freezing are typical by late February. Trees are usually in full leaf by late May. Summers are <b>hot</b> <b>and</b> <b>humid</b> due to the seasonal prevailing westerly winds strengthening the continental tendencies of the local climate. Daytime highs sometimes reach more than 30°C (86°F). Rainfall is generally modest, especially in late July and August, and periods of drought are not uncommon. Autumn daytime temperatures remain mild until late October. First snowfalls usually do not occur until late November and consistent snow cover on the ground does not happen until late December. The Fundy coast of New Brunswick occasionally experiences the effects of post-tropical storms. The stormiest weather of the year, with the greatest precipitation and the strongest winds, usually occurs during the fall/winter transition (November to mid-January).|$|E
