5|$|Anhingas are cormorant-like water {{birds with}} long necks and long, {{straight}} beaks. They are fish eaters and often swim with only their neck above water <b>giving</b> <b>them</b> <b>the</b> {{appearance of a}} snake. One species has been recorded in South Carolina.|$|E
5|$|Individual sharks choose sites <b>giving</b> <b>them</b> <b>the</b> best ambush success. They prefer {{junctions}} {{of sandy}} and rocky substrates near reefs (used by many fishes for shelter) usually orienting themselves either toward or parallel to nearby vertical structures. They tend to face upslope, which may facilitate burying via falling sediment, bring more fish swimming downstream from the reef, or ease targeting by silhouetting prey against the sunlight.|$|E
5|$|Ninety {{percent or}} more of {{smallpox}} cases among unvaccinated persons were of the ordinary type. In this form of the disease, by {{the second day of the}} rash the macules became raised papules. By the third or fourth day the papules filled with an opalescent fluid to become vesicles. This fluid became opaque and turbid within 24–48 hours, <b>giving</b> <b>them</b> <b>the</b> appearance of pustules; however, the so-called pustules were filled with tissue debris, not pus.|$|E

5|$|Bayer catalogued five {{stars in}} the constellation, <b>giving</b> <b>them</b> <b>the</b> Bayer designations Alpha to Epsilon. John Flamsteed added Eta, Iota and four Roman letters; of these, only Iota is still used as the others were dropped in {{subsequent}} catalogues and star charts. Flamsteed gave 16 stars Flamsteed designations, of which numbers 1 and 16 are not used—1's coordinates were in error as there was no star present at the location that corresponds to any star in his Catalogus Britannicus; Baily presumed that the coordinates were mistranscribed 32s in error by Flamsteed and in fact referred to 7.4 magnitude HD 10407. Baily also noted that 16 Trianguli was closer to Aries and included it in the latter constellation.|$|E

5|$|By {{the sixth}} or seventh day, all the skin lesions have become pustules. Between seven and ten days the pustules matured and reached their maximum size. The pustules were sharply raised, {{typically}} round, tense, and {{firm to the}} touch. The pustules were deeply embedded in the dermis, <b>giving</b> <b>them</b> <b>the</b> feel of a small bead in the skin. Fluid slowly leaked from the pustules, {{and by the end}} of the second week the pustules deflated, and started to dry up, forming crusts (or scabs). By day 16–20 scabs had formed over all the lesions, which have started to flake off, leaving depigmented scars.|$|E

5|$|On the {{outbreak}} of hostilities in April 1775, the 64th was still stationed at Castle William and remained there as the garrison throughout the Siege of Boston.

5|$|As her fame grew, Coffin {{gained the}} {{opportunity}} to put her design principles into practice on a larger scale. Her practice had grown large {{enough for her to}} need an assistant by 1911, and by 1918 she had moved her office to larger premises at 830 Lexington Avenue. She also took on James Scheiner, an architect, as an associate. He became a key part of Coffin's practice, working on large-scale tasks such as overseeing work on the ground. This in turn opened up new opportunities for her to take on new, larger commissions. Coffin insisted on being paid the same fees as a male architect and to be treated equally in contracts; this was a novelty in itself, at a time when women were usually paid less than men. She also liked to employ women to work with her on commissions, <b>giving</b> <b>them</b> <b>the</b> chance to undertake apprenticeships that male prejudice had denied her when she had first started on her career.|$|E

5|$|At {{this time}} {{defendants}} {{were required to}} pay trial expenses, and Cofresí's family was charged 643 pieces of eight, two reales and 12 maravedí. Contemporary documents suggest that Juana Creitoff, {{with little or no}} support from Cofresí's brothers and sisters, was left with the debt. His brothers distanced themselves from the trial and their brother's legacy, and Juan Francisco left Cabo Rojo for Humacao. Ignacio also evidently disassociated himself from Creitoff and her daughter, and one of Ignacio's granddaughters ignored Bernardina and her descendants. Due to Cofresí's squandering of his treasure, his only asset the Spanish government could seize was Carlos. Appraised at 200 pesos, he was sold to Juan Saint Just for 133 pesos. After the auction costs were paid, only 108 pesos and 2 reales were left; the remainder was paid by Félix and Miguel Mattei after they made a deal with the authorities <b>giving</b> <b>them</b> <b>the</b> cargo of the San José y las Animas in return for future accountability. Juana Creitoff died a year later.|$|E
5|$|Athletes from 24countries won {{at least}} one medal, leaving 53countries without a medal. Germany led in overall medals (36) for the second {{consecutive}} Winter Games. Immediately following the Games, Germany was also the gold medal leader with twelve. Two years later, Norway was awarded two extra gold medals, raising their total to thirteen and <b>giving</b> <b>them</b> <b>the</b> lead. In addition, Norway tied the former Soviet Union in 1976 for most gold medals at a Winter Olympics. This record would later be broken by Canada at the 2010 Winter Olympics. Croatia and Estonia won the first medals and first Gold medals in their Winter Olympic history, while Australia and China won their first gold medals. With 36 total medals, Germany set a record for most total medals at a Winter Olympics.|$|E

5|$|For {{the next}} 20 years, Berg {{had no real}} job, living off friends and {{relatives}} who put up with {{him because of his}} charisma. When they would ask what he did for a living, he would reply by putting his finger to his lips, <b>giving</b> <b>them</b> <b>the</b> impression that he was still a spy. A lifelong bachelor, he lived with his brother Samuel for 17 years. According to Samuel, he became moody and snappish after the war and did not seem to care for much in life besides his books. His brother finally grew fed up with the arrangement and asked Moe to leave and even had eviction papers drawn up. After being evicted from his brother's home, Berg moved in with his sister Ethel in Belleville, New Jersey, where he remained {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
5|$|International {{and local}} media criticized the {{military}} government for inadequate warnings prior to Giri's landfall in the country. However, the junta claims to have informed the public appropriately. Little assistance had reached thousands of survivors days after the storm's passage, fueling anger from local media sources. Government relief slowly reached the area; however, workers only cleared debris left by the storm and only encouraged residents to rebuild by <b>giving</b> <b>them</b> <b>the</b> supplies needed to do so. Further criticism was made about the government withholding information on {{the loss of life}} and scale of damage. Requests were also made to postpone a national election for residents in Arakan State; however, no response was given and the elections were still planned to be held on November7.|$|E
