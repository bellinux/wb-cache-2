40|$|The {{structural}} intensity (SI) {{technique is}} an essential tool for locating and ranking vibration sources and sinks on structures. It can quantify vibration fields by plotting a vector map of energy transmission on the structures. In this paper, a different strategy, changing coordinate systems of plate equations, is used to develop an intensity equation from shear force components in both x and y directions. The formulation is {{carried out in the}} frequency domain considering flexural waves. Orthotropic plate theory, far-field conditions, Fourier transform, and finite difference approximation are considered. The same intensity definition is obtained using this different strategy.

40|$|All {{electrical}} signals can {{be described}} either {{as a function of}} time or of frequency. When we observe signals as a function of time they are called the time domain measurements. Sometimes, we observe the frequencies present in signals, in which case they are called the frequency domain measurements. The word spectrum refers to the frequency content of any signal. When signals are periodic, time and frequency are simply related; namely, one is the inverse of the other. Then we can use the Fourier series to find the spectrum of the signal. For non-periodic signals, a Fourier transform is used to get the spectrum. This chapter provides an overview of fast Fourier transform (FFT) techniques, as applied to dynamic signal <b>analysers</b> (or <b>FFT</b> <b>analysers)</b> or DSOs where spectrum components of a time varying signal are to be displayed. In addition, the essential principles and applications of swept-tuned spectrum analysers are discussed, because spectrum observations of higher frequency signals, such as those used in communications systems, are still beyond the capability of <b>FFT</b> <b>analysers...</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{engineering}} practice, structural intensity gives {{valuable information}} of {{sources and sinks}} of vibration excitations {{as well as a}} detailed knowledge of energy propagation through structures. As a result, proper damping treatment can be employed to mitigate noise and vibration harness (NVH) problems. In this paper, a complete description of general vibration intensity fields (W/m) in the frequency domain for isotropic plates is formulated considering flexural waves which is not based on some approximation such as far-field conditions. An 8 -point transducer array is required to get an intensity vector in a particular direction taking into account as many as fifteen cross-spectra of field signals. A multi-channel <b>FFT</b> <b>analyser</b> is useful for this measurement. However, one transducer frequency response method is also employed to estimate these cross-spectra alternately. It gives the measurements free from phase mismatch errors...|$|E
40|$|In-field {{testing for}} {{structural}} integrity using dynamic non-destructive investigation of ballasted railway track structures {{was carried out}} and is presented in this paper. A non-destructive technique, ‘modal analysis’, was utilised in this investigation. The railway track structures were dynamically excited using an impact excitation instrumented hammer. Due {{to the nature of}} railway track structures that they extrude for a long distance, the transient excitation was given randomly at several local areas. Acceleration responses in time domain were recorded using an accelerometer mounting on the railhead. The frequency response functions (FRFs) can be obtained via the PULSE <b>FFT</b> <b>Analyser.</b> The analytical formulation and best curve fitting algorithms were developed to identify the dynamic properties of railway tracks’ components. Rather than providing only the absolute solutions, this paper points out more on how to judge the dynamic responses (e. g. FRFs) together with the visual inspection of existing conditions from the field experience. Examples of testing results representing the deficient integrity are additionally highlighted. Based on the results, the impact excitation technique is an efficient method susceptible to the structural integrity of railway track structures...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} scenario, Energy demand is {{increasing}} day by day. To meet that demand, the production or extraction of crude oil, {{natural gas and}} other energy resources is done {{with the help of}} various pumps. Pumps are the second largest used machinery in world and plays a vital role. In this paper, we have done analysis on centrifugal pump categorised as overhung pump (OH 2). It is commonly known that vibration problems on centrifugal pumps can result from multitude of possible parameters which are not easily identified. Due to deviation of pumps from best efficiency point (BEP), their service life is reduced and vibration can be a root cause of this problem. The unwanted vibration especially in overhung pump effect the performance of centrifugal pump and its mechanical characteristics. In the present paper, we had done an analysis by changing the design of pump feet. During mathematical and experimental analysis (using <b>FFT</b> <b>analyser)</b> it was observed that frequency of vibration is reduced to certain amount which result in enhancing service life...|$|E

40|$|Two very {{different}} styles of practicals have been introduced into a conventional engineering vibrations course. This was a reintroduction of practical work into a class {{where it had been}} deleted for resource reasons. The first of the reinstated practicals demonstrated rotating out of balance and with it the use of common instrumentation such as <b>FFT</b> <b>analysers.</b> It was a conventional style of practical. The second demonstrated modal frequencies and mode-shapes for a multiple degree of freedom system using innovative simple experimental equipment that required extensive hands-on activities from the students. In this second practical the students explored the phenomena for themselves. Surveys of students revealed that they saw value in both styles of activity. Further, they would not as a group have preferred more lecture or tutorial time instead, or even private study time.

40|$|Composite {{materials}} {{are widely used}} in different arenas such as aircraft, naval and automobiles. Main motive behind that is the distinctive property of weight reduction, which is important for greater speeds, improved payloads and efficient fuel consumption. Various damages like cracks or delamination are inevitable during service period. They {{may be due to}} impact load, chemical decay or change in temperature or pressure conditions. It has been experimentally proved that confined damage in a structure causes the reduction in local structural stiffness, resulting in deviations in dynamic performance of the structure. Additional resonance or crack proliferation induce large displacements resulting in the failure of the structure. In this study, efforts have been made to determine the natural frequency of vibration of composite plate in different boundary conditions and the multiple parameters of crack have been varied and the results have been established. The tests on composite plate is done experimentally to find natural frequency using <b>FFT</b> <b>analyser</b> and the results are validated using ANSYS. The work is done with varying crack parameters like depth, length and orientation. The frequency decreases with increase in crack dimensions and decreases with increasing orientations. For different boundary conditions, frequency increases with decreasing degrees of freedom. This will help in designing structures resistant to earthquakes and other disasters, given that the resonance frequency is known earlier. It will help in building a safe structure and will prolong its life for many years...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} use of {{vibration}} and strain measurements on machine tools {{in order to identify}} the propagating wear of the selected tools. Two case studies are considered, one of which was conducted in the plant of a South African piston manufacturer. The purpose of the ftrst case study was to investigate the feasibility of vibration monitoring to identify tool wear, before attempting to implement a monitoring system in the manufacturing plant. During this case study, data from a turning process was recorded using two accelerometers coupled to a PL 202 real time <b>FFT</b> <b>analyser.</b> Features indicative of tool wear were extracted from the sensor signals, and then used as inputs to a Self-Organising Map (SOM). The SOM is a type of neural network based on unsupervised learning, and can be used to classify the input data into regions corresponding to new and worn tools. It was also shown that the SOM can also be used very efficiently with discrete variables. One of the main contributions of the second case study was the fact that a unique type of tool was investigated, namely a synthetic diamond tool specifically used for the manufacturing of aluminium pistons. Data from the manufacturing of pistons was recorded with two piezoelectric strain sensors and a single accelerometer, all coupled to a DSPT Siglab analyser. A large number of features indicative of tool wear were automatically extracted from different parts of the original signals. These included features from time and frequency domain data, time series model coefficients as features and features extracted from wavelet packet analysis. A correlation coefficient approach was used to auto-lJUltically select the best features indicative of the progressive wear of the diamond tools. The SOM was once again used to identify the tool state. Some of the advantages of using different map sizes on the SOM were also demonstrated. A near 100 % correct classification of the tool wear data was obtained by training the SOM with two independent data sets, and testing it with a third independent data set. It was also shown that the monitoring strategy proposed in the second case study can be fully automated and can be implemented on-line if the manufacturer wishes to. Some of the contributions of this study are {{the use of}} the SOM for tool wear classification, and conclusions regarding the wear modes of the synthetic diamond tools.

40|$|In {{this paper}} results {{obtained}} {{with a new}} measuring and playback technique are presented. The main assumption of the technique is that {{the body of a}} violin behaves as a linear mechanic-acoustic system, transforming input forces applied by the strings on the bridge into acoustic pressure waves irradiated through the air. Provided that the measured Impulse Response of the violin is sufficiently long as to reflect the complete decay of the instrument, properties of the violin timbre are fully contained in the transfer function (frequency domain) or in the Impulse Response (time domain). As previously reported by the authors, the impulse responses or frequency responses of violins have been measured both with traditional techniques (2 channel <b>FFT</b> <b>analysers)</b> and with an MLS (Maximum Length Sequence) analyser. In this study, these measured impulse responses were convoluted with an "anechoic " signal which was sampled during an actual musical performance, where a phonograph needle was mounted on top of the violin bridge and the acquired data then stored in digital format on a computer. This original signal was a velocity signal, and had to be converted into an equivalent force signal by inverse-filtering for the mobility of the excitation point of the particular violin, prior to applying the convolution process. This made the input signal largely independent from the particular violin used to record it. The convolution process can be used also to add the reverberation and colouring of a concert hall for direct headphone listening, otherwise the simulation is "acoustically anechoic " and is suitable only to be reproduced by loudspeakers in a good quality...|$|R

40|$|Bone {{conduction}} as a phenomenon, {{physically and}} physiologically, is of vital importance {{in both the}} diagnosis of a hearing impairment {{and the development of}} bone conduction hearing aids. Understanding hearing by bone conduction is difficult, involving sound transmission by wave motion in a complex geometrical structure of layered bone covered with soft tissue and cartilage, finally received by the highly delicate cochlea. Current measurement techniques, with computers, <b>FFT</b> <b>analysers,</b> and miniature accelerometers, enable high quality measurements and analyses of complex structures. Objective investigations of a dry skull and of patients equipped with either binaurally or monaurally osseointegrated titanium fixtures, as well as subjective investigations of these patients, have yielded the results of the physical and physiological behaviour of bone conducted sound presented here. A bone-anchored hearing system with the transducer implanted offers some potential advantages, not only for current users of the bone-anchored hearing aid but also for sensorineural hearing impaired people who use air conduction aids. A bone-anchored hearing aid of present standard does not provide sufficient gain to aid a pure sensorineural loss; however, to implant the system would make it more beneficial. An attachment close to the cochlea improves the transmission by 5 to 10 dB and yields a better directionality. Moreover, in comparison with air conduction, bone conduction has greater loudness sensitivity, with up to 10 dB more efficient transmission in the range 30 to 80 dB HL. This behaviour may be explained by the efferent nerves to the middle and inner-ear. Although there is linear transmission for normal sound levels in the skull, bone conducted sound can be severely affected by structural characteristics such as the antiresonances of the skull. These antiresonances cause transcranial attenuation of up to 40 dB, resulting in a perceived sound lateralization. Also, a forced low-frequency antiresonance appears in the transmission to the ipsilateral cochlea when a transducer is applied in the mastoid area; this results in perception of the applied tone solely at the contralateral cochlea. For frequencies above the first free skull resonance, bone conducted sound is transmitted primarily by wave motion through the bones of the cranial vault and only secondarily {{at the base of the}} skull. The teeth are well suited for transmission of bone conducted sound and have a sensitivity close to that of the skin covered mastoid; both of these, however, are less sensitive than a percutaneous approach at the mastoid for frequencies above 1 kHz...|$|R
40|$|The {{principle}} of operation dictates that {{the output of}} a cycloconverter contains some harmonics. For drive applications, the harmonics at best increase losses in the motor and may well cause instability. Various methods of analysing the output waveform have been considered. A Fortran 77 program employing a modified Fourier series, making use {{of the fact that}} the input waveforms are sinusoidal, was used to compute the individual harmonic amplitudes. A six pulse three phase to single phase cycloconverter was built and a Z- 80 microprocessor was used for the control of firing angles. Phase locked loops were used for timing, and their effect upon the output with changing input frequency and voltage were established. The experimental waveforms are analysed by a <b>FFT</b> spectrum <b>analyser.</b> The flexibility of the control circuit enables the following investigations not easily carry out using traditional analog control circuit. The phase relationship between the cosine timing and reference wave in the cosinusoidal control method was shown to affect the output waveform and hence the harmonic content. There is no clear optimum value of phase and the T. H. D. up to 500 Hz remains virtually constant. However, the changes of individual harmonic amplitudes is quite significant. In practice it may not be possible to keep the value of phase constant but it should be considered when comparing control strategies. Another investigation involves the changing of the last firing angle in a half cycle. It shows that the value of firing angles produced by the cosinusoidal control method is desirable. Operation at theoretical maximum output frequency was also demonstrated. Bristol Universit...|$|R
40|$|Vibration and {{stability}} {{studies have been}} undertaken on glass fibre reinforced polymer composite unstiffened and stiffened plates to optimise their dynamic properties. Boundary conditions, stiffeners and orthotropy of the material add {{to the complexity of}} a mathematical solution and to overcome this problem experimental and analytical studies were undertaken. The former method was carried out by impact hammer and an <b>FFT</b> digital signal <b>analyser</b> and the latter method was undertaken using finite element computer software. The current research concentrated upon the procedures and possible techniques available to optimise the dynamic properties of the plate without introducing weight penalty with the object of achieving an efficient structural performance coupled with an economic design. It has been shown that most of the increase in frequency and critical buckling load was directly related to the increase in stiffness of the stiffener and its position on the plate structure. The mode shapes have provided information regarding the most advantageous position for the setting of the stiffeners; they must be positioned away from nodal lines. The effect of the stiffener was significant for the fully clamped and clamped/free plates where only bending modes of vibration are present. However, for the completely free plates, where both bending and torsional modes of vibration could occur, the effect that the stiffeners have on the torsional modes was minimal. To locate precisely the position of the stiffener may be difficult when the plates are subjected to in-plane compressive loads, because higher order mode shapes may interchange. The mass-saving advantage which has been obtained in this research has shown that the stiffened plates with top-hat stiffeners were seen to have higher natural frequencies, within a specific vibration mode, compared to stiffened plates with rectangular stiffeners (blade) ...|$|R
