After the 2000 takeover of the club by Evangelos Mytilinaios, the logo was changed once again to a more [...] "modern" [...] looking one. During the 2008 - 2009 season the club used a special logo, created especially for its centenary. The crest that is now used depicts the demigod Heracles resting upon his club, a scene inspired by Farnese Hercules statue, itself {{a copy of a}} statue crafted by Lysippos in the fourth century BC.|$|E

40|$|My thesis {{focuses on}} the {{representation}} gender stereotypes in Kartini 2014 - 2015 magazine advertisements. To analyze the advertisements, this thesis uses Goffman’s theory on gender stereotypes in advertisements. Goffman’s theory is used to explore whether women’s portrayals in advertisements <b>have</b> <b>changed</b> <b>through</b> <b>time.</b> In his theory, Goffman proposes five categories: Relative Size, Feminine Touch, Function Ranking, Licensed Withdrawal, and the Ritualization of Subordination. The results of my study show that eighty-five advertisements from Kartini 2014 - 2015 fit with Goffman’s categories. With regards to gender stereotypes, out of eighty-five advertisements analyzed, 83. 5...|$|R

The primary object is to investigate both the extent of market integration and how it may <b>have</b> <b>changed</b> <b>through</b> <b>time.</b> For all fifteen possible country pairs real interest differentials are mean reverting, and in two-thirds of these cases indistinguishable from zero statistically. Additional evidence points to a narrowing of differentials under floating rates over time {{and an increase in}} speeds of convergence. ...|$|R

50|$|A dynamic megabias {{occurs when}} the fossilization {{potential}} of one group relative to that of another group <b>changes</b> <b>through</b> <b>time.</b> For example, lingulide brachiopods had a lower fossilization potential than articulate brachiopods, {{but only in the}} early Paleozoic.This <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> <b>through</b> <b>time,</b> governed by <b>changes</b> in bathymetry and lateral shifts in lithofacies associated with basin evolution. By the Middle Ordovician, articulates had diversified to become important components of all marine environments except the deep basin; inarticulates were most important in offshore and basinal settings. By moving away from the main taphonomic window, the inarticulates sacrificed their fossilization potential whilst not necessarily decreasing their biological diversity.|$|R

It is hypothesized that market development, through increases in competition between processors and shifts in consumer preferences toward fish, <b>has</b> caused <b>changes</b> in price behavior among levels of the catfish market. Using monthly catfish price data, a cointegration analysis of subsets of prices shows that price behavior <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> <b>through</b> <b>time,</b> with catfish prices becoming integrated {{as the number of}} processors has increased.

50|$|Ecological-{{evolution}}ary theory (EET) is a sociological {{theory of}} sociocultural evolution {{that attempts to}} explain the origin and changes of society and culture. Key elements focus {{on the importance of}} natural environment and technological <b>change.</b> EET <b>has</b> been described as a theory of social stratification, as it analyzes how stratification <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> <b>through</b> <b>time</b> across different societies. It also has been viewed as a synthesis of the structural functionalism and conflict theory. Proposed by Gerhard Lenski, the theory perhaps is best articulated in his book, Ecological-Evolutionary Theory: Principles and Applications (2005).His major collaborators, Jean Lenski and Patrick Nolan, also are said to have contributed to EET.|$|R

Like Lake Lafayette and Lake Iamonia in Leon County, this was a prairie lake. In 1876, a plant-clogged Lake Miccosukee was described as being covered by maidencane, monocotyledonous and white bonnets. In 1914, {{a large amount of}} open water was noted, the lake was said to be covered with water to a depth of 2 to 5 feet. The southern end had grass and button bushes projecting above the water.

40|$|Financial market {{integration}} has significant implications for risk sharing and diversification, {{cost of capital}} estimation, market efficiency, financial decisions, and macro-economic policy. By relying on a multifactor asset pricing framework, this paper examines the integration of 11 African Stock Markets (ASMs) relative {{to the world and}} emerging markets, as well as the impact of the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) on their degree integration. We provide evidence that world, emerging market and African market factors command a significant risk premium in African markets, and that the markets are partially integrated with the world market.

Although a consensus view has developed on the determinants of a bank s decision to expand abroad and on the determinants of the patterns of expansion, the debate on the consequences of foreign bank presence is still open. The aim of this chapter is twofold. Firstly, it discusses the major results of the empirical literature studying the determinants, the patterns, and the consequences of bank foreign expansion. Secondly, it studies whether the determinants of bank foreign expansions <b>have</b> <b>changed</b> <b>through</b> <b>time,</b> estimating an econometric model of the patterns of cross-border bank M&As between 1990 and 2006. pozzolo@unimol. i...|$|R

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to determine how landscape patterns in Georgia, USA <b>have</b> <b>changed</b> <b>through</b> <b>time</b> and whether the spatial patterns varied by physiographic region. Historical aerial photography was used to analyze spatial patterns of land use from the 1930 's to the 1980 's. Land use patterns were quantified by: (1) mean number and size of patches; (2) fractal dimension of patches; (3) amount of edge between land uses; and (4) indices of diversity, dominance, and contagion. Forest cover increased in aerial extent and in mean patch size. The mean size of agricultural patches increased in the coastal plain and decreased in the mountains and Piedmont. Edges between land uses decreased <b>through</b> <b>time,</b> indicating less dissection of the landscape...|$|R
40|$|Soil use and {{function}} of the landscape of Pivka intermittent lakes <b>have</b> <b>changed</b> <b>through</b> <b>time,</b> which <b>has</b> led to <b>changes</b> in cultural landscape and, consequently, affected its diversity. Archived photographs are a good indicator of visible changes and can therefore be used in order to observe the changes that occurred during this era. The aim of this thesis is to determine visible changes of the cultural landscape in the selected parts of Pivka intermittent lakes by comparing photographs from two different periods and, at the same time, determine their tendency. For the analysis, a comparison of photographs is made, namely a historic photograph is compared to {{a photograph of the}} current state. Changes in the environment are determined based on noted differences. ...|$|R

The current understanding, on the contrary, is that the condition of poverty is unacceptable, and that it should be eradicated. This study investigates the impact of food security on urban poverty using Lagos state, Nigeria as a case study. The study reveals that four important proxies (high level of education, small household size, healthy households and high income,) for food security have huge impact on poverty and significant impact on urban poverty. Hence; with good policy in place ensuring food security, poverty can be overcome...|$|R

40|$|The {{nature of}} public goods <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> <b>through</b> <b>time</b> and so <b>has</b> the {{literature}} on public goods provision which has experienced a significant increase since Samuelson's (1954) paper. The common goal is to allow the description of a more general class of non-rival goods.

In this note we try to show the hypotheses underlying the different functions used. We argue that the different approaches are suitable only if used in the right framework and this should be kept in mind when choosing the function in relation to the type of public good to be studied.
