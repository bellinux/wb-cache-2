5|$|In 1973, Kennedy's 12-year-old son Edward Kennedy, Jr., was {{diagnosed}} with bone cancer; his leg was amputated and he underwent a long, difficult, experimental two-year drug treatment. The case brought international attention both among doctors and in the general media, as did the young Kennedy's return to the ski slopes half a year later. Son Patrick was suffering from severe asthma attacks. The pressure of the situation mounted on Joan Kennedy, who several times entered facilities for alcoholism and emotional strain and was arrested for <b>drunk</b> <b>driving</b> after a traffic accident.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to granting local governments wide latitude over liquor sales, New Jersey law has some other unusual features. Corporations {{are limited to}} two retail distribution licenses, making it impractical for chain stores to sell alcoholic beverages; this restriction, in conjunction with municipal ordinances, severely limits supermarket and convenience store chains from selling beer {{as they do in}} many other states. State law treats <b>drunk</b> <b>driving</b> as a traffic offense rather than a crime, and permits individual municipalities to define the scope of underage drinking laws.|$|E

5|$|Because DUI in New Jersey is a non-criminal traffic violation, state DUI {{laws are}} not subject to the Assimilative Crimes Act. Members of the Armed Forces can be court martialed for <b>drunk</b> <b>driving,</b> {{military}} bases can enforce New Jersey traffic law on civilians, and it is a misdemeanor under federal law to drive while intoxicated on land administered by the National Park Service, the Department of Veterans Affairs, or the Postal Service. Similar to New Jersey, federal DUI statutes prohibit the operation of a motor vehicle while having a BAC of 0.08% or greater, and require a driver to give a breath sample if requested by a law enforcement authority.|$|E
5|$|Federal DUI law {{differs from}} New Jersey law {{in that there}} are no {{mandatory}} minimum jail sentences, irrespective of the number of previous DUI convictions, and plea bargaining is allowed. A federal DUI conviction will result in unexpungeable criminal record. Federal courts cannot suspend a driver's license, but may notify the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission of a DUI conviction. In federal enclaves that are under the jurisdiction of other federal departments (e.g. Fish and Wildlife Service), it is unclear if <b>drunk</b> <b>driving</b> could be prosecuted since the Assimilative Crimes Act is inapplicable, and there is no federal law defining DUI on those properties.|$|E
5|$|New Jersey prohibits plea {{bargaining}} in DUI cases unless the prosecutor {{believes there is}} insufficient evidence to prove the case, and New Jersey does not offer hardship (work) licenses for people convicted of DUI. Because DUI is not a criminal offense in New Jersey, defendants are ineligible for pretrial intervention (PTI) and other diversion programs. A previous DUI conviction, in New Jersey or another state, cannot be used to disqualify a person from such programs, and those charged with an indictable offense stemming from <b>drunk</b> <b>driving</b> (e.g. cases involving serious injuries or eluding arrest) are eligible for PTI. A person convicted of DUI is barred from recovering accident-related damages from other drivers, but {{may be able to}} sue the business or person who served them alcoholic beverages.|$|E

50|$|The {{validity}} of this result does, however, hinge on the {{validity of}} the initial assumption that the police officer stopped the driver truly at random, and not because of bad driving. If that or another non-arbitrary reason for stopping the driver was present, then the calculation also involves the probability of a <b>drunk</b> driver <b>driving</b> competently and a non-drunk driver driving (in-)competently.|$|R
5|$|While {{the courts}} in New Jersey allow actions based on dram shop {{liability}} or social host liability, they will instruct a jury to consider the intoxicated person's negligence under the doctrine of comparative negligence. Licensed establishments and social hosts may be liable for <b>drunk</b> <b>driving</b> accidents, assaults, falls, and other injuries and property damage caused by a customer, but are not liable for behavior which is unforeseeable (e.g. falling out of a tree), nor are they liable if they only served food or non-alcoholic beverages to a drunk patron. Dram shop and social host litigation may involve both compensatory and punitive damages. There is a 2-year statute of limitations for such lawsuits, but the time limit may be extended if the victim is a juvenile.|$|E

Russo is picked up from jail by his secretary and romantic partner, Christina Gallagher (Kristen Connolly). He lies to her, telling her that he was alone when he was arrested when, in fact, there was a prostitute (Rachel Brosnahan) in the car.|$|E
5|$|The social {{problems}} arising from alcoholism are serious, {{caused by the}} pathological changes {{in the brain and}} the intoxicating effects of alcohol. Alcohol abuse is associated with an increased risk of committing criminal offences, including child abuse, domestic violence, rape, burglary and assault. Alcoholism is associated with loss of employment, which can lead to financial problems. Drinking at inappropriate times, and behavior caused by reduced judgment, can lead to legal consequences, such as criminal charges for <b>drunk</b> <b>driving</b> or public disorder, or civil penalties for tortious behavior, and may lead to a criminal sentence. An alcoholic's behavior and mental impairment, while drunk, can profoundly affect those surrounding them and lead to isolation from family and friends. This isolation can lead to marital conflict and divorce, or contribute to domestic violence. Alcoholism can also lead to child neglect, with subsequent lasting damage to the emotional development of the alcoholic's children. For this reason, children of alcoholic parents can develop a number of emotional problems. For example, they can become afraid of their parents, because of their unstable mood behaviors. In addition, they can develop considerable amount of shame over their inadequacy to liberate their parents from alcoholism. As a result of this failure, they develop wretched self-images, which can lead to depression.|$|E

5|$|The various health {{problems}} associated with long-term alcohol consumption are generally perceived as detrimental to society, for example, money due to lost labor-hours, medical costs due to injuries due to drunkenness and organ damage from long-term use, and secondary treatment costs, such as the costs of rehabilitation facilities and detoxification centers. Alcohol use is a major contributing factor for head injuries, motor vehicle accidents (due to <b>drunk</b> <b>driving),</b> domestic violence, and assaults. Beyond the financial costs that alcohol consumption imposes, there are also significant social costs to both the alcoholic and their family and friends. For instance, alcohol consumption by a pregnant woman can lead to fetal alcohol syndrome, an incurable and damaging condition. Estimates of the economic costs of alcohol abuse, collected by the World Health Organization, vary from one to six percent of a country's GDP. One Australian estimate pegged alcohol's social costs at 24% of all drug abuse costs; a similar Canadian study concluded alcohol's share was 41%. One study quantified {{the cost to the}} UK of all forms of alcohol misuse in 2001 as £18.5–20 billion. All economic costs in the United States in 2006 have been estimated at $223.5 billion.|$|E
5|$|Beer {{contains}} ethyl alcohol, {{the same}} chemical that {{is present in}} wine and distilled spirits and as such, beer consumption has short-term psychological and physiological effects on the user. Different concentrations of alcohol {{in the human body}} have different effects on a person. The effects of alcohol depend on the amount an individual has drunk, the percentage of alcohol in the beer and the timespan over which the consumption took place, the amount of food eaten and whether an individual has taken other prescription, over-the-counter or street drugs, among other factors. Drinking enough to cause a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.03%-0.12% typically causes an overall improvement in mood and possible euphoria, increased self-confidence and sociability, decreased anxiety, a flushed, red appearance in the face and impaired judgment and fine muscle coordination. A BAC of 0.09% to 0.25% causes lethargy, sedation, balance problems and blurred vision. A BAC from 0.18% to 0.30% causes profound confusion, impaired speech (e.g., slurred speech), staggering, dizziness and vomiting. A BAC from 0.25% to 0.40% causes stupor, unconsciousness, anterograde amnesia, vomiting (death may occur due to inhalation of vomit (pulmonary aspiration) while unconscious) and respiratory depression (potentially life-threatening). A BAC from 0.35% to 0.80% causes a coma (unconsciousness), life-threatening respiratory depression and possibly fatal alcohol poisoning. As with all alcoholic drinks, drinking while driving, operating an aircraft or heavy machinery increases the risk of an accident; many countries have severe criminal penalties against <b>drunk</b> <b>driving.</b>|$|E
5|$|As expected, Ezeh, who had {{suffered}} a shoulder injury, redshirted his freshman year. Prior to his redshirt freshman season, he changed jersey numbers from 44 to 45 as he converted from fullback to linebacker. On May 22, 2007, {{he was charged with}} suspicion of operating a vehicle while intoxicated for an incident when his vehicle struck a utility pole on the same street on which he lives while his blood-alcohol content was 0.11% (the legal limit in Michigan is 0.08%). Ezeh pleaded not guilty, and the trial was scheduled for September 19 in the 15th District Court. The time of the accident was outside the permissible times for Ezeh's restricted driving license that resulted from a prior non-alcohol-related accident. On the football field, redshirt freshman Ezeh entered the 2007 NCAA Division I FBS football season for the 2007 Michigan Wolverines football team in a three-way battle to replace NFL-bound David Harris at middle linebacker with redshirt junior John Thompson and junior college transfer Austin Panter, who had been named national junior college defensive player of the year. Harris also hailed from Grand Rapids and had worn the number 45. The week before the season opener, The Detroit News declared Ezeh the starter, however, the Ann Arbor News and Ezeh's hometown The Grand Rapids Press both stated that the race between Ezeh and Thompson was undecided heading into the game. In the aftermath of the September 1, opening game loss to two-time defending FCS champion Appalachian State Mountaineers, more was made of the fact that both players had trouble playing the position than who had started the game. Ezeh started the first game, but lost his spot to Thompson in the next two. After three weeks of play, Thompson, who had been voted the hardest hitter on the team the previous two seasons, had established himself as the starter by ranking second on the team in tackles. However, although Thompson had stepped up to the role he was notable for having trouble with pass coverage. Ezeh accumulated no statistics in the third and fourth game, but recorded his first interception in the fifth game on September 29 against Northwestern on a deflected pass. Ezeh started that game because of an injury. The following week, he again started in place of the injured Thompson and recorded nine tackles against Eastern Michigan. He also forced a fumble and fielded one kickoff return. Even though Thompson recovered from his ankle injury after four weeks, Ezeh retained the starting job the remainder of the season for a total of ten starts. Thompson only recorded four tackles the rest of the year. On November 1, his lawyer stated that on August 29 Ezeh had pleaded guilty to an operating while visibly intoxicated charge, which is a serious misdemeanor but a lesser charge than the original operating a vehicle while intoxicated, and had sought alcohol counseling prior to his sentence. The plea resulted in a year's probation, three days in a work release program, a substantial payment covering fines, court costs and restitution. He committed to attend a Mothers Against <b>Drunk</b> <b>Driving</b> class. In the November 3 Paul Bunyan Trophy victory against Michigan State he recorded a season-high 13 tackles and two sacks. One of the sacks occurred on Michigan State's final series of downs in Michigan territory to help secure the 2824 win. Ezeh recorded 12 tackles in the Michigan – Ohio State rivalry game against Ohio State on November 17 to end the regular season.|$|E

40|$|The overall aim of {{the study}} was to examine relapse among {{participants}} in the DWI Prevention Programme and those who get prison sentence after driving when influenced by alcohol and to examine the participants’ attitudes towards <b>drunk</b> – <b>driving,</b> risk behavior and traffic safety. A direct evaluation of the sentence and penal accomplishment is also examined. The sample of the survey study (see article 1) was 44 from the DWI – sample and 44 from the prison – sample that completed a questionnaire answering about their attitudes towards <b>drunk</b> – <b>driving,</b> risk behavior and traffic safety. The results presented in article 2 are based on transcripts of criminal convicts that participated in the DWI Prevention Programme during the period of 1998 – 2002 in the Salten District (n = 68) and a sample of convicts to an unconditional sentence for <b>drunk</b> - <b>driving</b> in the same time periode (n = 112). The 1 st analysis revealed that the DWI – sample had more ideal attitudes towards <b>drunk</b> – <b>driving,</b> risk behavior and traffic safety. There were also significant differences in how they evaluated their sentence and penal accomplishment. The DWI - sample were generally more satisfied with the penal accomplishment, the way they was treated and how the relationships around them were. They were also more satisfied with the contents of the penal accomplishment. Multivariate analysis, Kaplan – Meier and Cox regression was used in the 2 nd analysis calculating if there were significant differences between the samples, survival time and to investigate effects of several variables upon the time a specified event takes to happen. In this study the relapse time was shorter for men than for women and the youngest age – groups had a shorter relapse time than the oldest age – groups. The Kaplan – Meier plot revealed that the prison – group have a shorter relapse time compared to the DWI – group. Based on the results of the two articles we can conclude that the DWI Prevention Programme had a very good effect on the participants compared to those who get traditional prison – sentence. The participants in the programme had the most ideal attitudes and the longest survival time after participating. When it comes to survival time among gender and age, women and the older age – groups had the longest survival time. </p...|$|R
