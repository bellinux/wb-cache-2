It is shown that the method is in principle capable of yielding He 4 which is entirely devoid of He 3 isotopic impurities. A secondary <b>heat</b> <b>flush,</b> operated in conjunction with a conical heat exchanger of novel design, was used to place an experimental lower bound of 2 × 1015 on the ratio of the product, a standard sufficient for all present or projected applications requiring isotopically pure He 4.

40|$|Night purge {{ventilation}} is {{an effective}} technique for passive cooling, which is typically used in office buildings {{with the aim of}} reducing the daytime temperature, and thereby reducing the cooling load of HVAC systems. This method uses the cool of the night to release the warmth stored in the thermal mass during the day. That is, this system optimizes the energy storage properties of thermal masses to provide thermal comfort in interior spaces. The {{purpose of this study is}} to determine the impact of the use of night purge ventilation in conjunction with PCMs on the indoor thermal conditions of a typical office building located in hot-arid climates. In this article, the impacts of optimal night ventilation on the <b>heat</b> <b>flushing</b> operation, inside room temperature and element thermal conditions are all evaluated. It was found that combining PCMs with night ventilation will significantly improve indoor thermal conditions; however, results vary for different days in general and different structural elements in particular.

40|$|Aims: Investigate {{subjective}} health complaints (SHC) {{in chronic}} whiplash associated disorder (WAD, grade I & II) patients, {{and to identify}} physical, psychological, and collision associated factors that might be associated {{with high levels of}} comorbidity. Method: During the years 2000 - 2002 171 chronic WAD patients filled in questionnaires and underwent physical examination. The prevalence of SHC was recorded and compared with a representative sample of the Norwegian population (n= 1014). Results: The chronic WAD patients reported higher number of subjective health complaints (median: 9) than the general population (median: 5). They showed significantly higher risk of reporting all musculoskeletal complaints, palpitation, <b>heat</b> <b>flushes,</b> sleep problems, tiredness, dizziness, anxiety, depression, breathing difficulties, chest pain, coughing, heartburn, gas discomfort, and obstipation. The patients with the highest level of comorbid subjective health complaints also reported more function loss, reading difficulties, poorer quality of life, higher psychological distress, higher use of medication, and less optimism about their situation. There were no differences however, in any collision factors or physical meassures recorded by physiotherapists between the high, medium and low comorbidity groups. Conclusion: The high comorbidity of other complaints, the strong relationships between degree of comorbidity and psychological factors, and the lack of relationships between degree of comorbidity and collision factors and physical tests, suggest that chronic WAD is best understood as a syndrome and not simply as a neck injury.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that laminar-turbulent {{boundary}} layer transition is initiated by the formation of Tollmien-Schlichting laminar instability waves. The amplification rates of these waves are strongly dependent on the shape of the boundary layer velocity profile. Consequently, the transition process can be controlled by modifying the velocity profile. This can be accomplished by controlling the pressure gradient (dp/dx), using boundary layer suction, installing surface roughness elements, or by surface heating or cooling. Methods used to modify the transition process through changes in the mean velocity profile are called "passive" in this paper. There exists a large set of experiments and theory on the application of passive methods for boundary layer control. In the present work only surface heating will be addressed. Transition measurements were made on a heated flat plate in water. Results are presented for several plate wall temperature distributions. An increase by a factor of 2. 5 in transition Reynolds number was observed for a 5 °C isothermal wall overheat. Buoyancy effects on transition were minimal due to the small Richardson and Grashof numbers encountered in the experiments. The amplification of laminar instability waves is comparatively to process, taking place over many boundary layer thicknesses. After the slow amplification of the laminar instability waves, transition occurs by a strong three dimensional dynamic instability. It appears possible to attenuate (or reinforce) the instability waves by introducing amplitude-and phase-controlled perturbations into the laminar boundary layer using feedback control system. This method is called "active" control and forms the larger part of the research reported in this thesis. A combination of sensors, activators and feedback control electronics is required for active control. The sensors used in the experiments are flush-mounted hot film wall shear robes. A new type of activator was developed using thin, flush-mounted surface heating elements to excite instability waves in the laminar boundary layer by periodic (active) heating. Experimental evidence is presented illustrating the effects of periodically <b>heated</b> <b>flush</b> mounted strips in perturbing a flat plate boundary layer in water. The results of superposition of forced laminar instability waves are also given. Finally, an active feedback-control system using a single hot film probe and strip heater was developed to control natural laminar instability waves in real time. It is shown that when the natural waves were attenuated, the transition length was increased by 25 %, requiring only 10 watts of strip heater power. To accomplish the same transition delay using passive heating, the internal heating pads had to supply 1900 watts of power...|$|R

Since, the heat transfer and the fluid flow decouple, a numerical model of the heat transfer of a cylindrical catheter (with heating element) sitting concentrically within a rigid cylindrical artery is developed.

40|$|International audienceWe have {{examined}} the non-equilibrium effects of core-cooling and time-dependent internal-heating on the thermal evolution of the Earth's mantle and on mantle flush events caused by the two major phase transitions. Both two- and three-dimensional models have been employed. The mantle viscosity responds to the secular cooling through changes in the averaged temperature field. A viscosity which decreases algebraically with the average temperature has been considered. The time-dependent internal-heating is prescribed to decrease exponentially with a single decay time. We have studied the thermal histories with initial Rayleigh numbers between 2 x 10 7 and 10 8. Flush events, driven by the non-equilibrium forcings, are much more dramatic than those produced by the equilibrium boundary conditions and constant internal <b>heating.</b> Multiple <b>flush</b> events are found under non-equilibrium conditions {{in which there is}} very little internal heating or very fast decay rates of internal-heating. Otherwise, the flush events take place in a relatively continuous fashion. Prior to massive flush events small-scale percolative structures appear in the 3 D temperature fields. Time-dependent signatures, such as the surface heat flux, also exhibits high frequency oscillatory patterns prior to massive flush events. These two observations suggest that the flush event may be a self-organized critical phenomenon. The Nusselt number {{as a function of the}} time-varying Ra does not follow the Nusselt vs. Rayleigh number power-law relationship based on equilibrium (constant temperature) boundary conditions. Instead Nu(t) may vary non-monotonically with time because of the mantle flush events.

It is a heterogeneous disorder affecting approximately 1 % of women < 40 years, 1 : 10, 000 women by age 20 and 1 : 1, 000 women by age 30. The most severe forms present with absent pubertal development and primary amenorrhea (50 % of these cases due to ovarian dysgenesis), whereas forms with post-pubertal onset are characterized by disappearance of menstrual cycles (secondary amenorrhea) associated with premature follicular depletion. As in the case of physiological menopause, POF presents by typical manifestations of climacterium: infertility associated with palpitations, <b>heat</b> intolerance, <b>flushes,</b> anxiety, depression, fatigue. POF is biochemically characterized by low levels of gonadal hormones (estrogens and inhibins) and high levels of gonadotropins (LH and FSH) (hypergonadotropic amenorrhea). Beyond infertility, hormone defects may cause severe neurological, metabolic or cardiovascular consequences and lead to the early onset of osteoporosis. Heterogeneity of POF is also reflected by the variety of possible causes, including autoimmunity, toxics, drugs, as well as genetic defects. POF has a strong genetic component.
