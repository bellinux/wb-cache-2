2500|$|Since {{they have}} very sharp and {{numerous}} teeth, care is required in unhooking a pike. Barbless trebles are recommended when angling for this species, as they simplify unhooking.

It should be {{kept out of the}} water for the minimum amount of time possible, and should be given extra time to recover if being weighed and photographed before release. If practicing live release, calling the fish [...] "caught" [...] when it is alongside a boat is recommended. Remove the hook by grabbing it with needle-nosed pliers while the fish is still submerged and giving it a flip in the direction that turns the hook out of the mouth. This avoids damage to the fish and the stress of being out of water.|$|E
