25|$|In {{spite of}} the {{historically}} few researchers studying limb regeneration, remarkable {{progress has been made}} recently in establishing the neotenous amphibian the axolotl (Ambystoma mexicanum) as a model genetic organism. This progress has been facilitated by advances in genomics, bioinformatics, and somatic cell transgenesis in other fields, that have created the opportunity to investigate the mechanisms of important biological properties, such as limb regeneration, in the axolotl. The Ambystoma Genetic Stock Center (AGSC) is a self-sustaining, breeding colony of the axolotl supported by the National Science Foundation as a Living Stock Collection. Located at the University of Kentucky, the AGSC is dedicated to supplying genetically well-characterized axolotl embryos, larvae, and adults to laboratories throughout the United States and abroad. An NIH-funded NCRR grant has led to the establishment of the Ambystoma EST database, the Salamander Genome Project (SGP) that has {{led to the creation of}} the first amphibian <b>gene</b> <b>map</b> and several annotated molecular data bases, and the creation of the research community web portal.|$|E
2500|$|GenMAPP (<b>Gene</b> <b>Map</b> Annotator and Pathway Profiler) is a free, {{open-source}} bioinformatics {{software tool}} designed to visualize and analyze genomic {{data in the}} context of pathways (metabolic, signaling), connecting gene-level datasets to biological processes and disease. First created in 2000, GenMAPP is developed by an open-source team based in an academic research laboratory. GenMAPP maintains databases of gene identifiers and collections of pathway maps in addition to visualization and analysis tools. [...] Together with other public resources, GenMAPP aims to provide the research community with tools to gain insight into biology through the integration of data types ranging from genes to proteins to pathways to disease.|$|E
40|$|Localization {{of disease}} {{susceptibility}} genes to certain {{areas in the}} human genome, or <b>gene</b> <b>mapping,</b> requires careful analysis of genetic marker data. <b>Gene</b> <b>mapping</b> is often carried out using a sample of individuals affected by the disease of interest and a sample of healthy controls. From a data mining perspective, <b>gene</b> <b>mapping</b> can then be cast as a pattern discov-ery and analysis task: which genetically motivated marker patterns help to separate affected individuals from healthy ones? The marker data constitutes haplotypes: a haplotype is a string of genetic markers from one chromosome. Individuals who share a common ancestor, {{such as those that}} have inherited the disease gene from this individual, potentially share a substring in their haplotypes. Classi-fication or association analysis of haplotypes is thus one approach to <b>gene</b> <b>mapping.</b> Further, analyzing the similarities of haplotypes and clustering them can provide insight to genetic rela-tionships of individuals, to different mutations, and thus to the genetic etiology of the disease. We describe and illustrate data mining approaches to <b>gene</b> <b>mapping</b> using haplotypes: as-sociation analysis, similarity analysis, and clustering. The association-based <b>gene</b> <b>mapping</b> methods have been found to perform well and are being routinely applied in <b>gene</b> <b>mapping</b> projects...|$|R

Semi-parametric <b>gene</b> <b>mapping</b> using the exponential tilt covers most standard exponential families and improves estimation of genetic effects.

40|$|The {{locations}} of the larval serum protein one (LSP- 1) α, β and γ genes were determined in Drosophila melanogaster and in 14 other species of Drosophila by in situ hybridization to polytene chromosomes. The LSP- 1 α <b>gene</b> <b>mapped</b> to bands 11 B on the X chromosome, the LSP- 1 β <b>gene</b> <b>mapped</b> to bands 21 D-E on chromosome 2 L, and the LSP- 1 γ <b>gene</b> <b>mapped</b> to band 61 A in all the melanogaster subgroup species.

No hybridization of LSP- 1 γ was detected in these eight species. Restriction enzyme digestion and analysis of genomic DNA by filter transfer hybridization confirmed the presence of LSP- 1 α-like and β-like genes in seven of these species.

40|$|Abstract Background Evolutionary {{divergence}} in {{the position}} of the translational start site among orthologous genes can have significant functional impacts. Divergence can alter the translation rate, degradation rate, subcellular location, and function of the encoded proteins. Results Existing Genbank <b>gene</b> <b>maps</b> for Burkholderia genomes suggest that extensive divergence has occurred [...] 53 % of ortholog sets based on Genbank <b>gene</b> <b>maps</b> had inconsistent <b>gene</b> start sites. However, most of these inconsistencies appear to be gene-calling errors. Evolutionary divergence was the most plausible explanation for only 17 % of the ortholog sets. Correcting probable errors in the Genbank <b>gene</b> <b>maps</b> decreased the percentage of ortholog sets with inconsistent starts by 68 %, increased the percentage of ortholog sets with extractable upstream intergenic regions by 32 %, increased the sequence similarity of intergenic regions and predicted proteins, and increased the number of proteins with identifiable signal peptides. Conclusions Our findings highlight an emerging problem in comparative genomics: single-digit percent errors in gene predictions can lead to double-digit percentages of inconsistent ortholog sets. The work demonstrates a simple approach to evaluate and improve the quality of <b>gene</b> <b>maps.</b> </p...|$|R
40|$|Genetic {{mapping of}} {{quantitative}} traits attempts to determine {{locations in the}} genome contributing to quanti-tative traits, e. g., blood pressure, serum cholesterol, serum insulin, and if possible any gene-gene and gene-environment interactions that may be involved. Because inheritance involves a random selection of genetic materials that is passed down to each succeeding generation, <b>gene</b> <b>mapping</b> necessary involves statistical analysis of genetic data. Controlled breeding experiments play a considerable role in simplifying the prob-lem of <b>gene</b> <b>mapping</b> in plants and animals, but <b>gene</b> <b>mapping</b> in humans involves special complications because of one’s inability to perform suitable breeding experiments. There are two general approaches to <b>gene</b> <b>mapping</b> in humans: linkage, {{which is based on}} (close) rela-tionships in families, and association, which is based on the (distant) relationships in populations. 2 Outcome of the Meeting The main outcome of the meeting was a paper giving a unified foundation to the statistical problem of map-ping quantitative traits by either family based or association based methods. This paper was published in Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. A second manuscript that builds on the foundation in the first paper and provide...|$|R
