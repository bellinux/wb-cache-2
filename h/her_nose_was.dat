While dealing cards at John Shanssey’s saloon, he met Mary Katharine [...] "Big Nose Kate" [...] Horony, a dance hall woman and occasional prostitute. <b>Her</b> <b>nose</b> <b>was</b> a prominent feature.

6000|$|Tommy {{brought down}} his eyes. [...] "Did you think {{as much of}} her as that?" [...] he said. [...] "It struck me that her {{features}} were not quite classic. <b>Her</b> <b>nose</b> <b>is</b> a little tilted, is it not?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She is {{not like}} our picture. Her eyes are not large and expressive; <b>her</b> <b>nose</b> <b>is</b> not straight, delicate, Hellenic; her mouth has not that charm I thought it had, which I {{imagined}} could beguile me of sullenness in my worst moods. What is she? A thread-paper, a doll, a toy, a girl, in short." ...|$|R
2500|$|Channing {{made her}} {{television}} debut on Sesame Street {{in the role}} of The Number Painter's female victim. She landed her first leading role in the 1973 television movie The Girl Most Likely to..., a black comedy written by Joan Rivers about an ugly duckling woman made newly beautiful by plastic surgery after an auto accident vows murderous revenge on all who had scorned her. For the role, Channing went through considerable transformation, with the syndicated column [...] "TV Scout" [...] reporting months later, [...] "It was a great make-up job — at least the part that made very pretty Stockard look so ugly. She had her cheeks puffed out with cotton and <b>her</b> <b>nose</b> <b>was</b> wadded, too, to make it thick and off-center. Very thick eyebrows were drawn on her face and she wore padded clothes to make her look fat. Making her look beautiful was easy." [...] The TV movie has gone on to enjoy cult status, becoming available on DVD in 2005.|$|E

50|$|As a Demoniac, Beatrice {{takes the}} form of an {{armoured}} female with blades instead of feet and a large net-like skirt made of energy. Only <b>her</b> <b>nose</b> <b>is</b> visible, as <b>her</b> entire head is covered and sports two large horns similar to Xargin's. While capable of both flight and powerful in melee combat, Beatrice can also blast high-strength beams of energy.|$|R

6000|$|... "You see," [...] {{said the}} Girl pathetically, [...] "the shadow {{of it has}} been over my whole life. Of course, when I was a very little girl I didn't mind it so much. It was such a long way off and lots of things might happen. The Creature might run away with some other girl--or I might have the smallpox--or Beatrix's <b>nose</b> might <b>be</b> {{straight}} when she grew up. And if Beatrix's <b>nose</b> <b>were</b> straight she'd be a great deal prettier than I am. But nothing did happen--and <b>her</b> <b>nose</b> <b>is</b> puggier than ever. Then when I grew up things were horrid. I never could have a single little bit of fun. And Beatrix had such a good time! She had scores of lovers in spite of <b>her</b> <b>nose.</b> To <b>be</b> sure, she's engaged now--and he's a horrid, faddy little creature. But he is her own choice. She wasn't told that there was a man in England whom she must marry by and by, when he got sufficiently reconciled to the idea to come and ask her. Oh, it makes me furious!" ...|$|R
60|$|The {{father and}} {{daughter}} were sitting at their breakfast. Tom had retired, and they were alone. Mr Pecksniff frowned at first; but having cleared his brow, looked stealthily at his child. <b>Her</b> <b>nose</b> <b>was</b> very red indeed, and screwed up tight, with hostile preparation.|$|E
60|$|Presently in sweeps Aunt Tommy, in {{an elegant}} dress, not a hair out of place. She looked {{perfectly}} sweet, only <b>her</b> <b>nose</b> <b>was</b> a little red. Dick looked at her for just a moment, then he stepped forward and took her right into his arms.|$|E
60|$|Peg's face on {{one side}} turned a deep magenta color, on the other a lighter cherry, while <b>her</b> <b>nose</b> <b>was</b> purple, and her {{forehead}} an Indian red.

50|$|Gradually Rafqa's {{left eye}} shrunk and {{sunk into the}} socket and she became blind. For about thirty years both sockets hemorrhaged {{two to three times}} a week. She also {{suffered}} from frequent nosebleeds. “Her head, her brow, <b>her</b> eyes, <b>her</b> <b>nose</b> <b>were</b> as if they were being pierced by a red hot needle. Rafqa did not let this pain isolate her from the community. She continued to spin wool and cotton and knitted stockings for the other sisters; she participated in choral prayer.|$|R

6000|$|... "But I know," [...] cried a seaman in the crowd. [...] "I was {{standing}} at the wharf-side and was nigh knocked into the water by a little red-headed fellow, who breathed as though he had run from the town. Ere I had time to give him a cuff he had jumped aboard, the ropes were cast off, and <b>her</b> <b>nose</b> <b>was</b> seaward." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Her</b> <b>nose</b> <b>was</b> {{not quite}} Grecian; {{had it been}} so, her face might have been fairer, but it would {{certainly}} have been less expressive. Nor could it be called retroussé, but it had the slightest possible tendency in that direction; and the nostrils were more open, more ready to breathe forth flashes of indignation than is ever the case with a truly Grecian nose.|$|E
60|$|And {{then she}} was alone with Mr. Bertram. <b>Her</b> <b>nose</b> <b>was</b> still blue, and her toes still cold; but at any rate she was alone with him.

The courage of women in some conditions of life surpasses anything that man can do.|$|E

60|$|Tabitha {{took the}} {{parchment}} {{and held it}} close to <b>her</b> <b>nose,</b> which <b>was</b> saddled {{with a pair of}} iron-bound spectacles. But no sooner had she began to puzzle over it than she burst into a chuckling laugh, holding both her hands against her sides.|$|R
6000|$|Some {{eyes were}} discourteously {{turned on the}} maiden, but she hardly saw them, and at any rate <b>her</b> <b>nose</b> <b>was</b> not crooked, nor had her eyes and mouth changed places, {{as in the case}} of the [...] "Loathly Lady."

60|$|The {{next day}} Winifred, {{in a dress}} of silvery velvet, and holding a gaudy bunch of flowers in her hand, waited with keen impatience in the schoolroom, looking down the drive for Gudrun's arrival. It was a wet morning. Under <b>her</b> <b>nose</b> <b>was</b> the strange {{fragrance}} of hot-house flowers, the bunch was like a little fire to her, {{she seemed to have}} a strange new fire in her heart. This slight sense of romance stirred her like an intoxicant.|$|E
60|$|A girl {{came out}} on the veranda. She was a {{handsome}} girl, smartly dressed in white, with a fashionable hat that had a tall plume. Her hair and eyes were black, the latter marked by a rather hard sparkle; <b>her</b> <b>nose</b> <b>was</b> prominent and her mouth firm. Her face was colorless, but her skin had the clean smoothness of silk. She had a firmly lined, round figure, and her manner was easy and confident. Sadie Keller was then twenty-one years of age.|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly, Miss," [...] said Bill, with alacrity, {{holding his}} great arm {{within an inch}} of <b>her</b> <b>nose.</b> It <b>was</b> covered with various tattoos: flags, ships, and what not, in the middle of which, written in small letters {{along the side of the}} forearm, was the sailor's name--Bill Jones.|$|R
60|$|The {{young lady}} driving her car had half {{turned her face}} to listen; {{and it was not}} a reverent or a patient face that she showed him. <b>Her</b> Norman <b>nose</b> <b>was</b> tilted a trifle too high upon the slim stalk of her neck and body.|$|R
60|$|This day he {{came upon}} {{a woman and her}} child farther down stream than usual. The former was searching for a species of {{shellfish}} which was {{to be found in the}} mud close to the river bank. She was a young black woman of about thirty. Her teeth were filed to sharp points, for her people ate the flesh of man. Her under lip was slit that it might support a rude pendant of copper which she had worn for so many years that the lip had been dragged downward to prodigious lengths, exposing the teeth and gums of her lower jaw. <b>Her</b> <b>nose,</b> too, <b>was</b> slit, and through the slit was a wooden skewer. Metal ornaments dangled from her ears, and upon her forehead and cheeks; upon her chin and the bridge of <b>her</b> <b>nose</b> <b>were</b> tattooings in colors that were mellowed now by age. She was naked except for a girdle of grasses about her waist. Altogether she was very beautiful in her own estimation and even in the estimation of the men of Mbonga's tribe, though she was of another people--a trophy of war seized in her maidenhood by one of Mbonga's fighting men.|$|R
