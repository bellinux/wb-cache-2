Because {{of the increasing}} scarcity of ramin wood, the Perupuk wood had gained {{the benefit of the}} situation as indicated by increasing demand and price of Perupuk wood. The technical and economic studies on Perupuk wood (Lophopetalum. spp) utilization wascarried out at one wood working mill in Gresik, East Java in 1994. The objectives of the study were to identify kind of products resulted from Perupuk utilization, recovery level of each product, productivity and efficiency ofperupuk wood working machineries, and its value added. The study showed that kind of products resulted from Perupuk utilization were moulding,smooth-four-side (S 4 S), finger jointed stick, solid jointed board and finger jointed board. The average recovery of Perupuk utilization was 55 % and the highest recovery (65. 60 %) was obtained by smooth-four-side product. The <b>double</b> <b>planer</b> machine had the highest productivity because all products used the machine to get the standard dimensions. The efficiency of some Perupuk wood working machineries still low.

The test to identify these two mechanisms is usually performed on a stereograph based on the orientation of the two discontinuities, their line of intersection and the slope face. An alternative stereographic method involves identifying the great circle, known as a π-circle, linking the discontinuity poles and comparing this plane with the slope face orientation. A kinematically feasible wedge is <b>double</b> <b>plane</b> sliding unless the following two criteria are met. 1) One of the poles is within the daylight envelope for the slope face and 2) that pole lies between the dip direction of the π-circle and the direction opposite to the slope direction of the excavation face.

40|$|Inappropriate {{positioning}} of interstitial Iridium 192 implants, used as booster dose {{in the breast}} conserving treatment of mammary cancer, may cause disturbing teleangiectasia of the breast skin, when high radiation doses are delivered on the dermal blood vessels. Based on the localization of the vascular plexuses in human breast skin, and on the dose distribution around different types of interstitial implants, a method is described to avoid overlap between the high dose area of the implant and the {{blood vessels in the}} skin. The latter are demonstrated to run within the first 5 mm under the epiderm. For source lengths varying from 5 to 8 cm, simple mathematical relations exist between the maximal security margin (MSM) and intersource distance (E) for single plane implants (MSM = 0. 4 (E + 1)), <b>double</b> <b>plane</b> square implants (MSM = 0. 4 E) and <b>double</b> <b>plane</b> triangular implants (MSM = 0. 4 (E - 1)).
