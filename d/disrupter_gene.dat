An additional 15 lines that did not have embryonic GFP+ hematopoietic tissue by microscopy, nevertheless exhibited GFP+ cells in young adults.

This new method utilizes uses {{a combination of}} linear transformations, facilitated by λ-RED recombination and gene duplications facilitated by P 22 transductions. A partial lac operon containing lacZ (nt 1 - 500), a kanamycin resistance cassette, and lacA (nt 579 - 614) was used to <b>disrupt</b> a <b>gene</b> of interest, facilitated by RED recombinase. P 22 phage grown on a strain of S. typhimurium containing a MudA transposon, which includes an intact lac operon fused to a gene located upstream of the gene of interest was used to transduce, the <b>disrupted</b> <b>gene,</b> resulting in duplication of the <b>disrupted</b> <b>gene</b> and complementation of the lac operon. This duplication fuses an intact lac operon to the promoter of interest, and once carried into the wild-type background, maintains the wild-type gene of interest to monitor any self-regulatory activity. This new method was tested by fusing the lacZ gene to the promoter of the putative osmotic stress ABC glycine-betaine/choline-O-sulfate transporter OsmU. The expression of OsmU was monitored during osmotic shock and {{in the presence of}} the osmoprotectants, glycine-betaine, and choline-O-sulfate.
