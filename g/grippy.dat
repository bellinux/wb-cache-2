Many modern tires are available with treads in a variety or combination of colors. Road racing tires with different tread compounds for the front and rear have been developed, thereby attempting to provide more traction in front and less rolling resistance in the rear.|$|R

50|$|On motorcycles, {{a similar}} level of fail-safety is {{provided}} by simpler methods; firstly {{the front and rear}} brake systems being entirely separate, regardless of their method of activation (that can be cable, rod or hydraulic), allowing one to fail entirely whilst leaving the other unaffected. Secondly, the rear brake is relatively strong compared to its automotive cousin, even being a powerful disc on sports models, even though the usual intent is for the front system to provide the vast majority of braking force; as the overall vehicle weight is more central, the rear tyre is generally larger and <b>grippier,</b> and the rider can lean back to put more weight on it, therefore allowing more brake force to be applied before the wheel locks up. On cheaper, slower utility-class machines, even if the front wheel should use a hydraulic disc for extra brake force and easier packaging, the rear will usually be a primitive, somewhat inefficient, but exceptionally robust rod-actuated drum, thanks to the ease of connecting the footpedal to the wheel in this way and, more importantly, the near impossibility of catastrophic failure even if the rest of the machine, like a lot of low-priced bikes after their first few years of use, is on the point of collapse from neglected maintenance.|$|R
5000|$|After {{capturing}} {{the two world}} championships it competed in, Mercedes withdrew from motorsport {{at the end of}} the 1955 season. Despite its strong reliability and good track performance, drivers Fangio and Moss described the car in MotorSport magazine as being [...] "a bit difficult to drive, with a tendency for snap oversteer". Moss also later said that [...] "I'm surprised that the Merc wasn't a little bit easier to drive, because it wasn't. It was a driver's car, but not an easy car to drive." [...] Fangio shared similar feelings, also saying in MotorSport Magazine in 1979 that the car was [...] "not so nice to drive as a Maserati 250F, but you were almost sure to finish. So the Mercedes was incredible in that way." [...] 1970s/80s Formula One driver John Watson drove the W196 at Hockenheim, providing some insight as to why the car was difficult to drive. He said that [...] "if you gave this car wider and <b>grippier</b> tyres and altered the suspension to suit, then the handling would be of a very high order indeed." [...] The W196 was so advanced and ahead of its time, that the narrow tyres available at the time simply could not fully handle the car's exceptional performance.|$|R
50|$|The {{first session}} begun with Force India driver Paul di Resta posting the first timed lap of the session. Other drivers {{followed}} soon after; {{all on the}} harder medium 'prime' tyre. The difference between the medium and the soft compounds was predicted around 0.8 seconds per lap. Leaving their run late, eight minutes into the session both the Red Bull and Mercedes cars had yet to post timed laps. Sebastian Vettel's engineer was heard saying that the lap time he did of 1:36.9 would {{be good enough to}} make Q2, subsequently it was the 15th best time of the session. With Felipe Massa in 16th after his run on the prime tyre, he {{was among the first to}} switch to the <b>grippier</b> soft compound 'option' tyre. His teammate Fernando Alonso followed suit soon after. Surprisingly Jenson Button undertook a lap on the soft tyres during Q1 even though looking like comfortably progressing to Q2. At the end of the session, Jean-Éric Vergne, for the second consecutive race, failed to make Q2 and was 18th ahead of the usual eliminated cars. In fact, all the eliminated cars in Q1 were in identical positions from the Malaysian Q1 qualifying session. Caterham's Heikki Kovalainen led teammate Vitaly Petrov and Timo Glock led the Marussias, while at the rear were the HRTs of Pedro de la Rosa and Narain Karthikeyan.|$|R

5000|$|Breeches with <b>grippy</b> {{material}} from the knee, up the inner thigh, and across the buttocks.

50|$|The Yamaha RX100 was {{launched}} in the mid 80's in India, and was produced until 1996. With the failure of Yamaha RD350 {{and the success of}} Ind-Suzuki's AX-100 in the market and masses, Yamaha realized the potential of Smaller Displacement Bikes in India. The RX-100 {{was launched}} in India in late 1985 shortly after the Ind-Suzuki AX-100 and Hero Honda CD-100 were launched. Kawasaki launched KB-100 a little later, in early 1986. It {{was one of the most}} reliable and peppiest smaller displacement bikes of the time. It gave tough competition to almost all bikes of that time. Many could not believe that a 100 cc engine, as claimed by the manufacturers, could deliver such raw power; people actually spread the rumor that it had a much bigger engine. It was also said that many race conductors and authorities double checked by opening the engine block to make sure it was actually 100 CC. This mean machine was used in many chain snatching and robbery incidents by some antisocial elements, which led to the banning of this bike by the state governments of Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand. Racers recognized the potential of RX's on dirt & drag Races. Various modifications like expansion chambers, porting, tuning, sprocketing, wheel sizes(16", 17", 18") and upgrades like bigger carburettors, air filters, quick throttle, disc brakes, 5th gear, race pistons, racing CDI systems, <b>grippier</b> tyres and suspension dampening were done to extract the maximum potential out of the bike in races.|$|R
50|$|The current Assen {{race track}} {{was built in}} 1955, and {{initially}} had a length of 7705 m. The current track has a length of 4555 m with the mixture of super fast flat-out and slow corners. The longest straight is 560 m. The curves in Assen were traditionally banked and the surface is extremely <b>grippy,</b> so the riders were able to drive much faster on the course than other circuits. Today these sloped or curved bends have been modified due to safety issues.|$|E
50|$|The bradoon rein {{should be}} {{wider than the}} rein used on the curb bit and in sport horse {{disciplines}} is often a bit more <b>grippy</b> (laced or, less often, rubber reins are popular), while the curb rein is thinner and smooth.

The extra grip provided by the snaffle rein also helps prevent the horse from pulling it through the rider's hands, which would make the curb rein shorter in comparison and encourage the rider to over-use the curb rein.|$|E
5000|$|On its {{original}} publication in Australia The Brisbane Courier noted [...] "One may always bid {{welcome to the}} rattling poems of [...] "Banjo" [...] Paterson, for they have in them an irresistible swing, they are singularly <b>grippy</b> in descriptiveness, and they are racy of the soil.

5000|$|Power levels {{approaching}} [...] {{combined with}} a racing weight of only 510 to 530 kg, provide a power-to-weight ratio similar to a V8 Supercar. This allows AF2 cars to accelerate very quickly out of corners and to develop some reasonable top speeds. The approximate 0 to 160 km/h time for an AF2 is 5 seconds. Because the cars are so low, and light and because they have <b>grippy</b> slick tyres and front and rear wings {{to force them to}} the ground, the cars are capable of generating very high G forces when cornering and braking.|$|E
5000|$|However, GameSpot's Kevin VanOrd {{gave the}} game a 5/10. He praised the {{attractive}} cars and race tracks featured, but criticized the soundtrack {{and the overall}} presentation of the game. He also praised the graphics of the game, but stated that {{the environment and the}} surroundings are [...] "as lifeless as postcards". Giant Bomb's Jeff Gerstmann gave the game a 2/5, praising its leaderboards, lighting and graphics, but criticizing the confusing menu, overly mechanical AI drivers, weirdly <b>grippy</b> car handling and lack of fun element. He summarized the game as [...] "a weird throwback to the old, dark days of console driving games".|$|E
5000|$|The album <b>Grippy</b> Grappa has {{received}} excellent reviews from international media {{such as the}} British newspaper The Guardian, the French magazine Les Inrockuptibles and the music magazine fRoots.

5000|$|At {{the start}} of a race it takes between one and two seconds for the {{motorcycle}} to reach the [...] "curve speed" [...] (somewhat lower than the average), which is roughly estimated to be the equivalent of 2.5 to 3 seconds to reach 100 km/h (or 0 to 60 mph). The start of the race is an important aspect of the race overall. [...] "Gating" [...] correctly can help a rider gain an initial advantage over other riders but speed advantages can be made as a race progresses. Those riders willing to take a risk and opt for finding the <b>grippy</b> parts of the track rather than the race line, are sometimes rewarded with extra speed allowing them to pass other riders either on the outside or the inside.|$|E
50|$|The rock-climbing {{fraternity}} tend {{to refer}} to the rocks as Rivelin Edge. Many rock climbers are drawn to the area because of the fine obelisk of Rivelin Needle, a 20 m free-standing gritstone pinnacle that {{stands in front of the}} main edge. There are no fewer than eight recognised routes up the needle, with “Croton Oil” graded at Hard Very Severe (HVS 5A) being regarded as a classic climb and one of the best routes on the eastern edges of the Peak District. The rocks in fact fall just inside the boundary of the national park. Additional attractions for the climber is that the rocks are south-facing and are often bathed in sunlight and warmer than some of the neighbouring climbing edges; the quality of the rock is also good, being extremely <b>grippy.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The {{year was}} 1941, and the soldier, well he wasn't just any infantryman, he was Nathan Clark, and he'd {{been sent to}} war with two missions. First and {{foremost}} to protect his country, and, secondly, to discover some new shoe designs for his family's company. As {{a member of the}} Eighth Army, Clark had been deployed to Burma, and it was here that he noticed that the officers in his formation were wearing these strange, sand colored chukkas during their downtime. Clark investigated the shoes and learned that they had originally been commissioned to Cairo cobblers by South African soldiers whose old-military issue boots had failed them out on the desert terrain. They wanted something that was both lightweight and <b>grippy</b> which led to creation of a boot with a suede upper on a crepe sole. Jake Gallagher ...|$|E
50|$|Powerchairs may be {{designed}} for indoor, outdoor or indoor/outdoor use. A typical indoor powerchair will be narrow and short, to enable better manoeuvring around tight environments. Controls are usually simple, {{and due to}} the smaller design, the chair would be less stable outdoors. Tyres are often smoother (once called carpet tyres) {{to look after the}} flooring in a home. Indoor/outdoor powerchairs again will be as small in design as possible, but with a reasonable range in the batteries, some <b>grippy</b> tyres (but not big knobbly off-road tyres), these often include a kerb-climber to assist with manoeuvres where there are no drop kerbs. Intended for pavement use only. Outdoor powerchairs have a considerable range, a large wheelbase to help with stability, and large tyres which improve the comfort and handling of the chair. These can sometimes be driven indoors in adapted environments, but not around a typical home.|$|E
50|$|This race is {{best known}} for its first corner {{incident}} involving world championship contenders Alain Prost and Ayrton Senna. Senna secured the pole, but was unhappy with the side of the track it was situated on, claiming that pole should always be on the racing line. He and Gerhard Berger then went to the Japanese stewards, to request a change of position of pole to the cleaner left side of the track. The stewards initially agreed but an injunction by FISA president Jean Marie Balestre later that night rejected the decision and the original pole position remained on the dirtier, less <b>grippy</b> right side of the track. In addition, as revealed by F1 journalist, Maurice Hamilton, the FIA had warned that crossing the yellow line of the pit exit on the right to better position oneself at the first corner would have not been appropriate, further infuriating Senna.|$|E
50|$|Star Fox Guard is a 3D tower defense game {{in which}} players must protect various bases, owned by Slippy Toad's uncle, <b>Grippy,</b> from {{oncoming}} attackers by monitoring security cameras.
