25|$|A slab is {{a length}} of metal that is {{rectangular}} in cross-section. It is created directly by continuous casting or indirectly by rolling an ingot on a slabbing mill. Slabs are usually further processed via <b>flat</b> <b>rolling,</b> skelping, and pipe rolling. Common final products include sheet metal, plates, strip metal, pipes, and tubes.|$|E
25|$|To the east, {{the city}} is bordered by a low {{escarpment}} called the Darling Scarp. Perth is on generally <b>flat,</b> <b>rolling</b> land– {{largely due to the}} high amount of sandy soils and deep bedrock. The Perth metropolitan area has two major river systems: the first is made up of the Swan and Canning Rivers; the second is that of the Serpentine and Murray Rivers, which discharge into the Peel Inlet at Mandurah.|$|E
25|$|Nevada and Arizona {{are both}} {{generally}} arid with desert lands and mountains, and receive {{large amounts of}} snow in the higher elevations in and near the mountains. New Mexico, Utah, and Colorado are generally arid, with desert lands and mountains as well. They all receive decent amounts of snow and large amounts of snow in the high elevations in the mountains, although some areas in far southwestern and southern New Mexico do not receive much snow at all. West Texas is generally arid as well but does not receive {{the same amount of}} snow that the other southwestern states receive at their high elevations. The terrain of western Texas in the Southwest is the <b>flat,</b> <b>rolling</b> land of the plains, which eventually turns into a desert with some hills, and there are significant mountains as well once you reach the Trans-Pecos area.|$|E

50|$|It {{differs from}} {{traditional}} cable ropeways {{by using a}} perfectly <b>flat</b> <b>rolling</b> way to limit the wear, rolling resistance and noise.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} theoretical {{analysis of}} microstructure {{changes in the}} material during standard rolling and normalizing rolling of the 35 x 20 mm flat bars. The analysis {{was carried out by}} means of computer software Forge 2007 ® that is based on finite element method. Two cases of accelerated cooling during rolling process were considered. Numerical results of 35 x 20 mm <b>flat</b> bars <b>rolling</b> process allowed to determine the average recrystallized austenite diameter as well as basis energy and force parameters. Proposed modification of the 35 x 20 mm <b>flat</b> bar <b>rolling</b> technology with accelerated cooling results in the reduction of average austenite diameter, which could improve the strength of the final product...|$|R
50|$|In the {{far eastern}} {{portions}} of the Mountain West are the High Plains, {{a portion of the}} Great Plains. These plains mainly consist of <b>flat</b> <b>rolling</b> land, with scattered buttes, canyons, and forests located in these areas. The High Plains receive very little rainfall and sit at high elevations, usually about 3000 to 6000 ft. Many people view the High Plains as the point where one begins to enter the greater Mountain West region.|$|E

50|$|In {{the summer}} months the climate in the Rzhev area was warm, with long days and a high sun which allowed the area to dry out after the spring thaw. Rzhev had <b>flat,</b> <b>rolling</b> country, with thick forests and patches of swamp. The {{neighborhood}} of Rzhev had open farmed land with a dense network of small village communities, which were often ribbons of houses along the roadside. The roads were mostly mud tracks that became almost impassible {{in the spring and}} autumn rains, but normally dried out in summer. Rainfall was typically moderate, but {{the summer months}} of 1942 had seen unusually heavy and persistent rainfall.|$|E

The county is home to more than 150,000 people and includes the incorporated towns of Holly Ridge, Richlands, Swansboro, North Topsail Beach, part of Surf City, and unincorporated Sneads Ferry. The U.S. Marine Corps Base, Camp Lejeune comprises approximately 156000 acre; more than 43,000 marines and sailors are stationed there.|$|E
5000|$|To {{stabilize}} the molten metal bubbles, high temperature foaming agents (nano- or micrometer- sized solid particles) are required. The {{size of the}} pores, or cells, is usually 1 to 8 mm. When foaming or blowing agents are used, they are mixed with the powdered metal before it is melted. This is the so-called [...] "powder route" [...] of foaming, and it {{is probably the most}} established (from an industrial standpoint). After metal (e.g. aluminium) powders and foaming agent (e.g.TiH2) have been mixed, they are compressed into a compact, solid precursor, which can be available {{in the form of a}} billet, a sheet, or a wire. Production of precursors can be done by a combination of materials forming processes, such as powder pressing, extrusion (direct or conform) and <b>flat</b> <b>rolling.</b>|$|E
