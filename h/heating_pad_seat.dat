40|$|Abstract The rewarming {{benefit of}} {{anterior}} torso <b>heat</b> <b>pad</b> application in mildly hypothermic conscious adult trauma patients remains inconclusive in this randomized comparative clinical trial. There was no between-group rewarming gain in ear canal temperature when an anterior torso chemical <b>heat</b> <b>pad</b> was compared with blankets. Patient awareness, and favorable perception of, being administered the active intervention (<b>heat</b> <b>pad)</b> {{could explain the}} significant improvement in patient-rated cold discomfort discerned with the <b>heat</b> <b>pad.</b> In the context of marginal demonstrated benefit, {{it would have been}} informative to ascertain adverse effects related to the <b>heat</b> <b>pad,</b> including burn injury to the chest wall. </p...|$|R
50|$|A microwavable <b>heating</b> <b>pad</b> is a <b>heating</b> <b>pad</b> that is {{warmed by}} {{placing it in}} a {{microwave}} oven before use. Microwavable <b>heating</b> <b>pads</b> are typically made out of a thick insulative fabric such as flannel and filled with grains such as wheat, buckwheat or flax seed. Due to their relative simplicity to make, they are frequently sewn by hand, often with a custom shape to fit the intended area of use.|$|R
40|$|Hypothermia can {{be caused}} by {{anaesthesia}} and/or surgery and represents a daily challenge in the operating room. Experimental animal surgery settings typically use <b>heating</b> <b>pads</b> or warming blankets to maintain the rodent’s body temperature during long-lasting experiments. Warming is crucial in small animal experiments because these animals quickly lose temperature due to their large body surface to body weight ratio. While establishing a left ventricular infarction model in rats, we inserted a rectal temperature probe. The <b>heating</b> <b>pad’s</b> set point was 378 C. Although a dual set point control circuit should prevent overheating, we observed a maximum <b>heating</b> <b>pad’s</b> surface temperature of 438 C between the animal’s back and the surface of the <b>heating</b> <b>pad.</b> At the end of the experiments, which lasted up to 8 h, the animals showed severe haematuria and segmental kidney damage. We hypothesized that overheating of the <b>heating</b> <b>pad</b> and uneven distribution of temperature led to kidney damage. Therefore, the maximal temperature of commonly used <b>heating</b> <b>pads</b> must be tightly controlled to avoid overheating, which may cause kidney or tissue injury, may falsify the experimental data and could influence the study results...|$|R
