40|$|Summary: Treatment of polluting {{discharges}} from abandoned mines is producing {{large quantities of}} ochre (mainly iron (III) oxides) for which no major end-use has yet been identified. At the same time, phosphorus pollution is {{a serious threat to}} the water environment in industrialised countries, causing eutrophication, algal blooms, fish kills and loss of water resources. Newcastle and Edinburgh Universities are currently conducting research to develop and test novel field-scale methods to use ochre for phosphorus removal from agricultural runoff and sewage effluent. Our laboratory experiments have demonstrated that ochre is an excellent adsorbent of phosphorus from solution (up to 30 g P kg- 1). Phosphorus removal is unaffected by phosphorus form (total, inorganic, organic) and solution pH. Potential applications of ochre for phosphorus removal from agricultural runoff and sewage effluent are discussed, including treatment of agricultural drainage with ochre-filled filter and <b>dosing</b> <b>units</b> and ochre-filled reaction vessels for sewage effluent treatment...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{aim was to}} {{elucidate}} clinical trial efficacy, safety, and dosing practices of abobotulinumtoxinA (ABO) treatment in adult patients with blepharospasm and hemifacial spasm. To date, most literature reviews for blepharospasm and hemifacial spasm have examined the effectiveness of all botulinum neurotoxin type A products as a class. However, differences in <b>dosing</b> <b>units</b> and recommended schemes provide a clear rationale for reviewing each product separately. Methods: A systematic literature review was performed to identify randomized controlled trials and other comparative clinical studies of ABO {{in the treatment of}} blepharospasm and hemifacial spasm published in English between January 1991 and March 2015. Medical literature databases (PubMed, Cochrane library, EMBASE) were searched. A total of five primary publications that evaluated ABO for the management of blepharospasm and hemifacial spasm were identified and summarized. Results: Data included 374 subjects with blepharospasm and 172 subjects with hemifacial spasm treated with ABO. Total ABO doses ranged between 80 and 340 U for blepharospasm and 25 and 85 U for hemifacial spasm, depending on the severity of the clinical condition. All studies showed statistically significant benefits for the treatment of blepharospasm and hemifacial spasm. ABO was generally well tolerated across the individual studies. Adverse events considered to be associated with ABO treatment included: ptosis, tearing, blurred vision, double vision, dry eyes, and facial weakness.

40|$|Botulinum toxin (BTX) is used {{in various}} fields of medicine, {{including}} the treatment of hyperhidrosis and cervical dystonia. Botox®, Dysport®, Xeomin® and NeuroBloc® are commercially available BTX products, which are formulated differently and their <b>dosing</b> <b>units</b> are unique. Dosage and concentration of the prepared solution for injection varies considerably among studies comparing the products. Improved guidelines on concentration and dosing when changing from one product to another are warranted. This would ensure {{the use of the}} lowest effective doses for good effect, minimal risk of antibody formation and side-effects as well as reduced costs. The aim of the present work was to find the most appropriate BTX concentration {{for each of the four}} products to achieve the highest sweat reducing effect and to investigate dose conversion ratios between Botox and Dysport in the treatment of cervical dystonia when the products are diluted to the same concentration, 100 U/ml. Paper I and II clearly confirm that it is crucial to consider the BTX concentration in a treatment regimen, especially when changing between different products. The optimal concentration to reduce sweating varies among the products and was found to be 25 U/ml for Botox and Xeomin, approximately 100 U/ml for Dysport and 50 U/ml for NeuroBloc. However, for NeuroBloc the optimal concentration might be even lower. In Paper III, which is a retrospective study using casebook notes from 75 patients with cervical dystonia, it was found that the most appropriate dose conversion ratio to use when switching from Botox to Dysport was 1 : 1. 7. In Paper IV, Botox and Dysport were prospectively compared in a double-blind, randomized clinical trial in two different dose conversion ratios (1 : 3 and 1 : 1. 7) when diluted to the same concentration (100 U/ml). No statistically significant difference was seen between Botox (1 : 3) and Dysport nor between Botox (1 : 1. 7) and Dysport four weeks after treatment. Some of the secondary outcome observations, however, did indicate that the ratio 1 : 3 resulted in suboptimal efficacy of Botox but this must be further validated in a larger patient material...|$|E

Two cases were studied: in one the batter was dosed manually into the paper cups and in the other the batter was dosed automatically into the paper cups. The flow properties of the batter dosed by the two methods showed significant differences in the consistency index, although in the flow index there was no difference. The mechanical spectra of batters at 25 and at 85 °C and the evolution of G¿ and G¿ with rising temperature (from 25 to 85 °C) were determined by dynamic rheological tests. Passing the batter through the automatic <b>dosing</b> <b>unit</b> produced an increase in both moduli (G¿ and G¿) at 25 °C and {{there was no difference in}} the values of G¿ and G¿ at 85 °C.

As proposed by Strandell et al. (2004), when VDI is greater than 4  l (i.e. human blood volume), {{it is likely that}} in vivo herb–drug interactions occurred with the participation of hepatic CYP enzymes. According to the National Drug Standards (Traditional Chinese Medicine Prescription, Volume 2) (Ministry of Health, PR of China), the <b>dose</b> <b>unit</b> of HQ tablets is about 650  mg HQ extract in which 117  mg is baicalin. Based on this <b>dose</b> <b>unit</b> and the respective IC 50 values, the VDI of individual CYP 450 isoforms were estimated (Table  5). The estimated VDIs of all HQ extracts examined on CYP 1 A 2, CYP 2 C 9 and CYP 2 D 6 enzymes were greater than 4  l per <b>dose</b> <b>unit.</b> More importantly, based on the estimated VDIs, only the extract obtained using UE-E method illustrated a significant in vivo herb–drug interaction with CYP 3 A 4 -metabolized Western drugs.

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the results of}} a pilot study of the reliability of the biokinetic and dosimetric models currently used by the U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) as predictors of <b>dose</b> per <b>unit</b> internal or external exposure to radionuclides. The study examines the feasibility of critically evaluating the accuracy of these models for a comprehensive set of radionuclides of concern to the NRC. Each critical evaluation would include: identification of discrepancies between the models and current databases; characterization of uncertainties in model predictions of <b>dose</b> per <b>unit</b> intake or unit external exposure; characterization of variability in <b>dose</b> per <b>unit</b> intake or unit external exposure; and evaluation of prospects for development of more accurate models. Uncertainty refers here to the level of knowledge of a central value for a population, and variability refers to quantitative differences between different members of a population. This pilot study provides a critical assessment of models for selected radionuclides representing different levels of knowledge of <b>dose</b> per <b>unit</b> exposure. The main conclusions of this study are as follows: (1) To optimize the use of available NRC resources, the full study should focus on radionuclides most frequently encountered in the workplace or environment. A list of 50 radionuclides is proposed. (2) The reliability of a dose coefficient for inhalation or ingestion of a radionuclide (i. e., an estimate of <b>dose</b> per <b>unit</b> intake) may depend strongly on the specific application. Multiple characterizations of the uncertainty in a dose coefficient for inhalation or ingestion of a radionuclide may be needed for different forms of the radionuclide and different levels of information of that form available to the dose analyst. (3) A meaningful characterization of variability in <b>dose</b> per <b>unit</b> intake of a radionuclide requires detailed information on the biokinetics of the radionuclide and hence is not feasible for many infrequently studied radionuclides. (4) The biokinetics of a radionuclide in the human body typically represents the greatest source of uncertainty or variability in <b>dose</b> per <b>unit</b> intake. (5) Characterization of uncertainty in <b>dose</b> per <b>unit</b> exposure is generally a more straightforward problem for external exposure than for intake of a radionuclide. (6) For many radionuclides the most important outcome of a large-scale critical evaluation of databases and biokinetic models for radionuclides {{is expected to be the}} improvement of current models. Many of the current models do not fully or accurately reflect available radiobiological or physiological information, either because the models are outdated or because they were based on selective or uncritical use of data or inadequate model structures. In such cases the models should be replaced with physiologically realistic models that incorporate a wider spectrum of information...|$|R

Output factors calculated with the convolution method as the <b>dose</b> per <b>unit</b> energy fluence relative to the calculated <b>dose</b> per <b>unit</b> energy fluence in a reference field could deviate as much as 5 % if corrections are not made for perturbations due to treatment head scatter.

The forward scatter adds an "unmonitored" contribution to the total energy fluence of the beam. A model is developed that describes the field size dependence of these perturbations for conversion of output factors, calculated with the convolution method, to machine output factors as an integrated part in treatment planning.
