5|$|Jenny {{spends her}} final days putting {{together}} a film of memories for Bette and Tina. The film contains friends past and present sharing their best moments. During the going-away party held for Bette and Tina, who are planning on moving to New York, they watch the film and Jenny is found dead in the swimming pool <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>yard.</b> It is assumed that she either fell or was pushed from the landing above the back steps, which is unfinished and lacks a proper railing. Because {{so many people have}} been offended, betrayed and hurt by Jenny, there are many suspects and they are interrogated.|$|E
5|$|That night, Lisa prays to God and assures him she has {{not turned}} her back on him, but plans to seek a new path to him. While on a walk around town passing many sacrilegious signs, she finds Springfield's Buddhist temple. Inside she sees Lenny and Carl meditating, and Hollywood actor Richard Gere teaches the core {{concepts}} of Buddhism to her. An intrigued Lisa takes a pamphlet on Buddhism and studies it at home. It convinces her of the virtues of the faith, and Lisa announces out her window she has become, and forever will be, a Buddhist. Lisa plants her own bodhi tree <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>yard</b> and begins to meditate, but Marge grows increasingly worried about Lisa's soul and tries to convince her to come back to Christianity.|$|E
5|$|The {{mutilated}} body of {{the fourth}} woman, prostitute Annie Chapman, was discovered at about 6:00am on Saturday 8 September on the ground near a doorway <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>yard</b> of 29 Hanbury Street, Spitalfields. Chapman had left her lodgings at 2am {{on the day she}} was murdered, with the intention of getting money from a client to pay her rent. Her throat was cut from left to right. She had been disembowelled, and her intestines had been thrown out of her abdomen over each of her shoulders. The morgue examination revealed that part of her uterus was missing. The pathologist, George Bagster Phillips, was of the opinion that the murderer must have possessed anatomical knowledge to have sliced out the reproductive organs in a single movement with a blade about 6–8inches (15–20cm) long. However, the idea that the murderer possessed surgical skill was dismissed by other experts. As the bodies were not examined extensively at the scene, it has also been suggested that the organs were actually removed by mortuary staff, who took advantage of bodies that had already been opened to extract organs that they could sell as surgical specimens.|$|E

The kitchen in the film was shot in the house, along with the main staircase, basement, attic and most of the first floor landing. The house's dining room, and all the downstairs rooms (excluding the kitchen) were {{duplicated}} on a sound stage to allow more room for equipment and crew. The house was built in 1920 and features five bedrooms, a fully converted attic, a detached double garage and a greenhouse.

25|$|After the Nazi German {{occupation}} of France in 1940, Beckett joined the French Resistance, {{in which he}} worked as a courier. On several occasions {{over the next two years}} he was nearly caught by the Gestapo. In August 1942, his unit was betrayed and he and Suzanne fled south on foot to the safety of the small village of Roussillon, in the Vaucluse département in Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur. There he continued to assist the Resistance by storing armaments <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>yard</b> of his home. During the two years that Beckett stayed in Roussillon he indirectly helped the Maquis sabotage the German army in the Vaucluse mountains, though he rarely spoke about his wartime work in later life.|$|E

The McGees won their house in a raffle from Mr. Hagglemeyer's Wistful Vista Development Company, with lottery ticket #131,313, happened upon by chance while on a pleasure drive in their car. With blowhard McGee wavering between mundane tasks and hare-brained schemes (like digging an oil well <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>yard),</b> antagonizing as many people as possible, and patient Molly indulging his foibles and providing loving support, not to mention a tireless parade of neighbors and friends {{in and out of the}} quiet home, Fibber McGee and Molly built its audience steadily, but once it found the full volume of that audience in 1940, they rarely let go of it.|$|E
25|$|The madbaha, {{arranged}} in the topmost platform {{at the eastern}} side of the building, represents Heaven. The primary altar is attached to the eastern wall. To the north of the madbaha is the diaqonikon (sacristry); to the south is the baptistery. The madbaha is protected with rails and is veiled by a red curtain most of the time; this is opened during the Holy Qurbana (Eucharist). An oil lamp within the sanctuary is kept glowing at all times to represent the presence of God. The madbaha is connected to the qestroma and haykla by a low-walled path called the sqaqona. The qestroma contains seats for the choir and lower clergy. The haykla contains an elevated platform or bema, which includes an altar, two lecterns for reading, and chairs for higher clergy. Worshipers stand before the altar, with separate seating for men and women. The main entrance is on the western side of the building; a vestibule, pillars, pilasters, and other architectural ornaments adorn the front end, and a flag mast stands in the front yard. One or two bells are installed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>yard</b> to signal the timing of ritual services, the death of a church member, or to inform the public of calamities.|$|E

40|$|The phlebotomine {{sand fly}} Lutzomyia longipalpis takes blood {{from a variety}} of wild and {{domestic}} animals and transmits Leishmania (Leishmania) infantum chagasi, etiological agent of American visceral leishmaniasis. Blood meal identification in sand flies has depended largely on serological methods but a new protocol described here uses filter-based technology to stabilise and store blood meal DNA, allowing subsequent PCR identification of blood meal sources, as well as parasite detection, in blood-fed sand flies. This technique revealed that 53. 6 % of field-collected sand flies captured <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>yards</b> of houses <b>in</b> Teresina (Brazil) had fed on chickens. The potential applications of this technique in epidemiological studies and strategic planning for leishmaniasis control programmes are discussed...|$|R

[...] Much of this was stored <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>yard</b> of his mother's house. Dibnah and his friend Alan Heap built a canoe from old bicycle wheels (cut in half to make the ribs), slate laths and a canvas sheet from the back of a lorry.

The crowd yelled [...] "Bunuh!" [...] (kill!) after which the executioner named Rustam decapitated the victim with one stroke of his sword.

Their voices sounded out with strong intonation, and the broad dialect was curiously caressing to the blood. It seemed to envelop Gudrun in a labourer's caress, there was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> whole atmosphere a resonance of physical men, a glamorous thickness of labour and maleness, surcharged <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air.

50|$|A {{committee}} of local expert artists {{was formed to}} judge the student sculptures {{as well as an}} advisory group of Peck employees to help <b>in</b> deciding <b>the</b> winning design. Richard Pflieger was the winning student with a design called Angel in a Cage, which was a fiberglass angel suspended in a tower of steel fencing. The artist’s inspiration came from the many fences throughout <b>the</b> Menomonee Valley <b>in</b> contrast with <b>the</b> numerous shrines with angels <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>yards</b> of <b>the</b> Milwaukee south side homes. The committee suggested the artwork should be forty feet high for the best sculptural impact and biggest statement. Pflieger took almost two years to complete this sculpture which still towers today now in front of Emmber Foods Incorporated on Canal Street in Menomonee Valley.|$|R
50|$|The Bolsover Colliery Company {{acquired}} ten {{acres of}} land <b>in</b> Creswell from <b>the</b> Duke of Portland {{on which to build}} a village to house its colliery employees. The village comprises 280 cottages built in two circles, an inner and an outer, around a large green with shrubberies and a bandstand. The inner-circle cottages faced the green and their <b>back</b> <b>yards</b> faced those of the outer circle. All the houses were of two storeys and had five or six rooms and were lit by electricity. All the houses had small front gardens facing either the green or surrounding the outer circle. Between the circles was a 15 yard road with a tram track used to transport coal to <b>the</b> colliers' cellars. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>yards</b> were enclosed ashpit lavatories that were emptied weekly at night by staff employed by the colliery company.

500|$|Despite a {{successful}} practice, by 1983 {{he was in}} financial difficulties from bad real estate investments and gambling debts. Becoming involved in a counterfeiting scheme, he printed $6 million in U.S. 100-dollar bills, some of which he stored in ice chests buried <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>yard</b> of a house he owned and rented out. Charged along with five others, he served two-and-a-half years of a five-year sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution, Texarkana. Upon his release in 1986, he regained his dentistry license but struggled to rebuild his practice. In 1995, he {{was hired as a}} dentist at the Louisiana State Penitentiary, initially as a contractor. At the time, the dental clinic in the prison was in chaos; many dentists refused to work there and inmates were often unable to make appointments. Cannon reorganized the dental program with great success and was soon hired as a full-time employee. Warden Burl Cain, impressed with Cannon's work with the dental program, put him in charge of the prison's entire medical system. Cannon remains the resident dentist at the penitentiary, where inmates typically call him [...] "Legend".|$|E
