30|$|Our {{hypothesis}} {{on the low}} business bankruptcy {{rates in}} Spain leads to two testable hypotheses regarding firms’ behaviour ex-ante (i.e., prior default) and ex-post. From the ex-ante perspective, as <b>filing</b> <b>for</b> <b>bankruptcy</b> is very costly, small firms with risky business models will bias their capital structure towards mortgage loans to avoid <b>filing</b> <b>for</b> <b>bankruptcy</b> {{in the event of}} default. From the ex-post perspective, holding mortgage debt will reduce the probability of <b>filing</b> <b>for</b> <b>bankruptcy</b> by a small financially distressed firm. These two implications should not occur in the case of either Spanish larger businesses or firms from the other two countries.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{extends the}} {{literature}} on the relationship between firm risk management and financial distress. It compares the use of financial risk management instruments by firms that eventually <b>file</b> <b>for</b> <b>bankruptcy</b> to matched firms that do not <b>file</b> <b>for</b> <b>bankruptcy</b> between 1994 and 2004. The relation between foreign currency risk management and the probability of bankruptcy is estimated with a duration analysis model, in a framework that controls for the endogeneity problem between the two. The results of this paper show that the odds of <b>filing</b> <b>for</b> <b>bankruptcy</b> are lower <b>for</b> firms that manage foreign currency risk...|$|R
