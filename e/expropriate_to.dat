5000|$|The land {{before the}} {{expropriation}} {{was used as}} a [...] "cantina" [...] where locals would go to drink day and night.

It was not until Panamanian general Omar Torrijos saw how hard they were fighting {{for the construction of a}} football field where the district could paractice the sport safely, that he ordered for the land <b>to</b> be <b>expropriated</b> and handed <b>to</b> the district.

50|$|The first idea of {{building}} a military airport was launched at a NATO meeting in Lisbon in 1951. In March 1952 the Norwegian Minister of Defence, Nils Langhelle announced that the airport {{was going to be}} built. There were multiple suggested locations, and the decision fell on the village Haugnes. The entire village with 310 residents was <b>expropriated</b> <b>to</b> give enough area for the airport.

40|$|Expropriation of {{foreign-owned}} property {{continues to}} be part of the modern economy. Under what conditions do governments have the ability <b>to</b> <b>expropriate</b> foreign direct investment (FDI) in a globalizing world? I argue that governments have more permissive space <b>to</b> <b>expropriate</b> when host <b>to</b> a greater diversity of nationalities of foreign firms. One means of observing this dynamic is through diplomatic advocacy, because diplomats scale back their efforts when FDI national diversity weakens diplomatic leverage. This paper uses case studies of European and American investors in Argentina, Ukraine, Russia, and Romania to link variation in expropriation to FDI national diversity via diplomacy. If we take FDI national diversity as a marker of global integration, more integrated governments are – counterintuitively – more likely <b>to</b> <b>expropriate...</b>|$|R

50|$|In July 1967, Prime Minister Levi Eshkol ordered {{government}} clerks {{to bypass}} the ordinary procedures to allow for Givat HaMivtar and the other hinge neighborhoods to be built as quickly as possible. When purchasing land encountered difficulties, some tracts were <b>expropriated.</b> <b>To</b> speed up the building process, land was subsidized by the government. Most of the homes in Givat HaMivtar were privately built. The majority of the homes were two-family homes, originally one-story high, to which a second and often a third floor was added over time.|$|R
5000|$|The {{creation}} of the park in 1970 was preceded by the removal of 225 families through expropriation. When preparing to create the new park, the Government of Canada requested that the Quebec government expropriate the homes of these families. The Quebec government sub-contracted the appropriation and negotiations to a private firm. This firm allegedly used various bullying tactics to scare the residents into agreeing to settlements of reduced value. This stratagem ensured a larger profit margin for the contractor. On 14 February 2011, the House of Commons adopted a motion which issued an official apology to the people whose properties were <b>expropriated</b> <b>to</b> create Forillon Park. The motion read:That this House issue an official apology to the people whose properties were <b>expropriated</b> <b>to</b> create Forillon Park for the unconscionable {{manner in which they}} were treated, and that the Speaker of the House send the representatives of the people whose properties were expropriated and of their descendants an official copy of the Journals of the House of Commons indicating the adoption of this motion.This expropriation {{is the subject of a}} song titled [...] "Forillon" [...] by the group Le Vent du Nord on their album Têtu.
