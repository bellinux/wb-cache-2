50|$|To harden by quenching, a metal (usually {{steel or}} cast iron) must be heated above the upper {{critical}} temperature {{and then quickly}} cooled. Depending on the alloy and other considerations (such as concern for maximum hardness vs. cracking and distortion), cooling may be done with forced air or other gases, (such as nitrogen). Liquids may be used, due to their better thermal conductivity, such as oil, water, a polymer dissolved in water, or a brine. Upon being rapidly cooled, a portion of austenite (dependent on alloy composition) will transform to martensite, a hard, brittle crystalline structure. The quenched hardness of a metal depends on its chemical composition and quenching method. Cooling speeds, from fastest to slowest, go from brine, polymer (i.e. mixtures of water + glycol polymers), fresh water, oil, and forced air. However, quenching a certain steel too fast can result in cracking, which is why high-tensile steels such as AISI 4140 should be quenched in oil, tool steels such as ISO 1.2767 or H13 <b>hot</b> <b>work</b> <b>tool</b> <b>steel</b> should be quenched in forced air, and low alloy or medium-tensile steels such as XK1320 or AISI 1040 should be quenched in brine.|$|E

Through this process, an ultra-fine grained H 13 steel with equiaxed grains of about 0. 3 microns in diameter could be obtained. A quenched hardness of the developed steel was comparable to that of an AISI M 2 high speed steel produced by melting and hot-working process. Furthermore, although tempered hardness of the M 2 steel decreases with increasing tempering temperature of 848 K or higher, that of the developed steel does not decrease so much.

The paper present laser surface technologies, investigation of structure and properties of the <b>hot</b> <b>work</b> <b>tool</b> <b>steels</b> alloying with ceramic particles using high power diode laser HPDL. Design/methodology/approach: Investigation indicate the influence of the alloying carbides on the structure and properties of the surface layer of investigated steel depending on the kind of alloying carbides and power implemented laser (HPDL). Laser alloying of surface layer of investigated steel without introducing alloying additions into liquid molten metal pool, in the whole range of used laser power, causes size reduction of dendritic microstructure with the direction of crystallization consistent with the direction of heat carrying away from the zone of impact of laser beam. Findings: In the effect of laser alloying with powders of carbides NbC, TaC, TiC, WC and VC occurs size reduction of microstructure as well as dispersion hardening through fused in but partially dissolved carbides and consolidation through enrichment of surface layer in alloying additions coming from dissolving carbides. Introduced particles of carbides and in part remain undissolved, creating conglomerates being a result of fusion of undissolved powder grains into molten metal base. In effect of convection movements of material in the liquid state, conglomerates of carbides arrange themselves in the characteristic of swirl. Remelting of the steel without introducing into liquid molten pool the alloying additions in the form of carbide powders, causes slight increase of properties of surface layer of investigated steel in comparison to its analogical properties obtained through conventional heat treatment, depending on the laser beam power implemented for remelting. Practical implications: It has the important cognitive significance and gives grounds to the practical employment of these technologies for forming the surfaces of new tools and regeneration of the used ones. The increase of hardness of surface layer obtained throughout remelting and alloying with carbides by high power diode laser is accompanied by increase of tribological properties, when comparing to the steel processed with conventional heat treatment.

40|$|The {{continuous}} development of hot forming <b>tool</b> <b>steels</b> {{has resulted in}} steels with improved mechanical properties. A change in alloying composition, primarily a decreased silicon content, makes them tougher and more wear resistant at elevated temperatures. However, {{it is at the}} expense of their machinability. The aim {{of this study is to}} explain the mechanisms behind this negative side effect. <b>Hot</b> <b>work</b> <b>tool</b> <b>steels</b> of H 13 type with different Si content were characterised mechanically, and evaluated analytically and by dedicated machining tests. Machining tests verified that materials with low Si content displayed reduced machinability due to their stronger tendency to adhere to the cutting edge. Three hypotheses were tested. The first hypothesis, that the improved toughness of the low Si steels is the reason behind their relatively poor machinability, was rejected after machining tests with one low Si steel heat treated to the same relatively low toughness as conventional <b>hot</b> <b>work</b> <b>tool</b> <b>steels.</b> The second hypothesis, that a change in oxidation properties, also associated with the change in Si composition, lies behind the reduced machinability was investigated by dedicated tests and evaluations. It was found that the oxide thickness increased with reduced Si content and that there was an enrichment of Cr at the oxide/steel interface. The differences in oxide thickness and the possible differences in oxidation properties may influence the machinability of the materials through their different abilities to adhere to the cutting edge. The third hypothesis, that a high enough temperature to initiate phase transformation from ferrite to austenite is generated during machining of the <b>tool</b> <b>steels,</b> was also investigated. This may lead to a reduced machinability because higher austenite content is directly related to higher compressive stresses and higher cutting forces. This causes accelerated tool wear. This hypothesis was verified by ThermoCalc calculation of austenite content in the steels, which showed a good agreement with Gleeble compression tests and cutting force measurements. This thesis confirms that a reduced Si content in conventional H 13 steel improves the toughness, reduces the oxidation resistance and lowers the ferrite-to-austenite transformation temperature. The reduction in austenite temperature is probably the most important factor behind the reduced machinability. ...|$|R

The evaluation of the adhesion of coatings to the substrate was made using the scratch test. The wear and friction tests were performed on a pin-on-disc device at the room temperature and at the temperature of 500 °C. Findings: The best wear resistance in both conditions (20 °C, 500 °C temperature) demonstrate the TiN coating. These test results correspond with the very good adhesion of the coating to the substrate material and its high hardness. The critical load Lc 5 (coating total delamination) lies within the range 86 - 92 N, depending on the coating type.

40|$|Die casting {{is a very}} {{cost-efficient}} {{method of}} forming thin-walled and complex near net-shaped products with close geometric tolerances and good surface finish. A permanent die tool is used to make large quantities of identical products. The performance and tool life are limited by several mechanisms, e. g. thermal fatigue cracking, erosion, and corrosion. To develop new and more resistant tool materials for die casting detailed knowledge of the actual casting conditions and the tool failure mechanisms are essential. This thesis contributes to an increased knowledge of tool failure in die casting by investigating and simulating actual casting conditions and tool failure mechanisms. A method to record the temperature fluctuations in a cavity insert during actual brass die casting was developed, and details of the temperature conditions were obtained. Also, a test method based on cyclic induction heating and internal cooling of hollow cylindrical test rods was developed, where the surface strain during thermal cycling could be measured. This method reproduced the characteristic type of surface cracking observed on die casting tools, and proved to give information of the strains and stresses behind the fatigue failure. In actual die casting, the dominant tool failure mechanism is thermal fatigue cracking. The formation of the cracks is associated to accumulation of the local plastic strain that occurs during each casting cycle. Initial crack growth is facilitated by oxidation of the crack surfaces, and proceeded growth is facilitated by this oxidation in combination with crack filling of cast material, and by softening of the tool material. In addition, local enrichment of Pb at the crack front from the cast alloy melt was also observed to promote the crack growth in die casting of brass. In an investigation of thermal fatigue of two <b>hot</b> <b>work</b> <b>tool</b> <b>steels,</b> quenched and tempered to different conditions, {{it was found that}} low-cycle fatigue occurs, although the estimated tensile stress never exceed the initial yield strength of the steel. The reason is a gradual softening of the steel during the thermal cycling, and the presence of stress raising defects. The resistance against thermal cracking improves with initial <b>tool</b> <b>steel</b> hardness, because any initial ranking in hardness among the steels is unaffected by the thermal cycling. Another investigation on a selection of surface engineered <b>tool</b> <b>steels,</b> including common diffusion treatments, PVD coatings and combinations of these, showed that surface engineering generally reduce the resistance against thermal cracking as compared to untreated references, since the engineering processes influence negatively on the mechanical properties of the <b>hot</b> <b>work</b> <b>tool</b> <b>steels.</b> Finally, corrosion tests of CrN PVD-coated <b>tool</b> <b>steels</b> by exposing them to molten aluminium revealed the mechanisms of initiation and progress of liquid metal corrosion of this material combination, and that the corrosion resistance improves with the CrN coating thickness...|$|R

Due to the high temperatures when working with molten metals such as aluminium, iron and brass, the requirements on the tools are very high. High heat resistance and ductility as well as wear resistance are important. Resistance to thermal cyclic stress is also good.Application areas are casting, extrusion and forging.|$|R
40|$|<b>Hot</b> <b>work</b> <b>tool</b> <b>steels</b> (HWTSs) are ferrous alloys for tooling application, {{particularly}} {{developed to}} meet high toughness and good hot hardness. Increasing hardness generally {{leads to a}} decrease in toughness, therefore metal matrix composite (MMC) coatings and functionally graded materials have been proposed as a good solution for improving wear resistance. In this PhD thesis powder metallurgy has been applied {{for the production of}} particle reinforced HWTSs. Mechanical milling (MM) and mechanical alloying (MA) have been considered as suited techniques for the production of powders showing higher sinterability and finer microstructure. Spark plasma sintering (SPS) has been used for the consolidation. As reinforcement a harder high speed steel (HSS) and different ceramic powders (TiB 2, TiC and TiN) have been selected. The production of HWTS/HSS blends has highlighted the negative interaction on densification of the two components due to their different sintering kinetics. This interference can be minimised by selecting powders with smaller particles size. With this respect MM was proved to be a very useful method, which enhances sintering. Fully dense blends with good dispersion of the reinforcing particles can be sintered using small sized powders and setting the particle size ratio (PSR) smaller than 1. For the production of MMCs the formation of aggregates has been overcome by MA which promotes a uniform dispersion of hard particles into the parent steel. Among the reinforcement considered in this work, TiB 2 is not suitable because it reacts with steel depleting carbon and producing TiC and brittle Fe 2 B. HWTS composites with 20...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. It is {{well known}} that the main failure {{mechanisms}} in die-casting mould are heat checking due to thermal fatigue and melt-out caused by chemical reaction between die and molten alloys. Thermal fatigue tests were carried out using the thermal cycle simulator to establish the proper method to estimate the thermal fatigue resistance of hot die steel. In this study, the thermal shock tester consisted of induction heating and water spray cooling unit was constructed to evaluate thermal crack propagation resistance and the sum of crack length per unit specimen length, Lm is proposed as the index representing the susceptibility to crack initiation and propagation. Also, new concept of measurement for the melt-out behavior was suggested. AISI H 13 <b>hot</b> <b>work</b> <b>tool</b> <b>steel</b> was solution treated and tempered at various temperatures, to control the hardness and toughness that have effect on the behavior of thermal crack propagation. The result of thermal fatigue test showed that there is optimum value of hardness and impact energy to maximize the thermal crack propagation resistance. The influence of nitriding on melt-out resistance was also investigated. The dissolution rate due to melt-out phenomenon tended to be smaller for thicker compound layer. Furthermore, the resistance to melt-out was affected by the compound layer thickness rather than that of diffusion layer. The results of the both tests properly reflect the effect of materials properties on failure modes of die-casting mould and it means those test methods are suitable to evaluate the durability of <b>hot</b> <b>work</b> <b>tool</b> <b>steel</b> for die-casting...|$|E
40|$|Repeated fast surface {{temperature}} transients {{can damage the}} materials and/or their surface treatments by thermal fatigue. This happens in aluminium diecasting devices. One conducted thermal fatigue tests with samples of <b>hot</b> <b>work</b> <b>tool</b> <b>steel,</b> respectively untreated, simply borided and protected by a multi-layer. In the last case, top coat is yttria stabilised zirconia (YSZ), followed by a nickel superalloy and then a borided layer (undercoat). The zirconia coating was applied with plasma spray. The multi-layer showed poor resistance during the thermal fatigue tests. Better understanding these tests and the resulting thermal fatigue observed on the treated materials was achieved by a lifetime model based on Coffin-Manson equations. © 2010 Elsevier B. V.

Design/methodology/approach: The tribological wear relationships using pin-on-disc test were specified for surface layers subject to laser treatment, determining the friction coefficient, and mass loss of the investigated surfaces. Findings: The performed investigations leads to the conclusions that for both types of steels - X 40 CrMoV 5 - 1 and 32 CrMoV 12 - 28 the wear resistance measured using pin-on-disc, wear resistance test in the metal – metal arrangement, and wear resistance test in the metal – ceramic material arrangement, the wear resistance increases together with the hardness of the surface layer. This relationship is valid {{for all types of}} ceramic powders used. It is characteristic for the obtained surface layers, that the high roughness, multiple pores, irregularity, and flashes at the borders increases also together with the increasing of the laser power. Research limitations/implications: In order to evaluate with more detail the possibility of applying these surface layers in tools, further investigations should be concentrated on the determination of the thermal fatigue resistance of the layers. Practical implications: The alloyed layers which were formed {{on the surface of the}} <b>hot</b> <b>work</b> steels have shown significant improvement concerning properties. Good properties of the laser treatment make these layers suitable for various technical and industrial applications.

Design/methodology/approach: The main goal of this work was to compare the abrasion wear resistance of those two steels before and after laser treatment consisting on remelting or alloying with carbide powders. The reason of this work was also to determine the laser treatment parameters, particularly the laser power, to achieve surface layer with better properties for example hardness which is connected with abrasive wear resistance of surface layers. Findings: A modification of <b>tool</b> <b>steels</b> surface using a laser beam radiation, as well as coating them with special pastes containing particles such as vanadium allows the essential improvement of the surface layer properties – their quality and abrasion resistance, decreasing {{at the same time the}} surface quality, what is dependent on the processing parameters such as energy of impulse and the time of its work. Surface layer obtained due to laser modification is characteristic of different properties than the native material.
