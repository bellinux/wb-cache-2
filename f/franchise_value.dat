40|$|In {{a dynamic}} model of moral hazard, {{competition}} can undermine prudent bank behavior. While capital-requirement regulation can induce prudent behavior, the policy yields Pareto-inefficient outcomes. Capital requirements reduce gambling incentives by putting bank equity at risk. However, {{they also have}} a perverse effect of harming banks' <b>franchise</b> <b>values,</b> thus encouraging gambling. Pareto-efficient outcomes can be achieved by adding deposit-rate controls as a regulatory instrument, since they facilitate prudent investment by increasing <b>franchise</b> <b>values.</b> Even if deposit-rate ceilings are not binding on the equilibrium path, they may be useful in deterring gambling off the equilibrium path.

Stock price data from publicly traded S&L is used to measure portfolio risk and <b>franchise</b> or charter <b>values.</b> The empirical results provide support for the moral hazard hypothesis. The standard deviation of equity returns is negatively related to S&L <b>franchise</b> <b>values,</b> {{as measured by the}} market-to-book asset ratio.

After a brief discussion of how this may impact on the distribution of income, we outline {{the ways in which the}} Vickers Report seeks to remedy these problems. ...|$|R

40|$|Banking {{industry}} liberalization in China {{has gained}} pace. The theoretical underpinning {{of this policy}} approach is the McKinnon-Shaw hypothesis, which contends that a liberalized financial sector will maximize the quantity of deposits mobilized and optimize the efficiency with which these funds are allocated amongst competing investments. However, disparate country experiences {{with the process of}} financial liberalization have prompted the emergence of alternative theoretical paradigms. One theory that has been proposed argues that through reducing bank <b>franchise</b> <b>values,</b> liberalization may have the effect of reducing the quantity of deposits mobilized. Drawing on an extensive international panel data set, the empirical analysis conducted in this paper suggests that, contrary to this hypothesis, bank <b>franchise</b> <b>values</b> are either unrelated, or negatively related, to deposits mobilization. Nevertheless, the process of banking industry liberalization still poses immense challenges for policy-makers in China, {{and the extent to which}} these challenges are adequately met will go a long way to determining whether the transition to a market economy is successfully completed...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{literature}} (Boyd and De Nicoló, 2005) {{has argued}} that competition in the loan market lowers bank risk by reducing the risk-taking incentives of borrowers. We show {{that the impact of}} loan market competition on banks is reversed if banks can adjust their loan portfolios. The reason is that when borrowers become safer, banks want to offset the effect on their balance sheet and switch to higher-risk lending. They even overcompensate the effect of safer borrowers because loan market competition erodes their <b>franchise</b> <b>values</b> and thus increases their risk-taking incentives. ...|$|R

The authors argue that this competition is likely to reduce the growth and relative importance of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and hence their <b>franchise</b> <b>values</b> and effective capital. Such developments could, in turn, lead to more risky behaviors by these two GSEs. It is this last consequence that warrants greater regulatory awareness. ...|$|R

50|$|Compliance risk is {{the current}} and {{prospective}} risk to earnings or capital arising from violations of, or nonconformance with, laws, rules, regulations, prescribed practices, internal policies, and procedures, or ethical standards. Compliance risk also arises in situations where the laws or rules governing certain bank products or activities of the Bank’s clients may be ambiguous or untested. This risk exposes the institution to fines, civil money penalties, payment of damages, and the voiding of contracts. Compliance risk can lead to diminished reputation, reduced <b>franchise</b> <b>value,</b> limited business opportunities, reduced expansion potential, and an inability to enforce contracts.|$|E
40|$|A large {{theoretical}} literature {{shows that}} competition reduces banks' <b>franchise</b> <b>values</b> and induces {{them to take}} more risk.

In particular, respect for the rule of law, a low level of corruption, and good contract enforcement are relevant institutional characteristics. We also examine evidence on the behavior of bank <b>franchise</b> <b>values</b> after liberalization, and on the relationship among financial liberalization, banking crises, financial development, and growth.

40|$|This study {{provides}} evidence that <b>franchise</b> <b>value</b> improves insurers ’ operating performance.

One of the disappointed investors was Sherman’s close friend, Warner Communications Inc.'s CEO Steve Ross, who was building cable television franchises and had recently purchased Warner Bros. Studio for its film and TV content. Ross agreed with Sherman that sports content also had great potential value, with cable television as a delivery system. Ross asked Sherman to join WCI and use his coaching and media expertise to build good teams and develop these potential assets.|$|R
40|$|Lending retail {{deposits}} to SMEs and household borrowers {{may be the}} traditional role of commercial banks: but banking in Britain has been transformed by increasing consolidation and by the lure of high returns available from wholesale Investment activities. With appropriate changes to the baseline model of commercial banking in Allen and Gale (2007), we show how market power enables banks to collect „seigniorage?; and how „tail risk? investment allows losses to be shifted onto the taxpayer. In principle, the high <b>franchise</b> <b>values</b> associated with market power assist regulatory capital requirements to check risk-taking. But when big banks act strategically, bailout expectations can undermine these disciplining devices: and the taxpayer ends up „on the hook?- as in the recent crisis.

Implementing policies that best promote financial development - such as mobilizing savings - are therefore, a matter of importance for all developing countries. A recent theoretical proposal that draws inspiration from the East Asian development experience hypothesises that by regulating to augment bank <b>franchise</b> <b>values</b> (i. e. the capitalized value of expected future profits accruing to banks), more savings can be mobilized compared with pursuing liberalization policies. This article provides an empirical test of this theory using a panel data set that covers 101 countries over the period 1994 to 2001. The results are not supportive of the theoretical proposal. In commenting on this result, it is noted that while intervening in the financial sector might not boost the aggregate quantity of savings mobilized, liberalization policies in developing countries should not necessarily be expedited, as other considerations are also clearly relevant. ...|$|R
