5000|$|One of {{the more}} {{difficult}} decisions in selecting a sound level meter is [...] "How {{do you know if}} it complies with its claimed standard?" [...] This is a difficult question and IEC 61672 part 2 tries to answer this by the concept of [...] "pattern approval". A manufacturer has to supply instruments to a national laboratory which tests one of them and if it meets its claims issue a formal <b>Pattern</b> <b>Approval</b> <b>certificate.</b> In Europe, the most common approval is often considered to be that from the PTB in Germany (Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt). If a manufacturer cannot show at least one model in his range that has such approval, it is reasonable to be wary, but the cost of this approval militates against any manufacturer having all his range approved. Inexpensive sound level meters (under $200) are unlikely to have a <b>Pattern</b> <b>Approval</b> and may produce incorrect measurement results.|$|R
