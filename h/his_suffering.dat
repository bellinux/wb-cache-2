5|$|Aegaeonâ€“ Featured in Ascension, Aegaeon the Hecatonchires had pledged a blood oath to Zeus, {{but later}} betrayed the god. The first {{victim of the}} Furies, they {{captured}} and tortured the multi-armed creature. Instead of killing him, the Furies turned him to stone, making him the giant Prison of the Damned and becoming a symbol to all who may think of breaking a blood oath to a god. As Kratos attempted to escape the prison, Megaera used her parasitic insects to bring Aegaeon to life and control him as his many arms mutated into monstrous forms and began to attack the Spartan. Fending off two of its parasite-controlled arms, Megaera then infected Aegaeon's head, which attacked Kratos, but the Spartan outsmarted and killed Megaera; this also caused Aegaeon to die, freeing him from <b>his</b> <b>suffering.</b>|$|E
5|$|Because Irenaeus saw {{the purpose}} of the world to be the {{development}} of the moral character of humans, he believed that a good world would be best suited to that purpose. Irenaeaus believed that this world would include some suffering and evil to help people draw closer to God. He perceived God's declaration in the Book of Genesis that his creation was good to mean that the world is fit for purpose, rather than being free from suffering. To illustrate the benefits of suffering, Irenaeus cited the Biblical example of Jonah, from the Book of Jonah. <b>His</b> <b>suffering,</b> being swallowed by a whale, both enabled God's plan to be fulfilled and also brought Jonah closer to God: Jonah ended up repenting for his sin and the people of Nineveh turn to God.|$|E

5|$|After {{four minutes}} of deliberation, the jury's foreman {{announced}} a guilty verdict and {{a sentence of}} death. The trial lasted about one hour. Court officers approached Washington to escort him away, but were pushed aside by a surge of spectators, who seized Washington and dragged him outside. Washington initially fought back, biting one man, but was soon beaten. A chain was placed {{around his neck and}} he was dragged toward city hall by a growing mob; on the way downtown, he was stripped, stabbed, and repeatedly beaten with blunt objects. By the time he arrived at city hall, a group had prepared wood for a bonfire next to a tree in front of the building. Washington, semiconscious and covered in blood, was doused with oil, hung from the tree by a chain, and then lowered to the ground. Members of the crowd cut off his fingers, toes, and genitals. The fire was lit and Washington was repeatedly raised and lowered into the flames until he burned to death. German scholar Manfred Berg posits that the executioners attempted to keep him alive to increase <b>his</b> <b>suffering.</b> Washington attempted to climb the chain, but was unable to, owing to his lack of fingers. The fire was extinguished after two hours, allowing bystanders to collect souvenirs from the site of the lynching, including Washington's bones and links of the chain. One attendee kept part of Washington's genitalia; a group of children snapped the teeth out of Washington's head to sell as souvenirs. By the time that the fire was extinguished, parts of Washington's arms and legs had been burned off and his torso and head were charred. His body was removed from the tree and dragged behind a horse throughout the town. Washington's remains were transported to Robinson, where they were publicly displayed until a constable obtained the body late in the day and buried it.|$|E
