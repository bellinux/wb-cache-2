5|$|Actors and props from Doppelgänger would re-appear {{in a later}} Anderson TV series, UFO. Although the Andersons {{incorporated}} adult themes {{into their}} script {{in an effort to}} <b>distinguish</b> <b>the</b> film from their children's TV productions, cuts to more mature content, in this case a shot of a pack of contraceptive pills, were required to permit an A and, later, PG certificate from the BBFC.|$|E
5|$|Algorithmic {{analysis}} {{of images of}} artworks, for example using X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, can reveal information about art. Such techniques can uncover images in layers of paint later covered over by an artist; help art historians to visualize an artwork before it cracked or faded; help to tell a copy from an original, or <b>distinguish</b> <b>the</b> brushstroke style of a master from those of his apprentices.|$|E

5|$|Bryars {{chose to}} <b>distinguish</b> <b>the</b> {{character}} types through the vocal ranges they were given. The adults {{of the town}} are largely given deep voices, bass and bass-baritone for the men, contralto and mezzo-soprano for the women. The lovers have high voices, soprano and counter-tenor. In {{order to make the}} scientists sound unlike the townspeople, Bryars made Ox a tenor and Ygène a baritone, both parts being agile, lyric and relatively high in their voice range.|$|E
5|$|C.mutica closely {{resemble}} Caprella acanthogaster, also {{a native of}} East Asian waters. It {{may be difficult to}} <b>distinguish</b> <b>the</b> two species, particularly since Caprellamutica can exhibit considerable morphological variations among males. C.mutica can only be reliably differentiated by their setose first and second pereonites (smooth in C.acanthogaster), as well as the elongated oval shape of their gills (linear in C.acanthogaster).|$|E
5|$|Classical thinkers {{employed}} classification {{as a way}} {{to define}} and assess the quality of poetry. Notably, the existing fragments of Aristotle's Poetics describe three genres of poetry—the epic, the comic, and the tragic—and develop rules to <b>distinguish</b> <b>the</b> highest-quality poetry in each genre, based on the underlying purposes of the genre. Later aestheticians identified three major genres: epic poetry, lyric poetry, and dramatic poetry, treating comedy and tragedy as subgenres of dramatic poetry.|$|E

5|$|De Saulles {{created the}} new florin {{in this manner}} to <b>distinguish</b> <b>the</b> coin from the half crown, as there had been {{complaints}} of confusion. He probably based the design on his British trade dollar (1895). The sitter for the design was Susan Hicks-Beach, the daughter of Michael Hicks-Beach, 1st Earl St Aldwyn who had served as Chancellor of the Exchequer and ex officio Master of the Mint. The modern-day Britannia coinage, bullion pieces struck by the Royal Mint for investors and collectors, has a reverse that strongly resembles that of the Edwardian florin.|$|E

Neurophysiology studies are not required for the diagnosis.|$|E

5|$|If {{there is}} {{doubt about the}} cause of the skin lesions, a biopsy of the skin may be {{performed}} to <b>distinguish</b> <b>the</b> purpura from other diseases that cause it, such as vasculitis due to cryoglobulinemia; on microscopy the appearances are of a hypersensitivity vasculitis, and immunofluorescence demonstrates IgA and C3 (a protein of the complement system) in the blood vessel wall. However, overall serum complement levels are normal.|$|E

5|$|Knowing that a {{court battle}} lay ahead, Hadl {{contacted}} Rissman, the errant Tiger licensee, {{to compromise on}} the handheld King Kong game. Hadl wanted to remove the exclusivity provision of the license and to <b>distinguish</b> <b>the</b> handheld game from Donkey Kong so as to weaken any potential counterclaims that one of Universal's licensees had violated Nintendo's intellectual property rights. Rissman complied, giving the hero a fireman hat, replacing barrel graphics with bombs, and making the game platforms straight instead of crooked. This design was approved in early June.|$|E
5|$|Lemur {{behavior}} is as variable as lemur morphology. Differences in diet, social systems, activity patterns, locomotion, communication, predator avoidance tactics, breeding systems, and intelligence levels help define lemur taxa and set individual species {{apart from the}} rest. Although trends frequently <b>distinguish</b> <b>the</b> smaller, nocturnal lemurs from the larger, diurnal lemurs, there are often exceptions that help exemplify the unique and diverse nature of these Malagasy primates.|$|E

5|$|Sphecius grandis can be {{distinguished}} from S.convallis (the Pacific cicada killer wasp) by the coloration pattern of the gastral tergites. Formerly, the two species were distinguished {{on the basis of}} the number of tergites with yellow markings (five in S.grandis and three in S.convallis), but a more recent study showed that this character was insufficient to <b>distinguish</b> <b>the</b> two species. However, they can {{be distinguished}} by the density of the punctation on the first and second tergites.|$|E
5|$|Stylistically, many {{commentators}} have described The Oceanides as either an outright example of Impressionism or somehow derivative of that art movement.
