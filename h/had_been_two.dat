5|$|As it <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>two</b> {{decades since}} much silver was {{regularly}} deposited for striking into coins, {{the fact that}} the United States had been on a bimetallic standard since 1792 was often forgotten. The gold standard was seen as the only possible choice, and many people assumed that the United States was on that standard, which had been adopted by strong nations like the United Kingdom (1816) and the German Empire (1871).|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{aforementioned}} entry restrictions, Manchester United had only met English opposition in Europe twice before, while Chelsea had far more experience against English opposition, having played 12 matches against compatriot clubs, winning five, drawing five and losing just two.

5|$|Berhtwald died on 13 January 731. An epitaph to him {{in verse}} survives, {{and may have been}} placed over his tomb, which was at Canterbury. Subsequently he was canonised with a feast day of 9 January. Little {{evidence}} of extensive cult activity exists, however, and the main evidence for his sainthood is a late medieval entry in a St Augustine's calendar. Berhtwald is the first of the continuous series of native-born archbishops in England, although there <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>two</b> previous Anglo-Saxon archbishops at Canterbury—Deusdedit and Wighard.|$|E

Her predecessors <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>two</b> 90-gun ships, the first launched in 1683, renamed HMS Torbay in 1750 and sold in 1784. The second had been launched in 1757, {{was used as a}} sheer hulk from 1784, and was broken up in 1816. Stanhope sailed from Woolwich on 11 June 1797, flying the broad pendant of Commodore Sir Erasmus Gower, and made for the Nore.|$|E

At the time there <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>two</b> separate pools of trains for the eastern and western networks. On the eastern metro, the T1000 units were in use, while the western network was using older material. During the 1980s, some T1000 stock had been rebuilt with pantograph, and taken into use on the western network.|$|E

There <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>two</b> hundred and fifty applications for the position, of which only fourteen were appointed; Ingram being one of the earliest. Following the outbreak of the Second World War, Ingram once again volunteered his services and enlisted in the militia on 17 November 1939.

5|$|Realizing his situation, Maroboduus {{requested}} Roman aid. It <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>two</b> {{years since}} the Marcommani refused to help Roman {{against the forces of}} Arminius, and so Tiberius refused to send aid. Instead, Tiberius sent Drusus to further Roman interests at Maroboduus' expense as he knew the Marcomanni were vulnerable. During the summer of 18, Drusus received intelligence from a former captive of Maroboduus, Catualda, that Maroboduus was weak and {{that it was a good}} time to attack. Hence, Drusus led a powerful force into the heart of the Marcomanni, and stormed their royal stronghold. Maroboduus fled, but was forced to seek asylum in Rome, which Tiberius granted. Later, Catualda lost a battle against the Hermunduri, and he too was granted asylum. The Senate decreed that Drusus be given an ovation for his success, which he received on his return to Rome on 28 May 20.|$|E

5|$|As Renaissance styles survived {{late in the}} city, the {{appearance}} of Baroque art was also delayed, but from the mid-18th century Klausenburg was once again at {{the centre of the}} development and spread of art in Transylvania, as it <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>two</b> centuries earlier. The first enthusiasts for Baroque were the Catholic Church and the landed aristocracy. Artists came initially from south Germany and Austria, {{but by the end of}} the century most of the work was by local craftsmen. The earliest signs of the new style appear in the furnishings of St. Michael's church: the altarpieces and pulpit, which date to the 1740s, are carved, painted and richly decorated with figures. An altarpiece depicting the Adoration of the Magi (1748–50) is the work of Franz Anton Maulbertsch. The earliest two-towered Baroque church was built by the Jesuits from 1718 to 1724 on the pattern of Košice and was later handed over to the Piarists. During the century more simply designed Baroque churches were built for the mendicant orders, Lutherans, Unitarians and the Orthodox Church. The noble families built houses and even palaces in the old town. The Baroque Bánffy Palace (1774–1785), constructed around a rectangular yard, is the masterpiece of Eberhardt Blaumann. Its peculiarity lies in {{the appearance}} of the principal façade.|$|E
5|$|The {{strength}} of the Seventh and Eighth Ottoman Armies, before the attack at Beersheba on 31 October, was estimated to have been 45,000 rifles, 1,500 sabres and 300 guns. This force had been {{made up of the}} Seventh Army's incomplete III Corps. The III Corps' 24th Infantry Division was at Kauwukah (near Hareira–Sheria) and its 27th Infantry Division was at Beersheba. Its 3rd Cavalry Division, as well as the 16th, 19th, and 24th Infantry Divisions were also in the area to the east of the Gaza–Beersheba line. The Seventh Army was commanded by Fevzi Çakmak. The Eighth Army's XXII Corps (3rd and 53rd Infantry Divisions) was based at Gaza while its XX Corps (16th, 26th and 54th Infantry Divisions) was based at Sheria in the centre of the Gaza–Beersheba line. Supporting these two corps <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>two</b> reserve divisions; the 7th and 19th Infantry Divisions. The Eighth Army was commanded by Friedrich Freiherr Kress von Kressenstein and at that time had an estimated 2,894 officers; 69,709 men; 29,116 rifles; 403 machine-guns and 268 guns.|$|E
