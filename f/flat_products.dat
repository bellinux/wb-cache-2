50|$|In 2003, Lisco {{exported}} 373 kn of {{finished products}} (48.5% of production). 881 kn of various products were exported in 2004, including 477 kn of HBI (54% of exports) and 72 kn of rebar. It {{is considered the}} only Arab company manufacturing this material. <b>Flat</b> <b>products</b> were 59% of exports in 2004. Europe received about 64.4% followed by Asian and Arab countries. Higher domestic demand for rebar resulted in exports declining to 20 kn in 2004. Exports {{in the first half}} of 2005 was approximately 384 kn; mostly HBI (54%) and <b>flat</b> <b>products</b> (31.7%). Exports fell for long products (81%), <b>flat</b> <b>products</b> (20%) and HBI (5%). This drop is due to the fact that the company stopped exporting rebar as well as a global recession, which led to a demand contraction for iron and steel products, particularly hot-rolled coils and HBI. Exports in 2006 exceeded one million tons, including 449 kn of <b>flat</b> <b>products.</b> During the first quarter of 2006 Lisco increased hot-rolled coils exports by 125% and exported sponge iron for the first time.|$|E

The current study aims to determine the variation of the deflection in rolls in a two high mill with varying percentage reduction of the sheet i. e, 20 %, 25 % and 30 % on annealed and non-annealed IF steel sheet and analyzing possible solutions to reduce the elastic deflection of rolls with special emphasis on cambering and modelling of the same in Abaqus CAE...|$|R

5000|$|When Nucor—now one of {{the largest}} steel {{producers}} in the U.S.—decided to enter the long products market in 1969, they chose to start up a mini-mill, with an EAF as its steelmaking furnace, soon followed by other manufacturers. Whilst Nucor expanded rapidly in the Eastern US, the companies that followed them into mini-mill operations concentrated on local markets for long products, where the use of an EAF allowed the plants to vary production according to local demand. This pattern was also followed globally, with EAF steel production primarily used for long products, while integrated mills, using blast furnaces and basic oxygen furnaces, cornered the markets for [...] "flat products"—sheet steel and heavier steel plate. In 1987, Nucor made the decision to expand into the <b>flat</b> <b>products</b> market, still using the EAF production method.|$|E

40|$|Homoscedasticity for defect {{detection}} in homogeneous <b>flat</b> surface <b>products</b> Hazem M Raafat 1 and AS Tolba 2 Homoscedasticity of homogeneous <b>flat</b> surface <b>products</b> is {{a necessary}} condition for a high quality product. The quality of homogeneous <b>flat</b> surface <b>products,</b> like paper sheets, steel slabs, textiles, and glasses, plays a crucial role in raising the profile of the manufacturing companies. This paper presents a new approach for defect detection using the Levene’s test, which is used for testing the homogeneity of variances of samples drawn from the same population. It is assumed that the variances of samples taken from the same population are equal. Occurrence of defects results in a Levene’s test measure that is higher than some critical value indicating that the null hypothesis of equal variances is rejected. Noise immunity of the proposed technique is ensured through pre-filtering the fabric image using the Wiener filter that is an edge preser-ving filter. The robustness to variations of the sliding window size and the structures of fabric is analyzed. The major advantages of the proposed technique are the low computational complexity and noise immunity while maintaining high accuracy. Keyword...|$|R
