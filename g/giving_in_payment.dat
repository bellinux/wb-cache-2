5|$|The first trade dollars {{were struck}} in 1873, and the {{majority}} of the coins were sent to China. Eventually, bullion producers began converting large amounts of silver into trade dollars, causing the coins to make their way into American commercial channels. This caused frustration among those to whom they were <b>given</b> <b>in</b> <b>payment,</b> as the coins were largely maligned and traded for less than one dollar each. In response to their wide distribution in American commerce, the coins were officially demonetized in 1876, but continued to circulate. Production of business strikes ended in 1878, though the mintage of proof coins officially continued until 1883.

Next to a rigorous execution of justice on the violators of peace, the establishment of commerce with the Indian nations in behalf of the United States {{is most likely to}} conciliate their attachment. But it ought to be conducted without fraud, without extortion, with constant and plentiful supplies, with a ready market for the commodities of the Indians and a stated price for what they <b>give</b> <b>in</b> <b>payment</b> and receive <b>in</b> exchange.

60|$|Our {{fashion of}} {{offering}} hospitality on the impulse {{would be as}} strange here as offering it without some special inducement for its acceptance. The inducement is, as often as can be, a celebrity or eccentricity of some sort, or some visiting foreigner; and I suppose that I {{have been a good}} deal used myself in one quality or the other. But when the thing has been done, fully and guardedly at all points, {{it does not seem to}} have been done for pleasure, either by the host or the guest. The dinner is <b>given</b> <b>in</b> <b>payment</b> of another dinner; or out of ambition by people who are striving to get forward in society; or by great social figures who give regularly a certain number of dinners every season. In either case it is eaten from motives at once impersonal and selfish. I do not mean to say that I have not been at many dinners where I felt nothing perfunctory either in host or guest, and where as sweet and gay a spirit ruled as at any of our own simple feasts. Still, I think our main impression of American hospitality would be that it was thoroughly infused with the plutocratic principle, and that it meant business.|$|R
30|$|In this paper, an {{integrated}} production-inventory model is presented for a supplier, manufacturer, and retailer supply chain under conditionally permissible delay <b>in</b> <b>payments</b> <b>in</b> uncertain environments. The supplier produces the item {{at a certain}} rate, which is a decision variable, and purchases the item to the manufacturer. The manufacturer has also purchased and produced the item in a finite rate. The manufacturer sells the product to the retailer and also <b>gives</b> the delay <b>in</b> <b>payment</b> to the retailer. The retailer purchases the item from the manufacture {{to sell it to}} the customers. Ideal costs of supplier, manufacturer, and retailer have been taken into account. An integrated model has been developed and solved analytically in crisp and uncertain environments, and finally, corresponding individual profits are calculated numerically and graphically.|$|R

Upon joining the show full-time, numerous episodes revolved around the fictional Ronnie Burns' dating and social life.

At first, he planned to make a feature-length seven-chapter serial, which he would release independently. He {{eventually}} decided to make only a six-minute teaser instead, as it would take him several decades to create the backgrounds for a full-length feature. He set up a blue-screen in his apartment, and some of his friends acted in the roles. He created the backgrounds for the black and white short over the course of four years with his Mac computer. He could not afford a good computer or equipment, so he used equipment <b>given</b> him <b>in</b> <b>payment</b> for projects that he worked on, such as desktop publishing of articles. His computer (including the equipment he earned) was outdated and slow. He dropped out of society, and spent all of his free time creating the short, working only enough to support himself and his project. He later remarked that he [...] "had no life", and would sometimes hide under his desk in a fetal position, feeling tempted to give up on his project.|$|R

5000|$|Broad Pieces were {{gold coins}} in {{denominations}} of 23 or 25 shillings. A royal proclamation in February 1732 had prohibited people from <b>giving</b> or receiving <b>in</b> <b>payment</b> Broad Pieces, or {{halves or quarters}} of them, and had required revenue collectors to collect them in order {{that they could be}} melted down and made into new gold coins. To encourage people to surrender their coins, the revenue collectors were authorised to purchase them at favourable rates, which unintentionally created an incentive for people to counterfeit them. Accordingly, an Act of Parliament was passed which made it treason to counterfeit them, or to [...] "utter or vend any of the said gold coins, knowing them to be so forged, coounterfeited or coined as aforesaid." [...] There was a £40 reward for anyone whose information led to someone being convicted of treason under the Act, and any convicted traitor was to be automatically pardoned if he informed on somebody else and the person informed on was convicted.|$|R
5000|$|Also {{appearing}} in the TV series were Burns and Allen's two children. Ronnie, adopted in 1935, and Sandra, adopted the year before, {{first appeared in the}} third-season episode, [...] "Uncle Clyde Comes to Visit" [...] (January 1, 1953), playing themselves. The teenagers are in the Burns living room, threading a 16 mm projector with that night's episode. In voiceover, George introduces them, and tells the audience that they have been away at school and that is why we have not met them before. Ronnie made a guest appearance on the episode, [...] "Gracie <b>Gives</b> Wedding <b>in</b> <b>Payment</b> of a Favor" [...] (October 18, 1954), playing a character named Jim Goodwin, and was introduced to the audience at the episode's conclusion. Ronnie joined the regular cast October 10, 1955, playing himself, but cast as a young drama student who tended to look askance at his parents' comedy style. Their daughter, Sandra, declined becoming a regular member of the cast, although she appeared in a few episodes as a classmate of Ronnie. In one episode, Ronnie's drama class puts on a vaudeville show to raise funds for the school. Gracie hosts the show while Ronnie and Sandy deliver an impersonation of their famous parents along with one of their classic routines. Since Ronnie played himself, Gracie closed the segment with a wisecrack: [...] "The boy was produced by Burns and Allen." ...|$|R
60|$|Such {{being the}} {{abstract}} theory of just remunerative payment, its application is practically modified {{by the fact}} that the order for labour, <b>given</b> <b>in</b> <b>payment,</b> is general, while the labour received is special. The current coin or document is practically an order on the nation for so much work of any kind; and this universal applicability to immediate need renders it so much more valuable than special labour can be, that an order for a less quantity of this general toil will always be accepted as a just equivalent for a greater quantity of special toil. Any given craftsman will always be willing to give an hour of his own work in order to receive command over half an hour, or even much less, of national work. This source of uncertainty, together with the difficulty of determining the monetary value of skill,[40] renders the ascertainment (even approximate) of the proper wages of any <b>given</b> labour <b>in</b> terms of currency, matter of considerable complexity. But they do not affect the principle of exchange. The worth of the work may not be easily known; but it has a worth, just as fixed and real as the specific gravity of a substance, though such specific gravity may not be easily ascertainable when the substance is united with many others. Nor is there so much difficulty or chance in determining it as in determining the ordinary maxima and minima of vulgar political economy. There are few bargains in which the buyer can ascertain with anything like precision that the seller would have taken no less;--or the seller acquire more than a comfortable faith that the purchaser would have given no more. This impossibility of precise knowledge prevents neither from striving to attain the desired point of greatest vexation and injury to the other, nor from accepting it for a scientific principle that he is to buy for the least and sell for the most possible, though what the real least or most may be he cannot tell. In like manner, a just person lays it down for a scientific principle that he is to pay a just price, and, without being able precisely to ascertain the limits of such a price, will nevertheless strive to attain the closest possible approximation to them. A practically serviceable approximation he can obtain. It is easier to determine scientifically what a man ought to have for his work, than what his necessities will compel him to take for it. His necessities can only be ascertained by empirical, but his due by analytical, investigation. In the one case, you try your answer to the sum like a puzzled schoolboy--till you find one that fits; in the other, you bring out your result within certain limits, by process of calculation.|$|R

5|$|Diocletian's {{expansion}} {{of the army and}} civil service meant that the empire's tax burden grew. Since military upkeep took the largest portion of the imperial budget, any reforms here would be especially costly. The proportion of the adult male population, excluding slaves, serving in the army increased from roughly 1 in 25 to 1 in 15, an increase judged excessive by some modern commentators. Official troop allowances were kept to low levels, and the mass of troops often resorted to extortion or the taking of civilian jobs. Arrears became the norm for most troops. Many were even <b>given</b> <b>payment</b> <b>in</b> kind in place of their salaries. Were he unable to pay for his enlarged army, there would likely be civil conflict, potentially open revolt.

In this paper, {{we study}} the transformations of the French {{monetary}} system 1848 - 1876. We first discuss {{the claim that}} bimetallism until 1873 provided the Bank of France with means to make limited use of the discount rate, and find it largely unfounded, {{at least for the}} period 1848 - 1870. We argue that the Bank of France always favoured informal methods to manage the Paris money market, but that bimetallism did not generally facilitate such techniques. Paradoxically, the emergence of the gold standard, which was introduced in France as a practice more than as a rule, gave to the Bank of France increased autonomy.
