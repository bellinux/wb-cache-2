500|$|The {{authenticity}} of the love triangle was [...] "very important" [...] to Weingartner, who was once part of such a relationship. Although the actors were uncertain at first that Peter could forgive Jan and Jule's betrayal, Weingartner uses the situation to explore his concept of friendship: [...] "Friendship means more to him than bourgeois moral values. Peter loves Jule – he doesn't own her. He can tell that when she {{falls in love with}} Jan, their love <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> <b>thing,</b> coloured by a joint rebellion – a shared rejection of social constraint." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} {{generally}} received well by critics. Jesus Freak Hideout editor John DiBiase {{called it a}} [...] "powerful anthem" [...] {{and said that the}} opening track was [...] "merely the tip of the iceberg" [...] for the album's quality among the other tracks. Bob Felberg of The Phantom Tollbooth was favorable towards the song, saying, [...] "'Unbreakable'...is one of the strongest Christian rock songs in a long time, both in music and lyrics", and that it featured [...] "a slinky-like guitar and strings interacting before slamming rhythms blow your hair straight back". In response to [...] "Unbreakable" [...] being featured on NBC's Bionic Woman, The Phantom Tollbooth's second reviewer Bert Saraco said, [...] "Mainstream attention <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> <b>thing,</b> of course, but often signals a necessarily generic element to a project that sometimes sends out danger signals as to its artistic or creative potential." [...] Tony Cummings of Cross Rhythms magazine said that the song was [...] "excellent".|$|E

2500|$|Beatles for Sale was the Beatles' fourth album {{release in}} the space of 21 months. Neil Aspinall, the band's road manager, later reflected: [...] "No band today would come off a long US tour at the end of September, go into the studio and start a new album, still writing songs, and then go on a UK tour, finish the album in five weeks, still touring, and have the album out in time for Christmas. But that's what the Beatles did at the end of 1964. A lot of it was down to naiveté, {{thinking}} that this was the way things were done. If the record company needs another album, you go and make one." [...] Noting the subdued and melancholy tone of much of the album, producer George Martin recalled: [...] "They were rather war weary during Beatles for Sale. One must remember that they'd been battered like mad throughout 1964, and much of 1963. Success <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> <b>thing</b> but it is very, very tiring." ...|$|E
