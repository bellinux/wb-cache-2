5|$|Farmer {{moved from}} trumpet to playing mostly flugelhorn {{from the early}} 1960s, utilising the latter instrument's more mellow sound and Farmer's ability {{to get what he}} wanted from it without having to use a mute. In 1989, he played a major part in {{creating}} a trumpet–flugelhorn hybrid, the flumpet, which was constructed <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>by</b> instrument maker David Monette. This instrument allowed him to play with more expression in a range of settings, from small groups to big bands. In 1997, Monette presented him with a personalized flumpet, with decorations symbolising important people and places in Farmer's life.|$|E
5|$|In December 1903 Mark Twain, {{who opposed}} vivisection, {{published}} a short story, A Dog's Tale, in Harper's, written {{from the point}} of view of a dog whose puppy is experimented on and killed. Given the timing and Twain's views, the story may have been inspired by the libel trial, according to Mark Twain scholar Shelley Fisher Fishkin. Coleridge ordered 3,000 copies of A Dog's Tale, which were specially printed <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>by</b> Harper's.|$|E

5|$|On a {{personal}} level, Grace was still unqualified {{as a doctor}} and had a growing family to support, his daughter Bessie being born in May. When not playing cricket, he had to study a backlog of medical theory. He did not qualify as a doctor {{until the end of}} the following year. He then needed a practice and this was effectively purchased <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>by</b> MCC in 1878 after they launched a National Testimonial on his behalf, though the underlying and hopeful purpose of the appeal was to terminate Grace's embarrassing mercenary activity.|$|E
5|$|Thorpe was memorialized in the Warner Bros. film Jim Thorpe – All-American (1951) {{starring}} Burt Lancaster, with Billy Gray {{performing as}} Thorpe as a child. The film {{was directed by}} Michael Curtiz. Although there were rumors that Thorpe received no money, he was paid $15,000 by Warner Bros. plus a $2,500 donation toward an annuity <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>by</b> the studio head of publicity. The movie included archival footage of the 1912 and 1932 Olympics. Thorpe was seen in one scene as a coaching assistant. It was also distributed in the United Kingdom, where it was called Man of Bronze.|$|E

5|$|According to Australian court documents, on 10 January 2006, the Šibenik County Court {{ordered that}} a warrant be issued for Vasiljković's arrest. The {{offences}} listed were two alleged war crimes against prisoners of war, and one alleged war crime against the civilian population. The latter {{are related to}} {{his role in the}} attack on Glina which caused civilian deaths and injuries. He was arrested in Australia in 2006, but as an Australian national, he appealed against extradition to Croatia claiming that he would not get a fair trial there. The appeal was granted by the Federal Court in 2009, and Vasiljković was released. However, the High Court of Australia overturned the decision and Vasiljković was arrested after a 43-day search <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>by</b> the police. Subsequently, Vasiljković appealed against his extradition citing other grounds. His extradition was approved by the Minister for Home Affairs Jason Clare in November 2012, however Vasiljković appealed that decision as well. In December 2014, the Federal Court upheld Clare's decision.|$|E
5|$|Archibald, 5th Earl of Rosebery, born in 1847, had {{inherited}} his title from his grandfather in 1868, when aged 21, {{together with an}} income of £30,000 a year. He owned 40,000acres (160km²) in Scotland, and land in Norfolk, Hertfordshire, and Kent. His father had {{died when he was}} eight and he had been brought up by his mother, who had subsequently married Harry Powlett, 4th Duke of Cleveland. His mother was a distant figure, and their relationship was always strained. The Earls of Rosebery, whose family name was Primrose, were old, if undistinguished, members of the Scottish aristocracy. Rosebery was considered to be strikingly handsome and immensely cultivated. He was highly intelligent, and a brilliant future was forecast <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>by</b> his tutors at both Eton and Christ Church, Oxford.|$|E
5|$|Childermass {{meanwhile}} eventually {{receives the}} message meant <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>by</b> Strange and {{uses it to}} break the enchantment over Lady Pole. Enraged by this, the gentleman with the thistledown hair intends to place a second deadly curse on Lady Pole, as Faerie tradition demands. En route, he murders Vinculus after they encounter him, with Stephen Black forced to watch. During these events, Norrell and Strange attempt a spell that would cause the nature forces of England {{to pay homage to}} John Uskglass. Not knowing his true name, they dedicate it to the 'nameless slave'. However, the two magicians' belief that this is Uskglass is mistaken, and instead the power is devoted to Stephen. He uses his momentary control of England to destroy the man with the thistledown hair, before Stephen, travelling through one of the newly opened Faerie roads, becomes the new king of the now blossoming Lost-Hope.|$|E

5|$|Concerned {{that the}} German Army posed {{a threat to}} Petrograd, in March 1918 Sovnarkom {{relocated}} to Moscow, initially as a temporary measure. There, Lenin, Trotsky, and other Bolshevik leaders moved into the Kremlin, where Lenin lived {{with his wife and}} sister Maria in a first floor apartment adjacent to the room in which the Sovnarkom meetings were held. Lenin disliked Moscow, but rarely left the city centre during the rest of his life. It was in the city in August 1918 that he survived a second assassination attempt; he was shot following a public speech and injured badly. A Socialist Revolutionary, Fanny Kaplan, was arrested and executed. The attack was widely covered in the Russian press, generating much sympathy for him and boosting his popularity. As a respite, in September 1918 Lenin was driven to the Gorki estate, just outside Moscow, recently acquired <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>by</b> the government.|$|E
5|$|Cristóbal de Olid sailed from Mexico in January 1524, {{stopping}} off in Cuba to collect supplies set aside <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>by</b> Cortés. The governor of Cuba, Diego Velázquez, was {{an enemy of}} Cortés and persuaded Olid to take Honduras for himself. Olid arrived off northern Honduras in early May, some distance {{to the east of}} Puerto de Caballos. He disembarked with 360 Spaniards and 22 horses, and founded Triunfo de la Cruz, still known by this name, near the modern port of Tela. He claimed the new territory in Cortés' name, but after founding the new town he openly rejected him, {{with the support of the}} majority of his men. He then carried out a campaign of conquest in what is now western Honduras, subjugating the heavily populated towns of Naco and Tencoa, which did little to resist.|$|E
5|$|Faced {{with this}} information, Master Chief and Cortana decide to destroy Halo to prevent its activation. While {{fighting}} the Flood, the Covenant, and Guilty Spark's Sentinels, Cortana discovers {{that the best}} way to accomplish this is to cause the crashed Pillar of Autumn to self-destruct. However, Captain Keyes' authorization is required to destroy the Autumn, forcing the Chief and Cortana to return to the now-Flood-infested Truth and Reconciliation to search <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> <b>By</b> the time they reach Keyes, however, he has been infected beyond the point of no return by the Flood. Master Chief retrieves Keyes' neural implants directly from his brain and retreats to the Autumn, where Cortana activates the ship's self-destruct sequence. However, 343 Guilty Spark reappears and deactivates the countdown, discovering the record of human history in the process. Master Chief manually destabilizes the Pillar of Autumns fusion reactors, and he and Cortana narrowly escape the destruction of the ring via a fighter. Cortana scans nearby space and finds that they are apparently the only survivors. Cortana justifies the sacrifices of the other humans on Halo, stating that they had no choice due to the threat posed by Halo, the Covenant and the Flood. Cortana believes it's over but the Master Chief tells her that they're just getting started.|$|E
50|$|As he {{was gaining}} wider interest, {{he asked his}} older sister, who was a tailor, to make a tailcoat in black <b>for</b> <b>him,</b> {{inspired}} <b>by</b> {{a photo of the}} renowned Turkish stage magician Zati Sungur.|$|R

5|$|Following his {{retirement}} on 30 November 1976 {{he continued to}} work, both at the Museum and at the Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew, where his home at 17 High Park Road, Kew Gardens, Richmond (see image), gave him access to the herbarium and library, a short bicycle trip away. Indeed, 35% of his total publications appeared in the quarter century of {{his retirement}}. He was commissioned to write {{a history of the}} Museum for its centenary (1981), although he did so with some difficulty, due to deadlines and budget constraints. The task, which took three years, was made more difficult <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>by</b> the Museum's decision to censor his critical comments. He continued his association with the Lindley Library all his life, being an active committee member and regularly attended RHS flower shows even after he was barely able to walk.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his term}} as governor, Scott retired to his Canewood estate {{with his wife}} and {{youngest}} step-daughter, Mary Cecil Gist. Two of his stepdaughters had married during his term as governor. Anna Maria Gist married Captain Nathaniel G. S. Hart in 1809; Hart was killed in the River Raisin Massacre in January 1813. Eliza Violet Gist married Francis Preston Blair on July 21, 1812, just prior to the expiration of Scott's term as governor. The governor opined that Blair, who was slightly built, stoop-shouldered, and suffering from tuberculosis, would leave Eliza a widow within six months. Blair, however, survived the tuberculosis and {{went on to become a}} trusted advisor to President Andrew Jackson. He outlived Scott's prediction <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>by</b> more than sixty years.|$|E
5|$|His elder {{daughter}} Elizabeth, {{the heir}} presumptive, took on more royal duties as her father's health deteriorated. The delayed tour was re-organised, with Elizabeth and her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, taking {{the place of}} the King and Queen. The King was well enough to open the Festival of Britain in May 1951, but on 23 September 1951, his left lung was removed by Clement Price Thomas after a malignant tumour was found. In October 1951, Princess Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh went on a month-long tour of Canada; the trip had been delayed for a week due to the King's illness. At the State Opening of Parliament in November, the King's speech from the throne was read <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>by</b> the Lord Chancellor, Lord Simonds. His Christmas broadcast of 1951 was recorded in sections, and then edited together.|$|E
50|$|During 2003 {{and early}} 2004, Amtsakhara lobbied for President Ardzinba to step down. In late 2003, they had asked {{parliament}} {{to come up}} with a means <b>for</b> impeaching <b>him</b> <b>by</b> mid-December, but this did not occur.|$|R
