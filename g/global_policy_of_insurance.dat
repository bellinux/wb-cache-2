Programs written in these languages enforce a strong, <b>global</b> <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> noninterference which ensures that high-security data will not be observable on low-security channels. Because noninterference is typically too strong a property, most programs use some form of declassification to selectively leak high security information, e. g. when performing a password check or data encryption. Unfortunately, such a declassification is often expressed as an operation within a given program, rather than as part <b>of</b> a <b>global</b> <b>policy,</b> making reasoning about the security implications <b>of</b> a <b>policy</b> more difficult.
