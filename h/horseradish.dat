5|$|Meat, {{removed from}} the stock on which the borscht was based, may be cut into smaller chunks and either added back into the soup or served on the side with <b>horseradish</b> or mustard.

5|$|The bulb of the radish {{is usually}} eaten raw, {{although}} tougher specimens can be steamed. The raw flesh has a crisp texture and a pungent, peppery flavor, caused by glucosinolates and the enzyme myrosinase, which combine when chewed to form allyl isothiocyanates, {{also present in}} mustard, <b>horseradish,</b> and wasabi.|$|E
5|$|The Bulletin {{noted that}} a 2011 edition of the drink {{produced}} in Oregon was made with bacon vodka manufactured on site at the restaurant The Blacksmith. A report by The Sarasota Herald-Tribune in April 2012 observed that a variety on the cocktail made by mixologist Paul Yeomans in Florida was concocted utilizing bacon salt and tomato water, infused with cucumber vodka. This version was a favorite selection among customers at The Table Creekside in Sarasota, Florida. The Food Network recommended additional ingredients including lemon juice, bourbon, Worcestershire sauce, and <b>horseradish.</b>|$|E
5|$|As the {{traditional}} method of making borscht with beet sour often requires planning {{at least several}} days ahead, many recipes for quicker borscht replace the beet sour with fresh beetroot juice, while the sour taste is imparted by other ingredients, such as vinegar, lemon juice or citric acid, tomatoes, tart apples, dry red wine, dill pickle juice, sauerkraut juice, or a fermented rye flour and water mixture. The soup is typically flavored with {{a wide selection of}} herbs, spices and condiments. Salt, black pepper, garlic, bay leaves and dill are among the most commonly used. Other aromatics often added to borscht include allspice, celery stalks, parsley, marjoram, hot peppers, saffron, <b>horseradish,</b> ginger and prunes. Some recipes require flour or roux to further thicken the borscht. A common opinion is that a good borscht should be thick enough for a spoon to stand upright in it.|$|E

25|$|In Germany, {{licensed}} {{physicians are}} allowed to prescribe the herbal antibiotic, Angocin Anti-Infekt N, made from only nasturtium and <b>horseradish</b> root. One study showed its effectiveness in reducing symptoms of acute sinusitis, bronchitis, and urinary tract infections (UTI) within 2 to 7 percentage points of standard antibiotics with their higher side effects.|$|E
25|$|<b>Horseradish</b> is {{perennial}} in hardiness zones 2–9 and can {{be grown}} as an annual in other zones, although not as successfully as in zones with both a long growing season and winter temperatures cold enough to ensure plant dormancy. After the first frost in autumn kills the leaves, the root is dug and divided. The main root is harvested and one or more large offshoots of the main root are replanted to produce next year's crop. <b>Horseradish</b> left undisturbed in the garden spreads via underground shoots {{and can be}}come invasive. Older roots left in the ground become woody, after which {{they are no longer}} culinarily useful, although older plants can be dug and re-divided to start new plants. The early season leaves can be distinctively different, asymmetric spiky, before the mature typical flat broad leaves start to be developed.|$|E
25|$|The enzyme <b>horseradish</b> {{peroxidase}} (HRP), {{found in}} the plant, is used extensively in molecular biology and biochemistry primarily {{for its ability to}} amplify a weak signal and increase detectability of a target molecule. HRP has been used in decades of research to visualize under microscopy and assess non-quantitatively the permeability of capillaries, particularly those of the brain.|$|E
25|$|SOD is commercially {{obtained}} from marine phytoplankton, bovine liver, <b>horseradish,</b> cantaloupe, and certain bacteria. For therapeutic purpose, SOD is usually injected locally. There {{is no evidence}} that ingestion of unprotected SOD or SOD-rich foods can have any physiological effects: as all ingested SOD is broken down into amino acids before being absorbed. However, ingestion of SOD bound to wheat proteins could improve its therapeutic activity, at least in theory.|$|E
25|$|Kholodets (or Studen'): Jellied chopped {{pieces of}} pork or veal meat with some spices added (pepper, parsley, garlic, bay leaf) and minor amounts of {{vegetables}} (carrots, onions). The meat is boiled in large pieces {{for long periods}} of time, then chopped, boiled a few times again and finally chilled for 3–4 hours (hence the name) forming a jelly mass, though gelatin is not used because calves' feet, pigs' heads and other such offal is gelatinous enough on its own. It is served with <b>horseradish,</b> mustard, or ground garlic with smetana.|$|E
