25|$|Wright {{expressed}} the following sentiments regarding the CLMC death threat {{in an interview}} he conducted with journalist Emer Woodful in late August 1996:My {{heart goes out to}} my family at a time like this. Well, if you think you're right, then you're right. Although I have done nothing wrong except express an opinion that's the prevalent opinion of the people of Northern Ireland and I will always do that, dear, no matter what the price. Well, I've been prepared to die for long many a year. I don't wish to die, {{but at the end of}} the day no one will force their opinions <b>down</b> <b>my</b> <b>throat</b> – no one.|$|E
2500|$|A Cychrus rostratus once {{squirted}} into my eye & gave me extreme pain; & I {{must tell}} you what happened to me {{on the banks of the}} Cam in my early entomological days; under a piece of bark I found two carabi (I forget which) & caught one in each hand, when lo & behold I saw a sacred Panagæus crux major; I could not bear to give up either of my Carabi, & to lose Panagæus was out of the question, so that in despair I gently seized one of the carabi between my teeth, when to my unspeakable disgust & pain the little inconsiderate beast squirted his acid <b>down</b> <b>my</b> <b>throat</b> & I lost both Carabi & Panagæus! ...|$|E
6000|$|... {{and to all}} {{the rest}} of Rockingham; as the wine went <b>down</b> <b>my</b> <b>throat,</b> I felt {{distinctly}} that it was [...] "changing those thoughts to madness." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are {{as bad as}} Claverhouse," [...] {{said the}} Major, [...] "who contended {{yesterday}} morning <b>down</b> <b>my</b> very <b>throat,</b> that this young fellow, who is as high-spirited and gentleman-like a boy as I have ever known, wanted but an opportunity to place himself {{at the head of}} the rebels." ...|$|R
6000|$|Gearson {{came again}} next afternoon, looking pale and rather sick, but quite himself, even to his languid irony. [...] "I guess I'd better tell you, Editha, that I consecrated myself to your god of battles last night by pouring too many libations to him <b>down</b> <b>my</b> own <b>throat.</b> But I'm all right now. One has {{to carry off}} the excitement, somehow." ...|$|R
60|$|Suddenly I heard a sound. I sat {{upright and}} listened. I made no movement. The little noises died <b>down</b> in <b>my</b> <b>throat,</b> and I sat as one petrified. The sound drew closer. It {{was like the}} grunt of a pig. Then I began to hear the sounds caused by the moving of a body through the brush. Next I saw the ferns {{agitated}} by {{the passage of the}} body. Then the ferns parted, and I saw gleaming eyes, a long snout, and white tusks.|$|R
60|$|Even as I spoke, {{somebody}} else raised {{my head and}} poured something <b>down</b> <b>my</b> <b>throat.</b> I swallowed it with a gulp. Then I opened my eyes again.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{you tell}} him," [...] a subdued voice said, and the man, who I think was Steel, came near choking {{me as he}} poured more spirit than I could swallow <b>down</b> <b>my</b> <b>throat</b> and also down my neck.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh my word! Fancy me telling him! He'd jump <b>down</b> <b>my</b> <b>throat</b> {{with both}} feet afore I'd opened my mouth. He's not to be spoken to, he isn't. He's my-lord, he is. You mustn't look, or you're done for." ...|$|E
60|$|Had I lacked imagination, had I been stupid, had I been stubbornly mulish {{in having}} my own way, I {{should never have}} got in this pickle. And the lads and lassies were dancing, {{and there was no}} one to save me from my fate. How much I drank I do not know. My memory of it is of an age-long {{suffering}} of fear in the midst of a murderous crew, and of an infinite number of glasses of red wine passing across the bare boards of a wine-drenched table and going <b>down</b> <b>my</b> burning <b>throat.</b> Bad as the wine was, a knife in the back was worse, and I must survive at any cost.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, by cramming it <b>down</b> <b>my</b> children's <b>throats.</b> But what I {{complain}} of, Jane, in {{the young}} folk that come across me is not over-knowledge, but want of knowledge--want of general culture. This Dolores, for instance, can do what she has been taught better than Mysie, some tings better than Gillian, but she has absolutely no interest in general knowledge, {{not even in the}} glaciers which she has seen; she does not know whether Homer wrote in Greek or Latin, considers [...] "Marmion' a lesson, cannot tell a planet from a star, and neither knows nor cares anything about the two Napoleons. Now we seem to have breathed in such things. Why! I remember being made into Astyanax for a very unwilling Andromache (poor Eleanor) for caress, and being told to shudder at the bright copper coal-scuttle, before Harry went to school.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'D'you know,' he said, 'if--if you'd chucked me--I {{should have}} gone <b>down</b> to <b>my</b> cabin after breakfast and cut <b>my</b> <b>throat.</b> And now--it's like a dream--a good dream, you know.' ...|$|R
60|$|Then they washed me, and, having dressed my hurts, laid me {{on a bed}} {{near the}} fire that warmth might come back to me. But Freydisa would not suffer them to give me {{anything}} save a little hot milk which she poured <b>down</b> <b>my</b> <b>throat.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no," [...] said Moseley, internally, as {{he paced}} {{up and down}} his father's library, [...] "my lady dowager, {{you are not going to}} force a wife <b>down</b> <b>my</b> <b>throat.</b> If you do, I am mistaken; and Grace, if Grace"--John {{softened}} and began to feel unhappy a little, but anger prevailed.|$|E
60|$|When I came {{to myself}} again, it was daylight. I saw the calm, gentle face of Qros bending over {{me as he}} poured some strong fluid <b>down</b> <b>my</b> <b>throat</b> that seemed to shoot through all my body, and melt a curtain in my mind. I saw also that beside him stood Ayesha.|$|E
60|$|We {{entered the}} room all together, almost on tiptoe. If we had been wearing hats I am sure {{that we should have}} taken them off. How, with such trifling means at her command, she could have left behind in that tiny chamber so potent an {{impression}} of daintiness and comfort I cannot tell. But there it was. Her little bed, with its spotless counterpane, was hung with pink muslin. There was a lace spread upon her toilet-table, on which her little oddments of silver made a brave show. Only one thing seemed out of place, a worn little slipper peeping out from under a chair. I thrust it into my pocket. The others took some trifle from the table. Then, as silently as we had entered, we left the room. As I turned the key I choked <b>down</b> something in <b>my</b> <b>throat,</b> and did <b>my</b> best to laugh--a little unnaturally, I am afraid.|$|R
6000|$|A knot rose in <b>my</b> <b>throat</b> and paralysed awhile my speech. Then with {{a sudden}} sob, I sprang forward and hobbled to her upon my wounded feet. I flung myself <b>down</b> upon <b>my</b> knees, buried my head in her lap, and all that I could cry was: ...|$|R
60|$|I was {{all this}} while chafing at the part I played, and sitting tongue-tied between shame and merriment; but somehow at this I could hold in no longer, and bade Alan let me be, for I was better already. My voice stuck in <b>my</b> <b>throat,</b> for I ever hated {{to take part in}} lies; but my very embarrassment helped on the plot, for the lass no doubt set <b>down</b> <b>my</b> husky voice to {{sickness}} and fatigue.|$|R
6000|$|... "You see, I {{am quite}} amenable," [...] he said. [...] "And now, don't {{you think that}} as I am a very small man, and feeling {{exceedingly}} unwell from the stuff on the handkerchief which that nigger of yours thrust <b>down</b> <b>my</b> <b>throat,</b> {{and there are two}} of you, both big fellows, you could loosen my cords for me? This is damned uncomfortable, and I hate the melodramatic appearance of it." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{would have}} {{clutched}} at anything {{that looked like}} a life-line that morning. I swallowed the stuff. For a moment I felt as if somebody had touched off a bomb inside the old bean and was strolling <b>down</b> <b>my</b> <b>throat</b> with a lighted torch, and then everything seemed suddenly to get all right. The sun shone in through the window; birds twittered in the tree-tops; and, generally speaking, hope dawned once more.|$|E
60|$|Dimly, very dimly, I {{became aware}} that I was being carried. I heard voices in my ears, but what they said I could not understand. Then a feeling of light struck upon my eyeballs which gave me great pain. Agony ran all through me as it does through the limbs of one who is being brought back from death by drowning. After this {{something}} warm was poured <b>down</b> <b>my</b> <b>throat,</b> and I went to sleep.|$|E
5000|$|Lump In <b>My</b> <b>Throat</b> which included; Lump In <b>My</b> <b>throat,</b> Under The Stairs, The City Blurs In Your Eyes, Lump In <b>My</b> <b>Throat</b> (James Ford remix) and Be My Enemy live at Lamcq.|$|R
60|$|Certain it is, however, that no alarm {{was raised}} {{even when the}} {{sergeant}} came to my relief, and in silence, save for the rustling of the foliage as we swayed to this side or that, the battle was continued until I felt the cruel fingers about <b>my</b> <b>throat</b> suddenly relax, while a warm liquid of a peculiar, salty odor poured <b>down</b> over <b>my</b> neck and head.|$|R
6000|$|... "Shall I {{tell you}} why, really?" [...] he asked. [...] "Because you saved me--I don't know what from. The night {{we went out}} I was {{suffering}} from a loneliness which was the worst torture I have ever felt. It was there in <b>my</b> <b>throat</b> and dragging <b>down</b> <b>my</b> heart, and I just felt as though any way of ending it all would be a joy. All these millions of hard-faced people, intent on their own prosperity or their own petty troubles, goaded me, I think, {{into a sort of}} silent fury. Just that one night I craved like a madman for a single human being to talk to--well, I shall never forget it, Martha--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank God, man!" [...] {{was all he}} said as {{he reached}} forth and dragged me into the tower. I was cold and numb and rather all in. Another few minutes would have done for me, I am sure, but the warmth of the {{interior}} helped to revive me, aided and abetted by some brandy which Bradley poured <b>down</b> <b>my</b> <b>throat,</b> from which it nearly removed the membrane. That brandy would have revived a corpse.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not that I'm {{knocking}} the high-brows, y' understand. This dress-suit music {{is all right}} for them that likes it. But what I object to is their trying to stuff it <b>down</b> <b>my</b> <b>throat!</b> I let 'em alone, and if I {{want to be a}} poor old low-brow and like reg'lar music, I don't see where they get off to be telling me I got to go to concerts. Honest now, ain't that the truth?" ...|$|E
60|$|The {{first thing}} after that which {{impressed}} itself on me with {{anything like the}} distinctness of reality {{was the sound of}} a crackling fire, accompanied with the sensation of warmth in my throat. Slowly opening my eyes I became {{aware of the fact that}} I was lying in front of a blazing fire, surrounded by Big Otter, Blondin, and Dougall, who stood gazing at me with anxious looks, while Henri Coppet knelt at my side, attempting to pour some warm tea <b>down</b> <b>my</b> <b>throat.</b>|$|E
60|$|And still I {{could not}} whisper--Money. The word stuck in <b>my</b> <b>throat.</b>|$|R
60|$|I {{could have}} cried out, but my tongue seemed dry in <b>my</b> <b>throat.</b>|$|R
60|$|When I had ended, he {{took away}} his blasphemous dagger-point from <b>my</b> <b>throat.</b>|$|R
6000|$|The old farmer jerked {{himself to}} his feet again. [...] "It's like this: I paid my dolla' to hear about a country where there wa'n't no co'perations nor no monop'lies nor no buyin' up cou'ts; and I ain't agoin' to have no allegory shoved <b>down</b> <b>my</b> <b>throat,</b> instead of a true history, noways. I know all about how it is here. Fi'st, run their line through your backya'd, and then kill off your cattle, and keep kerryin' on it up from cou't to cou't, till there ain't hide or hair on 'em left--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He lied to {{you this}} morning about the money. It's true enough that I gambled away the ten pounds at Roxham fair, instead of paying it into the bank as you told me, but he persuaded me to it, and he was to have shared the profits if we won. I was a blackguard, {{but he was a}} bigger blackguard; why should I have all the blame and have that fellow {{continually}} shoved <b>down</b> <b>my</b> <b>throat</b> as a saint? And so I thrashed him, and that is all about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “I’m {{trying to}} think whether she was with me when I called on Ada Spelvexit. I rather enjoyed myself there. Ada was trying, as usual, to ram that odious Koriatoffski woman <b>down</b> <b>my</b> <b>throat,</b> knowing {{perfectly}} well that I detest her, and in an unguarded moment she said: ‘She’s leaving her present house and going to Lower Seymour Street.’ ‘I dare say she will, if she stays there long enough,’ I said. Ada didn’t see it for about three minutes, {{and then she was}} positively uncivil. No, I am certain I didn’t leave Louise there.” ...|$|E
50|$|My {{voice is}} cracked, <b>my</b> <b>throat's</b> worn out, and my lungs are going fast.|$|R
60|$|GERALD. The older I get, father, {{the more}} such trifles stick in <b>my</b> <b>throat.</b>|$|R
2500|$|In Vance Joy's {{music video}} [...] "Riptide" [...] {{it shows a}} woman singing the lyrics to the song. At many points the lyrics which are sung [...] "I got a lump in <b>my</b> <b>throat</b> cause you're gonna sing the words wrong" [...] are {{deliberately}} mis-subtitled as [...] "I got a lump in <b>my</b> <b>throat</b> cause you gone and sank the worlds wolf" ...|$|R
