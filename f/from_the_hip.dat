5|$|During this era, Trent Reznor {{was chosen}} by Time {{as one of the}} most {{influential}} Americans of 1997. Its popularity was such that established glam metal groups, including Guns N' Roses and Mötley Crüe, began to dabble in the style. Figures <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>hip</b> hop scene also began to seek out collaborations with and remixes from industrial metal musicians.|$|E
5|$|The tail of Dimetrodon {{makes up}} {{a large portion of}} its total body length and {{includes}} around 50 caudal vertebrae. Tails were missing or incomplete in the first described skeletons of Dimetrodon; the only caudal vertebrae known were the eleven closest to the hip. Since these first few caudal vertebrae narrow rapidly as they progress farther <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>hip,</b> many paleontologists {{in the late nineteenth and}} early twentieth centuries thought that Dimetrodon had a very short tail. It was not until 1927 that a largely complete tail of Dimetrodon was described.|$|E
5|$|Dönitz {{contacted}} the British {{commander of the}} city of Flensburg, asking him for permission to conduct a formal state funeral, which was approved. That funeral, the last such of the Third Reich, was held on 16 May 1945 with Dönitz, Adolf Hitler's successor as Head of State, delivering the eulogy. In advance, Dönitz had ordered a board of inquiry and court martial to clarify the circumstances of the shooting. During the court martial, Gottlob stated that, in accordance with his orders, he had asked for the password three times without receiving a response from the person, whom he could not visually identify in the darkness. Without aiming he had fired his rifle <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>hip.</b> The chain of events was confirmed by the watch leader. The court ruled that Gottlob was not guilty and cleared him of any fault.|$|E

60|$|He tramped {{steadily}} on, always watchful with curiosity. He was a tall, well-built man, {{apparently in}} the prime of life. His shoulders were square and rather stiff, he leaned forwards a little as he went, <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>hips,</b> like a man who must stoop to lower his height. But he did not stoop his shoulders: he bent his straight back <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>hips.</b>|$|R

5|$|He re-invented the {{practice}} of stiff-arming his tacklers, which {{had gone out of}} favor among running backs in the 1970s. At times, he used his high school experience as a long jumper to leap over his opponents, landing on his head in the end zone to gain a touchdown in a game against the Buffalo Bills. His running gait was somewhat unusual, as his knees were minimally bent, and the motion was largely powered <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>hip.</b> This may have given his knees, a football player's most vulnerable joints, some protection, although he underwent arthroscopic surgery on both knees in 1983. He referred to this procedure as an 11,000-yard checkup.|$|E

The album reached number two on the UK Albums Chart and was certified double platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). The record experienced international success; it sold more than 1.5 million albums worldwide. It produced four singles, three of which reached the top three in the UK. Ellis-Bextor's second album, Shoot <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hip,</b> {{was released}} in October 2003. The album reached number nineteen in the UK and produced two top ten singles.

5|$|On 29 August 1942, {{during the}} Battle of Isurava, Kingsbury {{was one of}} the few {{survivors}} of a platoon that had been overrun by the Japanese. He immediately volunteered to join a different platoon, which had been ordered to counter-attack. Rushing forward and firing his Bren gun <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>hip,</b> he cleared a path through the enemy and inflicted several casualties. Kingsbury was then seen to fall, shot by a Japanese sniper and killed instantly. His actions, which delayed the Japanese long enough for the Australians to fortify their positions, were instrumental in saving his battalion's headquarters and he was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross as a result.|$|E

5|$|The Field Museum of Natural History (FMNH) also {{conducted}} excavations {{south of the}} town of Emery from 2009 to 2010, with permits from the Utah Geological Survey. These excavations were conducted in a site discovered by Akiko Shinya in 2008, FMNH locality UT080821-1, which has been named Akiko's Site in her honor. During the excavations, 167 disarticulated but closely associated elements were collected in two plaster jackets. One of these plaster jackets, containing elements <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>hip</b> and vertebrae, was given the specimen number FMNH PR 3847; the specimen was subsequently described by McDonald along with Terry Gates, Lindsay Zanno, and Peter Makovicky in 2017. Another locality discovered by the FMNH is the Triple Peak quarry, FMNH locality UT130904-2, which contains a bonebed of over 400 juvenile bones that belong to at least four individuals.|$|E
5|$|While {{the pelvis}} {{is not entirely}} {{like that of a}} human (being {{markedly}} wide, or flared, with laterally orientated iliac blades), these features point to a structure radically remodelled to accommodate a significant degree of bipedalism. The femur angles in toward the knee <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>hip.</b> This trait allows the foot to fall closer to the midline of the body, and strongly indicates habitual bipedal locomotion. Present-day humans, orangutans and spider monkeys possess this same feature. The feet feature adducted big toes, making it difficult if not impossible to grasp branches with the hindlimbs. Besides locomotion, A. afarensis also had a slightly larger brain than a modern chimpanzee (the closest living relative of humans) and had teeth that were more human than ape-like.|$|E
5|$|On 6 August 1915, Mackay was {{involved}} in the Battle of Lone Pine. When the attack began, Mackay went over the top at the head of an attack. He ignored the first Turkish trench, taking a direct line to his objective. Firing <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>hip,</b> he shot and killed several Turks in the trenches below. Mackay positioned himself at the junction of two trenches, shooting down more enemy troops. When no others appeared, he came to the belief that the trenches were in Australian hands and ran across the junction into a wide bay. The first man who attempted to follow was shot dead, as were the next two after him. The rest decided not to follow. Mackay took up a position on a fire step, a raised part of the trench floor which allows men to fire over the top. Three Turkish soldiers appeared in the trench. Mackay attempted to fire but his magazine was empty. He lunged at the Turks, grazing one and making all three run. Mackay then instructed his party to fortify the position with sandbags. As the barricade was built up, it became possible {{for the rest of the}} party to join Mackay. The post became the north eastern corner of the new Australian position at Lone Pine. It was in an exposed position and came under hand grenade attack from Turkish troops. Mackay was slightly injured in one such attack. When Lieutenant Jack Massie was sent to relieve Mackay during the night, Mackay refused to leave the post.|$|E

25|$|The group's musical style evolved {{significantly}} {{throughout its}} career. Its first two releases, DC Talk and Nu Thang, {{were of the}} hip hop genre.

The trio's last two albums, Jesus Freak and Supernatural, were predominantly pop rock.|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} the changes {{introduced}} by TVE, {{the security of the}} online voting process was put into question once again. On 21 December 2008, the score of the songs that were leading most of the categories, including the songs with the most votes overall, was briefly reduced to zero on the official website's ranking due to technical problems. On 24 December, TVE announced that votes would be deducted from entries due to fraudulent voting. 4,300 votes were removed from seven entries online, most of which coming <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hip</b> Hop group.|$|E
25|$|Besides {{his first}} film, <b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hip,</b> which {{received}} poor reviews, Kelley wrote and produced three other films. 1996's To Gillian on Her 37th Birthday, a romance, co-starring his wife, Michelle Pfeiffer, received tepid critical and box office reception. In 1999, came two films: Lake Placid, {{a combination of}} suspense, horror and comedy, and Mystery, Alaska, about a fictional small-town ice hockey team that plays {{a game against the}} New York Rangers of the National Hockey League. Neither movie did well with either the critics or the audience.|$|E

25|$|On March 15, Herrera’s platoon was {{advancing}} along {{a wooded}} road near the French town of Mertzwiller when it ran into two German machine-gun emplace-ments. Caught in a deadly crossfire {{between the two}} guns, the GIs dived for cover. Fearing that his comrades would be cut to pieces, Herrera stood up and ran toward the closest enemy position, firing his rifle <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>hip.</b> He tossed two grenades at the machine-gun nest; the concussion knocked the Germans down. Then he was on them, and all eight soldiers threw down their weapons and surrendered to him.|$|E
25|$|Human {{walking is}} {{accomplished}} with a strategy called the double pendulum. During forward motion, the leg {{that leaves the}} ground swings forward <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>hip.</b> This sweep is the first pendulum. Then the leg strikes {{the ground with the}} heel and rolls through to the toe in a motion described as an inverted pendulum. The motion of the two legs is coordinated so that one foot or the other is always in contact with the ground. The process of walking recovers approximately sixty per cent of the energy used due to pendulum dynamics and ground reaction force.|$|E
