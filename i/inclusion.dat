CrS <b>inclusions</b> were resistant to pit initiation compared with (Mn,Cr) S <b>inclusions.</b> The dissolution potential of CrS <b>inclusions</b> was found to be in the transpassive region of stainless steels. Stable pits were initiated in this potential region. (Mn,Cr) S <b>inclusions</b> dissolved in the passive region of stainless steels, providing lower pitting potentials than those of CrS-containing stainless steels. AES analysis of the surface films on CrS <b>inclusions</b> indicated that chromium-containing oxide films were formed on the CrS <b>inclusions</b> and grew with electrode potential, which suggested the oxide films on CrS <b>inclusions</b> prevented the anodic dissolution of the <b>inclusions,</b> thereby leading to an increased resistance to pit initiation...|$|R

40|$|Nitriding {{processes}} {{are widely used}} to improve the fatigue properties of steel. Fatigue failures in nitriding steels initiate from sub-surface non-metallic <b>inclusions,</b> which are usually oxide <b>inclusions.</b> It is known that duplex oxysulphide <b>inclusions</b> are less harmful to the fatigue properties of steel than oxide <b>inclusions</b> alone, since the sulphide outer phase acts as a buffer to the oxide in the core, and thus reduces the fatigue-initiating stress influence of oxide <b>inclusions.</b> Twelve nitriding steel melts were produced, and non-metallic <b>inclusions,</b> modified by adding CaSi cored wire, were investigated. Since calcium has a high vapour pressure and a low solubility in molten steel, {{it is difficult to}} effectively modify non-metallic <b>inclusions</b> by the addition of CaSi cored wire in small furnaces. However, {{it was found that the}} addition of CaSi cored wire at a lower temperature was favourable to higher calcium injection yield in a small furnace, and it was also observed that the reaction with liquid steel was less violent, resulting in the effective modification of non-metallic <b>inclusions.</b> Analysis by a scanning electron microscope with energy dispersive X-ray technique showed a proportion of duplex oxysulphide <b>inclusions</b> formed in ingots from 11 A, with the remainder being predominantly globular calcium aluminate <b>inclusions.</b> Specimens for direct stress fatigue testing were produced from steels containing both modified and unmodified <b>inclusions,</b> and the fatigue properties were compared. It was found that calcium aluminate <b>inclusions</b> had a more deleterious effect on the fatigue properties of steel than alumina <b>inclusions.</b> In calcium modified steels, at lifetimes of more than 5 x 10 ⁵ cycles, fatigue cracks always initiated from calcium aluminate <b>inclusions,</b> which were partly or completely debonded from the matrix. The fatigue properties of the calcium modified steel was found to be inferior to those of the unmodified steel. No duplex oxysulphide <b>inclusions</b> were found among those <b>inclusions</b> which produced fatigue crack initiations, and this indicated that when they were present calcium aluminate <b>inclusions</b> governed the fatigue properties of steel whether or not duplex oxysulphide <b>inclusions</b> were present in the steel. It is inferred that the fatigue properties of steel can be improved if all large calcium aluminate <b>inclusions</b> are modified to duplex oxysulphide <b>inclusions...</b>|$|R

30|$|F {{concentrations}} of Iwate melt <b>inclusions</b> {{are in the}} same range as those reported for MORB melt <b>inclusions</b> (Gakkel from 146 to 166  ppm, Shaw et al. 2010; EPR from 18 to 342  ppm; and Juan de Fuca from 62 to 123  ppm, Wanless and Shaw 2012). Cl concentrations in the Iwate melt <b>inclusions</b> are systematically higher than MORB melt <b>inclusions</b> by approximately an order of magnitude (Figure  2). The enrichment of fluid-mobile elements has been interpreted as a mixing of slab input to the melting region (e.g., Gill 1981; Tatsumi and Eggins 1995).

40|$|Surface active {{elements}} in liquid steel may accumulate at the interface of non-metallic <b>inclusions</b> and liquid steel, and thus affect the morphology of the <b>inclusions.</b> In the present work, {{the effect of}} Te on the morphology of alumina <b>inclusions</b> was studied at different conditions. After acid extraction, mainly five types of alumina <b>inclusions</b> were identified with SEM, i. e., dendritic, spherical, faceted, plate-like and clustered <b>inclusions.</b> Te was found to considerably modify the morphology of alumina <b>inclusions.</b> At low supersaturation degree, defined by [Al] and [O], and no stirring conditions, 1000 ppm Te addition decreases the percentage of spherical <b>inclusions</b> in number from 68. 0 % to 33. 9 % whereas it increases the percentages of faceted and plate-like <b>inclusions</b> from 21. 6 % to 32. 1 % and 8. 8 % to 30. 5 %, respectively. Stirring the melt for 30 s after Al addition strengthens the effect of Te on the morphological modification, resulting in more plate-like alumina <b>inclusions.</b> In contrast, increasing the supersaturation degree makes the morphological modification by Te less obvious. Moreover, the morphology of faceted <b>inclusions</b> changes considerably due to the addition of Te. Faceted <b>inclusions</b> become more angular and large flat faces develop, forming octahedral shape and plate-like shape (small in size). Based on the attachment energy model, the growth morphology of alumina <b>inclusions</b> was calculated from first principles with VASP software.
