50|$|The type of {{hardware}} used will vary {{based on the}} type of work involved. For example, a unit to locate utilities and for geophysical applications will need to map anywhere from 15 feet to 100 feet. The frequency range for this type of <b>ground</b> penetrating <b>radar</b> <b>equipment</b> is 10-2300 MHz with a peak frequency between 100 and 1000 MHz and pulse duration of 0.2 to 4.0 ns. More than 50,000 lineal feet of data can be collected and stored in the US Radar Seeker unit before being transferred via USB port to a Windows-based operating system that processes and filters the information. The field units also filter and process in realtime.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{reinforced}} concrete cast in place four span {{deck of a}} concrete bridge near Roanoke, Texas, was recently completed. Due to possible construction errors, it was suspected that the concrete covers in the deck did not conform to drawings and specifications. A full scale non-destructive evaluation of the concrete covers was carried out using <b>ground</b> penetrating <b>radar</b> (GPR) <b>equipment.</b> Cover values were determined from the radargram generated from the scan. The estimated covers were plotted on contour maps. Migration data can substitute the drilling based ground truth data without compromising the concrete cover estimations, except for areas with very high cover values. Areas with high water content may result in inaccurate concrete dielectric constants. Based on the results, significant retrofitting of the bridge deck, such as additional overlay, was recommended...|$|R
50|$|The Air Force {{responded with}} a {{two-phase}} deployment of reinforcements to Europe - the largest such overseas movement of aircraft since World War II. The first phase began on 5 September with Operation Tack Hammer. Tactical Air Command launched eight F-100D squadrons from its Composite Air Strike Force to augment USAFE strength with 144 fighters. All Tack Hammer fighters moved across the Atlantic Ocean with aerial refueling en route. The TACK HAMMER deployment was an interim measure until ANG units could relieve Tactical Air Command squadrons. The Air National Guard was tasked to supply six tactical fighter wings and one tactical reconnaissance wing to expand USAFE. Also deployed to Europe was the ANG 152d Tactical Control Group consisting of six Tactical Control Squadrons, manned by 230 officers and 1,850 airmen with mobile <b>ground</b> <b>radar</b> and radio <b>equipment</b> to control tactical air power on the battlefield. It was dispersed throughout West Germany.|$|R
40|$|<b>Ground</b> Penetrating <b>Radar</b> (GPR) {{methods have}} been used to {{evaluate}} the presence, extent, and spatial variability of hydrophobic soils in Southern California Watersheds. It has been shown that high frequency <b>ground</b> penetrating <b>radar</b> <b>equipment,</b> under certain conditions, has the ability to determine the presence, depth, and persistence of post fire hydrophobic soils. As part of this study an extensive investigation was undertaken to not only evaluate the capability of this approach but also to understand under what conditions the method can be applied successfully and what are the limitations of the approach. The investigation includes use of computer simulations and modeling, laboratory investigations in sand boxes with native soils, and multiple field trials spanning a five year time period. Of particular significance is the finding that using GPR it is possible to: locate the interface between the uppermost burnt soil layer, and soil horizons below; quantify the depth at which the hydrophobic layer forms; and quantify the spatial extent of the layer. As part of this study best practice methods for both field and lab experimentation have also been developed and are presented {{in the body of the}} thesis. Based on this study it is concluded that the use of GPR can provide a much more accurate and comprehensive method of evaluating the nature of hydrophobic layers in such environments than the current point specific manual methods. As a result the use of GPR has significantly advanced our capacity to assess the potential for increased erosion and the generation of debris flows in such environments after rainfall events...|$|R

40|$|Evaluation of {{pavement}} structural {{performance by}} Non Destructive Test (NDT) {{has been growing}} since {{the introduction of the}} Benkelman Beam at the WASHO Road Test in the early 1950 's. The deflection basin data have to be analyzed d to obtain the structural properties of pavement layers and subgrade, that are typically used for pavement evaluation and rehabilitation design. One of the more common methods for analyzing deflection data is the back-calculation, in which theoretical deflections are compared with measured deflections and the assumed moduli are then adjusted in an iterative procedure until theoretical and measured deflection basins match acceptably well. The iterative process assume the pavement model as an input, and the accuracy and the precision of the backcalculation process can be reduced by errors due to the inaccurate input evaluation. Particularly pavement layer thickness and interface condition between layers are affected by a construction and measurement related variability. As matter of fact layer thickness information are measured accurately from core, in a limited number of test points because of their destructive nature, and are rough estimated from <b>Ground</b> Penetrating <b>Radar</b> <b>equipment</b> along the entire profile section. Layer interface properties depends on many factors (such as temperature, coat binder, normal pressure etc.) and are very difficult to be estimated. In this study a sensitive analysis to evaluate the combined impact of the layer thickness and interface condition variability was performed. A back-calculation program to accurately evaluate the layer moduli, based on a linear elastic multilayer model, was developed and a simulation procedure, based on Monte Carlo method, was applied to represent the thickness variability. The study showed that layer thickness and interface condition variability have a strong impact on the back-calculated results, therefore it was proposed to perform the design of maintenance treatment according to suitable percentile value of their probability distribution. This former could be evaluated by the simulation procedure developed, as a case study reported shows...|$|R
