40|$|Trimodal {{transport}} chains for containerised seaport <b>hinterland</b> <b>traffic</b> {{are often}} referred to by actors {{in the field of}} inland navigation as a major possibility to increase the transport volume of inland navigation in container traffic and to strengthen the position of inland ports as trimodal hinterland-hubs in container transport chains. However, a sound scientific investigation of the feasibility of trimodal transport chains in relation to alternative transport offers in containerised seaport <b>hinterland</b> <b>traffic</b> has been missing so far. For this purpose, a suitable modelling approach has been developed in this research, which combines the detailed process analysis of trimodal seaport <b>hinterland</b> <b>traffic</b> with the use of geographical information systems (GIS) for intermodal transport. Based on the detailed process analysis of intermodal seaport <b>hinterland</b> <b>traffic,</b> a new typology of combined transport terminals in seaports is proposed and, in particular, necessary enhancements of nowadays available GIS in the transport sector with respect to specific infrastructure restrictions of each transport mode are defined in the form of attributes of the road, rail and inland waterway networks. These will allow for a significantly wider use of GIS as a knowldge base for the planning of intermodal transport networks in the future. Furthermore, through the development of calculation schemes for the detailed modelling of process times and costs of combined seaport <b>hinterland</b> <b>traffic,</b> extensive scenarios of trimodal transport chains have been calculated. The results show that for a major part of goods transported in containers, from low-value bulk cargo up to relatively high-value electronic goods, trimodal transport chains are feasible compared to direct rail transport...|$|E
40|$|At present, {{less than}} 2 % of the <b>hinterland</b> <b>traffic</b> to the harbour of Zeebrugge is carried by inland navigation, {{due to the}} {{insufficient}} capacity of inland waterway connections. An alternative could be offered by estuary vessels, i. e. inland vessels strengthened and equipped for safe operation between the Belgian coastal harbours and the West Scheldt in favourable weather and wave conditions. However, the window determined by the present regulations of the Belgian Shipping Inspectorate is too restrictive, traffic being impossible for 60 days a year on average. Accordingly, the Belgian federal authorities have recently prepared new regulations, based on probabilistic design procedures, including a risk analysis with respect to criteria which take due account of the limitations inherent {{to the design of}} inland vessels. Measures have been proposed by the Flemish authorities to stimulate the operation of estuary inland vessels for container transport from and to the coastal harbours, implying financial support for construction and exploitation...|$|E
40|$|Freight {{transport}} {{models are}} used to estimate the expected impact of policy measures and are a necessary input for the justification of infrastructure investments. Seaport hinterland models {{can be used to}} forecast future <b>hinterland</b> <b>traffic</b> and modal split development. For the impact assessment, most freight transport models use a generalized cost approach for the purchasers' costs which amount the operators' costs passed on to the users of transport services and the actual users' costs (e. g. time costs). At present, no comprehensive model exists for the Port of Hamburg. Consequently, it is difficult to estimate the expected impacts of infrastructure measures for the Port of Hamburg's hinterland accessibility. The aim {{of this paper is to}} give an overview over the research field of freight transport modelling and to develop an approach for comparing the Port of Hamburg's hinterland connections taking into consideration different types of costs. Finally, the cost functions are applied to the use case "Port of Hamburg" on a macroscopic level...|$|E
50|$|The freight bypass railway {{is one of}} {{the main}} {{double-track}} railways in Germany. Due to the line being largely shared by traffic running north-south between seaports and the <b>hinterland</b> and <b>traffic</b> running east-west, trains run virtually continuously. The fact that lines running parallel with it have been dismantled or are not electrified (such as the Elze-LÃ¶hne railway), mean that there is such a strong concentration of traffic that minor events on the line can lead to traffic jams.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe port {{logistics}} and {{its regional}} economic react {{on each other}} and develop in unison. This paper studies the Hub-and-Spoke port logistics network which is a transportation system between the sea routes and ports hinterland transport routes. An optimization model is proposed {{with the objective of}} the total transportation cost in the regional port group based on the conditions of dynamic hinterland. This paper not only ensures every port in the hub-and spoke port logistics network to achieve its maximum economic benefits, but also makes the entire system get the minimum total transportation cost in the view of quantitative point. In order to illustrate the validity of the model, the example was solved. The results show that the model is feasible. Furthermore, the competitiveness power of the port, the demarcation of <b>hinterland</b> and the <b>traffic</b> capacity are changed dynamically in the model, which is closer to the real system...|$|R
40|$|In {{maritime}} logistics the 'time factor' traditionally holds {{a critical}} importance for shippers, freight forwarders, shipping agents, logistics service providers, shipowners and port terminal operators. Also, academic literature widely recognized the key role of this variable for benchmarking and evaluating operational performances along transport supply chains. The {{centrality of the}} time factor in planning new services and shaping firm strategies derives from the consciousness that an adequate and reliable knowledge of this variable is capable of improving the overall efficiency and productivity. Therefore, an in-depth time-related analysis of various processes and cargo flows appears a sine qua non condition for balancing the interests of stakeholders interacting within the supply chain, and enhancing the competitiveness of the entire port system. Seaports, indeed, are major nodes inserted in maritime logistics chains and the different cargo handling facilities have to manage both ship and inland operations for synchronizing (massified) foreland and (atomized) <b>hinterland</b> <b>traffic</b> flows. Therefore, {{the aim of the}} paper is to demonstrate the relevance of the time factor in seaports, analysing the operational performance and the productivity of an Italian seaport, basically declined as roadsteads queuing time and seaport turn round time...|$|E
