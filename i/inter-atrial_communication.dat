40|$|Since {{when the}} first transesophageal {{echocardiography}} (TEE) was undertaken in 1975, technological advances have made this diagnostic modality more reliable. TEE indications became widespread in cardiac and non-cardiac surgeries, intensive care units, and ambulatory clinics. The procedure is generally considered a safe diagnostic tool, but occasionally complications do occur. The insertion and manipulation of the ultrasound probe can cause oropharyngeal, esophageal, or gastric trauma. Although rare, these complications may present a mortality rate of up to 56 % depending on the treatment approach and the elapsed time to the diagnosis. The authors report a case of a 65 -year-old woman submitted to attempt a TEE in order to better study or diagnose an <b>inter-atrial</b> <b>communication.</b> After 3 days of the procedure, the patient {{was admitted to the}} hospital with edema, hyperemia of the anterior face of the neck, accompanied by systemic symptoms.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Sudden {{cardiac death}} (SCD), above all when {{occurring}} in young people, remains a major clinical problem. We have analysed the clinical and post mortem findings {{of patients who}} were evaluated for SCD. METHODS AND RESULTS: We have analysed 54 cases of SCD which occurred in patients aged below 40 years during the period 1993 - 2012 and were studied at the Institute of Forensic Medicine of Brescia. The following variables were considered: sex, age, medical history, autopsy findings with special reference to macroscopic and histological evaluation {{of the heart and}} toxicological investigation. In all cases, we also performed the dissection of the cardiac conduction tissue with subsequent serial sampling and careful microscopic evaluation. Most SCD patients were men (76 %), {{with a mean age of}} 27 years. The results of post mortem investigations have identified the following abnormalities: coronary artery disease (18. 5 %), arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (11. 1 %), hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (9. 2 %), severe valvular heart disease (7. 4 %) and myocarditis (7. 4 %). A case of persistence of the <b>inter-atrial</b> <b>communication</b> with cardiomegaly and right and left ventricular hypertrophy was also reported. Examination of the cardiac conduction tissue showed abnormalities in 12 cases (22. 2 %), in whom the heart was structurally normal at macroscopic examination. Despite all the investigations carried out, any pathogenic substrate that could have justified death was not found in 12 cases (22. 2 %). CONCLUSION: Our study underlines the value of an accurate routine post portem investigation that may show an otherwise unsuspected structural heart disease. The serial study of the conduction tissue may provide pathologic substrates that may be responsible for the arrhythmic cause of death. A meaningful percentage of cases (22 %) had no evidence of any abnormality. Genetic testing can be indicated in these cases...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the feasibility of}} the arterial switch for surgical repair of transposition, defined as the combination of concordant atrioventricular and discordant ventriculo-arterial connections, after late referral. METHODS: From March 2000 to August 2001, six children underwent an arterial switch procedure following left ventricular preparation because of late referral. The mean age at referral was 8. 3 months, with a range from 3 to 25 months, and mean body weight was 5. 3 kg, with a range from 3. 7 to 9. 3 kg. The mean saturation of oxygen was 57 %, with a range from 50 to 72 %. Associated defects included a restrictive ventricular septal defect in three patients, aortic coarctation in one, and partially anomalous pulmonary venous connection in one. The mean interval between referral and the arterial switch procedure was 3. 7 months, within a range from 1 to 7 months. A mean of 1. 5 surgical procedures were undertaken to prepare the left ventricle, the most being 3 procedures, including combinations of creation of an <b>inter-atrial</b> <b>communication</b> in four patients, banding of the pulmonary trunk in five, and creation of a systemic-to-pulmonary arterial shunt in three. We evaluated left ventricle ejection and shortening fractions, left ventricular diastolic diameter and volume, right and left ventricular wall thicknesses, and the ratio of right to left ventricular values by echocardiography at referral, immediately before, and {{one week after the}} arterial switch procedure. RESULTS: All children are alive and well, with a mean follow-up of 17 months, ranging from 9 to 26 months. Echocardiography showed a statistically significant decrease of the ratio between right and left ventricular wall thicknesses, from 1. 33 +/- 0. 26 at referral to 0. 79 +/- 0. 08 before the switch procedure (p &lt; 0. 005). Left ventricular function was adequate after arterial switch, with a mean ejection fraction of 79. 3 %, ranging from 66 to 87 %, and a mean shortening fraction of 41. 7 %, ranging from 30 to 49 %. CONCLUSIONS: Despite late referral, and initially inadequate left ventricular volume and mural thickness, children with transposition can successfully be treated with the arterial switch procedure, provided that the left ventricle is adequately prepared, using echocardiography to monitor left ventricular morphology and function...|$|E
40|$|Complete AVSD (CAVSD) is {{characterized}} by the presence of a common atrio-ventricular (AV) orifice, an <b>inter-atrial</b> <b>communication,</b> and a ventricular septal defect (VSD). Results of surgical correction of atrio-ventricular septal defects (AVSDs) have improved over the last decades; however, the need for reoperation for left atrio-ventricular valve regurgitation, after primary AVSD repair remains a major concern. The aim of our study is to assess the outcome of the routine leaflet augmentation technique in CAVSD repair. A retrospective database and chart review analysis of all patients who underwent AV canal repair at king Abdul-Aziz Cardiac Center during period from 1999 to September 2014 was conducted. Demographic data, associated anomalies, operative data, ICU and hospital course were reviewed. Early outcomes were reviewed for postoperative complications (Chylothorax, complete AV block, Arrhythmias, early mortality) and late outcomes were reviewed for Left AV valve regurgitation requiring for re-intervention and late mortality. Two hundred and sixty patients underwent leaflet augmentation technique to repair complete AVSD, between January 1999 and September 2014. The mean age was (131. 5  months), and mean weight (6. 06  kg). A variety of concomitant procedures were performed at the time of repair of the CAVSD, including a total of 49 patients (18. 8 %) who underwent PDA ligation. Repair of TV (Right AV valve) was performed in 11 patients (4. 2 %), 9 patients (3. 46 %) required RVOTO resection, in 5 patients (1. 92 %), PA plasty was done and 2 patients (0. 76 %) required ECMO after CAVSD repair. Regarding reoperations, a total of 17 patients (of 260) required reoperation after initial CAVSD repair. The most common indication for reoperation was left AV valve regurgitation in 16 patients (6 %) in the follow up period up to 15  years. One patient (0. 38 %) required diaphragmatic plication. The overall mortality was 3 patients (1. 1 %). Leaflet augmentation for the repair of the complete AVSD, represent a good surgical alternative technique, allows for good exposure, good LAVV reconstruction and close to anatomical repair and results in reduced incidence of late Left atrio-ventricular valve regurgitation...|$|E
40|$|Pediatricians are {{frequently}} {{involved in the}} care of cyanotic newborns in the labor and delivery room, {{as well as in the}} well baby nursery. Causes of hypoxia and cyanosis in the term newborn can be found within all physiological systems. Congenital heart structural diseases account for the largest diagnostic category. There have been significant advances during the past years in the diagnosis and treatment of neonates with critical congenital heart disease, especially in the field of pre- and post-operative intensive care. The term hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) describes a spectrum of cardiac structural abnormalities characterized by marked hypoplasia of the left ventricle and ascending aorta. Prenatal diagnosis, initial resuscitation and optimal preoperative management are key elements that allow the best opportunity for low mortality and normal neurodevelopment in affected newborns. Preoperatively, the goal is to achieve adequate systemic oxygen delivery. Patency of the ductus arteriosus (DA) is critical for survival until surgery. Blood flow to the pulmonary and systemic circulations should be nearly balanced (goal Qp/Qs ratio of 1). The immediate therapy for all infants with HLHS is an intravenous infusion of prostaglandin E 1 (PGE 1) in order to manipulate the DA and maintain ductal patency. Oxygen saturations of 75 % to 85 % by pulse oximetry suggest an adequate balance between systemic and pulmonary blood flow. Judicious use of inotropic support is initiated if evidence of low cardiac output is detected. Diuretics may be necessary to help alleviate the increased volume load on the right ventricle. The goal of respiratory management is to increase pulmonary vascular resistance and decrease systemic vascular resistance. Infants with HLHS who are born with a severely restricted or no <b>inter-atrial</b> <b>communication,</b> a rare occurrence, have profound hypoxemia. The severe restriction of blood flow across the atrial septum results in a life-threatening situation and these patients, which present with severe cyanosis and hemodynamic instability, require urgent postnatal cardiac catheterization to relieve the septal obstruction and improve oxygenation. Special attention should be paid to the prevention of brain injury and poor neurodevelopmental outcome. Care for infants with HLHS is complex, and often multiple specialists are involved. Despite an increase in the number of newborns with complex congenital heart disease and a growing percentage of patients with single-ventricle physiology, it is possible to care for this particular group of patients and achieve acceptable mortality risks, even in centres with no pediatric cardiac surgery facilities, if good preoperative management protocols are followed...|$|E
40|$|Background: Balloon atrial septostomy (BAS) {{was first}} {{described}} by Rashkind and Miller in 1966 and remains an important interventional procedure in the palliation of {{certain forms of}} congenital heart disease (CHD). Creating an atrial septa 1 defect in patients with transposition of the great arteries (d-TGA) will enhance bidirectional mixing of the pulmonary and systemic venous blood, hence improving oxygen saturation. The aim {{of the work is}} to review and report our experience using balloon atrial septostomy in different CHD. Method: We retrospectively reviewed the hospital records, echocardiographic and cardiac catheterization reports of patients subjected for BAS during the period from January 2001 till January 2010. One hundred and ninety two patients with CHD (78. 5 % d-TGA, 10 % mitral atresia, 7. 5 % tricuspid atresia, and 4 % hypoplastic left heart syndrome) underwent BAS. Their gestational age was 38. 63  ±  1. 48  weeks, postnatal age (median 3. 5  days, range 1 – 54) and weight 3. 08  ±  0. 37  kg, 57. 5 % was male and 42. 5 % was female. All patients received PGE 1 infusion before the procedure to maintain the ductal patency in a dose of 0. 05 – 0. 1  μg/kg/min. Results: One hundred twenty two procedures (63. 5 %) were done in neonatal intensive care at bedside and 70 procedures (36. 5 %) in the catheterization laboratory. General anesthesia was used in 31. 3 % of patients whereas conscious sedation was used in 68. 7 % of patients. Femoral access in 78 % while umbilical access in 22 %. Seven F sheath was used in 100 % of case. The Miller catheter was used in 75 % and a Z- 5 septostomy catheter in 25 % of cases. The diameter of the atrial communication increased from 2. 75  ±  0. 97  mm to 7. 07  ±  0. 79  mm (p <  0. 0001). Oxygen saturations increased significantly from 65. 38  ±  9. 59 % to 88. 62  ±  3. 13 % (p <  0. 0001). Mean pressure gradient for patients done in catheterization laboratory decreased from 4. 1  ±  2. 4 to 0. 5  ±  1. 1  mmHg (p <  0. 0001). The number of septostomies required to achieve good results was 5. 23  ±  1. 20. No significant difference in oxygen saturation or the size of <b>inter-atrial</b> <b>communication</b> was observed between the two used balloons (p =  0. 6). Conclusion: BAS is safe and an effective palliative procedure for different CHD with good immediate results in our institution...|$|E
