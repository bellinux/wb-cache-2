40|$|In this paper, an {{efficient}} evolutionary optimisation of a turbine blade firtree root local profile is presented. The firtree geometry is designed using an <b>intelligent</b> rule-based <b>computer-aided</b> design system (ICAD) and analysed using an industrial-strength finite element code. A {{large number of}} geometric and mechanical constraints drawn from past experience are incorporated {{in the design of}} the model. The high computational cost associated with finding optimal designs using high-fidelity codes is addressed using a surrogate-assisted genetic algorithm. The initial surrogate model is first built based on points sampled with a design-of-experiment method. A database of designs analysed using the high-fidelity code is built and augmented while the genetic algorithm progresses. In the procedure for deciding whether the high-fidelity code should be run, a simple 3 ? principle is used instead of searching for the point with maximum expected improvement. This is combined with an appropriate ranking of the design points within the database. Some benchmark test problems are first used to illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the framework. When applied to the problem of local shape optimisation of a turbine blade firtree root, significant improvement is achieved using a limited computational budget...|$|R

Being a knowledge intensive process, metal casting stands to benefit greatly from the development and deployment of tailor-made software tools. The paper describes the evolution of software tools for casting design, broadly segregated into three phases spanning the decades 1980 s (basic CAD), 1990 s (desktop simulation) and 2000 s (<b>intelligent</b> design). While <b>computer-aided</b> design and simulation software can greatly enhance productivity, quality assurance and casting yield, their penetration in small/medium foundries and engineering companies has been poor.

40|$|During {{and after}} any extreme event of natural or {{man-made}} origin, getting {{people out of}} harms way and to an area of safety are primary objectives. Orderly and efficient evacuations {{are the key to}} saving lives. This was clearly demonstrated during the attacks on the Pentagon and World Trade Center towers on September 11, 2001. One of the major recommendations from the US Government’s Draft Final Report on the World Trade Center Towers collapse was that building evacuation modeling and procedures should be improved to facilitate safe and rapid egress and support better occupant preparedness for evacuation during emergencies. Performing actual physical evacuations of large occupied facilities is expensive and disruptive to occupants and visitors. Accurately evaluating the affects of various events such as loss of power, smoke, fire, explosions, chemical contamination and structural collapse on human movements is not feasible in real world evacuation exercises. This paper examines a new technology, <b>computer-aided,</b> <b>intelligent</b> agent-based evacuation modeling, that can model and help plan emergency evacuations; run numerous, accurate event-driven evacuation scenarios; support the design of egress for new facilities or facility modernizations; support research in the areas of human behavior in disaster sociology; and model the movement of first responders and security personnel...|$|R

The aim of our research is the design of a <b>computer-aided,</b> <b>intelligent</b> and genetic algorithm(GA) based programming system for CNC cutting tools selection, tool sequences planning and optimisation of cutting conditions. The first step is geometrical feature recognition and classification. On the basis of recognised features the module for GA-based determination of technological data determine cutting tools, cutting parameters (according to work piece material and cutting tool material) and detailed tool sequence planning. Material, which will be removed, is split into several cuts, each consisting of a number of basic tool movements. In thenext step, GA operations such as reproduction, crossover and mutation are applied. The process of GA-based optimisation runs in cycles in which new generations of individuals are created with increased average fitness of a population. During the evaluation of calculated results (generated NC programmes) several rules and constraints like rapid and cutting tool movement, collision, clamping and minimum machining time, which represent the fitness function, were taken into account.

A theoretical design method of the truss-bolt system for reinforcing underground fractured rock roof in coalmines is presented. The mechanical analysis of the system is considered in the models for the tie-rods and inclined roof bolts as well as three upper and lower bounds. The arching actions exerted by lateral behavior of the inclined bolts in reinforcing cracked roof are analyzed. The global-resistance concerning the lateral and axial behaviors of the inclined bolts in a truss-bolt-supported roadway is examined by using the classical theory of nonlinear beam under bending and tension. Based on the mechanical models, the design formulas concerning the lateral forces of bolts, tensions of tie-rod in truss system are given; and the reinforcement behaviors have been proposed. The analytical formulas for both lower and upper bounds for truss pre-tightening forces are put forward. Furthermore, the analytical equations for designing axial forces and dimensions of bolts in the system are presented.
