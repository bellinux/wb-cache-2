5|$|During CENTCOM {{military}} exercises in July 1990 termed Internal Look '90, Schwarzkopf wrote up {{a scenario that}} tested how the command would respond to a regional dictator invading a neighboring country and threatening oil fields there, a scenario which closely mirrored the rising tension between Iraq and Kuwait. One week {{after the end of}} these exercises, <b>Iraq</b> <b>invaded</b> <b>Kuwait</b> on August 2, 1990.|$|E
5|$|Hours after Ambassador Bishop's {{visit to}} Central Command, <b>Iraq</b> <b>invaded</b> <b>Kuwait.</b> In 1979, the US {{negotiated}} {{access to an}} airport and port in both Mogadishu and Berbera; because of limited access the US had to locations in the Persian Gulf area, maintaining this access was a main interest for the Mogadishu embassy to pursue as the US mobilized to intervene in Kuwait.|$|E
5|$|When Saddam Hussein's <b>Iraq</b> <b>invaded</b> <b>Kuwait</b> on 2 August 1990, British Secretary of State for Defence Tom King soon {{announced}} that the UK military contribution to the region was to be increased. A coalition of nations was formed, and a combined naval force entered the Persian Gulf and sailed north, neutralising the Iraqi Navy as it went, and then began conducting naval gunfire support and mine counter-measure missions {{in preparation for the}} main amphibious landing force.|$|E

5|$|On 2 August 1990, <b>Iraq</b> <b>invaded</b> <b>Kuwait.</b> In {{the middle}} of the month, President George H. W. Bush, in keeping with the Carter Doctrine, sent the first of several hundred {{thousand}} troops, along with a strong force of naval support to Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf area to support a multi-national force in a standoff with Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein. On 7 August, Wisconsin and her battle group were ordered to deploy in defense of Kuwait for Operation Desert Shield, and they arrived in the Persian Gulf on 23 August. On 15 January 1991, Operation Desert Storm commenced operations, and Wisconsin found herself serving alongside her younger sister Missouri, just as she had done in Korea forty years previously. Both Wisconsin and Missouri launched Tomahawk Missile attacks against Iraq; they were among the first ships to fire cruise missiles during the 1991 Gulf War. Wisconsin served as the Tomahawk Land Attack Missile (TLAM) strike commander for the Persian Gulf, directing the sequence of launches that marked the opening of Operation Desert Storm and firing a total of 24 of her own TLAMs during the first two days of the campaign. Wisconsin also assumed the responsibility of the local anti-surface warfare coordinator for the Northern Persian Gulf Surface Action Group.|$|E

25|$|The table {{shows the}} {{majority}} of conventional arms imported by Iraq during the 1970s, when the regime was building up the armies which were to attack Iran in 1980, were supplied by the Soviet Union and its satellites, principally Czechoslovakia. The only substantial Western arms supplier to Iraq was France, which {{continued to be a}} major supplier until 1990, when <b>Iraq</b> <b>invaded</b> <b>Kuwait</b> and all legal arms transfers to Iraq ended.|$|E
50|$|Aug: <b>Iraq</b> <b>invades</b> <b>Kuwait.</b> Crude {{and product}} prices soar upward; {{exchange}} markets react wildly to any middle east news events; cash markets dominate prices after trading hours; jet fuel prices rise to record spreads over other products due {{to increase in}} defense demand. In late August, OPEC president fails to revive floundering attempts to organize a formal OPEC meeting to discuss crisis/production strategies. Informal meetings held in Vienna result in record price falls. Conflicting reports of promises to increase OPEC output to compensate for embargo of Iraq and Kuwait oil further compound market uncertainties.|$|R
50|$|After grueling training, the Scout Sniper {{course is}} left with eight candidates, among them Swofford, now a sniper, and Swofford's roommate Corporal Alan Troy who becomes his spotter. When <b>Iraq</b> <b>invades</b> <b>Kuwait,</b> Swofford's unit is {{deployed}} to the Arabian Peninsula {{as a part of}} Operation Desert Shield. Eager for combat, the Marines find themselves bored with remedial training, constant drills, and a routine monotony that feeds their boredom, and prompts them to talk about the unfaithful girlfriends and wives waiting for them at home. They even erect a bulletin board featuring photographs and brief notes telling what perfidies the women had committed.|$|R
50|$|In August 1990, <b>Iraq</b> <b>invaded</b> {{neighboring}} <b>Kuwait</b> and McConnell {{personnel and}} aircraft were deployed throughout the Middle East, performing refueling missions of Coalition aircraft {{in support of}} Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm to help eject the invaders from the small kingdom of Kuwait.|$|R
25|$|When <b>Iraq</b> <b>invaded</b> <b>Kuwait</b> in 1990, Syria {{joined the}} US-led {{coalition}} against Iraq. This led to improved {{relations with the}} US and other Arab states. Syria participated in the multilateral Southwest Asia Peace Conference in Madrid in October 1991, and during the 1990s engaged in direct negotiations with Israel. These negotiations failed over the Golan Heights issue {{and there have been}} no further direct Syrian-Israeli talks since President Hafez al-Assad's meeting with then President Bill Clinton in Geneva in March 2000.|$|E
25|$|After <b>Iraq</b> <b>invaded</b> <b>Kuwait</b> in 1990 {{and much}} of the world responded by {{amassing}} military assets in the region, the United States Army faced the possibility of experiencing chemical or biological (CB) attack. The possibility of CB attack forced the army to respond with NBC defense crash courses in theater. Troops deployed to the Gulf with protective masks at the ready, protective clothing was made available to those troops whose vicinity to the enemy or mission required it. Large scale drills were conducted in the desert to better acclimatize troops to wearing the bulky protective clothing (called MOPP gear) in hot weather conditions.|$|E
25|$|Operation Desert Shield {{commenced}} in August 1990 when <b>Iraq</b> <b>invaded</b> <b>Kuwait.</b> The 8th SOS was {{deployed to}} Saudi Arabia {{as a deterrent}} against the Iraqi threat to its southern neighbor. In January 1991, when Iraq failed to comply with United Nations directives to withdraw from Kuwait, the proven skills of the 8th SOS were called on once again as Operation Desert Shield escalated into Operation Desert Storm. The 8th SOS {{played a pivotal role}} in the success of coalition forces as they liberated Kuwait by dropping 11 15,000-pound BLU-82 bombs and 23 million leaflets and conducting numerous aerial refuelings of special operations helicopters.|$|E

25|$|In August 1990, <b>Iraq</b> <b>invaded</b> <b>Kuwait,</b> {{triggering}} the Gulf War between Iraq {{and a large}} allied force, led by the United States. Iraq attacked Israel with 39 Scud missiles. Israel did not retaliate at {{request of}} the U.S., fearing that if Israel responded against Iraq, other Arab nations might desert the allied coalition. Israel provided gas masks for both the Palestinian population and Israeli citizens, while Netherlands and the United States deployed Patriot defense batteries in Israel as protection against the Scuds. In May 1991, during a 36-hour period, 15,000 Beta Israel (Ethiopian Jews) were secretly airlifted to Israel. The coalition's victory in the Gulf War opened new possibilities for regional peace, and in October 1991 the U.S. President, George H.W. Bush, and Soviet Union Premier, Mikhail Gorbachev, jointly convened a historic meeting in Madrid of Israeli, Lebanese, Jordanian, Syrian, and Palestinian leaders. Shamir opposed the idea but agreed in return for loan guarantees to help with absorption of immigrants from the former Soviet Union. His participation in the conference led {{to the collapse of}} his (right-wing) coalition.|$|E
500|$|Aware of the {{violence}} {{going on in the}} Somali countryside, Ambassador Bishop felt [...] "the odds were better than even that we would have to leave Mogadishu under less than favorable circumstances." [...] On August 1, Ambassador Bishop visited United States Central Command—the military command for the Middle East and Northeast Africa—where he worked with military experts to review the embassy's Emergencies and Evacuation (E) plan until he was [...] "satisfied...that [...] realized that it might have to conduct an evacuation from Mogadishu and was prepared to do that." [...] A few hours after his visit, <b>Iraq</b> <b>invaded</b> <b>Kuwait.</b> The US was mobilizing assets for a response when Ambassador Bishop arrived in Mogadishu on September 6. The primary interest of the Ambassador was to maintain the US military's permission and access to airfields and ports in Mogadishu and Berbera, which the US had negotiated in 1979. This was especially important given the mobilization for intervention in Kuwait, Somalia's strategic location near the Arabian Peninsula and the mouth of the Red Sea, and because Saudi Arabia would not allow US troops on their soil. The embassy was also home to a large number of USAID staff, although the spread of unrest into the countryside was making their work increasingly difficult.|$|E
2500|$|In 1990, <b>Iraq</b> <b>invaded</b> <b>Kuwait.</b> The {{invasion}} of Kuwait by Iraqi forces {{led to the}} 1990–91 Gulf War. Egypt, Qatar, Syria and Saudi Arabia joined a multinational coalition that opposed Iraq. Displays of support for Iraq by Jordan and Palestine resulted in strained relations between many of the Arab states. After the war, a so-called [...] "Damascus Declaration" [...] formalized an alliance for future joint Arab defensive actions between Egypt, Syria, and the GCC member states.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{imposition}} and {{passing of the}} Resolution 660, Resolution 661, and the Resolution 665, Sharif sided with the United Nations on Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. A major international incident {{took place in the}} Middle East with <b>Iraq</b> <b>invading</b> the <b>Kuwait</b> which dismayed the world. Sharif's government criticised <b>Iraq</b> for <b>invading</b> the fellow Muslim country, which strained Pakistan's relationships with Iraq. The relationships continued to be strained as Pakistan seek to tighten its relations with Iran, and his foreign policy continued by Benazir Bhutto, Pervez Musharraf until the removal of Saddam Hussein in 2003.|$|R
50|$|In August 1990, <b>Iraq</b> <b>invaded</b> and annexed <b>Kuwait.</b> This {{subsequently}} led {{to military}} intervention by United States-led {{forces in the}} First Gulf War.

5000|$|In 1990 Bin Laden {{returned}} to Saudi Arabia {{a hero of}} jihad, celebrated in the Saudi press as a pious, courageous warrior who, along with his Arab legion, [...] "had brought down the mighty superpower" [...] of the Soviet Union. However, {{at about the same}} time <b>Iraq</b> <b>invaded</b> neighbor <b>Kuwait</b> and bin Laden was alarmed at the prospect that foreign non-Muslim troops would enter the kingdom to fight Iraq.

2500|$|When <b>Iraq</b> <b>invaded</b> <b>Kuwait</b> in 1990, Saddam Hussein's move {{took nearly}} {{everyone}} by surprise. [...] General Norman Schwarzkopf, {{who was in}} charge of the CENTCOM (Central Command) area telephoned the Pentagon on August 8 and asked that the Air Force [...] "put planners to work on a strategic bombing campaign aimed at Iraq's military, which would provide the retaliatory options we needed." [...] Schwarzkopf needed two things: a way to defend Saudi Arabia, and the ability to strike Iraq if Saddam made a crazy move.|$|E
2500|$|When <b>Iraq</b> <b>invaded</b> <b>Kuwait</b> in 1990, Tariq Aziz {{served as}} the {{international}} spokesman {{in support of the}} military action. He claimed the invasion was justified because Kuwait's increased oil production was harming Iraqi oil revenues. He condemned Arab states for [...] "subservience to the United States' hegemony in the Middle East and their support for punitive sanctions." [...] On 9 January 1991, Aziz was involved in the Geneva Peace Conference which included the United States Secretary of State, James Baker. The goal of the meeting was to discuss a possible resolution to the occupation of Kuwait.|$|E
2500|$|In August 1990, totalitarian <b>Iraq</b> <b>invaded</b> <b>Kuwait,</b> on {{the shores}} of the Persian Gulf. Within days the {{squadron}} began flying missions to the Middle Easr as part of Operation Desert Shield, the effort to deter further aggression from Iraq. The operations tempo was unprecedented. [...] By January 1991, Desert Shield became Desert Storm, as allied air power was unleashed upon the invaders with irresistible force. The squadron joined the rest of the Military Airlift Command in providing round-the-clock airlift to the Middle East, keeping the air war supplied, and aiding the buildup of ground forces for the highly successful, though brief ground war in February. Before long, Kuwait was free, although the tremendous effort put forth by the squadron had accelerated the aging process of its C-141s. The increased payloads and almost incessant flying would have lasting negative effects on the fleet.|$|E
50|$|On August 2, 1990, <b>Iraq</b> <b>invaded</b> and annexed <b>Kuwait.</b> The United States led an {{international}} coalition which heavily bombed Iraq and freed Kuwait in 1991. After this war, sanctions were imposed on Iraq {{as well as}} a north and south no fly zones, and during the 1990s, Iraq was frequently bombed by American and British aircraft in small sorties.|$|R
25|$|In August 1990, <b>Iraq</b> <b>invaded</b> its neighbor, <b>Kuwait.</b> The {{resulting}} international outcry led to {{the largest}} U.S. troop build-up and deployment overseas since the Vietnam War. In the fall of that year, Fort Riley was notified to begin mobilization of troops and equipment for deployment to the Persian Gulf. Between November 1990 and January 1991, soldiers and equipment were deployed overseas.|$|R
50|$|The EE-T1 was {{considered}} for service with the Saudi Arabian Army. It was evaluated against the French AMX 40, the American M1 Abrams, and the British Challenger 1 and {{emerged as the}} winner. The Osorio was quite cheap and affordable while having better results in the trials than the other three MBTs. In September 1989, Saudi Arabia quietly opted for the M1 Abrams instead and only announced its new decision shortly after <b>Iraq</b> <b>invaded</b> neighboring <b>Kuwait,</b> triggering the Persian Gulf War. The two only prototypes {{were given to the}} Brazilian Army as a result of Engesa going bankrupt.|$|R
2500|$|After <b>Iraq</b> <b>invaded</b> <b>Kuwait</b> on 2 August 1990, Powell {{claimed that}} since Britain {{was not an}} ally of Kuwait in the [...] "formal sense" [...] and because {{the balance of power}} in the Middle East had ceased to be a British concern after the end of the British Empire, Britain should not go to war. Powell claimed that [...] "Saddam Hussein has a long way to go yet before his troops come {{storming}} up the beaches of Kent or Sussex". On 21 October, he wrote, [...] "The world is full of evil men engaged in doing evil things. That does not make us policemen to round them up nor judges to find them guilty and to sentence them. What is so special about the ruler of Iraq that we suddenly discover that we are to be his jailers and his judges?... we as a nation have no interest in the existence or non-existence of Kuwait or, for that matter, Saudi Arabia as an independent state. I sometimes wonder if, when we shed our power, we omitted to shed our arrogance".|$|E
2500|$|At Camp Lejeune the 2nd Marines' {{primary mission}} was {{to act as a}} force in readiness. This entailed daily training, {{participation}} in annual training exercises, and overseas deployments. Among the continuing contingencies were making annual [...] "Med Cruises" [...] as the Sixth Fleet landing force and intermittent forays into the Caribbean. Elements of the 2nd Marines landed at Beirut in 1958, participated in quarantine operations during the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, and stability operations in the Dominican Republic in 1965. The regiment remained stateside throughout the Vietnam War, but was called out when <b>Iraq</b> <b>invaded</b> <b>Kuwait</b> in August 1990. Regimental Landing Team 2 (RLT 2) comprised the ground combat element of the Marine Forces Afloat in the Persian Gulf during Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. A rescue team including regimental assets was formed {{on the spur of the}} moment to save Americans and other foreign nationals besieged by rebels in Mogadishu, Somalia. As it had during World War II, RLT 2 acted as a diversion force tying Iraqi forces to the coast while the main attack struck inland during the liberation of Kuwait in 1991. One battalion (2/2) was attached to the 6th Marines to breach the infamous Saddam Line then drive north to seal off Kuwait City. 2nd Marines was awarded a Navy Unit Commendation for its actions in Southwest Asia.|$|E
