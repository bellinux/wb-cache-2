5|$|Since the 18th century, {{scholars}} have occasionally put forth that Jesus {{was a political}} national messiah, but the evidence for this portrait is negligible. Likewise, the proposal that Jesus was a Zealot does not <b>fit</b> <b>with</b> the earliest strata of the Synoptic tradition.|$|E
5|$|A {{counterpart}} to Vermeer’s Girl with a Pearl Earring. A painting called Smiling Girl {{hangs in the}} National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. (bequest Andrew W.

It was attributed to Theo van Wijngaarden, friend and partner of van Meegeren, but may have been painted by van Meegeren.|$|E

50|$|During the 1930s, 5 H type were {{experimentally}} <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> pantographs of 5 different patterns. 376 was <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> a Simens Schukert pantograph, 377 was <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> a Fischer bow collector, 378 was <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> an ASEA pantograph, 379 was <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> a Metropolitan Vickers pantograph and 380 was <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> an English Electric pantograph. The pantographs on 376, 379 and 380 {{were all}} fitted {{on a small}} pantograph tower while 377 and 378 had their pantographs mounted on the roof itself. During the experiments, the pantographs were only used on the reserve track section {{which at the time}} was <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> a railway-like catenary overhead system rather than the traditional tramway-style overhead used {{on the rest of the}} system. Because the overhead at the time was not staggered to suit pantograph operation, the pantographs fitted all suffered from uneven wear and as a result the experiment ceased. Ironically, all the surviving H type trams were <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> pantographs 50 years later in October 1986.|$|R

5|$|Bede is {{somewhat}} reticent about {{the career of}} Wilfrid, a contemporary {{and one of the}} most prominent clerics of his day. This may be because Wilfrid's opulent lifestyle was uncongenial to Bede's monastic mind; it may also be that the events of Wilfrid's life, divisive and controversial as they were, simply did not <b>fit</b> <b>with</b> Bede's theme of the progression to a unified and harmonious church.|$|E
5|$|East Timorese animist {{belief systems}} did not <b>fit</b> <b>with</b> Indonesia's {{constitutional}} monotheism, resulting in mass conversions to Christianity. Portuguese clergy were replaced with Indonesian priests and Latin and Portuguese mass {{was replaced by}} Indonesian mass. Before the invasion, only 20 percent of East Timorese were Roman Catholics, and by the 1980s, 95 percent were registered as Catholics. With over 90 percent Catholic population, East Timor is currently {{one of the most}} densely Catholic countries in the world.|$|E

5|$|The creators likened {{themes of}} the episode to the Star Wars trilogy, {{referring}} to the revelations about Fox Mulder's father, and Sophie's Choice, referring to how the Mulders were forced to choose Fox or Samantha to be taken. Carter included the motif of the white buffalo after reading a news story about {{the birth of a}} white buffalo calf, feeling that the image was so potent he did not mind that it did not entirely <b>fit</b> <b>with</b> the Navajo beliefs used elsewhere in the episode.|$|E
5|$|When welding {{dissimilar}} metals, {{the joint}} {{must have an}} accurate <b>fit,</b> <b>with</b> proper gap dimensions and bevel angles. Care {{should be taken to}} avoid melting excessive base material. Pulsed current is particularly useful for these applications, as it helps limit the heat input. The filler metal should be added quickly, and a large weld pool should be avoided to prevent dilution of the base materials.|$|E
5|$|Adam Berry, the show's {{original}} score composer, used {{sound synthesis}} to simulate a small orchestra, and frequently alluded to existing famous pieces of music. Berry also used signature acoustic guitar and mandolin cues as leitmotifs for the show's establishing shots. After Berry left in 2001, Jamie Dunlap and Scott Nickoley of the Los Angeles-based Mad City Production Studios provided the show's original {{music for the}} next seven seasons. Since 2008, Dunlap has been credited as the show's sole score composer. Dunlap's contributions to the show {{are one of the few}} that are not achieved at the show's own production offices. Dunlap reads a script, creates a score using digital audio software, and then e-mails the audio file to South Park Studios, where it is edited to <b>fit</b> <b>with</b> the completed episode.|$|E

In 2008, she was named No. 89 in Maxims annual Hot 100 list.; the following year she was No. 77. In 2010, she was No. 82 and in 2011 she was No. 72. And in 2012 she was ranked 51. Keibler has declined each of two invitations from Playboy to pose in the nude for its magazine.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} stage of development, the game had no {{co-operative}} multiplayer mode; it focused on the story instead of the cyberpunk element. A year after development began, the game was sent for reworking because the studio thought they had not captured the essence of the Syndicate series. The team had little experience in making a co-operative games due to technological restraints, but decided to experiment with it. The internal reception of the co-op prototype was positive; testers said it <b>fit</b> <b>with</b> the canonical fiction of the franchise. The team had once worked on a competitive multiplayer mode for the game, but thought it was not original enough for inclusion. As the game lacked a cooperative multiplayer element, the developers abandoned the use of an online pass, unlike most EA games at that time.|$|E
5|$|Following the Soviet {{occupation}} of Latvia in 1940 Latvia was annexed by the Soviet Union and the Freedom Monument was considered for demolition, but no such move was carried out. Soviet sculptor Vera Mukhina is sometimes credited for rescuing the monument, because she considered {{it to be}} of high artistic value. Soviet propaganda attempted to alter the symbolic meaning of the monument to better <b>fit</b> <b>with</b> Communist ideology, but it remained a symbol of national independence to the general public. Indeed, on June 14, 1987, about 5,000 people gathered at the monument to commemorate {{the victims of the}} Soviet regime and to lay flowers. This rally renewed the national independence movement, which culminated three years later in the re-establishment of Latvian sovereignty {{after the fall of the}} Soviet regime.|$|E

5|$|Hindman's assassins {{were never}} caught, and many {{theories}} regarding their identities have circulated throughout the years. In 1869, a white prisoner at the Phillips County jail told officials that he overheard two black inmates, Sip Cameron and Heyward Grant, discussing the crime. Grant supposedly {{confessed to the}} crime, saying the murder {{was part of a}} larger plot to seek revenge for the killing of Lee Morrison, a black person from Helena who had been hanged on September 27, 1868. Grant's claims did not <b>fit</b> <b>with</b> the facts of the murder, and his statements were dismissed from the investigation. No further leads ever developed, so the case was never reopened. Hindman was buried at Evergreen Cemetery (later named Maple Hill Cemetery) in Helena, near the grave of his friend Patrick Cleburne.|$|E
5|$|Hoshino {{thought that}} in a Victorian setting, {{long-haired}} girls tended to become the central character. After considering this, she believed a short-haired girl would stand out more and be much cuter. However, her editor wanted the character to have long hair, believing this would be better received by readers. As a result, Lenalee has long hair in the early chapters of the manga. Nevertheless, Hoshino took advantage of Lenalee's fight against the Level 3 Akuma to generate an impact strong enough to cause her to lose some of her hair in the process. Hoshino paid the most attention to Lenalee's uniform wanting to design clothing that would be sexually appealing. As a result, her uniform included a mini-skirt. However, Hoshino notes that the design does not <b>fit</b> <b>with</b> the manga's setting and states that {{it is best to}} treat Lenalee's uniform as fan service.|$|E
5|$|New York City actress Ash ("Liz") Sroka voices Tali {{throughout}} the Mass Effect trilogy, her first {{role in a}} video game. Sroka auditioned for three different roles: the female Commander Shepard, Tali'Zorah, and one other female character. After initially receiving the role of Tali, she was still unsure of how much material there was. Ginny McSwain gave voice direction, and would generally take two takes—the first to use, the second as back-up, and occasionally a third or more if the recording did not <b>fit</b> <b>with</b> what she wanted. Recording sessions would generally last about four hours. Sroka herself is not a gamer, though she says she enjoys the character of Tali and is happy to have landed the role.|$|E

5|$|Passenger {{transport}} was of two types; trains that {{corresponded with}} the ferries and connected with trains at Tinnoset, and commuter trains transporting workers to the plants at Rjukan. The commuter trains were initiated in 1913, and Norsk Hydro started building housing at Ingolfsland and Tveito, and both Ingolfsland and Miland got their own stops, and from 1919 stations. The two kilometers (one mile) commuter train from Rjukan to Ingofsland took five minutes; a month pass cost NOK 2.50 for employees and their families. There were seventeen departures {{in each direction}} per week, timed to <b>fit</b> <b>with</b> the working times at the plant. This increased to 58 in 1916, when a new stop at Tveito was opened.|$|E
5|$|The Alpine Spaniel is an extinct {{breed of}} dog {{which was used}} in {{mountain}} rescues by the Augustinian Canons, who run hospices in the region around the Great St. Bernard Pass. The spaniel was a large dog notable for its thick curly coat. One {{of the most famous}} specimens of the Alpine Spaniel is Barry, however his preserved body has been modified {{on more than one occasion}} to <b>fit</b> <b>with</b> descriptions of the extinct breed from earlier time periods. Due to the conditions in the Alps, and a series of accidents, extinction was discussed as a possibility by authors during the 1830s, and at some point prior to 1847 the entire breed was reduced to a single example due to disease. Evidence held at the Natural History Museum in Bern show that two distinct breeds of dog were being used in the area during this time period. The breed is thought to be the predecessor to the modern St. Bernard and the Clumber Spaniel.|$|E
