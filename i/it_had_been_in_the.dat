5|$|During the 20th {{century the}} old wool {{industry}} in Frome declined, although the last fabric mill at Wallsbridge did not close until 1965. As a result, the population fell {{and in the}} 1930s it was slightly smaller than <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mid 19th century. Other industries such as printing, light engineering, metal casting, carpeting and dairying continued, many taking old premises from the cloth mills and others being sited at the new Marston Road Trading Estate which led to growth after World War II, including the construction of council houses.|$|E
5|$|Justice Hayne {{concluded}} that the detention scheme in the Migration Act did not contravene Chapter III because, fundamentally, it was not punitive. The Act did not make being in Australia without a visa an offence (although <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past), and in reality he considered the mandatory detention scheme to be not that different from {{a system in which}} all people were prevented from entering Australia without permission at all.|$|E
50|$|Marthall cum Warford <b>had</b> <b>been</b> a {{township}} <b>in</b> Rostherne ancient parish, and <b>had</b> <b>been</b> {{created a}} separate civil parish <b>in</b> 1866. <b>It</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> Bucklow Hundred.

5|$|After its {{perihelion}} passage, {{the comet}} {{moved into the}} southern celestial hemisphere. The comet was much less impressive to southern hemisphere observers than <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> northern hemisphere, but southerners {{were able to see}} the comet gradually fade from view {{during the second half of}} 1997. The last naked-eye observations were reported in December 1997, which meant that the comet had remained visible without aid for 569days, or about 18 and a half months. The previous record had been set by the Great Comet of 1811, which was visible to the naked eye for about 9 months.|$|E
5|$|Guest {{was born}} in Grahamstown, Cape Colony. His {{grandfather}} had moved the family there, leaving Kidderminster, England, where <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> printing business for three generations. He saw active service in the Second Boer War, enlisting despite being underage, {{and again in the}} First World War, when he was injured in France. His legal career began while back in Southern Rhodesia between those two wars. He won a case against Sir Charles Coghlan, at the time Premier of Southern Rhodesia, and Coghlan invited him to become a partner in his firm, which became known as Coghlan, Welsh & Guest. On his return from the First World War, Guest took responsibility for the Salisbury practice.|$|E
5|$|The font has a Norman {{bowl with}} lead lining {{set on a}} 19th-century base. It {{consists}} of a round bowl carved with figures, and simple ornamentation. For many years <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> garden of nearby Dorfold Hall before being reinstated in the church. At {{the east end of}} the south aisle are carved stones, some in sandstone, others in limestone. The style of the limestone stones suggests a date {{at the end of the}} 11thcentury and that of the sandstone stones around 1100. They are considered to be among the most significant pieces of Romanesque sculpture in the country. There is a ring of six bells. Five of these were cast by Rudhall of Gloucester in the 18thcentury and the sixth by John Taylor & Co in 1893. The parish registers begin in 1653 and the churchwardens' accounts in 1755. The two-manual organ was made by Alex Young and Sons of Manchester in 1897, and was renovated in 1939, and again in 1997.|$|E

5|$|The highest {{recorded}} {{population for}} Shapinsay is 974, in 1881. Since then, {{the population of}} the island has steadily declined; {{less than a third of}} that number was recorded in the 2001 census. The rate of absolute population loss was lower in the last decades of the 20th century than <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first half of that century. In 2001, Shapinsay had a population of 300, a decline of 6.8% from 322 in 1991. This was greater than the population decline for Orkney overall in the same period, which was 1.9%. However, the loss in population on Shapinsay was less than that experienced by most Orkney islands, most of which experienced declines of more than 10%. The number of persons per hectare on Shapinsay was 0.1, similar to the 0.2 persons per hectare across Orkney. At the time of the 2011 census the usually resident population had increased to 307. During the same period Scottish island populations as a whole grew by 4% to 103,702.|$|E
5|$|Harry, Ron, Ginny, and Lockhart {{return to}} the main castle and reunite with McGonagall, Dumbledore, and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley. Ginny, whose {{possession}} by Voldemort caused all of the petrification and troubles {{over the course of}} the year, is given a reprieve by Dumbledore, who reasons that greater wizards have been duped by Voldemort before and takes great interest in the qualities of the diary, which Harry gives to him. Lucius Malfoy bursts in after this meeting, demanding to know why and how Dumbledore has returned to the school and accompanied by Dobby, revealing the family to whom he is enslaved. The house-elf also provides Harry with unspoken cues regarding the diary’s ownership: While it was Tom Riddle’s, <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Malfoys’ possession, and Harry returns it, devising a scenario involving his own sock that frees Dobby from the Malfoys’ employment, thus provoking an attack on Harry, only for Dobby to jump in and save him. The petrified students are cured, the end-of-year exams are cancelled (much to Hermione’s chagrin), Hagrid comes back in the middle of the final feast, and Harry returns to Privet Drive in higher spirits than he last left it.|$|E
5|$|The nearly {{decade and}} a half of wars greatly {{weakened}} the Spanish American economies and political institutions, which hindered the region's potential economic development for most of the nineteenth century and resulted in the enduring instability the region experienced. Independence destroyed the de facto trade bloc that was the Spanish Empire - Manila galleons and Spanish treasure fleets in particular. After independence, trade among the new Spanish American nations was less than <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> colonial period. Once the ties were broken, the small populations of most of the new nations provided little incentive to entice Spanish American producers to recreate the old trade patterns. In addition, the protection against European competition, which the Spanish monopoly had provided to the manufacturing sectors of the economy, ended. Due to expediency, protective tariffs for these sectors, in particular textile production, were permanently dropped and foreign imports beat out local production. This greatly affected Native communities, which in many parts of Spanish America, specialized in supplying finished products to the urban markets, albeit using pre-industrial techniques. The wars also greatly affected the principal economic sector of the region, mining. Silver production in Bolivia halved after independence and it dropped by three quarters in Mexico.|$|E

25|$|Space, as {{an element}} of architecture, was {{utilised}} differently from the way <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Middle Ages.

25|$|One {{interpretation}} {{of the work is}} that it depicts the rampant prostitution in the Bois de Boulogne, a large park at the western outskirts of Paris, at the time. This prostitution was common knowledge in Paris, but was considered a taboo subject unsuitable for a painting.

The two parts were later rejoined and are known collectively as the Codex Madrid or Tro-Cortesianus; they remain displayed in Madrid.|$|E
25|$|The Signal Corps' {{role in the}} Spanish–American War of 1898 and the {{subsequent}} Philippine Insurrection was on a grander scale than <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Civil War. In addition to visual signaling, including heliograph, the corps supplied telephone and telegraph wire lines and cable communications, fostered the use of telephones in combat, employed combat photography, and renewed the use of balloons. Shortly after the war, the Signal Corps constructed the Washington-Alaska Military Cable and Telegraph System (WAMCATS) {{also known as the}} Alaska Communications System (ACS), introducing the first wireless telegraph in the Western Hemisphere.|$|E

The river remains vulnerable to these pollution events, such as the one that occurred in October 2009 when an accidental release of cyanide from a factory into the sewer system in Stoke-on-Trent, affected the treatment works at Strongford. This resulted in the release of raw sewage and the chemical into the river, killing thousands of fish, and posing a health risk to river users as far south as Burton.|$|E
