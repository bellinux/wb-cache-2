50|$|A related {{process is}} the sepia <b>Diazo</b> <b>print,</b> which {{produced}} either a positive or negative print in dark brown and light tones. The negative versions of these prints were most often produced as intermediaries, like the earlier Van Dyke process, to allow corrections and revisions without disturbing the original drawing. In the negative printing process, additional resins and oils were sometimes added to the paper support to increase translucency. Positive sepia prints, generally made on opaque paper, were typically used {{as an alternative to}} positive blueline Diazo prints.|$|E
50|$|If {{the lines}} are too light, it is also {{possible}} to run the blue-line through the developing chamber once more, which often increases the contrast of the lines relative to the base media. Repeated lack of contrast and light prints is also a tip-off that the operator needs to adjust the speed or amount of ammonia. Sometimes both the master and the <b>diazo</b> <b>print</b> are inadvertently fed through the developing chamber together. If this occurs, one simply peels the master from the diazo paper and runs the diazo sheet through the developer once more to more fully develop the lines.|$|E

50|$|Both {{blueline}} and sepia {{prints were}} often poorly and cheaply processed, resulting in undesirable residual chemical content. Off-gassing of sulfurous compounds, image fading, and yellowing {{of the paper}} support are common signs of degradation and are not reversible. <b>Diazo</b> <b>prints</b> are also highly light-sensitive and can fade to illegibility within {{a short period of}} exposure to ultraviolet light.|$|R

50|$|Traditional {{blueprints}} {{have largely}} been replaced by more modern, less expensive printing methods and digital displays. In the early 1940s, cyanotype blueprint began to be supplanted by <b>diazo</b> <b>prints,</b> also known as whiteprints, which have blue lines on a white background; thus these drawings are also called blue-lines or bluelines. Other comparable dye-based prints are known as blacklines.|$|R
50|$|Drawings {{should be}} grouped and {{identified}} for ease in retrieval, preferably within folders that are cut {{to fit the}} full dimensions of the corresponding container. As with rolled materials, the potentially damaging chemical interactions of print processes should be considered when grouping drawings in folders. Wherever possible, for example, blueprints should be segregated from diazotypes, and sepia <b>diazo</b> <b>prints</b> should be stored alone to the extent possible.|$|R
50|$|In archival practice, <b>Diazo</b> <b>prints</b> are {{the most}} common reprographic format {{encountered}} in late 20th-century architectural collections. However, their inherent fragility and fugitive images, as compared with blueprints and earlier processes, makes their care problematic. Diazos—particularly sepia prints, which readily transfer color to adjacent papers—should be physically segregated from all other types of media. Exposure to light and pollutants in air should be minimized, and wherever possible, original drawings or reformatted prints should be kept for reference.|$|R

50|$|<b>Diazo</b> <b>prints</b> {{remain in}} use in some {{applications}} {{but in many cases}} have been replaced by xerographic print processes similar to standard copy machine technology using toner on bond paper. More recently, designs created using computer-aided design techniques may be transferred as a digital file directly to a computer printer or plotter; in some applications, paper is avoided altogether and work and analysis is done directly from digital displays. Another common modern method of copying is the use of large-format scanners. These digitize an image which can then be printed with a large-format plotter.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} the complex issue of the {{preservation}} and maintenance of architectural records as a distinctive type of archival material, addressing the problems of care and storage of diverse oversize documents done on different supports: architectural drawings on drafting cloth, waxed cloth, paper, plastic film; reproductions such as blueprints, <b>diazo</b> <b>prints,</b> {{and other types of}} non-textual documents. Attention is paid to all types of damage caused both by internal factors, i. e. resulting from the nature of the support material, and by external factors involved in the degradation of architectural archival material. The paper also presents comparative conservation methods applied to architectural documents kept in the Archives of Yugoslavia. In conclusion, it points to the importance of preventive care as regards storage conditions, handling and display of this type of archival material...|$|R
50|$|By {{the middle}} of the 20th century, wet-process reprographic {{techniques}} such as blueprinting, Pellet, and Van Dyke printing were largely superseded by various dry-printing processes. The most common of these is the Diazotype process, refined in the 1920s, which used paper supports sensitized with diazonium salts, a coupling agent, and an acid stabilizer to produce a dark line on a white ground. The <b>Diazo</b> positive <b>print</b> was considered more readable than a negative blueprint, and the dry process eliminated the image distortion of wet paper.|$|R

50|$|The {{contact copying}} process {{was used in}} the early days of {{photography}} and sunlight-exposed blueprints; it is still used in amateur photography, silkscreen printing, offset printing, and photochemical machining, such as the manufacture of Printed circuit boards. By the early 20th century, blueprinting (producing white lines) or <b>diazo</b> blue line <b>printing</b> used contact-rollers rather than flat-glass exposure.|$|R
50|$|A quirk of <b>diazo</b> {{blueline}} <b>prints</b> is {{that with}} continued exposure to ultraviolet light, either from natural sunlight or from typical office fluorescent lighting, a blueline copy can fade over a span of months (indoors) or just days (outdoors), becoming illegible. This fading process thus requires reduplication of the original documents every few months in a typical office for any project using bluelines. Hence, blueline drawings that are used as engineering working copy prints have to be protected {{when not in use}} by storing them in flat files in the dark. Incandescent lighting was often used in areas where blueline engineering prints needed to be posted on a wall for long periods to hinder rapid fading.|$|R
