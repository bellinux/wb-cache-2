40|$|It is {{now widely}} {{agreed that the}} World Trade Organization (WTO) is in trouble, {{struggling}} to deliver the national rewards available from liberalising through multilateral negotiations. Prime Minister Howard and President Bush have committed to help restore {{the ability of the}} WTO system to deliver those rewards. This paper examines the contribution of <b>domestic</b> <b>transparency</b> procedures, introduced by and operating within participating countries, in dealing with the domestic causes of the problem facing the multilateral system. It explains the relevance of the proposal, prepared for Prime Minister Howard, in meeting the commitment he has taken. The Hong Kong Ministerial Meeting in December 2005 provides an opportunity to advance such a proposal and, in doing so, enhance our own trade performance. The author was involved, with Alf Rattigan and John Crawford, in establishing the Industries Assistance Commission and was its chairman from 1985 to 1988. He {{was a member of the}} international study group — chaired by the former Director-General of the GATT, Olivier Long — which drew attention during the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations (1986 – 1994) to the need for <b>domestic</b> <b>transparency</b> in trade policy. He co-authored a review of trade policy conduct of industrial nations, which was published by the National Centre for Development Studies in 1996. He and Professor Ross Garnaut prepared a <b>domestic</b> <b>transparency</b> proposal for Prime Minister Howard in February 2004 to provide the basis for an Australian initiative in the Doha Round. This paper explains how this proposal would contribute to restoring an effective WTO system by enabling domestic economic welfare to replace domestic political pressures as the driver of multilateral trade negotiations. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{significant}} number of developing countries are adopting more liberal trade and industrial policies. However, there is interest in how to phase-in and how to maintain the momentum of liberalization. Analysis at the World Bank stresses {{the need for the}} correct mix of macro-economic and trade policies if trade liberalization is to bring about the expected benefits. There has also been a considerable amount of work on the phasing-in of trade liberalization and the sequencing of trade and macro-economic reforms. In this context the recent proposals in the Uruguay Round by Australia, Canada, Hong Kong and New Zealand concerning <b>domestic</b> <b>transparency</b> in the formulation of national trade policies is of interest. Experience in some of these countries and in some developing countries gives us some useful insights on how such a mechanism might operate {{if it is to be}} effective in maintaining the momentum of liberalization and in seeing that the reform process is efficiently introduced...|$|E
40|$|On 16 November last year, G 20 leaders made a {{commitment}} to resist protectionism. According to the World Bank, by the end of February 2009, seventeen of the twenty had already ‘implemented 47 measures whose effect is to restrict trade. ’ When the leaders meet in Pittsburgh on 24 September 2009, they will have an opportunity to review their commitment and decide how best to strengthen it. In a new Lowy Institute Policy Brief, Bill Carmichael, Saul Eslake and Mark Thirlwell argue that the advice that G 20 leaders have received to date fails to deal with the underlying causes of protectionism. Protectionism results from decisions taken by governments at home, for domestic reasons. As a consequence, any effective response to protectionism needs to begin at home. The authors therefore propose that G 20 leaders should sponsor <b>domestic</b> <b>transparency</b> arrangements in individual countries, in order to provide public advice about the economy-wide costs of domestic protection...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{effects on}} {{national}} welfare and market access of two important public procurement practices (discrimination and non-transparency) are analyzed {{with an eye}} to the ongoing international discussions on procurement reform in the Doha Round as well as regional integration agreements. The analysis suggests that the welfare payoffs of adopting mechanisms that foster <b>domestic</b> competition and <b>transparency</b> are likely to be greater than the return to efforts to ban international discrimination. However, improved transparency is unlikely to result in significant enhancements in market access, which in turn raises questions about the likely enforceability of a WTO transparency agreement...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects on}} {{national}} welfare and on market access of two public procurement practices, discrimination and non-transparency, are examined. Both policies have become prominent {{in international trade}} negotiations, such as the ongoing Doha Round of WTO trade talks. Our analysis shows that fostering either <b>domestic</b> competition or <b>transparency</b> in state contracting tends to improve welfare. In contrast, we find no clear-cut effect on market access of ending discrimination or improving transparency. This mismatch between market access and welfare effects {{may account for the}} slower progress in negotiating procurement disciplines in trade agreements than for traditional border measures such as tariffs.

40|$|Since the mid- 1990 s, Botswana {{has pursued}} {{a policy of}} {{telecommunications}} liberalisation. This article, based on fieldwork conducted in Botswana {{in the summer of}} 2000, analyzes several notable aspects of the process of reform and denotes those worthy of emulation by other African states. The participation and protection of <b>domestic</b> telecommunication users, <b>transparency</b> in decision-making, the creation of an independent regulatory agency, and the introduction of competition in the form of private cellular service providers are among those policy features that are recommended for replication. Various facets of the tendering process and subsequent licences granted to the mobile operators as well as recent legislation are also examined and commended.

40|$|The {{creation}} of the WTO in 1995 has brought GATT Article X (and other procedural provisions) and Article XX {{to the forefront of}} WTO jurisprudence. The provisions of the WTO Agreements reflect the reality of the administrative state and with it the recognition that categories of regulation (such as sanitary and phyto-sanitary regulations or technical regulations or standards) are legitimate irrespective of their impact on trade. The focus of WTO panels and the Appellate Body has shifted from harmonization and mutual recognition to transparency in application and administration. It has also required the WTO dispute settlement mechansim to engaged in constant balancing of interests on a case by case basis and this in turn requires the WTO bodies to focus on the legitimacy of the process both at the national and international level. This means that the WTO will increasingly focus on: (1) internal transparency of its own domestic decision-making and (2) <b>domestic</b> <b>transparency</b> and predictability in the application of national measures that are a restraint on trade or are discriminatory, but nevertheless may be justificed as upholding important values consistent with the meaning of sustainable development...|$|E
40|$|While Bilateral and {{regional}} trade agreements can reduce trade barriers and help meet other objectives, their potential impact is limited and other options often {{may be more}} cost-effective. Key points • In line with global trends, Australia has recently entered {{a number of new}} bilateral {{and regional}} trade agreements (BRTAs) and is negotiating several more. • The Australian Government’s approach has been to negotiate comprehensive agreements that seek substantial reductions in trade barriers. – For merchandise trade, recent BRTAs have resulted in some significant bilateral tariff reductions both in Australia and in partner countries. – For services and investment trade, BRTAs typically limit discrimination between suppliers. – Australia’s agreements have often also included provisions on matters such as intellectual property, competition policy and trade facilitation. • Theoretical and quantitative analysis suggests that tariff preferences in BRTAs, if fully utilised, can significantly increase trade flows between partner countries, although some of this increase is typically offset by trade diversion from other countries. – The increase in national income from preferential agreements is likely to be modest. • The Commission has received little evidence from business to indicate that bilateral agreements to date have provided substantial commercial benefits. – This may be because the main factors that influence decisions to do business in other countries lie outside the scope of BRTAs. • Domestic economic reform offers relatively large economic benefits and should not be delayed to retain ‘bargaining coin’. • In the international arena, the Australian Government should continue to pursue progress in the Doha Round. Building the case for substantive reductions in trade barriers internationally requires improvements in <b>domestic</b> <b>transparency</b> and policy analysis within each country. • While BRTAs can reduce trade barriers and help meet other objectives, their potential impact is limited and other options often may be more cost-effective. • Current processes for assessing and prioritising BRTAs lack transparency and tend to oversell the likely benefits. • To help ensure that any further BRTAs entered into are in Australia’s interests: – Pre-negotiation modelling should include realistic scenarios and be overseen by an independent body. Alternative liberalisation options should also be considered. – A full and public assessment of a proposed agreement should be made after negotiations have concluded — covering all of the actual negotiated provisions. • The Government should also develop and publish an overarching trade policy strategy, to better coordinate and track the progress of trade policy initiatives, and to ensure that efforts are devoted to areas of greatest likely return...|$|E
40|$|We {{analyze the}} role of bureaucratic {{corruption}} {{in the context of}} infrastructure investment and public service provision by a foreign firm in a developing economy. This type of investment involves a relatively large sunk element, and so the investor may offer a bribe to avoid expropriation, as well as to obtain more favourable terms in the initial contract. We examine these issues for both a centralized and a decentralized bureaucracy, and we consider {{the role of}} transparency in each case. Among our results is that, provided there is <b>transparency,</b> <b>domestic</b> welfare and social efficiency may be enhanced by decentralization. The key factor underlying this result is that one bureaucrat in effect may collude with the investor to reduce the payoff of another bureaucrat...|$|R
40|$|Each {{state has}} {{always tried to}} promote development, {{prosperity}} and prosperity of its people. One methode that tends {{to be done by}} the state is to attract as many foreign investments into the country.

40|$|The {{domestic}} endorsement and {{institutionalization of}} transparency is of central {{importance to the}} implementation of global environmental policies. Studies often contend that interaction with international organizations (IOs) promotes <b>domestic</b> support for <b>transparency.</b> This article qualifies this conclusion and suggests that the positive effects of interaction with international organizations depend on the quality of IO decision-making processes, defined as their fairness, predictability, and effectiveness. Unfair, ineffective, and unpredictable decision-making processes in IOs can increase corruption, reduce legitimacy, and make officials blame transparency for unsatisfactory decision-making. The results build on a study of government officials in developing countries responsible for managing funds from the Clean Development Mechanism and the Multilateral Fund for the Implementation of the Montreal Protocol. Our findings suggest that government officials who perceive IO systems as unfair, ineffective, and unpredictable cultivate an adversarial relationship with media and NGOs and become more critical of the benefits of transparency...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there have been}} {{numerous}} calls for making the operations of international organizations more “transparent”. One element in these demands involves the idea that international negotiations should be open to the same level of outside scrutiny that is presumed to prevail with bargaining in <b>domestic</b> contexts. While <b>transparency</b> of this sort may have clear benefits by facilitating attempts to hold officials accountable, scholars have made less effort to consider whether making international bargaining more public might also have detrimental effects. I develop a game-theoretic model that provides four hypotheses about the relative benefits of open-door versus closed-door bargaining, and about the preferences of different actors with regard to this type of transparency. This model, which can be applied to both international and domestic contexts, helps extend positive theories about the design of institutions while also providing insights for the normative question of when transparency is desirable. I show that the hypotheses developed are supported both by historical evidence from eighteenth century disputes about publicity in national parliaments, and by evidenc...|$|R
40|$|The {{conclusions}} {{presented here}} {{sum up the}} contributions in the Special Issue regarding the managing of China's energy sector, particularly regarding the demand and profile of energy {{as well as the}} marketization of the sector. Strategic, organizational and policy issues relevant to the main theme are set out. Both demand and supply scenarios for the nation's energy are seen as in flux, as the economy slackens and dependence on imports rises. Unprecedented levels of urban environmental pollution and steady growth of energy consumption {{in the wake of a}} rising living standard have brought the issue to headline-prominence as never before. China's rapidly increasing renewable energy will not change its heavy reliance on coal and a lesser extent oil in the coming decade. After decades of transformation, China's energy sector now operates in a domestic market characterized by strong governmental influence and monopolistic state firms. Abroad, China's firms are exposed to heavier market pressure and competition. While the state's policies have succeeded in ensuring energy supplies and propelling China's renewable energy manufacturers into global prominence and opening up domestic market, much room for improvement exists in the competitiveness of the domestic market and <b>domestic</b> energy firms, <b>transparency</b> of pricing and the effectiveness of regulation...|$|R

40|$|Background and Aim: Domestic {{violence}} against women is a major health problem, {{as well as a}} violation of human rights. It adversely affects the physical, mental, and social well being of women, families and communities. This phenomenon exists in all countries around the world. Although its prevalence, strength, types, effects, and risk factors are different, it is not limited to any geographical zone or distinct social class. This article presents the views of Tehrani couples and experts on underlying factors causing domestic {{violence against}} women in Iran and action to be taken for prevention. Materials and Methods: This qualitative study was carried out through eight FGD meetings, in 2 days, with the participation of 50 couples. The couples were divided into 8 groups based on sex, education, and history of violence. Results of the FDGs were categorized and analyzed. Data were discussed in group meetings of 50 experts in different fields, such as health, medicine, law, education, and Islamic studies, from academic, policy making, governmental executive, and womens affairs organizations, divided into three groups of community general education and information dissemination, health system, and judiciary system. Results were discussed and finalized in a general meeting. Results: The couples and experts identified underlying factors in 4 categories socio-cultural, economic, legal, and medical. Actions to be taken for prevention and control were believed to be educational, legal, and supporting services. Conclusion: On the basis of the findings of this study, it was suggested that strategies/actions/services to solve the problem and reduce harm should include providing appropriate information and education for couples and the community; emphasizing the health system responsibility; empowering physicians and other health personnel to help women who are victims or susceptible to <b>domestic</b> violence; legal <b>transparency</b> and reforms; meeting legal needs; law reinforcement and implementation; providing safe shelters for victims; and establishment of a national center for research and planning on violence...|$|R
