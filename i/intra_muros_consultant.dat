40|$|Le Périphérique is a 35. 04 kms long {{inner ring}} road built around Paris {{following}} {{the line of the}} former defensive wall demolished in 1929. Ever since it opened in 1973 there have been attempts to reduce its physical impact on the landscape. It is generally taken as marking the administrative boundary of the city. At 50 km/h it takes 26 minutes to complete a full circle, the inside of which is always marked by red distance markers, the outer side by blue. This highly visual and strongly physical boundary has been seen as having a profound impact on the psychology of those living either side: There are 2. 2 million people <b>intra</b> <b>muros</b> (Parisiens) and 9. 6 million extra muros (banlieusards.) The former perceived as glamorous, the latter peripheral. The road has featured in film and literature as symbolising a divide between two worlds, {{and at the same time}} being a world of its own. This research explores the struggle for identity at this ‘periphery’ of Paris, the spatial manifestation of which begs the question: are you in Paris or not? The research charts a contemporary battle at the wall of Paris where the defence is being ‘breached’ by those outside who do not want to be seen as on the periphery and so want the symbolism of Paris extended beyond the wall; whilst at the same time the wall is ‘repaired’ or even ‘rebuilt’ by those who want to remain separate and not Parisian. Symbols, colours, signs, and material particular to one side or the other of this identity clash are the ordnance of this battle. In the case of Paris the struggle to assert identity is played both consciously and subconsciously. The research takes a deep mapping approach to understanding the periphery, drawing upon the work of William Least Heat-Moon as well as some of the more psychogeographical thinking of from Benjamin to Sinclair. The field work was carried out in the communes of St Mandé and Montreuil The findings suggest that Paris exhibits an ‘inverted periphery’ in which the walls of a city not seeking to extend its boundaries are being ‘attacked’ by those outside who emulate its imagery and so bring <b>intra</b> <b>muros</b> symbolism to their territory. Yet at the same time there is an institutional drive to reinforce the walls visually and retain extra muros identities. Should those seeking to reduce the physical impact of the Périphérique succeed Paris will, for the first time in its history, be left defenceless and be in risk of ‘invasion’...|$|R
40|$|During the {{excavations}} of {{the site}} of rue de Dinant in the historic centre of Brussels (Belgium), remains of the first city wall dating from the 13 th century have been discovered. <b>Intra</b> <b>muros</b> thick dark sediment units predating this wall are observed. These dark units are among the oldest occupation traces so far encountered in this higher, eastern, part of the historic centre of Brussels. In order to characterise them, and to understand the human activities and natural processes behind their formation, an interdisciplinary research, integrating archaeopedology and phytolith study, has been undertaken. This approach permitted us to identify a range of natural and cultural processes leading {{to the formation of}} these dark layers, and to characterise different activities. Remains of a hearth, old plough land (cropfields) and grassland have been identified, all activities referring to a rural landscape organisation. Later on, the area changes into an enormous silt extraction area, whereby Dark Earth is thrown into the dug pits. Finally, the construction of the first city wall marks the area as becoming part of the city.

In this article the main findings of a household travel survey held before and after the operation of a new bus line in the area will be discussed. Then what will be presented are the specific measures and interventions aiming at the safeguard, maintenance and enhancement of the special characteristics of this residential area, adopting a “green” mobility approach The Upper Town is a historic district situated in the north-east part of the <b>intra</b> <b>muros</b> city with traditional architecture and organic urban tissue. Steep slopes, a complex network of narrow paved streets, dead-ends, small glades and picturesque squares compose the road system. These characteristics cause unfavorable travel conditions for pedestrians, bicycles and vehicles. The findings of the research show that the improvement of infrastructure for pedestrians, the development of a dense public transport network connecting the district with the city centre, the improvement of the urban landscape and the preservation and enhancement of its spatial features are the main priorities. The operation of the new bus line has to meet the expectations of the residents and serve the mobility needs of the area. The participation of the citizens constitutes an important tool for the development, acceptance and implementation of an integrated and sustainable public transport system...|$|R
40|$|Na početku intenzivnoga gospodarskoga razvoja sredinom 19. stoljeća sisačka urbana legislativa omogućila je i početak arhitektonski određene zidane izgradnje u samom urbanom tkivu, na prostoru što ga u arheološkoj terminologiji nazivamo Siscia <b>intra</b> <b>muros.</b> S obzirom na tu činjenicu te na dotadašnje površno iskorištavanje opisanoga terena, svjetlo dana ugledala je stoljećima zatrpana rimska arheološka građa. Nekoliko entuzijasta sudjelovalo je u pokušaju njezina objedinjenja, sustavnoga istraživanja i znanstvene valorizacije te u pokušaju izrade topografije antičke Siscije. Ovdje ih spominjemo kronološki, kao i napore koje su uložili u klasifikaciju navedene građe, ovisno o dužnostima koje su tada obavljali i korespondenciji koju su ostavili u arhivu Arheološkoga muzeja u Zagrebu. Svrha je ovoga rada upotpuniti poznavanje osvita hrvatske arheološke znanosti. In {{the middle}} of the 19 th century Sisak and the {{surrounding}} area saw intense economic and social development. The key subject of these events was the construction of the railway line from Sisak to Zidani Most in 1862, when large-scale construction work was done along the route which abounded in archaeological remains from the Roman era. As an accompanying phenomenon, there was increased construction on the site which had in ancient times represented Siscia <b>intra</b> <b>muros.</b> A railway station was built, as well as many houses of larger dimensions belonging to the new, wealthy merchant class. When digging the foundations for these buildings, archaeological material was often encountered and usually transported to foreign museums and collections of antiquities, especially during the construction of railways, when the antiques were removed without supervision. This problem was recognized by many prominent Croatian social and political public officials, including Ivan Kukuljevi} Sakcinski, who attempted to organize the systematic collection and processing of antiquities from the Sisak area. Under the auspices of first the Society for Yugoslav History and Antiquities, and later the National Museum in Zagreb, many famous Croatian patriots such as Mijata Sabljar and Ivan Tkal~i} tried to explore the terrain of Sisak and record the archaeological importance of the findings. As they all had buisness responsibilities in the capital, their studies of antiquities from Sisak were not consistent, so the local population were appointed as commissioners of the Society for Yugoslav History and Antiquities or the National Museum in Zagreb. The first to perform this task were Alexander Bobek and Josip Jilk, with the help of Franjo Schloissnigg, and later Dragutin König. When Sisak was united into one administrative center, the preconditions for complex social action were created and “Siscia – the Society for the Excavation and Collection of Roman Antiquities in Sisak” was established, in which its Secretary, Dragutin Jagi}, held the most important role. “Siscia” as a society, after initial success, soon reduced its activities, and further archaeological research, as well as cooperation with the National Museum in Zagreb, was conducted by individuals such as Andrija Colussi, Ferdo Hefele and Milan pl. Šipuš. The aim {{of this study is to}} disclose unpublished correspondence of several of these researchers, regarding the archaeological excavations of Sisak and is limited to the second half of the 19 th century, in order to provide more complete knowledge of the dawn of Croatian archaeological science...|$|R
40|$|There is {{no clear}} {{evidence}} to suggest the presence of Christianity in Cyprus {{during the first three}} centuries AD. No Christian tombs or cemeteries were found on the island, with the exception of merely six crypto-Christian tombstones with pagan inscriptions. The use of + or symbol instead of the letter X is the only characteristic that differentiates Christian from pagan inscriptions. In the cemeteries of Tsambres and Aphendrica at Rizocarpasso and at Vasa of Kilani, lamps decorated with Christian symbols were found in rock-cut pagan tombs. From this it has been inferred that both pagan and Christian members of the same family shared the same tombs. Elaborate rock-cut tombs of an earlier age were later sanctified by Christians who either painted or carved crosses on their walls. Purely Christian cemeteries have not been found in Cyprus. From as early as the 4 th century, box-shaped tombs were used by Christians for the burial of their dead, always facing east-west. In AD 403, Saint Epiphanios was buried in a similar tomb lined with marble slabs. Perhaps this burial was the first <b>intra</b> <b>muros</b> burial, since before that, burials inside the walls of the city were prohibited. However, the prohibition of burials within the walls continued at least down to the 7 th or 8 th century. Burials within the walls and in churches were reserved for saints or famous bishops. As a rule, saints were buried in sarcophagi of marble, stone or ceramic, which were placed either in tombs or churches. In Cyprus, relics were not deposited under the altar; they were deposited in chapels attached to the sanctuary of the basilicas. Despite of the fact that almost all Early Christian basilicas in Cyprus have a narthex, this was very rarely intended for burial use. Two cases of built arcosolia inside churches (Ayia Paraskevi at Yeroskipou, and Ayia Athanasia at Rizocarpasso) have been dated to the 8 th century. From the 7 th century onwards, the immediate area around the churches was used as a Christian cemetery, {{as was the case with}} the basilica of Chryssopolitissa in Paphos, which was seized and destroyed by the Arabs in AD 653, at which time the middle aisle of the basilica, which lay outside the small 8 th-century church built on its ruins, was used as a burial site. This practice appears to have been applied in several other subsequent cases. Foulias Andréas, Papageorghiou Athanassios, Xydas Pandèlis. L’architecture funéraire à Chypre du Ier au Xe siècle.
