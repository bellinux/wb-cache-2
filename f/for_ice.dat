50|$|The National Transportation Safety Board {{determined}} that the probable cause was inadequate standards <b>for</b> <b>icing</b> operations while in flight, specifically {{the failure of the}} Federal Aviation Administration to establish adequate minimum airspeeds <b>for</b> <b>icing</b> conditions, leading to a loss of control when the airplane accumulated a thin, rough accretion of ice on its lifting surfaces.|$|R
5|$|The eastern market <b>for</b> <b>ice</b> in the U.S. {{was also}} changing. Cities like New York, Baltimore and Philadelphia saw their {{population}} {{boom in the}} second half of the century; New York tripled in size between 1850 and 1890, for example. This drove up the demand <b>for</b> <b>ice</b> considerably across the region. By 1879, householders in the eastern cities were consuming two thirds of a ton (601kg) of ice a year, being charged 40 cents ($9.30) per 100 pounds (45kg); 1,500 wagons were needed just to deliver ice to consumers in New York.|$|E
5|$|Scott and {{his brother}} were inseparable {{when they were younger}} and often played hockey together. While their father was often their team doctor, their mother taught them to skate. She {{enrolled}} them in figure skating to aid their skills development and taught power skating classes in Cranbrook in exchange <b>for</b> <b>ice</b> time for her sons. An offensive defenceman, Scott led his Cranbrook midget team in scoring with 55 goals and 92 points in 1988–89.|$|E
5|$|Some of the {{research}} David undertook for English Bread and Yeast Cookery was done with Jill Norman, her friend and publisher. The pair decided that they should produce two further books: Ice and Ices {{and a collection of}} David's early journalism. Like her book on bread, the scope <b>for</b> <b>Ice</b> and Ices grew the more David researched the subject. The compilation of existing essays and press articles took less time, and in 1984 An Omelette and a Glass of Wine was published, edited by Norman who became David's literary executor and edited further David works after the author's death.|$|E

The IIHF was created on May 15, 1908, under the name (in French) Ligue Internationale de Hockey sur Glace (LIHG). Belgium, France, Great Britain, Switzerland, and Bohemia (now the Czech Republic) were the founding members. The IIHF was composed entirely of European teams until 1920, when Canada and the United States joined.|$|E
5|$|The Old Crow Flats and basin {{was one of}} {{the areas}} in Canada {{untouched}} by glaciations during the Pleistocene Ice ages, thus it served as a pathway and refuge <b>for</b> <b>ice</b> age plants and animals. The area holds evidence of early human habitation in Canada dating from about 12,000. Fossils from the area include some never accounted for in North America, such as hyenas and large camels. Bluefish Caves is an archaeological site in Yukon, Canada from which a specimen of apparently human-worked mammoth bone has been radiocarbon dated to 12,000 years ago.|$|E
5|$|The arena has a {{stand on}} each of the floor area's four sides.

5|$|Women's lacrosse, a {{non-contact}} {{version of}} the sport originating in Scotland during the 1890s, is played by twelve players per side, on longer fields and with less protective equipment than the men's game requires. In the 1930s Canadian businessmen established a version called box lacrosse to create business <b>for</b> <b>ice</b> hockey arenas during the summer months. Box lacrosse is played indoors, with smaller nets, between two teams of six players, and strongly resembles the game its areas were designed for.|$|E
5|$|A {{snowflake}} is {{a single}} ice crystal that has achieved a sufficient size, and may have amalgamated with others, then falls through the Earth's atmosphere as snow. Each flake nucleates around a dust particle in supersaturated air masses by attracting supercooled cloud water droplets, which freeze and accrete in crystal form. Complex shapes emerge as the flake moves through differing temperature and humidity zones in the atmosphere, such that individual snowflakes differ in detail from one another, but may be categorized in eight broad classifications and at least 80 individual variants. The main constituent shapes <b>for</b> <b>ice</b> crystals, from which combinations may occur, are needle, column, plate and rime. Snowflakes appear white in color despite being made of clear ice. This is due to diffuse reflection of the whole spectrum of light by the small crystal facets.|$|E

5|$|Altrincham {{is one of}} the few {{towns in}} North West England with an ice rink, and has had an ice hockey team since 1961, when Altrincham Ice Rink was built in Broadheath. The Altrincham Aces (later renamed the Trafford Metros) played from 1961 until 2003, when Altrincham Ice Rink closed. The town then had a three-year period without a rink or ice hockey team, until {{construction}} of the 2,500 capacity Altrincham Ice Dome was completed. Manchester Phoenix, a club having a professional presence in the English Premier Ice Hockey League and an extensive junior development aspect, relocated to the Ice Dome during the 2006–07 season, having withdrawn from competition two years earlier due to the high cost of playing matches at Manchester's MEN Arena. In 2009 the Manchester Phoenix English National Ice Hockey League team was renamed Trafford Metros, bringing the old Altrincham team's name back into use. When not being used by Phoenix the Altrincham Ice Dome is open to the public <b>for</b> <b>ice</b> skating.|$|E
5|$|CC Amfi, {{also known}} as Nordlyshallen ("The Northern Light Hall") is an indoor sports arena in Hamar, Norway. It is mostly used <b>for</b> <b>ice</b> hockey and is the home arena of Storhamar Hockey. It has also been used for short track speed skating, figure skating, handball, events and concerts. The venue has a {{capacity}} for 7,000 spectators and was built for the 1994 Winter Olympics, where it was used for short track speed skating and figure skating. Other major events held at the arena include the 1999 IIHF World Championship in ice hockey, the 1999 World Women's Handball Championship, the 2012 IPC Ice Sledge Hockey World Championships and the scheduled 2016 Winter Youth Olympics.|$|E
5|$|Lillestrøm SK uses Lillestrøm idrettspark and LSK-Hallen for {{training}} sessions for the elite team and for lower-level matches. The Women's Premier League side LSK Kvinner FK play their home matches in LSK-Hallen. The football grounds {{are also used}} by Flisbyen BK and Focus FK in the Third Division. The athletics venue is used by Minerva IS, Lørenskog FIL and Strømmen IF. During the 1952 Winter Olympics, the stadium was one of five rinks used <b>for</b> <b>ice</b> hockey. Three rinks were located outside Oslo in order to spread the games to a wider audience. The single match at Lillestrøm stadion saw Poland beat Finland 4–2 on 23 February. The former velodrome hosted two Norwegian championships. The athletics venue annually hosts Romerikslekene {{and one of the}} three Huyndai Grand Prix events.

5|$|Plant {{technology}} {{began to}} be turned {{to the problem of}} directly chilling rooms and containers, to replace the need to carry ice at all. Pressure began to grow for a replacement <b>for</b> <b>ice</b> bunkers on the trans-Atlantic routes during the 1870s. Tellier produced a chilled storeroom for the steamship Le Frigorifique, using it to ship beef from Argentina to France, while the Glasgow-based firm of Bells helped to sponsor a new, compressed-air chiller for ships using the Gorrie approach, called the Bell-Coleman design. These technologies soon became used on the trade to Australia, New Zealand and Argentina. The same approach {{began to be}} taken in other industries. Carl von Linde found ways of applying mechanical refrigeration to the brewing industry, removing its reliance on natural ice; cold warehouses and meat packers began to rely on chilling plants.|$|E
5|$|Purely natural {{sources were}} {{insufficient}} {{in some areas}} and additional steps taken to increase supplies. In New England, holes were drilled in the ice to promote the thickening of the surface. Alternatively, artificial lakes were created in some areas, and guidance was published {{on how best to}} construct the dams that lay at the heart of these designs. Low-lying, boggy land was dammed and flooded in Maine {{towards the end of the}} century to meet surge demands, while pre-existing artificial mill ponds in Wisconsin turned out to be ideal for harvesting commercial ice. In Alaska, a large, shallow artificial lake covering around 40 acres (16 hectares) was produced in order to assist in ice production and harvesting; similar approaches were taken in the Aleutian islands; in Norway this was taken further, with a number of artificial lakes up to half a mile long built on farmland to increase supplies, including some built out into the sea to collect fresh water <b>for</b> <b>ice.</b>|$|E
