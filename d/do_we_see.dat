25|$|Berossus' {{achievement}} {{may be seen}} {{in terms}} of how he combined the Hellenistic methods of historiography and Mesopotamian accounts to form a unique composite. Like Herodotus and Thucydides, he probably autographed his work for the benefit of later writers. Certainly he furnished details of his own life within his histories, which contrasted with the Mesopotamian tradition of anonymous scribes. Elsewhere, he included a geographical description of Babylonia, similar to that found in Herodotus (on Egypt), and used Greek classifications. There is some evidence that he resisted adding information to his research, especially for the earlier periods with which he was not familiar. Only in Book 3 <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> his opinions begin to enter the picture.|$|E

[...] In the first scene, the First Day of Creation, God creates light and separates light from darkness.

On the Fourth Day, God puts the Sun and the Moon in place to govern the night and the day, the time and the seasons of the year.

2500|$|The second {{form of the}} {{question}} is [...] "Why <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> no signs of intelligence elsewhere in the universe?" [...] This version does not assume interstellar travel, but includes other galaxies as well. [...] For distant galaxies, travel times may well explain the lack of alien visits to Earth, but a sufficiently advanced civilization could potentially be observable over a significant fraction {{of the size of}} the observable universe. Even if such civilizations are rare, the scale argument indicates they should exist somewhere at some point during the history of the universe, and since they could be detected from far away over a considerable period of time, many more potential sites for their origin are within range of our observation.
