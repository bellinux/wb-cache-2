[...] Sturgis was cremated and his ashes were buried in Compton Cemetery, near his country house in Surrey. [...] Henry James wrote to Sturgis's widow of her husband's [...] "beautiful, noble, {{stainless}} memory, without the shadow upon him, or {{the shadow of a}} shadow, of a single grossness or meanness or ugliness – the world's dust on the nature of thousands of men. Everything that was high and charming in him comes out as one holds on to him, and when <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> friendship of so many years with him I see it all as fairness and felicity." ...|$|E
2500|$|During a 1971 {{conference at}} Columbia University, a {{creative}} writing student asked Borges what he regarded as [...] "a writer's duty to his time". Borges replied, [...] "I think a writer's {{duty is to}} be a writer, and if he can be a good writer, he is doing his duty. Besides, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> own opinions as being superficial. For example, I am a Conservative, I hate the Communists, I hate the Nazis, I hate the anti-Semites, and so on; but I don't allow these opinions to find their way into my writings—except, of course, when I was greatly elated about the Six Days' War. Generally speaking, I think of keeping them in watertight compartments. Everybody knows my opinions, but as for my dreams and my stories, they should be allowed their full freedom, I think. I don't want to intrude into them, I'm writing fiction, not fables." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hopkins {{was born}} on New Year's Eve 1937, in Margam, a suburb of Port Talbot, Glamorgan. His parents were Annie Muriel (née Yeates) and Richard Arthur Hopkins, a baker. He stated his father’s working class values have always underscored his life. “Whenever I get a feeling that I may be special or different, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> father and I {{remember}} his hands – his hardened, broken hands". His school days were unproductive; he would rather immerse himself in art, such as painting and drawing, or playing the piano, than attend to his studies. In 1949, to instill discipline, his parents insisted he attend Jones' West Monmouth Boys' School in Pontypool. He remained there for five terms and was then educated at Cowbridge Grammar School in the Vale of Glamorgan. In a 2002 interview he stated: [...] "I was a poor learner, which left me open to ridicule and gave me an inferiority complex. I grew up absolutely convinced I was stupid." [...] In desperation, his parents sent him off to boarding school, where the headmaster {{told him he was}} [...] "hopeless" [...] and he developed a [...] "sheer contempt for authority." [...] He stumbled into acting at 17 with a YMCA group (his one line: [...] "").|$|E

2500|$|Brando {{acknowledged}} {{his professional}} decline, writing later, [...] "Some {{of the films}} I made during the sixties were successful; some weren't. Some, like The Night of the Following Day, I made only for the money; others, like Candy, I did because a friend asked me to and I didn't want to turn him down... In some ways <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> middle age as the Fuck You Years." [...] Candy was especially appalling for many; a 1968 sex farce film directed by Christian Marquand {{and based on the}} 1958 novel by Terry Southern, the movie satirizes pornographic stories through the adventures of its naive heroine, Candy, played by Ewa Aulin. It is generally regarded as the nadir of Brando's career. The Washington Post observed: [...] "Brando's self-indulgence over a dozen years is costing him and his public his talents." [...] In the March 1966 issue of The Atlantic, Pauline Kael wrote that in his rebellious days, Brando [...] "was antisocial because he knew society was crap; he was a hero to youth because he was strong enough not to take the crap", but now Brando and others like him had become [...] "buffoons, shamelessly, pathetically mocking their public reputations." [...] In an earlier review of The Appaloosa in 1966, Kael wrote that the actor was [...] "trapped in another dog of a movie... Not for the first time, Mr. Brando gives us a heavy-lidded, adenoidally openmouthed caricature of the inarticulate, stalwart loner." [...] Although he feigned indifference, Brando was hurt by the critical mauling, admitting in the 2015 film Listen to Me Marlon, [...] "They can hit you every day and you have no way of fighting back. I was very convincing in my pose of indifference, but I was very sensitive and it hurt a lot." ...|$|E

60|$|There {{is little}} doubt, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> reading at Cheltenham somewhere about November.

5000|$|Grant later said: [...] "A lot of Anderson counts among what <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> as <b>my</b> best work. The {{fact that}} I've {{had one of}} the best storytellers in the business, Arthur Ranson, along for most of the ride makes it even more memorable for me." ...|$|R

'There are few, <b>I</b> should <b>think,</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> readers, {{who will}} not agree with me in pronouncing, that, if {{the author of the}} {{following}} letter had not right on his side, he had at least most of those good feelings which are found in general to accompany it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{interrupted}} me sternly. [...] "I {{would not}} {{cross the street}} to see her," [...] he said. [...] "A woman who deserts her child is a monster. Forgive me for speaking so, miss!

6000|$|... "If it is {{good enough}} for him, {{it is good}} enough for me, I suppose," [...] said Tom.

6000|$|... "Oh, dear!" [...] she sighed, rising, [...] "I don't see how it's {{going to}} end; it must end some time.

6000|$|... 'My dear Dr. Moberly,--Thank you heartily {{for writing}} to me.
