5|$|Hilde {{appears as}} a slender woman with long, red hair. Her primary {{appearance}} encases her fully in form-fitting body armor, with red and black fabric underneath. A wolf's head, the character's family symbol, extends from the right pauldron and covers her helmet's visor, while the left pauldron is covered by red fabric, fastened {{to the center of}} her breastplate's collar underneath a large brooch. Beneath the armor, a red coat covers <b>her</b> <b>torso,</b> the tail of which extends past her waist. Her alternate character design consists of a long, blue dress, extending to her feet and neck, exposing her shoulders and angled towards her right leg. White gloves, shoes, and stockings cover her arms and legs, while a darker colored sash surrounds her waist and midsection, also angled to the right.|$|E
5|$|Parvati has a well-developed, round bosom and {{a narrow}} {{feminine}} waist embellished with various haras (religious bracelets) and other ornaments, made of diamonds and other gems. She has a fuller thigh and a curvier body and hip than the male {{part of the}} icon. The torso, hip and pelvis of the female is exaggerated to emphasize the anatomical differences between the halves. Though the male private parts may be depicted, the female genitalia are never depicted and the loins are always draped. She wears a multi-coloured or white silken garment down to her ankle and one or three girdles around her waist. The left half wears an anklet and her foot is painted red with henna. The left leg may be somewhat bent or straight, resting on a lotus pedestal. In contrast to the Shiva half, the Parvati half – smeared with saffron – is described as calm and gentle, parrot-green or dark in colour. She may be draped in a sari covering <b>her</b> <b>torso</b> and legs.|$|E
5|$|As {{a medical}} garment, metal corsets endured {{well into the}} 20th century. The Mexican painter Frida Kahlo was a notable wearer of such medical corsets, {{following}} ongoing problems {{as a result of}} a serious road crash she experienced as a teenager. By 1944, Kahlo's doctors had recommended that she wear a steel corset instead of the plaster ones she had mainly worn since the accident; and Kahlo, whose paintings were heavily autobiographical, used the new corset as the basis for one of her best known self-portraits, The Broken Column. In the painting, Kahlo portrays herself weeping with agony, <b>her</b> <b>torso</b> split open revealing that her spine is a crumbling Ionic column, and her damaged body held together by the steel corset. A form of metal corset or orthopaedic brace used in the second half of the 20th century is called a Harris brace after its inventor, R.I. Harris. Harris braces are designed to immobilise the waist whilst healing, and are made with two bendable metal bands worn above and below the waist, and connected with rigid metal supports.|$|E

5000|$|October 11, 2011 - Shelley Hilliard, a black {{transgender}} teen who {{had been}} reported missing, had <b>her</b> burnt <b>torso</b> identified by police in Detroit. Her killer, 30-year-old Qasim Raqib, was sentenced on March 6, 2012 to 25-40 years in jail.|$|R
25|$|The novelist Raymond Chandler {{commented that}} it seemed {{unbelievable}} that Crippen would successfully dispose of his wife's limbs and head and then, rather stupidly, bury <b>her</b> <b>torso</b> under the cellar floor of his home.|$|E
25|$|If {{the straps}} {{dig into the}} {{shoulder}}, leaving red marks or causing shoulder or neck pain, the bra band is not offering enough support. If breast tissue overflows {{the bottom of the}} bra, under the armpit, or over the top edge of the bra cup, the cup size is too small. Loose fabric in the bra cup indicates the cup size is too big. If the underwires poke the breast under the armpit or if the bra's center panel does not lie flat against the sternum, the cup size is too small. If the band rides up the torso at the back, the band size is too big. If it digs into the flesh, causing the flesh to spill over the edges of the band, the band is too small. If the band feels tight, {{this may be due to}} the cups being too small; instead of going up in band size a person should try going up in cup size. Similarly a band might feel too loose if the cup is too big. It is possible to test whether a bra band is too tight or too loose by reversing the bra on <b>her</b> <b>torso</b> so that the cups are at the back and then check for fit and comfort. Generally, if the wearer must continually adjust the bra or experiences general discomfort, the bra is a poor fit and she should get a new fitting.|$|E
25|$|Four {{days after}} the {{discovery}} of Mixer's body, on March 25, a surveyor discovered the nude, mutilated body of a teenage girl behind a vacant house on a remote, rural section of Earhart Road, {{just a few hundred}} yards from where the body of Joan Schell had been discovered eight months previous. Investigators called to the crime scene noted a dramatic increase in the savagery exhibited against the victim, with one investigator describing the injuries inflicted upon the victim as being the worst he had seen in 30 years of police work. A subsequent autopsy revealed the victim had died of numerous fractures covering one-third of her skull and one side of her face, all of which had been inflicted with a heavy blunt instrument. These injuries had been inflicted after the victim had been extensively beaten and tortured: her killer had placed a section of her own shirt into her trachea to muffle her screams as she received extensive blunt force trauma to the face, head and body, including several deep lacerations believed to have been inflicted with a leather strap. Welt marks upon the chest and shoulders indicated the killer had also used restraints to hold the victim prone as he whipped <b>her</b> <b>torso</b> and upper legs with a leather belt before tearing a branch from a nearby tree and inserting this instrument eight inches into her vagina. Blood spatterings and churned soil close to the crime scene indicated she had been beaten close to where her body was discovered, and that she may have attempted to escape her attacker.|$|E

500|$|The {{team did}} not want the android Azel to be a typical {{energetic}} anime-style heroine, and instead tried to make her simultaneously appealing and frightening. Her character underwent the most revisions, emphasizing her human and non-human aspects, and one early design had a hole in <b>her</b> <b>torso.</b> Art director Manabu Kusunoki picked Katsumi Yokota to design the characters; according to Futatsugi, Yokota is [...] "a very, very good artist. The fragility of the character Azel exists because of Yokota-san." ...|$|E

500|$|At 1:45am Catherine Eddowes' {{mutilated}} {{body was}} found by PC Edward Watkins at the south-west corner of Mitre Square, in the City of London, about 12 minutes walk from Berner Street. She had been killed less than 10 minutes earlier by a slash to the throat {{from left to right}} with a sharp, pointed knife at least 6inches (15cm) long. Her face and abdomen were mutilated, and her intestines were drawn out over the right shoulder with a detached length between <b>her</b> <b>torso</b> and left arm. Her left kidney and most of her uterus were removed. The Eddowes inquest was opened on 4 October by Samuel F. Langham, coroner for the City of London. The examining pathologist, Dr Frederick Gordon Brown, believed the perpetrator [...] "had considerable knowledge of the position of the organs" [...] and from the position of the wounds on the body he could tell that the murderer had knelt {{to the right of the}} body, and worked alone. However, the first doctor at the scene, local surgeon Dr George William Sequeira, disputed that the killer possessed anatomical skill or sought particular organs. His view was shared by City medical officer William Sedgwick Saunders, who was also present at the autopsy. Because of this murder's location, the City of London Police under Detective Inspector James McWilliam were brought into the enquiry.|$|E

500|$|Ivy {{appears as}} a tall, large busted woman with short, white hair. A bluish-purple leotard covers <b>her</b> <b>torso</b> and arms, with patches of the fabric removed to expose her cleavage, {{buttocks}} and various parts of her abdomen. Similar leggings cover her legs midway below her thighs, connected to the leotard by garters at golden metal bands at their peak. A sleeve of the same material covers her right arm and hand, while armor covers her left arm, hand, and shoulder. A smaller pauldron covers her right shoulder, while high heels cover her feet, and a white glove covers her right hand. The left shoulder pauldron incorporates the Tudor Rose, a traditional heraldic symbol of England, while the plates of the armor were designed to resemble the links of her sword. A mask covering {{the right side of}} her face and eye were also considered but abandoned after the initial character concept. While her design has been altered slightly as the series has progressed, the concept has remained consistent throughout the series, {{with the exception of the}} removal of the glove in later designs. Ivy stands [...] tall, making her the series' tallest female character, and with a bust measurement of 100cm (39in) also the bustiest, though this was an aspect that the developers felt they had overdone by her appearance in Soulcalibur IV.|$|E
2500|$|During World War II, Allied aircrews {{called their}} yellow inflatable, vest-like life {{preserver}} jackets [...] "Mae Wests" [...] partly from rhyming slang for [...] "breasts" [...] and [...] "life vest" [...] {{and partly because}} of the resemblance to <b>her</b> <b>torso.</b> A [...] "Mae West" [...] is also a type of round parachute malfunction (partial inversion) which contorts the shape of the canopy into the appearance of an extraordinarily large brassiere.|$|E

2500|$|At 1 p.m. MST, Arndt asked Fleet White (a {{friend of}} the Ramseys) and John Ramsey to search the house {{to see if they}} could find if [...] "anything seemed amiss." [...] John and Fleet started their search in the basement, where John found his daughter's body in one of the rooms. Duct tape covered JonBenét's mouth, a nylon cord was found around her wrists and neck, and <b>her</b> <b>torso</b> was covered by a white blanket. Ramsey {{immediately}} picked the body up and took it upstairs. Arndt then moved her into the living room. Each time that she was moved potential evidence was contaminated or disturbed for the returning forensics team. Patsy stated that JonBenét was not wearing the clothing that she was wearing when she put her daughter to bed, as she was now dressed in white leggings and a shirt.|$|E
2500|$|At RISD, Woodman {{borrowed}} {{a video camera}} and VTR and created videotapes related to her photographs in which she [...] "methodically whitewashes her own naked body, for instance, or compares <b>her</b> <b>torso</b> to images of classical statuary."

2500|$|The {{woman can}} lie {{on her back}} with her hips {{on the edge of}} a {{platform}} such as a bed, table, kitchen bench, desk, etc. while the man penetrates her while standing. The woman can move her body freely. She can dangle her legs over the edge or raise them to any height or manner mentioned above. The woman can rest her legs on the man or he can hold them or separate them. The woman has a greater ability to move her pelvis and to arch her back, and the man can raise, support or [...] restrict the movement of her pelvis. The woman is not weighed down by the man's weight. This position, sometimes called the butterfly position, adds variety to the angle and depth of penetration and generally enables the man to withdraw and then fully thrust the penis, with faster and more forceful thrusts. The downside of this position is that the angle of penetration results in reduced clitoral stimulation, and the woman may need direct clitoral fingering, either by herself or by the man, to achieve orgasm. Alternatively, the woman may either arch her back or raise <b>her</b> <b>torso</b> onto her elbows or arms to reduce the angle and enhance clitoral stimulation. Also, prior to and after the man's orgasm, the man may need to lie down on the woman.|$|E

50|$|Mariën’s early {{attempts}} at expressing his ideas in photography were unsuccessful.

2500|$|Police {{questioned}} the Degnan family's neighbors, but few had seen anything unusual. Someone later telephoned police anonymously, suggesting that police {{look in the}} sewers near the Degnan home. Police did, and discovered the young girl's head in a storm-drain sewer that was in an alley {{a block from the}} Degnan residence. In the same alley, they discovered the girl's right leg in a catch basin, <b>her</b> <b>torso</b> in another storm drain and her left leg in a drain in another alley, each location progressively further from her home. Her arms were found a month later in a sewer {{on the other side of}} the Howard elevated train line more than three blocks from the Degnan residence. All the drains were capped with circular cast-iron manhole covers, yet no one had heard them being lifted or replaced. Searches of an apartment building near where her head was found uncovered a basement laundry room with four tubs that contained evidence indicating she had been dismembered there. The killer had mopped the floor, but blood was found in the drains of all four tubs. The press called it the [...] "Murder Room" [...] although the autopsy showed that she had been alive when taken from her home, murdered at a second location that was never identified, and then taken to the laundry room.|$|E
60|$|Lingard, looking idly after her, {{heard the}} rattle of loose planks that led from the ground {{to the door of}} the house. He moved his head beyond the shelter of the tree and saw Aissa coming down the {{inclined}} way into the courtyard. After making a few hurried paces towards the tree, she stopped with one foot advanced in an appearance of sudden terror, and her eyes glanced wildly right and left. Her head was uncovered. A blue cloth wrapped her from her head to foot in close slanting folds, with one end thrown over her shoulder. A tress of her black hair strayed across her bosom. Her bare arms pressed down close to her body, with hands open and outstretched fingers; her slightly elevated shoulders and the backward inclination of <b>her</b> <b>torso</b> gave her the aspect of one defiant yet shrinking from a coming blow. She had closed the door of the house behind her; and as she stood solitary in the unnatural and threatening twilight of the murky day, with everything unchanged around her, she appeared to Lingard as if she had been made there, on the spot, out of the black vapours of the sky and of the sinister gleams of feeble sunshine that struggled, through the thickening clouds, into the colourless desolation of the world.|$|E
