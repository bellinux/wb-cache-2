Meanwhile, the Normans of Aversa pacified the valley of the Sangro. After Pandulf fled to Constantinople, Guaimar turned his attention to Amalfi. In April 1039, in support of the deposed and blinded Manso II, Guaimar forced the abdication and exile of John II and his mother, Maria, a sister of Pandulf. Guaimar installed himself as duke. Then in July, he conquered Sorrento, which had been conquered by Pandulf in 1034. He gave it to his brother <b>Guy</b> <b>with</b> the title of duke.

25|$|Baldwin V's rule, with Raymond of Tripoli as regent and his great-uncle Joscelin of Edessa as his guardian, was short. He was {{a sickly}} child {{and died in}} the summer of 1186. Raymond and his {{supporters}} went to Nablus, presumably in an attempt to prevent Sibylla from claiming the throne, but Sibylla and her supporters went to Jerusalem, where it was decided that the kingdom should pass to her, on the condition that her marriage to Guy be annulled. She agreed but only if she could choose her own husband and king, and after being crowned, she immediately crowned <b>Guy</b> <b>with</b> her own hands. Raymond had refused to attend the coronation, and in Nablus he suggested that Isabella and Humphrey should be crowned instead, but Humphrey refused to agree to this plan which would have certainly started a civil war. Humphrey went to Jerusalem and swore allegiance to Guy and Sibylla, as did most of Raymond's other supporters. Raymond himself refused to do so and left for Tripoli; Baldwin of Ibelin also refused, gave up his fiefs, and left for Antioch.|$|E
25|$|Navajo scouts {{accompanied}} the United States Army when it investigated many civilian-Navajo confrontations. For example, between June 14 and September 28, 1883 {{there were five}} different Navajo reservation related activities. Lieutenant Parker, with ten enlisted men and two scouts, {{went up to the}} San Juan River to separate Navajos and citizens who encroached on Navajo land. Lieutenant <b>Guy,</b> <b>with</b> seventeen enlisted men and two scouts, and Captain Smith, with 56 enlisted men and five scouts helped the local Indian agent deal with unhappy Navajo chiefs. This involved Manuelito, Torlino, Grando Muncho and fifty armed Navajos who were upset by raids of citizens and other tribes on their people and livestock. In another action: Lieutenant Lockett, with forty-two enlisted men, were joined by Lieutenant Holomon at Navajo Springs. Evidently a citizen named Houck and or Owens had murdered a Navajo chief's son and 100 armed Navajos were looking for them. It is evident from these four months of military reports from the field that the officers tended to trust the Navajo version of events.|$|E

He's sitting on this landing {{at the top of}} the staircase and the camera pulls back and he's this tiny little figure.

He's {{what you call a}} complete player – tremendous defender, but more so in the 3-hole, he can do so many things for you. He's so dangerous." [...] Kemp, with a single and a walk, became the first Dodger to reach base twice in an All-Star Game since Mike Piazza in 1996.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the release}} of Eraserhead, Lynch {{attempted}} to find funding for his next project, Ronnie Rocket, a film [...] "about electricity and a three-foot <b>guy</b> <b>with</b> red hair". Lynch met film producer Stuart Cornfeld during this time. Cornfeld had enjoyed Eraserhead and was interested in producing Ronnie Rocket; he worked for Mel Brooks and Brooksfilms at the time, and when the two realized that Ronnie Rocket was unlikely to find sufficient financing, Lynch asked to see some already-written scripts to consider for his next project. Cornfeld found four scripts that he felt would interest Lynch; on hearing the title of The Elephant Man, the director decided to make it his second film.|$|E

[...] Paul Chaplin, another writer with the series, said of the actor's acromegaly: [...] "That fact opens up a large, irresolvable issue concerning the movie industry's use of this poor afflicted fellow; he was paid, after all, and movie work is nice work.

In the sole performance that Lewis missed, a festival in Spain, friend Joan Hiller sang and Chris Walla played her guitar and keyboard parts. Death Cab for Cutie bassist Nick Harmer was in charge of the tour's visuals. Tamborello later said in an interview that Gibbard had been nervous about touring, as the audience may have been bored by what they saw as [...] "a <b>guy</b> <b>with</b> a computer onstage".
