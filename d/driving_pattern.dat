40|$|Hybrid {{electric}} vehicles (HEVs) {{are considered to}} be one of the energy-efficient technologies for near-term sustainability of the transportation sector. Over the years, research has focused on improving fuel economy (FE) for a given drive cycle, but FE variability over a realistic range of real-world <b>driving</b> <b>patterns</b> has been generally overlooked, and this can lead to FE benefits not being fully realized in real-world usage. No systematic methodology exists to reduce FE variability by design optimization of powertrain components. This study proposes a methodology of powertrain component optimization to reduce the FE variability due to variations in <b>driving</b> <b>patterns.</b> In the proposed methodology, powertrain components are optimum over a range of <b>driving</b> <b>patterns</b> of different traffic conditions and driving styles simultaneously. The proposed methodology demonstrates the potential to reduce FE variability by up to 34 % over six <b>driving</b> <b>patterns</b> of different traffic conditions and driving styles...|$|R
40|$|Analysis and {{recognition}} of driving styles are profoundly important to intelligent transportation and vehicle calibration. This paper presents a novel driving style analysis framework using the primitive <b>driving</b> <b>patterns</b> learned from naturalistic driving data. In order to achieve this, first, a Bayesian nonparametric learning method based on a hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM) is introduced to extract primitive <b>driving</b> <b>patterns</b> from time series driving data without prior knowledge {{of the number of}} these patterns. In the Bayesian nonparametric approach, we utilize a hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP) instead of learning the unknown number of smooth dynamical modes of HSMM, thus generating the primitive <b>driving</b> <b>patterns.</b> Each primitive pattern is clustered and then labeled using behavioral semantics according to drivers' physical and psychological perception thresholds. For each driver, 75 primitive <b>driving</b> <b>patterns</b> in car-following scenarios are learned and semantically labeled. In order to show the HDP-HSMM's utility to learn primitive <b>driving</b> <b>patterns,</b> other two Bayesian nonparametric approaches, HDP-HMM and sticky HDP-HMM, are compared. The naturalistic driving data of 18 drivers were collected from the University of Michigan Safety Pilot Model Deployment (SPDM) database. The individual driving styles are discussed according to distribution characteristics of the learned primitive <b>driving</b> <b>patterns</b> and also the difference in driving styles among drivers are evaluated using the Kullback-Leibler divergence. The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed primitive pattern-based method can allow one to semantically understand driver behaviors and driving styles...|$|R
40|$|Driving {{patterns}} {{influence and}} {{are influenced by}} land use patterns and other transport features. Traffic research, particularly driving cycle development has mainly focused on the pure engineering aspects of <b>driving</b> <b>patterns</b> {{to the neglect of}} this broader perspective. Consequently the interpretation of results and policy development on urban energy conservation and emissions abatement arising from driving cycle research have been seriously questioned. This study shows how it is possible to closely link instrumented vehicle research {{to an understanding of the}} wider urban system, i. e. the ecology of urban driving. To do this a methodology of sampling <b>driving</b> <b>patterns</b> in an urban area is developed and applied to Perth, Western Australia. This defines homogeneous areas within the city in terms of their activity intensity, modal split and social/economic status. The six areas developed provide not only a framework for sampling <b>driving</b> <b>patterns</b> but a way of demonstrating the urban ecological basis of <b>driving</b> <b>patterns.</b> ...|$|R

A methodology is presented to characterise real-world <b>driving</b> <b>patterns</b> numerically. On the basis of this methodology an overview is given of characteristic driving behaviour of various categories or road vehicles (trucks, passenger cars and motorcycles) in different regions of the world. Where relevant, these examples are compared with the different traffic conditions in those regions.

40|$|In {{the past}} decade, {{it has been}} {{demonstrated}} that Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) can significantly reduce petroleum consumptions. However, the extend to which these vehicles can reduce the petroleum consumption highly depends on components size and <b>driving</b> <b>patterns.</b> In other words, PHEVs show the best benefits if the components are dimensioned to match the driver’s driving behavior. In this paper, the effect of different <b>driving</b> <b>patterns</b> on the optimal sizing of three major components of series PHEVs, i. e., battery, electric motor, and engine generator unit is studied. Different driving cycles are generated stochastically from real driving data using Markov chains, to represent life-time <b>driving</b> <b>patterns</b> of different drivers. To find the optimal size of the components, the problem is formulated as a convex optimization problem. The optimization variables (the variables of component size and energy management) are obtained by minimizing a cost function which {{is the sum of}} the operational and component costs...|$|R

Although charging at these stations is still relatively time consuming compared to refueling, in practice it often meshes well with a normal <b>driving</b> <b>pattern,</b> where driving is usually done {{for a few hours}} before stopping and resting and drinking or eating; this gives the car a chance to be charged.|$|E

This paper describes a system that integrates ubiquitous mobile sensors available on devices such as smartphones, intelligent wristbands and smartwatches, in order to determine and classify <b>driving</b> <b>patterns</b> and to assess driving e ficiency and driver's moods. It first identi fies the main attributes for contextual information, with relevance to driving analysis. Next, it describes how to obtain that information from ubiquitous mobile sensors, usually carried by drivers. Finally, it addresses the multimodal assessment process which produces the analysis of <b>driving</b> <b>patterns</b> and the classi cation of driving moods, promoting the identifi cation of either regular or aggressive <b>driving</b> <b>patterns,</b> and the classi fication of mood types between aggressive and relaxed. Such an approach enables ubiquitous sensing of personal <b>driving</b> <b>patterns</b> across diff erent vehicles, which can be used in sustainability frameworks, driving alerts and recommendation systems.

40|$|With a {{potential}} {{to facilitate the}} integration of renewable energy into the electricity system, electric drive vehicles may offer a considerable flexibility by allowing for charging and discharging when desired. This paper takes the perspective of an aggregator that manages the electricity market participation of a vehicle fleet and presents a framework for optimizing charging and discharging of the electric drive vehicles, given the <b>driving</b> <b>patterns</b> of the fleet and the variations in market prices of electricity. When the aggregator is a price-taker the optimization can be {{stated in terms of}} linear programming whereas a quadratic programming formulation is required when he/she has market power. A Danish case study illustrates the construction of representative <b>driving</b> <b>patterns</b> through clustering of survey data from Western Denmark and the prediction of electricity price variations through regression on prices from the Nordic market.

40|$|Driving {{patterns}} (i. e., speed, {{acceleration and}} choice of gears) influence exhaust emissions and fuel consumption. The aim {{here is to}} obtain {{a better understanding of}} the variables that affect <b>driving</b> <b>patterns,</b> by determining the extent they are influenced by street characteristics and/or driver-car categories. A data set of over 14, 000 <b>driving</b> <b>patterns</b> registered in actual traffic is used. The relationship between <b>driving</b> <b>patterns</b> and recorded variables is analysed. The most complete effect is found for the variables describing the street environment: occurrence and density of junctions controlled by traffic lights, speed limit, street function and type of neighbourhood. A fairly large effect is found for car performance, expressed in terms of the power-to-mass ratio. For elderly drivers, the average speed systematically decreases for all street types and stop time systematically increases on arterials. The results have implications for the assessment of environmental effects through appropriate street categorisation in emission models, as well as the possible reduction of environmental effects through better traffic planning and management, driver education and car design...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} driving reduction in a diverse sample of 229 {{male and female}} older drivers aged 70 years and above in Queensland, Australia. The study sought to determine whether differences existed {{between male and female}} older drivers in regard to <b>driving</b> <b>patterns,</b> and to identify factors that were predictive of driving reduction in female versus male older drivers. Participants provided information on their health, self-reported <b>driving</b> <b>patterns,</b> <b>driving</b> perceptions, alternative transport options, and feedback. Overall, females were more likely to avoid challenging situations but less likely to reduce their driving when compared to males. Self-rated health and driving confidence were significant predictors for driving reduction among females. For males, driving importance was the only significant predictor for driving reduction in this sample. This study indicates the need for longitudinal research on the process of driving reduction and whether the planning process for driving cessation differ between females and males. ...|$|R
