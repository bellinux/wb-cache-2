40|$|Continuing {{on recent}} {{computational}} and experimental work on jammed <b>packings</b> <b>of</b> hard ellipsoids [Donev et al., Science, vol. 303, 990 - 993] we consider jamming <b>in</b> <b>packings</b> <b>of</b> smooth strictly convex nonspherical hard particles. We {{explain why the}} isocounting conjecture, which states that for large disordered jammed packings the average contact number per particle is {{twice the number of}} degrees of freedom per particle (Z̅= 2 d_f), does not apply to nonspherical particles. We develop first- and second-order conditions for jamming, and demonstrate that <b>packings</b> <b>of</b> nonspherical particles can be jammed even though they are hypoconstrained (Z̅< 2 d_f). We apply an algorithm using these conditions to computer-generated hypoconstrained ellipsoid and ellipse packings and demonstrate that our algorithm does produce jammed packings, even close to the sphere point. We also consider packings that are nearly jammed and draw connections to <b>packings</b> <b>of</b> deformable (but stiff) particles.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{evolution}} of structural disorder under cooling in supercooled liquids, focusing on covalent networks. We introduce {{a model for the}} energy of networks that incorporates weak non-covalent interactions. We show that at low-temperature, these interactions considerably affect the network topology near the rigidity transition that occurs as the coordination increases. As a result, this transition becomes mean-field and does not present a line of critical points previously argued for, the "rigidity window". Vibrational modes are then not fractons, but instead are similar to the anomalous modes observed <b>in</b> <b>packings</b> <b>of</b> particles near jamming.

40|$|We {{address the}} problem of {{predicting}} saturation-dependent electrical conductivity σ <b>in</b> <b>packings</b> <b>of</b> spheres during drainage and imbibition.

40|$|Amorphous solids tend {{to present}} an {{abundance}} of soft elastic modes, which diminish their transport properties, generate heterogeneities in their elastic response, and affect non-linear processes like thermal activation of plasticity. This is especially true <b>in</b> <b>packings</b> <b>of</b> particles near their jamming transition, for which effective medium theory and variational arguments can both predict the density of vibrational modes. However, recent numerics support that one hypothesis of the variational argument does not hold. We provide a novel variational argument which overcomes this problem, and correctly predicts the scaling properties of soft modes near the jamming transition. Soft modes are shown {{to be related to}} the response to a local strain in more connected networks, and to be characterized by a volume 1 /δ z, where δ z is the excess coordination above the Maxwell threshold.

40|$|There are {{two main}} classes of physics-based models for {{two-dimensional}} cellular materials: <b>packings</b> <b>of</b> repulsive disks and the vertex model. These models have several disadvantages. For example, disk interactions are typically a function of particle overlap, yet the model assumes that the disks remain circular during overlap. The shapes of the cells can vary in the vertex model, however, the packing fraction is fixed at ϕ= 1. Here, we describe the deformable particle model (DPM), where each particle is a polygon composed {{of a large number}} of vertices. The total energy includes three terms: two quadratic terms to penalize deviations from the preferred particle area a_ 0 and perimeter p_ 0 and a repulsive interaction between DPM polygons that penalizes overlaps. We performed simulations to study the onset <b>of</b> jamming <b>in</b> <b>packings</b> <b>of</b> DPM polygons as a function of asphericity, A = p_ 0 ^ 2 / 4 π a_ 0. We show that the packing fraction at jamming onset ϕ_J(A) grows with increasing A, reaching confluence at A≈ 1. 16. A^* corresponds to the value at which DPM polygons completely fill the cells obtained from a surface-Voronoi tessellation. Further, we show that DPM polygons develop invaginations for A > A^* with excess perimeter that grows linearly with A- A^*.

First, we experimentally characterize the deposits’ morphology {{in terms of}} the particles’ aspect ratio and feeding rate. Then we use the experimental results to validate our discrete element method (DEM) based on spheropolygons. After achieving excellent agreement, we use contact forces and fabric provided by the simulations to calculate the coarse-grained stress tensor. For low feeding rates, square particles display a strong tendency to align downwards, i. e., with a diagonal parallel to gravity. This morphology leads to stress transmission towards the walls, implying a quick development of pressure saturation, in agreement with the Janssen effect. When the feed rate is increased, both the disorder and the number of horizontal squares in the silo increase, hindering the Janssen effect. Conversely, for elongated particles the feed rate has a weak effect on the final deposit properties.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the jamming transition <b>in</b> <b>packings</b> <b>of</b> emulsions and granular materials via molecular dynamics simulations. The emulsion model {{is composed of}} frictionless droplets interacting via nonlinear normal forces obtained using experimental data acquired by confocal microscopy of compressed emulsions systems. Granular materials are modeled by Hertz-Mindlin deformable spherical grains with Coulomb friction. In both cases, we find power-law scaling for the vanishing of pressure and excess number of contacts as the system approaches the jamming transition from high volume fractions. We find that the construction history parametrized by the compression rate during the preparation protocol has a strong effect on the micromechanical properties of granular materials but not on emulsions. This leads the granular system to jam at different volume fractions depending on the histories. Isostaticity is found <b>in</b> the <b>packings</b> close to the jamming transition in emulsions and in granular materials at slow compression rates and infinite friction. Heterogeneity of interparticle forces increases as the packings approach the jamming transition which is demonstrated by the exponential tail in force distributions and the small values of the participation number measuring spatial localization of the forces. However, no signatures of the jamming transition are observed in structural properties, like the radial distribution functions and the distributions of contacts. Comment: Submitted to PR...|$|R

As a result, the force distributions become increasingly broader as particles become more elongated. Interestingly, the weak force network transforms from a passive stabilizing agent with respect to strong force chains to an active force-transmitting network for the whole system.

40|$|We present {{experimental}} and numerical results for displacement response functions <b>in</b> <b>packings</b> <b>of</b> rigid frictional disks under gravity. The central disk {{on the bottom}} layer is shifted upwards by a small amount, and the motions of disks above it define the displacement response. Disk motions are measured {{with the help of}} a still digital camera. The responses so measured provide information on the force-force response, that is, the excess force at the bottom produced by a small overload in the bulk. We find that, in experiments, the vertical-force response shows a Gaussian-like shape, broadening roughly as the square root of distance, as predicted by diffusive theories for stress propagation in granulates. However, the diffusion coefficient obtained from a fit of the response width is ten times larger than predicted by such theories. Moreover we notice that our data is compatible with a crossover to linear broadening at large scales. In numerical simulations on similar systems (but without friction), on the other hand, a double-peaked response is found, indicating wave-like propagation of stresses. We discuss the main reasons for the different behaviors of {{experimental and}} model systems, and compare our findings with previous works. Comment: 7 pages, revtex 4 +psfig, 4 figure...|$|R
