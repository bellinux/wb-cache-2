40|$|In a {{previous}} study {{it was found that}} when p-type (100) silicon wafers in a fused quartz wafer carrier were annealed in argon in the temperature range 900 ~ 176 S iQ migrated over the Si wafer surface and etched it. In this initial study, ex-periments were isochronal, sothat different degrees of etching occurred at each temperature studied. In the present study, the heat-treatments were conducted in a high purity argon atmosphere for periods of t ime so chosen that at each tempera-ture an approximately equal weight loss of silicon, due to the etching process, could be expected. The effects of heat-treat-ment on the resulting surface morphology of etch structures of (100), (110), or (111) silicon wafers were compared. It was found under these equal weight loss conditions that the etching at T-< 1000 ~ is anisotropic (polyhedron etch pits are ob-served) while at higher temperatures a close to isotropic behavior is observed. It is bel <b>ieved</b> that the crystallographic etch structure generation in the anisotropic etching regime begins at crystal attice defect sites or at impurity inhomogeneit ies. In addit ion to the crystallographic etch pit structures, there is observed at very high magnifications, 9000 times, a slight background structure in the anisotropic etching regime. Here, it is bel <b>ieved</b> that this background structure is the be-ginning of crystallographically defined etch pits, originating again at some sort of crystal defect.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Landslides are {{significant}} geological hazards {{that can have}} destructive effectives on human life and property. Mostly people living in mountainous areas, and their properties, face crit ical danger from landslide disasters. Landslides are triggered due to unsustainable anthropogenic activities like mining, road cutting, urbanization, as well as natural causes like earthquakes and rainfall. Thus, landslide detection is an essential requirement in p re and post disaster hazard analysis. In earlier studies, landslide detection was often ach <b>ieved</b> through time consuming, cost intensive field surveys and visual orthophoto interpretation. Recent studies show that Earth Observation (EO) data offer new opportunities for fast, reliable and accurate landslide identification at smaller scales. This can contribute for effective landslide monitoring and hazard management. Sir Lanka is a tropical island comprising a heavy mountainous region in the centre.

The photoreaction of halogenated 1 -acetonaphthones as well as 1 -methyl naphthoates with a-cyanoenamines resulted as a rule in two substitution products and regioselective in two "head/tail" 1, 2 -cycloadducts.

However, this method does not reflect RTT increase sufficiently when packets are buffered at a bottleneck router. Therefore, in this paper, we separate a resource allocation problem into two phases: fair allocation of bottleneck link capacity and that of buffer space at the bottleneck router.

It does not replace cryptography but rather boosts the security using its obscurity features. The proposed method uses both Cryptography and Steganography to enhance the security of the message. The secret message is first encrypted using RSA algorithm and then randomized using OAEP [1]. This encoded message is then embedded in the bitmap cover image using frequency domain approach. For embedding the encrypted message, initially skin tone regions of the cover image are detected using HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) model. Thereafter, a region from skin detected area is selected, which is known as the cropped region. In this cropped region secret message is embedded using DD-DWT (Double Density Discrete Wavelet Transform). DD-DWT overcomes the intertwined shortcomings of DWT (like poor directional selectivity, Shift invariance, oscillations and aliasing) [2]. Hence the image obtained after embedding secret message (i. e. Stego image) is far more secure and has an acceptable range of PSNR.
