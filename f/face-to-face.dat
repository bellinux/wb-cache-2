5|$|On 12 November 2008, Felton {{appeared}} alongside Jack Osbourne on Adrenaline Junkie as {{he participated}} in various challenges in South Africa, including a 200ft bungee jump on Bloukrans Bridge, took a ride in a helicopter, followed by a parachute freefall and came <b>face-to-face</b> with Great White sharks.|$|E
5|$|On March 11, 2000, Giuliani and Clinton met <b>face-to-face</b> for {{the first}} time since the campaigning began, at the New York Inner Circle press dinner, an annual event in which New York {{politicians}} and the press corps stage skits, roast each other and make fun of themselves, with proceeds going to charity.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor and Amy {{reconcile}} {{and return}} to the TARDIS after saying their goodbyes. Amy is about to tell the Doctor of her impending wedding when she is interrupted by a call to the TARDIS from Winston Churchill, who is <b>face-to-face</b> with a Dalek.|$|E
5|$|Written by Clayton Hickman. A story {{considered}} for the fourth series, it would have seen Rose Tyler investigating a weird oil leak in Park Vale Comprehensive school, located near Bannerman Road, before coming <b>face-to-face</b> with Sarah-Jane again.|$|E
5|$|A Starfleet Admiral {{and former}} {{commanding}} officer of the Enterprise. Kirk and Khan never confront each other <b>face-to-face</b> during the film. All of their interactions are over a viewscreen or through communicators and their scenes were filmed four months apart, although a draft script had Khan defeating Kirk in a swordfight. Meyer described Shatner as an actor who was naturally protective of his character and himself, and who performed better over multiple takes.|$|E
5|$|An FAA {{official}} {{requested a}} <b>face-to-face</b> meeting with Cooper aboard the aircraft, which was denied. The refueling process was delayed {{because of a}} vapor lock in the fuel tanker truck's pumping mechanism, and Cooper became suspicious; but he allowed a replacement tanker truck to continue the refueling—and a third after the second ran dry.|$|E
5|$|Immediately after Cloudbase's {{apparent}} destruction, Symphony {{wakes up}} in the desert; she is <b>face-to-face</b> with Scarlet and Blue, {{who are part of}} the ground forces that have been dispatched to rescue her. In the final scene, it is explained that Symphony dreamt the attack on Cloudbase in a nightmare brought on by the heat of the desert sun.|$|E
5|$|In {{automatic}} test pattern generation, finding cliques {{can help to}} bound {{the size of a}} test set. In bioinformatics, clique-finding algorithms have been used to infer evolutionary trees, predict protein structures, and find closely interacting clusters of proteins. Listing the cliques in a dependency graph is an important step in the analysis of certain random processes. In mathematics, Keller's conjecture on <b>face-to-face</b> tiling of hypercubes was disproved by , who used a clique-finding algorithm on an associated graph to find a counterexample.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of Raoul Silva's attack on MI6, a cryptic message sets in motion events that will see James Bond come <b>face-to-face</b> with the sinister organisation known as SPECTRE. As Gareth Mallory, the newly appointed M, continues fighting political pressures that threaten the future of MI6, Bond follows a trail from Mexico to Austria and Morocco as he is drawn into a confrontation with an enemy from his past; one who holds a dangerous secret that will force him to question the value of everything he has fought to protect.|$|E
5|$|In the episode, alien time {{traveller}} the Doctor (Matt Smith) {{takes his}} new companion Clara Oswald (Jenna-Louise Coleman) to the Rings of Akhaten, where several planets revolve around a larger one. They attend a religious festival where the young Queen of Years, Merry Gejelh (Emilia Jones), {{is about to}} be sacrificed. Determined to save Merry, the Doctor and Clara come <b>face-to-face</b> with the parasite of Akhaten, who requires memories, stories, and items of sentimental value.|$|E
5|$|John Ratzenberger and Kathy Najimy as John and Mary, respectively. John and Mary both {{live on the}} Axiom and are so {{dependent}} on their personal video screens and automatic services that they are oblivious to their surroundings, for instance not noticing that the ship features a giant swimming pool. However, they are brought out of their trances after separate encounters with WALL-E, eventually meeting <b>face-to-face</b> for the first time.|$|E
5|$|Replying to the Wrights' letters, the U.S. {{military}} expressed {{virtually no}} interest in their claims. The brothers {{turned their attention to}} Europe, especially France, where enthusiasm for aviation ran high, and journeyed there {{for the first time in}} 1907 for <b>face-to-face</b> talks with government officials and businessmen. They also met with aviation representatives in Germany and Britain. Before traveling, Orville shipped a newly built Model A Flyer to France in anticipation of demonstration flights.|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. In this episode, a French salvage ship sends a diving crew to recover a mysterious {{wreckage}} from World War II, but the crew falls prey to a bizarre illness forcing FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) to investigate the source. Their investigation brings them <b>face-to-face</b> with Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea).|$|E
5|$|Troika used first-person {{perspective}} to immerse the {{player in the}} setting, interacting <b>face-to-face</b> with the characters and seeing their facial reactions to the player. It chose to follow a single-character to aid the immersion, creating the isolation of a vampire unable to trust any other character. This aided the story and compensated for the technical issues of allowing multiple player characters.|$|E
5|$|Andrew Peck also {{considers}} the Slender Man {{to be an}} authentic form of folklore and notes its similarity to emergent forms of offline legend performance. Peck suggests that digital folklore performance extends the dynamics of <b>face-to-face</b> performance in several notable ways, such as by occurring asynchronously, encouraging imitation and personalization while also allowing perfect replication, combining elements of oral, written, and visual communication, and generating shared expectations for performance that enact group identity {{despite the lack of}} a physically present group. He concludes that the Slender Man represents a digital legend cycle that combines the generic conventions and emergent qualities of oral and visual performance with the collaborative potential of networked communication.|$|E
5|$|Courtship {{begins when}} a male follows a female until he meets her <b>face-to-face.</b> He then strokes {{her face and}} neck with his {{elongated}} front claws, a gesture returned by a receptive female. The pair repeat the process several times, with the male retreating from and then returning to the female until she swims to the bottom, where they copulate. As the male is smaller than the female, he is not dominant. The female stores sperm, {{to be used for}} up to three clutches, in her oviducts; the sperm may remain viable for up to threeyears. A single clutch may have multiple fathers.|$|E
5|$|Different {{combinations}} of players, gongs and mallets {{can be used}} for playing the agung: two players with each assigned their own gong or just one. When playing alone, the agung player could either play both gongs with the player holding the higher-pitched gongs <b>face-to-face,</b> with the lower one held at an angle by an assistant for stability, or just one gong. The latter style, common among downriver Maguindanaos in Simuay, who consider this style an old one, uses only the higher-pitch gong for it, unlike the lower-pitched gong, is considered the lead gong, therefore having primary importance. An example of this is when single gong agungs are used during a tagunggo piece.|$|E
5|$|Dragon's Egg is a 1980 {{hard science}} fiction novel by Robert L. Forward. In the story, Dragon's Egg is {{a neutron star}} with a surface gravity 67billion times that of Earth, and {{inhabited}} by cheela, intelligent creatures {{the size of a}} sesame seed who live, think and develop a million times faster than humans. Most of the novel, from May to June 2050, chronicles the cheela civilization beginning with its discovery of agriculture to advanced technology and its first <b>face-to-face</b> contact with humans, who are observing the hyper-rapid evolution of the cheela civilization from orbit around Dragon's Egg.|$|E
5|$|Early in the film, Hoffman {{explains}} to his superiors that the terrorists' retreat to pre-tech age communication methods renders useless the high specification tools the CIA uses, {{and increases the}} worth of Ferris's human intelligence methods. They avoid mobile telephones and computers, preferring <b>face-to-face</b> communication and encoded written messages. By contrast, the Americans use sophisticated communication (Hoffman and Ferris regularly speak on the phone) and surveillance (high altitude spy planes offer {{a different point of}} view throughout) technology. David Denby of The New Yorker said that this was Scott's suggestion that the CIA has the technology but not the human intelligence to properly fight terrorism in the Middle East.|$|E
5|$|Goffman's {{early works}} consist of his {{graduate}} writings of 1949–53. His master's thesis was {{a survey of}} audience responses to a radio soap opera, Big Sister. One of its most important elements was a critique of his research methodology – of experimental logic and of variable analysis. Other writings of the period include Symbols of Class Status (1951) and On Cooling the Mark Out (1952). His doctoral dissertation, Communication Conduct in an Island Community (1953), presented a model of communication strategies in <b>face-to-face</b> interaction, and focused on how everyday life rituals affect public projections of self.|$|E
5|$|In May at the 34th French Championships the men's doubles tournament {{took place}} first. With Lacoste – Borotra's victory over Tilden – Hunter and Cochet – Brugnon's easy win over Gregory – Collins {{in the semifinals}} secured the Four Musketeers their third doubles <b>face-to-face</b> final. Unfortunately for Cochet in the fifth set they were serving for the match and had thirty-love in the game, when Brugnon missed an easy ball when three match points were at stake. Lacoste and Borotra revived {{from that moment on}} and closed out the final set 8–6. In singles he was put out of the contest by Borotra in the semifinals and thus was unable to retain his title. However, Cochet did not leave without a trophy as the mixed {{championship}} was earned by him and Eileen Bennett Whittingstall.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, {{the film}} was {{released}} on VHS on June 18, 1996, through Manga Entertainment, and on DVD on March 31, 1998, by Anchor Bay Entertainment. Manga Entertainment released the film on Blu-ray on November 24, 2009; this version contains the original film and the remastering, but omits the audio commentary and <b>face-to-face</b> interview with Oshii, which are listed on its box. Manga Entertainment and Anchor Bay Entertainment re-released the film on Blu-ray with a brand new HD film print on September 23, 2014. The release was met with criticism for its poorly-translated English subtitles and lack of special features.|$|E
5|$|Jharokha Darshan was a daily {{practice}} {{of addressing the}} public audience (darshan) at the balcony (jharokha) at the forts and palaces of medieval kings in India. It was an essential and direct way of communicating <b>face-to-face</b> with the public, and was a practice which {{was adopted by the}} Mughal emperors. The balcony appearance in the name of Jharokha Darshan also spelled jharokha-i darshan was adopted by the 16th-century Mughal Emperor Akbar, even though it was contrary to Islamic injunctions. Earlier, Akbar's father Emperor Humayun had also adopted this Hindu {{practice of}} appearing before his subjects at the jharokha to hear their public grievances.|$|E
5|$|On December 1, 1884, a town sheriff named Elfego Baca came <b>face-to-face</b> against 80 gunmen {{which became}} known as the Frisco shootout. The battle started when Baca arrested a cowboy who had shot him. In turn the cowboy called upon 80 of his {{associates}} to murder Baca. Baca took refuge in an adobe house, and {{over the course of a}} 36-hour siege, the gunmen put 400 bullet holes in the house (some accounts say a total of 4,000 shots) without touching Baca. He in turn killed 4 of them and wounded 8. When the shooting was over as the attackers finally ran out of ammo, Baca strolled out of the house unscathed. Baca went on to a distinguished career as a lawyer and legislator and died in his bed in 1945, age 80.|$|E
5|$|Since {{real time}} conversations are impossible, the humans send {{sections}} of the expedition's library. After reading an astronomy article, a cheela realizes that the supernova half a million human years ago created both their races. Many cheela generations later, {{but only a few}} hours for humans, cheelas develop gravity manipulation. A few generations later, a cheela spacecraft visits the human one. Although they still need extreme gravity fields to survive, the cheela can now control them precisely enough for both races to see each other <b>face-to-face</b> in safety. The cheela have decided that transferring their technologies, now far advanced of humans', would stunt humanity's development. However the cheela leave clues in several challenging locations, before going their separate ways.|$|E
5|$|Transmission occurs through {{inhalation}} {{of airborne}} variola virus, usually droplets expressed from the oral, nasal, or pharyngeal mucosa of an infected person. It {{is transmitted from}} one person to another primarily through prolonged <b>face-to-face</b> contact with an infected person, usually within a distance of 6 feet (1.8 m), but can also be spread through direct contact with infected bodily fluids or contaminated objects (fomites) such as bedding or clothing. Rarely, smallpox has been spread by virus carried in the air in enclosed settings such as buildings, buses, and trains. The virus can cross the placenta, but the incidence of congenital smallpox is relatively low.|$|E
