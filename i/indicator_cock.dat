500|$|On 5 May 1998, a fire {{broke out}} onboard [...] while off the Western Australia coast. The fire {{was caused by the}} rupture of a {{flexible}} fuel line (one of a number used to replace rigid hoses) on cylinder number nine, starboard engine. This sprayed diesel fuel onto a hot <b>indicator</b> <b>cock,</b> which ignited a spray fire, resulting in the deaths of four crew. Following the fire, the Australian Government and the RAN began a major investigation known as the Westralia Board of Inquiry. The enquiry found that the RAN and the contractor Australian Defence Industries (ADI) did not critically examine their course of action and that key personnel in both the RAN and the contractor were insufficiently trained and qualified. The inquiry also found that the hoses were not properly designed and were unfit for the intended purpose. In 2005, ADI was fined $75,000 for failing to provide a safe workplace. Seven sailors who were severely traumatised by the fire have also sued ADI and subcontractor Jetrock. In August 2006, the Australian Government decided to accept liability after it reached settlement with the ADI and Jetrock. The seven sailors stand to receive compensation totalling up to $10million.|$|E
5000|$|To further complicate matters, a {{large engine}} is usually [...] "blown over" [...] first with zero fuel {{settings}} and the <b>indicator</b> <b>cocks</b> open, {{to prove that}} the engine is clear of any water build up and that everything is free to turn. After a successful blow ahead and a blow astern, the <b>indicator</b> <b>cocks</b> are closed on all the cylinders, and then the engine can be started on fuel. Significant complexity is added to the engine by using an air-start system, as the cylinder head must have an extra valve in each cylinder to admit the air in for starting, plus the required control systems. This added complexity and cost limits the use of air-starters to very large and expensive reciprocating engines.|$|R
50|$|The Caracal is a striker fired {{semi-automatic}} pistol, {{meaning the}} trigger system {{is of the}} hammerless short double-action-only type.A <b>cocking</b> <b>indicator</b> below the rear sight indicates visibly and tactilely if the pistol is cocked and ready to fire.The trigger travel is 8 mm with a trigger pull of 22 N.|$|R
5000|$|The Smith & Wesson SW99 is a modern, polymer frame pistol that {{is nearly}} {{identical}} to the Walther P99. The SW99 features an internal striker, {{as opposed to the}} classical external hammer. It is chambered in 9mm Para, [...]40 S&W, and [...]45 ACP. The pistol lacks a manual safety; instead a de-cocking button is placed on the top rear section of the slide, which when actuated, places the firearm into double-action mode. This mechanism differs with each variation of the action as explained below. The SW99 features several safety features including a loaded chamber indicator {{on the right side of}} the slide, a protruding, red-painted <b>cocking</b> <b>indicator,</b> and a drop safety. As with the P99, the <b>cocking</b> <b>indicator</b> does not protrude from the slide of the QA variant unless the weapon is fired, as it is in a constant partially cocked state. The SW99 also features a fully supported chamber design, which leaves no portion of the chambered round exposed. Because of this there is less chance of casing head rupture, reducing risk of injury to the shooter and/or destruction of the pistol.|$|R
5000|$|Meriden {{manufactured}} 12, 16, and 20 gauge sidelock double-barrel shotguns {{fitted with}} steel, laminated, twist, and Damascus barrels. Some of these guns were engraved by artisans who formerly worked for Parker (also located in Meriden). The shotguns were well made and {{available in a}} variety of grades. All had automatic safeties and <b>cocking</b> <b>indicators.</b> Barrels could be had in twist, damascus of several grades, armory steel or Krupp steel. Hammerless or hammer shotguns with varying amounts of engraving were available.|$|R
5000|$|In August 1963, the 5" [...] heavy barrel version {{came into}} the market. Stoeger's Shooter's Bible of 1964 shows a 7 3/8" [...] barrel grooved for Olympic center weights. The <b>cocking</b> <b>indicator</b> and 7 3/8" [...] bbl were dropped in 1978. The 7" [...] bbl was {{introduced}} in 1978 with no provision for a muzzle brake. A 6" [...] barrel was offered {{for a few months}} in 1991. In 1992 the Model 41 was dropped from production. In 1994 Smith & Wesson returned it to production as the Model 41 (New Model).|$|R
50|$|The P9S trigger {{operates}} as a traditional double action. There is a lever {{on the left side}} of the pistol grip to both decock a cocked hammer or to manually re-cock it for a single action first shot, a feature first observed on the Sauer 38H. A further function of the decocking lever is to release the slide stop. The hammer is concealed within the slide (also similar to the Sauer) with a protruding pin at the rear of the slide as a <b>cocking</b> <b>indicator.</b> The operating spring surrounds the barrel, allowing for a lower bore axis than pistols such as John Browning's M1911 that have the operating spring below the barrel. A manual firing-pin safety is located at the left rear of the slide; putting it in the down position locks the firing pin and flipping it up to level position unlocks it.|$|R
50|$|Apart {{from the}} 1926 alterations, {{production}} continued steadily {{from the beginning}} of the 1920s until the middle of the 1930s, when Beretta made further changes. Towards 1935 the appearance of the pistol was deemed outdated, and the handgrip was altered to be similar to the Beretta Model 1934. Later, a <b>cocking</b> <b>indicator</b> was also introduced: an extension of the firing pin protruding from the back of the slide. Otherwise, the so-called small Berettas remained more or less unchanged, in that most of the essential parts (barrel, magazine, etc.) were interchangeable. While changes to the gun during this time were minimal, the name was changed often. These various model numbers can be found only in the Beretta catalogues. All guns manufactured up to the mid-1930s are marked simply, IBREV. 1919. Subsequent models until the end of the war are marked Brevettata. They included their date of manufacture in both the Julian Calendar and Fascist-era based Roman numerals. Similar guns produced immediately after the war can be marked Brevettata, but more often as Brevet.|$|R

This propositions are important for consumers of the poultry meat too. Some methods for blood investigation as hematological and biochemical give to us a valuable information about metabolism of animals and they are base for appreciate of health. They often conduct to detect different metabolism disorders even on the beginning of disease. The same methods, which we are using in the big farming animals, we are not using in the breeding poultry. The aim of the presented paper was verify the influence of continual application p/o different forms of zinc in the feed on the hematological <b>indicators</b> in breeder <b>cocks</b> during the period of theirs development. The obtained results show that in period of development from the 10 th to the 25 th week of the age and also in period of sexual maturation from the 25 th to the 35 th week of age most of indicators of their redblood picture in the control group and experiment groups were in the uppers physiological boundaries, without dependence of indicators on application different form of zincAvailable from STL Prague, CZ / NTK - National Technical LibrarySIGLECZCzech Republi...|$|R
5000|$|Pressured {{by dozens}} of imitations and the {{proliferation}} of blatant unlicensed copies, FN began work in earnest on a successor product to the Model 1908 Vest Pocket pistol. The basic Vest Pocket pistol design was used {{as a starting point for}} the new design. Dieudonn√© Saive (who would later design the Browning Hi-Power pistol and FN FAL rifle) was asked during 1926-1927 to design the new pistol. His design was smaller, lighter, and incorporated several refinements and improvements to the M1908 version. For example, the hand palm activated grip safety mechanism was eliminated and the small safety lever on the left side of the receiver was extended under the grip so that the thumb of a right-handed shooter could easily engage and disengage it using pressure applied to the side of the safety lever - rather than pushing it down into the receiver- without having to release one's grip on the pistol. This improvement was at the cost of the slide hold-back feature that was eliminated in the new design. The receiver has a full-length dust guard extending to the end of the slide and an area behind the trigger is relieved to allow a user to maintain a more substantial grip on the pistol. The Dieudonne Saive design also introduced a magazine safety mechanism similar to the one utilized on the Colt Vest Pocket pistol. Parts are not interchangeable between these pistols. [...] A <b>cocking</b> <b>indicator</b> was also incorporated on the back of the slide. This model was marketed under the name [...] "Baby" [...] - and some of the original thermal hardened plastic grips were molded with both the initials [...] "FN" [...] at the top of the grip in a circle and the word [...] "BABY" [...] at the bottom of the grip under a raised crescent. This particular pistol was and continues to be known worldwide as the [...] "Baby Browning" [...] pistol and is the pistol reflected in the picture accompanying this article, excepting the BROWNING marked grip which indicates a more recent (circa 1960 and beyond) production run utilizing nylon impregnated polymer grips.|$|R
