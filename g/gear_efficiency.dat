5000|$|Inspecting a graph of {{traction}} motor <b>gear</b> <b>efficiency</b> [...] shows 98% efficiency at nominal power but only 94% efficiency at 30% of nominal power. To get {{the efficiency of}} the motor and gears (connected in series), the two efficiencies must be multiplied. If the weighted {{traction motor}} efficiency is 90%, then 90% x 94% = 85% (very rough estimate) which is not too much lower than that estimated the 90% supporters mentioned above. If per the table 75% of power to the substation reaches the locomotive motors then 75% x 85 = 64% (roughly) of the power to the substation (from the USSR's power grid) reaches the wheels of the locomotives in the form of mechanical energy to pull the trains. This neglects the power used for [...] "housekeeping" [...] (heating, lighting, etc.) on passenger trains. This is over the whole range of operating conditions in the early 1970s. There are a number of ways to significantly improve this 64% figure and it fails to take into account savings due to regeneration (using the traction motors as generators to put power back on the catenary to power other trains).|$|E
5000|$|When calculating average {{efficiency}} {{over a period}} of time, one needs to take an average of efficiencies weighted by the product of power input and time (of that segment of power input): [...] where [...] is the power input and [...] is the efficiency during time [...] If efficiency is low at very low power, then this low efficiency has a low weighting due to the low power (and the low amount of energy thus consumed). Conversely, high efficiencies (presumably at high power) get high weighting and thus count for more. This may result in a higher {{average efficiency}} than would be obtained by simply averaging efficiency over time. Another consideration is that the efficiency curves (that plot efficiency vs. current) tend to drop off rapidly at both low current and very high current for traction motor efficiency, and at low power for <b>gear</b> <b>efficiency)</b> so it is not a linear relationship. Investigations [...] for diesel locomotives show that the lower notches (except notch 0 which is [...] "motor off") of the controller (and especially notch 1 - the lowest power) are much less used than the higher notches. At very high currents, the resistive loss is high since it is proportional to the square of the current. While a locomotive may exceed the nominal current, if it goes too high the wheels will start slipping. [...] So the unanswered question is just how often is nominal current exceeded and for how long? The instructions for starting a train from a stop [...] suggest exceeding the current where the wheels would normally start to slip, but to avoid such slipping by putting sand on the rails (either automatically or by depressing a [...] "sand" [...] button just as the wheels start to slip).|$|E

In the present study, a technique was developed to utilize the copious amounts of data available from an open-ocean fishery for sea scallops Placo-pecten magellanicus in a spatially explicit depletion model. In June 1999, Georges Bank Closed Area II was opened to the commercial scallop fleet after a 5 -year multispecies fishing ban. During the 5 -month opening, the spatial distribution and magnitude of fishing effort was tracked through vessel monitoring systems, and a relatively small but still substantial number of catch observations were made aboard vessels from the commercial fleet. A spatial analysis of both catch and effort data was utilized to select areas consistent with the assumptions of a DeLury analysis. Maximum likelihood estimation was then used to generate a single estimate of the catchability coefficient (and thus efficiency), while simultaneously estimating the initial abundance in each area.

Test equipment commonly used in gear research was analysed to identify important parameters for <b>gear</b> <b>efficiency</b> testing. The effect of the bearing model's load-dependent losses on gear mesh efficiency was also investigated. Two different surface finishes of gears, ground and superfinished, were investigated to determine how two different load levels during running-in affect gear mesh efficiency and changes in surface roughness. Efficiency and gear temperature were also measured for ground and superfinished gears with dip lubrication, as well as two different forms of spray lubrication (before and after gear mesh contact). Tests on a gear test rig, showed that different assemblies of the same test setup can yield different measurements of torque loss. The applied bearing model had a significant effect on the estimated gear mesh efficiency. The mesh efficiency of ground gears is affected by the running-in procedure, with a higher running-in load resulting in a higher mesh efficiency than a lower load. This effect was not seen for superfinished gears, which show the same gear mesh efficiency for both running-in loads. Gearbox efficiency increased with spray lubrication rather than dip lubrication. The gear mesh efficiency increased, and thus gear temperatures were reduced, when superfinished gears were used rather than ground gears. A lower gear temperature was measured when gears were spray lubricated at the mesh inlet rather than the mesh outlet. QC 20170314 </p...|$|E

This article presents an object based, numerically efficient gear contact in a planar environment with user-defined friction- and stiffness laws. The emphasis of the modeling is not a fully detailed contact model, but the description of a gear contact model which can be used for system simulations like complete aircraft electro-mechanical actuators including control surfaces. The presented model is suitable for complex gearing configurations (e. g. compound planetary gears). This is enabled by breaking down the transmission into the basic gear contacts.
