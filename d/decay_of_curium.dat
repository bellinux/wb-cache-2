5|$|In the universe, thorium {{is among}} the rarest of the {{primordial}} elements, because {{it is one of}} the two elements that can be produced only in the r-process, and also because it has slowly been decaying away from the moment it formed. The only primordial elements rarer than thorium are uranium, also produced only by the r-process, and thulium, lutetium, tantalum, and rhenium, the odd-numbered elements just before the third peak of r-process abundances around the heavy platinum group metals. Neutron capture by nuclides beyond A = 209 often results in nuclear fission instead of neutron absorption, reducing the fraction of nuclei that cross the gap of instability past bismuth to become actinides such as thorium. In the distant past the abundances of thorium and uranium were enriched by the <b>decay</b> <b>of</b> plutonium and <b>curium</b> isotopes, and thorium was enriched relative to uranium by the <b>decay</b> <b>of</b> 236U to 232Th and the natural depletion of 235U, but these sources have long since decayed and no longer contribute.|$|R

Once separated from the other minor actinides, the seven curium isotopes in spent fuel can lead to nuclear fission with the subsequent release of {{a large amount of}} radiation. Several isotopes <b>of</b> <b>curium</b> also generate a significant amount of heat by radioactive decay.

40|$|Curium poses special {{problems}} in the chemical preparation of spent nuclear fuel for transmutation. Once separated from the other minor actinides, the seven curium isotopes in spent fuel can lead to nuclear fission with the subsequent release of {{a large amount of}} radiation. The investigation takes into account the fact that the isotropic concentrations of the fuel may change with varying fuel burn up, initial fuel enrichment, and age of the spent fuel. A neutron criticality code was used to determine the effective neutron multiplication factor for varying quantities <b>of</b> <b>curium</b> held within cylindrical containers or stored in a spherical shape. A sphere has minimal surface area for a given volume <b>of</b> <b>curium</b> and its shape minimizes the loss of neutrons through the surface. This is considered the “conservative” or worst case shape. The second shape analyzed was a square cylinder in which the diameter and height are equal. This is the conservative case of a cylinder since it minimizes surface area for a given volume. Both “bare” and “shielded” masses <b>of</b> <b>curium</b> were considered. A bare mass is surrounded by air with no container walls. A shielded mass involves curium placed in a 1 / 8 inch thick steel wall container. To estimate the extreme or “conservative” case, we also studied the impact <b>of</b> placing <b>curium</b> in water, a significant neutron moderator. Recommendations are made on the maximum amount <b>of</b> <b>curium</b> that can be safely stored or handled before encountering nuclear criticality. Several isotopes <b>of</b> <b>curium</b> also generate a significant amount of heat by radioactive decay. For spent nuclear fuel, 2. 6 watts of heat may be generated for every gram <b>of</b> <b>curium.</b> This will present {{special problems}} when curium is separated from the other minor actinides. If kilogram-quantities <b>of</b> <b>curium</b> are stored in a container, for example, the curium may heat to an equilibrium temperature that exceeds the melting temperature of this actinide. Sustained fission can be avoided by preventing the accumulation of a critical mass <b>of</b> <b>curium.</b> The heat generation <b>of</b> <b>curium</b> presents even more restriction on the mass <b>of</b> <b>curium</b> that can safely be contained in one location.

40|$|The {{separation}} and partitioning of used commercial reactor fuel {{is a vital}} component of any reprocessing or transmutation strategy. To process the high actinide fuels required for a transmutation effort, the Chemical Technology Division (CMT) at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) is developing a pyrochemical separations process. Currently, this work is being done via small experiments. While {{this is more than}} sufficient to develop the technologies required to process actinide-bearing fuels, it does not allow for the direct investigation of criticality concerns that would be present in larger systems. As the volume of waste to be treated increases, a higher probability exists that fissionable isotopes of plutonium, americium, and curium can accumulate, forming a critical mass. These criticality events can be avoided by ensuring the effective neutron multiplication factor, keff, remains below a safe level. Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate keff are the best way to examine the criticality safety of the proposed separation processes, and will allow engineers to develop proper safety measures for the reprocessing and fabrication of high actinide fuels. A related problem for handling high actinide fuels is the heat generated by the <b>decay</b> <b>of</b> the higher actinides. In particular, the presence <b>of</b> <b>curium</b> in transuranic wastes poses a significant problem. To minimize the impact <b>of</b> <b>curium</b> on the fabrication of actinide-bearing fuels, the process engineers and chemists would like to remove the curium from the fuel. Curium, however, not only poses a criticality concern, but also includes isotopes that generate a great deal <b>of</b> <b>decay</b> heat. This heat generation creates safety problems with regards to handling and storing curium. The decay heat can cause samples to melt very quickly if excessive quantities <b>of</b> <b>curium</b> are present. SCALE, a Monte Carlo code, simulates the scattering and absorption of neutrons. This technique permits assessment of what quantities <b>of</b> <b>curium</b> will result in a critical mass. This information is then combined with thermal transfer models to examine the decay heat issue, and evaluate thermally and critically safe storage configurations for curium-rich waste streams...|$|R
