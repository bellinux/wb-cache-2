50|$|Methanol <b>de-ice</b> <b>fluid</b> {{has been}} {{employed}} {{for years to}} de-ice small wing and tail surfaces of small to medium-sized general aviation aircraft and is usually applied with a small hand-held sprayer. Methanol can only remove frost and light ground ice prior to flight.|$|R
50|$|<b>De-icing</b> <b>fluids</b> {{consisting}} of propylene glycol (PG) and additives {{are widely used}} by airlines for de-icing aircraft. Ethylene glycol (EG) fluids are still in use for aircraft de-icing {{in some parts of}} the world because it has a lower operational use temperature (LOUT) than PG. However, PG is more common because it is less toxic than ethylene glycol.|$|R
25|$|Ethylene glycol {{disrupts}} hydrogen bonding when {{dissolved in}} water. Pure ethylene glycol freezes at about 12°C (10.4°F), but when mixed with water, the mixture does not readily crystallize, {{and therefore the}} freezing point of the mixture is depressed. Specifically, a mixture of 60% ethylene glycol and 40% water freezes at 45°C (49°F). Diethylene glycol behaves similarly. It {{is used as a}} <b>de-icing</b> <b>fluid</b> for windshields and aircraft. The antifreeze capabilities of ethylene glycol have made it a component of vitrification (anticrystallization) mixtures for low-temperature preservation of biological tissues and organs. Mixture of ethylene glycol and water can also be chemically termed as glycol concentrate/compound/mixture/solution.|$|E
500|$|On December 27, 1999, {{the state}} awarded a $85.7million {{contract}} (equivalent to $ in [...] ) for {{the replacement of}} the S-Curve on US131. Deposits of gypsum under the roadway were dissolving and causing it to settle. A deteriorating bridge also forced the reconstruction of the freeway through the area. Construction began on January 15, 2000, diverting the roughly 115,000vehicles per day that used the stretch of road to detours through the downtown area. As part of the project, a $1.2million (equivalent to $ in [...] ) de-icing system was installed. The system is designed to spray a <b>de-icing</b> <b>fluid</b> on the roadway that would be carried by car tires up to a mile (1.6km) along the road surface. This fluid is expected to melt ice at temperatures below the [...] at which salt stops working. [...] Unlike salt, the non-corrosive de-icer does not harm the bridge, but it is more costly. The system is designed to be activated manually, or automatically via sensors along the road. However, plowing would still be required on the roadway. The idea behind the de-icing system is to keep the pavement wet and prevent the formation of ice.|$|E

Field and laboratory observations were conducted at a microscale level, in order {{to gain a better understanding}} of the microphysical phenomena that influence the performance and degradation of <b>de-icing</b> <b>fluids.</b> In the field tests, two flat plates and a cylindrical surface were treated with Type II fluid and were exposed to natural precipitation. High magnification cameras were used to observe the performance of the fluids, under snow, ice pellets and freezing drizzle conditions. Depending on the precipitation type, different modes of fluid failure were identified. For snow and ice pellet precipitation, failure appeared as inability of the fluid to melt the incoming precipitation elements. In snow cases, the melting time of individual snow flakes, was identified as a potential metric to characterize fluid failure.

40|$|The {{determination}} of the fate of aircraft <b>de-icing</b> <b>fluids</b> in near runway soils is important in evaluating environmental impacts and {{in the design of}} treatment system. The effect of biodegradation of the primary component of <b>de-icing</b> <b>fluids,</b> propylene glycol (PG), was tested in waters-saturated sand columns. Biogrowth significantly reduced the hydraulic conductivity of the sand. This change in hydraulic conductivity affects both the flow of water and the rate of migration of dissolved chemicals in the flowing water. With intermittent loading averaging 43 mg PG/d, hydraulic shear and endogenous biomass decay balanced bacterial growth. A lower final conductivity occurred at a lower flow rate, but increased loading (by two to four times) did not lower the final conductivity. After significant sand plugging by the bacteria grown on PG, periods of five to eight days when PG was not present resulted in significant partial recovery of the original conductivity. A trend of decreasing hydraulic conductivity with increasing biomass was observed. The results are important to consider when determining the fate of de-icing compounds in near runway soils and in the design of biofilters for treatment.

40|$|In {{order to}} ensure that icing does not {{adversely}} affect the weight and aerodynamic properties of commercial aircraft and consequently impair safety, a procedure is required for de-icing of the aircraft. The main constituents of <b>de-icing</b> <b>fluids</b> are propane- 1, 2 -diol (propylene glycol) and water. Unpleasant odour and in some cases health impairments were observed during and after landing following the use of a non-standard procedure to de-ice an aircraft. The suspected cause was ingress of neurotoxic organophosphates caused by contaminated bleed air. Measurement data on chemical contamination of the cabin atmosphere are not available for the flight concerned. The non-standard de-icing procedure was followed during test flights involving the same aircraft. Volatile organic compounds and organophosphates were among the substances measured quantitatively during these tests. A range of <b>de-icing</b> <b>fluids</b> were analysed by means of gas chromatography and mass spectrometry as part of the study.

40|$|The biodegradabilities of glycol- and acetate-based {{aircraft}} <b>de-icing</b> <b>fluids</b> on airport surfaces {{have been}} investigated at three temperatures between 0 °C and 10 °C.

40|$|Environmental {{contamination}} with aircraft <b>de-icing</b> <b>fluids</b> (ADF) {{is becoming}} a concern. Propylene glycol (PG) composes the largest fraction of the ADF most commonly in use in the U. S. The biodegradation of PG and ADF in saturated and unsaturated sand columns was evaluated, {{in addition to the}} impact of biodegradation on the hydrodynamic characteristics of the porous media. In studies with unsaturated sand, the amount of PG removed increased with spilled concentration (from 1000 to 300, 000 mg/L), but decreased as multiple pore volumes were spilled. Tests in saturated columns were conducted at average loadings of ADF or PG of 43 to 32, 000 mg/d. The hydraulic conductivity of the sand was reduced due to biogrowth, but to a lesser extent with increasing PG or ADF loadings above 110 mg/d. At higher groundwater flow rates, there was less biomass accumulation in the sand and therefore less decrease in hydraulic conductivity. Dispersivity increased over time as bacteria grew in the sand.

40|$|Aircraft <b>de-icing</b> <b>fluids</b> (ADF) are {{a source}} of water and soil {{pollution}} in airport sites. Propylene glycol (PG) is a main component in several commercial formulations of ADFs. Even though PG is biodegradable in soil, seasonal overloads may result in occasional groundwater contamination. Feasibility studies for the biostimulation of PG degradation in soil have been carried out in soil slurries, soil microcosms and enrichment cultures with and without the addition of nutrients (N and P sources, oligoelements), alternative electron acceptors (nitrate, oxygen releasing compounds) and adsorbents (activated carbon). Soil samples have been taken from the contaminated area of Gardermoen Airport Oslo. Under aerobic conditions {{and in the absence of}} added nutrients, no or scarce biomass growth is observed and PG degradation occurs by maintenance metabolism at constant removal rate by the original population of PG degraders. With the addition of nutrient, biomass exponential growth enhances aerobic PG degradation also at low temperatures (4 °C) that occur at the high season of snowmelt. Anaerobic PG degradation without added nutrients still proceeds at constant rate (i. e. no biomass growth) and gives rise to reduced fermentation product (propionic acid, reduced Fe and Mn, methane). The addition of nitrate does not promote biomass growth but allows full PG mineralization without reduced by-products.
