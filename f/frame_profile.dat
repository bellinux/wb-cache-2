40|$|The {{article is}} devoted to {{effectiveness}} of using of monosymmetrical I-beams with flexible wall frame structures of variable section, features of their calculation and design. Aim: The aim of research is to confirm the feasibility of I-beams with flexible wall bearing as light metal skeletons for buildings of the universal assignment. Materials and Methods: In {{order to reduce the}} metal consumption a frame is conventionally divided into several sections according to bending moment diagrams so that in the more compressed zone section the belt of great area was located, and in the stretched or less intense zone the lesser belt was installed. The resulting sections have smaller area in compare to symmetric profiles. Additional reduce bending moments provided as a result of displacement of elements axes with variable cross section. Results: The calculations and selection of sections of the frame have shown that it can be achieved the reducing of bearing elements weight by 10 % compared to the symmetrical profiles of variable stiffness due to using monosymmetrical sections. The effectiveness of the proposed constructive solution is confirmed by compare of the projected weight frame construction with existing analogue. The symmetrical <b>frame</b> <b>profile</b> is 15. 3 % lighter; the monosymmetrical <b>frame</b> <b>profile</b> is 27 % lighter. Conclusions: Analysis of stress-strain state structures shown: first, through asymmetrical profile there is a shifting of the center of gravity section, which leads to a redistribution of internal forces in the frame; secondly, because of the small cross-sectional area of the stretched zones more difficult to ensure the stability of the plane form of bending beams, which leads to the necessity to disconnect areas curtain beams by constraints of smaller steps...|$|E

A variety of different <b>frame</b> <b>profile</b> options has been proposed as alternatives to existing window systems. The condensation risk from the reference model was compared to that of the alternatives using two-dimensional steady-state heat transfer simulations.

40|$|The need of {{emerging}} markets telecom, {{specifically in the}} Indian telecom scenario,WiMAX is being looked as a broad-band access solution ahead of LTE and other competing technologies due its long range and high bandwidth. Voice Over IP (VoIP) will potentially be the killer application for emerging market like India. In this {{paper we propose a}} Kiosk based WiMAX infrastructure model to provide voice connectivity to rural Indian villages. In the proposed kiosk model, plain old telephones are connected to a WiMAX sub-scriber station using Foreign Exchange Subscriber and aMe-dia Gateway. The novelty of the kiosk based infrastructure models is that it has low deployment cost from a service provider perspective, and almost negligible equipment cost for the end user. In order to make the kiosk based model economically sus-tainable, the number of simultaneous voice calls that can be supported over the WiMAX subscriber stations needs to be maximized. To this end, the paper proposes a Dynamic <b>Frame</b> <b>Profile</b> algorithm to maximize the number of VoIP calls supported over a single subscriber station. A perfor-mance evaluation of the the proposed Dynamic Frame Pro-file algorithm is also carried out to study its effectiveness and reported in this paper. 1...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} some of {{the research}} done during the last 8 years at the Technical University of Denmark developing improved low-energy window solutions. The focus has been on maximizing the net energy gain of windows for residential buildings. The net energy gain of windows is the solar gain minus the heat loss integrated over the heating season. It is assumed that in northern cold climates all of the solar gain during the heating season can be utilized for space heating. Problems with overheating in the summer period must be solved with overhang or moveable solar shading devices. Two windows have already been developed and prototypes constructed for laboratory test and a third generation of the window design is now in the developing and designing phase in a new project. The first window constructed was made of wood profiles and a low-energy double glazing unit. The second and third windows are made of fiber-reinforced plastic (plastic reinforced by fine fibers made of glass). This composite material is a weatherproof material with very low thermal conductivity and high mechanical strength. These properties make the material very suitable for <b>frame</b> <b>profiles</b> due to lower heat loss and longer durability of the window. The glazing in these fiber reinforced polyester windows is both unsealed and sealed triple glazing units. To increase the net energy gain slim <b>frame</b> <b>profiles</b> have been developed to increase the glazing area and thereby the solar gain. The challenge when developing slim <b>frame</b> <b>profiles</b> is to make enough space for hinges and fasteners and still maintaining the functionality and strength of the window. Proposals for new hinges and handles are also given in this paper. 1...|$|R
