5|$|In {{order to}} {{showcase}} the PlayStation Portable's capabilities, {{the team had}} to develop a download system that could provide the game with future downloadable content, which included new tracks, music and ships. In addition, Burrows realised that new downloadable content {{had the potential to}} bring in more revenue for Studio Liverpool. In order to achieve this, the team {{had to find a way}} to bypass the problems involved in getting the PlayStation Portable to recognise <b>download</b> <b>files.</b> The solution required the use of piggybacking game data to a valid format recognised by the PlayStation Portable; in which a dummy file would be used on a web-based Java application.|$|E

25|$|On 3 May 2006, Opera Mini 2.0 was released. It {{included}} {{new features}} {{such as the ability}} to <b>download</b> <b>files,</b> new custom skins, more search engine options on the built-in search bar, a speed dial option, new search engines, and improved navigation.|$|E
50|$|Plugins for Mozilla Firefox {{which use}} ClamWin to scan <b>downloaded</b> <b>files</b> are also available. Several other {{extensions}} allow users to process <b>downloaded</b> <b>files</b> with any software and scan the files with ClamWin.|$|R

25|$|Some BBSes, called elite, WaReZ or pirate boards, were {{exclusively}} {{used for}} distributing cracked software, phreaking, and other questionable or unlawful content. These BBSes often had multiple modems and phone lines, allowing several users to upload and <b>download</b> <b>files</b> at once. Most elite BBSes used {{some form of}} new user verification, where new users would have to apply for membership and attempt {{to prove that they}} were not a law enforcement officer or a lamer. The largest elite boards accepted users by invitation only. Elite boards also spawned their own subculture and gave rise to the slang known today as leetspeak.|$|E
25|$|What {{resulted}} was {{a perfect}} storm that almost completely destroyed the BBS market through 1995. Technically, Internet service offered an enormous advantage over BBS systems, as a single connection to the user's Internet service provider allowed them to contact services around the world. In comparison, BBS systems relied on a direct point-to-point connection, so even dialing multiple local systems required multiple phone calls. Moreover, Internet protocols allowed that same single connection {{to be used to}} contact multiple services at the same time, say <b>download</b> <b>files</b> from an FTP library while checking the weather on a local news web site. In comparison, a connection to a BBS allowed access only to the information on that system.|$|E
25|$|Using a {{transparent}} proxy has the unintended side effect, quite independent of IWF filtering, of appearing to websites connected to as originating from the proxy IP {{instead of the}} user's real IP. Some sites detect the user's IP and adjust their behaviour accordingly. For example, if trying to <b>download</b> <b>files</b> from a file distribution website which restricts free-of-charge usage by enforcing a delay of typically 30 minutes between downloads, any attempt to download is interpreted as originating from the ISP's proxy rather than the user. The consequence is that if any user of that ISP has downloaded any file from the site in the last half-hour (which is very likely for a large ISP), the download is not allowed. This is an unintended consequence of ISP's use of proxy servers, not IWF filtering. File sharing sites distribute files of all types; for example Linux distribution files, which are very large. The use of proxy servers is also reported to have caused the problem with editing Wikipedia (but not the blocking of the actual offending web page) reported above.|$|E
5000|$|Like {{many other}} P2P applications, Share <b>downloads</b> <b>files</b> in blocks. However Share can only export {{partially}} <b>downloaded</b> <b>files</b> in sequential manner. For example, if a file has 100 blocks and block 51 is missing, Share {{will not be}} able to export block 52-100 even if they are already downloaded. Winny does not have this limitation.|$|R

2500|$|A new update in August 2016 changed several visual {{elements}} of the website; the logo was updated, search box design was refreshed, and the primary color was changed from red to blue. It also improved the functionality to <b>download</b> <b>files</b> locally from the website; users can now compress and download large Drive items into multiple 2 GB [...]zip files with an improved naming structure, better Google Forms handling, and empty folders will now {{be included in the}} [...]zip, thereby preserving the user's folder hierarchy.|$|E

But {{this will not be}} a traditional subscription model – in particular, no file will be blocked from access by the public. Rather, a subscription will permit a member to <b>download</b> <b>files</b> without having to wait a certain number of seconds, eliminiate some of the advertising on the site, and a few other benefits. I see this as a way to both preserve IMSLP’s philosophy of open access and to secure IMSLP’s future.' ...|$|E

30|$|Apps may load code {{dynamically}} {{in several}} ways [32]. Though we handled dynamically loaded native shared libraries, {{it is still not}} a complete solution. Apps may <b>download</b> new dex <b>files</b> or binaries from network and load code from these <b>downloaded</b> <b>files.</b> Such runtime behaviors may affect the completeness of Sensor Guardian’s hooking since static instrumentation techniques cannot predict the <b>files</b> to be <b>downloaded</b> and instrument the dynamically <b>downloaded</b> <b>files</b> at runtime. In the future, we will address this problem by analyzing and hooking apps’ dynamically loading behaviors with both static and dynamic methods.|$|R
