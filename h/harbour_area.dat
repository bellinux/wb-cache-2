5|$|A {{couple of}} months after the {{beginning}} of the French occupation, the Maltese people rebelled against the French and blockaded them in the <b>Harbour</b> <b>area</b> with British, Neapolitan and Portuguese support. The French managed to hold out in Valletta until September 1800, when General Vaubois capitulated to the British, who took control of the islands.|$|E
5|$|Mondion {{also made}} further plans to {{strengthen}} Mdina's fortifications, {{but they were}} not implemented since the Order focused on building its fortifications in the <b>harbour</b> <b>area.</b> The only major addition to the Mdina fortifications after Mondion's reconstruction was Despuig Bastion, which was built during the reign of Ramon Despuig between 1739 and 1746.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{significant}} fortifications in the <b>harbour</b> <b>area,</b> {{the rest of}} the islands remained mostly undefended until the 17th century, and they were prone to attacks (such as the raid of 1551). This changed in 1605, when Garzes Tower was built in Mġarr on the island of Gozo. This watchtower no longer exists as it was demolished by the British administration in 1848.|$|E
5|$|French forces invaded Malta in June 1798, and the Order capitulated after {{a couple}} of days. The French {{occupied}} the island until September, when the Maltese rebelled and blockaded the French forces in the <b>harbour</b> <b>area</b> with foreign help. The Floriana Lines remained under French control throughout the blockade, and the Maltese built Tas-Samra Battery and a battery on Corradino in order to bombard them.|$|E
5|$|The French evicted the Order from Malta {{during the}} Mediterranean {{campaign}} of 1798, and the Order surrendered {{after a couple}} of days. The Maltese, although initially welcoming the French occupiers, rebelled {{after a couple of}} months due to a number of reforms and the looting of churches. The insurgents took control of Gozo which became briefly independent, as well as Mdina and the towns and villages of the main island, leaving the French blockaded in the well-defended <b>harbour</b> <b>area.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Maltese insurgents, {{helped by}} the British, hastily built various fortifications mainly {{intended}} to repel a possible French counter-attack, {{and at the same}} time also bombard French positions in the <b>harbour</b> <b>area.</b> The insurgents had various camps, and men in these camps were responsible for a number of batteries, redoubts and entrenchments in the vicinity. The most important batteries were the Corradino Batteries, Għargħar Battery, Tal-Borg Battery and Tas-Samra Battery.|$|E
5|$|The beech {{forests of}} Riis Skov and Marselisborg occupy the hills {{along the coast}} {{to the north and}} south, and apart from the city centre, sandy beaches form the {{coastline}} of the entire municipality. There are two public seabaths, the northern Den Permanente below Riis Skov and close to the <b>harbour</b> <b>area,</b> and the southern Ballehage Beach in the Marselisborg Forests. As in most of Denmark, there are no private beaches in the municipality, but access to Den Permanente requires a membership, except in the summer.|$|E
5|$|The fortifications {{surrounded}} the entire <b>harbour</b> <b>area,</b> stretching {{all the way}} from Sliema to Kalkara. The design of the batteries was based on the coastal batteries and entrenchments built by the Order in the 18th century, while most of the entrenchments consisted of long stretches of rubble walls. They were armed by guns taken from coastal fortifications such as Saint Mary's Tower. The usefulness of the fortifications was tested in 1799 when a French counter-attack from Fort Manoel was repelled by the insurgent batteries.|$|E

5|$|Motor {{traffic in}} the city grew {{significantly}} and in 1972 the trams were replaced by buses. From the 1960s, on the initiative of the young architect Jan Gehl, pedestrian streets and cycle tracks were created in the city centre. Activity in the port of Copenhagen declined with {{the closure of the}} Holmen naval base. Copenhagen Airport underwent considerable expansion, becoming a hub for the Nordic countries. In the 1990s, large-scale housing developments were realized in the <b>harbour</b> <b>area</b> and in the west of Amager. The national library's Black Diamond building on the waterfront was completed in 1999.|$|E
5|$|Today, the {{architectural}} and historical value of Malta's fortifications is widely acknowledged, and many {{also serve as}} tourist attractions. All fortifications were included on the Antiquities List of 1925, and virtually all surviving Hospitaller fortifications are now listed on the National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands, Malta's national heritage register. The fortified city of Valletta has been listed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO since 1980. The other fortifications around Malta's <b>harbour</b> <b>area,</b> the fortified cities of Mdina and the Cittadella, {{as well as the}} Victoria Lines have been on the tentative list of World Heritage Sites since 1998.|$|E
5|$|With the {{development}} of the rail network, Roskilde became an important hub for traffic with Copenhagen. In the 1870s and 1880s, the harbour was extended attracting industrial firms to the area. By the end of the century, there were tobacco factories, iron foundries and machine shops. At the beginning of the 20th century, Roskilde first prospered as a satellite community for Copenhagen but then, as ships increased in size, suffered {{from the fact that the}} harbour was too small and Roskilde Fjord too shallow for navigation. Industries began to move out of the <b>harbour</b> <b>area</b> but were still the largest source of employment, thanks in part to the spirits factory (De Danske Spritfabrikker) and the slaughterhouse (Roskilde Andelssvineslagteri).|$|E

5|$|Although Mdina was {{no longer}} the capital city, the Order still {{strengthened}} the city's defences, and gradually upgraded its medieval walls into a gunpowder fortress. In the 1540s, during the magistracy of Juan de Homedes y Coscon, two bastions were built on the corners of the city's land front. The central De Redin Bastion was built by Grand Master Martin de Redin in the mid-17th century. The city was damaged during the 1693 Sicily earthquake, and repairs were made {{over the course of the}} 18th century. During the rebuilding, the city's entrance was replaced by a larger gate by the architect Charles François de Mondion in 1724, and the last modifications were made in 1746, when Despuig Bastion was completed. There were other plans to strengthen the city but these were not implemented as the Order focused on the fortifications at the <b>harbour</b> <b>area.</b>|$|E
5|$|Arbroath smokies, {{for which}} Arbroath is {{well-known}} nationally and internationally, are made solely in Arbroath following the award of Protected Geographical Indication in 2004, which limits Arbroath smokie production to within 4km of Arbroath. Smokies {{are made from}} haddock using traditional methods {{dating back to the}} late 19th century where the fish are first salted overnight to preserve them, before being left tied in pairs to dry. Next, the dried fish are hung in a special barrel containing a hardwood fire and covered with a lid. After around an hour of smoking, the fish are golden brown and ready to eat. The preparation of smokies remains a cottage industry in Arbroath, centred almost exclusively at the <b>harbour</b> <b>area.</b> However, one larger processor, RR Spink, supplied Arbroath smokies to several UK supermarket chains. It appears that, nowadays, the firm concentrates on smoking other fish such as salmon or trout and no longer supplies the Arbroath Smokie. The company holds the Royal Warrant as a fishmonger to the Queen.|$|E
5|$|From 1723 to 1733, Fort Manoel {{was built}} on Manoel Island in Marsamxett Harbour, so as to protect Valletta's western flank. The Baroque fort is square in shape, with four corner bastions. It was the last major fort to be built with the bastioned trace in Malta. The Order's last major {{fortification}} in the <b>harbour</b> <b>area</b> was Fort Tigné, built at Tigné Point between 1793 and 1795. It was built to protect the entrance of Marsamxett, along with Fort Saint Elmo. The fort's architecture {{is very different from}} the Order's earlier forts, and although very small by 18th century standards, it has been described as among the most revolutionary and influential of Malta's fortifications as it is a very early example of a polygonal fort. Many other polygonal forts were built by the British later on in the 19th century.|$|E

5|$|On 31 March—just a {{fortnight}} {{after his arrival}} in Australia—MacArthur sent Casey and his air officer, Brigadier General Harold H. George to survey the situation in Port Moresby. They drew up plans to develop it into a base to support future operations. They recognised that to secure the area required work far beyond its environs. They called for the airfield at Horn Island to be upgraded, and new airfields to be constructed on the Cape York Peninsula north of Townsville around Mareeba, Cooktown and Coen. This would allow ships to have fighter cover crossing the Torres Strait. To protect Port Moresby's eastern flank, GHQ decided to establish an airstrip in the Abau–Mullins <b>Harbour</b> <b>area.</b> Milne Bay was subsequently determined {{to be a better}} location, and a garrison was sent by sea from Port Moresby on 22 June.

5|$|The {{ultimatum}} expired at 09:00 East Africa Time (EAT) on 27 August, {{by which}} time the British had gathered three cruisers, two gunboats, 150 marines and sailors, and 900 Zanzibaris in the <b>harbour</b> <b>area.</b> The Royal Navy contingent were {{under the command of}} Rear-Admiral Harry Rawson while their Zanzibaris were commanded by Brigadier-General Lloyd Mathews of the Zanzibar army (who was also the First Minister of Zanzibar). Around 2,800 Zanzibaris defended the palace; most were recruited from the civilian population, but they also included the sultan's palace guard and several hundred of his servants and slaves. The defenders had several artillery pieces and machine guns, which were set in front of the palace sighted at the British ships. A bombardment opened at 09:02 set the palace on fire and disabled the defending artillery. A small naval action took place, with the British sinking the Zanzibari royal yacht HHS Glasgow and two smaller vessels, and some shots were fired ineffectually at the pro-British Zanzibari troops as they approached the palace. The flag at the palace was shot down and fire ceased at 09:40.|$|E
