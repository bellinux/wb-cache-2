To examine this a two-dimensional model of the shank and <b>heel</b> <b>pad</b> was developed using DADS. The model contained a <b>heel</b> <b>pad</b> element and a rigid skeleton to which was connected soft tissue which could move relative to the bone. Simulations permitted estimation of <b>heel</b> <b>pad</b> properties directly from <b>heel</b> <b>pad</b> deformations, and from the kinematics of an impacting pendulum. These two approaches paralleled those used in vitro and in vivo respectively.

40|$|In human walking, {{external}} forces act {{in three dimensions}} to accelerate the body.

Both of these have been well researched. Transverse forces are relatively small and have received relatively little attention. Transverse and sagittal forces can both, however, change the conditions of rotation of the body about a vertical axis, as can a further force component, the vertical free moment.

40|$|Introduction: The plantar <b>heel</b> <b>pad</b> is a {{specialized}} fibroadipose tissue that attenuates and, in part, dissipates the impact energy associated with heel strike. Although near maximal deformation of the <b>heel</b> <b>pad</b> {{has been shown}} during running, in vivo measurement of the deformation and structural properties of the <b>heel</b> <b>pad</b> during walking remains largely unexplored. This study employed a fluoroscope, synchronized with a pressure platform, to obtain force–deformation data for the <b>heel</b> <b>pad</b> during walking. Methods: Dynamic lateral foot radiographs were acquired from 6 male and 10 female adults (age, 45 ± 10 yrs; height, 1. 66 ± 0. 10 m; and weight, 80. 7 ± 10. 8 kg), while walking barefoot at preferred speeds. The inferior aspect of the calcaneus was digitized and the sagittal thickness and deformation of the <b>heel</b> <b>pad</b> relative to the support surface calculated. Simultaneous measurement of the peak force beneath the heel was used to estimate the principal structural properties of the <b>heel</b> <b>pad.</b> Results: Transient loading profiles associated with walking induced rapidly changing deformation rates in the <b>heel</b> <b>pad</b> and resulted in irregular load–deformation curves.

The objective of this work was to obtain the hyperelastic and viscoelastic material properties of <b>heel</b> <b>pad</b> sub-layers (skin, micro-chamber and macro-chamber layers) in-vivo. An anatomically detailed 3 D Finite Element model of the human heel was used to derive the sub-layer material properties.

30|$|The {{most often}} used {{weight-bearing}} level of amputation below the knee is the Syme and the Boyd amputations [7, 20]. Both procedures are, in fact, ankle exarticulations that do not disturb the epiphysis. Syme described his technique of exarticulation of the foot in 1842, in which he covered {{the end of the}} tibia and fibula with the strong skin of the <b>heel</b> <b>pad.</b> The main problems described with Syme’s technique are possible posterior migration of the <b>heel</b> <b>pad,</b> <b>heel</b> <b>pad</b> slough and fitting problems. However, in general, these issues are reported as not significant [9]. The Boyd amputation, described in 1939, is also a disarticulation through the ankle, but in this procedure, the posterior part of the calcaneus is preserved and fused to the distal tibia [21, 22]. The <b>heel</b> <b>pad</b> remains attached to the posterodistal part of the calcaneus, preventing <b>heel</b> <b>pad</b> migration after solid fusion of the posterior part of the calcaneus to the distal tibia. From a personal experience, a Syme amputation gives a more natural placement of the <b>heel</b> <b>pad</b> in those children that have a severe equinus hind foot with a low height of the talus calcaneus (synostosis) bone in fibular deficiency, where the <b>heel</b> <b>pad</b> just fits over the end of the tibia with or without fibula.

Compression can inhibit healing by hindering circulation. Seeing a professional for treatment as soon as possible is important, because this injury can lead to an Achilles tendon rupture with continued overuse. Other treatments may include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen, ultrasound therapy, manual therapy techniques, a rehabilitation program, and in rare cases, application of a plaster cast.
