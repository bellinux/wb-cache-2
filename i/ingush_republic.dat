The gathering was directed at the top leadership of the Soviet Union, and included a request to [...] "restore the Ingush people’s autonomy within their historical borders, the Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic with a capital in the right-bank {{part of the city}} of Ordzhonikidze".The <b>Ingush</b> <b>Republic</b> was to be organized out of six traditional Ingush districts (including the contested Prigorodny District). The rise of the Russian Federation gave the Ingushetians the independence they vowed for. During the 1990s, Ingushetia was ruled by its elected president Ruslan Aushev, a former Soviet general and hero of the war in Afghanistan ...|$|E

Amid the increasing tensions, Zyazikov fired his government in March 2008, and called for further social and economic reforms.|$|E

High prevalence and prolonged period of breast feeding in Chechen and <b>Ingush</b> <b>Republics</b> (compared to other districts of Russian Federation) {{can be explained by}} their cultural and ethnical peculiarities.

There were many (predominantly Russian) migrants {{from other parts of the}} Soviet Union, who often settled in the abandoned family homes of Chechens and <b>Ingushes.</b> The <b>republic</b> lost its Prigorodny District which transferred to North Ossetian ASSR, but gained predominantly Russian Naursky District and Shelkovskoy District that is considered the homeland for Terek Cossacks.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The law {{and order}} {{authority}} service including military are characterized with ‎higher physical exercises and psychoemotional stress that result in forming specific functioning of ‎regulation system in organism. Endocrine system (hypothalamus – hypophysis – thyroid or ‎hypothalamus – hypophysis – adrenal axis etc.) provides increasing or decreasing of organism ‎stability and depends from environment and life activity. In army the processes of long-term ‎adaptation are activated. Under this circumstances the hormones (including thyroid) changes ‎biosynthetic organization processes. ‎During long-time effects of severe factors in hypothalamus – hypophysis – thyroid regulation ‎system occurred changes that reflect in other regulatory mechanisms. This changes results in ‎natural adaptation reactions in energy metabolism, total metabolism in tissues and organs. ‎In consideration of endocrine system importance, social factors in adaptation forming the ‎investigation of hormonal levels in different conditions are actual scientific and practical ‎problem. ‎Objective: The aim of our investigation is analysis of hormonal supplying by hypophysis – ‎thyroid regulation system at different law-enforcement officer groups in dependence from ‎professional stress. ‎Method: The two healthy men group (130 persons), aged 23 - 35 years that living in Archangelsk ‎‎(Russia) were investigated. The first group is Ministry of Home Affairs law-enforcement officers, ‎but second group is civilians unrelated to law-enforcement service. In according to professional ‎occupation the first group was divided in three categories. In first category were combatants that ‎send {{on a mission to}} Caucasus (Chechen, <b>Ingush</b> <b>Republics)</b> for maintenance of law order. The ‎mission duration was 3 month. The total number of missions to war conflict territories in all ‎service life was 2 - 3 times. The investigation of combatants were doubly: before 2 day from ‎mission to war conflict territory and in 2 days after returning to principal place of service ‎‎(Archangelsk city, Russia). The second category of law-enforcement officers includes law-‎enforcement school students. At last, the third group consists from policemen that maintain law ‎order in territory without war conflict and never take part in combat mission. ‎The fasting blood samples from ulnar venous were exercise at all people. The blood serum ‎thyrotrophic hormone (TSH), thyroxin (Т 4) and triiodothyronine (Т 3) were determined by ‎enzymoimmunoassay (commercial assay kit “Monobind Inc. ” USA). ‎The database was analyzed statistically by computer programme (SPSS 15. 0). The significance ‎critical level (p) in check of statistic hypothesis was taken low than 0. 05 but 0. 1 ≤p> 0. 05 ‎estimated as tendency. For estimation of universe distribution we used Shapiro-Wilk normality ‎test that revealed abnormal distribution in all groups. In connection with it comparative analysis ‎of means provided by nonparametric criterions: for dependent samples (combatants before and ‎after mission) we used Wilcoxon criterion, but for independent samples (combatant – students – ‎policemen – civilians) we used Mann-Whitney criterion. ‎Result: Analyses of our results are shown that hormonal levels at all persons were in normal ‎physiological limits. ‎Together with it, we revealed significant differences of hypophysis and thyroid gland serum ‎hormonal means between comparative groups as for dependent samples well as for independent ‎samples. ‎The maximal blood serum TSH mean were detected at before mission combatants and in law-‎enforcement school students, but minimal this ne index were at policemen and civilians. ‎The blood serum thyroid hormones (thyroxin and triiodothyronine) in different groups of law-‎enforcement officers are vary in dependence from professional stress. At law-enforcement school ‎students and before mission combatants a Т 4 were minimal in comparison with policemen and ‎after mission combatants. In this time as to Т 3 were revealed counterpositions that’s law-‎enforcement school students and before mission combatants have maximal levels but policemen ‎and after mission combatants – minimal levels. ‎Conclusion: The revealed differences of endocrine system indexes in law-enforcement officer ‎group with intense load are probable adaptive reactions to extreme professional factors. This one ‎provides optimal physiological adjustments to military stress etc. ...|$|R
50|$|Chechen-Ingush ASSR - Formed on 5 December 1936, {{when the}} North Caucausus Kray was disestablished and its {{constituent}} Chechen-Ingush Autonomous Oblast was elevated into an ASSR and subordinated to Moscow. Following the en masse deportation of the Chechens and Ingush, on 7 March 1944, the ChIASSR was disbanded, and the Grozny Okrug was temporarily administered by Stavropol Kray until the 22 March, when the territory was portioned between North Ossetian and Dagestan ASSRs, and the Georgian SSR. The remaining land was merged with Stavropol Krays Kizlyar district and organised as Grozny Oblast, which existed until 9 January 1957 when the ChIASSR was re-established though only the southern border's original shape was retained. Declared sovereignty on 27 November 1990 as the Chechen-Ingush Republic. On 8 June 1991, the 2nd Chechen National Congress proclaimed a separate Chechen-Republic (Noxchi-Cho), and on September 6, began a coup which overthrew the Soviet local government. De facto, all authority {{passed to the}} self-proclaimed government which was renamed as the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria in early 1993. In response, the western Ingush districts after a referendum on 28 November 1991, were organised into an <b>Ingush</b> <b>Republic</b> which was officially established on 4 June 1992, by decree of Russian President as the Republic of Ingushetia. The same decree de jure created a Chechen republic, although it would be established only on 3 June 1994 and carry out partial governance during the First Chechen War. The Khasavyurt Accord would again suspend the government on 15 November 1996. The present Chechen Republic government was re-established on 15 October 1999.|$|E
