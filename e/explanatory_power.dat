5|$|During the 20th {{century and}} {{following}} the wide-scale adoption of the scientific method, astrology has been challenged successfully on both theoretical and experimental grounds, and {{has been shown to}} have no scientific validity or <b>explanatory</b> <b>power.</b> Astrology thus lost its academic and theoretical standing, and common belief in it has largely declined. While polling studies have demonstrated that approximately 25% of Americans, Canadians, and Britons say they continue to believe that star and planet positions affect their lives, astrology is now recognized as pseudoscience.|$|E
5|$|Halley's {{prediction}} of the comet's return {{proved to be}} correct, {{although it was not}} seen until 25 December 1758, by Johann Georg Palitzsch, a German farmer and amateur astronomer. It did not pass through its perihelion until 13 March 1759, the attraction of Jupiter and Saturn having caused a retardation of 618 days. This effect was computed prior to its return (with a one-month error to 13 April) by a team of three French mathematicians, Alexis Clairaut, Joseph Lalande, and Nicole-Reine Lepaute. The confirmation of the comet's return was the first time anything other than planets had been shown to orbit the Sun. It {{was also one of the}} earliest successful tests of Newtonian physics, and a clear demonstration of its <b>explanatory</b> <b>power.</b> The comet was first named in Halley's honour by French astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille in 1759.|$|E

40|$|Recursion is a {{fundamental}} concept of Computer Science {{that is difficult to}} teach and learn. Students have many misconceptions about recursion and construct mental models of recursion which are non-viable. A mental model is a student's mental representation of recursion and it provides them with predictive and <b>explanatory</b> <b>powers</b> about recursion. A mental model is non-viable if it does not allow a student to accurately and consistently represent the process of recursion...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{employs a}} {{vector autoregressive model}} to {{investigate}} the impact of macroeconomic and financial variables on a UK real estate return series. The results indicate that unexpected inflation, and the interest rate term spread have <b>explanatory</b> <b>powers</b> for the property market. However, the most significant influence on the real estate series are the lagged values {{of the real estate}} series themselves. We conclude that identifying the factors that have determined UK property returns over the past twelve years remains a difficult task...|$|R
25|$|Two {{hypothesis}} {{tests are}} particularly widely used. First, {{one wants to}} know if the estimated regression equation is any better than simply predicting that all values of the response variable equal its sample mean (if not, it is said to have no <b>explanatory</b> <b>power).</b> The null hypothesis of no explanatory value of the estimated regression is tested using an F-test. If the calculated F-value is found to be large enough to exceed its critical value for the pre-chosen level of significance, the null hypothesis is rejected and the alternative hypothesis, that the regression has <b>explanatory</b> <b>power,</b> is accepted. Otherwise, the null hypothesis of no <b>explanatory</b> <b>power</b> is accepted.|$|E

25|$|Second, {{for each}} {{explanatory}} variable of interest, {{one wants to}} know whether its estimated coefficient differs significantly from zero—that is, whether this particular explanatory variable in fact has <b>explanatory</b> <b>power</b> in predicting the response variable. Here the null hypothesis is that the true coefficient is zero. This hypothesis is tested by computing the coefficient's t-statistic, as {{the ratio of the}} coefficient estimate to its standard error. If the t-statistic is larger than a predetermined value, the null hypothesis is rejected and the variable is found to have <b>explanatory</b> <b>power,</b> with its coefficient significantly different from zero. Otherwise, the null hypothesis of a zero value of the true coefficient is accepted.|$|E
40|$|This paper critiques {{the alleged}} {{value of the}} notion of 'party dominance' or the 'dominant party system', mainly {{propagated}} in South Africa by Roger Southall, Hermann Giliomee and Charles Simkins, and very much in vogue amongst scholars in the Netherlands, and to some extent in the USA and other places. Its overseas lineage is traced and its <b>explanatory</b> <b>powers</b> critiqued. It is argued that the approach is flawed democratically in being anti-popular and that it also lacks explanatory value. It is argued that it is neither a theory nor a system...|$|R
40|$|Though {{widely used}} in the {{literature}} of sociology ideal types have received little systematic explication. One of the difficulties is the ambiguity surrounding the usage of types as theoretical or definitional statements. Beginning with the types constructed by Weber and his contemporaries the discussion proceeds by analyzing subsequent revisions as they relate to {{the subject matter of the}} social sciences. Suggestions for improving the <b>explanatory</b> <b>powers</b> of typologies are made based on the kinds of knowledge deemed relevant for observer and actor at differing levels of the social world...|$|R
5000|$|Subsymbolic {{modeling}} includes Connectionist/neural network models. Connectionism {{relies on}} the idea that the mind/brain is composed of simple nodes and that the power of the system comes primarily from the existence and manner of connections between the simple nodes. Neural nets are textbook implementations of this approach. Some critics of this approach feel that while these models approach biological reality as a representation of how the system works, they lack <b>explanatory</b> <b>powers</b> because complicated systems of connections with even simple rules are extremely complex and often less interpretable than the system they model.|$|R

25|$|According to Steven Schafersman, {{president}} of Texas Citizens for Science, {{an advocacy group}} opposing creationism in public schools, the progressive adoption of methodological naturalism—and later of metaphysical naturalism—followed the advances of science and the increase of its <b>explanatory</b> <b>power.</b> These advances also caused the diffusion of positions associated with metaphysical naturalism, such as existentialism.|$|E
40|$|Child labour in India is a {{critical}} socio-economic problem that needs special attention of policy makers. In order to make effective policies to reduce child labour {{it is important to}} understand the specific factors that affect it in different situations. The paper empirically examines these factors across 35 Indian states and union territories at three levels of aggregation: total population, rural/urban, and male/female. The results showed that education, fertility, and workforce participation are the major influencing factors in our models. Interestingly, impact of economic indicators of poverty and income differed among total, rural, urban, male, and female population. The <b>explanatory</b> <b>powers</b> of models showed large variations across different levels of aggregation and were stronger for total, rural and female population. ...|$|R
30|$|Kahneman [29], {{and other}} {{behavioural}} scientists, questioned the <b>explanatory</b> <b>powers</b> of the rational agent model, {{because they could}} not make their empirical data fit the rational agent model. As psychologists—or behavioural scientists—they studied how people actually behave, as opposed to how they are assumed to behave according to the rational agent model. Thereby they provided empirical data that supported a new view—namely that people’s judgement errors were not at all non-systematic and thus random, but in fact systematic; people tended to make the same kinds of misjudgments as others did, and misjudgments made today are the same as those made yesterday. Thus, people’s mistakes were more or less universal. Findings like these paved the way for an extension of Bounded Rationality as a concept of understanding human behaviour [24].|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} prior {{research}} on user technology acceptance {{from the perspective}} of theoretical structures based on Markus and Robey’s causal structure. Prior studies usually take a technology imperative perspective, use variance theories, and emphasize the micro level of analysis. We argue that this combination is limited. This may lead to some inconsistencies and limited <b>explanatory</b> <b>powers</b> in the existing studies. We propose an alternative “emergent perspective – process theories – mixed level of analysis” approach to study technology acceptance phenomena. To demonstrate how the new approach can be used to guide research, a new research model is proposed and several propositions are derived and discussed. This study draws on several prior theories and models but reassembles them in a novel way. The paper concludes with implications for both research and practice...|$|R

A string of cases in the 1980s saw the High Court of Australia re-affirm the continuing vitality of traditional equitable doctrines.

25|$|With few {{exceptions}} throughout the literature, symbolic predispositions has presented more substantive and statistical <b>explanatory</b> <b>power</b> on {{attitudes and behaviors}} than self-interest. Only in occasional exceptions, as when there are clear and substantial stakes as job cuts or regarding tax burdens or ambiguous and dangerous threats as compulsory military draft lottery, self-interest has a clear effect on political attitudes and behavior. Even in these cases, the impact of self-interest are quite specific to the issues in question.|$|E
50|$|The factor {{replication}} method {{attempts to}} replicate the return stream of the hedge fund universe. The simplest way of doing this is by carrying out a linear regression, {{using one of the}} headline hedge fund indices and a number of factors. The model selects the factors that have the highest <b>explanatory</b> <b>powers</b> for the index returns, and then each month the model will perform the regression analysis over a rolling time frame, and select the weightings for each of these factors. This method is backward looking and may miss inflection points in the market as it relies on a rolling window of returns. Improvements to this method have been suggested, such as using Kalman or Particle filters, which improve the speed at which the model reacts to change.|$|R
40|$|When {{you look}} at a {{circular}} plate at an angle, it looks circular. But there also is a certain sense in which its look can be described as oval. When you move, the plate’s look changes with your perspective on it—nevertheless, it continues to look circular. This chapter investigates whether these “constancy in variation” phenomena can be explained in terms of the representational content of visual experience, and whether constancy in variation provides special, phenomenological, reasons to construe experience as having centered contents. Concentrating on shape, it argues that due to warring phenomenological demands, all views construing constancy in variation as representation of both objective and perspectival properties or features have limited <b>explanatory</b> <b>powers,</b> and that centering does not provide any advantage. By contrast, adopting the non-standard intentionalism called phenomenal intentionalism, we get rather natural explanations of the phenomenology of constancy in variation...|$|R
40|$|In today’s highly {{technological}} Western societies, {{people who}} live in cities can easily have their basic needs met, and most non-essential materialistic desires are also most easily fulfilled in the city. Nevertheless, city people still express an inclination to experience or conserve nature. Especially in Danish society nature appears as a recurring theme in popular culture. Following two different ontological viewpoints, this project seeks to better understand the inclination towards nature. Kenneth Gergen’s social constructionism and Per Esben Stoknes’ ecopsycology are used to analyse to which extent the inclination towards nature can be understood as a result of cultural influence or as an inborn predisposition. Following a discussion of the theories’ <b>explanatory</b> <b>powers,</b> the project concludes that while both social constructionism and ecopsycology provide valuable insight in understanding the phenomenon, they are ultimately inadequate to explain the phenomenon in a satisfactory manner...|$|R
25|$|Theistic {{evolution}} largely {{disappeared from}} the scientific literature {{by the end of}} the 19th century as direct appeals to supernatural causes came to be seen as unscientific. The other alternatives had significant followings well into the 20th century; mainstream biology largely abandoned them only when developments in genetics made them seem increasingly untenable, and when the development of population genetics and the modern synthesis demonstrated the <b>explanatory</b> <b>power</b> of natural selection.

The utility and <b>explanatory</b> <b>power</b> of kinetic theory, however, soon started to displace caloric and it was largely obsolete {{by the end of the}} 19th century.

25|$|According to Girard, just as {{the theory}} of natural {{selection}} of species is the rational principle that explains the immense diversity of forms of life, the victimization process is the rational principle that explains {{the origin of the}} infinite diversity of cultural forms. The analogy with Darwin also extends to the scientific status of the theory, as each of these presents itself as a hypothesis that is not capable of being proven experimentally, given the extreme amounts of time necessary to the production of the phenomena in question, but which imposes itself by its great <b>explanatory</b> <b>power.</b>|$|E
40|$|In {{the current}} {{estimation}} of a GLM model, the correlation structure of regressors {{is not used}} as the basis on which to lean strong predictive dimensions. Looking for linear combinations of regressors that merely maximize the likelihood of the GLM has two major consequences: (1) collinearity of regressors is a factor of estimation instability, and (2) as predictive dimensions may lean on noise, both predictive and <b>explanatory</b> <b>powers</b> of the model are jeopardized. For a single dependent variable, {{attempts have been made to}} adapt PLS regression, which solves this problem in the classical Linear Model, to GLM estimation. In this paper, we first discuss the methods thus developed, and then propose a technique, Supervised Component Generalized Linear Regression (SCGLR), that combines PLS regression with GLM estimation in the multivariate context. SCGLR is tested on both simulated and real data. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

This subject has assumed renewed interest in the wake of European economic and financial integration, with attempts to measure the degree of short and long-run financial integration. In this study, using a sample of ten industrial nations and emerging market nations, a comprehensive analysis is done of the influence of home and global factors on long-run bond rates. The key determinants of national long-run bond yields {{turn out to be the}} national short-run money market rates and the U. S long-run bond rate. The government debt burden also has <b>explanatory</b> <b>powers</b> in the case of the major countries in the sample.

The findings suggest that while much of the <b>explanatory</b> <b>powers</b> of main stream capital structure theories are applicable to the Jordanian companies. The empirical evidence also shows that the 1990 s liberalization did affect their financial decisions. Moreover, the findings of the paper suggest that Jordanian companies have target leverage ratios and following the financial liberalization, their speed of adjustment to these ratios have, as unexpected, decreased...|$|R
25|$|Isaac Newton's (1642–1727) {{mathematical}} {{explanation of}} universal gravitation explained the behavior both of objects {{here on earth}} and of objects in the heavens {{in a way that}} promoted a worldview in which the natural universe is controlled by laws of nature. This, in turn, suggested a theology in which God created the universe, set it in motion controlled by natural law and retired from the scene. The new awareness of the <b>explanatory</b> <b>power</b> of universal natural law also produced a growing skepticism about such religious staples as miracles (violations of natural law) and about religious books that reported them.|$|E
25|$|Psychological {{theories}} of magic treat magic {{as a personal}} phenomenon intended to meet individual needs, {{as opposed to a}} social phenomenon serving a collective purpose. The <b>explanatory</b> <b>power</b> of magic should not be underestimated, however. Both in the past and in the modern world, magical belief systems can provide explanations for otherwise difficult or impossible to understand phenomena while providing a spiritual and metaphysical grounding for the individual. Furthermore, as both Brian Feltham and Scott E. Hendrix argue, magical beliefs need not represent a form of irrationality, nor should they be viewed as incompatible with modern views of the world.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{problems}} with the original formulation of the razor is that it only applies to models with the same <b>explanatory</b> <b>power</b> (i.e., it only tells us to prefer the simplest of equally good models). A more general form of the razor can be derived from Bayesian model comparison, which is based on Bayes factors and can be used to compare models that don't fit the observations equally well. These methods can sometimes optimally balance the complexity and power of a model. Generally, the exact Occam factor is intractable, but approximations such as Akaike information criterion, Bayesian information criterion, Variational Bayesian methods, false discovery rate, and Laplace's method are used. Many artificial intelligence researchers are now employing such techniques, for instance through work on Occam Learning or more generally on the Free energy principle.|$|E

The empirical analysis is based on a new annual data set that has recently been compiled and covers the period 1830 { 2003. We apply multivariate linear and smooth transition regression models proposed by Terasvirta (1998) to capture broad trends, and take into account non-linear features of the time series. We particularly investigate and characterise the form of the relationship between output and monetary policy variables. It appears that allowance for statedependent behaviour and response to shocks increases the <b>explanatory</b> <b>powers</b> of the models and helps bring forward new aspects of the dynamic behaviour of output, the real exchange rate and real money balances.

40|$|This chapter {{looks at}} the concept of power in social work by {{focusing}} on what this means as a ‘professional’ and theorizes competing discourses of empowerment in social work and its key concepts, drawing in particular on the <b>explanatory</b> <b>powers</b> of critical theorist Michel Foucault (1991). The chapter problematizes the concept of power by explicitly drawing on both users’ and carers’ accounts from the literature to demonstrate different external and internal influences on {{the root causes of}} disempowerment. It also explores everyday issues around ‘safeguarding’ and ‘vulnerability’ in relation to how different service users are supported to make decisions about their own care and support through 2 key scenarios where some of the challenges in relation to exercising power ethically and the dilemmas faced in staying close to the values of social work in its everyday context are considered in detail...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the effects of}} inter-industry and firm size on wage differentials, focusing on how their estimated effects vary {{by the introduction of}} elements indicating firm characteristics such as wage-experience profiles. Using the worker-establishment matched data, we find that inter-industry effects are larger than firm size ones judging from their <b>explanatory</b> <b>powers</b> and the wage distributions caused by them although the introduction of firm characteristics reduces more the effect of industry. Since this paper is based on the efficiency wage hypothesis to explain wage differentials, it is required to test for the bonding critique. Checking how steeper wage profiles affect wages of young workers, we find that even those who work at firms where wage profiles are steeply rising are not paid lower. This result supports the efficiency wage hypothesis to be a good explanation for wage differentials...|$|R
