5|$|The GCD of two numbers a and b is {{the product}} of the prime factors shared by the two numbers, where a same prime factor can be used {{multiple}} times, but only as long as the product of these factors divides both a and b. For example, since 1386 can be <b>factored</b> into 2×3×3×7×11, and 3213 can be <b>factored</b> into 3×3×3×7×17, the greatest common divisor of 1386 and 3213 equals 63=3×3×7, the product of their shared prime factors. If two numbers have no prime factors in common, their greatest common divisor is 1 (obtained here as an instance of the empty product), in other words they are coprime. A key advantage of the Euclidean algorithm is that it can find the GCD efficiently without having to compute the prime factors. Factorization of large integers is believed to be a computationally very difficult problem, and the security of many widely used cryptographic protocols is based upon its infeasibility.|$|E

Empirical reconstitution (purified <b>factors</b> VIIa, X, IX, VIII, V, prothrombin, and relipidated tissue <b>factor)</b> showed that plasma concentrations of <b>factor</b> VII (10 nM) prolong the initiation phase of thrombin generation significantly at low concentrations of tissue <b>factor</b> and 100 pM <b>factor</b> VIIa.
