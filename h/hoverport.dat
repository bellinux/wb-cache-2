2500|$|The world's first car-carrying {{hovercraft}} {{was made}} in 1968, the BHC Mountbatten class (SR.N4) models, each powered by four Bristol Proteus turboshaft engines. These were both used by rival operators Hoverlloyd and Seaspeed (joined to form Hoverspeed in 1981) to operate regular car and passenger carrying services across the English Channel. Hoverlloyd operated from Ramsgate, where a special <b>hoverport</b> had been built at Pegwell Bay, to Calais. Seaspeed operated from Dover, England, to Calais and Boulogne in France. The first SR.N4 had a capacity of 254 passengers and 30 cars, and {{a top speed of}} [...] The channel crossing took around 30minutes and was run like an airline with flight numbers. The later SR.N4 Mk.III had a capacity of 418 passengers and 60 cars to the Isle of Wight. These were later joined by the French-built SEDAM N500 Naviplane with a capacity of 385 passengers and 45 cars; only one entered service and was used intermittently for a few years on the cross-channel service until returned to SNCF in 1983. The service ceased in 2000 after 32years, due to competition with traditional ferries, catamaran, the disappearance of duty-free shopping within the EU, the advancing age of the SR.N4 hovercraft and the opening of the Channel Tunnel.|$|E

40|$|The {{air-cushion}} vehicle (ACV) {{can travel}} over concrete roads, grass, sand, mud, swamp, snow, ice, and water. This mobility makes possible {{a totally new}} geographical freedom in choosing transportation routes, locating ports, and laying out a city. By the 1980 s fleets of large ACV freighters could begin carrying ocean-going cargo. The mobility of an ACV fleet would allow placing <b>hoverports</b> away from areas now crowded. New cities could rise along shallow or reef-bound seacoasts and rivers, just as cities once rose around deep-water seaports...|$|R
50|$|Since {{the closure}} of Hoverspeed in 2005, the Dover <b>Hoverport</b> had {{remained}} unused until SpeedFerries moved to the site from the Eastern Docks. They operated from the <b>hoverport</b> to Boulogne from Easter 2007 until November 2008 when SpeedFerries went into administration and their services ceased. The <b>hoverport</b> site then lay abandoned {{for the second time}} in its thirty-year history until demolition of the site began in May 2009 in preparation for the redevelopment of the Western Docks and a new Cruise Terminal. With the hoverports at Pegwell Bay and Calais also having been demolished, only Boulogne (Le Portel) <b>hoverport</b> site remains, albeit long abandoned and derelict.|$|E

50|$|The Dover-Boulogne route {{was opened}} in 1966 by Townsend Car Ferries using an SRN6 passenger-only hovercraft.

50|$|Hoverlloyd ran a {{crossing}} from Ramsgate Harbour to Calais Harbour from 6 April 1966 using small, passenger-only SR.N6 hovercraft. When {{the much}} larger SR.N4 craft, capable of carrying 30 vehicles and 254 passengers, were delivered in 1969, Hoverlloyd moved operations to a purpose built <b>hoverport</b> in Pegwell Bay, near Ramsgate.|$|E

50|$|A <b>hoverport</b> is a {{terminal}} for hovercraft, having passenger facilities where needed and infrastructure {{to allow the}} hovercraft to come on land. Today, {{only a small number}} of civilian hoverports remain, due to the relatively high fuel consumption of hovercrafts compared to traditional ferries. Military hoverports also exist however, for example in Haldia in India, from which the Indian Coast Guard operates two hovercrafts.|$|E

50|$|Haldia {{is also a}} base of Indian Coast Guard. Indian {{coast guard}} DHQ 8 (Headquarters for West Bengal) is located at haldia. There is a <b>hoverport</b> to house four of the {{eighteen}} hovercrafts belonging to the Indian Coast Guard. Indian coast guard also have pantoon jetty to berth fleet of ships. Presently two fast petrol vessels, one inshore petrol vessels, and one small craft is based at Haldia. However basing of these vessels at Haldia need to be evaluated in terms of usefulness owing to the location and time required to reach sea from Haldia. It {{is one of the}} major ports in India.|$|E
50|$|It {{was soon}} {{determined}} that Dover and Boulogne {{would be the}} preferable option for the maiden route, a decision which had been motivated {{in part by the}} local Chamber of Commerce having agreed to build a suitable <b>hoverport</b> to readily facilitate such operations. As there was no funding available for pre-service passenger trials, the opening season of active operations effectively served as a continuation of the trials activities as well. Brindle was aware that BHC would not be paid until the SR.N4 was in service, and thus there was a considerable emphasis placed on getting the craft ready for commercial use right at the point of delivery.|$|E
50|$|All four ex-Hoverlloyd craft were {{eventually}} broken up and none remains extant (the two ex-Seaspeed SR.N4 craft are stored at the Hovercraft Museum, The Princess Anne {{is going to}} be restored in its former Seaspeed livery but The Princess Margaret will be broken up. The <b>hoverport</b> at Pegwell Bay was used as an engineering and administrative base by Hoverspeed for a few years after passenger services ceased but the site was eventually closed and all buildings completely demolished. Nonetheless, the hovercraft pad, car marshalling area and approach road are all still clearly identifiable. Hoverspeed continued cross Channel hovercraft operation until October 2000, when the last two craft were retired and the era of ‘hovering across the Channel’ came to an end.|$|E

5000|$|Southsea <b>Hoverport</b> is {{adjacent}} to Clarence Pier in the Southsea area of Portsmouth in southern England. From here frequent hovercraft services leave for Ryde on the Isle of Wight. The journey time is quicker than the conventional boats that sail from Gunwharf Quay, elsewhere in Portsmouth, but the hovercraft {{are more prone}} to service curtailment in inclement weather. Another problem are connections from here as when the service first started in the mid-20th century much of the land closer to Portsmouth and Southsea station was already occupied by both residential and naval units. To help alleviate this problem Stagecoach run the [...] "Hoverbus" [...] linking the terminal with Portsmouth and Southsea station and Portsmouth city centre. The nearest railway station is Portsmouth Harbour railway station, although Portsmouth and Southsea station is not much further away.|$|E
5000|$|This part of {{the port}} is formed by the western arm of the harbour, Admiralty Pier, and its {{associated}} port facilities. It was initially used as a terminal for the Golden Arrow and other cross-channel train services (with its own railway station, Dover Marine, later renamed Dover Western Docks) - {{it was here that}} the Unknown Warrior was landed. The railway station closed in 1994. The Western Docks were also used from 1968 to the early 2000s for a cross-channel hovercraft service run by Hoverspeed. Hoverspeed also ran catamaran services until being declared bankrupt in 2005. Another catamaran service ran from 2004 until November 2008 run by the single ship of SpeedFerries, SpeedOne, with up to five services daily to Boulogne-sur-Mer. The <b>Hoverport</b> has now been demolished for re-development.|$|E
50|$|Hovercrafts used to ply {{between the}} Gateway of India in Mumbai and CBD Belapur and Vashi in Navi Mumbai between 1994 and 1999 but the {{services}} were subsequently stopped {{due to lack}} of sufficient water transport infrastructure. The services used British made hovercraft and were operated by as a joint venture between the government and Mahindra and Mahindra, an Indian conglomerate. The City and Industrial Development Corporation (CIDCO) and Maharashtra Maritime Board (MMB) floated proposals to restart hovercraft services from CBD Belapur to reduce travel time from an hour and above to under half an hour. The CIDCO developed <b>hoverport</b> in CBD Belapur was taken over by the Indian Coast Guard as an ad hoc base for providing security to water transport services till its permanent base at Nerul adjacent to Training Ship Chanakya was set up.|$|E
50|$|The {{interchange}} {{consists of}} Ryde Esplanade railway {{station on the}} Island Line, the connected bus station and taxi ranks, and the nearby <b>Hoverport.</b> The existing facilities were due to be rebuilt from October 2007. Due to financial difficulties and contract checking, it briefly looked like the project might not proceed. From late November 2008 to October 2009 {{it appeared that the}} project was back on track, with work expected to take place, albeit about 18 months later than originally planned, however, in October it was announced that due to increasing costs and difficulties with the ownership of land with Network Rail that the scheme again looked as though it would be abandoned as money could be more easily spent on making immediate improvements to Ryde Esplanade. On 13 October, the Council's cabinet voted to close the scheme.|$|E
