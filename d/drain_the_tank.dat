50|$|Demolition - The {{second day}} of rehab begins with the {{handymen}} demolishing the bathroom. This includes removing the sink and vanity, the toilet, and the shower fixtures.

50|$|During Leg 5, {{teams were}} {{required}} to drive marked vehicles more than 100 miles from Portugal to the port in Algeciras, Spain. Four of the eight teams incorrectly fueled their cars using unleaded gasoline instead of diesel, causing the cars to become inoperable. The four stricken teams handled the situation very differently: Teri and Ian recovered almost immediately when Ian borrowed a siphoning line from a gas station, <b>drained</b> <b>the</b> <b>tank,</b> and refilled with diesel; Flo and Zach oddly found an open repair shop {{in the middle of}} the night that fixed their vehicle; Aaron and Arianne called for a tow truck and were taken to a different repair place after a very long delay; and Kathy and Michael had the car brought back to the station, left it overnight, and became the last team to get underway with a fixed car (which contributed to their eventual elimination).|$|R

30|$|The {{water demand}} and the pumping station working are periodic, with 24  h cycles. Four time periods, each of 6  h {{characterize}} the network hydraulic behaviour.

50|$|Another lower-maintenance {{concept is}} the 'drain-back'. No {{anti-freeze}} is required; instead, all the piping is sloped to cause water to <b>drain</b> back to <b>the</b> <b>tank.</b> <b>The</b> <b>tank</b> is not pressurized and operates at atmospheric pressure. As {{soon as the}} pump shuts off, flow reverses and the pipes empty before freezing can occur.|$|R
40|$|A bladderless {{water tank}} (see figure) has been {{developed}} that contains capillary devices that {{allow it to be}} filled and emptied, as needed, in microgravity. When filled with water, <b>the</b> <b>tank</b> shields human occupants of a spacecraft against cosmic radiation. A membrane that is permeable by air but is hydrophobic (neither wettable nor permeable by liquid water) covers one inside surface of <b>the</b> <b>tank.</b> Grooves between <b>the</b> surface and the membrane allow air to flow through vent holes in the surface as <b>the</b> <b>tank</b> is filled or drained. A margin of wettable surface surrounds the edges of the membrane, and all <b>the</b> other inside <b>tank</b> surfaces are also wettable. A fill/drain port is located in one corner of <b>the</b> <b>tank</b> and is covered with a hydrophilic membrane. As filling begins, water runs from the hydrophilic membrane into the corner fillets of <b>the</b> <b>tank</b> walls. Continued filling in the absence of gravity will result in a single contiguous air bubble that will be vented through the hydrophobic membrane. The bubble will be reduced in size until it becomes spherical and smaller than <b>the</b> <b>tank</b> thickness. <b>Draining</b> <b>the</b> <b>tank</b> reverses <b>the</b> process. Air is introduced through the hydrophobic membrane, and liquid continuity is maintained with the fill/drain port through the corner fillets. Even after <b>the</b> <b>tank</b> is emptied, as long as the suction pressure on the hydrophilic membrane does not exceed its bubble point, no air will be drawn into the liquid line...|$|R
40|$|The {{library for}} Mathworks Simscape does not {{currently}} contain {{a model for}} a closed volume fluid <b>tank</b> where <b>the</b> ullage pressure is variable.

30|$|The {{screening}} for submergence tolerance {{was carried out}} in Nepal (Hardinath, Nepalgunj) and India (Faizabad, Madhepura, Dhangain, Patna). The protocol for the {{screening for}} submergence tolerance was as described in Dixit et al. (2017). Selected NILs were planted in the nursery beds along with Swarna, Swarna-Sub 1 and susceptible check IR 42. The field was submerged for about two weeks from 14 [*]days after seeding (DAS) to 27 [*]days after seeding and then field was <b>drained.</b> <b>The</b> final recovery was recorded seven days after draining (Dixit et al. 2017).

40|$|In {{the present}} study, {{the effect of}} {{chemical}} factors released by conspecifics on growth variability (heterogeneous growth - HetG) in a gregarious fish species (Prochilodus lineatus) was tested. HetG was assessed by the weight variation coefficient in two consecutive 21 -day periods. The fish were grouped in tanks (4 fish in each) that received running water with constant <b>draining.</b> <b>The</b> <b>tanks</b> contained either conspecifics (C) or non-conspecifics (N). Four conditions were established in accordance with <b>the</b> <b>tank</b> water supply: a) water with previous contact with conspecifics throughout the experiment (CC); b) water without previous contact with conspecifics throughout the experiment (NN); c) water with previous contact with conspecifics in just the first period, 0 to 21 days (CN); and d) just in the period from 21 to 42 days (NC). At {{the end of the}} experiments, the occurrence of chemical modulation on the growth variability in P. lineatus was verified: the fish that received water with previous contact with a conspecific (C) presented exacerbation of HetG. This corroborates the notion that the predominant mechanism in the determination of intraspecific growth variation in the gregarious species is associated to chemical factors released by conspecifics...|$|R

40|$|Preliminary design trades are {{presented}} for liquid hydrogen fuel systems for remotely-operated, high-altitude aircraft that accommodate three different propulsion options: internal combustion engines, and electric motors powered by either polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells or solid oxide fuel cells. Mission goal is sustained cruise at 60, 000 ft altitude, with duration-aloft a key parameter. The subject aircraft specifies an engine power of 143 to 148 hp, gross liftoff weight of 9270 to 9450 lb, payload of 440 lb, and a hydrogen fuel capacity of 2650 to 2755 lb stored in two spherical tanks (8. 5 ft inside diameter), {{each with a}} dry mass goal of 316 lb. Hydrogen schematics for all three propulsion options are provided. Each employs vacuum-jacketed tanks with multilayer insulation, augmented with a helium pressurant system, and using electric motor driven hydrogen pumps. The most significant schematic differences involve the heat exchangers and hydrogen reclamation equipment. Heat balances indicate that mission durations of 10 to 16 days appear achievable. The dry mass for the hydrogen system {{is estimated to be}} 1900 lb, including 645 lb for each tank.
