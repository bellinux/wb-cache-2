[...] "It <b>forces</b> <b>you</b> to be honest." [...] Nearly 400 residents have graduated from the program since its inception. Of those, close to seventy percent are reported to remain drug-free, well above the results of traditional recovery methods.|$|E

And it's also done in what now is becoming my aesthetic, which is, you know, it's part pop, part performance art, part fashion installation—so {{all of those}} things are present... It's a story, it's me battling all my monsters along the way. I'm playing all the music from The Fame, all the music from The Fame Monster. And the stage that I designed with the Haus [...] is a giant cube that sits. Imagine you were to hollow out a TV and just break the fourth wall on a TV screen. It <b>forces</b> <b>you</b> to look {{at the center of the}} TV. It's my way of saying, 'My music is art.'" ...|$|E
500|$|In December 2001, Moore further {{explained}} his opposition, citing how a reader {{can take the}} time to absorb the character backgrounds, by having the option of turning back the pages so that they can connect elements they had just read to past elements, but that film <b>forces</b> <b>you</b> to watch the story at 24 frames per second. Moore's opposition to the film adaptation crystallized after the 2003 film version of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen was released, and he intends to give any resulting royalties from Watchmen to the comic's artist, Dave Gibbons. In Moore’s opinion, Hayter’s script was the closest anyone could get to the original comic, but added {{that he would not be}} going to see the film when completed. Moore said, [...] "My book is a comic book. Not a movie, not a novel. A comic book. It's been made in a certain way, and designed to be read a certain way: in an armchair, nice and cozy next to a fire, with a steaming cup of coffee." ...|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from critics, ranging from largely positive to negative. Entertainment Weekly gave the episode an A–, calling it [...] "gorgeously shot", citing the [...] "lush, smoky gaming sequences" [...] in particular. Television Without Pity ranked [...] "Hell Money" [...] the eleventh most nightmare-inducing {{episode of the}} show noting, [...] "If there’s one thing you don’t want to mess with, it’s the Chinese mafia. Especially the branch that dresses up like Slipknot and either a) burns you alive, if you’re lucky, or b) <b>forces</b> <b>you</b> {{to participate in a}} haunted organ-harvesting raffle only to slowly carve you up and sell your vital organs on the black market, {{whether you like it or}} not." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode four stars out of five, and called it a [...] "hard episode to love [...] sincere and purposeful". The two praised the conceit of the episode, arguing that by presenting the situation from the Chinese immigrants—members of an alien culture—and Chao's point of view, [...] "Mulder and Scully seem clumsy and arrogant. And by implication, the audience are made to feel just as arrogant." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{decision}} to exert control {{in every aspect}} of production aside from mastering came from obsession. He said, [...] "I felt like, this way the album is even more my heart and soul, my blood, sweat, and tears." [...] Parker set a deadline to complete the record because of his tendency to procrastinate; he described having a deadline as [...] "a blessing in disguise because it <b>forces</b> <b>you</b> to make decisions there and then. Which in the end makes for good art." [...] Currents was due to be completed in January 2015, but the deadline was pushed back several times. Late in the process, he became self-conscious about the honesty of his lyrics. He became obsessive about minor details in the work, making him unable to wholly enjoy it upon its completion. Shortly before its release, he said, [...] "I still think this album is completely unlistenable." ...|$|E

6000|$|Your {{despatch}} of {{this morning}} to the Secretary of War is before me.

Lee is now passing the Potomac faster than the <b>forces</b> <b>you</b> mention are passing Carlisle.

60|$|I should compare Rubens to Shakspeare, for the {{wonderful}} variety and vital {{force of his}} artistic power. I know no other mind he so nearly resembles. Like Shakspeare, he <b>forces</b> <b>you</b> to accept and to forgive a thousand excesses, and uses his own faults as musicians use discords, only to enhance the perfection of harmony. There certainly is some use even in defects. A faultless style sends you to sleep. Defects rouse and excite the sensibility to seek and appreciate excellences. Some of Shakspeare's finest passages explode all grammar and rhetoric like skyrockets--the thought blows the language to shivers.|$|E

If he has any consideration for himself, or his future happiness, he will stop in time, and not be afraid of meeting the mischief which he sees follows too fast for him to escape; be not so afraid of breaking, as not to break till necessity <b>forces</b> <b>you,</b> {{and that you have}} nothing left.

60|$|General Fremont {{has been}} ordered by {{telegraph}} {{to move from}} Franklin on Harrisonburg to relieve General Banks, and capture or destroy Jackson's and Ewell's <b>forces.</b> <b>You</b> are instructed, laying aside for the present the movement on Richmond, to put 20,000 men in motion at once for the Shenandoah, moving on the line or {{in advance of the}} line of the Manassas Gap railroad. Your object will be to capture the forces of Jackson and Ewell, either in co-operation with General Fremont, or, in case want of supplies or of transportation, interferes with his movements, it is believed that the force which you move will be sufficient to accomplish this object alone. The information thus far received here makes it probable that if the enemy operate actively against General Banks, you {{will not be able to}} count upon much assistance from him, but may even have to release him. Reports received this moment are that Banks is fighting with Ewell eight miles from Winchester.|$|E
60|$|The {{instances}} of this man's magnanimity are numerous, {{and worthy of}} Alexander the Great, or Harry the Fifth, or Robin Hood. Most gentle is he, and thoughtful to the poor, and merciful to the vanquished. When Jeremy Diddler, who had lost twenty pounds at his table, lay in inglorious pawn at his inn--when O'Toole could not leave Noirbourg until he had received his remittances from Ireland--the noble Lenoir paid Diddler's inn bill, advanced O'Toole money upon his well-known signature, franked both of {{them back to their}} native country again; and has never, wonderful to state, been paid from that day to this. If you will go play at his table, you may; but nobody <b>forces</b> <b>you.</b> If you lose, pay with a cheerful heart. Dulce est desipere in loco. This is not a treatise of morals. Friar Tuck was not an exemplary ecclesiastic, nor Robin Hood a model man; but he was a jolly outlaw; and I dare say the Sheriff of Nottingham, whose money he took, rather relished his feast at Robin's green table.|$|E

Farewell, Monsieur Campbell, I have not so many friends that I can afford to lose so true and stout a one, especially one upon whom misfortunes have come through his good services to myself. I will send a messenger to the governor of Nantes with orders that he shall in every way forward your wishes as to your departure, {{as it is with}} my consent and approval that you are sailing for England. Your devotion has brought you into the gravest peril, and now it <b>forces</b> <b>you</b> to relinquish your profession, in which you have so greatly distinguished yourself. Truly, my friendship for you is genuine, and it cuts me to the heart that, although I could uphold you against the most powerful nobles in open enmity, I can do naught to save you from assassination. I trust some day that I may see you again, but, should it not be so, remember that I shall always feel myself your debtor; and should you have friends for whom you may ask my protection be sure that I will for your sake do all in my power for them." ...|$|E
