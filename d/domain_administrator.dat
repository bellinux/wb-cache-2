40|$|Several {{challenges}} come to fore while realizing collaborations among independent administrative domains in a distributed setup. Interoperability {{of access}} control models, deployed in respective collaborating domains, {{is one such}} challenge. Collaborating domains may have heterogeneous types of access control models {{that need to be}} interoperable in order to accommodate each other’s collaborating users and resources. Even, a collaboration among homogeneous access control models is not straight-forward due to the incompatible security orderings they might employ. Manageability of resulting post-collaboration domain is another challenge. Manageability and simplicity of collaboration facilitating mechanism in order to give a clear understanding of authorization flows across <b>domains</b> to <b>domain</b> <b>administrators</b> is important. The modifications to the pre-collaboration internal functionality of a domain should be at the minimum possible so that in case of an ephemeral/unsuccessful collaboration pre-collaboration functionality can be restored quickly. The privacy of collaboration agreement clauses is crucial for modern day globalized business environment of outsourcing and collaboration. We introduce a new mechanism to address all of the above challenges. Central to our mechanism is an overlay formation mechanism that allows <b>domain</b> <b>administrators</b> to map their collaborating entities into a new collaboration specific security ordering that is agreeable to the peer collaborator. Collaborators use overlays as interoperation interfaces. By digitally signing each other’s overlays, organizations enter into collaboration. Overlays are collaboration specific and are capable of capturing context of collaboration. A domain can enter into concurrent collaborations by defining separate overlays for each collaboration instance. This feature of concurrency leads us to ask interesting questions like; can visiting users of a collaborating domain take part in that domain’s other collaboration instances, if yes under what context? The facility of delegation provided under our mechanism allows a resulting postcollaboration domain to form further overlays, comprising entities from domains that constituted the post-collaboration domain, and enter into new collaborations...|$|R

The TOPAS protocol specifies how experiences and recommendations are communicated between a spam filter at each mail domain and its associated trust manager, and between trust managers of different mail servers. A technique for improving mail filtering using these trust measures is also described. Initial simulations indicate the potential of this approach to improve rates of false positives and false negatives in anti-spam systems...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Access control {{techniques}} {{designed for}} single domain infrastructures, where users are known by <b>domain</b> <b>administrators,</b> provide considerable liberty in {{the usage of}} resources. This paradigm is not suitable for highly scalable and decentralised systems such as Grids and service oriented architectures (SOA), where resources are shared between domains, and users come from remote domains. One approach is to provide policy-driven autonomic solutions that operate a continuous monitoring of the usage of resources by users. This paper presents the services and tools offered by the GridTrust Security Framework (GSF). GSF addresses three layers {{of the next generation}} of grid (NGG) architecture: the Grid application layer, the Grid service middleware layer, and the Grid foundation layer. The framework is composed of security and trust services and tools provided at the middleware and Grid foundation middleware layers. Various business case studies are being developed to validate the GridTrust results...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Database {{integration}} {{is a common}} and growing challenge {{with the proliferation of}} database systems, data warehouses, data marts, and other OLAP systems in organizations. Although there are many methods of sharing data between databases, true interoperability of database systems requires capturing, comparing, and merging the semantics of each system. In this work, we present a database integration system that improves on the database federation architecture by allowing <b>domain</b> <b>administrators</b> to simply and efficiently capture database semantics. The semantic information is combined using a tool for producing a global view. Building the global view is the bottleneck in integration because there are few tools that support its construction, and these tools often require sophisticated knowledge and experience to operate properly. The technique and tool presented is simple and powerful enough to be used by all database administrators, yet expressive enough to support the majority of integration queries. ...|$|R

This too can help in setting up filters for incoming mail. It is also not necessary to include any of dots used during the creation of the account while signing in. However, this does not work in Google Apps for Your Domain. In Apps, each username variation must be entered as a nickname by the <b>domain</b> <b>administrator.</b>|$|E
50|$|There is {{no single}} defense against the technique, thus {{standard}} defense in depth practices apply - for example use of firewalls, intrusion prevention systems, 802.1x authentication, IPsec, antivirus software, full disk encryption, {{reducing the number of}} people with elevated privileges, pro-active security patching etc. Preventing Windows from storing cached credentials may limit attackers to obtaining hashes from memory, which usually means that the target account must be logged into the machine when the attack is executed. Allowing domain administrators to log into systems that may be compromised or untrusted will create a scenario where the administrators' hashes become the targets of attackers; limiting <b>domain</b> <b>administrator</b> logons to trusted domain controllers can therefore limit the opportunities for an attacker. The principle of least privilege suggests that a least user access (LUA) approach should be taken, in that users should not use accounts with more privileges than necessary to complete the task at hand. Configuring systems not to use LM or NTLM can also strengthen security, but newer exploits are able to forward Kerberos tickets in a similar way. Limiting the scope of debug privileges on system may frustrate some attacks that inject code or steal hashes from the memory of sensitive processes.|$|E

50|$|The tool also {{introduced}} a new technique which allowed dumping password hashes cached {{in the memory of}} the lsass.exe process (not in persistent storage on disk), which quickly became widely used by penetration testers (and attackers). This hash harvesting technique is more advanced than previously used techniques (e.g. dumping the local Security Accounts Manager database (SAM) using pwdump and similar tools), mainly because hash values stored in memory could include credentials of domain users (and <b>domain</b> <b>administrators)</b> that logged into the machine. For example, the hashes of authenticated domain users that are not stored persistently in the local SAM can also be dumped. This makes it possible for a penetration tester (or attacker) to compromise a whole Windows domain after compromising a single machine that was a member of that domain. Furthermore, the attack can be implemented instantaneously and without any requirement for expensive computing resources to carry out a brute force attack.|$|R
