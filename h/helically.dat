25|$|The Timberwolf {{action is}} a {{manually}} operated stainless steel bolt action with a right-hand side bolt and ejection port. The bolt is a rotary bolt with dual front locking lugs plus one locking lug at the rear. It requires a 90-degree bolt rotation. the bolt is partly <b>helically</b> fluted which reduces weight and stops bolt debris jams. A double plunger ejector and hook type extractor are used to remove fired cartridge cases. This helps create a very smooth action which is very reliable. The extra locking lug at the rear assists in preventing the bolt from becoming jammed when chambering another round.|$|E
500|$|Each cell {{consisted}} of a wooden dowel with a bifilar winding of copper and zinc wires. [...] The dowels were <b>helically</b> grooved like a screw thread to locate the wires precisely in position. [...] This enabled the copper and zinc wires to be placed very {{close to each other}} without coming into electrical contact. [...] Insulated wires could not be used as this would interfere with the operation of the electrolyte. [...] Copper wires were inserted into the ends of the dowels to which the copper and zinc windings were soldered. [...] These end wires were either attached to, or formed into, hooks and eyes for attaching to other cells. [...] This arrangement is depicted in figure 2. [...] These attachments provided the electrical connections as well as the mechanical linkages.Lardner, pp.288-289Moritz, p.97Pulvermacher, p.2 ...|$|E
2500|$|The bracts have {{thick and}} wide woody wings {{tapering}} towards the base. They are around [...] long and [...] wide, including the wings. They are overlain by fertile scales containing one seed each, embedded {{on the upper}} surface. They are arranged <b>helically.</b> The [...] "ligules" [...] (the free tip of the fertile scale characteristic of Araucaria) are [...] wide, [...] high, and [...] long.|$|E
2500|$|The {{majority}} of ammonite species feature [...] planispiral, flat-coiled shells, but other species feature nearly straight (as in baculites) shells. [...] Still other species' shells are coiled <b>helically,</b> superficially {{like that of}} a large gastropod (as in Turrilites and Bostrychoceras). [...] Some species' shells are even initially uncoiled, then partially coiled, and finally straight at maturity (as in Australiceras). These partially uncoiled and totally uncoiled forms began to diversify mainly during {{the early part of the}} Cretaceous and are known as heteromorphs.|$|E
2500|$|The barrel for the MRSWS is a modified, heavy free {{floating}} Kreiger made barrel. It comes in 660mm (26in) standard but a 737mm (29in) custom barrel is fitted {{to the civilian}} precision hunting rifle variant, however this {{can be used on}} the military version as well. The 338 Lapua Magnum barrels are supplied with a 254mm (1 in 10inch) twist rate optimized to stabilize long, heavy very-low-drag bullets like the Sierra HPBT MatchKing and Lapua Scenar [...]338-calibre 19.44gram (300 grain) bullets. The barrels are cryogenic stress relieved and partly <b>helically</b> fluted which reduces weight whilst maintaining most of the structural strength and contains a detachable proprietary stainless steel muzzle brake that reduces the recoil.|$|E
2500|$|The tanegashima {{seems to}} have been based on snap matchlocks that were {{produced}} in Portuguese Malacca, at the armory of Malacca (a colony of Portugal since 1511). The name tanegashima came from the Japanese island (Tanegashima) where a Chinese junk with Portuguese adventurers on board was driven to anchor by a storm in 1543. The lord of the Japanese island, Tanegashima Tokitaka (1528–1579), purchased two matchlock muskets from the Portuguese and put a swordsmith to work copying the matchlock barrel and firing mechanism. The smith (Yaita) did not have much of a problem with most of the gun but [...] "drilling the barrel <b>helically</b> so that the screw (bisen bolt) could be tightly inserted" [...] was a major problem as this [...] "technique did apparently not exist in Japan until this time." [...] The Portuguese fixed their ship and left the island and only in the next year when a Portuguese blacksmith was brought back to Japan was the problem solved. Within ten years of its introduction, over 300,000 tanegashima firearms were reported to have been manufactured.|$|E

50|$|Yo-yo, pile-up, or pilewind, hoists use yo-yo type devices {{instead of}} <b>helically</b> grooved drums. The yo-yos lines are coiled into {{overlapping}} layers of cable {{in the narrow}} slots. The pile-up drum hoists are usually used in low load. As the hoists are narrower than <b>helically</b> grooved drum hoists, these {{can be used in}} the places with limited space. Pile-up drum hoists can be mounted in many locations including ceiling, floor or wall mounting. Typical applications are to have a pile-up drum hoist with many pulleys to control a batten. Since the line is piled up on itself, this type of drum hoist provides a zero fleet angle solution.|$|E

50|$|The {{length of}} the helical fiber is at a minimum when the fiber angle equals 54°44′ and is at maximum length when the fiber angle {{approaches}} 0° and 90°. Summed up, this means that <b>helically</b> arranged muscle fibers with a fiber angle greater than 54°44′ will create force for both torsion and elongation while <b>helically</b> arranged muscle fibers with a fiber angle less than 54°44′ will create force for both torsion and shortening. The fiber angle of the oblique or helical muscle layers must increase during shortening and decrease during lengthening. In addition to creating a torsional force, the oblique muscle layers will therefore create a force for elongation that may aid the transverse musculature in resisting longitudinal compression.|$|E
50|$|The basic {{forms are}} spheres (coccus) and round-ended {{cylinders}} (bacillus). But {{there may be}} others such as <b>helically</b> twisted cylinders (spirochetes), cylinders curved in one plane (Selenomonads) and unusual morphologies (such as the square Archaea Haloquadratum).
