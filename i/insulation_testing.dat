40|$|Abstract — A {{breakdown}} of the electrical insulation system causes catastrophic failure of the electrical machine and brings large process downtime losses. To determine {{the conditions of the}} stator insulation system of motor drive systems, various testing and monitoring methods have been developed. This paper presents an in-depth literature review of more than 20 existing methods, including the most common methods to assess the phase-to-ground, phase-to-phase, and turn-to-turn insulation conditions. The methods are categorized into as online and offline methods, each of which are further grouped into specific areas according to their physical nature. The paper focuses on turn-to-turn <b>insulation</b> <b>testing</b> and monitoring of low-voltage machines, which is a rapidly expanding area for both research and product development efforts.

40|$|Abstract—We {{studied the}} {{propagation}} of partial discharge pulses in a stator winding by means of measurements on a dis-mantled 35 -MW generator and found that a stator winding acts as a transmission line. Therefore, a partial-discharge (PD) signal manifests itself at the generator terminals after a transit time {{that depends on the}} location of the discharge. Due to capacitive and inductive couplings in the end-winding region, a second propagation mode is present for higher frequencies. This “fast mode ” manifests itself at the terminals without appreciable time delay. The capacitive and inductive couplings also cause crosstalk between the phases. As a consequence, a signal measured in one phase does not necessarily originate from a discharge in that phase. The amplitudes of the fast mode and, to a lesser extent, the slow mode (or transmission-line mode) are heavily damped when the discharge occurs further away from the measuring terminal. The consequence is that only discharges close to the measuring terminal can be observed. The propagation of a PD signal is not only influenced by the construction of the generator but also by its external connections.

The described approach is widely used for large generators <b>insulation</b> <b>testing</b> purposes. For sake of clarity the certain types of partial discharge phenomena in insulation of electric machines are described and explained. The contemporary FT analysis of PD pulses is based on equivalent frequency and equivalent pulse time width derived by signal processing techniques and calculations. The numerical simulation derived and experimentally derived results are compared and evaluated for each kind of PD pulses (voltage or charge pulses). Next, the high voltage (HV) device with distributed parameters connected to HV voltage source is simulated. The parameters used in the simulation correspond to one real large synchronous generator. The obtained results lead us {{to the conclusion that}} the processing of the strain of PD charge pulses gives much more accurate results than the processing of the strain of PD voltage pulses. The experiment conducted on a large hydro generator confirmed the previous conclusions. At a same time, the sources of recorded results dispersion are shown and explained...|$|E
40|$|Presented in {{the paper}} are results of water treeing tests on theinsulation of unaged, {{cross-linked}} polyethylene cable which has been thermally preoxidized to levels typical of those measured in field aged cable insulations {{after several years of}} service. The tests showed that moderate levels of oxidation present in the insulation prior to voltage aging have no significant effect on initiation and growth of vented water trees. However preoxidized specimens grew fewer and shorter bow-tie trees than non-preoxidized specimens. <b>Insulation</b> <b>tested</b> at a lower electric stress exhibited larger retention of the initial breakdown strength after aging than the <b>insulation</b> <b>tested</b> at a higher stress even though the lengths of the water trees were comparable for both insulations. For all preoxidation conditions water treeing caused some depletion of the antioxidant from the insulation. Non-preoxidized specimens did not show any excess of oxidation with time of electrical aging even after development of very heavy treeing. However preoxidized samples did show increasing oxidation inside water treed regions as compared with electrically unaged specimens. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study was}} to explore the feasibility of confocal laser Raman spectroscopy (CLRS) for assessing the aging condition of oil-paper insulation. Oil-paper insulation samples were subjected to thermal accelerated ageing at 120 °C for up to 160 days according to the procedure described in the IEEE Guide. Meanwhile, the dimension of the Raman spectrum of the insulation oil was reduced by principal component analysis (PCA). The 160 oil-paper insulation samples were divided into five aging stages as training samples by clustering analysis and with the use of the degree of polymerization of the insulating papers. In addition, the features of the Raman spectrum were used as the inputs of a multi-classification support vector machine.

While large efforts have been expended on studying, bounding, and modeling the orbital performance of the insulation systems, little effort has been expended on the ground hold and ascent phases of a mission. Historical cryogenic in-space systems that have flown {{have been able to}} ignore these phases of flight due to the insulation system being within a vacuum jacket.

Testing was attempted with both gaseous nitrogen (GN 2) and gaseous helium (GHe) backfills. The initial tests with nitrogen backfill were not successfully completed due to nitrogen liquefaction and solidification preventing the rapid pumpdown of the vacuum chamber. Subsequent helium backfill tests were successful and showed minimal degradation. The results are compared to the historical data...|$|E
