We then explain the problem <b>of</b> <b>enlargements</b> <b>of</b> filtrations: how are (semi) martingales affected under a change of filtrations? We state the main theorems in the classical frameworks of initial and progressive <b>enlargements</b> <b>of</b> filtrations. In the case <b>of</b> initial <b>enlargements</b> <b>of</b> filtrations, we state the well known Jacod's condition and in the framework <b>of</b> progressive <b>enlargements</b> <b>of</b> filtrations, we give the decomposition of a local martingale in the larger filtration. We finally specialize to the case of immersed filtrations, which is very widely used in credit risk modeling, and study the effect of a combination of changes of filtration and probability measure in this situation...|$|R

5|$|Despite the pursued aim of pan-Germanic unification, {{the primary}} goal of the German Reich’s {{territorial}} expansionism was to acquire sufficient Lebensraum (living space) in Eastern Europe for the Germanic übermenschen or superior men. The primary objective of this aim was to transform Germany into a complete economic autarky, the end-result of which would be a state of continent-wide German hegemony over Europe. This was to be accomplished through the <b>enlargement</b> <b>of</b> the territorial base of the German state and the expansion of the German population, and the wholesale extermination of the indigenous Slavic inhabitants and the Germanisation of Baltic inhabitants.|$|E

We combine this characterization with some arguments from both initial and progressive <b>enlargements</b> <b>of</b> filtrations to establish some path decomposition results, closely related to or reminiscent of Williams' path decomposition results. In particular, some of the fragments of the paths in our decompositions end or start with a new family of random times which are not stopping times, nor honest times...|$|R
