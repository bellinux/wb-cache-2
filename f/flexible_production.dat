One unorganised group, roadside hawkers, generated business worth [...] 8,772crore ( [...] 2billion) in 2005. , around 0.81% of the city's workforce was employed in the primary sector (agriculture, forestry, mining, etc.); 15.49% worked in the secondary sector (industrial and manufacturing); and 83.69% worked in the tertiary sector (service industries). , the majority of households in slums were engaged in occupations belonging to the informal sector; 36.5% were involved in servicing the urban middle class (as maids, drivers, etc.), and 22.2% were casual labourers. About 34% of the available labour force in Kolkata slums were unemployed. [...] According to one estimate, {{almost a quarter of}} the population live on less than 27 rupees (equivalent to 45 US cents) per day. As in many other Indian cities, information technology became a high-growth sector in Kolkata starting in the late 1990s; the city's IT sector grew at 70% per annum—a rate that was twice the national average. The 2000s saw a surge of investments in the real estate, infrastructure, retail, and hospitality sectors; several large shopping malls and hotels were launched. , Kolkata, with an estimated gross domestic product (GDP) by purchasing power parity of 150 billion dollars, ranked third among South Asian cities, after Mumbai and Delhi. Kolkata's GDP in 2014 was Rs 1.84 trillion, according to a collaborative assessment by multiple universities and climate agencies.|$|E

40|$|The {{paradox of}} the energy {{transition}} is that, because of the low marginal costs of new renewable energy sources (RES), it drags electricity prices down and discourages investments in <b>flexible</b> <b>productions</b> that are needed {{to compensate for the}} lack of dispatchability of the new RES - the energy transition discourages the investments that are required for its own harmonious expansion. To investigate how this paradox can be overcome, we argue that future electricity prices can be accurately modeled from the residual load obtained by subtracting the sum of inflexible productions from the load. Armed with the resulting quantitative economic indicator, we investigate future revenues for power plants with various degree of flexibility under different scenarios for the energy transition in the European power grid. We find that <b>flexible</b> <b>productions</b> will be financially rewarded better and sooner if the energy transition proceeds faster but at more or less constant total production, i. e. by reducing the production of thermal power plants {{at the same rate as}} the production of RES increases. Less <b>flexible</b> <b>productions,</b> on the other hand, will see their revenue grow more moderately. Our results advocate for a faster energy transition with a quicker withdrawal of baseload thermal power plants. Comment: 11 pages, 10 figures and 2 table...|$|R

40|$|The {{share of}} {{electricity}} produced from renewable energy is constantly increasing in Germany and worldwide. The transformation to an electricity {{system based on}} renewable sources is characterised by an increasing need for balancing power in order to compensate power supply from fluctuating sources, such as solar or wind.

A demand-driven biogas production is vital for balancing power generation and can generally be achieved by biogas storing or <b>flexible</b> biogas <b>production</b> concepts. This study analyses and reviews both concepts regarding their ability to facilitate a biogas supply for short-term and long-term balancing power generation. Results show that a demand-driven biogas supply based on a biogas storing concept is, due to the fast availability of biogas (i. e. biomethane), suitable for the generation of positive secondary and tertiary balancing power. Whereas, long -term balancing power can be provided by <b>flexible</b> biogas <b>production</b> as well as by biomethane, which was injected and stored in the natural gas grid.
