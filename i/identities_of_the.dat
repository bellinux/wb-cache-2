5|$|Modern {{proponents of}} social trinitarianism often {{claim to have}} been {{influenced}} by the Cappadocians' dynamic picture of the Trinity. However, it would be fundamentally incorrect to identify Gregory as a social Trinitarian, as his theology emphasises the unity of God's will, and he clearly believes that the <b>identities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Trinity are the three persons, not the relations between them.|$|E

All young men from (typically rural) working and middle-class backgrounds, none had university degrees; in this way they were distinct from the wealthy, highly educated conservatives who previously governed the country.|$|E

Wyatt testified that he had other motives for his plan, as well; he hoped that arresting the murderers would boost his chances for election as Cochise County sheriff. Wyatt told the court that he had taken the extra step of obtaining a second copy of a telegram for Ike from Wells Fargo assuring that the reward for capturing the killers applied either dead or alive.|$|E

40|$|This project aims to {{investigate}} a correlation between everyday lies in the social context and <b>the</b> <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> liar. It explores the influence lying can have on <b>the</b> <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> liar/sender <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lie and how one intentionally can use lying in the everyday life to conceal potential stigmatising information about oneself. The theorists employed on <b>the</b> subject <b>of</b> lying are <b>the</b> psychologist Paul Ekman and philosopher Sissela Bok. We have furthermore included psychologist Carsten René Jørgensen and sociologist Erving Goffman on <b>the</b> areas <b>of</b> <b>identity</b> and stigma respectively. The analysis is based on three made-up and stereotypical examples with <b>the</b> purpose <b>of</b> investigating different outcomes of different lies {{and their impact on}} <b>the</b> <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> liar/sender with the conceptual framework from the theory adapted to <b>the</b> field <b>of</b> research. <b>The</b> study discusses the results from the analysis and proposes a possible connection between lying in everyday life and <b>the</b> <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> liar/sender. The paper concludes that lies can be used to either maintain or develop <b>the</b> <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> liar/sender. On the other hand, lying can make the liar/sender seem less trustworthy in <b>the</b> eyes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> receiver(s) and challenge <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> liar/sender...|$|R
5|$|Frawley, {{who also}} served as cinematographer for the film, had a relaxed {{approach}} to making films; he did not use screenplays and never numbered the scenes. During the assembling of Frawley's films, the sole material for editors to rely on was a pad with notes scrawled in it. The <b>identities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cast of The Bold Bank Robbery are unrecorded. The film, silent and shot in black-and-white, was filmed in Philadelphia. It was shot using a camera that company creator Siegmund Lubin had built back in 1901.|$|E

5|$|Odaenathus {{observed}} all due formalities {{towards the}} emperor, {{but in practice}} ruled as an independent monarch. In 266, the king launched a second invasion of Persia but had to abandon the campaign and head north to Bithynia to repel the attacks of Germanic riders besieging the city of Heraclea Pontica. He was assassinated in 267 during or immediately after the Anatolian campaign, together with Hairan. The <b>identities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> perpetrator or the instigator are unknown and many stories, accusations and speculations exist in ancient sources. He was succeeded by his son Vaballathus under the regency of his widow Zenobia, who used the power established by Odaenathus to forge the Palmyrene Empire in 270.|$|E

5|$|The two {{possible}} stacked forms differ in which pairs {{of the arms}} are stacked with each other; {{which of the two}} dominates is highly dependent on the base sequences nearest to the junction. Some sequences result in an equilibrium between the two conformers, while others strongly prefer a single conformer. In particular, junctions containing the sequence A-CC bridging the junction point appear to strongly prefer the conformer that allows a hydrogen bond to form between the second cytosine and one of the phosphates at the junction point. While most studies have focused on the <b>identities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> four bases nearest to the junction on each arm, it is evident that bases farther out can also affect the observed stacking conformations.|$|E
5|$|There is {{considerable}} {{uncertainty about the}} <b>identities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Grand Dukes of Lithuania between Traidenis' death in 1282 and Vytenis' assumption of power in 1295. This is {{in part because the}} two main sources for Lithuanian history in the 13th century, the Hypatian Codex and the Livonian Rhymed Chronicle, end in the early 1290s. In 1285, one chronicle mentions Daumantas as Grand Duke. He attacked the Bishop of Tver and was severely wounded or even killed in the battle. However, that is the only information about him.|$|E

She had initially identified only Catherine Campbell and Agnes Naismith, but as time wore on she implicated others, and eventually 35 were accused.
