When a regency is necessary, the next {{qualified}} individual in the line of succession automatically becomes regent, unless they themselves are a minor or incapacitated. Special provisions were made for Queen Elizabeth II by the Regency Act 1953, which stated that the Duke of Edinburgh (the Queen's husband) could act as regent in these circumstances.|$|E

5|$|Agents raid Modell's apartment, {{but find}} it empty. They find cans of protein drinks in the {{refrigerator}} and medicine for epilepsy. Mulder suspects that a brain tumor has given Modell his psychokinetic ability, but that using his power <b>is</b> <b>physically</b> exhausting, forcing him to constantly consume the energy drinks. Mulder believes that he is dying and wants {{to go out in}} a blaze of glory. Modell makes a taunting phone call to Agent Burst and causes him to have a fatal heart attack while they try to trace him. The agents track Modell down to a hospital, where he has compelled a guard to shoot an MRI technician and kill himself. Mulder ventures inside the hospital and is captured by Modell.|$|E

5|$|Early Reformed theologians such as John Calvin and Huldrych Zwingli {{rejected}} the medieval belief in transubstantiation, that {{the bread and}} wine of the Eucharist change into Christ's body and blood, but taught that Christ's person, including his body and blood, are presented to Christians who partake of it in faith. They also disagree with Martin Luther and the Lutheran tradition which taught that Christ's body <b>is</b> <b>physically</b> eaten with the mouth in the sacrament. Later Reformed orthodox theologians continued to teach views {{similar to that of}} Calvin and Zwingli. In the modern period, Karl Barth espoused a symbolic view that the sacrament only communicates God's promises rather than functioning to actually confer these promises. Other Reformed theologians continued to teach the traditional view.|$|E

5|$|Main {{memory in}} a {{parallel}} computer is either shared memory (shared between all processing elements in a single address space), or distributed memory (in which each processing element has its own local address space). Distributed memory refers {{to the fact that}} the memory is logically distributed, but often implies that it <b>is</b> <b>physically</b> distributed as well. Distributed shared memory and memory virtualization combine the two approaches, where the processing element has its own local memory and access to the memory on non-local processors. Accesses to local memory are typically faster than accesses to non-local memory.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} is outdoor learning. Program leaders believe that the outdoors environment provides a context for learning that <b>is</b> <b>physically</b> demanding and entirely different from that experienced every day at home and in school. The outdoors stimulates new ways of thinking and approaching both task- and group-related problems. As participants learn they can exceed what they perceive to be their physical limits, they find their mental capacity also grows. White Stag uses the physical environment to tire the individual and open their minds to new ways of thinking. The program does nothing indoors that can be done outdoors, and encourages physical fitness through outdoor activities. Using the outdoors avoids the negative association of a standard classroom environment.|$|E
5|$|Portrait of Monsieur Bertin is an 1832 oil-on-canvas {{painting}} by Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres. It depicts Louis-François Bertin (1766–1841), the French writer, art collector {{and director of}} the pro-royalist Journal des débats. Ingres completed the portrait during his first period of success; having achieved acclaim as a history painter, he accepted portrait commissions with reluctance, regarding them as a distraction from more important work. Bertin was a friend and a politically active member of the French upper-middle class. Ingres presents him as a personification of the commercially minded leaders of the liberal reign of Louis Philippe I. He <b>is</b> <b>physically</b> imposing and self-assured, but his real-life personality shines through– warm, wry and engaging to those who had earned his trust.|$|E

40|$|Purpose : Although {{physical}} activity and exercise for stroke patients is highly recommended for fast recovery, patients in hospitals and rehabilitation centres are insufficiently encouraged to <b>be</b> <b>physically</b> active. In this study, we investigated the impact of knowledge brokers (KBs), enterprising nurses and therapists, on health professionals’ (HP) performance to encourage stroke inpatients to <b>be</b> <b>physically</b> active.   Method : This multicenter intervention study used a pre–post test design. Two or three KBs were trained in each stroke unit of 12 hospitals and 10 rehabilitation centres in The Netherlands. Questionnaires were completed by patients and HPs {{before and after the}} KB-intervention. The primary outcome was encouragement given by HPs to their patients to <b>be</b> <b>physically</b> active, as reported by patients and HPs.   Results : After the KB-intervention, many more patients (48 %; N= 217) reported at least some encouragement by HPs to <b>be</b> <b>physically</b> active than before (26 %; N= 243, p< 0. 000). HPs (N= 288) on an average reported encouraging patients more often after the intervention, but this difference was significant only for occupational therapists and KBs.   Conclusions : Based on patient’s reports of HP behaviour, the KB-intervention appears effective since more patients felt encouraged to <b>be</b> <b>physically</b> active after the intervention compared to before. Replication of this study in an experimental design is needed to allow causal inferences. Implications for rehabilitation We advise rehabilitation teams to make use of knowledge brokers (KBs), since the KB-intervention was shown to increase the encouragement felt by stroke patients to <b>be</b> <b>physically</b> active. It seems worthwhile to involve physicians, nurses and patients’ families more frequently in efforts to encourage stroke patients to <b>be</b> <b>physically</b> active...|$|R

5|$|Regarded {{as one of}} {{the best}} players in the world in his {{position}} during his prime, Evra is a fast, energetic and athletic left back, who, despite his size, <b>is</b> <b>physically</b> strong, and good in the air, which also allows him to be deployed as a centre-back on occasion; in addition to his physical attributes, he is also comfortable on the ball and adept at getting into attacking positions as a wing-back, where he can deliver crosses to teammates, having functioned as a winger earlier on in his career. An aggressive, tactically intelligent, versatile and hard-working player, he is also renowned for his leadership and tenacity on the pitch. These attributes make him effective both offensively and defensively.|$|E
5|$|Space itself {{possesses}} symmetry. It {{looks the}} same no matter how one rotates it, and the resulting rotational symmetry {{is referred to as}} isotropy of space. In the present case it is common to use passive rotations, meaning that the observer rotates themself. Mathematically, the active operation of a rotation is performed by multiplying position vectors by a rotation matrix. A passive rotation is accomplished by rotating only the basis vectors of the coordinate system. (The coordinate system {{can be thought of as}} being fixed in the rotated observer. The observer <b>is</b> <b>physically</b> rotated.) In this way, every point in space obtains new coordinates as if it was somehow physically rigidly rotated.|$|E
5|$|The Eriskay Pony {{developed}} in the Hebrides, a group of western isles in Scotland. The origins of the breed are ancient, with roots in Celtic and Norse breeding. It <b>is</b> <b>physically</b> similar to drawings of ponies on ancient Pictish stones found in north and west Scotland. It is related to other northern breeds, including the Icelandic horse and the Faroe pony. The Eriskay {{takes its name from}} the island of Eriskay in the Outer Hebrides. Originally, the breed had a fairly large population, and until the mid-19th century the Eriskay and similar ponies were found throughout the western islands of Scotland. They were used as crofters' ponies, as pack animals, for light draught and as mounts for children.|$|E

5|$|The {{river otter}} <b>is</b> <b>physically</b> well-equipped for aquatic life. The ears are short, the neck {{is the same}} {{diameter}} as the head, the legs are short and powerful, the toes are fully webbed, and the tail (one-third of body length) is tapered. These qualities give the river otter a streamlined profile in water, but reduce agility on land. The smell and hearing abilities of the river otter are acute. The otter has a delicate sense of touch in the paws in addition to great dexterity. River otters characteristically approach within {{a few feet of}} a boat or a person on shore because they're near-sighted, a consequence of vision adapted for underwater sight. River otters have transparent nictitating membranes to protect their eyes while swimming.|$|E
5|$|The {{station at}} Brattøra has had four names, {{following}} the name {{changes of the}} city.

The station at Brattøra <b>is</b> <b>physically</b> divided in two parts by the bridge over Ravnkloa. From 1884, the western part was officially called Throndhjem V and the eastern part Throndhjem Ø. The freight station for the Røros Line was located at Throndhjem V, while the passenger station for both lines was located at Throndhjem Ø, just like today. While there were two stations in 1882–84, they were 'probably' referred to as Brattøra and Kalvskinnet.|$|E
40|$|Obese {{children}} are usually less active than their normal-weight counterparts, although {{the reasons for}} this remain unclear. The objective {{of the present study was}} to determine how a long-term program (3 years of intervention and 6 months of follow-up detraining) of physical exercise with or without a low calorie diet influenced sedentary obese children’s intention to <b>be</b> <b>physically</b> active. The participants were 27 children, ages from 8 to 11 years, who formed two groups according to the program that they followed. One group followed an exercise program (three 90 -min sessions per week), and the other this same exercise program together with a hypocaloric diet. The intention to <b>be</b> <b>physically</b> active <b>was</b> assessed via the Measurement of Intention to <b>be</b> <b>Physically</b> Active (MIFA) questionnaire. The subjects’ scores at different times of the program (baseline, Year 3, and detraining) were compared using a repeated-measures ANOVA, and a post-hoc Tukey’s test was applied to confirm the differences. After both the intervention and detraining, both groups showed greater intention to <b>be</b> <b>physically</b> active. This suggests the suitability of long-term physical exercise to generate greater intention to <b>be</b> <b>physically</b> active and thus establish healthy life habits including increased levels of physical activity...|$|R
