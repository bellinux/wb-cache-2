30|$|After {{determining}} the basic coefficients of the MC model, we must determine the coefficients of the CAPM model. To ensure {{the consistency of}} the data, before predicting the CAPM model coefficients, we still use the <b>historical</b> <b>quarterly</b> <b>data</b> in DataStream as sample data although the calculation method will slightly differ. The stock returns rate and the current stock price are directly substituted in the one-way linear regression model. When the company's stock is subjected to a linear regression model, we calculate the average value of all the companies in the industry to obtain the industry model coefficient.|$|E

40|$|This paper derives closed-form {{solutions}} for different financial {{assets in the}} Monetized Real Business Cycle Economy. The solution {{is based on the}} log-linear approximation framework. The paper reexamines the equity premium, dynamics of risk-free rate, pricing of real and nominal risk-less bonds and Fisher Hypothesis. Because of non-separable preferences of consumption and real money balances in the utility, the equity premium puzzle can be explained for empirically reasonable values of relative risk aversion parameter. I show that in the economy, which is subject to both technological and monetary shocks, the dynamics of various financial assets is driven by both shocks. Special cases of permanent and transitory shocks are considered. Equity premia is calibrated to the <b>quarterly</b> <b>historical</b> US <b>data.</b> The results suggest that Monetized Real Business Cycle Model has an advantage over Real Business Cycle Model with respect to explaining key asset market facts...|$|R
