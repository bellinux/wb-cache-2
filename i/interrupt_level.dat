25|$|The CPU recognizes seven {{interrupt}} levels. Levels 1 through 5 {{are strictly}} prioritized. That is, a higher-numbered interrupt can always interrupt a lower-numbered interrupt. In the status register, a privileged instruction {{allows one to}} set the current minimum <b>interrupt</b> <b>level,</b> blocking lower or equal priority interrupts. For example, if the <b>interrupt</b> <b>level</b> in the status register is set to 3, higher levels from 4 to 7 can cause an exception. Level 7 is a level triggered Non-maskable interrupt (NMI). Level 1 can be interrupted by any higher level. Level 0 means no interrupt. The level is stored in the status register, and is visible to user-level programs.|$|E
25|$|The CPU, {{and later}} the whole family, {{implements}} two levels of privilege. User mode gives access to everything except privileged instructions such as <b>interrupt</b> <b>level</b> controls. Supervisor privilege gives access to everything. An interrupt always becomes supervisory. The supervisor bit is stored in the status register, and is visible to user programs.|$|E
50|$|The {{advantage}} of using serialized interrupts over the traditional mechanism {{is that only}} the single SERIRQ line is necessary (apart from the clock, which is present anyway), not a line for each <b>interrupt</b> <b>level.</b>|$|E

50|$|Rapid context {{switching}} was {{a design}} objective. The register file {{is divided into}} four sections. The three commonly used <b>interrupt</b> <b>levels</b> and the background level have distinct sets of registers. Therefore, entry into most <b>interrupt</b> <b>levels</b> does not require saving the registers of the interrupted program. The infrequently used level which processed program and hardware errors shares registers with the next highest level and thus has to save and restore registers.|$|R

50|$|A {{very common}} method in {{embedded}} systems is to manually schedule jobs. This can for example {{be done in}} a time-multiplexed fashion.

5000|$|The Viatron CPUs {{differed}} in memory size and <b>interrupt</b> <b>levels</b> [...] - [...] 2 on the 2140 and 4 on the 2150. They {{had the ability}} to operate on 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit, or 48-bit data. Three index registers were provided.|$|R

50|$|As {{initially}} {{introduced the}} Level 6 {{consisted of three}} models: the 6/06, the 6/34, and the 6/36. The CPU featured a real-time clock, a ROM bootstrap loader and 64 <b>interrupt</b> <b>levels.</b> The architecture provided a variety of addressing modes and 18 programmer-visible registers. Rack-mount and tabletop versions were available.|$|R
50|$|The main signal pins on an 8259 are as follows: eight {{interrupt}} input request lines named IRQ0 through IRQ7, an {{interrupt request}} output line named INTR, interrupt acknowledgment line named INTA, D0 through D7 for communicating the <b>interrupt</b> <b>level</b> or vector offset. Other connections include CAS0 through CAS2 for cascading between 8259s.|$|E
50|$|This {{instruction}} is sensitive {{because it allows}} access to the entire status register, which includes not only the condition codes but also the user/supervisor bit, <b>interrupt</b> <b>level,</b> and trace control. In most later family members, starting with the MC68010, the MOVE from SR instruction was made privileged, and a new MOVE from CCR instruction was provided to allow access to the condition code register only.|$|E
50|$|Most {{processors}} include store {{operations that}} are not atomic with respect to memory. These include multiple words stores and string operations. Should a high priority interrupt occur when {{a portion of the}} store is complete, the operation must be completed when the <b>interrupt</b> <b>level</b> is returned. The routine that processes the interrupt must not access the memory being changed. It is important to take this into account when writing interrupt routines.|$|E
5000|$|... level 3 is {{used for}} the process {{rescheduling}} interrupt. Any code executing at higher <b>interrupt</b> <b>levels</b> is not allowed to assume that there was a current process context (since a process reschedule might be in progress).

5000|$|Windows maps {{not only}} {{hardware}} <b>interrupt</b> <b>levels</b> to its internal interrupt table, but also maps software interrupts. The mappings in this table are called <b>Interrupt</b> Request <b>Levels,</b> or IRQLs, {{and a separate}} IRQL is kept for each processor in a multiprocessor system. The IRQL values are specific to the x86, IA64 and AMD64 processor architectures that Windows can run on, though theoretically they can support other CPUs that use a similar interrupt scheme (such as the DEC Alpha and MIPS, which were supported briefly on early versions of Windows). What this essentially means is that APCs (Asychronous procedure calls), user threads and kernel mode operations can be interrupted and the system must run them at an IRQL lower than the thread scheduler (or [...] "dispatcher").|$|R
50|$|Control of <b>interrupt</b> <b>level</b> {{was also}} used to {{synchronize}} access to kernel data structures. Thus, the level-3 scheduler interrupt handler would temporarily raise IPL to 7 before accessing any actual scheduler data structures, then lower back to 3 before actually switching process contexts. However, it was not allowed for an interrupt handler to lower IPL below that at which it was entered, since to do so could destroy {{the integrity of the}} synchronization system.|$|E
50|$|The storage {{word length}} is 16 bits. The {{registers}} {{have the same}} width as the address bus. Their length varies between 16, 18 and 20 bits depending {{on the amount of}} storage installed. A particular <b>interrupt</b> <b>level</b> has eight registers. Register zero is the program counter which gave the address of the next instruction to be executed; the other seven are accumulators. The four odd-numbered accumulators can be addressed as eight single-byte accumulators.|$|E
5000|$|The {{processor}} {{was designed}} and manufactured by Motorola (now Freescale). It featured an 8-bit data length, a 10-bit instruction length and a 13-bit address length. The address space was [...] "paged", meaning you could not directly address all of the address space without special instructions. There were 4 pages. Page 0 was for normal (background) code. Page 1 was for interrupt code. Page 2 was also for background, but could only be accessed by a special [...] "Jump Page" [...] instruction from page 0. Page 3 was used to store parameteric ("calibration") data or additional <b>interrupt</b> <b>level</b> code. This chip was never sold commercially. Like EEC-I and -II, all code was written in assembly language.|$|E
5000|$|The MAC-16 was {{designed}} to support various high-performance military and civilian roles, and thus spent {{a considerable amount of}} time on guaranteeing high speed context switching to support real-time computing. A switch to and from an interrupt handler took only 2 cycles. As the original MAC-16 operated with a 1 Î¼S cycle time, Lockheed advertised the machine with the slogan [...] "In by 12:34:45.000000, out by 12:34:45.000002". The system featured 64 <b>interrupt</b> <b>levels,</b> allowing considerable flexibility in software design.|$|R
50|$|The Intel 8259 is a Programmable Interrupt Controller (PIC) {{designed}} for the Intel 8085 and Intel 8086 microprocessors. The initial part was 8259, a later A suffix version was upward compatible and usable with the 8086 or 8088 processor. The 8259 combines multiple interrupt input sources into a single interrupt output to the host microprocessor, extending the <b>interrupt</b> <b>levels</b> available in a system beyond {{the one or two}} levels found on the processor chip. The 8259A was the interrupt controller for the ISA bus in the original IBM PC and IBM PC AT.|$|R

50|$|The IBM 1132 printer {{relied on}} the 1130 {{processor}} rather than internal logic to determine when to fire the print wheels as they rotated. Printers for the Model 4 ran more slowly, but the slower processor still could {{not keep up with}} it. The hardware manual disclosed that when the Model 4 was servicing the two highest-level interrupts (the level 0 card-reader column interrupt or the level 1 printer interrupt), it ran at the faster 3.6 Âµs cycle time. Some users of the Model 4 would write a phony printer driver that did not dismiss the printer interrupt, in order to benefit from the higher processor speed. However, lower-level interrupts were disabled during this interval, even the end-of-card <b>interrupt</b> (<b>level</b> 4) from the 1442 card reader.|$|E
50|$|In all {{versions}} of Cisco IOS, packet routing and forwarding (switching) are distinct functions. Routing and other protocols run as Cisco IOS processes {{and contribute to}} the Routing Information Base (RIB). This is processed to generate the final IP forwarding table (FIB, Forwarding Information Base), which is used by the forwarding function of the router. On router platforms with software-only forwarding (e.g., Cisco 7200) most traffic handling, including access control list filtering and forwarding, is done at <b>interrupt</b> <b>level</b> using Cisco Express Forwarding (CEF) or dCEF (Distributed CEF). This means IOS does not have to do a process context switch to forward a packet. Routing functions such as OSPF or BGP run at the process level. In routers with hardware-based forwarding, such as the Cisco 12000 series, IOS computes the FIB in software and loads it into the forwarding hardware (such as an ASIC or network processor), which performs the actual packet forwarding function.|$|E
50|$|The {{most widely}} used {{operating}} system for the 1130 was the Disk Monitor System Version 2 (DM2) introduced in 1967. DM2 was a single-task batch-oriented system. It required a system with at least 4 KB of core memory and one integrated 2310 disk drive for system residence. The Supervisor was tiny by modern standards, containing assorted system details such as first-level interrupt routines, called <b>Interrupt</b> <b>Level</b> Subroutines, plus the disk driver and routines to load the interpreter of job control commands and the card reader driver. Device drivers for other I/O devices required by a job were incorporated {{as part of the}} loading of that job, which might also include the replacement of the basic disk driver by a more advanced driver. During the execution of a job, only a resident monitor, called the Skeleton Supervisor resided in memory. This Supervisor required just 1020 bytes, so a task's first available memory started with address /01FE (hexadecimal) or word 510. When the job ended or was aborted, the Supervisor loaded the Monitor Control Record Analyzer (MCRA) to read the job control for the next. While the job was running, the Supervisor was inactive. Aside from device drivers and interrupt processing all CPU time was entirely devoted to the job's activities. Other programs distributed as part of the operating system were a core dump utility, DUMP, and the Disk Utility Program, DUP.|$|E

The local computer network based on essential communication support of DMA transfer to unburden application host processor from network overhead is presented. The communication overhead on higher <b>interrupt</b> <b>levels</b> of CPU (which are important {{to be available to}} process control tasks) is minimized to several percent of CPU throughput. All network activities are easily processed by the host (application) processor, no additional communication coprocessor is required. Communication APIs are simple and user friendly...|$|R
50|$|Since the ISA bus {{does not}} support <b>level</b> {{triggered}} <b>interrupts,</b> <b>level</b> triggered mode {{may not be used}} for interrupts connected to ISA devices. This means that on PC/XT, PC/AT, and compatible systems the 8259 must be programmed for edge triggered mode. On MCA systems, devices use <b>level</b> triggered <b>interrupts</b> and the interrupt controller is hardwired to always work in level triggered mode. On newer EISA, PCI, and later systems the Edge/Level Control Registers (ELCRs) control the mode per IRQ line, effectively making the mode of the 8259 irrelevant for such systems with ISA buses. The ELCR is programmed by the BIOS at system startup for correct operation.|$|R
