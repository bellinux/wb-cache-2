25|$|Commerce and Industry: Indian {{authorities}} have notified all 57 signatories of bilateral investment protection treaties (BIT) that the agreements will lapse on 31 March 2017 unless renegotiated {{based upon a}} revised model BIT framework developed by the Government of India. The move followed international arbitration proceedings initiated by foreign investors who sued for discrimination citing preferential trade commitments by India to other countries within existing Bilateral Investment Promotion and Protection Agreements (BIPAs). Commerce Minister Nirmala Sitharaman downplayed the importance of BITs: “We don’t <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>BIT</b> with many countries (like the US).

25|$|While lucrative, the {{revenues}} realized {{from the three}} factories should not be overemphasized: while the Medici often had invested more than 7,900 gold florins in the three factories in 1458, for example, the sum invested in banks in 1458 was more than 28,800and that figure is low, for it excludes the Rome branch serving the Pope, the Medici's interest-bearing deposits in their branches, and also omits any accounting of several years' profit which were inaccessible (since the relevant partnerships {{had not yet been}} dissolved; this may seem to be a flaw in the system, but it built up capital in a branch and allowed it to lend out more than it had been incorporated with). Part of the reason for maintaining these factories when the funds could have been more profitably invested in the banks or trade could have been social: it seems to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of a Florentine tradition to run such factories to provide employment for the poora social obligation, as it were.|$|E

My faith has been good to me in the moments of deepest suffering, doubt and fear. It is a constant, the language of prayer... I might not have got my sums right from the Christian Brothers or might not have got the greatest learning of literature from them but I certainly got a strapping amount of faith." [...] Brosnan attends Mass, but adheres to other spiritual beliefs. In 2008 he said [...] "I also love the teachings of Buddhist philosophy. It's my own private faith.

While former Norway international Jan Åge Fjørtoft was supportive of the transfer to Real Madrid due to the opportunity to learn from Zidane, he warned that at the age of 16 he needed time to develop: [...] "Comparing Ødegaard to Messi is nonsense from the media. Messi is a player who can make the difference and Martin can do the same, but any comparisons should not be taken seriously". Ødegaard reacted to the attention on him by saying [...] "If you get carried away now, you won't get far in 10 years. I'm supposed to be at my best then, not now. That I know".|$|E

In 2010 Harris stated, [...] "I think if anyone wants to understand Maiden's early thing, in particular the harmony guitars, {{all they have to}} do is listen to Wishbone Ash's Argus album. Thin Lizzy too, but not as much. And then we wanted to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of a prog thing thrown in as well, because I was really into bands like Genesis and Jethro Tull. So you combine all that with the heavy riffs and the speed, and you've got it." [...] In 2004, Harris explained that the band's [...] "heaviness" [...] was inspired by [...] "Black Sabbath and Deep Purple with a bit of Zeppelin thrown in." [...] On top of this, Harris developed his own playing style, which guitarist Janick Gers describes as [...] "more like a rhythm guitar," [...] cited as responsible for the band's galloping style, heard in such songs as [...] "The Trooper" [...] and [...] "Run to the Hills." ...|$|E

Diamandis has revealed that [...] "Madonna was the reason I {{wanted to be a}} pop star from the age of 15," [...] however she also stated that she did not listen to music [...] "properly" [...] until the age of 19, when she took influence from acts including PJ Harvey, Fiona Apple and The Distillers. She began smoking two years later in an attempt to sound like The Distillers' frontwoman Brody Dalle, [...] "but it never worked, and now I'm just stuck with a bad habit." [...] She has cited Dalle and Spears as her musical influences, and has expressed a particular interest in Daniel Johnston and the lo-fi production he uses. She has jokingly stated that [...] "I probably <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of a different sound because I don't really know what I'm doing!," [...] referencing her lack of formal musical training.

But are Anthony and Tyler really the new Grant and Phil Mitchell?" [...] Lapinskas commented on this, saying [...] "It's {{a lot of pressure}} to put us both under, but what a duo to be compared to!... Phil and Grant were in the show together for at least 10years, and they were fantastic– so to be linked to them is phenomenal. It really is a lot to live up to, but Tony and I are hoping to come in with out own energy and bring something completely new to EastEnders.

500|$|Many {{viewers and}} fans of EastEnders {{expected}} Poppy's return {{to be only}} temporary, and thought that she would depart soon after her return. However, it was announced on 24 October that Kirkwood's successor Lorraine Newman decided that Bright will remain with EastEnders {{for the foreseeable future}} as a regular character. Upon this news, Digital Spy announced that Wood-Davis had been cast as Tansy Meadow, Poppy's younger sister, who appeared for one episode. Poppy is [...] "less than enthusiastic" [...] to hear about her sister's visit. In 30 October 2012 episode, Poppy, along with Fatboy (Norwood) host a Halloween ghost tour of the Square organised showing people where former residents have died. A BBC representative said, [...] "The backroom staff {{had a lot of fun}} planning this one". Newman stated in an interview in November 2012 that there is [...] "plenty more on the table" [...] for Poppy adding, [...] "We'll see Poppy become involved in a relationship very soon, which is progressing very well in the material we're working on at the moment. She'll become far more involved in the Square and the friendships within those groups". Digital Spy also revealed Poppy's new relationship, adding that [...] "viewers will have to wait and see who she falls for and how things pan out as the new plot develops". This was confirmed as Fatboy, and the two kiss in 22 November's episode. The pair [...] "grow close" [...] after Tansy's visit, where Fatboy acts as Poppy's [...] "high-flying" [...] businessman boyfriend in front of Tansy, trying to make herself look good in front of her [...] "successful sibling". Bright said of their relationship, [...] "It's really sweet. I don't think Poppy or Fatboy realised they liked each other as they've been friends for a while. She's unsure at first because she doesn't want to ruin a friendship. She's also been unlucky in love, so she's a little bit wary. But I think she can trust Fatboy". Bright expressed her delight at working with Norwood upon her return, after being disappointed she did not work with him during her first stint. In an interview with Metro she said, [...] "Before I started the show Fatboy was one of my favourite characters. I was gutted I didn’t work with him the first time round so when I came back and they told me about Poppy and Fatboy’s relationship, I was just so excited. Their characters are perfect for each other. Poppy and Fatboy are a little bit of light in a lot of gloom around the Square. It’s important to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of comedy between everything else. I’m very lucky". She also expressed her wish for the two to get married, adding that their relationship [...] "looks long term".|$|E
