5|$|Despite Gray {{constantly}} seeking {{collectors and}} {{people to help}} him with the Harvard herbarium, in the first fifteen years he was at Harvard, no graduate entered botany as a career. This changed in 1858 with the arrival of Daniel Cady <b>Eaton,</b> who had graduated from Yale University in 1857 and came to Harvard to study with Gray. <b>Eaton</b> later returned to Yale to be a botany professor and oversee its herbarium, just as Gray did at Harvard. Daniel <b>Eaton</b> was the grandson of Amos <b>Eaton,</b> whose textbooks Gray had studied during his college days. <b>Eaton</b> influenced the teaching style of Gray, and both required practical work of their students.

5|$|<b>Eaton</b> {{took his}} revenge on Calhoun. In 1830, reports had emerged {{accurately}} stating that Calhoun, while Secretary of War, had favored censuring Jackson for his 1818 invasion of Florida. These infuriated Jackson. For reasons unclear, Calhoun asked <b>Eaton</b> to approach Jackson {{about the possibility}} of Calhoun publishing his correspondence with Jackson {{at the time of the}} Seminole War. <b>Eaton</b> did nothing. This caused Calhoun to believe that Jackson had approved the publication of the letters. Calhoun published them in the Telegraph. This gave the appearance of Calhoun trying to justify himself against a conspiracy to damage him, and further enraged the President.|$|E

5|$|Following his {{resignation}} as Secretary of War, <b>Eaton</b> returned to Tennessee. His wife suffered {{a period of}} ill health after arriving. Jackson planned to replace him in the War Department with Tennessee senator Hugh Lawson White. This would vacate White's senate seat, which <b>Eaton</b> would presumably fill. However, White refused the cabinet position. <b>Eaton</b> attempted {{to return to the}} Senate by running against incumbent Felix Grundy in 1832. Jackson officially remained neutral during the election, as Grundy was also a Democrat. <b>Eaton</b> was defeated. He served as a delegate to the 1832 Democratic National Convention. In a letter to Jackson before the convention, <b>Eaton</b> declared his strong support for Jackson's choice of Van Buren for vice president. He also requested that several of his friends be given appointments in the administration.|$|E

5|$|In 1910, <b>Eaton</b> {{became the}} first {{scientist}} to publish a more {{detailed description of the}} entire Pteranodon skeleton, as it was known at the time. He used his findings to revise the classification of the genus once again based on {{a better understanding of the}} differences in pteranodont anatomy. <b>Eaton</b> conducted experiments using clay models of bones to help determine the effects of crushing and flattening on the shapes of the arm bones Williston had used in his own classification. <b>Eaton</b> found that most of the differences in bone shapes could be easily explained by the pressures of fossilization, and concluded that no Pteranodon skeletons had any significant differences from each other besides their size. Therefore, <b>Eaton</b> was left to decide his classification scheme based on differences in the skulls alone, which he assigned to species just as Marsh did, by their size. In the end, <b>Eaton</b> recognized only three valid species: P. occidentalis, P. ingens, and P. longiceps.|$|E
5|$|In August 1922, a {{traveling}} salesman named Jack <b>Eaton</b> {{was arrested for}} allegedly assaulting several young girls.

An investigation found that the Scott County sheriff had willfully delivered <b>Eaton</b> to the mob, and Morrow removed him from office. Though <b>Eaton</b> was a white man, blacks were elated with the removal because they hoped it would encourage other jailers to step up efforts to protect against lynchings and mob violence.|$|E
