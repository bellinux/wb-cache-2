5|$|Arsenal competed against Nantes in {{the third}} round of the contest. At their home venue, Arsenal Stadium, they {{defeated}} the French club 3–0, before recording a 3–3 draw at the Stade de la Beaujoire, ensuring the Gunners a 6–3 aggregate victory. They battled Deportivo La Coruña in the fourth round. Arsenal played at their home ground in the first match, and comprehensively beat the Spanish outfit by five goals to one, before suffering a 1–2 loss at Estadio Municipal de Riazor, which was still <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> English side to the next round on aggregate.|$|E
5|$|In 1967 Olivier {{was caught}} in the middle of a {{confrontation}} between Chandos and Tynan over the latter's proposal to stage Rolf Hochhuth's Soldiers. As the play speculatively depicted Churchill as complicit in the assassination of the Polish prime minister Władysław Sikorski, Chandos regarded it as indefensible. At his urging the board unanimously vetoed the production. Tynan considered resigning over this interference with the management's artistic freedom, but Olivier himself stayed firmly in place, and Tynan also remained. At about this time Olivier began a long struggle against a succession of illnesses. He was treated for prostate cancer and, during rehearsals for his production of Chekhov's Three Sisters he was hospitalised with pneumonia. He recovered <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> heavy role of Edgar in Strindberg's The Dance of Death, the finest of all his performances other than in Shakespeare, in Gielgud's view.|$|E
5|$|The high {{mountain}} Stage 14 into the Italian Alps saw Contador rise to second overall, just five seconds behind race leader Gabriele Bosisio. The next day, Contador finished twelve minutes ahead of Bosisio {{and took the}} race leader's pink jersey. His main rival at that point was Riccardo Riccò, who had gained 16 seconds on him that day and was only 33 back overall. Contador padded his lead over Riccò slightly in short time trial in Stage 16, and stayed out of trouble in Stages 17 and 18, stages where the contenders all finished together. The long and mountainous Stage 19 saw Riccò and Danilo Di Luca both put time into Contador with late attacks, but not <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> jersey from him. Di Luca found himself effected the next day, losing over five minutes and falling from contention, but Contador and Riccò finished together and were separated by just 4 seconds entering the Stage 21 time trial. Riccò was unable to challenge Contador in the Giro's finale, finishing 68th {{on the stage and}} losing close to two minutes to Contador, who was 11th. Though neither Contador himself nor anyone from the team won any stage in the Giro, Contador took the overall victory in the General Classification.|$|E

This stranded thousands of tourists in the village, and the only way out was by helicopter or by crossing one of the high Alpine passes.|$|E

25|$|In {{the spring}} of 1609, all was well at Jamestown with many {{dwellings}} built, acres of land cleared, and much other work done. Then in April, an infestation of rats was discovered, along with dampness, which destroyed all their stored corn.

25|$|In medical {{abortion}} regimens, mifepristone {{blockade of}} progesterone receptors directly causes endometrial decidual degeneration, cervical softening and dilatation, release of endogenous prostaglandins, {{and an increase}} in the sensitivity of the myometrium to the contractile effects of prostaglandins. Mifepristone-induced decidual breakdown indirectly leads to trophoblast detachment, resulting in decreased syncytiotrophoblast production of hCG, which in turn causes decreased production of progesterone by the corpus luteum (pregnancy is dependent on progesterone production by the corpus luteum through the first nine weeks of gestation—until placental progesterone production has increased <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> place of corpus luteum progesterone production). When followed sequentially by a prostaglandin, mifepristone 200mg is (100mg may be, but 50mg is not) as effective as 600mg in producing a medical abortion.|$|E

25|$|Despite their rivalry, Louis IV and Hugh {{were both}} tied to Otto's family through {{marriage}} bonds. Otto intervened {{for peace in}} 942 and announced a formal reconciliation between the two. As {{a part of the}} deal, Hugh was to perform an act of submission to Louis IV, and in return Louis IV was to waive any claims to Lorraine. After a short period of peace, the West Frankish kingdom fell into another crisis in 946. Normans captured Louis IV and handed him over to Hugh, who released the King only on condition of the surrender of the fortress of Laon. At the urging of his sister Gerberga, Otto invaded France on behalf of Louis IV, but his armies were not strong <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> key cities of Laon, Reims, and Paris. After three months, Otto finally lifted the siege without defeating Hugh, but managed to depose Hugh of Vermandois from his position as Archbishop of Reims, restoring Artald of Reims to his former office.|$|E
25|$|The {{final day}} of the meeting was {{highlighted}} by Martina Ratej's first round Slovenian record throw to win the women's javelin contest, upsetting the defending champion and favourite Mariya Abakumova. Markus Münch provided his second personal best in as many years at the Winter Throwing event, but on this occasion his best was <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> gold in the men's discus. Following gold at the 2010 World Indoors, Nadzeya Astapchuk dominated the women's shot put: six of her throws that day were enough to win, although an injury hampered her performance and she was far from her best form. The men's hammer was a close contest with the experienced Nicola Vizzoni just keeping the young Belarusian Yury Shayunou at bay. Sandra Perković was one of the stand-out performers in the under-23s competition: having set a Croatian national record in the discus in the weeks prior to the competition, she won the women's gold with a throw of 61.93m – which would have been enough for a silver medal in the senior ranks.|$|E

25|$|Amodini {{was made}} in 1996. It was a one-hour forty five minutes family comedy. Casting {{included}} Aparna Sen, Rachana Banerjee, Anusree Das and Pijush Ganguly, among others. A satirical Indian fairy tale, it {{is set in the}} perspective of 18th century, when traditional social customs were strictly enforced and complied. The storyline is about the exploits of a pretty and spoiled daughter of a rajah (king) who is forced to become the bride of her 15-year-old Brahmin houseboy after the man she was supposed to marry jilts her on her wedding day. If she does not marry before sunset, something horrible will happen to her; therefore she must marry the servant boy. After the ceremony, the boy is exiled and the union remains unconsummated. Years pass and tragedy befalls the rajah who loses all his wealth. Suddenly the servant boy returns, only he is no longer a servant. Now he has become wealthy and powerful <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> rajah's position from him. Even though by then he has married another, his former bride begs him to take her in.|$|E
25|$|Klitschko was {{scheduled}} to take on undefeated heavyweight contender Tyson Fury, the WBO mandatory challenger, on 24 October 2015 in an unprecedented 28th heavyweight world title appearance. On 25 September 2015, Klitschko postponed the fight, citing a calf injury. It was rescheduled for Saturday, 28 November 2015. Prior to the fight taking place on the night, there was much controversy, first starting with the gloves, {{then there was a}} complaint about the ring canvas. Klitchsko reportedly had his hands wrapped without a representative of Fury, so had to do them again. Klitschko lost the fight by unanimous decision, with scores of 116–111, 115–112, and 115–112 all in favor of Fury. It was the first defeat Klitschko had suffered in over ten years and marked the end of the so-called 'Klitschko Era' referring to the time period where both Klitschko brothers (particularly Wladimir) dominated the division. Klitschko and Fury showed little offence during the 12 rounds, but Fury did <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> decision. Klitschko landed 52 of 231 punches thrown (23%) and Fury landed 86 of 371 thrown (23%).|$|E
25|$|The Ipswich 400 saw the {{championship}} lead change hands, with Jamie Whincup moving ahead of Mark Winterbottom. Whincup won {{both of the}} Saturday races ahead of his teammate Craig Lowndes. Lowndes had started from pole in the first race but Whincup passed him {{towards the end of}} the race to take the win, with Scott McLaughlin finishing behind the pair. McLaughlin, from pole, and Michael Caruso led Whincup and Lowndes for most of the second race. Caruso attempted to pass McLaughlin, but he nudged the Volvo into a spin and received a drive-through penalty. Whincup then held off Lowndes to win the race, with Chaz Mostert finishing third. The Sunday race saw James Moffat take his first career pole position and the first for Nissan since the company returned to the series. James Courtney won the race after starting from second on the grid, with Lowndes in second and Mostert third. Scott Pye scored a career-best result with fourth. Moffat finished fifth after going off the track while attempting to pass Mostert on the final lap. Whincup finished sixth, which was <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> championship lead after a tyre puncture for Winterbottom dropped him to twenty-second place.|$|E

25|$|It {{must have}} seemed like déjà {{vu all over again}} for England as they started day two, with Australia again poised for a large total. Border and Jones resumed and added a further 20 before Border was caught behind of Capel for 76. Jones was finally removed for 122, and Steve Waugh, who seemed to have gone off the boil {{slightly}} following his blistering first three tests, went for a disappointing 14, clean bowled by Igglesden. Rain interrupted temporarily, but play soon resumed, and the South London crowd was then treated with a blistering display of low-order hitting from Queensland-born keeper Ian Healy, who battered 44 off 44 balls. His innings lasted less than an hour and contained six 4s, also taking the Australian total past 400 for the sixth time in as many tests. Eventually he fell, caught behind of the bowling of Derek Pringle, who then proceeded to tear into the tail, collecting the last four wickets. Although Trevor Hohns (30) and Merv Hughes (21) lasted long <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> Australian total to 468, the tourists were all out shortly before stumps. Enough play was left to force England to face an awkward few overs, and the Australians made the most of it, dislodging Graham Gooch LBW to Alderman for a third ball duck. England finished the day on 1 for 1, both not out batsmen yet to score.|$|E
25|$|The Sun {{came into}} the 2010 WNBA Draft with two picks {{in the first round}} – the first and seventh overall picks, the latter of which was {{acquired}} one day prior to the draft from Tulsa. With its first overall selection in franchise history, the Sun took UConn standout and Player of the Year recipient, Tina Charles, the consensus top prospect available. By playing alongside premier talent at the collegiate level, Charles had shown that she was ready to pilot an offense and lead this franchise into the post-Sales era. After the selection of Charles, Thibault had the remainder of the draft to fortify the weapons around his newly acquired center. To diminish the losses of Amber Holt and Chante Black, both of whom were part of the package deal with the Shock, the Sun selected Kansas product Danielle McCray. Prior to the draft, it was understood that McCray wouldn't be available to participate in the upcoming season due to an ACL injury she sustained in college. There was risk involved concerning her durability, but McCray's potential as a superstar was reason <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> leap of faith. The Sun cemented its guard corps with the selection of Allison Hightower in the second round. Thibault wasn't finished making a mark on draft day as he maneuvered around the draft board to address the Sun's suspect defense. He nabbed former Cornhusker Kelsey Griffin, who was taken third overall, in a trade once again involving the Lynx. This trade would have the Sun relinquishing their first and second round picks in next year's draft. The acquisition of coveted players through the draft and free agency capped an offseason of change that had transformed a franchise for the future. Although the reconstruction of the Sun remained a work in progress, this talented class of prospects would serve as the foundation for a team that jumped back into contention quicker than anyone anticipated.|$|E
