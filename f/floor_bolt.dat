30|$|The results {{indicated}} that the reinforcing coefficients of bolting in roof and sides, on floor, two sides and roof, reached 2.18, 3.56, and 1.81 respectively. The reinforcing coefficient of <b>floor</b> <b>bolting,</b> on <b>floor,</b> two sides and roof reached 3.06, 2.34, and 1.39 respectively. The data show that roof and sides bolting had the biggest effect in reinforcing two sides, bigger effect in floor strengthening, and big effect in roof controlling. Although no bolting was used in floor, the reinforcing coefficient on floor reached 2.18, showing a greater effect than on roof. Based on bolting in roof and two sides, <b>floor</b> <b>bolting</b> had the biggest effect in floor reinforcing, bigger effect in two sides strengthening, and big effect in roof controlling, which indicated that the effect of <b>floor</b> <b>bolting</b> decreased as distance to floor increased.|$|R
30|$|In mine roadway support operations, <b>floor</b> <b>bolting</b> {{not only}} {{played a role}} in floor heave control, but also in {{reinforcing}} roof and its two sides. Correspondingly, bolting of roof and two sides also played a part in floor heave control. To quantify the effect of such bolting, based on roadway support in extremely weak rock, three physical models were produced and tested in laboratory. Through comparison of their displacements in three physical simulation experiments, the reinforcing effect of bolting in extremely weak rock roadways was quantified. Reinforcing coefficients was defined as displacement ratio between original support and new support regime. Results indicated that the reinforcing coefficients, for bolting of roof and its two sides, on floor, two sides, and roof reached 2.18, 3.56, and 1.81 respectively. The reinforcing coefficients for <b>floor</b> <b>bolting</b> on <b>floor,</b> two sides, and roof reached 3.06, 2.34, and 1.39 respectively. So in this extremely weak rock, the surrounding rock should be considered as an integral structure in any support operation: this allows for better local strength improvement, and provided future design guidance.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The floor heave {{is one of}} {{soft rock}} roadway distortion. Based on soft rock {{supporting}} theory and engineering practice, the program bolt-mesh-anchors and <b>floor</b> corner, <b>bolts</b> coupling support to control floor heave of the soft rock roadway is proposed. Numerical simulation results show that bolt-anchors can mobilize {{the strength of the}} deep adjacent rock, at the same time, and properly arranged <b>floor</b> corner <b>bolts</b> with high bending rigidity can cut the slip-line field and achieve the goal of controlling floor heave effectively...|$|R
30|$|In high-stress soft rock, {{according}} to Chang et al. (2013), {{use of a}} double layer of 40 U-shape steel sets, cables, resin bolts in both ribs and roof, and swellex <b>bolts</b> in <b>floor</b> were used in roadway support works. Sun et al. (2014) indicated that the asymmetric coupling support of bolt net spray, with anchor cables, and <b>floor</b> <b>bolts</b> could enhance the stability of deep roadway. Li et al. (2015) proposed a combined support system including: high-toughness sealing layer, hollow grouting cables, and full-length anchor bolts. Li et al. (2014) recommended a coupling support of double yielding shells, which can control roadway deformation in high stress soft rock.|$|R
30|$|Under the {{influence}} of extremely weak rock, ground stress and swelling pressures, the roadway deformed to a significant extent, in which floor heave was particularly serious. Steel sets or bolts alone had little effect in controlling roadway deformation. So, a variety of supporting methods, such as closed 36 U-shape steel sets and bolting, a pair of 12 I-beam steel sets and bolting, were tested in situ. Although offering significant support strength, roadways deformed continuously and those supports failed to achieve an ideal effect. Because {{of the presence of}} expansive clay in this extremely weak rock, grouting was unfeasible. So, the alternative was to improve the strength of steel sets, or to improve the strength of bolts, or to improve the strength of both. This project mainly researched the effect of bolting in this extremely weak rock, included assessment of effect of roof and both sides bolting, and the effect of <b>floor</b> <b>bolting.</b>|$|R
30|$|In most control measures, bolting in {{surrounding}} {{rock was}} used to better effect (Guo et al. 2012; Wang et al. 2012; Meng et al. 2013; Kang et al. 2015; Sun and Wang 2011; Wang et al. 2015; Yuan et al. 2014; Yu et al. 2015; Zhao et al. 2015). Since the surrounding rock {{was treated as a}} whole structure, <b>bolts</b> in the <b>floor</b> not only played a role in controlling floor heave, but also played a role in reinforcing roof and two sides. Correspondingly, bolts in roof and two sides not only played a part in reinforcing the roof and the two sides, but also played a role in controlling floor heave. To quantify the effect of bolting, based on extremely weak rock in the No. 1 mine of Chagannuoer, three physical simulation experiments were conducted. Through displacement comparison in three experiments, we analysed the quantitative effect of boltig in the roof and two sides, and the effect of <b>floor</b> <b>bolting</b> in reinforcing the surrounding rock, which would provide guidance for roadway support in future.|$|R

Hinge marks are located on vertical posts on each side along with reinforced brass holes in the <b>floor</b> for <b>bolts.</b> There are hinged flaps in the skirting boards. Some of these have their original hinges and bolts. There are four doors in the building-two on the southern side and two on the northern. The two on the southern side are original double doors, while only the door on the western end of the northern wall is an original double door. The door at the eastern end of the northern wall is a later addition.|$|R

This research program was {{designed to provide a}} basic understanding of the structural behavior of entry intersections. A wide variety of instruments and measurement techniques including hydraulic borehole pressure cells, multiple-point borehole extensometers, roof bolt compression pads, and overcoring were employed to monitor roof stresses, pillar loading, strata movement, <b>floor</b> heave, and <b>bolt</b> loading before, during, and after intersection development. A summary of intersection design theories, failure modes, and support techniques is included and instrumentation installation procedures and analysis methods are presented. The study identified two critical parameters that affect intersection stability: in situ horizontal stresses and geological discontinuities. Important design parameters for improving intersection stability are roof span and intersection geometry...|$|R

It was ill fitted, so that the edge of it stood up above the <b>flooring,</b> also the <b>bolt</b> that {{fastened}} it had been removed, although the staples in which it used to work remained. Peter looked round for some stick or piece of wood to pass through these staples, but could find nothing. Then he bethought him of a short length of cord that {{he had in his}} pocket, which served to tie one of the saddle-bags in its place on his mule. This he fastened from one staple to the other, so that the trap-door could not be lifted more than an inch or two.|$|R

He examined the whole room, sounding <b>bolt,</b> <b>floor,</b> and wainscot with his knuckles and cane, {{but was unable to}} discern any secret passages; while the door, secured by a strong cross-bolt, and the lock besides, remained as firm as when he had fastened it on the preceding evening. The apparition resembling Victor Lee next called his attention. Ridiculous stories had been often circulated, of this figure, or one exactly resembling it, having been met with by night among the waste apartments and corridors of the old palace; and Markham Everard had often heard such in his childhood. He was angry to recollect his own deficiency of courage, and the thrill which he felt on the preceding night, when by confederacy, doubtless, such an object was placed before his eyes.|$|R
40|$|An {{imperative}} {{task for}} successful underground mining {{is to ensure}} the stability of underground structures, since it influences the safety, and in turn, the production capacity and economic performance of the mine. This is more so for deep excavations in soft rock which may be under significantly high stresses. In this thesis, stability studies on two tunnels, a horseshoe-shaped and an inverted arch-shaped tunnel, have been presented. The tunnels, running {{at a depth of}} 1325 m, are part of the Xiezhuang Coal Mine, in the Xinwen mining area, in China. Using the available information on stratigraphy, geological structures, in-situ stress measurements and geo-mechanical properties of intact rock and discontinuity interfaces, a three-dimensional numerical model has been built using the 3 DEC 3 -Dimensional Distinct Element Code to simulate the stress conditions around the tunnels. Based on available discontinuity geometry constraints, the rock mass has been modelled as a mixture of a discontinuum medium close to the tunnels and as an equivalent-continuum in the far field. Due to the unavailability of field measurements for rock mass mechanical parameters, the parameters have been estimated by incorporating the available intact rock mechanical properties and field deformation monitoring data into a strength reduction model calibration procedure. This back-analysis (calibration) has been carried out through a pseudo-time dependent support installation routine which incorporates the effect of time through a stress-relaxation mechanism. The results from the back-analysis indicate that the rock mass cohesion, tensile strength, uniaxial compressive strength, and elastic modulus values are about 35 - 45 % of the corresponding intact rock property values. Additionally, the importance of incorporating stress relaxation before support installation in numerical modeling has been illustrated, {{for the first time in}} literature, through the increased support factors of safety and reduced grout failures. The calibrated models have been analyzed for different supported and unsupported cases in an attempt to quantify the effect of supports in stabilizing the tunnels and to estimate the adequacy of the existing supports being used in the mine. A direct outcome is that the findings indicate that longer supports may be better suited for the existing geo-mining conditions around the tunnels since they have fractured zones that are larger than the supports currently in use at the mine. The effects of supports have been demonstrated using changes in deformations and yield zones around the tunnels, and changes in the average factors of safety and grout failures of the supports. The use of longer supports and <b>floor</b> <b>bolting</b> has provided greater stability for the rock masses around the tunnels. A comparison between the closure strains in the two differently shaped tunnels indicates that the inverted arch tunnel may be more efficient in reducing roof sag and floor heave for the existing geo-mining conditions. Additional analyses focusing on parametric sensitivity studies on the rock and joint mechanical properties show that the tunnel stability is highly sensitive to changes in cohesion and internal friction angle of the intact rock, and changes in joint basic friction angle. Tunnel stability is seen to not be very sensitive to changes in intact rock tensile strength and joint shear stiffness for the tunnels being studied. Finally, support optimization studies conducted by studying the effect of changing cable diameters and grout uniaxial compressive strengths on support factors of safety and grout failures show the trade-off that is necessary in selecting cable strength vis-à-vis grout strength. The results indicate that simply increasing either one of cable or grout strength parameters without considering their interactions and compatibilities could be detrimental to the stability of the support system...|$|R
5000|$|The {{underframe}} construction {{consisted of}} two steel, all-welded Pratt trusses, extending from bolster to bolster and in depth from waist rail to below floor level constitute the main strength members of the cars. A light gauge aluminium framework made of pressings, {{in a similar manner}} to aircraft construction, was built on to the truss. The whole being then sheathed with aluminium. The floors were made up of 16 gauge aluminium alloy sheet covering the whole of the underframe upon which timber <b>floor</b> bearers were <b>bolted</b> to support the 13/16 in plywood flooring. Linoleum was laid over the plywood. The floor under the plywood, body sides, and the roof were insulated with kapok material. Longitudinal luggage racks extending the full length of the saloons were built into the body sides. These were fabricated from aluminium alloy. Interior partitions and doors were of 13/16" [...] resin-bonded plywood. All side windows were double glazed, set in rubber channels, and fitted with silica gel crystals in containers, to prevent frosting of the windows.|$|R
40|$|Over the years, {{with the}} scope of {{minimizing}} structural damage, several dampers were developed [1 - 2] and new replaceable hybrid composite steel devices [3] have been recently proposed. The aim {{of this paper is}} to propose and investigate a new replaceable hysteretic damper having a basic form of the art of building, minimally architecturally invasive, consisting of two or more dissipative steel columns directly connected to two consecutive floors linked to each other with X-shaped low/mild steel plates. The proposed Dissipative Column (DC) models are shown in Fig. 1 for two different end cases (models A, B). The elements can be considered as a sort of framed bi-pendulum, connected in parallel to the primary structure, able to react to the story drift D with a lateral force QD adding stiffness, strength and damping. The design concept of the DC element aims to obtain a lever mechanism by which a small inter-storey drift provides an amplified vertical drift in the Xplate ends reacting with shear forces, (Fig. 1 c)). X-shaped steel plates made of mild or Low Yielding Strength (LYS) steel [4] are also used as shear links between coupled elements. The top ends of two models are linked to upper <b>floor</b> through slotted <b>bolted</b> connections to allow vertical displacements. By yielding a large volume of steel, the shear devices dissipate substantial input energy under earthquake or strong wind also increasing damping in the entire system. The great advantages of DC elements, if compared with classical dissipative brace, are the reduced architectural invasiveness so that they are able to be integrated in any building, the ease of installation everywhere, their replacement after earthquakes and the stable behavior in cyclic reversal deformation. Axial forces should be designed in ordered to be transferred locally to a proper structural element...|$|R
