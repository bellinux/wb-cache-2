The head of the bolt or the nut sits inside a counterbore that is also threaded to accept a crank puller tool. The counterbore is often covered with a <b>dust</b> <b>cover.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Gas-Block, {{handguard}} retainers and folding-stock mechanism {{components are}} cast pieces that are finish-machined and accordingly fitted. The sighting arrangements are also entirely cast and machined for greater durability. The only stamped components on the Galil are the magazine-catch, trigger guard, <b>dust</b> <b>cover</b> (on the R5 and R6 the rear handguard-retainer is stamped versus cast) and the magazines.|$|E
25|$|The global <b>dust</b> <b>cover</b> and the {{presence}} of other wind-blown sediments has made soil compositions remarkably uniform across the Martian surface. Analysis of soil samples from the Viking landers in 1976, Pathfinder, and the Mars Exploration rovers show nearly identical mineral compositions from widely separated locations around the planet. The soils consist of finely broken up basaltic rock fragments and are highly enriched in sulphur and chlorine, probably derived from volcanic gas emissions.|$|E

25|$|Other stadiums like Adelaide Oval and Sydney Cricket Ground {{have been}} known to assist spinners more as these pitches have more <b>dust</b> <b>cover.</b> This makes the stadiums an {{attractive}} ground for batsmen; teams on an average have scores of 300 or above in their first innings. The Melbourne Cricket Ground can assist seam bowlers initially, but it has a tennis-ball bounce which can negate the potency of bowlers once a match progresses.|$|E
25|$|The {{main concern}} was the energy level for Spirit. To {{increase}} the amount of light hitting the solar panels, the rover was parked {{in the northern part of}} Home Plate on as steep a slope as possible. It was expected that the level of <b>dust</b> <b>cover</b> on the solar panels would increase by 70 percent and that a slope of 30 degrees would be necessary to survive the winter. In February, a tilt of 29.9 degrees was achieved. Extra energy was available at times, and a high definition panorama named Bonestell was produced. At other times there was only enough solar energy to recharge the batteries, communication with Earth was minimized and all unnecessary instruments were switched off. At winter solstice the energy production declined to 235 watt hours per sol.|$|E
500|$|Chademo:On {{the left}} hand {{side of the car}} towards the rear is the “rapid” DC CHAdeMO {{charging}} point. at 125 Amps. It is beneath a cover (released from inside the car), [...] there is a <b>dust</b> <b>cover</b> beneath to keep out insects etc. [...] There are two large pins (for the charging current) and eight small ones for control circuitry. [...] The cable used for this purpose is captive to the roadside charging point. When the car is on fast (DC) charge, the air conditioning system is automatically started and refrigerated air is blown through the battery pack for cooling purposes. There is a diverter flap in the ventilation system for this. From depletion, the battery may be charged to 80% full in 20 minutes using this socket.|$|E

2500|$|The weapon's only safety was the hinged {{ejection}} port <b>dust</b> <b>cover.</b> [...] This cover had {{a projection}} {{on the underside}} that engaged a notch on the bolt, locking it in either its forward or rearmost positions. The M3 had no mechanical means of disabling the trigger, and the insertion of a loaded magazine would load the gun. [...] With receiver walls made of relatively thin-gauge sheet metal, the M3/M3A1 were subject to disabling damage if dropped on an open <b>dust</b> <b>cover</b> - the covers bent easily, negating the safety feature. [...] Dropping the gun on a sharp or hard surface could dent the receiver enough to bind the bolt.|$|E
2500|$|The 1971 {{and older}} blocks use a [...] "small" [...] bell housing bolt pattern that is {{exclusive}} to AMC and small Nash sixes. In 1972 the bell housing bolt pattern {{was changed to}} match the AMC V8's - its final use was in 2006 when the 4.0 was phased out. Four bolts on the cylinder block are matched to the transmission bellhousing where an adapter plate serves both as a <b>dust</b> <b>cover</b> - two additional bolt holes on the transmission bellhousing used on the AMC V8 are used to secure the <b>dust</b> <b>cover.</b> The 1971 258 uses the [...] "small" [...] pattern, the only year 258 to do so.|$|E

2500|$|Don Ackerman wrote Maine Antique Digest in April 1997 {{questioning}} {{the authenticity of}} the image sold at auction. Bob Raynor of the magazine acknowledged that H. C. A., after researching the image, had represented it as being Josie Earp. He noted that “Both Sotheby's and Swann Galleries identified and sold the photo image in 1996, both auctions prior to the December HCA auction.” Raynor stated, “Please note that the image was used as a <b>dust</b> <b>cover</b> of the book I Married Wyatt Earp, published by University of Arizona Press, 1976. Additionally, the image was used in another book, Wyatt Earp's Tombstone Vendetta, published by Talei, and also in Pioneer Jews, Houghton Mifflin, 1984. In all instances the image was identified as Josephine Earp.” However, all these sources postdate and rely on Boyer's use of the image {{on the cover of the}} book. On April 8, 1998, Sotheby's [...] sold another copy of the image for $2,875.|$|E
2500|$|HK {{included}} several design {{features that are}} essential in modern military firearms. For example, the bolt locks back after the last round is spent (this can be deactivated), and at {{the front end of}} the trigger guard there is a bolt catch button. The cocking handle can be switched from either end, folds in, and unfolds from a spring so the shooter need not unfold it by hand [...] before firing. Another feature of it is that it doubles as the forward assist, which is used in the instance that the spent cartridge ejected but the next one did not properly extract and go into battery. In addition, the ejection port has a brass deflector to mitigate the amount of casings that may strike the face of left-handed operators. Instead of a <b>dust</b> <b>cover</b> which has the need to be flipped back up when the gun isn't in use, the bolt acts as the seal from dirt.|$|E
2500|$|For both Orthodox and Eastern Catholics, the Holy Table (altar) is {{normally}} free-standing, although in very small sanctuaries {{it might be}} placed flush {{against the back wall}} for reasons of space. They are typically about one meter high, and although they may be made of stone they are generally built out of wood. The exact dimensions may vary, but it is generally square in plan and in reasonable proportion {{to the size of the}} sanctuary. It has five legs: one at each corner plus a central pillar for supporting the relics which are placed in it at its consecration (if, however, the consecration was not performed by a bishop, but by a priest whom he delegated for that purpose, relics are not placed in the Holy Table). A plain linen covering (Greek: Katasarkion, Slavonic: Strachítsa) is bound to the Holy Table with cords; this cover is never removed after the altar is consecrated, and is considered to be the [...] "baptismal garment" [...] of the altar. The linen covering symbolizes the winding sheet in which the body of Christ was wrapped when he was laid in the tomb. Since the altar is never seen uncovered thereafter, the table tends to be constructed more with sturdiness than aesthetics in mind. Above this first cover is a second ornamented altar cloth (Indítia), often in a brocade of a liturgical color that may change with the ecclesiastical season. This outer covering usually comes all the way to the floor and represents the glory of God's Throne. In many churches it is the custom for a <b>dust</b> <b>cover</b> to be placed on the Holy Table between services. This is often a simple red cloth, though it may be made of richer stuff. Sometimes it covers only the Gospel Book or the front half of the Holy Table, but it may be large enough to cover the entire Holy Table and everything on it, including candlesticks and the seven-branch candelabra.|$|E
