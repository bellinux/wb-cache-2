5|$|Parrish, {{upset with}} the {{ineffectiveness}} of the association, proposed forming a players' union, that would be independent of the NFLPA, {{with the assistance of}} the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT). The IBT pushed for the NFLPA to join the trucking union. In early November 1967, Parrish, with support from former Cleveland Browns player Jim Brown, began distributing union cards to form a Teamsters affiliate known as the American Federation of Pro Athletes. The NFLPA rejected the overture at its meeting in Hollywood, Florida, during the first week of January 1968 and declared itself an <b>independent</b> <b>union.</b> Although Parrish's proposal was defeated, Miller left his position as counsel to the union. He was later replaced by two Chicago labor lawyers, Dan Schulman and Bernie Baum.|$|E
5|$|Six {{months after}} the NFLPA {{declared}} itself an <b>independent</b> <b>union,</b> many players were dissatisfied {{with the lack of}} compensation teams provided and voted to strike on July 3, 1968 after official discussions with the owners stalled. The owners countered by declaring a lockout. By July 14, 1968, the brief work stoppage came to an end. Although a CBA resulted, many players felt that the agreement did not net them as many benefits as they had hoped. The owners agreed to contribute about $1.5 million to the pension fund with minimum salaries of $9,000 for rookies, $10,000 for veterans and $50 per exhibition game; there was at yet no neutral arbitration for disputes.|$|E
5|$|On 13 December 1981, {{claiming}} {{that the country was}} on the verge of economic and civil breakdown, and alleging a danger of Soviet intervention, General Wojciech Jaruzelski began a crack-down on Solidarity. Martial law was declared, the free labor union was suspended and most of its leaders detained. Several thousand citizens were interned or imprisoned and much larger numbers were subjected to various forms of harassment. Polish state militia (Milicja Obywatelska, the police) and paramilitary riot police ZOMO suppressed the strike action and demonstrations. Military forces entered industrial enterprises to clamp down on the <b>independent</b> <b>union</b> movement. A series of violent attacks included the pacification of Wujek Coal Mine during which 9 people were killed. The martial law offensive was directed primarily against workers and their Union; they, rather than intelligentsia activists, were the object of the most brutal treatment. The authorities succeeded in imposing on members of Solidarity an individual and collective trauma, from which the broken mass movement would not be able to recover. The Catholic Church strove to exert on Solidarity a moderating influence both before and after the martial law.|$|E
5000|$|The Egyptian Democratic Labour Congress (EDLC) is an <b>independent</b> {{national}} trade <b>union</b> centre {{formed in}} 2013.

While the first <b>independent</b> <b>unions</b> {{in the public sector}} joined the Egyptian Federation of <b>Independent</b> Trade <b>Unions</b> (EFITU), the EDLC grouped together mostly private sector trade unions.

25|$|In January 1907, the Painters {{petitioned the}} SBTA {{to form a}} council in New York City. The union was {{supported}} by the Tile Layers and Plumbers unions. Building and construction painting in New York City was controlled at the time by an <b>independent</b> <b>union.</b> The Painters wished to strike contractors who employed workers belonging to the <b>independent</b> <b>union.</b> A local SBTA alliance in New York would mean that the other unions would be forced to honor the Painters' jurisdictional strike—bringing the superior numbers of the other SBTA unions to bear on the contractors. Unwilling to be dragged into such a conflict, the SBTA Board of Governors voted against forming a council in New York City. The Painters disaffiliated, significantly reducing the Alliance's membership and income.|$|E

25|$|The CTM then proceeded, {{with the}} {{implicit}} {{help of the}} State, to eliminate <b>independent</b> <b>union</b> leaders in industrial unions such as miners, oil and railroad workers.

25|$|During Dharma Raja's reign, Tipu Sultan invaded Travancore, but {{commander-in-chief}} Raja Kesavadas led Travancore {{to victory}} despite being outnumbered. This attack led to Travancore joining the British against Tipu in the Third Battle of Carnatic. Pazhsi Raja, Velu Thampi Dalava and Paliath Achan, later leaders of Travancore, fought the British East India Company but lost. Travancore became a British ally in 1805 following a treaty between Colonel Charles Macaulay and Diwan Velu Tampi.

25|$|The Battle of Ballantyne was {{the bloody}} climax {{of a very}} {{volatile}} year in Vancouver, but fell {{far short of the}} insurrection anticipated by the police and anticommunists.

Longshoremen, however, would continue to fight for the right to organize an <b>independent</b> <b>union</b> and to control dispatching, and finally succeeded a decade later when they formed the International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU), Local 500.|$|E

5000|$|A {{company or}} [...] "yellow" [...] union is a worker {{organization}} which is dominated or influenced by an employer, {{and is therefore}} not an <b>independent</b> trade <b>union.</b> Company unions are contrary to international labour law (see ILO Convention 98, article 2).

25|$|Militants {{published}} a newspaper, The Waterfront Worker, {{which focused on}} longshoremen's most pressing demands: more men on each gang, lighter loads and an <b>independent</b> <b>union.</b> While {{a number of the}} individuals in this group were Communist Party members, the group as a whole was independent of the party: although it criticized the International Seamen's Union (ISU) as weak and the International Longshoremen's Association (ILA), which had its base on the East Coast, as corrupt, it did not embrace the MWIU, but called instead for creation of small knots of activists at each port to serve as {{the first step in a}} slow, careful movement to unionize the industry.|$|E
25|$|A second {{challenge}} was organizational. Feldman pushed for and won convention {{approval for the}} addition of {{an executive vice president}} for the AFT, the first new executive officer {{to be added to the}} union's governing structure in its history. Nat LaCour, president of the United Teachers of New Orleans, was elected to the position. But Feldman was unable to overcome all the union's organizational and political problems. In late July 1998, about 3,500 members of the AFT's health care division, almost all of them in Rhode Island, disaffiliated due to a disagreement about the union's willingness to spend money organizing new members. The health care workers subsequently formed an <b>independent</b> <b>union,</b> the United Nurses and Allied Professionals, and later raided several AFT health care locals in Rhode Island and Vermont.|$|E

40|$|A {{model of}} wage {{determination}} in unionized oligopolistic industries is developed {{and used to}} compare the outcome of collective bargaining under two different bargaining structures-one in which the workers of each firm are represented by separate and <b>independent</b> <b>unions</b> (local bargaining) and one in which a national union represents all workers in the industry. In both cases, the bargaining problem has a unique outcome with industrywide bargaining resulting in higher wages. In addition, industrywide unions are inherently stable in that there are no incentives for <b>independent</b> <b>unions</b> to attempt to cheat on the collusive agreement.

25|$|Also during 1928, the Lupeni miners had {{organised}} {{themselves into}} an <b>independent</b> <b>union,</b> led by Teodor Munteanu {{and a certain}} Moldoveanu. The union was not communist. Its leaders were closely aligned with the National Peasants' Party (PNȚ), which wished to strengthen its relations with workers. (After the strike, the opposition press asserted that the union had very close links with the PNȚ and that its members had taken part in a large electoral demonstration in Alba Iulia in May 1928.) During {{the first months of}} labour agitation, the union asked members to await the high court's ruling. However, communist agitators were active in the spring of 1929 in the Jiu Valley, and the workers grew increasingly desperate as their conditions failed to improve and the court's ruling was delayed.|$|E
25|$|The {{widespread}} strikes of 1980 {{were far}} from being the first clashes between the ruling party and the working class in Poland after World War II. Despite having a “socialist” government, the elite of the Polish ruling class averaged an income twenty times that of the blue-collar worker. This elite ruling class owned or largely controlled the police, media and industry of the state, including the state-organized unions. Insufficient pay and food shortages, in addition to a growing movement in favor of <b>independent</b> <b>union</b> activism led to strikes in 1956 and 1970 which left hundreds of workers dead from clashes with police, and both the 1970 and 1976 strikes ended with some concessions but subsequent additional repressions from management. Workers were increasingly dissatisfied with their standard of living and the half-hearted responses of the government to their calls for social justice, and when in July 1980 the government attempted to raise the price of meat even further, sit-in strikes started up again.|$|E
25|$|Following {{independence}} and the partition of India on 15 August 1947, the RIN's depleted fleet of ships and remaining personnel were divided between the newly <b>independent</b> <b>Union</b> of India and Dominion of Pakistan. 21 percent of the Navy's officer cadre and 47 percent of its sailors opted to join {{the portion of the}} fleet which became the Royal Pakistan Navy. Effective from the same date, all British officers were compulsorily retired from the Navy and its reserve components, with Indian officers being promoted to replace British senior officers. However, a number of British flag and senior officers were invited to continue serving in the RIN. After independence, the Indian share of the Navy consisted of 32 vessels along with 11,000 personnel. Rear Admiral John Talbot Savignac Hall headed the Navy as its first Commander-in-Chief (C-in-C) post-Independence. When India became a republic on 26 January 1950, the Royal prefix was dropped and the name Indian Navy was officially adopted. The prefix for naval vessels was changed from His Majesty's Indian Ship (HMIS) to Indian Naval Ship (INS). At the same time, the imperial crown in insignia was replaced with the Lion Capital of Ashoka and the Union Jack in the canton of the White Ensign was replaced with the Indian Tricolour.|$|E
