6000|$|... "It's risky, Dorn," [...] said Olsen, with hesitation. [...] "But <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> {{in a few}} tellin' shots--start that gang on the run!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{told you}} yesterday, sir,' said the Lord Mayor, 'that {{you might have}} an {{alderman}} in your house, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> one to come.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You seem to {{be rather}} {{in the case of}} the tailor yourself,' said Guy, 'ready to do battle, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> but <b>get</b> any opposition.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{that is a}} very {{complimentary}} wish on his part, and I {{can tell}} you what it is, Angela, <b>if</b> only <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> that young Heigham out of your head, you might do a deal worse." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Enemy!" [...] she {{repeated}} scornfully. [...] "Mr. Draconmeyer {{is much too}} wrapped up in his finance, and too big a man, in his way, to have enemies. Oh, Henry, <b>if</b> only <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> rid of a few of your prejudices, how much more civilised a human being you would be!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But it must be. Everybody {{said that}} you were {{to be one of them}} <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> the other people out. Is it Mr. Bonteen?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "O yes, you have, Sam. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> me appointed, {{you can get}} him appointed; and you must, for, if you don't, I won't go." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "An' <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> your missus {{to go home}} {{by train}} from Summercove, George, {{we might have a}} little peace and quietness," [...] added the other.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's funny," [...] said Dave, patiently, [...] "you can't get {{the hang}} of it. Maybe it's born in a fellow. Now {{handling}} a gun seems to come natural for some fellows, and you're one of them. <b>If</b> only <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> the rope away as quick as you can throw your gun!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No doubt. And <b>if</b> <b>you</b> {{think you}} can get it, I advise you to stick to it. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> thought <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> it <b>you</b> would say the same. But I should like to get that old man's 'ead between my fists. Wouldn't I punch it! Thief! scoundrel! 'orrid old man! It ain't for myself that I'm {{speaking}} now, because I'm a-going to get it,--I think I'm a-going to get it;--it's for humanity at large. This kind of thing wiolates one's best feelings." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I will--I will, Daly; {{but look}} here--if he bites freely--and I think he will, and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> find <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> {{as much as}} a {{thousand}} out of him, or even eight hundred, you shall have one hundred clear for yourself." ...|$|R
60|$|But {{you know}} {{perfectly}} well that you'd cheerfully bring the British Empire tumbling about our ears <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> me a good fat billet by doing so.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{would be}} a great thing <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> this Martin Thomas to confess his secret," [...] remarked Horace Kelsey to Ralph, after the hearing was over.|$|E
6000|$|... "That was his episcopal ring," [...] Herrara laughed. [...] "Yes, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> hold of that, {{it would}} be a key that would open the door of any convent." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'She seats herself, {{and looks}} {{towards the door}} by which the Courier has been led out. [...] "Ah! my poor fellow," [...] she says, [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>could</b> only change constitutions with my Lord, what a happy result would follow for the Baron and for me! <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> only <b>get</b> cured of a trumpery cold with a little hot lemonade, and if he could only catch his death in your place--!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I wonder <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> {{possibly}} <b>get</b> it {{into your}} head, mother, that I want to marry Jill, not engage her as an under-housemaid. I don't consider that she requires recommendations, as you call them. However, don't you think the most sensible thing {{is for you to}} wait till you meet her at dinner to-night, and then you can form your own opinion? I'm beginning to get a little bored by this futile discussion." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thinking {{of running}} to the moon!" [...] the scout said contemptuously. [...] "You can run well, I don't deny, Jake, but you couldn't run fifteen mile with the dragoons; and, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>could,</b> you'd <b>get</b> there too late. Yer bellows are going pretty fast already. Now don't stand staring there, but hurry through the camp and get all our boys together. Tell them to meet by the water side. Get Gregory and Vincent's men {{as well as our}} own. There's twenty or thirty {{altogether}} in the place." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Allow me to hint to you, Archer, that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> {{some food}} and drink for these ladies, instead of {{discussing}} my personal appearance, {{it would be much}} more practical." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's good! Now <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> an old veteran detective {{down from}} St. Louis {{to help you}} find out what the clues mean, and where they lead to, and then--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Gys {{wants to}} go on a fishing trip. He plans to start to-night for the Maine woods. But I've an idea <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> him face to face you might {{convince}} him." ...|$|E
6000|$|Ward {{perceived}} something {{hidden in}} her voice, some emotion {{which was more}} than terror, deeper than pity, but his words were grave and kindly. [...] "It is a frightful risk, young man, but the trail to the glacier is your only open road. The sheriff is tired. Even if he finds out that you are here he may not come back to-night. He will know you cannot escape. You can't stir without leaving a telltale mark. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> only <b>get</b> below the snow on the west slope--" ...|$|R
60|$|But {{it is not}} {{necessary}} to enlarge on his abilities. The figures against his name in Wisden prove a good deal. The fact that he had steered Kay's through into the last round of the house-matches proves still more. It was perfectly obvious to everyone that, <b>if</b> only <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> Fenn out for under ten, Kay's total for that innings would be nearer twenty than forty. They were an appalling side. But then no house bowler had as yet succeeded in getting Fenn out for under ten. In the six innings he had played in the competition up to date, he had made four centuries, an eighty, and a seventy.|$|R
5000|$|A major {{influence}} on Smith was Scrooge McDuck creator Carl Barks. Alluding to Barks' influence on Bone, Smith commented, [...] "I always wanted Uncle Scrooge {{to go on}} a longer adventure. I thought, 'Man, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> just <b>get</b> a comic book of that quality, the length of say, War and Peace, or The Odyssey or something, that would be something I would love to read, and even as a kid I looked everywhere for that book, that Uncle Scrooge story that was 1,100 pages long." [...] Another influence on Bone, and Smith's biggest influence in writing comics in general, however, is Walt Kelly.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, sir," [...] said Phil Ogden; [...] "but I {{doubt if}} we can do it. Father says it is a week's work for five men, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> them to do it." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Purcey, a {{sensitive}} man <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> through his skin, {{gave her a}} shrewd look. 'I don't quite cotton to this woman,' he seemed saying; 'there's a laugh about her I don't like.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I guess you'd be, too, Urner, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> such a {{nice girl}} to notice you," [...] {{returned}} Tom dryly. And then he added: [...] "You must remember we are all old friends." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't {{leave him}} to drown," [...] said Rachel, making a desperate scramble, and almost overbalancing herself. [...] "Here, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> only <b>get</b> {{him by the}} scrough of his neck, it would not hurt him so much; poor Don, yes, poor fellow!" [...] as he whined, but still showed his {{confidence}} in the touching manner of a sensible dog, knowing he is hurt for his good. Bessie made another attempt, but, unused to rocks, she was uneasy about her footing, and merely frightened herself. [...] "Indeed," [...] she said, [...] "I had better run and call some one; I won't be long, and you are really quite safe." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{just what}} I {{want you to}} do," [...] Kinsley said. [...] "I am afraid Fentolin {{is a little too}} clever for you to get {{on the right side of}} him, but <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> only <b>get</b> an idea as to what his game is down there, it would be a great help. You see, the fellow can't have gone into all this sort of thing blindfold. We've lost several very useful agents abroad and two from New York who've gone into his pay. There must be a method in it somewhere. If it really ends with his {{financial}} operations--why, all right. That's very likely what it'll come to, but we should like to know. The merest hint would be useful." ...|$|R
6000|$|But all at once, just as {{they were}} starting, the bottom of the coach fell in pieces. They made a new bottom as fast as they could, but, no matter how they nailed it together, or what kind of wood they used, no sooner had they got the new bottom into the coach and were about to drive off than it broke again, so that they were still worse off than when they had broken the trace-pin. Then the {{attorney}} said, for he too was at the wedding in the palace: [...] "Away there in the thicket dwells a maiden, and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> but <b>get</b> her to lend you one-half of her porch-door I am certain that it will hold together." [...] So they again sent a messenger to the thicket, and begged so prettily for the loan of the gilded porch-door of which the attorney had told them that they got it at once. They were just setting out again, but now the horses were not able to draw the coach. They had six horses already, and now they put in eight, and then ten, and then twelve, but the more they put in, and the more the coachman whipped them, the less good it did; and the coach never stirred from the spot. It was already beginning to be late in the day, and to church they must and would go, so everyone who was in the palace {{was in a state of}} distress. Then the bailiff spoke up and said: [...] "Out there in the gilded cottage in the thicket dwells a girl, and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> but <b>get</b> her to lend you her calf I know it could draw the coach, even if it were as heavy as a mountain." [...] They all thought that it was ridiculous to be drawn to church by a calf, but there was nothing else for it but to send a messenger once more, and beg as prettily as they could, on behalf of the King, that she would let them have the loan of the calf that the bailiff had told them about. The Master-maid let them have it immediately--this time also she would not say [...] "no." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I {{have had}} nothing this morning, Denis; and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> me {{a cup of}} tea and some bread and butter, if it is not against the rules, I should be very glad." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "By Saint Anne of Beaupre," [...] exclaimed Du Lhut, [...] "I {{think it}} would be well <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> your men out of this also, for I cannot see how it is to be held until morning." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing, sir," [...] said Frank. He {{paused for}} a moment, and then resumed--"Well, there is {{something}} that perhaps you could do, sir. I have a little brother out of employment; <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> him a situation, sir." ...|$|E
50|$|When the Danish {{producers}} finally realised {{that they}} could not keep Coca-Cola out of the Danish market anymore, they quickly changed their strategy. In January 1959 18 breweries and producers of mineral water went together to form ‘Dansk Coladrik A/S’. This initiative was instigated by Carlsberg and Tuborg so as to produce an original Danish cola that was to be sold nationwide. The soft drink was named Jolly Cola and was an all-out copy product. This regarded not only the taste, but also the organisation behind the product, which completely resembled Coca-Cola, especially in terms of having a strong and centralised control of quality and marketing, combined with local bottling departments. Suddenly, the strategy seemed to be that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> not <b>get</b> rid of Coca-Cola, the least <b>you</b> <b>could</b> do was to ensure that the Danish population drank Danish produced cola. To a great extent, this was a success, and when the taxation was removed and ‘the great Danish cola war’ broke out in July 1959, Jolly Cola actually conquered {{a significant part of the}} new market.|$|R
50|$|This success inspires Otway and {{his fans}} {{to try to}} give him what he most desires - a second hit and how retail stores try to prevent Otway from {{achieving}} this. Interviewees explain that back in 2002, downloads did not count towards chart position, only sales through the shops. This market was dominated by the big retail chains of Woolworths, Asda, WHSmith and Tesco. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> not <b>get</b> your single into these stores, you were very unlikely to have a hit. Sadly for Otway, none of these stores would take the single. However an orchestrated fan campaign saw Bunsen Burner reach number nine in the UK Charts. It is then revealled that despite this success and an appearance on the BBC's flagship music programme Top of the Pops, Woolworths still refuse to stock Otway's single and place their own choice of number nine in their displays. The audience also find out how Otway's Hit campaign inspires Jon Morter to try to get Rage Against the Machine the coveted Christmas number one in 2009.|$|R
60|$|Not {{another word}} about myself, dear children. This {{narrative}} doth already bristle with I's, {{as though it}} were an Argus which is a flash of wit, though I doubt if ye will understand it. I set myself to tell ye the tale of the war in the West, and that tale ye have heard, nor will I be coaxed or cajoled into one word further. Ah! ye know well how garrulous the old man is, and that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> but <b>get</b> to Flushing with him he would take ye to the wars of the Empire, to William's Court, and to the second invasion of the West, which had a better outcome than the first. But not an inch further will I budge. On to the green, ye young rogues! Have ye not other limbs to exercise besides your ears, that ye should be so fond of squatting round grandad's chair? If I am spared to next winter, and if the rheumatiz keeps away, it is like that I may take up once more the broken thread of my story.|$|R
