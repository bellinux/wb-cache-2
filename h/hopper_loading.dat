50|$|At {{the time}} {{manufacture}} ceased, metal {{had been cut}} on the next evolution, this being the Cropmaster 300. The existing wing was to be retained with the span increased to 37 ft (11.28 m). The tail group was to remain unchanged. The tailwheel configuration was retained although new oleo legs to handle the heavier take-off weight were required. New plastic fuel tanks, still mounted between {{the front and rear}} wing spars, were of 21.5 imperial gallons capacity each, giving a total capacity of 43 gallons (195 lit.). Therefore, the practical working endurance remained at two hours or so. The fuselage was an all new design optimized for the topdressing role. The hopper remained in the same position but was of considerably increased capacity. <b>Hopper</b> <b>load</b> on topdressing would have varied between 12 and 17 cwt. (611/865 kg). The area from the hopper to the tail was to be of monocoque construction with an access hatch to permit loading of cargo/work equipment or (no doubt) the odd passenger. The cockpit section forward of the hopper was to be built on a steel tube frame and featured side by side seating for the pilot and a passenger (typically the landholder or the loader driver).|$|R

50|$|The {{new plant}} also {{included}} two elevators of steel construction and a 30 feet by 4 feet picking belt. The picking belt {{was used to}} facilitate the removal, by hand, of rock from the coal. Oversized pieces of coal could also be manually crushed with hammers. Elsewhere, skip haulage and hand-picking became obsolete but at Acland these methods continued to be used until the mine's closure.

50|$|With the {{construction}} of the coal facility, railroad <b>hopper</b> cars <b>loaded</b> with coal could be brought directly by way of carfloat, where a locomotive hauled the hopper car(s) off the carfloat and brought it up an incline and placed it in the elevated coal facility.

40|$|For the {{estimation}} of the sedimentation process in TSHD’s a number of models have been developed. The oldest model used is the Camp (1946) model which was developed for sewage and water treatment tanks. Camp and Dobbins added the influence of turbulence based on the two-dimensional advection-diffusion equation, resulting in rather complicated equations. Groot (1981) added the effects of hindered settling. Miedema & Vlasblom (1996) simplified the Camp equations by means of regression and included a rising sediment zone, as well as hindered settling and erosion and an adjustable overflow. Van Rhee (2001) modified the implementation of erosion in the Camp model, but concluded that the influence is small due to {{the characteristics of the}} model. Ooijens added the time effect, since the previous models assume an instantaneous response of the settling efficiency on the inflow of mixture. Yagi (1970) developed a new model based on the concentration distribution in open channel flow. Lately Miedema & van Rhee (2007) made a comparison between the Camp model and the sophisticated 2 DV model of van Rhee (2002) which showed that especially the overflow losses match. In 2008 Miedema added non-linear effects to the Camp model, such as the behavior of the layer of water above the overflow and an analytical model to determine scour. The loading process of TSHD’s contains a number of non-linearity’s: 1. The real <b>hopper</b> <b>load</b> parameter will vary during the loading process. 2. The turbulence settling efficiency. 3. The behavior of the layer of water above the overflow. 4. The behavior of hindered settling. 5. The effective concentration in the hopper. 6. The so called storage effect. Based on all these non-linearity’s it is not expected that TSHD’s can be scaled easily, however the research in this paper shows that with the right choice of scale laws the TSHD’s can be scaled rather well. 4 TSHD’s are chosen, derived from Miedema & van Rhee (2007), but adapted to the scale laws.

50|$|Each caboose-working cycle {{began with}} the picking up {{of a string of}} 34 empty hopper wagons and a guard’s van in Bloemfontein. These were worked through to Postmasburg, with the engines recoaling at Kamfersdam outside Kimberley. At Postmasburg they picked up 34 <b>loaded</b> <b>hopper</b> wagons and a guard’s van, an {{approximate}} load of 2,700 tons, and worked all the way through to Kroonstad, where the loads were re-marshalled into 1,500 ton bites for the 1 in 66 (1½%) grades east of there to Harrismith. At Kroonstad the <b>loaded</b> <b>hoppers</b> were exchanged for empties and the whole cycle repeated. Recoaling points were at Postmasburg, Kamfersdam, Hamilton and Kroonstad and en route rewatering points were at Kloofeind and Glen. It took roughly two days to complete a loaded-empty cycle over the full route and an average of ten cycles were managed on each three-week tour of duty. Caboose-working was always with pairs of Class 23 locomotives, until the Class 25 condensers took over the section from Postmasburg to Kamfers Dam c. 1962 and the practice was discontinued. After electrification of the Postmasburg branch late in 1966, steam only came on at Beaconsfield and crews and engines were once more being changed in the traditional manner at Bloemfontein, Kroonstad and Bethlehem.|$|R
50|$|This {{method of}} cooking, known as {{indirect}} (or convection) cooking {{is also used}} by traditional charcoal and wood smokers. That similarity, {{and the fact that}} wood pellets produce smoke that flavors food, resulted in many early adopters turning to pellet grills as an easy-to-use alternative to traditional smokers. Joe Traeger worked to combine the best elements of gas and charcoal grills. The Traeger Grill revolutionized smoking by bringing the ability to slow-cook authentic BBQ to the masses with simplicity and convenience. Like a gas grill, Traeger Grills has a continuous fuel source—once the <b>hopper</b> is <b>loaded</b> with pellets, the auger repeatedly and automatically feeds them into the fire pot at predetermined intervals. The ability to cook at a relatively consistent temperature for hours without tending physical coal or wood fires appealed to BBQers who had become accustomed to tending smokers during long day or overnight cooks.|$|R

When emptying the drum, the direction of rotation is reversed.|$|R

5000|$|Lift-equipped {{trucks are}} {{referred}} to as automated side loaders, or ASL's. Similar to a front-end loader, the waste is compacted by an oscillating packer plate {{at the front of the}} <b>loading</b> <b>hopper</b> which forces the waste through an aperture into the main body and is therefore compacted towards the rear of the truck. [...] An Automated Side Loader only needs one operator, where a traditional rear load garbage truck may require two or three people, and has the additional advantage of reducing on the job injuries due to repetitive heavy lifting. Due to these advantages, ASL's have become more popular than traditional manual collection. Typically an Automated Side Loader uses standardized wheeled carts compatible with the truck's automated lift.|$|R
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Since {{the era of}} industrialization, the {{handling}} of materials in bulk form has become a necessary process {{for a range of}} industries throughout the world. Bulk handling and storage facilities should be designed and operated to obtain both maximum reliability and efficiency as well as encourage economy. A better understanding of the stress field and arching behavior and an accurate assessment of the bin wall pressure are essential steps to achieving reliable design of the storage bins or the feeder system. To date, the determination of the critical mass-flow hopper opening dimensions to prevent blockages due to the formation of stable, cohesive arches has been based on the radial stress field generated in the lower region of the <b>hopper.</b> The surcharge <b>loads</b> on the <b>hopper</b> have not been taken into account. Non-linear effects caused by the <b>hopper</b> surcharge <b>loads</b> in mass-flow analysis need to be addressed. In this study, a large number of experiments were conducted to investigate the influence of the surcharge pressure and the filling level on the hopper wall pressure during arching. The failure mechanism of the arches is discussed by means of studying the arch profile in the mass-flow hopper. In this study, to ensure efficient feeding, the hopper and feeder geometry are designed as an integral unit. The stress field at the hopper/feeder interface is of particular interest due to the role that it plays in estimating the feeder loads. In reality, the two-dimensional stress field assumed in the mass-flow hopper is influenced by the shear force due to the feeder operation. The combination of the active stress field and the passive stress field in the mass-flow hopper is suggested. This study also attempts to provide an accurate estimation of the feeder loads by investigating the feeder loads given by a combination of two methods. Apart from the comparisons between the experimental and theoretical results, numerical simulations using the discrete element method were carried out additionally to assist in the investigation of the hopper wall pressures and feeder loads. The influences of the various parameters on the hopper wall pressure, such as filling heights and outlet dimensions, are presented in this thesis. For the feeder system, the effects of the clearance between the hopper and feeder, the belt speed and other areas are also studied...|$|R
50|$|Each {{hopper car}} had wheels that were {{equipped}} with an ordinary air brake. The air brakes consist of a metal shoe that presses against the flange of the wheels when the air brakes are activated. The slower a wheel moves, the more efficiently the friction can convert to traction instead of heat. The faster a wheel moves, the more efficiently friction converts the other way around. Thus, air brakes work optimally when traveling at speeds under 25 mph as this is {{the speed at which}} traction is gained more than heat via the input of friction. The effectiveness of the air brakes on MJLBP-11's fully <b>loaded</b> <b>hopper</b> cars (100 tons each on a 2.2% grade) would have had only a limited effect on the braking potential of the train, becoming exponentially weaker and hotter as the speed of the train increased.|$|R
