5|$|Fatty acids {{are made}} by <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> synthases that {{polymerize}} and then reduce acetyl-CoA units. The acyl chains in the fatty acids are extended by a cycle of reactions that add the acyl group, reduce it to an alcohol, dehydrate it to an alkene group and then reduce it again to an alkane group.

5|$|Mitochondria-mediated {{oxidative}} stress {{plays a role}} in cardiomyopathy in Type 2 diabetics. Increased <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> delivery to the heart increases <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> uptake by cardiomyocytes, resulting in increased <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> oxidation in these cells. This process increases the reducing equivalents available to the electron transport chain of the mitochondria, ultimately increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. ROS increases uncoupling proteins (UCPs) and potentiate proton leakage through the adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT), the combination of which uncouples the mitochondria. Uncoupling then increases oxygen consumption by the mitochondria, compounding the increase in <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> oxidation. This creates a vicious cycle of uncoupling; furthermore, even though oxygen consumption increases, ATP synthesis does not increase proportionally because the mitochondria is uncoupled. Less ATP availability ultimately results in an energy deficit presenting as reduced cardiac efficiency and contractile dysfunction. To compound the problem, impaired sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release and reduced mitochondrial reuptake limits peak cytosolic levels of the important signaling ion during muscle contraction. The decreased intra-mitochondrial calcium concentration increases dehydrogenase activation and ATP synthesis. So in addition to lower ATP synthesis due to <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> oxidation, ATP synthesis is impaired by poor calcium signaling as well, causing cardiac problems for diabetics.|$|E
5|$|Fatty acids, or <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> {{residues}} {{when they}} are part of a lipid, are a diverse group of molecules synthesized by chain-elongation of an acetyl-CoA primer with malonyl-CoA or methylmalonyl-CoA groups in a process called <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> synthesis. They are made of a hydrocarbon chain that terminates with a carboxylic acid group; this arrangement confers the molecule with a polar, hydrophilic end, and a nonpolar, hydrophobic end that is insoluble in water. The <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> structure is one of the most fundamental categories of biological lipids, and is commonly used as a building-block of more structurally complex lipids. The carbon chain, typically between four and 24 carbons long, may be saturated or unsaturated, and may be attached to functional groups containing oxygen, halogens, nitrogen, and sulfur. If a <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> contains a double bond, there is the possibility of either a cis or trans geometric isomerism, which significantly affects the molecule's configuration. Cis-double bonds cause the <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> chain to bend, an effect that is compounded with more double bonds in the chain. Three double bonds in 18-carbon linolenic acid, the most abundant fatty-acyl chains of plant thylakoid membranes, render these membranes highly fluid despite environmental low-temperatures, and also makes linolenic acid give dominating sharp peaks in high resolution 13-C NMR spectra of chloroplasts. This in turn plays an important role in the structure and function of cell membranes. Most naturally occurring fatty acids are of the cis configuration, although the trans form does exist in some natural and partially hydrogenated fats and oils.|$|E

5|$|Beta {{oxidation}} is {{the metabolic}} {{process by which}} fatty acids are broken down in the mitochondria or in peroxisomes to generate acetyl-CoA. For the most part, fatty acids are oxidized by a mechanism that is similar to, but not identical with, {{a reversal of the}} process of <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> synthesis. That is, two-carbon fragments are removed sequentially from the carboxyl end of the acid after steps of dehydrogenation, hydration, and oxidation to form a beta-keto acid, which is split by thiolysis. The acetyl-CoA is then ultimately converted into ATP, CO2, and H2O using the citric acid cycle and the electron transport chain. Hence the citric acid cycle can start at acetyl-CoA when fat is being broken down for energy if {{there is little or no}} glucose available. The energy yield of the complete oxidation of the <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> palmitate is 106 ATP. Unsaturated and odd-chain fatty acids require additional enzymatic steps for degradation.|$|E
