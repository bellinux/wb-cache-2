5|$|Tyrannosaurus {{had very}} large {{olfactory}} bulbs and olfactory nerves {{relative to their}} brain size, the organs responsible for {{a heightened sense of}} smell. This suggests that the sense of smell was <b>highly</b> <b>developed,</b> and implies that tyrannosaurs could detect carcasses by scent alone across great distances. The sense of smell in tyrannosaurs may have been comparable to modern vultures, which use scent to track carcasses for scavenging. Research on the olfactory bulbs has shown that Tyrannosaurus rex had the most <b>highly</b> <b>developed</b> sense of smell of 21 sampled non-avian dinosaur species.|$|E

40|$|This paper appraises {{the efforts}} of {{official}} creditors to help <b>highly</b> indebted <b>developing</b> countries escape the vicious cycle of debt unsustainability. It examines three major models through which <b>highly</b> indebted <b>developing</b> countries were assisted to achieve debt sustainability, namely; the Baker Plan, the Brady Plan and the Highly Indebted Poor Countries Initiative. In spite of the huge monetary costs incurred to run these programmes, debt sustainability {{continues to be a}} major challenge for most of the economies that benefitted from debt relief. The example of Ghana, a beneficiary of the Highly Indebted Poor Countries Initiative is highlighted to support the general evidence from literature. <b>Highly</b> indebted <b>developing</b> countries certainly need more than debt relief, and it is probably becoming clearer that money {{may not be the most}} important need of developing economies...|$|R

While feeding, one individual {{stays on the}} lookout for danger, often standing on a termite mound to see farther. At times of danger, the whole herd flees in a single file after an individual suddenly starts off. Adult hartebeest are preyed upon by lions, leopards, hyenas and wild dogs; cheetahs and jackals target juveniles. Crocodiles may also prey on hartebeest.|$|E

Their behavior is inconsistent, and their thoughts and motivations are rarely stated.
