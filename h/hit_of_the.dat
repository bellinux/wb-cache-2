5|$|The pilot {{movie was}} {{followed}} by 26 episodes, each 45 minutes long and airing at 8:00pm on Fridays. Fox Entertainment chief Sandy Grushaw openly touted Brisco and its star Bruce Campbell. The network fully expected the show to be its breakout <b>hit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> year, a distinction which eventually went to Briscos follow-up, The X-Files. Hoping that more viewers would follow Brisco as it progressed, Fox approved producing an entire season of the show, despite post-pilot low ratings. Subsequent episodes failed to attract more viewers and the show was cancelled at end of its first and only season. After the series ended, Fox retransmitted the show on Sunday nights at 8:00pm during July and August 1994. The show was later broadcast {{for a short time}} in syndication, airing on the U.S. cable channel TNT.|$|E
5|$|Venable played {{basketball}} for Princeton University, {{as well as}} San Rafael High School. He was the second athlete to earn first-team All-Ivy League honors in both baseball and basketball. In the 2005 MLB Draft, the Padres selected Venable in the seventh round. He made his major league debut on August 29, 2008, against the Colorado Rockies, collecting his first hit. Although he broke into the Major Leagues as a center fielder, he has played mostly right field since his second season. Venable has frequently batted lead off and has on several occasions come within one <b>hit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cycle. , he has finished among the top ten in the National League in triples four times and in stolen bases twice. He has the most Major League Baseball career hits and home runs of any Princeton alumnus.|$|E
5|$|With {{the success}} of Bride, Laemmle was eager to put Whale to work on Dracula's Daughter (1936), the sequel to Universal's first big horror <b>hit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sound era. Whale, wary of doing two horror films {{in a row and}} {{concerned}} that directing Dracula's Daughter could interfere with his plans for the first all-sound version of Show Boat (previously filmed as a part-talkie by Harry A. Pollard), instead convinced Laemmle to buy the rights to a novel called The Hangover Murders. The novel is a comedy-mystery in the style of The Thin Man, about a group of friends who were so drunk the night one of them was murdered that none can remember anything. Retitled Remember Last Night?, the film was one of Whale's personal favorites, but met with sharply divided reviews and commercial disinterest.|$|E

5|$|Casualties in {{the battle}} were very heavy on both sides, and historians such as William James have noted that the losses among the British ships were {{proportionally}} much higher than when British fleets met French or Spanish opposition. This was attributed to the Dutch tactics, mirrored by the British, of firing at the enemy hulls rather than attempting to disable their masts and rigging as in other continental navies. The worst <b>hit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> British ships were those in the first wave, such as Ardent with 148 casualties, Monarch with 136 and Belliqueux with 103, while both Adamant and Agincourt escaped without a single man killed or wounded. Among the dead were Captain Burges of Ardent and two lieutenants, while the wounded included Captain Essington of Triumph and twelve lieutenants. In total, British losses were recorded after the battle as 203 killed and 622 wounded, although later assessments based on charitable requirements of those wounded or killed gave the higher figures of 228 killed and 812 wounded, including 16 of the latter who subsequently died. Many of the British ships were badly damaged, taking on large quantities of water through damaged hulls. One of the worst hit was Venerable, {{which had to be}} completely dismantled and reconstructed after returning to Britain before the ship was ready for active service again.|$|E
5|$|Davis's 50th {{home run}} of the season, which he hit on September 13, tied him with Brady Anderson for the Orioles record of most home runs in a single season. He also became only the third player in MLB history, after Babe Ruth (New York Yankees, 1921) and Albert Belle (Cleveland Indians, 1995), to hit 50 home runs and 40 doubles in a single season. He hit his 51st home run on September 17, setting a new Orioles single season record. This was also his 92nd extra-base <b>hit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> season, again tying Anderson for a {{franchise}} record. He later surpassed that by hitting his first triple of the season against Alex Cobb on September 21 in a 51 loss to Tampa Bay. Davis broke another Orioles record on September 27 with his 28th home {{run of the}} season hit at his home park of Camden Yards, surpassing Frank Robinson's record of 27 home runs hit at Memorial Stadium in 1966.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{weakening}} to {{a severe}} tropical storm before landfall, Prapiroon brought torrential rains and flooding which left 88 people dead and eight others missing. About 10million people {{were affected by}} the typhoon, while 30,000 homes collapsed and 140,000 others were damaged. Damages from the typhoon were estimated at $984million (2006USD; $1.1billion 2008USD). Guangdong Province was the hardest <b>hit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three provinces affected by Typhoon Prapiroon. About 3.72million people were affected by the storm and 7,000 homes were destroyed in the province. A tornado struck Foshan, Shanwei and Shaoguan, killing nine. A police officer was killed when a landslide buried him during a rescue in Sihui. Another hard hit province, Guangxi, was struck by Prapiroon. About 5.1million people were affected by the storm and 219,441 were displaced. Ten people were killed by a flash flood and landslide in Laibin and Hengxian. Another flash flood swept away a shelter which thirteen migrant workers resided in, {{all of whom were}} confirmed to have been killed. Three more people were killed when a landslide caused their home to collapse in Luming Village. About 9,300 homes and 195,900 hectares of farmland were destroyed.|$|E

5|$|In late 1945 {{and early}} 1946 Gielgud toured for ENSA in the Middle and Far East with Hamlet and Coward's Blithe Spirit. During this tour he played Hamlet on {{stage for the}} last time. He was Raskolnikoff in a stage version of Crime and Punishment, in the West End in 1946 and on Broadway the {{following}} year. Agate thought it the best thing Gielgud had done so far, other than Hamlet. Between these two engagements Gielgud toured North America in The Importance of Being Earnest and Love for Love. Edith Evans was tired {{of the role of}} Lady Bracknell, and refused to join him; Margaret Rutherford played the part to great acclaim. Gielgud was in demand as a director, with six productions in 1948–49. They included The Heiress in 1949, when he was brought in at the last moment to direct Richardson and Ashcroft, saving what seemed a doomed production; it ran for 644 performances. His last big <b>hit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1940s was as Thomas Mendip in The Lady's Not for Burning, which he also directed. The London cast included the young Claire Bloom and Richard Burton, who went with Gielgud when he took the piece to the US the following year.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the game, First Lady Michelle Obama and Second Lady Jill Biden escorted former Yankees catcher and World War II veteran Yogi Berra to the mound, {{where the}} {{ceremonial}} first pitch was thrown by {{a veteran of}} the Iraq War. The Phillies' Ryan Howard got the first <b>hit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 2009 World Series by doubling in the first inning. Howard was stranded in the first and the game was scoreless after two innings. The Phillies scored first with a two-out solo home run by Chase Utley {{in the top of the}} third inning. Through the first five innings, Philadelphia starting pitcher Cliff Lee allowed no runs and three hits, striking out seven Yankees batters. In the top of the sixth, Utley hit another solo home run to give the Phillies a 2–0 lead. The starting pitchers Lee and CC Sabathia continued to pitch until the top of the eighth when Sabathia was replaced by Phil Hughes. Hughes walked the first two batters and was replaced by Dámaso Marte. Marte got two quick outs and was relieved by David Robertson, who walked Jayson Werth and gave up a two-run single to Raúl Ibañez. The Phillies added two more runs in the ninth with an RBI single by Shane Victorino and an RBI double by Howard. Lee finished with a complete game allowing one unearned run on six hits and striking out ten batters, not walking any of the hitters he faced.|$|E
5|$|The player {{controls}} paddles {{along the}} screen's edges to knock a bouncing ball, Kirby, into destructible bricks. The player loses a life if Kirby hits {{the edge of}} the screen. Each of the game's eleven stages include five rounds of increasingly complex block patterns for Kirby to clear. The ten different block types vary in durability and points value. A well-timed <b>hit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> paddle gives Kirby a powerful bounce to break through harder blocks. Another block type turns the remaining blocks into a bonus round that rewards the player for clearing the screen in the least amount of time. The player can find warp stars that lead to minigames, such as air hockey, where the player can earn extra lives. The rounds also include enemies to attack and avoid. Some enemies contain bonus items. Each stage ends in a boss fight.|$|E

5|$|Three of {{his five}} postseason home runs broke up no-hitters. His home run off the Braves' Derek Lowe was the Giants' first hit in Game 4 of the NLDS. His first home run off Halladay in Game 1 of the NLCS, in {{addition}} to being the first hit off Halladay in the game, was the first hit off Halladay in 11 innings, as Halladay had thrown a no-hitter in his previous start. Finally, his home run off Oswalt in Game 2 of the NLCS was the Giants' first <b>hit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game. In Game 3 of the World Series against the Texas Rangers, he hit the first home run for the Giants off Colby Lewis; however, the Giants went on to lose 4–2. He won his first World Series ring as the Giants defeated the Rangers in five games to win their first World Series since 1954.|$|E
5|$|Wong {{continued}} to be offered exotic supporting roles, playing indigenous native girls in two 1924 films. Filmed on location in the Territory of Alaska she portrayed an Eskimo in The Alaskan. She returned to Los Angeles to perform the part of Princess Tiger Lily in Peter Pan. Both films were shot by cinematographer James Wong Howe but Peter Pan was more successful; the <b>hit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Christmas season. The next year, Wong was singled out for critical praise in a manipulative Oriental vamp role in the film Forty Winks. Despite such favorable reviews, she became increasingly disappointed with her casting and began to seek other roads to success. In early 1925 she joined a group of serial stars {{on a tour of}} the vaudeville circuits; when the tour proved to be a failure, Wong and the rest of the group returned to Hollywood.|$|E
5|$|Dyer was {{a popular}} choice with boxing promoters, helped {{by the fact that}} after each bout he would sing Thora, a popular <b>hit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> day to the audience. His careers as a pugilist and {{baritone}} earned him the nickname, 'The Singing Boxer'. His first few bouts were all held in south Wales, but by the autumn of 1910 he was travelling to England to fight, and on 10 October 1910 he was invited to fight at the National Sporting Club in Covent Garden, London. On 15 May 1911 Dyer was scheduled to fight Dick Emden at The Ring in Blackfriars, London. To date, Dyer had recorded over 15 bouts and was unbeaten but the fight with Emden ended in defeat and affected his future boxing career. Dyer was easily ahead in the bout, when in the fifth round he dislocated his knee and fell to the canvas in agony. Emden, who taunted the fallen Dyer, was given the victory and Dyer would not fight for another six months. The injury to his right knee plagued Dyer throughout his entire boxing career, and also stopped him serving in the armed forces during the First World War. After the injury, Dyer always fought with a protector strapped around his knee, and was forced to change his fighting style. He would always stand on the toes of his right foot, as a quick back step could possibly dislocate his knee again. His return bout in November 1911 was a win against Young Lilley at The Ring, but this was again followed by a long absence. Dyer did not fight again until 1 June 1912.|$|E
