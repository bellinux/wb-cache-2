40|$|Most {{critical}} analyses assess citizenship deprivation policies against {{international human}} rights and domestic rule of law standards, such as prevention of statelessness, non-arbitrariness with regard to justifications and judicial remedies, or non-discrimination between different categories of citizens. This paper considers citizenship deprivation policies instead from a political theory perspective [...] how deprivation policies reflect specific conceptions of political community. We distinguish four normative conceptions of the grounds of membership in a political community that apply to decisions on acquisition and loss of citizenship status: a 'State discretion' view, an 'individual choice' view, an 'ascriptive community' view, and a 'genuine link' view. We argue that most citizenship laws combine these four normative views, but that from a democratic perspective the 'genuine link' view is most preferable. The paper subsequently examines five general grounds for citizenship withdrawal [...] threats to public security, non-compliance with citizenship duties, flawed acquisition, derivative loss, and loss of <b>genuine</b> <b>links</b> [...] and considers how the four normative views apply to withdrawal provision motivated by these concerns. The final Part examines whether European Union (EU) citizenship provides additional reasons for protection against Member States' powers of citizenship deprivation. We suggest that, in addition to fundamental rights protection through EU law and protection of free movement rights, three further arguments could be invoked: toleration of dual citizenship in a political union, prevention of unequal conditions for loss among EU citizens, and the salience of <b>genuine</b> <b>links</b> to the EU itself rather than merely to one of its Member States...|$|R

5000|$|Marine cloud {{brightening}} activities {{would be}} furthered {{governed by the}} international law of sea, and particularly by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). Parties to the UNCLOS are obligated to [...] "protect and preserve the marine environment," [...] including by preventing, reducing, and controlling pollution of the marine environment from any source. The [...] "marine environment" [...] is not defined but is widely interpreted as including the ocean's water, lifeforms, and the air above. [...] "Pollution of the marine environment" [...] is defined {{in a way that}} includes global warming and greenhouse gases. The UNCLOS could thus be interpreted as obligating it Parties to use methods such as marine cloud brightening if these were found to be effective and environmentally benign. Whether marine cloud brightening itself could be such pollution of the marine environment is unclear. At the same time, in combating pollution, Parties are [...] "not to transfer, directly or indirectly, damage or hazards from one area to another or transform one type of pollution into another." [...] If marine cloud brightening were found to cause damage or hazards, the UNCLOS could prohibit it. If marine cloud brightening activities were to be [...] "marine scientific research"—also an undefined term—then UNCLOS Parties have a right to conduct the research, subject to some qualifications. Like all other ships, those that would conduct marine cloud brightening must bear the flag of the country that has given them permission to do so and to which the ship has a <b>genuine</b> <b>link,</b> even if the ship is unmanned or automated. The flagged state must exercise its jurisdiction over those ships. The legal implications would depend on, among other things, whether the activity were to occur in territorial waters, an exclusive economic zone (EEZ), or the high seas; and whether the activity was scientific research or not. Coastal states would need to approve any marine cloud brightening activities in their territorial waters. In the EEZ, the ship must comply with the coastal state's laws and regulations. It appears that the state conducting marine cloud brightening activities in another state's EEZ would not need the latter's permission, unless the activity were marine scientific research. In that case, the coastal state should grant permission in normal circumstances. States would be generally free to conduct marine cloud brightening activities on the high seas, provided that this is done with [...] "due regard" [...] for other states' interests. There is some legal unclarity regarding unmanned or automated ships.|$|E

40|$|During {{the last}} decade, our {{knowledge}} of the taxonomic diversity of the Early Cretaceous ichthyosaurs (Mesozoic marine reptiles) has increased significantly, with the recognition of new species, genera, and subfamilies from Canada, Europe, and Russia. New data from England, France, and western Russia suggest ichthyosaurs remained diverse and abundant in western Eurasian marine ecosystems up to the late Albian–early Cenomanian, with the co-occurrence of three to four taxa occupying two to three distinct ecological niches in each formation considered (Cambridge Greensand Member, England; Marnes Bleues Formation, France; Stoïlensky quarry, Russia). However, the overlying formations (middle–late Cenomanian), consisting of chalk or glauconiferous sands, have yielded a very depauperate ichthyosaur fauna. These ichthyosaur assemblages are monospecific and comprise medium to large-sized, presumably opportunistic predators belonging the genus Platypterygius. This suggests a severe drop in ichthyosaur diversity some 5 millions years before their final extinction, which presumably occurred at or near the Cenomanian–Turonian boundary. However, {{it is difficult to know}} if this pattern is biased or genuine: the diversity drop may very well be an effect of preservational/ecological biases as well as a <b>genuine</b> extinction <b>linked</b> to the profound environmental changes occurring during the Cenomanian.

40|$|The {{so called}} refugee crisis of 2015 had several effects, among which the {{definitive}} {{demonstration of the}} unsustainability of the Dublin system and the need of a radical change in the modalities of allocation of the competence for the exam of asylum claims in the EU. The same credibility of the EU is at stake, {{as well as the}} capacities of national governments to manage the relevant flows reaching the Schengen area. This Policy Brief provides sound arguments both for supporting the demand for a new legal framework, and for the determination of new criteria which combines fairness, realism, solidarity, cooperation. A quota approach would be combined with a “genuine link” approach, thus trying to find a proper balance between the States’ interests and the point of view (and related behaviors) of asylum seekers, and also between the objections of human rights defenders and the concerns of European public opinion. The need to turn the page with the Dublin age warmly suggests to choose, for the new proposed regulation, a nick name which evokes the features of the current historical (and dramatic) passage of European integration and our deep sense of belonging to a place where much part of our way of thinking and of being a society is rooted: Athens. Having regard to the lessons learnt from decades of regulation of the determination of jurisdiction in civil, commercial and criminal matters, a first step to take is the adoption of a new conception for the role of the asylum seeker, who should be allocated to the State with which he/she holds a substantial link: the configuration of the relevant connecting factors (family relations; economic or social ties) should pay due regard to the empirical dimension of the phenomenon and to the need to avoid unnecessary sufferance and waste of public funds and time. If the asylum seeker has <b>genuine</b> <b>links</b> with more States, a certain relevance to his/her free choice should be awarded. Lacking any connection with a given country, the State with the lowest performance in fulfilling its reference quota should be the competent one. In the same time, an already overburdened country should be afforded the possibility to refuse responsibility, provided that some basic family ties are safeguarded. In such cases, a less connected country should be responsible, or the one less engaged in hosting asylum seekers and refugees, or as extrema ratio the country of first entrance or where the application is lodged. Whether an asylum seeker is allocated to a country where he/she does not have any substantial link and his/her asylum claim receives a positive outcome, the possibility of accepting a genuine job offer in another Member State should be admitted. This way, a partial freedom of circulation for work purposes could be recognized, but its exercise would relieve the first Member State by protection duties.
