40|$|Abstract—This paper {{introduces}} web-based <b>interactive</b> <b>Linked</b> Micromap (LM) plots, a set {{of dynamic}} visualization methods that allows readers to interactively select variables and modify the different views to help reveal relationships among the study units. This methodology provided the foundation for web-based micromaps used by the National Cancer Institute (NCI). This illustrates the power of visualization to make statistical summaries involving health and risk factors {{for millions of people}} accessible to health planners than may have never had a statistics class. LM plots methodology is in use by the Department of Agriculture and readily extend to other application in other agencies in the United States. The interactive methods can be as useful in such extensions as they were for the National Cancer Institute. Index Terms — <b>Interactive</b> visualization, <b>Linked</b> Microma...|$|R

5000|$|Challenge-response {{protocols}} {{assume a}} direct <b>interactive</b> <b>link</b> between the requester (client) and the provider (server). The provider chooses a challenge, say an item {{in a set}} with a property, the requester finds the relevant response in the set, which is sent back and checked by the provider. As the challenge is chosen on the spot by the provider, its difficulty {{can be adapted to}} its current load. The work on the requester side may be bounded if the challenge-response protocol has a known solution (chosen by the provider), or is known to exist within a bounded search space.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the interface conception for a mobile, location-based map application, and the user-centred design approach used to validate design principles. We suggests design guidelines for interactive maps {{that were used}} for prototypes for a mobile fair guide. Abstract and simplified visualizations were combined with <b>interactive</b> <b>linking</b> to textual information, especially hidden labels for map objects that can be displayed in tooltips. Usability test results show {{this to be a}} promising strategy, if the hidden labels are combined with support of use cases that include search for known objects...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} dynamic and <b>interactive</b> <b>links</b> between the {{development}} of children’s language phonological awareness, and reading. Some of the key issues explored are procedures to enhance children’s language development, decoding and word recognition skills, along with some relevant assessment and programming strategies that can facilitate children’s early reading development. In particular, the paper supports the suggestion that deficits in phonological awareness are often a consequence of slow vocabulary development (a classic marker of language delay) and that {{teachers need to be}} able to adapt their language and dialogue interactions for children with language delays...|$|R
40|$|This {{perspective}} {{provides a}} commentary {{on the quality of}} life improvements made available from advances in medical device technology. An opinion of the elements necessary to bring innovation into medical device research is offered. In order to enhance the output of medical device research, strong <b>interactive</b> <b>links</b> are needed between clinicians and researchers to ensure research activities are focused on the needs of patients. Alliances with industry umbrella groups can support these links and facilitate the commercialization of new ideas generated from the research. Several forecasts for the medical device market obtained from other sources are also presented...|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Interactive</b> <b>Link</b> product suite is a commercialized {{version of}} Starlight Technology. This technology, {{developed}} {{as a way to}} transfer data from a lower classification (Low Side) network to a highly classified (High Side) computer without compromising sensitive information, was formed inside the Australian DSTO as a research project. The technology also allowed users to view and interact on a Low Side network from a High Side computer. The Starlight Technology included a data diode, accompanying server software and Desktop-based equipment. Seen as having commercial merit and after a prototype was developed, the technology was licensed to Vision Abell (later acquired by Tenix) in 1996 for development and supply to Australian government under the brand “Interactive Link”. [...] The objective of these products was to increase productivity and to reduce the deskspace required by users working on more than one network, while not compromising the existing security.|$|E
40|$|General {{conclusions}} {{regarding the}} close links between marketing and procurement {{side of the}} marketing process would be expressed as follows: <b>Interactive</b> <b>link</b> between marketing and procurement is just proportionate {{to a level of}} company's market orientation. Establishment of an <b>interactive</b> <b>link</b> between marketing and procurement fields would reflect on pricing. Besides price competition, establishment of an integral approach through comprehensive understanding of market relations, will set up conditions for company to meet customers' needs in the most optimal way. Therefore the total result will be advanced and a company with this kind of orientation can become a market leader...|$|E
40|$|There is a {{requirement}} in defence to connect secure computing facilities to unclassified information sources such as the Internet. This is particularly so in the database arena where data stored in differently classified databases must be shared. The Starlight <b>Interactive</b> <b>Link,</b> was developed to connect computers of differing security classifications in a trusted manner to enable a one-way flow of data from the lower to the higher classified system. Using the Starlight <b>Interactive</b> <b>Link</b> we have developed methodologies for secure data transfer between databases resident on computing systems classified at different levels, and constructed a prototype demonstration system using these techniques...|$|E
40|$|There {{are many}} web-based {{visualization}} systems available to date, each having its strengths and limitations. The goals these systems {{set out to}} accomplish influence design decisions and determine how reusable and scalable they are. Weave is a new web-based visualization platform with the broad goal of enabling visualization of any available data by anyone for any purpose. Our open source framework supports highly <b>interactive</b> <b>linked</b> visualizations for users of varying skill levels.
