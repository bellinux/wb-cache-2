500|$|As {{a result}} of the controversy, in September of that year, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission {{announced}} that Canadian content rules would be changed. The new regulation allows non-Canadians to contribute up to 50% of the finished content to each of both the music and the lyrics of a recorded piece, and still qualify for Canadian content status—provided the recording artist is Canadian, or the song is recorded in Canada. [...] Accordingly, the Adams/Lange songs, and the Adams/Lange/Vallance songs on the album now count as Canadian content, as Jim Vallance is also Canadian. [...] However, the Adams/Lange/Kamen co-write [...] "(Everything I <b>Do)</b> <b>I</b> <b>Do</b> It for You" [...] still does not count as Canadian content, as two of the three writers are non-Canadians, and the track was not recorded in Canada.|$|E

500|$|After {{recording}} {{was completed}} Kannberg was tasked with releasing the music himself, as Malkmus {{had left on}} a trip to parts of Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. Kannberg designed the cover of the EP and sent copies to various independent labels, distributors, and zines. He recalled [...] "I {{had no idea how to}} do it. I'd send off these little notes to my favorite labels like SST and Twin Tone and ask, 'How <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> this?'" [...] A representative from SST recommended that Kannberg use Erica Records, a Los Angeles 7" [...] manufacturer. Erica Records became the manufacturer of Slay Tracks; however, Kannberg was unhappy with the master recording produced by the company: [...] "It sounds like it sounds now—it's just a mess—but being poor and not really caring I said, 'Okay, that's cool, if it sounds like that–whatever.'" [...] 1000 copies of Slay Tracks were pressed, and the first 50 included a green dinosaur stamp on the label. The EP was distributed on Kannberg's own Treble Kicker Records in the United States and England, although Malkmus came across a copy in a record store while visiting Austria.|$|E

500|$|The Giants {{were founded}} in 1925 by Tim Mara, a {{bookmaker}} (legal in 1925), businessman, and promoter, with {{an investment of}} US$500 after a meeting with league president Joseph Carr, and Harry March. Carr {{was sent to the}} east coast to find someone to put a team in a major city there to help the struggling league. Carr contacted Billy Gibson who was the manager of heavyweight boxer Gene Tunney and knew of Mara from Mara's interest in investing in Tunney. Mara decided to spend the $500 on the Giants as opposed to Tunney in a spur of the moment decision, and started the team with the statement, [...] "an exclusive franchise for anything in New York is worth $500." [...] His son Wellington later said that his father felt that even an empty store in the city was worth that price. Mara purchased the team, despite never having watched a single pro game, saying to the sellers at the time, [...] "Just tell me one thing. Now that I have a franchise, what <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> with it." [...] To differentiate themselves from the baseball team of the same name, they took the name [...] "New York Football Giants", which they still use as their legal corporate name.|$|E
