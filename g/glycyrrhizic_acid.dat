50|$|Licorice is {{an extract}} from the Glycyrrhiza glabra plant which {{contains}} <b>glycyrrhizic</b> <b>acid,</b> or GZA. GZA {{is made of}} one molecule of glycyrrhetic acid and two molecules of glucuronic acid.The extracts from {{the root of the}} plant can also be referred to as licorice, sweet root, and glycyrrhiza extract. G. glabra grows in subtropical climates in Europe, the Middle East, and Western Asia. When administered orally, the product of glycyrrhetic acid is found in human urine whereas GZA is not. This shows that glycyrrhetic acid is absorbed and metabolized in the intestines in humans. GZA is hydrolyzed to glycyrrhetic acid in the intestines by bacteria.For thousands of years G. glabra has been used for medicinal purposes including indigestion and stomach inflammation. Some other medicinal purposes are cough suppression, ulcer treatment, and use as a laxative. Also, salts of GZA can be used in many products as sweeteners and aromatizers. The major use of licorice goes towards the tobacco industry, at roughly 90% of usage. The rest is split evenly between food and pharmaceutics, at 5% of usage each (Federal Register, 1983). Licorice extract is often found in sweets and many candies, some drugs, and beverages like root beer. They can also be used in chewing gum, tobacco products like snuff, and toothpaste. An increase in intake of licorice can cause many toxic effects. Hyper mineralocorticosteroid syndrome can occur when the body retains sodium, loses potassium altering biochemical and hormonal activities. Some of these activities include lower aldosterone level, decline of the renin-angiotensin system and increased levels of the atrial natriuretic hormone in order to compensate the variations in homoeostasis. Some other symptoms of toxicity include electrolyte imbalance, oedema, increased blood pressure, weight gain, heart problems, and weakness. Individuals will experience certain symptoms based on the severity of toxicity. Some other complaints include fatigue, shortness of breath, renal failure, and paralysis.|$|E

The report also goes into the addictive aspects of <b>glycyrrhizic</b> <b>acid.</b> The level of <b>glycyrrhizic</b> <b>acid</b> in cigarette smoke or in tobacco products is not known. Furthermore, it is improbable that the intake of <b>glycyrrhizic</b> <b>acid</b> during cigarette smoking will exceed the daily oral intake. A point of concern {{is the nature of the}} combustion products formed during cigarette smoking. It is unlikely that smoking-related exposure to <b>glycyrrhizic</b> <b>acid</b> will increase mineralocorticoid activity and result under some conditions in hypertension. The statement that <b>glycyrrhizic</b> <b>acid</b> acts as a bronchodilatator could not be confirmed from the currently available literature. The possibility that liquorice preparations directly or indirectly increase addiction to cigarettes can not be excluded.

40|$|ABSTRACT One-year-old Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch. ex DC, Fabaceae, {{was treated}} with three {{exogenous}} phytohormones in June and July, namely gibberellin, auxin (indole- 3 -acetic acid), methyl jasmonate at different concentrations. Control plants were treated with water. Roots of controls and hormones-treated G. uralensis plants were harvested at different times, and the contents of seven main chemical components were determined. Root <b>glycyrrhizic</b> <b>acid</b> content of plants treated in June increased significantly compared with controls, and the difference was significant. As for plants treated in July, root <b>glycyrrhizic</b> <b>acid</b> content increased in which sprayed with appropriate concentrations of hormones, but the effects of hormones were more evident in plants treated in June coincided with the vigorous growth period than those treated in July. Gibberellin at 40 mg/l and auxin at 40 mg/l applied in the two treatment periods significantly promoted the accumulation of <b>glycyrrhizic</b> <b>acid</b> in G. uralensis root. Treatment with methyl jasmonate at 100 and 25 mg/l in June and July, respectively, also increased <b>glycyrrhizic</b> <b>acid</b> content significantly. The determination of major active compositions indicated that liquiritin, isoliquiritin, isoliquiritin apioside and liquiritin apioside contents were positively related to <b>glycyrrhizic</b> <b>acid</b> content.

40|$|Shaoyao-Gancao (Paeoniae Radix Alba and Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma) is a {{traditional}} Chinese drug pair widely used in decoctions for relieving pains, especially abdominal pain. We aimed to determine the intestinal absorption and interaction of three active compounds (<b>glycyrrhizic</b> <b>acid,</b> liquiritin, and paeoniflorin) in this drug pair. We investigated the transport of these compounds across intestinal epithelial cells by using the Caco- 2 cell monolayer in both the apical-to-basolateral (A-B) and B-A directions. All compounds could only travel through the Caco- 2 cell monolayer at a low level when the cells were treated with single component solutions. In the presence of verapamil, an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), the absorptive permeability (PAB) of paeoniflorin and liquiritin increased significantly (p &lt; 0. 05) and efflux ratios decreased, while the absorption of <b>glycyrrhizic</b> <b>acid</b> did not change significantly, which indicated that paeoniflorin and liquiritin might be P-gp substrates. In addition, when liquiritin and <b>glycyrrhizic</b> <b>acid</b> in Gancao extract and paeoniflorin in Shaoyao extract were examined, PAB of paeoniflorin and liquiritin were significantly higher, while <b>glycyrrhizic</b> <b>acid</b> retained the same absorption level compared to the corresponding single component solutions, which suggested that some certain ingredients in the extracts can promote the absorption of paeoniflorin and liquiritin, but not that of <b>glycyrrhizic</b> <b>acid.</b> Furthermore, compared {{to the results of}} treatment with individual extracts, treatment of cells with a mixture of the two extracts considerably increased (p &lt; 0. 05) the absorption of <b>glycyrrhizic</b> <b>acid</b> and paeoniflorin and showed no change in the absorption of liquiritin, which implied that the transport of <b>glycyrrhizic</b> <b>acid</b> and paeoniflorin is increased by some ingredients from the complementary drug in the drug pair, while that of liquiritin remains unaffected...|$|E

High levels of inflammatory cytokines cause deterioration of polycystic ovary syndrome. <b>Glycyrrhizic</b> <b>acid</b> is the most important saponins from licorice. Considering the hypoandrogenic and antioxidant properties of licorice, aim of this study was to determine the effect of <b>glycyrrhizic</b> <b>acid</b> on gonadotropins, estradiol, testosterone and inflammatory cytokines in polycystic ovarian syndrome rat model. Methods: In this experimental study, 32 wistar female rats were divided into 4 equal groups of control (saline solution, 24 days, ip), PCOS control (saline solution, 24 days, ip) and two PCOS groups under treatment with glycyrrhizic (25 and 50 mg/kg, 24 days, ip). Polycystic ovarian syndrome was induced by single intramuscular injection of estradiol valerate (4 mg/kg). At the end of treatment period, serum levels of TNF-α, IL- 1 β, IL- 6, LH, FSH, estradiol and testosterone were measured using ELISA. Data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA and Post Hoc Tukey statistical tests (p< 0. 05).

40|$|Abstract: The {{extraction}} {{and separation}} conditions of <b>glycyrrhizic</b> <b>acid</b> and glabridin from licorice were investigated. By changing the different extraction solvents, procedures, times and temperature, the optimum extraction condition was established: the used of ethanol/water (30 : 70, v/v) as an extraction solvent, and 60 min dipping time under 50 °C. The extracts of licorice were separated and determined by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography with a methanol/water (70 : 30, v/v, containing 1 % acetic acid) as the mobile phase. Under the optimum extraction condition, 2. 39 mg/g of <b>glycyrrhizic</b> <b>acid</b> and 0. 92 mg/g of glabridin were extracted from Chinese licorice and the recoveries were 89. 7 % and 72. 5 % respectively...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAlthough <b>glycyrrhizic</b> <b>acid,</b> a major {{constituent}} of licorice root, has important pharmacological effects in humans, the biological activity of <b>glycyrrhizic</b> <b>acid</b> and its aglycone glycyrrhetinic acid in plants is unknown. Here {{we report that}} these licorice-derived compounds and the analog carbenoxolone inhibit desaturation of linoleic acid (C 18 : 2 ω 6) in soybean chloroplasts using monogalactosyldiacylglycerol and phosphatidylcholine substrates in an in vitro assay for desaturase activity. At 10 nM glycyrrhetinic acid, there is significant inhibition of desaturation of linoleic acid suggesting that licorice-derived compounds could prove useful in investigating biochemical pathways of linoleic acid desaturation in plant chloroplasts and plant desaturase regulation, which has application in modification of plant response to environmental stress, as well as optimization of oil seed composition...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{present study}} {{optimized}} ultrasound-assisted extraction conditions to maximize extraction yields of <b>glycyrrhizic</b> <b>acid</b> from licorice. Methods: The optimal extraction temperature (X 1), extraction time (X 2), and methanol concentration (X 3) were identified using response surface methodology (RSM). A central composite design (CCD) {{was used for}} experimental design {{and analysis of the}} results to obtain the optimal processing parameters. Results: Statistical analyses revealed that three variables and the quadratic of X 1, X 2, and X 3 had significant effects on the yields and were followed by significant interaction effects between the variables of X 2 and X 3 (p <  0. 01). A 3 D response surface plot and contour plots derived from the mathematical models were applied to determine the optimal conditions. The optimum ultrasound-assisted extraction conditions were as follows: extraction temperature, 69  °C; extraction time, 34  min; and methanol concentration, 57 %. Under these conditions, the experimental yield of <b>glycyrrhizic</b> <b>acid</b> was 3. 414 %, which agreed closely with the predicted value (3. 406 %). Conclusion: The experimental values agreed with those predicted by RSM models, thus indicating the suitability of the model employed and the success of RSM in optimizing the extraction conditions.

40|$|Sweet tasting <b>glycyrrhizic</b> <b>acid</b> is {{considered}} {{to be the most important}} chemical compound in licorice root. However, environmental factors affect chemical composition of licorice root including <b>glycyrrhizic</b> <b>acid</b> content. In this study, the effects of the harvesting time and location on licorice root composition were studied. Chemical composition of the licorice roots (Glycyrrhizia glabra) collected in summer and fall seasons from three locations in Fars province (Eghlid, Beiza and Doshman-Ziary) and one location from each of Kerman (Baft) and Kermanshah (Islam-Abad) provinces was determined. Glycyrrizhic acid, ash and sugar content before and after hydrolysis were measured in all samples after extraction. A combined analysis of variances was performed on data based on a randomized complete block design in six replications. The results showed that effects of harvesting season on sugar content, and the effects of location and its interaction with harvesting season on ash, sugar and <b>glycyrrhizic</b> <b>acid</b> content were significant (p&lt; 0. 01). It was also found that the lowest ash content were obtained from roots harvested from Islam-Abad in summer; the highest sugar content before hydrolysis belonged to roots harvested from both Baft and Islam-Abad in fall. Highest amount of sugar after hydrolysis was reported in the roots collected from Islam-Abad in Fall. Roots harvested from Beiza in Fars province in fall had the maximum glycyrrizhic acid content...|$|E
