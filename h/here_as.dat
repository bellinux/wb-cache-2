5|$|On {{the first}} night of the voyage, the General stays at Facatativá with his entourage, which {{consists}} of José Palacios, five aides-de-camp, his clerks, and his dogs. <b>Here,</b> <b>as</b> throughout the journey that follows, the General's loss of prestige is evident; the downturn in his fortunes surprises even the General himself. His unidentified illness has led to his physical deterioration, which makes him unrecognizable, and his aide-de-camp is constantly mistaken for the Liberator.|$|E

5|$|Aggressive mimicry {{is found}} in predators (or parasites) that share the same {{characteristics}} as a harmless species, allowing them to avoid detection by their prey (or host). The mimic may resemble the prey or host itself, or another organism that is either neutral or beneficial to the signal receiver. In this class of mimicry, the model may be affected negatively, positively or not at all. Just as parasites can {{be treated as a}} form of predator, host-parasite mimicry is treated <b>here</b> <b>as</b> a subclass of aggressive mimicry.|$|E

5|$|Bletchley Park is {{a former}} private estate located in Old Bletchley and modern Museum of Cryptography. Conveniently located at the {{junction}} of the Varsity Line with the West Coast Main Line, Bletchley Park, code-named Station X, was {{the location of the}} Allied main code-breaking establishment during World War II.

5|$|He {{was educated}} at Harrow where, {{notwithstanding}} {{the fears of}} his family that a childhood head injury caused by a dangerous fall from a horse had seriously damaged his intellect, he showed aptitude in Greek and Latin. He made good academic progress, but after he had settled a quarrel with another pupil by an organised fist-fight, his father removed him from the school. (Fist fights were tolerated at Harrow: {{it was the fact}} of Brudenell's receiving punishment for unauthorised absence while having a broken bone in his hand attended to by a London surgeon that had annoyed the earl.) He was subsequently educated at home. <b>Here,</b> <b>as</b> the only son among seven sisters, he developed into something of a spoilt child, accustomed to getting his own way. This is seen as a cause of his arrogance and stubbornness in later life.|$|E
