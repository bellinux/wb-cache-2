40|$|Abstract. Two {{spectral}} {{regimes of}} magnetic field amplification in magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) flows {{can be distinguished}} by the scale on which fields are amplified relative to the primary <b>forcing</b> <b>scale</b> of the turbulence. For field amplification at or below the <b>forcing</b> <b>scale,</b> the amplification can be called a “small scale dynamo. ” For amplification at and above the <b>forcing</b> <b>scale</b> the process can be called a “large scale dynamo. ” Non − local (in wave number) effects {{play a key role}} in both the growth of the small scale field in non-helical turbulence and the growth of large and small scale fields in helical turbulence. Mean field dynamo (MFD) theory represents a simple semi-analytic way to get a handle on large scale field amplification in MHD turbulence. Helicity has long been known to be important for large scale, flux generating, externally forced MFDs. The extent to which such MFDs operate “slow ” or “fast ” (dependent or independent on magnetic Reynolds number) has been controversial, but there has been recent progress. Simulations of α 2 dynamos in a periodic box dynamo and their quenching can now be largely understood within a simplified dynamical non-linear paradigm in which the MFD growth equation is supplemented by the total magnetic helicit...|$|R

50|$|Lyotard found {{particularly}} interesting {{the explanation of}} the sublime offered by Immanuel Kant in his Critique of Judgment (sometimes Critique of the Power of Judgment). In this book, Kant explains this mixture of anxiety and pleasure in the following terms: {{there are two kinds}} of 'sublime' experience. In the 'mathematically' sublime, an object strikes the mind in such a way that we find ourselves unable to take it in as a whole. More precisely, we experience a clash between our reason (which tells us that all objects are finite) and the imagination (the aspect of the mind that organizes what we see, and which sees an object incalculably larger than ourselves, and feels infinite). In the 'dynamically' sublime, the mind recoils at an object so immeasurably more powerful than we, whose weight, <b>force,</b> <b>scale</b> could crush us without the remotest hope of our being able to resist it.
