5|$|Varanasi’s music {{tradition}} is {{traced to the}} Pauranic days. According to ancient legend, Shiva is credited with evolving music and dance forms.

During the monarchic rule of Govind Chandra in the 16th century, the Dhrupad style of singing received royal patronage and led to other related forms of music such as Dhamar, Hori, and Chaturang.
