40|$|The paper reviews Japan’s {{experiences}} with the liberalization of <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>controls,</b> and attempts to identify its policy implications for China, focusing on <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> rate regime, capital mobility restrictions, sterilized interventions, and independence of monetary policy. To provide a theoretic foundation, the paper first sets up a simple enlarged Mundell-Fleming model and analyses whether capital account controls and sterilized interventions can maintain managed floating rate regime and independent monetary policy simultaneously. The author argues that it is theoretically possible for a finite time and it is increasingly difficult under circumstances of the expansion in current transactions, and large and persistent capital mobility. Secondly, the paper presents an overview on Japan’s experiences in liberalization of <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>controls</b> from immediate postwar to 1990. Japan adopted gradual steps to liberalize <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>controls,</b> with the freedom in current account in 1964, the shift of exchange rate from pegged to managed floating in 1971, and finally to freely floating in 1973, and the liberalization of capital account in 1980. Japanese experiences of liberalization on <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>controls</b> are mixed. Japan’s long resistances to the unavoidable yen revaluation led t...|$|R

50|$|Egypt {{remained}} {{part of the}} Sterling Area until 1962, when Egypt devalued {{slightly and}} switched to a peg to the United States dollar, {{at a rate of}} EG£1 = US$2.3.

The pound floated in 1989. However, until 2001, the float was tightly managed by the Central Bank of Egypt and <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>controls</b> were in effect. The Central Bank of Egypt voted to end the managed-float regime and allowed the pound to float freely on 3 November 2016; the bank also announced an end to <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>controls</b> that day.

50|$|The {{parallel}} loan {{was established in}} the early 1970s in effect of the exchange controls in the United Kingdom on British companies. The implementation of exchange control has caused many British firms withdrawn their decision to extend their business because investing in foreign market is not attractive. After the abolition of <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>control</b> in 1979, {{parallel loan}} kept on being utilized with the goal of hedging long-term foreign currency exposure at a lower cost than what will be imposed in the foreign exchange market. At that time, UK organizations needed to pay a premium to get a loan in US dollars. In order to prevent this situation, UK organizations set up parallel or back-to-back loan agreement with US organizations that wish to acquire sterling.|$|E
50|$|To {{secure the}} Japanese market, Lockheed {{secretly}} bribed {{several members of}} the Japanese government to subsidize All Nippon Airways' purchase of L-1011s; this caused a significant scandal when the bribes were uncovered. The discovered scale to what has become known as the Lockheed bribery scandal led to the arrest of Japanese Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka, as well as several other officials. Within Lockheed, board chairman Daniel Haughton and vice chairman and president Carl Kotchian resigned their posts on February 13, 1976. Tanaka was eventually tried and found guilty of violating <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>control</b> laws, but was not charged with bribery, a more serious criminal offense. Crucially for Lockheed, the fallout from the scandal included the loss of a contract worth in excess of $1 billion.|$|E
50|$|During the 1940s, {{which were}} {{dominated}} by the adverse effects of the Second World War, the Central Bank, like its peers all over the world, implemented policies to offset the public finance deficit rather than implementing an independent monetary policy. Therefore, the general price level increased more than threefold in the 1938-1948 period.During the 1950s, growth and rapid development were financed by Central Bank sources, and these sources were rendered available to public authority through short-term advances provided to the Treasury. An important development for the Central Bank in that period was {{the establishment of the}} Banknote Printing Plant in 1955 and from 1957 onwards banknote-printing started in Turkey. With the transition to planned economy in the 1960s, the Central Bank continued to provide resources to the public sector by pursuing expansionary monetary policies made possible by the economic circumstances and industrial development.
