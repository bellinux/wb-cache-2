5|$|Similarities between House and {{the famous}} fictional detective Sherlock Holmes appear in the pilot; Shore {{explained}} that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>a</b> fan of Holmes, and found the character's traits of indifference to his clients unique. House and Holmes have only one real friend (Wilson and Watson, respectively) who connects the cerebral hero to human concerns. This Holmes and Watson dynamic was something the producers were looking for in the characters of House and Wilson, {{especially in terms of}} chemistry.|$|E
5|$|Years later, Gandhi and {{his colleagues}} served and helped Africans as nurses and by {{opposing}} racism, according to the Nobel Peace Prize winner Nelson Mandela. The general image of Gandhi, state Desai and Vahed, has been reinvented since his assassination as if <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>a</b> saint, when in reality his life was more complex, contained inconvenient truths and was one that evolved over time. In contrast, other Africa scholars state the evidence points to a rich history of co-operation and efforts by Gandhi and Indian people with nonwhite South Africans against persecution of Africans and the Apartheid.|$|E

He played various other games for money, especially canasta, poker and backgammon, and wrote books on them.|$|E
25|$|Service members {{requiring}} observation or care {{beyond the}} unit level are evacuated to facilities {{in close proximity}} to, but separate from the medical or surgical patients at the BAS, surgical support company in a central location (Marines) or forward support/division support or area support medical companies (Army) nearest the service members' unit. It is best to send Service members who cannot continue their mission and require more extensive respite to a central facility other than a hospital, unless no other alternative is possible. The Service member must be encouraged to continue to {{think of himself as}} a war fighter, rather than a patient or a sick person. The chain of command remains directly involved in the Service member's recovery and return to duty. The CSC team coordinates with the unit's leaders to learn whether the over-stressed individual was a good performer prior to the combat stress reaction, or whether <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>a</b> marginal or problem performer whom the team would rather see replaced than returned. Whenever possible, representatives of the unit, or messages from the unit, tell the casualty that he is needed and wanted back. The CSC team coordinates with the unit leaders, through unit medical personnel or chaplains, any special advice on how to assure quick reintegration when the Service member returns to his unit.|$|E

25|$|He {{joined the}} cruiser , and sailed for the West Indies for training. In Mexico and Venezuela, {{he was part}} of a force sent to protect British {{interests}} against revolutionaries. After courses at Halifax, Nova Scotia he joined another cruiser, , which patrolled off the eastern seaboard of the United States where she stopped shipping to search for German nationals of military age, who were removed. Since he spoke German, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>a</b> member of the boarding party. He was also involved in the escort of troopships to England. He was appointed to , an I-class destroyer. He was constantly at sea, patrolling to the Hook of Holland. He escorted hospital ships to and from France. He employed anti-submarine and minesweeping methods. Asdic, depth charges, and the hydrophones used in the Great War could not be used when a ship was underway, however they were used in action against enemy submarines. He was ordered to the Mediterranean Sea in April 1918. He performed convoy, anti-submarine, and rescue work. He found that social and sports activities ashore were much improved. At Brindisi, Italy, efforts made to seal the Adriatic against movement of enemy submarines were only partially effective, since the sea was too deep to blockade. He served as the Executive Officer of HMS Beaver. He ferried troops to the Dardanelles when Turkey surrendered. He entered the Sea of Marmara and proceeded to Constantinople. In October 1918 he participated in the bombardment of Durazzo, Albania. From Constantinople they sailed to Odessa, Russia where the German army and the White Russians were attempting to keep some sort of civil order. Welcomed by the Rumanians, they sailed up the Danube where they attempted to keep the Rumanians and Bulgarians apart. In December 1918, he called at Sevastopol, Russia where he saw and visited the Russian Black Sea Fleet, which was largely abandoned and in a poor state of repair. He removed a number of political refugees from Odessa, Russia.|$|E

He used to take his glasses down, those granny glasses, and say, [...] "it's only me." [...] They were like a wall you know? A shield. Those are the moments I treasure.|$|E

500|$|In 1900, {{after ten}} years without a {{permanent}} home in Paris, Saint-Saëns took a flat in the rue de Courcelles, not far from his old residence in the rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré. This remained his home {{for the rest of}} his life. He continued to travel abroad frequently, but increasingly often to give concerts rather than as a tourist. He revisited London, where <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>a</b> welcome visitor, went to Berlin, where until the First World War, he was greeted with honour, and travelled in Italy, Spain, Monaco and provincial France. In 1906 and 1909 he made highly successful tours of the US, as a pianist and conductor. In New York on his second visit he premiered his [...] "Praise ye the Lord" [...] for double choir, orchestra and organ, which he composed for the occasion.|$|E
500|$|References to {{the fact}} that Gregory House was based on the famous fictional detective Sherlock Holmes created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle appear {{throughout}} the series. Shore explained that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>a</b> Holmes fan and found the character's indifference to his clients unique. The resemblance is evident in House's reliance on deductive reasoning and psychology, even where it might not seem obviously applicable, and his reluctance to accept cases he finds uninteresting. His investigatory method is to eliminate diagnoses logically as they are proved impossible; Holmes used a similar method. Both characters play instruments (House plays the piano, the guitar, and the harmonica; Holmes, the violin) and take drugs (House is dependent on Vicodin; Holmes uses cocaine recreationally). House's relationship with Dr. James Wilson echoes that between Holmes and his confidant, Dr. John Watson. Robert Sean Leonard, who portrays Wilson, said that House and his character—whose name is very similar to Watson's—were originally intended to work together much as Holmes and Watson do; in his view, House's diagnostic team has assumed that aspect of the Watson role. Wilson even has a dead-beat brother who may be dead, like Watson's dead alcoholic brother. (season 1, episode 10) Shore said that House's name itself is meant as [...] "a subtle homage" [...] to Holmes. House's address is 221B Baker Street, a direct reference to Holmes's street address. Wilson's address is also 221B.|$|E

2500|$|Gibson {{wrote of}} him as a cricketer that he had [...] "a {{toughness}} of character, a certain ruthlessness behind the genial exterior... He {{does not seem to have}} been a particularly popular man, though <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>a</b> deeply respected one." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although {{offered a}} D.D. by Glasgow, Struthers {{declined}} it, {{saying that it}} would look ridiculous for a children's magazine to be edited by a D.D. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>a</b> humble man and was content to be [...] "The Children's Editor". The theologian James Denney said the Morning Watch {{was one of the}} hundred best books in the world. Today it offers a charming window into childhood in late Victorian and Edwardian Scotland.|$|E
2500|$|While Walker {{was well}} liked and {{respected}} throughout the northwestern Smokies, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>a</b> source of controversy {{due to his}} practice of polygamy. [...] Walker, who was very religious, believed that Biblical scripture allowed him to take more than one wife. [...] In 1864, he married Mary Ann Moore {{and a few years}} later married a third wife, Mary Moll Stinnett. [...] Walker eventually fathered a total of 26 children, although several died in infancy. [...] He allowed tenant farmers to move into Walker Valley, and a small community developed. [...] Walker constructed three gristmills to accommodate the growing community.|$|E

2500|$|These {{allegations}} {{coupled with}} Burton's often irascible nature {{were said to}} have harmed his career and may explain why he was not promoted further, either in army life or in the diplomatic service. As an obituary described: [...] "...he was ill fitted to run in official harness, and he had a Byronic love of shocking people, of telling tales against himself that had no foundation in fact." [...] Ouida reported: [...] "Men at the FO ... used to hint dark horrors about Burton, and certainly justly or unjustly he was disliked, feared and suspected... not for what he had done, but for what he was believed capable of doing." [...] Whatever the truth of the many allegations made against him, Burton's interests and outspoken nature ensured that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>a</b> controversial character in his lifetime.|$|E
2500|$|Jackson {{remains one}} of the most studied and {{controversial}} figures in American history. Historian Charles Grier Sellers says, [...] "Andrew Jackson's masterful personality was enough by itself to make him one of the most controversial figures ever to stride across the American stage." [...] His most controversial presidential actions included removal of the Indians from the southeast, the dismantling of the Bank of the United States, and his threat to use military force against the state of South Carolina to make it stop nullifying federal laws. Not at all controversial was his resounding victory over the British at New Orleans in the last battle of the War of 1812. He was the main founder of the modern Democratic Party and became its iconic hero. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>a</b> fierce partisan, with many friends and many enemies.|$|E
2500|$|After {{escaping}} {{first to}} Mozambique, then to Brazil, the family settled in Argentina.

Local media were alerted, and after being exposed as Escobar's widow, Henao was imprisoned for eighteen months while her finances were investigated. Ultimately, authorities were unable to link her funds to illegal activity, and she was released. According to her son, Henao {{fell in love with}} Escobar [...] "because of his naughty smile [...] the way he looked at [...] [...] was affectionate and sweet. A great lover. I fell in love with his desire to help people and his compassion for their hardship. We [...] drive to places where he dreamed of building schools for the poor.
