5|$|Although {{religious}} {{information is}} not collected by the U.S. census, according to a 2000 survey by Dale E. <b>Jones</b> <b>of</b> the Association of Statisticians of American Religious Bodies, 50.2% {{of the population in}} Norman is affiliated with a religious institution.

5|$|In {{the spring}} of 2012, Hoffman made his final stage appearance, {{starring}} as Willy Loman in a Broadway revival of Death of a Salesman. Directed by Mike Nichols, the production ran for 78 performances and was the highest-grossing show in the Ethel Barrymore Theatre's history. Many critics felt that Hoffman, at 44, was too young {{for the role of}} 62-year-old Loman, and Chris <b>Jones</b> <b>of</b> the Chicago Tribune felt that the character had been interpreted poorly. Hoffman admitted that he found the role difficult, but he nevertheless earned his third Tony Award nomination.|$|E

5|$|A large {{range of}} {{seventeenth and eighteenth}} century monuments survive, mainly in the chancel. They include some {{for members of the}} major landowning {{families}} in the (original) parish, including the Powells of Nanteos (who were long-time Lords of the Manor of Llanbadarn Fawr) and the Pryses of Gogerddan. A white marble tablet was erected in 1666 to Colonel John <b>Jones,</b> <b>of</b> Nanteos. Several of the monuments are substantial, including that to Lewis Pryse, erected by his widow Margaret, {{to the left of the}} north wall window. To the left of the great east window is a monument erected by Mary Pryse in memory of several members of her family. To the right side of the altar – the epistle side of the chancel – is a monument to Thomas Powell. Several smaller monuments are mounted above both of these. In the south wall there is a large memorial to William Powell, and several smaller memorials.|$|E
5|$|Confederate Maj. Gen. Henry Heth's division, from Lt. Gen. A.P. Hill's Third Corps, {{advanced}} towards Gettysburg. Heth deployed no cavalry and led, unconventionally, {{with the}} artillery battalion of Major William J. Pegram. Two infantry brigades followed, commanded by Brig. Gens. James J. Archer and Joseph R. Davis, proceeding easterly in columns along the Chambersburg Pike. Three miles (5km) west of town, about 7:30 a.m., Heth's two brigades met light resistance from cavalry vedettes and deployed into line. Eventually, they reached dismounted troopers from Col. William Gamble's cavalry brigade. The first {{shot of the}} battle was claimed to be fired by Lieutenant Marcellus E. <b>Jones</b> <b>of</b> the 8th Illinois Cavalry, fired at an unidentified man on a gray horse over a half-mile away; the act was merely symbolic. Buford's 2,748 troopers would soon be faced with 7,600 Confederate infantrymen, deploying from columns into line of battle.|$|E
5|$|Kerron Stewart {{also participated}} in the women's 100meters for Jamaica at the Beijing Olympics. Born in Saint Andrew Parish in east-central Jamaica, Stewart participated in the first Olympic game {{in which she had}} participated, and was 24 at the time. Stewart participated in the tenth (and last) heat of the August 15 {{qualification}} round, placing first out of its nine athletes with a time of 11.28seconds. She ranked ahead of Norway's Ezinne Okparaebo (11.32seconds) and Laverne <b>Jones</b> <b>of</b> the United States Virgin Islands (11.41seconds), who respectively ranked second and third in the heat. Stewart ranked fifth out of the 85 qualification round athletes. She progressed to the quarterfinals.|$|E

5|$|The event made {{newspaper}} headlines in Jamaica {{and was also}} the subject of reporting in both the United Kingdom and the United States. While voices on social media accused <b>Jones</b> <b>of</b> provoking his killers by cross-dressing in public, the murder was condemned by Jamaican educators and the country's Justice Minister. In {{the wake of the}} attack, both domestic and international organisations devoted to LGBT rights and human rights – among them Human Rights Watch, Jamaicans for Justice, and the Jamaica Forum for Lesbians, All-Sexuals & Gays – asked the Jamaican authorities for a proper investigation and legal recognition of LGBT rights on the island.|$|E
5|$|The film {{started as}} a {{collaboration}} between Henson and Froud, with ideas for the film first being discussed between them following a screening of their previous collaboration, The Dark Crystal. Terry <b>Jones</b> <b>of</b> Monty Python wrote {{the first draft of}} the film's script early in 1984, drawing on Froud's sketches for inspiration. Various other scriptwriters, including Laura Phillips (who had previously written several episodes of Fraggle Rock), Lucas, Dennis Lee, and Elaine May, subsequently rewrote and made additions to the screenplay, although Jones received the film's sole screenwriting credit. Labyrinth was shot on location in Upper Nyack, Piermont and Haverstraw in New York, and at Elstree Studios and West Wycombe Park in the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Then 21-year-old {{athlete of}} Raleigh's St. Augustine's College Barbara Pierre {{participated in the}} women's 100meters dash on Haiti's behalf in Beijing, marking her first {{appearance}} at any Olympic games. She was the only Haitian participating in the event. Pierre competed during the qualification round of the event, which took place on August 15, where she {{was placed in the}} tenth heat. Pierre placed fourth with a time of 11.52seconds, placing directly behind Laverne <b>Jones</b> <b>of</b> the United States Virgin Islands (11.41seconds) and ahead of Russia's Natalia Murinovich (11.55seconds). The leaders of Pierre's heat were Jamaica's Kerron Stewart (11.28seconds) and Norway's Ezinne Okparaebo (11.32seconds). Overall, Pierre placed 30th out of the 85 athletes who participated in the qualification round. She advanced to quarterfinals, which took place on August 16.|$|E
50|$|Confusion remains {{over the}} naming of this species because Stephen Hopper and Andrew Brown {{described}} Caladenia paradoxa in 2001, unaware <b>of</b> <b>Jones's</b> description <b>of</b> Caladenia capillata {{and it is possible}} that the two species are synonymous. The State Herbarium of South Australia continues to use the name Caladenia filamentosa var. tentaculata.|$|R

5|$|Two {{days after}} the Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) program, Insane Clown Posse began its rescheduled {{nationwide}} tour with House of Krazees and Myzery. Their first concert, held in Orlando, Florida, was hand-picked by Insane Clown Posse and free to the public. Halfway through the tour, Brian <b>Jones</b> <b>of</b> House of Krazees had a falling out with his band members. Jones left the group, forcing House of Krazees to quit the tour. The success of the tour enabled Bruce and Utsler to purchase new houses both {{for each other and}} for their families. Bruce even told his mother to quit her job because he would pay her expenses.|$|E
5|$|Marriage {{consideration}} {{had begun}} early on for her. American merchant Gorham D. Gilman, a houseguest of the Pākīs', had courted her unsuccessfully {{when she was}} fifteen. Around the time of Kōnia's final illness in 1857, Liliʻuokalani was briefly engaged to William Charles Lunalilo. They shared an interest in music composition and {{had known each other}} from childhood. He had been betrothed from birth to Princess Victoria, the king's sister, but disagreements with her brothers prevented the marriage from materializing. Thus, Lunalilo proposed to Liliʻuokalani during a trip to Lahaina to be with Kōnia. A short-lived dual engagement occurred in which Liliʻuokalani was matched to Lunalilo and her brother Kalakaua to Princess Victoria. She ultimately broke off the engagement because of the urging of King Kamehameha IV and the opposition of the Bishops to the union. Afterward, she became romantically involved with the American-born John Owen Dominis, a staff member for Prince Lot Kapuāiwa (the future Kamehameha V) and secretary to King Kamehameha IV. Dominis was the son of Captain John Dominis, of Trieste, and Mary Lambert <b>Jones,</b> <b>of</b> Boston. According to Liliʻuokalani's memoir, they had known each from childhood when he watched the royal children from a school next to the Cookes'. During a court excursion, Dominis escorted her home despite falling from his horse and breaking his leg.|$|E
