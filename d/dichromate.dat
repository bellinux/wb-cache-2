5|$|Small {{amounts of}} the {{impurities}} NO and HNO3 are also formed in this reaction.

5|$|For the {{production}} of pure chromium, the iron must {{be separated from the}} chromium in a two step roasting and leaching process. The chromite ore is heated with a mixture of calcium carbonate and sodium carbonate in the presence of air. The chromium is oxidized to the hexavalent form, while the iron forms the stable Fe2O3. The subsequent leaching at higher elevated temperatures dissolves the chromates and leaves the insoluble iron oxide. The chromate is converted by sulfuric acid into the <b>dichromate.</b>|$|E

5|$|Sodium {{chromate}} {{is produced}} industrially by the oxidative roasting of chromite ore with calcium or sodium carbonate. The dominant species is therefore, {{by the law}} of mass action, determined by the pH of the solution. The change in equilibrium is visible by a change from yellow (chromate) to orange (<b>dichromate),</b> such as when an acid is added to a neutral solution of potassium chromate. At yet lower pH values, further condensation to more complex oxyanions of chromium is possible.|$|E
25|$|The excess <b>dichromate</b> is {{determined}} by titration against sodium thiosulfate. Subtracting the amount of excess <b>dichromate</b> from the initial amount, gives the amount of ethanol present. Accuracy can be improved by calibrating the <b>dichromate</b> solution against a blank.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis {{paper is}} devoted {{to the study of the}} {{photochemical}} processes occurring during hologram formation in a biopolymer, agar doped by chromium(VI). The evolution of both the absorbing chromium species and the polymer allowed elucidating the reactions taking place during irradiation in conditions representative of hologram formation. As previously observed with <b>dichromated</b> poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), polymer containing hydroxyl groups as agar, irradiation of <b>dichromated</b> agar provoked a two step reduction of chromium species and the crosslinking of the host polymer. But agar has a rather complex chemical structure and the photoproducts formed along the polymeric chains throughout the photoredox process were different in agar and in PVA. The photostability of the matrix, that has been proven, coupled with the possibility to record good quality holograms, allowed us to propose <b>dichromated</b> agar as a new natural photosensitive biomaterial...|$|R

25|$|Potassium <b>dichromate</b> is an {{oxidising}} agent in organic chemistry, and is milder than potassium permanganate. It {{is used to}} oxidize alcohols. It converts primary alcohols into aldehydes and, under more forcing conditions, into carboxylic acids. In contrast, potassium permanganate tends to give carboxylic acids as the sole products. Secondary alcohols are converted into ketones. For example, menthone may be prepared by oxidation of menthol with acidified <b>dichromate.</b> Tertiary alcohols cannot be oxidized.|$|E

25|$|The oldest breath {{analyzer}} models pass breath {{through a}} solution of potassium <b>dichromate,</b> which oxidizes ethanol into acetic acid, changing color in the process. A monochromatic light beam is passed through this sample, and a detector records the change in intensity and, hence, the change in color, {{which is used to}} calculate the percent alcohol in the breath. However, since potassium <b>dichromate</b> is a strong oxidizer, numerous alcohol groups can be oxidized by it, producing false positives. This source of false positives is unlikely as very few other substances found in exhaled air are oxidizable.|$|E

The cell was also known as the 'chromic acid cell', but principally as the 'bichromate cell'.

25|$|Photovoltaic assay : The {{photovoltaic}} assay, {{used only}} in the dated Photo Electric Intoximeter (PEI), {{is a form of}} breath testing rarely encountered today. The process works by using photocells to analyze the color change of a redox (oxidation-reduction) reaction. A breath sample is bubbled through an aqueous solution of sulfuric acid, potassium <b>dichromate,</b> and silver nitrate. The silver nitrate acts as a catalyst, allowing the alcohol to be oxidized at an appreciable rate. The requisite acidic condition needed for the reaction might also be provided by the sulfuric acid. In solution, ethanol reacts with the potassium <b>dichromate,</b> reducing the <b>dichromate</b> ion to the chromium (III) ion. This reduction results in a change of the solution's color from red-orange to green. The reacted solution is compared to a vial of non-reacted solution by a photocell, which creates an electric current proportional to the degree of the color change; this current moves the needle that indicates BAC. Like other methods, breath testing devices using chemical analysis are somewhat prone to false readings. Compounds that have compositions similar to ethanol, for example, could also act as reducing agents, creating the necessary color change to indicate increased BAC.|$|E

25|$|In screen-printing a {{fine screen}} of bolting silk or similar {{material}} is stretched taut onto a frame {{similar to the}} way canvas is prepared before painting. A colloid sensitized with a <b>dichromate</b> is applied evenly to the taut screen. Once the <b>dichromate</b> mixture is dry, a full-size photographic negative is attached securely onto the surface of the screen, and the whole assembly exposed to strong light â€“ typically about half an hour in bright sunlight â€“ hardening the exposed colloid. When the negative is removed, the unexposed mixture on the screen can be washed off with warm water, leaving the hardened mixture intact, acting as a precise mask of the desired pattern, which can then be printed with the usual screen-printing process.|$|E
