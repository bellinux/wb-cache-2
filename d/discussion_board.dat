"July 2012 "This study examined the influence of exposure to online <b>discussion</b> <b>boards</b> and <b>discussion</b> participation in the online <b>discussion</b> <b>boards</b> on opinion-challenging news use. Based on cognitive dissonance theory and media choice model, a 2 (exposure to disagreement: position-convergent discussion vs. position-divergent discussion) X 2 (discussion participation: participation vs. non-participation) mixed factorial design examined the role of online <b>discussion</b> <b>boards</b> on selective exposure to political news.

Also, discussion participation was found to moderate the effect of the exposure to position-divergent online <b>discussion</b> <b>boards</b> on the utility of opinion-challenging news use.
