5|$|Icings – Roofs {{must also}} be {{designed}} to avoid ice dams, which result from meltwater running under the snow {{on the roof and}} freezing at the eave. Ice dams on roofs form when accumulated snow on a sloping roof melts and flows down the roof, under the <b>insulating</b> <b>blanket</b> of snow, until it reaches below freezing temperature air, typically at the eaves. When the meltwater reaches the freezing air, ice accumulates, forming a dam, and snow that melts later cannot drain properly through the dam. Ice dams may result in damaged building materials or in damage or injury when the ice dam falls off or from attempts to remove ice dams. The melting results from heat passing through the roof under the highly insulating layer of snow.|$|E
25|$|On USS Atlanta, {{over 500}} {{high-speed}} cameras {{on the ship}} recorded {{the effects of the}} blast. During the tests, the ship was manned by a 169-man navy crew and 60 scientific personnel who remained below deck. In spite of the topside damage, the crew below deck experienced only a shock equivalent to a nine gun 16-inch salvo from an Iowa-class battleship. Had there been personnel in the superstructures, they would have been violently thrown about. Topside, the SPS-37 and SPS-10 antennas as well as the URD-4 radio direction finder were torn off by the blast, while other structures were severely deformed. The AN/SPG-51 Tartar guided missile radar was put out of operation for one hour. While the anti-submarine ASROC launcher and Mark 32 torpedo tubes were damaged, the rockets and Mark 44 and Mark 46 torpedoes inside were intact. The Mark 25 torpedo tube was severely damaged, aluminum casting cracked, hold down bolts elongated, the <b>insulating</b> <b>blanket</b> destroyed and the muzzle door sprung, but surprisingly, the tube remained operational. The tripod mast carrying electronics gear was destroyed and fell to the deck. On the blast side, components of the hardened deck house sustained a permanent 2 inch deflection. The entire DLG 16 deck-house between two levels was blown in after welds were ruptured.|$|E

40|$|Fast Track {{concrete}} {{has proven}} to be successful in obtaining high early strengths. This benefit does not come without cost. Special Type III cement and <b>insulating</b> <b>blankets</b> to accelerate the cure add to its expense when compared to conventional paving. This research was intended to determine the benefit derived from the use of <b>insulating</b> <b>blankets</b> to accelerate strength gain in three concrete mixes using Type I cement. The goal was to determine mixes and curing procedures that would result in a range of opening times. This determination would allow the most economical design for a particular project by tailoring it to a specific time restraint. Three mixes of various cement content were tested in the field. Flexural beams were cast for each mix and tested at various ages. Two test sections were placed for each mix, one section being cured with the addition of <b>insulating</b> <b>blankets</b> and the other being cured with only conventional curing compound. Iowa Department of Transportation specifications require 500 psi flexural strength before a pavement can be opened to traffic. Concrete with Fast Track proportions (nominal 7 1 / 2 bag), Type I cement, and <b>insulating</b> <b>blankets</b> reached that strength in approximately 36 hr, a standard mix (nominal 6 1 / 2 bag) using the blankets in approximately 48 hr, and the Fast Track proportions with Type I cement without blankets in about 60 hr. The results showed a significant improvement in early strength gain with the use of <b>insulating</b> <b>blankets...</b>|$|R

50|$|Uniform {{distribution}} of pathogen-killing temperatures may be aided by placing an <b>insulating</b> <b>blanket</b> of previously composted sludge over aerated composting piles.

50|$|Unlike {{traditional}} residential houses {{built on}} the ground, the aim of building an earth house is not to live under or in the ground, but with it. If ground and house are separated, a house is built “into the air”, resulting {{in the loss of}} heat and humidity, and the exterior shell of a building loses lifespan. The earth house concept uses the ground as an <b>insulating</b> <b>blanket</b> that efficiently protects it from rain, low temperatures, wind and natural abrasion.

5000|$|Heat flows {{constantly}} {{from its}} sources within the Earth to the surface. Total heat loss from the Earth {{is estimated at}} 44.2 TW (4.42 × 1013 watts).

More of the heat in the Earth is lost through plate tectonics, by mantle upwelling associated with mid-ocean ridges.

50|$|Rotten ice is a loose {{term for}} ice that is melting, disintegrating, or {{otherwise}} formed, having water, air, or contaminants between ice grains, causing the ice to be honeycombed. It forms on open water, when snowpack and ice are mixed together and other conditions. It may be transparent, {{causing it to}} look like new black ice. Though it may appear strong, rotten ice is weak — even several feet thick may not hold a person's weight (although it may hold a dog sled's weight). On land, it is difficult or impossible to climb. It melts more quickly than solid ice. Candle ice {{is a form of}} rotten ice.One way to tell that ice is rotting would be the grey, splotchy color. Also, the thickness of ice cannot determine how safe it is, because water from underneath the ice can erode the ice and cause it to be thinner without a sign on the surface. Even thick ice may be weak, especially if it has frozen and thawed repeatedly or if it contains layers of snow. Minerals in the water make vertical veins in the ice. These veins melt much faster {{than the rest of the}} ice causing vertical channels and the ice to weaken along those channels. Many people tend to question if snow actually warms up ice, making it more likely to crack and break, or if snow actually causes ice to freeze faster. Snow will actually act like an <b>insulating</b> <b>blanket.</b> The ice under the snow will be thinner and weaker. A new snowfall can also warm-up and melt existing ice. Rotten ice is becoming more commonly found in the Beaufort Sea, near Alaska, due to different climate changes. This is concerning, because it is a sign that the amount of multiyear ice is declining, and it is being replaced with heavily decayed ice.|$|E

40|$|The {{problem of}} heat losses from open liquid filled tanks {{is as old}} as {{industry}} itself. This paper will present the advantages of using an <b>insulating</b> <b>blanket</b> of hollow plastic spheres as a mechanism to conserve this type of industrial energy loss. FIRST: The theory of a floating ball blanket will be covered. Claims on the effectiveness of a ball blanket will be substantiated by results obtained from independent testing laboratories. Slides and graphs of these results, as well as photographs of industrial applications will be presented. NEXT: Attention will be given to specific industries in which open tank energy loss is common. Metal finishing, chemical manufacturing, power generation, sewage/wastewater, and food manufacturing will be highlighted. Other benefits obtainable from floating ball blankets, such as evaporation control and odor control will be briefly discussed. Questions and answers of specific interest from conference attendees will be answered following the presentation. Various methods are available to industry to reduce open tank heating losses.
