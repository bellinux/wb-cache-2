40|$|Mitigating the {{negative}} welfare consequences of crises such as droughts, floods, and disease outbreaks, {{is a major}} challenge {{in many areas of}} the world, especially in highly vulnerable areas insufficiently equipped to prevent food and livelihood security crisis in the face of adverse shocks. Given the finite resources allocated for emergency response, and the expected increase in incidences of humanitarian catastrophe due to changing climate patterns, there is a need for rigorous and efficient methods of early warning and emergency needs assessment. In this paper we develop an empirical model, based on a relatively parsimonious set of regularly measured variables from communities in Kenya's arid north, that generates remarkably accurate forecasts of the likelihood of famine with at least 3 Â months lead time. Such a forecasting model is a potentially valuable tool for enhancing <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> <b>capacity.</b> Food security Food aid Early warning Emergency response Forecasting famine...|$|E
40|$|Forecasting is a {{critical}} component of project management. Project managers must be able to make reliable predictions about the final duration and cost of projects starting from project inception. Such predictions need to be revised and compared with the project?s objectives to obtain early warnings against potential problems. Therefore, the effectiveness of project controls relies on the capability of project managers to make reliable forecasts in a timely manner. This dissertation focuses on forecasting project schedule progress with probabilistic methods. Currently available methods, for example, the critical path method (CPM) and earned value management (EVM) are deterministic and fail to account for the inherent uncertainty in forecasting and project performance. The objective of this dissertation is to improve the predictive capabilities of project managers by developing probabilistic forecasting methods that integrate all relevant information and uncertainties into consistent forecasts in a mathematically sound procedure usable in practice. In this dissertation, two probabilistic methods, the Kalman filter forecasting method (KFFM) and the Bayesian adaptive forecasting method (BAFM), were developed. The KFFM and the BAFM have the following advantages over the conventional methods: (1) They are probabilistic methods that provide prediction bounds on predictions; (2) They are integrative methods that make better use of the prior performance information available from standard construction management practices and theories; and (3) They provide a systematic way of incorporating measurement errors into forecasting. The accuracy and <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> <b>capacity</b> of the KFFM and the BAFM were also evaluated and compared against the CPM and a state-of-the-art EVM schedule forecasting method. Major conclusions from this research are: (1) The state-of-the-art EVM schedule forecasting method can be used to obtain reliable warnings only after the project performance has stabilized; (2) The CPM is not capable of providing early warnings due to its retrospective nature; (3) The KFFM and the BAFM can and should be used to forecast progress and to obtain reliable early warnings of all projects; and (4) The <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> <b>capacity</b> of forecasting methods should be evaluated and compared in terms of the timeliness and reliability of warning in the context of formal early warning systems...|$|E
40|$|The survey makes five main recommendations, as follows: 1. Develop a {{globally}} comprehensive <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> system, {{rooted in}} existing <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> systems and <b>capacities</b> A global <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> system will require long-term sustained action by diverse players, strong political commitment to engender public action {{and to make}} <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> a core task of national policy and disaster risk reduction strategy, strong international support and coordination, with clear roles and responsibilities and wide participation of NGO, private sector and regional organisations. 2. Build national people-centred <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> systems Country-based <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> systems are needed {{for the protection of}} citizens and also provide the building blocks of the global <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> system. The recommendation includes calls for a national multi-party roundtable on <b>early</b> <b>warning,</b> a national plan based on a survey of capabilities, a warning dissemination strategy, community-based approaches, public education and mock exercises. 3. Fill the main gaps in global <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> <b>capacities</b> The recommendation highlights gaps and opportunities that deserve immediate concerted action, including for tropical cyclones, floods and tsunamis for the most ill-protected populations, agreements and networking for drought, food security and wildland fire, a global survey and mobile monitoring facility for volcanoes and a major <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> project in each least-developed country. 4. Strengthen the scientific and data foundations for <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> The scientific and technical recommendation seeks action on a long-term global data plan, upgraded telecommunications, an agreement on basin-wide data exchange for floods, a pan-African project to fill major data gaps, improved hazard and vulnerability mapping, an <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> science and technology agenda and an internet portal for natural hazards, risks and warnings. 5. Develop the institutional foundations for a global <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> system This recommendation addresses the needs for underpinning mechanisms of international and regional governance, coordination and support, starting with a call for the UN system to affirm the goal of a global <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> system and including requests for various UN and international agencies in technical, humanitarian and development fields to undertake specific governance and support roles.

30|$|In summary, the Hyogo Framework for Action 2005 – 2015 {{helped to}} widen the remit of DRR {{activities}} beyond simply responding to disasters to include detailed risk assessment, improving <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> and response <b>capacities,</b> impact-based forecasting, better resource management, knowledge creation and sharing, building public commitment, and developing supportive institutional frameworks (HIS 2011). However, challenges remained in risk governance and assessment as well as monitoring, dissemination, capacity development, and shifting the culture from a hazard and response-driven culture to a risk-driven, integrated culture that encompasses the full DRR cycle from prevention to recovery and rehabilitation (IFRC 2014).|$|R
30|$|By {{the time}} the {{development}} of the successor to the Hyogo Framework was initiated, the need to widen the remit of DRR to activities beyond response to disasters had been identified. Efforts would now include detailed risk assessment, improving <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> and response <b>capacities,</b> impact-based forecasting, better resource management, knowledge creation and sharing, building public commitment, and developing supportive institutional frameworks. Challenges remained in the form of governance, capacity development, and financing among others (Shi et al. 2010; HSI 2011) as well as the need for stronger cross-linking to other policy agendas such as climate change and sustainable development (Schipper and Pelling 2006). The need for a more integrative DRR process that incorporates bottom-up and top-down actions, local scientific and technical knowledge, and a vast array of stakeholders was also clear (Gaillard and Mercer 2012). Programs such as the Integrated Risk Governance Project 4 of the ICSU Future Earth program emerged to respond to the strong interest in improved risk governance systems expressed by UN member states in the United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction.|$|R

40|$|Biofouling “ is {{referred}} to as the unwanted deposition and growth of biofilms. This phenomenon can occur in an extremely wide range of opportunities ranging from colonization of medical devices, production of ultrapure, drinking and process water, fouling of ship hulls, pipelines and reservoirs. It seriously damages the efficacy of membrane processes by forming a secondary membrane which, at a certain extent of growth, can interfere with the separation process. Countermeasures are usually based on a medical paradigm: if the causative microorganisms are killed, the problem is solved. However, biofilm organisms are much more resistant to biocides, and even if they are killed, they still can cause problems because of their physical presence. Low fouling membrane materials are of uttermost importance. Furthermore, dissolved or particulate substances in the water phase which serve as nutrients for microbial growth must be considered as potential biomass. Monitoring of biofilm accumulation provides <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> <b>capacity</b> and optimization of countermeasures.

40|$|The {{integration}} of gender specific indicators into early warning systems {{is crucial for}} sustaining an effective approach to estimating conflict potential. Conflict affects women and men differently and although these effects vary widely across cultures depending upon {{the role of women}} in a particular society, it is clear that armed conflict exacerbates inequalities (Gardam & Charlesworth 2000). The purpose of this paper is to propose measurable indicators sensitive to the experiences of women and enhance <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> <b>capacity</b> to account for these gendered elements of conflict. This task will be accomplished by the deconstruction of existing indicators and by the addition of indicators reflecting women's unique life experiences. The transition from gender-blind indicators to a gender sensitive analysis is critical for the accuracy of structural risk assessment. To begin with, there is an issue of semantics. The use of inclusive categories such as "people", "refugees", and "internally displaced persons", "conceals the inherent gender differentiation and the gender specificity of experiences and interests " (Sorensen 1998, 65). In keeping with the notion that women experience conflict and war differently than men, it is important to deconstruct existing variables. By referring to classifications such as refugees and IDPs without distinguishing the composition of thes...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Climate {{variability}} {{in combination with}} socio-economic processes acting on the land may induce a reduction of resource potential and hence cause land degradation. Any forecasting attempt to increase societal <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> <b>capacity</b> has to take the interaction between climate and socio-economics on the land into account. The DeSurvey Integrated Assessment Model (DeSurvey IAM) is a framework to develop policy support systems with the aim to support planners and policy makers that deal with regional development and desertification. Using the DeSurvey IAM, policy makers can carry out an integrated assessment {{of the impact of}} different external factors and policy options on a number of relevant indicators. The DeSurvey IAM has been developed with the objective to address a number of policy themes concerning regional development and desertification in arid and semi-arid regions: sustainable agriculture, water resource management and land degradation. By using these themes {{as a starting point for}} model integration and by linking the model to policy relevant drivers and indicators we intend to support policy makers at national and regional level by providing assistance in: 1. Understanding the important processes in a region or river basin as well as their mutual interaction; 2. Identification of current or future problems in the region or river basin; 3.

30|$|In 2004, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) {{developed}} a disaster risk index {{to calculate the}} multiple risks of mortality due to earthquakes, cyclones, floods, and droughts. The index {{was based on the}} vulnerability derived from eight social indicators: economy, type of economic activity, dependency on and quality of the environment, demography, health and sanitation, <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> <b>capacity,</b> education, and overall development at the national level (UNDP 2004). In the same year, the World Bank and Columbia University evaluated the vulnerability to multiple hazards and calculated the risk of mortality and economic losses caused by six hazards. These hazards included earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, landslides, floods, droughts, and cyclones, which were assessed based on the historical loss data available in the Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT) at a 2.5 ° ×  2.5 ° grid scale (Dilley et al. 2005). In 2013, the United Nations University (UNU) evaluated vulnerability at the national level based on 28 indicators from three societal perspectives: sensitivity, coping capacity, and adaptability. The UNU calculated the mortality risk due to five hazards (earthquakes, floods, cyclones, droughts, and sea-level rise), and used the product of exposure and vulnerability to generate the world risk index (UNU-EHS 2013). In 2014, the European Union Joint Research Centre (JRC) calculated a dynamic risk ranking of 191 countries by evaluating hazards and exposure, vulnerability, and coping capacity based on 53 indicators using the developed Index for Risk Management (INFORM) model (JRC 2014).|$|E

40|$|Protecting civilians {{has become}} the {{forefront}} of modern UN peace operations and {{has emerged as a}} principal objective. However, civilian suffering {{does not seem to have}} been diminished. This study believes that a proactive approach is imperative for the effect of the peace operation. Early warning is therefore viewed as a key concept to implement proactive measures before the violence occur. This study attempts to contribute in bridging the gap between the strategical importance of protecting civilians and the tactical ability to actually shield them from violence by presenting the idea that military geography can be an <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> <b>capacity.</b> The study argues that it is through a profound understanding of the dynamic of the violence in an area of operations that relevant geographical information needs are identified. To explore this idea, the study is set in the geographical context of Jonglei in South-Sudan. The perpetrators’ motivation for committing violent attacks against civilians classifies Jonglei as a traditional communal conflict scenario. Here, communities engage in continuous cycles of brutal attacks driven by revenge and self-protection. Military forces are likely to play an important role in protecting civilians in this scenario. It is however essential to identify protection areas in order to prioritize the deployment of troops. For this early warning is needed. This study seeks to demonstrate the process that translates an understanding of the elements of the violence dynamics into information requirements to be processed by the military geographer. The answer to these requirements are then visualized in products that exemplifies the kind of decision making support a military geographer can yield. These include migration patterns, grazing areas, infrastructure, ethnic areas and history of violence. Their aggregation allows for identification of protection areas where the threat of violence against civilians appear more imminent. By monitoring, analyzing and making assessments on the physical and human terrain, military geographers can thus support military decision makers as a warning capacity. The main finding is that given the right direction, military geography as a discipline is highly relevant for early warning even in a nuanced low intensity operation against irregular threats...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} combines ethnographic, interview, and {{documentary data}} gathered in Ethiopia to analyze famine <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> systems - large-scale information systems bringing together climate, food production, market, {{and public health}} data, which have become a major focus in international famine prevention efforts since the 1970 s. Famine <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> {{is part of a}} top-down international response that even many <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> experts themselves feel has been unable to solve the problems leading to famine. In Ethiopia, several different international, governmental, and nongovernmental organizations with different agendas have developed their own <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> systems. The information upon which humanitarian agencies act is a product of this complex political environment as well as particular understandings of famine that become fixed in the systems through the choice of indicators and analytic methods. The efforts of <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> practitioners and humanitarian agencies to separate technical aspects of <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> from their politics enables responses to famine that inevitably fail {{to address the needs of}} famine-affected people. Though the goal of <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> is to save lives by providing timely and accurate information, <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> experts have come to value objectivity, consensus, and transparency over accuracy because of constraints and pressures in their organizational environment. This, combined with donor governments' need for information they feel is credible, privileges certain kinds of expertise (that of <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> experts) over others (e. g. that of famine-affected people). Therefore, those officially responding to famine see those with the most direct experience of famine as lacking relevant knowledge and thus only capable of participating as passive aid recipients.

Timely and reliable data and information must be the cornerstone of effective drought policies and plans. In pursuit of the goal of improving the effectiveness of drought <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> systems, participants of the experts meeting were asked to address three fundamental questions: 1. What is your assessment of the current status of drought <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> systems? 2. What are the shortcomings, limitations, and needs for drought <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> systems? 3. How can drought <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> systems be improved to better support drought preparedness and mitigation efforts at the local, national, and international level? Participants identified the primary users of data and information derived from drought <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> systems as a first step in evaluating the status of <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> systems. Users were diverse, including government agencies, farmers, extension services, insurance companies, media, donors, NGOs, and the general public.

In general, where meteorological services were the lead agency, the information tended to be more meteorologically based. In contrast, leadership for drought <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> systems that were more agriculturally based tended to take a more multidisciplinary or integrated approach to monitoring. An integrated approach is considered preferable because information from all elements of the hydrologic system must be considered to obtain a comprehensive assessment of climate and water supply conditions. Although forecasting and monitoring are considered critical components of all <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> systems, there appeared to be little evidence of the beneficial use of that information by farmers. It was noted that few countries currently have a national drought policy in place. Australia is an exception and progress in South Africa and the United States was noted. It was apparent that other countries were moving in the direction of a national drought policy. In some instances, subnational policies were in existence. Comprehensive <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> systems should be the foundation on which national drought policies and plans are constructed. Although many countries have some type of drought <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> system in place, these systems are not comprehensive and have very limited financial and human resource inputs...|$|R
