She said: [...] "I just think back to all the things Steffy has been through. She {{has a lot of}} deep seeded [...] issues. That is where I think it stems from with her father leaving her, losing her sister, her mom sleeping with her sisterâ€™s boyfriend, etc. There are <b>just</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> traumatic things! Explaining her reaction to Steffy killing her cousin Aly Forrester (Ashlyn Pearce) in self-defense, Wood stated in August 2015: [...] "When I first heard about it, I was in major shock, of course. Then I started thinking about how everything bad happens to Steffy and that it makes sense that she's a murderer now. It's kind of perfect, really." ...|$|E
500|$|Particularly {{after his}} fastball slowed, Young relied upon his control. Young was once quoted as saying, [...] "Some {{may have thought}} it was {{essential}} to know how to curve a ball before anything else. Experience, to my mind, teaches to the contrary. Any young player who has good control will become a successful curve pitcher long before the pitcher who is endeavoring to master both curves and control at the same time. The curve is merely an accessory to control." [...] In addition to his exceptional control, Young was also a workhorse who avoided injury. For nineteen consecutive years, from 1891 through 1909, Young was in his leagues' top ten for innings pitched; in fourteen of the seasons, he was in the top five. Not until 1900, a decade into his career, did Young pitch two consecutive incomplete games. By habit, Young restricted his practice throws in spring training. [...] "I figured the old arm had <b>just</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> throws in it", said Young, [...] "and there wasn't any use wasting them." [...] Young once described his approach before a game: ...|$|E

60|$|There is {{a certain}} amount of {{suffering}} which must follow the rending of the great cords of life, suffering which is natural and inevitable; it cannot be argued down; it cannot be stilled; it can no more be soothed by any effort of faith and reason than the pain of a fractured limb, or the agony of fire on the living flesh. All that we can do is to brace ourselves to bear it, calling on God, as the martyrs did in the fire, and resigning ourselves to let it burn on. We must be willing to suffer, since God so wills. There are <b>just</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> waves to go over us, <b>just</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> arrows of stinging thought to be shot into our soul, <b>just</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> faintings and sinkings and revivings only to suffer again, belonging to and inherent in our portion of sorrow; and there is a work of healing that God has placed in the hands of Time alone.|$|E

She {{was in her}} own dressing-room, surrounded by the four girls; <b>just</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> pictures of alarm, interest, and female loveliness. Mary Warren alone, was in regular toilette; but the others, with instinctive coquetry, had contrived to wrap themselves up, {{in a way to}} render them handsomer than ever.

60|$|I hastened back to old Mary's cabin, and, halting not on {{the floor}} below, went {{directly}} into the loft, where, cutting the bonds that held Horry Sims's feet, I ordered him to follow me down the ladder. At that moment I would, {{had it not been}} for Uncle 'Rasmus's warning, have taken the gag from Abel Hunt's mouth that he might be saved <b>just</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> more moments of suffering; but having in mind all the old negro had advanced as an argument against showing such mercy, I withheld my hand, and Horry Sims followed me in surprise and bewilderment at this sudden change in affairs, as obediently as a well whipped cur would have done.|$|E
6000|$|An eclectic, if it mean anything, means this--one who in any {{branch of}} art or science refuses to {{acknowledge}} Bacon's great law, that [...] "Nature is only conquered by obeying her;" [...] {{who will not}} take a full and reverent view of the whole mass of facts with which he has to deal, and from them deducing the fundamental laws of his subject, obey them whithersoever they may lead; but who picks and chooses out of them <b>just</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> as may be pleasant to his private taste, and then constructs a partial system which differs from the essential ideas of Nature {{in proportion to the}} number of facts which he has determined to discard.|$|E
6000|$|This {{was what}} the apostles taught the heathen, and their words were true. [...] You may see them come true round you every day. For, my friends, just as far as people pray for Christ's grace, and give {{themselves}} up to be led by God's Spirit, they become full of grace themselves, courteous and civil, loving and amiable, true and honourable--a pleasure to themselves and to all round them. While, on the other hand; all rudeness, all ill- temper, all selfishness, all greediness are <b>just</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> sins against the grace of Christ, which grieve the Spirit of God, {{at the same time}} that they grieve our neighbours for whom Christ died, and cut us off, as long as we give way to them, from the communion of saints.|$|E

The man who tends to Jone hangs up his watch on a little stand {{on the edge of the}} bathtub, and he stays in <b>just</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> minutes, and when he's ready to come out he rings a bell, and then he's wrapped up in about fourteen hot towels, and sits in an armchair until he's dry. Jone likes all this, and says so much about it that it makes me want to try it too; though as there isn't any reason for it I haven't tried them yet.|$|E
60|$|In the old times, {{whenever}} two fast boats {{started out}} on a race, with a big crowd of people looking on, it was inspiring to hear the crews sing, especially if the time were night-fall, and the forecastle lit up with the red glare of the torch-baskets. Racing was royal fun. The public always had an idea that racing was dangerous; whereas the opposite was the case--that is, after the laws were passed which restricted each boat to <b>just</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> pounds of steam to the square inch. No engineer was ever sleepy or careless when his heart was in a race. He was constantly on the alert, trying gauge-cocks and watching things. The dangerous place was on slow, plodding boats, where the engineers drowsed around and allowed chips {{to get into the}} 'doctor' and shut off the water supply from the boilers.|$|E
60|$|Their preacher's {{explanation}} of {{the manner in which}} every woman came to be possessed of <b>just</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> devils appeared to them of little importance. What they objected to was the fundamental doctrine of his sermon, which was based on his assertion that the Bible declared every woman had seven devils. They were not willing to believe that the Bible said any such thing. Some of them {{went so far as to}} state it was their opinion that Uncle Pete had got this fool notion from some of the lawyers at the court-house when he was on a jury a month or so before. It was quite noticeable that, although Sunday afternoon had scarcely begun, the majority of the women of the congregation called their minister Uncle Pete. This was very strong evidence of a sudden decline in his popularity.|$|E
