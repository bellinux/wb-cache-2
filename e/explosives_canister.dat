5|$|The second <b>explosive</b> <b>canister,</b> {{lying on}} the bottom, {{exploded}} close to the Austrian freighter Wien, resulting in her sinking.|$|R
25|$|Two {{different}} models of high explosive ammunition were produced for the CM60A1: the M35/47, {{which had a}} range of 1,600 metres, and the M61, which has a range of 2,000 metres. Other specialized projectiles included canister and illumination rounds. South Africa manufactured its own range of high <b>explosive,</b> <b>canister,</b> and illumination rounds for the K1, {{as well as a}} unique smoke projectile.|$|R
5000|$|An al-Qaeda {{military}} official warned the Lebanese government to stop {{attacks on the}} Fatah al-Islam cell, or else [...] "we will tear out your hearts with traps and surround your places with <b>explosive</b> <b>canisters,</b> and target all your businesses, beginning with tourism and ending with other rotten industries... We warn you for the last time, and after it there will only be rivers of blood." ...|$|R
5000|$|Once Gabe finally {{arrives at}} the Titan Mines exit, he is fired upon by his {{superior}} officer, Victor Bartlett, {{who is in a}} gunship. After launching <b>explosive</b> <b>canisters</b> at the gunship, Gabe is able to force Victor to retreat. Gabe then demands an answer for his commander's seemingly random act of violence, leading to the revelation that Gabe's wife Lexine is on the list of key subjects to terminate because of her involvement in the [...] "Oracle program", which {{has something to do with}} Lexine's recent pregnancy.|$|R
25|$|The {{impetus for}} the treaty, {{like that of the}} 1997 Ottawa Treaty to limit landmines, has been concern over the severe damage and risks to civilians from {{explosive}} weapons during and long after attacks. A varying proportion of submunitions dispersed by cluster bombs fail to explode on impact and can lie unexploded for years until disturbed. The sometimes brightly colored munitions are not camouflaged, but have been compared to toys or Easter eggs, attracting children at play. Human rights activists claim that one in four casualties resulting from submunitions that fail to explode on impact are children who often pick up and play with the <b>explosive</b> <b>canisters</b> well after the conflict has ended. The 2006 Lebanon War provided momentum for the campaign to ban cluster bombs. The United Nations estimated that up to 40% of Israeli cluster bomblets failed to explode on impact. Norway organized the independent Oslo process after discussions at the traditional disarmament forum in Geneva fell through in November 2006.|$|R
50|$|The gun was {{ideal for}} {{infantry}} support. The large, low velocity gun could fire a large <b>explosive</b> shell or <b>canister</b> shot. In comparison, high-velocity anti-tank guns over-penetrated soft targets, while smaller caliber weapons could not carry {{as great a}} payload.|$|R
25|$|A diverse set {{of enemies}} is present, which usually require being {{approached}} with different tactics: some coordinate in groups to out-maneuver or out-position the player; others, {{such as the}} Manhack, fly directly at the player through small openings and tight corridors. Others use predictable but powerful attacks, while others hide before swiftly attacking the player. Gordon can kill most enemies with his weapons, or make use of indirect means, exploiting environmental hazards such as <b>explosive</b> pressurized <b>canisters,</b> gas fires or improvised traps. For some portions of the game, Gordon can be joined by up to four armed Resistance soldiers or medics, and can send his team further from him or call them back.|$|R
50|$|Types of {{ammunition}} included HEAT, High <b>Explosive</b> Plastic-Tracer (HEP-T), <b>canister,</b> High <b>Explosive</b> Anti Personnel, and the M368 dummy round {{which could not}} be fired and was used for crew drill. The original U.S. HEAT round penetrated more than 400 mm of armor. Near the end of the M40's service life, both Austria and Sweden produced HEAT rounds for the weapon capable of penetrating more than 700 mm of armor.|$|R
500|$|In the west, the Union {{troops had}} fallen {{back to the}} Seminary and built hasty breastworks running [...] north-south before the western face of Schmucker Hall, bolstered by 20 guns of Wainwright's battalion. Dorsey Pender's {{division}} of Hill's Corps stepped through the exhausted lines of Heth's men at about 4:00 p.m. to finish off the I Corps survivors. The brigade of Brig. Gen. Alfred M. Scales attacked first, on the northern flank. His five regiments of 1,400 North Carolinians were virtually annihilated {{in one of the}} fiercest artillery barrages of the war, rivaling Pickett's Charge to come, but on a more concentrated scale. Twenty guns spaced only [...] apart fired spherical case, <b>explosive</b> shells, <b>canister,</b> and double canister rounds into the approaching brigade, which emerged from the fight with only 500 men standing and a single lieutenant in command. Scales wrote afterwards that he found [...] "only a squad here and there marked the place where regiments had rested." ...|$|R
5000|$|Neuse was {{equipped}} with two 6.4 in Brooke rifled cannon (similar to a Parrott rifle); each double-banded cannon weighed more than [...] with its pivot carriage and other attached hardware. Both cannons were positioned along the ironclad's center-line in the armored casemate, one forward, the other aft. The field of fire for both pivot rifles was 180-degrees, from port to starboard: Each cannon could fire from one of five gun port positions or could deliver a two cannon broadside. Neuses projectiles consisted of <b>explosive</b> shells, anti-personnel <b>canister</b> shot, grape shot, and blunt-nosed, solid wrought iron [...] "bolts" [...] for use against Union armored ships; many examples of all four types were recovered from her raised wreck.|$|R
50|$|The seam was 4 foot 9 inch thick, and colliers drilled shot holes 18 {{inches from}} the roof at intervals. These shot holes were charged and fired by a deputy. The day shift deputy, George Paley, had fired 8 shots before he reached the working place known as number 8. Each shot used 6 ounces of explosive, and Paley had started with 5 pounds of <b>explosive</b> in his <b>canister.</b> Paley fired his ninth shot at one side of No.8’s gate without incident. The {{explosion}} occurred when Paley fired his tenth shot 6 yards {{to the right of}} the centre of No.8’s gate, five minutes after his ninth shot. A large accumulation of firedamp in explosive proportions had accumulated in the workings at the moment the shot was fired. The resulting explosion was slightly exacerbated by coal dust, which increased the flame of the explosion.|$|R
5000|$|Albemarle was {{equipped}} with two 6.4 in Brooke rifled cannon (similar to a Parrott rifle); each double-banded cannon weighed more than 12000 lb with its pivot carriage and other attached hardware. Both cannons were positioned along the ironclad's center-line in the armored casemate, one forward, the other aft. The field of fire for both pivot rifles was 180-degrees, from port to starboard: each cannon could fire from one of three gun ports, allowing Albemarle to deliver a two cannon broadside. Albemarles projectiles consisted of <b>explosive</b> shells, anti-personnel <b>canister</b> shot, grape shot, and blunt-nosed, solid wrought iron [...] "bolts" [...] for use against Union armored ships. These were an early attempt at armor-piercing shot; solid iron like a typical solid shot, but enlongated rather than spherical, giving far more weight for an equal frontal area than a traditional round ball, and thus greater penetration. Such projectiles could not be effectively fired from a traditional smoothbore naval gun, as the lack of stability would cause the shot to tumble in flight.|$|R
25|$|On 28 January, further {{demonstrations and}} clashes {{took place in}} eleven cities, {{including}} those in the Suez Canal, Alexandria, Monufia and Cairo. The clashes resulted in six deaths. Thousands of people gathered in the Tahrir Square to show their solidarity with those killed over the weekend early in the day. Police fired tear gas at protesters near the Qasr al-Nil Bridge, while further violence spread along the Nile. Protesters also set fire to security vehicles and detained a police officer. The Shura Council approved the President state of emergency decision as per the Constitution requirement. And to aid the police, it approved a law granting judicial seizure powers to the Army. A funeral procession Port Said devolved into a street battle between mourners and police, with security troops firing tear gas and live ammunition at crowds from police buildings across the city; protesters threw rocks, <b>explosives</b> and gas <b>canisters</b> back at police, {{and by the end}} of the day civilians across the city were seen carrying guns. A Ministry of the Interior spokesman, however, denied that police had fired on protesters, and said that tear gas had been used only briefly. By the end of the day, a total of 50 people were estimated to have died since the January protests began.|$|R
500|$|The two Milwaukee-class ships bombarded Fort Morgan {{for about}} an hour and a half while the wooden ships passed through the mouth of Mobile Bay; Winnebago {{beginning}} at 07:15 even though her forward turret was still jammed in place. About three-quarters of an hour later, Tecumseh struck a [...] "torpedo" [...] and sank rapidly. Winnebago took on board 10 survivors from the ill-fated Tecumseh who had been rescued by a boat from Metacomet under heavy fire and passed Ft. Morgan at 08:30. After Tennessee first attacked Stevens' former command, the gunboat , he was able to interpose Winnebago between the two ships in case the Confederate ironclad turned around for another attack, but it disengaged and briefly sought the shelter of Ft. Morgan's guns. Around 09:10 the traversing gear for the rear turret broke down, only five minutes before Winnebago received the order to attack the Tennessee after it had sortied into the middle of Mobile Bay to attack the Union squadron. The monitor was forced to turn the entire ship to bring her guns to bear and did not play a significant part in the second phase of the battle before Tennessee was forced to surrender at 09:45. During the battle, Winnebago was hit 19 times, three of which penetrated the deck near her aft turret, although she suffered no casualties. Despite the problems with her turrets, the ship managed to fire 56 shells, a mixture of solid shot, <b>explosive</b> shells, grapeshot, <b>canister</b> shot, and shrapnel shells.|$|R
