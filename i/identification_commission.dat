40|$|Several {{emerging}} applications require {{fast and}} precise torque control. Torque measurements are still expensive, bulky and delicate. On the other hand, estimation techniques are all valid in principle, but their accuracy is largely affected by model <b>identification</b> and <b>commissioning.</b> This paper adopts {{a simple and}} effective torque observer based on voltage and current measurements. It includes all motor losses, to get an enhanced overall accuracy, along with an extremely fast response. The key-feature is the commissioning procedure, based {{on a set of}} off-line measurements. The procedure details, as well as the successful experimental results on a real prototype, are reported in the paper...|$|R
40|$|Active {{magnetic}} bearing (AMB) {{is an ideal}} bearing solution for high performance and energy efficient applications. Proper operation of AMB can be achieved only with advanced feedback control techniques. An identified system model is required for synthesizing high performance model based controllers. System identification is the preferred method for obtaining an accurate model. Therefore, it becomes a prerequisite for the commissioning of AMB. System <b>identification</b> for <b>commissioning</b> poses some challenges and special requirements. In this thesis, system identification of AMB is approached {{within the context of}} commissioning. A procedure for identification is developed and applied to experimental data from a prototype AMB system. The identification procedure is based on the so called prediction error method, and it has been performed in the frequency domain. A linear state-space model, along with the required parameters, is successfully identified...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} the practical {{results of the}} design analysis, <b>commissioning,</b> <b>identification,</b> sensor calibration, and tuning of an active magnetic bearing (AMB) control system for a laboratory gas blower. The presented step-by-step procedures, including modeling and disturbance analysis for different design choices, are necessary to reach the full potential of the prototype in research and industrial applications. The key results include estimation of radial and axial disturbance forces caused by the permanent magnet (PM) rotor and a discussion on differences between the unbalance forces resulting from the PM motor and the induction motor in the AMB rotor system...|$|R
50|$|MINURSO, the Secretary-General Kofi Annan and his Special Envoy and Special Representative {{were all}} working in Western Sahara {{to assist in}} the {{implementation}} of the Settlement Plan which included a referendum on self-determination {{for the people of the}} territory. The responsibility of the voter identification process was with the <b>Identification</b> <b>Commission.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The Security Council {{reaffirmed the}} {{agreement}} between the Government of Morocco and the Polisario Front on {{the implementation of the}} Settlement Plan, and that the responsibility for voter identification was that of the <b>Identification</b> <b>Commission.</b> It also reiterated the need for a referendum on self-determination for the people of Western Sahara in accordance with the Settlement Plan.|$|E
50|$|Receiving {{a report}} from the Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali {{pursuant}} to Resolution 1017 (1995), the Council stressed the need for progress {{to be made in the}} implementation of the Settlement Plan which had been accepted by Morocco and the Polisario Front and reiterated its commitment to holding a referendum. It was also noted that the <b>Identification</b> <b>Commission</b> could only carry out its work with the full trust of both parties in its judgement and integrity.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the current state}} of evaluations of health care interventions in the European Union, from the <b>identification</b> and <b>commissioning</b> of research through to its impact on policy and practice. Material is drawn from a survey conducted for the ASTEC project as well as a review of literature. Although the use of evaluative research has increased substantially in the last decade, both the pace of change and preferred research methodologies employed differ markedly. Much research still concentrates on issues of safety, efficacy and effectiveness, although there is evidence of an increasing emphasis on cost-effectiveness. Many countries are beginning to introduce systems linking economic evaluation to the decision-making process, while networks for the exchange of information continue to evolve. Research capacity in the public sector, although improving, is uneven, in part due to the uncertainty over long term career prospects and competition from industry. Capacity building measures should in particular ensure that dissemination expertise is strengthened, and that more emphasis is placed on developing receptor capacity within different stakeholder groups. Linking knowledge production to changes in practice remains a key challenge. Further research on implementation and impact assessment is required, to help demonstrate the value of evaluations on both policy and practice...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{technique}} for closed-loop sytem identification of reduced-order models is presented. The method {{arrives at a}} process model and its corresponding compensator in an iterative fashion by introducing a series of step changes at the manipulated variable/setpoint. The bias introduced into the identification data set by the closed-loop system, coupled with a control-relevant prefilter, yields a model whose corresponding control system improves its performance at every step. The method is appealing to chemical engineering practitioners because it combines the tasks of system <b>identification</b> with controller <b>commissioning</b> to produce a simple-to-use yet reliable autotuning procedure. 1. Introduction Identification testing in the chemical process industries is commonly conducted while the plant is in normal operation. As a result, the identification test must be designed such that the important process variables do not deviate significantly from setpoint. One way of achieving this requireme [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The LHCb {{experiment}} {{has been}} designed to perform precision measurements on CP asymmetries and rare decay searches of B mesons. The LHCb construction and installation has been finished early summer last year. The experiment is ready to exploit first data from CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The very first data collected with a minimal interaction trigger should allow the space alignment of the detector to be performed. Then, when energy and momentum scales have been calibrated, the particle <b>identification</b> will be <b>commissioned.</b> The trigger will also be commissioned ready for data-taking in 2010, when LHCb's nominal luminosity should be reached and the full physics programme deployed. First measurements comprise inclusive particle production, where final states containing a pair of oppositely charged muons (e. g. J/ psi production) will be isolated. We will report on the commissioning of the different subsystems performed with cosmic data and the few particle beams delivered by the accelerator last year and the progress made toward the first physics measurements...|$|R
5000|$|The {{proposal}} by the Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali concerning the {{interpretation and application}} of criteria for voter eligibility was welcomed, while concern was expressed over continuing difficulties and delays {{in the work of}} the <b>Identification</b> <b>Commission.</b> The Commission was requested to complete the analysis of all applications received and proceed with the identification and registration of potential voters by 30 June 1994, with the Secretary-General reporting back on developments no later than 15 July 1994 with regard to the work of the Commission and other areas relevant to the Settlement Plan.|$|E
5000|$|Both {{parties were}} {{requested}} {{to allow the}} United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to conduct preparatory work for the repatriation of Saharan refugees eligible to vote. Additionally {{they were asked to}} agree to a package of measures concerning the appeals process, the role of the UNHCR and the future stages of the Settlement Plan by mid-November 1998. The resolution regretted that the technical support unit was still not fully operational and called for the conclusion of a Status of Forces Agreement which would facilitate the deployment of military units in Western Sahara. It supported the intention of MINURSO to publish the voter lists by 1 December 1998 and an increase in staff at the <b>Identification</b> <b>Commission</b> from 18 to 25 as well as necessary support personnel.|$|E
5000|$|Starting in 2000, {{there were}} new {{attempts}} {{to salvage the}} peace process, like the Baker Plan (Plans I and II); again with forceful US backing. These documents both involved full voting rights for all persons resident in the territory, including those Polisario had referred to as [...] "settlers", irrespective of what MINURSO's voter <b>identification</b> <b>commission</b> had arrived at. The first Baker plan was circulated as a draft, and energetically supported by Morocco, but after Polisario voiced equally strong opposition, it was discarded by the Security Council. In contrast, the latter, more detailed version was sponsored by a UN Security Council resolution (SCR 1495) {{in the summer of}} 2003, and thereafter cautiously accepted by Polisario, allegedly after strong Algerian pressure. However, it was categorically refused by Morocco {{on the grounds that it}} included independence as a ballot option; after the arrival of Mohammed VI of Morocco to the throne, in 1999, Morocco had reneged on its 1991 and 1997 agreements on a vote on independence. Polisario argued that Morocco had thus broken a main condition of the 1991 cease-fire agreement, which had wholly hinged on the independence referendum, but despite this, it did not resume fighting.|$|E
30|$|The global {{auto-injector}} {{market is}} expected to grow further in coming years, and the technology is evolving rapidly. Hence, the present analysis should be updated regularly, in order to take the latest trends and developments into account. In this context, the present review is in line with the European Union’s latest adaptations of medical device regulations. One of the new regulations’ most important objectives is to improve transparency and traceability by establishing a European-wide database on medical devices and a system for unique device <b>identification</b> (UDI) (European <b>Commission</b> 2018). A centralized, complete documentation of all known safety-related issues, accessible to all stakeholders, will help to decrease the repeated occurrence of these problems. Accordingly, we are confident that the present review will help to further improve the safety of disposable auto- and pen injectors. In order to enhance the benefits of this work, the detailed data provided here should be extended by performing an in-depth analysis of incident reports to achieve a holistic view of use errors of disposable auto-injection devices (Marcilly et al., 2016). However, the results of this type of reviews will always be just a development aid and cannot replace the knowledge and experience of human factors engineering experts for the conception and development of medical devices.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} {{randomized}} methods for feedback design of uncertain systems. The first contribution is to derive the sample complexity of various constrained control problems. In particular, we show the key {{role played by}} the binomial distribution and related tail inequalities, and compute th e sample complexity. This contribution significantly improves the existing results by reducing the number of required samples in the andomized algorithm. These results are then applied to the analysis of worst-case performance and design with robust optimization. The second contribution of the paper is to introduce a general class of sequential algorithms, denote das Sequential Probabilistic Validation (SPV). In these se quential algorithms, at each iteration, a candidate solution is prob abilistically validated, and corrected if necessary, to me et the required specifications. The results we derive provide the sample com plexity which guarantees that the solutions obtained with SPV algorithms meet some pre-specified probabilistic accuracy and confidence. The performance of these algorithms is illus trated and compared with other existing methods using a numerical e xample dealing with robust system <b>identification.</b> MCYT.

40|$|SafeLand is a Large-scale {{integrating}} Collaborative {{research project}} {{funded by the}} FP 7 of the European <b>Commission.</b> <b>Identification</b> of landslide hazard and risk hotspots {{was one of the}} major tasks {{in the beginning of the}} project. For that purpose three different models were developed, all of them using the same input data for entire Europe. Common for the three models was the identification of Italy as the country with the highest exposure to landslide risk. However, the small alpine countries had the highest relative exposure compared to their total land area and population. Overall, 4 to 7 million people in Europe, as well as significant amount of infrastructure are exposed to landslide threat. In the expectation of a changing climate, the question arises on how the level and spatial pattern of landslide hazard and risk in Europe will develop in the 21 st century. To answer this question, several factors must be considered. Not only will the climate change in the next 90 years, but also the demography and land cover in Europe will change significantly. The main objective of the present study was therefore to quantify the landslide hazard and risk in Europe now and in the future and see if there will be significant changes. Changing precipitation pattern, land cover and population were used as input to assess the landslide hazard and risk in the years 2030, 2050, 2070 and 2090. The results were then compared to the present situation in 2010. The effect of climate change varies depending on the type of landslide. In this study the focus was on precipitation-induced landslides, which are a direct consequence of the extreme precipitation events and therefore closely coupled to a change in the frequency of extreme events. The study showed that climate change and changes in land cover will only cause minor variations in landslide hazard. The risk associated with landslides, however, is expected to change significantly due to changing patterns of population in Europe. JRC. H. 5 -Land Resources Managemen...|$|R
40|$|In mass {{disasters}} dental {{investigation is}} carried out with the object of contributing odontologically to {{the identification of the}} victims. In order to discuss some of these problems, let us consider the case of an airplane crash, a type of accident that seems to be becoming all too frequent nowadays. Some general points are worth reviewing. Since identification is a procedure of far-reaching legal and social consequences to the family of the deceased as well as to society, it should be effected quickly and posi-tively. In mass disasters, responsibility for identification has to be placed {{in the hands of an}} expert commission. In view of experiences gained in many accidents all over the world as well as in a number of Scandinavian disasters of recent years, it is reasonable to advocate that any <b>identification</b> <b>commission</b> should include, besides at least one trained police officer and one medical expert, also one dental expert. Every country should assume responsibility for identification in accidents occurring within its own sphere of jurisdiction. However, in the case of airplane accidents, these may involve a number of international aspects. For one thing, the victims may be o...|$|E
