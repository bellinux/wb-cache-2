5|$|Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm {{served as}} the {{flagship}} of the Imperial fleet from her commissioning in 1894 until 1900. She saw limited active duty during her service career with the German fleet due to the relatively peaceful nature of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. As a result, her career focused on training exercises and goodwill visits to foreign ports. These training maneuvers were nevertheless very important to developing German naval tactical doctrine in the two decades before World War <b>I,</b> <b>especially</b> {{under the direction of}} Alfred von Tirpitz. She, along with her three sisters, saw only one major overseas deployment, to China in 1900–01, during the Boxer Rebellion. The ship underwent a major modernization in 1904–05.|$|E

These training maneuvers were nevertheless very important to developing German naval tactical doctrine in the two decades before World War <b>I,</b> <b>especially</b> under the direction of Alfred von Tirpitz. Weissenburg, along with her three sisters, saw only one major overseas deployment during this period, to China in 1900–1901, during the Boxer Rebellion.

5|$|Brandenburg {{served with}} the I Division during {{the first decade of}} her service with the fleet. This period was {{generally}} limited to training exercises and goodwill visits to foreign ports. These training maneuvers were nevertheless very important to developing German naval tactical doctrine in the two decades before World War <b>I,</b> <b>especially</b> under the direction of Alfred von Tirpitz. The ship saw her first major deployment in 1900, when she and her three sister ships were deployed to China to suppress the Boxer Rebellion. In the early 1900s, all four ships were heavily rebuilt. She was obsolete by the start of World War I and only served in a limited capacity, initially as a coastal defense ship. In December 1915, she was withdrawn from active service and converted into a barracks ship. Brandenburg was scrapped in Danzig, after the war, in 1920.|$|E

He agreed {{that the war was}} necessary for the survival of France and Britain, but felt that only those Canadians who volunteered for service should be sent to the battlefields of Europe. His {{opposition to}} conscription brought him the anglophone public's disfavour, as expressed by hostile crowd amassed in Ottawa that threw vegetables and eggs during his oration.|$|E

In the 1916 Battle of Jutland, the British and German navies clashed with no decisive result. The term [...] "dreadnought" [...] gradually dropped from use after World War <b>I,</b> <b>especially</b> after the Washington Naval Treaty, as virtually all remaining battleships shared dreadnought characteristics; the term {{can also be used to}} describe battlecruisers, the other type of ship resulting from the dreadnought revolution.|$|E

500|$|Ebert and Roeper {{gave the}} film a [...] "two thumbs up" [...] rating, with Roger Ebert saying, [...] "I liked the action, I liked the absurdity, I liked the incongruous use and misuse of mutant powers, and <b>I</b> <b>especially</b> {{liked the way}} it {{introduces}} all of those political issues and lets them fight {{it out with the}} special effects." [...] Stephanie Zacharek of Salon.com gave it a mixed review, noting that it was [...] "only half a mess", and that Ratner [...] "could have stuck a bit more closely to the 'Dark Phoenix' narrative than he did." [...] However, Zacharek did note that that third act captured some of the original story's [...] "majesty".|$|E
500|$|Price Peterson, {{writing for}} TV.com, gave a glowing review, calling it [...] "the best-yet episode of Veronica Mars". He {{elaborated}} by stating, This episode {{was just a}} total triumph for how it brought together SO MUCH from the past 22 episodes and beyond. I loved the Aaron Echolls assassination. I loved that last image of Duncan enjoying his victory in a perpetual magic hour on some Australian beach. <b>I</b> <b>especially</b> loved the It's a Wonderful Life-esque dream sequence. This episode was so good that even though I knew Beaver was the bad guy, I still came away shocked {{by many of the}} reveals. That's just good writing right there. Conversely, Television Without Pity gave the episode a [...] "B+".|$|E
500|$|Very {{little is}} known about the first five kings of Macedonia (or the first eight kings {{depending}} on which royal chronology is accepted). There is much greater evidence for the reigns of Amyntas I of Macedon (...) and his successor Alexander <b>I,</b> <b>especially</b> due to the aid given by the latter to the Persian commander Mardonius at the Battle of Platea in 479 BC, during the Greco-Persian Wars. Although stating that the first several kings listed by Herodotus were most likely legendary figures, historian Robert Malcolm Errington uses the rough estimate of twenty-five years for the reign of each of these kings to assume that the capital Aigai (modern Vergina) could have been under their rule since roughly the mid-7th century BC, during the Archaic period.|$|E

Moniteur des théâtres wrote that Grisi [...] "runs [...] flies across the stage like a gazelle in love". One critic made {{a detailed analysis of}} the music in La France Musicale. He thought the Act I waltz [...] "ravishing" [...] and noted that the scene of Berthe's [...] was filled with [...] "quite new" [...] harmonic modulations. He praised other moments in Act <b>I</b> (<b>especially</b> the mad scene), and was in raptures with the music of Act II, singling out the entrance of the Wilis and the viola solo played through Giselle's last moments. He thought the flute and harp music accompanying Giselle as she disappeared into her grave at ballet's end [...] "full of tragic beauty." ...|$|E
500|$|Robin Oliver {{rates the}} episode [...] "thumbs up" [...] {{in a review}} in The Sydney Morning Herald, where she says of The Simpsons as a series: [...] "this encouragingly funny show knows how to tug at the heartstrings". Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood comment on the episode in their book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide: [...] "..the {{highlight}} of this episode has to be Marge's training, especially her sharpshooting on the firing range". In {{a review of the}} sixth season of The Simpsons, Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide writes that the episode surpasses the quality of the previous episode [...] "'Round Springfield": [...] "After the dull '’Round', Season Six rebounds with the pretty good 'Connection'. I can’t quite figure out how Marge stays in such good shape, but her escapades as a cop are funny, and the episode works best when she arrests Homer. <b>I</b> <b>especially</b> like his refusal to remain silent." ...|$|E

[...] Walt Disney wrote, [...] "I thought your Four Freedoms were great. <b>I</b> <b>especially</b> loved the Freedom of Worship and the composition and symbolism expressed in it." [...] Rockwell believed that Freedom of Worship and Freedom of Speech were his better results in the series. Laura Claridge has written that the inspirational phrase [...] "Each according to the dictates of his own conscience" [...] is a [...] "platitude that suggests the plurality of Rockwell's own thoughts on religion: its likely source was a phrase included in the Thirteen Articles of Faith by Joseph Smith." [...] In fact, Rockwell repeatedly asked colleagues about possible sources of the quote and was not told about Smith's writing until after the series was published. The expression [...] "according to the dictates of his conscience" [...] (or a similar variation) was used in many United States state constitutions in the eighteenth century.|$|E

It's hilarious. Best part of the show, in my opinion." [...] Ian Jane of DVD Talk said [...] " [...] is absolutely worth a watch thanks to the series high standard of quality, quirky animation, and multilayered humor." [...] Erich Asperschlager of DVD Verdict called the episode [...] "a fun take on beach bunny surf fare, and is backed by a decent sextet of recent SpongeBob adventures." [...] David Hinckly of the New York Daily News gave the episode 4/5 stars and said [...] "It's all good when you never forget to have fun." [...] The Daily Mirror described the vocal appearance of Johnny Depp as [...] "totally wavelicious (or something)."

Martin Skeggs of The Guardian commented, [...] "There's everything you {{ever wanted to}} know about the world's number one film star, including how he was introduced to Scientology (John Travolta whacked him over the head with a shovel), the time he met Nicole Kidman and asked her if she would mind sitting down to make him look taller". He characterized the parody as, [...] "A toned down version of real life, then." [...] Barry McDonald of the Evening Times described the episode as [...] "equally cruel and sidesplittingly hilarious". He commented, [...] "This is as close to must-watch television as you're likely to get and a testament to the quality of comedy writing on display." [...] In a later review of the program for the Evening Times when it was shown again on re-runs, McDonald wrote, [...] "I don't care if it's been shown several times before, {{this is one of the}} shows which you just have to see again." [...] Anila Baig of The Sun {{highlighted the}} show as [...] "Best Spoof", and wrote, [...] "pint-sized Hollywood superstar Tom Cruise [...] is subjected to some serious mocking. We follow his film career, his marriages to Nicole Kidman and Katie Holmes (portrayed as a robot) and how everything in his life has been shaped by his belief in Scientology. The show is as crude as ever". Stephen Milton of The Sun described the parody of Cruise's appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show as [...] "the best gag in the whole episode". Aidan Smith of Scotland on Sunday wrote favorably of the show, and noted, [...] "Fearlessly, in view of how paranoid Scientologists are, the latest target was Tom Cruise. <b>I</b> <b>especially</b> liked the scene where the tiny screen giant winched himself, Mission Impossible-style, on to Nicole Kidman while she slugged from a tinnie like a good Sheila." ...|$|E
