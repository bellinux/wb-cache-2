40|$|Positron-emitting beta-adrenoceptor ligands for the CNS {{could allow}} {{determination}} {{of changes in}} P-adrenoceptor availability after treatment of patients with norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants, and differential diagnosis between multiple sclerosis and other brain disorders in {{an early stage of}} the disease. No ligands suitable for this purpose are available for human use. In order to prepare a tracer for human studies, we labeled the biologically active enantiomer of the beta-blocker <b>exaprolol</b> with C- 11. <b>Exaprolol</b> has the appropriate lipophilicity (log P + 1. 6) for entry of the CNS and is claimed to be a very potent beta-adrenenoceptor antagonist. (S) -Desisopropyl-exaprolol was synthesized by reaction of 2 -hexylphenol with (S) -glycidyl-nosylate followed by ring opening using ammonia gas. The desisopropyl precursor was reacted with C- 11 -acetone in methanol to produce (S) -[C- 11]-exaprolol. Radiochemical purification was performed with RP-HPLC and was followed by Sep-Pak formulation. The labeled product was i. v. injected into male Wistar rats. Brain images were acquired using a microPET Focus 220 and the biodistribution of C- 11 was assessed. The radiochemical yield of (S) -[C- 11]-exaprolol was 7 % with a total synthesis time of 30 min. Specific activities were > 10 GBq/mu mol. Brain uptake of the tracer reached a maximum after 15 min. Standardized uptake values were moderate (0. 5 - 0. 9) but sufficient for imaging. However, beta-blockade (propranolol, 2. 5 mg/kg body weight) did not lower tracer uptake in any CNS region and washout from the brain was not accelerated when propranolol was administered 40 min after injection of (S) -[C- 11]-exaprolol. Tracer binding in lung, spleen and erythrocytes was lowered after beta-blockade, but the myocardial uptake of radioactivity was not affected. These data indicate that (S) -[C- 11]-exaprolol is not a suitable P-adrenoceptor ligand for PET, probably because the in vivo affinity of <b>exaprolol</b> to beta-adrenoceptors is in the nM rather than the sub-nM range. The observed inhibition of tracer uptake in lung, spleen and erythrocytes seems due to an interaction of propranolol with amine transporters rather than beta-adrenoceptors. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|A {{model is}} {{described}} (anaesthetized, open-chest cats subjected to acute coronary artery occlusion) {{which allows the}} effects of drug interventions to be determined on one major electrocardiographic index of myocardial ischaemia. Epicardial ST-segment changes were continuously recorded from five individual sites {{on the surface of}} the left ventricle. Coronary artery occlusion (left anterior descending branch) resulted in marked and consistent elevations of the ST-segment in all sites in nearly all experiments. These changes started within 1 min of the onset of ischaemia and reached a peak at between 30 and 60 min; thereafter there was a gradual reduction over the next 4 h. The one significant haemodynamic effect of coronary artery occlusion was an increase in left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP). Ventricular ectopic activity was not pronounced in this model (about 50 ectopic beats over the initial 30 min post-occlusion period). <b>Exaprolol</b> (1. 0 mg kg- 1, intravenously) a potent beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent with 'membrane stabilising activity', when given 1 h after the onset of ischaemia, reduced heart rate and LV dP/dtmax and increased LVEDP. These effects were prolonged (i. e. little recovery in heart rate 3 h after administration). <b>Exaprolol</b> decreased total ST-segment elevation immediately after administration; this was significantly different from the effect of intravenous saline and lasted for at least 3 h. The effects appeared to be greater at sites of less pronounced ischaemia. Intramyocardial temperature records were taken to indicate a reduction in blood flow to the ischaemic region; however the alleviation of epicardial ST-segment elevation suggests an improved myocardial oxygen demand:supply ratio. Reperfusion was unsuccessfully attempted after a 4 h occlusion period; reperfusion after a shorter period (30 min) resulted in ventricular ectopic activity but no fibrillation...|$|E
40|$|Beta-adrenoceptors are {{predominantly}} {{located in the}} cerebral cortex, nucleus accumbens and striatum. At lower densities, they are also present in amygdala, hippocampus and cerebellum. Beta- 2 sites regulate glial proliferation during ontogenic development, after trauma and in neurodegenerative diseases. The densities of beta- 1 adrenoceptors are changed by stress, in several mood disorders (depression, excessive hostility, schizophrenia) and during treatment of patients with antidepressants. A technique for beta-adrenoceptor imaging in the human brain is not yet available. Although 24 (ant) agonists have been labeled with either 11 C or 18 F {{and some of these}} are successful myocardial imaging agents, only two (S- 1 ’- 18 F-fluorocarazolol and S- 1 ’- 18 F-fluoroethylcarazolol) could actually visualize ß-adrenoceptors within the central nervous system. Unfortunately, these radiopharmaceuticals showed a positive Ames test. They may be mutagenic and cannot be employed for human studies. Screening of more than 150 beta-blockers described in the literature yields only two compounds (<b>exaprolol</b> and L 643, 717) which can still be radiolabeled and evaluated for ß-adenoceptor imaging. However, other imaging techniques could be examined. Cerebral ß-adrenoceptors might be labeled after temporary opening of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and simultaneous administration of a hydrophilic ligand such as S- 11 C-CGP 12388. Another approach to target ß-adrenoceptor ligands to the CNS is esterification of a myocardial imaging agent (such as 11 C-CGP 12177), resulting in a lipophilic prodrug which can cross the BBB and is split by tissue esterases. BBB opening is not feasible in healthy subjects, but the prodrug approach may be successful and deserves to be explored...|$|E
