Assembly of the toys requires no additional tools, as the pieces will simply lock ("snap") together. Assembly rarely takes more than a few simple steps. Most toys can be disassembled and reassembled freely, while a few cannot be disassembled without causing permanent damage. Over the years, Ferrero have also created a variety of no-assembly toys, whether more complex toys that can be used immediately or simple character statuettes made of a single, pre-painted piece of hard plastic.|$|E

40|$|The {{choice of}} power {{conversion}} technology {{is critical in}} directing {{the design of a}} space vehicle for the future NASA mission to Mars. One candidate design consists of a <b>foil</b> <b>bearing</b> supported turbo alternator driven by a helium-xenon gas mixture heated by a nuclear reactor. The system is a closed-loop, meaning there is a constant volume of process fluid that is sealed from the environment. Therefore, foil bearings are proposed due to their ability to use the process gas as a lubricant. As such, the rotor dynamics of a <b>foil</b> <b>bearing</b> supported rotor {{is an important factor in}} the eventual design. The current work describes a rotor dynamic analysis to assess the viability of such a system. A brief technology background, assumptions, analyses, and conclusions are discussed in this report.

40|$|Foil {{bearings}} {{are widely}} used for oil-free micro turbomachinery. One of the critical technical issues related to reliability of the foil bearings is a coating wear on the top foil and rotor during start/stops. Bearing cooling is also mandatory for certain applications because the foil bearings can generate significant amount of heat depending on operating conditions. Usually axial flow is used through {{the space between the}} top foil and bearing sleeve. In this thesis, a hybrid air <b>foil</b> <b>bearing</b> with external pressurization is introduced. The hybrid operation eliminates the coating wear during start-up/shut down, and also reduces drag torque during starts. Furthermore, this hybrid <b>foil</b> <b>bearing</b> does not need cooling system. An experimental test with a loaded bearing under hydrostatic mode demonstrates the high potential of hybrid air foil bearings. The load capacity of the hybrid <b>foil</b> <b>bearing</b> was measured at 20, 000 rpm, and compared with that of hydrodynamic <b>foil</b> <b>bearing.</b> The hybrid <b>foil</b> <b>bearing</b> has much higher load capacity than the hydrodynamic <b>foil</b> <b>bearing.</b> The starting torque was also measured and compared with hydrodynamic bearing. A simple analytical model to calculate top foil deflection under hydrostatic pressurization has been developed. Predictions via orbit simulations indicate the hybrid air foil bearings can have a much higher critical speed and onset speed of instability than the hydrodynamic counter part. Major benefits of the hybrid foil bearings also include very low starting torque, reduced wear of the top foil and rotor, and very effective cooling capability by the pressurized air itself. This new concept of hybrid air foil bearings are expected to be widely applied to the oil free turbomachinery industry, especially for heavily loaded and/or high temperature applications...|$|E
40|$|A sixteen-inch rotor, {{weighing}} approximately twenty-one pounds, {{was supported}} by air-lubricated foil bearings. In physical size and in mass distribution, the rotor closely matched that of an experimental Brayton cycle turboalternator unit.

A {{detailed description of the}} experimental apparatus and of the <b>foil</b> <b>bearing</b> design are given. The paper contains data on response of the rotor to rotating imbalance, symmetric and asymmetric, and to excitation by means of a vibrator (shake table). It is concluded that the gas-lubricated <b>foil</b> <b>bearing</b> suspension is free from fractional frequency whirl and suffers no loss of load capacity when excited at frequency equal to half the rotational speed. In contrast to rigid gas bearings, the <b>foil</b> <b>bearing</b> imposes no stringent requirements with respect to dimensional tolerances, cleanliness, or limitations of journal motion within the narrow confines of bearing clearance...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{developments}} in gas <b>foil</b> <b>bearing</b> technology {{have led to}} numerous advanced high-speed rotating system concepts, {{many of which have}} become either commercial products or experimental test articles. Examples include Oil-Free microturbines, motors, generators and turbochargers. The driving forces for integrating gas foil bearings into these high-speed systems are the benefits promised by removing the oil lubrication system. Elimination of the oil system leads to reduced emissions, increased reliability, and decreased maintenance costs. Another benefit is reduced power plant weight. For rotorcraft applications, this would be a major advantage, as every pound removed from the propulsion system results in a payload benefit. Implementing foil gas bearings throughout a rotorcraft gas turbine engine is an important long-term goal that requires overcoming numerous technological hurdles. Adequate thrust bearing load capacity and potentially large gearbox applied radial loads are among them. However, by replacing the turbine end, or hot section, rolling element bearing with a gas <b>foil</b> <b>bearing</b> many of the above benefits can be realized. To this end, engine manufacturers are beginning to explore the possibilities of hot section gas foil bearings in propulsion engines. This paper presents a logical follow-on activity by analyzing a conceptual rotorcraft engine to determine the feasibility of a <b>foil</b> <b>bearing</b> supported core. Using a combination of rotordynamic analyses and a load capacity model, it is shown to be reasonable to consider a gas <b>foil</b> <b>bearing</b> core section...|$|E

40|$|<b>Foil</b> <b>bearings</b> are {{self-acting}} hydrodynamics devices used {{to support}} high speed rotating machinery. The advantages that they offer to process fluid lubricated machines include: high rotational speed capability, no auxiliary lubrication system, non-contacting high speed operation, and improved damping as compared to rigid hydrodynamic bearings. NASA has had a sporadic research program in this technology for almost 6 decades. Advances in the technology and understanding of <b>foil</b> journal <b>bearings</b> have enabled several new commercial products in recent years. These products include oil-free turbochargers for both heavy trucks and automobiles, high speed electric motors, microturbines for distributed power generation, and turbojet engines. However, the <b>foil</b> thrust <b>bearing</b> has not received a complimentary level of research and therefore has become the weak link of oil-free turbomachinery. In an effort to both provide machine designers with basic performance parameters and to elucidate the underlying physics of <b>foil</b> thrust <b>bearings,</b> NASA Glenn Research Center has completed an effort to experimentally measure the performance of simple gas <b>foil</b> thrust <b>bearing</b> in air. The database includes simple bump <b>foil</b> supported thrust <b>bearings</b> with full geometry and manufacturing techniques available to the user.

An approach utilizing a well known micro-fabrication technique called LIGA (German acronym meaning Lithography, Electroplating, and Molding) is suggested as an alternative method. X-ray LIGA and UV-LIGA were explored and elastic foundations 200 ?m and 1 mm in depth were made for an impulse turbine test setup.

40|$|Over {{the past}} several years the term oil-free {{turbomachinery}} has been used to describe a rotor support system for high speed turbomachinery that does not require oil for lubrication, damping, or cooling. The foundation technology for oil-free turbomachinery is the compliant <b>foil</b> <b>bearing.</b> This technology can replace the conventional rolling element bearings found in current engines. Two major benefits are realized with this technology. The primary benefit is the elimination of the oil lubrication system, accessory gearbox, tower shaft, and one turbine frame. These components account for 8 to 13 percent of the turbofan engine weight. The second benefit that compliant foil bearings offer to turbofan engines is the capability to operate at higher rotational speeds and shaft diameters. While traditional rolling element bearings have diminished life, reliability, and load capacity with increasing speeds, the <b>foil</b> <b>bearing</b> has a load capacity proportional to speed. The traditional applications for foil bearings have been in small, lightweight machines. However, recent advancements in the design and manufacturing of foil bearings have increased their potential size. An analysis, grounded in experimentally proven operation, is performed to assess the scalability of the modern <b>foil</b> <b>bearing.</b> This analysis was coupled to the requirements of civilian turbofan engines. The application of the <b>foil</b> <b>bearing</b> to larger, high bypass ratio engines nominally at the 120 kN (approx. 25000 lb) thrust class has been examined.

This dearth of data at alternate pressures has motivated the current test program. Two facilities {{were used in the}} test program, the ambient pressure rig and the high pressure rig. The test program utilized a 35 mm diameter by 27 mm long foil journal bearing having an uncoated Inconel X- 750 top foil running against a shaft with a PS 304 coated journal. Load capacity tests were conducted at 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, and 21 krpm at temperatures from 25 to 500 C and at pressures from 0. 1 to 2. 5 atmospheres. Results show an increase in load capacity with increased ambient pressure and a reduction in load capacity with increased ambient temperature. Below one-half atmosphere of ambient pressure a dramatic loss of load capacity is experienced. Additional lightly loaded <b>foil</b> <b>bearing</b> performance in nitrogen at 25 C and up to 48 atmospheres of ambient pressure has also been reported.

50|$|<b>Foil</b> <b>bearings,</b> {{also known}} as foil-air bearings, are a type of air bearing. A shaft is {{supported}} by a compliant, spring-loaded foil journal lining. Once the shaft is spinning fast enough, the working fluid (usually air) pushes the foil away from the shaft so that there is no contact. The shaft and foil are separated by the air's high pressure which is generated by the rotation which pulls gas into the bearing via viscosity effects. A high speed of the shaft with respect to the foil is required to initiate the air gap, and once this has been achieved, no wear occurs. Unlike aerostatic or hydrostatic <b>bearings,</b> <b>foil</b> <b>bearings</b> require no external pressurisation system for the working fluid, so the hydrodynamic bearing is self-starting.|$|R
