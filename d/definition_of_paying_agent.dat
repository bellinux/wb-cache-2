40|$|The {{contracts}} {{we consider}} {{in this paper}} must solve three problems: moral hazard, insurance and discrimination. The moral hazard problem is that of providing the agents with incentives to perform {{in a way that}} maximizes the profit to the principal, when the agent's actions are unobservable. The insurance problem is that of minimizing the cost of risk through risk minimization and risk sharing. The issue of discrimination is that <b>of</b> <b>paying</b> <b>agents</b> with different skills sufficiently to participate, without overcompensating other agents. We show how the principal may benefit from a strategic division of the agents into different tournaments or groups. The optimal number of groups from the principal's point of view is determined through a trade-off between moral hazard, insurance and discrimination issues. Agribusiness,...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To compare pay gap {{estimates}} across 3 different {{national survey}} data sets {{for people with}} disabilities relative to those without disabilities when pay is measured as wage and salary alone versus a (total compensation) definition that includes an estimate of the value of benefits. Method: Estimates of the cost to the employers of employee benefits at the occupational level from an employer survey data set are matched to individual-level data in each of the 3 data sets. Multiple regression techniques are applied to estimate wage and salary and total compensation gaps between full-time men with and without disabilities. Results: For full-time working men with disabilities (relative to those without disabilities), there is a consistently larger percentage wage and salary gap than percentage total compensation gap and breadth <b>of</b> the <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>pay</b> affects the size <b>of</b> any estimated <b>pay</b> gap. In addition, there are differences in the estimated pay gaps depending on data source and disability measure. Conclusions: Results obtained from a single data set or <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> key variables may not be broadly generalizable. Studies containing such limitations should be interpreted cautiously. Our research further suggests employers looking to hire persons with disabilities or those offering employment placement services should put substantial weight on the non-base <b>pay</b> component <b>of</b> the total compensation package...|$|R

The gender pay gap as a systematic underpayment of women is measured using adjusted and unadjusted data. The thesis concerns with primary causes <b>of</b> the gender <b>pay</b> gap, such as the horizontal and vertical segregation, differences in human capital, or discrimination. It deals with the gender pay gap {{at the level of the}} European Union and at the level of the individual Members States.

40|$|M. Com. (Business Management) South-Africa's {{market share}} in gold {{produced}} dropped from 80 percent in 1980 to about 34 percent currently. This is due to entrance of cheaper producers of gold on the world market. The USA is our main competitor with a market share of about 17 percent. The difference is that South-Africa's remaining reserves is deep below surface and the USA are using open pit techniques to mine cheaply. In order for South-Africa to stay competitive and win back the lost market share {{it will be necessary}} to utilise the current available ore resources to it's full potential. This will also create new jobs in a South-Africa that needs it desperately. The calculation <b>of</b> the <b>pay</b> limit is investigated and found to be adequate. The different types <b>of</b> <b>pay</b> limits and their usage was explained. It was found that the current method, <b>of</b> using the <b>pay</b> limit directly as a cutoff limit, was incorrect. The use <b>of</b> a proposed <b>pay</b> limit was suggested. The <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> the proposed <b>pay</b> limit is slightly different than the current pay limit changed in order to clarify the correct use <b>of</b> the <b>pay</b> limit. The inadequacies <b>of</b> the <b>pay</b> limit was recognised and explained. A new term in gold mining was formulated namely the optimal limit. The purpose of this cutoff limit is to determine the cutoff value at which the resultant grade will be such that the mine's profit will be maximised over the long term. The combined usage <b>of</b> the proposed <b>pay</b> limit and the optimal limit in order to manage the ore resource, was described.

Although the results deviated {{from the traditional}} utility maximization theory {{and could not be}} explained by the payoff variability effect, they could be well captured in a cumulative prospect theory (CPT) framework. After considering the imperfect memory effect, we found that the prediction ability of the cumulative prospect theory learning (CPTL) model could be significantly improved. The experimental results were also compared with the CPTL model and the reinforcement learning (REL) model. This study empirically showed the potential of alternative theories to better capture travelers’ day-to-day mode choice behavior under uncertainty.

30|$|Second, at an {{aggregate}} level, traditional banks store transaction histories in a centralized fashion. Users only get to view their personal bank statements and must trust that their information is protected from both cyberattacks and employee misconduct. Traditionally, banks employ bank clerks to process payments. Human agents {{are prone to}} agency problems {{which can lead to}} misconduct such as theft. The cost <b>of</b> <b>paying</b> the human <b>agents</b> is also not trivial. With Bitcoin, all transactions are recorded publicly and electronically onto the immutable “blockchain” stored in a distributed fashion across thousands of network nodes—thereby making records easier to maintain and cyberattacks unlikely to succeed (because the information on transactions in this case is not held in one central location). The blockchain technology provides the multi-site copies of “ledgers”—which are really aggregations of past transactions (e.g., like a bank account statement). It also provides encryption to validate transactions as valid or invalid (e.g., like personal security device we currently use for online banking, which generate a unique transaction specific signature based on a personal key).|$|R

Intuitively, the variance <b>of</b> the <b>agent's</b> <b>pay</b> conditional on a high effort should be as low as possible, while it should {{be as high as}} possible conditional on a low effort. From an ex ante perspective, which is relevant for effort inducement, this maximizes the rewards associated to high effort, and the punishments associated to low effort. These results call into question the widespread use of stock-options and contracts with rewards-like features to provide incentives to risk averse executives. ...|$|R

We study a service under which each mobile client receives requested video streams at a variable Quality of Experi- ence (QoE) level, {{based on its}} experienced communication quality condition. We employ a proxy-video manager at the base station node. The manager classifies users into two groups, based on their reported experienced CQIs (Channel Quality Indicators). The manager intercepts a client’s video stream request destined to the HTTP server, determines its group classification, and proceeds to transmit a properly encoded version of the requested stream. To effectively regulate inter-cell signal interference, we examine {{a number of different}} spectral reuse and fractional frequency reuse scheduling schemes. We calculate, for each scheduling and user group classification scheme, the average bandwidth per stream that is required to provide user groups with their targeted QoE levels.

Recent studies generally use a single measure of mix (e. g., bonus/base, or stock options/total, or benefits/base).

Therefore, we derived pay mix measures from the theories commonly used in compensation research. We classified the <b>pay</b> mix policies <b>of</b> 478 firms using cluster-analytic techniques. We found that the classification of organizations based on their pay mix depends on the measures used.
