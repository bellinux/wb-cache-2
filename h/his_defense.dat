5|$|The ACLU {{offices on}} the West Coast {{had been more}} {{directly}} involved in addressing the tide of anti-Japanese prejudice from the start, as they were geographically closer to the issue, and were already working on cases challenging the exclusion by this time. The Seattle office, assisting in Gordon Hirabayashi's lawsuit, created an unaffiliated committee to continue the work the ACLU had started, while in Los Angeles, attorney A.L. Wirin continued to represent Ernest Kinzo Wakayama but without addressing the case's constitutional questions. (Wirin would lose private clients because of <b>his</b> <b>defense</b> of Wakayama and other Japanese Americans.) However, the San Francisco branch, led by Ernest Besig, refused to discontinue its support for Fred Korematsu, whose case had been taken on prior to the June 22 directive, and attorney Wayne Collins, with Besig's full support, centered <b>his</b> <b>defense</b> on the illegality of Korematsu's exclusion.|$|E

5|$|When Dan White {{was found}} guilty of {{involuntary}} manslaughter, his successful diminished capacity defense enraged the gay community.

5|$|After 25 {{years as}} a civilian, he rejoined the Army {{to fight in the}} American Civil War. Despite his age, he quickly rose up the ranks and was {{appointed}} a brigadier general in early 1862. During the war, he took part in the Northern Virginia Campaign, the Battle of Antietam, and the Battle of Chancellorsville. His most notable contribution during the war was <b>his</b> <b>defense</b> of the Union right flank at Culp's Hill during the Battle of Gettysburg. He returned to engineering work after the war until his death in 1899.|$|E

5|$|By {{the summer}} after his 201011 {{freshman}} season, he was described as the best point guard {{from the state of}} Minnesota since Khalid El-Amin. Another Minnesotan who is a measuring stick for Jones is Sam Jacobson. According to Bleacher Report's Kerry Miller, when he plays for Duke, Jones is likely to finish among the top 5 in the nation in assists per game but may need to work on <b>his</b> <b>defense.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1990, Will Robinson and Ken Swartz {{produced}} the documentary Port Chicago MutinyA National Tragedy, about the explosion and trial. They interviewed mutiny convict Joe Small, <b>his</b> <b>defense</b> lawyer Gerald Veltmann, {{as well as}} Percy Robinson, a seaman who returned to loading ammunition after the first work-stoppage, and Robert Routh, Jr., a seaman who was blinded in the blast.

5|$|In 2007, U.S. {{federal judge}} Tena Campbell {{rejected}} Gardner's appeal that his attorneys were inadequate {{because they were}} unable to prove that he did not mean to kill his victim.

Gardner attempted to give up the process at least three times, but his attorneys convinced him to continue appealing each time. State court Judge Robin Reese signed an execution warrant on April 23 ordering the state to carry out the death sentence.|$|E

5|$|On 26 July 2007, {{after an}} even deadlier crash in Brazil (TAM Airlines Flight 3054 on 17 July 2007) claimed {{the lives of}} 199 people, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva fired <b>his</b> <b>defense</b> minister, Waldir Pires, who had been in charge of the country's {{aviation}} infrastructure and safety since March 2006, and was widely criticized for their failures. On the same day, Lula appointed former Supreme Court president Nelson Jobim to replace Pires, and vowed to improve Brazil's air traffic control system.|$|E
5|$|On January 9, 2003, Massino {{was arrested}} and indicted, {{alongside}} Vitale, Frank Lino and capo Daniel Mongelli, in a comprehensive racketeering indictment.

5|$|Recently, Calhoun's {{reputation}} {{has suffered}} particularly due to <b>his</b> <b>defense</b> of slavery. The racially motivated Charleston church shooting in South Carolina in June 2015 reinvigorated demands {{for the removal}} of monuments dedicated to prominent pro-slavery and Confederate States figures. That month, the monument to Calhoun in Charleston was found vandalized, with spray-painted denunciations of Calhoun as a racist and a defender of slavery.|$|E
5|$|Revere {{began the}} 2013 {{season as the}} Phillies; leadoff hitter before being moved down in the lineup {{following}} an injury.

5|$|That same year, in {{the general}} {{elections}} held in November, Romero Barceló lost his gubernatorial seat against former governor and opposing party rival Rafael Hernández Colón (PPD). It is widely accepted that Romero Barceló lost the elections because of this case, since his public opinion rating had deteriorated substantially during late 1984 as the investigations progressed, and since his political rivals used <b>his</b> <b>defense</b> of the officers {{as an indication of}} a possible conspiracy.|$|E
5|$|Three years later, Stone {{followed}} Kelley’s example. In 1843, a deacon {{was expelled}} from Stone's church for his antislavery activities, which included supporting Kelley by hosting her at his home and driving her to lectures that she gave in the vicinity. When the first vote for expulsion was taken, Stone raised her hand in <b>his</b> <b>defense.</b> The minister discounted her vote, saying that, though {{she was a member}} of the church, she was not a voting member. Like Kelley, she stubbornly raised her hand for each of the remaining five votes.|$|E
