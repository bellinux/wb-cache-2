30|$|In this framework, {{the aim of}} {{our study}} is to {{investigate}} whether the granulation of micronized RP along with (HA–Trp) complex is able to increase the short-term fertilizer action of RP by improving P solubilization rates in the rhizosphere. Our working hypothesis was that the potential increase in soil microbial activity, related enzyme activities, and local pH acidification in the physical rhizospheric environment surrounding RP granule triggered by HA–Trp might increase the rate of P mobilization from water-insoluble P in RP to the soil solution, thus enhancing short-term RP fertilizer efficiency. With this aim, we have investigated {{the effect of a}} <b>granulated</b> <b>fertilizer</b> made from RP and coated with (HA–Trp) (RP/(HA–Trp)) and corresponding control treatments including RP coated with Trp alone (RP/Trp), RP, and SSP, on the early yield and P leaf concentration (1 – 3  months) of ray grass (Lolium perenne) cultivated in pots containing an acidic soil. These studies were complemented by soil incubation experiments carried out in order to evaluate the differential action of all treatments on soil microbial activity and potentially plant-available P.|$|E

The research {{was carried out in}} Botucatu, State of São Paulo, Brazil. The sowing of the beans (06 / 03 / 2003) was made with the supply of 230 kg ha(- 1) of NPK (4 - 30 - 10) <b>granulated</b> <b>fertilizer</b> at planting. The experiment was a complete randomized block, with four replications and a 5 x 2 factorial arrangement, involving five N rates (25; 50; 75 and 125 kg ha(- 1)), applied 20 days after emergency (DAE), with or without 80 g ha(- 1) of Mo, applied on leaves at 25 DAE. The Mo absence by leaf spray promoted the nitrate accumulation in the leaves in treatments with higher rates of N. The weight of 100 grains increased with the Mo by leaf spray, reducing the need for N to get the best results. The molybdenum fertilization increased bean yield regardless of N rate applied to the beans...|$|E

An economically viable {{solution to the}} disposal of waste from chicken houses is treatment to produce a natural, <b>granulated</b> <b>fertilizer</b> that can be commercially marketed for garden and commercial use. Odor of the final product is important in consumer acceptance, and an earthy odor is desirable. By understanding and manipulating the microbial processes occurring during this process, {{it may be possible}} to modify the odors produced. Geosmin and related volatiles produced by soil actinomycetes are responsible for earthy odors, and actinomycetes are likely to be present in the composting manure. Bacterial communities at each stage of the process were analyzed by culturing studies and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). The processing steps changed the culturable bacterial community, but the total community was shown by DGGE to be stable throughout the process. A local agricultural soil was analyzed in parallel as a potential source of geosmin-producing actinomycetes. This agricultural soil had higher microbial diversity than the compost at both the culturable and the molecular levels. Actinomycete bacteria were isolated and analyzed by AromaTrax, a gas chromatography-olfactometry system. This system enables the odor production of individual isolates to be monitored, allowing for rational selection of strains for augmentation experiments to improve the odor of the final fertilizer product...|$|E

40|$|The {{application}} of nitrogen (N) fertilizers is still insufficient across cropping systems in Africa {{south of the}} Sahara, while plant uptake of nitrogen is often inefficient and wasteful even when farmers apply fertilizers. This leaves sizable room for improving the productivity of crops and managing nutrient cycles. Fertilizer deep placement is a technology designed to enhance the efficiency of nutrient delivery to crops by placing <b>granulated</b> <b>fertilizer</b> directly in the root zone. Deep placement maximizes nutrient uptake by crops while using less fertilizer than surface broadcasting, and minimizes N losses due to runoff and ammonia volatilization. Urea deep placement (UDP) technology has been widely adopted in lowland paddy rice production systems in South Asia, especially in Bangladesh. There is a growing interest to scale up UDP adoption in West African countries, such as Ghana and Senegal, but {{a limited number of}} studies have been published from the region to support developing strategies.

Plots were established in Žabčice (South Moravia, Czech Republic) in 2005 – 2007. We used the following fertilization treatments: Agormin T, Agro, Dvorecký agroferm, cattle farmyard manure and solo mineral fertilizers, compared to an unfertilized control. All plots, except the control, were fertilized to achieve the same level of nutrients, as determined by the soil analyses and the chosen target yield. We assessed the following traits at harvest: weight of above-ground mass, marketable yield, head weight and head diameter. Levels of ascorbic acid, nitrates, dry matter and mineral ions (potassium, sodium, calcium and magnesium) were measured in the heads. Agormin T significantly increased the weight of above-ground mass and total marketable yield. All organic fertilizers significantly increased head weight and head diameter in comparison to both the unfertilized control and mineral fertilizers. Ascorbic acid levels were not significantly affected by the fertilizers. The highest value of ascorbic acid was observed for farmyard manure, the lowest for Dvorecký agroferm. Dried fertilizers had no positive effect on ascorbic acid levels and total solids, as compared to farmyard manure. In contrast, Agormin T resulted in significantly lower levels of dry matter. Solo mineral fertilization resulted in the highest levels of nitrates in cauliflower heads. Fertilization with Agro and farmyard manure significantly increased the levels of nitrates in heads, as compared to the control, but all values were under the hygienic limit. The different fertilizer treatments did not have any significant effects on the levels of mineral cations.
