5|$|By January 24, {{the number}} {{had risen to}} more than 30,600 per day—three {{times as many as}} {{originally}} estimated. Angry commuters using the Anacostia, Navy Yard, and Waterfront stations peppered the transit agency with complaints. WMATA claimed that a number of factors contributed to the ridership crunch: the system was experiencing record ridership; two-year-old ridership projections were used; the five stations were opened two months ahead of schedule; the five new stations were opened two months before new rail cars were ready for service; and WMATA offered <b>free</b> <b>parking</b> at the Green Line stations, which drew 12,000 rather than 4,000 riders to the line.|$|E

5|$|The central {{business}} district, {{also known}} as the Village Center, is located on Briarcliff Manor's main street on Pleasantville Road and continues on North State Road. The area has numerous businesses lining Pleasantville Road, a large expansion from the three stores that existed there in 1906. The business district is home to the village hall and a pocket park, and has brick sidewalks, period street lighting, and <b>free</b> <b>parking.</b> Farther south along the road is the Walter W. Law Memorial Park, and further east along the road are the three schools of the Briarcliff Manor Union Free School District. The Village Center contains a number of pre-Revolutionary War houses, including the Whitson House, built during the 1770s and the former home of Richard Whitson (one of the Whitson brothers, after whom Whitson's Corners was named); Buckhout House, also dating to the 1770s and named for the family who lived there for over a century and the oldest, Century Homestead, dating to about 1767 and first owned by Reuben Whitson. The Washburn House, another pre-Revolutionary house, was sold by the New York State Commission on Forfeiture to Joseph Washburn in 1775.|$|E

40|$|Municipalities and {{employers}} in the U. S. {{attempt to reduce}} commuting by automo-bile through commuter benefits for riding public transportation, walking, or cycling. Many employers provide a combination of benefits, often including <b>free</b> car <b>parking</b> alongside benefits for public transportation, walking, and cycling. This study evalu-ates the relationship between commuter benefits and mode choice for the commute to work using revealed preference data on 4, 630 regular commuters, including infor-mation about <b>free</b> car <b>parking,</b> public transportation benefits, showers/lockers, and bike parking {{at work in the}} Washington, DC region. Multinomial logistic regression results show that <b>free</b> car <b>parking</b> at work is related to more driving. Commuters offered either public transportation benefits, showers/lockers, or bike <b>parking,</b> but no <b>free</b> car <b>parking,</b> are more likely to either ride public transportation, walk, or cycle to work. The joint provision of benefits for public transportation, walking, and cycling is related to an increased likelihood to commute by all three of these modes and a decreased likelihood of driving. However, the inclusion of <b>free</b> car <b>parking</b> in benefit packages alongside benefits for public transportation, walking, and cycling, seems t...|$|R

The game can be used as an alternative to rolling doubles to get out of jail. In <b>Free</b> <b>Parking,</b> players attempt to balance taxis on a wobbly board. The <b>Free</b> <b>Parking</b> add-on can also be used with the Monopoly game. When a player lands on the <b>Free</b> <b>Parking,</b> the player can take the Taxi Challenge, and if successful, can move to any space on the board.|$|E
25|$|Parking fees {{had been}} {{listed as a}} major {{deterrent}} to downtown shopping on the Eugene Mall. In 1973 the city created a <b>free</b> <b>parking</b> zone around the mall that included 2200 spaces with no time limits. Effects on retail sales from the <b>free</b> <b>parking</b> zone may have been marginal, and the plan further limited city revenue. Bates found that concerns over parking at pedestrian malls are much {{more important in the}} United States than in Europe.|$|E

25|$|Discussions {{about the}} need for a {{downtown}} mall intensified when Valley River Center (VRC) opened in 1969.

25|$|<b>Free</b> <b>parking</b> at {{businesses}} {{is often}} strictly enforced to patrons, with clearly placed tow warning signs for abusing {{the space to}} go to other places or for parking for an excessive length of time, especially in highly trafficked areas such as South Beach. Many businesses have no <b>free</b> <b>parking</b> available, or do for only limited amounts of time. Even suburban plazas and big box stores often have parking security to ensure both patron safety and designated use of parking. In many suburban residential areas, {{people do not have}} their own private garages as properties are small due to high land values. A parking pass even for residents of a high rise residential building often costs an additional fee over the rent or association dues.|$|E
