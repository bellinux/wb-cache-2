5|$|The Scranton branch faces {{off against}} the {{corporate}} branch, commenting {{that they deserve}} to lose for deciding to close down Buffalo. The game is close, and Pam ends up injuring her ankle, although she wants to continue. Seeing an opportunity to remove Scranton's best player from the game, Charles insists that Pam take {{a seat on the}} grounds of her injury being a company liability. Determined to beat corporate, Jim takes Pam to a local hospital to get an X-ray while Dwight stalls the game to give them time to get back. When the doctor calls Jim into the room <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>update,</b> the doctor informs Jim and Pam of some news that causes them to be ecstatic, presumably that Pam is pregnant. Jim then calls Dwight to send in the substitute players.|$|E

25|$|Most {{meteorological}} data was acquired {{all at once}} early in the morning, {{and the rest of}} day's chasing was based on analysis and forecast gleaned from this; as well as on visual clues that presented themselves in the field throughout the day. Plotted weather maps were often analyzed by hand for manual diagnosis of meteorological patterns. Occasionally chasers would make stops at rural airstrips or NWS offices <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>update</b> on weather conditions. NOAA Weather Radio (NWR) could provide information in the vehicle, without stopping, such as weather watches and warnings, surface weather conditions, convective outlooks, and NWS radar summaries. Nowadays, storm chasers may use high-speed Internet access available in any library, even in small towns in the US. This data is available throughout the day, but one must find and stop at a location offering Internet access.|$|E
25|$|Saturday, {{on the eve}} of the game, NFL {{commissioner}} Pete Rozelle called Jim Kensil and Don Weiss, {{the executive}} directors of the NFL, <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>update</b> on the weather conditions. It is suspected that they informed him that Sunday's game time temperature of about 5° was playable. Rozelle, who in June 1966 had seen to it that the AFL-NFL Championship game would always be in a warm weather city, inquired if the game could be postponed until Monday. Predictions held Monday would be even colder than Sunday and the game was not postponed. Little did they know that the cold front would be far colder and would arrive much sooner than expected. The Packers, who had for years eschewed late-season home games because of the cold winters, would play host to the Cowboys in a game that would mark the coldest New Year's Eve in the history of Green Bay and the coldest title game in the history of the NFL, a record that still stands.|$|E

500|$|On May 1 at 1:22p.m., Panetta, {{acting on}} the president's orders, {{directed}} McRaven {{to move forward with}} the operation. Shortly after 3p.m., the president joined national security officials in the Situation Room to monitor the raid. They watched night-vision images taken from a Sentinel drone while Panetta, appearing {{in a corner of the}} screen from CIA headquarters, narrated what was happening. Video links with Panetta at CIA headquarters and McRaven in Afghanistan were set up in the Situation Room. In an adjoining office was the live drone feed presented on a laptop computer operated by Brigadier General Marshall Webb, assistant commander of JSOC. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was one of those in the Situation Room, and described it like this: [...] "Contrary to some news reports and what you see in the movies, we had no means to see what was happening inside the building itself. All we could do was wait <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>update</b> from the team on the ground. I looked at the President. He was calm. Rarely have I been prouder to serve by his side as I was that day."

2500|$|As {{the power}} was {{increased}} and targets of increasing sophistication were used, another problem appeared that was causing an asymmetric implosion.

This was solved by re-designing the hohlraum with two layers of glass on either end, in effect creating a storm window. Steven Koonin, DOE undersecretary for science, visited the lab <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>update</b> on the NIC on 23 April, the day after the window problem was announced as solved.

A message was sent to X Beach asking <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>update,</b> but no reply was received. At [...] at noon, firing was heard from X Beach but no instructions arrived from 29th Division Headquarters, so Matthews ordered the position to be consolidated. At [...] with {{no sign of a}}n advance from the cape Matthews withdrew from the ravine and began to dig in again on the cliff top. Dead ground around the landing site forced the British to establish a lengthy perimeter, along which the 29th Division troops were placed in the centre and marines on the flanks. From the ships the retirement could not be seen and digging in on the new positions was slowed, because entangled roots lay under the surface and the heavy digging implements were still on the beach, which resulted in the entrenchments being little more than [...] deep by late afternoon.|$|E
2500|$|Historian Robert Quimby says, [...] "the British {{certainly}} did win a tactical victory, which {{enabled them to}} maintain their position." [...] However, Quimby goes on to say, [...] "It is not {{too much to say}} that it was the battle of December 23 that saved New Orleans. The British were disabused of their expectation of an easy conquest. The unexpected and severe attack made Keane even more cautious...he made no effort to advance on the twenty-fourth or twenty-fifth." [...] As a consequence, the Americans were given time to begin the transformation of the canal into a heavily fortified earthwork. On Christmas Day, General Edward Pakenham arrived on the battlefield and ordered a reconnaissance-in-force on December 28 against the American earthworks protecting the advance to New Orleans. That evening, General Pakenham, angry with the position in which the army had been placed, met with General Keane and Admiral Cochrane <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>update</b> on the situation. General Pakenham wanted to use Chef Menteur Road as the invasion route, but he was overruled by Admiral Cochrane, who insisted that his boats were providing everything that could be needed. Admiral Cochrane believed the veteran British soldiers would easily destroy Jackson's ramshackle army, and he allegedly said that if the army did not do it, his sailors would. Whatever Pakenham's thoughts on the matter, the meeting settled the method and place of the attack.|$|E
