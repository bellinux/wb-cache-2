30|$|The {{literature}} presents several quasi-analytical {{methods for}} analyzing heat transfer problems in <b>extended</b> <b>surfaces.</b> The different quasi-analytical methods, which used an iterative method {{such as the}} Newton–Raphson {{for the evaluation of}} an undetermined parameter, are applied mostly for nonlinear problems. On the other hand, the solution of linear problems is generally obtained as a particular case of nonlinear problems. The contribution of the present work is to present close-form series solution of the homogeneous <b>extended</b> <b>surface</b> heat diffusion equation using the differential transform method. This can be a useful strategy in developing an analytical solution when designing practical <b>extended</b> <b>surfaces</b> with suitable geometry for temperature response. The proposed differential transform solution uses a set of mathematical operations to transform the heat conduction equation together with the fin profile in order to yield a close-form series of homogeneous <b>extended</b> <b>surface</b> heat diffusion equation which avoid using an iterative method. The homogeneous <b>extended</b> <b>surfaces</b> in the forms of longitudinal fins of rectangular and triangular profiles and pins of cylindrical and conical profiles are attached to a primary surface at constant temperature heat losses by convection to the surrounding medium and where the heat loss from the tip of the <b>extended</b> <b>surfaces</b> is assumed to be negligible.

WhinRhizo® software {{was used to}} describe the following changes in the root system morphology for each plant: distribution and average root diameter, root surface and the number of tips. The stress at breakage and stiVness of the roots in tension were also determined. Evaluation of biochemical components of roots was achieved by direct Attenuated Total ReXectance (or reXection) (ATR) -Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) on root section. Inoculated roots exhibited signiWcantly larger numbers of tips and <b>extending</b> <b>surface</b> to rhizosphere when compared to controls. Measured mechanical parameters of inoculated roots showed a slight increase in rupture stress up to the largest diameter (1. 2 mm) when compared to controls. StiVness (Young's modulus) values were nearly constant for inoculated plants with higher values than for non-inoculated plants at day 26 and day 35. Using Principal Components Analysis of ATR-FTIR proWles, the polysaccharide enrichment of inoculated roots compared to controls was found at day 35.

These devices, which provide a considerable increase in the surface area for heat transfer between a heated source and a cooler ambient fluid, are most effective to enhance heat transfer between a surface and an adjacent fluid (Kraus et al. 2001). In designing <b>extended</b> <b>surfaces,</b> the first step consists of assuming that the heat transfer is governed by a one-dimensional homogeneous steady conduction along an <b>extended</b> <b>surface</b> and a uniform convection at the surface area (Arauzo et al. 2005; Kang 2009; Brestovic et al. 2015). Although an exact solution for this problem {{can be found in}} the literature, it may be either difficult or not possible to obtain when designing practical <b>extended</b> <b>surfaces</b> with profile matching suitable geometry for temperature response. Moreover, the exact solution of some problems requires difficult manipulation of special functions such as Bessel functions.|$|R
30|$|A {{differential}} transform {{method to}} analyze stationary heat conduction through homogeneous <b>extended</b> <b>surfaces</b> with negligible heat loss {{from the tip}} has been presented. The major conclusion of this work is that for stationary heat conduction through <b>extended</b> <b>surfaces,</b> the DTM solution can be obtained in a closed series solution which does not necessitate an iterative method such as the Newton–Raphson methods for {{the determination of the}} initial value of temperature transform function. The proposed method is shown to converge with a few Taylor series for both low and high values of the thermal length characteristic parameter. Application of the present DTM solution to longitudinal fins of rectangular and triangular profiles and pins of cylindrical and conical profiles show an excellent agreement with exact results. For all cases studied, the magnitude of temperature decreases with increasing thermal length characteristic parameter. This indicates that the loss of heat from <b>extended</b> <b>surfaces</b> is more significant for low convection coefficient of the cooling fluid than that for <b>extended</b> <b>surfaces</b> with high thickness and conduction coefficient.|$|R

40|$|The Uyuni-Kehnayani Fault Zone (UKFZ) {{is a major}} Altiplano-internal {{structure}} of the Altiplano located in the Departamento Lipez of Southern Bolivia, it strikes NNE. During Paleocene and Eocene times in an extensional regime, a thick sequence of red siltstones was deposited as basinfill over marine Cretaceous sediments. Later, the UKFZ became a contractional structure and more fine clastic material was syntectonically deposited. The fault zone {{is marked by a}} system of thrust faults and branch thrusts that are dipping more and more steeply to the west. The entire structure overthrusts a Paleozoic ridge east of the UKF sensu strictu. In this contribution, a method is proposed that allows to build a conceptual geological model from surface geology, as well as strike and dip of bedding planes measured in the field and in aerial photographs. Additionally, a satellite image interpretation was performed for identification of major thrust and fold structures. The difficulties in this task consist in <b>extending</b> <b>surface</b> data into the subsurface. The chosen method uses the Discrete Smoothing Interpolation Algorithm for constructing surface models with a Triangulated irregular Network (TIN) structure. Also, bedding and additional information such as sequence thicknesses can be incorporated in this model as constraints for DSI. The resulting geometrical model clearly shows the main structures of the UKFZ and their subsurface geometry. The nonfolded, flat lying Cenozoic formations east of the UKFZ form a distinct contrast to the upright to overturned orientation of the same formations west of the UKFZ. These overthrusted sediments form the infill of an inverse halfgraben basin combined with a large anticline west of the UKFZ. The base of cenozoic sediments is plunging slightly to the north, which is consistent with regional structures. Problems arose in areas at the borders of the geological surface model with edge effects and crosscutting of bedding surfaces. These could be attributed to hidden subsurface structures. Areas where consistency of geological concepts is not yet sufficient could clearly be identified. The clues to the location of outcrops of significant importance are crucial for a successful field investigation. The geological model obtained with this approach is consistent with the overall regional geology. Numerical analyses of the model show a value of finite shortening along the UKFZ that is matching the values of previous works. Our method produces a consistent geological model, which can be used as constraint for other geological methods, such as balancing cross-sections. Values of finite shortening as derived from the geological model are fitting the previously observed data from other sources. Validation of the model can be performed in combination with independent data sets like seismic profiles. In this context, there the question arises what is the accuracy of a geometrical model. The assessment of confidence parameters for topology and geometry is still an unresolved problem. The elaborated geometrical model can be a starting point for studies on this problem. Moreover, conceptual errors that are invisible in geological maps, even combined with sections, are much more easier to detect using the proposed method...|$|E

Based on this feature, an enhanced heat exchange system between sunlight, desert sand, and air in the spaces between sand particles could be built up automatically, which can increase capture of solar energy, leading to rapid heating of the sand particles, and then the heating of sand particles will dramatically heat the air between sand particles. The thermodynamics of deserts may thus have contributed to global warming, especially significant to future global warming if the current desertification continues to expand.

The current study introduces a novel manufacturing technique, Selective Laser Melting (SLM), and' demonstrates its ability to fabricate new designs of <b>extended</b> <b>surface</b> that have not previously been considered, primarily due to their geometric complexity. The SLM processing parameters for aluminium 6061, a new material to the technique, were developed to allow the fabrication ofparts that achieved a density of 90 % of the parent metal. Investigations on the SLM-fabricated aluminium 6061 revealed that its thermal conductivity was 75 W/mK, 48 % less than the thermal conductivity predicted by standard correlations. 65 % of the reduction in thermal conductivity was found to be caused by interparticle thermal resistances, the remainder a result ofporosities. The heat transfer and pressure loss performance of several types of heat sink were characterised by experimental investigations. The <b>extended</b> <b>surfaces</b> manufactured and tested included cylindrical arrays, for validation purposes, elliptical, offset strip and diamond arrays, and various types of lattice. In the acceptable flow rate and pressure drop range, a tightly packed diamond array was found to offer the best performance with a 62 % improvement in heat transfer over a typical cylindrical pin arrangement and only 60 % ofthe pressure loss. Computational Fluids Dynamic (CFD) studies of the flow in three pin arrangements were conducted to aid visualisation of the fluid flow and to assess the predictive capabilities of Fluent, a commercial CFD code. The CFD pressure loss predictions were within 8 % ofthe experimental results and the heat transfer results were found to be qualitatively meaningful. Results from the experimental and CFD studies indicate that laminar flow in streamlined fm arrays with tight pin spacings offers improved heat transfer performance benefits over turbulent flow in cylindrical arrays at a similar flow rate and pressure drop thereby offering the required improvement in performance for high-power electronic components.

Performances are compared, {{for a wide range}} of geometric variables, bed configurations and fluidized materials, with plain and oval tubes operating under similar experimental conditions. A statistical analysis of all results, using a regression technique, has shown the relative importance of each significant variable. The bed to surface heat transfer coefficients are higher than those reported in earlier published work using finned tubes in much deeper beds and the heat transfer to the whole of the <b>extended</b> <b>surface</b> is at least as good as that previously reported for un-finned tubes. The improved performance is attributed partly to the absence of large bubbles in shallow beds and it is suggested that the improved circulation of the solids when constrained in the narrow passages between adjacent fins may be a contributory factor. Flow visualisation studies between a perspex <b>extended</b> <b>surface</b> and a fluidized bed using air at ambient temperatures, have demonstrated the effect of too small a fin spacing.

The second case examines the effect of the radiation heat transfer arising from an operating Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) to the metal hydride tank as a possible heat source for the dehydrogenation procedure. The third scenario takes into account the usage of internal heating tubes within the tank and the case of using 8 - 12 - 16 - 20 and 24 co-central tubes.
