On the Greek left, the Persian admiral Ariabignes (a brother of Xerxes) was killed early in the battle; left disorganised and leaderless, the Phoenician squadrons appear to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>pushed</b> back against the coast, many vessels running aground.

5|$|Historically, the San Juan {{watershed}} supported up to 12 invertebrate species, 5 fish species, 12 amphibian species, 35 reptile species, 143 bird species, and 42 mammal species, which {{benefited from}} the diverse vegetation communities present. Some streams and ponds host federally listed endangered/threatened species such as tidewater goby, fairy shrimp, and California red-legged frog. Federally listed bird species include least Bell's vireo, California gnatcatcher, California least tern, and southwestern willow flycatcher. Other listed species include Pacific pocket mouse and Quino checkerspot butterfly. As urbanization continues to increase in the San Juan watershed, most sensitive species <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>pushed</b> back to the foothills, mountains, and agricultural/ranching areas of the watershed.|$|E

25|$|The {{environment}} of evolutionary adaptedness is {{significantly different from}} modern society. The ancestors of modern humans lived in smaller groups, had more cohesive cultures, and had more stable and rich contexts for identity and meaning.

Unfortunately, the few surviving hunter-gatherer societies are different from each other, and they <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>pushed</b> out of the best land and into harsh environments, {{so it is not}} clear how closely they reflect ancestral culture.|$|E
25|$|The fission of a {{heavy nucleus}} {{requires}} a total input energy of about 7 to 8 million electron volts (MeV) to initially overcome the nuclear force which holds the nucleus into a spherical or nearly spherical shape, and from there, deform it into a two-lobed ("peanut") shape in which the lobes are {{able to continue to}} separate from each other, pushed by their mutual positive charge, in the most common process of binary fission (two positively charged fission products + neutrons). Once the nuclear lobes <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>pushed</b> to a critical distance, beyond which the short range strong force can no longer hold them together, the process of their separation proceeds from the energy of the (longer range) electromagnetic repulsion between the fragments. The result is two fission fragments moving away from each other, at high energy.|$|E
25|$|The {{agreement}} {{to build the}} pipeline was signed ten days before the German parliamentary election. On 24 October 2005, {{a few weeks before}} Schröder had stepped down as Chancellor, the German government guaranteed to cover €1billion of the Nord Stream project cost, should Gazprom default on a loan. However, this guarantee expired at the end of 2006 without ever having been needed. Soon after leaving the post of Chancellor of Germany, Gerhard Schröder agreed to head the shareholders' committee of Nord Stream AG. This has been widely described by German and international media as a conflict of interest, the implication being that the pipeline project may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>pushed</b> through for personal gain rather than for improving gas supplies to Germany. Information about the German government's guarantee was requested by the European Commission. No formal charges have been filed against any party despite years of exhaustive investigations.|$|E

25|$|Nervous system repair: Upon {{injury to}} nerve cells within {{the central nervous}} system, astrocytes fill up the space to form a glial scar, and may {{contribute}} to neural repair. The role of astrocytes in CNS regeneration following injury is not well understood though. The glial scar has traditionally been described as an impermeable barrier to regeneration, thus implicating a negative role in axon regeneration. However, recently, it was found through genetic ablation studies that astrocytes are actually required for regeneration to occur. Even more exciting, these authors found that the astrocyte scar is actually essential for stimulated axons (that axons that have been coaxed to grow via neurotrophic supplementation) to extend through the injured spinal cord. Interestingly, astrocytes that <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>pushed</b> into a reactive phenotype (termed astrogliosis, defined by upregulation of GFAP expression, a definition still under debate) may actually be toxic to neurons, releasing signals that can kill neurons. Much work, however, remains to elucidate their role in nervous system injury.|$|E
25|$|Some Upper Paleolithic {{societies}} in resource-rich environments (such as {{societies in}} Sungir, {{in what is}} now Russia) may have had more complex and hierarchical organization (such as tribes with a pronounced hierarchy and a somewhat formal division of labor) and may have engaged in endemic warfare. Some argue that there was no formal leadership during the Middle and Upper Paleolithic. Like contemporary egalitarian hunter-gatherers such as the Mbuti pygmies, societies may have made decisions by communal consensus decision making rather than by appointing permanent rulers such as chiefs and monarchs. Nor was there a formal division of labor during the Paleolithic. Each member of the group was skilled at all tasks essential to survival, regardless of individual abilities. Theories to explain the apparent egalitarianism have arisen, notably the Marxist concept of primitive communism. Christopher Boehm (1999) has hypothesized that egalitarianism may have evolved in Paleolithic societies because of a need to distribute resources such as food and meat equally to avoid famine and ensure a stable food supply. Raymond C. Kelly speculates that the relative peacefulness of Middle and Upper Paleolithic societies resulted from a low population density, cooperative relationships between groups such as reciprocal exchange of commodities and collaboration on hunting expeditions, and because the invention of projectile weapons such as throwing spears provided less incentive for war, because they increased the damage done to the attacker and decreased the relative amount of territory attackers could gain. However, other sources claim that most Paleolithic groups may have been larger, more complex, sedentary and warlike than most contemporary hunter-gatherer societies, due to occupying more resource-abundant areas than most modern hunter-gatherers who <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>pushed</b> into more marginal habitats by agricultural societies.|$|E
