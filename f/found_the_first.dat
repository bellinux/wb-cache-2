5|$|A gull colony {{has been}} present since 1984, {{although}} gulls were seen briefly {{on the shores}} of the new island only weeks after it first appeared. The gull colony has been particularly important in developing the plant life on Surtsey, and the gulls have had much more of an impact on plant colonisation than other breeding species due to their abundance. An expedition in 2004 <b>found</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> evidence of nesting Atlantic puffins, which are extremely common {{in the rest of the}} archipelago.|$|E
5|$|Barnum Brown, {{assistant}} {{curator of}} the American Museum of Natural History, <b>found</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> partial skeleton of Tyrannosaurus rex in eastern Wyoming in 1900. H. F. Osborn originally named this skeleton Dynamosaurus imperiosus in a paper in 1905. Brown found another partial skeleton in the Hell Creek Formation in Montana in 1902. Osborn used this holotype to describe Tyrannosaurus rex in the same paper in which D. imperiosus was described. In 1906, Osborn recognized the two as synonyms, and acted as first revisor by selecting Tyrannosaurus as the valid name. The original Dynamosaurus material resides in the collections of the Natural History Museum, London.|$|E

5|$|Distribution of Tamerlane and Other Poems was {{so light}} that Rufus Wilmot Griswold in 1850 claimed {{it had never}} existed, noting that none had been <b>found.</b> <b>The</b> <b>first</b> known copy turned up in 1859 with a second found in 1874. A type {{facsimile}} of a copy held by the British Museum, edited and introduced by Richard Herne Shepherd, was published as a limited edition in 1884. Another copy of Tamerlane and Other Poems was published in a 1941 facsimile by Thomas Ollive Mabbott, who provided the introduction; his correction and additions to this are found in a subsequent publication.|$|E
5|$|During the Apollo 11 launch, Armstrong's heart {{reached a}} top rate of 110 beats per minute. He <b>found</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> stage {{to be the}} loudest—much noisier than the Gemini 8 Titan II launch—and the Apollo CSM was {{relatively}} roomy compared to the Gemini capsule. This ability to move around was suspected to be the reason why none of the Apollo 11 crew suffered from space sickness, while members of previous crews did. Armstrong was especially happy, {{as he had been}} prone to motion sickness as a child and could experience nausea after doing long periods of aerobatics.|$|E
5|$|In 1858, William Parker Foulke {{discovered}} {{the first known}} American dinosaur, in marl pits {{in the small town}} of Haddonfield, New Jersey. (Although fossils had been found before, their nature had not been correctly discerned.) The creature was named Hadrosaurus foulkii. It was an extremely important find: Hadrosaurus was one of the first nearly complete dinosaur skeletons <b>found</b> (<b>the</b> <b>first</b> was in 1834, in Maidstone, England), and it was clearly a bipedal creature. This was a revolutionary discovery as, until that point, most scientists had believed dinosaurs walked on four feet, like other lizards. Foulke's discoveries sparked a wave of dinosaur mania in the United States.|$|E

5|$|In 2016, Cassini <b>found</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> {{evidence}} of fluid-filled channels on Titan, {{in a series}} of deep, steep-sided canyons flowing into Ligeia Mare. This network of canyons, dubbed Vid Flumina, range in depth from 240 to 570m and have sides as steep as 40°. They are believed to have formed either by crustal uplifting, like Earth's Grand Canyon, or a lowering of sea level, or perhaps a combination of the two. The depth of erosion suggests that liquid flows in this part of Titan are long-term features that persist for thousands of years.|$|E
5|$|Remains {{from this}} era {{used to cover}} most of the site, and it is {{believed}} the Norse inhabited the site continuously from the ninth to the 14th centuries. Excavations in the 1930s by Alex Curle <b>found</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> confirmed Norse longhouse in the British Isles and later digs in the 1950s found evidence of fishing and farming activities. Sheep, cattle, pigs and ponies were kept, Atlantic cod, saithe and ling were eaten, and whale and seal bones have also been found along with {{the remains of a}} single dog. Chicken bones are rare in the Norse levels.|$|E
5|$|Until 1860, {{the only}} known dodo remains were the four {{incomplete}} 17th-century specimens. Philip Burnard Ayres <b>found</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> subfossil bones in 1860, which were sent to Richard Owen at the British Museum, who did not publish the findings. In 1863, Owen requested the Mauritian Bishop Vincent Ryan to spread word {{that he should be}} informed if any dodo bones were found. In 1865, George Clark, the government schoolmaster at Mahébourg, finally found an abundance of subfossil dodo bones in the swamp of Mare aux Songes in Southern Mauritius, after a 30-year search inspired by Strickland and Melville's monograph. In 1866, Clark explained his procedure to The Ibis, an ornithology journal: he had sent his coolies to wade through the centre of the swamp, feeling for bones with their feet. At first they found few bones, until they cut away herbage that covered the deepest part of the swamp, where they found many fossils. The swamp yielded the remains of over 300 dodos, but very few skull and wing bones, possibly because the upper bodies were washed away or scavenged while the lower body was trapped. The situation is similar to many finds of moa remains in New Zealand marshes. Most dodo remains from the Mare aux Songes have a medium to dark brown colouration.|$|E

5|$|The Einstein field {{equations}} are nonlinear {{and very}} difficult to solve. Einstein used approximation methods in working out initial predictions of the theory. But as early as 1916, the astrophysicist Karl Schwarzschild <b>found</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> non-trivial exact solution to the Einstein field equations, the Schwarzschild metric. This solution {{laid the groundwork for}} the description of the final stages of gravitational collapse, and the objects known today as black holes. In the same year, the first steps towards generalizing Schwarzschild's solution to electrically charged objects were taken, which eventually resulted in the Reissner–Nordström solution, now associated with electrically charged black holes. In 1917, Einstein applied his theory to the universe as a whole, initiating the field of relativistic cosmology. In line with contemporary thinking, he assumed a static universe, adding a new parameter to his original field equations—the cosmological constant—to match that observational presumption. By 1929, however, the work of Hubble and others had shown that our universe is expanding. This is readily described by the expanding cosmological solutions found by Friedmann in 1922, which do not require a cosmological constant. Lemaître used these solutions to formulate the earliest version of the Big Bang models, in which our universe has evolved from an extremely hot and dense earlier state. Einstein later declared the cosmological constant the biggest blunder of his life.|$|E
