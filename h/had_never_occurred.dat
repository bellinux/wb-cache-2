25|$|Thanksgiving {{occurred}} {{later in}} 1888 and 1899 than is possible under current U.S. law: {{as a result}} of changes between 1939 and 1941, Thanksgiving is always held on the fourth Thursday in November. The last time the fourth Thursday of November fell within Hanukkah before 2013 was in 1861, before Thanksgiving existed. As a result of this confusion, some media reports have mistakenly claimed that Thanksgivukkah <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>occurred</b> prior to 2013.|$|E
25|$|At T-31 seconds, {{just before}} Atlantis's {{computers}} {{were supposed to}} take control of the flight, the launch countdown clock stopped. This was because of a lack of an indication that the Gaseous Oxygen Vent Arm had retracted and properly latched, a problem that <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>occurred</b> during previous launches in the program's history. Soon the launch team was able to verify the Vent Arm's position with the help of a closed circuit camera, and the countdown clock resumed after approximately 2 minutes, 18 seconds.|$|E
25|$|The 876th {{and final}} CBS {{telecast}} of What's My Line? aired on September 3, 1967; it was highlighted by clips from past telecasts, {{a visit by}} the show's first contestants, a challenger from the New York unemployment office, and the final mystery guest, who was John Daly himself. Daly {{had always been the}} emergency mystery guest in case the scheduled guest was unable to appear on the live broadcast, but this <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>occurred.</b> Mark Goodson, Bill Todman and Johnny Olson appeared on-camera as well.|$|E

500|$|Originally, Shannon McMahon {{was to be}} a {{recurring}} character and was due to be featured in [...] "The Truth", the series finale of The X-Files. However, Lawless, who has a history of miscarriages, became pregnant shortly after part two of these episodes was filmed; her high-risk pregnancy prevented her returning to the series for future episodes. Carter called Lawless [...] "hot stuff", saying it was [...] "fun" [...] having a female Super Soldier, something that <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>occurred</b> to him or to the show's production crew.|$|E
500|$|In a November 2014 {{cover story}} for Out {{promoting}} The Imitation Game, Cumberbatch opened up about sexual experimentation {{during his time}} in boarding schools stating, [...] "While there was experimentation, it <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>occurred</b> to me as, 'Oh, this is that!' It was just boys and their penises, {{the same way with}} girls and vaginas and boobs. It wasn't out of desire." [...] LGBT group Stonewall released a statement praising Cumberbatch's comments, saying, [...] "Seeing someone in the public eye – especially somebody as influential as Benedict – talking positively around gay issues, is powerful for young lesbian, gay and bisexual people. It is often difficult for those growing up to find role models who demonstrate that it is equally okay to be gay or straight." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Yoda" [...] was {{originally}} written by [...] "Weird Al" [...] Yankovic {{during the initial}} run of the second Star Wars movie, the 1980 American epic space opera The Empire Strikes Back. The film introduced the character of Yoda, the ancient Jedi Master who trains Luke {{in the ways of}} The Force following the demise of Obi-Wan Kenobi. Yankovic later jokingly said that, [...] "Prior to The Empire Strikes Back, the thought of writing a song about Yoda <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>occurred</b> to me." [...] He {{toyed with the idea of}} writing a song based on the break-out character, but was unable to find a suitable piece to parody until one of his friends proposed that he use [...] "Lola"—"which I couldn't believe that I hadn't thought of myself, since I was such a huge Kinks fan." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{candidates}} {{waved at}} the crowd of 3,000 which had come to meet the plane, and rode together, with Nixon in place of honor, to a rally at City Island Stadium as Eisenhower chatted to Nixon as if the crisis <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>occurred.</b> At the stadium, Eisenhower introduced Nixon as a [...] "colleague" [...] who had been subject to [...] "a vicious and unprincipled attack" [...] but who had [...] "vindicated himself" [...] and who [...] "stood higher than ever before". The presidential candidate finished by reading two telegrams, one from Nixon's mother assuring the general of her son's integrity, and the second from Summerfield stating that the RNC had voted unanimously to retain Nixon on the ticket. Nixon then spoke, telling the crowd that {{this was one of}} two moments when he was most proud to be an American; the other had been at the victory parade in New York in 1945, when he had seen General Eisenhower go by. He called the Wheeling rally [...] "the greatest moment of my life".|$|E
500|$|Although {{the bridge}} was usable, work still had to be {{completed}} on the new bridge. The contractor promised the bridge corporation that the bridge would be finished by Labor Day of 1904, or September 5, 1904. The bridge corporation and a local group called The Red Men scheduled festivities and the official turnover of the bridge back to the corporation. On September 5, 1904, {{the day of the}} transfer, {{the chief executive of the}} contracting company, W.H. Keepers arrived, he found the bridge to be unacceptable. Bolts were missing in places of the bridge and paint was not completed, both of which were in violation of the contract. The festivities for the bridge were canceled, and visitors were disappointed. The Red Men held events, but the turnout was light. A high point of the events that day was done by a man named Murphy Jones, who as a stunt, jumped a [...] plunge into the Delaware River from the bridge. The festive stunt got Jones a total of $15 (1904 USD) and the event became an annual one. Work finally came to a conclusion in 1904, and the people were beginning to cross the new structure. However, since the turnover <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>occurred,</b> {{the bridge was}} free of charge.|$|E
500|$|Those with fitting names give differing {{accounts}} {{of the effect of}} their name on their career choices. Igor Judge, former Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, said he has no recollection of anyone commenting on his destined profession when he was a child, adding [...] "I'm absolutely convinced in my case it is entirely coincidental and I can't think of any evidence in my life that suggests otherwise." [...] James Counsell on the other hand, having chosen a career in law just like his father, his sibling, and two distant relatives, reported having been spurred on to join the bar from an early age and he cannot remember ever wanting to do anything else. Sue Yoo, an American lawyer, said that when she was younger people urged her to become a lawyer because of her name, which she thinks may have helped her decision. Weather reporter Storm Field was not sure about the influence of his name; his father, also a weather reporter, was his driving force. Psychology professor Lewis Lipsitt, a lifelong collector of aptronyms, was lecturing about nominative determinism in class when a student pointed out that Lipsitt himself was subject to the effect since he studied babies' sucking behaviour. Lipsitt said [...] "That <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>occurred</b> to me." [...] Church of England vicar Reverend Michael Vickers, who denied being a Vickers {{had anything to do with}} him becoming a vicar, suggesting instead that in some cases [...] "perhaps people are actually escaping from their name, rather than moving towards their job".|$|E

2500|$|The {{section of}} NY68 between the {{intersection}} with NY310 and US11 in Canton and CR29 in Pierrepont was {{offered by the}} state to St. Lawrence County in 1966 that they would turn over this [...] section and take over the alignments of Park Street in Canton, CR27 and CR29, a [...] alignment. In March 1967, the New York State Senate approved a bill to swap maintenance of the two roads. That April, Governor of New York Nelson Rockefeller signed the bill to transfer roads, with NY68 being designated as a less desirable alignment. By 1969, this changeover <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>occurred,</b> as NY68 remained on the shorter alignment.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{the damage}} had been done, and Cambridge, UK, 'declared victory': Levhari was wrong, Samuelson was wrong, Solow was wrong, MIT {{was wrong and}} {{therefore}} neoclassical economics was wrong. As a result there are some groups of economists who have abandoned neoclassical economics for their own refinements of classical economics. In the United States, on the other hand, mainstream economics goes on as if the controversy <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>occurred.</b> Macroeconomics textbooks discuss 'capital' {{as if it were}} a well-defined concept [...] which it is not, except in a very special one-capital-good world (or under other unrealistically restrictive conditions). The problems of heterogeneous capital goods have also been ignored in the 'rational expectations revolution' and in virtually all econometric work." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lane had {{an early}} {{introduction}} to controversies and disputed convictions when, in 1962, {{he was the}} junior Crown counsel {{in the trial of}} James Hanratty for the A6 murder. Hanratty was hanged but disputes over whether he was properly convicted have continued to this day. [...] He also represented the Metropolitan Police at the Brabin inquiry into the conviction and subsequent hanging of Timothy Evans for the murders at 10 Rillington Place in 1950. From the mid-1980s, concern grew. [...] On 5 December 1985, Lane quashed the conviction of Anthony Mycock who had been convicted of a robbery which the BBC television programme Rough Justice argued <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>occurred.</b> [...] In his judgment, Lane asserted {{that there had been a}} robbery and criticised the programme for [...] "outrageous" [...] interview methods.

2500|$|Seinfeld co-creator Larry David based George {{largely on}} himself. Seinfeld and David created the {{character}} as a counterpoint to Seinfeld's character. In {{the first draft}} of the show's pilot script, called [...] "Stand-Up" [...] at the time, George's name was Bennett and he, like Jerry, was a comedian. In that same draft, the scene in the pilot in which George and Jerry discuss a woman Jerry met earlier, saw George and Jerry discussing their stand-up act. This idea however, was quickly abandoned and his name was changed to George, the real estate broker instead. George's last name comes from Michael Costanza, a college classmate of Seinfeld. [...] "Louis", George's middle name is a homage to Lou Costello, whose 1950s television series The Abbott and Costello Show, inspired Seinfelds writing style. Although he is often asked whether he wanted to play the character, Larry David has said that he was only interested in writing the show, that, not only did he not want to act on the show, but it <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>occurred</b> to him and, even if it had, he highly doubted that NBC would have approved of his being cast.|$|E
