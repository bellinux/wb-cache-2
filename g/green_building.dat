40|$|MBA, North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 Due to the {{deterioration}} of the earth’s health and the uncertainty in terms of climate changes, economy, food, water and energy supplies, the above terms have become worldwide phenomena. Buildings have a huge role to play in addressing the environmental concerns as they play a contributing role in gas emissions, waste disposal and energy use. The literature review and results of the quantitative research amongst experts like facility and building managers, leasing agents, finance managers and project managers in the property sector formed the basis of the study. Although <b>green</b> <b>buildings</b> are regarded as the future, the study revealed that there is a perception, even amongst experts in the property sector that the upfront costs of <b>building</b> <b>green</b> is substantially higher when compared to building conventional, which limits the construction of <b>green</b> <b>buildings.</b> This research is aimed at investigating whether <b>building</b> <b>green</b> leads to financial benefits which will ultimately provide the differentiator {{when it comes down to}} a final decision whether to invest in <b>green</b> <b>buildings</b> or not. An overview is also provided on the fundamental principles of <b>green</b> <b>buildings</b> which are important to be implemented in the construction of <b>green</b> <b>buildings</b> in order to maximise the financial benefits provided by <b>green</b> <b>buildings.</b> The study showed that experts agreed that the concepts applied in <b>green</b> <b>buildings</b> lead to long-term financial savings which justifies the statement that a realistic comparison between the total costs of <b>building</b> <b>green</b> versus <b>building</b> conventional can only be achieved over the lifecycle of a building. The main finding of this study is that there is awareness and understanding of the financial benefits associated with <b>green</b> <b>buildings</b> which implies that <b>green</b> <b>buildings</b> have a good growth potential.

It first earned a Silver Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification under the United States <b>Green</b> <b>Building</b> Council LEED for New Construction program in 2004 and later Platinum Certification under LEED-EB (LEED for Existing Buildings) in 2007. The library's flooring is made of recycled rubber tires and there are charging stations for electric vehicles in the parking lot. In 2007, a rooftop garden was established atop the library, in addition to existing solar panels. The garden collects runoff and is maintained {{without the use of}} gasoline-powered lawn mowers and chemical pesticides or fertilizers.|$|E
5|$|To promote sustainability, {{the site}} was {{selected}} directly adjacent to an already used part of a major ski area. It was also designed to minimize vegetation and the ecological footprint in the area. For energy efficiency, trees were retained to cast shade with weather protection and a shading system used to cover parts of the track. The track itself is painted white to maintain low temperatures while minimizing energy demand on the refrigeration system. Waste heat from the refrigeration plant is captured and reused to heat buildings on-site, and could provide other heat uses in the future. Any wood waste created from site clearing activities during venue construction was composted for reuse. Other on-site buildings also followed similar <b>green</b> <b>building</b> design principles.|$|E
5|$|Energy {{efficient}} and sustainability features designed {{into the project}} led to a LEED Gold certification from the U.S. <b>Green</b> <b>Building</b> Council. Elements {{that led to this}} include landscaping that reduces runoff from rainwater, lots of natural light, a more efficient HVAC system that is located under the floors, and a location near public transit. Landscaping includes using drought resistant native species to reduce the need for irrigation. The floor-based HVAC system is more energy {{efficient and}} helps keep the temperature of the entire building more even and uses radiant heating and cooling. Additionally, the construction used environmentally friendly sealants, carpets, paints, and adhesives as well as preventing 90% of the construction waste from entering landfills. Also, potable water usage is reduced by 40% due to the use of low-flow sinks, showers, and toilets. The contractor also recycled 90% of the materials from the building that previously occupied the site.|$|E

5|$|LCA is {{used for}} example in the {{building}} sector. Buildings today account for the 40% of the world’s energy use. The resulting carbon emissions are substantially {{higher than those of}} the transportation sector. New buildings using more energy than necessary are being built every day, and millions of today's inefficient buildings will remain standing until at least 2050. It’s therefore necessary to start reducing energy use in new and existing buildings {{in order to reduce the}} planet's energy-related carbon footprint. Growing interest, space, and attention in the architecture sector are directed to environmental issues according to the principles of <b>green</b> <b>building.</b> Mineral, vegetable, or animal materials such as perlite, vermiculite, rock wool, glass wool, cork, plant fibers (cotton, flax, hemp, coconut), wood fiber, cellulose, and sheep's wool can be used for the production of insulation panels.|$|E

In 2006, he founded the Make It Right Foundation, organizing housing professionals in New Orleans to finance and construct 150sustainable, affordable new houses in New Orleans's Ninth Ward following the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina. The project involves 13 architectural firms and the environmental organization Global Green USA, with several of the firms donating their services.

Third, we relate the economic premiums for <b>green</b> <b>buildings</b> to their sustainability, confirming that the attributes rated for both thermal efficiency and sustainability contribute to premiums in rents and asset values. Even among <b>green</b> <b>buildings,</b> increased energy efficiency is fully capitalized into rents and asset values. Economics...|$|R

To overcome this limitation, the electricity and gas consumption quantities and costs of a sample of 10 conventional, 20 energy-retrofitted and three green Toronto schools following the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design Rating (LEED) System for New Construction were analysed in this study. The analysis conducted over eight years for conventional and energy-retrofitted schools, and since their inception for green schools, showed surprisingly that energy-retrofitted and green schools spent 37 % more on electricity than conventional schools. Nevertheless, green schools spent 56 % and 41 % less on gas than conventional and energy-retrofitted schools respectively. Their total energy costs were also 28 % lower than conventional and energy-retrofitted schools. Nevertheless, these savings do not always justify their construction cost premiums.
