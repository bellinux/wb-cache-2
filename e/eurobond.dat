However, the sovereign debt of Pakistan has increased dramatically, with total debts and liabilities swelled to Rs. 22.5trillion (or $73billion) by August 2016. Sharif administration also issued a five-year $500-million <b>Eurobond</b> in 2015 at the interest rate of 8.25% and in September 2016, it also raised $1billion by floating Sukuk (Islamic bonds) at an interest rate of 5.5%.|$|E
500|$|The Economist {{provides}} a somewhat modified approach to saving the euro in that [...] "a limited version of federalisation could be less miserable solution than break-up of the euro". The recipe to this tricky {{combination of the}} limited federalisation, greatly lies on mutualisation for limiting the fiscal integration. In order for overindebted countries to stabilise the dwindling euro and economy, the overindebted countries require [...] "access to money and for banks to have a [...] "safe" [...] euro-wide class of assets that is not tied to the fortunes of one country" [...] which could be obtained by [...] "narrower <b>Eurobond</b> that mutualises {{a limited amount of}} debt for a limited amount of time". The proposition made by German Council of Economic Experts provides detailed blue print to mutualise the current debts of all euro-zone economies above 60% of their GDP. Instead of the break-up and issuing new national governments bonds by individual euro-zone governments, [...] "everybody, from Germany (debt: 81% of GDP) to Italy (120%) would issue only these joint bonds until their national debts fell to the 60% threshold. The new mutualised-bond market, worth some €2.3 trillion, would be paid off over the next 25 years. Each country would pledge a specified tax (such as a VAT surcharge) to provide the cash." [...] So far, German Chancellor Angela Merkel has opposed all forms of mutualisation.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the <b>eurobonds</b> discussion {{based on the}} existing literature. The topic is relevant, since the <b>eurobonds</b> discussion revived strongly during the euro crisis. Moreover, the European Systemic Risk Board launched a new proposal on the new <b>eurobonds,</b> European Safe Bonds (ESBies) in the fall 2016 which makes this topic even timelier. The current <b>eurobonds</b> proposal {{is based on the}} approach introduced by Markus Brunnermeier et al. (2011) and its aim to break the diabolic loop between banks and states by creating a safe asset. The problem of this, and in other <b>eurobonds</b> proposals, is however limiting moral hazard. The main objectives of this thesis were to describe the reasons and origins for the current discussion and to understand the basic elements of the <b>eurobonds</b> in the light of moral hazard. The aim is to give a more technical approach to the theme and start the discussion about the problematic issues. As the research and proposals on <b>Eurobonds</b> don’t cover all the critical elements, e. g. the future of the EMU or the political consequences of the <b>Eurobonds,</b> a need for further studies and research still exists...|$|R

At foreign fronts, Aziz maintained a [...] "Telephone Policy" [...] on diplomatic engagement with Israel, whilst keeping Saudi Arabia and Turkey in tacit contact. During his tenure, bilateral {{relations with the}} United Kingdom were enhanced and reached {{to a new level}} after meeting with British Prime Minister Tony Blair in 2005 and tightened the economic and defence relations with British counterpart Gordon Brown in 2007. Brown thanked Aziz for the successful launching of $500 million <b>Eurobond,</b> which was oversubscribed four times. After assuming the office of prime minister, Aziz left for China, as his foreign state visit as prime minister in 2004. In 2007, Aziz made his final state visit as Prime minister to China to proceed to sign a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with China, and regarded the country as [...] "strategic partner" [...] and a [...] "time-tested friend," [...] whilst China regarded the FTA agreement as [...] "a historic development". Aziz built closer economic ties with India while alleviating the territorial conflicts and after meeting with Indian counterpart Manmohan Singh, a confident measuring building process was initiated by Prime minister Aziz.|$|E

Comparison concerns risk and jumps during the international financial crisis period: February 2007 up to February 2010. Among the BRIC countries, Chinese <b>Eurobonds</b> are the most significant {{in terms of both}} risk and jumps.

40|$|As {{part of a}} {{collective}} answer to {{the threat posed by}} the Great Recession to several Member States' public finances, the European Commission's November 2011 Green Paper discussed the introduction of Stability Bonds (or <b>Eurobonds)</b> that would partially or completely replace the national bonds of the Euro Area's Member States. Having triggered fierce debates among policy-makers across and within European countries, this article investigates European citizens' opinions about <b>Eurobonds,</b> and the step towards further European fiscal integration they represent. Using a novel dataset derived from the Eurobarometer surveys, we show that, at the individual level, political ideology, distrust towards EU institutions and altruism appear more relevant than self-interest in shaping preferences for/against <b>Eurobonds.</b> However, at the country level, opinion towards <b>Eurobonds</b> strongly reflects the expected costs/benefits from Eurobonds' introduction for ones country. Finally, a notable intra-generational divide exists across young citizens of PIIGS and non-PIIGS countries, reflecting the diverse expected future costs and benefits of <b>Eurobonds</b> across both regions.
