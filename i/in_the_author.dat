25|$|A 2008 {{computer}} {{analysis of the}} Book of Mormon text supports this theory, although the study does not include Joseph Smith <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>author</b> sample {{on the ground that}} few pure examples of Smith's writings are extant. Several other significant problems are apparent in the methodology of this {{computer analysis}}, specifically the use of closed set methodology instead of open set methodology. For example, the original methodology, when replicated, also assigns Rigdon as the probable author of The Federalist Papers, which were written five years before his birth. Critics of the Spalding–Rigdon theory point out that there is no record of any meeting between Rigdon and Smith until December 1830, nearly a year after the Book of Mormon was published.|$|E

25|$|Additionally, {{authors are}} {{expected}} to keep all study data for later examination even after publication. Both scientific and academic censure can result from a failure to keep primary data; the case of Ranjit Chandra of Memorial University of Newfoundland {{provides an example of}} this. Many scientific journals also require that authors provide information to allow readers to determine whether the authors may have commercial or non-commercial conflicts of interest. Outlined <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>author</b> disclosure statement for the American Journal of Human Biology, this is a policy more common in scientific fields where funding often comes from corporate sources. Authors are also commonly required to provide information about ethical aspects of research, particularly where research involves human or animal participants or use of biological material. Provision of incorrect information to journals may be regarded as misconduct. Financial pressures on universities have encouraged this type of misconduct. The majority of recent cases of alleged misconduct involving undisclosed conflicts of interest or failure of the authors to have seen scientific data involve collaborative research between scientists and biotechnology companies.|$|E

If the warriors of the bakufu preferred [...] "quick-moving narrative scrolls" [...] such as war tales or legends, the production of emaki at the Heian court subsisted. Pictures illustrating The Tale of Genji continued to be popular into the early Kamakura period and revived interest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>author,</b> Murasaki Shikibu. Towards the end of the 13th century, a renewed interest in the refined culture of the Heian period led some artists to return to painting styles of the Imperial Court; many emaki were produced during this period.|$|E

500|$|It also {{marked the}} first time that {{copyright}} had been vested primarily <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>author,</b> rather than the publisher, and also {{the first time that the}} injurious treatment of authors by publishers was recognised; regardless of what authors signed away, the second 14-year term of copyright would automatically return to them. Even in the 21st century, the Statute of Anne is [...] "frequently invoked by modern judges and academics as embodying the utilitarian underpinnings of copyright law". In IceTV v Nine Network, for example, the High Court of Australia noted that the title of the Statute [...] "echoed explicitly the emphasis on the practical or utilitarian importance that certain seventeenth-century philosophers attached to knowledge and its encouragement in the scheme of human progress". Despite [...] "widely recognised flaws", the Act became a model copyright statute, both within the United Kingdom and internationally. Christophe Geiger notes that it is [...] "a difficult, almost impossible task" [...] to analyse the relationship between the Statute of Anne and early French copyright law, both because it is difficult to make a direct connection, and because the ongoing debate over both has led to radically different interpretations of each nation's law.|$|E
500|$|From late 1910 {{to early}} 1912, Cerna {{was at the}} University of Leipzig, where he {{attended}} courses held by the philosophers and psychologists Wilhelm Wundt, Eduard Spranger and Hans Volkelt. Wundt left an enduring impression on his Romanian student. In a letter home, Cerna described his modest appearance, which he claimed recalled that of [...] "decrepit" [...] Orthodox members of the Romanian Jewish community, adding: [...] "But I do love this decrepit exterior beyond measure..." [...] Volkelt guided Cerna's research in the scientific field, and coordinated his PhD thesis of 1913, Die Gedankenlyrik (German for [...] "Contemplative Poetry"). According to Călinescu, Cerna's work stated the primacy of [...] "natural ideas" [...] over reasoning, and concluded that [...] "ideas have the purpose of signaling the problematic tensions of the soul." [...] Zarifopol wrote that Cerna was upset over having himself parted with writing poetry, and came to be preoccupied by Maiorescu's German-language dictum: In der Poesie ist der Gedanke ein verfluchtes Ding ("An idea is a damned thing {{when it comes to}} poetry"). Panait Cerna's first volume of collected poetry was published at home in 1910, and, two years later, resulted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>author</b> being made a co-recipient of the Romanian Academy's Vasile Adamachi Award.

2500|$|Rules for {{the order}} of {{multiple}} authors in a list have historically varied significantly between fields of research. Some fields list authors in order of their degree {{of involvement in the}} work, with the most active contributors listed first; other fields, such as mathematics or engineering (e.g., control theory), sometimes list them alphabetically. Historically biologists tended to place a principal investigator (supervisor or lab head) last in an author list whereas organic chemists might have put him or her first. Research articles in high energy physics, where the author lists can number in the tens to hundreds, often list authors alphabetically. [...] In Computer Science in general the principal contributor is the first <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>author</b> list. However, the practice of putting the principal investigator last <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>author</b> list has increasingly become an accepted standard across most areas in science and engineering.|$|E

2500|$|The {{printing}} prerogatives granted {{until then}} were rights accorded to the printers, {{not to the}} authors of a work. The first copyright provisions in a modern sense as rights an author has over uses of his work appeared in the reign of Alexander I, when he issued on April 22, 1828 a [...] "Statute on censorship" [...] ( [...] ; [...] ) that contained five articles on copyright. This law granted authors or translators the exclusive rights to reproduce, publish, and distribute their works, and recognized their right {{to be paid for}} uses or reproductions of their works. Copyright was automatic and was vested <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>author</b> or translator upon the creation of the work and without any need for a registration. The law defined a copyright term of the lifetime of the author plus 25 years (25 years p.m.a.). It also defined a [...] "freedom of translation": any work was free to be translated without the consent of its author, and the translator got a new copyright on the translation. Copyright was extinguished if the work didn't meet the censorship regulations (i.e., was censored).|$|E
