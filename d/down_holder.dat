5000|$|In {{the third}} quarter, Washington {{drove down to}} the Oregon State three but did not gain a yard on three attempts. On fourth <b>down,</b> <b>holder</b> and backup quarterback, Chris Chandler fumbled the snap. He {{recovered}} in time to throw an interception to Lavance Northington. On an ensuing drive, the Huskies scored a touchdown to take a 17-14 lead. With 1:32 left in the quarter, the Huskies had the ball first-and-goal at the Beaver one. On first down, Osia Lewis tackled Washington's starting tailback, Vince Weathersby, outside of the end zone. On second down, Paul Saunders knocked Hugh Millen back for a loss on a quarterback sneak. On third down, Lewis [...] "killed" [...] Weathersby. Lewis' hit knocked the ball loose and knocked Weathersby out of the game. The Beavers' Lavance Northington recovered the loose football. Weathersby joined Washington's starting fullback, Rick Fenney, and wide receiver, Lonzell Hill, on the sidelines {{for the remainder of}} the game. With 7:59 left in the game, the Huskies hit a 43-yard field goal to stretch the lead to 20-14. The Beavers drove down to the Washington 11 but turned the ball over on downs with 3:22 left. The Huskies pushed the ball to their own 30 but were forced to punt with 1:29 left. Watching film before the game, the Beavers' Andre Todd noticed that the blocker he was matched up against tended to block to the outside. Todd faked outside and cut inside untouched, managing to block the punt, which bounded into the end zone. If not for a queer bounce, it likely would have squirted out of bounds for a safety, but Northington out-raced Todd to pounce on the ball for a touchdown, knotting the score at 20. Northington finished with two fumble recoveries, an interception, and a touchdown. Nielsen's extra point gave Oregon State a 21-20 lead. Washington managed to make it to the 50 before turning the ball over on downs. Oregon State could not manage to run out the clock, punting the ball back to the Huskies with 20 seconds left. Washington made it to their own 26. On the last play of the game, Lopez intercepted his second Washington pass at the Beaver 37.|$|E

He does not answer her and she fires him. Stan (Brent Sexton) calls from jail and leaves a message. He is required {{to talk to a}} therapist before posting bail. At the Larsen apartment, the detectives tell Terry (Jamie Anne Allman) that Rosie was making deposits to a bank account opened in Terry’s name. She denies opening an account. Linden points out that Rosie would have needed Terry’s identification to open the account. Terry then admits loaning her identification to Rosie, but only to get into a club. The detectives drive to an alley and show a picture of Rosie to Cami (Alisen <b>Down),</b> <b>Holder's</b> former coworker and undercover cop posing as a prostitute.

Desperate was the hand-to-hand fighting, and valor more conspicuous than that of the Ghazis was never shown. Furiously they threw themselves upon the line of their opponents; clutching their muskets and trying to wrench them from their hands, while they strove to cut <b>down</b> their <b>holders.</b> Many of them threw themselves upon the fixed bayonets, and died in the endeavor to cut down the soldiers with their swords; but the three regiments which formed the line--one British (the 59th), one Ghoorkas, and one Sikhs--alike held their own, and poured rolling volleys into the ranks of the enemy.|$|R

50|$|At {{the end of}} the 19th century many {{water systems}} were over-appropriated. Alternating years od {{droughts}} and floods created havoc for land owners and rights <b>holders</b> <b>down</b> stream. In 1902 Kansas took Colorado to the Supreme Court over the water usage of the Arkansas River. The federal government weighed in on the case and the Supreme Court ruled that the states and federal government share jurisdiction and each must be treated fairly. Seven states in the region, Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, Wyoming, Nevada, Arizona and California, came together as the League of the Southwest to promote development of the Colorado River. But as more conflicts arose over water rights more lawsuits were filed. In 1922 Herbert Hoover, then Secretary of Commerce, brought representatives from the seven states to Washington, D.C. to negotiate an interstate treaty. This commission, the brainchild of Delphus E. Carpenter, resulted in the Colorado River Compact. The compact allocated water to each of the states, allowing agricultural irrigation, urban development, and large projects such as the Hoover Dam and Lake Powell. More compacts covering other river basins soon followed.|$|R
40|$|In this work, AISI 1010 steel {{samples were}} plasma {{nitrided}} into 20 % N 2 100 Pa and 400 Pa for N 2 and H 2, respectively), temperatures of 500 and 580 °C, during 2 h. Three different procedures for cooling were accomplished after nitriding. In the first procedure the cooling occurred naturally, that is, {{the sample was}} kept on substrate holder. In the second one the sample was pulled off and cooling in a cold surface. Finally, in the third cooling process the sample was pulled off the substrate <b>holder</b> <b>down</b> into special reservoir filled with oil held at ambient temperature. The properties of the AISI 1010 steel samples were characterized by optical and electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Mössbauer spectroscopy and microhardness tests. Thermal gradient inside the sample kept on substrate holder during cooling process was measured by three inserted thermocouples at different depths. When samples were cooled rapidly the transformation of ϵ-Fe 2 − 3 N to γ′-Fe 4 N was inhibited. Such effect is indicated by the high concentration of ϵ-Fe compound zone. To get solid state solution of nitrogen in the diffusion zone, instead of precipitates of nitride phases, the cooling rate should be higher than a critical value of about 0. 95 °C/s. When this value is reached at any depth of the diffusion zone, two distinct diffusion zones will appear. Temperature gradients were measured inside the samples {{as a consequence of}} the plasma treatment. It's suggested the need for standardization of the term “treatment temperature” for plasma treatment because different nitrided layer properties could be reported for the same “treatment temperature”.

40|$|This paper {{explains}} the various concepts of government debt in the euro area with {{particular emphasis on}} its size and composition. In terms of size, the paper focuses on different definitions that are in use, in particular the concept of gross general government debt used in the surveillance of the euro area countries, the total liabilities from the government balance sheet approach, and the net debt concept which subtracts government fi nancial assets from the liability side. In addition, it discusses “hidden debt” {{in the form of}} implicit and contingent liabilities. In terms of composition, the paper provides information about euro area government debt broken <b>down</b> by maturity, <b>holder</b> or the currency of issue. All these indicators illustrate a sharp increase in government debt in most euro area countries {{as a result of the}} crisis. This in turn has several policy implications: (i) the growing government debt ratios need to be stabilised and put on a downward path which improves market confidence; (ii) fiscal surveillance needs to put more emphasis on government debt indicators than in the past; (iii) government financial assets could play a role when analysing solvency issues; (iv) implicit and other off-balance-sheet government liabilities need to be carefully monitored and reported; (v) the gross debt concept should remain the key basis for fiscal surveillance in the EU and for the Excessive Deficit Procedure in particular; (vi) beyond the size of government debt its composition is also a key factor behind public finance vulnerabilities.
