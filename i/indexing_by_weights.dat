40|$|ABSTRACT The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop a model for calculation and analysis of production costs of lamb and, from that, to elaborate a production cost index. Panel meetings were held in five regions of the state of São Paulo, Brazil, to define technical features of representative properties of lamb production, taken as a basis for the preparation of the cost calculation model. Then the model for production cost calculation was built. The third step consisted of monitoring prices of inputs used, calculating production costs along the studied period, and generating the cost <b>index,</b> <b>by</b> the Laspeyres model. Lastly, questionnaires were applied to sheep producers, to validate the cost index. The model for production cost calculation was planned to be of easy utilization by farmers, and simultaneously faithful to the theoretical principles. The adopted scheme of cost allocation followed the classification of "variable", "fixed operating", and "income of factors". We generated cost indexes for each of the five studied regions, which were then aggregated in a state <b>index,</b> <b>by</b> <b>weighting</b> regional <b>indexes</b> <b>by</b> flock size. More than 97 % of the answers to the validation questionnaires were positive, so we considered that the index reached a high level of approval. The application of Economic Theory is essential for the development of cost calculation models. The developed model has potential to generate important information that can help producers to make decisions. It can work in many contexts, and it can even be adapted to other livestock species. The production cost index for lamb was approved and can collaborate with the organization of the sheep agroindustrial system...|$|R

An examination of the methodologies adopted by these studies is helpful in evaluating {{the strengths and weaknesses}} of various statistical tools that accommodate different types of research questions. Most of the studies described above differed in terms of the statistical methods used in their analyses. Some studies only utilized t tests to identify significant differences in KAP scores between interest groups (Mahmoodabad et al. 2008; Ly et al. 2007; Xiang et al. 2010; Liebenehem et al. 2009; Negro-Calduch, et al. 2013). Some studies created binary KAP variables by categorizing KAP levels into groups (often negative and positive groups) (Kumar and Popat 2010; Leggat et al. 2007; Lau et al. 2007; Fielding et al. 2005); these studies restricted the scope of their analyses because regression coefficients could not capture the full variation in KAP levels or in factors that influence those scores. Some other authors limited the KAP indices to two or three points and hence did not capture as much variation in dependent variables and may not have fully measured the respondents’ KAP (Imai et al. 2005; Mahmoodabad et al. 2008; Fielding et al. 2005; Tiongco et al. 2012).

STUDY DESIGN: We developed a three-regime switching regression model {{to examine the effects}} of lifestyle, dietary behavior, and sociodemographic factors on body mass <b>index</b> (BMI) <b>by</b> <b>weight</b> category and accommodating endogeneity of exercise and food intake to avoid simultaneous equation bias. Marginal effects are calculated to assess the impacts of explanatory variables on the probabilities of weight categories and BMI levels. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Weight categories and exercise are found to be endogenous. Lifestyle, dietary behavior, social status, and other sociodemographic factors affect BMI differently across weight categories. Education, employment, and income have strong impacts on the likelihood of overweight and obesity. Exercise reduces the probabilities of being overweight and obese and the level of BMI among overweight individuals.
