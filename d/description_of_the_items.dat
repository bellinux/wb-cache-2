Kelly Bush, Reubens' personal representative at the time, said the <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>items</b> was inaccurate and claimed the objects were [...] "Rob Lowe's sex videotape, and a few 30- to 100-year-old kitsch collectible images." [...] Reubens turned himself in to the Hollywood division of the LAPD and was charged with possession of obscene material improperly depicting a child under the age of 18 in sexual conduct. The district attorney looked at Reubens' collection and computer and found no grounds for bringing any felony charges against him, while the city attorney, Rocky Delgadillo brought misdemeanor charges against Reubens on the last day allowed by the statute. Reubens was represented by Hollywood criminal defense lawyer Blair Berk. In December he pleaded not guilty through Berk, who also complained that the city attorney failed to turn over evidence to the defense, which City Attorney Richard Katz countered that prosecutors were not required to do until after arraignment, after which they did; neither side disclosed the contents.|$|E

5000|$|The term saga {{originates}} {{from the}} Norse saga (pl. sögur), and refers to (1) [...] "what is said, statement" [...] or (2) [...] "story, tale, history". It is cognate with the English word saw (as in old saw), and the German Sage. Icelandic sagas {{are based on}} oral traditions and much {{research has focused on}} what is real and what is fiction within each tale. The accuracy of the sagas is often hotly disputed. Most of the manuscripts in which the sagas are preserved were taken to Denmark and Sweden in the 17th century, but later returned to Iceland. Classic sagas were composed in the 13th century. Scholars once believed that these sagas were transmitted orally from generation to generation until scribes wrote them down in the 13th century. However, most scholars now believe the sagas were conscious artistic creations, based on both oral and written tradition. A study focusing on the <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>items</b> of clothing mentioned in the sagas concludes that the authors attempted to create a historic [...] "feel" [...] to the story, by dressing the characters in what was at the time thought to be [...] "old fashioned clothing".

As long as one of the things you're not thinking about me is that I'm a pedophile. Because that's not true." [...] Paul Reubens on the charges. In March 2004, child pornography charges were dropped in exchange for Reubens' guilty plea to a lesser charge. For the next three years, he was required to register his address with the sheriff's office and he could not be in the company of minors without the permission of a parent or legal guardian. Reubens later stated that he was a collector of erotica, including films, muscle magazines and a sizable collection of mostly homosexual vintage erotica, such as photographic studies of teen nudes. Reubens said that what the city attorney's office viewed as pornography, he considered to be innocent art and that what they described as people underage engaged in masturbation or oral copulation was, in fact, a judgmental {{point of view of the}} nudes that Reubens described as people [...] "one hundred percent not" [...] performing sexual acts. Being an avid collector, Reubens had often purchased bulk lots, and one of his vintage magazine dealers declared that [...] "there's no way" [...] he could have known the content of each page in the publications he bought and that he recalled Reubens asking for [...] "physique magazines, vintage 1960s material, but not things featuring kids".|$|E

40|$|Modeling user {{behavior}} to detect segments of users to target {{and to whom}} address ads (behavioral targeting) is a problem widely-studied in the literature. Various sources of data are mined and modeled in order to detect these segments, such as the queries issued by the users.

Then we propose a method that analyzes the <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>items</b> positively evaluated by the users and extracts a vector representation of the words in these descriptions (word embeddings). Since it is widely-known that users tend to choose items of the same categories, our approach is designed to avoid the so-called preference stability, which would associate the users to trivial segments. Moreover, we make sure that the interpretability of the generated segments is a characteristic offered to the advertisers who will use them. We performed different sets of experiments on a large real-world dataset, which validated our approach and showed its capability to produce effective segments...|$|E

40|$|In many {{situations}} of industrial interest, a sorting process {{has to be}} performed in order to separate different or undesired items among those flowing on a moving conveyor belt. This process consists {{of looking at the}} items distributed on the conveyor, localizing any single item, classifying it on the basis of features that make it acceptable or not and, if applicable, gripping it to perform the necessary separation. Fundamental issues here are therefore sensing, i. e., detecting and classifying the items, and gripping, i. e., realizing the required separation in the most efficient way. The two parts of this work deal with these two issues in automatic sorting and present advanced solutions for the sorting of recyclable packaging, an application where the unstructured work environment represents the main difficulty towards the process automation. In Part 1, in particular, the problem of localizing and identifying the wasted items on the moving belt is addressed. The proposed solution is based {{on the use of the}} height profile of the objects on the conveyor belt, sampled through a 3 D optical device (laser beam plus CCD camera). With the help of fuzzy techniques, a geometrical <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>items</b> is obtained, on which basis a neural classifier can be built.

The aim of this validation study was to assess intrarater and interrater reliability using this {{modified version}} of PASS, at a stroke unit, for patients in the acute phase after their first event of stroke. Methods: In the intrarater reliability study 114 patients and in the interrater reliability study 15 patients were examined twice with the test within one to 24 hours in the first week after stroke. Spearman’s rank correlation, Kappa coefficients, Percentage Agreement and the newer rank-invariant methods; Relative Position, Relative Concentration and Relative rank Variance were used for the statistical analysis. Results: For the intrarater reliability Spearman’s rank correlations were 0. 88 - 0. 98 and k were 0. 70 - 0. 93 for the individual items. Small, statistically significant, differences were found for two items regarding Relative Position and for one item regarding Relative Concentration. There was no Relative rank Variance for any single item. For the interrater reliability, Spearman’s rank correlations were 0. 77 - 0. 99 for individual items.
