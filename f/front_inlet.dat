5000|$|To start, a {{jet engine}} {{requires}} pneumatic {{rotation of the}} turbine, AC-electrical fuel pumps, and an AC-electrical [...] "flash" [...] that ignites the fuel. As the turbine (behind the combustion chamber) is already rotating, the <b>front</b> <b>inlet</b> fans are also rotating. After the ignition, both fans and turbine speed up their rotation. As combustion stabilizes, the engine thereafter only needs the fuel to run at idle. The started engine can now replace the APU when starting up further engines. During flight the APU and its generator are not needed.APUs are also used to run accessories while the engines are shut down. This allows the cabin to be comfortable while the passengers are boarding before the aircraft's engines are started. Electrical power is used to run systems for preflight checks. Some APUs are also connected to a hydraulic pump, allowing crews to operate hydraulic equipment (such as flight controls or flaps) prior to engine start. This function can also be used, on some aircraft, as a backup in flight in case of engine or hydraulic failure.|$|E

40|$|During a {{campaign}} to study ozone loss mechanisms in the Arctic stratosphere (SOLVE), several instruments on NASA 2 ̆ 7 s ER· 2 aircraft obser ved a very low number density (0. 1 I-I) of large, nitric-acid-containing particles that form the polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs). For effective physical and chemical characterization of these particles, the measurements from these instruments have to be intercompared and integrated. In particular, proper interpretation requires knowledge of the sampling characteristics of the particles into the instruments. Here, we present the calculation of the sampling characteristics of {{the one of the}} instruments on the ER- 2, the NOAA NOy instrument. This instrument sampled ambient particles and gas from two forward-facing inlets located fore and aft on a particle-separation housing (the football) and measured total NOy in the sample. In recent studies, ambient aero sol mass has been estimated by the difference of the measurements of the two inlets with the assumption that the rear inlet observation s represent the gas-phase NOy and small particles and the <b>front</b> <b>inlet</b> samples represent gas-phase NOy and all particle sizes with varied efficiency (anisokinetic sampling). This knowledge was derived largelyfrom semiempirical relations and potential flow studies of the housing. In our study, we usedCFD simulations to model the compressible flow conditions and considered noncontinuum effects in calculating particle trajectories. Our simulations show that the blunt body housing the inlets has a strong and complex interaction with the flow and particles sampled by the two inlets. The simulations show that the <b>front</b> <b>inlet</b> characteristics are influenced by the effect of the blunt body on the upstream pres sure field. The rear inlet sampling characteristics are influenced both by the shape and size of the inlet and its location on the blunt body. These interaction s result in calculated inlet characteristics that are significantly different from previously assumed values. Analysis of the SOLVE data, considering the ambient conditions and the calculated inlet sampling characteristics, in conjunction with thermodynamic growth modeling of super-cooled ternary solution (STS) particles, provides validation of the CFD results...|$|E

Two 12 -inch, tip-turbine driven fans were used to simulate a tandem fan engine. Three testing modes simulated a V/STOL tandem fan airplane. Parallel mode has two separate propulsion streams for maximum low speed performance. A <b>front</b> <b>inlet,</b> fan, and downward vectorable nozzle forms one stream. An auxilliary top inlet provides air to the aft fan - supplying the core engine and aft vectorable nozzle. Front nozzle and top inlet closure, and removal of a blocker door separating the two streams configures the tandem fan for series mode operations as a typical aircraft propulsion system. Transition mode operation is formed by intermediate settings of the front nozzle, blocker door, and top inlet. Emphasis was on the total pressure recovery and flow distortion at the aft fan face. A range of fan flow rates were tested at tunnel airspeeds from 0 to 240 knots, and angles-of-attack from - 10 to 40 deg for all three modes.

40|$|The {{performance}} {{benefit of}} boundary layer or wake ingestion on marine and air vehicles {{has been well}} documented and explored. In this article, a quasi-one-dimensional boundary layer ingestion (BLI) benefit analysis for subsonic and transonic propulsion systems is performed using a control volume of a ducted propulsion system that ingests the boundary layer developed by the external airframe surface. To illustrate the BLI benefit, a relationship between the amount of BLI and the net thrust is established and analyzed for two propulsor types. One propulsor is an electric fan, and the other is a pure turbojet. These engines can be modeled as a turbofan with an infinite bypass ratio for the electric fan, and with a zero bypass ratio for the pure turbojet. The analysis considers two flow processes: a boundary layer being ingested by an aircraft inlet and a shock wave sitting in <b>front</b> of the <b>inlet.</b> Though the two processes are completely unrelated, both represent a loss of total pressure and velocity. In real applications, it is possible to have both processes occurring in <b>front</b> of the <b>inlet</b> of a transonic vehicle. Preliminary analysis indicates that the electrically driven propulsion system benefits most from the boundary layer ingestion and the presence of transonic shock waves, whereas the benefit for the turbojet engine is near zero or negative depending on the amount of total temperature rise across the engine...|$|R

5000|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} breakthroughs, {{in the development of the}} waterjet, was to change the design so it expelled the jetstream above the water line, contrary to many people's intuition.

It makes no difference to the amount of thrust generated whether the outlet is above or below the waterline, but having it above the waterline reduces hull resistance and draught. Hamilton's first waterjet design had the outlet below the hull and actually in <b>front</b> of the <b>inlet.</b> This probably meant that disturbed water was entering the jet unit and reducing its performance, and the main reason why the change to above the waterline made such a difference.|$|R
40|$|Turbo-pumps have weak points, {{such as the}} pumping {{operation}} is unstable on the positive slope of the head curve and/or the cavitation occurs at the low suction head. To improve simultaneously both weak points, the first author invented the unique pumping unit composed of the tandem impellers and the peculiar motor with the double rotational armatures. The front and the rear impellers are driven by the inner and the outer armatures of the motor, respectively. Both impeller speeds are automatically and smartly adjusted {{in response to the}} pumping discharge, while the rotational torques between both impellers/armatures are counter-balanced. Such speeds contribute to suppress successfully not only the unstable operation at the low discharge but also the cavitation at the high discharge, as verified with the axial flow type pumping unit in the previous paper. Continuously, this paper investigates experimentally the effects of the tandem impeller profiles on the pump performances and the rotational speeds against the discharge, using the impellers whose loads are low and/or high at the normal discharge. The worthy remarks are that (a) the unstable operation is suppressed as expected and the shut off power is scarcely large in the smart control, (b) the blade profile contributes to determine the discharge giving the maximum/minimum rotational speed where the reverse flow may incipiently appears at the <b>front</b> impeller <b>inlet,</b> (c) the tandem impeller profiles scarcely affect the rotational speeds, while the loads of the front and the rear impellers ar...|$|R
40|$|Improving {{effluent}} water quality to receiving waters using stormwater ponds and storage tanks is acknowledged {{to be an}} effective method. The performance of the method depends however on flow conditions such as velocity distribution, short-circuiting currents and the volume through which the influent water flows, the so called effective volume. Enhancing performance, e. g. increasing the settling of suspended solids in stormwater ponds, demands better design and a deeper understanding of fluid dynamics. The overall objectives of the work reported in this thesis are to study the possibilities of using a generic Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software and three-dimensional flow simulations as a design-engineering tool and to enhance knowledge of fluid dynamics in stormwater ponds and detention tanks. To be able to use three-dimensional simulations as a design tool, {{it is important that the}} simulations can predict the important flow features of ponds and tanks. Comparative studies were made using numerical and physical modelling in a large-scale model of a detention tank and a small-scale model of a storage tank. The flow pattern and residence time were analysed in the physical model of the detention tank using drogue tracking and impulse tracer tests. Sedimentation efficiency and distribution of sediment on the tank bottom were studied in the storage tank. Good agreement is found between measured and simulated flow patterns, residence time and particle removal for high inflow velocities. For low flow rates, difficulties were encountered in both the measurements and the simulations. Simulations show that an island placed in <b>front</b> of the <b>inlet,</b> so that the influent water hits the island perpendicularly, is most efficient for avoiding short-circuiting currents and extending the residence time in a rectangularly shaped pond. A subsurface berm placed in <b>front</b> of the <b>inlet</b> does not have the same impacts on short-circuiting. Moving the inlet so that only one circulation is created in the tank, extends the time needed for the initial tracer to reach the outlet, but the effective volume decreases. Denser influent water may change the flow pattern and decrease the effective volume. The suggested bed shear stress boundary condition for particle contact with the bottom is simple but gives reasonable results and can be used to estimate removal efficiencies and possible location of sediment...|$|R

The scope {{of this study was}} to investigate the general characteristics of the inlet buzz under various design and off-design conditions. The model was equipped with accurate and high frequency pressure sensors and the tests were conducted at Mach numbers varying from 1. 8 to 2. 5, at various angles of attack, and at different mass flow rates. Shadowgraph flow visualization, together with a high speed camera, was used to capture the external shock structure in <b>front</b> of the <b>inlet.</b> Frequencies of buzz were obtained from both the shadowgraph pictures and analysis of the pressure data. The amplitude of the shock wave motion was measured from the visualization pictures, too. The results show that for low mass flow rates, buzz frequency is almost independent of Mach number, while at a higher mass flow rate, the frequency of the shock oscillation increases with Mach number. Further, for each free stream Mach number, as the mass flow rate decreased, the amplitude of the shock movement grew, but its frequency decreased...|$|R
40|$|The {{pressure}} relief valve is a basic component in every hydraulic system. Its function is to limit maximal pressure in the system independently of the flow across the valve.

5000|$|In {{the early}} years of operation, the analog {{computers}} would not always keep up with rapidly changing flight environmental inputs. If internal pressures became too great and the spike was incorrectly positioned, the shock wave would suddenly blow out the <b>front</b> of the <b>inlet,</b> called an [...] "Inlet Unstart". During unstarts afterburner extinctions were common. The remaining engine's asymmetrical thrust would cause the aircraft to yaw violently to one side. SAS, autopilot, and manual control inputs would fight the yawing, but often the extreme off-angle would reduce airflow in the opposite engine and stimulate [...] "sympathetic stalls". This generated a rapid counter-yawing, often coupled with loud [...] "banging" [...] noises, and a rough ride during which crews' helmets would sometimes strike their cockpit canopies. One response to a single unstart was unstarting both inlets to prevent yawing, then restarting them both. Lockheed later installed an electronic control to detect unstart conditions and perform this reset action without pilot intervention. Beginning in 1980, the analog inlet control system was replaced by a digital system, which reduced unstart instances.|$|R
5000|$|The air inlets {{allowed the}} SR-71 to cruise at over Mach 3.2 while keeping airflow into the engines {{at the initial}} subsonic speeds. Mach 3.2 was the design point for the aircraft, its most {{efficient}} speed. At the <b>front</b> of each <b>inlet,</b> a pointed, movable cone called a [...] "spike" [...] (Inlet cone) was locked in its full forward position {{on the ground and}} during subsonic flight. When the aircraft accelerated past Mach 1.6, an internal jackscrew moved the spike up to 26 in inwards, directed by an analog air inlet computer that took into account pitot-static system, pitch, roll, yaw, and angle of attack. Moving the spike tip drew the shock wave riding on it closer to the inlet cowling until it touched just slightly inside the cowling lip. This position reflected the spike shock-wave repeatedly between the spike centerbody and the inlet inner cowl sides, and minimized airflow spillage which is the cause of spillage drag. The air slowed supersonically with a final plane shock wave at entry to the subsonic diffuser.|$|R

Using a stock F.2/2, MV added a separate module to the rear of the engine (directly behind the HP turbine) which comprised contra-rotating LP turbines attached to two contra-rotating fans. Apart from the first stage nozzle guide vanes, the LP turbine was completely statorless, with four consecutive rotor stages. Rotors 1 and 3 drove the front fan clockwise (viewed from front), whereas the rear fan was driven anticlockwise by rotors 2 and 4.

40|$|Passenger comfort {{becomes more}} and more {{important}} in the automotive industries. Thus it is necessary to investigate the ventilation concepts realized in automotives e. g. inlet flows or interactions between the inlet-flow and linings. The here presented investigations aimed at the determination of the flow field between the left <b>front</b> air <b>inlet</b> and the left sidewindow of a mini-van by solving the Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes Equation and the validation of these predictions comparison the predictions with flow field measurements. Therefore experimental and numerical investigations for a fixed flow-rate and 4 different inlet configurations were carried out at the facilities of the DLR in Göttingen. The configuration of the mini-van consists of standard interiours with carpets, instrument panels, and linings but without seats and passenger (dummies) for both numerical and experimental investigations. The calculations have been performed using the CFD codes of STAR-CD with the second-order differencing schemes MARS (monotone advection and reconstruction scheme) and CD (for density only) solving the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations with various turbulent models and different meshing strategies. The differences of the predicted flow fields have been analysed in order to choose approach suited for such simulations. For a non-intrusive determination of the velocity components of the instantaneous flow-field the particle image velocimetry (PIV) technique in a 2 C- 2 D setup was employed. To illuminate the tracer particles a Nd:YaG Laser has been used. Imaging of the scattered light from the tracer particles was performed using a high-resolution CCD-Kamera with a frame grabbing rate of 0. 5 Hz. For any of the four inlet configurations 1000 image-pairs have been recorded. Experimental and numerical results show the interaction of the inflow-jet with the B-pillar of the respective side window for different inlet configuration. A quantitative comparison between numerical and experimental data in terms of the normalized differential vector (U_exp - U_cfd) /U_mean shows a good agreement in general, though a superior agreement if the experimental and numerical results was achieved if the k-omega LowRe turbulence model was used in the simulations. ...|$|R
40|$|As {{there are}} no {{detailed}} guidelines on how to design culverts including sediments and debris, a laboratory model was made to find solutions to how sediments deposit {{in front of the}} culvert and how this affects the capacity. The model consisted of a collecting reservoir, receiving the water from the pumps. From the reservoir an approach channel led the water down to a basin, and further through the culvert. The main focus was to create a test program with variation of different effects, including the inlet shape, basin length, slope of the approach channel, how the sediments were added and the size and amount of the sediments. From these effects, performance curves were established to find the influence on the capacity, and when the water level overtopped the filling. The results from the experiments did not give an absolute solution to how the sedimentation problems should be solved, but good upstream geometries {{to reduce the risk of}} overtopping was found. At different discharges, the inlet shape was found to be the most influencing effect on the capacity. The inlet with wingwalls turned out to be the most reliable shape, with stable flow conditions and high amounts of water transport through the barrel. When the inlet was cut, the water flow was often unstable and oscillated, which resulted in the lowest culvert capacity. The basin length effect also showed a significant influence on the capacity, where the shortest length was better than the longer lengths. Additionally, the slope was found to give higher capacities when it was 1 : 5 compared to 1 : 9. When sediments were added to the basin, both gradually and all at once (as a landslide), the curves showed a tendency of an increased capacity. This result does not coincide with previous knowledge on the subject, and it was assumed that the influence of debris in combination with sediments is an important factor in culvert blockage. However, the sediment deposition was strongly influenced by the culvert capacity, hence the inlet shape and basin geometry. For the inlets and geometries that gave low capacities, the amount deposited in the basin was high and the sediments tended to accumulate in <b>front</b> of the <b>inlet.</b> For projects with similar water and sediment behavior as given in the performance curves, the curves can be very helpful in reducing the risk of overtopping. However, documentation of the sediment transport is necessary for establishment of the sediment deposition in the basin and in <b>front</b> of the <b>inlet.</b> A clean culvert and sediment-free area around the inlet is as important as a functioning inlet and basin geometry when hindering overtopping of road or railway fillings. </p...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis study {{analyzed}} the temporal variability of phytoplankton assemblages {{in the surface}} waters of Guanabara Bay (RJ, Brazil), at six stations in <b>front</b> of Icaraí <b>Inlet</b> from April/ 2011 to April/ 2012. Our results highlight the great contribution of diatoms, dinoflagellates and cyanobacteria, represented by 111 taxa typical of estuarine and coastal areas. The coexistence of benthic and planktonic species suggests considerable hydrodinamism in these waters. All variables were homogeneous (p > 0. 05) between the stations, but differed between sampling periods. On average, phytoplankton abundance (107 cells. L- 1) was {{higher than that of}} other estuaries and its temporal behavior was closely correlated (p < 0. 01) with diatoms and cyanobacteria. The richness distribution pattern (7 to 27 taxa) was closely correlated (p < 0. 01) with dinoflagellates and diatoms. Ninety per cent of all samples presented a low diversity index (< 2. 0 bits. cell- 1), which indicated the unstable balance of the system, typical of environments subjected to eutrophication. The population structure analysis revealed that 10 % of all taxa were resident, 12 % visitors and 78 % accidental, suggesting the influence of continental and oceanic water influxes. Between the "typical" taxa, the most common were the cyanobacteria of the order Oscillatoriales, the diatoms Ceratoneis closterium (=Cylindrotheca closterium) and Leptocylindrus minimus and the dinoflagellate Prorocentrum triestinum...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{key factors}} in {{designing}} free water-surface constructed wetlands (FWS CW) is the hydraulic efficiency (λ), which depends primarily on the retention time of the polluted storm water. Increasing the hydraulic retention time (HRT) at various flow levels will increase λ of the overall constructed wetland (CW). The effects of characteristic geometric features that increase HRT were explored {{through the use of}} a two-dimensional depth-average hydrodynamic model. This numerical model was developed to solve the equations of continuity and motions on an unstructured triangular mesh using the Galerkin finite volume formulation and equations of the k–ε turbulence model. Eighty-nine diverse forms of artificial FWS CW with 11 different aspect ratios were numerically simulated and subsequently analysed for four scenarios: rectangular CW, modified rectangular CW with rounded edges, different inlet/outlet configurations of CW, and surface and submerged obstructions in <b>front</b> of the <b>inlet</b> part of the CW. Results from the simulations showed that increasing the aspect ratio has a direct influence on the enhancement of λ in all cases. However, the aspect ratio should be at least 9 in order to achieve an appropriate rate for λ in rectangular CW. Modified rounded rectangular CW improved λ by up to 23 %, which allowed for the selection of a reduced aspect ratio. Simulation results showed that CW with low aspect ratios benefited from obstructions and optimized inlet/outlet configurations in terms of improved HRT...|$|R
