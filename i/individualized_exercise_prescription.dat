40|$|AbstractObjectiveResearch on {{preoperative}} <b>individualized</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>prescription</b> (PIEP) {{for heart}} surgery patients in Taiwan is lacking. Thus, {{the purpose of}} this study was to examine the feasibility of a PIEP in the Taiwanese population. MethodA quasi-experimental design, using purposive sampling, was conducted. Thirty-five patients were recruited, of whom 15 chose to participate in the experimental (PIEP training plus usual care) group, and 20 chose to participate in the control (usual care) group. The effects of the intervention were determined by pulmonary complication-related parameters and quality of life. Results and conclusionThe development and process of PIEPs suitable for cardiac patients was described in this study. The results reveal that the two-week exercise-training program contributed to a decreased peak respiratory exchange ratio (RER) after the surgery and earlier ambulation. The effectiveness of PIEPs in improving the quality of life in cardiac surgery patients was validated. This study may also contribute as a reference of the PIEP effect on patients to the healthcare providers...|$|E
40|$|Depression is a {{significant}} problem for Canadians, as is the declining overall health of adults due to sedentary lifestyles. The purpose of this integrative literature review is to examine how nurse practitioners, providing primary health care in Canada, can facilitate adherence to physical activity for adults with mild to moderate depression. Background knowledge of depression, physical activity and adherence is presented along with an overview of primary health care. A Medline search collected 15 research articles for analysis. Key findings included reduced adherence to exercise for adults with depression, positive effects on mood from moderate intensity exercise, health promotion challenges within primary care, and interdisciplinary approaches to improving adherence. Recommendations are presented using the 5 A's approach and include the application of psychological theories, assessment of readiness for exercise, <b>individualized</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>prescription</b> targeting public health guidelines, enlisting social supports, frequent follow-up, along with additional education to practitioners.

40|$|Abstract—The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop a com-puterized {{exercise}} expert system (CEES) that creates tailored exercise plans for older adults. A panel of experts was selected in the areas of medicine, exercise physiology, health promo-tion, exercise psychology, and gerontology. The experts com-municated with the principal investigator and the project members by mail, email, telephone, and expert meetings. A two-day workshop was held during the second year for the pro-ject members as well as local and national experts to review the CEES. The CEES demonstrated adequate inter-rater reliability (0. 80) and criterion validity (0. 70). Content validity was achieved by literature review and expert opinion. The CEES gathers information on the elder’s health status, clinical fac-tors, and exercise determinants that characterize specific barri-ers or incentives to exercise.

40|$|The care of {{the active}} angina patient {{comprises}} risk stratification, risk factor modification, cardiac rehabilita-tion and pharmacotherapy. Risk stratification may be undertaken using a symptom-limited exercise test, {{with the possibility of}} myocardial perfusion imaging to im-prove sensitivity. Higher-risk patients may be evaluated angiographically. Risk factor modification should be tailored to the individual patient and should include weight reduction, cessation of smoking, treatment of hy-pertension and a controlled increase in levels of exercise for the sedentary patient. Cardiac rehabilitation is com-prised of patient education, risk factor management and an <b>individualized</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>prescription,</b> based on a symptom-limited exercise tolerance test. Exercise training is associated with measurable physiological improvements in exercise tolerance. The risk of myocardial infarction due to sudden bouts of heavy exertion is also reduced, by approximately 50 -fold, in those who exercise regularly. Pharmacological management should be based on the patient's anginal threshold. Those with a high threshold may be treated symptomatically with nitroglycerin, while /?-blockers may be the most appropriate therapy for those with a lower threshold. Those with a variable threshold may respond better to calcium channel blockers. Long-acting agents are preferred, ideally providing therapeutic coverage in the morning, and throughout the day, until the next daily dose reaches therapeutic levels...|$|E
40|$|To {{assess the}} safety of home {{exercise}} soon after open-heart surgery, 19 pts. (mean age 55. 7) underwent home exercise 14 to 9 % weeks postsurgery. <b>Individualized</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>prescription</b> heart rates and intensities were determined from a prehospital discharge submaximal exercise evaluation. Pts. performed exercise sessions daily for 8 weeks. During the first 2 week interval, pts. used heart rate monitors to transmit electrocardiograms via telephone on 5 separate days. To reevaluate the exercise prescription at 2 and 4 weeks, pts. subjectively reproduced the heart rate {{and the intensity of}} the previous exercise prescription followed by a submaximal exercise evaluation. At 8 weeks pts. performed a symptom-limited maximal exercise evaluation. For the first 2 week interval, the results indicated 1) there was no significant change in the incidence of arrhythmias in patients at rest and during home exercise, 2) the results of the predischarge exercise evaluation were consistent with the findings of the transtelephone electrocardiography heart rate and rhythm checks, 3) the heart rate responses were within the limits of the exercise prescription given to the patients, and 4) the pts., when given an exercise prescription in conjunction with the teaching of self-monitoring techniques and appropriate intensity adjustments, were able to appropriately monitor their own home exercise prescription. These findings reflect that structured and individualized home exercise beginning as soon as 10 days post open-heart surgery appears to be safe during the critical first 2 weeks. The safety may be augmented by transtelephone electrocardiography monitoring...|$|E
40|$|Background: In {{addition}} to the hallmark cognitive and functional impairments mounting evidence indicates that schizophrenia is also {{associated with an increased}} risk for the development of secondary complications, in particular cardio-metabolic disease. This is thought {{to be the result of}} various factors including physical inactivity and the metabolic side effects of psychotropic medications. Therefore, non-pharmacological approaches to improving brain health, physical health, and overall well-being have been promoted increasingly. Methods: We report on the health-related physical fitness (body composition, blood pressure, heart rate, and aerobic fitness) and lipid profile of persons living with schizophrenia and effective means to address the challenges of exercise training in this population. Results: There was a markedly increased risk for cardio-metabolic disease in 13 persons living with schizophrenia (Age = 31 ± 7 years) including low aerobic fitness (76 % ± 34 % of predicted), reduced HDL (60 % of cohort), elevated resting heart rate (80 % of cohort), hypertension (40 % of cohort), overweight and obesity (69 % of cohort), and abdominal obesity (54 % of cohort). <b>Individualized</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>prescription</b> (3 times/week) was well tolerated, with no incidence of adverse exercise-related events. The exercise adherence rate was 81 % ± 21 % (Range 48 %– 100 %), and 69 % of the participants were able to complete the entire exercise training program. Exercise training resulted in clinically important changes in physical activity, aerobic fitness, exercise tolerance, blood pressure, and body composition. Conclusion: Persons living with schizophrenia appear to be at an increased risk for cardio-metabolic disease. An individualized exercise program has shown early promise for the treatment of schizophrenia and the various cognitive, functional, and physiological impairments that ultimately affect health and well-being...|$|E

The study included 45 male cancer survivors that were referred by local oncologists. Following a comprehensive screening and physical exami-nation, cardiovascular endurance, pulmonary function, and fatigue were assessed leading {{to the development of}} 12 -week <b>individualized</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>prescriptions</b> and <b>exercise</b> interventions. The cancer survivors were divided into during treatment (DTm) and following treatment (FTm) groups. Repeated-measures analysis of variance and analy-ses of covariance were used to compare pre- versus postin-tervention and between groups. Cardiopulmonary function was maintained in the DTm, whereas the FTm showed sig-nificant reductions in resting heart rate (P <. 05) with con-current increases in predicted VO 2 max and time on treadmill (P <. 05) postexercise intervention. Fatigue levels did not increase in the DTm group, whereas the FTm group showed significant reductions in behavioral fatigue, affec-tive fatigue, sensory fatigue, cognitive/mood fatigue, and total fatigue (P <. 05) after the exercise intervention. The results of the current study suggest that moderate intensity, <b>individualized,</b> prescriptive <b>exercise</b> intervention maintains or improves cardiovascular and pulmonary function with concomitant reductions in fatigue in cancer survivors dur-ing and following cancer treatment.

The authors evaluated an assessment instrument that incorporates results of multiple categories of impairment, including strength, balance, gait, vision, and cognitive function. The physical therapist made judgments on the relative impact of 9 different impairments on specific exercises and on the total impact of all impairments on particular exercises. In a cohort age 75 – 85 y, functional limitations, impaired balance, pain, and low physical endurance were estimated to have the largest impact {{on the ability to}} carry out exercise activities, primarily walking, stair climbing, balance exercises, and stationary bicycling.

Purpose: The {{purpose of}} the project was to examine changes in {{physical}} activity, self-efficacy, and program satisfaction for participants of the EIM Referral Program. Methods: As part of the EIM referral Program at Slippery Rock University, students utilizing the Student Health Center were screened by a nurse practitioner for a “sixth vital sign”, which was reported as frequency and duration of physical activity (PA) per week. Students reporting fewer than 150 minutes of PA per week were eligible for referral to a senior Exercise Science Intern. At the beginning of the program, the Exercise Science Intern provided participants with motivational interviewing and coaching to create goals and initiate behavior change. Participants completed pre and post fitness assessments and six weeks of <b>individualized</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>prescription,</b> meeting with the Exercise Science Intern twice per week. At the end of the program, participants completed a confidential program evaluation. Results: Twenty participants (age = 24. 55 + 12. 61; 4 males, 16 females) who had no regular exercise program completed the intervention. Two non-traditional participants referred through their physician were included in the data. There was 85 % program compliance among participants within the six week timeframe. One hundred percent of participants reported feeling more confident about exercising regularly, and 100 % reported having a plan in place to continue to exercise. Conclusion: Based on the results, the exercise intervention through the EIM Referral Program at Slippery Rock University was successful to increase physical activity levels and self-efficacy.

40|$|Relationship {{between the}} {{kinetics}} and kinematics of a unilateral horizontal drop jump to sprint performance. J Strength Cond Res 22 (5) : 1589 - 1596, 2008 -The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate the relationship between the kinematics and kinetics of a single-leg horizontal drop jump (SLDJ) to sprint performance. Twenty regional-level male team-sport athletes gave informed consent to participate in this study. All subjects performed a series of 25 -m sprints (measured by dual-beam infrared timing lights) and SLDJ (with both legs) in randomized block order during the same testing session. The SLDJ required the subjects to step downwards off a 20 -cm box, land on the force plate (operating at 500 Hz) with the specified foot, and jump for maximal horizontal distance while minimizing ground-contact time. Jump distance, particularly when normalized to a subject 2 ̆ 7 s height, was the strongest correlate to sprinting time for all three (5, 10, and 25 m) distances (- 0. 44 3 ̆c r 3 ̆c - 0. 65). Multiple linear regression analyses indicated that the SLDJ could account for a high level of variance in sprint time (0. 49 3 ̆c r 2 3 ̆c 0. 68) and that these predictions had a relatively low standard error of estimate (0. 02 - 0. 10 seconds). These results further support the contention that jump (particularly horizontal) and sprint ability for short distances are highly related. Whereas practitioners should consider using more horizontal than vertical jumps in the training and testing of most team-sport athletes, additional research into the kinetic determinants of jumping and sprinting may allow a more specific and <b>individualized</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>prescription</b> for improving certain aspects of sprinting such as step length or step rate or the vertical vs. horizontal contributions to propulsion...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background: Exercise-based cardiac {{rehabilitation}} {{tends to}} reduce mortality. However, it requires medium/long-term adherence to regular physical exercise. It {{is relevant to}} identify the variables that affect adherence to an supervised exercise program (SEP). Objective: To evaluate the influence of pre-participation levels of aerobic and non-aerobic physical fitness components in medium-term adherence to SEP. Methods: A total of 567 SEP participants (65 ± 12 years) (68 % men) were studied. Participants adherent to the program for less than 6 months (48 %) (non-adherent - NAD) were compared with 52 % of participants who were adherent for 6 months or more (adherents - AD). In the non-aerobic fitness, flexibility (FLX) (Flexitest) and muscle power (MPW) /body weight in standing rowing (watts/kg) were evaluated while aerobic fitness was obtained by direct measure of VO 2 max/body weight (VO 2). These measurements were normatized for sex and age based on percentiles (P) (P-FLX/P-MPW) of reference data or percentages of predicted (P-VO 2). Additionally, AD and NAD with extreme results (tertiles) were simultaneously compared for the three variables. Results: There {{was no difference between}} AD and NAD for non-aerobic results, in median [P 25 -P 75], P-FLX: 30 [13 - 56] and 31 [9 - 52], respectively, (p = 0. 69) and P-MPW: 34 [17 - 58] and 36 [16 - 62], respectively (p = 0. 96), and for aerobic results (mean ± standard error) P-VO 2 (75. 9 ± 1. 3 % and 75. 0 ± 1. 3 %, respectively) (p = 0. 83). When comparing extreme tertiles, a difference was found for P-MPW in the lower tertile only, with a slight advantage of AD over NAD- 9 [5 - 16] versus 4 [1 - 11] (p = 0. 04).

40|$|AbstractThe {{dose-response}} {{effects of}} exercise in reduced gravity on musculoskeletal health {{have not been}} well documented. It is not known whether or not <b>individualized</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>prescriptions</b> can be effective in preventing the substantial loss in bone mineral density and muscle function that have been observed in space flight and in bed rest. In this study, typical daily loads to the lower extremities were quantified in free-living subjects who were then randomly assigned to control or exercise groups. Subjects were confined to 6 -degree head-down bed rest for 84 days. The exercise group performed individually prescribed 1 g loaded locomotor exercise to replace their free-living daily load. Eleven subjects (5 exercise, 6 control) completed the protocol. Volumetric bone mineral density results from quantitative computed tomography demonstrated that control subjects lost significant amounts of bone in the intertrochanteric and total hip regions (p 0. 0125). Pre-and post-bed rest muscle volumes were calculated from analysis of magnetic resonance imaging data. The exercise group retained {{a larger percentage of}} their total quadriceps and gastrocnemius muscle volume (− 7. 2 %± 5. 9, − 13. 8 %± 6. 1, respectively) than their control counterparts (− 23. 3 %± 5. 9, − 33. 0 ± 8. 2, respectively; p 0. 05). The decline in VO 2 max was 17 %± 18 in exercising subjects (p 0. 05). In summary, the decline in a number of important measures of musculoskeletal and cardiovascular health was attenuated but not eliminated by a subject-specific program of locomotor exercise designed to replace daily load accumulated during free living. We conclude that single daily bouts of exposure to locomotor exercise can play a role in a countermeasures program during bed rest, and perhaps space flight, but are not sufficient in their own right to ensure musculoskeletal or cardiovascular health...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Chronic {{low back}} pain (CLBP) is a {{persistent}} disabling condition with rising significant healthcare, social and economic costs. Current research supports the use of exercise-based treatment approaches that encourage people with CLBP to assume a physically active role in their recovery. While international clinical guidelines and systematic reviews for CLBP support supervised group exercise as an attractive first-line option for treating large numbers of CLBP patients at low cost, barriers to their delivery include space and time restrictions in healthcare settings and poor patient attendance. The European Clinical Guidelines have identified the need for research {{in the use of}} brief/minimal contact self-activation interventions that encourage participation in physical activity for CLBP. Walking may be an ideally suited form of <b>individualized</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>prescription</b> as it is easy to do, requires no special skills or facilities, and is achievable by virtually all ages with little risk of injury, but its effectiveness for LBP is unproven. Methods and design This study will be an assessor-blinded randomized controlled trial that will investigate the difference in clinical effectiveness and costs of an individualized walking programme and a supervised general exercise programme compared to usual physiotherapy, which will act as the control group, in people with chronic {{low back pain}}. A sample of 246 patients will be recruited in Dublin, Ireland through acute general hospital outpatient physiotherapy departments that provide treatment for people with CLBP. Patients will be randomly allocated to one of the three groups in a concealed manner. The main outcomes will be functional disability, pain, quality of life, fear avoidance, back beliefs, physical activity, satisfaction and costs, which will be evaluated at baseline, and 3, 6 and 12 months [follow-up by pre-paid postage]. Qualitative telephone interviews and focus groups will be embedded in the research design to obtain feedback about participants' experiences of the interventions and trial participation, and to inform interpretation of the quantitative data.

Participants (n= 12; 3 male; aged 56. 9 &# 177; 7. 0 y) reported to the laboratory for assessment of MetS risk factors and fitness (VO 2 max) at baseline (V 0) and after eight-weeks (V 2) of intervention. Participants received an <b>individualized</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>prescription</b> and a mHealth technology kit for remote monitoring of blood pressure (BP), blood glucose, physical activity and body weight via smartphone. Participants underwent 24 -h ambulatory monitoring of R-R intervals following V 0 and V 2. Low and high frequency powers of HRV were assessed from the recording and the ratio of low-to-high frequency powers and low and high frequency power in normalized units were calculated. One-way repeated measures analysis of variance showed that waist circumference (V 0 : 113. 1 &# 177; 11. 0 cm, V 2 : 108. 1 &# 177; 14. 7 cm; p= 0. 004) and diastolic BP (V 0 : 81 &# 177; 6 mmHg, V 2 : 76 &# 177; 11 mmHg; p= 0. 04) were reduced and VO 2 max increased (V 0 : 31. 3 ml/kg/min, V 2 : 34. 8 ml/kg/min; p= 0. 02) with no changes in other MetS risk factors. Low and high frequency powers in normalized units were reduced (V 0 : 75. 5 &# 177; 12. 0, V 2 : 72. 0 &# 177; 12. 1; p= 0. 03) and increased (V 0 : 24. 5 &# 177; 12. 0, V 2 : 28. 0 &# 177; 12. 1; p= 0. 03), respectively, with no other changes in HRV.

Method: 37 overweight and obese adolescents (13 - 16 old), volunteers participated in the fully closed weight-loss exercises. They were randomly {{divided into two groups}} as the normal oxygen group (n= 19) and hypoxia group (n= 18) and exercised an intervention for four-weeks. For the normal oxygen group, aerobic exercises and diet control intervention methods were used. Exercise intensity and <b>individualized</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>prescription</b> were based upon subject health condition and exercise tolerance test. Dieticians according to subject basal metabolic rate formulated a reasonable diet to ensure the calories and essential nutrient supply. For the hypoxia group, except aerobic exercise and diet control intervention, every night the subjects lived in hypoxic room equipped with hypoxia systems and they were exposed to an altitude of about 2, 700 m (10 hours per day) for 4 weeks. Before and after hypoxic exposure, obesity related morphological and blood biochemical indices (blood glucose, blood lipid panel (includes 4 main lipoproteins,etc)) were separately analyzed, calculate homeostasis model assessment was used to estimate insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and insulin secretion (HOMA-β) index. Results: (1) After hypoxia intervention, morphological indices, immunology indices, blood insulin and blood fat in average significantly decreased in both groups; Moreover blood glucose did not change significantly. In normal oxygen group and hypoxia group,HOMA-IR and HOMA-β index significantly decreased. (2) Hypoxia combined with exercise and alimentary control have different effects on male/female obese adolescent’s morphological indices and glucose/lipid metabolism that were shown by: 1. Male in hypoxia group showed weight, BMI and body fat significantly decreased more than normal oxygen group, the two groups lean body mass did not change significantly. Moreover, female in hypoxia group showed lean body mass significantly decreased more than normal oxygen group, the two group’s weight, BMI and body fat did not change significantly. 2. Between the two groups, for male subjects HOMA-IR and HOMA-β index did not change significantly; in hypoxia group, for female subjects HOMA-β index decreased, but there was an upward trend in normal oxygen group, the two groups change significantly. Conclusion: (1) The two interventions methods can significantly improve the obese adolescent’s morphological and glucose/lipid metabolism indices. (2) The effects of the two interventions methods on morphological and glucose/lipid metabolism indices are due to gender differences, it should be used selectively based on the current situation...|$|E

DESIGN: Controlled clinical study. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-seven outpatients enrolled in a rehabilitation programme after an acute coronary syndrome. SETTING: Cardiac rehabilitation unit. Interventions: Three groups: (A) : moderate intensity continuous exercise (MICE) at 70 % of the maximal HR of the graded maximal exercise test (n[*]=[*] 10); (B) : MICE at the maximal 6 MWT HR (n[*]=[*] 8); (C) : high intensity interval training (HIIT) based on the 6 MWT and the 200 -mFWT maximal HR (n[*]=[*] 9). Group B and C performed walk tests every 2 weeks, to readjust training HR (THR) if needed. MEASURES: 6 MWT and 200 -mFWT performances, peak VO(2) and peak power (Pmax). RESULTS: 6 MWT and 200 -mFWT performances improved significantly and similarly in all groups (P[*]<[*] 0. 05). Peak VO(2) improved significantly in all groups (P[*]<[*] 0. 05), this improvement being higher in group C (HIIT) versus A (P[*]<[*] 0. 05). Group B was closer to the recommended THR during exercise sessions compared to group A. CONCLUSION: This pilot study showed that using the 6 MWT and 200 -mFWT HR to individualize MICE or HIIT prescription is feasible in CAD patients, and could lead them closer to THR objective, to similar improvements in walking performance, and greater peak VO(2) increase for HIIT.

Our study sought to determine the feasibility of an oncology rehabilitation exercise program embedded within a cardiac rehabilitation program. Methods: Patients who rated their fatigue > 4 / 10 after completion of adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer were screened for eligibility and the outcomes were assessed (Piper Fatigue Scale, Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast [FACT-B], Edmonton Symptom Assessment System, body composition, stress test, and physical activity measurement [accelerometer]). Participants received <b>individualized</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>prescription.</b> Following the 16 -week program, repeat assessment plus patient acceptance and satisfaction survey was completed. The primary end point was the composite of accrual rate > 25 %, program adherence > 80 %, and mean compliance with accelerometer use > 80 %. Results: Twenty of 24 screened patients consented to the study and completed the baseline assessment. Adherence was 30. 3 %. Mean accelerometer use was 3. 88 / 7 days (78 %). Fatigue at baseline was rated at 4. 82 / 10, and at 3. 59 (p = 0. 09) after the intervention. Overall well-being (FACT-B) score changed from 92. 7 to 98. 3 (p = 0. 05). There were no significant changes in body composition (except for bone mineral content), aerobic exercise capacity, or activity patterns. Conclusion: Although the primary outcome was not met, our study indicates that an oncology exercise rehabilitation program {{can be incorporated into}} an existing cardiac rehabilitation program. Based on feedback received, we propose that in order to achieve exercise goals, frequent, encouraging, and tailored feedback and group sessions to foster a sense of community may additionally be needed to strengthen adherence to a prescribed exercise program.

40|$|In October of 1992 I {{submitted}} {{an abstract}} to the American College of Sports Medicine, co-authored with Dr. Schork and Dr. Edington from the University of Michigan, to present our {{study at the}} 1993 Annual Meeting. A few weeks later I received Volume 24, issue 10 of Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise, where Whaley and colleagues had published a similar paper. Discouraged by the bad timing, I never tried to publish my own paper. Several years later, other similar papers have been published, arguing for a correction to the conventional 220 -age formula for maximum heart rate. I realized I should have tried to publish my paper back in 1993 ! I have dug out the original poster presentation materials, scanned them, and prepared this document {{for the sake of}} teaching my students (who often quote Tanaka et al. and Gellish et al.) the importance of prompt publication of their work. The {{purpose of this study was}} to develop a regression model to predict maximum heart rate (HRmax) from basic sociodemographic variables and to compare it with the 220 -age rule of thumb. Data were obtained from 635 adults of all ages, gender, and physical activity levels, rigorously tested for maximum aerobic capacity. HRmax was found to be significantly correlated (p<. 05) to age, tobacco use in the past, current tobacco use, and self-reported physical activity. There was no evidence of a difference in HRmax between males and females (p=. 997). Several significant (p<. 00005) linear regression models involving these variables were developed, but their ability to explain the variation in HRmax was only slightly better than a model that relied on age alone. Based on R 2 values, the age model was able to account for 44. 9 % of the variation in HRmax, compared to 48 % when using the most complicated model. The 220 -age rule of thumb also gave an r 2 =. 449 (44. 9 %), but the average estimate was biased (- 8 beats per minute [b * min~l]). Individual estimates were highly inaccurate: 50. 5 % of the predicted values were off by 10 b * min- 1 or more, compared to 27. 6 % with our simplest model based on age alone. Furthermore, both the 220 -age rule and our regression models were very poor predictors when applied to ten-year age subgroups. It was concluded that in spite of a significant correlation between HRmax and other variables, regression models based on these variables are highly inaccurate in the prediction of individual HRmax values. Therefore, the practice of relying on them for <b>individualized</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>prescription</b> and as a criterion for graded exercise test termination is not warranted.

40|$|The {{beneficial}} role {{of exercise}} in chronic disease management is well recognized, but {{the challenge of}} effective <b>exercise</b> <b>prescription</b> within primary care persists. Initiatives requesting clinicians to prescribe specific exercises to their patients has left two underlying questions: 1) Who is the most appropriate clinician to prescribe exercise to meet {{the unique needs of}} individuals living with more than one disease; 2) How does this clinician ensure appropriate and safe <b>exercise</b> <b>prescriptions</b> are provided? Three studies were completed to begin addressing the aforementioned questions. A nationally distributed survey compared exercise curricula between physiotherapy, nursing, and medical programs, while a systematic literature review showed overlapping physiological and subjective markers that clinicians may use to define safe exercises for individuals living with multiple chronic diseases. Finally a novel approach and a preliminary tool are presented to help guide how <b>exercise</b> <b>prescription</b> could be implemented in primary care. Findings suggest that PTs should lead the <b>exercise</b> <b>prescription</b> movement in primary care with nurses and physicians as exercise advisors or facilitators.

In this study, 34 nurses completed the Exercise in Mental Illness Questionnaire–Health Professionals Version (EMIQ-HP). This survey examined the frequencyof <b>exercise</b> <b>prescription</b> and the level of agreement with statements regarding barriers to <b>exercise</b> <b>prescription</b> for, and <b>exercise</b> participation by, people with mental illness. The level of agreement scores for statements for each section was summed,with a higher score indicating a higher level of agreement.
