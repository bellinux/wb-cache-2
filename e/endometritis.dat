25|$|Postpartum {{infection}} {{is one of}} the main causes of maternal death and may account for 10% of maternal deaths globally. Caesarean section greatly increases the risk of infection and associated morbidity (estimated to be between 5 and 20 times as high), and routine use of antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent infections is recommended. Infection can occur in around 8% of women who have caesareans, largely <b>endometritis,</b> urinary tract infections and wound infections. The use of preventative antibiotics in women undergoing cesarean section decreased wound infection, <b>endometritis,</b> and serious infectious complications by about 65%. Side effects and effect on the baby is unclear.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the danger}} of {{infection}} to humans, it is important to maintain the health of milk-producing cattle. Common ailments affecting dairy cows include infectious disease (e.g. mastitis, <b>endometritis</b> and digital dermatitis), metabolic disease (e.g. milk fever and ketosis) and injuries caused by their environment (e.g. hoof and hock lesions).|$|E
25|$|Salpingitis is an {{infection}} and inflammation in the Fallopian tubes. It {{is often used}} synonymously with pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), although PID lacks an accurate definition and can refer to several diseases of the female upper genital tract, such as <b>endometritis,</b> oophoritis, myometritis, parametritis and infection in the pelvic peritoneum.|$|E
25|$|Native Americans used {{black cohosh}} to treat {{gynecological}} and other disorders, including sore throat, kidney problems, and depression. Following {{the arrival of}} European settlers in the U.S. who continued the medicinal usage of black cohosh, the plant appeared in the U.S. Pharmacopoeia in 1830 under the name “black snakeroot”. In 1844 A. racemosa gained popularity when John King, an eclectic physician, used it to treat rheumatism and nervous disorders. Other eclectic physicians of the mid-nineteenth century used black cohosh {{for a variety of}} maladies, including <b>endometritis,</b> amenorrhea, dysmenorrhea, menorrhagia, sterility, severe after-birth pains, and for increased breast milk production.|$|E
25|$|Both {{have higher}} risks than a vaginal birth with no {{previous}} caesarean section. There are many issues {{which must be}} taken into account when planning the mode of delivery for every pregnancy, not just those complicated by a previous caesarean section and there is a list of some of these issues in the list of indications for section in the first part of this article. A vaginal birth after caesarean section (VBAC) confers a higher risk of uterine rupture (5 per 1,000), blood transfusion or <b>endometritis</b> (10 per 1,000), and perinatal death of the child (0.25 per 1,000). Furthermore, 20% to 40% of planned VBAC attempts end in caesarean section being needed, with greater risks of complications in an emergency repeat caesarean section than in an elective repeat caesarean section. On the other hand, VBAC confers less maternal morbidity and a decreased risk of complications in future pregnancies than elective repeat caesarean section.|$|E
500|$|Laparoscopy is {{infrequently}} used {{to diagnose}} {{pelvic inflammatory disease}} since it is not readily available. [...] Moreover, it might not detect subtle inflammation of the fallopian tubes, and it fails to detect <b>endometritis.</b> [...] Nevertheless, laparoscopy is conducted if the diagnosis is not certain or if the person has not responded to antibiotic therapy after 48 hours.|$|E
500|$|N. {{gonorrhoea}} and C. trachomatis are {{the most}} common organisms. The least common were infections caused exclusively by anaerobes and facultative organisms. Anaerobes and facultative bacteria were also isolated from 50 percent of the patients from whom Chlamydia and Neisseria were recovered; thus, anaerobes and facultative bacteria were present in the upper genital tract of nearly two-thirds of the PID patients. PCR and serological tests have associated extremely fastidious organism with <b>endometritis,</b> PID, and tubal factor infertility. [...] Microorganisms associated with PID are listed below.|$|E
2500|$|Sociodemographic {{factors such}} as age, access to {{resources}} and income level are significant indicators of maternal outcomes.

2500|$|Pregnant {{women with}} BV {{have a higher}} risk of chorioamnionitis, miscarriage, preterm birth, [...] {{premature}} rupture of membranes, and postpartum <b>endometritis.</b> [...] BV is associated with gynecological and obstetric complications. Data suggest an association between BV, tubal factor infertility, and pelvic inflammatory disease. Women with BV who are treated with in vitro fertilization have a lower implantation rate and higher rates of early pregnancy loss.|$|E
2500|$|After birth, a foal's navel is {{dipped in}} {{antiseptic}} to prevent infection, {{it is sometimes}} given an enema to help clear the meconium from its digestive tract, and the newborn is monitored {{to ensure that it}} stands and nurses without difficulty. [...] While most horse births happen without complications, many owners have first aid supplies prepared and a veterinarian on call in case of a birthing emergency. [...] People who supervise foaling should also watch the mare to be sure that she passes the placenta in a timely fashion, and that it is complete with no fragments remaining in the uterus, where retained fetal membranes could cause a serious inflammatory condition (<b>endometritis)</b> and/or infection. [...] If the placenta is not removed from the stall after it is passed, a mare will often eat it, an instinct from the wild, where blood would attract predators.|$|E
50|$|Pathologists have {{traditionally}} classified <b>endometritis</b> as either acute or chronic: acute <b>endometritis</b> {{is characterized by}} the presence of microabscesses or neutrophils within the endometrial glands, while chronic <b>endometritis</b> is distinguished by variable numbers of plasma cells within the endometrial stroma. The most common cause of <b>endometritis</b> is infection. Symptoms include lower abdominal pain, fever and abnormal vaginal bleeding or discharge. Caesarean section, prolonged rupture of membranes and long labor with multiple vaginal examinations are important risk factors. Treatment is usually with broad-spectrum antibiotics.|$|E
50|$|Subclinical <b>endometritis</b> is {{characterized}} by inflammation of the endometrium {{and the presence of}} neutrophils in cytology or biopsy histology, in the absence of signs of clinical <b>endometritis.</b>|$|E
50|$|Acute <b>Endometritis</b> is {{characterized}} by infection. The organisms most often isolated {{are believed to be}} because of compromised abortions, delivery, medical instrumentation, and retention of placental fragments. There is not enough evidence for the use of prophylactic antibiotics to prevent <b>endometritis</b> after manual removal of placental in vaginal birth. Histologically, neutrophilic infiltration of the endometrial tissue is present during acute <b>endometritis.</b> The clinical presentation is typically high fever and purulent vaginal discharge. Menstruation after acute <b>endometritis</b> is excessive and in uncomplicated cases can resolve after 2 weeks of clindamycin and gentamicin IV antibiotic treatment.|$|E
