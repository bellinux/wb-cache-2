40|$|Recent {{evidence}} suggests that a network of brain areas {{may be involved in}} visually guided walking. Here we study patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) who experience ‘freezing’ behaviour to investigate the visual control of locomotion {{and the role of the}} basal ganglia in this system. We use a variable-width doorway to measure the scaling of motor output to visual input specifying <b>door</b> <b>width.</b> By measuring walking behaviour as participants passed through the doorway, we show that both PD and healthy control participants scaled their locomotor outputs to <b>door</b> <b>width.</b> Both groups reacted to narrower doors by walking more slowly with shorter strides. However, the changes were greater in the PD group, where walking speed dramatically decreased while approaching the doorway. Such a pattern could help explain why doorways cause freezing episodes in PD. Neither explicit perceptual judgements of <b>door</b> <b>width,</b> nor performance on motor tasks, predicted the door behaviour. On the basis of these findings, we propose that PD is associated with a visuomotor disturbance, such that responses to action-relevant visual information are exaggerated. In the PD group, dopaminergic medications improved many baseline gait variables but did not affect their sensitivity to <b>door</b> <b>width,</b> suggesting that this visuomotor effect is not mediated by the basal ganglia. This hypothesis provides a novel framework for interpreting a variety of results with PD patients...|$|E
40|$|<b>Door</b> <b>width</b> {{is one of}} the {{important}} factors to concern in layout or facilities design because it affects directly to traffic speed and overall traffic time simultaneously. Nowadays, common assessment method is computer simulation which is still not realistic due to the unchanged speed of model while walking through a door.

Sixty subjects participated in the experiment and performed task by walking through the door that is set the width as 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 and 100 centimetres. The optical motion capture system was used to determine walking speed. The results showed that Fitts’ law was applied to the participants with high weight. <b>Door</b> <b>width</b> below 70 centimetres significantly affected to changing speed at 0 - 0. 5 m. before the door.

40|$|Freezing of gait in Parkinson’s {{disease can}} be {{difficult}} to study in the laboratory. Here we investigate the use of a variable-width doorway to provoke freeze behavior together with new objective methods to measure it. With this approach we compare the effects of anti-parkinsonian treatments (medications and deep-brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus) on freezing and other gait impairments. Ten ‘‘freezers’’ and 10 control participants were studied. Whole-body kinematics were measured while participants walked at preferred speed in each of 4 doorway conditions (no door present, <b>door</b> <b>width</b> at 100 %, 125 %, and 150 % of shoulder width) and in 4 treatment states (offmeds/offstim, offmeds/onstim,onmeds/offstim, onmeds/onstim). With no doorway, the Parkinson’s group showed characteristic gait disturbances including slow speed, short steps, and variable step timing. Treatments improved these disturbances. The Parkinson’s group slowed further at doorways by an amount inversely proportional to <b>door</b> <b>width,</b> suggesting a visuomotor dysfunction. This was not improved by either treatment alone. Finally, freeze-like events were successfully provoked near the doorway and their prevalence significantly increased in narrower doorways. These were defined clinically and by 2 objective criteria that correlated well with clinical ratings. The risk of freeze-like events was reduced by medication but not by deep-brain stimulation. Freeze behavior can be provoked in a replicable experimental setting using the variable-width doorway paradigm,and measured objectively using 2 definitions introduced here. The differential effects of medication and deep-brain stimulation on the gait disturbances highlight the complexity of Parkinsonian gait disorders and their management...|$|E

40|$|An average {{pedestrian}} {{flow through}} an exit {{is one of}} the most important index in evaluating pedestrian dynamics. In order to study the flow in detail, the floor field model, which is a crowd model by using cellular automaton, is extended by taking into account a realistic behavior of pedestrians around the exit.

It is found quantitatively that the effect of exit <b>door</b> <b>width,</b> a wall, and pedestrian's mood of competition or cooperation significantly influence the average flow.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to characterize the ingress and egress activities of wheeled mobility device (WhMD) passengers using fixed-route large, accessible transit vehicles (LATVs), and to examine factors associated with incidents occurring on ramps. A retrospective review of public transit video surveillance footage of WhMDseated passengers accessing fixed-route LATVs was conducted. Ingress and egress activities were characterized based on travel conditions and characteristics of the WhMD and LATV ramp. Incidents were identified based on predetermined criteria, and chi-square analysis was performed to identify WhMD and/or ingress/egress characteristics associated with incidents. Video records of 250 WhMD trips were analyzed. A total of 39 incidents occurred during ingress and 12 incidents occurred during egress. Results indicated that the frequency of incidents was significantly greater for scooter users and passengers who ascended the ramp using a rear-facing WhMD orientation.

40|$|A bidimensional {{cellular}} automaton model {{is used to}} simulate the process of evacuation of pedestrians {{in a room with}} fixed obstacles. A floor field is defined so that moving to a cell with lower floor field means approaching an exit door.

Two types of exit doors are considered: single (where only one person can pass) and double (two persons can pass simultaneously). For a double door, the longest evacuation time turns out to occur for a very traditional location of the door. The optimum door position is determined. Replacing the double door by two single doors does not improve evacuation times noticeably. On the other hand, for a room without obstacles, a simple scaling law is proposed to model the dependence of evacuation time with the number of persons and exit width.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the formation of}} stable arches in granular materials by using a series of laboratory tests. To this aim, a developed trapdoor apparatus is designed to find dimensions of arches formed over the door in cohesionless aggregates. This setup has two new important applications. In order to investigate the maximum width of the opening generated exactly {{on the verge of}} failure, the door can be open to an arbitrary size. In addition, the box containing granular materials (or base angle) is able to be set on optional angles from zero to 90 degrees with respect to the horizontal. Therefore, it is possible to understand the effect of different levels of gravity accelerations on the formed arches. It is observed that for all tested granular materials, increasing the door size and decreasing the base angle, both cause to increase the width and height of the arch. Moreover, the shape of all arches is governed by a parabola. Furthermore, the maximum <b>door</b> <b>width</b> is approximately five to 8. 6 times the particle size, depending on the internal friction angle of materials and the base angle...|$|E
