5|$|Nickelodeon Movies {{purchased}} the film {{rights of the}} A Series of Unfortunate Events novel series in May 2000. Paramount Pictures, owner of Nickelodeon Movies, agreed to co-finance, along with Scott Rudin. Various directors, including Terry Gilliam and Roman Polanski, were interested in making the film. One of author Daniel Handler's favorite candidates was Guy Maddin. In June 2002, Barry Sonnenfeld was hired to direct. He was chosen because he previously collaborated with Rudin and because of his black comedy directing style from The Addams Family, Addams <b>Family</b> <b>Values</b> <b>and</b> Get Shorty. Sonnenfeld referred to the Lemony Snicket novels as his favorite children's stories. The director hired Handler to write the script {{with the intention of}} making Lemony Snicket as a musical, and cast Jim Carrey as Count Olaf in September 2002.|$|E

Her campaign ensured sufficient conservatives voted against an altering of the abortion law, which prevented the introduction of embryonic stem cell research.

25|$|Clinton chose U.S. Senator Al Gore (D-Tennessee) to be {{his running}} mate on July 9, 1992. Choosing fellow Southerner Gore went against the popular {{strategy}} of balancing a Southern candidate with a Northern partner. Gore did serve to balance the ticket in other ways, as he was perceived as strong on <b>family</b> <b>values</b> <b>and</b> environmental issues, while Clinton was not. Also, Gore's similarities to Clinton allowed him to push some of his key campaign themes, such as centrism and generational change.|$|E

500|$|James Burton, a {{communication}} arts professor at Salisbury University, argued that conservatives claimed Forrest Gump {{as their own}} due less {{to the content of}} the film and more to the historical and cultural context of 1994. Burton claimed the film's content and advertising campaign were affected by the cultural climate of the 1990s, which emphasized <b>family</b> <b>values</b> <b>and</b> [...] "American values"—values epitomized in the successful book Hollywood vs. America. He claimed this climate influenced the apolitical nature of the film, which allowed for many different political interpretations.|$|E

500|$|Irish Thoroughbred was {{initially}} published {{as a category}} romance novel.

[...] Although each category romance novel is unique, it is required {{to conform to the}} general parameters that define its line. [...] The small number of books published in each line every month are numbered sequentially within the line. [...] Irish Thoroughbred was number 81 in the Silhouette Romance line. [...] Novels in this line espouse more traditional <b>family</b> <b>values</b> <b>and</b> place greater emphasis on the characters' emotions rather than their physical needs. [...] Although these novels often describe sexual tension between the main characters, sexual intercourse is only described within the bounds of marriage.|$|E
500|$|The musical {{style of}} Hermética was {{considered}} to be [...] "old-fashioned". The band achieved success {{as a result of their}} introspective lyrics. Unlike most heavy metal bands, Hermética's music was appealing to poor people. Iorio wrote about his thoughts and concerns from a personal perspective. He stated that some of his lyrics were inspired by 1940s Argentine tango music. Hermética was part of the Rock chabón movement within Argentine rock; their music was influenced by Argentine nationalism, <b>family</b> <b>values</b> <b>and</b> neighbourhood-centered localism. Iorio said that he does not support racism or fascism. The lyrics, except for covers, were always written in Spanish because Iorio does not approve of artists who write in English to gain foreign audience. The first two albums addressed a variety of topics; the track [...] "Memoria de siglos" [...] ("Memory of centuries") references the cult of personality, buck passing, peace through strength, and wage slavery. Each song from their third album is devoted to a different subject.|$|E
500|$|Divine became {{increasingly}} known for outlandish stunts onstage, each {{time trying to}} outdo {{what he had done}} before.

[...] When he performed at the London Gay Pride parade, he sang on the roof of a hired pleasure boat that floated down the Thames past Jubilee Gardens. At a performance Divine gave at the Hippodrome {{in the last year of}} his life, he appeared onstage riding an infant elephant which had been hired for the occasion. Divine was nevertheless not happy with being known primarily for his drag act, and told an interviewer that [...] "my favorite part of drag is getting out of it. Drag is my work clothes. I only put it on when someone pays me to", a view he echoed to his friends.|$|E

500|$|Other federal {{action on}} behalf of blacks was equally ineffective: when the Supreme Court struck down the Civil Rights Act of 1875 in the Civil Rights Cases (1883), Arthur {{expressed}} his disagreement with the decision in a message to Congress, {{but was unable to}} persuade Congress to pass any new legislation in its place. Arthur did, however, effectively intervene to overturn a court-martial ruling against a black West Point cadet, Johnson Whittaker, after the Judge Advocate General of the Army, David G. Swaim, found the prosecution's case against Whittaker to be illegal and based on racial bias. The administration faced a different challenge in the West, where the LDS Church was under government pressure to stop the practice of polygamy in Utah Territory. [...] Garfield had believed polygamy was criminal behavior and was morally detrimental to <b>family</b> <b>values,</b> <b>and</b> Arthur's views were, for once, in line with his predecessor's. [...] In 1882, he signed the Edmunds Act into law; the legislation made polygamy a federal crime, barring polygamists both from public office and the right to vote.|$|E
500|$|The album's {{title track}} served {{as its first}} single, and topped the Hot 100 chart for six {{consecutive}} weeks. It {{attracted the attention of}} conservative organizations who complained that the song and its accompanying video promoted premarital sex and undermined <b>family</b> <b>values,</b> <b>and</b> moralists sought to have the song and video banned. Madonna received a huge media coverage for her performance of [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] at the first 1984 MTV Video Music Awards. Wearing a wedding dress and white gloves, Madonna appeared on stage atop a giant wedding cake and then rolled around suggestively on the floor. MTV retrospectively [...] considered it one of the [...] "most iconic" [...] pop performances of all time. The second single, [...] "Material Girl", reached number two on the Hot 100 and was promoted by a music video recreating Marilyn Monroe's performance of [...] "Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend" [...] from the 1953 film Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. While filming this video, Madonna started dating actor Sean Penn. They married on her birthday in 1985.|$|E
500|$|There were {{significant}} privacy {{concerns about the}} database. The Foundation for Information Policy Research produced a report in November 2006, Children’s Databases – Privacy and Safety, saying the database guidelines ignored <b>family</b> <b>values</b> <b>and</b> privacy, and that the details on the database needs to be 'looked at carefully'. The government responded by saying they had 'serious reservations about [...] report's objectivity and evidence base'. Terri Dowty, one of the report's authors, replied, 'it's an appalling aspersion to throw {{at some of the}} leading academics in this field. I'm astonished they are challenging the evidence we used since much of the evidence in the report is from the Government itself.' Action on Rights for Children said that the proposals invaded a child's right to privacy given by the Convention on the Rights of the Child, while the Joint Committee on Human Rights said that the 'serious interference' with the rights under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights – the right to respect for private life – seemed to be 'difficult to justify'. Liberty, a civil liberties interest group, said governments should not interfere with family life, warning against complacency 'about the importance of privacy in a free society'.

500|$|Dissanayeke and Sahai note that, {{although}} the film borrowed heavily from the Hollywood Western genre, particularly in its visuals, it was successfully [...] "Indianised". As an example, William van der Heide has compared a massacre scene in Sholay {{with a similar}} scene in Once Upon a Time in the West. Although both films were similar in technical style, Sholay emphasised Indian <b>family</b> <b>values</b> <b>and</b> melodramatic tradition, while the Western was more materialistic and restrained in its approach. Maithili Rao, in Encyclopedia of Hindi Cinema, notes that Sholay infuses {{the style of the}} Western genre into a [...] "feudalistic ethos". Ted Shen of the Chicago Reader notes Sholays [...] "hysterical visual style" [...] and intermittent [...] "populist message". Cultural critic and Islamist scholar Ziauddin Sardar lampoons the film in his book The Secret Politics of Our Desires: Innocence, Culpability and Indian Popular Cinema, both for its caricature and stereotyping of Muslim and women characters, and for what he calls mockery of innocent villagers. Sardar notes that the two most prominent Muslim characters in the film are Soorma Bhopali (a buffoonish criminal), and an impotent victim of the bandits (the imam). Meanwhile, the sole function of one female character (Radha) is to suffer her fate in silence, while the other female lead (Basanti) is just a garrulous village belle.|$|E
500|$|The {{allegations}} {{also had}} an effect on the content of Jackson's music: HIStory, which was released shortly after the allegations, [...] "creates an atmosphere of paranoia," [...] according to one writer. Its content focuses on the public struggles Jackson went through just prior to its production. In the songs [...] "Scream" [...] and [...] "Tabloid Junkie", along with the ballad [...] "You Are Not Alone", Jackson directs much of his anger and personal hurt at the media. In the track [...] "D.S.", Jackson launches a verbal attack against a character who is often cited to be Tom Sneddon, the District Attorney that requested his strip search. He describes the person as an antisocial white supremacist who wanted to [...] "get my ass, dead or alive". Of the song, Sneddon said, [...] "I have not, shall we say, done him the honor of listening to it, but I’ve been told that it ends with the sound of a gunshot." [...] In the introspective ballad [...] "Stranger in Moscow", Jackson laments his [...] "swift and sudden fall from grace". He completed the video that was originally supposed to accompany Addams <b>Family</b> <b>Values</b> <b>and</b> released it as Ghosts; the finished video included a framing story about an eccentric maestro who entertains children and is pursued by a bigoted local official.|$|E

Buster works to escape from his mother's control by bonding with brothers Michael and Gob {{as well as with}} love interest Lucille Austero, Lucille Bluth's neighbor and chief social rival. George Michael nurses a forbidden crush on his cousin Maeby, while continually trying to meet his father's expectations. Lindsay's husband Tobias searches for work as an actor, with the aid of Carl Weathers. Michael falls in love with his screw-up older brother Gob's neglected girlfriend Marta, and is torn between being with her and putting [...] "family first". After seeing Michael physically fight with Gob, Marta realizes that they do not share the same <b>family</b> <b>values</b> <b>and</b> she leaves them both.

Through an escalating series of dares, Gob gets married to a woman he just met, played by Will Arnett's real-life then-wife Amy Poehler, but cannot get an annulment because he refuses to admit that he did not consummate the marriage. Kitty, George Sr.'s former assistant and mistress, tries to blackmail the company. She is caught in the Bluth family yacht's explosion, as used in one of Gob's magic acts, but survives with a cooler full of damning evidence labeled [...] "H Maddas". After previous failed attempts, and a brief religious stint in Judaism, George Sr. finally escapes from prison by faking a heart attack. It is also revealed that George Sr. committed [...] "light treason" [...] by using the company to build mini-palaces for Saddam Hussein in Iraq.|$|E
