5|$|The {{control systems}} {{also had some}} innovations. The control column was {{centrally}} placed and the pilot sat {{on the port side}} of the cockpit. The column had an extension arm fitted and had the ability to be swung over to the starboard side in case the pilot was incapacitated. The control instruments were located above the pilot's head in the ceiling, which allowed viewing and did not block the pilot's vision. The fuel instruments were electrical. The He 111 used the inner fuel tanks, closest to the wing root, first. The outer tanks acted as reserve tanks. The pilot was alerted to the fuel level when there was 100L (26US gal) left. A manual pump was available in case of electrical or power failure but the <b>delivery</b> <b>rate</b> of just 4½L (1.2US gal) per minute demanded that the pilot fly at the lowest possible speed and just below 3,048m (10,000ft). The He 111 handled well at low speeds.|$|E

40|$|Abstract approved: To {{assess the}} impact of low-altitude jet overflights on parental care, we {{examined}} nest attendance, time-activity budgets, and provisioning rates of 21 Peregrine Falcon (Falco peregrinus) pairs breeding along the Tanana River, Alaska in 1995 and 1996. Several intrinsic and extrinsic factors influenced attributes of nesting behavior. Female nest attendance declined substantially with progression of the nesting cycle, while male attendance patterns were consistent throughout the nesting cycle. Further, although females typically performed most of the incubating, male attendance at the nest area varied considerably among breeding pairs. Both prey item <b>delivery</b> <b>rates</b> and estimated prey mass <b>delivery</b> <b>rates</b> increased with brood size. Prey item <b>delivery</b> <b>rates</b> per nestling, however, decreased with increasing brood size; yet estimated prey mass <b>delivery</b> <b>rates</b> per nestling did not vary with brood size. Peregrine Falcons apparently maintained constant provisioning rates per nestling as brood size increased by increasing average prey size. We found evidence that nest attendance and time-activity budgets of Peregrine Falcons differed during periods of overflights compared with reference nests, bu...|$|R
25|$|Still believing {{this could}} be improved, and after {{examining}} more concepts based on the Albatross and the new all-metal DH.95 Flamingo, de Havilland settled on designing a new aircraft that would be aerodynamically clean, wooden and powered by the Merlin, which offered substantial future development. The new design would be faster than foreseeable enemy fighter aircraft, and could dispense with a defensive armament, which would slow it and make interception or losses to anti-aircraft guns more likely. Instead, high speed and good manoeuvrability {{would make it easier}} to evade fighters and ground fire. The lack of turrets simplified production and reduced production time, with a <b>delivery</b> <b>rate</b> far in advance of competing designs. Without armament, the crew could be reduced to a pilot and navigator. Contemporary RAF design philosophy required well-armed heavy bombers more akin to the German schnellbomber. At a meeting in early October 1938 with Geoffrey de Havilland and Charles Walker (de Havilland's chief engineer), the Air Ministry showed little interest, and instead asked de Havilland to build wings for other bombers as a sub-contractor.|$|E

40|$|Objectives : This study {{sought to}} examine state-specific trends in preterm <b>delivery</b> <b>rates</b> among non-Hispanic African Americans and to assess whether these rates are {{influenced}} by misclassification of gestational age. Methods : The sample population consisted of singleton non-Hispanic White and non-Hispanic African–American infants born in 1991 and 2001 to U. S. resident mothers. For both time periods, state-specific and national preterm <b>delivery</b> <b>rates</b> were calculated for all infants, stratified by infant race/ethnicity. Next, birth-weight distributions within strata of gestational age were studied to explore possible misclassifications of gestational age. Lastly, state-specific and national preterm <b>delivery</b> <b>rates</b> among infants who weighed less than 2, 500  g were separately computed. Results: National analyses showed that the frequency of preterm delivery increased by 15. 8 % among non-Hispanic Whites but declined by 10. 3 % among non-Hispanic African Americans over the same period. For both subgroups, a bimodal distribution of birth weights was apparent among preterm births at 28 – 31 weeks of gestation. The second peak with its cluster of normal-weight infants was more prominent among non-Hispanic African Americans in 1991 than in 2001. After excluding preterm infants who weighed 2, 500  g or more, the national trends persisted. State-specific analyses showed that preterm <b>delivery</b> <b>rates</b> increased for both subgroups in 13 states during this period.

2500|$|When the ovarian follicles {{have reached}} {{a certain degree of}} development, {{induction}} of final oocyte maturation is performed, generally by an injection of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Commonly, this is known as the [...] "trigger shot." [...] hCG acts as an analogue of luteinising hormone, and ovulation would occur between 38 and 40 hours after a single HCG injection, but the egg retrieval is performed at a time usually between 34 and 36 hours after hCG injection, that is, just prior to when the follicles would rupture. This avails for scheduling the egg retrieval procedure at a time where the eggs are fully mature. HCG injection confers a risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. Using a GnRH agonist instead of hCG eliminates most of the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, but with a reduced <b>delivery</b> <b>rate</b> if the embryos are transferred fresh. [...] For this reason, many centers will freeze all oocytes or embryos following agonist trigger.|$|E

The stoker made higher steaming rates possible, and it was hoped that mechanical stoking might enable the burning of low-grade coal. It was relatively inefficient, and the locomotives used in this trial were rebuilt to the normal configuration. Simply supplying more low grade coal than a fireman could do by hand did not provide efficient burning. Trials found that the maximum coal <b>delivery</b> <b>rate</b> of the mechanical stoker was slightly faster than firing by hand, and it could maintain that maximum {{for hours at a time}} when a fireman would tire. However this was of little practical benefit in actual service as even a long-distance freight train would frequently stop to allow faster trains to pass or would be held at signals. For the short periods when maximum firing rate was needed a skilled fireman was more than sufficient. The success of mechanical stoker on North American railroads was mainly because the locomotives were significantly larger (with a suitably greater demand for coal) and many routes required hours of supplying coal at a rate beyond the physical limit of a single fireman.|$|E
