40|$|A {{method is}} {{described}} for thinning an epitaxial layer of a wafer {{that is to}} be used in producing diodes having a specified breakdown voltage and which also facilitates the thinning process. Current is passed through the epitaxial layer, by connecting a current source between the substrate of the wafer and an electrolyte in which the wafer is immersed. When the wafer is initially immersed, the voltage across the wafer initially drops and then rises at a steep rate. When light is applied to the wafer the voltage drops, and when the light is <b>interrupted</b> the <b>voltage</b> rises again. These changes in voltage, each indicate the breakdown voltage of a Schottky diode that could be prepared from the wafer at that time. The epitaxial layer is thinned by continuing to apply current through the wafer while it is immersed and light is applied, to form an oxide film and when the oxide film is thick the wafer can then be cleaned of oxide and the testing and thinning continued. Uninterrupted thinning can be achieved by first forming an oxide film, and then using an electrolyte that dissolves the oxide about as fast as it is being formed, to limit the thickness of the oxide layer...|$|R
40|$|Original sludge from {{wastewater}} treatment plants (WWTPs) usually has a poor dewaterability. Conventionally, mechanical dewatering methods are used to increase the dry solids (DS) content of the sludge. However, sludge dewatering is an important economic factor {{in the operation of}} WWTPs, high water content in the final sludge cake is commonly related to an increase in transport and disposal costs. Electro‐dewatering could be a potential technique to reduce the water content of the final sludge cake, but the parameters affecting the performance of electro‐dewatering {{and the quality of the}} resulting sludge cake, as well as removed water, are not sufficiently well known. In this research, non‐pressure and pressure‐driven experiments were set up to investigate the effect of various parameters and experimental strategies on electro‐dewatering. Migration behaviour of organic compounds and metals was also studied. Application of electrical field significantly improved the dewatering performance in comparison to experiments without electric field. Electro‐dewatering increased the DS content of the sludge from 15 % to 40 % in non‐pressure applications and from 8 % to 41 % in pressure‐driven applications. DS contents were significantly higher than typically obtained with mechanical dewatering techniques in {{wastewater treatment}} plant. The better performance of the pressure‐driven dewatering was associated to a higher current density at the beginning and higher electric field strength later on in the experiments. The applied voltage was one of the major parameters affecting dewatering time, water removal rate and DS content of the sludge cake. By decreasing the sludge loading rate, higher electrical field strength was established between the electrodes, which has a positive effect on an increase in DS content of the final sludge cake. However <b>interrupted</b> <b>voltage</b> application had anegative impact on dewatering in this study, probably because the off‐times were too long. Other factors affecting dewatering performance were associated to the original sludge characteristics and sludge conditioning. Anaerobic digestion of the sludge with high pH buffering capacity, polymer addition and freeze/thaw conditioning had a positive impact on dewatering. The impact of pH on electro‐dewatering was related to the surface charge of the particles measured as zeta‐potential. One of the differences between electro‐dewatering and mechanical dewatering technologies is that electro‐dewatering actively removes ionic compounds from the sludge. In this study, dissolution and migration of organic compounds (such as shortchain fatty acids), macro metals (Na, K, Ca, Mg, Fe) and trace metals (Ni, Mn, Zn, Cr) was investigated. The migration of the metals depended on the fractionation and electrical field strength. These compounds may have both negative and positive impacts on the reuse and recycling of the sludge and removed water. Based on the experimental results of this study, electro‐dewatering process can be optimized in terms of dewatering time, desired DS content, power consumption and chemical usage...|$|R
50|$|Under certain {{circumstances}} the {{vacuum circuit breaker}} can force the current in the circuit to zero, before the natural zero and reversal of current in the alternating current circuit. Additionally, if the timing of interrupter operation is unfavorable {{with respect to the}} ac voltage waveform, when the arc has extinguished but the contacts are still moving and ionization has not yet dissipated in the <b>interrupter,</b> the applied <b>voltage</b> may exceed the withstand voltage of the gap. This can cause reignition of the arc and abrupt transient currents. In either of these cases, oscillations are introduced in the system, and may result in significant overvoltage. Manufacturers of vacuum interrupters address these concerns by selection of contact materials and contact designs selected to minimize current chopping. To protect apparatus from overvoltages, vacuum switchgear assemblies will usually include surge arrester components to prevent damaging over voltage.|$|R

50|$|An {{ignitron}} {{is usually}} a large steel container with a pool of mercury in the bottom {{that acts as a}} cathode during operation. A large graphite or refractory metal cylinder, held above the pool by an insulated electrical connection, serves as the anode. An igniting electrode (called the ignitor), made of a refractory semiconductor material such as silicon carbide, is briefly pulsed with a high current to create a puff of electrically conductive mercury plasma. The plasma rapidly bridges the space between the mercury pool and the anode, permitting heavy conduction between the main electrodes. At the surface of the mercury, heating by the resulting arc liberates large numbers of electrons which help to maintain the mercury arc. The mercury surface thus serves as the cathode, and current is normally only in one direction. Once ignited, an ignitron will continue to pass current until either the current is externally <b>interrupted</b> or the <b>voltage</b> applied between cathode and anode is reversed.|$|R
5000|$|In theory, a {{standard}} analogue electronic multimeter {{could be used}} to perform a DCVG survey, but in practice {{it would be very difficult}} to take accurate readings and assess the direction of the voltage gradients correctly. A digital multimeter is completely unsuitable because of the difficulty in quickly assessing the direction of the voltage gradient. Specially designed DCVG meters are available, which have bespoke voltage ranges, specially designed transient response, rugged cases and (usually) a centre-zero meter movement for ease of use. The NACE method requires the measurements to be made using a pair of copper-copper(II) sulfate electrodes rather than simple metallic probes. In addition, the cathodic protection is switched on and off repeatedly using an electronic switch commonly referred to as an <b>interrupter.</b> Thus, two <b>voltage</b> readings (the [...] "on" [...] and [...] "off" [...] potentials) are taken at each fault position. Counter-intuitively, it is actually the [...] "off" [...] potential which is regarded as more indicative of the effectiveness of the CP applied to the pipeline.|$|R
40|$|A vacuum {{interrupter}} is a switching device used in vacuum circuit breakers, which are widely employed in medium <b>voltage</b> circuits for <b>interrupting</b> the short-circuit fault currents. The {{vacuum interrupter}} is the chamber {{in which the}} arc extinction and hence the current interruption takes place. On the occurrence of a fault, the breaker mechanism separates the contacts of the vacuum interrupter. As the contacts separate, an arc is established between the contacts. The arc evolves in the contact space and extinguishes {{at or near the}} current zero, thus interrupting the current. The processes of arc ignition, evolution and extinction are very complex. These processes are fundamental to the design and the performance of the vacuum interrupter and hence the circuit breaker. The evolution of the arc predominantly depends on the short-circuit current, the design and metallurgy of the contacts. The evolution of the vacuum arc has been the focal point of considerable research activity. Significant effort has been concentrated to understand the various modes of the arc, the transition between the modes, the arc movement and the dependency on the contact design and finally the effect of the arc evolution on the current interruption performance of the vacuum <b>interrupter.</b> The <b>voltage</b> across the contacts during the arcing, termed as the arc voltage, has been a focal point of several research projects. Research has shown that the arc voltage depends strongly on the mode and the evolution process of the arc. The dependency is observed with respect to the magnitude {{and the nature of the}} arc voltage. This dependency has been established through the comparison of the arc voltage trace and the actual arc photographs. The arc voltage is thus an important parameter in understanding the arcing process in the <b>interrupter.</b> Arc <b>voltage</b> could also be utilised to compare the arcing behaviour in vacuum interrupters with different contact geometries and metallurgies. Having understood how the arc voltage depends on the arc modes and how it can be used to analyse the arcing performance of the interrupter, this work aims to establish experimentally the dependency of the arc voltage on fundamental parameters of the short-circuit current and the contact design. The variation of the arc voltage is studied with respect to the magnitude of the short-circuit current. It is seen that the magnitude of the arc voltage is higher, for a higher short-circuit current. This dependency is also reflected in the nature of the arc voltage waveform. The effect of cumulative short- circuit operations has been understood through the study of arc voltage variation with respect to the accumulated arcing time. It has been found that the arc voltage consistently decreases as the accumulated arcing time increases. The effect of the contact diameter on the arc evolution has been studied by comparing the arc voltage variations for contacts of different diameters for the same short-circuit current. It is observed that the variation of arc voltage with respect to the contact diameter depends on the type of contact. In the case of radial magnetic field contacts, it has been observed that the arc voltage is lower for a contact with lower diameter. Whereas in the case of axial magnetic field contacts there is an inverse relation between the contact diameter and the arc voltage. Finally, the effect of the type and distribution of the magnetic field on the arc voltage variation as well as the contact erosion has been studied. In general, the observations show that the arc voltage magnitude for the radial magnetic field geometry is higher than the axial magnetic field geometry. Also, there is a significant difference in the appearance of the arc voltage waveforms for the arcs under the two types of magnetic fields. Finite element simulations and short-circuit evaluations have shown that the axial magnetic field contact system with 90 deg coil orientations yield a more uniform distribution of the flux density and hence lower erosion of the contacts. These results show a clear dependence of the arc voltage on the various above mentioned parameters. Thus the arc voltage could be utilised as a diagnostic parameter during the evaluation of the vacuum interrupter. In the present scenario, significant research is being done to increase the breaking capacity of the interrupters. This calls for optimization of design of the existing contacts and the design of novel contact geometries. The arc voltage would be used as an important diagnostic tool in this process. Also, the utilization of vacuum <b>interrupter</b> in high <b>voltage</b> and extra high voltage circuits is being explored. This application requires increase in the contact gap or series connection of gaps. The arc behaviour in longer gaps and gaps connected in series would be an important research area. Again the arc voltage could be used to study the arc evolution in these specialised conditions. The experiments in this research work have been performed on commercial vacuum interrupters. For a dedicated research on vacuum arcs and vacuum interrupter contacts, development of a vacuum arc research facility has also been attempted as a part of this research work...|$|R
40|$|Suspensions of Bentonite, kaolin and {{red clay}} were dewatered electroosmotically under {{continuous}} and <b>interrupted</b> DC <b>voltage</b> and current. The suspension {{was held in}} a vertical 5 -cm diameter column between two platinum mesh electrodes, an upper anode and a lower cathode. Suspensions were prepared with CaCl$ sb 2 $ in distilled water at concentrations up to 10 $ sp{- 2 }$ M. The initial solid content was between 9. 1 and 15 wt% for Bentonite and between 25 and 45 wt% for kaolin and red clay. The initial bed height ranged from 0. 5 to 2 cm. Constant voltages from 2. 75 to 5. 0 V and constant currents from 30 to 90 mA were used. In the interrupted regime the off-time ranged from 0. 5 to 20 s with the on-time fixed at 30 s. A short circuit or an open circuit was applied during the off-time. The interrupted process with a short circuit was also applied {{at the end of}} a DC run when dewatering had stopped. Electroosmosis removed 20 - 70 % of the water with an energy expenditure well below the heat of vaporization. The water removal rates were increased by the addition of CaCl$ sb 2 $. Beds of 0. 5 cm thick were dewatered faster and with less energy consumption than thicker beds. Interruption with a short circuit applied during a 0. 5 s off-time removed about 20 - 40 % more water than DC for equal energy consumption. Interruption {{at the end of a}} DC run removed nearly the same amount of water as interruption applied from the beginning of a run.

40|$|Power {{quality is}} one of major {{concerns}} in the present era. According to Survey results it shows that 92 % of interruptionat industrial facilities are caused due to voltage sag related. The DVR (Dynamic voltage restorer) is a series connected device whose function is to protect a sensitive industrial load from voltage sags. The voltage sag compensator, based on a transformer-coupled is connected in series to voltage source inverter, {{is among the most}} cost-effective solution against voltage sags. To mitigate the problems caused by poor quality of power supply, series compensators are used. Transformers are often installed in front of critical loads for electrical isolation purposes. When voltage sags happen, the transformers are exposed to the disfigured voltages and a DC offset will occur in its flux linkage. When the compensator restores the load voltage, the flux linkage will be driven to the level of magnetic saturation and severe inrush current occurs. The compensator is likely to be interrupted because of its own over-current protection, and eventually the compensation fails, and the critical loads are <b>interrupted</b> by the <b>voltage</b> sag.

40|$|The {{relatively}} {{high energy density}} of inductive energy storage systems make them quite attractive for many pulsed power applications. For these systems, an opening switch is necessary to transfer the stored energy to the load. Exploding wire opening switches are often employed in these applications. However, one serious limitation to exploding wire switches is their selfdestructive nature. Because the conductor is destroyed when the switch opens, the repetition rate of the switch is limited by how quickly the conductor can be replaced, typically by some mechanical means. However, if the conductor were a liquid metal extruded {{from one of the}} electrodes, the repetition rate would be primarily limited by the velocity of the metal jet, the electrode spacing, and the time required for the plasma to clear the channel. In this research, we are investigating the potential of liquid mercury jets as the switching medium in exploding wire switches.

40|$|International audienceAs {{opposed to}} the first battery {{technologies}} (Pb, Ni-Mh…), whose protection and management required simple electronic circuits, today's Li-ion batteries need to be precisely supervised during all their working cycles to limit their charges and discharges, to ensure their security and improve their lifetime. Battery management is currently performed by monitoring battery cell voltages: charging is <b>interrupted</b> when the <b>voltage</b> of the first cell of the serial arrangement exceeds a threshold value (charging then goes forward with a lower current for the remaining cells). Battery discharge is managed similarly and is <b>interrupted</b> when the <b>voltage</b> of first battery cell falls below a threshold value. The remaining energy in the other cells of the serial arrangement is not used. Hence, the energy stored into the battery is not fully exploited, which limits {{the autonomy of the}} supplied system. Non-dissipative solutions to exchange energy between cells so as to maintain the cells balanced have been reported; yet, they require a large number of DC/DC converters with associated size, weight and price drawbacks. To overcome these limitations and to remove the battery charger and output converter (DC/DC or DC/AC converter to supply the load), we propose a full converter based on battery cell switching, to adjust the battery pack output voltage to the effective need in real time and maintain the battery cells balanced. The architecture we developed consists in connecting or disconnecting in real time each cell placed in the serial arrangement. In the case of an electrical vehicle with 30 kWh on board, by using battery cells of 3. 3 V, the output voltage can be adjusted by steps of 3. 3 V from- 60 V to + 60 V. We show {{that it is possible to}} directly drive a three-phase electric motor with an efficiency up to 98 % from few Hz to 400 Hz, while maintaining the cells balanced. Moreover, this is achieved with a transistor cost lower than 300 € (consumer prices, expectedly 10 times lower for large quantities). For the transistor driving part, a distributed electronic is placed in front of each cell of the serial arrangement. Each distributed electronic circuit is able to drive up to 14 transistors, to carry out local measurements (temperature, current, voltage) and to calculate the estimated State of Charge of the local cell. Distributed electronic circuits communicate with an electronic advisor by using galvanically isolated a common serial communication bus. SWITCHED BATTERY STRUCTURE Standard battery architectures for electric vehicles are based on a battery arrangement of s battery levels connected in series, and battery levels are composed of p cells connected in parallel.

40|$|Repetitive {{synaptic}} stimulation overcomes {{the ability}} of astrocytic processes to clear glutamate from the extracellular space, allowing some dendritic segments to become submerged {{in a pool of}} glutamate. This dynamic arrangement activates extrasynaptic NMDA receptors located on dendritic shafts. We used voltage-sensitive and calcium-sensitive dyes to probe dendritic function in this glutamate-rich location. An excess of glutamate in the extrasynaptic space was achieved either by repetitive synaptic stimulation or by glutamate iontophoresis onto the dendrites of pyramidal neurons. Two successive activations of synaptic inputs produced a typical NMDA spike, whereas five successive synaptic inputs produced characteristic plateau potentials, reminiscent of cortical UP states. While NMDA spikes were coupled with brief calcium transients highly restricted to the glutamate input site, the dendritic plateau potentials were accompanied by calcium influx along the entire dendritic branch. Once initiated, the glutamate-mediated dendritic plateau potentials could not be <b>interrupted</b> by negative <b>voltage</b> pulses. Activation of extrasynaptic NMDA receptors in cellular compartments void of spines is sufficient to initiate and support plateau potentials. The only requirement for sustained depolarizing events is a surplus of free glutamate near a group of extrasynaptic receptors. Highly nonlinear dendritic spikes (plateau potentials) are summed in a highly sublinear fashion at the soma, revealing the cellular bases of signal compression in cortical circuits. Extrasynaptic NMDA receptors provide pyramidal neurons with a function analogous to a dynamic range compression in audio engineering. They limit or reduce the volume of loud sounds (i. e. strong glut. inputs) and amplify quiet sounds (i. e. glutamatergic inputs that barely cross the dendritic threshold for local spike initiation). Our data also explain why consecutive cortical UP states have uniform amplitudes in a given neuron...|$|R
