40|$|A {{variety of}} {{hazardous}} substances may be {{generated from the}} burning materials during fire extinguishing operations, depending on the location, type, and place of the fire. As a result, the fire-extinguishing water may act as a carrier for these nano- and micro-sized fire-born particles, including various types of associated contaminants, and may cause contamination of soil and groundwater resources. While airborne particles from fires have been studied, it is currently not well known what types of nano- and micro-sized contaminants are typically carried by the fire-extinguishing water and how these contaminants can be transported in the natural environment. The main {{purpose of this study}} was to increase the understanding about the occurrence and physical and chemical properties of nanoparticles commonly found in discharge water from fire extinguishing operations. The current study was based on collection of original samples from a fire location. A detailed characterization of the particles present in the <b>extinguishing</b> <b>water</b> was performed including both quantification of contaminants associated with the particles (such as metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) as well as measurement of properties related to the mobility of these particles through porous media. Such mobility properties include size distributions of the particles and the porous media, surface charges and solution chemistry). Results indicate that metals and PAHs are present in both finer and relatively larger fire-born particles. The particles larger than 11 µm were not mobile in porous media. The mobility of the finer particles (< 11 µm) was generally high but was dependent on the solution chemistry. Low mobility of large particles in porous media indicates that a large amount of the contamination can likely be trapped in the top soil layer even though the fire <b>extinguishing</b> <b>water</b> infiltrate...|$|E

40|$|During a fire {{large amounts}} of {{particles}} and unhealthy agents occur.   Polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and toxic metals are examples among many others. These agents have a capacity to bond to particles and when the fire is extinguished, the particles can be transferred with the <b>extinguish</b> <b>water</b> into the soil and to the groundwater. Recent studies in particles have been conducted. A study by Ulrika Iverfelt (2014) reviled that the particles from a fire contained {{large amounts of}} both PAH and metals, {{which is consistent with}} earlier analyses. Her column experiments with particles in the size ≤ 11 microns and ≤ 100 microns in silica sand, reviled that the larger particles was immobilized because the transportation was influenced by sieving or physiochemical particle and surface interactions. The transport of the particles in soil and groundwater is regulated by two main mechanisms: physiochemical surface interactions and straining. The particle size and the surface charge are examples of properties that affect the transport. The particle charge is described by the zeta potential, which is an important characteristic for surface interactions with the solid medium. The zeta potential depends on the water chemistry which varies in different <b>extinguish</b> <b>water.</b> The zeta potential was measured to be negative in Iverfelts (2014) study. In order to predict and understand the transport of the particles, more column experiments with different properties were requested. In this study several transport experiments where made. The four parameters: grain size, particle size, ionic strength and pH were investigated systematically. The same type of column, sand and source of <b>extinguish</b> <b>water</b> as in Iverfelts study was used.   The results from the study indicated that the smaller particles were not affected by sieving, as the larger particles. When the pH was lowered, the results indicated that some of the smaller particles, ≤ 11 microns were immobilized. This was probably because the zeta potential of the particles was reduced, which allowed the physiochemical particle and surface interactions...|$|R

40|$|Many tunnels {{are built}} below the ground water level. In {{case of a}} fire or oil spill {{there is a risk}} of {{environmental}} contamination of ground water supplies or sensitive recipients. Successful treatment of <b>extinguishing</b> <b>water</b> or spills needs rapid attention in such cases. This paper discusses the environmental consequences of a tunnel fire or an oil spill inside the tunnel. It is suggested from the present study of existing technologies, that the work of development within this field be divided into three different areas where two are pro-active while the last requires the development of new technologies for on-site collection and treatment of water. In sensitive areas, this treatment could be combined with in-situ surveys and treatments both prior to and after an incident.   The two pro-active steps are characterization and categorization of tunnels along with the development of a digital system where site specific properties can be modeled. Additionally, at the fire scene, new mobile technologies are needed for effective treatment. Finally the paper discusses the environmental challenges the fire officer has to with deal during an incident and the need for further education of first responders {{on how to deal with}} these issues both in terms of short term and long term incident management priorities...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} obtain {{reliable}} data on the generation of toxic combustion products and to get more insight into the risks of fires in pesticide warehouses TNO performed the research project 'Toxic combustion products from pesticide fires'. The following research activities have been performed during the project: — A study of the casuistry of pesticide fires; — A literature study of small scale combustion test methods; — Execution of medium scale combustion experiments with pesticides; — A study on the extrapolation of the emissions of small and medium scale combustion tests to real fire conditions; — A study on the prevention and control of fires in pesticide storages. Most important results and conclusions of the project. — The medium scale combustion experiments with parathion, chlorfenvinphos, dichlobenil and 2, 4 -D indicate the following: — Emissions of solids (particles and soot), carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons are higher than assumed in present hazard assessment studies; - Emissions of nitrogen oxides and chlorinated dioxins and furans are lower than assumed in present hazard assessment studies; - Chlorine and sulphur in the pesticide are nearly fully converted into hydrogen chloride and sulphur dioxide; - The emissions of ammonia, chlorine and phosgene are below or just above detection limits; - Large quantities of solid residues remain in all fires. The residues contain up to 10 % unburnt pesticide; - Simulated fire extinguishing or oxygen deficiency do not significantly influence the emissions during the medium scale experiments. — Similarity requirements to extrapolate the emissions to pesticides other than those investigated have been determined. As these similarity requirements will not be completely fulfilled {{in many cases the}} uncertainties in the extrapolated emissions are large. — The conservative conversion rates are proposed for a pesticide fire. Fire protection systems — A methodology has been developed to define the required fire protection level of a pesticide storage: - The required fire protection level for a pesticide storage depends on the product fire hazard, the packaging fire hazard, and the environmental and health hazard of the stored materials; - Four fire protection levels for a pesticide storage are distinguished in the methodology, with fire protection levels having different requirements. For level one only the basic minimum requirements like good facility lay out, ignition source control, good housekeeping and regular training of employees are necessary. The highest protection level is level four. For level four automatic fire alarms, sprinkler systems and a basin for <b>extinguishing</b> <b>water</b> are additional requirements. — Application of this methodology is recommended to obtain a cost effective protection level for a pesticide storage taking into account the hazards of the stored pesticides. Small scale test methods — Based on {{the results of the study}} on the characteristics of small scale test methods it can be concluded that the applicability of small scale test methods to predict the emission of toxic products of a pesticide fire is very limited. — Small scale methods should be further developed in order to improve the simulation of the fire conditions observed during the medium scale experiments.

40|$|Executive summary Finland {{signed on}} 20 September 1994 the Convention on Nuclear Safety which was adopted on 17 June 1994 in the Vienna Diplomatic Conference. The Convention was {{ratified}} on 5 January 1996, {{and it came}} into force in Finland on 24 October 1996. This report is the Finnish National Report for the Seventh Review Meeting in March/April 2017. There are two nuclear power plants operating in Finland: the Loviisa and Olkiluoto plants. The Loviisa plant comprises of two PWR units (pressurised water reactors, of VVER type), operated by Fortum Power and Heat Oy, and the Olkiluoto plant two BWR units (boiling water reactors), operated by Teollisuuden Voima Oyj. In addition, a new nuclear power plant unit (PWR) is under construction at the Olkiluoto site. At both sites there are interim storages for spent fuel as well as disposal facilities for low and intermediate level nuclear wastes. Posiva, a joint company by Fortum and TVO, submitted a construction licence application for the spent nuclear fuel repository {{in the end of}} 2012. The construction licence was granted for Posiva by the Government in November 2015. Finland is currently reviewing a construction licence application for Fennovoima Hanhikivi unit 1 in Pyhäjoki (VVER type design). Since the review is underway, Hanhikivi unit 1 is discussed in this report mainly with regard to the licensing process and siting (see Articles 7 and 17 and Annex 5). Furthermore, there is a Triga Mark II research reactor, FiR 1 in Espoo licensed to VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland Ltd. The operating licence for the research reactor FiR 1 is valid until the end of 2023. However, VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland Ltd has decided to shut down and decommission the reactor earlier due to economical reasons. This will be the first decommissioned nuclear facility in Finland representing a new challenge for the utility and the regulatory body. In this report, latest development in the various topics of the Convention on Nuclear Safety is described. Major safety reviews and plant modernisations are explained including safety assessment methods and key results. Safety performance of the Finnish nuclear power plants is also presented by using representative indicators. Finnish regulatory practices in licensing, provision of regulatory guidance, safety assessment, inspection and enforcement are also covered. Major developments in Finland since the Sixth Review Meeting are as follows: updating of legislative and regulatory framework, implementation of the renewed regulatory guides at the operating nuclear power plants completed, periodic safety review carried out at the Loviisa nuclear power plant in 2015 - 2016, and IRRS follow-up mission (IAEA’s Integrated Regulatory Review Service) carried out in Finland. Furthermore, construction of the new nuclear power plant unit continued and progressed to the operating licence phase, one new unit has entered into construction licence phase and construction licence for Olkiluoto Spent Nuclear Fuel encapsulation and disposal facility was granted. Latest development in the various topics of the Convention on Nuclear Safety is described in relevant articles. Finland continues the hosting and participation in the international peer reviews and the Government of Finland has requested the IAEA to carry out four OSART missions in Finland between 2017 – 2022 : • Olkiluoto 1 & 2 OSART mission will be conducted from 27 February until 16 March 2017 • Loviisa NPP OSART mission would take place in March 2018. • Pre-Operational OSART mission for Olkiluoto 3 before the first fuel loading (according to current schedule in April 2018) • Pre-Operational OSART mission for Fennovoima (Hanhikivi unit 1) would take place in 2022. In the report, the implementation of each of the Articles 6 to 19 of the Convention is separately evaluated. Based on the evaluation, the following features emphasising Finnish safety management practices in the field of nuclear safety can be concluded: • During the recent years Finnish legislation and regulatory guidance have been further developed and the revision of regulatory guide system was finalised in 2013. The overall revision of the regulatory guides took into account international guidance such as IAEA safety standards and WENRA (Western European Regulators’ Association) safety reference levels for existing reactors and safety objectives for new reactors. In addition, the lessons learnt from the TEPCO Fukushima Dai-ichi accident are taken into account. No deviation from the convention obligations has been identified in the Finnish regulatory infrastructure including nuclear and radiation safety regulations. • The revised regulatory guides were published at the end of 2013. The revised guides are applied as such for new nuclear facilities. For the existing facilities and facilities under construction separate facility specific implementation decisions are made. In the end of 2014 the licensees of operating NPPs submitted to STUK assessments on the fulfilment of the revised regulatory guides. In 2015, STUK evaluated the assessments and made decisions on how to further improve safety. Regular update and implementation of regulatory guides, particularly with regard to nuclear power plants in operation, are unique measures on the international perspective. • The licensees have shown good safety performance and rigorous safety management practices in carrying out their safety related responsibilities in the operation and modernisation of existing NPPs. During recent years, only minor operational events (INES 1 and below) have taken place and no major safety problems have appeared. The licensees’ practices are considered to comply with the Convention obligations. • Safety assessment is a continuous process and living full scope level 1 and 2 probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) practices are effectively used for the further development of safety. Periodic safety review of the Loviisa plant was carried out in 2015 – 2016, and the periodic safety review of the Olkiluoto plant was carried out in 2007 – 2009. The decisions how to apply the revised regulatory guides at the operating NPPs were made by STUK in 2015. Several plant modifications have been carried out at the operating NPPs during the recent years to further improve the safety. Some of these modifications are originating from the Fukushima Dai-ichi accident. • The resources of the Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority (STUK) have been increased to meet the needs to oversee the construction of the new plants in Finland. The reports of the recent IRRS mission and follow-up mission have been published on STUK’s website and mission results have been and will be used to further improve regulatory guidance and practices. VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland Ltd supports effectively the regulatory body in the safety assessment work providing safety analysis capabilities and tools and performing safety analyses. There are also national research programmes which support and develop the competencies in nuclear safety and waste management of VTT {{as well as in the}} universities participating in the research programmes. • The Nuclear Energy Act was amended in 2015. The Act was revised to broaden STUK’s legal mandate to issue binding regulations. This was one of the recommendations from IRRS mission to Finland in 2012. Based on the amended Act, STUK published the new binding regulations concerning nuclear safety, security, emergency preparedness and waste management, as well as uranium and thorium mining in the beginning of 2016. Furthermore, based on changes in the Act the Government has to take into account the proposals included in the STUK’s statements when considering the conditions of the Decision-in-Principle and licences for nuclear facilities. • In January 2013 the Ministry of Employment and the Economy set up a working group to prepare a research and development strategy for the safe use of nuclear energy. The working group emphasized the importance of the research in the competence building. The Ministry of the Employment and Economy has started the implementation of the recommendations. In 2015 the Nuclear Energy Act was changed to ensure the financing for the enhancement of the nuclear safety research infrastructure. The Sixth Review Meeting in 2014 identified some challenges and recorded some planned measures to improve nuclear safety in Finland. These issues are included and responded in this seventh national report of Finland. Some of these topics are discussed also below. These items were (in brackets the Articles, in which the issues are addressed) : • regulatory oversight of existing NPP’s: ageing management (see Article 14) • challenges in new NPP construction project (Olkiluoto unit 3); oversight of contractors and subcontractors, operating licence application review, digital I&C (see Articles 10, 11, 12, 13, 18 and Annex 4) • preparation for the new build (see Annex 5) • maintaining and improving competence and responding to the growing needs for professional staff (see Articles 8 and 11) • continuous improvement of plant design: natural hazards, ultimate heat sink, I&C, electrical systems, spent fuel storage, emergency control room, replacement of diesel generators (see Articles 14, 17, 18 and Annexes 2, 3 and 4) • implementation of the action plan based on IRRS findings 2012, and follow-up IRRS mission in June 2015 (see Articles 7, 8, 10, 13, and Annex 6). Still some of these issues require further development to enhance safety, i. e., including provision for plant ageing, reliability and safety demonstration of digital I&C and management of competence taking into account the new build projects and retirement of experts. Other important issues cover new technologies, security arrangements and the growing need for new research and development programmes. These are generic issues that require international attention in all countries using nuclear energy. Implementation of the updated ageing management requirements is underway for NPPs in operation and some specific challenges to fulfil these requirements have been met. For instance the revised regulatory guide has a requirement on the availability and operability as well as monitoring the condition of spare parts. Inspections have revealed that the amount of spare parts can be inadequate for keeping the plant in a safe state also during either aged or obsoleted. Another challenge has to do with knowledge and resources allocated for ensuring appropriate ageing management programme at NPPs. Inspections have revealed that the licensees have challenges to implement knowledge management to ensure that in the event of personnel changes information and knowledge necessary for discharging the duties involved is transferred to the successors. Additional challenge is to conduct relevant research to both educate personnel and to identify new ageing mechanisms to develop new inspection or monitoring technologies to detect degradation early enough. The expected lifetime of the existing nuclear power plants requires renewal of systems, structures and components and modernisation of technologies. The regulation of the existing nuclear power plants emphasises the management of ageing and the quality of plant operations. The modernisation of I&C and other systems at the Loviisa and Olkiluoto plants are either undergoing or under planning, and therefore extra care is needed to ensure that operational safety will be maintained notwithstanding the plant modifications. Operating experience has shown that special attention has to be paid on the meticulous planning and controlled implementation and testing of the plant modifications and STUK is following this in its regulatory inspections. A generic lesson learned in Finland is that the closer nuclear power plants get to the end of their design lifetime, especially due to the current market price of electricity, more difficult it is for the licensees to make decisions to modernise or modify the NPPs. Instead of renewing a system or a component, modernisation may be rejected or a partial modification is planned resulting in ageing issues in the remaining parts. Finland has successfully applied periodic safety reviews (PSR) for the operating NPPs. Practice has been that the licensee is obliged to demonstrate that the safety of the operations can be ensured and improved also during the next 10 years, and to do that the licensee has to commit to make safety improvements including major modernisations to address ageing of SSCs. The retirement of large age groups in Finland has been affecting public administration and industry throughout, including STUK, utilities and the spent fuel management company Posiva as well as organisations providing technical support and education to them. The plans for a new NPP construction project and the above mentioned challenges and activities require additional resources and efforts from the nuclear power utilities and regulatory body as well as from technical support organisations. Thus, ensuring an adequate national supply of experts in nuclear science and technology and ensuring high quality research infrastructure are continuous challenges in Finland. For the moment, STUK has adequate resources to fulfil its oversight responsibilities. However, resources used for developing STUK’s own activities may be considered to be occasionally insufficient. The Government has been decreasing STUK’s budget during the past years mostly due to reorganisation of funding and conduct of research in the government organisations. While oversight activities are charged in full from the licensees and nuclear safety research programmes are funded via waste management fund, budget cuts have not impacted the nuclear safety research or resources needed for the regulated activities. However, due to budget cuts STUK has partly terminated and also decreased significantly its radiation safety research (e. g. biological effects of radiation, biodosimetry). Since radiation safety research activities have been contributing to the maintenance and development of know how in Finland, STUK has established a national radiation safety research programme in co-operation with all universities in Finland to ensure that radiation safety research will be continued in Finland. Since the interest in nuclear power in Finland is increasing, communication and information sharing with media and the general public on nuclear and radiation safety has become an increasingly important success factor for STUK and utilities. Regulatory processes and decisions have to be clear and understandable to general public. Due to the challenge, STUK has initiated a strategic communication development project in spring 2016 to address both changing communication environment and the use of modern communication tools. In addition, STUK has also initiated a project to develop its crisis communication capabilities. This work is based on the experience on recent events as well as past emergency exercises. Actions taken as a result of the TEPCO Fukushima Dai-ichi accident Following the accident at the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant on the 11 th of March in 2011 (TEPCO Fukushima Dai-ichi accident), safety assessments were initiated in Finland immediately. In order to ensure nuclear safety, the Ministry of Employment and the Economy requested STUK to carry out a study on how the Finnish NPPs have prepared against prolonged losses of electric power supply and ultimate heat sink and extreme natural phenomena. Based on the results of the assessments conducted in Finland, it was concluded that no such hazards or deficiencies have been found that would require immediate actions at the Finnish NPPs. However, areas where nuclear safety can further be enhanced were identified, and accordingly, Finnish National Action Plan how to address these areas was created. The experiences from the TEPCO Fukushima Dai-ichi accident were also addressed in the renewed regulation and Finnish Regulatory Guides (YVL Guides) and in the nuclear safety research programme (SAFIR), see Articles 7 and 8. In addition to the periodic safety reviews carried out for the nuclear power plants, an extraordinary review of site related issues was performed after the TEPCO Fukushima Dai-ichi accident in connection with the so called European stress tests. Assessment of the safety margins and effects of exceeding the design basis values have been available and utilised for all identified relevant hazards (including extreme weather conditions) in connection with external events probabilistic risk assessments (PRA) which are mandatory for the Finnish NPPs. The stress tests did not reveal any new site-related external hazards or vulnerabilities of the plants to external events. No need for immediate action was recognised, but some additional studies of external hazards and feasibility studies for plant modifications to improve robustness against external events were found justified (see Article 17). The following examples of safety improvements and additional analyses of external events can be mentioned: enhanced protection against high seawater level at the Loviisa NPP, detailed structural analysis of spent fuel pools to demonstrate integrity of the pools in the case of an earthquake with consequential boiling in the pools and seismic walk-downs of the fire <b>extinguishing</b> <b>water</b> system at the Olkiluoto NPP following with some improvement measures. The systems needed for residual heat removal from the reactor, containment and spent fuel pools require external power at both Finnish NPPs. At both sites, the ultimate heat sink is the sea. A reliable supply of electrical power to the systems providing for basic safety functions at the Finnish NPPs is ensured by the Defence-in-Depth (DiD) concept. As a result of multiple and diversified electrical power sources at different DiD levels, the probability of loss of all electrical supply systems is considered very low at the Finnish NPPs. However, as a result of the studies made after the TEPCO Fukushima Dai-ichi accident, further changes are under planning or implemented at the both NPPs (see Articles 6 and 18). For example at the Loviisa NPP the independent air-cooled cooling units have been installed for decay heat removal from the reactor core and from the spent fuel pools in case of the loss of sea as an ultimate heat sink. These cooling units were considered already before the TEPCO Fukushima Dai-ichi accident due to the increased risks related to transporting of oil on the Finnish Gulf. Safety improvements at the Olkiluoto units 1 and 2 include ensuring cooling of the reactor core in case of total loss of AC systems, ensuring operation of the auxiliary feed water system pumps independently of availability of the sea water systems, and diverse cooling of the spent fuel pools. The emergency diesel generators will be replaced within the next few years. The new emergency diesel generators will be provided with alternative air and seawater cooling, while the existing diesels have only seawater cooling. A comprehensive severe accident management (SAM) strategy has been developed and implemented at the operating Finnish NPPs during 1980 ’s and 1990 ’s after the accidents in TMI and Chernobyl (see Annexes 2 and 3). These strategies are based on ensuring the containment integrity which is required in the existing national regulations. STUK has reviewed these strategies and has made inspections in all stages of implementation. As a result of the studies made after the TEPCO Fukushima Dai-ichi accident, no major changes at the plants are considered necessary for severe accident management. However, the licensees are expected to consider ensuring the cooling of spent fuel pools in the SAM procedures (see Article 19). In addition, there are many actions related to the update of the emergency plans (see Article 16). Both NPPs were required to clarify and update their emergency preparedness plans with respect to issues like the possibility of several reactor units’ simultaneous accident, evaluation of the number and the suitability of emergency response personnel to their duties, management of access control and contamination control in the case when the normal arrangements are out of function and restoring the access routes and connections to the site in case of massive destruction of the infrastructure. Concerning the off-site emergency preparedness and response (see Article 16), no needs for major changes were identified. However, some improvements were identified and implemented that are for instance improved accessibility to the site in case of extreme natural hazards, ensured sufficient amount of radiation protection equipment and radiation monitoring capabilities for rescue services and improved the communication arrangements between emergency centers of NPPs, STUK, and Rescue Service. In 2014 Loviisa NPP exercised for the first time a two reactor unit’s simultaneous accident scenario. Furthermore, during the national full command post exercise OLKI- 14 actions and decision making of the intermediate phase of the severe accident were exercised for the first time. Most of the Fukushima Dai-ichi related safety improvements presented in the Finnish national action plan have already been implemented. A few ongoing measures will still be completed in the next few years. Further information related to the actions taken in Finland following the accident at the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant are described in more detail under Articles 16, 17,...|$|E

All compounds of ytterbium are treated as highly toxic, although studies appear to indicate that the danger is minimal. However, ytterbium compounds cause irritation to human skin and eyes, and some might be teratogenic. Metallic ytterbium dust can spontaneously combust, and the resulting fumes are hazardous. Ytterbium fires cannot be <b>extinguished</b> using <b>water,</b> and only dry chemical class D fire extinguishers can extinguish the fires.|$|R
5|$|Like many powders, {{dysprosium}} powder {{may present}} an explosion hazard when {{mixed with air}} and when an ignition source is present. Thin foils of the substance can also be ignited by sparks or by static electricity. Dysprosium fires cannot be put out by water. It can react with water to produce flammable hydrogen gas. Dysprosium chloride fires, however, can be <b>extinguished</b> with <b>water,</b> while dysprosium fluoride and dysprosium oxide are non-flammable. Dysprosium nitrate, Dy(NO3)3, is a strong oxidizing agent and will readily ignite on contact with organic substances.|$|R
30|$|An {{example of}} this process is a source fire is being <b>extinguished</b> with <b>water,</b> where the hazard is the {{chemical}} runoff, the water then flows to a river by means of the surface water runoff. The targets of fish, crustaceans, and algae all either ingest or contact the chemical runoff. The chemicals are then absorbed and metabolized when the target processes the chemical. The toxicity of the exposed depends of the population, size and potency of the chemicals but ultimately it can cause birth defects or mortality in the species in the river.|$|R

50|$|The Cornforth reagent is {{very toxic}} to aquatic life and may cause {{long-term}} {{damage to the}} environment if released in large amounts. It irritates skin and mucous membranes and may induce allergic reactions; it is carcinogenic. The maximum allowable concentration varies between 0.01 and 0.1 mg·m−3 in air depending on the country. Because it contains hexavalent chromium, it is a suspected carcinogen, and as a strong oxidant, pyridinium dichromate promotes fires, releasing carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and toxic metal smoke. The fire can be <b>extinguished</b> by <b>water</b> or CO2.|$|R
40|$|AbstractSpray fire {{is a major}} {{disaster}} for gas turbines and aero-engine test facilities. Previous studies demonstrated that small spray fires were difficult to <b>extinguish</b> with <b>water</b> mist. An experimental study {{of the process of}} water mist interacting with the small size spray fire was conducted in an open space. Studies on suppression of vertical spray fire and horizontal spray fire were carried out, respectively. Experiment discovered that a horizontal fame was more difficult to extinguish compared with the vertical using the same scenario, and implied that the coupling the dilution of fuel in the gas phase with the reduction of radiant feedback plays a predominant role in fire extinguishment...|$|R
50|$|In 1933, {{the local}} {{government}} decided to burn documents that could compromise the Soviet regime. However, during the process, the fire grew {{out of control and}} had to be <b>extinguished</b> by <b>water</b> and, crucially, sand. All documents in the archive were believed to be destroyed; as the church altar was not used by the archive, the surviving documents, covered by a layer of sand, had never been found. In 1982, the local archive changed its address and the church became abandoned. When Sennikov found the documents, the Tambov department of KGB opened a criminal case against him. Later, the case was closed, but Sennikov lost his job.|$|R
