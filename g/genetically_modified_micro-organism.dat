40|$|A {{computer}} simulation model was developed which describes growth and competition of {{bacteria in the}} soil environment. In the model, soil was assumed to contain millions of pores of a few different size classes. An introduced bacterial strain, e. g. a <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>micro-organism</b> (GEMMO), was assumed to distribute among the pores of the different size classes. This strain (the invader) was assumed {{to compete with the}} indigenous soil biota. Key aspect in this competition was the available pore space. The model predicted that generally the GEMMO invader bacteria ultimately did not become established in soil. Extinction of the invader was, however, often slow, and could take in the order of years. Very harsh conditions in soil were seen to enhance the pore space available for colonization and hence the probability that the invader was able to expel the indigenous microflora and become established. Extinction of the invader was slower when it was introduced when soil conditions were becoming more favourable for microbial life than when conditions were worsening...|$|E

The FEEDAP Panel considers that the safety aspects other than those related to the new target species are covered in the previous opinion and would not be affected by this extension of use. Therefore, the present opinion focuses only on the safety and efficacy of this enzyme preparation for the target species turkeys for fattening. Four experiments have been provided by the applicant to support the efficacy of the product.

Three <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> Rhizobium leguminosarum biovar viciae strains were constructed, using a gene cassette containing an inducible lacZ gene from Escherichia coli and mercury resistance determinants from transposon Tn 1831. In the first case the genes have been integrated into the chromosome, the second strain contains the inducible cassette on a plasmid, in the third case the cassette is carried by the same plasmid, but the lacZ is constitutively expressed at high levels, due to {{the removal of the}} regulatory structure (lac operator) between the gene and its promoter. Three inoculum formulations, based on liquid, vermiculite and peat carriers, were prepared using the <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> strains, and were monitored during a period of up to 16 months. Results indicate a high stability of the chromosomally integrated markers. The plasmid-borne modification also was very stable, though the presence of the plasmid affected the strain growth kinetics.

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of horizontal gene transfer between bacteria within digestive vacuoles and faecal pellets of the protozoan Tetrahymena pyriformis was investigated. More than 90 % of the egested faecal pellets of T. pyriformis, added as predator to a suspension of Escherichia coli, contained viable bacteria. In a mixed population, containing donor (plasmid RP 4) and recipient E. coli cells, {{the presence of}} T. pyriformis increased conjugational gene transfer by three orders of magnitude. Since the protozoa formed an average of 12 - 13 digestive vacuoles per cell, each protozoan had statistically egested one or more transconjugants. Thus, we show {{for the first time}} that digestive vacuoles of free-living protozoa appear to be an important ecological micro-niche, where gene transfer by conjugation (or retromobilisation) will be favoured. So far, digestive vacuoles have been ignored in genetic and ecological studies.

40|$|Interest in third-generation biomass such as macroalgae has {{increased}} {{due to their}} high biomass yield, absence of lignin in their tissues, lower competition for land and fresh water, no fertilization requirements, and efficient CO 2 capture in coastal ecosystems. However, several challenges still exist {{in the development of}} cost-effective technologies for processing large amounts of macroalgae. Recently, <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>micro-organisms</b> able to convert brown macroalgae carbohydrates into bioethanol were developed, but still no attempt to scale up production has been proposed. Based on a giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) farming and bioethanol production program carried out in Chile, we were able to test and adapt this technology as a first attempt to scale up this process using a 75 L fermentation of <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> Escherichia coli. Laboratory fermentation tests results showed that although biomass growth and yield are not greatly affected by the alginate:mannitol ratio, ethanol yield showed a clear maximum around a 5 : 8 alginate:mannitol ratio. In M. pyrifera, a much greater proportion of alginate and lower mannitol abundance is found. In order {{to make the most of}} the carbohydrates available for fermentation, we developed a four-stage process model for scaling up, including acid leaching, depolymerization, saccharification, and fermentation steps. Using this process, we obtained 0. 213 Kg ethanol Kg(- 1) dry macroalgae, equivalent to 9. 6 m(3) of ethanol hectare(- 1) year(- 1), reaching 64 % of the maximum theoretical ethanol yield. We propose strategies to increase this yield, including synthetic biology pathway engineering approaches and process optimization targets.

40|$|Most {{attempts}} {{to monitor the}} effects of introductions of <b>Genetically</b> <b>Modified</b> <b>Micro-organisms</b> (GMMs) have centred on the enumeration of specific populations. However for a significant perturbation to be measured, changes of between 100 % and 300 % (0. 3 and 0. 5 on a log scale) are necessary for the impact to be significant. Standard population measurements, assessing the survival, dissemination and effect on total indigenous populations do not give {{an indication of the}} functioning of the ecosystem. There is very little literature regarding the functional impact of GMMs, for instance the effect upon nutrient cycling or functionally important groups of organisms. Through out this review a number of methods for the detection of perturbation in the rhizosphere/soil ecosystem are assessed. A range of non functional methods are summarised first, including molecular and non molecular genetic population diversity studies. Functional methodology, for example nutrient cycling, is then assessed for application as indicators of impact in the soil ecosystem and the significance of measuring functional impact is highlighted. These functional methods are classified into those relying upon the culturability of the target organisms and those that do not. Non culture methods discussed include biomass, respiration, nutrient cycling, mRNA studies and soil enzyme assays. Recently a range of soil enzyme assays have been used as alternatives to population measurements. The impact of a chromosomally marked Pseudomonas fluorescens (SBW 25), on soil chitobiosidase, N-acetyl glucosaminidase, acid and alkaline phosphatases, phosphodiesterase, aryl sulphatase and urease were studied. Using these enzyme assays impacts of less than 20 % could be detected. A series of interactions were observed which depended on whether a mixture of soil enzyme substrates were added to soil. Generally, microbial inoculation increased the enzyme activity of the biomass, but effects are likely to be 2 dependent upon the nature of the genetic modification. The environmental implications of these effects are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Future fuels will be {{developed}} {{from a variety of}} biomass and fossil sources, and must seek to address the adverse environmental impacts of current fossil fuel usage. To this end, understanding how the molecular structure of a fuel impacts on the processes of combustion and emissions production is critical in selecting suitable feed-stocks and conversion methods. This work presents experimental studies carried out on a compression ignition engine equipped with a novel low volume fuel system. This system was designed and manufactured so as that several series of single-molecule fuels, and also binary fuel mixtures, could be tested to investigate the effect of fuel molecular structure on combustion and emissions. Features of fuel molecular structure that were studied include: alkyl chain length and degree of saturation, double bond position and isomerisation and the fatty acid ester alcohol moiety. The interactions between cyclic molecules and $n$-alkanes were also studied, as was the potential of carbonate esters and terpenes as future sustainable fuels; the latter produced from <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>micro-organisms.</b> The engine tests were carried out at constant injection timing and they were repeated at constant ignition timing and at constant ignition delay, the latter being achieved through the addition to the various fuels of small quantities of ignition improver (2 -ethylhexyl nitrate). In tests conducted at constant injection and constant ignition timing the ignition delay of the molecule was found to be the primary driver of combustion phasing, the balance between premixed and diffusion-controlled combustion and, thereby, exhaust emissions. The various features of molecular structure were found to influence the duration of ignition delay, and an effect of interactions of binary fuel mixtures was also visible. Physical properties, such as viscosity, impacted on the production of exhaust emissions, and in extreme cases also influenced combustion phasing and heat release...|$|R

Standard population measurements, assessing the survival, dissemination and effect on total indigenous populations do not give {{an indication of the}} functioning of the ecosystem. A range of soil enzyme assays have been developed as alternatives to population measurements. Assays for determining chitobiosidase, N-acetyl glucosaminidase, beta-glucosidase, beta-galactosidase, acid phosphatase, alkaline phosphatase, phosphodiesterase, aryl sulphatase and urease activities from small soil samples were developed. These assays were employed {{to assess the impact of}} microbial inoculation into the rhizosphere of crop plants and compared to traditional microbial population measurements. The impact of a chromosomally modified Pseudomonas fluorescens (SBW 25) in the wheat rhizosphere using a large intact core microcosm was studied with a combined substrate addition of urea, colloidal chitin and glycerophosphate. The substrate addition caused an increase in the soil chitobiosidase, N-acetyl glucosaminidase aryl sulphatase and urease activities but did not affect acid and alkaline phosphatase and phosphodiesterase activity. Seed inoculated with P. fluorescens caused significant increases in rhizosphere chitobiosidase and urease activities and a significant decrease in alkaline phosphatase activity. Inoculation with the bacteria in the presence of substrate gave opposing effects to those treatments without substrate addition. Using these enzyme assays perturbations of less than 20 % could be detected. Two strains of Pseudomonas fluorescens were compared in microcosm experiments one with a functional modification of strain F 113 with repressed production of the antibiotic 2, 4 -diacetylphloroglucinol (DAPG), to create the DAPG negative strain F 113 G 22. The other, SBW 25 EeZY 6 KX, with nonfunctional modifications consisting of marker genes (LacZY, xylE and kan') only. Both were assessed, along with the corresponding wild types (F 113 and SBW 25), for their effects upon the indigenous microflora, plant growth and rhizosphere soil enzyme activities. Significant perturbations were found in the indigenous bacterial population structure, with the F 113 (DAPG+) strain causing a shift towards slower growing colonies (K strategists). The DAPG+ strain also significantly reduced, in comparison with the other inocula, the total Pseudomonas populations. The survival of the F 113 strains were an order of magnitude lower than the SBW 25 strains. The DAPG+ strain caused a significant decrease in the shoot to root ratio in comparison to the control and other inoculants. The F 113 (DAPG+) inocula resulted in higher alkaline phosphatase, phosphodiesterase and aryl sulphatase activities than the other inoculants and lower beta glucosidase, beta galactosidase and N-acetyl glucosaminidase activities. These results indicate that the soil enzymes are extremely sensitive to perturbations in the rhizosphere ecosystem and are sensitive enough to measure the impact of GMM inoculation.

Questionnaires were mailed to 400 randomly selected farmers, and 156 were returned. The 134 respondents who reported that they planned to plant crops in 2003 {{were asked to provide}} information about gender, age, education, and number of tillable acres farmed. Respondents were also asked if they had previously planted <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> crops and if they planned to plant either <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> corn or <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> soybeans in 2003. Finally, respondents were presented with 40 statements that pertained to biotechnology and <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> crops, and they were asked to record their level of agreement or disagreement with each statement using a 5 -point Likert scale. Factor analysis was used to construct four factors from responses to the 40 statements that pertained to biotechnology and <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> crops. Items that loaded into the first factor indicated that McLean county farmers perceived agricultural biotechnology to be acceptable and beneficial, and their perspectives of biotechnology were much broader than the economic impacts on their own farms. The second factor revealed that McLean County farmers' cropping decisions had been affected to some degree by events such as the StarLink corn case that had cast a negative shadow over biotechnology. The third factor reflected direct benefits of <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> crops to farm operations, specifically higher yields and profits. The fourth factor included increased regulation of <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> crops in international markets and lower prices for <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> crops, which were potentially negative factors in the marketing of <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> crops. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to classify respondents according to past and planned experiences with <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> crops. When weighted factor scores from the four factors were used as independent variables, 100 % of farmers who had planted <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> crops in the past, 98. 4 % of farmers who planned to plant <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> crops in 2003, and 100 % of farmers who had not discontinued planting <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> crops were correctly classified. On the other hand, only 62. 5 % of farmers who had not planted <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> crops in the past, 60. 0 % of farmers who planned to not plant <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> crops in 2003, and 60. 0 % of farmers who had discontinued planting <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> crops were correctly classified. When the highest loading items from each of the four factors were used as independent variables, classification of farmers who had planted <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> crops in the past, farmers who planned to plant <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> crops in 2003, and farmers who had not discontinued planting <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> crops were little changed. However, correct classification of farmers who had not planted <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> crops in the past dropped from 62. 5 % to 50 %, correct classification of farmers who had planned to not plant <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> crops in 2003 dropped from 60. 0 % to 20. 0 %, and correct classification of farmers who had discontinued planting <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> crops dropped from 60 % to 0 %. Additional information about farmers' age, education, and farm size increased the explanatory power of models only modestly. Inspection of regression coefficients revealed that increases in Factor 1 scores, which were dominated by positive aspects of biotechnology from a macro perspective, were associated with increases in odds ratios for having planted <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> crops in the past, having planned to plant <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> crops in 2003, and having continued planting <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> crops. Alternatively, increases in Factor 2 scores, which were dominated by negative perceptions of <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> seeds and crops, were associated with increases in odds ratios for having planned to not plant <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> crops in 2003, and having discontinued planting <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> crops. Factor 3 scores, which were dominated by micro benefits to farmers, were associated with increases in odds ratios for having planned to plant <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> crops in 2003, and having continued planting <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> crops. Results for two individual items that were significant, namely "as a consumer, I am satisfied with the benefits of biotechnology," and "restrictions on saving GM seed affect my GM crop planting decisions," were consistent with results for weighted factor scores. Greater agreement with the former statement was associated with increases in odds ratios for having planted <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> crops in the past, and having planned to plant <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> crops in 2003. Greater agreement with the latter statement was associated with increases in odds ratios for having planned to not plant <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> crops in 2003 and having discontinued planting <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> crops. biotechnology, <b>genetically</b> <b>modified,</b> corn, soybeans, Research and Development/Tech Change/Emerging Technologies, Q 16,...|$|R

Using a nationwide survey and choice-modeling framework, {{results indicate that}} consumers value the label "contains no <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> corn" the most with a mean willingness to pay of 20 more cents, followed by "USDA approved <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> corn" with a mean willingness to pay of 9 more cents, and "corn <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> to reduce pesticide residues in your food" with a mean willingness to pay of 7 more cents. Results also suggest that consumers negatively value the labels "contains <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> corn" with a mean willingness to pay of 13 less cents and "may contain <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> corn" with a mean willingness to pay of 2 less cents.

40|$|When {{individuals}} have limited information and are uncertain {{about the quality}} of a good, government policy, or the lack thereof, can serve as a signal to consumers about the likelihood of realizing alternatives states of nature. In this paper, we focus on a controversial beliefs about government intervention: the market for <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> food. Data from a mail survey were used to estimate an econometric model where beliefs about labeling policy, beliefs about the safety of <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> food, and willingness to consume <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> food are endogenously determined. Results indicate that consumers who believe the government has a mandatory labeling policy for <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> food are more likely to believe <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> food is unsafe than consumers who believe no such policy is in place.

40|$|New {{discoveries in}} {{biotechnology}} nowadays allow us treating the so-far incurable diseases with creating <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> organisms. Although {{the use of}} <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> organisms can bring us benefits, the genetic engineering still raises a lot of moral questions. Schools are not systems isolated from social problems {{that come with the}} use of the <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> organisms. They take a more or less neutral position towards those organisms. Teachers with their work and attitude have an important influence on the behavior of the students. In some cases teacher is the only source of information about <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> organisms. That is what I decided to investigate in my diploma thesis: how knowledge and interest influence the position that students take towards the <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> organisms. On the basis of questionnaire of Šorgo et al. (2011 b) we prepared a poll, which was tested in the eight and ninth grade of a primary school. Results of our survey have shown that students who have more knowledge about <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> organisms have higher interest for learning about those organisms. It has been discovered that older students have higher interest for learning about <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> organisms than younger students. Survey also showed that girls expres higher interest for learning about <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> organizms. We believe that the teacher with her or his attitude and with the chosen teaching methods can importantly influence the formation of student's perception of the <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> organisms. The perception will be based on the risk assessment of the use of the <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> organisms. ...|$|R
