5000|$|Fernandez v. California {{is governed}} by two cases: The 1974 case United States v. Matlock and the 2005 case Georgia v. Randolph. In Matlock the U.S. Supreme Court laid out the {{so-called}} [...] "co-occupant consent rule". This rule means that anyone who has “common authority” over the home can consent to {{a search of the}} home. The Supreme Court defined [...] "common authority" [...] as “mutual use of the property by persons generally having <b>joint</b> <b>access</b> or control for most purposes, so that it is reasonable to recognize that any of the co-inhabitants has the right to permit the inspection in his own right and that the others have assumed the risk that one of their number might permit the common area to be searched.” In essence the court decided that any one person who is a “joint occupant” can consent to a police search of the shared residence, without a search warrant. In Georgia v. Randolph the Court limited the holding of Matlock. In Randolph the court decided that when co-occupants who are disagreeing whether to let the police search their dwelling the police can't conduct a search, if a “physically present” co-occupant objects that search.|$|E
50|$|In Bulgaria, {{there are}} {{significant}} links between media owners and other actors operating in the economic landscape. According to expert Nelly Ognyanova, there are unregulated links between media, money and power. This fact became publicly known following a <b>joint</b> <b>access</b> to information request submitted by 11 biggest newspapers in 2010, which revealed that a media group owning newspapers, internet outlets and a TV station borrowed {{large amounts of money}} from a big bank, the Corporate Trade Bank. Also, the information disclosed showed that the same bank hosted a considerable amount of budget money of several ministers as well as bank accounts of relevant state-owned companies operating in the field of energy, public transport, defence and information service. The owner of such media group, Delyan Peevsky, also runs businesses in other sectors, such as construction, tobacco and newspapers distribution. Moreover, his businesses are allegedly involved in big public procurements. The group is also connected with the political party, the Movement for Rights and Freedoms (DPS) which has been influential for many years. Mr. Peevsky is the son of Irena Krasteva, the owner of many of the print media outlets within the New Media Group. Bulgarian press revealed the existence of connections between the New Media Group and political parties and other businesses. This is not the only case of political influence over the media in Bulgaria. For instance, there are some media which are officially owned by political figures or parties, a case that is not prohibited by law in Bulgaria.|$|E

40|$|In this {{sequel to}} [1], we propose <b>joint</b> <b>access</b> control and {{receiver}} optimization for integrated real-time/non real-time CDMA systems, for various receiver implementation scenarios. The access control gives {{priority to the}} real-time users while non real-time traffic is scheduled for transmission such that all users can achieve their target SIRs by choosing appropriate transmit powers and receiver filter coefficients. The proposed <b>joint</b> <b>access</b> control and receiver adaptation algorithm involves real-time traffic activity prediction, optimization of filter coefficients every time the interference pattern changes and data scheduling according to the power control feasibility.

In this paper, we investigate a QoS-aware <b>joint</b> <b>access</b> control and duty cycle control problem for M 2 M communications to optimise the overall network performance, including energy efficiency, end-to-end delay, reliability, throughput and fairness. We first model a practical hybrid M 2 M communication network {{and measure the}} overall network performance through a cost function. Then, an optimisation problem is formulated to minimise the long-term aggregated network cost. Further more, we overcome the non-convexity of the cost function and mathematically derive the optimal access control. Finally, we propose a distributed access control followed by a reinforcement learning (RL) based duty cycle control which adapts to various network dynamics without priori network information. Simulation results show that, the proposed <b>joint</b> <b>access</b> control and duty cycle control minimise the network long-term aggregated cost, while achieving fairness among cluster heads with QoS differentiation...|$|E

40|$|We {{argue that}} <b>joint</b> {{administration}} of <b>access</b> policies for a dynamic coalition formed by autonomous domains requires that these domains {{set up a}} coalition authority that distributes attribute certificates authorizing access to policy objects (e. g., ACLs). Control over the issuance of such certificates is retained by member domains separately holding shares of the joint coalition authority's private key with which they sign the attribute certificates. Hence, any (proper) subset of the member domains need not be trusted to protect the private key. However, application servers that implement <b>joint</b> administration of <b>access</b> policies based on attribute certificates must trust all the signers of those certificates, namely all member domains of the coalition. To capture these trust relations we extend existing access control logics and show that the extensions are sound.

40|$|The secure {{communication}} that multiple OFDMA-based cell-edge mobile stations (MS) can only transmit confidential messages to base station (BS) through an untrusted intermediate relay (UR) is discussed.

We first analyze the challenges in solving this problem. The result indicates that our nonconvex joint power allocation is equivalent to a <b>joint</b> MS <b>access</b> control and power allocation. Then, by problem relaxation and the alternating optimization approach, two suboptimal <b>joint</b> MS <b>access</b> control and power allocation algorithms are proposed. These algorithms alternatively solve the subproblem of joint BS and UR power allocation and the subproblem of MS selection until system sum secrecy rate is nonincreasing. In addition, the convergence and computational complexity of the proposed algorithms are analyzed. Finally, simulations results are presented to demonstrate the performance of our proposed algorithms...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. Includes suppmentary materialThe current notion of seabasing requires that three Battalion Landing Teams (BLT) of a 2025 Joint Expeditionary Brigade (JEB) {{need to be}} able to transit from the Sea Base to the objective within a 10 hour period. Of the three BLTs, two of them must be transported by surface craft a distance of no more than 200 nm in sea state 4 or less. The two surface bound BLTs need to be loaded onto the transporting craft and delivered to shore, whether it is a port facility or austere beachhead. There is no current or future system of connectors to meet all the time-distance, sea state, and interface flexibility requirements for this aspect of seabasing. To meet these requirements a High Speed Assault Connector (HSAC) is needed which either augments current or replaces existing connector platforms to deliver and support the required forces ashore. The <b>Joint</b> <b>ACCESS</b> is a HSAC that brings the necessary speed, payload capacity, interface capability, and mission flexibility needed to fill the Sea Base to shore transportation gap.
