500|$|The {{release of}} a single was soon deemed a [...] "stupid idea" [...] by Cornell and dropped {{in favor of an}} EP or album. The album was {{recorded}} in only 15 days, produced by the band themselves. Gossard described the recording process as a [...] "non-pressure-filled" [...] situation, as there were no expectations or pressure coming from the record company. Eddie Vedder, who had flown up from San Diego to Seattle to audition for Ament, Gossard, and McCready to be the singer of a band initially billing themselves as Mookie Blaylock (so named for a basketball player but eventually settling on Pearl Jam), was at one of the Temple of the Dog rehearsals and ended up providing backing vocals. [...] "Hunger Strike" [...] became a duet between Cornell and Vedder. Cornell was still figuring out the vocals at practice when Vedder stepped in and filled in the blanks singing the low parts because he saw it was hard for Cornell, as Cornell later described it: [...] "He sang half of that song not even knowing that I'd wanted the part to be there and he sang it exactly the way I was thinking about doing it, just instinctively." [...] "Hunger Strike" [...] became Temple of the Dog's breakout single; it was also Vedder's first featured vocal on a record. On the 2011 documentary Pearl Jam Twenty, Vedder stated; “That was the first time I <b>heard</b> <b>myself</b> on a real record. It could be one of my favorite songs that I’ve ever been on — or the most meaningful.” ...|$|E
2500|$|From 1919 he made 35 piano rolls (12 {{of which}} were his own compositions), for the American Piano Company (Ampico)'s {{reproducing}} piano. According to the Ampico publicity department, he initially disbelieved that a roll of punched paper could provide an accurate record, so {{he was invited to}} listen to a proof copy of his first recording. After the performance, he was quoted as saying [...] "Gentlemen—I, Sergei Rachmaninoff, have just <b>heard</b> <b>myself</b> play!" [...] For demonstration purposes, he recorded the solo part of his Second Piano Concerto for Ampico, though only the second movement was used publicly and has survived. He continued to record until around 1929, though his last roll, the Chopin Scherzo in B-flat minor, was not published until October 1933.|$|E
2500|$|After hearing Vedder's tape, former Mother Love Bone members Stone Gossard and Jeff Ament invited Vedder {{to come to}} Seattle to {{audition}} for their new band. They were instantly impressed with his unique sound. At the time, Gossard and Ament {{were working on the}} Temple of the Dog project founded by Soundgarden's Chris Cornell as a musical tribute to Mother Love Bone's frontman Andrew Wood, who died of a heroin overdose at age 24. Soundgarden drummer Matt Cameron and newcomer Mike McCready were also a part of the project. The song [...] "Hunger Strike" [...] became a duet between Cornell and Vedder. Cornell later said of Vedder that [...] "he sang half of that song not even knowing that I'd wanted the part to be there and he sang it exactly the way I was thinking about doing it, just instinctively." [...] Vedder would provide background vocals on several other songs as well. In April 1991, Temple of the Dog was released through A Records. [...] "Hunger Strike" [...] became Temple of the Dog's breakout single; it was also Vedder's first featured vocal on a record. Vedder said about the song in the 2009 book Grunge Is Dead; [...] "I really like hearing that song. I feel like I could be real proud of it – [...] because one, I didn't write it, and two, it was such a nice way to be ushered onto vinyl for the first time. I'm indebted to Chris [...] time eternal for being invited onto that track." [...] On the 2011 documentary Pearl Jam Twenty, Vedder stated; “That was the first time I <b>heard</b> <b>myself</b> on a real record. It could be one of my favorite songs that I’ve ever been on – or the most meaningful.” Vedder and Cornell performed the song together for the last time on October 26, 2014 at the Bridge School Benefit.|$|E

60|$|Almost could I tell it in four words. In {{them one}} {{would say that}} it is set forth. There was in London at that time popular a song, a comic, vulgar song of the 'Alls, 'The Cat Came Back'.

6000|$|Roland made no answer, but {{bit his lip}} {{till the}} blood came, and spurring his horse up {{to the side of}} Catherine Seyton's palfrey, he whispered in a low voice, [...] "I never thought to have done aught to deserve you; but this day I have <b>heard</b> <b>myself</b> upbraided with cowardice, and my sword {{remained}} still sheathed, and all for the love of you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Madam," [...] {{answered}} the Greek scholar, [...] "you are entirely correct. This {{has been an}} unfortunate day for me.
