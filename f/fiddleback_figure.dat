5000|$|Red gum is {{so named}} for its {{brilliant}} red wood, which can range from a light pink through to almost black, depending on the age and weathering. It is somewhat brittle and is often cross-grained, making hand working difficult. Traditionally used in rot resistant applications like stumps, fence posts and sleepers, more recently it has been recognised in craft furniture for its spectacular deep red colour and typical <b>fiddleback</b> <b>figure.</b> It needs careful selection, as {{it tends to be}} quite reactive to changes in humidity (moves about a lot in service). It is quite hard, dense (about [...] ), can take a fine polish and carves well. It is a popular timber for wood turners, particularly if old and well-seasoned.|$|E
40|$|The {{wavy grain}} of wood {{expressed}} in <b>fiddleback</b> <b>figure</b> usually enhances its commercial value. The goal {{of this study was}} to analyse <b>fiddleback</b> <b>figure</b> and other log characteristics in sycamore maple (Acer pseudoplatanus L.) and their contribution to the price of the timber. We studied sycamore maple logs at the annual auction of the highest quality wood assortments in Slovenj Gradec, Slovenia. Measurements were performed on the logs and wavy grain was analysed in 2013. In addition, data were used on logs auctioned between 2007 and 2012. Using the data collected at the auction in 2013 and a binary logistic regression model, the original sample was expanded considerably. The percentage of fi ddleback maple was 7. 4 % at the auction in 2013. Larger volume of maple logs was on average linked to higher price; however, the presence of <b>fiddleback</b> <b>figure</b> in a log per se did not guarantee above average price. Prices of more than half of the fiddleback figured maple logs at the auction in 2013 were below average. On the other hand, large fiddleback logs achieved the highest prices. Trees with <b>fiddleback</b> <b>figure</b> proved to be evenly distributed throughout the entire population of sycamore maple in Slovenia. The geographic origin of sycamore maple did not influence the occurrence of <b>fiddleback</b> <b>figure.</b> The presented results appear to be representative of the occurrence of <b>fiddleback</b> <b>figure</b> in Acer pseudoplatanus throughout its entire distribution range...|$|E
