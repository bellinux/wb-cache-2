6000|$|I {{cracked the}} whip, {{stirring}} the horses into a quicker pace, and, slipping one arm around her, I said: [...] "It is not {{those who work}} or suffer most who are always rewarded as they would hope to be; and, as Johnston once said, the fallen have done great things. But we will look forward. You made true forecasts that night at Lone <b>Hollow,</b> and no <b>fairer</b> witch ever came out of Lancashire. So look again deep into the future, {{and tell me what}} you see." ...|$|R
5000|$|This {{community}} sits {{near the}} juncture of Big Sugar Creek and Mikes Creek. Powell {{was once a}} thriving community and still retains many remnants of this time. At one time it had multiple general stores, a blacksmith, a gas station, several churches and a watermill. One of its general store buildings still stands and is occasionally in operation as is the Albert E. Brumley and Sons/Hartford Music Company, which has operated out of Powell since the 1940s. Owned and operated by the late gospel composer Albert E. Brumley, the hymn and songbook publishing operation is now run by his son Robert Brumley. Albert E. Brumley's best known song, [...] "I'll Fly Away (hymn)" [...] has been recorded by multiple Grammy Award winning musicians and even inspired {{the name of a}} television series. Brumley also started an annual, though now defunct, Hill and <b>Hollow</b> craft <b>fair</b> and concert in a field next to his house in Powell. Through the years such celebrities as Minnie Pearl and Grandpa Jones, of country music and Hee Haw fame, performed at the venue. Brumley, along with his wife, the former Goldie Schell, are buried in Fox Cemetery just outside Powell, along with other local pioneers.Several older structures still exist in the community, but are no longer in use, such as the First Baptist Church building, the Hill and Hollow exhibit hall and an old gas station.|$|R
60|$|That {{same night}} Victor half awoke and growled. He seldom awoke {{of his own}} accord. Nature had so {{arranged}} it that parents, or comrades, usually {{found it necessary to}} arouse him with much shouting and shaking--not unfrequently with kicks. But there was a more powerful influence than parents, comrades, or kicks at work that night. Being tired and sleepy, the party had carelessly made their beds in a <b>hollow.</b> It was <b>fair</b> when they lay down. Soon afterwards, a small but exceedingly heavy rain descended like dew upon their unprotected heads. It soaked their blankets and passed through. It soaked their garments and passed through. It reached their skins, which it could not so easily pass through, but was stopped and warmed before being absorbed. A few uneasy turns and movements, with an occasional growl, was the result--nothing more. But when the density of the rain increased, and the crevices in the soil turned into active water-courses, and their hollow became a pool, Victor became, as we have said, half-awake. Presently he awoke completely, sat up, and scratched his head. It was the power of a soft and gentle but persistent influence triumphantly asserted.|$|R
