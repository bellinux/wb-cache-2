40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{we present}} another {{case study in}} the general project of proof mining which means the logical {{analysis}} of prima facie non-effective proofs {{with the aim of}} extracting new computationally relevant data. We use techniques based on monotone functional interpretation developed in Kohlenbach (Logic: from Foundations to Applications, <b>European</b> Logic <b>Colloquium</b> (Keele, 1993), Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1996, pp. 225 – 260) to analyze Cheney's simplification (Math. Mag. 38 (1965) 189) of Jackson's original proof (Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 22 (1921) 320) of the uniqueness of the best L 1 -approximation of continuous functions f∈C[0, 1] by polynomials p∈Pn of degree ⩽n. Cheney's proof is non-effective {{in the sense that it}} is based on classical logic and on the non-computational principle WKL (binary König's lemma). The result of our analysis provides the first effective (in all parameters) uniform modulus of uniqueness (a concept which generalizes ‘strong uniqueness’ studied extensively in approximation theory). Moreover, the extracted modulus has the optimal ϵ-dependency as follows from Kroó (Acta Math. Acad. Sci. Hungar. 32 (1978) 331). The paper also describes how the uniform modulus of uniqueness can be used to compute the best L 1 -approximations of a fixed f∈C[0, 1] with arbitrary precision. The second author uses this result to give a complexity upper bound on the computation of the best L 1 -approximation in Oliva (Math. Logic Quart., 48 (S 1) (2002) 66 – 77) ...|$|R

This is a study of such a context. This article attempt also to increase the understanding of efforts of managing intra organizational networks for knowledge integration.

The study involves a comparative study of five managed networks, two networks set up for preventing accidents, one for occupational hygiene, and two within the area of psychological well-being. In this paper we ground tree displayed practices for organizational learning in a context of managed Networks of Practice, and discuss their characteristics and implications. Using a cultural perspective, we also suggest that all three of them have new awareness as the a coordination mechanisms build into them.

40|$|Session 1 : Governance in the European UnionThis book {{argues that}} a third wave of {{research}} on the EU is needed to adequately understand the increased interconnectedness between the European and national political levels. We posit that this third wave should be sensitive to the temporal dimension of European integration and Europeanization. In particular, we seek to link the processes of Europeanization and European integration in a new way by asking the question: how has Europeanization affected current modes of integration and cooperation in the EU? Preparing the ground for the third wave, {{the first part of the}} book concerns Europeanization. In order to fully understand the feedback of Europeanization on cooperation and integration it is important to analyze how European integration has had an impact on member states in the first place, in particular indirectly, beyond the direct mechanism of compliance with European policies. The research presented here stresses the role which domestic actors and in particular governments have in guiding the Europeanization impact on the member states. The second part of the book concerns integration and cooperation, in line with what we see as a third wave of research. Here we analyze how prior integration effects, that is Europeanization, influences current preferences for integration. We find that earlier integration effects have had a significant influence on those preferences, resulting however, somewhat surprisingly not always for a preference for closer integration. The multi-faceted interrelationships between the EU level and the national level and the increased interconnectedness between them cast doubt on the appropriateness of traditional readings of central concepts of political science and international relations such as territory, identity and sovereignty. The final section of the book therefore concerns the conceptual challenges faced by the continued development of multi-level governance. These contributions show that a conceptual reorientation is necessary because up until now these concepts have been almost exclusively linked to the nation state. One of the key findings of the book is the astonishing variation in modes of cooperation and integration in the EU. We suggest that this variation can be explained by taking into account the sources of legitimacy at the national and at the EU level on which cooperation and integration are based. We argue that whereas economic integration, in particular the creation of a single market, could be sufficiently backed by output legitimacy, deeper integration in other areas requires a degree of input legitimacy that is currently lacking in the EU. Therefore, non-economic integration is often taking the form of looser types of cooperation, such as the open method of coordination and benchmarking, allowing domestic actors more control over the Europeanization of these policies onto the member state. We elaborate on this speculation in the conclusion and believe that it should be part of the future research agenda of the third wave of European research. This book emerged from the <b>European</b> Research <b>Colloquium</b> of the Netherlands Institute of Government, in which a small group of researchers from the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium, and Denmark met every 6 months over the past three years to debate substantive topics, the choice of research design and methodology, and, in particular, the empirical research presented by each author in this book...|$|R

We show that probabilistic models should not be used just to infer most probable outcomes, as these would give a fallacious impression of certain knowledge. The possibilistic model produces more uncertainty-laden results which are coherent with model uncertainties and respect elicited values of possibilities.

Natural and synthetic derivatives {{have been described as}} exhibiting several important biological properties, such as anti-tumor [2], anti-inflammatory [3], antioxidant [4] and anticoagulant/antiplatelet activities [5]. Owing to our continuing interest in the synthesis of novel oxygen heterocycles we have recently developed an unique synthetic procedure towards the synthesis of new (E) - 3 -aryl- 4 -benzylidene- 8 -hydroxy- 3, 4 -dihydro- 1 H-xanthene- 1, 9 (2 H) -diones (2) [6].

This is thus a knowledge about emergence of forms such as the scattering of fallows and then forests over abandoned agricultural soils, the growth of a city or of a transport network, or the spreading of a pioneer front in Brazil or Siberia. In order to account for the emergence of spreading or stationary forms, a lot of scientists from other disciplines often refer to a theory simultaneously suggested by Fisher, Kolmogorov, Petrovskii and Piskunov, and usually designated by the acronym FKPP. Numerous papers and books dedicated to this theory and to the models derived from, such as Turing activator-inhibitor model or their generalisation by Meinhardt. As the creation of a chemical, its production and growth in time, is usually obtained by reaction, this theory is generally called « theory of reaction-diffusion ».

40|$|Achieving food {{security}} {{in particular in}} Africa continues to pose a major challenge to humankind. It s clear that the future agricultural potential of Africa plays {{a critical role in}} meeting this challenge. Although crop yield can be estimated with a degree of reliability using a limited sample of ground observations, the exact crop acreage and the spatial distribution are rarely available. Even though remote sensing offers the ability to produce a rapid and up-to-date land use ad land cover database for agricultural monitoring, {{there are only a few}} countries in Africa where higher resolution satellie data such as Landsat have been used for land cover map production at the national level. However a number of global products have been produced which contain information on cropland extent. This paper will outline a comparison of four sources of land cover data to determine which product is the most suitable for agricultural monitoring and for the subsequent develpment of a crop mask. The land cover products used are the Global Land Cover Map (GLC- 2000), the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land cover product (MOD 12 V 1), the SAGE (Center for Sustainability and the Gobal Environment) and the AFRICOVER dataset from the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO). Both the GLC- 2000 and MODS land cover products are at a resolution of 1 km 2 while AFRICOVER, based on visual interpretation of 30 -m resoluton Landsat images, is available at a much finer resolution. The four land cover products are first aggregated to the same resolution so that they can be compared. The legend categories of the four land cover products in this study are reconciled using the method developed in Fritz and See [Fritz, S. and See, L., 2005, Comparison of land cover maps using fuzzy agreement. "International Journal of Geographic Information Science", 19, pp. 787 - 807] and See and Fritz [See, L. M. and Fritz, S., 2005, Auser-defined fuzzy logic approach to comparing global land cover products. In " 14 th <b>European</b> <b>Colloquium</b> on Theoretical and Quanitative Geography", 9 - 12 September 2005, Lisbon, Portugal] that allows overlap between legend definitions to be taken ino account. Once the legend definitions between the different land cover products are reconciled, the maps are then compard with national and sub-national statistics. Analysis is undertaken at both continental and national scales as well as sub-national for Sudan and Eritrea. The study generally concludes that MODIS has the tendency to underestimate cropland cover when compared with FAO statistics or AFRICOVER data, whereas GLC- 2000 tends to overestimate cropland cover in those counries that are located at the northern transition zone of subtropical shrubland and semi-desert areas. In this area MODIS and SAGE show a relatively similar cropland distribution. Even though the SAGE database has been calibrated with national statistics, it does not perform better than the other two datasets overall, and has highlighted the fact that the SAGE data sow regional weaknesses and should be replaced in certain regions by more recent datasets such as GLC- 2000 and MODIS, or idealy by a hybrid product that combines the best of the three products, depending upon the region and country...|$|E

Scarella [2] in order to model social polarization {{in the metropolitan area}} of Marseille (France). The model can be used to infer a trend scenario of social polarization of the 439 municipalities in the metropolitan area of Marseille (France) in a 10 year time. Within the model, a valorized municipality is defined as a municipality where executives and professionals are overrepresented within its resident population; a devalorized municipality is defined as a municipality where the unemployed are overrepresented within its resident population. The initial data for the study area were elaborated for 2009 and are in the Data_Marseille_ 2009. txt file. Other auxiliary files are: - DependentVariables. txt containing the dependency structure of the possibilistic network - VariableModalities. txt containing the values of each variable of the network - VariableModalities_PlainEnglish. txt gives plain English names to variables and modalities, but is not used by the R-script. - ModelStructure. png visualizes the DAG structure of the possibilistic network The network is build using uncertain logical gates ([3], [4]), which are the possibilistic counterpart of the noisy logical gates used in Bayesian networks [2]. More thorough presentations of the model and of the model results are available in [5] and in [6]. Model results and comparison with Bayesian network results can be explored through an interactive data-visualization at the following address: [URL] References [1] Francisco Díez and Marek Druzdzel.

According to Bertin's (1967), this practice reflects the exact application of the visual variable 'size' on the flow feature. Every other aesthetics and semiotic principles - as colored or curvilinear features - can be taken into account without fundamental consequences. This is very popular since earlier flow maps. It even seems to be the unique way to map flow, but is it relevant? Is it obvious that flow mapping raises one dimension of the features while the human eye may perceive several? Assuming that first hypothesis is exact means in fact that the human eye will perceive only one feature's dimension: its width (Fij). Is it really the case? We raise a reasonable doubt about the relevance of this assumption and will examine it in this paper. Our aim is to demonstrate the legitimacy of the conventional approach of flow mapping which leads to the first hypothesis. To do this, we will place us in the theoretical framework defined by Grasland (2009) leading to a joint (analysis of positions and flow. However, the present proposed perspective differs as the analysis is focused on the perceived information on a flow map. Therefore, we'll assume also Bertin's (1967) and Tobler's (1987) cartographic principles for mapping statistical flow data. We will then examine the corresponding cartographic process from two cognitive perspectives, regarding both semiotic and semantic aspects of the feature's flow map. We will explore a set of four assumptions (fig. 1). The fig. 1 describes through assumptions n° 1 to n° 4 what human eye perceived on a flow map and what it means. Firstly: the eye perceives only the feature's width (ass. n° 1). The second assumption suggests the possibility of the perception of the feature's visual area, i. e regarding the amount of color (ass. n° 2). It will lead us in a third assumption to the perceived geometric feature's area, that is to say the arithmetic product of the feature's width and length (ass. n° 3). This theoretical semantic switching is not trivial; it corresponds to the perception of a new dimension: the cartographic distance, derived from the formal 'graphic distance' (Müller, 1979; Tobler, 1997; L'hostis, 2003), that is equal to the feature's length (Lij) perceived on the map. This effective joint perception of (Lij) and (Fij) leads us to introduce geographic space in flow mapping process, considering Tobler's (1969) first law of geography. This seems in other words to integrate the fact that flow values (Fij) are projected over a geographical area, consisting of (i,j) places that are more or less distant (Dij) or close in the reality [...] . The places' remoteness influences the significance of the perceived flow value as well as in a flow map (but not in a plan as a spatialized graph which has no geographic properties). Assuming the fourth hypothesis (ass. n° 4) is exact involves us carrying out a map of movement (Mij) rather than a map of flow (Fij). We demonstrate on selected bilateral international trade flows from Chelem database that if the cartographic construction of (Fij) and (Mij) is the same and unique (ass. n° 1 and n° 4 are equals), they differ only in their interpretation (Fij) C (Mij) for one main raison: at a world scale, flow mapping can only be an approximation of the geographical movement (fig. 2), as was done earlier by Minard (1862) ...|$|E
