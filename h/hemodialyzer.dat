50|$|Over a 66-year career Professor Edward Merrill {{has been}} a pioneer in several fields of bioengineering. In the 1950s and 60s he was the leading {{scientist}} in blood rheology. In the 1960s and 1970s Merrill was {{a pioneer in the}} development of the artificial kidney, analysis of its transport characteristics and optimization of <b>hemodialyzer</b> membranes. In the 1960s-80s he pioneered protein/polymer interaction under stagnant and flow conditions and made exceptional contributions in the development of hydrogels as biomaterials, and in ionic or covalent heparinization techniques on polymer surfaces for antithrombogenic materials. Ed Merrill and Ed Saltzman of Harvard were the pioneers who proposed poly (ethylene oxide) as a highly biocompatible biomaterial in a seminal paper and did significant studies to analyze its stricture and blood response. In the 1990s Ed Merrill and W Harris developed irradiation crosslinked high-density polyethylene (HDPE) that has become the main material for total joint replacement.|$|E
40|$|The {{apparent}} <b>hemodialyzer</b> elimination {{rate constant}} and clearance for gentamicin and tobramycin were determined during 100 routine hemodialysis treatments in 49 patients. Three different dialyzers (CDAK 3500, CF 1211, and CF 1511), which vary in membrane composition, surface area, and thickness, were evaluated. The elimination rate constant in each patient was {{calculated from the}} slope of the log serum concentration-time curves. Two different elimination rate constants for each patient were derived, one during hemodialysis (KT) and one off hemodialysis (K). The <b>hemodialyzer</b> elimination rate constant (KD) for each dialyzer was calculated as the difference between these two values. The <b>hemodialyzer</b> clearance (Cd) was calculated by multiplying the <b>hemodialyzer</b> elimination rate constant by the volume of distribution of the patient. The KDS of gentamicin and tobramycin by the three dialyzers were significantly different. The gentamicin KD of the CDAK 3500 was lower than the values of the CF 1211 and CF 1511 (0. 086 versus 0. 123 versus 0. 131 h- 1, respectively). The Cd of the CDAK 3500 for gentamicin was also significantly lower than that of the CF 1511. Although the CdS of tobramycin for the CF 1211 and CF 1511 were 24 and 43 % greater than that for the CDAK 3500, these differences were not statistically significant. The KD and Cd of tobramycin were greater than those of gentamicin for all three dialyzers. These data demonstrate that commonly used hemodialyzers vary markedly with respect to their elimination and clearance characteristics of gentamicin and tobramycin. Clinically, these observations may be helpful in designing the correct dose of gentamicin and tobramycin to achieve maximum drug safety and efficacy in hemodialysis patients...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the safety and}} potential cost savings of <b>hemodialyzer</b> reuse. DATA SOURCES: All English and French articles published from 1960 to 1991 related to <b>hemodialyzer</b> reuse (retrieved through an Index Medicus and MEDLINE search [corrected]), the indexes of eight North American journals from 1960 onward, conference proceedings, association guidelines, and US and Canadian laws and regulations. RESULTS: For health care personnel the reuse of hemodialyzers did not entail any increased risk of infection or exposure to toxic substances if proper control measures were taken. For patients {{there was no evidence}} to suggest any excess risk of complications or death as long as precise and appropriate procedures are observed. The "first-use syndrome" can be prevented and should no longer be considered as a reason to favour reuse. A cost-minimization analysis indicated that five uses might save up to $ 3629 per patient yearly. Thus, the adoption of a policy of reuse in Canada for all eligible patients undergoing long-term hemodialysis could result in direct savings of about $ 5. 8 to $ 8. 9 million per year. CONCLUSION: The health risks associated with <b>hemodialyzer</b> reuse can be reduced to acceptable levels through the rigorous observance of proper quality-assurance and quality-control measures and the use of automated reconditioning equipment. Such a policy could achieve modest savings for the health care system. A decision to reuse should be formally adopted by the institution and accompanied by a precise definition of the standards of quality assurance and control...|$|E

40|$|Acute haemolysis in {{haemodialysis}} is {{a relatively}} rare complication, but {{it can lead to}} life-threatening issues up to the death of the patient. Due to the lack of measurement methods able to provide a realtime and in-line measurement of the haemolysis in extracorporeal circulation, in current medical practice the haemolysis level is not monitored during haemodialysis. In last two years we proposed a measurement method capable to measure in-line and in real-time the haemolysis level during haemodialysis. Such method is based on the estimation of the filter permeability to haemoglobin. To estimate the filter permeability we proposed two data processing algorithms: one simplified algorithm supposing constant permeability and the other supposing the filter permeability to be a linear function of the time integral of the filtered volume of solvent. However, the constant permeability algorithm is reasonably prone to errors, whereas the algorithm based on the time integral of the solvent volume does not allow the integration of the developed measuring system with <b>hemodialyzers</b> already in use. To overcome such limitation, in this paper we propose a new data processing algorithm based on the time integral of the mass of filtered haemoglobin. Such quantity can be easily estimated by the measuring system, allowing straightforward integration with <b>hemodialyzers</b> already in use. The performed experimental activities indicate as the new data processing algorithm is reasonably able to provide performance equal or better than the previous data processing algorithms...|$|R

Twenty-five chronic stable dialytic patients were studied for six months using their previous standard dialytic treatment (control study period) and then switched to PFD for one year (PFD study period). PFD resulted in a urea Kt/V over 1. 1, high beta 2 -microglobulin removal (120 mg/treatment), shorter dialysis time (180 versus 210 min) and better clinical tolerance. Although PFD caused a small degree of complement activation, granulocyte elastase plasma release and interleukin- 2 soluble receptor, the levels were comparable to those obtained with synthetic membranes, even if modified cellulose was employed in the SG 3 <b>hemodialyzer,</b> suggesting improved biocompatibility.

The dialysate solution concurrently was pumped from a modular fermentor through the <b>hemodialyzer</b> jacket outside of the membranes {{and back into the}} fermentor.

Good qualitative agreement was shown for both methods when suspensions of test organisms were assayed.

40|$|Numerous {{acquired}} hemostatic abnormalities {{have been}} identified in renal insufficiency. Hemodial-ysis procedures add to these disturbances as they repetitively imply turbulent blood flow, high shear stress, and contact of blood to artificial surfaces. This nonphysiological environment leads to acti-vation of platelets, leukocytes, and the coagulation cascade, resulting in fouling of the membrane and ultimately in clotting of fibers and the whole <b>hemodialyzer.</b> Anticoagulation in hemodialysis is targeted to prevent this activation of coagulation during the procedure. Most agents inhibit the plasmatic coagulation cascade. Still commonly used is unfractionated heparin, followed by low-mo-lecular-weight heparin preparations with distinct advantages. Immune-mediated heparin-induced thrombocytopenia constitutes a potentially life-threatening complication of heparin therapy requir-ing immediate switch to nonheparin alternative anticoagulants. Danaparoid, lepirudin, and argatro-ban are currently being used for alternative anticoagulation, all of which possess both advantages and limitations. In the past, empirical strategies reducing or avoiding heparin were applied for patients at bleeding risk, whereas nowadays regional citrate anticoagulation is increasingly used to prevent bleeding by allowing procedures without any systemic anticoagulation. Avoidance of clotting within the whole <b>hemodialyzer</b> circuit is not granted.

40|$|Effects of {{a reduced}} inner {{diameter}} of hollow fibers in <b>hemodialyzers.</b> BackgroundThe clearance of middle molecules in high-flux <b>hemodialyzers</b> {{is due to}} the higher contribution of convection in the overall solute transport. Although net filtration can be maintained low by the machine control, internal filtration in the proximal part of the dialyzer remains high. The final fluid balance is achieved by significant amounts of backfiltration in the distal part of the dialyzer. To increase further middle molecule clearance (MMK), hemodiafiltration has been used. This technique, however, requires complex machines and large amounts of substitution fluid. We present a novel solution to increase the convective transport of middle molecules in high flux dialyzers without the need for substitution fluids. In particular, high-flux dialyzers with a reduced hollow fiber diameter are compared with standard dialyzers in terms of internal filtration and solute clearances. MethodsHemodialyzers with 175 μ inner diameter polysulfone fibers were compared with standard 200 μ polysulfone hollow fiber dialyzers. The study was carried out in vitro using a previously published method to measure internal filtration and backfiltration rates. The method is based on the detection by a γ camera of segmental variations in concentration {{along the length of the}} dialyzer of a nondiffusable Tc 99 -labeled marker molecule injected in the blood in vitro circuit. At the same time, pressures were detected in the blood and dialysate compartment. The system was operated at zero net filtration maintaining volumetrically constant both dialysate and blood circuits. In vivo clearances were also measured for solutes with different molecular weight. ResultsThe pressure drop in the blood compartment at 300 mL/min of blood flow passed from 112 to 159 mm Hg. At the same blood flow, the internal filtration-backfiltration rates increased from 23. 1 to 48. 2 mL/min. This resulted in a significant increase of in vivo in clearances of vitamin B 12 and inulin of more than 30 %. Urea, creatinine, and phosphate clearance did not display any change. ConclusionsA reduction of the inner diameter of the hollow fibers in high-flux dialyzers may result in a significant increase of the blood compartment resistance. In turn, this results in increased rates of internal filtration and backfiltration. The practical effect in clinical dialysis is demonstrated on middle molecules. While, in fact, the clearances for small solutes such as urea and creatinine are not affected, the clearances of larger solutes such as vitamin B 12 or inulin increase significantly (P < 0. 01) ...|$|R
40|$|Prediction {{of changes}} in patient {{chemistries}} {{as a result of}} a hemodialysis has been difficult due to 1) the different physical characteristics of the many types of <b>hemodialyzers,</b> 2) intra-patient and interpatient variations of blood flow through the devices, 3) differing body weights among the patient population, 4) variability of the predialysis body chemical composition of the patients, 5) unknown mass transfer characteristics of chemical substances between the blood and other body fluid compartments in the patients, and 6) variations in the duration of dialysis. One or more of these factors has hindered attempts by Blackmore and Elder [1], Wolf et al [2] and others to accurately predict the results of dialysis in vivo. Recently Wolf, Watson, and Barbour [3] have shown that one can use mathematical models to predict the chemical changes of urea and creatinine in the body fluids of the uremic patient during dialysis with a Kiil type dialyzer. All that needs to be specified is the weight of the patient, the duration (hours) of dialysis, and the average rate of blood flow into the device.

40|$|Hemodialyzer: From macro-design to {{membrane}} nanostructure; {{the case}} of the FX-class of hemodialyzers. Very few innovations have characterized the different components of the hemodialyzers in the past 20 years. Most improvements have concerned membrane biocompatibility. In this article, we focus our attention on the most recent advances in <b>hemodialyzer</b> components from the macro design of the unit to the nanostructure of the membrane. For this purpose, we took as an example the FX class of hemodialyzers (FMC, Bad Homburg, Germany). The studied devices were chosen as an example representing some of the most recent hemodialyzers and are well suited to describe technical innovations occurring in the field of dialyzer technology. In vitro and in vivo studies were performed to characterize hemodynamic parameters of three models (1. 4 - 1, 8, and 2. 2 m 2) and to determine membrane permeability, sieving coefficients, and solute clearances. The units were characterized by a relatively high resistance of the blood and dialysate compartments, leading to an increased internal filtration if compared with similar hemodialyzers of other series. Nevertheless, the flow distribution in both compartments was homogeneous and well balanced. This effect was obtained by the improved blood and dialysate ports design, the increased packing density of the fibers and a reduction of the inner diameter of the fibers from 200 to 180 μm. At the same time, the sieving coefficients for middle-large solutes such as β 2 microglobulin and insulin were higher than those observed in standard high flux dialysers. The same effect was noted for the clearance values of these solutes. This was observed in the absence of significant albumin leakage. Theis results were obtained thanks to a new nano-controlled spinning technology applied to the fiber. The innermost layer of the membrane is in fact characterized by a homogeneous porosity, with increased number of pores of large dimension but a sharp cutoff of the membrane excluding albumin losses. In conclusion, new technologies and new diagnostic tools today allow for improvement in <b>hemodialyzer</b> design from its macro-componets to its nano-structure.

BackgroundVitamin E–bonded <b>hemodialyzer</b> is known to improve oxidative stress in patients with hemodialysis. However, there is little information available {{as to whether or}} not this membrane clinically improves atherosclerosis. Furthermore, it remains unknown whether there is any effect of the membrane on rheology of circulating red blood cells. MethodWe conducted a randomized, open-labeled, prospective control study (N = 34) for 1 year to investigate the effect of vitamin E–bonded cellulose membrane dialyzer (EE) (N = 17) on carotid atherosclerotic changes [intima-media thickness (IMT) of carotid arteries] and the viscosity, percentage of dysmorphism (%DMR) of red blood cells (RBCs) and their distribution width-standard deviation (RDW-SD), in comparison with cellulose membrane (SU) (N = 17) identical to EE without vitamin E–bonded membrane. Erythropoietin (EPO) dose used for the treatment of uremic anemia was also calculated. ResultsThe IMT significantly decreased in the EE group, while in the SU group the IMT significantly increased. The viscosity of RBCs in hemodialysis patients (4. 70 ± 0. 45 cP) was greater than that in healthy individuals (3. 73 ± 0. 15 cP). EE significantly improved the viscosity (from 4. 84 ± 0. 41 cP to 4. 51 ± 0. 54 cP, P < 0. 01), %DMR (from 2. 29 ± 2. 17 % to 1. 90 ± 1. 49 %, P < 0. 01), and RDW-SD (from 54. 4 ± 7. 6 fL to 49. 3 ± 5. 9 fL, P < 0. 01). On the contrary, these parameters all worsened in the SU group. EPO dose needed for the treatment of anemia was significantly (P < 0. 05) reduced from 5383 ± 2655 U/week to 4235 ± 3103 U/week in the EE group. During these period, mean blood pressure, Kt/V urea, and serum β 2 -microglobulin were not changed between the two groups. ConclusionThese findings suggest that vitamin E–bonded <b>hemodialyzer</b> is very useful for improving atherosclerosis from a clinical point of view. As one of the underlying mechanisms, as well as antioxidant effects, we want to address an important role of the improvement of rheology of circulating RBCs, which may also help to reduce the requirement of EPO dose in the treatment of anemia of ESRD patients...|$|E
40|$|Recombinant hirudin (lepirudin) is {{a potent}} direct {{thrombin}} inhibitor that is used particularly for treatment of immune-mediated heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. Because hirudin is almost exclusively eliminated by the kidneys, its half-life is markedly prolonged in patients with severe renal insufficiency. Therefore, these patients {{are at risk for}} bleeding, particularly because no antidote is available. To use hirudin safely in patients who are on renal replacement therapy, knowledge of hirudin-sieving characteristics of different hemodialyzers is required. Data on this issue are sparse and in part contradictory. Eight different conventional low-flux and high-flux hemodialyzers were tested in an in vitro circuit with ultrafiltrate reinfusion. In each experiment, lepirudin concentration was repetitively measured during 3 h in the prefilter, the postfilter, and the filtration line using a chromogenic assay. On the basis of these data, sieving coefficients were calculated. All high-flux hemodialyzers tested allowed filtration of hirudin yet with marked differences in steady-state sieving (sieving coefficients in whole blood: polysulfone [PS] 0. 97 0. 03; polymethylmethacrylate [PMMA] 0. 75 0. 02; polyarylethersulfone 0. 73 0. 02; polyamide 0. 49 0. 02). None of the low-flux <b>hemodialyzer</b> membranes tested (cuprophane, hemophane, PS, and PMMA) showed significant hirudin filtration.

40|$|Calcium channel {{blockers}} {{correct in}} vitro mitochondrial toxicity of cellulose acetate. We studied {{the action of}} rinse solutions from cellulose acetate <b>hemodialyzers</b> on isolated mitochondria. We showed that concentrates from the rinses impaired the adenosine 5 ′-triphosphate (ATP) synthesis as reflected by the decrease in respiration during state 3 and in P/O ratio. This impairment results from a calcium release from mitochondria that is induced by rinse solution concentrates. The release, triggering the mitochondrial calcium carrier, would explain the decrease in ATP synthesis. Moreover, rinse solution concentrates hinder mitochondrial calcium storage. The rise in cytosolic calcium in hemodialyzed patients may be related, at least in part, to these findings, since a lack of ATP impairs the ATP-dependent cellular calcium-extrusion pumps. We also showed that calcium channel blockers, at therapeutically relevant doses, restore ATP synthesis and calcium storage in mitochondria impaired by rinse solution concentrates. Finally, these in vitro results were confirmed by experiments on cells in culture proving that Diltiazem counteracts the cytotoxicity of rinse solution concentrates. These {{findings are consistent with}} observations that these drugs suppress the increase in leukocyte cytosolic calcium in dialyzed patients.

The compartmental {{distribution of}} the human anaphylatoxins C 3 a and C 5 a has been defined during simulated hemodialysis performed with various types of <b>hemodialyzers.</b> New cuprophan hollow fiber dialyzers were found to activate human complement very readily in vitro, while re-used cuprophan dialyzers displayed only modest complement activating potential. The C 3 a and C 5 a antigens, formed {{as a result of}} complement activation in these dialyzers, accumulated predominantly in the blood path and were not adsorbed extensively on the membrane surface or transported into the dialysate compartment. Cellulose acetate membranes also produced complement activation in vitro, but to a lesser degree than new cuprophan hollow fibers. However, these membranes exhibited a significant capacity to bind the anaphylatoxins to their surface. Polyacrylonitrile membranes appeared to be unique in that they not only failed to activate complement significantly, but they rapidly adsorbed large quantities of C 3 a and C 5 a. These findings demonstrate that hemodialysis membranes may differ with regard to their complement activating potential as well as their ability to remove circulating anaphylatoxins from the blood path. Clinical measurements of anaphylatoxin production during hemodialysis reflect these dynamic events...|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of five plasticizer phthalates in bags and sets for intravenous administration and <b>hemodialyzers</b> (HD), {{which are made}} of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and of other polymeric materials, was investigated. Di-(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) in PVC is the only authorized phthalate by regulatory agencies. Phthalate determination {{was carried out by}} high resolution liquid chromatograph (HPLC) with UV detection. The results showed that the infusion bags that are made of both PVC and ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) contained only DEHP. In contrast, the tubing of infusion sets and of HD (as well as the cellulose capillaries of HD) contained not only DEHP but also dibutyl phthalate (DBP). Moreover, all five investigated phthalates were found in HD polysulfone capillaries. Migration of DEHP into the stored solutions (amino acids, glucose and saline) in bags occurred at different rates from one polymer to another. While DEHP from PVC bags was found in solutions within the first days of contact, the migration from EVA bags started only after approximately 6 months of solution storage. Since PVC and non-PVC devices (as well as capillaries of HD sets) contain DEHP and other phthalate-based plasticizers, the extent of the risk that they pose to patients remains a matter of concern...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The flux of uremic toxin middle {{molecules}} through {{currently used}} hemodialysis membranes is suboptimal, {{mainly because of}} the membranes' pore architecture. Aim: Identifying the modifiable sieving parameters that can be improved by nanotechnology to enhance fluxes of uremic toxins across the walls of dialyzers' capillaries. Methods: We determined the maximal dimensions of endothelin, cystatin C, and interleukin – 6 using the macromolecular modeling software, COOT. We also applied the expanded Nernst-Plank equation to calculate the changes in the overall flux as a function of increased electro-migration and pH of the respective molecules. Results: In a high flux <b>hemodialyzer,</b> the effective diffusivities of endothelin, cystatin C, and interleukin – 6 are 15. 00 × 10 − 10 cm 2 /s, 7. 7 × 10 − 10 cm 2 /s, and 5. 4 × 10 − 10 cm 2 /s, respectively, through the capillaries' walls. In a nanofabricated membrane, the effective diffusivities of endothelin, cystatin C, and interleukin – 6 are 13. 87 × 10 − 7 cm 2 /s, 5. 73 × 10 − 7 cm 2 /s, and 3. 45 × 10 − 7 cm 2 /s, respectively, through a nanofabricated membrane. Theoretical modeling showed that a 96 % reduction in the membrane's thickness and the application of an electric potential of 10 mV across the membrane could enhance the flux of endothelin, cystatin C, and interleukin – 6 by a factor of 25. A ΔpH of 0. 07 altered the fluxes minimally.

40|$|Intravenous {{colistin}} methanesulfonate (CMS) {{is increasingly}} {{the last line}} of defense for multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria and is now being used as “salvage ” therapy in critically ill patients (1, 7, 9, 11). CMS is converted in vivo to colistin, and these two entities have substantially different pharmaco-kinetics, antibacterial activities, and toxicities (7), and there-fore {{it is important to understand}} the dispositions of both. Patients who are currently being treated with CMS include many in the intensive care setting with multiple organ dysfunc-tions and receiving renal replacement therapy (10). Goodwin et al. reported the effects of renal impairment, peritoneal di-alysis, and hemodialysis on the concentrations of CMS in se-rum (3); unfortunately, the microbiological assays employed failed to measure colistin and CMS separately.

40|$|Cuprophan {{hemodialysis}} membranes can be heparinized using N,N 8 -carbonyldiimidazole (CDI) as {{a coupling}} agent. In this study, {{the characteristics of}} heparinized Cuprophan membranes have been evaluated. After immobilization, hep-arin partially retained its biologic activity. An anticoagulant activity of 12. 4 ± 4. 2 mU/cm 2 was measured using a throm-bin inactivation assay. Immobilized heparin also displayed an anti-complement activity. After contact with human se-rum, heparinized Cuprophan induced no generation of sig-nificant amounts of fluid phase terminal complement com-plex (TCC), whereas untreated Cuprophan induced the gen-eration of substantial amounts of TCC. Heparinization {{did not affect the}} permeability of Cuprophan for model solutes with molecular weights up to 12, 000 g/mol except for sul-fobromophthalein sodium salt. The permeability of Cupro-phan for sulfobromophthalein sodium salt was slightly de-creased after heparinization. The ultrafiltration rate of Cu-prophan increased by about 30 % after heparinization, probably owing to an increased swelling of the membrane in water. Heparinized Cuprophan incubated in phosphate-buffered saline at 37 °C showed some release of heparin. These amounts of released heparin, however, were very low as compared to the amounts of heparin which are systemi-cally administered during clinical hemodialysis treatment. It is concluded that Cuprophan membranes heparinized by means of the CDI-activation procedure are highly promising for application in <b>hemodialyzers</b> to be used for the treatment of patients with reduced or without systemic administration of heparin. © 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc...|$|R
40|$|In vivo {{visualization}} of hemodialysis-induced alterations in leukocyte–endothelial interactions. BackgroundThe {{aim of this}} study was to develop a model for hemodialysis (HD) in small animals using conventional dialysis equipment that would allow the intravital microscopic observation of leukocyte–endothelial interactions in vivo. MethodsCuprophan dialyzers were adapted to obtain a similar ratio of membrane area to blood volume as in clinical HD. A silicone ring was inserted into the dialyzer's inlet to limit the number of blood-perfused capillaries. Rabbits were dialyzed for one hour without a dialysate flow. ResultsExtracorporeal circulation with the cuprophan dialyzer resulted in a transient leukopenia and complement activation. At the nadir of leukopenia, leukocytes that rolled along the venular wall were scarcely observed, whereas rolling was abundant (54 ± 9 per min) prior to extracorporeal circulation. The adhesion of leukocytes to the vascular endothelium was not induced. After 60 minutes, rolling of leukocytes was still reduced by 73 ± 5. 5 %, despite the full recovery of circulating leukocyte counts. Extracorporeal circulation without a dialyzer also tended to reduce leukocyte rolling, although systemic leukocyte counts were not affected. ConclusionsThe use of adapted conventional cuprophan <b>hemodialyzers</b> in rabbits yielded a transient leukopenia similar to that in clinical HD. Using intravital microscopy, we demonstrated impairment of leukocyte–endothelial interactions. In addition, our data indicate that tissues, in which leukocytes can roll and adhere, are not automatically sites of leukocyte sequestration during HD-induced leukopenia...|$|R
40|$|To prevent {{pyrogenic}} {{reactions and}} bacteremia in hemodialysis patients, the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation and the Centers for Disease Control recommend culturing of hemodialysis fluids (water and dialysate) {{at least once}} a month. The recommendations for total microbial counts are (i) {{less than or equal to}} 200 CFU/ml in water used to prepare dialysate or reprocess <b>hemodialyzers</b> and (ii) less than or equal to 2, 000 CFU/ml for the dialysate. In accordance with the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation recommendations all cultures should be incubated at 37 degrees C for 48 h on suitable culture media, such as Trypticase soy agar, standard methods agar, or one of several commercially available assay systems. There have been suggestions that lower temperatures and longer incubation might improve the recovery of bacteria from water and dialysate. In this study bacterial recovery from various dialysis fluids (water, bicarbonate dialysate, and bicarbonate concentrate) at 30 and 37 degrees C was compared. Duplicate sets of samples were membrane filtered (pore size, 0. 45 microns); one set was incubated at 30 degrees C and the other was incubated at 37 degrees C for 72 h. The number of visible colonies was counted every 24 h by using a dissecting microscope. No significant difference was observed in specimens incubated at 37 degrees C for 48 h compared with those incubated at 30 degrees C for 72 h. Also, bacterial recovery was significantly better when samples of bicarbonate dialysate or bicarbonate concentrate were plated on Trypticase soy agar as opposed to standard methods agar...|$|R
