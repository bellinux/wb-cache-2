The production data were collected in one of Polish foundries in the form of spectrometer printouts.

The procedure of preparation of the industrial data is presented, including OCR-based method of transformation to the electronic numerical format as well as <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> <b>records</b> related to particular weekdays. The computations for time-series analysis were made using the author’s own software having a wide range of capabilities, including detection of important periodicity in data as well as regression modeling of the residual data, i. e. the values obtained after subtraction of general trend, trend of variability amplitude and the periodical component. The most interesting results of the analysis include: significant 2 -measurements periodicity of percentages of all components, significance 7 -day periodicity of silicon content measured {{at the end of a}} day and the relatively good prediction accuracy obtained without modeling of residual data for various types of expected values.

Esta pesquisa é caracterizada pelo percurso investigativo estudo de caso. A análise focaliza um corpus gerado a partir de observações em sala de aula de base etnográfica em que foram focalizados os usos da LDI por um professor de língua bastante familiarizado com a utilização do computador em sala de aula. A geração de registros ocorreu ao longo de 6 meses (de junho a novembro), no ano de 2012. A partir de uma análise minuciosa das 20 aulas vídeo-gravadas, busquei sistematizar COMO, POR QUE e COM QUAL FINALIDADE a LDI era utilizada. Com base nas práticas do professor observado, me amparei em dispositivos analíticos que me ajudaram a avaliar e sistematizar os modos a partir dos quais se dá a incorporação de artefatos tecnológicos. Para tal, comparei características das fases de incorporação de uso da LDI propostas por Betcher e Lee (2009) aos usos feitos pelo professor aqui focalizado. Além disso, as dinâmicas interacionais e abordagens dialógicas de ensino e, em especial, a interatividade presente em sala de aula foram investigadas. Para isso, me amparei na classificação de tipos de interatividade (nula, autoritária, dialética, dialógica e sinergética) propostas por Beauchamp e Kennewell (2010) e no ensino dialógico proposto por Alexander (2006). A noção de agentividade e a teoria crítica da tecnologia, que considera o contexto social e histórico no qual as tecnologias estão inseridas, foram igualmente importantes no embasamento teórico da pesquisa. Como resultado, pude observar que o professor participante transita entre as fases, com predominância da fase 2, de incorporação da tecnologia propostas na literatura e que há uma sobreposição de práticas, sugerindo que, no contexto investigado, o termo "fases", que prevê a evolução da prática a partir de etapas, não pode ser observado. No tocante à interatividade, detectei que, na interação professor-aprendiz-LDI, a visão instrumentalista de interatividade, que prevê o clique do mouse ou de um botão do teclado, não necessariamente impacta decisões que são tomadas com relação aos rumos da aula e aos caminhos que serão percorridos com o uso do recurso tecnológico. Ao contrário, tais decisões estão embasadas em processos de interação e diálogo que ocorrem durante as aulas por meio da "interatividade dialógica" e a abordagem dialógica de ensino. Esses processos de interação parecem dar voz a docente e aprendizes, ainda que boa parte do controle esteja nas mãos do professor. A partir desta pesquisa, espero contribuir para a reflexão de professores de língua, que utilizam a LDI, quanto à sua prática de sala de aula em um contexto sócio-histórico que tem exigido a inclusão das tecnologias de informação e comunicação (TICs) às atividades de ensino e aprendizagem de línguas. Abstract: This dissertation has {{as primary}} objectives {{to identify and}} to describe some of the uses and possibilities of the Interactive Whiteboard (IWB) by an English teacher of the tertiary education in a countryside city {{in the state of}} São Paulo. This research is characterized by an investigative case study. The analysis focuses on a corpus generated from ethnographic observations in a classroom that uses an IWB by a language teacher who is quite familiar with the use of computers in the focused classroom. The <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> <b>records</b> happened throughout six months (from June to November) in the year 2012. From the detailed analysis of 20 video-recorded lessons, I systematized HOW, WHY and FOR WHAT PURPOSES the IWB was used. Based on the observed teacher¿s practices, analytical instruments were required in order to evaluate and systematize how the incorporation of technological artifacts occurred. To this end, I compared characteristics of the IWB usage with the phases of incorporation of the electronic whiteboard proposed by Betcher and Lee (2009). In addition, I was also concerned with interactional dynamics and in particular, the interactivity and dialogic approach in the classroom. In order to analyze that, I used the classification of types of interactivity (null, authoritarian, dialectical, dialogic and synergistic) proposed by Beauchamp and Kennewell (2010) and the dialogic approach proposed by Alexander (2006). The notion of agentivity and the critical theory of technology that considers the social and historical contexts, in which the technologies are inserted, are equally important to theoretically support this investigation. As a result, I observed that the participant teacher uses the IWB throughout the phases of technology incorporation as proposed by the literature and there is an overlap of practices, suggesting that, in the investigated context, the term "phase", which implies the evolution of the practice from the phases, with emphasis to phase 2, cannot be observed in our research context. Regarding interactivity, the instrumentalist view of interactivity during the teacher-learner-IWB interaction (in which the focus is on `going up to the front¿ and manipulating elements on the board or using the keyboard/mouse) does not necessarily impact decisions made according to the direction of the lesson and the paths that will be covered during the use of the IWB. Opposite to it, these decisions are based on processes of interaction and on dialogue that occur anchored by the IWB, with emphasis to the dialogic interactivity and approach. These interaction processes grounded in a dialogic teaching approach seem to give voice to the teacher and learners, although much of the control is on the teacher¿s hands. I hope to contribute to the reflection of language teachers who use the IWB as to their classroom practice in a socio-historical context that has required the inclusion of information and communication technologies (ICT) to teaching and learning languages...|$|E

The question of how to generate ordered patterns of L 1 0 -FePt NPs and how to transform the technology for practical applications represents a key current challenge. Here the direct synthesis of L 10 phase FePt NPs by pyrolysis of Fe-containing and Pt-containing metallopolymer blend without post-annealing treatment is reported. Rapid single-step fabrication of large-area nanodot arrays (periodicity of 500 nm) of L 10 -ordered FePt NPs can also be achieved by employing the metallopolymer blend, which possesses excellent solubility in most organic solvents and good solution processability, as the precursor through nanoimprint lithography (NIL). Magnetic force microscopy (MFM) imaging of the nanodot pattern indicates that the patterned L 10 phase FePt NPs are capable of exhibiting decent magnetic response, which suggests a great potential to be utilized directly in the fabrication of bit patterned media (BPM) for the next <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> magnetic <b>recording</b> technology.
