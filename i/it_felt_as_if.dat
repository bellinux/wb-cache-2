25|$|The new name, Project Blue Book, was {{selected}} {{to refer to the}} blue booklets used for testing at some colleges and universities. The name was inspired, said Ruppelt, by the close attention that high-ranking officers were giving the new project; <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the study of UFOs was as important as a college final exam. Blue Book was also upgraded in status from Project Grudge, with the creation of the Aerial Phenomenon Branch.|$|E
500|$|Reviewers {{were much}} less pleased with Final Fantasy IX: Uematsu's Best Selection than with the {{original}} soundtrack, finding it to have a [...] "great track listing" [...] but that <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> [...] " [...] tried {{to get as many}} tracks on the disc as they could", with the result that many tracks were cut too short.|$|E
500|$|Tom Derrick {{was widely}} mourned. His widow, Beryl, became {{prostrate}} with grief on hearing of his death; {{many members of}} the Army were affected, with one soldier lamenting <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> [...] "the whole war stopped". By the time Derrick's death was officially announced on 30 May, most Australians on Tarakan had heard the news and rumours had spread claiming that he had been speared or shot at short range by a sub-machine gun.|$|E

500|$|Jefferies {{has since}} given {{his account of}} what happened, and {{revealed}} to the press in 2014 the mental strain the investigation had on his life for over two months. Jefferies said: [...] "At the time <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the police were deliberately playing a game - promising the ordeal would soon be over and then finding it necessary to prolong the wait. It {{was a form of}} psychological torture. At such times the mind plays tricks, and one starts to believe that perhaps one is a criminal without knowing it and that, as in some Kafkaesque nightmare, guilt has been pre-ordained and the sentence is inescapable." ...|$|E
500|$|The game {{received}} [...] "generally favorable" [...] reviews, {{according to}} video game review score aggregator Metacritic. Critics compared Rymdkapsel gameplay to Tetris and SimCity. Of its visual style, The New York Times published {{that the game}} makes others in the real-time strategy genre [...] "feel needlessly garnished". Reviewers generally appreciated the game's simplicity and challenge, but not its brevity and slow start. IGN's Steve Watts thought that the game made too many [...] "design concessions" [...] to its minimalism, though he considered the style [...] "gorgeous", and {{felt that he was}} never fully in control of his base. Eurogamer Tom Bramwell said that the game's minimalism extended to its core gameplay, where the player should strive to [...] "play the game less and less". Joseph Leray of TouchArcade described the game's balance and pacing as [...] "impeccable". He gave Rymdkapsel a perfect score and wrote that <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it were custom-made for iOS. Bryan Vore of Game Informer criticized the game's lack of features and thought that it [...] "fizzled out with no fanfare" [...] as a [...] "creative" [...] idea but without sufficient [...] "polish". The Verges Trent Wolbe called the soundtrack [...] "a minimalist achievement". Jonasson announced that the game had sold 200,000 copies as of December 2, 2013, {{due in large part to}} its inclusion in a Humble Bundle sale.|$|E
500|$|On June 1, 1978, {{following}} the monthly meeting of general {{authorities in the}} Salt Lake Temple, Kimball asked his counselors and the ten members of Quorum of the Twelve Apostles then present to remain behind for a special meeting. Kimball began by describing his studies, thoughts, and prayers on removing the restriction and on his growing assurance that {{the time had come}} for the change. Kimball asked each of the men present to share their views, and all spoke in favor of changing the policy. After all present had shared their views, Kimball led the gathered apostles in a prayer circle to seek final divine approval for the change. As Kimball prayed, many in the group recorded feeling a powerful spiritual confirmation. Bruce R. McConkie later said: [...] "There are no words to describe the sensation, but simultaneously the Twelve and the three members of the First Presidency had the Holy Ghost descend upon them and they knew that God had manifested his will.... I had had some remarkable spiritual experiences before... but nothing of this magnitude." [...] L. Tom Perry described: [...] "I felt something like the rushing of wind. There was a feeling that came over the whole group. When President Kimball got up he was visibly relieved and overjoyed." [...] Gordon B. Hinckley later said: [...] "For me, <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> a conduit opened between the heavenly throne and the kneeling, pleading prophet of God who was joined by his Brethren." ...|$|E

500|$|The 2nd Law was {{primarily}} recorded at AIR Studios in London, England and Eastwest Studios in Los Angeles, California, with additional recording {{taking place at}} Shangri La Studios in Malibu, California and Capitol Studios in Los Angeles. In an interview with Billboard on 18 October 2011, the band's manager Anthony Addis revealed that Muse had begun recording their sixth album in London and that he {{expected it to be}} released by October 2012. Muse bassist Christopher Wolstenholme had stated in an interview with BBC Radio 1 that they had aimed to begin recording The 2nd Law in either September or October 2011. During the recording of the album, band frontman Matt Bellamy jokingly described the album as a [...] "christian gangsta rap jazz odyssey, with some ambient rebellious dubstep and face-melting metal flamenco cowboy psychedelia" [...] on his Twitter account. In an interview with Kerrang! on 14 December 2011, Wolstenholme stated that the next Muse album would be [...] "something radically different" [...] from their prior releases. He also said that <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the band were [...] "drawing a line under a certain period" [...] of their career with their sixth album. In another interview Chris mentioned that the band had experimented with music and sounds in particular. It was revealed via Muse's publicist Tom Kirk on his Twitter account that composer David Campbell was helping the band compose the album. In an interview in the April 2012 issue of NME, Bellamy said that the band were set to include elements of electronic music, with influences coming from acts such as French house duo Justice and UK dance-punk group Does It Offend You, Yeah?.|$|E

2500|$|Following the June 2016 vote {{to leave}} the EU, Corbyn was accused of [...] "lukewarm" [...] {{campaign}}ing for Britain {{to stay in the}} European Union and showing a [...] "lack of leadership" [...] on the issue by several party figures. Alan Johnson, who headed up the Labour In for Britain [...] campaign said “at times" [...] <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> Corbyn's office was [...] "working against the rest of the party and had conflicting objectives". Corbyn's decision to go on holiday during the campaign was criticised.

2500|$|The EL {{served as}} a {{facelift}} of its predecessor, the EF Falcon, which began production in 1994. The [...] "E-series" [...] architecture can trace its roots back to 1988 with the EA. Ford spent million {{for the development of}} the EL. Ford introduced a number of improvements aimed at extending the life of the [...] "E-series" [...] body while the AU Falcon was being developed. Most of the handling and steering problems with the EF were rectified in the EL. Critics at the time stated the EF Falcon was hard to handle and <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the front suspension of the vehicle wasn’t optimally setup to work with the geometry of the live-axle rear end (the AU would be the first Falcon to offer an independent rear end). Ford addressed these concerns making the EL far more responsive than the EF (see below).|$|E
2500|$|The {{investigators}} {{began to}} use force on me, a sick 65-year-old man. I was made to lie face down and beaten on the soles of my feet and my spine with a rubber strap ... For the next few days, when those parts of my legs were covered with extensive internal hemorrhaging, they again beat the red-blue-and-yellow bruises with the strap and the pain was so intense that <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> boiling water was being poured on these sensitive areas. I howled and wept from the pain. I incriminated myself {{in the hope that}} by telling them lies I could end the ordeal. When I lay down on the cot and fell asleep, after 18 hours of interrogation, in order to go back in an hour's time for more, I was woken up by my own groaning and because I was jerking about like a patient in the last stages of typhoid fever.|$|E

60|$|But {{enough of}} Annesley Hall and the poetical themes {{connected}} with <b>it.</b> I <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> I could linger for hours about its ruined oratory, and silent hall, and neglected garden, and spin reveries and dream dreams, until all became {{an ideal world}} around me. The day, however, was fast declining, and the shadows of evening throwing deeper shades of melancholy about the place.

The thing seemed colder and wetter than the water; it was slimy and sticky and horrid. I did not see what it was, and <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> some great sucker-fish, with a cold woolly mouth, was trying to swallow my foot.

The psychic was a young girl, and I am certain played no trick. I could see her feet on the floor, and her finger-tips were, like mine, {{on the top of the}} table.
