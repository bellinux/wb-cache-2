50|$|<b>Fluff</b> <b>pulp</b> (also called {{comminution}} pulp or fluffy pulp) {{is a type}} {{of chemical}} pulp made from long fibre softwoods. Important parameters for <b>fluff</b> <b>pulp</b> are bulk and water absorbency.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fluff</b> <b>pulp</b> {{was first}} {{developed}} {{for use in}} disposable sanitary napkins. Kotex first advertisement for products made with wood pulp (Cellucotton) appeared in 1921. Disposable diaper producers also were early to convert to <b>fluff</b> <b>pulp</b> because of its low cost and high absorbency. Normal usage of <b>fluff</b> <b>pulp</b> in a diaper was about 55 grams. In the 1980s started the commercialization of air-laid paper, which gave better bulk, porosity, strength, softness and water absorption properties compared with normal tissue paper. Also in the 1980s started the use of superabsorbents in diapers and reduced the need for <b>fluff</b> <b>pulp</b> and is now down to 15 grams or even less. The demand of the pulp in diapers has gone from being the absorbent of liquid to giving the products dry and wet strength.|$|E
50|$|The {{worldwide}} {{production of}} <b>fluff</b> <b>pulps</b> amounts to about 3.5 million tons.|$|R
50|$|More than 90% of the <b>fluff</b> <b>pulps</b> {{are fully}} {{bleached}} chemical softwood pulps, of {{which more than}} 90% are kraft pulps.|$|R

It was owned by Kieckhefer Container Company (John W. Kieckhefer) which was merged into Weyerhauser in 1957. In March 2007, Weyerhauser sold its paper interests to Domtar. The paper mill is now a Domtar papermill, while the onsite sawmill is still owned by Weyerhauser. In October 2009, Domtar announced the end of paper machine operations, and the mill will be converted to produce <b>fluff</b> <b>pulp</b> alone, with a 33% workforce reduction to about 360 employees.|$|E
50|$|The {{introduction}} and popularity of these toys {{has followed the}} development of superabsorbent polymers. In the early 1970s, the super absorbent polymer was used commercially {{for the first time}} for disposable hygienic products. The first product markets were feminine sanitary napkins and adult incontinence products. The development of super absorbent technology and performance has been largely led by demands in the disposable hygiene segment. Strides in absorption performance have allowed the development of the ultra-thin baby diaper which uses a fraction of the materials - particularly <b>fluff</b> <b>pulp</b> - that earlier disposable diapers consumed. Over the years, technology has progressed so that there is little if any starch-grafted super absorbent polymer used in disposable hygienic products. These super absorbents typically are cross-linked acrylic homo-polymers (usually sodium neutralized).|$|E
5000|$|Being a {{variation}} of a diaper, the gDiaper design consists of 92% cotton/8% spandex machine-washable outer [...] "gPants," [...] a machine-washable, water-resistant snap-in pouch, and an absorbent inner pad. For absorbency either reusable cloth (gDiapers' Cloth Insert or other options) or a flushable, compostable (wet-only) Disposable Insert can be used. The disposable insert contents include Chlorine-free farmed tree <b>fluff</b> <b>pulp</b> and sodium polyacrylate. When ready {{to dispose of the}} disposable insert, the user tears along the perforation to allow the fluff mixture contents to be emptied into a toilet before dropping in the outer teabag-like containment, stirs the contents to encourage it to break up, then flushes the insert. The wet-only Disposable Inserts can alternatively be home composted; inserts with fecal material should be flushed or disposed of through standard waste collection. The outer pant features back closure to prevent infants and toddlers from removing the diaper themselves.|$|E
5000|$|These early diapers were bulky, heavy {{products}} {{composed of}} <b>fluff</b> <b>pulp</b> with a rayon topsheet, polyethylene backsheet. In 1966, Pampers launched a 'wingfold' design and by 1969 started a [...] "third size". By this time, Pampers {{had become a}} national brand in the United States. Procter and Gamble replaced the pin-on design with tapes in 1971. Toddler and Premature Infant sizes were also introduced. In 1973, P&G developed elasticized single and double gussets around the leg and waist areas to aid in fitting and in containing urine or stool which had not been absorbed. In fact, the first patent {{for the use of}} double gussets in a diaper was in 1973 by P&G. In 1982, Pampers introduced an elasticized wingfold diaper with elastic leg gathers and refastenable tapes which was a cross between the early 1960s design and the modern hourglass shape, a feature that was first introduced on Luvs in 1976 and evolved into an industry standard in 1985. [...] In 1986, thin diapers made with absorbent gelling material were released. This made the average weight of a typical medium size diaper decrease by 50%. [...] In 1987, Pampers and Huggies both introduced frontal tape systems which allow repositioning of the lateral tape without tearing the diaper. In the 1990s Pampers introduced a thinner diaper known as Ultra Dry Thins.|$|E
40|$|<b>Fluff</b> <b>pulp</b> {{has been}} one of the key {{components}} of hygienic products, such as diapers, for many years. <b>Fluff</b> <b>pulp</b> is dry defibrated and air-laid into the absorption core of diapers. The introduction of superabsorbent polymers (SAPs) in the 1980 s decreased the dependence on <b>fluff</b> <b>pulp,</b> as the SAPs became the main absorbing material. Nevertheless, in order to decrease reliance on oil-based SAPs, it is important to investigate <b>fluff</b> <b>pulp</b> once again. This thesis investigates possibilities for modifying <b>fluff</b> <b>pulp</b> for use in absorption applications. In the first part of the thesis, softwood kraft pulp fibres were modified with a diepoxide in order to introduce cross-links into the fibre wall. Results show that the wet bulk under load of the low-density fibre networks increased as a result of the modification, most likely due to higher fibre stiffness. When the fibre networks were dried after the compression test, the low-density networks with the more extensively modified fibres also regained much of their bulk. In the second part of the thesis, a softwood kraft pulp and a birch kraft pulp were alkali extracted at 3 different concentrations of NaOH (2 %, 4 % and 8 % NaOH in suspension). The extraction was done in order to remove hemicelluloses from the fibre walls. The pulps were then dried in sheet form. Sheets were also dry defibrated and air-laid to investigate the performance of the pulps in <b>fluff</b> <b>pulp</b> applications. It could be seen that the extent of hornification of the once-dried fibres increased with increasing concentration of NaOH. Further, the tensile strength index of the sheets increased when the fibres were treated with 2 % NaOH, and decreased at the two highest concentrations. The birch pulp treated with 8 % NaOH had a low amount of knots after defibration. This was related to the low tensile strength index of that pulp, indicating an importance of fibre-fibre bond strength on ease of defibration. The network strength of dry defibrated and air-laid softwood pulp treated with 8 % NaOH was lower than the softwood pulps treated with 0 %, 2 % and 4 % NaOH, which was most likely an effect of the high curl index of that pulp. The network strength of the birch pulps was lower than in the softwood pulps. The network strength of the birch pulps also correlated well with the amount of knots in the pulps...|$|E
40|$|Stiffer fibres with {{improved}} resilience {{could lead to}} improvements for example in the <b>fluff</b> <b>pulp</b> area. <b>Fluff</b> <b>pulp</b> in absorbent products often collapse in a wet state at repeated insults. The products are also compressed for ease of handling and lowering the shipping costs. An increase in stiffness as well as spring back could solve the collapse problem and make the fibres spring back better after the compression, leading to better products. Two methods were used to improve these properties, crosslinking of the fibre wall using Butanetetracarboxylicacid (BTCA) and loading the lumen with TiO 2. Wet stiffness was improved for unbeaten fibres, both from laboratory made sheets and machine made sheets, when BTCA was added. For the beaten pulp, {{the shape of the}} fibres may explain why these fibres did not exhibit improvements in wet stiffness. No improvements in spring back could be seen for any of the tested fibres. The lumen loaded fibres gained a higher density due to the TiO 2 treatment and since the samples were tested on a weight basis, a good comparison could not be done. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|E

40|$|Cross-linked <b>fluff</b> <b>pulp</b> fibers for use in, for example, {{acquisition}} layers in absorption {{products can}} be found in the patent literature. Cross-linking improves properties such as the wet resilience of <b>fluff</b> <b>pulp</b> fiber networks. Among the more commonly seen cross-linkers are polycarboxylic acids, such as 1, 2, 3, 4 -butanetetracarboxylic acid (BTCA). These acids form ester bonds with the hydroxyl groups in the fiber wall. In this study, softwood kraft pulp fibers were cross-linked with BTCA. The swelling behavior of the fibers and properties related to acquisition in absorption products were studied. It was found that the water retention value (WRV) decreased as a consequence of the introduced cross-linker. After deprotonization of a large part of the introduced carboxylic acids, the WRV increased, but the cross-linker was still able to limit significant swelling of the fiber wall. The wet bulk under load of fiber networks, composed of cross-linked fibers, generally increased with a decrease in WRV. Furthermore, it was found that the property development obtained after a cross-linking reaction with BTCA may be predicted by introducing a relative reaction intensity, RIrel, that takes into account both time and temperature in the curing step. This shows that the time and temperature in the curing step are interchangeable...|$|E

40|$|The {{incorporation}} of cellulosic fibers into polyethylene matrices was studied in this work, by dispersion of <b>fluff</b> <b>pulp</b> from maritime pine {{in a hot}} polymer solution, followed by co-precipitation of the solid components by cooling at room temperature. The above method was found suitable for proper wetting and dispersion of fibers in the polymeric matrix, as compared with melt compounding. Unmodified low density polyethylene [LDPE], modified LDPE with maleic anhydride grafted {{linear low density polyethylene}} [M-LLDPE] and a copolymer of acrylic acid and n-butyl acrylate polyethylene [(AA/n-BA) -LDPE], were used as matrices for the preparation of fiber reinforced composites. The thermal properties of these composites were determined using differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetric analysis. The {{incorporation of}} cellulosic fibers results in a decrease of the crystallinity of the polymer matrix, as they act as inert material.

40|$|The {{importance}} of hemicelluloses for the papermaking properties of pulp fibers is well documented. In the patent literature, {{it can be}} seen that there is also an interest in this type of modification of pulp fibers for use in absorption products. In this study, a Scandinavian softwood kraft pulp and a birch kraft pulp were alkali extracted at 3 different concentrations of NaOH (2 %, 4 % and 8 % NaOH in the suspension). The alkali extraction removed a large part of the hemicelluloses from the pulp fibers and decreased the content of the charged groups. After extraction, the pulps were dried in the form of sheets (approx. 600 g/m(2)). The alkali extracted pulp fibers exhibited a greater decrease in swelling when re-wetted than untreated pulp. A significant increase in the curl index after extraction with 4 % and 8 % NaOH was also noted. The tensile strength index of the formed sheets increased at the lowest concentration of NaOH and, at the higher concentrations, a decrease was observed. The pulp sheets were dry defibrated at different defibration intensities and the performance of the resulting pulps in <b>fluff</b> <b>pulp</b> applications was studied. The air-laid fiber networks of softwood pulp fibers showed higher network strength than the networks of birch pulps. The birch pulp extracted at the highest alkali level tended to give the highest network strength. The results from the network strength tests also indicated that the increased curl of the fibers from the softwood pulp extracted at the highest alkali level rendered a more flexible fiber network. In water absorption tests, the alkali treated softwood fibers tended to give networks with a somewhat enhanced water holding capacity under pressure...|$|E
40|$|Kenaf {{has been}} {{discovered}} for its potential in different kinds of industrials such as paper making, manufacturing materials, sanitary products and tissues. Kenaf {{is known as the}} most economical crop. The present exist of feminine hygiene product are produced by high cost chemicals. This may cause to increase the price. Lots of women in the developing countries still do not have enough supply of cheap feminine hygiene product and this force them use unhygienic materials such as rags, barks and even mud. So there is a need in invention and manufacturing of low cost sanitary product. This research is to analyse the best method for the production of low cost feminine hygiene from kenaf by using suitable mechanical and chemical method. Application of acidic, alkaline and hypochlorite treatment in the pulping process will increase the quality of <b>fluff</b> <b>pulp</b> without affect its basic fibre properties. The raw material of kenaf is supply by National Kenaf and Tobacco Board, Kuantan Branch. Mechanical separation was done to remove the outer bast fiber of kenaf manually. In this study, Sodium Sulphite, Glacial Acetic acid and sodium hypochlorite was used in the production of pulp as it is low cost and suitable for treating core fibres. All the samples were sent for FESEM and SEM scanning to investigate the morphological condition of the pores of the fibres for the sample. Absorbency test was carried out for each sample.
