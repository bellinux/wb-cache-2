2500|$|Legal experts {{experienced}} in {{national security issues}} are divided on how broadly the new law could be interpreted or applied. Some believe that due to subtle changes in the <b>definitions</b> <b>of</b> <b>terms</b> such as [...] "electronic surveillance", it could empower the government to conduct warrantless physical searches and even seizures of communications and computer devices and their data which belong to U.S. citizens while {{they are in the}} United States, if the government contended that those searches and potential seizures were related to its surveillance of parties outside the United States. Intelligence officials, while declining to comment directly on such possibilities, respond that such interpretations are overly broad readings of the act, and unlikely to actually occur.|$|E
2500|$|The Australian {{government}} indirectly regulates Paramedic training {{by means}} of a series of Nationally Recognised numbered certificates through the Australian Qualifications Framework, intended to provide a relatively common level of competencies. [...] Regardless, local standards are regulated by State Governments, and standards and <b>definitions</b> <b>of</b> <b>terms</b> vary widely between States. [...] Many individuals possessing Certificates I-III may work in industrial first aid, for commercial first aid companies, or as non-emergency transporters or emergency ambulance services (particularly as volunteers). [...] Some people with these qualifications call themselves [...] "Paramedics", and there is currently no law regulating the use of this term. [...] Certificate IV is the basic life support level which is regarded as the minimum entry level for emergency work in most statutory ambulance services, although some ambulance services require much higher qualifications.|$|E

2500|$|A {{database}} program HyperCard {{was released in}} 1987 for the Apple Macintosh that allowed hyperlinking between various pages within a document. In 1990, Windows Help, which was introduced with Microsoft Windows 3.0, had widespread use of hyperlinks to link different pages in a single help file together; in addition, it had a visually different kind of hyperlink that caused a popup help message to appear when clicked, usually to give <b>definitions</b> <b>of</b> <b>terms</b> introduced on the help page. The first widely used open protocol that included hyperlinks from any Internet site to any other Internet site was the Gopher protocol from 1991. [...] It was soon eclipsed by HTML after the 1993 release of the Mosaic browser (which could handle Gopher links as well as HTML links). [...] HTML's advantage was the ability to mix graphics, text, and hyperlinks, unlike Gopher, which just had menu-structured text and hyperlinks.|$|E
60|$|Thirdly, The {{names of}} simple ideas are {{not capable of}} any definition; {{the names of all}} complex ideas are. It has not, that I know, been yet {{observed}} by anybody what words are, and what are not, capable of being defined; the want whereof is (as I am apt to think) not seldom the occasion of great wrangling and obscurity in men's discourses, whilst some demand <b>definitions</b> <b>of</b> <b>terms</b> that cannot be defined; and others think they ought not to rest satisfied in an explication made by a more general word, and its restriction, (or to speak in terms of art, by a genus and difference,) when, even after such definition, made according to rule, those who hear it have often no more a clear conception of {{the meaning of the word}} than they had before. This at least I think, that the showing what words are, and what are not, capable of definitions, and wherein consists a good definition, is not wholly besides our present purpose; and perhaps will afford so much light to the nature of these signs and our ideas, as to deserve a more particular consideration.|$|E

40|$|Land {{managers}} in the western US are beginning to understand that early 20 th century forests displayed complex patterns of composition and structure at several different spatial scales, that there was interplay between patterns and processes within and across scales, and that these conditions have been radically altered by management. Further, they know that restoring integrity (see <b>Definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>Terms)</b> <b>of</b> these conditions has broad implications for the future sustainability (see <b>Definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>Terms)</b> <b>of</b> native species, ecosystem services, and ecological processes. Many are looking for methods to restore (see <b>Definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>Terms)</b> more natural landscape patterns of habitats and more naturally functioning disturbance regimes; all {{in the context of}} a warming climate. Attention is turning to evaluating whole landscapes at local and regional scales, deciphering recent changes in trajectories, and formulating landscape prescriptions that can restore ecological functionality and improve landscape resilience (see <b>Definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>Terms).</b> The business <b>of</b> landscape evaluation and developing landscape prescriptions is inherently complex, but with the advent of decision support systems, software applications are now available to conduct and document these evaluations. Here, we review several published landscape evaluation and planning applications designed with the Ecosystem Management Decision Support (EMDS) software, and present an evaluation we developed in support of a landscape restoration project. We discuss the goals and design of the project, its methods and utilities, what worked well, what could be improved and related research opportunities. For readability and compactness, fine and broad-scale landscape evaluations that could be a part of multi-scale restoration planning, are not further developed here...|$|R
