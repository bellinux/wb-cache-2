2500|$|The Snakes & Arrows Tour {{prominently}} featured three Henhouse brand rotisserie chicken ovens {{on stage}} complete with an attendant in a chef's hat and apron to [...] "tend" [...] the chickens during shows. For the 2010–2011 Time Machine Tour, Lee's {{side of the}} stage featured a steampunk-inspired combination Time Machine and Sausage Maker, with an attendant occasionally throwing material into its <b>feed</b> <b>hopper</b> during the show. During the 2012-2013 Clockwork Angels Tour, Lee used a different steampunk device called a [...] "Geddison" [...] as a backdrop. This was composed of a giant old-style phonograph horn, an oversized model brain in a jar, a set of brass horns, and a working popcorn popper. [...] The 2015 R40 tour combined several of these elements together, {{with the exception of the}} chicken ovens used on the Snakes and Arrows tour.|$|E

50|$|Gravity feed is the {{simplest}} and cheapest form of <b>hopper</b> available. Gravity <b>feed</b> <b>hoppers</b> consist of a large container and a feed tube molded into the bottom. Paintballs roll down the sloped sides, through the tube and into the marker. These hoppers have a maximum rate of 11.6 balls per second. Gravity <b>feed</b> <b>hoppers</b> are very cheap, since they are made of only a shell and a lid, but can become jammed easily as paintballs accumulate above the tube. Rocking the marker (and hopper) occasionally can prevent the paintballs from jamming in the hopper.|$|R
50|$|Gravity <b>Feed</b> <b>hoppers</b> {{often get}} jammed up with balls at the feed neck, which {{can result in}} a marker 'dry firing' (firing without paint) or {{chopping}} balls due to the timing of the ball entering the marker. This is detrimental to the speed and performance of the marker.|$|R
25|$|In {{coal-fired}} power stations, the {{raw feed coal}} from the coal storage area is first crushed into small pieces and then conveyed to the coal <b>feed</b> <b>hoppers</b> at the boilers. The coal is next pulverized into a very fine powder. The pulverizers may be ball mills, rotating drum grinders, or other types of grinders.|$|R
50|$|Information to {{be printed}} {{could be placed}} in any {{sequence}} via plugboard control panel selections. The machine operated {{at the rate of}} 75 cards a minute. The <b>feed</b> <b>hopper</b> had a capacity of 800 cards, and the stacker had a capacity of 1,000 cards.|$|E
50|$|Waste from households, Local Authority {{services}} and some local businesses {{is brought to}} the ERF. It is tipped into a waste storage bunker. From the bunker the waste is lifted into a <b>feed</b> <b>hopper</b> by an overhead crane {{at a rate of}} 28 tonnes per hour.|$|E

50|$|The newest type {{of force}} <b>feed</b> <b>hoppers</b> {{communicate}} wirelessly with the marker's electronics using radio frequency. This allows the <b>hopper</b> to begin <b>feeding</b> paintballs before the pneumatic {{system of the}} marker has begun cycling the next shot. This system almost totally eliminates mis-feeds and can increase {{the speed of the}} loader and the battery life because the loader is only in operation when the marker is preparing to fire.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Screw feeders are devices {{suitable}} for handling {{a wide variety}} of bulk solids materials that have good flow ability characteristics and are often used as dosing feeders in food industry and agriculture. The manner in which material flows into the screw feeder affects the flow characteristics of the <b>feeding</b> <b>hopper,</b> the residence periods of the material in various locations in the bunker and thus the properties of the dosed material. The present paper will present some experimental results regarding the discharging profile of the mass flow screw feeders with variable geometrical design...|$|R

50|$|Between {{the stack}} and the <b>feed</b> <b>hopper</b> were {{elaborate}} dust chambers - four double and five single ones. These chambers had a V shaped cross-section, about 9m across {{at the top}} and sloping 45 degrees to a trough at the bottom. They were built and buttressed in brick.|$|E
50|$|The {{high-density}} solids pumps {{which can}} be used in the widest range of situations is the hydraulically powered piston (or reciprocating) pump. It can be realized as single-cylinder or two-cylinder pump. In the latter case, power is transferred to the material via delivery pistons working in push-pull-mode.While one delivery piston sucks material from the <b>feed</b> <b>hopper</b> into the cylinder, the second piston simultaneously pushes the material in the other delivery cylinder and into the delivery line.|$|E
50|$|The {{center of}} the Jackson farm was located on the {{peninsula}} formed by the confluence of Freeman's Creek and the West Fork River. Edward Jackson (1759 - 1828) built a home on a prominent knoll 100 yards from the West Fork; the two-story frontier-style log structure was 40 feet by 20. On the other (east) side of the river, he built a sawmill and grist mill in 1809. An original millstone and <b>feed</b> <b>hopper</b> {{can be seen on}} the second floor.|$|E
50|$|Agitated <b>Feed</b> <b>hoppers</b> {{improve on}} the Gravity {{method of feeding}} the marker. Some use simple {{agitation}} levers or paddles inside the hopper to shake up the balls and guide them down the feed neck. Others (sometimes colloquially known as 'revies') use a paddle wheel inside the hopper to force any balls reaching {{the bottom of the}} <b>hopper</b> into the <b>feed</b> neck. Agitated Feeders need gravity to keep the balls rolling toward the bottom of the hopper before they can reach the loading mechanism. The 'Revo' with 'Z-Board' uses an electric motor to spin the paddle wheel at high speed and this method remains one of the fastest loading systems as of March 2013.|$|R
5000|$|Quality control {{occurs at}} the {{inception}} of the process. Overhead refuse cranes, which hold approximately 5 tons each, mix the waste in the bunker to create a homogeneous mixture. This is important for good combustion and low carbon content in the bottom ash by-product. These cranes then deliver the mixed waste into the <b>feeding</b> <b>hopper</b> which leads down onto highly engineered stoker grates which control the rate that waste travels through the boiler. The intense heat ignites the waste as it moves along the forward feeding grates until only the by-product bottom ash remains {{at the end of the}} grate. Each combustion line feeds a boiler that operates at a temperature above [...] for 2 seconds. The temperature in the combustion zone is measured through acoustic monitoring.|$|R

50|$|The basic {{principle}} is straightforward. A hammermill {{is essentially a}} steel drum containing a vertical or horizontal rotating shaft or drum on which hammers are mounted. The hammers are free to swing {{on the ends of}} the cross, or fixed to the central rotor. The rotor is spun at a high speed inside the drum while material is fed into a <b>feed</b> <b>hopper.</b> The material is impacted by the hammer bars and is thereby shredded and expelled through screens in the drum of a selected size.|$|E

The three basic models include the XL semi-automatic (with -inch basic barrel), XT semi-automatic (adding an expansion chamber, front grip assembly and 11-inch barrel), and eXT Electronic - which operates at fully automatic twelve or fifteen BPS, single-shot, or three round burst. The markers all feature a high impact composite body, double trigger, a center feed neck, in-line bolt system and a 200-round gravity <b>feed</b> <b>hopper.</b>|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{contribute}} to a better knowledge of shearing phenomena in granular media a computer model has been developed assuming particles of arbitrary polygonic shape. Statistical and dynamical algorithms are presented for the generation of Delannay and Voronoi lattices. In numerical shear cell experiments the dependency of dilatance and shear power on the shear velocity and the standard power was studied. The model describes even the well-known spontaneous formation of shear bands in the cells. The two- dimensional simulation of a shear zone between two tectonic plates yields earthquake statistics corresponding to the Gutenberg-Richter law. Additional application cases of the simulation model are demonstrated: granular flow through <b>feeding</b> <b>hoppers,</b> bulk materials in tumblers and crystallization phenomena.

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} explore the time bound (different growth phases) effect of different dietary nutrient densities i. e., different energy and protein concentration while maintaining the ratio between the two, all with the same ideal amino acid profile, on litter quality and leg health (footpad dermatitis (FPD) and hock burn (HB)), when fed to growing turkeys. The effects of dietary nutrient modelling on growth performance parameters, water intake and excretion, dry matter (DMD), organic matter (OMD), crude protein (CPD) digestibility coefficients and apparent metabolisable energy (AME) were also examined, when fed to growing turkeys invarying growth phases. At twenty-eight days of age one hundred and seventy five male turkeys (BUT 8) were transferred to 35 floor pens, using stratified randomisation on body weight, 5 birds in a pen, all pens were equipped with plastic <b>feed</b> <b>hoppers</b> and drinkers.

5000|$|The most {{characteristic}} {{element of}} the transfer tube pump is the so-called [...] "S" [...] transfer tube installed inside the <b>feed</b> <b>hopper.</b> The job of the transfer tube is to control the flow of high-density solids - in other words, the pump cylinder which is currently pushing the material {{is connected to the}} delivery line by such tube. At (or nearby) the end of each piston stroke the S-shaped tube which is connected to the delivery line is swung over to the other delivery cylinder with the aid of two switch cylinders. A hydraulic circuit is used for synchronizing the position of the transfer tube and the movements of the two delivery pistons.|$|E

5000|$|There is {{reasonable}} evidence {{to indicate that}} the Venus battery changed quite dramatically some time before the Queensland Government assumed ownership in November 1919; local residents date this at 1907. The number of stamps increased from 20 to 35 and the building was altered to accommodate the increase. The Inspector of Mines on 10 July 1919 stated that: [...] "...the mill is very well laid out for public crushing, each of the seven batteries being a complete unit in themselves from the <b>feed</b> <b>hoppers</b> to the sand pits." [...] (By 1982, this could be said of only two batteries of five head of stamps).In 1935 only three batteries of stamps were working and No.2 boilers' brick foundation was crumbling. The Inspector of Mines stated that [...] "a State Mill must be kept here even if it only averages 100 tons per month...the Venus has never yielded the Department any profit, in fact a steady loss on working expenses and no return on capital account". He proposed relocating the plant to the old Brilliant Extended Mill site alongside the railway station, which had advantages of a railway connection and cheaper power.

40|$|A {{particulate}} {{feeding system}} based on air flluidization principles was developed at the Thermal and Fluids Engineering Group at EESC-USP. The system is basically formed of a cylindrical chamber comprising two levels of fluid bed distributor plates. The performance of the system was addressed. Repeatability experiments were performed in order to check out {{for the possibility of}} solids feeding control through a sphere valve which controls the air feed rate. Silica sand particles of three different size were used, with mean diameters of 152, 287 and 484 µm. Experiments showed that the total particulate discharge depends on the primary air feeding rate, the distance between the exit of the <b>feeding</b> <b>hopper</b> and the primary air distributor plate, and the particulate diameter, but independs on the secondary air feeding rate. The system was observed to be of difficult control and showed poor repeatability. However, the system was found to be an excellent device for distributing the flow of solids throughout several discharge sections. For the operational conditions considered and air volumetric flowrates above 3 × 10 - 3 m³/s the deviation on the particulate mass flowrate through a given discharge section related to the average value through the four sections of the injector was always below 5 %...|$|R

In tea processing, during withering and maceration process the whole leaves are subjected to size reduction, rolling, maceration, feeding and conveyance. The tea leaves are generally not uniform due to plucking standard, moisture content of the leaf and the variety. Non-uniformity in feed rate of tea leaves which will ultimately pass through the <b>feed</b> <b>hopper</b> will not only affect the cut size of the leaves but unwanted friction between CTC machine roller...|$|E

It was fabricated with stainless steel and oriented horizontally. The reactor consist a <b>feeding</b> <b>hopper,</b> fiber removing unit, gas collection system, leachate recirculation system, blending and mixing unit and the main reactor. The reactor performances were evaluated by testing and analyzing, pH, BOD 5, COD, TDS, TS, TSS, VS, VSS, organic C and N. The analyses indicated variation of pH along with the phase changes caused by bacterial reactions. Parameters such as TS, TSS, VSS, TDS, and C/N ratio show an increasing trend with time. BOD 5 and COD varied according to change in microbial population inside the reactor and phase of digestion. There was an increase in settle solids as well as a gradual reduction in VS although TS and TDS have increased steadily. It signifies that the loading of the reactor could be increased and solid retention time to be reduced by improving the sludge removal...|$|R
40|$|The {{graduation}} Theses {{deals with}} a predation of pheasants nests. The {{aim of this}} work was to observe predation of the nests in model areas in the neighbourhood of Prague. There were chosen two natural parks such as Draháň Trója and the natural reserve Údolí Únětického potoka which is located between Praha Suchdol and Únětice village. The intention of our work was to map an occurrence of pheasants predators and consequently evaluate the biggest risks of pheasants nesting. Within the evaluation of predation of the nests we have also set artificial pheasants nests located on the sunny places of bushes and arable land of mentioned locations. Interesting results were collected; concretely in the valley of Únětický potok was predated up to 35 % of artificial nests and in Draháň as much as 85 %. Between the main predators belonged the fox (Vulpes vulpes), martens (Martes spp.), pied mannikin (Pica spp.) and wild boar (Sus scrofa). Based on these results was made a conclusion that there is a suitable game management provide by the local hunting organization. We have made a recommendation to build up more interim and lasting covers <b>feeding</b> <b>hoppers</b> and bio corridors for pheasants.
