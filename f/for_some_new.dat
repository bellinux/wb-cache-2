5|$|In 1983, Hill was {{interview}}ed by Ultrasport. They offered her a free flight to New York for the interview {{and as part of}} the trip she was taken to the Shawangunks, a famous nearby climbing area. Finding she liked the climbing environment and yearning <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>new</b> challenges, she decided to stay and moved to New Paltz, New York. At the same time, Long was preparing for a journey to Borneo and embarking on a career as a writer. The couple went their separate ways but remained friends.

5|$|The {{number of}} adults owning shares rose from 7 per cent to 25 per cent during her tenure, {{and more than a}} million {{families}} bought their council houses, giving an increase from 55 per cent to 67 per cent in owner occupiers from 1979 to 1990. The houses were sold at a discount of 33–55 per cent, leading to large profits <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>new</b> owners. Personal wealth rose by 80 per cent in real terms during the 1980s, mainly due to rising house prices and increased earnings. Shares in the privatised utilities were sold below their market value to ensure quick and wide sales, rather than maximise national income.|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reaction}} to the suite has always been mixed, and all band members have expressed negativity toward it in recent times. Gilmour has said the album was [...] "a load of rubbish.

Atom Heart Mother sounds like we didn't have any idea between us, but we became much more prolific after it."

2500|$|The LHV {{figure is}} NOT a {{computation}} of electricity net energy compared to energy content of fuel input; it is 11% higher than that.

[...] Manufacturers prefer to cite the higher LHV efficiency, e.g. 60%, for a new CCGT, but utilities, when calculated how much electricity the plant will generate, divide this by 1.11 to get the real, e.g. 54%, HHV efficiency of that CCGT. Coal plant efficiencies are computed on a HHV basis (it doesn't make nearly as much difference for coal burn, as for gas).|$|E
