5|$|Compared {{to that of}} Nectomys, {{the skull}} <b>is</b> <b>lightly</b> built and has narrow nasals and a broad, round braincase without {{conspicuous}} ridges on it. The zygomatic plate is broad. The incisive foramina (perforations of the front part of the palate) extend between the first molars and are broadest in their back halves. The broad mesopterygoid fossa, the gap behind {{the end of the}} palate, is perforated by sphenopalatine vacuities. The molar crowns are not as simplified as in Nectomys species, but the front cusps of the upper (anterocone) and lower first molar (anteroconid) are not divided in two. In addition to the main roots, the upper and lower first molars have smaller additional roots.|$|E
5|$|New York State Route187 (NY187) {{is a short}} {{state highway}} located entirely in Erie County, New York, in the United States. It serves as the {{southern}} end of the busy Transit Road in the town of Elma. Its southern terminus is at Quaker Road (U.S. Route20A or US20A) and its northern terminus at US20 where that highway becomes Transit Road. Unlike much of the rest of Transit, which is mostly designated as part of NY78, the NY187 portion <b>is</b> <b>lightly</b> trafficked, two-lane and largely undeveloped. NY187 was assigned in the early 1940s and was previously part of NY78.|$|E

In a sprinkling of episodes, Beaver refers to having attended church earlier on a Sunday or referring to a lesson learned in Sunday School. Ward uses parables — some from the Bible — to impart wisdom to the boys after they've experienced a difficult situation. He also often paraphrased from Greek fables to educate Wally and The Beaver about morality issues.|$|E
25|$|Chewing {{tobacco is}} the oldest way of {{consuming}} tobacco leaves. It is consumed orally, in two forms: through sweetened strands, or in a shredded form. When consuming the long, sweetened strands, the tobacco <b>is</b> <b>lightly</b> chewed and compacted into a ball. When consuming the shredded tobacco, small amounts are placed at the bottom lip, between the gum and the teeth, where it is gently compacted, thus it can often be called dipping tobacco. Both methods stimulate the salivary glands, {{which led to the}} development of the spittoon.|$|E

25|$|Prevention is by {{treating}} withdrawal symptoms. If delirium tremens occurs, aggressive treatment improves outcomes. Treatment {{in a quiet}} intensive care unit with sufficient light is often recommended. Benzodiazepines are the medication of choice with diazepam, lorazepam, chlordiazepoxide, and oxazepam all commonly used. They should be given until a person <b>is</b> <b>lightly</b> sleeping. The antipsychotic haloperidol may also be used. The vitamin thiamine is recommended. Mortality without treatment is between 15% and 40%. Currently death occurs in about 1% to 4% of cases.|$|E
25|$|To the east, Dunedin City {{includes}} {{the entirety of}} the Otago Peninsula, a long finger of land that formed the southeastern rim of the Dunedin Volcano. The peninsula <b>is</b> <b>lightly</b> settled, almost entirely along the harbour coast, and much of it is maintained as a natural habitat by the Otago Peninsula Trust. The peninsula contains several fine beaches, and is home to a considerable number of rare species, such as yellow-eyed and little penguins, seals, and shags. Most importantly, it contains the world's only mainland breeding colony of royal albatross, at Taiaroa Head on the peninsula's northeastern point.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} recipes for cholent. Ingredients vary {{according}} to the geographic areas of Europe where the Jews lived and especially the personal preferences of the cook. The core ingredient of a traditional cholent is beef, usually shoulder, brisket, flanken, or any other cut that becomes tender and flavorful in long slow cooking. The meat is placed in a pot with peeled potatoes, any type or size of beans, and grains (barley, hulled wheat, rice). The mixture <b>is</b> <b>lightly</b> seasoned, mainly salt and pepper, and water is added to the pot to create a stew-like consistency during slow cooking.|$|E

25|$|The Security Forces Command {{consists}} of an 8,000 strong force primarily made up of conscripted Turkish Cypriot males {{between the ages of}} 18 and 40. There is also an additional reserve force which {{consists of}} about 10,000 first-line and 16,000 second-line troops conscripted up to the age of 50. The Security Forces Command <b>is</b> <b>lightly</b> armed and heavily dependent on its mainland Turkish allies, from which it draws much of its officer corps. It is led by a Brigadier General drawn from the Turkish Army. It acts essentially as a gendarmerie charged with protection of the border of Northern Cyprus from Greek Cypriot incursions and maintaining internal security within Northern Cyprus.|$|E
25|$|The most {{simple way}} to make a dry-sand cores is in a dump core box, in which sand is packed into the box and scraped level with the top. A wood or metal plate is then placed over the box, and then the two are flipped over and the core segment falls out of the core box. The core segment is then baked or hardened. Multiple core {{segments}} are then hot glued together or attached by some other means. Any rough spots are filed or sanded down. Finally, the core <b>is</b> <b>lightly</b> coated with graphite, silica, or mica to give a smoother surface finish and greater resistance to heat.|$|E

25|$|September 9, 1969: Operation Raviv – Israeli forces raid Egypt's Red Sea coast. The raid is {{preceded by}} Operation Escort, with Shayetet 13 naval commandos sinking {{a pair of}} Egyptian torpedo boats that could have {{threatened}} the Israeli raiding party. Three commandos are killed when an explosive device detonates prematurely. Israeli troops backed up by aircraft captured Egyptian armor, and destroy 12 Egyptian outposts. The Egyptians suffer 100–200 casualties, and a Soviet general serving {{as a consultant to}} the Egyptians is also killed, while one Israeli soldier <b>is</b> <b>lightly</b> injured.

25|$|At larger {{gate bias}} still, near the {{semiconductor}} surface the conduction band edge is brought {{close to the}} Fermi level, populating the surface with electrons in an inversion layer or n-channel at the interface between the p region and the oxide. This conducting channel extends between the source and the drain, and current is conducted through it when a voltage is applied between the two electrodes. Increasing the voltage on the gate leads to a higher electron density in the inversion layer and therefore increases the current flow between the source and drain. For gate voltages below the threshold value, the channel <b>is</b> <b>lightly</b> populated, and {{only a very small}} subthreshold leakage current can flow between the source and the drain.|$|E
25|$|The railway line <b>is</b> <b>lightly</b> used. Lack of upkeep {{means that}} the line is {{restricted}} to a maximum speed of 64km/h and the existing trains are poorly timetabled for commuters. A committee (the Nenagh Rail Steering Committee) working in conjunction with Irish Railway News, {{had a meeting with}} the national railway company Iarnród Éireann (IÉ) on 1 September 2005 to present the results of a traffic study funded by Nenagh Town Council and North Tipperary County Council, and to seek a morning and evening service between Nenagh and Limerick which would increase commuter traffic. IÉ agreed to delay an afternoon service from the December 2005 timetable and to work towards an early service when equipment permitted from 2007. A January 2012 national newspaper article suggested that Irish Rail was expected to seek permission from the National Transport Authority to close the line. An enhanced timetable was in force during 2012 on a trial basis however the service was reduced again from February 2013.|$|E

25|$|The bipolar {{junction}} transistor, {{unlike other}} transistors, {{is usually not}} a symmetrical device. This means that interchanging the collector and the emitter makes the transistor leave the forward active mode and start to operate in reverse mode. Because the transistor's internal structure is usually optimized for forward-mode operation, interchanging the collector and the emitter makes the values of α and β in reverse operation much smaller than those in forward operation; often the α of the reverse mode is lower than 0.5. The lack of symmetry is primarily due to the doping ratios of the emitter and the collector. The emitter is heavily doped, while the collector <b>is</b> <b>lightly</b> doped, allowing a large reverse bias voltage to be applied before the collector–base junction breaks down. The collector–base junction is reverse biased in normal operation. The reason the emitter is heavily doped {{is to increase the}} emitter injection efficiency: the ratio of carriers injected by the emitter to those injected by the base. For high current gain, most of the carriers injected into the emitter–base junction must come from the emitter.|$|E
25|$|In general The Mysterious Affair at Styles is a {{considerable}} achievement for a first-off author. The country-house-party murder is a stereotype in the detective-story genre, which Christie makes no great use of. Not her sort of occasion, at least later in life, and perhaps not really her class. The family party is much more in her line, {{and this is what}} we have here. This is one of the few Christies anchored in time and space: we are in Essex, during the First World War. The family is kept together under one roof by the exigencies of war and of a matriarch demanding rather than tyrannical – not one of her later splendid monsters, but a sympathetic and lightly shaded characterisation. If the lifestyle of the family still seems to us lavish, even wasteful, nevertheless we have the half sense that we are witnessing the beginning of the end of the Edwardian summer, that the era of country-house living has entered its final phase. Christie takes advantage of this end-of-an-era feeling in several ways: while she uses the full range of servants and their testimony, a sense of decline, of break-up is evident; feudal attitudes exist, but they crack easily. The marriage of the matriarch with a mysterious nobody is the central out-of-joint event in an intricate web of subtle changes. The family <b>is</b> <b>lightly</b> but effectively characterised, and on the outskirts of the story are the villagers, the small businessmen, and the surrounding farmers – the nucleus of Mayhem Parva. It is, too, a very clever story, with clues and red herrings falling thick and fast. We are entering the age when plans of the house were an indispensable aid to the aspirant solver of detective stories, and when cleverness was more important than suspense. But here we come to a problem that Agatha Christie has not yet solved, for cleverness over the long length easily becomes exhausting, and too many clues tend to cancel each other out, as far as reader interest is concerned. These were problems which Conan Doyle never satisfactorily overcame, but which Christie would.".|$|E
