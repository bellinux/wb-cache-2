5|$|Most {{forms of}} {{camouflage}} are made ineffective by movement: a deer or grasshopper may be highly cryptic when motionless, but instantly seen when it moves. But one method, motion dazzle, requires rapidly moving bold patterns of contrasting stripes. Motion dazzle may degrade predators' ability {{to estimate the}} prey's speed and direction accurately, giving the prey an improved chance of escape. Motion dazzle distorts speed perception and is most effective at high speeds; stripes can also distort perception of size (and so, perceived range to the target). As of 2011, motion dazzle had been proposed for military vehicles, but never applied. Since motion dazzle patterns would make animals more difficult to locate accurately when moving, but <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> when stationary, {{there would be an}} evolutionary trade-off between motion dazzle and crypsis.|$|E
5|$|Another {{definition}} of the GCD is helpful in advanced mathematics, particularly ring theory. The greatest common divisor g of two nonzero numbers a and b is also their smallest positive integral linear combination, that is, the smallest positive number of the form ua+vb where u and v are integers. The set of all integral linear combinations of a and b is actually {{the same as the}} set of all multiples of g (mg, where m is an integer). In modern mathematical language, the ideal generated by a and b is the ideal generated byg alone (an ideal generated by a single element is called a principal ideal, and all ideals of the integers are principal ideals). Some properties of the GCD are in fact <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> with this description, for instance the fact that any common divisor of a and b also divides the GCD (it divides both terms of ua+vb). The equivalence of this GCD definition with the other definitions is described below.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage for {{aircraft}} {{is complicated by}} the fact that the aircraft's background varies widely, depending on the location of the observer, the nature of the background and the aircraft's motion. For this reason, military aircraft were often painted to match the sky when viewed from below, and to either match the ground or break up the aircraft's outline when viewed from above. This is a form of countershading, likely to work best on aircraft such as heavy bombers that do not do fly inverted during combat. Because of the way light hits it, patterns of dark and light will often be present on an aircraft even if it is entirely one color, making it <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Reflections and specular highlights can be counteracted by painting an aircraft in neutral shades with a non-reflective, matte finish. There is a trade-off between the effectiveness of camouflage and the size of recognition markings: larger markings reduce the risk of friendly fire through misrecognition, but compromise camouflage.|$|E

5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1951, Maple Leafs owner Conn Smythe watched special {{television}} feeds of games {{in an attempt to}} determine whether it would be a suitable medium for broadcasting hockey games. Television already had its detractors within the NHL, especially in Campbell. In 1952, even though only 10% of Canadians owned a television set, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) began televising games. On November 1, 1952, Hockey Night in Canada was first broadcast on television, with Foster Hewitt calling the action between the Leafs and Bruins at Maple Leaf Gardens. The broadcasts quickly became the highest-rated show on Canadian television. Campbell feared televised hockey would cause people to stop attending games in person, but Smythe felt the opposite. CBS first broadcast hockey games in the United States in the 1956–57 season as an experiment. Amazed with the initial popularity of the broadcasts, it inaugurated a 21-game package of games the following year. The NHL itself adapted to be viewer-friendly. In 1949, the league mandated that the ice surface be painted white to make the puck <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>see.</b> On January 18, 1958, Willie O'Ree joined the Bruins as an injury call-up for a game in Montreal. In doing so he became the first black player in the NHL.|$|E
5|$|After the Sunday rest day, Australia resumed with a lead of 478 {{runs and}} six wickets in hand. The morning was punctuated by three rain stoppages, which {{increased}} England's chances of saving the game. Just ten {{minutes after the}} start of the day's play, heavy rain intervened. The weather cleared and Miller and Brown moved to lunch on 63 and 32 respectively, having advanced Australia to 409/4. Miller was given a life before lunch when he hit a ball high into the air; Dollery stood right under it and had ample time to prepare, but dropped the catch. In 88 minutes of play, Australia added a further 66 runs. During this time, the third new ball became available, but England opted not to use it immediately, as the wet and slippery ground had made it hard for the bowlers to grip the ball or run up to the crease with confidence; the hosts instead waited for drier conditions so they could exercise more control over the ball. However, after a period of using his slower bowlers, Yardley opted to take the new ball, and Miller hit three boundaries to pass 50, and both batsmen lifted their rate of scoring. It appeared that aside from the need to score quickly in preparation for the declaration, both players found the new ball <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> than its muddied predecessor. Miller hooked Coxon repeatedly, and drove Bedser for many runs. Bradman was expected to declare just before lunch so he could attack the English openers for a short period before the adjournment, but a shower at this time deterred him from doing so, as his bowlers would have struggled to grip the ball; Lindwall had also been injured on a slippery surface in earlier times.|$|E

25|$|The {{more distant}} an object is, the younger it appears: its light has taken longer to reach human observers.

25|$|Air is {{not always}} the best test medium for {{studying}} small-scale aerodynamic principles, due to the speed of the air flow and airfoil movement.

25|$|They produce large mucus webs to filter-feed on {{phytoplankton}} {{but also}} small zooplankton. They eat the web with the captured prey and then re-reproduce a web net. The web {{is large and}} spherical {{and it is difficult}} to see during the day because of diffuse reflection. Webs are <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> at night. Limacina helicina is easily disturbed (like all other Thecosomata); when disturbed, it retracts into its shell and destroys its web. Gilmer & Harbison (1991) have assumed, that Limacina helicina feeds while motionless (without actively swimming). Its web enables them neutral buoyancy or allow them slow sinking only.|$|E
25|$|The Brooklyn Bridegrooms used checked uniforms in 1889, {{and brought}} them back in 1907 (as the Superbas) and 1916–1917 (as the Robins). Satin uniforms were {{developed}} by several teams including the Brooklyn Dodgers for night games, as the sheen of the fabric was more reflective and thus <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>see.</b> Pinstripes were commonly worn on the uniforms of the New York Yankees. Legend had it that the stripes were adopted to make Babe Ruth look slimmer, but since the Yankees had already been wearing pinstripes {{a few years before}} Ruth played for them in 1920, the legend was found to be a myth. The Yankees' pinstripes on their home uniforms soon became a team symbol.|$|E
25|$|Another {{departure}} from the Barris Batmobile was a single windshield and large, elevated bat-fins. Curiously, the car's underside was colored light blue, and it appeared to conceal the car's chassis except for a motorized panel, from which devices such as the Bat-winch would emerge. It is assumed Filmation's Batmobile used this light blue underside color to make the panel and devices <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>see.</b> Additionally, the cockpit seating was a vibrant red, with a dashboard panel using bat accents around an inset monitor screen, among other details. Filmation's Batmobile used parachutes, inflatable pontoons and, in case of damaged tires, vertical and rear-mounted jets to lift and propel the car — which then essentially caused it {{to function as a}} high-powered hovercraft. The Filmation Batmobile from The Batman/Superman Hour {{was one of the few}} Batmobiles not to see adaptations to any DC Comics publications or have any commercially available replicas (toys, diecast cars, plastic model kits, etc.).|$|E

25|$|Night jumpers {{should be}} made aware of the dark zone, when landing at night. Above 30 meters (100 feet) jumpers flying their canopy have {{a good view of the}} landing zone {{normally}} because of reflected ambient light/moon light. Once they get close to the ground, this ambient light source is lost, because of the low angle of reflection. The lower they get, the darker the ground looks. At about 100 feet and below it may seem that they are landing in a black hole. Suddenly it becomes very dark, and the jumper hits the ground soon after. This ground rush should be explained to, and anticipated by, the first time night jumper. Recommendations {{should be made}} to the jumper to utilize a canopy that is larger than they typically use on a day jump and to attempt to schedule their first night jump as close to a full moon as possible to make it <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the ground.|$|E
25|$|The {{selection}} of a matrix {{is the first step}} when preparing samples for MALDI analysis. The primary goals of the matrix are to absorb the energy from a laser, thus transferring it to the analyte molecules, and to separate the analyte molecules from each other. A consideration that should be taken into account when choosing a matrix is what type of analyte ion is expected or desired. Knowing the acidity or basicity of the analyte molecule compared with the acidity or basicity of the matrix, for example, is valuable knowledge when choosing a matrix. The matrix should not compete with the analyte molecule, so the matrix should not want to form the same type of ion as the analyte. For example, if the desired analyte has a high amount of acidity, it would be logical to choose a matrix with a high amount of basicity to avoid competition and facilitate the formation of an ion. The pH of the matrix {{can also be used to}} select what sample you want to obtain spectra for. For example, in the case of proteins, a very acidic pH can show very little of the peptide components, but can show very good signal for those components that are larger. If the pH is increased towards a more basic pH, then smaller components become <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>see.</b>|$|E
25|$|Dungeon Keeper was {{announced}} in August 2013, although development began the previous year. It was scheduled for a winter release, and designed for touchscreens. According to senior producer Jeff Skalski, Mythic Entertainment had to make significant changes to Dungeon Keeper for mobile platforms, although there were aspects of the original games from Bullfrog Productions they wanted to keep, such as the humour. The intention was to give players an experience of the original Dungeon Keeper. Despite this, he stated {{that they were not}} trying to recreate the original games, or the cancelled Dungeon Keeper 3, but rather a mobile game for mobile systems. The colour palette was expanded to make the creatures <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> on mobile phones. The role of traps was increased, and gameplay was made to focus as much on offence as defence. According to Skalski, the god-view facilitated the porting to touch-screen devices. The development team took into account feedback from fans on the internet, and their goal was to make the game free so many people could play it. Skalski emphasized that the game is built for typical mobile game patterns, which meant that {{it is supposed to be}} played for brief periods multiple times per day. He disagreed with assertions that it lacks the humour of the original, due to Richard Ridings (who, according to him, is a fan-favourite) providing the voice-overs like he did with the original Dungeon Keeper and Dungeon Keeper 2, which included over 500 lines of dialogue.|$|E

500|$|The modern {{periodic}} table is sometimes expanded into its long or 32-column form by reinstating the footnoted f-block elements into their natural position between the s- and d-blocks. Unlike the 18-column form this arrangement results in [...] "no interruptions {{in the sequence}} of increasing atomic numbers". The relationship of the f-block to the other blocks of the {{periodic table}} also becomes <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>see.</b> Jensen advocates a form of table with 32 columns {{on the grounds that}} the lanthanides and actinides are otherwise relegated in the minds of students as dull, unimportant elements that can be quarantined and ignored. Despite these advantages the 32-column form is generally avoided by editors on account of its undue rectangular ratio (compared to a book page ratio), and the familiarity of chemists with the modern form (as introduced by Seaborg).|$|E
500|$|In 2000, {{a version}} of Donkey Kong Country was {{released}} for the Game Boy Color.

The GBC version had some of the music scrapped and replaced, often with music that had originated in Donkey Kong Land. In 2003, another version of the game was released for the Game Boy Advance. This version has increased brightness, at the cost of contrast and colour saturation, to make the game <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> on an unlit LCD screen. Both games have some new features, including new minigames, hidden pictures, and a Time Trial mode; additionally, the GBA version had multiplayer games. Both versions also have lower sound fidelity and a number of minor changes. Candy Kong no longer runs a save point, so players can save the game in any area.|$|E
