40|$|The {{standard}} manufacturing {{system for}} Flat Panel Displays (FPDs) {{consists of a}} number of pieces of equipment in series. Each piece of equipment usually has a number of buffers to prevent collision between glass substrates. However, in reality, very few of these buffers seem to be used.

In this paper, we focus on an <b>in-line</b> <b>system</b> in which each piece of equipment can have any number of buffers.

Here, we have tested the accuracy and reproducibility of absolute coccolith abundance estimates obtained with the filtration method in combination with a rotary sample divider. The examination of two different filtration devices, a funnel and an <b>in-line</b> <b>system,</b> analysing a known number of microbeads per weight, revealed that counts obtained with funnel systems are up to Ø 18. 6 % too high. Repeated analyses (15 ×) of a fine-fraction sediment sample revealed {{a standard deviation of}} ± 11. 4 % for the <b>in-line</b> <b>system</b> and ± 15. 2 % for the funnel system, respectively. The comparison between three sub-samples (three splits of 1 / 30) showed a standard deviation of 4. 6 % for the <b>in-line</b> <b>system</b> and 9. 9 % for the funnel system, respectively. Therefore, we assume that the potential split error for the rotary splitter is ? 4. 6 %. The comparison of our results with estimates for the same samples analysed with the random settling and the “spiking with microbeads and spraying method” (SMS method) reveal that only the data obtained with the SMS and in-line filter method are statistically equal. The results obtained with the settling method are too low, whilst the results obtained with funnel filtration are too high in terms of coccolith absolute abundances. Our results confirm that the filtration method, including sample splitting with a rotary splitter, is a suitable method for the analysis of absolute coccolith abundances. However, the use of different filtration devices appears to affect the accuracy and reproducibility of the results. Furthermore, the number of splitting steps should be as small as possible to avoid an increase of error due to error propagation. In order to increase the reliability of the filtration method, we suggest calibrating a filtration device with microbeads as a standard measure. The reported reproducibility of the various preparation techniques may help to compare data sets obtained with different methods. <br/...|$|E

A prototype in-line sputter deposition facility, {{based on the}} existing standard HiTUS technology, has been developed. Materials deposited by both the standard HiTUS and the prototype <b>in-line</b> <b>system</b> where characterised. This was important in examining the key deliverable {{of the new system}} which is uniform deposition of high quality coatings on large (20 cm by 30 cm) substrates. Initially characterisation of the <b>in-line</b> <b>system</b> showed that fully reacted transparent alumina coatings using reactive sputtering could be deposited. The process was found to be reproducible, with a run-to-run variation in peak positions for UV-Vis-IR transmission spectra of less than = 1 %. The process conditions and system were investigated to optimise the system performance. Theoretical and experimental investigations showed that the RF plasma and magnetic field shape both affected the uniformity of coating thickness and optical transmission for reactive sputtering processes. Changes to the system configuration to improve the magnetic field shape based on these findings have increased the usable substrate width from 10 cm to approximate ly 20 cm. Investigating the heating effect of the plasma showed that doubling the RF plasma power (at constant target power) can increase the heat flux to the substrate by a factor of two. For the deposition of tin doped indium oxide (ITO) and aluminium- doped zinc oxide (AZO) increasing the RF plasma power was shown to (i) change the material from amorphous to nanocrystalline, (ii) increase the visible transmission of coatings and (iii) increase the conductivity of the material. These effects are attributed to the increased energy of the plasma species promoting both higher surface mobility and reactivity of adsorbed species.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} {{was to examine the}} effects of {{exercise}} on gas mixing in the lung during exercise. There were four major stages. Firstly, the existing equipment used with resting subjects was applied to the exercising subject and was found to be inappropriate. Secondly, an <b>in-line</b> <b>system</b> of measuring flow and gas concentration was devised. Thirdly this system was validated with the aid of a physical model and resting subjects. Finally, nitrogen wash-out data were collected from 24 subjects at rest and during progressive exercise at three standard exercise intensities. The dynamic response characteristics of the bag-in-box spirometer at high breathing frequencies (50 min- 1) were such that tidal volume was underestimated by almost 50 %. The box was too small and its response too a linear for adequate correction factors to be applied. The <b>in-line</b> <b>system,</b> based on a linear relationship between flow and several argon, oxygen, carbon dioxide and nitrogen mixtures (r = + 0. 99, p< 0. 01, Y = 0. 2687 FAr + 0. 995), measured tidal volumes reliably (CV < 1 %) when expired flow was maintained at 35 ° C. Thirty-six wash-outs of a 2. 4 litre bell jar produced a mean value of 2. 461 litres (SD. 0. 034, CV. 1. 4 %). The capacity of the <b>in-line</b> <b>system</b> to measure gas mixing efficiency reliably was tested on resting subjects (six trials each on two days). Mean values were 76. 7 % (SD. 7 - 5 %) and 76. 8 % (SD 4. 7 %); mean CV for all trials was 8 %. Progressive exercise resulted in significant reduction in lung volume as measured by recovered nitrogen; there was evidence that at the greatest exercise intensity all the nitrogen was not recovered. Decreased diffusion time as a result of greater respiratory frequency may have been responsible. The significantly greater tidal volumes and respiratory frequencies observed on exercise resulted in bigger minute volumes. Both series and alveolar deadspaces increased, but the greater minute volume more than compensated for the growing dead spaces, and so the inspired volume available for mixing was increased. Ventilatory and gas mixing efficiency improved significantly as exercise progressed, but the greatest improvement occurred at the first power output of 50 W; thereafter, there was very little change in gas mixing efficiency in spite of three-fold increase in ventilation. It is possible that gas mixing efficiency functions optimally at FRC and that, unlike some other physiological measures, there is little reserve capacity. However, the possibility of gas mixing deficiencies at maximal exercise leading to a ventilatory limit to maximal oxygen uptake remains, and this issue still needs to be investigated...|$|E

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "To meet the mandate to screen all checked baggage for explosives by December 31, 2003, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) placed minivan-sized explosive detection systems (EDS) and other screening equipment in airport lobbies. However, these interim lobby solutions have caused operational inefficiencies, {{in part because they}} require a large number of screeners. According to TSA, in-line baggage screening [...] where EDS machines are integrated with an airport's baggage conveyor system [...] can be a more cost-effective and efficient alternative to lobby-based, stand-alone equipment. For example, <b>in-line</b> <b>systems</b> can increase the efficiency of airport, airline, and TSA operations, and lower costs by reducing the number of screeners. Moreover, <b>in-line</b> explosive detection <b>systems</b> can enhance security because they reduce congestion in airport lobbies, thus removing a potential target for terrorists. However, installing <b>in-line</b> <b>systems</b> can have large up-front costs, related to the need for airport modifications. To help defray these costs, in 2003, Congress authorized TSA to reimburse airports up to 75 percent of the cost to install these systems by entering "letter of intent" (LOI) agreements. An LOI, though not a binding commitment of federal funding, represents TSA's intent to provide the agreed-upon funds in future years if the agency receives sufficient appropriations to cover the agreement. TSA has issued eight letters of intent to help defray the costs of installing <b>in-line</b> <b>systems</b> at nine airports as of February 2007, but none since February 2004. In September 2003, TSA and the City of Los Angeles signed an LOI and an attached memorandum of agreement (LOI/MOA) in which TSA agreed to pay an amount not to exceed 75 percent of the agreed upon estimated total project cost of $ 341 million (about $ 256 million) to install in-line checked baggage screening systems at both Los Angeles (LAX) and Ontario (ONT) International Airports. However, in December 2003, officials from the City of Los Angeles' airport authority [...] Los Angeles World Airports (LAWA) [...] informed TSA that aspects of the design concept were infeasible and that additional construction modifications would be needed. LAWA subsequently submitted a revised cost estimate to TSA in April 2005 and requested that TSA amend the LOI/MOA to increase the federal reimbursement by about $ 122 million. TSA has not amended the LOI to provide for additional reimbursements; however, as of February 2007, TSA had obligated the $ 256 million for the City of Los Angeles LOI/MOA in accordance with the schedule agreed to in the LOI and had reimbursed LAWA for about $ 26 million in expenses. Senate Report 109 - 273 directs us to review the reasons for the differences between the original 2003 cost estimate and the revised 2005 cost estimate submitted by LAWA.
