5|$|Certain {{events can}} take place while {{managing}} the tower. For example, terrorists may phone the player to let them <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> hidden a bomb in the building, and that they demand a ransom. If the ransom is not paid, then security services must find the bomb before it detonates, or else the tower will incur significant damages. If the player builds facilities underground, the game may notify them that their workers have discovered gold treasure, which gives the player {{a significant amount of}} funds. At random intervals during the game, there are notifications that state that a VIP will be visiting the tower soon, so the player must prepare for their visit. If the VIP enjoys their visit because of variables such as a comfortable hotel suite and efficient navigation, the VIP will give the tower a favorable rating. A favorable rating would then allow the tower to advance to the next star level, assuming the other qualifications are met. Although it does not have any impact on the tower, {{at the end of the}} fourth quarter every year in the game, Santa Claus and his reindeer fly across the tower.|$|E
5|$|This rockfowl usually lives either {{alone or}} in pairs, {{although}} small flocks of three to ten birds are not uncommon. It normally moves through its habitat {{in a series of}} runs and long, springing hops on the ground and in low branches. It uses its tail for balance while hopping and running. When in a flock, rockfowl hop almost in unison. In the unusual occurrences when the species does fly, it is fast and is capable of navigating through the trees and rocks well. When it is standing still, the rockfowl has its tail down and its head looking up. Typically, it silently evades any unusual movements in their forest. However, if these birds <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> been sighted, they can become quite inquisitive and occasionally approach observers. This is not a shy species once it knows that it has been seen, and often studies things of interest, including humans, from an open location. When this species is suspicious, it raises the small crown on its head and the ruff on its neck while uttering a muffled groan. It is most active in the early morning and late evening, and from 10:30 am to 7:00 pm remains perched with little activity either in liana-tangled areas or in caves away from the nests. To scratch its head, the species lifts its foot over its head. It bathes in small pools. While its lifespan in the wild is unknown, it has lived up to 25 years in captivity.|$|E

It would have been better if she had killed Rap Brown and/or Stokely Carmichael, but when she killed Dr. King, she lost.|$|E

500|$|On February 1, 2006, Insane Clown Posse fan Jacob D. Robida {{attacked}} {{individuals in}} a gay bar in New Bedford, Massachusetts with a handgun and a hatchet—a weapon {{featured in the}} logo of the group's record label, Psychopathic Records. Robida had a swastika tattoo and flaunted Nazi insignias and paraphernalia on his website. On February 5, Robida shot and killed a traffic officer during a routine stop. When police pulled Robida over during a later stop, he killed his girlfriend, Jennifer Bailey of Charleston, West Virginia, then opened fire on the police. Robida was shot twice in the head during the shootout with the police, and later died in the hospital. On February 7, Insane Clown Posse released a statement on the Robida attacks. The group's manager Alex Abbiss extended Bruce and Utsler's condolences and prayers {{to the families of}} the victims, stating that [...] "It's quite obvious that this guy had no clue what being a Juggalo is all about. If anyone knows anything at all about ICP, then you <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> never, ever been down or will be down with any racist or bigotry bullshit".|$|E
500|$|In 1545, Charles Estienne was {{the first}} writer to {{identify}} the clitoris in a work based on dissection, but he concluded {{that it had a}} urinary function. Following this study, Realdo Colombo (also known as Matteo Renaldo Colombo), a lecturer in surgery at the University of Padua, Italy, published a book called De re anatomica in 1559, in which he describes the [...] "seat of woman's delight". In his role as researcher, Colombo concluded, [...] "Since no one has discerned these projections and their workings, if it is permissible to give names to things discovered by me, it should be called the love or sweetness of Venus.", in reference to the mythological Venus, goddess of erotic love. Colombo's claim was disputed by his successor at Padua, Gabriele Falloppio (discoverer of the fallopian tube), who claimed that he {{was the first}} to discover the clitoris. In 1561, Falloppio stated, [...] "Modern anatomists have entirely neglected it... and do not say a word about it... and if others have spoken of it, <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> taken it from me or my students." [...] This caused an upset in the European medical community, and, having read Colombo's and Falloppio's detailed descriptions of the clitoris, Vesalius stated, [...] "It is unreasonable to blame others for incompetence on the basis of some sport of nature you have observed in some women and you can hardly ascribe this new and useless part, as if it were an organ, to healthy women." [...] He concluded, [...] "I think that such a structure appears in hermaphrodites who otherwise have well formed genitals, as Paul of Aegina describes, but I have never once seen in any woman a penis (which Avicenna called albaratha and the Greeks called an enlarged nympha and classed as an illness) or even the rudiments of a tiny phallus." ...|$|E

500|$|The video {{stood out}} conspicuously to Aguilar for its chaotic texture through the rapid editing of the {{multiple}} shots that constituted it. The sudden and continuous changes of camera angles, scenes and the distance and mood seemed to produce an [...] "apparently incoherent combination of images that offered no stable anchor to provide the whole with a definitive interpretation", she added. Since chaos has traditionally {{been associated with the}} female ontogenetic principle as opposed to male principle of order, the video in turn came to be associated with duality between order/chaos, male/female, good/evil, light/dark etc. Aguilar also drew parallel between Metropolis and the music video. Madonna borrowed different phallic symbolism from the film, including the smoke-billowing chimneys, the tall skyscrapers and the oppressive environment of industrial work. However, unlike Metropolis which portrayed repression of a rebellious proletariat, the chaotic nature of [...] "Express Yourself" [...] video showed freedom instead. Caryn James from The New York Times added that [...] "asked about the video, [...] made a distinction that any honest feminist would respect, however politically incorrect it may seem. 'I have chained myself', she said. 'There wasn't a man that put that chain on me.' You don't have to buy Madonna's next loopy bit of symbolism—'I was chained to my desires'—to believe the feminist subtext she finds in the video. 'I do everything by my own volition. I'm in charge, O.K.' Madonna in chains, though, is far removed from those unfortunate women who don't <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> options." [...] Madonna also complained about the feminist criticisms of her [...] "crotch-grabbing", saying that [...] "if male singers like Michael Jackson can get away with it, why can't women?" [...] Theorist Douglas Kellner further asserted that the video was a feminist critique of male fighting and brutality, with images of the male workers engaged in a boxing match at the end. According to him, Madonna deliberately appropriated traditional feminine images {{in the beginning of the}} video, but contrasted them with her [...] "crotch-hugging" [...] male poses near the end, and discordant images of women assuming the male position. As feminist author Susan Bordo pointed out, [...] "it is the postmodern nature of the video that has most entranced academic critics, and its various ways of constituting identities that refuse stability, that remain fluid, that resist definition." ...|$|E
