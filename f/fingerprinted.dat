Statutory criminal defenses (e.g. duress, entrapment) are not available for DUI, and in State v. Hammond, the state Supreme Court upheld the conviction of a person who drove after unknowingly having his drink spiked with alcohol. Common-law criminal defenses are available in DUI cases, and a state appellate court reversed the conviction of a person who drove while intoxicated in order to escape assailants, citing the doctrine of necessity.|$|E

In addition, different from the manual approach for <b>fingerprint</b> recognition by experts, the <b>fingerprint</b> recognition here is referred as <b>Fingerprint</b> Recognition System, which is program-based. <b>Fingerprint</b> verification is to verify the authenticity of one person by his <b>fingerprint.</b> The user provides his <b>fingerprint</b> together with his identity information like his ID number.

However, {{the small number}} of minutiae in partial <b>fingerprints</b> is still a challenge in <b>fingerprint</b> matching. In <b>fingerprint</b> recognition systems, there are frequently appeared partial <b>fingerprints,</b> such as incompletely touching in <b>fingerprint</b> scanning or latent <b>fingerprints.</b> In this paper, we studied the influence of the <b>fingerprint</b> area in partial <b>fingerprint</b> recognition. First, a simulation scheme was proposed to construct a serial of partial <b>fingerprints</b> with different area. Then, the influence of the <b>fingerprint</b> area in partial <b>fingerprint</b> recognition is studied. By comparing the performance of partial <b>fingerprint</b> recognition with different <b>fingerprint</b> area, some useful conclusions can be drawn: (1) The decrease of the <b>fingerprint</b> area degrades the performance of partial <b>fingerprint</b> recognition; (2) When the <b>fingerprint</b> area decreases, the genuine matching scores will decrease, whereas the im-poster matching scores will increase; (3) When the area of partial <b>fingerprints</b> is smaller than 20, 000 pixels (about fifth of the normal full <b>fingerprints),</b> the performance of partial <b>fingerprint</b> recognition becomes very poor; (4) The threshold value of a given false accept rate increases when the area of partial <b>fingerprints</b> decrease a lot, but it remains almost the same if the area of partial <b>fingerprints</b> decrease not so much, e. g., greater than 50, 000 pixels (about half of the normal full <b>fingerprint).</b> These observations can be helpful in improving the performance of partial <b>fingerprint</b> recognition in the future...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Fingerprint images {{generally}} contain {{either a}} single <b>fingerprint</b> (e. g., rolled images) or {{a set of}} nonoverlapped <b>fingerprints</b> (e. g., slap <b>fingerprints).</b> However, there are situations where several <b>fingerprints</b> overlap {{on top of each}} other. Such situations are frequently encountered when latent (partial) <b>fingerprints</b> are lifted from crime scenes or residue <b>fingerprints</b> are left on <b>fingerprint</b> sensors. Overlapped <b>fingerprints</b> constitute a serious challenge to existing <b>fingerprint</b> recognition algorithms, since these algorithms are designed under the assumption that <b>fingerprints</b> have been properly segmented. In this paper, a novel algorithm is proposed to separate overlapped <b>fingerprints</b> into component or individual <b>fingerprints.</b> The basic idea is to first estimate the orientation field of the given image with overlapped <b>fingerprints</b> and then separate it into component orientation fields using a relaxation labeling technique. We also propose an algorithm to utilize <b>fingerprint</b> singularity information to further improve the separation performance. Experimental results indicate that the algorithm leads to good separation of overlapped <b>fingerprints</b> that leads to a significant improvement in the matching accuracy.

40|$|Securing a stored <b>fingerprint</b> {{image is}} of {{paramount}} importance because a compromised <b>fingerprint</b> cannot be easily revoked. In this work, an input <b>fingerprint</b> image is mixed with another <b>fingerprint</b> (e. g., from a different finger), in order to produce a new mixed image that obscures the identity of the original <b>fingerprint.</b> Mixing <b>fingerprints</b> creates a new entity that looks like a plausible <b>fingerprint</b> and, thus, (a) it can be processed by conventional <b>fingerprint</b> algorithms and (b) an intruder {{may not be able to}} determine if a given print is mixed or not. To mix two <b>fingerprints,</b> each <b>fingerprint</b> is decomposed into two components, viz., the continuous and spiral components. After pre-aligning the two components of each <b>fingerprint,</b> the continuous component of one <b>fingerprint</b> is combined with the spiral component of the other <b>fingerprint</b> image in order to generate a mixed <b>fingerprint.</b> Experiments on the WVU and FVC 2000 datasets show that the mixed <b>fingerprint</b> can potentially be used for authentication and that the identity of the original <b>fingerprint</b> cannot be easily deduced from the mixed <b>fingerprint.</b> Further, the mixed <b>fingerprint</b> can facilitate in the generation of cancelable templates. 1...|$|R

40|$|This is {{an excerpt}} from the content Synonyms <b>Fingerprint</b> benchmark; Fingerprint corpora; Fingerprint dataset Definition <b>Fingerprint</b> {{databases}} are structured collections of <b>fingerprint</b> data mainly used for either evaluation or operational recognition purposes. <b>Fingerprint</b> data in databases for evaluation are usually detached from the identity of corresponding individuals.

40|$|<b>Fingerprints</b> are a {{non-invasive}} biometric that possess significant advantages. However, {{they are}} subject to surface erosion and damage; distortion upon scanning; and are vulnerable to <b>fingerprint</b> spoofing. The internal <b>fingerprint</b> exists as the undulations of the papillary junction - an intermediary layer of skin - and provides a solution to these disadvantages. Optical coherence tomography is used to capture the internal <b>fingerprint.</b> A depth profile of the papillary junction throughout the OCT scans is first constructed using fuzzy c-means clustering and a fine-tuning procedure. This information is then used to define localised regions over which to average pixels for the resultant internal <b>fingerprint.</b> When compared to a ground-truth internal <b>fingerprint</b> zone, the internal <b>fingerprint</b> zone detected automatically is within the measured bounds of human error. With a mean- squared-error of 21. 3 and structural similarity of 96. 4 %, the internal <b>fingerprint</b> zone was successfully found and described. The extracted <b>fingerprints</b> exceed their surface counterparts with respect to orientation certainty and NFIQ scores (both of which are respected <b>fingerprint</b> quality assessment criteria). Internal to surface <b>fingerprint</b> correspondence and internal <b>fingerprint</b> cross correspondence were also measured. A larger scanned region is shown to be advantageous as internal <b>fingerprints</b> extracted from these scans have good surface correspondence (75 % had at least one true match with a surface counterpart). It is also evidenced that internal <b>fingerprints</b> can constitute a <b>fingerprint</b> database. 96 % of the internal <b>fingerprints</b> extracted had at least one corresponding match with another internal <b>fingerprint.</b> When compared to surface <b>fingerprints</b> cropped to match the internal fingerprints’ representative area and locality, the internal <b>fingerprints</b> outperformed these cropped surface counterparts.
