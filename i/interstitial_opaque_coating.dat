Here, we report {{investigations into the}} thermal behavior of fiber probes produced by selective chemical etching that in our experience provide high light throughputs (10 (- 3) - 10 (- 4) vs 10 (- 6) for the pulled fibers). Unexpectedly, we find a shortening of such probes in response to "high-power" laser injection (> 1 mW). Thermal stress due to prolonged high-power laser injection (similar to 9 mW at 325 nm; compared to powers 10 mW at 633 nm). Although the vertical feedback mechanism of the microscope can compensate for dilations/contractions of the probes, these findings are of general importance to the field. More specifically they are significant for the achievement of a detailed understanding of apertured-SNOM operation, for the selection and operation of near-field probes, and for preventing potential artifacts in imaging and lithography, due to uncontrolled alteration of the probe properties and/or light leakage from cracks of the <b>opaque</b> <b>coating</b> induced by thermal fatigue.

40|$|During {{photometric}} measurements involving {{the use of}} photometric lamps {{it is necessary that}} the filament of lamp takes a strictly predetermined position with respect to the photodetector and the optical axis of the photometric setup. The errors in positioning of alignment filament with respect to the optical axis of the measuring system lead to increase the uncertainty of measurement of the photometric characteristics of the light sources. A typical method for alignment of filament of photometric lamps is based on the use a diopter tubes (telescopes). Using this method, the mounting of filament to the required position is carried out by successive approximations, which requires special concentration and a lot of time. The aim of this work is to develop an apparatus for alignment which allows simultaneous alignment of the filament of lamps in two mutually perpendicular planes. The method and apparatus for alignment of the photometric lamp filament during measurements of the photometric characteristics of light sources based on two digital video cameras is described in this paper. The apparatus allows to simultaneously displaying the image of lamps filament on the computer screen in two mutually perpendicular planes.

The melts range from carbonatitic (50 – 97 % carbonate) to Ca–Mg–silicic (10 – 50 % carbonate) to Mg–silicic (< 10 % dispersed calcite) compositions, and are connected by veinlets of similar material, or by fractures bordered by spongy Cr–diopside. Phenocrysts and quench crystals of calcite, olivine and mica are set in carbonatitic to Mg–silicic matrices, and irregular volumes of carbonatite and Mg–silicate melt appear to have unmixed from one another within single inclusions. Calculated bulk compositions of the more silicic melts are similar in major- and trace elements to kimberlites from the Slave province. The Cr–diopside adjacent to melt inclusions is enriched in LREE, Ba, alkali elements, HFSE, Th and U. Calculated compositions of the metasomatising fluids are strongly enriched in these elements relative to the trapped melts, and are similar to fluids trapped in the <b>opaque</b> <b>coats</b> found on many Diavik diamonds. The microstructures, the metasomatic effects and the genetic relationship to diamond formation suggest that the melt inclusions formed when kimberlite-like melts penetrated the lherzolites along fractures deep in the lithospheric mantle. The melts began to differentiate into carbonatitic and ultramafic end-members, were trapped as globular inclusions during recrystallisation and necking-down prior to entrainment of the xenoliths in the kimberlite, and were quenched during ascent.

40|$|Scanning Near-field Optical Microscopy (SNOM) is a {{powerful}} and widely-used method in nano- and micro-optics. In aperture SNOM, a dielectric tip with an <b>opaque</b> <b>coating</b> featuring a sub-wavelength aperture at the tip apex is used either to locally illuminate the sample under investigation, or to map the sample’s optical near-fields. In contrast to classical microscopy, SNOM provides access to the evanescent fields at the sample surface and is thus able to break the diffraction limit. In this thesis, several new near-field characterization methods were developed: By combining two SNOMs with fiber tips into a Dual-SNOM setup, samples can be near-field illuminated at a freely chosen position by the first tip, while the second tip scans the sample surface and maps the optical near-fields, thus giving access to the near-field Green’s function. The Dual-SNOM was used for polarization-selective mapping of plasmonic aperture emission and for the investigation of plasmonic modes in metal strip waveguides. Furthermore, two single-tip techniques were developed and were applied to map whispering-gallery modes (WGM) in fused silica microdisk resonators. In scanning thermocouple-probe microscopy, the sample surface is scanned by a miniature thermocouple tip, which is heated by optical absorption and thus converts the optical signal into an electrical signal directly at the measurement location. In the second mapping method for WGM, a sharp, fully metal-coated fiber tip {{is used as a}} scatterer whose position influences the resonance positions and the coupling between WGMs and their respective counter-propagating, degenerate modes. Consequently, the transmission and reflection that can be measured at the ends of the tapered fiber loop which serves for excitation of the WGMs are also modified by the tip’s presence. By correlating the transmission and reflection signals with the tip’s position, highly resolved images were obtained. As an application example of aperture SNOM, near-field mapping of non-broadening plasmonic Airy beams and of plasmonic hot-spots generated by interference of two such beams is demonstrated...|$|R

40|$|Detailed in-situ {{analyses}} of trace-element patterns, N contents, N aggregation state and δ¹³C define two populations of gem-quality diamonds in the A 154 kimberlite; these probably formed {{at different times}} and from different media. Four octahedra with 500 – 1200 ppm N and 12 – 35 % B aggregation represent an older population; flat REE patterns and low Ba + K indicate that they crystallised from fluids {{similar to those in}} many monocrystalline diamonds worldwide. The second population includes coated octahedra and uncoated etched octahedra. On two etched stones, abundant flat-based trigons bottom out 10 – 15 μm below the faces of the stones, in a layer with abundant microinclusions (0. 5 μm diameter) enriched in LREE, Ba and HFSE. Four coated octahedra with 800 – 1200 ppm N and 11 – 20 % B aggregation have trace-element patterns consistent with growth from a fluid with high LREE + Ba, similar to that in the microinclusion-rich layers of the etched octahedra; the contents of LREE and Ba, and Ba/La, increase toward the rims. The coats on these stones typically have higher Ba than the outer cores, but Ba/La may be either higher or lower. δ¹³C is relatively constant (− 5. 5 to − 4. 7 ‰) across one etched octahedron but drops to − 9. 7 ‰ in the microinclusion layer. The core of a coated stone has δ¹³C like that of the microinclusion layer (− 9. 8 to − 10. 5 ‰), but δ¹³C drops to − 13. 9 ‰ in the coat. In the coated stones, core-to-rim decreases in the degree of N aggregation are not correlated with N content, but are accompanied by increases in Ba and LREE. This pattern, the lack of δ¹³C zoning in the one stone analysed, and homogeneous CL images suggest that the coated stones have grown continuously from a range of evolving fluids. The <b>opaque</b> <b>coats</b> appear to represent a final late stage of accelerated growth in some diamonds, rather than random overgrowths on pre-existing diamonds.

40|$|Direct, {{real time}} domain {{observations}} in electrical steel during its magnetisation at 50 Hz and 75 Hz was limited due to low the limited sensitivity and frame sampling {{rate of the}} camera systems available. In this work, a high efficiency Kerr magneto-optic microscope was coupled to a recent commercially available high speed intensified camera. The superior efficiency of the developed system enabled domain dynamics measurement to be made at magnetisation frequencies up to 100 Hz in the real time mode and up to 1. 8 kHz in stroboscopic mode. The application of the system was focussed {{on the study of}} grain-oriented electrical steel. Observations in this work revealed that the behaviour of the domain walls under sinusoidal excitation is far from being ideal sinusoidal motion. The deviations from the ideal behaviour can be summarised as non-sinusoidal, non uniform and non-repetitive domain wall motion. The dependence of the non- uniformity of wall motion and cycle-to-cycle non-repeatability on magnetisation conditions studied by direct real-time observation revealed that under certain conditions the non-uniformity and non-repeatability is much higher. Recommendations have been made on how to reduce losses by adjusting the magnetisation conditions and "magnetic history" of the steel core. The observations confirmed previous researchers' suggestions that the perfection of grain-to-grain orientation and grain size uniformity would improve wall motion uniformity, hence reducing power loss in the material. In addition to Kerr-microscopy observations, the application of a magnetic indicator imaging technique was demonstrated. Moving domains under the insulating, <b>opaque</b> <b>coating</b> on commercial grain-oriented electrical steel were observed using this method. The influence of surface roughness and the effect of coating tension on the domain structure and distortion of bar domains under dynamic magnetisation was observed.

40|$|A {{comparison}} of the diamond productions from Panda (Ekati Mine) and Snap Lake with those from southern Africa shows significant differences: diamonds from the Slave typically are un-resorbed octahedrals or macles, often with <b>opaque</b> <b>coats,</b> and yellow colours are very rare. Diamonds from the Kaapvaal are dominated by resorbed, dodecahedral shapes, coats are absent and yellow colours are common. The first two features suggest exposure to oxidizing fluids/melts during mantle storage and/or transport to the Earth's surface, for the Kaapvaal diamond population. Comparing peridotitic inclusions in diamonds from the central and southern Slave (Panda, DO 27 and Snap Lake kimberlites) and the Kaapvaal indicates that the diamondiferous mantle lithosphere beneath the Slave is chemically less depleted. Most notable are the almost complete absence of garnet inclusions derived from low-Ca harzburgites and a generally lower Mg-number of Slave inclusions. Geothermobarometric calculations suggest that Slave diamonds originally formed at very similar thermal conditions as observed beneath the Kaapvaal (geothermal gradients corresponding to 40 – 42 mW/m 2 surface heat flow), but the diamond source regions subsequently cooled by about 100 – 150 °C to fall on a 37 – 38 mW/m 2 (surface heat flow) conductive geotherm, as is evidenced from touching (re-equilibrated) inclusions in diamonds, and from xenocrysts and xenoliths. In the Kaapvaal, a similar thermal evolution has previously been recognized for diamonds from the De Beers Pool kimberlites. In part very low aggregation levels of nitrogen impurities in Slave diamonds imply that cooling occurred soon after diamond formation. This may relate elevated temperatures during diamond formation to short-lived magmatic perturbations. Generally high Cr-contents of pyrope garnets (inside and outside of diamonds) indicate that the mantle lithosphere beneath the Slave originally formed as a residue of melt extraction at relatively low pressures (within the stability field of spinelperidotites), possibly during the extraction of oceanic crust. After emplacement of this depleted, oceanic mantle lithosphere into the Slave lithosphere during a subduction event, secondary metasomatic enrichment occurred leading to strong re-enrichment of the deeper (&# 62; 140 km) lithosphere. Because {{of the extent of}} this event and the occurrence of lower mantle diamonds, this may be related to an upwelling plume, but it may equally just reflect a long term evolution with lower mantle diamonds being transported upwards in the course of “normal” mantle convection...|$|R

H 577 P ITC 2015 Xiexx, 150 pages :color illustrations; 30 cmEngineering {{surface with}} {{patterned}} functional polymers {{is a crucial}} issue {{in a wide range}} of research fields. The recently developed parallel scanning probe arrays have emerged as promising candidates for desktop nanofabrication with high resolution and high throughput. Yet, there are only a few literature reports on the large-area patterning of functional polymer nanostructures via parallel SPL, with lack of fundamental understandings and practical applications. Moreover, it still remains some inherent limitations in current parallel SPL techniques regarding the resolution, uniformity and versatility. This thesis describes several approaches to tackle the challenges in the two aspects. The statement of challenges and objectives of this research is presented in the beginning, followed by a comprehensive literature review on nanopatterning techniques and a general introduction of methodologies. Next, Chapter 4 introduces the studies on ink transport in direct writing of polymers and applications of liquid polymer matrix. Chapter 5 states a molecular printing approach towards high-throughput fabrication of 3 D polymer brushes. Chapter 6 describes the development of an apertureless polymer pen array to deliver both optical energy and materials. Chapter 7 addresses the uniformity challenge in polymer pen lithography through engineering the tip structure and new materials. Finally, Chapter 8 provides conclusions and future outlooks. First, direct printing of polymer ink materials was studied by dip-pen nanolithography (DPN) and polymer pen lithography (PPL). Two typical polymer inks were investigated, including polyelectrolytes and hygroscopic polymers. For polyelectrolytes, the ink transport was found to be tuned from molecular diffusion to liquid deposition mechanism by adding additives or using polymer pens. Moreover, a catalytic printing was developed for generating metal structures on flexible substrates by employing the hygroscopic polymer ink as delivery matrix and surface-grafted polymer as receiving matrix for catalysts. Second, by combining PPL with surface-initiated polymerization, for the first time we demonstrated the high-throughput generation of 2 D and 3 D complex polymer brush nanostructures over square-centimeter areas. The control on the 3 D structures of polymer brush patterns was achieved by rational design of PPL parameters. Furthermore, the large-area patterned polymer brushes were explored as etching resists for micro/nanofabrication, as well as robust and versatile platforms for bioimmobilization. In addition to material printing, an apertureless polymer pen array was developed to enable serial writing with light at the sub-wavelength scale. This was achieved by combining the self-light-focusing polymer pyramids with an <b>opaque</b> <b>coating</b> on the flat backing regions. The elastomeric pens also show the capability of force-tuned illumination and simultaneous delivery of materials and optical energy. Furthermore, a novel dual-elastomer tip array was designed and fabricated to improve the resolution and the large-area uniformity in PPL. The ultrasharp tip with hard-apex, soft-base layered structure was verified to reduce tip deformation upon contact with the substrate by both experimental and mechanical simulation results, leading to decreased feature size and minimized size variation over large areas. In conclusions, large-area, high-throughput nanopatterning of functional polymers by parallel SPL is achieved through approaches of direct printing, surface-initiated growth and photochemical modification. Meanwhile, the development of apertureless cantilever-free pen array and dual-elastomer tip array will extend the patterning capability of SPL and lower the barrier for desktop nanofabrication. Given the broad applications of functional polymers and lithographic techniques, the work presented here is expected to have great impact on physical, chemical, material, biological and engineering fields.

40|$|Most wood coating {{tests are}} done {{either in a}} short term {{artificial}} weathering chamber or long term on an outdoor rack/fence. In both cases, the coatings are exposed to both ultraviolet radiation and water. This study {{is focused on the}} influence of moisture alone on wood <b>opaque</b> film forming <b>coating</b> failures. As moisture is sorbed into the wood structure, the wood swells in proportion to the volume of water sorbed. As moisture is lost, the wood shrinks in proportion to the volume of the water lost. Moisture in the wood end grain is responsible for coating failure in, for example, window corners and end to end siding. The wood cell wall moisture can be greatly reduced by a process known as acetylation which not only reduces the moisture sorbed in the cell wall but results in high levels of dimensional stability. The reduced moisture uptake along with the stability results in less stress created between the coating wood surface interface improving the performance of the coating and increasing its useful lifetime...|$|R

The genetic formula of these animals at Agouti, Brown and Extension loci was probably aa, B+B+, E+E+. The animals were female or wethers, they were rugged for control or non rugged with a <b>coat</b> <b>opaque</b> to visible and U. V. radiations and cut off at 2. 5, 3. 5 months or one year of wool growth. The colour measurements were made with a colour atlas based on the D. I. N. System. Except for very rare cases, the growing wool (at {{the base of the}} staple) was in the grey scale (which goes from pure white to jet black, without a hue component). With age one could see a greying or silvering of the coloured fleece. This is due to {{an increase in the number}} of white fibers and seems independant from light exposure. Due to exposure to solar radiation there was a fading of the staple to the range ot browns. This means the addition of a spectral colour component: the hue, orange in this case. The fading first affects the tip on the staple, about 2 cm after one year of exposure...|$|R
40|$|O objetivo deste estudo foi {{investigar}} as alterações da matriz extracelular em pele de cães naturalmente infectados por Leishmania chagasi. Foram selecionados 40 cães naturalmente infectados com L. chagasi provenientes de São Luís-MA, agrupados de acordo com a sintomatologia clínica: 20 cães sintomáticos com lesões cutâneas (Grupo I), 20 oligossintomáticos com lesões cutâneas (grupo II) com sorologia positiva para Leishmania pela RIFI e por ELISA e 20 cães sorologicamente negativos para leishmaniose (grupo III), não infectados. Foram realizadas biopsias de pele para análises das alterações histológicas através da técnica de Hematoxilina e Eosina (HE), análises do sistema colágeno pela técnica Picrus Sirius Red e Reticulina de Gordon & Sweets. O sistema elástico foi avaliado pela técnica de Verhoeff. Utililizou-se a Imunoperoxidase Indireta para detecção de Leishmania no tecido cutâneo. As fibras adesivas fibronectina (FN) e laminina (LN) foram detectadas através da técnica de imunohistoquímica com o uso dos anticorpos monoclonais anti-fibronectina e antilaminina, respectivamente. As médias da reatividade sorológica dos animais medida pelo ELISA foram: 0, 44 ± 0, 21, para o grupo I; 0, 23 ± 0, 08 para o grupo II e 0, 037 ± 0, 007, grupo III, com cut-off= 0, 09, resultados estatisticamente significativos. As maiores freqüências de sinais clínicos apresentados pelos cães do grupo I e II foram: emagrecimento, alopecia generalizada, dermatite furfurácea, úlceras localizadas e generalizadas, pelagem opaca e onicogrifose, sendo que estes sinais clínicos têm sido alvos de grandes discussões na literatura, observados tanto em infecções naturais como em experimentais. As alterações histológicas observadas na pele dos cães dos grupos I e II foram hiperqueratose que variava de acentuada a discreta, acantose geralmente acentuada, vacuolização da camada basal. Na derme observou-se um infiltrado inflamatório difuso constituído principalmente por neutrófilos, linfócitos, macrófagos e em alguns casos, mastócitos associados à presença do parasita. Comprovou-se a predominância do colágeno do tipo III na pele dos cães do grupo I (79, 5 ± 10, 0), enquanto nos animais do grupo II os colágenos do tipo I e do tipo III foram observados em proporções variáveis, resultados considerados estatisticamente significativos. A presença do colágeno do tipo III foi confirmada pela técnica da Reticulina de Gordon & Sweets. As fibras elásticas dos grupos I e II apresentavam-se mais desuniformes e espessas quando comparadas as do grupo III. A expressão da fibronectina e da laminina foi reduzida na pele dos animais infectados, estando associada à presença de parasitas. Estes resultados demonstram a intensa degradação dos constituintes da MEC da pele causadas por Leishmania. The {{objective of}} this study was to investigate the extracelular matrix changes in skin of dogs naturally infected by Leishmania chagasi. Fourty dogs were selected naturally infected with L. chagasi come from São Luis-MA, contained in agreement with the clinical symptoms, 20 symptomatic dogs with cutaneous lesions (group I), 20 oligosymptomatic with cutaneous lesions (group II) with positive serologically for Leishmania by Indirect Immunofluorescence Assay (IFAT) and by enzyme-linked immunosorbence assay (ELISA), and 20 dogs negative for leishmaniasis (group III), dogs not infected. Skin biopsies were accomplished for analyses of the histological alterations by technique of Hematoxylin and Eosin (HE), analyses of the collagen system for technical Picrus Sirius Red and Reticulin of Gordon & Sweets. The elastic system was evaluated by the technique of Verhoeff. Indirect Immunoperoxidase for detection of Leishmania in the cutaneous tissue. The fibers adhesive fibronectin (FN) and laminin (LN) they were detected by immunohistochemical technique with the use of the monoclonal antibodies anti-fibronectin and anti-laminin, respectively. The averages of the reactivity serologycal of the animals measure for ELISA were: 0, 44 ± 0, 21, for the group I; 0, 23 ± 0, 08 for the group II and 0, 037 ± 0, 007, group III, with cutoff= 0, 09, results were significant statistically. The largest frequencies of clinical signs presented by the dogs of the group I and II were: weight loss, generalized alopecia, dermatitis, located and widespread ulcers, <b>opaque</b> <b>coat</b> and onychogryphosis, clinical signs have been objectives of great discussions in the literature, observed so much in natural infections as in experimental. The histological alterations observed in the skin of the dogs of the groups I and II were hiperqueratose that varied of accentuated at discreet, acantosys generally accentuated, vacuolization of the basal membrane. In the derme it was observed an infiltrated inflammatory diffuse constituted mainly by neutrophils, lynphocytes, macrophages and in some cases, mast cell associated to the presence of the parasite. It was proven the prevalence of the collagen of the type III in the skin of the dogs of the group I (79, 5 ± 10, 0), while in the animals of the group II the collagens of the type I and of the type III was observed in variable proportions, results considered statistically significant. The presence of the collagen of the type III was confirmed by the technique of Reticulin of Gordon & Sweets. The elastic fibers of the groups I and II seemed more disforms and thicken when compared the one of the group III. The expression of the fibronectin and of the laminin it was reduced in the skin of the infected animals, being associated to the presence of parasites. These results demonstrate the intense degradation of the extracelular matrix in the skin caused by Leishmania...|$|R
40|$|Young basalts from Kilauea Volcano, Hawai'i, {{frequently}} feature opaque surface coatings, 1 – 80 μm thick, {{composed of}} amorphous silica and Fe-Ti oxides. These coatings {{are the product}} of interaction of the basaltic surface with volcanically-derived acidic fluids. Previous workers have identified these coatings in a variety of contexts on Hawai'i, but the timescales of coating development, coating growth rates, and factors controlling lateral coating heterogeneity were largely unconstrained. We sampled and analyzed young lava flows (of varying ages, from hours to ~ 40 years) along Kilauea's southwest and east rift zones to characterize variation in silica coating properties across the landscape. Coating thickness varies as a function of flow age, flow surface type, and proximity to acid sources like local fissure vents and regional plumes emitted from Kilauea Caldera and Pu'u O'o. Silica coatings that form in immediate proximity to acid sources are more chemically pure than those forming in higher pH environments, which contain significant Al and Fe. Incipient siliceous alteration was observed on basalt surfaces as young as 8 days old, but periods of a year or more are required to develop contiguous coatings with obvious <b>opaque</b> coloration. Inferred <b>coating</b> growth rates vary with environmental conditions but were typically 1 - 5 μm/year. Coatings form preferentially on flow surfaces with glassy outer layers, such as spatter ramparts, volcanic bombs and dense pahoehoe breakouts, due to glass strain weakening during cooling. Microtextural evidence suggests that the silica coatings form both by in situ dissolution-reprecipitation and by deposition of silica mobilized in solution. Thin films of water, acidified by contact with volcanic vapors, dissolved near-surface basalt, then precipitated amorphous silica in place, mobilizing more soluble cations. Additional silica was transported to and deposited on the surface by silica-bearing altering fluids derived from the basalt interior...|$|R
