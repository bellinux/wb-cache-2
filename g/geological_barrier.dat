40|$|Abstract The {{study and}} {{management}} of groundwaters necessitates proper identification of the involved aquifers.

Thus, all parts of an aquifer have to be hydraulically inter-connected, a property that causes a substantial degree of homogenization of {{the properties of the}} water hosted in each aquifer, providing the means to delineate specific aquifers. Aquifers are often defined by stratigraphie terms, but these are: (a) thick, constituting a multitude of aquifers that are separated by aquicludes; and (b) extend over large regions, with topo-graphic and <b>geological</b> <b>barriers.</b> Thus, the stratigraphie terms are mis-leading when applied to define aquifers.

40|$|International audienceIn {{the case}} of {{variable}} porosity calculations (due to precipitation/dissolution in a calculation coupled with chemistry), the permeability and diffusion coefficients in different porous media vary with porosity. In {{the case of}} nuclear waste storage, solute transport {{is supposed to be}} diffusion-controlled because of the extremely low permeability of surrounding materials, like concrete or clay. Various experiments and also different reactive transport modeling show a possible clogging due to the alkaline perturbation at the concrete/bentonite or concrete/clay interfaces (Gaucher et al., 2004; Burnol et al. 2006; Trotignon et al., 2007; De Windt et al., 2008). The decrease of porosity will therefore impact the extent of diffusion of all chemical elements, including the radionuclides, through the engineered and <b>geological</b> <b>barriers.</b> Taking into account the feedback effect of porosity change due to the chemical reactivity is therefore an important issue to simulate the migration of radionuclides out of the disposal drift. The chemical conditions found in deep nuclear waste storage rise some concern about the migration of radionuclides at the interface between the engineered and <b>geological</b> <b>barriers</b> where the alkaline perturbation could cause a "clogging" and therefore could impact the diffusion-controlled process itself. In this poster, a new general "Power Law" which connects the effective diffusion coefficient and the porosity evolution is described and tested. The conclusion is that if the version V 1. 0 /V 1. 2 is used to study the diffusion of radionuclides in the surrounding zone of a waste nuclear disposal, the effective diffusion could be overestimated even with the Millington Law. A modified version of TouhgReact with diffusion harmonic weighting gave the same results as HYTEC code, both in the case of weak feedback(power= 1 / 3) or strong feedback (power= 2) in the new "Power Law".
