5|$|Gundamma <b>Katha</b> was remade in Tamil as Manithan Maravillai (1962) by Vijaya Vauhini Studios. Chakrapani {{directed}} the remake and Gemini Ganesan reprised Rama Rao from the original. M. S. Sundari Bai, K. Sarangkapani, and E. R. Sahadev reprised {{the roles of}} Suryakantam, Ramana Reddy and Kaleswara Rao respectively. Manithan Maravillai was Nageswara Rao's 100th film as an actor; Gundamma <b>Katha</b> became a notable film for both Rama Rao and Nageswara Rao as they completed 100 films as actors with {{two versions of the}} same film. Unlike the original film, Manithan Maravillai was a commercial failure.|$|E
5|$|In November 2007, a Hyderabad-based company named Goldstone Technologies {{acquired}} the film negative rights to 14 Telugu films produced by Vijaya Vauhini Studios, including Mayabazar (1957) and Gundamma <b>Katha,</b> to release colourised, digitally remastered versions. The remastered and colourised version of Mayabazar, released in January 2010, was commercially successful but Goldstone Technologies {{decided not to}} remaster the remaining 13 films, including Gundamma <b>Katha,</b> saying most of the producers who sold {{the rights to the}} negatives to television channels lost control over them. Goldstone further explained that a number of legal issues over ownership and copyright issues arise whenever producers try to do something on their own.|$|E
5|$|Once {{written by}} Shatanand Swami, {{this book was}} {{verified}} and authenticated by Swaminarayan. He was much pleased to read the book. Swaminarayan then asked his disciples to do <b>Katha</b> of Satsangi Jeevan.|$|E
5|$|The Kena is {{the oldest}} of the verse Upanisads {{followed}} by probably the <b>Katha,</b> Isa, Svetasvatara, and Mundaka. All these Upanisads were composed probably in the last few centuries BCE.|$|E
5|$|As Doggett {{approaches}} {{the body of}} Jeb's latest victim, he has a flashback of when he found Luke's body. Doggett storms off, but Reyes refuses to let it go, finally revealing her theory: she believes that the boy's murder {{was part of a}} “thread of evil,” an interconnected series of terrible events. Meanwhile, <b>Katha</b> returns home with her daughter and finds Jeb there. He insists that it wasn't him who committed the murder, and pleads to his sister for help. <b>Katha</b> calls the agents and tries to separate her daughter from Jeb, but he realizes what she is planning and uses his niece as a hostage. Before Jeb can shoot Doggett, Reyes incapacitates him with a round to the throat.|$|E
5|$|Chakrapani {{decided to}} retain only the {{background}} of Gundamma's family from the original and rewrote the remaining script, taking inspiration from William Shakespeare comedy, The Taming of the Shrew. Chakrapani killed the character of Gundamma's cowardly husband because he felt that a husband who cannot answer his wife's questions is not eligible to be included. Kamalakara Kameswara Rao was chosen to direct the film. Chakrapani named the central character Gundamma in the remake {{after one of the}} characters in the original, despite a lack of nativity. Nagi Reddy's family members and the employees of the Vijaya Vauhini Studios used to ask him Gundamma <b>Katha</b> Entha varaku vachchindi? ("What is the progress in Gundamma's story?"), which prompted Nagi Reddy to title the film Gundamma <b>Katha</b> after considering various options.|$|E
5|$|Doggett soon attacks Mulder {{for looking}} into his son's case, but Reyes {{explains}} {{why they are}} investigating. She reveals that Bob Harvey, a suspect in Luke's murder, died in the car crash in New Orleans. Reyes stresses her vision's importance, but Doggett dismisses it. Reyes goes to visit Jeb's sister, <b>Katha,</b> and learns {{he did not know}} Bob Harvey. While Reyes is there, <b>Katha</b> receives a call from Jeb, but tells him to call later. As Jeb leaves the phone booth, he kills a female motorist. Meanwhile, Doggett learns from Scully that she has suffered a placental abruption. He asks her what made her start to believe in the paranormal. She says she realized she was “afraid to believe.” Scully later tells Mulder to keep trying to help Doggett.|$|E

5|$|Stephen Phillips {{places the}} early Upanishads in the 800 to 300 BCE range. He {{summarizes}} the current Indological opinion {{to be that}} the Brhadaranyaka, Chandogya, Isha, Taittiriya, Aitareya, Kena, <b>Katha,</b> Mundaka, and Prasna Upanishads are all pre-Buddhist and pre-Jain, while Svetasvatara and Mandukya overlap with the earliest Buddhist and Jain literature.|$|E
5|$|The Maitrayaniya Upanishad, likely {{composed}} {{in a later}} century than <b>Katha</b> and Shvetashvatara Upanishads but before Patanjali's Yoga Sutra, mentions sixfold yoga method – breath control (pranayama), introspective withdrawal of senses (pratyahara), meditation (dhyana), mind concentration (dharana), philosophical inquiry/creative reasoning (tarka), and absorption/intense spiritual union (samadhi).|$|E
5|$|Gundamma <b>Katha</b> was a {{profitable}} venture for Vijaya Vauhini Studios; it completed a 100-day run in 17 theatres across Andhra Pradesh, and completed a silver-jubilee {{run at the}} Durga Kalamandir, Vijayawada. It became the first Telugu film to be run for 100 days with three screenings per day in Hyderabad. The silver-jubilee celebrations were not held, and the planned budget for the event was donated to a fundraiser who was active during the Sino-Indian War.|$|E
5|$|In 1976 Giridhar narrated a <b>Katha</b> on Ramcharitmanas to Swami Karpatri, {{who advised}} {{him not to}} marry, to stay a lifelong Brahmachari (celibate bachelor) and to take {{initiation}} in a Vaishnava Sampradaya (a sect worshipping Vishnu, Krishna, or Rama as the supreme God). Giridhar took vairagi (renouncer) initiation or Virakta Diksha in the Ramananda Sampradaya on the Kartika full-moon day of 19 November 1983 from Shri Ramcharandas Maharaj Phalahari. He now {{came to be known}} as Rambhadradas.|$|E
5|$|Kanhopatra's {{life has}} been recounted in a 1937 Marathi film Kanhopatra written and {{directed}} by Bhalji Pendharkar. She was also the subject of the popular 1931 Marathi drama named Sant Kanhopatra, in which Bal Gandharva played the lead. Kanhopatra's abhangas Aga Vaikunthichya Raya and Patita tu pavanahe; and Nako Devaraya Anta Aata are used in that drama and in the 1963 Marathi film Sadhi Manase respectively. A 2014 short film <b>Katha</b> Sant Kanhopatra by Sumeet video featured Pallavi Subhash as Kanhopatra.|$|E
5|$|One {{chronology}} {{assumes that}} the Aitareya, Taittiriya, Kausitaki, Mundaka, Prasna, and <b>Katha</b> Upanishads has Buddha's influence, and is consequently placed after the 5th century BCE, while another proposal questions this assumption and dates it independent of Buddha's date of birth. After these Principal Upanishads are typically placed the Kena, Mandukya and Isa Upanishads, but other scholars date these differently. Not much {{is known about the}} authors except for those, like Yajnavalkayva and Uddalaka, mentioned in the texts. A few women discussants, such as Gargi and Maitreyi, the wife of Yajnavalkayva, also feature occasionally.|$|E
5|$|Rambhadracharya is {{a scholar}} of 14 {{languages}} and can speak 22 languages in total, including Sanskrit, Hindi, English, French, Bhojpuri, Maithili, Oriya, Gujarati, Punjabi, Marathi, Magadhi, Awadhi, and Braj. He has composed poems and literary works in many Indian languages, including Sanskrit, Hindi, and Awadhi. He has translated many of his works of poetry and prose into other languages. He delivers <b>Katha</b> programmes in various languages, including Hindi, Bhojpuri, and Gujarati.|$|E
5|$|The Upanishadic age was {{characterized}} by a pluralism of worldviews. While some Upanishads have been deemed 'monistic', others, including the <b>Katha</b> Upanishad, are dualistic. The Maitri {{is one of the}} Upanishads that inclines more toward dualism, thus grounding classical Samkhya and Yoga schools of Hinduism, in contrast to the non-dualistic Upanishads at the foundation of its Vedanta school. They contain a plurality of ideas.|$|E
5|$|Doggett finally {{embraces the}} memory of his vision. Mulder tells him that when he worked in violent crimes and saw the horrible things people did, he began to think of evil like a disease that {{infected}} people. Some lack immunity to this disease of evil because of some tragedy in their lives. Jeb dies while Reyes and <b>Katha</b> are in the room. After the doctors leave, Katha’s eyes glow, much like Jeb's. She hits Reyes over the head with an oxygen tank and takes her gun. Before she can execute Reyes for killing her brother, Doggett appears and wrestles her to the ground.|$|E
5|$|Gundamma <b>Katha</b> {{is based}} {{partially}} on William Shakespeare's play The Taming of the Shrew. It {{focuses on a}} widow named Gundamma and her two daughters. The film's main theme is the step-daughter Lakshmi facing problems because of the widow, and the former's suitor teaching the latter a lesson. Using the first conversation between Gundamma and Lakshmi, in which the former abuses the latter for disturbing her sleep, Narasaraju introduces Gundamma's mindset and behaviour. Further incidents include the dismissal of a server fired from a hotel after refusing {{to work as a}} servant in Gundamma's house, and Ghantaiah explaining Gundamma's character to Ramabhadraiah.|$|E
5|$|N. T. Rama Rao and Akkineni Nageswara Rao {{were chosen}} as the male leads, making Gundamma <b>Katha</b> their 10th film together; the film was Rama Rao's 100th film as an actor and Nageswara Rao's 99th as an actor. Savitri and Jamuna were {{chosen as the}} female leads. Jamuna's character, Saroja, was created by Chakrapani for the film, taking cues from The Taming of the Shrew. S. V. Ranga Rao, Ramana Reddy and Rajanala Kaleswara Rao were cast in {{supporting}} roles. Haranath and L. Vijayalakshmi were chosen to play Gundamma's son and daughter-in-law respectively. M. Pithambaram and T. P. Bhaktavatsalam provided the make-up.|$|E
5|$|Rama Rao's son Nandamuri Balakrishna and Nageswara Rao's son Akkineni Nagarjuna, who {{established}} {{themselves as}} actors in Telugu cinema, planned to remake Gundamma <b>Katha</b> but withdrew {{after failing to}} find a suitable replacement for Suryakantam. In 2012, D. Ramanaidu planned to produce the remake of the film with Rama Rao's grandson N. T. Rama Rao Jr. and Nagarjuna's son Naga Chaitanya playing the leading male characters but the plans were cancelled. In April 2016, Mohan Babu expressed interest in remaking the film with his son Manchu Vishnu and Raj Tarun in the lead roles. He added that G. Nageswara Reddy would direct the remake which he would announce after acquiring the rights.|$|E
5|$|Trivikrama was a noted {{scholar in}} the court of King Indra III. His {{classics}} were Nalachampu (915), the earliest in champu style in Sanskrit, Damayanti <b>Katha,</b> Madalasachampu and Begumra plates. Legend has it that Goddess Saraswati helped him in his effort to compete with a rival in the kings court. Jinasena was the spiritual preceptor and guru of Amoghavarsha I. A theologian, his contributions are Dhavala and Jayadhavala (written with another theologian Virasena). These writings are named after their patron king who was also called Athishayadhavala. Other contributions from Jinasena were Adipurana, later completed by his disciple Gunabhadra, Harivamsha and Parshvabhyudaya.|$|E
5|$|Chiranjeevi {{wanted his}} brother Nagendra Babu {{to work in}} films after graduating from college. To gain {{experience}} in film production, Babu worked at the Geetha Arts company. He started a company named Anjana Productions after his mother K. Anjana Devi. He planned to make an unconventional film without considering Chiranjeevi's on-screen image as an action hero. After watching Sankarabharanam (1980) and Sindhu Bhairavi (1985), Babu approached Chiranjeevi's mentor K. Balachander to direct his maiden production venture. They worked together on Idi <b>Katha</b> Kaadu (1979) and 47 Rojulu (1981); he played the antagonist in both films. Balachander agreed to direct the film; he chose the concept of national integration and rural development after watching Anna Hazare developing Ralegan Siddhi, a village in Maharashtra. He was also inspired by a retired Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer's act of adopting his village in West Godavari district.|$|E
5|$|Tulsidas {{hints at}} several places in his works, {{that he had}} met {{face to face with}} Hanuman and Rama. The {{detailed}} account of his meetings with Hanuman and Rama are given in the Bhaktirasbodhini of Priyadas. According to Priyadas' account, Tulsidas used to visit the woods outside Varanasi for his morning ablutions with a water pot. On his return to the city, he used to offer the remaining water to a certain tree. This quenched the thirst of a Preta (a type of ghost believed to be ever thirsty for water), who appeared to Tulsidas and offered him a boon. Tulsidas said he wished to see Rama with his eyes, to which the Preta responded that it was beyond him. However, the Preta said that he could guide Tulsidas to Hanuman, who could grant the boon Tulsidas asked for. The Preta told Tulsidas that Hanuman comes everyday disguised in the mean attire of a leper to listen to his <b>Katha,</b> he is the first to arrive and last to leave.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the country}} has adopted the metric system as its {{official}} standard since 1968, traditional units of measurement are still commonplace. The customary units of area employed in the Terai region – such as <b>katha,</b> bigha, etc. – sound {{similar to those used}} elsewhere in South Asia. However, they vary markedly in size, as they seem to have been standardised to different measures of area. For instance, a <b>katha</b> in Nepal is arbitrarily set at 338.63 m², while a <b>katha</b> in Bangladesh means about 67 m² of land area. In addition to native ones, imperial units pertaining to length (specifically inch and foot) and metric units such as kilogram and litre are also fairly common in everyday trade and commerce.|$|E
