5|$|Wright left Taliesin and the 600-acre Taliesin Estate to the <b>Frank</b> <b>Lloyd</b> Wright Foundation (founded {{by him and}} {{his third}} wife in 1940) upon his death in 1959. This {{organization}} oversaw renovations to the estate until late 1992 upon the founding of Taliesin Preservation, Inc., a nonprofit organization dedicated to preserving the building and estate in Wisconsin. Taliesin mostly operates as a museum, however it is still occupied by former students of Wright's in addition to students at the <b>Frank</b> <b>Lloyd</b> Wright School of Architecture on a seasonal basis. The property was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1976 and is being considered {{as part of a}} UNESCO World Heritage Site. In addition to the residence, there are four <b>Frank</b> <b>Lloyd</b> Wright-designed buildings on the estate: the Romeo and Juliet Windmill, designed by Wright in 1896; Tan-y-Deri, the home he designed for Jane and Andrew Porter, his sister and brother-in-law; the Hillside Home School, originally designed in 1901 for his aunts' school, and Midway Barns, a farming facility.|$|E
5|$|Initially, Raymond and Noémi {{worked with}} <b>Frank</b> <b>Lloyd</b> Wright at Taliesin in Spring Green, Wisconsin. In 1917 he enlisted with the United States Army serving {{overseas}} with the American Expeditionary Force. Upon his {{discharge from the}} army and his return to New York, Wright persuaded {{him to go to}} Tokyo with him to work on the Imperial Hotel.|$|E
5|$|Designed by Alden B. Dow, {{a student}} of <b>Frank</b> <b>Lloyd</b> Wright, the Phoenix Art Museum was {{constructed}} in a single year, opening in November 1959.

5000|$|... "I'll Make a Man of You" [...] is a World War I {{recruiting}} {{song that}} was sung {{across the country}} in hopes of rallying young men to enlist in the military. It is sung from a flirtatious young woman's perspective of how she dates military men in order to turn them into better soldiers. It was written and composed by Arthur Wimperis and Herman Finck in 1914. The song was also showcased in <b>Frank</b> <b>Lloyd's</b> Cavalcade, and in the musical and film Oh, What a Lovely War!.|$|R
5|$|Manhattan is {{also home}} {{to some of the most}} {{extensive}} art collections in the world, both contemporary and historical, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), the Frick Collection, the Whitney Museum of American Art, and the <b>Frank</b> <b>Lloyd</b> Wright-designed Guggenheim Museum. The Upper East Side has many art galleries, and the downtown neighborhood of Chelsea is known for its more than 200 art galleries that are home to modern art from both upcoming and established artists.|$|E
5|$|The site of Chicago Pile-1 is a National Historic Landmark and {{is marked}} by the Henry Moore {{sculpture}} Nuclear Energy. Robie House, a <b>Frank</b> <b>Lloyd</b> Wright building acquired by the university in 1963, is also a National Historic Landmark, as is room 405 of the George Herbert Jones Laboratory, where Glenn T. Seaborg and his team {{were the first to}} isolate plutonium. Hitchcock Hall, an undergraduate dormitory, is on the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in {{the early}} 20th century, the {{building}} underwent three major renovations. In the first, from 1905 to 1907, <b>Frank</b> <b>Lloyd</b> Wright was retained to remake the interior spaces. In keeping with contemporary tastes, Wright's design covered Root's elaborate wrought iron finishes with white carved Carrara marble surfaces. Wright was highly regarded by the public at this point, and his changes brought enhanced status to the building, making the Rookery {{one of the most}} sought after buildings of Chicago. Some of Wright's other changes included incorporating simplified ironwork and adding his trademark style planters and light fixtures.|$|E

50|$|Although <b>Frank,</b> <b>Lloyd's</b> {{eldest son}} by Maria, outshone {{his father in}} terms of pure philanthropy, the {{evidence}} suggests that Lloyd was also a good employer. Writing about his Bow Bridge paper mill and printing works in 1875, William Glenny Crory described an orderly well-run operation employing 200 apparently contented staff. In 1862-63, Lloyd's Weekly raised £3,676 (£410,000 now) for the victims of the cotton famine in Lancashire partly from the proceeds of above-average sales of the paper in December 1862. Worker participation was introduced at the paper mills in Kent during Edward's lifetime. Frank took this much further and built a model village for the paper workers in the 1920s.|$|R
5|$|Buildings {{to which}} Finnish American {{architect}} Eero Saarinen has contributed have received six awards, tied with the architectural firm of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill. Louis I. Kahn has been honored five times. Buildings by <b>Frank</b> <b>Lloyd</b> Wright have received this award four times, and both Ludwig Mies van der Rohe {{as well as}} the firm Pei Cobb Freed & Partners have each had three of their buildings honored. Of the 48 projects that have received this award, only two, Eames House and the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, had women as contributing architects.|$|E
5|$|From 1898 to 1909, {{architect}} <b>Frank</b> <b>Lloyd</b> Wright {{lived and}} worked out of his home and studio in Oak Park, Illinois. In Oak Park, Wright had developed his concept of Prairie School architecture, designing houses primarily for local clients. In 1903, Wright began designing a home for Edwin Cheney, but quickly took a liking for Cheney's wife. Wright and Mamah Borthwick Cheney began an affair and separated from their spouses in 1909. They met up in Florence, Italy, in February 1910, where Wright made sketches of his future studio. He was particularly inspired by Michelozzo's Villa Medici in Fiesole because it was built into a hill, had commanding views of its surroundings, and featured gardens on two levels.|$|E
5|$|Hotel Valley Ho is a {{historic}} hotel in Scottsdale, Arizona. Also called the Valley Ho and, for 28 years, the Ramada Valley Ho, the hotel was originally designed by Edward L. Varney, a student of <b>Frank</b> <b>Lloyd</b> Wright. It first opened in 1956 with a forward-looking and futuristic design. Movie stars and famous baseball players stayed, and the building quickly became known for its trendsetting guests and its fashionable atmosphere. The success of the venture resulted in expansion in 1958, with two additional two-story wings of guest rooms extending to the north. Though initially proposed by Varney, a central tower of guest rooms, rising over the lobby, was not built.|$|E

5|$|In 1961, the Dammasch State Hospital mental {{hospital}} {{opened on the}} west side of the community. Gordon House, the only house in Oregon to be designed by architect <b>Frank</b> <b>Lloyd</b> Wright, was built in 1963 near what became Charbonneau and moved to the Oregon Garden in 2001. Wilsonville was flooded in 1964 and the first fire station was built in 1966. Wilsonville was incorporated as a city in 1969 with a population of about 1,000. In 1971, the planned community of Charbonneau on the south side of the river was annexed into the city the year after development began.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, Greek Orthodox churches {{beginning}} in the 1950s tended to use a large central dome with a ring of windows at its base evocative of the central dome of Hagia Sophia, rather than more recent or more historically common Byzantine types, such as the Greek-cross-octagon or five-domed quincunx plans. Examples include Annunciation Greek Orthodox Church, completed in 1961 but designed by <b>Frank</b> <b>Lloyd</b> Wright in 1957, Ascension Greek Orthodox Cathedral of Oakland (1960), and Annunciation Greek Orthodox Cathedral in Atlanta (1967). The use of a large central dome in American Greek Orthodox churches continued in the 1960s and 1970s before moving toward smaller Middle Byzantine domes, or versions of Early Christian basilicas.|$|E
5|$|The Isidore H. Heller House {{is a house}} {{located at}} 5132 South Woodlawn Avenue in the Hyde Park {{community}} area of Chicago in Cook County, Illinois, United States. The house was designed by American architect <b>Frank</b> <b>Lloyd</b> Wright. The design is credited {{as one of the}} turning points in Wright's shift to geometric, Prairie School architecture, which is defined by horizontal lines, flat or hipped roofs with broad overhanging eaves, windows grouped in horizontal bands, and an integration with the landscape, which is meant to evoke native Prairie surroundings.|$|E

50|$|Sergeant <b>Frank</b> Eric <b>Lloyd</b> (20 August 1909 - 21 October 1992) was {{a member}} of the British South Africa Police in Southern Rhodesia from 1932 to 1955. He is best known as author of Rhodesian Patrol, an autobiographical account of his time in the BSAP.|$|R
50|$|With {{these early}} {{critical}} and box office winners, Ratoff was in constant demand {{as a character}} actor throughout the 1930s, many in B-pictures but increasingly with young directors who {{would go on to}} important careers. Because of his large, shambling frame and uncertain command of English, he was often typecast as a villain in an American setting or an 'authentic' foreigner in the dozens of 1930s films that recreated a glamorous fictional Europe on the Hollywood backlot. In <b>Frank</b> <b>Lloyd's</b> Under Two Flags (1936), he was in the French Foreign Legion; in Howard Hawks' The Road to Glory (1936), a Russian sergeant in World War 1 France. His role as a comic showbiz caricature was also popular, especially in Pre-Code backstage musicals, most famously as Mae West's lawyer in I'm No Angel (1933).|$|R
