5|$|The <b>Intergroups</b> in the European Parliament are {{informal}} fora which gather MEPs {{from various}} political groups around any topic. They do not express {{the view of}} the European Parliament. They serve a double purpose: to address a topic which is transversal to several committees and in a less formal manner. Their daily secretariat can be run either through the office of MEPs or through interest groups, be them corporate lobbies or NGOs. The favored access to MEPs which the organization running the secretariat enjoys can be one explanation to the multiplication of <b>Intergroups</b> in the 1990s. They are now strictly regulated and financial support, direct or otherwise (via Secretariat staff, for example) must be officially specified in a declaration of financial interests. Also <b>Intergroups</b> are established or renewed {{at the beginning of each}} legislature through a specific process. Indeed, the proposal for the constitution or renewal of an Intergroup must be supported by at least 3 political groups whose support is limited to a specific number of proposals in proportion to their size (for example, for the legislature 2014-2019, the EPP or S political groups could support 22 proposals whereas the Greens/EFA or the EFDD political groups only 7).|$|E

40|$|<b>Intergroup</b> leadership-leadership of {{collaborative}} performance of different organizational groups or organizations-is associated with unique <b>intergroup</b> challenges {{that are not}} addressed by traditional leadership theories. To address this lacuna, we describe a theory of <b>intergroup</b> leadership. Firmly grounded in research on social identity and <b>intergroup</b> relations, the theory proposes that effective <b>intergroup</b> performance rests on the leader's ability to construct an <b>intergroup</b> relational identity. We describe key leadership actions to establish such an identity...|$|R
40|$|<b>Intergroup</b> {{emotions}} theory {{seeks to}} understand and improve <b>intergroup</b> relations {{by focusing on the}} emotions engendered by belonging to, and by deriving identity from, a social group (processes called self-categorization and identification). <b>Intergroup</b> emotions are shaped by the very different ways in which members of different groups see group-relevant objects and events. These emotions come, with time and repetition, to be part and parcel of group membership itself. Once evoked, specific <b>intergroup</b> emotions direct and regulate specific <b>intergroup</b> behaviors. This approach has implications for theories of emotion as well as of <b>intergroup</b> relations. Because <b>intergroup</b> emotions derive from self-categorization and identification and because they strongly influence <b>intergroup</b> behavior, <b>intergroup</b> emotions theory provides an innovative framework for attempts to reduce prejudice and improve <b>intergroup</b> relations.

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{investigated the}} role of intragroup communication in <b>intergroup</b> conflict (de-) escalation. Experiment 1 {{examined the effects of}} intragroup communication (vs. individual thought) and anticipated face-to-face <b>intergroup</b> contact (vs. no anticipated face-to-face <b>intergroup</b> contact). The group discussions of stigmatized group members who anticipated face-to-face <b>intergroup</b> contact revolved more around <b>intergroup</b> hostility. This boosted ingroup identification and increased social creativity but also led to steeling (a hardening of perceived <b>intergroup</b> relations). In Experiment 2, new participants listened to the taped group discussions. The discussions of groups anticipating face-to-face <b>intergroup</b> contact evoked more <b>intergroup</b> anxiety-related discomfort than discussions of groups not anticipating face-to-face <b>intergroup</b> encounters. Together, these results support the idea that steeling is a defensive reaction to prepare for an anxiety-arousing <b>intergroup</b> confrontation. Although steeling is also associated with positive consequences such as increased ingroup solidarity and social creativity, this hardened stance may be an obstacle to conflict de-escalation...|$|R

40|$|Based on two {{cross-sectional}} probability samples (Study 1 : N = 1, 382, Study 2 : N = 1, 587), {{we studied}} {{the interplay between}} positive and negative <b>intergroup</b> contact, different types of <b>intergroup</b> emotions (i. e., episodic <b>intergroup</b> emotions encountered during contact and more general chronic <b>intergroup</b> emotions), and outgroup behavior {{in the context of}} <b>intergroup</b> relations between non-immigrant Germans and foreigners living in Germany. In Study 1, we showed that positive and negative contact are related to specific episodic <b>intergroup</b> emotions (i. e., anger, fear and happiness). Results of Study 2 indicate an indirect effect of episodic <b>intergroup</b> emotions encountered during contact experiences on specific behavioral tendencies directed at outgroup members via more chronic situation-independent <b>intergroup</b> emotions. As expected, anger predicted approaching (discriminatory) behavioral tendencies (i. e., aggression) while fear predicted avoidance.

5000|$|Two key {{psychological}} processes, {{anxiety and}} trust, {{have been identified}} as potential mechanisms for why imaging outgroup contact is effective for improving <b>intergroup</b> relations. Anxiety often characterizes and is engendered by <b>intergroup</b> encounters. For instance, <b>intergroup</b> contact between African-Americans and European-Americans frequently produces higher levels of <b>intergroup</b> anxiety compared to same-race interactions. [...] Researchers however show that imaging a positive <b>intergroup</b> interaction leads to reductions in anxiety, with anxiety being a mediator between the relationship of imagined contact and improved <b>intergroup</b> attitudes.|$|R
40|$|Two studies {{examined}} the relationship between categorization, <b>intergroup</b> anxiety and intel group attitudes (<b>intergroup</b> bias and negative affect). Study I consisted of a survey of 236 British and Japanese nationals. Study 2 was a longitudinal study of 54 Japanese students studying in the UK. Of the three categorization variables (interpersonal, super-ordinate and <b>intergroup),</b> only intel group categorization was shown to have a relationship to generalized <b>intergroup</b> attitudes. In addition, <b>intergroup</b> anxiety and quality of contact were associated with ingroup bias and negative affect to the outgroup. Study 2 revealed an interaction between <b>intergroup</b> categorization and quality of contact in predicting negative affect. <b>Intergroup</b> anxiety was also associated with increased <b>intergroup</b> categorization. It is concluded that the effects of categorization during contact are still poorly understood and that <b>intergroup</b> anxiety is a far more powerful variable in contact than the current literature acknowledges...|$|R
40|$|Although racial {{prejudice}} remains a prevalent social phenomenon, {{research has demonstrated}} that positive contact - most notably <b>intergroup</b> friendship - predicts decreased prejudice. Whites, however, may be hesitant to develop <b>intergroup</b> friendships because they experience negative emotions like anxiety when {{faced with the prospect of}} interacting with outgroup members (i. e., Blacks). Past research has countered this obstacle by relying on manipulations that reframe how individuals feel about <b>intergroup</b> interactions to increase willingness to engage with outgroup members. Building on this framework, I tested whether savoring a previous <b>intergroup</b> interaction could increase friendship willingness by increasing positive <b>intergroup</b> emotions (Study 1) and whether processing style would moderate this effect (Study 2). Results indicated that although White individuals were able to savor previous interactions with Blacks, encouraging them to do so did little to increase <b>intergroup</b> friendship willingness and this effect was not mediated by positive <b>intergroup</b> emotions. Moreover, processing style did not moderate this effect. However, trait savoring was linked with both positive <b>intergroup</b> emotions and increased <b>intergroup</b> friendship willingness. These findings suggest that although savoring a previous <b>intergroup</b> interaction may not be an effective way to encourage <b>intergroup</b> friendship willingness, individual differences in the capacity to savor may explain why some are more willing to seek <b>intergroup</b> friendships...|$|R
