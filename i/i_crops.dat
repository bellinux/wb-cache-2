Backpmpagation eural networks {{have been used in}} the past to model this problem, but use of the backpropagation algorithm for training introduces limitations and difficulties. Therefore, it is useful to explore alternative learning algorithms. Genetic algorithms provide an effective technique for searching large spaces, and have been used in the past to train neural networks. This paper describes the development of a genetic algorithm/neural network hybrid in which a genetic algorithm is used to find weight assignments for a neural network that predicts aflatoxin contamination levels in peanuts based on environmental data...|$|E

40|$|For {{the last}} decades, {{agricultural}} ecosystems {{have been a}} key biome for diverse socio-economical, environmental and climatic issues. And one of these climatic issues is just BVOC (Biogenic Volatile Organic Compounds) emission from terrestrial ecosystems. Indeed, those compounds which are mostly emitted by plants play a great role in the atmospheric chemistry, thereby influencing the Earth surface radiative budget and the tropospheric air quality. However, so far, very few is known about BVOC exchange by crops, implying that huge uncertainties remain about qualifying, quantifying and determining sources/sinks and driving mechanisms of BVOC exchanges between croplands ecosystems and the atmosphere. We present here the first long term BVOC fluxes measurement study conducted on maize (2012) and winter wheat (2013), respectively the second and first most important worldwide crops (FAOSTAT). BVOC exchange was measured using the disjunct by mass scanning eddy covariance technique (+ PTR-MS, Ionicon) at the Lonzée Terrestrial Observatory (ICOS site) in Belgium. Main results are: (<b>i)</b> <b>crops</b> emit mainly methanol; (ii) BVOC emission from studied crops is lower than in literature, suggesting that agricultural ecosystems are poor BVOC exchangers; (iii) soil is a significant BVOC source...|$|E

40|$|Data of 145 and 69 {{earthworm}} communities from managed {{and natural}} ecosystems, respectively, of four continents and 15 tropical countries were analysed. The {{aim of the}} study was to separate the influence of phylogenetic, environmental and agricultural factors on the structure of earthworm communities in agroecosystems, and to evaluate their relative importance in the whole soil macrofauna community. Earthworms comprise 40 - 90 % of macrofaunal biomass in most ecosystems except for annually cropped systems. Three major conclusions were drawn from the analysis of community structure (regional analysis) : (<b>i)</b> <b>crops</b> were, independently of region, characterized by a loss of native species and by the dominance of exotic endogeics; (ii) pastures were highly heterogenous in terms of native or exotic species dominance; (iii) native species survived better in management ecosystems of India and Africa than in Mexico-Central America. Local analysis in selected countries indicated that, as a general rule, the intensity of agricultural practices is negatively correlated with the amount of native species and the total abundance and biomass of earthworms; the only exception was found in the conversion of savannas to pastures, in Colombian llanos.

40|$|The {{negative}} of each {{spectral band}} of some satellite images {{was found with}} a general purpose computer, assigning to each pixel value its corresponding complement value. The new negative bands {{were added to the}} original ones and the resulting compound image was classified using an interactive processing system. For this study four Landsat images of some Mexican states were used. The resulting classifications were evaluated and found to be better than those using only the original bands. In the preclassification stage an algorithm was used to find the optimum divergence channel set and some of the negative bands were chosen by the computer. The classification accuracy was higher on the compound images, specially on those classes that are very similar. In order to define training fields needed for the classification, triplets of bands were displayed on a screen using three colors. Photointerpreters found that the use of negative bands affords the user an opportunity to distinguish control points as different classes in an easier manner. This method simplifies the selection as also the localization of the training fields. Some interesting results were found: <b>i)</b> <b>Crops</b> and woods are usually shown in a same color and sometimes {{it is very difficult to}} distinguish them. Displaying the corresponding negative bands, they do not appear in different intensity but in different colors. ii) Water quality is sometimes difficult to be noticed because of its slightly different dark tones. Using the negative bands the difference between light tones, and therefore the different water qualities, were easily detected. iii) On some zones where cities are located, the streets are easily identified on the negative displayed image. A high-road was only seen on the negative displayed image. The results of this study show that the use of both positive and negative bands allow the photointerpreters to extract more information of an image than using the conventional bands...|$|E
40|$|Summary-In {{field trials}} {{conducted}} at four sites in Hawaii, soybean (Glycine max) and bush bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) were either inoculated with homologous rhizobia, fertilized at high rates with urea, or left unamended. Crop phenology was assessed every few days. Rates of biomass and N accumulation and components of yield were measured five times during each crop cycle {{to assess the}} extent to which: (<b>i)</b> <b>crops</b> relying on soil, symbiotic, or fertilizer N differed in their growth characteristics; (ii) mode of N nutrition affected the timing of developmental stages; and (iii) effects of N nutrition on crop growth and development were related to final yield. While all measured variables differed significantly between sites, the effect of changing N source on these variables, in N limited environments, was consistent across sites. Rate and extent of node production, crop growth and yield were increased in symbiotic and N-fertilized crops as compared to unamended, non-fixing crops, while reproductive development was protracted. Extended time required to reach reproductive maturity was attributable {{to an increase in}} seed fill duration as time to flowering was not affected. Development and yield of N 2 -fixing crops were similar but not equivalent to those of N-fertilized crops. To produce reliable yield estimates, legume growth simulation models must be able to accurately simulate crop growth and phenology. The present data indicate that information relating to source and supply of N must be incorporated before such models can be used to generate reliable yield estimations. Results of these trials also provide a valuable dataset for calibrating model subroutines for inorganic nitrogen uptake and nitrogen fixation in soybean and bush bean growth under field conditions and adjusting model coefficients for tropical environments...|$|E

40|$|Moving to more agroecological {{cropping}} systems implies deep {{changes in the}} organization of {{cropping systems}}. We propose a method for formalizing the process of innovating cropping system prototype design using a tool called PRACT (Prototyping Rotation and Association with Cover crop and no Till) applied to a Malagasy case study. The input information for PRACT is comprised of: (<b>i)</b> <b>crop</b> and cover crop adaptation to biophysical conditions, (ii) agroecological functions of the cover crops, (iii) crop production, (iv) association possibilities between crop and cover crop, and (v) agroecological functions of the cropping system. All the information was derived from expert knowledge developed over more than 12 years of agronomic experiments in Madagascar. The final output from PRACT is a list of <b>cropping</b> systems, <b>i.</b> e., <b>crop</b> and cover crop associations and their sequences over three years. These cropping systems are characterized by their potential agroecological functions and crop production. The PRACT model selects a list of cropping systems taking into account the above information by using elaborate rules governing the intercropping and sequences between crops and cover crops. Examples of the outcomes of model simulations are provided for four different kinds of field. Taking into account the range of potential crops and cover crops, the number of cropping systems that was theoretically possible for the different field types ranged from 19, 683 to 2. 98 × 1013. In a first step, PRACT reduced this number by a factor of up to 28 times to propose possible cropping systems. To do so, cropping systems are selected in terms of the biophysical requirements of plants, plant compatibility and agronomic rules. Not all of these systems are suitable for every farmer. Thus using PRACT output, a second cropping system selection step can be taken based on these <b>cropping</b> system characteristics, <b>i.</b> e., <b>crop</b> production and agroecological functions. By doing so the number of cropping systems selected can reach a reasonable value that can be handled by technicians and farmers. Possible uses and further development of the tool are discussed.

Farmer management of such variability remains a challenge and sustainable option for soil productivity are required.

There were positive effects of animal manure and catch crops on yield. However, except for the coarse sandy soil, the yield effects of catch crops and animal manure decreased over time when a grass-clover green manure {{was included in the}} rotation.

40|$|ABSTRACT Many pre-dispersal seed predators are {{specialized}} {{insects that}} rely on seeds for larval development. These insects may respond {{to the amount of}} seeds produced by a plant (<b>i.</b> e. <b>crop</b> size), increasing the proportion of seeds damaged with increases in seed numbers. Large seeds have more resources and spend more time in plants to complete their development and are probably more prone to be preyed on by those insects than small seeds. Here <b>I</b> tested how <b>crop</b> size and seed mass influence pre-dispersal seed predation in plants from the Cerrado savannas of Brazil. <b>I</b> related plant <b>crop</b> size to pre-dispersal seed predation for Xylopia aromatica and Erythroxylum pelleterianum. A literature review was performed to test if seed mass may explain among-species differences in pre-dispersal seed predation. Pre-dispersal losses increased proportionally to crop size in the two species investigated, but some species show positive or no density-dependent seed predation in literature, indicating that seed losses are not a simple function of crop sizes. Seed mass did not explain pre-dispersal seed loss differences among 14 species with data available. Pre-dispersal losses are often small and probably less important than seed dispersal and establishment limitation for plant recruitment in Cerrado savannas...|$|R
