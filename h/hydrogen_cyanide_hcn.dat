5|$|The LIRGs that host {{hydroxyl}} megamasers may {{be distinguished}} {{from the general population}} of LIRGs by their molecular gas content. The majority of molecular gas is molecular hydrogen, and typical hydroxyl megamaser hosts have molecular gas densities greater than 1000cm−3. These densities are among the highest mean densities of molecular gas among LIRGs. The LIRGs that host hydroxyl megamasers also have high fractions of dense gas relative to typical LIRGs. The dense gas fraction is measured by the ratio of the luminosity produced by <b>hydrogen</b> <b>cyanide</b> (<b>HCN)</b> relative to the luminosity of carbon monoxide (CO).|$|E

50|$|Organic {{cyanides}} {{are usually}} called nitriles; in these, the CN group is linked by a covalent bond to a carbon-containing group, such as methyl (CH3) in methyl cyanide (acetonitrile).

Hydrocyanic acid, also known as <b>hydrogen</b> <b>cyanide,</b> or <b>HCN,</b> is a highly volatile liquid used to prepare acrylonitrile, which is used in the production of acrylic fibers, synthetic rubber, and plastics. Cyanides are employed in a number of chemical processes, including fumigation, case hardening of iron and steel, electroplating, and the concentration of ores.

40|$|<b>Hydrogen</b> <b>cyanide</b> is the {{starting}} material for a diverse array of prebiotic syntheses, including those of amino acids and purines. <b>Hydrogen</b> <b>cyanide</b> also reacts with ferrous ions to give ferrocyanide, {{and so it is}} possible that ferrocyanide was common in the early ocean.

We show experimentally that the rate of formation of ferrocyanide is rapid even at low concentrations of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>cyanide</b> in the pH range 6 - 8, and therefore an equilibrium calculation is valid. The equilibrium concentrations of ferrocyanide are calculated as a function of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>cyanide</b> concentration, pH and temperature.
