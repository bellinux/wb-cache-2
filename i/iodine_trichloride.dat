500|$|Iodine trifluoride (IF3) is an {{unstable}} yellow solid that decomposes above −28°C. It is thus little-known. It {{is difficult to}} produce because fluorine gas would tend to oxidise iodine {{all the way to}} the pentafluoride; reaction at low temperature with xenon difluoride is necessary. <b>Iodine</b> <b>trichloride,</b> which exists in the solid state as the planar dimer I2Cl6, is a bright yellow solid, synthesised by reacting iodine with liquid chlorine at −80°C; caution is necessary during purification because it easily dissociates to iodine monochloride and chlorine and hence can act as a strong chlorinating agent. Liquid <b>iodine</b> <b>trichloride</b> conducts electricity, possibly indicating dissociation to [...] and [...] ions.|$|E

50|$|ClF3 is {{the most}} {{reactive}} of the XY3 interhalogens. ICl3 is the least reactive. BrF3 has the highest thermal stability of the interhalogens with four atoms. ICl3 has the lowest. Chlorine trifluoride has a boiling point of −12 °C. Bromine trifluoride has a boiling point of 127 °C and is a liquid at room temperature. <b>Iodine</b> <b>trichloride</b> melts at 101 °C.|$|E
50|$|<b>Iodine</b> <b>trichloride</b> (ICl3) forms lemon yellow {{crystals}} that melt {{under pressure}} to a brown liquid. It {{can be made from}} the elements at low temperature, or from iodine pentoxide and hydrogen chloride. It reacts with many metal chlorides to form tetrachloroiodides, and hydrolyses in water. The molecule is a planar dimer (ICl3)2, with each iodine atom surrounded by four chlorine atoms.|$|E
5000|$|Atomidine {{is made in}} {{different}} ways by different manufacturers, each with different interpretations of the Edgar Cayce readings {{in which it was}} first recommended. The name Atomidine is a registered trademark of The Heritage Store. Their formula contains iodine in the form of <b>iodine</b> <b>trichloride</b> and is manufactured from elemental iodine and pure chlorine gas. Therefore, there is no potassium in it.|$|E
5000|$|Iodic acid is a {{relatively}} strong acid with a pKa of 0.75. It is strongly oxidizing in acidic solution, less so in basic solution. When iodic acid acts as oxidizer, then {{the product of the}} reaction is either iodine, or iodide ion. Under some special conditions (very low pH and high concentration of chloride ion, e.g. in concentrated hydrochloric acid), iodic acid is reduced to <b>iodine</b> <b>trichloride,</b> a golden yellow compound in solution and no further reduction occurs. In the absence of chloride ions, when there is an excess amount of reductant, then all iodate is converted to iodide ion. When there is an excess amount of iodate, then part of the iodate is converted to iodine.It may be used in preparation of ionization to form alkyl halide ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractHuman skin {{obtained}} shortly {{post mortem}} was hydrolyzed and extracted with iso-octane. The lipid fraction was chromatographed on thin-layer to separate various sterols. The 7 -dehydrocholesterol area was isolated {{and found to}} have ultraviolet and infrared spectra identical with authentic 7 -dehydrocholesterol. The vitamin D area was isolated and shown to have thin-layer and gas chromatographic properties similar to authentic vitamin D 3. Further, the <b>iodine</b> <b>trichloride</b> and trimethylsilyl derivatives of isolated vitamin D 3 had chromatographic properties indistinguishable from the derivatives formed from the authentic compound. The pyro and isopyro products of authentic vitamin D 3 -trimethylsilylate yielded almost identical mass spectra. Radioisotope studies indicated an average 38 % recovery of tritiated vitamin D 3 through the isolation procedure prior to gas-liquid chromatography. Preliminary quantitation of vitamin D 3 in abdominal skin was approximately 3. 2 µg/gm of skin...|$|E
40|$|The {{conversion}} of toxin into toxoid {{has been studied}} by Ehrlich (1) and Ramon (2 - 4) for diphtheria toxin, by Behring and Ransom (5), Lowenstein (6), and yon Eisler and Lowenstein (7) for tetanus toxin, by Weinberg and Goy (8) for the toxins of the B. bo~ulinus and of the gas gangrene anaerobes (i. e., B. oedematiens, etc.). Ramon (9) has also converted abrin and cobra venom into toxoids. The change was observed to occur spontaneously (Ehrlich (1), Behring and Ransom (5)), and also could be induced artificially by means of various physical and chemical agents; namely, for tetanus toxin <b>iodine</b> <b>trichloride</b> (Behring and Ransom (5)), formalin (0. 1 to 0. 2 per cent) and exposure to a Nemst lamp (Lowenstein (6)), formalin (0. 1 to 0. 2 per cent) and slight heat (30 °C.) (yon Eisler and Lowenstein (7)); and for diphtheria toxin formalin (0. 3 to 0. 4 per cent) and heat (40 - 42 °C.) (Ramon (4)). By similar procedures (formalin and heat) abrin, cobra venom (Ramon (9),), and toxins of the B. botulinus and the gas gangrene anaerobes (Weinberg and Goy (8)) have also been converted into toxoid states. These studies elaborated {{the concept of a}} toxoid first announced by Ehrlich. In its completed form, the definition of a toxoid {{is that it is a}} toxin so altered that the toxicity is decreased whereas the antibodycombining capacity and the antigenicity are essentially undiminished. It has been observed (Lowenstein (6), Ramon (4)) that the antigenicity of tetanus and diphtheria toxoids varies with the potency of the mother filtrates. It can be estimated by the antitoxin-combining capacity, to which it is directly proportional. By means of the phenomenon of local skin reactivity to bacterial filtrates, Shwartzman (10 - 13) has demonstrated the existence of a ne...|$|E
