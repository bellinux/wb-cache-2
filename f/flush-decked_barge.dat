50|$|Ouvrages du Libron (Works of Libron) is a {{structure}} {{like no other}} on the Canal du Midi. It allows the Libron River, near Agde in south-west France, to traverse the Canal du Midi. At the point of intersection, the Libron {{is more or less}} at the same level as the Canal du Midi so a traditional aqueduct was not an option. The problem was further exacerbated by the Libron's propensity to flash flood up to twenty times a year. The problem was originally solved by the building of a pontoon aqueduct known as the Libron Raft which utilised a <b>flush-decked</b> <b>barge</b> to protect the canal channel in times of flooding however this was replaced by the present structure in 1855.|$|E
