They blame, with some justification, the {{problems}} in the financial sector for getting us <b>into</b> <b>this</b> <b>mess,</b> and they’re dissatisfied with the policy response here in Washington. And at some level, I can’t blame them. Certainly, 9 percent unemployment and very slow growth is not a good situation." [...] On November 2, he again expressed sympathy with frustrations about the economy but also said many of the complaints levied at the Fed, including those made against the steps it took during the financial crisis, are misguided. “The concerns about the Fed are based on misconceptions,” he said. “A very simplistic interpretation of that [...] was that we were doing that because we wanted to preserve banker salaries. That was obviously not the case.” Dallas Federal Reserve President Richard W. Fisher said that he was [...] "somewhat sympathetic" [...] to the views of the protesters, and added, [...] "We have too many people out of work. We have a very uneven distribution of income. We have a very frustrated people, and I can understand their frustration." ...|$|E
2500|$|In October 2011, Silas tells Lynsey {{that he is}} {{planning}} to murder again and that she has until midnight on Halloween to identify his next victim. He promises Lynsey that if she works out who his next victim is he will confess his crimes to the police, but if she fails another girl will die. Lynsey has {{to go along with}} Silas's mind game after everyone still refuses to believe her claims about him. Hassan explained that Silas does not care if he gets caught or perishes in the process. He reminds Lynsey of his plan by sending her clues and presents, such as a chess queen and a pumpkin containing the message [...] "Tick tock, time is running out". Lynsey confides in Doug and tells him what Silas is doing. Silas picks out four potential victims: Lynsey, Texas, Theresa and Amy Barnes (Ashley Slanina-Davies). He then marks each one of them with chess pieces which are planted in their homes or bags. Silas sends Lynsey a Catwoman outfit with an instruction to wear it at the fancy dress Halloween party at Chez Chez nightclub. Lynsey confides in Doug and tells him what Silas {{is planning}} and Brennan said he was [...] "very, very happy" [...] {{to be involved in the}} storyline again. Doug believes Lynsey, of which Hassan said [...] "On one hand, she feels like she shouldn't be dragging [...] <b>into</b> <b>this</b> <b>mess,</b> but she knows that she needs someone on her side". The actress added that Lynsey cannot believe her luck as Doug show her kindness and friendship and she wonders why she did not confide in him months ago. Rawle revealed that nobody in the village is safe, saying [...] "Theresa's already in his sights, Lynsey is a possible and so is Mercedes - he really doesn't like the McQueens!" [...] He added that there are [...] "lots of other women" [...] whose morals Silas would find questionable.|$|E

40|$|Japan's deteriorating fiscal {{situation}} has attracted international attention. I assess what current Japanese government policies {{mean for the}} future of public debt and the economy in general, given the inevitable aging of the population. I review how Japan got <b>into</b> <b>this</b> current fiscal <b>mess,</b> and then perform an analysis of some debt dynamics. With unchanged fiscal policies, Japan's public debt will rise to between 260 % and 380 % of GDP in 2030, and to between 700 % and 1300 % in 2040 [...] clearly unsustainable levels. For the debt to be sustainable, significant increases in taxes, or cuts in government spending are necessary. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to reflect the {{behavioral}} biases that led to this global financial crisis. The paper presents briefly the real causes of the crisis (structural and cyclical factors) and puts a greater accent on the behavioral factors. The authors considered to structure the paper in three main pillars: behavioral factors, the collapse of ethical behavior and the role of behavioral finance in studying, regulating and assessment financial risks. The first pillar consists in a brief presentation of the behavioral factors such as: optimism and wishful thinking, overconfidence, greed, regret, pessimism, passing the responsibility, herding - groupthink, anchoring, representativeness biases, informational cascades and "this time is different" syndrome. The second pillar of the paper presents the collapse of ethical behavior that led to the global financial crisis: predatory lending practices, inappropriate compensation schemes, rating agencies behavior, corporate governance reforms and financial institutions opacity in their reporting. The third pillar presents the mismanagement of risk and regulations that led us <b>into</b> <b>this</b> global <b>mess.</b> The paper concludes with the need of integrating biases of human behavior into regulations in order to make them more effective and people become less financially vulnerable. behavioral finance, irrationality, regulation, crisis...|$|R
