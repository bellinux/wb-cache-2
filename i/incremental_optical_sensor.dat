40|$|<b>Optical</b> <b>sensors</b> find wide {{application}} {{in the industrial}} automation systems for solving the tasks connected with detection of objects. The advantages of <b>optical</b> <b>sensors</b> are their low cost and ease of implementation. The disadvantages of <b>optical</b> <b>sensors</b> are their strong dependence {{on the level of}} external lighting and thermal instability. This paper proposes a concept for implementing an <b>optical</b> <b>sensor</b> with the use of modulated infrared radiation.

30|$|This facial {{wearable}} robot supports eyelid {{movement on}} the paralyzed side based on {{movement on the}} healthy side. As blinking is typically symmetric, we consider that the healthy eyelid movement may serve as an appropriate trigger for eyelid movement support on the paralyzed side. Thus, we decided to detect eyelid movement on the healthy side as a trigger for this motion support on the paralyzed side. There {{are many ways to}} detect eyelid closure [14 – 17]. Among them, we focused on eye wink detection with a reflective <b>optical</b> <b>sensor</b> [18]. An eye wink is a voluntary and strong eye closure motion. It generates a large skin displacement at the tail of the eye. A reflective <b>optical</b> <b>sensor</b> can measure this skin displacement. Compared to other detection methods, using a reflective <b>optical</b> <b>sensor</b> is contactless and easy to use. The wearable facial robot can also support eyelid movement based on the wearer’s intention because a wink motion detected by the <b>optical</b> <b>sensor</b> is a voluntary motion.|$|R
50|$|FunctionAn <b>optical</b> <b>sensor</b> {{converts}} {{light rays}} into electronic signals. It measures the physical {{quantity of light}} and then translates it into a form that is readable by an instrument. An <b>optical</b> <b>sensor</b> is generally {{part of a larger}} system that integrates a source of light, a measuring device and the <b>optical</b> <b>sensor.</b> This is often connected to an electrical trigger. The trigger reacts to a change in the signal within the light <b>sensor.</b> An <b>optical</b> <b>sensor</b> can measure the changes from one or several light beams. When a change occurs, the light sensor operates as a photoelectric trigger and therefore either increases or decreases the electrical output.An optical switch enables signals in optical fibres or integrated optical circuits to be switched selectively from one circuit to another. An optical switch can operate by mechanical means or by electro-optic effects, magneto-optic effects as well as by other methods. Optical switches are optoelectronic devices which can be integrated with integrated or discrete microelectronic circuits.|$|R
