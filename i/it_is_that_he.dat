500|$|Squires {{returning}} from the King's bath tell Gurnemanz that the balsam has eased the King's suffering. Gurnemanz's own squires ask how <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> knew Klingsor. He solemnly tells them how both the Holy Spear, which pierced {{the side of the}} Redeemer on the Cross, and the Holy Grail, which caught the flowing blood, had come to Monsalvat to be guarded by the Knights of the Grail under the rule of Titurel, father of Amfortas. Klingsor had yearned to join the Knights but, unable to keep impure thoughts from his mind, resorted to self-castration, causing him to be expelled from the Order. Klingsor then set himself up in opposition to the realm of the Grail, learning dark arts, claiming the valley domain below and filling it with beautiful Flowermaidens to seduce and enthrall wayward Grail Knights. It was here that Amfortas lost the Holy Spear, kept by Klingsor as he schemes to get hold of the Grail as well. Gurnemanz tells how Amfortas later had a holy vision which told him to wait for a [...] "pure fool, enlightened by compassion" [...] ("") who will finally heal the wound.|$|E
500|$|Todd Gilchrist feels Sparrow is {{the only}} element of the films that will remain timeless. According to Sharon Eberson, the character's {{popularity}} {{can be attributed to}} his being a [...] "scoundrel whose occasional bouts of conscience allow viewers to go with the flaws because, as played to the larger-than-life hilt by Depp, he owns every scene he is in". Film history professor Jonathan Kuntz attributed Sparrow's popularity to the increased questioning of masculinity in the 21st century, and Sparrow's personality contrasts with action-adventure heroes in cinema. Leonard Maltin concurs that Sparrow has a carefree attitude and does not take himself seriously. Mark Fox noted Sparrow is an escapist fantasy figure for women, free from much of the responsibility of most heroes. Sparrow is listed by IGN as one of their ten favorite film outlaws, as he [...] "lives for himself and the freedom to do whatever <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> damn well pleases. Precious few film characters have epitomized what makes the outlaw such a romantic figure for audiences as Captain Jack Sparrow has." [...] Entertainment Weekly put it on its end-of-the-decade, [...] "best-of" [...] list, saying, [...] "Part Keith Richards rift, part sozzled lounge lizard, Johnny Depp's swizzleshtick pirate was definitely one of the most dazzling characters of the decade." [...] In June 2010, Sparrow was named one of Entertainment Weekly 100 Greatest Characters of the Last 20 Years.|$|E

60|$|Accordingly, I have herein {{told you}} with great particularity all these {{circumstances}} of his early history so that you may know exactly how <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> taken away into the lake, and why <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> afterward known as Sir Launcelot, surnamed of the Lake.|$|R
60|$|And then <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{raised his}} eyes {{to those of the}} president.|$|R

2500|$|Billy Aronson said, [...] "For the record, {{although}} I was {{ambivalent about}} Jonathan’s ideas for Rent {{when we were}} working together on it, I have come to love the show. And as tragic as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> didn’t live to see his work become a huge success, I believe {{he knew it would}} be. In our last conversation I asked how the show was going and he said, with complete assurance, that it was incredible." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cobbett, Hazlitt observes, is so {{powerful}} a verbal combatant that one would think him unopposable, that [...] "not only no individual, but no corrupt system could hold out against his powerful and repeated attacks." [...] If he does not in practice succeed {{as well as one}} would expect, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> undermines his position by a number of self-defeating faults. These include a maddening inconsistency, as well as an unwillingess to compromise or collaborate with others. In fact, he antagonizes his would-be supporters along with his opponents: [...] "with the same weapon" [...] he uses against his enemies, he also [...] "lays his friends low, and puts his own party hors de combat." ...|$|E
2500|$|If {{there is}} a single {{criticism}} to be made of Gardner ... <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> accepts too comfortably the conventional wisdom, or accepted social reality, of current twentieth-century science and middle-class American Christianity. Somehow it is evident (to me at least) that he is implicitly making a pact with the reader to evaluate these fringe groups in terms of their own shared presumptions about what is [...] "normal". Thus he is quite confident throwing around labels like [...] "quack", [...] "crank" [...] and [...] "preposterous". In science the use of such value judgments can be quite time-bound; likewise in religions where today's heresy may become tomorrow's orthodoxy. The odds of course are always {{on the side of the}} writer criticizing fringe groups because statistically speaking so few of them survive. However, when a group does weather its infancy and go on to prosper, invariably its original detractors look a bit more arbitrary than they did initially, and then the shoe is on the other foot.|$|E
