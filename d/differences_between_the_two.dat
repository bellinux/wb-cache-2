5|$|A second {{species of}} Voalavo, eastern voalavo, was named in 2005 from central Madagascar.

In mammals, closely related species regularly differ by less than 5% in their cytochrome b sequences, and a divergence of more than 5% within a single species suggests the presence of cryptic species.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the {{academic}} achievement and social adjustment of mentally retarded students who have had five years of special education with mentally retarded students who have had no special education. This comparison was made to determine if there is a significant <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> groups. <b>The</b> present study was not undertaken to defend or attack special education classes. The study was designed to determine to what extent academic and social <b>differences</b> existed <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> groups. It is hoped the results of this study can be used in planning programs for the educable mentally retarded children in the Weber County Schools. The writer proposes the following hypotheses: 1. There will be no significant <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> groups in reading. 2. There will be no significant <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> groups in arithmetic. 3.

5|$|Another {{unidentified}} parrot specimen, {{this one}} brown and housed in Cabinet du Roi, {{was described by}} the French naturalist Comte de Buffon in 1779 under his entry for the Mascarene parrot, in which he pointed out similarities and <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two.</b> The English palaeontologist Julian Hume has suggested the possibility that {{this might have been}} a lesser vasa parrot, if not a discoloured old Mascarene grey parakeet (Psittacula bensoni).

English zoologist and author George Robert Gray assigned some eclectus parrot (Eclectus roratus) subspecies from the Moluccas to Mascarinus in his book A List of the Genera of Birds from the 1840s, but this idea was soon dismissed by other writers.|$|E
5|$|Aside from Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps, master gunnery {{sergeant}} (MGySgt) and {{sergeant major}} {{are the highest}} enlisted ranks in the Marine Corps; however, there are far fewer master gunnery sergeants than sergeants major. One of the major <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> E-9 ranks is that master gunnery sergeants retain their Military Occupational Specialty (MOS), while sergeants major are given a new MOS to reflect their general command focus. This reinforces the master gunnery sergeant's role as a provider of technical military leadership.|$|E
5|$|Brachiopods are shelled {{marine organisms}} that superficially resembled {{bivalves}} {{in that they}} are of similar size and have a hinged shell in two parts. However, brachiopods evolved from a very different ancestral line, and the resemblance to bivalves only arose because of a similar lifestyle. The <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> groups are due to their separate ancestral origins. Different initial structures have been adapted to solve the same problems, a case of convergent evolution. In modern times, brachiopods are not as common as bivalves.|$|E

5|$|However, the {{presence}} of a post-Constantinian editor, as originally postulated by Theodore Mommsen, still has notable support, most recently articulated by Daniel Den Hengst, who suggests that the editor was the author of {{the second half of the}} History, operating under the pseudonyms of Pollio and Vopiscus. Further, that this editor not only wrote the secondary lives in the first half, but he was also responsible for the insertions into the primary lives in that series.

5|$|In a 1980 article, Argentine {{zoologist}} Elio Massoia {{recognized the}} resemblance between Winge's Hesperomys molitor and Hershkovitz's Holochilus magnus, and {{recommended that the}} former be reclassified as a species of Holochilus, Holochilus molitor. When American zoologists Voss and Carleton restudied Winge's material in a 1993 paper, {{they were unable to}} find any consistent <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> and accordingly considered them to pertain to the same species. In addition, they reviewed the differences between this species and other Holochilus and concluded that these were significant enough to place the former in a distinct genus, which they named Lundomys after Lund, who had collected the original material. Since then, the species has been known as Lundomys molitor.|$|E
