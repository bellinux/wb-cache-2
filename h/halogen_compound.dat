40|$|Methyl iodide (CH 3 I) is a {{volatile}} organic <b>halogen</b> <b>compound</b> that contributes {{significantly to the}} transport of iodine from the ocean to the atmosphere, where it {{plays an important role}} in tropospheric chemistry. CH 3 I is naturally produced and occurs in the global ocean. The processes involved in the formation of CH 3 I, however, are not fully understood. In fact, there is an ongoing debate whether production by phytoplankton or photochemical degradation of organic matter is the main source term. Here, both the biological and photochemical production mechanisms are considered in a biogeochemical module that is coupled to a one-dimensional water column model for the eastern tropical Atlantic. The model is able to reproduce observed subsurface maxima of CH 3 I concentrations. But, the dominating source process cannot be clearly identified as subsurface maxima can occur due to both direct biological and photochemical production. However, good agreement between the observed and simulated difference between surface and subsurface methyl iodide concentrations is achieved only when direct biological production is taken into account. Production rates for the biological CH 3 I source that were derived from published laboratory studies are shown to be inappropriate for explaining CH 3 I concentrations in the eastern tropical Atlantic...|$|E

Knowledge of an efficient disinfection for both hands and food contact surfaces is helpful for the food sector and provides precious information for public health. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of seven disinfectants belonging to different groups of biocides (alcohol, halogen, oxidizing agents, quaternary ammonium compounds, aldehyde and biguanide) on infectious viral titre and on genomic copy number. Due to the absence of a cell culture system for HuNoV, two HuNoV surrogates such as murine norovirus (MNV) and feline calicivirus (FCV), were used and the tests were performed in suspension, on gloves and on stainless steel discs. When, as criteria of efficacy, a log reduction > 3 of the infectious viral titre on both surrogates and in the three tests is used, the most efficacious disinfectants in this study appear to be biocidal products B, C and D, representing the halogens, the oxidizing agents group and a mix of QAC, alcohol and aldehyde, respectively.

Molecular protocols were then used for the comparative evaluation of disinfectant efficacies against NV and FCV, which were tested by reproducing NV field conditions, using human fecal material as a protein load. Generally, disinfectant efficacy was strongly reduced by the organic impurities (feces) used during tests. All disinfectants, except the aldehyde, were effective on FCV, as measured by cell culture and reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), with inactivation levels of ≥ 99. 9 %. The glutaraldehyde-based compound failed to adequately inactivate FCV according to RT-PCR results, although the infectivity in cell culture was completely abolished. Similar inactivation levels were achieved with NV, but generally NV appeared more resistant than FCV, and consequently, the suitability of FCV {{as a model for}} NV should be considered with caution.

Agricultural residues have the potentials to be used as energy and chemical source and meet its deficit in the country. This paper focuses on utilization of lignocellulosic materials obtained from two agricultural residues through renewable technology to produce bio-energy and chemical feedstock. The lignocellulosic materials were extracted from palm fruit (Elaeis guineensis) fibre and physic nut (Jatropha curcas) shell, and pyrolyzed under low temperature and pressure at various particle sizes. The main properties of solid (lignocellulosic) materials were tested and the bio-oil produced was analyzed using GC-MS. Results show proximate analyses (volatile, ash and fixed carbon contents) and ultimate analysis (carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, magnesium, phosphorus and zinc). The pH value of the bio-oil from both residues increased with increase in temperatures. The density, viscosity and calorific value of the palm and physic residue oil are 831. 99 and 947. 5 kg/m 3, 0. 695 and 1. 58 cPa at room temperature, 22. 33 and 14. 169 kJ/g, respectively.

40|$|Production {{pathways}} of {{the prominent}} volatile organic <b>halogen</b> <b>compound</b> methyl iodide (CH 3 I) {{are not fully}} understood. Based on observations, production of CH 3 I via photochemical degradation of organic material or via phytoplankton production has been proposed. Additional insights could not be gained from correlations between observed biological and environmental variables or from biogeochemical modeling to identify unambiguously the source of methyl iodide. In this study, we aim {{to address this question}} of source mechanisms with a three-dimensional global ocean general circulation model including biogeochemistry (MPIOM–HAMOCC (MPIOM – Max Planck Institute Ocean Model HAMOCC – HAMburg Ocean Carbon Cycle model)) by carrying out a series of sensitivity experiments. The simulated fields are compared with a newly available global data set. Simulated distribution patterns and emissions of CH 3 I differ largely for the two different production pathways. The evaluation of our model results with observations shows that, on the global scale, observed surface concentrations of CH 3 I can be best explained by the photochemical production pathway. Our results further emphasize that correlations between CH 3 I and abiotic or biotic factors do not necessarily provide meaningful insights concerning the source of origin. Overall, we find a net global annual CH 3 I air–sea flux that ranges between 70 and 260 Gg yr − 1. On the global scale, the ocean acts as a net source of methyl iodide for the atmosphere, though in some regions in boreal winter, fluxes are of the opposite direction (from the atmosphere to the ocean) ...|$|E

40|$|The {{extension}} of benzyne chemistry to non ortho-dehydroarenes is discussed. The generation and {{reactions of the}} "meta"-dehydroarene, 1, 8 -dehydronaphthalene, are described and attempts made to correlate its properties with the possible electronic structures of dehydroaromatic intermediates. 1, 8 -Dehydronaphthalene was generated by oxidation of l-aminonaphtho[l, 8 -de]triazine and was {{shown to be a}} highly reactive species, readily undergoing radical abstraction reactions and 1, 2 -addition to a variety of unsaturated systems such as olefins, acetylenes, aromatic hydrocarbons and azo compounds. The stereospecificity of 1, 2 -addition to olefins was carefully investigated in an attempt to determine the singlet-triplet nature of 1, 8 -dehydronaphthalene. l-Aminonaphtho[l, 8 -de]triazine was prepared by direct amination of naphtho[l, 8 -de]triazine with hydroxylamine-o-sulphonic acid which also gave 8 -azido-l-naphthylamine rather than the expected 2 -aminonaphtho[l, 8 -de]triazine. However amination of the naphthotriazine with chloramine gave both 1 - and 2 -aminonaphthotriazines, and the 2 -amino isomer was shown to rearrange readily to 8 -azido-l-naphthylamine under the alkaline conditions of the hydroxylamine-o-sulphonic acid amination, although it was stable to acid. In contrast 1 -aminonaphthotriazine was stable to alkali but underwent an interesting acid catalyzed rearrangement to the same azide. Other possible, but unsuccessful, routes to 1, 8 -dehydronaphthalene were briefly investigated. Since 1, 8 -dehydronaphthalene was very different from benzyne generated similarly, 1, 2 -and 2, 3 -naphthyne were prepared by oxidation of the appropriate aminonaphthotriazole, to provide a more direct comparison. These two naphthynes closely resembled benzyne and were again significantly different from 1, 8 -dehydro-naphthalene. Their dimerisation in the absence of aryne "traps," and their crossed coupling {{with each other and with}} benzyne proved an attractive route to the dibenzo- and monobenzo-biphenylenes. The new heterocyclic system, benz[cd]indazole, was of interest as a possible product in the oxidations of 1 - and 2 -aminonaphtho[l, 8 -de]triazines and as a possible precursor to 1, 8 -dehydronaphthalene. Various attempts to obtain this and its dihydro derivative failed; however dimethyl dihydrobenz[cd]- indazole- 1, 2 -dicarboxylate was formed by addition of 1, 8 -dehydronaphthalene to dimethyl azodicarboxylate. A novel oxazole synthesis is also described. Anomalies in the amination of benzotriazole with chloramine and hydroxylamine-o-sulphonic acid compared with similar amination of naphtho[l, 8 -de]triazine led to the isolation of 1 -chlorobenzotriazole, which proved to be a reactive positive <b>halogen</b> <b>compound</b> and a convenient new oxidant...|$|E
