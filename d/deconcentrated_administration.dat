50|$|Scholars of Southern European {{studies have}} {{described}} the Kallikratis reform as surprising, as it abolished {{a great number of}} prestigious and powerful political posts, which ahead of the looming crisis would have been regarded indespensable for keeping party clientelism alive. Bertrana and Heinelt described the Papandreou government's decision as using a singular window of opportunity to overcome long-standing resistance against reform. While in regard to the massive-scale top-down approach deviating from a Southern European strategy, compared to federal states such as Germany, interaction between national and subnational levels remains relatively weak with the subnational levels remaining strictly separated from the <b>deconcentrated</b> <b>administration</b> of the central government. Also, state supervision remains largely confined to a posteriori control of the legality of a subnational entity's activity.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{complements}} {{work on the}} re-scaling {{of resource}} governance by developing a theoretical understanding based on the distributional theory of institutional change, and by examining the case of water governance in Portugal. Different from the reactions of other European Member States to the Water Framework Directive, the central water authority and multi-sectoral <b>deconcentrated</b> <b>administrations</b> lost competencies in favour of new water administrations. The level of water governance shifted from administrative districts to hydrographic regions. Significant players in this process were the central state and the Minister of the Environment. Our explanation considers time preferences, mental models, credibility and transaction and transition costs of governance, which affected the timing {{and content of the}} reform, and the paper compares the situation to the rest of Europe. re-scaling, water governance, Portugal, institutional change,...|$|R

Though mobility planning can show success stories, mobility problems seem to aggravate. For supra local mobility projects in Flanders the executive power often lies with <b>deconcentrated</b> <b>administrations</b> {{at the level}} of the province, this is e. g. the case for public transportation and major roads, where province boundaries impede public transport projects across borders. For local mobility plans, the local administration and council have the power. But as these local mobility plans have highly formalised procedures, they tend to be rigid frameworks or administrations and risk to be suffering from lock-in. There is a need for new dynamics in mobility policy in reference to present developments. Here bottom-up or outside-in initiatives can be regarded as the key to real change. To that end radical changes in the organisation and mobility planning itself are necessary to meet these new inititiaves from the bottum-up and outside-in. Next to hardware and software approaches or innovations to turn mobility planning more sustainable, we additionally propose in this paper an ‘orgware’ solution, demonstrated in some case studies. In these cases key actors of bottom-up projects and their associations with other actors are visualised. Furthermore barriers and potentials for implementation are formulated leading onto recommendations for further research in order to improve the implementation of the policy objectives...|$|R
3000|$|In this section, {{we compare}} the deconcentrated {{provision}} of public goods by central government with the decentralized provision by R regional governments. <b>Deconcentrated</b> and decentralized <b>administrations</b> {{face the same}} problem, which means that {{a comparison of the}} centralized solution and decentralized solution is equivalent to comparing the central provision with the deconcentrated provision of public goods. This means that Propositions  2 – 4 still apply, substituting ϕ _Dj for ϕ _DCj and δ _Dj for δ _DCj(DC stands for decentralized) [...]...|$|R
40|$|Current second-tier {{organization}} in Croatia {{is based on}} twenty counties and the City of Zagreb with the county status. The counties are relatively small and have a rather low financial capacity and developmental role. In the period 1993 – 2001, counties were predominantly units responsible for <b>deconcentrated</b> state <b>administration,</b> with rather narrow autonomy. That is why county elections were of third order, after national and local elections. After 2001, counties were rearranged as autonomous units without any state administrative tasks and with a widened self-government scope. County elections became second-order, subordinated to national elections, which is demonstrated in this analysis. Relatively low government congruence score between county and national governments over time confirms that government parties lose votes in county elections and opposition parties gain votes. The turnout rate shows that voters cast ballots in county elections more rarely than in national elections. The counties political arena is still dominated by national parties and their organizational branches. County elections are highly ‘nationalized’ since they reflect national political institutions, processes, and patterns of political behaviour. At the moment, a new regional concept with only five historical regions is under serious professional and political debate. In the near future, the introduction of new, genuine regional {{organization in}}stead of present counties is likely. If those five new regions with broad autonomous scope of affairs are established, including regional development and strong regional policy, regional elections may become less subordinated to national elections and more oriented to specific interest of particular regions. The importance of regional elections depends mainly on {{the significance of the}} regional scope of public affairs and the financial capacity of regional units...|$|R
40|$|Hungary {{has been}} a {{centralized}} country throughout 1000 years of its history. 1990 {{was the first time}} Hungary had a chance to shape a decentralised system while making serious efforts to adjust it to the standards of the European Union and its "cohesion policy': The parallel institutional structures and the jungle of competing geographical and administrative (regional, county and micro-regional) units did not allow the strengthening of the meso-level as a whole. By the end of 2006, the government prescribed regional reorganisation of the <b>deconcentrated</b> public <b>administration</b> organs in the counties. The merger of county organisations on a regional scale did not mean a real change in the functioning. The regions were artificial units, so the new boundaries and seats were rather in the focus of political debate. The regionalisation of regional policy was laden with contradictions. Although the NUTS 2 regions became the most influential units having professional development agencies with skilled staff, the entire institutional system of national development policy lost its positions, including the regional level. The new government passed a new constitution, {{as a symbol of the}} beginning of a new political era, claiming that the original (neoliberal and decentralised) model created 20 years ago was unsuc- cessful in coping with the problems and in providing a long term vision for the country. The government refrained from regionalisation stabilizing the old counties as the meso-level of governance. The NUTS 2 regions remained only statistical units without any tasks. Here ended 20 years of decentralisation. This shows that territorial reforms cannot and should not be exclusively handled as a part of the European adaptation process and made subordinate to the needs of regional policy. Adaptation to the European Union is not a stable basis for regionalization. The main problem is that Hungary was not able to decentralise its public power system because the driving forces of regionalisation were only external without domestic political commitment to decentralize power...|$|R
