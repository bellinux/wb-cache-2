40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine effect of additive supplementation to red clover silage on ad libitum intake of <b>fresh</b> <b>silage</b> and dry matter (DM), in vivo digestibility of DM, organic matter (OM), OM in DM (D-value), crude protein (CP) and nitrogen (N) balance. Red clover was harvested at 60 % bloom stage. It was ensiled into round bales without an additive (CD) and with an additive supplementation (CDA) in the amount of 2 L t- 1 fresh material. Statistically lower (P< 0. 001) DM content was recorded in CD (405 g kg- 1 fresh sample) in comparison with CDA (665 g ST kg- 1 fresh sample). Statistically higher CP content (P< 0. 001) was recorded in CD (127 g kg- 1 ST) in comparison with CDA (110 g SP kg- 1 ST). CD had lower pH (P< 0. 001) (4. 9) in comparison with CDA (5. 2). No differences were recorded in NH 3 between treatments. Ad libitum intake of <b>fresh</b> <b>silage</b> and silage DM was higher (P< 0. 001 and P< 0. 01, respectively) in CD in comparison with CDA. Digestibility of DM, OM, CP, D-value and N balance were not different between treatments. It was concluded that the positive effect of additive supplementation to red clover silage on chemical composition, ad libitum intake, digestibility and N balance was not recorded due to applied ensiling technology as additive can improve feeding value of roughage, but it is not a replacement for good management practices...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to relate in vivo data of rumen escape N (REN) of forages with REN estimated from models and with determinations of rumen undegradable N. For these determinations and models measurements from in situ and in vitro techniques were used. Eleven forages were investigated in vivo using sheep with cannula in the rumen, duodenum and ileum. These forages were <b>fresh,</b> <b>silage</b> and hay from lucerne and orchard grass, and <b>fresh,</b> <b>silage</b> and haylage from red clover, and silage and hay from perennial ryegrass. Digesta flows were measured with the double marker technique using 51 Cr-EDTA and 103 Ru-phenanthroline. To measure the duodenal flow of microbial nitrogen (N), 15 N was infused as well as purine derivatives were measured in urine excretion. In vivo REN, expressed as g N kg- 1 of N intake or as g N kg- 1 of duodenal flow of non-ammonia N (NAN), was calculated from duodenal flows of NAN and microbial N and with assumptions for the duodenal flow of endogenous N. REN was also estimated from the models estimating effective undegradable N, using measurements from the in situ nylon bag technique or using Cornell net carbohydrate and protein system with data from CPM (Cornell, Penn, Minor Institute) Dairy Beta program (CPM-REN). With the in situ technique REN was calculated from N residues of forages incubated in the rumen, with and without corrections for microbial contamination. These in situ measurements were applied in cows fed a standard diet and in sheep fed the same forage as incubated in the nylon bag. CPM-REN was calculated from five N fractions determined with in vitro techniques. Undegradable N of the 11 forages was measured as N residue after 72 h incubation in nylon bags in the rumen of cows (in situ residual N), after 24 h incubation with protease and as acid detergent insoluble N (ADIN). REN from different in situ measurements and in situ residual N had no relationships with in vivo data. CPM-REN and the in vitro technique using protease had also no relationship with in vivo data. ADIN had a moderate relationship with different in vivo REN determinations and these relations improved when fresh and conserved (silage, hay and haylage) forages were separated (R 2 = 0. 83 – 0. 87; coefficient of VARIATION = 0. 08 – 0. 16).

40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} aerobic {{exposure}} of grass silages on short-term feed intake and preference by goats was studied. Eight grass silages differing in dry matter (DM) (25 % and 33 %), chop length (short and long) and compaction pressure at ensiling (0. 1 MPa and 0. 2 MPa) {{were exposed to}} air for eight days. Chemical analyses were conducted in 2 -day (d) intervals (d 0, d 2, d 4, d 6 and d 8 after silo opening) for proximate constituents, fermentation products and other volatile compounds as well as determination of microbiological status (yeasts, moulds and aerobic mesophilic bacteria). Furthermore, d 0 - to d 8 -silages were stored anaerobically in vacuum-sealed plastic bags for use in preference trials. After aerobic exposure, eight preference trials with Saanen-type wethers (n= 5) were carried out, where each possible two-way combination of silages and a standard hay (n= 15) was offered for 3 h. Data were analyzed using the SAS procedure Multidimensional Scaling, analysis of variance and correlation analysis between silage characteristics and DM intake (DMI). All silages were aerobically stable during the examination time. In trials with 33 % DM-silages, DMI decreased at d 6 or d 8 (in each of two trials) of aerobic exposure. Silage that {{had been exposed to}} air for 8 d was avoided in each case with a reduction (mean±standard deviation) of 50 ± 6. 7 % in comparison to the <b>freshest</b> <b>silage.</b> Low-DM silages showed signs of malfermentation with higher concentrations of butyric acid and ammonia-nitrogen (NH 3 -N). Both DMI and the impact of aerobic exposure on DMI were lower. Mean decrease in DMI after 8 d of aerobic exposure was 20 % (± 11. 0 %). Products from protein and amino acid degradation (NH 3 -N, butyric acid) were negatively correlated to DMI (r=− 0. 55 and − 0. 59; P< 0. 001). It was concluded that in well-fermented silages, aerobic exposure for a length of time that is of practical relevance does {{have a negative impact on}} short-term DMI and preference by goats, even if silages are at an apparently low stage of deterioration. It is assumed that goats can detect subtle differences caused by aerobic exposure, sometimes even before an increase in temperature or changes in chemical composition occur. After a 1 -d exposure of each variant, goats were able to differ between forages and showed preference or avoidance for different silages, with a high correlation between initial and total DMI. Therefore, results showed the potential for 30 min measurements in short-term preference trials, as goats remember post-ingestive feedback from the adaptation period...|$|R

Thirty-eight Red-HF cows were assigned to two silage treatments and individually fed. Mixtures containing one of the maize silages, grass silage and soy bean meal (70 : 17 : 13 DM basis) were offered ad libitum. Additionally, each cow received 7. 5 kg d- 1 of concentrate. Intake, milk yield and milk composition were analysed from wk 1 until wk 15 of lactation. The treatment period was from wk 5 to wk 15 of lactation. Pre-treatment data (wk 1 to 4) were used as covariates. In addition, <b>fresh</b> <b>silage</b> samples were ruminally incubated to determine the rate and extent of starch and NDF degradation.

In order to study the potential of the cassava plant for use as animal feed, the present work evaluated the characteristics of the aerial part of cassava when submitted to the processes of ensiling and haymaking. Treatments consisted of: aerial part of the plant ensiled without wilting (PAS); aerial part ensiled after wilting (PAE), and aerial part made into hay (PAF). Chemical analyses were run in order to evaluate the traits that determine the nutritional value of silage and hay. Wilting increased dry matter concentration from 25 % to 27. 7 %, without changing the concentration of soluble carbohydrates (33. 3 and 35. 5 % in the PAS and PAE, respectively), as well as buffer capacity (204 mmol kg- 1 DM in PAS and 195 mmol kg- 1 DM in PAE). Neither pH (3. 57 in <b>fresh</b> <b>silage</b> and 3. 60 in PAE) nor the ADIN concentration (11. 32 % of total nitrogen in PAS and 9. 99 % of total nitrogen in PAE) differed between the silages, but ADIN concentration was higher in hay (15. 39 %). Wilting caused an increase in the concentration of ammonia (from 6. 5 % of total nitrogen in PAS to 13. 0 of total nitrogen in PAE). The levels of volatile fatty acids did not change with wilting.

Forages {{are low in}} fatty acids (FA) but these FA are rich in linolenic acid; it can thus be thought that forages are a valuable source of polyunsaturated FA for ruminants; however their ruminal {{metabolism and}} their digestibility are not well known. Aseries of 4 experiments was carried out on 4 forages (2 cocksfoots, red clover, perennial ryegrass) as <b>fresh</b> grass, <b>silage</b> and hay (or haylage) on cannulated sheep. Forage drying resulted in a decrease in FA content and {{in the proportion of}} linolenic acid. Hydrogenation was also reduced by drying, so that the amount of absorbable FA was only slightly modified. Ruminal metabolism produced a large variety of 18 -carbon trans monounsaturated isomers, of which transvaccenic acid was the main one, and very limited amounts of conjugated linoleic acids (CLA). This suggests the post-ruminal origin of meat and milk CLA, by desaturation of transvaccenic acid. Fatty acid digestibility was slightly higher for <b>fresh</b> grass and <b>silage</b> than for haylage and hay. An in vivo trial was carried out on cannulated steers receiving perennial ryegrass, white or red clover, and the mixtures of ryegrass and each of the clovers. Hydrogenation of linolenic acid was lower for red clover, alone or mixed with ryegrass. This effect of red clover could be due to its high content in polyphenol oxidase (PPO). This hypothesis has been studied in vitro, with a classical line rich in PPO, a line poor in PPO and the same line in which PPO was inactivated. Plant-induced lipolysis was reduced by high PPO content. These experiments improved the knowledge on FA digestion for forages. However, the specificities of red clover remain to be better known.

40|$|SUMMARY The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the characteristics of silages prepared with a dry bakery by-product hydrated with acid whey or water associated or not at urea. The trial was a 3 (hydration at three moisture levels: 250, 300, and 350 mL kg&# 8722; 1 of by-product) × 3 (three application rates of urea: 0, 5, and 10 g kg&# 8722; 1 of by-product) × 2 (liquid used at hydration: acid whey or water) factorial arrangement. Mini-silos were used as experimental silos and remained closed for 30 days. Overall, silages hydrated with acid whey had higher (P< 0. 01) production of lactic (19. 6 vs. 18. 5 g kg&# 8722; 1 of dry matter [DM]), acetic (2. 5 vs. 1. 8 g kg&# 8722; 1 of DM) and propionic acid (8. 0 vs. 5. 4 g kg&# 8722; 1 of DM), and lower (P< 0. 05) fungi counts (5. 35 and 5. 01 cfu g&# 8722; 1 of <b>fresh</b> <b>silage)</b> compared to silages hydrated with water. Increased hydration led to the higher production of total acids (P< 0. 01), decreasing silage pH; but increased hydration reduced DM recovery (P< 0. 01).

40|$|Purpose: The paper {{compares the}} effect of five {{different}} direct seeding methods to the conventional tillage on the emerging and yield of silage corn (Zea may L.) in two different pedo-ecological conditions of Slovenia. Design/methodology/approach: A randomly selected 4 x 6 block designed field test was carried out; gliphosat treatment 1 week before seeding (V 1), mowing+focus ultra on the whole plot 3 weeks later (V 2), mowing+focus ultra in bands 3 weeks later (V 3), mowing+focus ultra in bands 3 weeks later+mowing the inter-row after emergence (V 4), conventional tillage (V 5), focus ultra on the whole plot 3 weeks after seeding (V 6). Findings: The highest emergence was on parcels with treatment V 5; 98. 99 % in Noršinci and 82. 75 % in Pohorski dvor. The (V 1) treatment influenced lowest emergence in Noršinci (82. 48 %) and Pohorski dvor (63. 25 %). The number of emerged seedlings affected the highest yield of <b>fresh</b> <b>silage</b> on V 5 (50. 590 kg ha- 1 - Nošinci and 45. 661 kg ha- 1 - Pohorski dvor) and dry matter (20. 228 kg/ha).

The penetrometer measurements showed the highest soil resistance (119. 78 N cm- 2) in Noršinci on V 3 and (185. 31 N cm- 2) in Pohorski dvor on V 4. Research limitations/implications: The experiment presented herein can be applied under similar pedo-climatical condition.

Group A had the longest mean eating time per meal and the lowest number of eating bouts. Group B had the lowest mean eating time but intake was not {{different from that of}} Group A. Animals in Group B compensated for their shorter times spent at the feeder by increasing their rate of intake compared with those of Groups A and C. The Spearman rank feeding order correlations for time at the feeder, number of feeding bouts and intake were positive for all groups, indicating that some animals consistently ate the most often and had the greatest intake. Groups A and B both had high Spearman rank feeding order correlations for mean meal length, total time at the feeder and number of feeding bouts. These high correlations could indicate that subordinate animals were probably not disadvantaged by being fed in a group compared with animals fed individually.

40|$|This study {{aimed at}} using cassava leaves, ensiled with rice bran, sugar {{molasses}} and cassava root meal (at 5 and 10 % levels), as a protein source for growing pigs and pregnant Mong Cai sows. The added ingredients contributed to producing good quality silage (pH 3. 8 or less; HCN 90 - 120 mg/kg <b>fresh</b> <b>silage)</b> {{which could be}} stored {{for up to five}} months. Digestibility and nitrogen balance trials were conducted to evaluate the substitution of fish meal by ensiled cassava leaves (ECL) at the levels of 0, 50, 75 and 100 g/day of protein in diets based on ensiled cassava roots (ECR). There was an indication (P = 0. 08) that apparent digestibility of the dry matter (DM) decreased with increasing levels of ECL. The decrease in crude protein (CP) digestibility, from 86. 6 to 79. 6 for 100 g/day substitution, was highly significant (P = 0. 001). Nitrogen retention also decreased from 14. 5 to 9. 0 g/day when ECL was used at the level of 100 g/day of protein. The inclusion of 10 % ensiled cassava leaves as replacement for sweetpotato vines and partial replacement for fishmeal in growing Mong Cai gilt had no effect on reproductive performance. However, at the 20 % level, the live weight gain of gilts was decreased, age at first mating was increased from 170 to 196 days, and live weight increased from 40. 2 to 43. 8 kg. Twenty-four crossbred pigs (Mong Cai x Large White) were allocated (4 pigs/household) among two groups of families to compare the effect of supplementing the traditional diet with ensiled cassava leaves. The overall difference was not significant and no effect on the growth of pigs was observed. In another 16 households, feeding of 15 % ensiled cassava leaves to Mong Cai sows during pregnancy, as replacement for sweetpotato vines and partial replacement of fishmeal, had no effect on reproductive traits...|$|E
30|$|The pH values {{obtained}} {{were within}} the range for small ruminant as reported by Yáñez Ruiz et al. (2004) and Salem et al. (2013). The decrease in gas production corresponds to increase in CMV proportion. The decrease in gas production observed {{may be due to}} dryness of the samples used as Calabrò et al. (2005 b) reported that dried samples had lower gas volume production compared to <b>fresh</b> <b>silage.</b> Another possible reason for decrease in gas production with increase in CMV content might be vermicomposting, as Calabrò et al. (2005 a) reported that preservation such as ensiling reduces gas yield of the neutral detergent-soluble fractions. This may be applicable to vermicomposting. Decrease in microbial activity may be responsible for decrease in gas production with increase in CMV content and {{this may be due to}} humification of the cattle manure vermicast. Microbial activity decreases with an increase in cell wall content with advancing plant maturity (Guglielmelli et al. 2011), with regard to vermicomposting humification increases with maturity and stability of the vermicompost. The ME values obtained were {{within the range}} of ME value for forages reported by Menke and Steingass (1988). The high ME value of CMV may be due to its lower NDF value, this may increase the energy value of the cast. Dehghani et al. (2012) reported that reduction in NDF concentration might increase the energy value. The decrease in DMD was due to the effect of CMC inclusion, this might be due to polymerisation of the vermicast as a result of microbial activities, after which other micro-organisms find it difficult to act upon. This may likely apply to rumen microbes. Bernal et al. (2009) reported that in composting decomposition particle may coat the surface with an impenetrable humified layer, therefore, making it difficult for micro-organisms to access it. Moreover, vermicomposting as a form of preservation may contribute to lower DMD due to increase of CMV inclusion. According to Calabrò et al. (2005 a) ensiling reduces organic matter degradability, lower net energy content and reduces the digestion rate; this may be applicable to vermicomposting. The PF 48 values reported in this study were within the theoretical range (2.74 – 4.41) reported by Makar (2004) except for CMV. According to Makar (2004), high PF value is directly associated high efficiency of microbial protein synthesis, meaning more of degraded matter is incorporated into microbial biomass. The high PF 48 value reported for CMV in this study might be due to humified nature of the cast, as it was reported that tannin-rich samples have higher PF.|$|E

The whole corn plant (300 g/kg DM) was ensiled in quadruplicate laboratory silos (7 L). L. buchneri 40788 was applied at 5 × 10 (4), 1 × 10 (5), 5 × 10 (5) and 1 × 10 (6) cfu/g of <b>fresh</b> forage. <b>Silages</b> with no additive {{were used as}} controls. After 130 d of ensiling, the silages were subjected to an aerobic stability evaluation for 12 days, in which chemical and microbiological parameters {{as well as the}} temperature of the silage were measured to determine the aerobic deterioration. The addition of L. buchneri resulted in increased acetic acid concentrations. The number of yeast colonies was low in all treated silages. The pH, lactic and propionic acid concentrations did not differ between silages. Under aerobic conditions, all the treated silages showed a low number of yeasts and a great aerobic stability. Therefore, L. buchneri is effective against yeasts and improves the aerobic stability of corn silage in laboratory silos. However, doses equal or superior to 1 × 10 (5) cfu/g of fresh forage were more efficient in the control of aerobic spoilage...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} four different forage sources {{on the performance of}} crossbred dairy cows under tropical conditions. The experiment was carried out on the Experimental Farm of the Agricultural Research Company of Minas Gerais, in Felixlândia-MG, Brazil. Twelve crossbred F 1 Holstein×Gir cows were allocated to a triplicated 4 × 4 Latin square, balanced for residual effect, with each diet assigned to one group of three cows each period. The experiment had four treatments and five experimental periods of 21 days, with 14 days for adaptation and 7 days for data collection. The treatments included sorghum <b>silage,</b> corn <b>silage,</b> <b>fresh</b> sugarcane and sugarcane silage treated with 1 % calcium oxide. Three markers LIPE®, titanium dioxide and iADF were used to estimate the individual intake and the apparent digestibility of the feed for the cows in each group. The data were subjected to analysis of variance and compared by a Tukey's test at 5 % probability using the PROC GLM of SAS, version 8. 0 for Windows software. The dry matter intake (DMI) and organic matter intake (OMI) were highest (P 0. 05) but all were higher than for the sugarcane silage-based diet (P 0. 05) but both were higher than for cows fed sugarcane <b>silage</b> and <b>fresh</b> sugarcane. Non-esterified fatty acids in the plasma were the greatest (P< 0. 05) for cows fed sugarcane silage. Nitrogen balance was the greatest for cows fed corn and sorghum <b>silage,</b> followed by <b>fresh</b> sugarcane and then sugarcane silage (P< 0. 05). The sugarcane silage-based diet resulted in low intake, low digestibility, low efficiency of nitrogen utilization, and high mobilization of body reserves by F 1 Holstein×Gir cows, but supported a milk production similar to cows fed <b>fresh</b> sugarcane.

Foi usado um arranjo fatorial 6 x 3 (seis períodos de fermentação x três inoculantes), em um delineamento inteiramente casualizado, com três repetições. Avaliaram-se os seguintes inoculantes microbianos: controle (sem inoculante), Sil All C 4 (Alltech do Brasil) e Bacto Silo C Tropical (Katec). Os teores de PB, FND e FDA, foram influenciados apenas pelo período de fermentação, enquanto para a DIVMS observou-se efeito da interação inoculante × período. Para o pH observou-se efeito de inoculante e de período, estimando-se reduções de 0, 5769; 0, 62327 e 0, 80218 unidades/dia de fermentação para as silagens controle e tratadas com Sil All e Bacto Silo, respectivamente. Para o teor de N-NH 3, observou-se efeito da interação inoculante × período. A população de bactérias ácido lático no capim antes da ensilagem foi de 10 (4) ufc/g de forragem fresca, atingindo valor máximo da ordem de 10 (8) ufc/g de silagem, para a silagem controle, aos 14 dias de fermentação, e para as silagens tratadas com inoculantes, aos 7 dias. As enterobactérias não foram detectadas a partir do terceiro dia, apresentando valor máximo de 10 (4), Values of pH, ammonia {{nitrogen}}/total nitrogen (NH 3 -N), chemical composition, in vitro DM digestibility (IVDMD) and microbial populations of elephantgrass silages produced with enzymatic-bacterial inoculants, were evaluated in six fermentation periods (1, 3, 7, 14, 28, and 56 days), using laboratory silos. A 6 x 3 (six fermentation periods x three inoculants) factorial arrangement of treatments {{in a completely}} randomized design, with three replicates, was used. The following bacterial inoculants were evaluated: control (without inoculant), Sill All C 4 (Alltech of Brazil) and Bacto Silo Tropical C (Katec). The CP, NDF and ADF contents were affected only by the fermentation period. The IVDMD, however, was affected by the inoculant × fermentation period interaction. The IVDMD concentration, however, was affected by the interaction between inoculant and fermentation period. There was a significant effect of inoculant and period on pH value, being observed reduction of 0. 5769; 0. 62327, and 0. 80218 units/day of fermentation for the control silage, silage treated with Sil All, and Bacto Silo, respectively.

40|$|Cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz), {{although}} {{native to}} Brazil, is still underutilized, {{especially when it}} comes to using its aerial part. In order to study the potential of the cassava plant for use as animal feed, the present work evaluated the characteristics of the aerial part of cassava when submitted to the processes of ensiling and haymaking. Treatments consisted of: aerial part of the plant ensiled without wilting (PAS); aerial part ensiled after wilting (PAE), and aerial part made into hay (PAF). Chemical analyses were run in order to evaluate the traits that determine the nutritional value of silage and hay. Wilting increased dry matter concentration from 25 % to 27. 7 %, without changing the concentration of soluble carbohydrates (33. 3 and 35. 5 % in the PAS and PAE, respectively), as well as buffer capacity (204 mmol kg- 1 DM in PAS and 195 mmol kg- 1 DM in PAE). Neither pH (3. 57 in <b>fresh</b> <b>silage</b> and 3. 60 in PAE) nor the ADIN concentration (11. 32 % of total nitrogen in PAS and 9. 99 % of total nitrogen in PAE) differed between the silages, but ADIN concentration was higher in hay (15. 39 %). Wilting caused an increase in the concentration of ammonia (from 6. 5 % of total nitrogen in PAS to 13. 0 of total nitrogen in PAE). The levels of volatile fatty acids did not change with wilting. The ensiling process reduced the concentrations of free hydrocyanide (HCN), without, however, affecting cyanohydrin. A mandioca, apesar de ser nativa do Brasil, ainda é sub-utilizada principalmente quando a questão é o aproveitamento da sua parte aérea. Com o objetivo de estudar o potencial da mandioca para alimentação animal, o presente trabalho avaliou as características da parte aérea da planta quando submetida os processos de ensilagem e fenação. Os tratamentos consistiram de: parte aérea ensilada sem emurchecimento (PAS); parte aérea ensilada após 24 horas de emurchecimento (PAE) e parte aérea fenada (PAF). As análises químicas foram realizadas a fim de avaliar os parâmetros que determinam o valor nutritivo da silagem e do feno. O emurchecimento elevou o teor de matéria seca de 25 % no material in natura para 27. 7 %, sem alterar o teor de carboidratos solúveis (33. 3 e 35. 5 % de MS na PAS e PAE respectivamente), bem como o poder tampão (204 mmol kg- 1 MS na PAS e 195 mmol kg- 1 MS na PAE). Nem o pH (3. 57 na silagem in natura e 3. 60 na PAE) nem os teores de NIDA (11. 32 % do nitrogênio total na MS na PAS e 9. 99 % do nitrogênio total na MS na PAE) diferiram entre as silagens, mas o NIDA foi maior na forragem fenada (15. 39 %). Contudo, o emurchecimento provocou aumento no nitrogênio amoniacal (de 6. 5 % do nitrogênio total na MS da PAS para 13. 0 do nitrogênio total na MS da PAE).

40|$|Since forage forms a {{large part}} of growing {{ruminant}} rations in Ireland, the trust of this project was to examine the effect of ensilage on ruminal digestion of grass and to examine ruminal microbial protein and intestinally absorbable protein supplied by grass and/or clover. A range of in vitro and in vivo techniques were employed and strategies used by commercial beef producers to optimise cattle growth (and nutrient supply) were also documented. To accomplish the aims of this project, a range of methodology developments/ modifications in vitro and in vivo was carried out. From in vitro methodology development it was concluded that : (i) Compared with <b>fresh</b> <b>silage,</b> drying per se may give artifically higher rates of dry matter (DM) digestion. (ii) Greater experimental precision can be obtained by ensuring a greater substrate surface area to reaction volume ratio in each reaction vessel. (iii) For studies where the rate of digestion is of greatest importance, pre-incubation of frozen inoculum in a nutrient medium best simulated the cellulolytic activity of unfrozen inoculum. In studies that require large volumes of inoculum for extended work, freezing directly is justified. (iv) Neutral detergent extraction altered in vitro digestion characteristics of silage. The residue after washing with water at 70 °C has a high residual fibre concentration and is more representative of the structural components of silage ingested by ruminants. (v) A semi-continuous culture system developed at Grange Research Centre can successfully model in vitro ruminal digestion of fibre and starch-based diets in a controlled environment. From in vivo methodology development it was concluded that : (i) Oven drying at 60 °C and correction for loss of volatiles gives a good estimation of DM concentration of ruminal particulate digesta. This procedure has the added advantage that drying at 60 °C allows the residual materials to be analysed for fibre fractions without concern for heat damage which can occur at a higher drying temperature. (ii) A naso-ruminal sampling device can be used to measure the relative patterns of fermentation of contrasting diet types when in situ for up to 7 days. (ii) Application of a vacuum to withdraw samples had no negative effect on ruminal fluid variables. From in vitro studies on grass digestion, it was concluded that : (i) Ensiling of grass decreased the apparent extent of digestion of cell walls when {{in the presence of the}} whole plant and that this largely reflected an increase in the lag time before digestion commenced. (ii) Ensiling of grass did not negatively affect the digestion of isolated cell walls. (iii) There is a negative impact of ensiling on microbial protein production from the water soluble carbohydrate fraction of grass. (iv) Supplementation with the water soluble fraction of grass significantly improved the apparent extent of digestion for ensiled forages when compared with the supplementation of the post-ensiling fraction in a batch culture system. (v) There is a negative impact of maturity on the pattern of cell wall fermentation and that this impact can be decreased by ensiling method. From studies on herbage digestion in vivo it was concluded that : (i) Grass silage type had a greater effect than the rate of concentrate fermentation on ruminal microbal protein synthesis. (ii) Harvesting time had a bigger impact on nutrient supply from herbage than sward type (grass or grass/clover). (iii) Increasing clover content in the herbage decreased the biological value (g nitrogen retained/kg absorbed) of dietary protein. Diverse stratgies were used on commercial beef farms to optimise nutrient supply and animal growth. Average animal performance on individual farms was not better than would be typically recorded in a research environment. There was scope on many of the farms to improve technical performance and to decrease the costs of production. End of Project ReportEuropean Union Structural Funds (EAGGF...|$|E
40|$|Summary : The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to investigate the fermentation quality characteristics of Chineria-Mama whole crop rice silage and to examine the effect of addition of fermented juice of silage extract (FJSE) and fermented juice of epiphytic lactic acid bacteria (FJLB) on the fermentation quality. Rice plant (Oryza sativa L. line, Chineria-Mama) was cultivated by using conventional methods and was harvested on September 8 (Sept-cutting) and October 6 (Oct-cutting), 2006. The rice plants were cut with a cutter blower into 1 - 3 cm pieces and were crammed into plastic pouches without (control) or with 1 % of FJSE (FJSE treatment) or FJLB (FJLB treatment) in the <b>fresh</b> matter. All <b>silages</b> were maintained indoors and opened after 1 month. FJSE and FJLB were prepared according to the following method. 100 g of the cut <b>fresh</b> Chineria-Mama <b>silage</b> and Chineria-Mama rice plant were macerated with 500 mL of water and 10 g granulated sugar was added. The mixture was incubated anaerobically at room temperature for 2 days, and then filtered through quadruple layers of cheesecloth. The filtrate was collected in a plastic bucket and blended with 10 g granulated sugar. There was no remarkable difference in crude protein, ether extracts and neutral detergent fiber content between the Sept-cutting rice plant and the Oct-cutting rice plant. The non fibrous carbohydrates content of Chineria-Mama rice plant was 33. 1 % Sept-cutting and 33. 6 % Oct-cutting in the dry matter. The pH values for silage of control, FJSE treatment and FJLB treatment were the range of 3. 6 - 3. 8. Moisture contents for all silages of Sept-cutting were higher than those of Oct-cutting (P＜ 0. 01). The lactic acid contents in the fresh matter of all silages were more than 1 %, and that of FJSE treatment silage was lowest (P＜ 0. 05) at Sept-cutting and Oct-cutting. Propionic acid was observed only in FLSE treatment silage (P＜ 0. 01). Butyric acid contents were low in the silage of control, FJSE treatment and FJLB treatment. There was no large difference in volatile basic nitrogen content among three treatment silages. The present results suggest that the fermentation quality of Chineria-Mama whole crop rice silage is good, and the addition of FJSE and FJLB prepared in this experiment can not improve on the lactic fermentation of silage. 　　Key Words : Chineria-Mama, fermented juice of epiphytic lactic acid bacteria, fermented juice of silage extract, fermentation quality, whole crop rice silage　　キーワード：イネ「チネリア・ママ｣,サイレージ抽出培養液,原材料由来乳酸菌培養液,発酵品質,イネホールクロップサイレー...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Wheat {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} cultivated cereals in Uruguay for human consumption; however, when harvest yields are low, wheat is usually used in ensiling for animal feeding. Ensiling is a forage preservation method that allows for storage during extended periods of time while maintaining nutritional values comparable to <b>fresh</b> pastures. <b>Silage</b> is vulnerable to contamination by spoilage molds and mycotoxins because ensilage materials are excellent substrates for fungal growth. The aim of the study was to identify the mycobiota composition and occurrence of aflatoxins and DON from wheat silage. A total of 220 samples of wheat were collected from four farms in the southwest region of Uruguay were silage practices are developed. The main fungi isolated were Fusarium (43 %) and Aspergillus (36 %), with Fusarium graminearum sensu lato and Aspergillus section Flavi being the most prevalent species. Aflatoxin concentrations in silo bags ranged from 6. 1 to 23. 3 µg/kg, whereas DON levels ranged between 3000 µg/kg and 12, 400 µg/kg. When evaluating aflatoxigenic capacity, 27. 5 % of Aspergillus section Flavi strains produced AFB 1, 5 % AFB 2, 10 % AFG 1 and 17. 5 % AFG 2. All isolates of F. graminearum sensu lato produced DON and 15 -AcDON. The results from this study contribute to the knowledge of mycobiota and mycotoxins present in wheat silage...|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} fresh legume types or silage on the {{composition}} of milk fatty acids and transcription of enzymes involved in the synthesis of milk fat in cows was studied. Three groups of cows grazed white clover, red clover and lucerne, respectively. A fourth group of cows was fed maize/grass silage. The cows grazing high proportions of legumes produced significantly more C 18 : 1 trans- 11, C 18 : 2 cis 9 -trans 11, C 18 : 2 trans 10 -cis 12 and C 18 : 3 fatty acids than cows fed silage. White clover and lucerne grazing resulted in significantly less output of C 18 : 1 trans 9 in milk than red clover grazing and maize/grass silages. The transcription of Stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) in mammary tissue was significantly increased by grassing high proportions legume whereas fatty acid synthase and Acetyl-Coa carboxylase was not affected by type of feeding. Furthermore, average milk fat globule diameter was correlated to daily milk fat yield but was not affected by feeding. Although the fresh forage affected the transcription of SCD in mammary tissue, the largest effects were on the trans 11 -based fatty acids, concluding that type of forage, i. e. <b>fresh</b> or <b>silage,</b> had larger impact on rumen fermentation pattern than on transcription of enzymes involved in the synthesis of milk fat...|$|R
