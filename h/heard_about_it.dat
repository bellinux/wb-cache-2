5|$|The {{conflict}} between Paul Brown and Modell reached a breaking point when Brown traded star halfback Bobby Mitchell {{for the rights}} to Ernie Davis, a Heisman Trophy-winning running back who broke all of Jim Brown's rushing records at Syracuse. Paul Brown did not inform Modell of the move, and Modell only <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> after getting a call from Washington Redskins owner George Preston Marshall. Davis, however, was diagnosed with leukemia before the 1962 season. He came to Cleveland to train after the cancer went into remission, but Brown would not allow him to play. Modell, however, wanted to give Davis a chance to play before he succumbed to the disease. Ultimately, the relationship between coach and owner was never repaired, and Ernie Davis never played in a professional game, dying on May 18, 1963.|$|E
5|$|A {{legacy of}} the Manhattan Project was the network of {{national}} laboratories, but none was located on the East Coast. Rabi and Ramsey assembled a group of universities in the New York area to lobby for their own national laboratory. When Zacharias, who was now at MIT, <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> {{he set up a}} rival group at MIT and Harvard. Rabi had discussions with Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., the director of the Manhattan Project, who was willing to go along with a new national laboratory, but only one. Moreover, while the Manhattan Project still had funds, the wartime organization was expected to be phased out when a new authority came into existence. After some bargaining and lobbying by Rabi and others, the two groups came together in January 1946. Eventually nine universities (Columbia, Cornell, Harvard, Johns Hopkins, MIT, Princeton, Pennsylvania, Rochester and Yale) came together, and on 31 January 1947 a contract was signed with the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), which had replaced the Manhattan Project, that established the Brookhaven National Laboratory.|$|E
5|$|On June 11, Dodge escorted Brady to {{the mouth}} of the Fox River to confer with overall {{commander}} General Henry Atkinson. Dodge left the conference with clear authority from Atkinson to deal with the violence in the mining region. He first traveled to his home fort, at Gratiot's Grove, which he reached on June 13. The Spafford Farm massacre occurred the following day, and Dodge set out for Fort Hamilton as soon as he <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> stopping at Fort Blue Mounds for supplies. On the way to Hamilton, the soldiers passed a German immigrant, Henry Apple, exchanged greetings and kept traveling. Shortly afterwards the soldiers heard gunshots in the distance; Apple had met with a Kickapoo ambush, likely meant for Dodge himself. Dodge was probably saved by his last minute decision to make a detour from the main route. Later Apple's horse galloped wildly back past the men, wounded and carrying a large amount of blood in its saddle. The horse continued all the way to Fort Hamilton, where it raised a furor among the inhabitants.|$|E

25|$|The Jin Shu {{mentioned}} that Chen Shou fell sick during the filial mourning period after his father's death. Some guests who visited his home expressed disapproval {{when they saw}} him being served medicine by his servants, because {{he was expected to}} lead an austere life during that period. His fellow townsfolk criticised him when they <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
25|$|However, {{immediately}} before War of Bavarian Succession, {{he was completely}} disgraced. On a visit in Potsdam, in 1778, he allowed himself {{to comment on the}} imminent war; the King <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> and, when Stutterheim asked for his retirement, he received it but, at the same time, the King withdrew his dignities and honors. Stutterheim retired to his estate at Kloster Mansfeld and died there on 29 March 1780.|$|E
25|$|Ma Chao {{constantly}} asked Zhang Lu to {{give him}} some troops to attack Liang Province. Zhang Lu agreed, but Ma Chao failed to make any gains from the campaign. Yang Bai (楊白), an officer under Zhang Lu, was jealous of Ma Chao's ability and wanted to harm him. When Ma Chao <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> he escaped from Wudu (武都; around present-day Longnan, Gansu) and went to live with the Di people around the area.|$|E

25|$|As {{the first}} batch of prisoners were being marched from Erfurt to Frankfort-on-the-Main, the column {{encountered}} 50 troopers of the Pletz Hussar Regiment # 3. The hussars scattered the inadequate escort and released between 4,000 and 5,000 prisoners. When he <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> an enraged Napoleon blamed Murat for the fiasco. However, Saxe-Weimar was unable to exploit this success. He tried to round up the released prisoners but they all ran away, and none could be returned to their units.|$|E
25|$|On Sunday, 6 July, police {{took into}} custody six Jewish {{suspects}} for interrogation, stating {{that they believed}} the murder was most likely carried out by 'terrorists' as revenge. One confessed quickly, incriminating three others, some of them minors, and they were put on remand for 8 days. Within a day, three had confessed and reenacted the murder {{at the scene of}} the crime. Three other suspects were released as unconnected with the crime, though they <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> from the alleged murderers.|$|E
25|$|Xiahou Shang {{married the}} younger sister of Cao Zhen, an adopted son of Cao Cao {{and a close}} {{childhood}} friend of Cao Pi. In his later years, Xiahou Shang took a concubine, whom he loved dearly. A family feud broke out when Xiahou Shang's concubine started fighting with Cao Zhen's sister to become Xiahou Shang's official spouse. When Cao Pi <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> he decided to intervene as a show of support for his fellow members of the Cao clan, so he had Xiahou Shang's concubine executed by strangulation.|$|E

25|$|A {{paper towel}} {{has the same}} {{purposes}} as conventional towels such as drying hands, wiping windows, dusting, cleaning up spills. However, paper towels can only be used once after they blot wet surfaces. A school teacher in Ashland, Ohio, named Kurt Klier, gave students individual paper squares, so that the single towel in the bathroom would not be infected with germs. When Arthur Scott, head of the Scott Paper Company <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> he {{decided to try to}} sell a load of paper that had been made too thick to use as toilet paper.|$|E
25|$|After Cao Cao died in March 220, Qu Yan (麴演) {{started a}} {{rebellion}} in Xiping Commandery (西平郡; around present-day Xining, Qinghai). When Su Ze <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> he led troops from Jincheng Commandery {{to quell the}} revolt. A fearful Qu Yan surrendered to Su Ze. Cao Cao's son and successor Cao Pi, who became the new de facto head of the Han central government, granted Su Ze the additional appointment of Colonel Who Protects the Qiang (護羌校尉) and enfeoffed him as a Secondary Marquis (關內侯) {{as a reward for}} his success in putting down the rebellion.|$|E
25|$|A {{few years}} later, after Deng Dang died, Zhang Zhao {{recommended}} Lü Meng to replace Deng Dang, so Lü Meng was appointed as a Major of Separate Command (別部司馬). In 200 CE, Sun Ce was assassinated, after which his younger brother, Sun Quan, succeeded {{him as the}} warlord ruling the Jiangdong territories. Sun Quan planned reorganise the army by merging small units into larger garrisons. When Lü Meng <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> he collected funds to purchase elaborately designed armour for his troops. When Sun Quan came to inspect Lü Meng's men, he was so impressed that he placed more soldiers under Lü Meng's command, thus saving his troops from being merged into another unit.|$|E

25|$|Following Sun Quan's {{death in}} May 252, the Grand Tutor Zhuge Ke, {{who had been}} {{appointed}} regent for Sun Quan's youngest son and successor, Sun Liang, proposed to the imperial court to move the nobles away from areas with a heavy military presence. He thus relocated Sun Fen from Wuchang to Yuzhang Commandery (豫章郡; around present-day Nanchang, Jiangxi). However, Sun Fen turned furious when he <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> and refused {{to move out of}} Wuchang. Zhuge Ke wrote a long letter to Sun Fen to warn him about the perils of not knowing his place and to remind him of the downfall of his fourth brother, Sun Ba, the Prince of Lu.|$|E
25|$|Xu Sheng's ego did {{not always}} lead to {{positive}} actions though. After the Battle of Ruxu in 217, Zhou Tai was appointed as {{the commander of the}} garrison at Ruxu, with Xu Sheng and Zhu Ran as his subordinates. However, both of them were unwilling to submit to Zhou Tai's command, citing the latter's humble origins in comparison to their more affluent family backgrounds. When Sun Quan <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> he visited Ruxu and hosted a party for all the officers there, during which he asked Zhou Tai to display his battle scars for all to see. He later awarded Zhou with an imperial parasol. After that incident, Xu Sheng and Zhu Ran agreed to submit to Zhou Tai's command.|$|E

25|$|In 230, Cao Rui {{promoted}} Man Chong to General Who Attacks the East (征東將軍). In {{the winter}} of that year, after receiving intelligence that the Wu emperor Sun Quan was planning to attack Hefei, Man Chong immediately requested for reinforcements from Yan and Yu provinces and stepped up the defences at Hefei. When Sun Quan <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> he called off the attack on Hefei. Man Chong knew that Sun Quan was only pretending to retreat to put him off guard, and {{would come back to}} attack Hefei again once the reinforcements left. He was proven right as Sun Quan attacked Hefei after about 10 days. However, as Hefei was well-defended, Sun Quan's forces could not breach the walls and had to withdraw.|$|E
25|$|The pages {{purport to}} be three {{computer}} printouts from Daddy's House, indicating that Wallace was in the studio recording a song called Nasty Boy on the afternoon Shakur was shot. They indicate that Wallace wrote half the session, was In and out/sat around and laid down a ref, shorthand for a reference vocal, {{the equivalent of a}} first take. But nothing indicates when the documents were created. And Louis Alfred, the recording engineer listed on the sheets, {{said in an interview that}} he remembered recording the song with Wallace in a late-night session, not during the day. He could not recall the date of the session but said it was likely not the night Shakur was shot. We would have <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> Mr. Alfred said.|$|E
25|$|While {{the project}} was still in its initial stage of development, bitter {{disagreements}} and quarrels broke out among the scholars {{due to differences in}} opinion. Xu Ci and Hu Qian started making accusations and taking petty revenge against each other. They bickered among themselves and constantly sought opportunities to provoke each other. They also praised themselves and scorned their colleagues. When Liu Bei <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> he came up with an idea to urge them to put aside their differences and cooperate with each other. He gathered all the officials for a feast and had actors put up a skit parodying the conflict between Xu Ci and Hu Qian, showing how a war of words between them led to them using weapons to attack each other. Despite Liu Bei's efforts, the project ultimately {{turned out to be a}} failure.|$|E
