40|$|Objective To {{explore the}} {{relationship}} between coping mechanisms and suicidal <b>ideations</b> among women who experience symptoms of postpartum depression. Design This exploratory descriptive study used secondary data from a study of women who experienced symptoms of postpartum depression. Participants Convenience and purposive sampling were used to obtain the community sample of 40 women who experienced symptoms of postpartum depression. Methods Binary logistic regression was employed to explore emotion-focused coping, avoidance-focused coping, problem-focused coping, and religious coping as predictors of suicidal <b>ideations.</b> Results Approximately 27 % of the sample reported suicidal <b>ideations</b> within the past seven days. The results showed that lower levels of emotion-focused coping {{and higher levels of}} avoidance-focused and religious coping predicted suicidal <b>ideations</b> in participants. Problem-focused coping did not predict suicidal <b>ideations.</b> Conclusion Overall, our findings provide support for the importance of coping mechanisms as predictors of suicidal <b>ideations</b> among women who experience symptoms of postpartum depression. The results illustrate the need for health professionals to conduct routine assessments on coping strategies and thoughts of suicide when caring for postpartum women, as well as the need to integrate coping approaches in the prevention and treatment of suicidal <b>ideations...</b>|$|R

The sample consisted of 5, 114 participants from Wave IV from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health.

25|$|Patel et al. {{found that}} {{southern}} Indian states have ten times {{higher rates of}} suicides than some northern states. This difference, they claim, is not because of misclassification of a person's death. The most common cause for suicide in South India are a combination of social issues, such as interpersonal and family problems, financial difficulties, and pre-existing mental illness. Suicidal <b>ideation</b> is as culturally accepted in south India as in some high-income countries. The high suicide rates in southern states of India may be, suggest Patel el al., {{in part because of}} social acceptance of suicide as a method to deal with difficulties. Suicide <b>ideation</b> among surviving family members of farmers' suicide victims is another worry. Recent study shows that almost a third of suicide survivors (family members left behind) had suicide <b>ideation</b> in one month prior to assessment.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Risk {{of suicide}} in {{patients}} with schizophrenia is 20 - to 50 -fold {{higher than in the}} general population. The impact of suicidal behaviour on quality of life rarely was a subject of in-depth analysis. The issue is particularly important in patients after first psychiatric hospitalisation, since the risk of suicide is very high during the first postdischarge months. The aim {{of this study was to}} analyse correlations between presence of suicidal <b>ideations</b> prior to first hospitalisation and quality of life of patients with schizophrenia during the first post-hospitalisation year. Material and method: Overall, 86 patients were enrolled in the study. Suicidal <b>ideations</b> and behaviours were assessed based on interviews with patients and their relatives, as well as on medical records. The patients’ quality of life was evaluated one month (1 st exam) and after one year (2 nd exam) after discharge. Quality of life was assessed using the WHOQOL questionnaire and the SFS scale. Psychopathological symptoms were evaluated using the PANSS inventory. Results: Prior to first hospitalisation, suicidal <b>ideations</b> were present in 39. 5...|$|R

25|$|In 2007 the FDA {{required}} all antidepressants {{to carry}} a black box warning stating that antidepressants may {{increase the risk of}} suicide in people younger than 25. This warning is based on statistical analyses conducted by two independent groups of FDA experts that found a 2-fold increase of the suicidal <b>ideation</b> and behavior in children and adolescents, and 1.5-fold increase of suicidality in the 18–24 age group. The suicidality was slightly decreased for those older than 24, and statistically significantly lower in the 65 and older group. This analysis was criticized by Donald Klein, who noted that suicidality, that is suicidal <b>ideation</b> and behavior, is not necessarily a good surrogate marker for completed suicide, and it is still possible that antidepressants may prevent actual suicide while increasing suicidality.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} the relationship between childhood sexual abuse (CSA) and suicidal <b>ideations</b> (SI) in Latinos and African-Americans.

An independent-samples t test comparing the mean scores of Latino group and control groups found {{a significant difference between the}} means of the two groups (t(5) =- 2. 089, p < 05). These findings suggest that CSA may be a serious risk factor for suicidal <b>ideations</b> in Latinos. Furthermore, culturally-sensitive CSA mental health treatment is necessary. Future studies should investigate culture specific triggers that place Latinos with a history of CSA at specific risk for SI...|$|R

Agnew's general strain theory provides the theoretical framework for the study. Structural equation modelling (SEM) was conducted allowing explicit modelling of both direct and mediating effects using observed and latent variables. The findings showed that both depressed mood and anger mediated the relationship between family conflict/violence and sexual abuse and suicidal attempts. However, when testing the mediating pathways between sexual abuse and family conflict/violence and suicidal <b>ideations,</b> only depressed mood but not anger turned out to be a significant mediator.
