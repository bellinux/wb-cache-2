Landscape {{structure}} quantification is {{a subject}} of great interest in the environmental sciences because of the practical ad-vantages it offers, including calculation of the <b>environmental</b> <b>indices</b> useful for land management, ecology and many other fields. A trend of developing new systems of <b>environmental</b> <b>indices</b> {{can be observed in}} European Institutions such as EEA and EUROSTAT, but there has been criticism about approaches based on Corine Land Cover (CLC). One of the aims {{of this article is to}} review the method of this database preparation for the purpose of calculating <b>environmental</b> <b>indices.</b> This study tests the ability of three methods to scale categorical maps and retaining as much of the original landscape structure information as possible. The vector scaling method is comparable to the preparation of the CLC data. Two other methods use Geo-Object Image Analysis as the main tool for classifi-cation. The scaling is performed in this method through building a hierarchy of objects and scaling the raster imagery. The results are compared and evaluated for scale effects and the calculation of <b>environmental</b> <b>indices</b> on the basis of the scaled data. There is no universal method for all the characteristics of the landscape pattern. The GEOBIA-based methods demonstrate greater applicability to fine grained structural and landscape configuration analyses.

40|$|Abstract. Environmental Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) {{has emerged}} {{over the past}} years as a method to assess {{environmental}} impacts of products and processes. In this case study we use LCA to obtain an environmental measure for refined oils, which are inputs for fat blends. As a start, an inventory is drawn up of the environmental effects of the oils. Then we use the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to aggregate the scores of these effects to one <b>environmental</b> <b>index</b> for each oil. This multiple criteria decision tool involves making pairwise comparisons between the environmental effects, resulting in relative weight factors. Multiplying the effect scores with the relative weights yields an <b>environmental</b> <b>index.</b> It is now possible to improve the envi-ronmental impact of a fat blend composition using the <b>environmental</b> <b>index</b> in a linear programming (LP) blending model. With this combination of methods, environmental spects of products can become part of product portfolio management.

Differences in yield in response to changes in weather conditions over the years were evident with clones RRII 203, RRIM 703, PB 5 / 51 and PB 235 which all exhibited a negative trend with increasing wind velocity during 1997 - 98, these clones also exhibited a negative correlation with minimum temperature during 1998 - 99. The prominent yield differences across the years made selection based on both yield and stability inevitable through computing weather variables and <b>environmental</b> <b>index</b> as covariant. To determine the contribution of variable(s) to genotype-environment (GE) interactions, the GE interaction was partitioned into heterogeneity and residual GE interaction. Heterogeneity only for <b>environmental</b> <b>index</b> was highly significant (p = 0. 01), meaning that stability or instability of clones was due to a linear effect of the <b>environmental</b> <b>index.</b> The non-significant values of heterogeneity for the weather variables revealed {{that none of these}} factors individually was sufficient to explain heterogeneity.

"In today’s {{fiercely}} competitive environment, {{the goal}} of any enterprise is to make money {{now and in the}} future (Goldratt, 1992). In order to fulfill this goal, an enterprise should eliminate waste embedded in the value stream. Industrial engineers frequently play a key role in reducing cost. The philosophy of many in lean manufacturing is that the things that can’t be measured can’t be properly managed (Womack & Jones, 1996). This thesis presents a method to incorporate an <b>environmental</b> <b>index</b> into the value stream and thereby increase the opportunities for waste minimization. The proposed method of incorporation of the <b>environmental</b> <b>index</b> is explained in detail using a hypothetical case study. How to calculate the <b>environmental</b> <b>index,</b> the present state and future state maps of the value stream are explained in detail. The two major steps presented by this method are: Identify environmental wastes and incorporate the identified wastes into the value stream map.

S 1. 1. 4 Conference Theme: Advancing Behavior Change SciencePURPOSE: To examine associations of multiple perceived neighbourhood environmental attributes with total sedentary time assessed by accelerometer, using single environmental perceptions and a composite <b>environmental</b> <b>index</b> as the exposure variables. Region-specific and gender-specific associations were also examined. METHODS: Analyses of data from the International Physical activity and Environment Network (IPEN) Adult Study were conducted with 5, 712 participants from 10 countries. The Neighborhood Environment Walkability Scale (NEWS) {{was used to assess}} 10 perceived neighborhood attributes: residential density; land use mix - diversity; land use mix - access; street connectivity; infrastructure and safety for walking; aesthetics; traffic safety; safety from crime; streets having few cul-de-sacs; and, no physical barriers to walking. The composite <b>environmental</b> <b>index</b> was created by summing the standardized scores of variables positively related and subtracting the standardized scores of variables that were negatively related to sedentary time. Total minutes/day of sedentary time and total minutes of moderate-to-vigorous intensity {{physical activity}} (MVPA) were derived from accelerometer counts. Associations of each perceived environmental attribute and the composite <b>environmental</b> <b>index</b> with sedentary time were estimated using generalized additive mixed models (GAMMs), adjusting for study site, socio-demographic covariates, objectively measured MVPA, accelerometer wear time and area-level socioeconomic status. RESULTS: Street connectivity was negatively related to sedentary time, while residential density, pedestrian infrastructure and safety and lack of barriers to walking were positively related. Perceived aesthetics and safety from crime were negatively related to sedentary time in women only. Land use mix was negatively related to sedentary time in men only. Associations did not differ significantly by study site. The predicted difference in sedentary time between those with the minimum (- 9. 2) and maximum (11. 6) observed values on the composite <b>environmental</b> <b>index</b> was 71 min/day of sedentary time CONCLUSION: Positive associations of residential density, pedestrian infrastructure and safety and lack of barriers to walking with objectively-measured sedentary time were unexpected. Street connectivity, land use mix and aesthetics, which {{have been found to be}} related to physical activity, may also influence sedentary time. Synergistic relationships environmental attributes with sedentary time appear to be strong and require further investigation...|$|E

40|$|The {{elaboration}} of Environmental Quality Indexes (EQI) for big cities {{is one of}} the main topics in regional and environmental economics. One of the usual methodological paths consists of generating a single measure as a linear combination of several air contaminants applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Then, as a final step, a spatial interpolation is carried out to determine the level of contamination across the city in order to point out the so-called ‘hot points’. In this article, we propose an alternative approach to build an EQI introducing some methodological and practical novelties. From the point of view of the selection of the variables, first we will consider noise -joint to air pollution- as a relevant environmental variable. We also propose to add ‘subjective’ data -available at the census tracts level- to the group of ‘objective’ environmental variables, which are only available at a number of environmental monitoring stations. This combination leads to a mixed <b>environmental</b> <b>index</b> (MEQI), which is more complete and adequate in a socioeconomic context. From the point of view of the computation process, we use kriging to match the monitoring stations registers to the Census data.

In a first step, we krige the environmental variables to the complete surface and finally, we elaborate the <b>environmental</b> <b>index.</b> At last, in order to build the final synthetic index, we do not use Principal Components Analysis -as it is usual in this kind of exercises- but a better one, the Pena Distance method (DP 2). ...|$|E
