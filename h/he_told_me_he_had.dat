2500|$|Mark Chorvinsky, {{editor of}} Strange magazine, {{promoted}} Wallace's {{claim that he}} tipped off Patterson exactly {{where to look for}} a Bigfoot. Chorvinsky wrote, [...] "'Roger Patterson came [...] dozens of times pumping me on this Bigfoot,' Ray Wallace explained to researcher Dennis Pilchis in 1982. 'I felt sorry for Roger Patterson. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> cancer of the lymph glands and he was desperately broke and he wanted to try to get something where he could have a little income. Well, he went down there exactly where I told him. I told him, 'You go down there and hang around on that bank. Stay up there and watch that spot.'" [...] David Daegling summarized Chorvinsky's argument and concluded that Wallace [...] "had a degree of involvement" [...] with the Patterson–Gimlin film, and that this gave grounds for suspicion of it.|$|E
2500|$|On September 21, Ravi sent {{a friend}} {{a series of}} text messages, {{including}} messages saying, [...] "Yeah, keep the gays away" [...] and [...] "People are having a viewing party {{with a bottle of}} Bacardi and beer in this kid's room for my roommate" [...] along with directions on how to view it remotely. At 6:39p.m., Ravi tweeted, [...] "Anyone with iChat, I dare you to video chat me between the hours of 9:30 and 12. Yes, it's happening again." [...] Ravi had set up the webcam and initially pointed it towards Clementi's bed. Ravi has stated that he realized that his [...] "joke" [...] was [...] "stupid", and pointed the webcam towards his own bed before the planned viewing on September 21. The police say, however, that it was subsequently found still pointed directly at Clementi's bed. When Ravi's friend suggested that Clementi and his guest might use his bed, Ravi said [...] "My webcam checks my bed, hahaha." [...] At trial, two Rutgers students testified that Ravi had spent part of that early evening in their dorm rooms, and used their computers to verify that the webcam was still focused on the bed. The captain of Ravi's Ultimate Frisbee team testified that, after practice that evening, Ravi [...] "told me he had set up a webcam of some sort to capture images of his roommate. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> done it before that date" [...] and [...] "that he was planning on doing it again. That night." [...] When Clementi returned to his room, he noticed the camera and texted a friend saying he had unplugged Ravi's powerstrip to prevent further video streaming during his date. Ravi has said that he had changed his mind regarding the broadcast and disabled the camera himself by putting the computer in sleep mode.|$|E
2500|$|In the dashcam audio/video of the {{incident}} Yanez can be heard being questioned by St. Anthony Police Officer Tressa Sunde within minutes of the shooting, and telling her: {{was sitting in the}} car, seat belted. I told him, 'Can I see your license?' And then, <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> a firearm. I told him not to reach for it and (sigh) when he went down to grab, I told him not to reach for it (clears throat) and then he kept it right there, and I told him to take his hands off of it, and then he (sigh) he had his, his grip a lot wider than a wallet .... And I don't know where the gun was, he didn't tell me where the fucking gun was, and then it was just getting hinky, he gave, he was just staring ahead, and then I was getting fucking nervous, and then I told him, I know I fucking told him to get his fucking hand off his gun.According to the official Minnesota Department of Public Safety's Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) transcript of the interview of Yanez and his attorneys Tom Kelly and Robert Fowler, Yanez stated that his justification for the shooting was based on fear for his own life because he believed that Castile's behavior was abusive toward a young girl passenger (Reynolds' daughter) in the car. Yanez said: [...] "I thought, I was gonna die, and I thought if he's, if he has the, the guts and the audacity to smoke marijuana in front of the five-year-old girl and risk her lungs and risk her life by giving her secondhand smoke and the front seat passenger doing the same thing, then what, what care does he give about me?" [...] The victims' previous marijuana use later became a focus of the defense, with a mason jar containing a small amount having been found in the car.|$|E

2500|$|Next morning, Thursday, Sasun Eff. {{came in at}} 10; I {{took him}} {{straight}} to Sir Percy and left them. Half an hour later, he returned {{and told me that}} he had accepted and I understood the full significance of the Nunc Dimittis. He asked me what he could now do to help and I sent him straight to the Naqib. The leading Shi'ah of Baghdad had also refused to join the Council and it was essential to get him in. In the midst of this talk Sir Percy sent for me. I left Sasun to Mr Philby and went to consult with Sir Percy. We agreed that I should send at once for Ja'far, tell him what had happened and bid him bestir himself. It was past one o'clock before I caught Ja'far. We had the most extraordinary conversation. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> come into the Cabinet, only to defeat Talib, that he distrusted and loathed him and regarded it as shameful that he should be one of the leading persons of Mesopotamia. I said that the Mesopotamians themselves had made him, by their fear and their servility, and that it was for them to unmake him if they wished. We then discussed how to win over the extremists, I assured him that that was Sir Percy's chief desire and taking heart, he asked if he might talk to Sir Percy. I took him at once to Sir Percy and left them together, with the assured conviction that Sir Percy was the best exponent of his own policy.”… “Oh, if we can pull this thing off! rope together the young hotheads, and the Shi'ah obscurantists, and enthusiasts like Ja'far, polished old statesmen like Sasun, and scholars like Shukri—if we can make them work together and find their own salvation for themselves, what a fine thing it will be. I see visions and dream dreams. But as we say in Arabic countless times a day [...] "Through the presence of His Excellency the Representative of the King, and with the help of the Great Government, all please God, must be well!" ...|$|E
