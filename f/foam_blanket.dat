25|$|Foam-compatible, {{which is}} a sodium {{bicarbonate}} (BC) based dry chemical, was developed for use with protein foams for fighting class B fires. Most dry chemicals contain metal stearates to waterproof them, but these will tend to destroy the <b>foam</b> <b>blanket</b> created by protein (animal) based foams. Foam compatible type uses silicone as a waterproofing agent, which does not harm foam. Effectiveness is identical to regular dry chemical, and it is light green in color (some ANSUL brand formulations are blue). This agent is generally no longer used since most modern dry chemicals are considered compatible with synthetic foams such as AFFF.|$|E
5000|$|It {{is proven}} that CAFS attacks all three {{sides of the}} fire {{triangle}} simultaneously. The <b>foam</b> <b>blankets</b> the fuel, thereby reducing the fuel’s capacity to seek out a source of oxygen. The CAFS solution adheres to ceilings and walls, more readily aiding in rapid reduction in heat. Also, the opaque surfaces of the foam, as it adheres to walls and ceilings, shield the fuel source from radiant energy. (Brooks, 2005; Brooks, 2006) ...|$|R

40|$|A {{proposed}} lightweight, reusable thermal-insulation blanket {{has been}} designed for application to a tank containing liquid oxygen, {{in place of a}} non-reusable spray-on insulating <b>foam.</b> The <b>blanket</b> would be of the multilayer-insulation (MLI) type and equipped with a pressure-regulated nitrogen purge system. The blanket would contain 16 layers in two 8 -layer sub-blankets. Double-aluminized polyimide 0. 3 mil (. 0. 008 mm) thick was selected as a reflective shield material because of its compatibility with oxygen and its ability to withstand ionizing radiation and high temperature. The inner and outer sub-blanket layers, 1 mil (approximately equals 0. 025 mm) and 3 mils (approximately equals 0. 076 mm) thick, respectively, would be made of the double-aluminized polyimide reinforced with aramid. The inner and outer layers would provide structural support for the more fragile layers between them and would bear the insulation-to-tank attachment loads. The layers would be spaced apart by lightweight, low-thermal-conductance netting made from polyethylene terephthalate...|$|R

2500|$|Aqueous {{film-forming}} foam (AFFF), used on A and B {{fires and}} for vapor suppression. The {{most common type}} in portable foam extinguishers. [...] AFFF {{was developed in the}} 1960s under Project Light Water in a joint venture between 3M and the U.S. Navy. AFFF forms a film that floats out before the <b>foam</b> <b>blanket,</b> sealing the surface and smothering the fire by excluding oxygen. AFFF is widely used for ARFF firefighting at airports, often as a twin agent unit (TAU) with purple-K dry chemical.It contains fluoro-tensides [...] which can be accumulated in the human body. The long-term effects of this on the human body and environment are unclear at this time. AFFF can be discharged through an air-aspirating branchpipe nozzle or a spray nozzle, and is now produced only in pre-mix form, where the foam concentrate is stored mixed with water. In the past, as solid charge model was produced, where the AFFF concentrate was housed as a dry compound in an external, disposable cartridge in a specially designed nozzle. The extinguisher body was charged with plain water, and the discharge pressure mixed the foam concentrate with the water upon squeezing the lever. These extinguishers received double the rating of a pre-mix model (40-B instead of 20-B), but are now considered obsolete, as parts and refill cartridges have been discontinued by the manufacturer.|$|E
40|$|Efficient {{methods for}} characterizing thermal {{performance}} of materials under cryogenic and vacuum conditions have been developed.

Test articles include solids, <b>foams,</b> powders, layered <b>blankets,</b> composite panels, and other materials. Test methodology and apparatus design for several insulation test cryostats are discussed. The measurement principle is liquid nitrogen boil-off calorimetry. Heat flux capability ranges from approximately 0. 5 to 500 watts per square meter; corresponding apparent thermal conductivity values range from below 0. 01 up to about 60 mW/m- K. Example data for different insulation materials are also presented.

The Torch has the ability to control ambient heat energy in his immediate environment, which allows him to control flames not of his own generation, makes him immune to the effects of external heat and to absorb heat from other sources. The Torch's flame can be extinguished by lack of oxygen, or by smothering materials such as water, sand, fire-fighting <b>foam,</b> or heat-resistant <b>blankets</b> unless his flame is at such intensity that it immediately vaporizes such materials on contact.|$|R

50|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, National Foam, Inc. invented Alcohol-Resistant AFFF technology. AR-AFFF is a {{synthetic}} foam developed for both hydrocarbon and polar-solvent materials.

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{compares the}} sealability performance of recently developed three synthetic foam formulations (that {{do not contain}} fluorosurfactants or fluoropolymers) with that of an {{aqueous film forming foam}} (AFFF). We apply the sealability methodology outlined in the Australian Defence Force Specification, DEF(AUST) 5706. This methodology specifies a 0. 28 m 2 small-scale indoor fire pan. The pan is first filled with 10 L of water and then 5 L of AVGAS (aviation gasoline, flash point of - 50 °C) or heptane (flash point of - 4 °C) is placed on top of the water. Foams were generated from a pressurised extinguisher with a foam nozzle as described in the standard's specification, set to create foams with expansion of 4 : 1. The foam spread across the fuel until the entire fuel surface was covered with foam. At 5 min intervals, a lit taper was introduced into the space above the pan area by passing it twice around the surface of the foam in a circular motion at a height of approximately 15 mm {{from the surface of the}} foam. The results demonstrate differences in the sealability performance between AFFF and fluorine-free foams (FfreeF). Under laboratory conditions, with a <b>foam</b> <b>blanket</b> 1 - 2 cm deep, best-performing FfreeF formulation (RF 6) provides about 30 % of the durability of an AFFF for protection against evaporation of low-flashpoint flammable liquids. We also note in the results the significant differences among FfreeF with almost no sealability of AVGAS vapours offered by the two other formulations...|$|E
40|$|The {{rescue service}} in Luleå took an {{initiative}} in 2014 and completed a try-out with CAF-system and A-foam against a liquid fire of kerosene. The {{use of the}} CAF system against liquid fires is in great interest because increased use of A-foam could lower the use of film-forming foams that contain harmful fluorinated substances. This would lead to positive effects on the environment. The try-out in 2014 was successful and indicated that CAF-system with A-foam was a good extinguisher. Luleå rescue service began planning more large-scale try-outs, this time against gasoline fires and this study {{is part of that}} project. The aim of this study has been {{to get an idea of}} the extinguishing capacity of CAF-system and A-Foam. A literature search showed that no tests similar to those envisaged in this project were documented. The empirical study consisted of 12 small- and 2 large-scale experiments. The liquid that were used in the experiment were gasoline. The small-scale experiment followed the SP-Method 2580 and the large-scale experiment where conducted in a 60 m 2 large pit. A summary of the small-scale experiment shows that no control over the fire was obtained when the foam was applied by a direct deposition technique. The foam strikes in to the fuel too hard and the blanket of foam broke down faster than new foam was applied. It required a soft deposition technique to control the fire at the small-scale experiment. The first large-scale experiment failed when no correct foam quality was obtained during the try-out. The second try-out started with the use of a traditionally CAF nozzle, which produces wet heavy foam, and no control of the fire was obtained. The foam equipment had to be changed to a medium expansion nozzle before the fire could be controlled. With the medium expansion nozzle the fire was extinguished in about 5 minutes. More expanded foam, which results in smoother application, was needed to control the fire at the large-scale experiment. The application technique is important when extinguishing fires with CAF-system and A-foam. During both the small-scale experiment as well as the large-scale experiment re-ignition attempts were conducted. These re-ignition attempts indicated that A-foam has poor fire resistance. The <b>foam</b> <b>blanket</b> quickly broke down and the fire developed to full power again shortly after being exposed to an open flame. The conclusion of the study is that a CAF system and A-foam is capable of extinguish a petrol fire of about 60 m 2 with a medium expansion nozzle and an application rate of about 2. 8 l / (m 2 ∙ min).
