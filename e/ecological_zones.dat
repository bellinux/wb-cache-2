5|$|The {{ability to}} plan and strategize, much like {{abstract}} thinking, {{can be seen in}} the more diversified toolkit of the Middle Stone Age, as well as in the subsistence patterns of the period. As MSA hominins began to migrate into a range of different <b>ecological</b> <b>zones,</b> it became necessary to base hunting strategies around seasonally available resources. Awareness of seasonality is evident in the faunal remains found at temporary sites. In less forgiving <b>ecological</b> <b>zones,</b> this awareness would have been essential for survival and the {{ability to plan}} subsistence strategies based on this awareness demonstrates an ability to think beyond the present tense and act upon this knowledge.|$|E
5|$|As early Homo sapiens {{began to}} diversify the <b>ecological</b> <b>zones</b> that they {{inhabited}} during the MSA, {{the archaeological record}} associated with these zones begins to show evidence for regional continuities. These continuities are significant {{for a number of}} reasons. The expansion of Homo sapiens into various <b>ecological</b> <b>zones</b> demonstrates an ability to adapt to a variety of environmental contexts including marine environments, savanna grasslands, relatively arid deserts, and forests. This adaptability is reflected in MSA artifacts found in these zones. These artifacts display stylistic variability depending on zone. During the Acheulian, which spanned from 1.5 million years ago to 300 thousand years ago, lithic technology displayed incredible homogeneity throughout all ecological niches. MSA technologies, with their evidence for regional variability and continuity, represent a remarkable advance. These data have been used to support theories of social and stylistic development throughout the MSA.|$|E

Chagas exists in two different <b>ecological</b> <b>zones.</b> In the Southern Cone region, the main vector lives in and around human homes. In Central America and Mexico, the main vector species lives both inside dwellings and in uninhabited areas. In both zones, Chagas occurs almost exclusively in rural areas, where triatomines breed and feed on the more than 150 species from 24 families of domestic and wild mammals, as well as humans, that are the natural reservoirs of T. cruzi.|$|E

5|$|Great Oasis sites {{appeared}} in the Missouri River drainage, and have attributes of both Late Woodland and Late Prehistoric cultures. Great Oasis cultures extended through the eastern Plains from Iowa to South Dakota. Developing independently from the eastern Mississippian cultures, Great Oasis sites display large sites along major stream terraces, increased reliance on agriculture combined with hunting and gathering, substantial pit earth lodges, and a transition from Late Woodland to Late Prehistoric ceramic forms. Overall, Great Oasis {{appears to have been}} a regional adaptation of new forms of farming and settlement patterns, including seasonal occupation of different <b>ecological</b> <b>zones,</b> that includes aspects of Late Woodland and the subsequent Middle Missouri Tradition.|$|E
5|$|Grand Teton National Park and the {{surrounding}} region host over 1,000 species of vascular plants. With an altitude variance of over , the park {{has a number of}} different <b>ecological</b> <b>zones</b> including alpine tundra, the Rocky Mountains subalpine zone where spruce-fir forests are dominant, and the valley floor, where a mixed conifer and deciduous forest zone occupies regions with better soils intermixed with sagebrush plains atop alluvial deposits. Additionally, wetlands near some lakes and in the valley floor adjacent to rivers and streams cover large expanses, especially along the Snake River near Oxbow Bend near Moran and Willow Flats near the Jackson Lake Lodge. Altitude, available soils, wildfire incidence, avalanches and human activities have a direct impact on the types of plant species in an immediate area. Where these various niches overlap is known as an ecotone.|$|E
5|$|The {{remaining}} <b>ecological</b> <b>zones,</b> {{with their}} progression from shoreline to climax forest, are a classic {{illustration of the}} concept of ecological succession. Much of this progression is due to the changing nature of Presque Isle and its shifting shoreline and dunes. The shoreline, the second zone, is formed by wave action and is in equilibrium between erosion and deposition, with the initial plants stabilizing the sand of the new shoreline. The newly formed sandy plain and the ponds formed in it are the third zone. The ponds start as trapped pockets of lake water and can erode away or be filled by wind-blown sand or drifting dunes. The new ponds provide habitat for plants and animals: for example, the state park is home to 89 species of Odonata (dragonflies and damselflies) and Lepidoptera, including 35 different butterflies, as well as 84 different sorts of spiders.|$|E

These wells were closed and new ones dug in Xochimilco and other southern boroughs. High rates of extraction have had the same effect on water tables and canals began to dry. [...] Since then reclaimed wastewater has been recycled to flow into the Xochimilco canals to supplement water from natural sources. However, this water is not potable, containing bacteria and heavy metals and the canals still receive untreated wastewater and other pollution [...] Another major problem, especially {{in the past two decades}} has been the population explosion of Mexico City, pushing urban sprawl further south into formerly rural areas of the Federal District. This prompted authorities to seek World Heritage Site status for the canals and the pre-Hispanic chinampa fields to provide them more environmental protection. This was granted in 1987, but these same major environmental problems still exist. A 2006 study by UNESCO and Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana has shown that there are still very high levels of pollution (both garbage and fecal matter) in the canals and there still a rapid rate of deterioration 2,000 hectares of protected area.

Not all were Adventists; early members included the Independent Baptist Henry M. Morris and the Missouri Lutheran Walter E. Lammerts. The DGS undertook field-work: in June 1941 their first Bulletin hailed the news that the Paluxy River dinosaur trackways appeared to include human footprints. Though Nelson had advised Price in 1939 that this was [...] "absurd" [...] and that the difficulty of human footprints forming during the turmoil of the deluge would [...] "knock the Flood theory all to pieces", in 1943 the DGS began raising funds for [...] "actual excavation" [...] by a Footprint Research Committee of members including the consulting geologist Clifford L. Burdick. Initially they tried to keep research secret from [...] "unfriendly scientists". Then in 1945, to encourage backing, they announced giant human footprints, [...] "at a single stroke" [...] defeating the theory of evolution. The revelation that footprints had been carved and an unsuccessful field trip that year failed to dampen their hopes. However, by then the DGS was riven by doctrinal arguments. The most extreme dispute began in late 1938 after Harold W. Clark observed deep drilling in oil fields and had discussions with practical geologists which dispelled the belief that the fossil sequence was random, convincing him that the evidence of thrust faults was [...] "almost incontrovertible". He wrote to Price, telling his teacher that the [...] "rocks do lie in a much more definite sequence than we have ever allowed", and proposing that the fossil sequence was explained by <b>ecological</b> <b>zones</b> before the flood.

Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to evaluate the model's predictive performance. The model allows reasonable discrimination between high and low prevalence schools, at least within those geographical areas in which they were originally developed, and performs reasonably well in other coastal areas, but performs poorly by comparison in the Great Lakes area of Tanzania. These results may be explained by reference to an <b>ecological</b> <b>zone</b> map based on RS-derived environmental data.
