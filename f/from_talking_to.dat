25|$|Siddiqui's son Ahmed was {{released}} from Afghanistan to his aunt in Pakistan following enormous outcry from the Pakistani public and politicians. While Pakistani law would normally give his father custody, his father {{did not want to}} fight the passionate public opinion supporting his aunt Fawzia. He now lives with his aunt in Karachi, who has prohibited him <b>from</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> the press. In April 2010, Pakistan Interior Minister Rehman Malik claimed a 12-year-old girl found outside a house in Karachi was identified by DNA as Siddiqui's daughter, Mariyam, and that she had been returned to her family. Their father and his parents have not been allowed to see either child.|$|E
25|$|In 1854, the Scottish {{explorer}} Dr. John Rae, while {{surveying the}} Boothia Peninsula for the Hudson's Bay Company, discovered the true {{fate of the}} Franklin party <b>from</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> Inuit hunters. He was told both ships had become icebound, the men had tried to reach safety on foot but had succumbed to cold and some had resorted to cannibalism. Rae's report to the Admiralty was leaked to the press, which led to widespread revulsion in Victorian society, enraged Franklin's widow and condemned Rae to ignominy. Lady Franklin's efforts to eulogise her husband, {{with support from the}} British Establishment, led to a further 25searches over the next four decades, none of which would add any further information of note.|$|E
25|$|Eugenia {{is talking}} and flirting with Robert Acton; {{she says she}} will divorce her husband. She visits Mrs Acton and says a white lie – that her son {{has been talking about}} her a lot – which comes across as a terrible faux-pas. Later, Mr Wentworth tells Felix that Clifford got {{suspended}} from Harvard owing to his drinking problem, and that he is improperly in love with Lizzie Acton – Felix suggests fixing him up with Eugenia instead. Later still, Gertrude tells him her father wants her to marry Mr Brand, though she doesn't love him. Mr Brand then criticises Felix. Gertrude emotionally blackmails Charlotte into keeping him <b>from</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> her, lest she tell him Charlotte likes him. Clifford then visits Eugenia. Robert Acton goes to the Wentworths' but Eugenia is not in their house; he goes into hers and asks her about the divorce note and going to see the Niagara Falls with him. Clifford comes out of his hiding place; the two men get back together.|$|E

500|$|After the {{departure}} of Duchovny, the show garnered much criticism by fans and critics alike, with many saying that the bond between Mulder and Scully was what actually kept the show {{together for the first}} seven seasons of the show. Realizing his importance in the series, Chris Carter and his crew opened negotiations with Duchovny in the hopes that he would reprise his character for the finale. Initially, they were unsure if he would appear, but he eventually elected to return. Spotnitz said, [...] "My impression <b>from</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> him was that he still cares about the show. He's still invested in it and certainly cares about [...] And I think he recognized that {{it was the best thing}} for the show and the audience [...] to come back and give closure to nine years of the series." [...] Not only did Duchovny return for the finale, he also returned to write and direct the episode [...] "William"; he even had a small cameo in the episode, appearing as a reflection in Scully's eye. Three episodes later, Duchovny returned as an actor for the season finale, [...] "The Truth".|$|E
500|$|From laps 81 to 90, pit stops {{were made}} by all the drivers. After Ed Carpenter's stop, one of his wheels came off while he {{attempted}} {{to return to the}} track; he would ultimately finish 15th, eight laps behind. At the end of this series of pit stops under the green flag, Wheldon remained out in front, ahead of Kanaan. By the halfway point of the race, Kanaan had begun to narrow his deficit, which by lap 115 was less than a second. Wheldon, meanwhile, was faced with a mechinical problem—his radio was malfunctioning, preventing him <b>from</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> his pit crew; he later said that he and his team [...] "lost radio contact early on". On lap 122, Kanaan made a pass while coming out of turn two, taking the lead from Wheldon. Soon after, the drivers began their third round of pit stops, and Wheldon took back the lead before Andretti was afflicted with oversteer and crashed into the turn four inside wall on lap 135, bringing out a caution flag. The yellow flag period saw pit stops continue. Castroneves stopped twice on pit lane on top of a prior stop just before the caution; during the second yellow flag stop, he overshot his designated area on pit road, and his car needed to be pushed into position by crew members. With 51 laps left, the caution period ended, and Wheldon slowly built a gap over Kanaan of 1.8834 seconds entering the final 20 laps.|$|E
500|$|Eight {{months after}} No Line on the Horizons release, Bono {{said he was}} {{disappointed}} with the album's sales. Regarding the lack of commercial appeal, Bono said, [...] "We weren't really in that mindset. We felt that the 'album' is almost an extinct species, and we [...] create a mood and feeling, and a beginning, middle and an end. And I suppose we've made a work that is a bit challenging {{for people who have}} grown up on a diet of pop stars." [...] Clayton agreed that the album's commercial reception must be [...] "challenged" [...] but said, [...] "the more interesting challenge is, 'What is rock 'n' roll in this changing world?' Because, to some extent, the concept of the music fan—the concept of the person who buys music and listens to music for the pleasure of music itself—is an outdated idea." [...] The Edge predicted that, despite its lack of a big hit, No Line on the Horizon would grow on listeners over time. He noted that the reaction to the songs in the live setting made U2 believe that the material was connecting with the fans, adding, [...] "There's a lot of records that make great first impressions. There might be one song that gets to be big on the radio, but they're not albums that people... play a lot. This is one that I gather <b>from</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> people.... Four months later, they're saying, 'I'm really getting into the album now. McGuinness believed that the conditions of the music market were more responsible for the low sales than any decline in U2's popularity.|$|E

2500|$|Papen {{was able}} to exclude Rintelen <b>from</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> Huerta, but unknown to him, he was being {{monitored}} by the British, who hired a Czech electrician to hide a microphone {{in the hotel room}} that Huerta was staying at, allowing them to listen in to all their talks. Papen bought 8,000 rounds of ammunition in St. Louis for the Huertista émigrés and had $800,000 deposited in the Deutsche Bank branch in Havana in an account that Papen had opened up in Huerta's name. [...] Additionally, Papen planned in February–March 1915 to send a New Orleans man named Petersdorf to blow up the oil fields in Tampico, Mexico owned by British oil companies, though the plan was vetoed by the German Navy, which had been able to buy Mexican oil via the Standard Oil company, and felt that a sabotage campaign against Mexican oil fields would strain relations with Mexico too much.|$|E

2500|$|On August 13, 2008, Hunter's sister, Roxanne Druck Marshall, {{participated in}} an {{interview}} with CBS, in which she personally apologized to John Edwards' wife for her sister's behavior.

Marshall also stated that, {{in the days after the}} story broke, Edwards provided Hunter and her baby with a new and secret domicile to prevent media reporters from finding her.
