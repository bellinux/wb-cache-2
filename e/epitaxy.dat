5|$|Large single {{crystals}} (many cubic centimeters) can {{be grown}} by the gas transport (vapor-phase deposition), hydrothermal synthesis, or melt growth. However, because of high vapor pressure of ZnO, growth from the melt is problematic. Growth by gas transport is difficult to control, leaving the hydrothermal method as a preference. Thin films can be produced by chemical vapor deposition, metalorganic vapour phase <b>epitaxy,</b> electrodeposition, pulsed laser deposition, sputtering, sol-gel synthesis, atomic layer deposition, spray pyrolysis, etc.|$|E
5|$|Organotellurium {{compounds}} such as dimethyl telluride, diethyl telluride, diisopropyl telluride, diallyl telluride and methyl allyl telluride are {{precursors for}} synthesizing metalorganic vapor phase <b>epitaxy</b> growth of II-VI compound semiconductors.

The greatest purity metalorganics of both selenium and tellurium are used in these processes. The compounds for semiconductor industry and are prepared by adduct purification.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1960s liquid phase <b>epitaxy</b> (LPE) {{was invented by}} Herbert Nelson of RCA Laboratories. By {{layering}} the highest quality crystals of varying compositions, it enabled the demonstration {{of the highest quality}} heterojunction semiconductor laser materials for many years. LPE was adopted by all the leading laboratories, worldwide and used for many years. It was finally supplanted in the 1970s by molecular beam <b>epitaxy</b> and organometallic chemical vapor deposition.|$|E

25|$|Molecular Beam <b>Epitaxy</b> {{allows for}} bottom up {{assemblies}} of materials, most notably semiconductor materials {{commonly used in}} chip and computing applications, stacks, gating, and nanowire lasers.|$|E
25|$|Another {{example is}} {{gadolinium}} gallium garnet, 32(GaO4)3 which is synthesized {{for use as}} a substrate for liquid-phase <b>epitaxy</b> of magnetic garnet films for bubble memory and magneto-optical applications.|$|E
25|$|Two {{commonly}} used HBTs are silicon–germanium and aluminum gallium arsenide, though {{a wide variety}} of semiconductors may be used for the HBT structure. HBT structures are usually grown by <b>epitaxy</b> techniques like MOCVD and MBE.|$|E
25|$|In PLD, a large {{supersaturation}} {{occurs on}} the substrate during the pulse duration. The pulse lasts around 10–40 microseconds {{depending on the}} laser parameters. This high supersaturation causes a very large nucleation density on the surface as compared to molecular beam <b>epitaxy</b> or sputtering deposition. This nucleation density increases the smoothness of the deposited film.|$|E
25|$|Band-gap {{engineering}} {{is the process}} of controlling or altering the band gap of a material by controlling the composition of certain semiconductor alloys, such as GaAlAs, InGaAs, and InAlAs. It is also possible to construct layered materials with alternating compositions by techniques like molecular-beam <b>epitaxy.</b> These methods are exploited in the design of heterojunction bipolar transistors (HBTs), laser diodes and solar cells.|$|E
25|$|The first diode lasers were {{homojunction}} diodes. That is, {{the material}} (and thus the bandgap) of the waveguide core layer {{and that of}} the surrounding clad layers, were identical. It was recognized that there was an opportunity, particularly afforded by the use of liquid phase <b>epitaxy</b> using aluminum gallium arsenide, to introduce heterojunctions. Heterostructures consist of layers of semiconductor crystal having varying bandgap and refractive index. Heterojunctions (formed from heterostructures) had been recognized by Herbert Kroemer, while working at RCA Laboratories in the mid-1950s, as having unique advantages for several types of electronic and optoelectronic devices including diode lasers. LPE afforded the technology of making heterojunction diode lasers.|$|E
25|$|Multi-junction cells {{consist of}} {{multiple}} thin films, each essentially a solar cell grown {{on top of}} another, typically using metalorganic vapour phase <b>epitaxy.</b> Each layer has a different band gap energy {{to allow it to}} absorb electromagnetic radiation over a different portion of the spectrum. Multi-junction cells were originally developed for special applications such as satellites and space exploration, but are now used increasingly in terrestrial concentrator photovoltaics (CPV), an emerging technology that uses lenses and curved mirrors to concentrate sunlight onto small, highly efficient multi-junction solar cells. By concentrating sunlight up to a thousand times, High concentrated photovoltaics (HCPV) has the potential to outcompete conventional solar PV in the future.|$|E
25|$|Pulsed laser {{deposition}} is {{only one}} of many thin film deposition techniques. Other methods include molecular beam <b>epitaxy</b> (MBE), chemical vapor deposition (CVD), sputter deposition (RF, magnetron, and ion beam). The history of laser-assisted film growth started soon after the technical realization of the first laser in 1960 by Maiman. Smith and Turner utilized a ruby laser to deposit the first thin films in 1965, three years after Breech and Cross studied the laser-vaporization and excitation of atoms from solid surfaces. However, the deposited films were still inferior to those obtained by other techniques such as chemical vapor deposition and molecular beam <b>epitaxy.</b> In the early 1980s, a few research groups (mainly in the former USSR) achieved remarkable results on manufacturing of thin film structures utilizing laser technology. The breakthrough came in 1987 when Dijkkamp, Xindi Wu and Venkatesan were able to laser deposit a thin film of YBa2Cu3O7, a high temperature superconductive material, which was of superior quality to that of films deposited with alternative techniques. Since then, the technique of pulsed laser deposition has been utilized to fabricate high quality crystalline films, such as doped garnet thin films for use as planar waveguide lasers. The deposition of ceramic oxides, nitride films, metallic multilayers and various superlattices has been demonstrated. In the 1990s the development of new laser technology, such as lasers with high repetition rate and short pulse durations, made PLD a very competitive tool for the growth of thin, well defined films with complex stoichiometry.|$|E
25|$|In contrast, {{bottom-up}} techniques build or {{grow larger}} structures atom by atom or molecule by molecule. These techniques include chemical synthesis, self-assembly and positional assembly. Dual polarisation interferometry is one tool suitable for characterisation of self assembled thin films. Another {{variation of the}} bottom-up approach is molecular beam <b>epitaxy</b> or MBE. Researchers at Bell Telephone Laboratories like John R. Arthur. Alfred Y. Cho, and Art C. Gossard developed and implemented MBE as a research tool in the late 1960s and 1970s. Samples made by MBE were key {{to the discovery of}} the fractional quantum Hall effect for which the 1998 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded. MBE allows scientists to lay down atomically precise layers of atoms and, in the process, build up complex structures. Important for research on semiconductors, MBE is also widely used to make samples and devices for the newly emerging field of spintronics.|$|E
