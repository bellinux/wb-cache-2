5000|$|Purpose {{designed}} manual spade based lawn edgers are a half moon shaped, semicircular, broad blade {{attached to}} an elongated handle {{and are used}} in a downwards and rocking motion. [...] The blade may have a flat top to allow the operator {{to step on the}} blade to apply more force. The blade is driven through the lawn and into the lawn substrate parallel to and adjacent to the hard boundary feature bordering the lawn, cutting any protruding lawn material. This type of lawn edger is also known as an <b>edging</b> <b>iron.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{adsorption}} of methanol (CH 3 OH) at the Fe 3 O 4 (001) -c(2 x 2) {{surface was}} studied using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), {{scanning tunneling microscopy}} (STM), and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD). CH 3 OH adsorbs exclusively at surface defects sites at room temperature to form hydroxyl groups and methoxy (CH 3 O) species. Active sites are identified as step <b>edges,</b> <b>iron</b> adatoms, antiphase domain boundaries in the c(2 x 2) reconstruction, and above Fe atoms incorporated in the subsurface. In TPD, recombinative desorption is observed around 300 K, and a disproportionation reaction to form methanol and formaldehyde occurs at 470 K. Comment: 7 figure...|$|R

40|$|Model {{atmosphere}} {{calculations of}} the spectrum of a neutron star cooling after an X-ray burst show that the photoelectric <b>edge</b> of <b>iron</b> should be prominent. No clear evidence for such a redshifted feature in the spectrum of a burst from X 1636 - 53 is found, and it is concluded that the iron abundance there must be less than 0. 3 solar. Unless the iron abundance of the surface matter on the neutron star is highly time-dependent, the present result argues against the 4. 1 -keV absorption line seen in some bursts from X 1636 - 53 by Waki et al. (1984) being due to <b>iron.</b> The <b>iron</b> <b>edge</b> will be a powerful diagnostic of the surface redshift of the neutron star in burst sources where the iron abundance is more nearly solar...|$|R

50|$|The Pegram truss is {{a hybrid}} between the Warren and Parker trusses where the upper chords {{are all of}} equal length and the lower chords are longer than the {{corresponding}} upper chord. Because {{of the difference in}} upper and lower chord length, each panel is not square. The members which would be vertical in a Parker truss vary from near vertical {{in the center of the}} span to diagonal near each end (like a Warren truss). George H. Pegram, while the chief engineer of <b>Edge</b> Moor <b>Iron</b> Company in Wilmington, Delaware, patented this truss design in 1885.|$|R

50|$|The new engines {{were too}} heavy to run on wooden rails or plate-way, and <b>iron</b> <b>edge</b> rails were in their infancy, with cast iron exhibiting {{excessive}} brittleness. Together with William Losh, Stephenson improved the design of cast <b>iron</b> <b>edge</b> rails to reduce breakage; rails were briefly made by Losh, Wilson and Bell at their Walker ironworks. According to Rolt, Stephenson managed {{to solve the problem}} caused by the weight of the engine on the primitive rails. He experimented with a steam spring (to 'cushion' the weight using steam pressure acting on pistons to support the locomotive frame), but soon followed the practice of 'distributing' weight by utilising a number of wheels or bogies. For the Stockton and Darlington Railway Stephenson used wrought iron malleable rails that he had found satisfactory, not withstanding the financial loss he suffered by not using his own patented design.|$|R

The oil prevented much sound being made, but to deaden it still further they wrapped a handkerchief over the file. The bars had been but a short time in position and the iron was new and strong. It was consequently some hours before they completed their work. When they had done, the grating was left in the position it before occupied, the cuts being concealed from any but close observation by kneading up small pieces of bread and pressing them into them, and then rubbing the <b>edges</b> with <b>iron</b> filings.|$|R

A verandah, which is topped by a porch with a balustrade, runs along {{the front of the}} house. The low hip roof features a cornice with paired brackets along its <b>edge.</b> Cast <b>iron</b> lintels cover the house's tall, narrow arched windows.

The swords pass from bronze to iron with bronze hilts, and, finally, are wholly of iron. Weapons of bronze are fitted with <b>iron</b> <b>edges.</b> Axes of <b>iron</b> were much more common than axes of bronze. [Footnote: Early Age of Greece, i. 413-416.] The axes were fashioned in the old shapes of the age of bronze, were not of the bipennis Mycenaean model--the double axe--nor of the shape of the letter D, very thick, with two round apertures in the blade, like the bronze axe of Vaphio. [Footnote: Monro, Odyssey, vol. ii. 176.] Probably the axes through which Odysseus shot an arrow were of this kind, as Mr. Monro, and, much earlier, Mr. Butcher and I have argued. [Footnote: Ibid.
