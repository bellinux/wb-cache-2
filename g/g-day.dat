5000|$|With {{the final}} <b>G-Day</b> {{determination}} not yet made, allied attack helicopter feints and artillery raids kept the Iraqis guessing about operations {{over the next}} several days. Iron Soldiers used time available in FAA Garcia to continue pre-combat preparations, conduct rehearsals, and rest.

It started {{as a part of the}} G-Africa Initiative that was expanded to Latin America countries in 2012. These events typically lasted for two days, split into the developer day (for developers and technology enthusiasts) and the business day (for entrepreneurs) with the aim of showing them how to leverage Google tools in taking advantage of the opportunities offered by the Internet and mobile.|$|E
50|$|Following {{completion}} of a phased maintenance availability in January 1990, New Orleans sailed the Western Pacific, Indian Ocean, and Persian Gulf in support of Operations Desert Storm, Desert Saber and Desert Shield from 1 December 1990 to 28 August 1991. She served {{as a member of}} CTG-36/CTF-156, the largest amphibious task force to deploy from the West Coast of the United States in 25 years. Significant accomplishments included the off-load of 1,700 Marine combat troops on <b>G-Day</b> and aviation mine countermeasures in the North Persian Gulf, ten nautical miles (19 km) off the coast of Kuwait.|$|E
50|$|After {{completing}} pre-combat training, {{inspections and}} preparations in TAA Thompson, {{home for the}} last six weeks, the division began a 150-kilometer westward move to FAA Garcia. The division was working under the planning assumption that <b>G-Day</b> (the anticipated start of the allied ground offensive) would be on or about Feb. 21. Shifting the division west was expected to accomplish three things: reposition the division to its eventual attack sector, contribute to the theaterwide deception plan designed to fix Iraqi forces in Kuwait, and to rehearse division, brigade and battalion battle formations as well as command and control procedures over a distance similar to the plan of attack.|$|E
50|$|More than 3,600 Tennessee Guardsmen {{responded to}} Operations Desert Shield and Storm. The 196th Field Artillery Brigade (including the 1st Battalion, 181st Field Artillery) {{was one of}} only two Army Guard combat units to see actual combat. The Tennessee Army {{deployed}} 17 units during the conflict. A few days prior to <b>G-Day,</b> Tennessee’s 212th Engineer Company, attached to the 101st Airborne Division, broke through the border berm into enemy territory, building a six-lane road. The unit traversed six miles before the ground war began, becoming the first unit of the 101st into Iraq {{and one of the first}} U.S. units to breach the Iraqi defensive zones.|$|E
5000|$|... 3rd Battalion, 23rd Marines was {{activated}} in Nov 1990 and {{deployed to}} Saudi Arabia for Desert Shield. 3/23 {{was attached to}} the 8th Marine Regiment of the 2nd Marine Division and deployed along the Kuwaiti/Saudi Arabian border conducting patrolling and security operations. Two days before <b>G-Day,</b> 3/23 attacked into Kuwait at Umm Gudair to secure forward artillery positions for the support of the attack into Kuwait. With this action, 3/23 became the first unit of the 2nd Marine Division to enter combat since World War II. 3/23 continued to advance as part of 8th Marines, fighting actions into Kuwait City when the ceasefire was called.|$|E
50|$|On <b>G-Day,</b> 24 February 1991, the Black Jack Brigade {{conducted}} Operation Deep Strike. As the VII and XVIII Corps {{were beginning}} to mount the main invasion of Iraq to their far west, the Black Jack Brigade pressed into Iraq once more through the Wadi al-Batin and feinted as though they led the main invasion force. The brigade fought throughout the night and following day, fixing four Iraqi divisions and allowing the main invasion force to envelop the enemy from their west flank. With its mission an unqualified success, the Black Jack Brigade withdrew back through the Wadi al-Batin and united with the VII Corps’ assaulting force to pursue and destroy the Iraqi Republican Guard in the Basra Region.|$|E
5000|$|... 3rd Battalion, 23rd Marines was {{activated}} in Nov 1990 and {{deployed to}} Saudi Arabia for Desert Shield. 3/23 was commanded by LtCol Ray Dawson, of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, {{and attached to}} the 8th Marine Regiment of the 2nd Marine Division and deployed along the Kuwait/Saudi Arabian border conducting patrolling and security operations. 2 days before <b>G-Day,</b> 3/23 attacked into Kuwait at Umm Gudair to secure forward artillery positions {{for the support of}} the attack into Kuwait. With this action, 3/23 became the first unit of the 2nd Marine Division to enter combat since World War II. 3/23 continued to advance as part of 8th Marines, fighting actions into Kuwait City when the ceasefire was called.|$|E
5000|$|... 3d Battalion, 23d Marines was {{assigned}} the <b>G-Day</b> missions of (1) providing {{security in the}} division zone forward of the Saudi defensive berm, which was located on the Saudi-Kuwait border, prior to G-Day; (2) passing through the breach lanes, and: (3) clearing its zone of action to support the attack north, and (4) screening to the northeast {{in order to allow}} 3d Battalion, 10th Marines (3/10) to establish artillery firing positions to provide preparation fires for offensive operations. Phase One was the conduct of the route reconnaissance by TOWs, heavy machine guns (HMG), combat engineers, snipers, and artillery reconnaissance assets. Phase Two was the introduction of one motorized infantry company, the battalion command element, and the 81 mm mortar platoon in the forward sector. The motorized company would be placed in a blocking position oriented northwest, facing possible Iraqi units being flushed out by 2nd LAR screening to the northwest. The teams were tasked to position themselves between the Iraqi defenses and friendly artillery to screen the Iraqi forward defensive belt, and orient to the northeast. Phase Three would be the movement of the artillery units to their firing positions on 23 February 1991, G-1, under the cover of darkness.|$|E
50|$|As the war progressed {{into the}} {{offensive}} stage, the 1st Cavalry Division’s mission changed {{in order to}} support the impending invasion of Iraq. In mid-February 1991, prior to the ground invasion of Iraq, the division fought the Battle of Ruqi Pocket, a critical feint designed to make the enemy believe that the main coalition ground attack would occur at the Wadi al-Batin region of the Iraq-Saudi border. On 15 February 1991, the Black Jack Brigade participated in Operation Berm Buster, where they breached the defensive berm between Saudi Arabia and Iraq to feign the initial stages of a ground invasion. Later that night, the Black Jack Brigade participated in Operation Red Storm, an artillery and aviation barrage of Iraqi border targets designed to suggest that the area was being prepped for assault. On 19 February, the 2nd Brigade’s Task Force 1-5 Cav conducted Operation Knight Strike, a reconnaissance in force through the Wadi al-Batin, becoming the first coalition unit to enter Iraq. The task force suffered 12 casualties, but successfully accomplished its mission of simulating the reconnaissance efforts for an impending invasion. The feints at the Wadi al-Batin allowed VII Corps and XVIII Airborne Corps to stage themselves to the far west in preparation for the actual invasion on <b>G-Day,</b> 24 February 1991. It also tied up four Iraqi divisions in the Wadi al-Batin region, where the Iraqis were now convinced that the main attack would occur.|$|E
50|$|On 22 February 1991 (<b>G-Day</b> minus two), 3/23 {{commenced}} {{combat operations}} as bulldozers cut three {{gaps in the}} Saudi berm to allow 3/23 and 3/10 to execute their missions. Approximately halfway through Phase One, the 8th Marines further tasked 3/23 to provide a Forward Air Controller close to the Iraqi defenses to control an air strike on a pumping station in the Umm Gudair oil field, which had been determined to be a high priority target. This required the 81 mm mortar element to move forward of their assigned position in order to range the target for back-up marking capability. A number of Iraqi infantry and trucks were observed {{in and around the}} Iraqi trench line. In the waning daylight of 22 February 1991, the Iraqis were engaged by the forward 3/23 81 mm mortars. Simultaneously, the 3/23 Forward Air Controller (FAC) attempted to direct close air support (CAS) onto the assigned target. However, smoke and haze from the burning oil field obscured the target from the FAC, making laser designation impossible. Company I 3/23 quickly and effectively searched and cleared a large compound located forward of the Iraqi defenses discovering that, although unoccupied, it had been recently used by Iraqi forces as a major supply cache and observation point. The compound was prepared for demolition by combat engineers, and subsequently completely destroyed. Artillery fire was requested on the Iraqi defenses and Battery F, 2/14 responded as well as organic 3/23 81 mm mortar fire. The direct fire capability of 3/23 combined with the indirect fire destroyed five BTR-60s, three BDRMS, eight tanks (T-55/T-62) and inflicted approximately 52 Iraqi KIAs. 10-20 Iraqis emerged from their trenches and made their way through their minefields to members of the 81 mm mortar platoon, 3/23 quickly mobilized enemy prisoners of war (POW) processing teams which sped the POWs to the rear. The POWs were determined to be from the Iraqi 1st Battalion, 83d Brigade, 29th Infantry Division. Ultimately, the battalion captured 238 POWs, to include an Iraqi Battalion Commander, and sustained no friendly casualties.|$|E

40|$|MBA Professional ReportThe {{purpose of}} this project {{is to provide a}} process for {{accelerated}} acquisition in support of contingency operations. The objective of the project is to recreate and document the events surrounding the fielding of FBCB 2 -BFT during Operations Enduring and Iraqi Freedom, and to produce a document that provides an analysis of actions taken, the obstacles that were overcome and the acquisition policy that applied to the situation in order to rapidly acquire, produce, train and field a useful solution to fulfill an urgent and valid operational need. In 2002, while conducting the Global War on Terror, the US Army determined that combat on an asymmetric battlefield, consisting of a complex operational environment as well as an increased geographic battlespace, required improvements to the current command and control capability available to the force. PM FBCB 2 determined their system could fulfill the need by taking the current FBCB 2 system and adjusting it to meet the new operational need. Given the constraints regarding time, funding, and technical feasibility PM FBCB 2 diligently worked with multiple organizations and agencies in order to provide a useful solution for friendly forces in Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom. In the 12 months prior to 21 March 2003 (<b>G-Day</b> Iraqi Freedom), the Army undertook an enormous effort to develop, produce, provide system training, and field FBCB 2 -BFT. The FBCB 2 -BFT initiative was successful due to the synchronization of four interrelated and supporting components; 1) a technically mature system, 2) user representative acceptance, 3) senior leadership support, and 4) a funding stream.

40|$|The Road to Safwan is a {{complete}} history of the 1 st Infantry Divisions cavalry unit fighting in Operation Desert Storm. Stephen A. Bourque and John W. Burdan III served in the 1 st Infantry [...] Bourque in Division Headquarters, Burdan as the Operations Officer of the 1 st Squadron, 4 th Cavalry. Based on extensive interviews and primary sources, Bourque and Burdan provide the most in-depth coverage to date of a battalion-level unit in the 1991 war, showing how the unit deployed, went into combat, and adapted to changing circumstances. The authors describe how the officers and men moved from the routine of cold war training to leading the Big Red One in battle through the Iraqi defenses and against the Iraqi Republican Guard. The 1 st Squadron, 4 th Cavalry participated in the 1 st Brigade attack on <b>G-Day,</b> the large tank battle for Objective Norfolk, the cutting of Basra Road, and the capture of Safwan Airfield, the site where General H. Norman Schwartzkopf conducted cease-fire negotiations with the Iraqis. The squadrons activities are placed squarely {{within the context of}} both division and corps activities, which illustrates the fog of war, the chain of command, and the uncertainty of information affecting command decisions. The Road to Safwan challenges the myth that technology won the 1991 Persian Gulf War. Contrary to popular view, it was a soldiers war not much different from previous conflicts in its general nature. What was different was the quality and intensity of the units training, which resulted, repeatedly, in successful engagements and objectives secured. It {{is the story of the}} people, not the machines, which ultimately led this squadron to the small town of Safwan. “The Road to Safwan is a magnificent story about one of the oldest and most decorated Cavalry Squadrons in the US Army. It is a most accurate description of the American soldier during the Desert Storm Operation of 1991. This work is about leadership and human emotions. One can feel the responsibility and pride of the leaders and their soldiers as the author walks you through their deployment and hard-fought battles in Iraq and Kuwait. The men of the 1 st Squadron, 4 th Cavalry were asked to accomplish a lot; they never disappointed their superiors or themselves. This group of professional soldiers lived their motto Prepared and Loyal every day. This work is a must read for both military professionals and land warfare historians. ” [...] LTG (ret) Thomas G.
