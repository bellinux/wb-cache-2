This {{action research}} investigates {{the effectiveness of}} trained peer response on ESL students’ revision types and writing quality. Eighteen female eighth graders in a Lebanese school participated in the study. Tools used to collect data included two <b>guideline</b> <b>sheets</b> to aid the participants during the editing stage, the Taxonomy of Witte and Faigley to analyze the types of revisions made after peer- revisions, an iBT / TOEFL rubric to score students’ first and second drafts in order to check if their writing has improved, and an interview {{at the end of}} the treatment to show students’ perceptions and beliefs towards peer- editing. The study lasted for two weeks and consisted of six stages which are: training and modeling, one-on-one ten- minute student teacher conference, writing the first draft, peer- editing, writing the second draft, and one-on-one interview with the students. Thus, the results of the study were triangulated and indicated that the students made more meaning changes (58 %) than surface- level changes (41 %), and that their writing quality of the second draft has improved. These findings reveal an improvement in students’ writing quality in an ESL context in favor of training in peer- editing. 1 bound copy: x, 78 leaves; 30 cm. available at RNL...|$|R

Other studies have shown some weaknesses in the medical recording systems in our country so we studied effect of attaching a standard recording <b>guidelines</b> <b>sheet</b> to patients’files as a reference for the recorder. Methods: In this study, 50 externs and 40 interns were enrolled. They were responsible for 60 patients in the general internal medicine ward of Sina hospital, University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran. This study was done during 6 months in the Sina hospital (January 2010 -August 2010). Standard medical recording guidelines were attached to the patients’ files. The externs studied off note writing, and the interns studied consultation, off note and orders writing in the first day of patient hospitalization. The quality of their medical writing was assessed before and after attaching guidelines. The students were not aware of the evaluation of their work. If the writing met less than 70 % of the standard format, it was not accepted. Result: The consultation sheet of the interns showed significant differences before and after the guidelines’ attachment in problem list writing (p= 0. 005). Other studied aspects did not have any significant difference. Affixed guidelines, therefore, could solve the problem of list recording, but did not alter other items. Conclusion: This study showed that the interns had many problems in medical recording which would not be solved with attaching a standard medical recording checklist, and we must choose other methods to correct those errors...|$|R

40|$|Elastic {{buckling}} behaviour of multi-layered {{graphene sheets}} is rigorously investigated. Van der Waals forces are modelled, to a first order approximation, as linear physical springs which connect the nodes between the layers. Critical buckling loads and their associated modes are established and analyzed under different boundary conditions, aspect ratios and compressive loading ratios {{in the case}} of graphene sheets compressed in two perpendicular directions. Various practically possible loading configurations are examined and their effect on buckling characteristics is assessed. To model more accurately the buckling behaviour of multi-layered graphene sheets, a physically more representative and realistic mixed boundary support concept is proposed and applied. For the fundamental buckling mode under mixed boundary support, the layers with different boundary supports deform similarly but non-identically, leading to resultant van der Waals bonding forces between the layers which in turn affect critical buckling load. Results are compared with existing known solutions to illustrate the excellent numerical accuracy of the proposed modelling approach.

30|$|While fire {{experiments}} were sparse, management <b>guidelines</b> and fact <b>sheets</b> on invasive plants were plentiful. These typically lacked bibliographies or in-text citations or both, {{making it impossible}} for review authors to verify the information, determine its basis, or assess its scope of inference. In some cases, publications offered fire management recommendations for species for which we found no observation-based information on fire. For example, two sources noted that creeping jenny (Lysimachia nummularia) may be controlled by frequent prescribed fire (Kennay and Fell 1992, Czarapata 2005), yet no observation-based fire information was available for this species (Table 4). Managers could find this information more useful and apply it appropriately if the sources explained the basis for their recommendations, such as the plant communities observed and the fire frequencies used in treatment. In other cases, experience-based or unverifiable information was inconsistent with observation-based information. For example, information from management guides and fact sheets on leafy spurge suggests controlling this species with prescribed fire in conjunction with herbicide treatments (Lym and Zollinger 1995, Solecki 1997, Biesboer and Eckardt 2004). However, two studies with observation-based, quantitative information found that combining prescribed fire and herbicide treatments did not improve leafy spurge control compared to herbicide treatments alone (Wolters et al. 1994, Prosser et al. 1999).|$|R

40|$|Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter (PICC) {{blockage}} {{rate was}} audited over a two month period on the Trauma & Orthopaedics ward at our District General Hospital. A 70 % (five out of seven) PICC blockage rate was observed. High blockage rates lead to potential treatment complications, delays in delivery of treatment, increase in costs, and reduction in patient satisfaction. The {{factors contributing to}} the significant blockage rate include, long and contradictory PICC care <b>guidelines,</b> no information <b>sheets</b> in the patient notes, lack of training and awareness about care of, and flushing of, PICC lines, and lack of accountability for PICC flushing. Our project aimed to achieve a greater rate of PICC patency. We produced one succinct and comprehensive PICC care guideline, carried out staff training sessions, introduced a sticker reminding staff to flush the PICC line after use, and introduced a prescription of weekly heparin saline and PRN saline flushes (for monitoring and accountability). We used questionnaires to assess competency of hospital staff pre-teaching (doctors 6 %, nurses 0 %), and post-teaching (doctors 70 %, nurses 38 %). Blockage rate data post-intervention is pending. Education improved awareness of guidelines amongst staff and we anticipate that the proposed interventions will translate into reduced blockage rates, improving patient outcomes and reducing costs. Problem We observed a high (5 out of 7 lines, 70 %) rate of PICC blockages on the Trauma and Orthopaedics Ward over a two month period. This led to compromised patient care by delaying dru...|$|R
40|$|To {{meet the}} {{regulations}} established to limit human exposure to time-varying electromagnetic fields (EMFs) {{such as the}} International Committee on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) <b>guidelines,</b> thin metallic <b>sheets</b> are often used to shield magnetic field leakage in high power applications of wireless power transfer (WPT) systems based on magnetic field coupling. However, the metals {{in the vicinity of}} the WPT coils cause the decrease of self and mutual inductances and increase of effective series resistance; as such, the electric performance including transmission power and the efficiency of the system is affected. With the research objective of further investigating excellent shielding effectiveness associated with system performance, the utilization of the optimal magnetic field shielding method by metallic sheets in magnetic field coupling WPT is carried out in this paper. The circuit and 3 D Finite Element Analysis (FEA) models are combined to predict the magnetic field distribution and electrical performance. Simulation and experiment results show that the method is very effective by obtaining the largest possible coupling coefficient of the WPT coils within the allowable range and then reducing the value nearest to and no smaller than the critical coupling coefficient via geometric unbroken metallic sheets. The optimal magnetic field shielding method which considers the system efficiency, transmission power, transmission distance, and system size is also achieved using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP). The results can benefit WPT by helping to achieve efficient energy transfer and safe use in metal shielded equipment...|$|R

The aim {{of the study is}} to classify the wide variety of contributions on S-LCA for tracking the development of different themes and for defining and classifying the main approaches in a systematic and reproducible way. Methods The research addressed to study a collection of 51 articles published between January 2006 and November 2014 using statistical criteria. We used automatic text analysis (ATA) tools related to lexicon analysis to identify keywords useful in tracing the main topics covered in articles published in different periods. We conducted principal component analysis (PCA) to classify the different approaches in the literature and to outline the orientations of the various research groups. Results and discussion The results from lexicon analysis showed a rapid succession of different topics covered in the analyzed period. This alternation is strongly affected by the introduction of UNEP/Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry (SETAC) S-LCA <b>guidelines</b> and methodological <b>sheets.</b> PCA analysis enabled to synthesize the information related to the numerous approaches. Results did not show a clear division into groups which indicates the absence of a dominant position on the subject in the literature. Conclusions This study attempted to map the state of art in SLCA integrating literature review with multivariate statistical techniques. The analysis showed a highly fragmented field. These results confirm the existence of a variety of approaches that in part have already been identified by literature reviews on S-LCA. Alignment with the results in the literature confirms ATA to be a suitable instrument for the realization of reviews. Moreover, being systematic and reproducible allows ATA to be applied repeatedly, expanding the number of articles and topics analyzed...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Design for X is {{commonly}} {{regarded as a}} systematic and proactive designing of products to optimize total benefits over the whole product life-cycle, while meeting target quality, cost, performance and time-to-market. DFX involves, different methodologies for product design and optimization, providing useful results, however, they address only specific aspects of product life-cycle. In addition, various perspectives for business economics can often drive to contradicted conclusions. Since different approaches use different measures for concept design evaluation the comparisons are often problematic. In this context, the need for general, but unified view on design concepts evaluation is evident. As an answer, the DFX Platform - a holistic approach for design trade-offs analysis is proposed. In the paper the main concept of DFX Platform is explained first, overall architecture of the solution is presented and the unified model for total benefit analysis is described. METHODS: Existing methods for implementing the DFX generally do not offer quantitative measure of total profitability analysis. The key issue {{of this research was}} to develop the means to reliably estimate and verify the costs/benefits of different design concepts. Various design approaches, X-s, are collected and offered via DFX Platform. The role of this framework is to provide a structured workflow specifying how and when the different X methodologies can be applied, and also to unify DFX measures. The proposed solution consists of three basic architecture layers: Approaches, Inputs/Outputs and Metrics (measures). The most common Approaches are: Modularization, Standardization, Manufacturability Assemblability, Late Customization and Quality. Application of the dedicated design approach is controlled by the DFX framework, which invokes given tools, depending on the stage of product development. It also ensures that said approaches evaluate the design concepts in terms of cost, time and quality. The particular economic estimations and measures are transferred to Metrics domain, where the total cost/benefit model is constructed, and the present value of net benefit is calculated as the main rational measure of DFX. The intermediate technical results and proposals are transmitted to the Inputs/Outputs layer, where they are accessible by next analyses as input information. RESULTS: Based on the proposed framework, the DFX Platform was developed. The solution was designed as an engineering database, which manages the different design approaches, controls the application of specific tools according to the phase of the development process, transfers the information between and within domains and ensures consistency of cost/benefit estimations. The Platform was already applied to a few product development projects carried out within cross-bordered manufacturing company, and showed its big positive impact on projects and their results. KEY CONCLUSIONS: Todays DFX methods and tools (software packages, manufacturing <b>guidelines,</b> check <b>sheets,</b> etc.) consider product and process design in unilateral way mainly, e. g. manufacture- or assembly centric. This research proposed the framework, which involves trade-offs between different design objectives and business profitability measured by present value of net benefit. The practical system supporting proactive, profit oriented design, was developed and successfully applied to the real product development projects. Pages: 274 - 28...|$|R

40|$|Aim: This paper {{presents}} {{the development process}} of the European framework for psychosocial risk management (PRIMA-EF). It also summarises and discusses key findings of research conducted through this policy-orientated research programme. Objectives: This paper presents {{an overview of the}} development process of PRIMA-EF. The background, methods and outcomes are described and discussed. The paper summarises the key findings of PRIMA-EF and concludes by a discussion of the merit of PRIMA-EF in the area of psychosocial risk management and its intended use. PRIMA-EF has been built on a review, critical assessment, reconciliation and harmonisation of existing European approaches for the management of psychosocial risks and the promotion of mental health at the workplace. The framework has been built from a theoretical analysis of the risk management process, identifying its key elements in logic and philosophy, strategy and procedures, areas and types of measurement, and from a subsequent analysis of European risk management approaches. It is meant to accommodate all existing psychosocial risk management approaches across Europe. It also provides a model and key indicators that relate to the psychosocial risk management process both at the enterprise and macro levels. Method: Experts, researchers, social partners, key European and international organisations and networks were involved throughout the development of PRIMA-EF. A number of methods were applied including literature, case study and policy reviews, interviews, surveys, focus groups and workshops. The scientific findings have been used to develop user-friendly tools for use at the enterprise and policy levels such as <b>guidelines,</b> indicators, guidance <b>sheets,</b> inventories and web-based tools. Conclusions: PRIMA-EF is intended as a framework for harmonizing practice and current methods in the area of psychosocial risk management. It can also be used as a guidance tool for the development of further methods both in Europe and internationally as it can provide a benchmark for validation of new methods. A number of priorities have been identified on the basis of PRIMA-EF for the future of psychosocial risk management and the promotion of mental health at workplace in Europe...|$|R
