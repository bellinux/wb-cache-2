25|$|All {{practitioners}} of Agama Hindu Dharma share many common beliefs, mostly the Five Points of Philosophy: the Panca Srada. These include {{the belief in}} one Almighty God, belief in the souls and spirits and karma or {{the belief in the}} law of reciprocal actions. Rather than belief in cycles of rebirth and reincarnation, Hinduism in Indonesia is concerned more with a myriad of local and ancestral spirits. In addition, the religion focuses more on art and ritual rather than scriptures, laws and beliefs. Balinese Hinduism also holds to the concept of Tri Hita Karana, nurturing and maintaining a harmonious relationship between human and God, human and <b>human,</b> <b>human</b> and nature.|$|E

Coming immediately after this defense, {{the argument that}} his victories should be [...] "cast in the Ballance" [...] is somewhat degrading and implies that Marlborough may have been mistaken in {{what he did and}} even leaves the question open with the phrase [...] "unless their Faults are prov'd Wilful and Contumacious."[9] The following paragraph, however, opens the subject of Marlborough's invincibility. Under the guise of wondering what an ungrateful nation would do should he lose a battle, Defoe brings Marlborough's perfect record, his piety, and the esteem France and his soldiers had for him to our attention. The paragraph before, then, may be taken to introduce Defoe's concern--even Marlborough could be mistaken in battle and lose, and what would such a nation do then? The paragraph on the whole reflects on the nation and is an eloquent defense of the Duke--he is <b>human,</b> <b>human</b> beings make mistakes and his great good should excuse him even more than an ordinary man's mistakes should be forgiven.|$|E

6000|$|As {{to those}} poor Wurtembergers, and {{their notion of}} the [...] "Protestant Hero," [...] I remark farther, {{that there is a}} {{something}} of real truth in it. Friedrich's Creed, or Theory of the Universe, differed extremely, in many important points, from that of Dr. Martin Luther: but in the vital all-essential point, what we may call the heart's core of all Creeds which are <b>human,</b> <b>human</b> and not simious or diabolic, the King and the Doctor were with their whole heart at one: That it is not allowable, that it is dangerous and abominable, to attempt believing what is not true. In that sense, Friedrich, by nature and position, was a Protestant, and even the chief Protestant in the world. What kind of [...] "Hero," [...] in this big War of his, we are gradually learning;--in which too, if you investigate, there is not wanting something of [...] "PROTESTANT Heroism," [...] even in the narrow sense. For it does appear,--Maria Theresa having a real fear of God, and poor Louis a real fear of the Devil, whom he may well feel to be getting dangerous purchase over him,--some hope-gleams of acting upon Schism, and so meriting Heaven, did mingle with their high terrestrial combinations, on this unique opportunity, more than are now supposed in careless History-Books.|$|E
6000|$|Whitman {{was then}} sixty-five. In a {{portrait}} of thirty years before there is just a wraith of that feline dream, perhaps, {{but it is a}} face of a rare grace and beauty that looks out at us, of a profound kindness and compassion. And, in the eyes, not so much penetration as visionary absorption. Such was the man to whom nothing was unclean, nothing too trivial (except [...] "pale poetlings lisping cadenzas piano," [...] who then apparently thronged New York) to take to himself. Intensest, indomitablest of individualists, he exulted in all that appertains to that forked radish, Man. This contentious soul of mine, he exclaims ecstatically; Viva: the attack! I have been born the same as the war was born; I lull nobody, and you will never understand me: maybe I am non-literary and un-decorous.... I have written impromptu, and shall let it all go at that. Let me at least be <b>human!</b> <b>Human,</b> indeed, he was, a tender, all-welcoming host of Everyman, of his idolized (if somewhat overpowering) American democracy. Man in the street, in his swarms, poor crazed faces in the State asylum, prisoners in Sing Sing, prostitute, whose dead body reminded him not of a lost soul, but only of a sad, forlorn, and empty house--it mattered not; he opened his heart to them, one and all. [...] "I see beyond each mark that wonder, a kindred soul. O the bullet could never kill what you really are, dear friend." ...|$|E
6000|$|And {{the more}} I {{thought about the}} matter the more painfully certain {{it seemed that the}} most {{important}} and typical modern things could not be done with a chorus. One could not, for instance, be a great financier and sing; because the essence of being a great financier is that you keep quiet. You could not even in many modern circles be a public man and sing; because in those circles the essence of being a public man is that you do nearly everything in private. Nobody would imagine a chorus of money-lenders. Every one knows the story of the solicitors' corps of volunteers who, when the Colonel on the battlefield cried [...] "Charge!" [...] all said simultaneously, [...] "Six-and-eightpence." [...] Men can sing while charging in a military, but hardly in a legal sense. And {{at the end of my}} reflections I had really got no further than the sub-conscious feeling of my friend the bank-clerk--that there is something spiritually suffocating about our life; not about our laws merely, but about our life. Bank-clerks are without songs, not because they are poor, but because they are sad. Sailors are much poorer. As I passed homewards I passed a little tin building of some religious sort, which was shaken with shouting as a trumpet is torn with its own tongue. THEY were singing anyhow; and I had for an instant a fancy I had often had before: that with us the super-human is the only place where you can find the <b>human.</b> <b>Human</b> nature is hunted and has fled into sanctuary.|$|E

6000|$|This is {{the most}} {{enormous}} {{and at the same}} time the most secret of the modern tyrannies of materialism. In theory the thing ought to be simple enough. A really <b>human</b> <b>human</b> being would always put the spiritual things first. A walking and speaking statue of God finds himself at one particular moment employed as a shop assistant. He has in himself a power of terrible love, a promise of paternity, a thirst for some loyalty that shall unify life, and in the ordinary course of things he asks himself, [...] "How far do the existing conditions of those assisting in shops fit in with my evident and epic destiny in the matter of love and marriage?" [...] But here, as I have said, comes in the quiet and crushing power of modern materialism. It prevents him rising in rebellion, as he would otherwise do. By perpetually talking about environment and visible things, by perpetually talking about economics and physical necessity, painting and keeping repainted a perpetual picture of iron machinery and merciless engines, of rails of steel, and of towers of stone, modern materialism at last produces this tremendous impression in which the truth is stated upside down. At last the result is achieved. The man does not say as he ought to have said, [...] "Should married men endure being modern shop assistants?" [...] The man says, [...] "Should shop assistants marry?" [...] Triumph has completed the immense illusion of materialism. The slave does not say, [...] "Are these chains worthy of me?" [...] The slave says scientifically and contentedly, [...] "Am I even worthy of these chains?" ...|$|E
