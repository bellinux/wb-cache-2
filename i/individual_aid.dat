6000|$|These [...] "healthy" [...] ideals, as {{they are}} called, which our {{politicians}} and schoolmasters have borrowed from the aristocratic schools and applied to the democratic, {{are by no means}} particularly appropriate to an impoverished democracy. A vague admiration for organized government and a vague distrust of <b>individual</b> <b>aid</b> cannot be made to fit in at all into the lives of people among whom kindness means lending a saucepan and honor means keeping out of the workhouse. It resolves itself either into discouraging that system of prompt and patchwork generosity which is a daily glory of the poor, or else into hazy advice to people who have no money not to give it recklessly away. Nor is the exaggerated glory of athletics, defensible enough in dealing with the rich who, if they did not romp and race, would eat and drink unwholesomely, by any means so much to the point when applied to people, most of whom will take a great deal of exercise anyhow, with spade or hammer, pickax or saw. And for the third case, of washing, {{it is obvious that the}} same sort of rhetoric about corporeal daintiness which is proper to an ornamental class cannot, merely as it stands, be applicable to a dustman. A gentleman is expected to be substantially spotless all the time. But it is no more discreditable for a scavenger to be dirty than for a deep-sea diver to be wet. A sweep is no more disgraced when he is covered with soot than Michael Angelo when he is covered with clay, or Bayard when he is covered with blood. Nor have these extenders of the public-school tradition done or suggested anything by way of a substitute for the present snobbish system which makes cleanliness almost impossible to the poor; I mean the general ritual of linen and the wearing of the cast-off clothes of the rich. One man moves into another man's clothes as he moves into another man's house. No wonder that our educationists are not horrified at a man picking up the aristocrat's second-hand trousers, when they themselves have only taken up the aristocrat's second-hand ideas.|$|E

5000|$|Transparency can {{be defined}} as a basic {{expression}} of mutual accountability. Mutual accountability can only work if there is a global culture of transparency that demands provision of information through a set of rules and behavioral norms, which are difficult to enforce in the case of official development cooperation.

Kharas suggest to adopt the [...] "regulation through information" [...] approach, which as been developed and has proven its effectiveness {{in the case of the}} European integration. In fact, at the international level, when the enforcement of mandatory rules is difficult, the solution could be to provide and make available transparent, relevant, accurate and reliable information, which can be used to reward or sanction <b>individual</b> <b>aid</b> agencies according to their performances. This means establishing a strong culture of accountability within aid, which rewards aid successes but penalizes failures.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the extent to which {{incontinence}} aids, used in local authority/municipal nursing homes, were adapted to the resident’s urine-leakage volume and to find out how nurses perceived the current situation concerning individual testing of incontinence aids in municipal nursing homes. The study method was a quantitative empirical study and was carried out in two phases. The first phase was a weighing test, carried out in three nursing homes, whereby the incontinence aids used by 25 residents during a 48 hour period were weighed. The second phase was the completion of a questionnaire by the municipal nurses working in the same local authority. The questionnaire covered: the division of responsibilities; routines for testing incontinence aids, and the level of knowledge concerning <b>individual</b> incontinence <b>aid</b> testing. Only 22 % of the pads used during the observation were properly adapted to the patients’ urinary leakage volume, while 76 % of incontinence aids were larger than necessary in relation to the real volume of urinary leakage. The municipal nurses, who have a key role and formal responsibility for <b>individual</b> incontinence <b>aid</b> testing, considered that there was insufficient knowledge within the organisation concerning <b>individual</b> incontinence <b>aid</b> testing, and that the division of responsibilities in this area was unclear. There were great variations relating to the extent of the nurses’ involvement in <b>individual</b> incontinence <b>aid</b> testing, and the nurses stated that increased involvement in <b>individual</b> incontinence <b>aid</b> testing was dependent on more time being made available for this task.

Sharing common stressors has been beneficial in other sectors including the disclosure of traumatic incidences among health practitioners (Farrington 1995). Many respondents to our survey reported that they wanted to hear more about other aid workers’ common stressors to help normalise their experiences.

40|$|Background: A multidisciplinary, {{evidence-based}} {{care program}} {{to improve the}} management of depression in nursing home residents was implemented and tested using a stepped-wedge design in 23 nursing homes (NHs) : " Act in case of Depression" (AiD). Objective: Before effect analyses, to evaluate AiD process data on sampling quality (recruitment and randomization, reach) and intervention quality (relevance and feasibility, extent to which AiD was performed), {{which can be used}} for understanding internal and external validity. In this article, a model is presented that divides process evaluation data into first- and second-order process data. Methods: Qualitative and quantitative data based on personal files of residents, interviews of nursing home professionals, and a research database were analyzed according to the following process evaluation components: sampling quality and intervention quality. Setting: Nursing home. Results: The pattern of residents' informed consent rates differed for dementia special care units and somatic units during the study. The nursing home staff was satisfied with the AiD program and reported that the program was feasible and relevant. With the exception of the first screening step (nursing staff members using a short observer-based depression scale), AiD components were not performed fully by NH staff as prescribed in the AiD protocol. Conclusion: Although NH staff found the program relevant and feasible and was satisfied with the program content, <b>individual</b> <b>AiD</b> components may have different feasibility. The results on sampling quality implied that statistical analyses of AiD effectiveness should account for the type of unit, whereas the findings on intervention quality implied that, next to the type of unit, analyses should account for the extent to which <b>individual</b> <b>AiD</b> program components were performed. In general, our first-order process data evaluation confirmed internal and external validity of the AiD trial, and this evaluation enabled further statistical fine tuning. The importance of evaluating the first-order process data before executing statistical effect analyses is thus underlined. © 2012 American Medical Directors Association, Inc...|$|E

40|$|Deposited with {{permission}} of the author. © 2003 Dr. Justin Andrew ZakisDigital hearing aids have {{an increasing number of}} adjustable amplification parameters, which offer the potential of greater customisation of their amplification settings to the needs and preferences of <b>individual</b> <b>aid</b> users. However, an increased number of adjustable amplification parameters, which may have counteracting effects, can increase the complexity of the fitting procedure, and the difficulty in achieving the combination of amplification parameter values that are optimal for the <b>individual</b> <b>aid</b> user. The latter is {{compounded by the fact that}} hearing aids are adjusted with a limited range of acoustic stimuli in a clinic environment, away from the real-life acoustic environments where the amplification provided by hearing aids may be less satisfactory. The customisation of hearing-aid amplification parameters for the <b>individual</b> <b>aid</b> user could be more efficiently and effectively performed with a trainable hearing aid. Such a hearing aid 'learns' the aid user's amplification preferences in everyday acoustic environments, and after sufficient training, automatically varies its amplification settings to the preference of the aid user for the current acoustic environment. However, to the knowledge of this author, the efficacy of trainable hearing aids has not been published in scientific journals. This thesis describes the design, development, and evaluation of a novel trainable hearing aid. In order to evaluate the novel trainable hearing aid, two laboratory experiments and three field trials were conducted to test three main hypotheses: and one sub-hypothesis. For one experiment, the amplification preferences of a hypothetical aid user were communicated to the developed aid under controlled conditions, and used by the aid to calculate a set of trained amplification parameters. The trained amplification parameters resulted in the application of amplification settings that were closer to the hypothetical preferred settings than were the original untrained settings. The results of this experiment supported the first hypothesis. For the other laboratory experiment, the speech-to-noise ratio estimation technique used by the aid was evaluated under controlled conditions (the developed aid periodically estimated the speech-to-noise ratio from a statistical analysis of the microphone signal, and could vary its gain with the speech-to-noise ratio estimates as determined by a trainable amplification parameter). It was found that when speech was present, the speech-to-noise ratio estimation technique used by the novel aid provided estimates that were linearly correlated with the reference estimates over a range of (mainly positive) speech-to- noise ratios, which partly supported sub-Hypothesis 2 a. A training trial was conducted, where the developed aid was fitted to 18 hearing-impaired subjects, who trained the aid in the acoustic environments they encountered in everyday life. The data that was logged in the aids during this trial indicated that, for some compression channels, the relationship between the amplification preferences of the subjects and the speech-to-noise ratio relative to the average for all channels (as estimated by the aid) was significant, which partly supported the second hypothesis. Most subjects who had completed the training trial participated in the comparison trials, where a modified version of the developed aid allowed the subjects to blindly compare their trained and untrained settings in everyday acoustic environments, and log their preferred settings in the aid's non-volatile memory. The results of the comparison trials showed that, in everyday environments, most subjects preferred the trained settings to the untrained settings on a statistically-significant majority of occasions, which supported the third hypothesis. Furthermore, it was found that the proportion of occasions when the trained settings were preferred was positively correlated with the amount of time the subjects used the aid during the training trial. Therefore, the main findings of this research project were that under controlled acoustic conditions, a hearing aid can be trained to provide amplification settings that are closer to hypothetical preferred settings than were the initial untrained settings, and in everyday acoustic environments, hearing aid users can train an aid to provide amplification settings that they prefer to the untrained settings on a significant majority of occasions.

40|$|Increasingly, {{humanitarian}} aid personnel {{are exposed to}} both vicarious and primary traumatic events. The Postmission Altruistic Identity Disruption Questionnaire (PostAID/Q) was developed {{with the aim of}} guiding humanitarian organizations in the psychosocial aftercare of personnel particularly their reintegration within families, the workplace, and society postmission. Altruistic identity disruption refers to reintegration difficulties experienced by returnees from humanitarian work such that the person feels alienated, invalidated, isolated from others who do not share his or her experiences, and questioning of their role as an aid worker. The PostAID/Q is an 18 -item self-report measure designed to assess altruistic identity disruption. Sixty-one aid personnel completed an initial pool of 79 items developed by the authors from semistructured interviews with aid personnel. Following inspection of item frequencies, 36 items were retained. Following principal components analysis with a forced one-component solution, 18 items were selected to compose the PostAID/Q. The PostAID/Q promises to be useful to both aid organizations and the <b>individual</b> <b>aid</b> worker in the reintegration period postmission by (a) guiding organizations in their psychosocial support of aid personnel; (b) assisting personnel in identifying interpersonal, environmental, and perceived organizational influences on their psychosocial well-being; and (c) indicating returnees’ subsequent readiness for redeployment...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we update {{previous}} work that categorizes foreign aid projects {{in terms of}} their likely impact on the natural environment. We then document trends in the global distribution of environmental aid over time and show that environmental aid has increasingly focussed on global environmental issues (especially climate change), rather than local issues in recipient countries. Somewhat surprisingly, we also find that environmental aid is increasingly allocated through bilateral aid agencies rather than through the increasing number of multilateral channels created for this purpose. After providing these descriptive statistics and demonstrating trends, we offer a tentative explanation for this puzzling pattern. We argue that each <b>individual</b> <b>aid</b> project represents a negotiation between donor and recipient. This additional level of bargaining significantly conditions {{the costs and benefits of}} multilateralism for donors, especially as recipients have multiple outside options for obtaining development finance. Reflecting the growing political salience of global environmental threats, donors are providing increasing levels of environmental aid, and especially climate finance. However, at the same time, donors are increasingly failing to co-ordinate their allocation of climate finance (and other environmental aid) within multilateral institutions. At a practical level, this raises the question whether the effect of increasing levels of funding will be undercut by decreasing co-ordination and efficiency...|$|E
