5|$|Although {{defeated}} in the election, Willkie had become a major figure on the public scene, and at age 48, was deemed likely to remain one for years to come.

5|$|The new law {{was rapidly}} enforced. The first {{military}} tribunal {{took place on}} 28 August 1975 in Castrillo del Val when ETA members José Antonio Garmendia and Ángel Otaegui were sentenced to death for killing a civil guard, Gregorio Posadas, on 3 April 1974 in Azpeitia. Garmendia was accused of shooting Posadas and Otaegui of helping him to flee from police. Garmendia was shot during his interrogations and ended in a coma and, due to his physical condition, was unable to sign his confession, instead having to place his fingerprint on a confession previously written which implicated Otaegui. Though witnesses failed to identify Garamendi and doctors testified that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>no</b> fit state to validate the confession, together with Otaegui, he {{was found guilty of}} the charges.|$|E
5|$|Cotes' {{ship was}} fit only to sail with the wind, {{and the captain}} urged his men to make greater efforts to repair their ship before Uranie {{could come up with}} them again. So engrossed was the British crew with their repairs that it was not until 16:00 that it was {{realised}} that the French frigate was no longer holding station within sight, and had completely disappeared. This led some on the British ship to assume that Uranie had sunk, although in fact the ship had simply turned away {{in an effort to make}} it back to Rochefort to repair the damage suffered in the engagement. Also apparent were a number of sails in the distance. These rapidly approached and were revealed to be a frigate squadron flying the Union Flag. Cotes was unable to manoeuvre his ship or respond to the new arrivals, which were soon identified as French vessels wearing false flags. The leading frigate pulled up close to Thames and fired a broadside at the British frigate. Cotes immediately hailed the French, announcing that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>no</b> position to fight them due to the damage his ship had suffered and that he was striking his flag.|$|E

5|$|Goldfaden {{was both}} a {{theoretician}} and a practitioner of theater. That <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>no</b> small measure a theoretician – for example, he was interested almost from the start in having set design seriously support the themes of his plays – relates to a key property of Yiddish theater {{at the time of}} its birth: in general, writes Bercovici, theory ran ahead of practice. Much of the Jewish community, Goldfaden included, were already familiar with contemporary theater in other languages. The initial itinerary of Goldfaden's company – Iaşi, Botoşani, Galaţi, Brăila, Bucharest – could as easily have been the itinerary of a Romanian-language troupe. Yiddish theater may have been seen from the outset as an expression of a Jewish national character, but the theatrical values of Goldfaden's company were in many ways those of a good Romanian theater of the time. Also, Yiddish was a German dialect which became a well-known language even among non-Jews in Moldavia (and Transylvania), an important language of commerce; the fact that one of the first to write about Yiddish theater was Romania's national poet, Mihai Eminescu, is testimony that interest in Yiddish theater went beyond the Jewish community.|$|E
5|$|The {{report found}} that the {{tendency}} of the evidence presented in the programme was to suggest the terrorists had been unlawfully killed, and {{that it did not}} explore alternative explanations in any depth. Nevertheless, Windlesham and Rampton believed that the programme presented evidence for one possible explanation, but sought to raise questions rather than reach a conclusion. In analysing the content of the programme, they found that it allowed the witnesses to give their accounts in their own words rather than presenting them as established fact. Thus, they found that the content did not infringe any requirement for neutrality. The report scrutinised in detail the statements of the eyewitnesses who spoke on camera, including the parts of the interviews that {{were not included in the}} broadcast version of the programme. It found, with two exceptions, that the witnesses' statements were fairly represented in the programme. The exceptions were that the programme suggested that Bullock had not heard a warning, when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>no</b> position to hear whether such a warning was given or not; and that the commentary implied that all four witnesses who appeared on the programme had seen no threatening movements from the IRA members, when only two had been asked whether they witnessed such movements. Windlesham and Rampton also considered Asquez's statement and the journalists' decision to incorporate it into the programme. The report considered that the journalists acted reasonably in using the statement, despite Asquez's refusal to sign it, on the grounds that Asquez had given two separate, near-identical statements (including one to a lawyer), and that they considered it unlikely that somebody would invent such a dramatic account. Nonetheless, the report criticised the programme for not informing viewers of Asquez's refusal to sign the statement.|$|E

25|$|The fact that, {{for many}} years, no other {{scholars}} besides Smith {{were known to}} have seen the manuscript contributed to the suspicions of forgery. This dissipated {{with the publication of}} color photographs in 2000, and the revelation that Guy Stroumsa and several others had viewed the manuscript in 1976. In response to the idea that Smith had kept other scholars from inspecting the manuscript, Scott G. Brown noted that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>no</b> position to do so. The manuscript was still where Smith had left it when Stroumsa and company found it eighteen years later, and it did not disappear until many years after its relocation to Jerusalem and its separation from the book.|$|E
25|$|On Monday May 6, 1968, St. Petersburg city {{sanitation}} workers went {{on strike}} and implemented a work stoppage at the Lake Maggiore sanitation compound. Workers expressed concern over a new pay plan implemented a month prior, that failed to produce “shared savings” that were to be passed along to the workers as promised. As {{a result of these}} perceived failed promises, sanitation workers demanded a wage increase of 25-cents an hour before they would return to work.

25|$|Hadrian was at Antioch in Syria {{when word}} came through {{of the death}} of Trajan. But <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>no</b> {{position}} to return to Rome, as he was advised that Quadratus Bassus, ordered by Trajan to protect the new Dacian territories north of the Danube, had died there while on campaign. As a result of taking several legions and numerous auxiliary regiments with him to Parthia, Trajan had left Dacia and the remaining Danubian provinces below strength. The Roxolani, angry over a Roman decision to cease the payments to which Trajan had agreed, allied themselves with the Iazyges and both tribes revolted against Rome. Therefore, Hadrian dispatched the armies from the east ahead of him, and departed Syria {{as soon as he was}} able.|$|E
25|$|In Iberia, Carthaginian {{rule was}} not popular, but Roman {{inaction}} during the Siege of Saguntum {{had made the}} natives cautious about an alliance against their masters. Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio Calvus established his headquarters at Cissa, {{in the midst of}} Hannibal's latest acquisition, the area between Ebro and Pyrenees. Despite initial setbacks, he won increasing support among the natives. This convinced the Carthaginian commander Hanno, the nephew of Hannibal, of the necessity to accept pitched battle before his troops had been united with the army under Hasdrubal, the brother of Hannibal, despite being outnumbered 2 to 1. The result was a Roman victory in the Battle of Cissa in 218 BC. When Hasdrubal finally made it to the scene, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>no</b> position to fight the Roman army and merely caught their navy personnel off-guard, killing some in the process.|$|E
25|$|Cumberland {{failed to}} make {{effective}} use of his cavalry. He was so absorbed in the infantry attack that he left his horse regiments idle in the rear until the time for useful action had passed. In effect, the Duke relied not on manoeuvre but on force; it was a direct approach that fell victim to Saxe's clever exploitation of his defensive position. Additionally, with Cumberland {{at the head of}} the allied column <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>no</b> position to capitalize on his own attack through efforts elsewhere: he could not prevent the French from concentrating against his column because he was behaving more like a battalion commander than a captain general. Although British leadership was found lacking, British infantry's superior discipline showed that however much French infantry had improved under Saxe's tutelage, France could not match the best that Britain could put in the field. Fontenoy dispelled the notion of British military superiority held in Europe since Marlborough and demonstrated French battlefield superiority over the British and their allies.|$|E

25|$|On April 23, 1864, when Steele {{received}} the dispatch from Banks asking that he join Banks {{so they could}} move again on Shreveport, Steele responded that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>no</b> position to join Banks. He also noted that he now faced not only Confederate cavalry but Sterling Price's returned infantry and additional infantry under Kirby Smith. Kirby Smith had joined Price {{with some of the}} infantry which had been with Taylor at the battle of Pleasant Hill. Brigadier-General Thomas Churchill’s Arkansas division and Brigadier-General Mosby Parsons's Missouri division had returned to Price's command. They were followed by Major-General John Walker’s larger Texas division with Kirby Smith. Kirby Smith had decided that Steele was a bigger threat, and a bigger prize, than Banks when Banks continued to retreat after the battle of Pleasant Hill on April 9, 1864. Kirby Smith thought he could destroy Steele's force and perhaps still turn back and trap Banks later. Taylor vehemently disagreed with this decision and wanted to attack Banks immediately. Nonetheless, Taylor could not convince Kirby Smith to change his plan. As Banks appeared to be waiting for the naval force at Alexandria, Louisiana, Kirby Smith became even more certain that his decision was correct and he had time to execute it.|$|E

500|$|Although Lindwall {{was able}} to jog between the wickets, {{he did not take}} the field in the second innings and the 12th man Neil Harvey {{replaced}} him.

Yardley was sceptical as to whether Lindwall was sufficiently injured to be forced from the field, but he did not formally object to Harvey’s presence on the field. Journalist, former Australian Test cricketer and Lindwall mentor Bill O'Reilly, said that as Lindwall demonstrated his mobility during his innings, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>no</b> way [...] "incapacitated" [...] and that the English captain [...] "must be condemned for carrying his concepts of sportsmanship too far" [...] when no substitute was justified.
