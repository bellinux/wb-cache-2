40|$|To {{prevent the}} {{adjacent}} structures from damage, some auxiliary methods {{were used to}} control the ground movements induced by deep excavation. Cross <b>walls</b> and <b>buttress</b> <b>walls</b> are common construction methods used in Taiwan for protection of adjacent buildings during excavation. It is generally recognized, but not verified, that both methods have good effects in reducing wall movement and ground settlement. However, the design methodologies for cross <b>walls</b> and <b>buttress</b> <b>walls</b> in excavations are still highly empirical {{because of lack of}} behavior research. The present analysis and the design method are all pause at the experience stage. Therefore, the related cross <b>walls</b> and <b>buttress</b> <b>walls</b> behavior urgently awaits the further research. As this result, a series of behaviors, cases study, and parameter analysis of cross <b>walls</b> and <b>buttress</b> <b>walls</b> are then studied using the numerical analysis method in this study. According to the analysis results, the best design proposal will be put forward. And the simplification empirical design graph will be proposed also. In addition, this study will recommend the simplification analysis methods that coordinate the theory of elasto-plastic single beam model and plane strain numerical analysis. Finally, the stability of excavation increased by cross <b>walls</b> and <b>buttress</b> <b>walls</b> will be investigated.

40|$|For {{active control}} {{purposes}} a <b>double</b> <b>wall</b> structure enables {{the measurement of}} a time advanced reference signal for a feedforward system because the reference signal can be measured at the primary panel and the control system {{can be applied to}} the second panel. In aerospace engineering these <b>double</b> <b>wall</b> sections are often filled with absorbent materials. These materials have an influence on the structural dynamics of the <b>double</b> <b>wall</b> section. In order to guarantee the function of the feedforward control system the damped <b>double</b> <b>wall</b> section has to show a linear system behavior. In order to analyze the linearity of <b>double</b> <b>wall</b> panels with different absorbent materials this study experimentally investigates different damping concepts on a simple <b>double</b> <b>wall</b> structure.

40|$|In this paper, the {{characterization}} of metallic studs used to mount lightweight <b>double</b> <b>wall</b> systems is studied both experimentally and numerically. The metallic studs are usually considered by introducing translational and rotational springs to couple the plasterboards composing the <b>double</b> <b>wall.</b> Therefore, {{the characterization}} involves determining these spring characteristics. The performance {{of this type of}} lightweight <b>double</b> <b>wall</b> in terms of sound transmission is presented in a companion paper. Different experimental setups have been investigated to determine the equivalent translational and rotational spring values. These experimental setups are described and involve the measurement of an input mobility. A finite element model of the laboratory tests has been developed. Shell and massive finite elements are employed in order to reproduce the experimental setups. A comparison of the measured and numerical results is shown. The FEM modelling is intended to help in developing new type of studs for <b>double</b> <b>walls</b> in order to obtain better sound transmission performance.

40|$|The Double-Wall, "Whipple" Shield [1] {{has been}} the subject of many {{hypervelocity}} impact studies and has proven to be an effective shield system for Micro-Meteoroid and Orbital Debris (MMOD) impacts for spacecraft. The US modules of the International Space Station (ISS), with their "bumper shields" offset from their pressure holding rear walls provide good examples of effective on-orbit use of the <b>double</b> <b>wall</b> shield. The concentric cylinder shield configuration with its large radius of curvature relative to separation distance is easily and effectively represented for testing and analysis as a system of two parallel plates. The parallel plate <b>double</b> <b>wall</b> configuration has been heavily tested and characterized for shield performance for normal and oblique impacts for the ISS and other programs. The <b>double</b> <b>wall</b> shield and principally similar Stuffed Whipple Shield are very common shield types for MMOD protection. However, in some locations with many spacecraft designs, the rear wall cannot be modeled as being parallel or concentric with the outer bumper wall. As represented in Figure 1, there is an included angle between the two walls. And, with a cylindrical outer wall, the effective included angle constantly changes. This complicates assessment of critical spacecraft components located within outer spacecraft walls when using software tools such as NASA's BumperII.
