60|$|Festus had {{sat down}} on the hollow window-bench, and was {{continuing}} the statement of his wrongs. 'If he only knew what he was sitting upon,' she thought apprehensively, 'how easily he could tear up the <b>flap,</b> <b>lock</b> and all, with his strong arm, and seize upon poor Uncle Benjy's possessions!' But he did not appear to know, unless he were acting, which was just possible. After a while he rose, and going to the table lifted the candle to light his pipe. At the moment when the flame began diving into the bowl the door noiselessly opened and a figure slipped across the room to the window-bench, hastily unlocked it, withdrew the box, and beat a retreat. Anne in a moment recognized the ghostly intruder as Festus Derriman's uncle. Before he could get out of the room Festus set down the candle and turned.|$|E
40|$|Tests {{were made}} to {{determine}} {{the effectiveness of a}} long-period dynamically overbalanced flap in reducing airplane accelerations due to atmospheric gusts. For two gust shapes, one gust velocity, one forward velocity, and one wing loading, a series of flights was made with the <b>flap</b> <b>locked</b> and was then repeated with the flap free to operate. The records were evaluated by routine methods. The results indicate that the flap reduced the maximum acceleration increment 39 percent for a severe gust but with a representative gust shape (a sharp-edge gust), the reduction was only 3 percent. The results also indicate that the flap tended to reduce the longitudinal stability of the airplane. Computations made of the effectiveness and the action of the flap were in good agreement with the experimental results...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of a leading edge propeller blade reconfiguration system using Shape Memory Allow (SMA) muscles is presented. This work describes the design and testing of a leading edge flap, {{which is used to}} alter the local camber of a propeller blade. The leading edge flap is deflected by SMA wires housed in the blade and maintained in a fixed position with a shaft locking and releasing mechanism. A locking and releasing mechanism is utilized so that constant actuation of the SMAs is not required to maintain leading edge deflection. The profile at 70 % span of the propeller blade was used to create a two-dimensional blade for leading edge flap design implementation and load testing. Deflection of up to five degrees was obtained with the final design of the leading edge <b>flap</b> and <b>locking</b> and releasing mechanism. The SMA muscles used to deflect the leading edge were actuated electronically through resistive heating and were controlled by a proportional/integral gain control algorithm with closed-loop feedback from a linear displacement sensor within the blade. With the final design of the leading edge <b>flap</b> and <b>locking</b> and releasing mechanism, a preliminary design for a three-dimensional propeller was created...|$|R
40|$|EP 2039612 A 1 UPAB: 20090409 NOVELTY - The {{folding box}} (12) {{comprises}} a folding tab (13), which is formed at the sealing flap (2) over a length between the folded corners (1) at the sealing flap and the edge. The length remains {{up to the}} edge of the sealing flap. The folding tab is inserted into the folded corners at another sealing <b>flap</b> (3) when <b>locking</b> the folding box independently by the folded corners at the sealing flap. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for a method for locking a folding box. USE - Folding box for dust and insect resistant packing made of a single piece. ADVANTAGE - The length remains {{up to the edge}} of the sealing flap, and the folding tab is inserted into the folded corners at another sealing <b>flap</b> when <b>locking</b> the folding box independently by the folded corners at the sealing flap, and thus ensures mechanical protection and an economical manufacturing of the folding box...|$|R
50|$|Inside all {{the cars}} came with a bench seat at the front and at the back as {{standard}} apart {{from the top of}} the line Taunus 20M TS which included individual front seats as standard. Individual seats were available at extra cost on the less exalted models, as part of a (by the standards of the time) long list of optional extras. The boot/trunk could be locked from the outside, and when this was done the adjacent fuel filler <b>flap</b> was <b>locked</b> automatically at the same time.|$|R
40|$|Some {{experimental}} {{results are presented}} from wind tunnel studies of a dynamic model equipped with an aeromechanical gust alleviation system for reducing the normal acceleration response of light airplanes. The gust alleviation system consists of two auxiliary aerodynamic surfaces that deflect the wing flaps through mechanical linkages when a gust is encountered to maintain nearly constant airplane lift. The gust alleviation system was implemented on a 1 / 6 -scale, rod mounted, free flying model that is geometrically and dynamically representative of small, four place, high wing, single engine, light airplanes. The effects of flaps with different spans, two size of auxiliary aerodynamic surfaces, plain and double hinged flaps, and a flap elevator interconnection were studied. The model test results are presented in terms of predicted root mean square response of the full scale airplane to atmospheric turbulence. The {{results show that the}} gust alleviation system reduces the root mean square normal acceleration response by 30 percent in comparison with the response in the <b>flaps</b> <b>locked</b> condition. Small reductions in pitch-rate response were also obtained. It is believed that substantially larger reductions in normal acceleration can be achieved by reducing the rather high levels of mechanical friction which were extant in the alleviation system of the present model...|$|R

50|$|In around 1942 the Swiss army {{initiated}} a competition {{for a new}} service machine gun to replace both the “heavy” MG 11 and the “light” Lmg25, adopted in 1911 and 1925 respectively. Three participants joined the competition-government-owned Waffenfabrik Bern, and privately owned factories SIG and Hispano-Suiza. Waffenfabrik Bern based its development on the hugely successful German MG 42. The first prototypes emerged in around 1944, and looked much like MG42, although the shape of receiver and butt was somewhat different. The final design, which appeared in 1950, was in most respects similar to the MG 42, although many parts were produced by machining instead of stamping, and the locking system was changed from roller to <b>flap</b> <b>locking.</b> The resulting weapon was heavier than the German original, and much more finely made and finished. In certain respects it was a “Rolex” of machine guns. Until very recently MG 51 served as a primary infantry and vehicle machine gun for Swiss army, although it is now being gradually replaced in service with lighter and less expensive, but also less powerful 5.56mm FN Minimi machine gun of Belgian origin and manufacture. The MG 51 is a short-recoil-operated, locked breech, air-cooled and automatic only, belt-fed weapon. It uses a modified MG 42 type locking system with a two-piece bolt and dual <b>locking</b> <b>flaps</b> located in the front part of the bolt. These flaps engage the cuts made in the short barrel extension to provide rigid locking. Upon recoil, the flaps are retracted {{toward the center of}} the bolt, to unlock it. An additional lever-type bolt accelerator is provided; it is located in receiver, next to the barrel breech and below the bolt. The gun housing also somewhat resembles the German MG 42, although it is made from two separate parts - the barrel jacket (made from stamped steel) and receiver (a solid machined body). The barrel jacket is permanently welded to the front of the receiver. The barrel can be changed rapidly if required; the barrel change procedure is similar to that of the MG 42, with the locking latch located at the right side of the jacket, which is opened to provide a barrel replacement window.|$|R
50|$|The 15 meter Class LS6 was however {{achieving}} {{surprisingly good}} results flying with <b>locked</b> <b>flaps</b> in the non-FAI sanctioned Sports Class in the United States. Following this lead, Rolladen-Schneider modified an LS6-c {{by removing the}} flap handle, resetting the wing at a slightly higher angle of incidence and adding winglets. This experimental prototype outperformed state-of-the-art standard class sailplanes both in side-by-side flight tests and in contests including the German Championships at Neustadt-Glewe.|$|R

A ludicrous figure, a little old man, his white <b>locks</b> <b>flapping</b> under a mushy cap as he galloped earnestly through the light snow.

50|$|However, when {{returning}} to Venlo, Streib crashed the He 219 during landing. Low on fuel, Streib reported {{that during the}} landing approach the cockpit iced up, impairing his vision, necessitating an instrument approach. He activated the electrically controlled flaps and lowered the landing gear. Unnoticed by Streib, the <b>flaps</b> did not <b>lock</b> down and the electrically controlled flaps retracted themselves. Subsequently, his airspeed was too high during the final approach. Streib, misjudging his airspeed, flared the aircraft and slammed it into the runway. The resulting shockwave ruptured the tires; the starboard engine and cockpit were torn off the aircraft. Both Streib and Fischer escaped with minor injuries.|$|R
5000|$|The closed unsink inverts {{a closed}} sink without {{completely}} opening out the affected paper. In theory, it is [...] "just" [...] {{the opposite of}} a closed sink. In practice, it is very difficult, because the paper being [...] "popped" [...] into place usually must be pulled (not pushed), and because it involves simultaneously folding over a <b>locking</b> <b>flap</b> that is hidden inside the sink. However, {{it is easier to}} manipulate than an open unsink as there is an internal flap to pull to pop the unsink in place; in an open unsink there is nothing to hold. The closed unsink appears in some complex models, such as a few of Lang's insects.|$|R
25|$|The {{original}} {{hood of the}} DeLorean had grooves {{running down}} both sides. It included a gas flap to simplify fuel filling. The gas flap was built so that the trunk could {{be added to the}} total cargo area of the DeLorean. These cars typically had a locking gas cap to prevent siphoning. In August 1981, the hood flap was removed from the hood of the cars (although the hood creases stayed). This style was retained well into 1982. Based on production numbers for all three years, this hood style is probably the most common. After the supply of locking gas caps was exhausted, the company switched to a non-locking version (resulting in at least 500 cars with no gas <b>flap,</b> but with <b>locking</b> gas caps). The final styling for the hood included the addition of a DeLorean name badge and the removal of the grooves, resulting in a completely flat hood. According to senior personnel who worked at the Dunmurry factory, initial elimination of gas flap hoods has a simple if unglamorous explanation—Chuck Benington, managing director, did not like the gas flap design.|$|R
40|$|Stability {{and control}} of rotors at high advance ratio are considered. Stability of teetering, articulated, and {{gimbaled}} hub types is considered with a simple flapping blade analysis. Rotor control in autorotation for teetering and articulated hub types is examined in more detail for a compound helicopter (rotor and fixed wing) using the comprehensive analysis CAMRAD II. Autorotation {{is found to be}} possible at two distinct trim conditions with different sharing of lift between the rotor and wing. Stability predictions obtained using the analytical rigid flapping blade analysis and a rigid blade CAMRAD II model compare favorably. For the flapping blade analysis, the teetering rotor is found to be the most stable hub type, showing no instabilities up to an advance ratio of 3 and a Lock number of 18. Analysis of the trim controls, lift, power, and blade flapping shows that for small positive collective pitch, trim can be maintained without excessive control input or flapping angles for both teetering and articulated rotors.

5000|$|In April 1955 {{engineer}} Antonio Fessia joined Lancia as technical director, {{and started}} off fixing the Appia's shortcomings. Jano left shortly after, when Lancia withdrew from Formula 1.The resulting second series Appia, introduced at the Geneva Motor Show in March 1956, {{had a more}} powerful engine, a modernized body and better interior room. The C10 and C10S type codes were kept.The rear {{part of the body}} had been redesigned to enlarge the boot, and the wheelbase was stretched by 3 cm to provide better rear seat accommodation; this resulted in a [...] cm growth in length. From the front the second series could be recognized from its rectangular instead of round turn signal lamps and the steel bumpers with over-riders. The fuel filler cap was moved outside, under a <b>locking</b> <b>flap</b> on the right hand side rear wing. Fessia's changes to the engine included lowering the compression ratio, redesigning the cylinder head incorporating hemispherical combustion chambers and a new arrangement of the valves, new pistons, a new carburettor and different camshaft profiles. Output increased to 43 PS, and top speed to 120 km/h. In the cabin a front bench seat took place of the two single ones, the binnacle held two round instruments, and steering wheel and switchgear went from ivory to black.|$|R
40|$|Today's {{economic}} {{demands in}} manufacturing drive {{the requirements for}} high precision and productivity rates in machine tools design. One {{of the most common}} used machine tool drives for linear motion is the ball screw drive (BSD), which converts rotational motion of the servo motor to linear motion of the machine tool structural component. The advantages of modern BSD are high rigidity and low friction, and therefore a high efficiency compared to alternative systems like rack and pinion systems. However, to achieve the required accuracy it is necessary to preload the ball screw drive to prevent backlash. Backlash is caused by the clearance between the contacts of the ball bearings and the threads of the nut and screw. Clearance, however, is needed to prevent unnecessary friction during operation of the BSD. Different preload levels, on one hand, determine the rigidity and thus the maximum load a drive can carry and, on the other hand, the amount of heat to be dissipated due to friction which also leads to wear of the components. Due to their high specific workloads and relatively small spatial requirements, shape memory alloys (SMA) possess an outstanding potential to serve as miniaturized positioning devices in adaptronic and mechatronic applications. In comparison to other actuators such as hydraulics, electric motors or piezoelectric actuators, SMA based-actuators have the highest mechanical work output per volume. Nevertheless, most of the known SMA drives are used in the application area of small and lightweight actuators such as <b>flaps</b> and <b>locks</b> in the automotive industry, medical technology and life science. In this paper we present an approach to retrieve a preload loss which causes a loss to positioning accuracy in BSD due to wear over lifetime. The main purposes are reduced maintenance, longer service life and improved workpiece quality by regenerating previous preload conditions which leads to higher gainings for manufacturers. For this purpose, a novel SMA actuator driven module for BSD has been designed. The device was developed to be implemented in standard drives without major changes in component design. It is installed between flanged nut and counter nut and replaces a spacer usually used to define a specific preload. It was required to scale the actuator module over a wide range of screw diameters respectively nut diameters. Besides mechanical properties, thermal boundary conditions during operation of BSD must be taken into consideration. A prototype has been manufactured and tested to evaluate the current design and first results will be introduced...|$|R
