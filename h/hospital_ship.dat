5|$|USAHS Blanche F. Sigman was a United States Army <b>hospital</b> <b>ship</b> during World War II. The {{ship was}} {{completed}} in April 1943 as Liberty ship SS Stanford White. When selected for conversion to a <b>hospital</b> <b>ship,</b> she was originally assigned the name USAHS Poppy, but never operated under that name. After being decommissioned as a <b>hospital</b> <b>ship,</b> she became U.S. Army transport USAT Blanche F. Sigman.|$|E

50|$|<b>Hospital</b> <b>ships</b> {{possibly}} {{existed in}} ancient times. The Athenian Navy had a ship named Therapia, and the Roman Navy had a ship named Aesculapius, their names {{indicating that they}} may have been <b>hospital</b> <b>ships.</b>|$|R
5000|$|During World War I and World War II, <b>hospital</b> <b>ships</b> {{were first}} {{used on a}} massive scale. Many {{passenger}} liners were converted for use as <b>hospital</b> <b>ships.</b> [...] and [...] were two famous examples of ships serving in this capacity. By {{the end of the}} First World War, The British Royal Navy had 77 such ships in service. During the Gallipoli Campaign, <b>hospital</b> <b>ships</b> were used to evacuate over 100,000 wounded personnel to Egypt.|$|R
5|$|In October, the <b>hospital</b> <b>ship</b> put in at Jacksonville {{for major}} repairs, before {{embarking on a}} final Mediterranean tour, {{arriving}} back in Charleston in April 1945. With the war in Europe winding down by this time, Shamrock underwent ventilation improvements at the Charleston Navy Yard intended for service in the Pacific. The repairs complete in September 1945, the <b>hospital</b> <b>ship</b> sailed for Los Angeles, arriving in October.|$|E
5|$|In November 1943, the WSA {{allocated}} {{the ship}} to the U.S. Army, which converted her to a <b>hospital</b> <b>ship.</b> Though initially assigned the name Poppy, she was instead {{named in honor of}} First Lieutenant Blanche F. Sigman, a U.S. Army nurse killed in action in Italy. The <b>hospital</b> <b>ship</b> was initially based in Charleston, South Carolina, and made multiple voyages to ports in England, the Mediterranean, and France. After her homeport was changed to New York in December 1945, she made several more runs to Europe as a <b>hospital</b> <b>ship,</b> then converted to USAT Blanche F. Sigman in April 1946. As a transport, the ship made numerous trips bringing home nurses and military personnel prior to entering the National Defense Reserve Fleet in 1948. The ship was declared surplus by the Army in 1949, and sold for scrapping in 1974.|$|E
5|$|Surveyed {{and found}} {{suitable}} for conversion to a <b>hospital</b> <b>ship,</b> Bridgeport underwent modernization at the Merrill-Stevens Drydock & Repair Co. in Jacksonville, Florida from September 1943 to August 1944, {{during which time}} she was renamed USAHS Larkspur. Her maiden voyage as an Army <b>hospital</b> <b>ship</b> took her from Charleston, South Carolina to the British Isles. After visits to the River Clyde and to Belfast, Northern Ireland, she underwent repairs at Newport, Wales, before sailing for home. The ship reached Charleston on 16 October 1944 with her first group of patients.|$|E

5000|$|The Army {{had been}} {{hesitant}} to withdraw troop carrying capacity for conversion into designated, Convention protected <b>hospital</b> <b>ships</b> but in June 1943, under pressure of and {{experience with the}} North African campaign the Surgeon General and Joint Chiefs of Staff decided protected <b>hospital</b> <b>ships</b> would be the normal means of evacuation for [...] "helpless patients" [...] from forward area <b>hospitals.</b> These <b>ships</b> would not be [...] "floating hospitals" [...] for initial treatment as were the Navy <b>hospital</b> <b>ships</b> but transports to clear forward area Army hospitals to rear areas or the United States and that smaller, slower troop ships would be selected and converted as soon as replacement through new construction was available.|$|R
5|$|This theory {{states that}} Nakagawa was {{unaware that the}} vessel he was attacking was a <b>hospital</b> <b>ship,</b> and that the sinking was an unfortunate accident. This view was {{supported}} by several Japanese officers, {{both before and after}} the revelation that Nakagawa was responsible. Amongst them was Lieutenant Commander Zenji Orita, who took command of I-177 after Nakagawa. Orita did not hear anything from the crew about having sunk a <b>hospital</b> <b>ship,</b> not even rumours, and believed that if I-177 had knowingly attacked Centaur, he would have learned this from the crew's gossip.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1943, Centaur was placed {{at the disposal of}} the Australian Department of Defence for conversion to a <b>hospital</b> <b>ship.</b> The conversion was performed by United Ship Services in Melbourne, Australia, and was initially estimated to cost AU£20,000.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} November 1915, Sing {{suffered}} from myalgia and was confined to the <b>hospital</b> <b>ship</b> HMHS Gloucester Castle for almost two weeks.

5|$|Centaur entered {{operation}} as a <b>hospital</b> <b>ship</b> on 12 March 1943. The {{early stages}} of Centaur's first voyage as a <b>hospital</b> <b>ship</b> were test and transport runs; the initial run from Melbourne to Sydney resulted in the Master, Chief Engineer, and Chief Medical Officer composing {{a long list of}} defects requiring attention. Following repairs, she conducted a test run, transporting wounded servicemen from Townsville to Brisbane to ensure that she was capable of fulfilling the role of a medical vessel. Centaur was then tasked with delivering medical personnel to Port Moresby, New Guinea, and returning to Brisbane with Australian and American wounded along with a small number of wounded Japanese prisoners of war.|$|E
5|$|With the {{commencement}} of hostilities between Japan and the British Empire, {{it became clear that}} the three hospital ships currently serving Australia—Manunda, Wanganella, and Oranje—would not be able to operate in the shallow waters typical of Maritime Southeast Asia, so a new <b>hospital</b> <b>ship</b> was required. Of the Australian Merchant Navy vessels able to operate in this region, none were suitable for conversion to a <b>hospital</b> <b>ship,</b> and a request to the British Ministry of Shipping placed Centaur at the disposal of the Australian military on 4 January 1943. The conversion work began on 9 January and Centaur was commissioned as an Australian <b>Hospital</b> <b>Ship</b> on 1 March. During her conversion, Centaur was painted with the markings of a <b>hospital</b> <b>ship</b> as detailed in Article 5 of the tenth Hague Convention of 1907 ("Adaptation to Maritime War of the Principles of the Geneva Convention"); white hull with a green band interspersed by three red crosses on each flank of the hull, white superstructure, multiple large red crosses positioned so that the ship's status would be visible from both sea and air, and an identification number (for Centaur, 47) on her bows. At night, the markings were illuminated by a combination of internal and external lights. Data on the ship's markings and the layout of identifying structural features was provided to the International Committee of the Red Cross during the first week of February 1943, who passed this on to the Japanese on 5 February. This information was also circulated and promoted by the press and media.|$|E
5|$|After {{being struck}} from the Naval Vessel Register in October 1941, and a brief, {{unsuccessful}} attempt at merchant service early in World War II, she {{was transferred to}} the War Department for use by the United States Army in November 1942. The ship was selected for employment as a Hague Convention <b>hospital</b> <b>ship</b> and renamed USAHS Larkspur. She made three round trips to the United Kingdom before an extended tour of duty in the Mediterranean.|$|E
50|$|Donegal {{was one of}} {{numerous}} ferries, many of them requisitioned from railway companies, that were converted into ambulance ships to carry wounded personnel from France back to Great Britain. Ambulance ships were classified as <b>hospital</b> <b>ships</b> under Hague Convention X of 1907 and as such were to be clearly marked and lit to make them easy to identify. Nevertheless, in the First World War the Imperial German Navy attacked and sank a number of British <b>hospital</b> <b>ships.</b> The UK Government then announced it would cease marking <b>hospital</b> <b>ships,</b> alleging that German vessels had used their markings and lighting to target them.|$|R

5|$|Assigned to the Atlantic Fleet, Mercy {{operated}} in the Chesapeake Bay area with Yorktown, Virginia, as her home port, attending the war wounded and transporting them from ships to shore hospitals. In October 1918 she sailed for New York {{to join the}} Cruiser and Transport Service. On 3 November the <b>hospital</b> <b>ship</b> departed New York {{on the first of}} four round trips to France, returning 1,977 casualties by 25 March 1919.|$|E
5|$|From New York, Blanche F. Sigman {{made three}} sojourns, calling at Cherbourg {{for a third}} time, Bremerhaven three times, The Downs, and Le Havre. While in Europe during the third trip, the ship was {{decommissioned}} as a <b>hospital</b> <b>ship</b> in April 1946 and returned to New York with a load of Army and Red Cross nurses, {{and members of the}} Women's Army Corps. Throughout 1947 and into 1948, the Sigman made numerous trips for the Army, primarily between Bremerhaven and New York.|$|E

Johnson was recognized and helped by acquaintance and fellow Freemason, Alexander McDowell McCook, a Union general. However, Johnson died aboard the Union <b>hospital</b> <b>ship</b> Hannibal, and the provisional government of Kentucky was left leaderless.|$|E

5|$|Hermes was berthed in Trincomalee on 8 April when {{a warning}} of an {{approaching}} Japanese fleet was received, and she sailed that day for the Maldives with no aircraft on board. On 9 April a Japanese scout plane spotted her near Batticaloa, and she was attacked by several dozen dive bombers shortly afterwards. With no air cover, the carrier was quickly sunk by the Japanese aircraft. Most of the survivors were rescued by a nearby <b>hospital</b> <b>ship,</b> although 307 men from Hermes {{were lost in the}} sinking.|$|E
5|$|In January 1943, Centaur {{was handed}} over to the Australian {{military}} for conversion into a <b>hospital</b> <b>ship,</b> as the ship's small size made her suitable for operating in Maritime Southeast Asia. The refit (including installation of medical facilities and repainting with Red Cross markings) was completed in March, and the ship undertook a trial voyage: transporting wounded from Townsville to Brisbane, then from Port Moresby to Brisbane. After replenishing in Sydney, Centaur embarked the 2/12th Field Ambulance for transport to New Guinea, and sailed on 12 May. Before dawn on 14 May 1943, during her second voyage, Centaur was torpedoed and sunk by a Japanese submarine off North Stradbroke Island, Queensland. The majority of the 332 aboard died in the attack; the 64 survivors were discovered 36 hours later. The incident resulted in public outrage as attacking a <b>hospital</b> <b>ship</b> is considered a war crime under the tenth 1907 Hague Convention. Protests were made by the Australian and British governments to Japan and efforts were made to discover the people responsible so they could be tried at a war crimes tribunal. In the 1970s the probable identity of the attacking submarine, I-177, became public.|$|E
5|$|On 20 December, UB-10 sank {{the last}} two ships under Steinbrinck's command.
