25|$|In the United States, {{cooling water}} intake {{structures}} are {{regulated by the}} Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). These structures can have the same impacts to the environment as desalination facility intakes. According to EPA, water intake structures cause adverse environmental impact by sucking fish and shellfish or their eggs into an industrial system. There, the organisms may be killed or injured by heat, physical stress, or chemicals. Larger organisms may be killed or injured when they become trapped against screens {{at the front of}} an <b>intake</b> <b>structure.</b> Alternative intake types that mitigate these impacts include beach wells, but they require more energy and higher costs.|$|E
