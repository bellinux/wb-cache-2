5000|$|All taxpayers {{claiming}} {{deductions for}} depreciation must adjust those deductions in computing AMT income {{to the amount}} of deduction allowed for AMT. [...] For AMT purposes, depreciation is computed on most assets under the straight line method using the class life of the asset. When a taxpayer is required to recognize gain or loss on disposal of a <b>depreciable</b> <b>asset</b> (or pollution control facility), the gain or loss must be adjusted to reflect the AMT depreciation amount rather than regular depreciation amounts. [...] This adjustment also applies to additional amounts deducted in the year of acquisition of the assets. For more details on these calculations, see MACRS.|$|E
5000|$|In {{determining}} the profits (net income) from an activity, the receipts from the activity must {{be reduced by}} appropriate costs.

[...] Such cost so allocated in a given period is equal to the reduction in the value placed on the asset, which is initially equal to the amount paid for the asset and subsequently {{may or may not be}} related to the amount expected to be received upon its disposal. Depreciation is any method of allocating such net cost to those periods in which the organization is expected to benefit from use of the asset. The asset is referred to as a <b>depreciable</b> <b>asset.</b> Depreciation is technically a method of allocation, not valuation, even though it determines the value placed on the asset in the balance sheet.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} {{is to develop a}} normative capital maintenance model for <b>depreciable</b> <b>assets</b> during a time of inflation. This model is developed on a stipulated physical capital maintenance concept that accumulated depreciation {{at the end of an}} asset 2 ̆ 7 s useful life should be equal to the funds required to replace the asset with a new one of comparable capacity. The soundness of this stipulation is supported by analyses of widely publicized theoretical models and promulgations of standards setting bodies in several countries. A key innovative factor in the model is provision for backlog depreciation as a charge against income. Backlog depreciation is the difference between the depreciation charges that would otherwise be made over the life of the asset and its net replacement cost. The model is developed first for a simple situation where <b>depreciable</b> <b>assets</b> are purchased from a local market. This permits demonstration of the efficacy of backlog depreciation and other somewhat innovative factors. Cognizance is then taken of the following features of the international trade for depreciable assets: (a) the country that is self-sufficient in <b>depreciable</b> <b>assets</b> does not exist in contemporary economic life, (b) different countries experience different inflation rates, and (c) the exchange rates between currencies fluctuate through time. The model is, accordingly, extended to cope with <b>depreciable</b> <b>assets</b> purchased from a foreign country by adding: (1) the price increase of the asset in a foreign market, and (2) the changes in the exchange rates between currencies as two vital dimensions in the model. Each of the following situations involving foreign exchange and acquisition of <b>depreciable</b> <b>assets</b> from another country is analyzed under the extended model: (1) forward exchange rate with fixed or certain prices, (2) forward exchange rate with uncertain changing prices, and (3) current spot trade with uncertain changing prices. ...|$|R

40|$|Generally {{accepted}} depreciation methods do not {{compute the}} intrinsic {{value of an}} asset, as they do not factor for the Time Value of Money, a key principle within financial theory. This is disadvantageous, as knowing the intrinsic value of an asset can assist with making effective purchase and sale decisions. By applying the Time Value of Money principle to deprecation and book valuation, methods can be formulated to approximate the intrinsic valuation of a <b>depreciable</b> <b>asset,</b> which improves the capacity for buyers and sellers of assets to make rational decisions. A deprecation method is formulated within, which aims to better match book value with intrinsic value. While this method makes many assumptions and thus has limitations, more complex formulas, which factor for {{a greater number of}} variables, can be created using a similar approach, to produce better approximations for intrinsic value.

40|$|The present paper amends the two propositions in Peasnell (1995) {{concerning}} the fitness of J. R. Grinyer’s ‘earned economic income’ (EEI) model for its declared purpose of evaluating managerial {{performance in the}} light of comments in Grinyer (1995). Proposition I now includes the requirement that the profitability index is the same for each <b>depreciable</b> <b>asset</b> in the multi-asset firm in order for EEI to yield the same answers as the net present value (NPV) of the firm itself. Proposition II is now adjusted to reflect the possibility that errors in forecasted benefits can be large in magnitude. The new version distinguishes between random forecast errors and ‘earnings management’. The original result {{concerning the}} conditions when EEI will be more or less reliable than re-computed NPV holds as far as random forecast errors are concerned. In the case of management manipulations, the results depend on whether the investment is believed by management to be worthwhile and on whether the forecast biases are sufficient to turn a poor performance into a good one.

40|$|Investors in <b>depreciable</b> <b>assets</b> {{used in a}} {{trade or}} {{business}} claim depreciation deductions following investment, and upon sale or other disposition of their assets are taxed on gain or loss equal to differences between amounts realized and adjusted basis. The taxation of these realized gains and losses is asymmetric: losses are deductible against ordinary income, whereas {{a portion of the}} gain on sales of personal property, and virtually all gains on sales of real property, are taxed at more favorable capital gain tax rates. Evidence from U. S. tax returns in 2012 indicates that the aggregate annual magnitude of the tax saving due to the asymmetric taxation of these gains and losses is relatively modest, roughly between $ 800 million and $ 1. 71 billion. This paper considers the policy basis of this asymmetric tax treatment, noting that depreciation rules together with the elective nature of sale and realization implies that the tax system inefficiently discourages sales of <b>depreciable</b> business <b>assets</b> on which taxpayers have unrealized gains. In order to maintain efficient reallocation of used assets it is necessary to tax realized gains rather lightly. Taxpayers with unrealized losses on depreciable property have the option of retaining or discarding the property, in the first case claiming subsequent depreciation deductions against ordinary income and in the second claiming an immediate ordinary loss. The availability of these options implies that limiting the tax rate applicable to deductions for losses on sales of <b>depreciable</b> <b>assets</b> again would also inefficiently discourage asset sales. Consequently, the elective nature of asset sales implies that an efficient system imposes asymmetric taxes on gains and losses from sales of <b>depreciable</b> <b>assets...</b>|$|R
