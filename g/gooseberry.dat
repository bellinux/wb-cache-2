5|$|Riesling {{wines are}} often {{consumed}} when young, {{when they make}} a fruity and aromatic wine which may have aromas of green or other apples, grapefruit, peach, <b>gooseberry,</b> honey, rose blossom or cut green grass, and usually a crisp taste due to the high acidity. However, Riesling's naturally high acidity and range of flavours make it suitable for extended aging. International wine expert Michael Broadbent rates aged German Rieslings, some hundreds of years old, highly. Sweet Riesling wines, such as German Trockenbeerenauslese are especially suited for cellaring since the high sugar content provides for additional preservation. However, high quality dry or off-dry Riesling wine is also known to have not just survived but also been enjoyable at an age exceeding 100 years.|$|E
5|$|In {{his spare}} time, Wright {{developed}} a fruit farm {{on the property}} with over a thousand fruit trees and bushes that he ordered from Jens Jensen in 1912. It is unknown exactly how many were planted, because part of the order was destroyed during a railroad strike. Wright requested two hundred and eighty-five apple trees planted, including one hundred McIntosh, fifty Wealthy, fifty Golden Russet, and fifty Fameuse. Among the bushes were three hundred <b>gooseberry,</b> two hundred blackberry, and two hundred raspberry. The property also grew pears, asparagus, rhubarb, and plums. The fruit and vegetable plants were placed along the contour of the estate, {{which may have been}} done to mimic the farms he saw while in Italy. Wright also dammed a creek on the property to create an artificial lake, which was stocked with fish and aquatic fowl. This water garden, probably inspired by the ones he saw in Japan, created a natural gateway to the property.|$|E

5|$|In mid-1917, the Australians {{were moved}} to Belgium {{as the focus of}} British {{operations}} shifted to the Ypres sector in an effort to draw German attention away from the French. The first effort came around Messines, on the southern flank, where a series of tunnels were dug under the German lines. On 7 June, 19 mines were detonated and in the ensuing fighting, the British captured Messines Ridge. Assigned a support role, the 15th Battalion was held in reserve and did not take part in the attack. The following day, it was committed to hold the gains that had been made during the attack, relieving the New Zealanders around <b>Gooseberry</b> Farm. The 15th remained in the Ypres sector and subsequently took part in the fighting around Polygon Wood during the Third Battle of Ypres in September. In November 1917, the battalion was withdrawn from the line for a three-month rest, spending the winter around Templeux-la-Fosse and Hollebeke.|$|E

40|$|This diploma´s thesis {{deals with}} the {{determination}} of total antioxidant activity of red and white <b>gooseberries</b> and red, white and black currants. There are available information about small fruits, an overview of natural and synthetic antioxidants and {{a summary of the}} methods to determine the total antioxidant activity in the theoretical part. Frozen fruit samples were provided by Research and Breeding Institute of Pomology Holovousy Ltd. in the project QI 111 A 141 – Research of new technologies in the cultivation of <b>gooseberries</b> and currants with a focus on quality and use of fetuses (Ministry of Agriculture). The total antioxidant activity of red and white <b>gooseberries</b> and currants was measured by spectrophotometric methods using free radicals ABTS•+ and DPPH and was expressed as a Trolox equivalent. The total antioxidant activity of black currants was measured by electron paramagnetic resonance using free radicals ABTS•+ and DPPH and expressed as a TEACABTS and a TEACDPPH. There were measured 8 species of red <b>gooseberries,</b> 6 species of white <b>gooseberries,</b> 12 species of red currants, 6 species of white currants and 8 species of black currants in this thesis. The highest values of total antioxidant activity showed species of red and white <b>gooseberries</b> Alan, Karmen, Pax and Invicta and species of red and white currants Rovada, Orion and Olin. Among black currants, species Ometa and Ruben had the highest values of total antioxidant activity...|$|R

40|$|Red {{currants}} (Ribes rubrum L.), black currants (Ribes nigrum L.), red {{and green}} <b>gooseberries</b> (Ribes uva-crispa) were evaluated for the total phenolics, antioxidant capacity based on 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging assay and functionality such as in vitro inhibition of alpha-amylase, alpha-glucosidase and angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) relevant for potential management of hyperglycemia and hypertension. The total phenolics content ranged from 3. 2 (green <b>gooseberries)</b> to 13. 5 (black currants) mg/g fruit fresh weight. No correlation was found between total phenolics and antioxidant activity. The major phenolic compounds were quercetin derivatives (black currants and green <b>gooseberries)</b> and chlorogenic acid (red currants and red <b>gooseberries).</b> Red currants had the highest alpha-glucosidase, alpha-amylase and ACE inhibitory activities. Therefore red currants could be good dietary sources with potential antidiabetes and antihypertension functionality to compliment overall dietary management of early stages of type 2 diabetes.

40|$|For two {{successive}} years <b>gooseberries,</b> ‘Achilles’ {{were stored}} at 1 °C in regular air (control) and under six various CA conditions (%CO 2 + %O 2 : 6 + 18; 12 + 18; 18 + 18; 12 + 2; 18 + 2 and 24 + 2). Results showed that air storage {{is not appropriate}} to handle <b>gooseberries</b> due to a drastic reduction in fruit firmness (25 % lower than CA-treatments), darkening of fruit colour, mealy texture, and lower acidity level. Low oxygen storage in combination with high CO 2 concentrations (18 % or more) of <b>gooseberries</b> also gave bad results, mainly due {{to the development of}} off-flavours in fruits. However, results showed that increasing CO 2 -concentration up to 12 % did not induce the development of off-flavour. It seems that the tolerance concentration for <b>gooseberries</b> in respect to CO 2 lies between 12 - 15 %, since fruits stored under 18 % CO 2 combined with 18 % O 2 were evaluated to be good fruits, although a slight off-flavour was noticed by panelists. Consequently, the storage of <b>gooseberries</b> ‘Achilles’ under 12 - 15 % CO 2 combined with 18 % O 2 for up to seven weeks can be recommende...|$|R
