25|$|The {{territory}} {{shown in}} the seven Qin maps overlap each other. The maps display tributary river systems of the Jialing River in Sichuan province, in a total measured area of 107 by 68km. The maps featured rectangular symbols encasing character names for the locations of administrative counties. Rivers and roads are displayed with similar line symbols; this makes interpreting the map somewhat difficult, although the labels of rivers placed in order of stream flow are helpful to modern day cartographers. These maps also feature locations where different types of timber can be gathered, while two of the maps state the distances in mileage to the timber sites. In light of this, these maps are perhaps the oldest <b>economic</b> <b>maps</b> in the world since they predate Strabo's <b>economic</b> <b>maps.</b>|$|R

In 1946 he released the book Pionertid, [...] "Pioneer Time", together with Viggo Widerøe, chronicling their time as pioneers of aviation in Norway. In 1951-1952 {{he was a}} member of an aerial expedition to Antarctica, as a part of the larger Norwegian-British-Swedish Antarctic Expedition. The small mountain Skappelnabben was discovered and named after him. In 1953 he made an advance to launch a program for <b>economic</b> <b>mapping.</b> This was his second advance; a proposal in 1937 led to some work being done by a committee, but it was hampered by World War II. Skappel's second advance led to a committee being formed in 1957, and <b>economic</b> <b>mapping</b> was eventually started by Norges Geografiske Oppmåling, however as late as in 1964. Skappel retired from the professional life in 1975.|$|R

5000|$|Annelöv {{was founded}} during the Middle Ages as a linear village. The church {{is from the}} 1100 century. The village was {{established}} along thoroughfare street and this is still preserved. Annelöv was once a major center {{for part of the}} county and the neighboring counties. Here {{there have been a number}} of shops and artisans, school, poor and prison, marketplace and which also housed the sessions-hall and ride station. Enskiftet was conducted in 1806, and nine [...] "homestead" [...] or farms were then sealed in the village while all other farms were moved out. Of the <b>economic</b> <b>map</b> available from 1917 you can see that out of seven large farms in the village were only Ryttargården and Hästängen left. Hästängen is located just north of the Ryttargården. Annelöv had several common grounds. On these lands were, for example, gravel - and clay quarry, marketplace. And there are some commons as the village community to look, but is available to everyone in the village. The most common name is the place where a committee [...] "Galgbacken" [...] there. Gallows has a renowned history. Because Onsjö County District Courts Center was in Annelöv was also a place of execution - the gallows. Here, many have seen the end of their lives.|$|E

30|$|In a first step, seven {{well-established}} <b>economic</b> <b>mapping</b> {{techniques for}} visualizing and controlling processes {{were introduced to}} an interdisciplinary group in charge of providing interventional radiology services in a university hospital. The interdisciplinary group included referrers (physicians, nurses, and other staff in referring departments, e.g., vascular surgery), providers (interventional radiologists, nurses, technicians, and staff of the angiography suite), and specialists of the hospital’s controlling department. In a further step, one mapping technique (process mapping) was selected and applied to percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) and stent placement procedures {{in order to better}} visualize, better understand, and efficiently organize workflow.|$|R
40|$|The map is {{not simply}} a {{representation}} of existing space, or a mirror of the earth’s surface. It is rather a multi-faceted instrument expressing that the power to represent is the power to order, and that the rationality of geometrical space could influence people’s lived spaces through its role as a planning tool. These issues are discussed with three examples from Swedish modernity; the production of land survey <b>maps,</b> the early <b>economic</b> <b>mapping,</b> and the map’s role in welfare planning.

30|$|The main {{objective}} {{of the current study}} is formulated to help in the future water management of Egypt by developing a decision support system for calculating and producing irrigation water <b>economic</b> value <b>maps</b> for different crops all over Egypt. These maps {{could be used as a}} tool for evaluating the economic performance of water use in the crop production and help in proposing a new cropping pattern toward maximizing the economic value of irrigation water. The study approach consists of five stages: (1) develop a Decision Support System for Economic Value of Irrigation Water (DSS-EVIW); Microsoft Access and ArcMap 9.3 are applied to develop DSS-EVIM, (2) apply the developed DSS-EVIW in calculating and develop irrigation water <b>economic</b> value <b>maps</b> for 45 crops; the most essential crops in Egypt, (3) analyse the developed <b>economic</b> value <b>maps,</b> (4) identify the highest and lowest irrigation water economic value crops at each governorate of Egypt, and (5) illustrate the variation of the economic value of irrigation water in different regions of Egypt (lower, middle and upper Egypt).|$|R

5|$|Map-making in China {{preceded the}} Han dynasty. Since two 4th-century-BCE silk maps from the State of Qin (found in Gansu, {{displaying}} the region about the Jialing River) show the measured distance between timber-gathering sites, Mei-ling Hsu argues {{that these are}} to be considered the first known <b>economic</b> <b>maps</b> (as they predate the maps of the Roman geographer Strabo, c. 64 BCE– 24 CE). Maps from the Han period have also been uncovered by modern archaeologists, such as those found with 2nd-century-BCE silk texts at Mawangdui. In contrast to the Qin maps, the Han maps found at Mawangdui employ a more diverse use of map symbols, cover a larger terrain, and display information on local populations and even pinpoint locations of military camps. One of the maps discovered at Mawangdui shows positions of Han military garrisons which were to attack Nanyue in 181 BCE.|$|R
40|$|Selection of {{promising}} site for construction project is essential {{since it has}} strong linkage with service life of the project. Recent fast developments in construction technology demands a matching method for finding economic suitability since it has a strong connection with overall suitability of the project site; and when we characterize a site suitable for construction we definitely mean economic suitability, besides construction suitability. This research is about creation of <b>economic</b> suitability <b>map</b> of an area few kilometers north of Islamabad. A multi-prong comprehensive research methodology was adopted to accomplish the task. Subsurface soil investigation was done for complete 1 km x 1 km area to obtain geotechnical suitability of the site, thereafter, through economic evaluation of the project site was carried out and finally, based on economic factors, an <b>economic</b> suitability <b>map</b> was created for the area with the latest and {{state of the art}} computer software. The research is first of its kind to map the applied features of a social science. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{integrate}} {{information from}} several disparate data sources including agricultural statistics and remote sensing to quantify and map {{the distribution and}} dynamics of agricultural returns to land and water resources from 1996 / 1997 to 2000 / 2001 in the Murray–Darling Basin (MDB), Australia. Total profit to agriculture was estimated at AUD 3. 86 B in 1996 / 1997 and AUD 3. 73 B in 2000 / 2001. The mapping reveals a high spatial concentration of economic returns to land and water resources from agriculture. Dryland agriculture covers over 82 % of the study area. Irrigated agriculture covers 1. 7 % of the land area (2000 / 2001) but returns {{one third of the}} total profit to agriculture. We found that around 80 % of the profit to agriculture comes from just over 5 % of the land area. The results from this regional scale <b>economic</b> <b>mapping</b> can inform regulatory policy and public investments in natural resource management through targeting industries and regions that provide low marginal returns to the natural resource baseBrett A.
