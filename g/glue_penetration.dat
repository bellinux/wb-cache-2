40|$|The aim of my diploma thesis are methods {{which are}} able to {{describe}} durability aspects of glued wooden joints. The main objective are methods which primarily includes hygrothermal stress acting in the glued joint of wooden adherend and determine the service life of the specific glued joint by modelling based on Arrhenius relation and the other methods. Other part of this work is aimed to shear tests of the samples exposed to different thermal and humidity conditions and for individual sets of exposures determining the <b>glue</b> <b>penetration</b> depth into the wooden adherend by EPI fluorescent analysis. These analytic methods are used for quality check of the glued joints, which are mostly based on strength, chemical or structural parameters of the tested sample...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2010 In wood-based composites, the {{glue-line}} (interface) between wood-strands {{affects the}} stress transfer from one member to the next. The glue-line properties determine {{the rate of}} load transfer between phases and these properties depend on wood species, surface preparation, glue properties, <b>glue</b> <b>penetration</b> into wood cells, and moisture content of the wood. As a result, the strength and stiffness of the composites are significantly affected by the amount, distribution, and properties of the resin. In {{the first part of}} this research, the glue-line stiffness between wood strands was determined by experiments. The interfacial properties were calculated from experimental data on double lap shear (DLS) specimens. The results showed that in both normal and densified wood strands, resin coverage has a positive effect on the interfacial stiffness, and consequently on stiffness properties of wood-based composites. As adhesive coverage increased from discrete droplets (1...|$|E
40|$|Plywood {{is highly}} esteemed as a {{construction}} material. Yet, {{the influence of}} moisture on both strength and durability are important factors. Especially the dynamics of moisture desorption and absorption {{should be taken into}} account when assessing the quality of a panel, which is a fact for all panel materials. This paper therefore focuses on the monitoring of the moisture dynamics of plywood subjected to outdoor weathering and the evaluation of its internal structure using X-ray tomography. Visual inspection of the internal structure of panels sheds a light on some of the moisture dynamics phenomena, such as the fact that high absorbing panels seem to have failure of glue lines. The qualitative X-ray approach in this paper pinpoints at the value of such a ‘non-destructive’ inspection and in combination with quantification of glue line thickness, <b>glue</b> <b>penetration</b> and the monitoring of crack development linked to moisture dynamics, this can become a fundamental method for product optimisation...|$|E
40|$|Wood {{is one of}} the key raw {{materials}} that are used in constructions. The research of the adhesive joint properties is important to characterize the overall design of the wood construction. To achieve good joint performance and durability it is important to adhesive penetrate into wood substrate deep enough. Adhesive penetration is influenced by many factors such as wood, adhesive and process factors. The objective of the present paper is comparison of the polyurethane (PU) <b>glues</b> <b>penetration</b> depth into Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies) wood depending on applied pressure. Penetration depth of cured adhesive was determined using fluorescence microscopy. Obtained results of the bond-line width had the good correlation with applied pressure value...|$|R
30|$|It {{appears that}} finer {{roughness}} produced higher shear strength for planed specimens. In contrast, greater fibrillation level corresponding to higher surface roughness seems to generate better glueline shear strength and higher percent wood failure for sanded specimens. However, the correlation analysis between the surface parameters and shear strength revealed some statistically significant but very low correlation coefficients. Similar results {{were reported by}} Cool and Hernández [21]. According to Follrich et al. [1], tensile strength of joints increased with increasing surface roughness. Their finding was attributed to the enlarged surface and hence the enhanced bonding area facilitating mechanical interlocking between the adhesive and the wood surface. In contrast, lower roughness would decrease the mechanical anchorage of the surface. The molecules of the adhesive could also be too large to penetrate into the wood by the pits, which are generally aspired when kiln drying this wood species. As a consequence, <b>glue</b> <b>penetration</b> will be lower and glueline more affected during the aging treatment. Therefore, {{a certain level of}} roughness would be desirable to improve bonding of black spruce surfaces with the adhesive studied. Thus, a grit size of 80 was the most suitable for producing wood surfaces with adequate glueline performance when sanding black spruce. Similar results were reported by Shida and Hiziroglu [2] for four Japanese wood species.|$|E
40|$|Gluing of {{wood with}} great {{moisture}} content has challenge of water interaction with glue to give unwanted changes in glue properties and formed bond-line. Rheological measurements of polyurethane glues are sufficiently effective method {{to understand the}} polymer curing process and viscoelastic properties. Gel formation point is important parameter for a glue {{from the point of}} its application. When glue reaches the gel formation point, its viscosity drastically increases so that it could not properly wet the wood and it can result in poor bonds. One-component moisture curing polyurethane glues require water molecules for the polyadditional reaction. When water is involved in the curing reaction, it reacts with the isocyanate groups of glue and can lead to the formation of excessive carbon dioxide and thus can lead to <b>glue</b> <b>penetration</b> out of bond-line, additional backpressure. The dynamic viscoelastic parameters such as complex dynamic viscosity (ή), phase angle (δ), elastic storage modulus (G”), the viscous loss modulus (G”) of two kinds of polyurethane glues depending on added water amount (from 0. 9 % to 10. 0 %) at a constant frequency and deformation (oscillation mode) were determined using rheometer. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate impact of added water on rheological behavior of polyurethane glues. At the end of this study it was concluded that tested glues indicated various behavior depending on chemical composition and added water content. Gel formation point is higher in case of GlueI. However, gel formation time was higher in case of GlueII and was not dependent on added water content. Gel formation time was faster for GlueII. Nevertheless, faster formed gel is stronger than longer formed gel of GlueI...|$|E
40|$|Adhesive bookbinding, {{a method}} of holding trimmed pages {{together}} in a book using hotmelt glue, offers rapid binding and curing time, but has the disadvantage of poor <b>glue</b> <b>penetration</b> into the paper edges. A weak binding will result unless good linkage can be made between paper and glue, which is the objective of spine-roughening treatments. Eight spine-roughening treatments from three manufacturers were compared on an uncoated and a coated paper stock, against a control treatment of trimmed paper. Treatments were studied by light- and scanning electron microscopic examination of paper edges and by measurement of the mean page-pull values based on samples of 30 or more page-pulls. The results were compared with four hypotheses concerning bookbinding strength. First, when 95 percent confidence intervals were compared, different spine-roughening treatments were found to produce different bookbinding strengths, as measured by mean page-pull value. Specifically, {{almost all of the}} treatments produced higher page-pull values than the control, showing that these roughening treatments increased book strength. Some treatments produced significantly higher page-pull values than others, indicating that some roughening treatments were better than others for binding the two papers studied. The results of these tests are summarized in the table {{at the top of the}} next page. Secondly, comparing mean page-pull values ranked on the uncoated stock with those of the coated stock, the relatively low correlation of 0. 66 indicated that a spine-roughening treatment appropriate for one kind of paper may not be suitable for another kind of paper. One treatment produced the highest page-pull value on both papers, however, indicating that its edge geometry produced a strong bond in both papers studied. Table of Spine-Roughening Treatments with Page-Pull Values and Duncan Groupings. Ranked by Uncoated Paper: (Treatment, Mean Page-Pull Value, Duncan 1 Groupings) : ((Control) # 1, 2. 12 lb/in, F), (# 48, 2. 36, F E), (# 2, 2. 62, D E), (# 16, 2. 88, D C), (# 24, 3. 14, B C), (# 20, 3. 26, B), (# 3, 3. 34, B), (# 30, 3. 42, B), (# 10 3. 74 A). Ranked by Coated Paper: (Treatment, Mean Page-Pull Value, Duncan 1 Groupings) : ((Control) # 1, 0. 74, E), (# 2, 0. 78, E), (# 30, 0. 95, D), (# 48, 1. 09, D C), (# 3, 1. 16, C), (# 20, 1. 20, C), (# 16, 1. 36, B), (# 24, 1. 43, B), (# 10, 1. 61, A). 1 Duncan groupings indicate means which are not significantly different. Thirdly, two page-pull testers commonly used to measure page pull were compared using the Mandrell Sensitivity Analysis, which considers sensitivity to the measured attribute along with consistency of measurement. The Martini Tester was shown to be approximately 1. 5 times, or barely significantly, more sensitive than the Moffett Tester. Fourthly, three spine-roughening treatments were compared for book strength vs. production speed. Some treatments-those in which the edge-weakening effect of pattern undercutting was apparent produced higher page-pull values as production speed increase...|$|E
40|$|In a {{previous}} research project, carried {{out during the}} years 2006 - 2008, the possibility to manufacture wet glued laminated beams using ungraded laminations of Norway spruce side boards was investigated with very promising results. In the project presented in this report, {{the performance of the}} wet glued beams has been further investigated and developed as regards grading of side board laminations, bond line properties and lamination finger jointing. The possibility to use scanning equipment for measurement of fibre angles and prediction of strength and stiffness of boards and beams has been studied and the procedures for technical approval and CE marking have been probed into. Studies concerning market and economy for the beams and layouts for a pilot plant and a full capacity plant, respectively, for production of such beams have also been carried out. The possibility to grade side boards in the wet state using axial dynamic excitation was investigated with a positive result. From such excitation, a board’s stiffness (modulus of elasticity) could be determined. Accordingly, grading criteria regarding axial stiffness, and knot size, was applied to grade side board laminations into two classes; outer and inner laminations. Strength and stiffness tests of beams manufactured from such graded laminations showed that the beams actually could challenge first rate glulam and LVL products available on the market. Regarding beam shape and shape stability, cross section cupping may need further attention. Even if this deformation was small, it was still visible to the naked eye. The problem could probably be overcome if the beams are dried to a moisture content of 12 - 14 % before planing. Results of shear tests show that green glued bond lines can fulfil strength requirements for glulam. However, delamination requirements for service class 3 (outdoors) were not fully met. From small scale tensile testing of glued bonds it was concluded that green glued bonds with high density wood have the same tensile strength and fracture energy as dry glued bonds. For bonds with low density wood and/or small amount of adhesive, the tensile strength could be lower than for dry glued bonds, whereas the fracture energy was on a similar level. Strength testing of wet and dry glued finger joints demonstrated that joints glued from high density wood was significantly stronger than low density joints {{and that there was no}} significant difference between the strength of green glued joints and joints glued after drying. From X-ray measurement it was shown that the <b>glue</b> <b>penetration</b> into the wood fibres is much deeper in a green glued joint than in a joint that is glued in the dried state. From scanning algorithms developed within the scope of this project it is possible to obtain reasonably accurate predictions of grain-angle distributions on board surfaces as well as rather accurate descriptions of knot locations and of fibre-angle disturbances around knots. From scanning of board ends, cross section characteristics with respect to radial and tangential directions and of annual ring widths could also be determined. Finally, both board and beam stiffness were predicted from this data, with an accuracy that is comparable with the one obtained from well-reputed commercial grading systems...|$|E
