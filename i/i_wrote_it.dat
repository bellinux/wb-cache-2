500|$|According to {{songwriter}} Neil Finn, the Crowded House song [...] "People Are Like Suns", from Time on Earth (2007), {{begins with}} lyrics {{inspired by the}} beginning of Saturday, stating [...] "...when <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>it,</b> I was reading Ian McEwan's novel Saturday, which begins with a man on his balcony watching a plane go down, so the first lines borrow something from that image." ...|$|E

500|$|Araya held {{concern about}} the lyrics that King penned to [...] "In the Name of God", voicing his opinion to guitarist Hanneman. King's {{viewpoint}} was; [...] "It's like, 'C'mon, man, you're in Slayer. You're the antichrist — you said it yourself on the first album!' You can't draw the line like that. Whether he agrees with it or not, he didn't write it — <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>it.</b> So you have to say, 'Well, it's {{just a part of}} being in this band.' Now Jeff and I, we don't give a fuck. If Jeff wrote something I had a problem with, I would never even raise a fucking finger. I'd be like, 'Fuck yeah, let's do it! Gonna piss someone off? Alright!'" ...|$|E

In an interview with [...] Vibe magazine, the musician commented, [...] "I was so happy after the fight that I ran upstairs in their house and wrote 'Speechless'. Fun inspires me. I hate to say that, because it's such a romantic song." [...] He added, [...] "But it was the fight that did it. I was happy, and <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>it</b> in its entirety right there. I felt {{it would be good}} enough for the album. Out of the bliss comes magic, wonderment, and creativity." [...] Jackson would consider [...] "Speechless" [...] to be one of his favorite songs on Invincible.|$|E
500|$|... "Ghost" [...] is a four-minute, eighteen-second song {{described}} by Vibe as an [...] "electro retro funk" [...] track with harmonies influenced from disco. [...] "Ghost" [...] is {{about wanting to}} [...] "disappear completely and start over" [...] again, as it was inspired by Dubuc relocating from Dallas to Los Angeles without letting anyone know. The concept of the song is sung in the hook [...] "This time I might just disappear." [...] He described it as [...] "really special song. The moment <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>it,</b> I thought, 'Wow, this could really be something." [...] Written and produced by Dubuc, the original mix that appears on Mystery Skulls' debut album Forever was mixed by Jeremy Wheatley for 365 Artists at 4db Studios in London, with Adam Looker assisting.

500|$|... "Get Back" [...] {{was written}} by Lovato, Joe Jonas, Nick Jonas and Kevin Jonas, and {{produced}} by the Jonas Brothers alongside John Fields. Lovato {{wanted to write a}} song about getting back together with someone, as she believed enough mean and heartbroken songs had already been made. She said, [...] "It's kind of a fun, upbeat song and it's kind of just fun to sing to the person that <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>it</b> about." [...] The Jonas Brothers provided backing vocals and guitars on the track. In addition to co-producing the song, Fields also provided bass, guitars and keyboards. Jack Lawless played the drums, and John Taylor contributed backing vocals and played the guitar. The song was released as the lead single for Don't Forget on August 12, 2008, in the United States and Canada via digital download. The edited Radio Disney version was released on the same day.|$|E
500|$|Having {{begun to}} write love songs that were {{directed}} at both God and a woman, with his White Album track [...] "Long, Long, Long", Harrison later cited alternative sources for his inspiration for [...] "Something". In early 1969, according to author Joshua Greene, Harrison told his {{friends from the}} Hare Krishna Movement that the song was about the Hindu deity Krishna; {{in an interview with}} Rolling Stone magazine in 1976, he said of his approach to writing love songs: [...] "all love is part of a universal love. When you love a woman, it's the God in her that you see." [...] By 1996, Harrison had denied writing [...] "Something" [...] for Boyd, adding that [...] "everybody presumed <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>it</b> about Pattie" [...] because of the promotional film accompanying the release of the Beatles' recording, which showed each member of the band with his respective wife.|$|E
500|$|Two musical {{works from}} this period stand out. With the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour nearing {{completion}} in Moscow in 1880, the 25th anniversary of the coronation of Alexander II in 1881, and the 1882 Moscow Arts and Industry Exhibition in the planning stage, Nikolai Rubinstein suggested that Tchaikovsky compose a grand commemorative piece. Tchaikovsky agreed and finished it within six weeks. He wrote to Nadezhda von Meck that this piece, the 1812 Overture, would be [...] "very loud and noisy, but <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>it</b> with no warm feeling of love, and therefore {{there will probably be}} no artistic merits in it." [...] He also warned conductor Eduard Nápravník that [...] "I shan't be at all surprised and offended if you find that it is in a style unsuitable for symphony concerts." [...] Nevertheless, the overture became, for many, [...] "the piece by Tchaikovsky they know best." ...|$|E

500|$|Refn chose Johnny Jewel of Desire and the Chromatics {{to score}} the film. He wanted {{electronic}} music {{and to have}} it be abstract, on occasion, so viewers can see things from the Driver's perspective. As Refn was going through mixer Jewel's catalog, he picked out [...] "Under Your Spell" [...] and [...] "Tick of the Clock" [...] because he thought of Drive being a fairy tale. During Drives climax, [...] "A Real Hero"'s keynote melody, about becoming [...] "a real human being, and a real hero", refrains because that is when the Driver displays both those characteristics. At first, Jewel worried that [...] "Under Your Spell" [...] might be too literal, but soon realized it is used in Drive [...] "in the exact same way that I was feeling it when <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>it.</b> He definitely got the nuance of the song, and understood what {{it was supposed to}} mean, and he wanted to give that emotion to the viewer, that same feeling." ...|$|E
500|$|... “I didn't {{write my}} raps down {{for my first}} four albums — like at all, I did it from the head {{straight}} to the booth. But on this last album, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>it.</b> I really put myself in the zone that my life was dependent {{on the success of}} this album. With that being the case, I said, ‘You know what? No matter what anybody says about me, they won’t — I can write something that can make someone that hates me the most have to really respect or love the song.’ So even a song like ‘Power,’ I spent 5,000 hours writing it, and it’s really the psychology behind the lyrics; it’s not just blatantly, ‘I’ve got all the power’ — ‘No one man should have all that power.’ It’s worded it in a really sensitive way that opens it up for everyone. Even if I use first person and say ‘I, I, I,’ it’s always for everyone." ...|$|E
500|$|... "I wrote a song a {{while back}} even before [...] "One Sweet Day" [...] {{and it was not}} my {{favorite}} song in the world, but <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>it.</b> Someone asked me to write a song and they told me the story, and you know {{it was kind of a}} moving concept or whatever. And I did it, and I was like you know it’s not necessarily what I like per se, but after doing the song over and over again and having people coming up to and saying, thank you for writing ‘Hero’ because it saved my life or it saved my father’s life or my brothers or sisters life, or something of that nature, I said I always have to sing that song when I’m performing because if I don’t, you never know who I’m leaving out and you know what, in times of my life I’ve had to turn to that song lyrically and flip it onto my own life and sing it to myself. So its from the ‘Music Box’ album, and it’s called ‘Hero', this is for you." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{song was}} written by Jason Wade, who {{originally}} finished the song {{in a hotel room}} after he visited a friend in Nashville who needed a kidney transplant. It was produced by John Fields and Scott Faircloff. In an interview with Alternative Addiction, Wade said, [...] "Broken is the song that moves me the most. <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>it</b> in Nashville, about 6 months ago. I was in my hotel room at 3 AM, I was out there visiting a friend... he’s really sick, he needs a kidney transplant." [...] Furthermore, he said, [...] "That [...] song just kinda fell in my lap, and I really haven’t written a song like that since 'Hanging by a Moment' where it just happened within a 15 minute time period." [...] Broken was released as the third single from the album on June 18, 2007. The song was then edited for radio to give it more of a [...] "rock" [...] feel and was released via digital download on July 8, 2008.|$|E
500|$|On September 22, Dylan {{appeared}} for {{the first}} time at Carnegie Hall, part of an all-star hootenanny. On this occasion, he premiered his new composition [...] "A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall", a complex and powerful song built upon the question and answer refrain pattern of the traditional British ballad [...] "Lord Randall". [...] "Hard Rain" [...] would gain added resonance one month later, when President Kennedy appeared on national television on October 22, and announced the discovery of Soviet missiles on the island of Cuba, initiating the Cuban Missile Crisis. In the sleeve notes on the Freewheelin album, Nat Hentoff quotes Dylan as saying that he wrote [...] "Hard Rain" [...] in response to the Cuban Missile Crisis: [...] "Every line in it is actually the start of a whole new song. But when <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>it,</b> I thought I wouldn't have enough time alive to write all those songs so I put all I could into this one". In fact, Dylan had written the song more than a month before the crisis broke.|$|E
500|$|Burt Reynolds makes a guest {{appearance}} on [...] "The Man from Jupiter", as the love interest of Malory Archer. His guest appearance was formally announced in October 2011. Prior to his appearance, Reynolds was referenced in several episodes of the series. Series creator Adam Reed opined: [...] "I {{think the only}} person on the planet who's a bigger fan of Burt Reynolds than me is Sterling Archer. Archer constantly tries to imitate Burt and always raves about Burt's movies and all-around awesomeness. So to have Burt recording voice-overs for the show was just amazing." [...] After receiving the episode's script from Reed, Reynolds made several edits; while editing the script of the episode, Reynolds added {{a scene in which}} Sterling reveals that his career choice was largely influenced by his films. [...] "We sent him the script beforehand and he noted the script up pretty good. But it was all to make it more self-deprecating." [...] Reed, a fan of Reynolds, said that working with him was a great experience. [...] "It was such a surreal experience being in the room with Burt Reynolds, my childhood hero," [...] he affirmed. [...] "Just hearing him read the stuff that <b>I</b> <b>wrote,</b> <b>it</b> was pretty great." ...|$|E
