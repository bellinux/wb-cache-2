25|$|As a {{practical}} matter, {{prior to the}} passage of Doddâ€“Frank, <b>investment</b> <b>advisers</b> were not required to register with the SEC if the <b>investment</b> <b>adviser</b> had fewer than 15 clients during the previous 12 months and did not hold itself out generally to the public as an <b>investment</b> <b>adviser.</b> The act eliminates that exemption, thereby rendering numerous additional <b>investment</b> <b>advisers,</b> hedge funds, and private equity firms subject to new registration requirements.|$|R
40|$|The article {{argues that}} a better {{approach}} for hedge fund regulation in the U. S. would be for law to regard private fund investors as clients of the managers of those funds. It discusses the regulatory regime governing <b>investment</b> <b>advisers.</b> The <b>Investment</b> <b>Advisers</b> Act of 1940 is tasked to regulate <b>investment</b> <b>advisers</b> and to require some <b>investment</b> <b>advisers</b> to be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) ...|$|R
2500|$|Title IV, or the [...] "Private Fund <b>Investment</b> <b>Advisers</b> Registration Act of 2010", {{requires}} certain previously exempt <b>investment</b> <b>advisers</b> {{to register}} as <b>investment</b> <b>advisers</b> under the <b>Investment</b> <b>Advisers</b> Act of 1940. Most notably, it requires many hedge fund managers and {{private equity fund}} managers to register as advisers for the first time. In addition, it increases the reporting requirements of investment advisors, and limits the ability of these advisors to exclude information in reporting to the various federal government agencies.|$|R

They are also called maintenance fees.|$|R
50|$|In the United States, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) regulates and {{oversees the}} {{activities}} of brokerage firms, and their registered representatives. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulates <b>investment</b> <b>advisers</b> and their <b>investment</b> <b>adviser</b> representatives. Insurance companies, insurance agencies and insurance producers are regulated by state authorities. <b>Investment</b> <b>Advisers</b> may be registered with state regulatory agencies, the Securities and Exchange Commission, or pursuant to certain exemptions, remain unregistered.|$|R
5000|$|In 2005, Vilar and Tanaka {{were convicted}} for {{organizing}} {{a series of}} transactions that defrauded their clients. [...] After the nine-week trial, Vilar was convicted of two counts of securities fraud; two counts of wire fraud; four counts of money laundering; <b>investment</b> <b>adviser</b> fraud; mail fraud; making false statements; and participating in a conspiracy to commit securities fraud, <b>investment</b> <b>adviser</b> fraud; wire fraud, mail fraud; and money laundering and Tanaka was convicted {{of three of the}} twelve counts with which he was charged: securities fraud; <b>investment</b> <b>adviser</b> fraud; and conspiring to commit securities fraud; <b>investment</b> <b>adviser</b> fraud; wire fraud; mail fraud; and money laundering.|$|R
50|$|The IAA {{mandated}} that all persons and firms receiving compensation for serving as <b>investment</b> <b>advisers</b> must {{register with the}} SEC. This requirement has been revised on several occasions since then, most notably {{with the passage of}} the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act of 2010. There are, however, several exceptions and exemptions to the registration requirement: <b>investment</b> <b>advisers</b> whose clients all reside in the same state as the adviser's business office and who do not provide advice on securities listed on national exchanges; <b>investment</b> <b>advisers</b> whose clients are solely insurance companies; and certain <b>investment</b> <b>advisers</b> who manage solely private funds holding less than $100 million from U.S. investors.|$|R
5000|$|Uniform <b>Investment</b> <b>Adviser</b> Law Examination, {{also called}} the Series 65 exam, is a test taken by {{individuals}} in the United States who seek to become licensed <b>investment</b> <b>adviser</b> representatives.

5000|$|The <b>Investment</b> <b>Advisers</b> Act (IAA) {{was passed}} in 1940 in order to monitor those who, for a fee, advise people, pension funds, and {{institutions}} on investment matters. Impetus for passage of the act began with the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 which authorized the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to study investment trusts. The thrust of this study, {{which led to the}} passage of the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the <b>Investment</b> <b>Advisers</b> Act, was to provide a closer look at investment trusts and investment companies. The study, however, found many instances of <b>investment</b> <b>adviser</b> abuse such as unfounded [...] "hot tips" [...] and questionable performance fees. The IAA sought not to regulate <b>investment</b> <b>advisers</b> so much as to keep track of who was in the industry and their methods of operation. The IAA does not mandate qualifications for becoming an <b>investment</b> <b>adviser</b> but it does require registration for those using the mails to conduct investment counseling business.|$|R
5000|$|A Registered <b>Investment</b> <b>Adviser</b> (RIA) is an <b>investment</b> <b>adviser</b> (IA) {{registered}} with the Securities and Exchange Commission or a state's securities agency. The numerous references to RIAs within the <b>Investment</b> <b>Advisers</b> Act of 1940 popularized the term, which is {{closely associated with the}} term investment advisor (spelled [...] "investment adviser" [...] in U.S. financial law). An IA is defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission as an individual or a firm that is in the business of giving advice about securities.|$|R

5000|$|Generally {{excluded}} from coverage under the act are those professionals whose investment advice to clients is incidental {{to the professional}} relationship. The IAA excepts [...] "any lawyer, accountant, engineer, or teacher whose performance of such services is solely incidental {{to the practice of}} his profession." [...] "Solely incidental" [...] is the key phrase. An accountant, for instance, who acts as an <b>investment</b> <b>adviser</b> is in fact considered to be an <b>investment</b> <b>adviser</b> under the act. If professionals are not to be considered <b>investment</b> <b>advisers</b> under the IAA: they must not present themselves to the public as investment advisers; any investment advice given must be reasonably related to their primary professional function; and fees for the [...] "investment advice" [...] must be based on the same criteria as fees for the primary professional function. The IAA, however, excludes from its definition of an <b>investment</b> <b>adviser</b> [...] "any broker or dealer whose performance of such advisory services is solely incidental to the conduct of his business as a broker or dealer and who receives no special compensation thereof". Banks, publishers, and government security advisers are also excepted from the act. People who call themselves [...] "financial planners" [...] may under certain circumstances be considered <b>investment</b> <b>advisers</b> under the act. The difference between a financial planner and an <b>investment</b> <b>adviser</b> {{as it relates to the}} IAA is also addressed in the aforementioned Release 1092.|$|R

40|$|Commission is reproposing a rule {{addressing}} {{the application of}} the <b>Investment</b> <b>Advisers</b> Act of 1940 to broker-dealers offering certain types of brokerage programs. Under the reproposed rule, a broker-dealer providing nondiscretionary advice that is solely incidental to its brokerage services is excepted from the <b>Investment</b> <b>Advisers</b> Act regardless of whether it charges an asset-based or fixed fee (rather than commissions, mark-ups, or mark-downs) for its services. The rule would also state that exercising investment discretion is not solely incidental to brokerage business, and thus, a broker-dealer providing discretionary advice would be deemed to be an <b>investment</b> <b>adviser</b> under the <b>Investment</b> <b>Advisers</b> Act. In addition, under the rule, broker-dealers would not be subject to the <b>Investment</b> <b>Advisers</b> Act solely because they offer full-service brokerage and discount brokerage services, including electronic brokerage, for reduced commission rates. Finally, the Commission is proposing to issue a statement of interpretive position that would clarify when certain brokerdealer advisory services, including financial planning, are solely incidental to brokerage business.
