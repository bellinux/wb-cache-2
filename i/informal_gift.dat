40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study is to {{identify}} perception of doctors and pharmacists on drug promotion practices adopted by pharmaceutical representatives. Material and Methods: A total of 72 pharmacists and 65 doctors responded to a questionnaire about their perceptions on drug promotion practices by pharmaceutical representatives, both in relation to pharmacists and doctors in the relationship. Variables such as age, work environment (urban, rural), seniority, were considered. Of all pharmacists who responded to the questionnaire, a percentage of 47. 8 % say they have no information about the existence of an ethical code of the pharmaceutical company, and 52. 1 % believe {{that there is such a}} code. Pharmacists estimated that over 75 % of pharmaceutical representatives promote clearly the products; the information provided is accurate, complete and balanced enough to compete. Meanwhile, the percent estimated by doctors is 73 %. <b>Informal</b> <b>gifts</b> are more often offered to doctors, in both category’s opinion. Conclusion: medical doctors have a more positive evaluation about pharmaceutical representative’s attitude than pharmacists...|$|R
25|$|According to Rapid Assessment surveys {{conducted}} by the World Bank Group in 2011 and 2012, business managers rank <b>informal</b> <b>gifts</b> or payments, anticompetitive practices and regulatory policy uncertainty {{high on the list}} of obstacles to creating and growing a business. These impediments have a chilling effect on foreign investment in Egypt which means that local businesses cannot be competitive in the international economy because of the high costs of raising capital. In addition, the amount of paperwork required for construction, imports, and exports is burdensome and the time for the government to process this paperwork is lengthy. Traders need to submit 8 documents to export and 10 to import—as opposed to France, for example, where only 2 documents are needed both for imports and exports. The high cost of doing business leads to fewer businesses operating within Egypt which causes unemployment. Egypt's unemployment rate reached 11.8 percent in the second quarter of 2011, down from 11.9 percent in the first quarter (although higher than last year's 8.96 percent). Additionally, there is no bankruptcy law in Egypt and entrepreneurs that fail to pay debts can face prison sentences.|$|R
40|$|Objective: This article {{reports on}} the {{reliability}} and validity of a new instrument called the Resource Generating Strategies (RGS) Scale, which was created to measure participation in the informal economy. Method: Researchers interviewed 285 adult women who had received domestic violence services, were currently incarcerated, or were residing in the community. Results: Five subtypes of informal economic activity are identified: (a) informal selling and exchange, (b) credit card use, (c) institutionalized <b>informal</b> economy, (d) <b>gifts</b> or loans from family and part-ners, and (e) illegal informal economy. Strong evidence is found for reliability and validity. Conclusions: This scale can be used to expand the knowledge base of practitioners and policy makers about the strengths and economic coping strategies of low-income individuals...|$|R
40|$|In {{the spring}} of 2015, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission brought two {{significant}} Foreign Corrupt Practices Act cases involving gifts, entertainment, and travel. The SEC brought the case of In the Matter of FLIR Systems involving FCPA violations concerning the financing of a “world tour” of personal travel for government officials. The SEC then filed the case of In the Matter of BHP Billiton involving FCPA violations concerning the sponsored attendance of foreign officials at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. These landmark cases affirm previous guidance by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the United States Department of Justice that gifts, entertainment, and travel given for corrupt and improper purposes will violate the FCPA. These cases also signify active involvement by United States regulators in pursuing violations under the FCPA for improper conduct concerning hospitality. This Article will provide an outline of the FCPA and emphasize the affirmative defense for certain “reasonable and bona fide” expenditures under the statute. The Article will then look at formal and <b>informal</b> guidance on <b>gifts,</b> entertainment, and travel as these subject matters relate to the FCPA. The Article will next discuss the recent FLIR and BHP Billiton cases. Finally, the Article will discuss key takeaways glanced from these cases, and the FCPA compliance measures that should be undertaken in the areas involving gifts, entertainment, and travel...|$|R
40|$|After a short {{theoretical}} introduction {{that highlights}} how field research in public street markets provides {{a contribution to}} economic-anthropological theories, street markets {{turn out to be}} characterized by a dense social interaction, and by complex intersections of multidirectional policies: within them, the effects of economic and administrative macro-policies imposed 'from above' are visible and, at the same time, in reverse, we can detect here aspects of the local social construction that from grass root level influences the exterior, both in forms of organized resistance against disadvantageous imposed policies, and by spontaneously shaping the social interaction pattern and the identity of the urban neighbourhoods where markets are sited. As arenas in which the possibility and the ability 'to negotiate' symbolic as well as economic values is constantly reproduced, the cultural 'immaterial' component of 'material' life is evident in public markets. As contexts in which different economies – capitalist and non-monetary, formal and <b>informal,</b> where the <b>gift</b> is a social and commercial strategy – are simultaneously ongoing, as spaces of interaction between highly heterogeneous socio-economical classes, between solidarity and exploitation, consumerism, reuse and saving, street markets are aggregates of apparently contradictory, but complementary social qualities. Such ‘disorder’ often makes them target of gentrification, transformation or limitations attempts, but the complexity of their polyhedral configuration seems to guarantee their persistence in history, as resistant forms of socioeconomical exchange, and rare contexts of urban social construction. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Transfers {{of money}} and help with daily {{activities}} by family and friends are important sources of support for older people and contribute to their well being. On the other hand, older adults are not only recipients of support but also important providers of support and financial transfers as giving and receiving are often reciprocal. For this, {{it is important to}} understand the determinants of receiving and giving money and help as well as the relationship between these two. Methods The aim of this paper is to explore the relationship between giving and receiving of the same or of different types of transfers as well as to get more insights in the motivation behind giving and receiving of money <b>gifts</b> or <b>informal</b> care. We use data from the Survey of Health Aging and Retirement in Europe and employ a multinomial logit model to analyse 16 different categories resulting from combining information on the incidence of giving and receiving of both informal care and financial gifts. Results We show that despite the differences that exist in the incidence of giving and receiving of both informal care and financial gifts there are clearly a few patterns that are consistent between the European countries in our analysis. Both ‘altruistic-like’ and ‘exchange-like’ motives are more likely to increase by age, gender and physical proximity of network members, while ‘reciprocal-like’ giving and receiving is more likely among females and those with a network at close distance. Conclusions Our results show that the incidence of <b>informal</b> care and <b>gifts</b> to and from older people is related to particular characteristics and transfers patterns. Further research should be dedicated to exploring the situations leading to the ‘altruistic-like’ and ‘exchange-like’ combinations of transfers...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{setting of}} {{realistic}} performance-based financing rewards necessitates not just knowledge of health workers' salaries, {{but of the}} revenue that accrues from their additional income-generating activities. This study examined the coping mechanisms of health workers in the public health sector of Nasarawa and Ondo states in Nigeria to supplement their salaries and benefits; it also estimated the proportionate value of the revenues from those coping mechanisms {{in relation to the}} health workers' official incomes. METHODS: This study adopted a mixed-methods approach, consisting of semi-structured interviews, a review of policy documents, a survey using self-administered questionnaires, and the randomized response technique (RRT). In all, 170 health workers (86 in Ondo, 84 in Nasarawa) participated in the survey. In-depth interviews were conducted with 24 health workers (12 per state) and nine policy makers from both states. RESULTS: The health workers perceived their salaries as inadequate, though most policy makers differed in this assessment. There appeared to be a considerable expenditure-income disparity among the respondents. Approximately 56 % (n[*]=[*] 93) of the study population reported having additional earning arrangements: most reported non-medical activities such as farming and trading, but private practice was also frequently reported. Half of the respondents with additional earning arrangements stated that their income from those activities was the equivalent of half or more of their monthly salaries. Specifically, 35 % (n[*]=[*] 32) said that they earned about half of their official monthly salaries and 15 % (n[*]=[*] 14) reported earning the same or more than their monthly salaries from these activities. Other coping mechanisms used by the health workers included prioritizing activities that enabled the earning of per diems, collecting <b>informal</b> payments and <b>gifts</b> from patients, and pilfering drugs from facilities. CONCLUSIONS: Predatory and non-predatory mechanisms accounted for the health workers' additional income. It may be difficult for the health workers to meet their expenses with their salaries and financial incentives; this highlights the need for the regulation of additional earnings and to implement targeted accountability mechanisms. This study indicates the value of using mixed methods when investigating sensitive issues. Future studies of this type should employ mixed methods for triangulation purposes to provide better insight into health workers' responses...|$|R
40|$|Food {{insecurity}} is {{a significant}} challenge in the world, and nowhere more than in subSaharan Africa. The policy options available to combat food insecurity have been expanding in recent years, providing increased flexibility over where-and what-food is procured, and what form of transfer recipients receive. In designing policies key questions arise related to the impacts of procuring food in developing countries, what recipients prefer to receive, and the relative impacts of cash versus food transfers. This dissertation takes a microeconomic approach to filling some of the gaps in our knowledge of food assistance policy impacts. In the first paper we exploit a unique natural experiment to assess the performance of local procurement in Burkina Faso, and to test a number of hypotheses and claims. We find that procuring locally saves time and cost, does not affect local food prices, and has positive impacts on smallholder suppliers. Recipients also prefer local commodities. In {{the second and third}} papers we develop a theoretical household model to investigate cash versus food transfers in Niger, taking advantage of a randomized trial and a large-scale household survey. The first paper examines the importance of the contents of the food basket. The model predicts that an extra-marginal transfer of a staple grain will have negative impacts on dietary diversity relative to a cash transfer, whereas an extra-marginal transfer of higher quality food will have positive impacts. I confirm that these predictions hold in Niger. The third paper examines the differential impacts of food versus cash transfers on <b>informal</b> credit and <b>gift</b> exchange. The model predicts that cash recipients {{will be more likely to}} use transfers to pay debts, and this impact will be more pronounced when food prices are rising, as the expectation of rising prices erodes the relative value of cash to food in terms of future consumption. Findings in Niger confirm these predictions, and highlight several implications of the relative scarcity of cash versus food. These papers inform food assistance policy in the Sahel, and provide a novel lens through which to understand the mechanisms behind food assistance policy impacts. 2020 - 01 - 2...|$|R
40|$|Key words : Vulnerability, HIV/AIDS, weather shocks, risk management, coping strategies, rural households, gender.   Empirical {{investigation}} on household’s responses to sources of vulnerability {{is important for}} designing and implementation of social policies. The design of an effective redistribution policy needs {{to take into consideration}} existing household and community systems, so as to build on the existing strengths without displacing households’ efforts. It is in this context that the current study investigates how farm households in rural Kenya respond to stressful events and the implications of the household’s risk management strategies on their welfare. The study examines two major sources of vulnerability for rural livelihoods: weather and HIV/AIDS. The importance of weather and HIV/AIDS lies in their impact on the most basic human need—food security. Weather uncertainties beget hunger. Hunger begets disease. When health-care provision is inadequate, hunger may interact with health problems to breed nutrition insecurity and therefore, more ill-health. For poor households, health problems present even a bigger threat to their livelihoods as their asset portfolio is highly skilled towards labour power. While many studies have focused {{on the extent to which}} households maintain stable consumption levels under stressful conditions, much less research is on the mechanisms by which consumption is smoothed. Using a framework that represents the interaction of a household’s portfolio with risk, this thesis explores both ex ante and ex post mechanisms for dealing with shocks and their accessibility to both male and females within a household. Ex post mechanisms include reliance on collective opportunities such as <b>informal</b> loans and <b>gifts,</b> while individual opportunities include asset and labour sales. While the results show that reciprocal transfers and labour markets are likely to play an important role in consumption smoothing, the effects of HIV/AIDS are similar to a common rainfall shock which is difficult to insure. The results show liquidity constraints to hamper the use of adult labour especially males’ as a consumption smoothing device. The ex ante mechanisms often involves building buffers. Buffer stocking often means sacrificing current consumption to secure future consumption. The sacrifice can be in form of holding less risky but low yielding assets or can mean securing consumption for some members of the households at the expense of those with less bargaining power. The study finds that households buffer stock in health and that a more uncertain future is associated with more liquid assets. The finding illustrates the existence of a link between risk, poverty and inequality. Demonstrating empirically the effect of risk and possible risk-coping strategies on inequality and poverty is a central challenge in the development literature. This thesis contributes to this literature and provides evidence at the intra-household level. ...|$|R
