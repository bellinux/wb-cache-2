In 1959, ORSORT accepted its first international enrollments. Applications to enroll required strict clearance from the Atomic Energy Commission. Tuition fees partially offset school operating costs. Courses listed in their 1965 curricula included Analysis, Chemical Technology, Economics of Nuclear Power, Engineering Science, Experimental Physics, Nuclear Systems Laboratory, Hazards Study, <b>Health</b> <b>Physics,</b> <b>Instrumentation</b> and Controls, Materials, Mathematics, Meteorology, Physics, Reactor Operating Experience and Shielding. Scientific and engineering graduates of the one-year program earned certificates of completion and were awarded the degree of Doctor of Pile Engineering (D.O.P.E.). ORSORT turned out up to 100 graduates a year, many of whom became leaders in the nuclear industry, such as a former Secretary of Energy, James D. Watkins. The total number of ORSORT graduates was 976. In addition to 19 US students from the Atomic Energy Commission, the Oak Ridge National Laboratory and US utilities, the last graduating class of 1965 included engineering and scientific personnel sponsored by their governments in Australia, India, Israel, Japan, Netherlands, Pakistan, Philippines and South Africa.|$|E

The hospital at that time had Marconi deep therapy X-Ray machines installed, with which Farmer was closely familiar from his time working at Marconi, {{and as a result}} the hospital was able to keep these machines in clinical use for many years. Farmer's team brough together experts in <b>health</b> <b>physics,</b> radio-isotopes, ultrasonics, <b>instrumentation</b> and physiological measurement. Specific innovations included the world's first gantry-mounted linear particle accelerator for cancer treatment, installed in 1963, and numerous clinical uses of the radioisotope tracer technique, developed using radio-isotopes from the nuclear reactors at Amersham and Harwell, which became available to researchers after World War II. When the new department opened, Farmer was appointed first Professor of Medical Physics at Newcastle University in 1966. While at the RVI, Farmer and his team turned the facility into a renowned centre for research into medical applications of radio-isotope technology, providing services in these areas to the entire region of Northern England, which had previously had none. At the time of Frank Farmer's retirement in 1978, the department had branches in Teesside and Cumbria, as well as the three hospitals in Newcastle, and employed 70 scientific and technical staff.|$|R
40|$|The DOE-Idaho Operations Office (DOE-ID) has {{prepared}} an environmental assessment (EA) on {{the replacement of}} the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory <b>Health</b> <b>Physics</b> <b>Instrumentation</b> Laboratory at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory (INEL). The purpose of this project is to replace the existing <b>Health</b> <b>Physics</b> <b>Instrumentation</b> Laboratory (HPIL) with a new facility to provide a safe environment for maintaining and calibrating radiation detection instruments used at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory. The existing HPIL facility provides portable health physics monitoring instrumentation and direct reading dosimetry procurement, maintenance and calibration of radiation detection instruments, and research and development support-services to the INEL and others. However, the existing facility was not originally designed for laboratory activities and does not provide an adequate, safe environment for calibration activities. The EA examined the potential environmental impacts of the proposed action and evaluated reasonable alternatives, including the no action alternative in accordance with the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) Regulations (40 CFR Parts 1500 - 1508). Based on the environmental analysis in the attached EA, the proposed action will not {{have a significant effect on}} the human environment within the meaning of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and 40 CFR Parts 1508. 18 and 1508. 27.

The proposed action is expected to begin in 1997 and will be completed within three years: design and construction of a new facility at the Central Facility Area of the INEL; operation of the facility, including instrument receipt, inspections and repairs, precision testing and calibration, and storage and issuance.

40|$|At {{the request}} of EM- 331, the Radioactive Waste Technical Support Program (TSP) is {{conducting}} an evaluation of data regarding past hazardous waste shipments from DOE sites to commercial TSDFs. The intent of the evaluation {{is to find out}} if, from 1984 to 1991, DOE sites could have shipped hazardous waste contaminated with DOE-added radioactivity to commercial TSDFs not licensed to receive radioactive material. A team visited Argonne National Laboratory, East (ANL-E) to find out if any data existed that would help to make such a determination at ANL-E. The team was unable to find any relevant data. The team interviewed personnel who worked in waste management at the time. All stated that ANL-E did not sample and analyze hazardous waste shipments for radioactivity. Waste generators at ANL-E relied on process knowledge to decide that their waste was not radioactive. Also, any item leaving a building where radioisotopes were used was surveyed using hand-held instrumentation. If radioactivity above the criteria in DOE Order 5400. 5 was found, the item was considered radioactive. The only documentation still available is the paperwork filled out by the waste generator and initialed by a health physics technician to show no contamination was found.
