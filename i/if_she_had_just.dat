500|$|A {{short film}} {{directed}} by Boyle and {{produced by the}} BBC, called Happy and Glorious (after {{a line in the}} national anthem), featured the character James Bond, played by current Bond actor Daniel Craig, entering the front gate of Buckingham Palace in a London black cab. [...] His entrance (accompanied by an arrangement of Handel's 'The Arrival of the Queen of Sheba') is noticed by Brazilian children (a nod to Rio de Janeiro, which was to be the next summer Games host city) in the throne room. Bond escorted Queen Elizabeth II (who played herself, acknowledging Bond with the words, [...] "Good evening, Mr Bond") out of the building and into a waiting AgustaWestland AW139 helicopter. The film followed the helicopter across London, with shots of a cheering crowd on The Mall, Nelson's Column, the Palace of Westminster with an animated Winston Churchill statue in Parliament Square, and of the Thames past the London Eye, St Paul's Cathedral, the financial district City of London (with 30 St Mary Axe in the background). [...] The helicopter then passed through Tower Bridge, accompanied by the Dambusters March. The film finished with Bond and the Queen apparently jumping from a real helicopter live above the stadium, accompanied by the [...] "James Bond Theme". The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, along with Rogge, were then introduced to the audience. [...] The Queen was wearing the same dress as in the film, as <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> arrived with James Bond.|$|E

Eve likes him very much and in the same book, buys him a scarf. He believes Eve to be a very determined and good person with a necessary dark streak in her that he respects.|$|R

60|$|Joan's present lay on {{the table}} near to her, as <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> folded it and placed it there: the little cap and the fine robe of lawn: as if for a king's child.|$|E
60|$|Florida {{started from}} her chair. A streak of {{sunshine}} pierced shutter and curtain. Her mother was supporting herself {{on one elbow}} in the bed, and looking at her as <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> called to her.|$|E
60|$|How {{the time}} sped! It seemed as <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> only <b>just</b> left the hotel, and already surely not {{a quarter of}} a mile away she could see glimmering the lights of the Place Namur, the half-way point of her walk.|$|R
6000|$|... “I’ve {{been here}} for some time,” Littlemore said, going forward rather {{deliberately}} {{to shake hands with}} her. He took it alertly, yet was more serious than she, keeping his eye on her own as <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been <b>just</b> a trifle dangerous. Such was the manner in which a duly discreet person would have approached some glossy graceful animal which had an occasional trick of biting.|$|R
40|$|In the Cornaro Chapel of the Church of Santa Maria della Vittoria in Rome is a {{masterpiece}} of baroque theater. Inside an altar niche, on a billowy white marble cloud, is {{the figure of a}} nun who looks as <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>just</b> fainted, or is about to.

Although Teresa had been the object of examination by the Inquisition and a controversial figure during her lifetime, she was canonized only 35 years after her death, the first and only Spanish woman to receive that honor. Following canonization, she came to be viewed as a swooning, ecstatic mystic, a miraculous healer, and a humble proponent of absolute orthodoxy and absolute obedience. 2 However, in recent years this stereotype <b>has</b> been challenged. <b>She</b> <b>has</b> become the focus of intense religious and historical criticism by scholars such as Jodi Bilinkoff, Gillian Ahlgren, Cathlee...|$|R

"Nor yet," [...] said Mrs. Pratchett, {{shutting}} {{her eyes}} and making as <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> took a pill of unusual circumference,--which gave a remarkable force to her denial,--"nor yet any servant in this house.

40|$|Original title: Verdeelde tijd. The {{idea that}} a woman should work {{part-time}} no longer raises any eyebrows in the Netherlands - not even <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>just</b> completed her education and does not yet have children; not even if her children are grown up and no longer need much looking after. Part-time working has become an intrinsic part of Dutch society. This report suggests that most women who work part-time do so from choice. It enables {{them to go to}} work whilst still having time for other things they also consider important. Partners and employers also seem to find it perfectly normal that women should work part-time. Yet the modest working hours of many women have increasingly come {{to be seen as a}} problem in recent years, especially by the Dutch government. Part-time working also <b>has</b> disadvantages, not <b>just</b> for the careers and economic independence of the women concerned, but also for the Dutch economy as a whole and for the sustainability of the welfare state. In the light of this, the government would like to see women, and especially those working just a few hours per week, to increase their working hours. This report reveals why women so often work part-time and what might motivate them to increase their working hours...|$|R

Bertalan was Emery Gondor's brother. After the Hungarian White Terror (1919 - 1920), he moved from Budapest to Vienna. Bertalan finally returned to Budapest once Austria was annexed in 1938. There he worked as an artist and an illustrator. During World War II, he was deported and conscripted into forced labor service in eastern Hungary. In March of 1944, Germany invaded Hungary and took control of the Hungarian ghettos and camps. Bertalan was then deported to Poland and placed in a camp called Harka.

[...] "Come up with me," [...] he said; and in one moment <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been swept up before him on the little horse's neck, and was flying so wildly over the Steppes that her breath and sense failed her, and she knew no more till she was safe by Mrs. Bunker's fireside again.|$|R
6000|$|But {{nobody knew}} the explanation. My aunt herself {{did not know}} what had happened. Nobody had seen the dog creep inside the crinoline. All that the people did see was a staid and eminently respectable middle-aged lady suddenly, and without any {{apparent}} reason, throw her umbrella down in the road, fly up the High Street at the rate of ten miles an hour, rush across it at the imminent risk of her life, dart down it again on the other side, rush sideways, like an excited crab, into a grocer's shop, run three times round the shop, upsetting the whole stock-in-trade, come out of the shop backward and knock down a postman, dash into the roadway and spin round twice, hover for a moment, undecided, on the curb, and then away up the hill again, as <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> only <b>just</b> started, all the while screaming out {{at the top of her}} voice for somebody to stop her! ...|$|R
60|$|This {{conversation}} is very characteristic of Lady Byron as showing her benevolent analysis of character, and the peculiar hopefulness <b>she</b> always <b>had</b> {{in regard to}} the future of every one brought in connection with her. Her moral hopefulness was something very singular; and in this respect she was so {{different from the rest of}} the world, that it would be difficult to make her understood. Her tolerance of wrong-doing would have seemed to many quite latitudinarian, and impressed them as <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> lost all <b>just</b> horror of what was morally wrong in transgression; but it seemed her fixed habit to see faults only as diseases and immaturities, and to expect them to fall away with time.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{loves me}} still!" [...] she whispered, {{and pressed her}} breast with {{clenching}} hands, and laughed in wild exultance, and paced her room like a caged lioness. It was as <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> awakened to the assurance she was beloved.

50|$|Lupe Velez (Yasmien Kurdi) is {{born into}} poverty but {{dreams of a}} better life. She cares for her {{crippled}} mother Metring (Gina Alajar) who is also her harshest critic. Poor, crippled persons normally engender feelings of pity, but Lupe's mother adds to the burden and is the metaphor that represents {{the title of the}} movie (Lupe carries her mother as she begs for alms). Lupe tries to make her mother see that there is still hope in life <b>if</b> <b>she</b> would <b>just</b> <b>have</b> the strength to believe in her own daughter. Lupe's childhood friend, Carding (JC De Vera), on the other hand, supports her in all of her ambitions and dreams.|$|R

6000|$|The elbow of Sybil {{rested on}} the arm of her chair, and her cheek upon her hand; as Egremont said these words she shaded her face, which was thus entirely unseen: for some moments there was silence.

Plainly she heard her lover whistle; and plainly Thady heard it too, for he kept his stick completely still, and took the pipe from his mouth: then the second whistle--then she heard Ussher's foot on the ground--heard him approaching, and saw his figure draw nearer; in vain she endeavoured to make signs to him, in vain she thought she whispered, [...] "keep back;" [...] for {{when she tried to}} speak, the words would not come.

6000|$|She {{produced}} this commodity on the spot--produced it, that is, in straight response to Kate's frank [...] "Well, what?" [...] The inquiry bore of course, with Kate's eagerness, {{on the issue}} of the morning's scene, the great man's latest wisdom, and it doubtless affected Milly a little as the cheerful demand for news is apt to affect troubled spirits when news is not, in one of the neater forms, prepared for delivery. <b>She</b> couldn't <b>have</b> said what it was exactly that, on the instant, determined her; the nearest description of it would perhaps have been as the more vivid impression of all her friend took for granted. The contrast between this free quantity and the maze of possibilities through which, for hours, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> herself been picking her way, put on, in short, for the moment, a grossness that even friendly forms scarce lightened: it helped forward in fact the revelation to herself that <b>she</b> absolutely <b>had</b> nothing to tell. Besides which, certainly, there was something else--an influence, at the particular juncture, still more obscure. Kate had lost, on the way upstairs, the look--the look--that made her young hostess so subtly think and one of the signs of which was that she never kept it for many moments at once; yet she stood there, none the less, so in her bloom and in her strength, so completely again the [...] "handsome girl" [...] beyond all others, the [...] "handsome girl" [...] for whom Milly had at first gratefully taken her, that to meet her now with the note of the plaintive would amount somehow to a surrender, to a confession. She would never in her life be ill; the greatest doctor would keep her, at the worst, the fewest minutes; and it was as <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> asked <b>just</b> with all this practical impeccability for all that was most mortal in her friend. These things, for Milly, inwardly danced their dance; but the vibration produced and the dust kicked up had lasted less than our account of them. Almost before she knew it she was answering, and answering, beautifully, with no consciousness of fraud, only as with a sudden flare of the famous [...] "will-power" [...] <b>she</b> <b>had</b> heard about, read about, and which was what her medical adviser had mainly thrown her back on.
