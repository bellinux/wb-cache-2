40|$|Protection from ototoxicity of {{intraperitoneal}} gentamicin in guinea pig. BackgroundAminoglycoside antibiotics {{are common}} to treat peritonitis and exit-site infections in patients on peritoneal dialysis. Ototoxicity (loss of hearing or balance) is a well-documented adverse effect of aminoglycosides, and severe ototoxic reactions have been noted in patients receiving these drugs by intraperitoneal lavage. We have proposed a free-radical hypothesis for the mechanism of aminoglycoside ototoxicity and suggested a therapeutic prevention by the concomitant administration of antioxidants or iron chelators. Here we investigate whether 2, 3 -dihydroxybenzoate can prevent the ototoxicity of intraperitoneal gentamicin. MethodsTwo strains of pigmented guinea pigs received daily intraperitoneal injections of gentamicin. Both strains developed ototoxicity, although different dosages were needed to produce similar auditory deficits (120 mg gentamicin base/kg body weight daily for 19 days vs. 135 mg/kg for 14 days). <b>Dihydroxybenzoate</b> was administered intraperitoneally once or twice daily. Auditory thresholds were measured by evoked brain stem response. Pathology was assessed as a loss of sensory cells in surface preparations of the organ of Corti. ResultsThe auditory threshold shifts and hair cell loss were similar to the pathology observed following subcutaneous injections of gentamicin. Animals sustained almost complete loss of outer hair cells in the basal cochlea and a progressive hearing loss with threshold shifts of 60 dB at 18 kHz. The concomitant administration of <b>dihydroxybenzoate</b> significantly attenuated the threshold shift to less than 30 dB and reduced the loss of hair cells. The treatment with <b>dihydroxybenzoate</b> did not affect serum gentamicin levels. ConclusionsAntioxidant therapy is a promising approach to prevent aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss following intraperitoneal application...|$|E

Correlation of viability studies and 55 Fe 3 + uptake experiments showed that killing by streptonigrin increased with an increase in 55 Fe 3 + uptake by the cells. Streptonigrin did not kill iron-starved mutants that were unable to import iron. The level of iron uptake by these mutants was manipulated by agents such as (i) the enterochelin biosynthetic precursors 2, 3 -dihydroxybenzoic acid (2 x 10 (- 5) M) and shikimic acid (2 x 10 (- 4) M), (ii) citrate (10 (- 2) M), which promotes iron uptake by an independent pathway, and (iii) the chelating agents desferrioxamine (2 x 10 (- 4) M) and orthophenanthroline (10 (- 4) M). Addition of the precursors shikimate and <b>dihydroxybenzoate</b> to strain AB 2847 (aroB) and <b>dihydroxybenzoate</b> to strain AN 193 (entA), allowing these strains to make enterochelin, resulted in an increase in Fe 3 + uptake and a corresponding sharp increase in killing by streptonigrin. Addition of enterochelin itself (10 (- 6) M) caused an even more pronounced effect. Studies on the effect of citrate in strain AN 102 (fep) showed that this mutant was not killed by streptonigrin (4 x 10 (- 5) M), even in the presence of citrate; however, overnight growth in citrate induced Fe 3 + uptake by means of the ferric citrate transport system and resulted in killing by streptonigrin.

40|$|Abstract. To {{study the}} role of (pro) {{collagen}} synthesis in the differentiation of rat L 6 skeletal myoblasts, a specific inhibitor of collagen synthesis, ethyl- 3, 4 <b>dihydroxybenzoate</b> (DHB), was utilized.

The approach is based on our recent demonstrations of a redox-active gentamicin-iron complex in vitro and partial attenuation of gentamicin-induced hearing loss by the iron chelators deferoxamine and 2, 3 -dihydroxybenzoate. In our study, guinea pigs receiving injections of gentamicin (120 mg/kg body weight daily 3 19 days) developed a progressive threshold shift reaching 50 to 70 dB at 18 kHz.

40|$|Background-Iron is an {{important}} modulator of lipid peroxidation, and its levels {{have been associated with}} the progression of atherosclerosis. Little is known about the possibility that this metal, when released fi om tissue stores, may modulate the reactivity of blood cell components, in particular platelets. Therefore, we investigated a possible link between iron, oxygen free radical formation, and platelet function. Methods and Results-Human whole blood was stimulated with collagen 2, mu g/mL, and an in irreversible aggregation with thromboxane (Tx) B- 2 formation was observed (15 +/- 4 versus 130 +/- 10 ng/mL), Deferoxamine (DSF), a specific iron chelator. and catalase, an H 2 O 2 scavenger, inhibited collagen-induced whole-blood aggregation. The aggregation was accompanied by an increase in hydroxyl radical (OH.) levels (30 +/- 8 versus 205 +/- 20 nmol/L <b>dihydroxybenzoates),</b> which were reduced by DSF and by 2 specific OH. scavengers, mannitol and deoxyribose. Iron (Fe 2 +) dose-dependently induced platelet aggregation, TxB(2) formation (6 +/- 2 versus 335 +/- 8 ng/mL), and protein kinase C (PKC) translocation from the cytosol to the cell membrane when added to platelets that have been primed with a low concentration of collagen (0. 2 mu g/mL). In the same system, an increase in OH. levels was observed (37 +/- 12 versus 230 +/- 20 nmol/L <b>dihydroxybenzoates).</b> Mannitol and deoxyribose, but not urea, were able to reduce OH. formation, PKC activation, and platelet aggregation. Selective inhibition of PKC activity by GF 109203 X prevented iron-dependent platelet aggregation without influencing OH. production. Conclusions-The present study shows that iron can directly interact with hum:ln platelets, resulting in their activation. Its action is mediated by OH. formation and involves PKC activity.

The sequence revealed that an independent protein-coding sequence corresponding to an EntG polypeptide was not situated in the genetic region between the entB and entA cistrons, to which the EntG- phonotype had been genetically localized.

Resting cells transformed monochlorophenols, 2, 6 -dichlorophenol, and 2, 3, 6 -trichlorophenol. Phenol and a number of phenolic compounds, including 4 -methylphenol, all of the monohydroxybenzoates, and several <b>dihydroxybenzoates,</b> were very good carbon sources for Azotobacter sp. strain GP 1. The organism utilized up to 800 mg of TCP per liter; the lag phase and time for degradation, however, were severely prolonged at TCP concentrations above 500 mg/liter. Repeated additions of 200 mg of TCP per liter led to accelerated degradation, with an optimum value of 100 mg of TCP per liter per h. TCP degradation was significantly faster in shaken than in nonshaken cultures. The optimum temperature for degradation was 25 to 30 degrees C. Induction studies, including treatment of the cells with chloramphenicol prior to TCP or phenol addition, revealed that TCP induced TCP degradation but not phenol degradation and that phenol induced only its own utilization.

40|$|When {{a strain}} (arcB-) of Escherichia coli, unable to {{synthesize}} the iron transport compound enterochelin, was transduced to tonB-, it became resistant to phage phi 80 and simultaneously lost the growth response to enterochelin {{and the ability}} to transport its iron complex. However, enterochelin precursors (shikimate and 2, 3 -dihydroxybenzoate) still supported growth, via the synthesis of enterochelin. <b>Dihydroxybenzoate</b> was a better growth factor at a low concentration than it was at higher levels. The evidence suggests that tonB- strains lack an outer membrane component necessary both for the uptake of ferric-enterochelin and for the adsorption of phage phi 80. Thus, although ferric-enterochelin cannot penetrate the cell surface from outside, the complex that is formed within the envelope is transported normally into the cell. The aroB-, tonB- mutant also lacked growth reponses to citrate and various hydroxamate siderochromes, which supported growth in the tonB+ parent strain via inducible transport systems for their ferric complexes. The aroB-, tonB- mutant was unable to transport iron in the presence of citrate, but the low-affinity uptake of uncomplexed iron and the transport of amino acids and phosphate were unimpaired.

We have overproduced and purified Fur protein and analyzed its interaction with the operator region controlling {{the expression of the}} <b>dihydroxybenzoate</b> siderophore biosynthesis (dhb) operon. The purified protein binds with high affinity and selectivity to the dhb regulatory region. DNA binding does not require added iron, nor is binding reduced by dialysis of Fur against EDTA or treatment with Chelex. Fur selectively inhibits transcription from the dhb promoter by ςA RNA polymerase, even if Fur is added after RNA polymerase holoenzyme. Since neither DNA binding nor inhibition of transcription requires the addition of ferrous ion in vitro, the mechanism by which iron regulates Fur function in vivo is not obvious. Mutagenesis of the fur gene reveals that in vivo repression of the dhb operon by iron requires His 97, a residue thought to be involved in iron sensing in other Fur homologs. Moreover, we identify His 96 as a second likely iron ligand, since a His 96 Ala mutant mediates repression at 50 μM but not at 5 μM iron.

The levels in subsequent CFFs decreased and reached the preischemic value, indicating that both metals appear in a burst at the resumption of coronary flow. When the first CFF was used in a reaction mixture containing ascorbate and salicylate, the latter underwent chemical hydroxylation and was converted to its <b>dihydroxybenzoate</b> derivatives. Likewise, this CFF promoted the ascorbate-driven DNA degradation. Subsequent 150 CFFs were serially collected and demonstrated low activities. Following 18 min of ischemia, the copper level in the first CFF of reperfusion was only 15 % over the preischemic value. In contrast, the mobilization of iron into coronary flow was significant but markedly lower than after 35 min. The levels of copper and the redox activity of the first CFF correlated well with the degree of loss of cardiac function, after 18 and 35 min of ischemia, respectively.

Rhizobium leguminosarum 116, an ineffective mutant strain with a defect in iron acquisition, was isolated after nitrosoguanidine mutagenesis of the effective strain 1062. The pop- 1 mutation in strain 116 imparted to it a complex phenotype, characteristic of iron deficiency: the accumulation of porphyrins (precursors of hemes) so that colonies emitted a characteristic pinkish-red fluorescence when excited by UV light, reduced levels of cytochromes b and c, and wild-type growth on high-iron media but low or no growth in low-iron broth and on solid media supplemented with the iron scavenger dipyridyl. Several iron(III) -solubilizing agents, such as citrate, hydroxyquinoline, and <b>dihydroxybenzoate,</b> stimulated growth of 116 on low-iron solid medium; anthranilic acid, the R. leguminosarum siderophore, inhibited low-iron growth of 116. The initial rate of 55 Fe uptake by suspensions of iron-starved 116 cells was 10 -fold {{less than that of}} iron-starved wild-type cells. Electron microscopic observations revealed no morphological abnormalities in the small, white nodules induced by 116.

Furthermore, these materials exhibit fascinating architectures with unusual bonding and coordination patterns. Besides aluminosilicate zeolites and metal phosphates, metal carboxylates constitute an important family of open-framework structures. In this thesis, results of investigations of a variety of open-framework metal carboxylates, as well as a new family of rare-earth sulfates are presented. More importantly, studies directed towards an understanding of the mechanism of formation of open-framework phosphates and carboxylates and the importance of synthesis parameters like temperature in determining the dimensionality of the products are discussed at length. After providing an introduction to open-framework compounds (Part 1), the thesis (Part 2) presents the results of the investigations of metal carboxylates employing both transition metal and rare-earth metal ions with various organic linkers, ranging from aromatic squarate dianion, aliphatic dicarboxylates like oxalate, adipate, succinate, aminocarboxylates (which contain both the amine and the carboxylate group in the same moiety) and dihydroxybenzoates. Some of these compounds have large channels, for example, both the lanthanum mixed aliphatic dicarboxylates, strontium <b>dihydroxybenzoate</b> etc. Some even show unusual properties, example, a mixed valent iron (II, III) glycinate has a perfect kagome structure and shows unusual magnetic properties, entirely different from those of ordinary Fe(III) kagome structures, copper derivative of 6 -amincaproic acid has large channels and remains crystalline porous even after dehydration, a cobalt oxalato-squarate has both oxalate and squarate moiety in the same structure, where the oxalate is produced in situ by the oxidation of squarate under hydrothermal conditions in the basic medium. While the phosphate and the silicate anions are the most common basic building units in open-framework inorganic structures, the possibility of building open architectures with the sulfate anion as the basic building unit has been explored in Part 3. The results have been rewarding and both layered and three-dimensional rare-earth sulfates with large channels and possessing a α-Po structure or (6, 3) nets with continuous M-O-M connectivity in two dimensions have been obtained. The most intriguing question in the area of open-framework structures relates to the mode of formation. In Part 4, the mechanism of formation of both metal phosphates and metal carboxylates have been discussed. This part includes a study of the transformations of four-membered ring phosphates to higher dimensional structures (like 3 D sodalite-related structure), through lower-dimensional structures, involving a progressive building-up mechanism. Similar progressive building-up mechanism has also been studied for metal carboxylates. The importance of synthesis parameters like temperature in governing the dimensionality of the products has been studied...|$|E
40|$|Summary The genus Rhodococcus {{belong to}} the order actinomycetes, which are gram-positive {{bacteria}} with high GC content. They produce {{a broad range of}} bioactive secondary metabolites that found use in the pharmaceutical industry and in other biotechnological applications. Most of these bioactive metabolites were derived from nonribosomal peptides (NRP) or polyketides (PK). However, only few natural products have been isolated and characterized so far. In particular, within the Rhodococcus genus, substantial chemical diversity has been observed among the iron-chelating siderophores through the structure elucidation of rhodochelin, rhodobactin and heterobactin A 1. Therefore this work was focused on isolation and structural characterization of further new iron-chelating molecules to explore the possible chemical potential of this genus on secondary metabolite production. In this study we accomplished the isolation, the structural characterization and the elucidation of the biosynthetic origin of heterobactins, a catecholate-hydroxamate mixed-type siderophores from Rhodococcus erythropolis PR 4. The structure elucidation of the extracted and purified siderophore heterobactin A was accomplished via MSn analysis and NMR spectroscopy and revealed the noteworthy presence of a peptide bond between the guanidine group of an arginine residue and a 2, 3 - <b>dihydroxybenzoate</b> moiety. The two other purified siderophores heterobactin S 1 and S 2 were found to be derivatives of heterobactin A that have sulfonation modifications on the aromatic rings. The bioinformatic analysis of the R. erythropolis PR 4 genome and the subsequent genetic and biochemical characterization of the putative biosynthetic machinery identified the gene cluster responsible for the biosynthesis of the heterobactins to encode the three modules comprising nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) HtbG. Interestingly, the HtbG NRPS contains an unprecedented C-PCP-A domain organization within the second module of the HtbG-synthetase that may help the correct elongation of the peptide intermediate. The present work also revises the structure of heterobactin A that was described by Carrano et al. in 2001. Also, the biochemical characterization of the monooxygenase HMO (encoded by the hmo gene within the gene cluster) established a route for the biosynthesis of the non- proteinogenic amino acid L-hOrn, prior to its incorporation by the NRPS HtbG into the siderophore scaffold. The insights gained from the structural and biochemical characterization of the siderophore heterobactins, together with the genetic and biochemical characterization of the respective biosynthetic gene clusters, allowed us to establish a biosynthetic model for heterobactins assembly. The iron-siderophore binding protein HtbH (encoded by htbH gene within the gene cluster) was also biochemically characterized and was shown to display a novel mix-type catecholate-hydroxamate binding behavior...|$|E
40|$|COG 2159 of the Amidohydrolase Superfamily (AHS) is {{composed}} {{of a wide range}} of enzymes, which catalyze hydration, hydrolysis, and decarboxylation reactions. 5 -Carboxyvanillate decarboxylase (LigW) belongs to COG 2159 and catalyzes the conversion of 5 -carboxyvanillate (5 -CV) to vanillate (VAN) in the pathway for the degradation of lignin. The recombinant genes from Sphingominas paucimobilis SYK- 6 (LigW) and Novosphingobium aromaticivorans DSM 12444 (LigW 2) were expressed in E. coli in the presence of Mn^ 2 + and the purified enzymes contained 1 equivalent of Mn^ 2 +. The kinetic constants for the decarboxylation of 5 -CV are as follows: kcat = 2. 0 s^- 1 and kcat/Km = 4. 4 x 10 ^ 4 M^- 1 s^- 1 for the SYK- 6 LigW and kcat = 27 ? 1. 0 s^- 1 and kcat/Km = 1. 1 x 10 ^ 4 M^- 1 s^- 1 for the DSM 12444 LigW 2. The pH-rate profiles are bell-shaped, these results are consistent with the required deprotonation of the invariant Asp- 296 and protonation of His- 226 for catalysis and/or substrate binding to occur. Alterations of LigW metal ligands significantly decrease the catalytic activity with kcat/Km values at least three orders of magnitude lower than that of the wild-type enzyme. Site-directed mutagenesis of substrate binding resides substantially lower or abolish the activity in LigW. The enzyme is also inhibited by the product vanillate, 3 -methoxy- 5 -carboxybenzoate, and 4 -hydroxy- 3 -methoxy- 5 -nitrobenzoate. The latter proved to be a tight binding inhibitor of LigW and LigW 2 with a Ki^app = 17 nM for each of the enzymes. LigW catalyzes the exchange of the hydrogen at C- 5 of VAN with deuterium over time and the product isotope effect (PIE) in a 50 : 50 mixture of D 2 O:H 2 O at pD 9. 0 is 4. 3. The crystal structures of LigW from SYK- 6 and DSM 12444 with Mn^ 2 + in the active site were determined to a resolution of 1. 8 A (PDB id: 4 ICM) and 1. 5 A (PDB id: 4 INF). The structure of LigW was also determined complexed with the inhibitors 5 -NV, MCB, and VAN. A chemical mechanism for the decarboxylation of 5 -CV to VAN by LigW has been proposed. LigW requires Mn 2 + for catalysis, proton transfer to C- 5 is likely rate limiting for the overall reaction and precedes the decarboxylation step. The protonation of the si-face of C 5 is performed from either the hydroxyl group at C 4 or the carboxylate group of Asp- 296. In addition, COG 2159 ?-resorcylate decarboxylase (?-RSD) from Polaromonas sp. JS 666 catalyzes the conversion of ?-resorcylate to resorcinol this enzyme also catalyzes the decarboxylation of 2, 4, 6 - trihydroxybenzoate, 2, 3 - <b>dihydroxybenzoate,</b> and 2, 6 -dihydroxy- 4 -methylbenzoate...|$|E
