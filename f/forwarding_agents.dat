Manganese ore mined in interior regions is brought to Mormugao by barges navigating the rivers Mandovi and Zuari, and then either collected in the Mormugao Port to be loaded onto bulk carrier ships or directly loaded onto the ships using trans-shippers. Ore which is collected on the port is handled by machinery called MOHP (Mechanical Ore-Handling Plant). This includes massive bucket wheel loaders and miles of conveyor belts. The port has berthing facilities for large cruise liners as well as a floating dry dock. There are shipping and freight <b>forwarding</b> <b>agents</b> as well as offices of major mining companies based in the city.|$|E

2500|$|The {{principal}} transfer {{points for}} mail arriving from or destined to Europe and other locations were Nassau in the Bahamas, Bermuda, and Cuba. Ships carrying letters that were addressed to {{points in the}} Confederacy would deposit their cargo of mail {{at one of these}} transfer points. Here the inbound mail was handled by a forwarding agent who would remove the mail or inner cover and prepare it for transfer on a blockade runner. [...] Often the <b>forwarding</b> <b>agents</b> would apply their own markings to the cover of mail. Mail placed aboard a blockade runner would then, perhaps with some luck, make its way to the ports of New Orleans, Charleston or Wilmington, where it was received by Confederate postal operators who would then include it in with the regular Confederate mail for delivery. [...] The captain of the blockade runner would typically get two cents for every letter he delivered to port, which was a nominal sum, as his main source of revenue was from delivering his cargo. The average number of successful runs by a blockade runner was only about four, many of them meeting a fateful ending on their first run. Various ports along the coastline of the Confederacy saw the most traffic from blockade runners. Charleston in South Carolina was particularly well situated as a port for blockade runners with their shallow drafts, as was the Port in Wilmington in North Carolina which saw the most traffic. Because the lower Mississippi River was being blockaded effectively dividing the Western Confederate states from those east, New Orleans became one of the busiest of ports. Consequently, many blockade covers have postmarks from these locations.|$|E
40|$|In today’s {{world of}} {{telecommunications}} {{there is an}} increasing problem with reaching people one wishes to speak to. People have several telephones and this makes the situation complex for the caller. Many phone calls are left unanswered. The Call <b>Forwarding</b> <b>Agent</b> is in this report presented {{as a solution to}} this reachability problem. The idea is to have an <b>agent</b> setting call <b>forwards</b> of all the users’ phones or numbers, towards the terminal where he is available. Later, when someone calls any of the users’ phones, the call will be terminated at the terminal where the user can receive it. The Call <b>Forwarding</b> <b>Agent</b> is compared to a number of similar services. The personal number service offers the same functionality as the Call <b>Forwarding</b> <b>Agent,</b> but the Call <b>Forwarding</b> <b>Agent</b> does not force the subscriber to change phone number and it also admits a simple call screening. We have implemented a prototype of the Call <b>Forwarding</b> <b>Agent</b> that can set call forwards of regular Public Service Telephony Network terminals and the Internet telephones in Ellemtel’s IP-phone system...|$|R

2500|$|During the {{beginning}} of the Civil War, getting Confederate mail {{in and out of the}} Confederacy to and from foreign suppliers and other interested parties overseas posed a problem. At first, getting a ship through the Union blockade was easier, but as the war transpired the number of Union ships on blockade patrol increased while veteran crews were becoming more experienced and growing wiser to the evasive tactics employed by blockade-runners. To escape detection, blockade-runners would often try to get the mail and cargo through by making night runs, especially when the moon was new. Many of the vessels were also painted a dark gray color to help them blend in with the backdrop of the night sea, a practice that earned these vessels the nickname of Greyhounds. Some of the steamers also burned a smokeless anthracite coal which greatly reduced their profile against the horizon. [...] However, as the war went on, the prospect of getting a ship through diminished greatly, and many of these ships faced capture or destruction, their cargoes and mail never reaching their ports of destination. As many of the vessels used as blockade-runners were built in England for British investors, the captured crews and passengers were usually British also. The cargo aboard was rewarded to the captain and crew of the capturing vessel, it is assumed as an added incentive for captains and crews on blockade patrolling ships to be extra vigilant. Mail was also confiscated and sometimes used as evidence against the parties involved with the ship and its cargo. (figure 2) Consequently, inbound covers that were prepared by <b>forwarding</b> <b>agents</b> for transfer to and delivery within the Confederacy never received various postmarks or other markings from the Confederate post office.|$|E

40|$|V diplomski nalogi z naslovom Špediter v vlogi managerja v mednarodnem poslovanju sem s pomočjo domačih in tujih virov raziskoval področje špedicije in {{management}}a v širšem smislu. To temo sem si izbral, ker imamo doma podjetje in velik del naših proizvodov tudi izvažamo. Zato se velikokrat zatečemo k špediciji, ki nas velikokrat razočara, saj mnogokrat ne vemo, kje se blago med potjo nahaja, velikokrat pa tudi pride do poškodb blaga. Namen diplomskega dela je bil približati ali olajšati delo tistim podjetjem, ki so v fazi ustanovitve in še nimajo dovolj znanja, kako naj bi izdelek iz njihovih rok prišel v tuje, brez večjih stroškov in katera zanimajo predvsem razmere v mednarodnem poslovanju. V diplomskem delu sem najprej predstavil teoretična izhodišča o vlogi in pomenu mednarodne špedicije (vlogo špediterja ter managerja, osnovne špediterske storitve, prednosti, zavarovanje blaga), management mednarodnega poslovanja (primerjavo Slovenije z mednarodnim poslovanjem, vrsto sodobnih podjetij in nagibe), managerske strategije za vstop na tuje trge, management v povezavi s špediterstvom ter nazadnje vlogo managerjev. Špediter se lahko pojavlja v različnih vlogah, jaz sem navedel tri: -	špediter v vlogi ustvarjalnega managerja, -	špediter v vlogi managerja inovatorja, -	špediter v vlogi managerja razvijalca. Za uspešno organizacijo mora špediter nastopati v vseh treh vlogah. Najprej mora raziskati področje strategije, poiskati neko novost na tem področju in nato to novost nadaljnje razvijati. Tako po postal konkurenčen in si na trgu ustvaril neko »ime«, za katero bodo vsi vedeli, da je vredno zaupanja. The {{theme of}} my paper {{is the work}} of a <b>forwarding</b> <b>agent,</b> performing the role of a manager in international operations. In order to get a deeper insight into forwarding and management in a broader sense I used the Slovene, as well as foreing resources. I have chosen the this subject as we have a company at home. As most of our products are exported we are often forced to use the services of forwarding. These services are often below our expectations, for example, in some cases we often do not know where the good are during the transport, in addition, the goods are often damaged when they reach the their destination. The main purpose of my paper is to help those companies which have been founded recetnly, so as to make their work easier. These companies do not have the knowledge of how to get the product to its buyer without too many expanses. Such companies are interested in international operations as well. The first part of my paper deals with the role and the importance of international forwarding from the theoretical point of view (the role of a <b>forwarding</b> <b>agent</b> and a manager, basic forwarding services, the advantages of having the good insured, a forwarding condtract), the management of international operations (Slovenia in comparison to interantional operations), management strategies to eneter foreign markets, management and its links to forwarding and the role of managers. The roles of a <b>forwarding</b> <b>agent</b> are many, I have chosen to present the followin ones: - a <b>forwarding</b> <b>agent</b> in the role of a creative manager, - a forwarding managers {{in the role of the}} innovator, - a forwarding manager in the role of developer(promoter). A <b>forwarding</b> <b>agent</b> needs to be good in all these roles in order to maintain a successful organisation. First of all, he needs to research new strategies and find something new in this field, afterwards he has to develop a new approach. It is only in this way that he can become cometitive. That is how he can build his reputation and trust in the market...|$|R
