40|$|INTRODUCTION Uncertainty {{relations}} give lower {{limits for}} measures of simultaneous signal localization {{in time and}} frequency. Different quantities are {{used to describe the}} localization. One approach {{is to look at the}} concentration of energy in specified time and frequency intervals. Prolate functions [2]-[7] appear then as functions having the best energy concentration simultaneously in the two domains. Also, <b>effective</b> <b>widths</b> of energy distribution supports in time and frequency can be obtained using some entropy measures [8]. The <b>effective</b> support <b>widths</b> satisfy a corresponding uncertainty relation. Instead of entropy measures, some other estimates of <b>effective</b> support <b>widths</b> can be used [9]. We are going to describe here the localization in the time-frequency plane using specially defined second moments of energy distributions. These moments satisfy an uncertainty relation which can be considered as a generalization of the classical Heisenberg's uncertainty relation. Assume...|$|R

The latter condition can be realized by considering a very narrow function as the wanted impulse response of the filter even though this function has no relation to the desired frequency function. The goal of the design process is then to realize a filter which tries to meet both these contradicting design goals as much as possible.|$|E

40|$|Disorder in a 1 D quantum lattice induces Anderson {{localization}} of the eigenstates and drastically alters transport {{properties of}} the lattice. In the original Anderson model, {{the addition of a}} periodic driving increases, in a certain range of the driving's frequency and amplitude, localization length of the appearing Floquet eigenstates. We go beyond the uncorrelated disorder case and address the experimentally relevant situation when spatial correlations are present in the lattice potential. Their presence induces the creation of an effective mobility edge in the energy spectrum of the system. We find that a slow driving leads to resonant hybridization of the Floquet states, by increasing both the participation numbers and <b>effective</b> <b>widths</b> of the states in the strongly localized band and decreasing values of these characteristics for the states in the quasi-extended band. Strong driving homogenizes the bands, so that the Floquet states loose compactness and tend to be spatially smeared. In the basis of the stationary Hamiltonian, these states retain localization in terms of participation number but become de-localized and spectrum-wide in term of their <b>effective</b> <b>widths.</b> Signatures of thermalization are also observed.

This paper introduces the concept of the <b>effective</b> beam <b>width</b> (and the <b>effective</b> null <b>width</b> as its dual counterpart) as a measure which quantitatively captures the capacity-boosting capability of directional antennas. Beam width is commonly defined to be the directional angle spread within which the main-lobe beam power is above a certain threshold.
