40|$|Abstract:- Straight {{cross-country}} pipelines {{are supported}} throughout {{the length of}} pipeline on different forms of supports at more or less regular spans. Maximizing the <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>supports</b> will minimize the number of supports required, which in turn reduce {{the total cost of}} erecting these pipe supports. ASME has suggested the standards for support span, but the bending stress considered in its calculation is very low (15. 9 Mpa). There are other references also who have listed the maximum support span. In this paper equations for calculating the maximum span using maximum bending stress are given. Safety of the design is checked using maximum deflection. A sample problem is considered for evaluation and the results thus obtained are compared with standards like ASME B 31. 1, U S Army Engineer’s Manual and other references. The problem is also modeled in ANSYS and analyzed for deflection. A method of optimizing the <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>supports</b> using ANSYS © optimization technique is also discussed.

Tubular conductors are typical in electric power switchyards where the <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>supporting</b> insulators may be several meters. Long spans generally exhibit physical sag but this does not affect electrical performance. To avoid losses, the conductivity of the tube material must be high.|$|R
40|$|On {{the basis}} of {{previous}} research, the stone size effect is not always ruled by well-known statistical laws such as the Weibull or Bazant law because of the intrinsic complex structure and features of the materials analysed. According to the EN 12372 test method for flexural strength under concentrated load on natural stones, the suggested dimensions are 50 × 50 × 300 mm. Other dimensions are possible, but some dimensional requirements (on thickness, width and <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>supporting</b> rollers) need to be fulfilled. In this research, to investigate the thickness effect further, in relation to stone structure and heterogeneity, eight different stones were tested: four with anisotropic features and four homogeneous. The <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> the <b>supporting</b> rollers was proportional to the specimens' length. The thickness effect on the flexural strength {{of most of the}} materials tested is negligible considering the uncertainty (except for gneiss). From the data obtained some remarks have been made on the test method and on the specimens' thickness. Moreover, with the aim of obtaining reliable results with low uncertainty by means of a flexural strength test, a minimum thickness specimen both for fine- and coarse-grained stones has been determined (respectively 15 and 20 mm) ...|$|R

However, some specialists consider the model to be rather ideal for railways in terms of track and the technical state of track.

The study presents mathematic models of the vehicle/track dynamic system, and a design scheme of track presented as a bar on numerous elastic dissipative supports with non-linear characteristics, which is taken on the base of this system.

Opening in concrete slabs due to cutouts significantly decrease the member stiffness. There are different techniques to strengthen slabs with opening cutouts. This study presents experimental and numerical investigations {{on the use of}} Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymers (CFRP) as strengthening material to strengthen and restore the load carrying capacity of R.C. slabs after having cutout in the hogging moment region. The experimental program consisted of testing five (oneway spanning R.C. flat slabs) with overhang. All slabs were prismatic, rectangular in cross-section and nominally 2000 mm long, 1000 mm width, and 100 mm thickness with a clear span (<b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>supports)</b> of 1200 mm and the overhang length is 700 mm. All slabs were loaded up to 30 kN (45 % of ultimate load for reference slab, before yielding of the longitudinal reinforcement), then the load was kept constant during cutting concrete and steel bars (producing cut out). After that operation, slabs were loaded till failure. An analytical study using finite element analysis (FEA) is performed using the commercial software ANSYS. The FEA has been validated and calibrated using the experimental results. The FE model was found to be in a good agreement with the experimental results. The investigated key parameters were slab aspect ratio for the opening ratios of [1 : 1, 2 : 1], CFRP layers and the laminates widths, positions for cutouts and the CFRP configurations around cutouts.|$|E

By eliminating the inefficient part of a shear wall, the central portion, and consolidating support members in a much stronger material, steel, a skyscraper could be built with both horizontal and vertical supports throughout.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} optimal assembly of the computer assisted Ortho-SUV Frame for correction of the distal femur deformities which will provide the maximal bone fragments mutual movements and have the minimal assembly sizes. For it 360 bench tests on 12 model was performed. The dependence of the Ortho-SUV Frame reduction capabilities (translation, angulation, torsion) and <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>supports,</b> places of struts fixation and use of Z-shaped plates for struts fixation was investigated. It is found that in Ortho-SUV assembling to provide the necessary requirements 3 / 4 ring supports is reasonable. Distal support should be placed at the level VII, proximal at the distance 150 – 200 mm higher. For fixation of the strut 1 to the proximal support position 2 should be used, for the strut 3 – the place between position 5 and 6, for strut 5 – position 10; for fixation of the strut 2 to the distal support position 4 should be used, for fixation of the strut 4 – position 8, for strut 6 – position 12. Use of the Z-shaped plates in fixation of strut 1 and 5 increases the reduction capabilities on 11. 4 – 25. 5 % in average. Use of modular transformation of the frame allows decreasing the bulkiness of the frame after deformity correction. Investigated assembly was applied in treatment of 14 patients.
