40|$|BACKGROUND: This study {{details the}} {{hospital}} costs of strict reverse <b>isolation</b> <b>procedures</b> in heart transplant recipients. METHODS: In a prospective, descriptive design, a research protocol was developed, identifying {{all of the}} activities related to strict reverse <b>isolation</b> <b>procedures</b> in heart transplant recipients. For each separate activity, materials used and workload were registered, which allowed the calculation of the material and labor costs {{for each of the}} <b>isolation</b> <b>procedures.</b> RESULTS: The cost calculations show that the first day in isolation costs about $ 160 (for <b>isolation</b> <b>procedures</b> only) and about $ 65 for each consecutive isolation day. With a mean post-intensive care unit length of stay of 22 days, the mean cost of <b>isolation</b> <b>procedures</b> for heart transplant recipients amounts to $ 1535. Finally, a modified isolation protocol was developed, incorporating only those procedures with proven effectiveness. It was calculated that a switch to such a modified protocol would allow a savings of over 50 % of the hospital resources devoted to isolation measures. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Isolation</b> <b>procedures</b> use a significant portion of hospital resources. Modifying isolation protocols in heart transplant recipients can be a source of considerable savings in a transplant program. status: publishe...|$|R

In 1990, Simons et al. isolated apocynin to a pharmacologically useful level using an actively guided <b>isolation</b> <b>procedure.</b> Apocynin’s observed anti-inflammatory capabilities proved to be a result of its ability to selectively prevent the formation of free radicals, oxygen ions, and peroxides in the body.

5000|$|The initial {{procedure}} to isolate RAD tags involved digesting DNA {{with a particular}} restriction enzyme, ligating biotinylated adapters to the overhangs, randomly shearing the DNA into fragments {{much smaller than the}} average distance between restriction sites, and isolating the biotinylated fragments using streptavidin beads. [...] This procedure was used initially to isolate RAD tags for microarray analysis. More recently, the RAD tag <b>isolation</b> <b>procedure</b> has been modified for use with high-throughput sequencing on the Illumina platform, which has the benefit of greatly reduced raw error rates and high throughput. [...] The new procedure involves digesting DNA with a particular restriction enzyme (for example: SbfI, NsiI,…), ligating the first adapter, called P1, to the overhangs, randomly shearing the DNA into fragments much smaller than the average distance between restriction sites, preparing the sheared ends into blunt ends and ligating the second adapter (P2), and using PCR to specifically amplify fragments that contain both adapters. Importantly, the first adapter contains a short DNA sequence barcode, called MID (molecular identifier), which allows to pools different DNA samples with different barcodes and to track each sample when they are sequenced in the same reaction. [...] The use of high-throughput sequencing to analyze RAD tags can be classified as Reduced-representation sequencing, which includes, among other things, RADSeq (RAD-Sequencing).|$|E

Method A was as described by Wauters et al. (Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 54 : 851 - 854, 1988). Method B has been recommended by the Nordic Committee on Food Analysis (method no. 117, 1987). The genetic probe was used in a colony hybridization assay to detect virulent yersiniae at each of the isolation steps with composed methods A and B. A total of 50 samples of raw pork products obtained from 13 meat-processing factories in Norway were examined. Y. enterocolitica serogroup O: 3, biovar 4, was isolated from altogether 9 (18. 0 %) of the samples by using the two <b>isolation</b> <b>procedures.</b> In contrast, colony hybridization using the genetic probe indicated that 30 (60. 0 %) of the samples contained virulent yersiniae.
