25|$|Some {{limitations}} {{exist on}} the power to enact ordinances. The Supreme Court of the United States has held that the United States Constitution requires that laws, including municipal ordinances, may not be arbitrary or discriminatory, {{and may not be}} unreasonably vague, so that a resident may be reasonably certain that their conduct conforms to the law. Furthermore, local governments can not delegate the power to enact ordinances to other bodies. However, they may establish fixed and certain standards for carrying out certain activities (such as home building or operating restaurants), and then delegate to subordinate bodies the power to make rules governing how residents can <b>demonstrate</b> <b>compliance</b> with these standards.|$|E
25|$|Non-stormwater permits {{typically}} include numeric effluent {{limitations for}} specific pollutants. A numeric limitation quantifies the maximum pollutant load or concentration {{allowed in the}} discharge, e.g., 30mg/L of biochemical oxygen demand. Exceeding a numeric limitation constitutes {{a violation of the}} permit, and the discharger is subject to fines as laid out in section 309. Facilities must periodically monitor their effluent (i.e., collect and analyze wastewater samples), and submit Discharge Monitoring Reports to the appropriate agency, to <b>demonstrate</b> <b>compliance.</b> Stormwater permits typically require facilities to prepare a Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan and implement best management practices, but do not specify numeric effluent limits and may not include regular monitoring requirements. Some permits cover both stormwater and non-stormwater discharges. NPDES permits must be reissued every five years. Permit agencies (EPA, states, tribes) must provide notice to the public of pending permits and provide an opportunity for public comment.|$|E

Trinity did not appeal DETC's decision, but Trinity disagreed with the DETC commissioners' decision, noting the demonstrated confidence of Trinity's banking institution.

2500|$|Prior to Proposition 218, {{the courts}} allowed local {{agencies}} significant flexibility in determining property-related fee or charge amounts. [...] In lawsuits challenging property-related fees or charges, the challenger had the burden {{to show that}} they were not legal. [...] Proposition 218 shifted the burden of demonstrating compliance to the local agency in any lawsuit challenging a property-related fee or charge. [...] In any legal action contesting the validity of a property-related fee or charge, the burden is on the local agency to <b>demonstrate</b> <b>compliance</b> with the procedures and requirements applicable to property-related fees and charges.
