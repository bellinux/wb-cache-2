25|$|Equivalent {{airspeed}} (EAS) {{is defined}} as the speed at sea level that would produce the same incompressible dynamic pressure as the true airspeed at the altitude at which the vehicle is flying. An aircraft in forward flight is subject to the effects of compressibility. Likewise, the calibrated airspeed {{is a function of the}} compressible <b>impact</b> <b>pressure.</b> EAS, on the other hand, is a measure of airspeed that is a function of incompressible dynamic pressure. Structural analysis is often in terms of incompressible dynamic pressure, so that equivalent airspeed is a useful speed for structural testing. At standard sea level pressure, calibrated airspeed and equivalent airspeed are equal. Up to about 200 knots CAS and 10,000 ft (3,000 m) the difference is negligible, but at higher speeds and altitudes CAS must be corrected for compressibility error to determine EAS. The significance of equivalent airspeed is that, at Mach numbers below the onset of wave drag, all of the aerodynamic forces and moments on an aircraft are proportional to the square of the equivalent airspeed. The equivalent airspeed is closely related to the indicated airspeed shown by the airspeed indicator. Thus, the handling and 'feel' of an aircraft, and the aerodynamic loads upon it, at a given equivalent airspeed, are very nearly constant and equal to those at standard sea level irrespective of the actual flight conditions.|$|E
500|$|Inherent errors {{may fall}} into several categories, each {{affecting}} different instruments. [...] Density errors affect instruments metering airspeed and altitude. [...] This type of error {{is caused by}} variations of pressure and temperature in the atmosphere. [...] A compressibility error can arise because the <b>impact</b> <b>pressure</b> will cause the air to compress in the pitot tube. At standard sea level pressure altitude the calibration equation (see calibrated airspeed) correctly accounts for the compression {{so there is no}} compressibility error at sea level. At higher altitudes the compression is not correctly accounted for and will cause the instrument to read greater than equivalent airspeed. A correction may be obtained from a chart. Compressibility error becomes significant at altitudes above [...] and at airspeeds greater than [...] Hysteresis is an error that is caused by mechanical properties of the aneroid capsules located within the instruments. [...] These capsules, used to determine pressure differences, have physical properties that resist change by retaining a given shape, even though the external forces may have changed. Reversal errors are caused by a false static pressure reading. [...] This false reading may be caused by abnormally large changes in an aircraft's pitch. [...] A large change in pitch will cause a momentary showing of movement in the opposite direction. [...] Reversal errors primarily affect altimeters and vertical speed indicators.|$|E

40|$|Up to {{the middle}} of this century many coastal {{structures}} were built from blockwork, using either natural stone blocks or concrete blocks. Those blockwork structures subjected to breaking wave impacts often show a particular damage type, whereby individual blocks are shifted out of their position and moved into the sea.

In order to verify the damage mechanism, and to investigate the characteristics of <b>impact</b> induced <b>pressure</b> pulses, model tests on the propagation of wave <b>impact</b> <b>pressures</b> into water filled cracks were conducted. It was found that <b>impact</b> generated <b>pressure</b> pulses can enter water filled cracks and that they exhibit wave-like characteristics such as finite propagation speed, reflection, superposition and attenuation.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Dynamic models, {{initially}} {{based on}} fluid flow, {{have been used}} since the 1950 s for modelling the motion and runout of extreme snow avalanches. The friction coefficients cannot be directly measured. They can, however, be calibrated to reproduce an extreme runout that was observed or statistically estimated in a particular path, and the resulting modelled velocity {{can be used to}} calculate <b>impact</b> <b>pressures</b> in the runout zone. Alternatively, the friction coefficients can be obtained from extreme avalanches in similar nearby paths and used, often with estimates of available snow mass, to estimate extreme runout in a path that threatens proposed development. This method is controversial because with average values of the friction coefficients, runout estimates from dynamic models are more variable than estimates from statistical runout models. However, uncertainty in the release mass and friction coefficients can be simulated with dynamic models, improving confidence in the runout, <b>impact</b> <b>pressures</b> and return intervals, all of which are required for risk-based zoning. Also, various scenarios can be modelled to see which yields reliable <b>impact</b> <b>pressures</b> for a given position in the runout zone. We argue that dynamic runout estimates can complement estimates from statistical models, historical records and vegetation damage, and be especially useful where some of these estimates are not available or are of low confidence. Limitations of dynamic models involving friction coefficients, snow mass estimates, number of variables and dimensions, entrainment and deposition as well as flow laws are reviewed from a practical perspective...|$|R

40|$|Laboratory {{measurements}} of the pressure distributions on surface-piercing vertical cylinders due to breaking waves are presented. Breaking waves are generated in a repeatable fashion under program control, and both vertical and azimuthal distributions of pressures were measured over many repeats of the experiments. Despite the repeatability of the controllable experimental conditions, {{it is found that}} the highest <b>impact</b> <b>pressures</b> are subject o considerable variability, including pressure oscillations, from run to run. This high impact region is found to be localized in space and time, and the variability is attributed to the random dynamics of the breaking wave front and the entrapped air.
