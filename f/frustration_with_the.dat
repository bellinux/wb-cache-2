5|$|As {{the series}} progressed, some critics began to express <b>frustration</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> comic. Joey Smith, also with Inside Pulse, found the large cast was {{difficult}} to track by the fourth issue. In a review of issue 33, Fulton found the series entertaining, but sometimes thought the plot felt directionless. Not all agreed, however; Paste Magazine included the comic book in its list of favorite horror comics in late 2016.|$|E
50|$|The turn of 2006/2007 saw Bren leave Season; a {{combination}} of <b>frustrations</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> musical style / direction of the band, and Matt's <b>frustrations</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> whole Season 'apathy' that saw Matt start up a side project (Certo Sermo).|$|R

5|$|On April 19, 1969, {{during a}} parents' weekend, over 80 members of Cornell's Afro-American Society {{took over the}} student union building, Willard Straight Hall. The {{takeover}} was precipitated by increasing racial tension at {{the university and the}} students' <b>frustration</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> administration's lack of support for a black studies program. The specific catalysts for the takeover were a reprimand of three black students for an incident the previous December and a cross burning in front of the black women's cooperative and other cases of racism.|$|E
5|$|At her new job, Goldman met {{a fellow}} worker named Jacob Kershner, who shared {{her love for}} books, dancing, and traveling, {{as well as her}} <b>frustration</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> monotony of factory work. After four months, they married in February 1887. Once he moved in with Goldman's family, however, their {{relationship}} faltered. On their wedding night she discovered that he was impotent; they became emotionally and physically distant. Before long he became jealous and suspicious. She, meanwhile, was becoming more engaged with the political turmoil around her—particularly the fallout of the 1886 Haymarket affair in Chicago and the anti-authoritarian political philosophy of anarchism.|$|E
5|$|Bass guitarist and lyricist Roger Waters {{conceived}} the album {{as a rock}} opera during Pink Floyd's 1977 In the Flesh Tour, when his <b>frustration</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> audience became so acute that he spat on them. Its story, which follows themes of abandonment and personal isolation, explores Pink, a character whom Waters modeled after himself and the band's original leader Syd Barrett. Pink's life begins {{with the loss of}} his father during the Second World War, and continues with abuse from his schoolteachers, an overprotective mother, and the breakdown of his marriage; all contribute to his eventual self-imposed isolation from society, represented by a metaphorical wall. The band, who were then struggling with personal and financial difficulties, supported the idea. The album {{is considered one of the}} most recognisable concept albums.|$|E

5|$|Donna Lee Brien {{stated that}} just as the filmmakers {{attempted}} {{to distance themselves from}} Leigh's murder, the city of Newcastle attempted to distance itself from Blackrock. A 1999 feature in The Sydney Morning Herald discussing cinematic production in Newcastle mentioned everything from Mel Gibson's 1977 debut film Summer City to a short film festival that year, but made no mention of Blackrock. Brien theorised that some of the condemnation the film received may have been due to public <b>frustration</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> legal system, as the film achieves justice for the victim, whereas no one was ever convicted of raping Leigh. Brien cited the film as an example of why sensitivity and care must be taken when fictionalising an actual crime.|$|E
5|$|Historian Jean-Claude Willame {{argued that}} the speech {{was the result of}} Lumumba's growing <b>frustration</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> process of {{independence}} which he believed might represent a purely nominal change in government with no real effects. Lumumba blamed Kasa-Vubu and his colleagues for failing to publicly oppose this situation. Gender historians have therefore {{argued that the}} speech was the result of Lumumba's growing feeling of emasculation. Others have pointed to the influence of Belgian Socialist delegates and representatives of the Guinean President, Ahmed Sékou Touré, who had a strongly Marxist ideology, all of whom hoped a public and international denouncement of colonialism would help them politically.|$|E
5|$|By {{the fall}} of 1967, Peckinpah was {{rewriting}} the screenplay and preparing for the production. The principal photography was shot entirely on location in Mexico, most notably at the Hacienda Ciénaga del Carmen (deep in the desert between Torreón and Saltillo, Coahuila) and on the Rio Nazas. Peckinpah's epic work was inspired by his hunger to return to films, the violence seen in Arthur Penn's Bonnie and Clyde (1967), and America's growing <b>frustration</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Vietnam War and what he {{perceived to be the}} utter lack of reality seen in Westerns up to that time. He set out to make a film which portrayed not only the vicious violence of the period, but as well the crude men attempting to survive the era. Multiple scenes attempted in Major Dundee, including slow motion action sequences (inspired by Akira Kurosawa's work in Seven Samurai (1954)), characters leaving a village as if in a funeral procession and the use of inexperienced locals as extras, would become fully realized in The Wild Bunch.|$|E
50|$|On September 4, 2008, Culpepper {{announced}} his retirement. He expressed his <b>frustrations</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> NFL in a 506 word retirement letter. The main reason of his retirement {{was because he}} felt he could still be a starting quarterback in the NFL.|$|R
50|$|In 2009, after <b>frustrations</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> {{original}} OpenSSL API, Marco Peereboom, an OpenBSD developer at the time, forked {{the original}} API by creating Agglomerated SSL (assl), which reuses OpenSSL API under the hood, but provides a much simpler external interface.|$|R
50|$|St. Martin's Press in December 2010 signed O'Donnell {{to write}} a book about her 2010 Senate {{campaign}} and her <b>frustrations</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> political process, which was eventually published in August 2011 as Troublemaker: Let's Do What It Takes To Make America Great Again.|$|R
5|$|Starship Troopers had {{a direct}} {{influence}} on many later science fiction stories. John Steakley's 1984 novel Armor was, according to the author, born out of <b>frustration</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> small amount of actual combat in Starship Troopers and because he wanted this aspect developed further. The 1988 Gainax OVA series Gunbuster has plot elements similar to Heinlein's novel, depicting humanity arrayed against an alien military. Scholars have identified elements of Heinlein's influence in Ender's Game, by Orson Scott Card, as well. Hantke, in particular, compares the battle room in Ender's Game to Heinlein's prosthetic suits, stating that they both regulate but also enhance human agency. Suvin suggests parallels between the plots of the two novels, with human society in both stories at war against insect-like aliens, but states {{that the story of}} Ender Wiggin takes a very different direction, as Ender regrets his genocidal actions and dedicates his efforts to protecting his erstwhile targets.|$|E

25|$|Other {{signs of}} <b>frustration</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> status quo {{appeared}} with the bitter Asbestos Strike of 1949. It {{led to a}} greater appreciation of labour and social-democratic issues in Quebec.|$|E
5000|$|In August 2005, {{the group}} again disbanded, due to <b>frustrations</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> music {{industry}} and internal tensions. Belke began working in radio, hosting his own show.

50|$|Mayall {{retired from}} the Design Council in 1979, and {{under the name of}} Design Promotion Projects, he {{undertook}} independent design education and exhibition work. He also continued to write about his <b>frustrations</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Design Council's approach to certain task, alongside his alternative vision for it.|$|R
50|$|The pink adobe {{home has}} become a {{significant}} landmark in La Conchita. Brown had fought {{for more than two}} years to get the design of this studio through the Ventura County Planning Commission and even commemorated his <b>frustrations</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Commission in a now famous painting.|$|R
25|$|The {{idea for}} Staples {{originated}} in 1985, while Stemberg {{was working on}} a proposal for a different business. He needed a ribbon for his printer, but was unable to obtain one because his local dealer was closed for the Independence Day holiday. A <b>frustration</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> reliance on small stores for critical supplies combined with Stemberg's background in the grocery business led to a vision for an office supply superstore.|$|E
25|$|McEnroe {{became the}} U.S. Davis Cup captain in September 1999. His team barely escaped defeat {{in their first}} two outings in 2000, beating Zimbabwe and the Czech Republic in tight 3–2 encounters. They were then {{defeated}} 5–0 by Spain in the semifinals. McEnroe resigned in November 2000 after 14 months as captain, citing <b>frustration</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Davis Cup schedule and format as two of his primary reasons. His brother Patrick took over the job.|$|E
25|$|Dallaire {{resigned}} from the Senate on June 17, 2014, seven years prior to reaching mandatory retirement. He {{decided to leave the}} Senate in order to spend more time public speaking, to do research on and due to his own struggles with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, due to his <b>frustration</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> ongoing Canadian Senate expenses scandal., and to devote the majority of his time on the issue of eradicating the use of child soldiers through his Roméo Dallaire Child Soldiers Initiative.|$|E

25|$|In December 1996, Coleman {{announced}} he was leaving the DFL party to join the Republican Party. He cited his <b>frustrations</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Democratic Party and his belief that the Republican Party offered {{the best chance to}} continue his efforts to hold the line on taxes and grow jobs.|$|R
25|$|The {{negotiations}} were largely {{motivated by the}} juggernaut takeover of the Liberal Party by the extremely popular and successful former Liberal finance minister Paul Martin, and the marked reduction in membership and political donations for both parties due to voter <b>frustration</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> status quo Liberal hegemony. Polls showed both the beleaguered PC and Alliance parties losing {{a large number of}} seats in the next election to a Martin-led Liberal team across Canada if an amenable solution was not found.|$|E
25|$|Pro-Union {{sentiment}} {{during and}} after the Civil War helped the party to expand in importance. Between 1858 and 1932 the Republicans won every Iowa gubernatorial election, with the exception of 1890, when Horace Boies, a former Republican, was elected because of his opposition to Prohibition. In 1932 electoral <b>frustration</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Great Depression and Prohibition led to the re-emergence of the Democratic Party in Iowa. Historically the party has held the Governor's office – 30 of Iowa's 41 governors have been Republicans.|$|E
25|$|Following {{promotion}} to the Premier League, QPR endured a difficult 2014–2015 campaign. Their initial manager, Harry Redknapp, resigned in February after poor results and mutual <b>frustration</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> board. He {{was replaced by}} Chris Ramsey. The team finished the season last, amassing only 30 points, and were relegated back to the Championship after only one season. After a poor start to the Championship, Chris Ramsey was sacked in November 2015 and former manager Neil Warnock returned to the hot seat in interim charge.|$|E
50|$|Dollar Shave Club {{was founded}} by Mark Levine and Michael Dubin. The pair met at a party and spoke of their <b>frustrations</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> cost of razor blades.

50|$|Over time, {{there have}} been {{numerous}} proposals for partitioning the state of Florida to form a separate state of South Florida. Such proposals have usually been made as political statement rather than serious attempts at secession. Reasons often stated are cultural, ethnic, economic, and financial <b>frustrations</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> state government in Tallahassee, which is in North Florida.|$|R
