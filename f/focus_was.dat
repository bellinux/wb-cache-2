5|$|Instead of copying {{traditional}} academic postures, Rodin preferred his {{models to}} move naturally around his studio (despite their nakedness). The sculptor often made quick sketches in clay that were later fine-tuned, cast in plaster, and cast in bronze or carved from marble. Rodin's <b>focus</b> <b>was</b> on {{the handling of}} clay.|$|E

40|$|A second {{occurrence}} <b>focus</b> <b>is</b> {{an expression}} {{which is in}} the scope of a <b>focus</b> sensitive operator, <b>is</b> the semantic <b>focus</b> of that operator, and which is a repeat of an earlier focused occurrence. Second occurrence <b>foci</b> <b>are</b> intonationally distinct from the original occurrence of the material. Indeed, second occurrence <b>foci</b> <b>are</b> often claimed to lack any intonational marking, e. g. pitch accent. This apparent dissociation of semantic and intonational <b>focus</b> <b>is</b> commonly used as an argument against certain theories of focus; e. g., alternative semantics (Rooth, 1985) and structured meaning semantics (Jacobs, 1983; Krifka, 1992; von Stechow, 1989). Here we report on a production experiment designed to test whether second occurrence <b>foci</b> <b>are</b> prosodically marked. We find that while there is no significant pitch accent on second occurrence <b>foci,</b> there <b>are</b> other prosodic effects. In particular, we observe that second occurrence <b>focus</b> <b>is</b> marked by increased duration and intensity. This result is of significance to semanticists interested in the interpretation of focus and to intonational phonologists interested in the acoustic realization of focus...|$|R

5|$|After {{a series}} of civil wars, Ladislaus's main <b>focus</b> <b>was</b> the {{restoration}} of public safety. He introduced severe legislation, punishing those who violated property rights with death or mutilation. He occupied almost all Croatia in 1091, which {{marked the beginning of}} an expansion period for the medieval Kingdom of Hungary. Ladislaus's victories over the Pechenegs and Cumans ensured the security of his kingdom's eastern borders for about 150 years. His relationship with the Holy See deteriorated during the last years of his reign, as the popes claimed that Croatia was their fief, but Ladislaus denied their claims.|$|E
5000|$|In geometry, focuses or foci ( [...] , [...] ), {{singular}} <b>focus,</b> <b>are</b> special {{points with}} reference to which any {{of a variety of}} curves is constructed. For example, one or two <b>foci</b> can <b>be</b> used in defining conic sections, the four types of which are the circle, ellipse, parabola, and hyperbola.

While his later, less mainstream albums failed to chart or receive much radio airplay, Ice has had a loyal underground following. In 2009, Ice began hosting The Vanilla Ice Project on DIY Network.

His interest in show business remained a constant, and in later years McAleer developed a strong friendship with Broadway composer and performer George M. Cohan.|$|E
5|$|Augustin Pyramus de Candolle also spelled Augustin Pyrame de Candolle (4 February 1778 – 9 September 1841) was a Swiss botanist. René Louiche Desfontaines {{launched}} de Candolle's botanical {{career by}} recommending him at an herbarium. Within {{a couple of}} years de Candolle had established a new genus, and he went on to document hundreds of plant families and create a new natural plant classification system. Although de Candolle's main <b>focus</b> <b>was</b> botany, he also contributed to related fields such as phytogeography, agronomy, paleontology, medical botany, and economic botany.|$|E
50|$|<b>Focus</b> <b>is</b> the {{tendency}} for light rays to reach the same place on the image sensor or film, independent of where they pass through the lens. For clear pictures, the <b>focus</b> <b>is</b> adjusted for distance, because at a different object distance the rays reach {{different parts of the}} lens with different angles. In modern photography, <b>focusing</b> <b>is</b> often accomplished automatically.|$|R
25|$|The <b>focus</b> spread <b>is</b> {{related to}} the depth of focus. Ray (2000, 56) gives two {{definitions}} of the latter. The first is the tolerance {{of the position of}} the image plane for which an object remains acceptably sharp; the second is that the limits of depth of <b>focus</b> <b>are</b> the image-side conjugates of the near and far limits of DOF. With the first definition, focus spread and depth of <b>focus</b> <b>are</b> usually close in value though conceptually different. With the second definition, focus spread and depth of <b>focus</b> <b>are</b> the same.|$|R

5|$|Blackburn's primary <b>focus</b> <b>was</b> on {{reforms to}} the state's penal system. According to Blackburn, 953 prisoners {{were being held}} at the state penitentiary, {{although}} the structure only contained 780 cells. Conditions in the penitentiary were poor and resulted in many illnesses. One fifth of the state's prisoners suffered from pneumonia in 1875. When Blackburn became governor in 1879, the mortality rate of the almost one thousand inmates in the state penitentiary was over 7 percent. Scurvy caused by poor nutrition afflicted 75 percent of prisoners. Blackburn compared conditions at the penitentiary to the infamous Black Hole of Calcutta.|$|E
5|$|Bloc Party {{aimed to}} create an album that appealed to {{followers}} of different musical genres. Building on the arrangements in their demo songs recorded in 2004, the band members moulded tracks largely through live takes during the Silent Alarm studio sessions. The compositional <b>focus</b> <b>was</b> on rhythm and the drum and bass parts, while lyricist Kele Okereke's writing examined the feelings and hopes of young adults, including views on global politics. Following the album's completion, Bloc Party embarked on promotional tours before its release.|$|E
5|$|During the 1920s, the ACLU's primary <b>focus</b> <b>was</b> {{on freedom}} of speech in general, and speech within the labor {{movement}} particularly.

50|$|A {{transparent}} {{sphere of}} any material with refractive index greater than one brings parallel rays {{of light to}} a rough <b>focus</b> (that <b>is,</b> a <b>focus</b> with significant coma). For typical values of the refractive index, this <b>focus</b> <b>is</b> usually very near {{the surface of the}} sphere, on the side diametrically opposite to where the rays entered. If the refractive index is greater than 2, the <b>focus</b> <b>is</b> inside the sphere, so the brightest accessible point is on its surface directly opposite the source of light. However, few materials have that property. For most materials, the <b>focus</b> <b>is</b> slightly outside the sphere. The closer the refractive index is to 2, the closer the <b>focus</b> <b>is</b> {{to the surface of the}} sphere, and hence the brighter the spot formed on an object touching the sphere.|$|R

5|$|During {{the late}} 1930s, though {{motivated}} by political and propaganda reasons, several cultural exchanges between Japan and Germany took place.

5|$|Early in the Society's history, {{when its}} <b>focus</b> <b>was</b> still {{primarily}} literary, membership was considered {{by a committee}} {{for three days and}} then voted upon. By 1908, that model had been abandoned in favor of an open system in which any student who paid an annual fee could be part of the group. At that time, Philaletheis was governed by a six-member board consisting of a president and vice-president (both seniors), secretary, treasurer, and props manager (juniors), and an assistant props manager (a sophomore). In 1951, the board was vastly expanded to include managers of scenery, lights, sound, makeup, publicity, {{and a number of other}} fields.|$|E
5|$|Hall had {{no special}} {{academic}} background or sailing experience (he was a blacksmith, engraver, then {{owner of a}} Cincinnati newspaper), {{but he was a}} voracious reader with an obsession for the Arctic. After John Franklin's 1845 expedition was lost, Hall's <b>focus</b> <b>was</b> directed toward the Arctic. He was able to launch two expeditions in search of Franklin and his crew; one in 1860–63, and a second in 1864–69. These experiences established him as a seasoned Arctic explorer, and gave him valuable contacts among the Inuit people. The renown he gained eventually allowed him to convince the United States government to fund his third expedition, an attempt on the North Pole.|$|E

Hansell continued to study modern weapons systems, becoming an advocate of the Strategic Defense Initiative and the B-2 Spirit bomber.
