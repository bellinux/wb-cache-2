5|$|The Smiths {{saw the man}} {{at around}} 22:00 on Rua da Escola Primária, 500 yards (457 m) from the McCanns' apartment, {{walking away from the}} Ocean Club and toward Rua 25 de Abril and the beach. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>a</b> girl aged 3–4 years. She had blonde hair and pale skin, was wearing light-coloured pyjamas, and had bare feet. The man was mid-30s, 5ft 7in–5ft 9in (1.75–1.80 m), slim-to-normal build, with short brown hair, wearing cream or beige trousers. He did not look like a tourist, {{according}} to the Smiths, and had seemed uncomfortable carrying the child. E-fits based on the Smiths testimony were first created in 2008 by Oakley International, private investigators hired by the McCanns, and were publicized in 2013 by Scotland Yard on Crimewatch.|$|E
5|$|When Bart, Lisa and Maggie {{come home}} from trick-or-treating, Marge {{switches}} out the candy with dental hygiene products and asks Homer to deliver the candy to a drive for the troops overseas. Homer instead runs off with the bag to eat its contents in privacy at a canyon cliff. Unfortunately, Homer trips and falls {{to the bottom of}} the canyon with his arm pinned. Fueled by his need to get the out-of-reach bag of candy, and reluctant to wait twenty minutes for help, Homer is forced to chew off his arm. Though he manages it after a few tries, Homer learns that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>a</b> bag of vegetables, as Bart, Lisa and Maggie had secretly stolen back their candy, inciting an upset Homer to scream in rage.|$|E
5|$|As {{de facto}} racial {{segregation}} increased, so did tensions between {{residents of the}} northeast {{and members of the}} predominantly white male Teaneck Police Department. On the evening of April 10, 1990, the Teaneck Police Department responded to a call from a resident complaining about a teenager with a gun. After an initial confrontation near Bryant School and a subsequent chase, Phillip Pannell, an African American teenager, was shot and killed by Gary Spath, a white Teaneck police officer. Spath said he thought Pannell had a gun and was turning to shoot him. Witnesses said Pannell was unarmed and {{had been shot in the}} back. Protest marches, some violent, ensued; most African Americans believed that Pannell had been killed in cold blood, while other residents insisted that Spath had been justified in his actions. Testimony at the trial claimed that Pannell was shot in the back, and that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>a</b> gun. A police officer testified to finding a modified starter's pistol with eight cartridges in Pannell's jacket pocket. Spath was ultimately acquitted on charges of reckless manslaughter in the shooting. Some months after Spath had been cleared, he decided to retire from law enforcement. The incident was an international news event that brought Reverend Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson to the community and inspired the 1995 book Color Lines: The Troubled Dreams of Racial Harmony in an American Town, by Mike Kelly.|$|E

25|$|In Embassy to Gaius Philo {{describes}} his diplomatic mission to Caligula, {{one of the}} few events in his life which are known specifically. He relates that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>a</b> petition describing the sufferings of the Alexandrian Jews and asking the emperor to secure their rights. Philo gives a description of their sufferings, more detailed than Josephus's, to characterize the Alexandrian Greeks as the aggresors in the civil strife that had left many Jews and Greeks dead.|$|E
25|$|Another vehicle {{then drove}} down the road, {{carrying}} four people. It was not until they were almost adjacent to Bryant that they realised <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>a</b> gun. Bryant shot at the car, smashing the windscreen. Douglas Horner was wounded by pieces of the windscreen. The car proceeded ahead where White and Wanders tried to get in, but Horner did not realise the situation and drove on. When they saw that White had been shot, they came back and picked them up. Both parties then continued down to a local establishment called the Fox and Hound, where they called police.|$|E
25|$|Shortly before 10:00p.m., {{police were}} called to {{investigate}} McDonald at 4100 South Pulaski Road responding to reports that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>a</b> knife and breaking into vehicles in a trucking yard at 41st Street and Kildare Avenue. When officers confronted McDonald, he used a knife with a 3-inch blade to slice the tire on a patrol vehicle and damage its windshield. McDonald walked away from police after numerous verbal instructions from officers to drop the knife, at which point responding officers requested Taser backup, according to radio recordings released December 30, 2015, to Politico and NBC Chicago in response to Freedom of Information Act requests.|$|E

25|$|The {{youth of}} some of the victims is often {{characterized}} as a particularly reprehensible aspect of the raid. Bobbie Martin is generally cited as being the youngest victim; some histories of the raid state he was twelve years old, while others state he was fourteen. Most accounts state he was wearing a Union soldier uniform or clothing made from his father’s uniform; some state <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>a</b> musket and cartridges. (For perspective on the age of participants in the conflict, {{it has been estimated that}} about 800,000 Union soldiers were seventeen years of age or younger, with about 100,000 of those being fifteen or younger.) Most of Quantrill’s guerrilla fighters were teenagers. One of the youngest was Riley Crawford, who was 13 when brought by his mother to Quantrill after her husband was shot and her home burned by Union soldiers.|$|E
25|$|The Glenanne gang {{carried out}} a co-ordinated attack against two Catholic {{families}} on 4 January 1976 which left {{a total of five}} men dead, and one injured. Robert McConnell purportedly led the first masked UVF unit at Whitecross, County Armagh. The gunmen entered the Reavey home by the key which had been accidentally left in the door and opened fire on three brothers who watching television at the time, killing John and Brian outright, and wounding another, Anthony. The other members of the large family had previously gone out leaving the three brothers on their own. The getaway car on this occasion had been driven by James Mitchell with Lily Shields having accompanied him. Twenty minutes later at Ballydougan, another group led by Robin Jackson broke into the O'Dowd home killing three family members. Before succumbing to a brain hemorrhage shortly afterwards on 30 January, 17-year-old Anthony Reavey had given a description of the leading gunman which was said to have fit that of McConnell. The man Anthony Reavey had described was 5"11, aged about 25 or 26, wearing a black woollen balaclava hood, green anorak, and dark trousers; <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>a</b> submachine gun. Ballistics tests show that the Sterling submachine gun used in the Reavey shootings was the same as that used in the Donnelly's Bar attack at Silverbridge.|$|E
500|$|Although two {{accounts}} {{of the number of}} searches and their timing exist, according to the King's version, the first search of the buildings in and around Parliament was made on Monday 4November—as the plotters were busy making their final preparations—by Suffolk, Monteagle, and John Whynniard. [...] They found a large pile of firewood in the undercroft beneath the House of Lords, accompanied by what they presumed to be a serving man (Fawkes), who told them that the firewood belonged to his master, Thomas Percy. [...] They left to report their findings, at which time Fawkes also left the building. [...] The mention of Percy's name aroused further suspicion as he was already known to the authorities as a Catholic agitator. [...] The King insisted that a more thorough search be undertaken. [...] Late that night, the search party, headed by Thomas Knyvet, returned to the undercroft. [...] They again found Fawkes, dressed in a cloak and hat, and wearing boots and spurs. [...] He was arrested, whereupon he gave his name as John Johnson. [...] <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>a</b> lantern now held in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, and a search of his person revealed a pocket watch, several slow matches and touchwood. [...] 36 barrels of gunpowder were discovered hidden under piles of faggots and coal. [...] Fawkes was taken to the King early on the morning of 5November.|$|E

500|$|Fuming, Sinatra began what The Los Angeles Times {{describes}} as a [...] "weekend-long tirade" [...] against the [...] "hotel's management, employees and security forces". The FBI report says the incident began when Mia Farrow lost US$20,000 at the Sands casino. Sinatra bought US$50,000 in chips and made an attempt to win the money back. [...] He lost this sum within {{a short period of}} time. [...] Sinatra then asked for credit, which was denied. It culminated when Sinatra reportedly drove a golf cart through the window of the coffee shop where casino manager Carl Cohen was seated and began [...] "screaming obscenities and anti-Semitic remarks" [...] at Cohen. Sinatra reportedly punched Cohen, a heavily built man, who responded with a smack in the mouth, bloodying Sinatra's nose and knocking two of his teeth out. [...] As a result, Sinatra never performed at the Sands again while Hughes owned it, and began performing at Caesars Palace. A number of the staff were not disappointed to see Sinatra leave the Sands. Numerous employees had been humiliated or intimidated over the years, including a busboy Sinatra tripped while <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>a</b> tray with dishes. After Sinatra left, the mobsters pulled out of the Sands and gradually left Vegas in the 1970s. [...] In the 1970s it became associated with the likes of Wayne Newton and Liberace. At this time some 30% of the performers at Sands were Italian Americans. Frank Gagliardi became the drummer for the house orchestra in 1964, starting a twelve-year tenure.|$|E

Valentin suspects that the arch-criminal is going to London to attend an international conference of clergymen, possibly to steal one of the precious religious articles on display there. Valentin crosses the Channel and takes a train to London, believing Flambeau to be hiding on board. Valentin encounters a little Catholic priest. He overhears the priest tell <b>a</b> lady that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>a</b> sterling silver cross covered in precious blue stones, which Valentin knows to be the famous [...] "Blue Cross".

He told the County Sheriff {{that it was his}} [...] "duty to help the suppressed and overthrow the suppressor." [...] In prison he twice attempted suicide, once by hanging himself with a rope made out of strips of his shirt, and a second time by cutting his wrists with his fingernails. A subsequent psychiatric assessment found him to suffer from very mild mental retardation, and to be a danger to himself and others.|$|E

[...] Very aware of how precarious his own position was, Yohannes recognized Menelik as Negus of Shewa and gave him numerous presents which included four cannons, several hundred modern Remington rifles, and ammunition for both. Menelik's submission to Yohannes brought twin policies into play: to gain the imperial throne, Menelik had to increase his revenue for the purchase of expensive and modern weapons, and in the meantime he had to maintain peace with the emperor and accede to his demands.|$|E

2500|$|Annett {{followed}} him to the station, sat down beside him, and offered some cigarettes. Von Janowski lit the cigarette using the same Belgian matches he had at the hotel. Annett grew even more suspicious and alerted a Quebec Provincial Police constable, who quickly boarded the train as it pulled away from the station and began searching for the stranger. The policeman located von Janowski, who said he was a radio salesman from Toronto. He stuck with this story until the policeman asked to search his bags; the stranger then confessed: [...] "That will not be necessary. I am a German officer who serves his country as you do yourself." [...] Inspection of von Janowski's personal effects upon his arrest revealed that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>a</b> powerful radio transmitter, among other things.|$|E

2500|$|Cash {{was last}} arrested in 1967 in Walker County, Georgia, after police found <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>a</b> bag of {{prescription}} pills {{and was in}} a car accident. Cash attempted to bribe a local deputy, who turned the money down. The singer was jailed for the night in LaFayette, Georgia. Sheriff Ralph Jones released him after giving him a long talk, warning him about the danger of his behavior and wasted potential. Cash credited that experience with helping him turn around and save his life. He later returned to LaFayette to play a benefit concert; it attracted 12,000 people (the city population was less than 9,000 at the time) and raised $75,000 for the high school.
