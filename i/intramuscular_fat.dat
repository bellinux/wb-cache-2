40|$|As {{a result}} of {{constantly}} growing consumer expectations for meat quality, the meat industry is placing more and more emphasis on quality assurance issues. Fat content in meat influences some important meat quality parameters and meat marketability. Visible <b>fat</b> includes marbling (<b>intramuscular)</b> and intermuscular <b>fat.</b> Chemical analysis is currently {{used to determine the}} fat percentage in meat.

Computer vision has enormous potential for evaluating meat quality because image processing and analysis techniques can quantitatively and consistently characterize complex geometric, colour and textural properties.

40|$|Fat {{content and}} {{composition}} are determinant factors affecting pork production and meat quality (Wood et al., 2003). Fat composition is commonly presented as {{the percentage of}} each individual fatty acid relative to total fatty acids and then some pork quality traits are described in terms of some fatty acid percentages (see for example the review by Wood et al., 2008). Despite being compositional in nature, to our knowledge there is no reference in the literature where specific compositional data analysis methods had been applied to analyze fatty acid composition. A first objective of this contribution is to analyze fatty acid composition as compositional data. In meat quality research, it is common to analyze the effect of some influential factors (such as diet, genotype, gender, live weight or age, among others) on fat content and composition, usually the subcutaneous (SF) or the <b>intramuscular</b> (IMF) <b>fats.</b> In these studies, the aim is mostly to estimate and then test the differences among treatments for fatty acid percentages. The pattern of fatty acid deposition may differ among tissue (for instance, SF or IMF) or muscle (Kloareg et al., 2007; Duran-Montgé et al., 2008), and even between localization within a specific tissue. A second objective of this manuscript is to better know the differences between fatty acid deposition pattern between tissues, localization within a tissue, and muscles. Thus, {{the purpose of the present}} study is, first, to describe a data set of fatty acid composition collected specifically for doing research on IMF content and composition and assess the main differences among IMF of three muscles and SF using compositional data methods, and, second, to apply, as a case study, specific compositional data methods to discriminate between samples of IMF and SF by fatty acid composition and compare the results with the obtained when using the traditional approach...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1966 In {{this study}} subcutaneous, inter- and <b>intramuscular</b> <b>fats</b> from 42 Hereford steers were {{analyzed}} for their fatty acid composition using gas-liquid chromatography. The same tissues were analyzed from one pair each of identical twins of Angus and Shorthorn breeding. Muscle and liver lipids from these latter four animals were fractionated on silicic acid columns into glycerides and phospholipids {{prior to the}} fatty acid analysis. Feedlot performance and carcass characteristics data were also available on these animals. The data were analyzed statistically using analysis of variance techniques and simple correlations were calculated between all the variables studied {{with the exception of}} linolenic acid. Of the ten fatty acids quantitated, only the 17 -carbon fatty acid and an 18 -carbon branched chain acid were found to differ significantly between rations. Since both these acids are believed to be synthesized by certain rumen bacteria, these differences may reflect conditions in the rumen. No direct evidence is available. However, it is probable that this involves the availability of suitable precursors or rumen conditions favorable to these species of organisms. A highly significant relationship (r =. 47) was found between average daily gain and linoleic acid. This relationship is probably also influenced by conditions in the rumen. A more rapid rate of passage or other factors which result in less extensive hydrogenation of polyunsaturated acids might also be conducive to more rapid growth. Essential fatty acids, such as linoleic, might be expected to reduce growth rates when they are deficient, however, no evidence of such a deficiency existed. Backfat thickness gave highly significant negative correlations with both myristic (r =. 44) and palmitic acid (4 =. 46) and was positively related to the 17 - and 18 -carbon fatty acids with the exception of stearic. Rib-eye area/CWT and estimated cutability, conversely, were positively and highly significantly correlated with the 14 - and 16 -carbon fatty acids and showed a negative relationship with the longer chained fatty acids. These relationships may indicate metabolic differences between the animals which deposit more lean tissue with less fat and those depositing greater amounts of fat. If, as these data indicate, meatier animals accumulate more of the 14 - and 16 -carbon fatty acids in the subcutaneous fat, a useful selection tool will be provided to the animal breeder. These 14 - and 16 -carbon fatty acids, in general showed a positive relationship between one another. When correlated with the 17 - and 18 -carbon fatty acids a negative relationship was observed. These negative relationships were particularly pronounced in the case of oleic and linoleic acids. It was suggested that the substitution of shorter chain saturated fatty acids for the longer chain unsaturates is the result of an attempt by the animal to maintain physical homeostasis of its depot fats. This assumption is based on the observation that the removal of carbon atoms has the same effect on some of the physical properties as the addition of a double bond. The data obtained in this study indicated that myristic and palmitic acid were readily substituted for oleic acid. The separation of liver and muscle lipid into glyceride and phospholipid resulted in the detection of additional components. Both muscle and liver phospholipids contained large amounts of arachidonic and eicosatrienoic acids. These acids were detected only in liver glycerides. An unknown fraction was observed in both liver glycerides and phospholipids and in muscle phospholipid. This fraction may represent a fatty aldehyde since they have been previously reported in the liver as free aldehydes and as constituents of phospholipid. The only fraction showing similar trends within twin pairs was the muscle glycerides. The muscle phospholipids and all the liver fractions showed considerable variability both within and between twin pairs...|$|R

The data also showed that docking did not change the distribution of lipid in intermuscular and intramuscular at partitions in each wholesale cut. Docked lambs tended to accumulate lower proportions of the lipid in subcutaneous at component in the cuts located along the dorsal line than intact lambs.
