5|$|Turkey's {{judicial}} {{system has been}} wholly <b>integrated</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> system of continental Europe.

5|$|After the Union of Lublin, the Senate {{of general}} sejm of the Commonwealth became {{augmented}} by Lithuanian high officials; {{the position of}} the lay and ecclesiastical lords, who served for life as members of the Senate was strengthened, as the already outnumbered middle szlachta high office holders had now proportionally fewer representatives in the upper chamber. The Senate could also be convened separately by the king in its traditional capacity of the royal council, apart from any sejm's formal deliberations, and szlachta's attempts to limit the upper chamber's role had not been successful. After the formal union and the addition of deputies from the Grand Duchy, and Royal Prussia, also more fully <b>integrated</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Crown in 1569, there were about 170 regional deputies in the lower chamber (referred to as the Sejm) and 140 senators.|$|E

5|$|As the 1970s progressed, {{silencing}} {{technology in}} submarines rendered acoustic-band sonobuoys and trigger devices ineffective. During 1961 and 1962, the Soviet Union conducted {{research and development}} into an explosive sound system (ESS) – used to locate deep-diving submarines – under the name Udar (Blow). In 1965, work had started on sonobuoy systems using ESS to be <b>integrated</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Berkut radar. The programme was postponed {{when one of the}} aircraft intended to carry it, the Ilyushin Il-38, was found to be incompatible. The developments instead resulted in the Udar-75, which was featured in a new search and targeting system (STS) of the Taganrog-built Tu-142Ms.|$|E
5|$|Chamberlain had disliked what he {{considered}} to be an overly sentimental attitude of both Baldwin and MacDonald on Cabinet appointments and reshuffles. Although he had worked closely with the President of the Board of Trade, Walter Runciman over the tariff issue, Chamberlain dismissed him from his post, offering Runciman the token position of Lord Privy Seal, which an angry Runciman declined. Runciman, a member of the Liberal National Party, was thought by Chamberlain to be lazy. Soon after taking office, Chamberlain instructed his ministers to prepare two-year policy programmes. These reports were to be <b>integrated</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> intent of co-ordinating the passage of legislation through the current Parliament, the term of which was to expire in November 1940.|$|E
5|$|Development of {{the game}} began after Uchikoshi joined Chunsoft to write a visual novel for them that could reach a wider audience; Uchikoshi {{suggested}} adding puzzle elements that are <b>integrated</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> game's story. The inspiration for the story was {{the question of where}} inspiration comes from; while researching it, Uchikoshi came across Rupert Sheldrake's morphic resonance hypothesis, which became the main theme {{of the game}}. The music was composed by Shinji Hosoe, while the characters were designed by Kinu Nishimura. The localization was handled by Aksys Games; they worked by the philosophy of keeping true to the spirit of the original Japanese version, opting for natural-sounding English rather than following the original's exact wording.|$|E

In the CBeebies British and Nick Jr. American CGI animated children's television series, Benjamin is voiced by Peter Steve Harris in the US version and Danny Price in the U.K. version.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, the SASR {{made its}} first squadron-strength {{deployment}} since Vietnam when 1 Squadron, with an attached New Zealand SAS troop, was deployed to Kuwait in February {{as part of the}} American-led Operation Desert Thunder. The force, known as Anzac Special Operations Force (ANZAC SOF), was fully <b>integrated,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> New Zealanders providing the squadron's third troop. While the crisis was resolved peacefully, if military action had been taken the SASR would have been used in the Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR) role to recover aircrew shot down by Iraqi air defences. The force returned to Australia in June 1998. Regardless, the operation represented the first time that SASR tactical headquarters had been deployed outside of Australia.|$|E
5|$|In September 2011, {{the local}} governments in Copenhagen and {{neighbouring}} Malmö in Sweden {{announced that they}} were seeking European Union funding to study a potential metro line under the Øresund to the neighbourhood of Malmö Central Station, providing faster trips and additional capacity beyond that of the existing Øresund Bridge. The study, for which the EU granted funding in the following December, will consider both a simple shuttle between the two stations and a continuous line <b>integrated</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> local transport networks on each side, and they anticipate a travel time of 15 minutes between the two city centers.|$|E

5|$|In the 1330s, {{when the}} architects of Europe were {{embracing}} the Flamboyant style, English architecture {{moved away from the}} Flowing Decorated in an entirely different and much more sober direction with the reconstruction, in highly modular form, of the choir of the Norman abbey, now cathedral, at Gloucester. The Perpendicular style, which relies on a network of intersecting mullions and transoms rather than on a diversity of richly carved forms for effect, gives an overall impression of great unity, in which the structure of the vast windows of both clerestory and east end are <b>integrated</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> arcades below and the vault above. The style proved very adaptable and continued with variations in the naves of Canterbury and Winchester, and in the choir of York.|$|E
5|$|Presented with a jewelled brooch as a {{farewell}} gift by her fellow officers, Stevenson asked that its value instead be put towards a scholarship for an ex-WAAAF member to study social {{work at the}} University of Sydney. The WAAAF itself, the first and largest of Australia's wartime women's services, was disbanded on 30September 1946. It was succeeded in 1950 by a new organisation with a separate charter to the RAAF, the Women's Royal Australian Air Force (WRAAF). WRAAF members achieved a pay scale equal to the male service in 1972, and five years later were <b>integrated</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> RAAF.|$|E
5|$|The A1 is a tolled {{motorway}} {{based on}} the vehicle classification in Croatia using a closed toll system <b>integrated</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> A6 motorway as the two connect in the Bosiljevo2 interchange forming a unified toll system. Since the two motorways are operated by Autocesta Rijeka— Zagreb and Hrvatske autoceste, the toll collection system is operated jointly by the two operators. The toll is payable in Croatian kuna, euro, major credit and debit cards and using a number of prepaid toll collection systems including various types of smart cards issued by the motorway operators and ENC – an electronic toll collection (ETC) which is shared at all motorways in Croatia (except the A2 motorway) and provides drivers use of dedicated lanes at toll plazas and a discounted toll rates.|$|E
