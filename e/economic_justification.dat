5|$|The dam {{was first}} {{proposed}} in the 1950s; construction work commenced in 1968, involving the diversion of the North Fork American River through a tunnel {{and the construction of}} a massive earthen cofferdam. Following a nearby earthquake and the discovery of a seismic fault that underlay the dam site, work on the project was halted for fears that the dam's design would not allow it to survive a major quake on the same fault zone. Although the dam was redesigned and a new proposal submitted by 1980, spiraling costs and limited <b>economic</b> <b>justification</b> {{put an end to the}} project until severe flooding in 1986 briefly renewed interest in Auburn's flood control potential. The California State Water Resources Control Board denied water rights for the dam project in 2008 due to lack of construction progress.|$|E

The present paper focuses on the European competition policy and its two important general frameworks: Articles 101 and 102 of the Treaty for Establishing the European Community. The two articles prohibit various entrepreneurial actions on a market which can affect the consumer welfare and also, the competition between entrepreneurs. The paper attempts to find <b>economic</b> <b>justifications</b> of the European Commission’s interventions on the market, which is the authority responsible for enforcing the two articles, and also to deliver an alternative theory of the market {{in the tradition of the}} Austrian school of economics. The reason for this purpose is that the <b>economic</b> <b>justifications</b> would be the only to legitimate the competition laws...|$|R

With the Corps unable to provide a sound <b>economic</b> <b>justification,</b> New Melones I was ultimately shelved in 1954. Meanwhile, the Oakdale and South San Joaquin irrigation districts had conducted their own study in the late 1940s and proposed a bigger dam, [...] tall with a capacity of 1.1 million acre feet (1.4 km3), or approximately one year's worth of Stanislaus River runoff.|$|E
2500|$|The British South Africa Company was {{responsible}} for building the Rhodesian railway system {{in the period of}} primary construction which ended in 1911, when the main line through Northern Rhodesia reached the Congo border and the Katanga copper mines. Rhodes' original intention was for a railway extending across the Zambesi to Lake Tanganyika, popularly considered as part of a great [...] "Cape to Cairo" [...] railway linking all the British colonies of Africa. Rhodes was as much a capitalist in his motivation as a visionary, and when little gold was found in Mashonaland, he accepted that even the scheme to reach Lake Tanganyika had no <b>economic</b> <b>justification.</b> Railways built by private companies without government subsidies need enough of the type of traffic that can pay high freight rates to recover their construction costs. The agricultural products that fuelled much of Rhodesia's early economic growth could not provide this traffic; large quantities of minerals could. Most early railways in Africa were built by the British government rather than Chartered Companies. The need to raise capital and produce dividends prevented most Chartered Companies from undertaking such infrastructure investments. However, in the early period of railway construction, the BSAC obtained finance from South African companies including Consolidated Gold Fields and De Beers in which Rhodes was a dominant force. BSAC also benefitted from the large, but not unlimited personal fortunes of Rhodes and Beit before their deaths.|$|E

40|$|The ECJ has {{frequently}} {{stated that it}} is a general rule that “economic” aims are precluded as justifications for restrictions on free movement. This on its face suggests that free movement always and automatically trumps national economic interests. However, in reality the Court’s approach to balancing these different interests is much more complex: often, and increasingly, interests of an economic nature are in fact recognised in the Court’s case law. This paper suggests that this rule precluding <b>economic</b> aims as <b>justifications</b> therefore requires reformulating. It is argued that this is necessary not merely to reflect the reality of the case law, but also to improve the transparency and quality of judicial decision-making. The paper then also examines how the current prohibition might be reformulated in light of both the policy considerations underlying the current formulation (embodying a degree of caution in accepting economic interests) and the problems with that formulation. It is suggested {{that it is a}}ppropriate to maintain a kind of rule against economic objectives, but a more nuanced one concerned solely with measures that have a protectionist aim – the original target of the “general” rule prohibiting <b>economic</b> <b>justifications.</b> On the other hand, with measures that do not have protectionist aims, recognition of economic objectives should be determined on a case-by-case basis that is attuned to the wide variety of economic interests that exist. An important group of measures within the latter category comprises those directed at protection of Member States’ budgetary interests. These warrant special attention and the paper also examines how these interests can be suitably addressed {{within the context of the}} framework proposed above. According to the Court’s current approach, in theory budgetary justifications are prohibited as a consequence of the rule against <b>economic</b> <b>justifications</b> in general. However, it is explained that, like certain other <b>economic</b> <b>justifications,</b> they are in reality often permitted, being allowed in certain defined and specific circumstances. Further, where they are permitted, the Court limits application of the proportionality test in that it does not examine whether alternative means might be used to recoup the lost revenue. In this way the Court balances national economic interests and free movement but avoids various constitutional and practical difficulties of applying a proportionality test to do so. It is proposed that the Court should continue with this approach. However, it needs to acknowledge that it does accept justifications that are budgetary in nature, and that these constitute exceptions to any general rule against budgetary justifications. It might also be appropriate, further, to accept budgetary justifications as a general rule in addition to existing, specific, budgetary justifications whenever there is a significant impact on a specific programme budget. However, it is acknowledged that this approach is not consistent with the case law...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to show the necessity of reviving the debate on the <b>economic</b> <b>justifications</b> for patent protection. On the one hand, we see the need for the assessment of the overall welfare consequences of the existing systems of patent protection, and on the other hand, we believe that major changes to the patent law should be considered. Critical review of the discussion on patents shows that the weaknesses of many arguments for patent protection, as well as the resulting adverse effects of the patent laws have been know for a long time. The analysis of the strategic behavior of firms shows that patent protection has often been misused and may negatively affect the total welfare...|$|R
