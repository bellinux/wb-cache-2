40|$|Faced {{with the}} problem of how to process {{valuable}} refractory sulphide ore in the early 1900 s, Kalgoorlie mining engineers and metallurgist, and their consultants, borrowed ideas from a variety of international sources to develop new equipment and new procedures. This paper examines the sources of these innovations and how they spread with remarkable speed through the medium of the tight-knit group of international metallurgical consultants. The inter-relationship between international technological transfer and increased local inventiveness, stimulated by the rapid changes in technology, and the opportunities and limitations experienced by Australian metallurgical <b>inventers</b> in the 1900 s are also examined.

There were several sins that he was given to, when but a little one, that manifested him to be notoriously infected with Or[i]ginal corruption; for I dare say he learned none of them of his Father or Mother; nor was he admitted to go much abroad among other Children, that were vile, to learn to sin of them: Nay, contrariwise, if at any time he did get abroad amongst others, he would be as the <b>Inventer</b> of bad words, and an example in bad actions. To them all he used to be, as we say, the Ring- leader, and Master-sinner from a Childe.|$|E

In the adopted hybrid active filter there is a passive power filter with high power rating to filter the low order harmonies and one active filter with low power rating to filter the other high order harmonies.

ABSTRACT: The fascinating mechanical inventions aiming at {{the welfare of the}} human kind started from ancient Egyptians and continued development through different eras. In the medieval centuries, the Islamic civilization paid wonderful attention to mechanical engineering. Banu Mosa invented 100 ingenious devices including automatic fountains and automatic feedback level control systems. Al-Jazari invented 50 mechanical devices including automatic fountains, clocks, positive displacement pumps and robotics. Taqi Al-Din invented a 6 -cylinder positive displacement pump. Those great <b>inventers</b> used clean-energy prime movers in the form of windmills, overshot water wheels and undershot water wheels (turbines). This paper focuses only on windmills, water wheels and automatic fountains...|$|R

Of late, the use of hydrogen has become a hot topic discussed among <b>inventers</b> as it {{has the ability to}} assist as well as posses the potential in becoming a new form of alternative source for transportation. In this thesis, a conceptual study of a hydrogen powered bicycle by using fuel cell technology is studied. In this study, a small hydrogen generator with nine plates of stainless steel was fabricated. The hydrogen generator is capable of producing desirable quantities of hydrogen. The mass flow rate of the hydrogen was computed based on the current supplied. A rechargeable battery was chosen due to long life span and low maintenance. Apart from that, due to its desirable light weight properties, the hydrogen consumption of the bicycle is reduced. A brushless electric motor providing 200 Watt power to drive the bicycle was fitted. The maximum weight that the bicyle is able to withstand is around 60 kg, while the maximum speed attained is 25 km/hr under such weight considered...|$|R

40|$|A new custom IC design {{methodology}} {{and the associated}} logic VLSI chip, which offer an ultimately fast turnaround-time logic IC construction method, are proposed. Using the new VLSI chip, digital system and logic designers can construct their own real IC chip with thousands of logic gates, as easily as if they drew logic diagrams to be implemented {{in the form of}} a printed-circuit board, which would utilize standard logic IC families. This construction can even be carried out in a second, because logic structures can be reconfigured electrically, due to on-chip programmable interconnection capability. This chip contains various kinds of logic functional blocks, such as <b>inventers,</b> NOR’s, NAND’s, flip-flops, shift registers, counters, adders, multiplexers, ALU’s, and so on. Up to 200 SSI/MSI standard logic blocks can be provided. The E^ 2 PROM-type MOSFET switch matrix is adjacent to the functional blocks, in order to connect any output to specific inputs of the functional blocks. It also offers a ready-to-test aid, obtained by monitoring the signal waveform developed inside the chip. These features have the advantage over the present custom IC design methods, such as gate array, standard cell, silicon compiler, or programmable logic array (PLA) approaches, in the sense that the designer can easily redesign the logic to obtain a digital system in an IC even within one day...|$|R

They are being examined to determine research potentials of research centers, universities, and inventors. The aim {{of this study is to}} map the past and current trends in patenting activities with a view to better understanding and tracking the changing nature of science and technology in Iran. The patenting activity in the Iran was investigated for the period 1976 – 2011, based on the USPTO, WIPO, and EPO (Esp@cenet). We analyzed the affiliation of <b>inventers</b> and collected patents which have at least an Iranian inventor. The collected data were analyzed applying Microsoft Excel. Analytical results demonstrate that between 1976 and 2011, 212 patents have been registered by Iranian inventors in the three above-mentioned databases. The average number of Iranian patents registered per year has increased significantly from 25 in 1976 – 1980 period to 119 in 2006 – 2011. It was noted that the highest number of registered patents (27 %) were in ‘‘chemistry, metallurgy’’ area of International Patent Classification (IPC), followed by ‘‘human necessities’’ (18 %), ‘‘electricity’’ (17 %), and ‘‘performing operations; transporting’’ (15 %). Overall, it can be concluded that patent-activities are highly country-specific, the results indicate that Iran is focused on ‘‘chemistry, metallurgy’’ technology...|$|R
40|$|Believing that {{renewable}} energy innovation {{is just one}} of many ways to wean humankind's dependence on fossil fuels, this paper explores alternative methods by which a firm may align the needs of those stakeholders (<b>Inventers,</b> Entrepreneurs, and Consumers) deemed critical to the creation and commercialization of {{renewable energy}} solutions. The literature suggests that innovative efforts are best served when Inventors work in peer-driven communities founded on open source principles, Entrepreneurs adopt open innovation in which they actively source R&D beyond their walls, and Consumers allow Inventors and Entrepreneurs to work harmoniously together. While all three stakeholder groups may be singularly focused on renewable energy innovation, combining them within one framework proves challenging due to competing interests regarding funding, intellectual property ownership, and governance. Instrumental stakeholder theory suggests that resolving these competing interests is a job best suited for a centralized firm capable of identifying, prioritizing, and balancing the different needs within the stakeholder constellation. However, the inclusion of this firm introduces one additional stakeholder (the shareholder) whose profit-maximization interests, by law, take priority over all others needs and interests. Using Delphi-inspired research methodology, this paper explores what might emerge if stakeholders created a self-sustaining system in which managerial decisions were governed solely by the renewable energy goals of Consumers, Inventors, and Entrepreneurs rather than by the profit-maximization goals of shareholders...|$|R

In front of the building, there is a famous rock named Thousand Years Rock. There is Chinese characters carved by Si-yeol Song on the rock. The rock is also {{a symbol of the}} school. There are also Statue of Jang Yeong-sil and a statue named 'a Site of Creation' in front of the building. Jang Yeoung-sil is a famous <b>inventer</b> of The Kingdom of Joseon who invented Joseon's first rain gauge. Wu-am {{building is}} a romote building. It is located on the hill and also far from Yuihang building and Yeji building, the main buildings of the school. But, there are several important classrooms such as korean classrooms, math classrooms, and social studies classrooms in the building, so students have to take a long walk whenever they have one of those classes in next period. The fastest way to get the building is using a path linking a cafateria in the Yuihang building and the Wu-am building. This path also has a cover that protect students from rain on it. In {{the first floor of the}} building, there are audiovisual room and a multipurpose classroom. Also, It gets damp in rainy season in the first floor, because it has poor ventilation. In the second floor, there are some multipurpose classrooms and a teachers' rooms. One of the teachers' rooms in the second floor of Wu-am {{building is a}} biggest teachers' room in the school. Also, there is a big stairway that we can use to go second floor directly from outside of the building. In the third floor, there are math classrooms and a teachers' room for math teachers. In the forth floor, there are korean classrooms and social studies classrooms and some multipurpose classrooms and a teacher's room for social studies teachers and Korean teachers. The building has two stairs, one on the left side and the other on the right side. In addition, on the center of the building, there is a bathroom.|$|E

40|$|This book {{presents}} a timely reconfiguration of {{the relations between}} art, philosophy, ethics, and aesthetics. Through connection {{with a range of}} contemporary social and philosophical issues and movements, this collection of essays highlights the imperative of sensorial aesthetics. The book focuses on the radical philosophical approach to aesthetics enabled by the works of Jean-François Lyotard and Gilles Deleuze. From these philosophers an older meaning of aesthetic has been recalled. Before it indicated primarily the theory of art and beauty, aesthetic referred to the sensibility, the capacity to receive sensations. In summoning this sensorial meaning of aesthetics in their respective works, Lyotard, Deleuze, and other recent thinkers turn the philosophical theory of aesthetics away from the dominance of cognitivist and reception theories, and towards a thinking of aesthetics through considerations of the movements of matter, affect, and sensation. This vital transformation of aesthetics in turn allows a reconfiguration {{of the relationship between the}} domains of art, aesthetics, and philosophy. If aesthetics focuses on sensation, rather than cognition, then artists, musicians, and philosophers alike appear not only as phenomenological and empirical thinkers, but as experimenters with the parameters of the sensible, able to extend our perceptual interface with the world. Rather than artists deferring to philosophers in regard to the meaning of their works, this new understanding of aesthetics suggests that philosophers ought to defer to artists, who are understood as <b>inventers</b> in the realm of sensibility...|$|R

The invention shall be be susceptible of industrial application, which means that {{it should be possible to}} reproduce or use in any other industrial way. The reqirement that the invention shall be new means that the technique must not be previously known because of patents, published articles, etc. That an invention shall be a contribution to the state of the art in a technical field means that the invention shall not be obvious to invent for a person skilled in the art. Patents do effect the innovation among the <b>inventers,</b> but in most industries most inventions would be invented independent if there was a patent system or not. Only in pharmaceuticals- and chemicals industries, the patent is of a great importance. Patents are probably of lesser importance for the computer industry than for those industries, even though the industry is of great importance for many other industries and therefor, the patent system can be of great importance for some computer-implemented inventions as well. There is a risque the the competition is negatively affected by the patent system, becuase of the monopoly it gives. I believe, though, that the gain of the patent system compensates for the risque of imperfections in the market. The free movement for goods, persons, services and capital will probably not be affected if the proposal of the directive about patentibility of computer-implemented invention will get passed...|$|R

40|$|Contrary to {{the idea}} of {{following}} a precise conceptual plan in what concerns translation choices and beliefs, and to the detriment of traditional more prescriptive views on translation techniques, the possibility of intuition and creativity surface from contemporary critiques upon the matter. Such shift has not only bestowed translations with a deserved arena for them to perform their task, but has actually provided them with important tools for one to position him/herself socially and politically in what regards an issue that have always been social and political: the text. When I kidnap meaning from the original and suggest it actually belongs to every instance that happens to touch it, the autonomy inevitably directed by this process towards translator and reader ultimately grants both an opportunity to inflict a material and consistent influence on such meaning. That  is, when I pose that meanings do not belong to the original, such meanings end up losing their status of “possessions” – and eventually one learns they do not belong to anyone at all. The question one might be asking is: why would this autonomy to transform necessarily change anything for those involved in the enterprise of translation? Well, it does change many things; not to say everything. As translators acknowledge the active role they play for the maintenance or alteration of certain narratives, their task is no longer taken as a simple – uncontrollable – code transferring; i. e., translators are turned from rewriters into writers, from carriers  of old meanings into <b>inventers</b> of new ones. In the book Interconnecting Translation Studies and Imagology (2015) – edited by Peter Flynn, Luc van Doorslaer, and Joep Leerssen – the authors and compiled articles address {{the fact that it is}} only through a more autonomous notion of translation that questionable cultural aspects, as well as prejudiced images of this or that tradition, might be finally overcome...|$|R
40|$|Studiens syfte är att undersöka arterna Buxbaumia viridis och Nowellia curvifolia för att kunna förutse var man hittar dessa signalarter. Detta gjordes genom att död liggande ved undersöktes i Ycke naturreservat samt en närliggande brukas skog, Östergötlands län. Resultaten visar att faktorerna som är avgörande för B. virids är markkontakt och nedbrytningsklass. B. viridis föredrar att växa på lågor i de högre nedbrytningsklasserna (4 - 7) och med stor andel markkontakt, över 80 %. N. curvifolia beror på {{diameter}} (över 60 cm), nedbrytningsklass (3 - 4) och längd (över 30 m). Baserat på dessa resultat, kan signalarter lättare upptäckas utan en fullskalig <b>inventering</b> av skogen. Young trees dominate Swedish forests, {{which today}} have {{a shortage of}} downed dead wood, key biotopes, and an overall lack of high natural values. By using the mosses Buxbaumia viridis and Nowellia curvifolia the general state of a forest can be assessed. These species indicate high natural values, with a continuity of dead wood in different stages of decay. By investigating ground-lying dead wood, one can predict if the mosses occur in the area or not. This is useful for maintenance of the forests and the preservation of biological diversity. The {{purpose of this study}} was to study the species B. viridis and N. curvifolia in Ycke natural reserve in Östergötland, southern Sweden, and learn how to predict where these species occur. The results showed that ground contact (over 80 %) and stage of decay (stage 4 - 6) of logs were important to B. viridis, with test values 30 - 50 times as high as the other test values. To N. curvifolia, the diameter of the logs was the most important. Decay stage and length of the log were also important factors to N. curvifolia. Based on these results, these indicator species can more easily detected without a full scale inventory of the forest...|$|R
40|$|Purpose- Just {{before the}} {{approval}} of the Bayh dole Act, universities and colleges in the United States of America were used to be associations with the main aim focused on research and education and they could not imagine taking other missions. The approval of this act gave universities the right to submit and take advantage of their research results and academic achievements as intellectual properties which were done by governmental budget. Still over fifty years the Bayh dole Act is considered as the most inspiring act and significant factor in salient development of innovation and its consequent national productivity in the 1990 s economy of America. With the encouraging economic and financial outcomes, many other countries like Iran got enthusiastic to authorize and implement the same act. Although Islamic Republic of Iran with developing economy has approved similar academic commercialization rules, they were not successful in practice. Consequently they could not result to similar effects of the Bayh dole Act such as the mutation in development of academic innovation or the commercialization of knowledge base products in universities and, apparently they could not even increase the transfer technology offices (TTO) or the number of university patents and products either. Design/methodology/approach- This article first introduces the background and the contexts of the Bayh dole passage in America and then explains the Act‟s main outcomes in America‟s innovation and academic commercialization system. Also it takes a brief look at the similar rules and regulations in other countries including Singapore, China and India. Findings- Moreover, this article contains the comparative study of these regulations and related acts in other countries, especially in America, and their similarities and differences. Finally, by interviewing the Iranian <b>inventers</b> and experts, the defect of internal acts, factors and reasons of their disappointed implementation are illustrated.
