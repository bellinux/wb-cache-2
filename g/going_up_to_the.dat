5|$|There {{are three}} {{staircase}} exits: two <b>going</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> northeastern {{corner of the}} intersection of Grand and Chrystie Streets, and one <b>going</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> northwestern corner. The station originally only had the two street stairs to the northeastern corner of the intersection, but due to growing ridership over the years—mainly by commuters from various Brooklyn neighborhoods to Manhattan's Chinatown—the third staircase to the northwestern corner was added in 1999.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the decade, the Independence Pass Foundation (IPF) was {{formally}} incorporated in Aspen. Its founder, environmental activist Bob Lewis, had been organizing efforts to revegetate the slopes alongside Highway 82 <b>going</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> pass, in order to repair damage that had been done the road's construction. In cooperation with the Highway Department, the U.S. Forest Service and the county, the IPF rebuilt a curve along the road near the Weller Lake trailhead that year.|$|E
5|$|The other fare {{control area}} at the station's east (railroad north) end, {{accessed}} by a ramp to the platform, is unstaffed, containing full height turnstiles and two staircases <b>going</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> northwest and southeast corners of East 205th Street and Perry Avenue. The token booth at this location was closed on July 30, 2005 and removed sometime afterward.|$|E

5|$|Hammond console organs {{come with}} a wooden pedalboard played with the feet, for bass notes. Most console Hammond pedalboards have 25 notes, with the bottom note a low C and the top note a middle C two octaves higher. Hammond used a 25-note pedalboard because he found that on {{traditional}} 32-note pedalboards used in church pipe organs, the top seven notes were seldom used. The Hammond Concert models E, RT, RT-2, RT-3 and D-100 had 32-note American Guild of Organists (AGO) pedalboards <b>going</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> G above middle C as the top note. The RT-2, RT-3 and D-100 also contained a separate solo pedal system that had its own volume control and various other features. Spinet models have 12- or 13-note miniature pedalboards.|$|E
5|$|The video {{opens with}} Spears {{and her friends}} in a hotel room, where a tabloid {{reporter}} on television criticizes her for the sexy, revealing outfits she's often seen wearing publicly. Spears and her friends express their disagreement with the report. Spears, determined to be self-sufficient and unaffected by media comments, then makes {{a phone call to}} her bodyguard, and using a cloth to disguise the sound of her voice, coaxes him to leave the area so that her group may sneak out of the hotel and enjoy the day. They run into an elevator and fool around briefly with the security cameras before <b>going</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> main lobby. A strut down the lobby of the hotel and a short dance sequence follows. As they leave the hotel, they follow towards the dance club. However, before they arrive, they're caught in an alley by several paparazzi, and start to perform a dance routine {{in the middle of the}} rain. As they make their entrance, they're dripping wet, an image which makes for more sensationalist fodder for the tabloid reporter.|$|E
5|$|The upper {{handling}} {{room was}} {{just below the}} visible part of the mount. It was armored and reinforced to support {{the weight of the}} mount. A person standing in the upper handling room could look up and see the bottom of the gun mount inside the training circle on which the mount rotated. Hanging from the mount, and rotating with it, was the equipment used to pass ammunition up to the mount. This included the lower ends of the projectile and powder case hoists. In {{the center of the room}} there was a vertical tube that also turned with the mount. This tube enclosed the electrical power and control cables <b>going</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mount. Around the perimeter of the upper handling room were the ready service ammunition racks welded to the bulkheads. Close by, either in a corner of the handling room or in an adjoining compartment was the upper end of an ammunition hoist from the magazine. The responsibility of the men stationed in the upper handling room was to shuttle 30 to 40 projectiles and 30 to 40 powder cases per minute from the ready service racks to the hoists while avoiding the equipment rotating with the mount. During quiet spells, they would replenish the ready service racks with ammunition from the magazines.|$|E

25|$|This station's second fare {{control area}} {{is at the}} station's extreme western end. A single {{staircase}} from each platform go up to a raised crossover split in two by a steel fence. The Manhattan-bound side has a turnstile bank, token booth, and one staircase <b>going</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> northeast corner of 21st Street and 44th Drive while the Queens-bound side has two exit-only turnstiles and one staircase <b>going</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> southeast corner of that same intersection. All fare control areas have their original IND-style directional mosaics.|$|E
25|$|The {{south end}} of the {{northbound}} IRT platform has a same-level unstaffed fare control area containing full height turnstiles and two staircases <b>going</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south corners of West 59th Street and Broadway.|$|E

25|$|The {{southbound}} platform has {{a part-time}} fare control {{area near the}} south end. A seven-step staircase goes up to a turnstile bank and outside fare control, there is a customer assistance booth and one staircase <b>going</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> front entrance of the Doubletree Metropolitan Hotel on {{the southwest corner of}} Lexington Avenue and East 50th Street. It is the southernmost station on the Lexington Avenue Line to be directly under Lexington Avenue itself. South from here, the line shifts slightly westward to Park Avenue.|$|E
25|$|This {{came to a}} {{head when}} a {{fugitive}} criminal claimed sanctuary in an Augustinian church in Manila. An artilleryman, Francisco de Nava, owned a female slave named María, with whom he was having illicit relations. The archbishop, upon learning this, ordered Nava to sell the slave. When he refused, she was taken from him and sold. The artilleryman soon tried to get the slave back, declaring he wanted to marry her. One day he saw the woman passing in a carriage with her new mistress, who happened to be the governor-general's wife. <b>Going</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> carriage, he spoke to the woman, but she replied that she preferred to be the slave of another than his wife. Thereupon Nava, blind with anger, drew his dagger and killed her.|$|E
25|$|Danielson lost {{a minute}} {{in the overall}} {{classification}} in stage 18, ending at the Col du Galibier, but remained ninth overall, with time gaps above and below him making it unlikely he would gain or lose any positions as the race went forward. He lost {{more time in the}} stage 20 individual time trial, but not his overall placement. That position held on the Tour's final stage the next day. Farrar was fourth in the final sprint, behind Cavendish, Boasson Hagen, and Greipel. The squad finished as winners of the teams classification. When <b>going</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> podium to accept the award, the eight remaining riders and Vaughters brought with them a cardboard cutout of Zabriskie, the only team member who had to leave the race. Danielson's ninth-place finish extended the team's streak of placing a rider in the top ten each year they participated in the Tour.|$|E

25|$|In 1868, the horse-drawn tram company Compañía de Tranvías al Paso del Molino y Cerro {{created the}} first lines {{connecting}} Montevideo with Unión, the beach resort of Capurro and the industrialized and economically independent Villa del Cerro, at the time called Cosmopolis. In the same year, the Mercado del Puerto was inaugurated. In 1869, the first railway line of the company Ferrocarril Central del Uruguay was inaugurated connecting Bella Vista with the town of Las Piedras. During the same year and the next, the neighbourhoods Colón, Nuevo París and La Comercial were founded. The famous to our days Sunday market of Tristán Narvaja Street was established in Cordón in 1870. Public water supply was established in 1871. In 1878, Bulevar Circunvalación was constructed, a boulevard starting from Punta Carretas, <b>going</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{north end of the}} city and then turning west to end at the beach of Capurro. It was renamed to Artigas Boulevard (its current name) in 1885. By Decree, on 8 January 1881, the area Los Pocitos was incorporated to the Novísima Ciudad (Most New City).|$|E
25|$|Inside the lobby, Sweeny, District Engineer Farley and his firemen, Cain, and {{the other}} police {{officers}} eventually cleared the dress circle stairs {{to work their way}} up to the doors, where there was the connecting doorway to the family gallery stairway. They tried <b>going</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> family gallery but were stopped by thick smoke. They heard no traffic on the stairway, heard no human sounds. They called up but received no response. Farley ordered one last inspection of the dress circle, but saw no activity. Nor was there any signs of life in the parquet and orchestra, below, now burning fiercely. To Farley the building seemed evacuated, barring, perhaps, a few stragglers. Not wanting to subject himself or others to any further risk, he ordered his men to quit the building. Within minutes, cracks appeared on the exterior theatre walls facing Johnson street, where, within, the heart of the blaze raged. At 11:45pm, less than a half hour after J. W. Thorpe had spied a flame no larger than his hand, the Johnson Street end of the building collapsed and an intense rush of air was drawn in, feeding the flames. Anyone who could speak of events transpiring within the building had already left.|$|E
25|$|The nigral afferences {{come from}} the pars reticulata of the substantia nigra. The axons do not {{constitute}} a conspicuous bundle. They are placed medially to the pallidal and ascend almost vertically. A part of the territory is posterior and inferior <b>going</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> anterior pole of the central complex. This part sometimes designated as VM is simply the posterior continuation of the nigral territory. There is indeed no more VM in the upper primates where the pallidal and nigral territories are everywhere separated. In the whole territory axons expand widely (François et al., 2002) allowing no precise map, which is confirmed by physiology (Wichemann and Kliem, 2004). VA is crossed by the mammillothalamic bundle. The mediator of the nigro-thalamic connection is, as for the pallido-thalamic the inhibitor GABA. In addition to nigral, VA receives amygdalar and tectal (superior colliculus) axons. The thalamo-cortical axons go to the frontal cortex, the cingulate cortex, the premotor cortex and the oculomotor fields FEF and SEF. It is important to stress the necessity from now to clearly distinguish the pallidal VO and the nigral VA territories. The fact {{that they do not}} lead to the same cortical areas and systems is alone one reason for this. The physiology of the two territories is also different (van Donkelaar et al., 1999).|$|E

25|$|Boat Train Ride - This {{ride was}} {{introduced}} {{at the beginning}} of the 1972 season. A motorized lead boat piloted by a Dogpatch employee pulled a train of non-motorized boats behind it.

500|$|This {{station has}} two fare control areas.

[...] Because of the varying topography of the surrounding neighborhood, a single escalator was installed in 1937 in this fare control area, traversing an elevation difference of [...] between the mezzanine and platform. Access to fare control otherwise requires walking up three flights of stairs from platform level.|$|E

500|$|On 6 February Momolo Mortara gave {{an account}} of the case that contradicted the inquisitor's at almost every turn; in Rome, he said, Edgardo had been [...] "frightened, and intimidated by the rector's presence, [...] he openly {{declared}} his desire to return home with us". Carboni then travelled to San Giovanni in Persiceto to interrogate Morisi, who gave her age as 23 rather than the actual 26. Morisi said that Edgardo had fallen sick in the winter of 1851–52, when he was about four months old. She recounted having seen the Mortaras sitting sadly by Edgardo's crib and [...] "reading from a book in Hebrew that the Jews read when one of them is about to die". She repeated her account of giving Edgardo an emergency baptism at the instigation of the grocer Lepori and later telling the story to a neighbour's servant called Regina, adding that she had also told her sisters about the baptism. As before, Lepori denied any role in the affair whatsoever, indeed saying he could not even remember Morisi. The [...] "Regina" [...] in Morisi's story was identified as Regina Bussolari; though Morisi averred to have told her the whole story, Bussolari professed to know nothing of the case. She said that she had only spoken with Morisi [...] "once or twice, when she was <b>going</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> storage room to get something", and never about {{anything to do with the}} Mortaras' children.|$|E
