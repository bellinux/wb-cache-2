40|$|<b>Flood</b> <b>water</b> <b>harvesting</b> and {{underground}} storage {{is a concept}} that has received significant attention in many regions of the world. Its intention is to capture floodwater from currently flooded areas and to store it for later use, in order to both, reduce damage caused by floods, as well as to satisfy demands for water during drier periods. This paper presents a preliminary analysis of the prospects for its realization in Sri Lanka. A coarse scale suitability index is constructed and mapped at district level in order to identify the districts having higher prospects for its implementation. Preliminary results indicate three main clusters of highly suitable districts, subject to favourable geological conditions. Cluster 1 consists of Ampara and Batticalao, Cluster 2 of Kurunegala, Anuradhapura and Mannar, and Cluster 3 of Ratnapura. The potential for groundwater recharge of the highly suitable clusters need special investigation prior to arriving at concrete conclusions. If successfully implemented, this concept may prove a valuable intervention for adapting to current and future floods and droughts...|$|E
40|$|Spate {{irrigation}} is {{a method}} of <b>flood</b> <b>water</b> <b>harvesting,</b> practiced in Dera Ismael Khan (D. I. Khan), Pakistan for agricultural production {{for the last several}} hundred years in which during monsoon period flood water is used for irrigation before wheat sowing. A field study on the effect of different pre-sowing water application depths on the yield of wheat was conducted during 2006 - 2007. The spate irrigation command areas normally receive the flood water as a result of rainfall on the mountains during the months of July to September, which also carries a significant amount of sediment load. The flood water flows in different torrents and is diverted through earthen bunds to the fields for irrigation with depth of water application ranging from 21 to 73 cm and resulted in sediment deposition of 1. 8 - 3. 6 cm per irrigation. In this study, the effect on wheat yield of three different pre-sowing water application depths (D 1 45 cm) were studied under field conditions. Fifteen fields with field sizes of about 2 - 3 ha were randomly selected, in each field five samples were collected for analysis of soil physical properties, yield and yield components. Five major soil texture classes (silty clay, clay loam, silty clay loam, silt loam and loam) were found in the area with water-holding capacity ranging from 23 % to 36. 3 % (on a volume basis) and bulk density varied from 1. 35 to 1. 42 gcm- 3. About 36 % more grain yield was obtained from loam soil fields, followed by silt loam (24 %) as compared to wheat grown on silty clay soil condition. The maximum wheat grain yield of 3448 kgha- 1 was obtained from fields with water application depths of 30 - 45 cm and the lowest wheat yield was recorded in fields with water application depths greater than 45 cm. On-farm application efficiencies ranged from 22 % to 93 % with an overall average of about 49 %. Due to large and uneven fields, a lot of water is lost. In general, the application efficiency decreased with increasing water application depth. Based on the results of this research, in arid to semi-arid environments, for optimum wheat yield under spate irrigation, the pre-sowing water application depth may be about 30 - 45 cm (September to July) and under or over irrigation should be avoided.

In this study, the impacts of urban expansion on potential <b>flooding,</b> storage and <b>water</b> <b>harvesting</b> were assessed for the period 1976 – 2016 using rainfall data recorded during the same period. Sharjah is a generally a flat coastal city that is located in a dry hot region average rainfall of approximately 100 mm/y. Remote sensing and GIS techniques were used to assess the expansion of built areas in the city using multi-temporal Landsat satellite images. The built areas in the city increased during the study period by approximately four folds while the population increased by more than 10 folds. The study results demonstrate the historical increase in runoff potential, flooding potential and runoff coefficient and decline in water storage potential.

A community <b>water</b> <b>harvesting</b> scheme is presently under construction in the Glenmark area of North Canterbury which was designed using traditional methods. The objectives of this thesis were to assess the limitations of traditional design methods for <b>water</b> <b>harvesting</b> schemes using the Glenmark Scheme as a case study and to develop an improved method based on a systems modelling approach. A daily simulation model was developed that incorporated in a realistic way the engineering, hydrologic, agronomic and economic features of importance to the design of <b>water</b> <b>harvesting</b> schemes in New Zealand.

It was demonstrated that compounding conservatism inherent in traditional design methods resulted in scheme overdesign and that the ability of the systems model to capture the essential dynamics of the system allowed higher levels of design performance to be achieved.

40|$|Traditional {{management}} of scarce water resources has been {{practiced in the}} Middle East for thousands of years. They were developed to encompass a sustainable agricultural production in spite of small rainfall amounts in often harsh arid to semiarid environments with poor soil quality (e. g., jessour, tabiah, meskat, khooshab, qanat). Due to their efficiency, revitalized systems have been suggested {{as a way to}} at least partially cope with the present water crises in the Middle East. However, equally important to the techniques that involve harvesting of sporadic rainfall is the social organization behind the development and the continuous maintenance of the joint water-soil-plant systems. This social system is built on sharing <b>harvested</b> <b>water</b> for the entire community in the managed region. Designing improved management systems for control of <b>flood</b> <b>water</b> and rainwater <b>harvesting</b> would thus also require a re-vitalization or re-habilitation of the social system behind the development and maintenance.

However, there is no strong empirical evidence that shows the effects of intensification of <b>water</b> <b>harvesting</b> on upstream–downstream social–ecological systems at a landscape scale. In this paper we develop a decision support system (DSS) for locating and sizing <b>water</b> <b>harvesting</b> ponds in a hydrological model, which enables assessments of <b>water</b> <b>harvesting</b> intensification on upstream–downstream ecosystem services in meso-scale watersheds. The DSS was used with the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) for a case-study area located in the Lake Tana basin, Ethiopia. We found that supplementary irrigation in combination with nutrient application increased simulated teff (Eragrostis tef, staple crop in Ethiopia) production up to three times, compared to the current practice. Moreover, after supplemental irrigation of teff, the excess water was used for dry season onion production of 7. 66 t/ha (median). <b>Water</b> <b>harvesting,</b> therefore, {{can play an important}} role in increasing local- to regional-scale food security through increased and more stable food production and generation of extra income from the sale of cash crops.
