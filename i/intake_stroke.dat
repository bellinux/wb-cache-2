Together with his employee Maybach they developed a compact, high-speed single-cylinder engine, patented on April 3, 1885 and called [...] "grandfather clock engine." [...] It had a float metered carburetor, used mushroom intake valves which were opened by the suction of the piston's <b>intake</b> <b>stroke,</b> and instead of an electrical ignition system, it used hot tube ignition, a platinum tube running into the combustion chamber, heated by an external open flame.

40|$|Background: Stroke {{is one of}} {{the most}} common causes of {{life-threatening}} disabilities and death around the world. Mortality rate is going to be doubled by 2030 in the Middle East countries. Prevention is a cost-effective approach to decrease risk of stroke. The present study assessed the relationship between dairy <b>intake</b> and <b>stroke</b> risk. Methods: This hospital-based case-control study was directed in a University hospital. The common food consumption of 129 men and women was assessed with food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). The relationship between fermented and non-fermented dairy <b>intake</b> and <b>stroke</b> were assessed between two patient groups. Results: Total of dairy intake were lower in patients with stroke than control group (13. 36 vs 19. 61 % in men and 11. 14 vs 15. 02 % in women). Similar relationships were observed betweenfermented and non-fermented dairy <b>intake</b> and <b>stroke</b> in both genders. Conclusions: Lower dairyconsumption can increase stroke risk in men and women...|$|R

50|$|Late {{intake valve}} closing (LIVC)The first {{variation}} of continuous {{variable valve timing}} involves holding the intake valve open slightly longer than a traditional engine. This results in the piston actually pushing {{air out of the}} cylinder and back into the intake manifold during the compression stroke. The air which is expelled fills the manifold with higher pressure, and on subsequent <b>intake</b> <b>strokes</b> the air which is taken in is at a higher pressure. Late intake valve closing has been shown to reduce pumping losses by 40% during partial load conditions, and to decrease nitric oxide (NOx) emissions by 24%. Peak engine torque showed only a 1% decline, and hydrocarbon emissions were unchanged.|$|R
50|$|Inertial {{supercharging}} {{effect is}} the result of incoming fuel/air charge developing momentum greater than <b>intake</b> <b>stroke</b> would generate alone. It is achieved by a combination of head/port configuration, and cam profile/valve timing.|$|E
50|$|As in HCSI, HCCI injects fuel {{during the}} <b>intake</b> <b>stroke.</b> However, {{rather than using}} an {{electric}} discharge (spark) to ignite {{a portion of the}} mixture, HCCI raises density and temperature by compression until the entire mixture reacts spontaneously.|$|E

5000|$|Full {{power mode}} {{is used for}} rapid {{acceleration}} and heavy loads (as when climbing a hill). The air-fuel mixture is homogeneous and the ratio is slightly richer than stoichiometric, which helps prevent pinging. The fuel is injected during the <b>intake</b> <b>stroke.</b>|$|E
50|$|The intake valves were {{operated}} by the suction caused by the <b>intake</b> <b>stroke,</b> while the exhaust valves were {{operated by}} an eccentric brass ring on the rear wheel and a device at the cylinder head that opened each cylinder's valve alternately.|$|E
50|$|During {{the exhaust}} stroke, {{scavenging}} occurred {{as the air}} moving past the cylinder exterior lowered the pressure inside due to the direct exposure of the exhaust port to the slipstream. The piston continued its exhaust stroke until top dead center (TDC) was reached, but the valve remained open. The piston began to move down on its <b>intake</b> <b>stroke</b> with the valve still open, pulling new air into the cylinder. It remained open until it was {{two-thirds of the way}} down, at which point the valve closed and the remainder of the <b>intake</b> <b>stroke</b> greatly reduced the air pressure. When the piston uncovered the transfer ports again, the low pressure in the cylinder drew in the balance of the charge.|$|E
40|$|Means for {{controlling}} the compression pressure in an {{internal combustion engine}} having one or more cylinders and subject to widely varying power output requirements are provided. Received between each crank pin and connecting rod is an eccentric sleeve selectively capable of rotation about the crank pin and/or inside the rod and for latching with the rod to vary the effective length of the connecting rod and thereby the clearance volume of the engine. The eccentric normally rotates inside the connecting rod during the exhaust and <b>intake</b> <b>strokes</b> but a latching pawl carried by the eccentric is movable radially outwardly to latch the rod and eccentric together during the compression and power strokes. A control valve responds to intake manifold pressure to time the supply of hydraulic fluid to move the latch-pawl outwardly, varying the effective rod length to maintain a substantially optimum firing chamber pressure at all intake manifold pressures...|$|R
50|$|In a {{conventional}} four-stroke engine, {{each of the}} <b>strokes</b> (<b>intake,</b> compression, power, exhaust) involves a nominal rotation of 180°, totaling 720° for the complete 4-stroke combustion cycle. A desaxe engine adds to {{the duration of the}} two downward <b>strokes</b> (<b>intake</b> and power), and subtracts the same amount from the two upward strokes (compression and exhaust), with the total remaining 720°. A typical desaxe engine will have strokes of 185° - 175° - 185° - 175°, etc., with the differential roughly (but not directly) proportional to the percentage of offset distance to stroke length.|$|R

5000|$|Stoichiometric mode is {{used for}} {{moderate}} load conditions. Fuel is injected during the <b>intake</b> <b>stroke,</b> creating a homogeneous fuel-air mixture in the cylinder.

50|$|A stroke is {{the action}} of a piston {{travelling}} {{the full length of}} its cylinder. In a two-stroke engine, one of the two strokes combines the <b>intake</b> <b>stroke</b> and the compression stroke, while the other stroke combines the combustion stroke and the exhaust stroke.|$|E
50|$|The first {{piston engines}} {{did not have}} compression, but ran on an air-fuel mixture sucked or blown in during {{the first part of}} the <b>intake</b> <b>stroke.</b> The most {{significant}} distinction between modern internal combustion engines and the early designs is the use of compression of the fuel charge prior to combustion.|$|E
5000|$|Pistons {{are made}} of forged {{aluminum}}. They have three rings and aluminum buttons retain the 1.156 x 3.300 in steel wrist pin. The piston is anodized and Teflon coated to prevent galling during the high thrust load operation encounterd. The top ring is an L-shaped section [...] "Dykes" [...] ring that provides a good seal during combustion but a second ring must be used to prevent excessive oil from entering the combustion chamber during <b>intake</b> <b>strokes</b> as the Dykes-style ring offers less than optimal reverse gas/oil sealing. The third ring is an oil scraper ring whose function is to scrape {{the majority of the}} oil film off of the cylinder wall as the piston descends, to prevent oil being exposed to combustion heat and contaminating the upcoming round of fuel/air. This [...] "oil scraping" [...] also provides a key heat removal step for the cylinder walls and piston skirts, the oil film is renewed as the piston moves upward after BDC.|$|R

Findings: Data were obtained from an already available population based case-control study where the cases were defined as incident first-time ischemic stroke patients. Complete data on all relevant variables were obtained for 2722 controls and 2469 cases. The data were analyzed with logistic regression analysis. Stroke risk decreased with fat fish intake ([greater than or equal to] 1 /week versus < 1 /month) in both men and women; adjusted pooled Odds Ratio (OR) 0. 69, 95 % Confidence Interval (CI) : 0. 54 - 0. 89. However, stroke risk for women increased with intake of lean fish; adjusted OR 1. 63 (95 % CI: 1. 17 - 2. 28), whereas there was no association with men’s lean fish intake; adjusted OR 0. 97 (95 % CI: 0. 73 - 1. 27). Fish intake was self-reported retrospectively, yielding uncertain exposure assessment and potential recall bias. The findings regarding lean fish would be explained by recall bias if an individual’s inclination to report lean fish consumption depended on both disease status and sex. The fact that the association between fat fish <b>intake</b> and <b>stroke</b> was similar in men and women does not support such a differential in recall.

50|$|The power {{produced}} by the Otto cycle is the energy developed per unit of time. The Otto engines are called four-stroke engines. The <b>intake</b> <b>stroke</b> and compression stroke require one rotation of the engine crankshaft. The power stroke and exhaust stroke require another rotation. For two rotations there is one work generating stroke.|$|E
50|$|In a {{two-stroke}} engine, such as {{that used}} on dirt bikes, a bulge in the exhaust pipe known as an expansion chamber uses {{the pressure of the}} exhaust to create a pump that squeezes more air and fuel into the cylinder during the <b>intake</b> <b>stroke.</b> This provides greater power and fuel efficiency. See Kadenacy effect.|$|E
50|$|The turbocharger's {{compressor}} draws {{in ambient}} air and compresses {{it before it}} enters into the intake manifold at increased pressure.

40|$|Following acute stroke, {{deterioration}} in nutritional status {{and weight loss}} is common; few studies have investigated this, perhaps due to difficulties with recruitment and completion of complex assessments with stroke patients. This study reports the feasibility of a study protocol to determine predictors of nutritional <b>intake</b> in <b>stroke</b> patients. The aim {{of the study was}} to test the feasibility of a protocol to measure taste and smell function, and explore links with dietary <b>intake</b> following <b>stroke.</b> Patients were recruited from one Acute Stroke Unit in 2007 / 8. Data were collected at three time-points and entailed standardised validated assessments of taste and smell function, diet, appetite and mood state. Recruitment of this vulnerable population to a demanding assessment schedule was challenging. Of a cohort of 166 admissions, six were recruited and complete data collected from four participants. Slow recruitment was largely due to exacting inclusion criteria and rapid hospital discharge. Those who completed all assessments reported the schedule as tolerable and acceptable. This study illustrated the difficulties of recruiting this vulnerable population. Identification of reasons for slow recruitment facilitated development of measures to address them. It was possible to format a complex and lengthy assessment schedule to be acceptable to vulnerable participants...|$|R
25|$|In 1876, Otto {{developed}} a gaseous fuel, compressed charge four-stroke cycle, (also {{known as the}} Otto Cycle) engine after 14 years of effort, a system characterized by four piston <b>strokes</b> (<b>intake,</b> compression, power, and exhaust).

50|$|Internal-combustion {{engines are}} {{feedback}} systems, which, once started, {{rely on the}} inertia from each cycle to initiate the next cycle. In a four-stroke engine, the third stroke releases energy from the fuel, powering the fourth (exhaust) stroke and also the first two (<b>intake,</b> compression) <b>strokes</b> of the next cycle, as well as powering the engine's external load. To start the first cycle {{at the beginning of}} any particular session, the first two strokes must be powered in some other way than from the engine itself. The starter motor is used for this purpose and is not required once the engine starts running and its feedback loop becomes self-sustaining.|$|R
50|$|Conventionally, a {{four-stroke}} (petrol or gasoline) Otto {{cycle engine}} {{is fueled by}} drawing a mixture of air and fuel into the combustion chamber during the <b>intake</b> <b>stroke.</b> This produces a homogeneous charge: a homogeneous mixture of air and fuel, which is ignited by a spark plug at a predetermined moment {{near the top of}} the compression stroke.|$|E
50|$|The Atkinson {{cycle engine}} {{was one of}} the first {{attempts}} at variable compression.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} the development of a compu-tationally ecient CFD-based tool for nding optimal engine operating conditions with respect to fuel consumption and emissions. The optimization algorithm employed is based on the steepest descent method where an adaptive cost function is minimized along each line search using an eective back-tracking strategy. The adaptive cost function is based on the penalty method, where the penalty coecient is increased af-ter every line search. The parameter space is normalized and, thus, the optimization occurs over the unit cube in higher-dimensional space. The application of this optimization tool is demonstrated for the Sulzer S 20, a central-injection, non-road DI diesel en-gine. The optimization parameters are the start of injection of the two pulses, the duration of each pulse, the duration of the dwell, the exhaust gas recirculation rate and the boost pressure. A zero-dimensional engine code is used to simulate the exhaust and <b>intake</b> <b>strokes</b> to predict the conditions at the closure of the inlet valves. These data are then used as initial values for the three-dimensional CFD simulation which, in turn, computes the the emissions and specic fuel consump-tion. Simulations were performed for two dierent cost functions with dierent emphasis on the fuel consumption. The best case showed that the nitric oxide and the particulates could be reduced by over 83 % and almost 24 %, respectively, below the EPA mandates while maintaining a reasonable value of speci c fuel consumption. Moreover, the path taken by the algorithm from the starting point to the optimum has been investigated to understand the in uence of each parameter on the process of optimization...|$|R
