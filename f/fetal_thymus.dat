40|$|<b>Fetal</b> {{liver and}} <b>thymus</b> {{transplantation}} can be successfully em-ployed {{for the treatment}} of severe combined immunodeficiency disease. In virtually all cases, donor and recipient cells are HLA mismatched. In a patient suffering from a severe combined im-munodeficiency disease, full immunological reconstitution was obtained after <b>fetal</b> liver and <b>thymus</b> transplantation. HLA typing revealed that the patient's T cells were of donor origin, while the B cells and monocytes were of host origin. Despite this com-plete HLA mismatch, the patient was found to mount a subnor-mal to normal antibody response in vivo. This finding is in con-trast with the concept that antigen recognition by T cells is major histocompatibility complex (MHC) restricted. To define the mechanism responsible for this in vivo antibody response, an-tibody production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells from the patient was tested in vitro after in vivo booster.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} whether there is a relationship between the sonographic <b>fetal</b> <b>thymus</b> size and the presence of an intrauterine infection in patients with preterm labor. STUDY DESIGN: Thirty-one women who had been admitted with preterm labor and intact membranes between 24 and 32 weeks of gestation were included. <b>Fetal</b> <b>thymus</b> perimeter was measured sonographically, and amniocentesis for the microbiologic assessment of the amniotic cavity was performed. Placentas and umbilical cords were examined for the presence of chorioamnionitis/funisitis. RESULTS: The prevalence of preterm delivery and intra-amniotic infection was 51. 6 % (16 / 31 women) and 32. 3 % (10 / 31 women), respectively. In all cases with intrauterine infection and in 23. 8 % of cases without intrauterine infection, the <b>fetal</b> <b>thymus</b> perimeter was below the 5 th percentile for gestational age (10 / 10 women vs 5 / 21 women; P <. 01).

40|$|We {{performed}} a comprehensive analysis of T cell receptor (TCR) γ rearrangements in T cell precursors {{of the mouse}} adult thymus. Using a sensitive quantitative PCR method, we show that TCRγ rearrangements are present in CD 44 +CD 25 + Pro-T thymocytes much earlier than expected. TCRγ rearrangements increase significantly from the Pro-T to the CD 44 −CD 25 + Pre-T cell transition, and follow different patterns depending on each Vγ gene segment, suggesting that ordered waves of TCRγ rearrangement exist in the adult mouse thymus as has been described in the <b>fetal</b> mouse <b>thymus.</b> Recombinations of TCRγ genes occur concurrently with TCRδ and D-Jβ rearrangements, but before Vβ gene assembly. Productive TCRγ rearrangements do not increase significantly before the Pre-T cell stage and are depleted in CD 4 +CD 8 + double-positive cells from normal mice. In contrast, double-positive thymocytes from TCRδ−/− mice display random proportions of TCRγ rearranged alleles, supporting a role for functional TCRγ/δ rearrangements in the γδ divergence process...|$|R

40|$|Most fetal thymocytes from 14 -d mouse embryos are Thy- 1 +, L 3 T 4 -, Ly- 2 -, {{and express}} the {{receptor}} for interleukin 2 (IL- 2).

When <b>fetal</b> <b>thymus</b> from 14 -d embryos were cultured for a 6 -d period, thymocytes increased in number 20 - 40 -fold, and 95 % became Thy- 1 +, L 3 T 4 +, Ly- 2 +.

40|$|T-cell {{development}} {{depends upon}} interactions between thymocytes and thymic epithelial cells (TECs). The engagement of delta-like 4 (DL 4) on TECs by Notch 1 expressed by blood-borne BM-derived precursors {{is essential for}} T-cell commitment in the adult thymus. In contrast to the adult, the earliest T-cell progenitors in the embryo originate in the fetal liver and migrate to the nonvascularized <b>fetal</b> <b>thymus</b> via chemokine signals.

Despite these fundamental differences between fetal and adult T-cell lymphopoiesis, we show here that DL 4 -mediated Notch signaling {{is essential for the}} development of both αβ and γδ T-cell lineages in the embryo. Deletion of the DL 4 gene in fetal TECs results in an early block in αβ T-cell development and a dramatic reduction of all γδ T-cell subsets in the <b>fetal</b> <b>thymus.</b> In contrast to the adult, no dramatic deviation of T-cell precursors to alternative fates was observed in the <b>fetal</b> <b>thymus</b> in the absence of Notch signaling.

40|$|A direct {{quantitative}} and phenotypic cytofluorographic analysis of TCR- gamma/delta+ lymphocytes {{as well as}} an immunohistologic study of their tissue distribution and microanatomy was made possible by the availability of two mAbs (anti-TCR-delta 1 and anti-C gamma M 1) specific for framework determinants on human TCR gamma and delta chains, respectively. TCR-gamma/delta+ lymphocytes, ranging between greater than 0. 5 and 16 % of CD 3 + cells, were found in <b>fetal</b> and postnatal <b>thymus,</b> <b>fetal</b> and adult peripheral lymphoid organs, and adult peripheral blood. While TCR-gamma/delta+ lymphocytes comprised a small subpopulation of T cells (mean, approximately 4 %) occasionally greater than 10 - 16 % of CD 3 + cells expressed TCR-gamma/delta. Virtually all TCR- gamma/delta+ thymocytes/lymphocytes expressed CD 7, CD 2, and CD 5 but were heterogeneous with respect to their expression of CD 1, CD 4, CD 8, CD 28, CD 11 b, CD 16, and Leu- 7. Human TCR-gamma/delta+ cells populate both organized lymphoid tissues (thymus, tonsil, lymphnode, and spleen) as well as the gut- and skin-associated lymphoid systems at similar frequencies without obvious tropism for epithelial microenvironments. TCR-gamma/delta+ lymphocytes tend to be located within a given organ wherever TCR-alpha/beta+ lymphocytes are found. This study shows that TCR-gamma/delta+ lymphocytes constitute a small but numerically important, phenotypically diverse T cell population distributed throughout the body.

40|$|Rationale: Chorioamnionitis is {{associated}} with preterm delivery and involution of the <b>fetal</b> <b>thymus.</b> Women at risk of preterm delivery receive antenatal corticosteroids which accelerate fetal lung maturation and improve neonatal outcome. However, the effects of antenatal corticosteroids on the <b>fetal</b> <b>thymus</b> in the settings of chorioamnionitis are largely unknown. We hypothesized that intra-amniotic exposure to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) causes involution of the <b>fetal</b> <b>thymus</b> resulting in persistent effects on thymic structure and cell populations. We also hypothesized that antenatal corticosteroids may modulate the effects of LPS on thymic development. Methods: Time-mated ewes with singleton fetuses received an intra-amniotic injection of LPS 7 or 14 days before preterm delivery at 120 days gestational age (term = 150 days). LPS and corticosteroid treatment groups received intra-amniotic LPS either preceding or following maternal intra-muscular betamethasone. Gestation matched controls received intra-amniotic and maternal intra-muscular saline. The fetal intra-thoracic thymus was evaluated. Results: Intra-amniotic LPS decreased the cortico-medullary (C/M) ratio of the thymus and increased Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 mRNA and CD 3 expression indicating involution and activation of the <b>fetal</b> <b>thymus.</b> Increased TLR 4 and CD 3 expression persisted for 14 days but Foxp 3 expression decreased suggesting a change in regulatory T-cells.

Undenatured auxiliary protein was immunoprecipitated by the human autoantibody, but not by the monoclonal antibodies, which were raised to SDS-denatured PCNA, nor by the anti-N-terminal peptide antibody, suggesting that the epitopes recognized by both the monoclonal antibodies and the anti-peptide antibody are not exposed in the native protein. The human anti-PCNA autoantibody neutralized {{the activity of the}} auxiliary protein for DNA polymerase delta, but did not inhibit the activity of pol delta itself. The ability of pol delta to utilize template/primers containing long stretches of single-stranded template was inhibited by the anti-PCNA autoantibody, whereas the activity of pol alpha on such templates was not affected, confirming the specificity of the auxiliary protein for pol delta.
