5|$|Counsel for the {{petitioner}} {{discussed at}} great length from a sociological point of view, of the age-old problem of the gambling instinct in the human being. According to his analysis, gambling pervades our entire economic system; thus insurance contracts are a gamble, stock and grain <b>exchange</b> <b>transactions</b> are gambles, and the farmer's dependence on weather is a gamble. Counsel's attempt to apply this analysis to the present case left us cold and unimpressed. He even reminded us that our great idol, Mr. Chief Justice John Marshall, in his day attended the horse races and wagered with his clergyman. In fact, they ran a book. As indicating how times have changed and how even our coarse nature has yielded to the protecting care of governmental policy, we confess we do not even know a bookmaker, clerical or otherwise, and our passes to the beautiful race tracks around Chicago lie in our desk unused.|$|E

This is the first empirical study to focus on the limitations when modelling foreign <b>exchange</b> rate <b>transaction</b> exposure in emerging insurance markets. This work is based on the cash flow methodology proposed by Martin and Mauer (2003, 2005) in reference to banks, and employed by Li et al. (2009) when assessing US insurance companies. Some econometric methodological innovations have been introduced to study the limitations of modelling foreign <b>exchange</b> rate <b>transaction</b> exposure in emerging insurance markets. An extensive literature review is followed by a quantitative investigation, to answer the following research questions. 1) Is the foreign <b>exchange</b> <b>transaction</b> exposure, as measured by a fundamental (economic) method of modelling the interplay of foreign exchange rates with other economic variables, significant, for all Egyptian insurance companies? 2) Is the foreign <b>exchange</b> <b>transaction</b> exposure, as measured by a technical (statistical) way of modelling the interplay of foreign exchange rates with other economic variables, significant for all Egyptian insurance companies? 3) Is the <b>exchange</b> <b>transaction</b> exposure for the Egyptian insurance industry, as a whole, significant? Although the foreign <b>exchange</b> rate <b>transaction</b> exposure for the Egyptian insurance industry, as a whole, is insignificant (question 3), the percentage of Egyptian insurers affected by foreign <b>exchange</b> rate <b>transaction</b> exposure in US dollars, estimated at the individual firm level, was found to be 22...|$|R

Foreign exchange allocations to banks, ministries, and enterprises were all approved by the State Administration of Exchange Control. The Bank of China, the foreign exchange arm of the People's Bank of China, lost its monopoly on all foreign <b>exchange</b> <b>transactions</b> in 1984 when the Agricultural Bank, People's Construction Bank, China Industrial and Commercial Bank, and China International Trust and Investment Corporation (CITIC) were permitted to deal in foreign currency. The Bank of China remained China's principal foreign exchange bank and provided loans for production and commercial transactions related to exports, set up branches overseas, maintained correspondent relations with foreign banks, and did research on international monetary trends. The Bank of China also was active in international financial markets through such activities as loan syndication and issuing of foreign bonds. CITIC, formed in 1979 to facilitate foreign investment in China, also borrowed and lent internationally and issued foreign bonds in addition to encouraging and participating in joint ventures, importing foreign technology and equipment, and making overseas investments. In 1986 CITIC was renamed CITIC Group and shifted its emphasis to power, metallurgical, and raw materials industries, which had trouble attracting investments. In late 1986 the CITIC Group had set up 47 joint ventures, invested in 114 domestic companies, and issued US$550 million in foreign bonds. The China Investment Bank was established in 1981 as a channel for medium- and long-term loans from international financial {{institutions such as the}} World Bank.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to develop deeper {{understanding}} of the informal contributions of employees to organisational success; more specifically, the exchange ‘mechanism’ by which resources accrue to organisations through the social relationships of their members. The second purpose is to explore the influence of organisational contextual factors on this exchange mechanism; more specifically, the influence – if any – of contingent employment practices. Through the use of a qualitative research design, I have gained an in-depth understanding of the cognitive mechanism employed by organisational actors to arrive at a decision on whether or not to initiate social exchange, in order to facilitate the flow of organisational social capital. Data was analysed using Dimensional Analysis method. This analysis draws on the theoretical perspectives of interpretivism and symbolic interactionism, both of which are underpinned by a social construction epistemology. This provides the necessary link for understanding the connections between macro- and micro-level social action of social exchange in organisational settings. My findings identify a complex cognitive process employed by actors for the purpose of reaching a decision with respect to initiating social exchange in organisational settings. This process is termed Social <b>Exchange</b> <b>Transaction</b> Analysis. It is undertaken at the individual level and ultimately controls the flow of organisational social capital through a social network to the organisation. This complexity is a reflection of both the many dimensions of the phenomenon, and the interconnectedness and interactions between them. Social <b>Exchange</b> <b>Transaction</b> Analysis builds an ‘analytical’ picture of the potential social <b>exchange</b> <b>transaction,</b> to enable the organisational actor to arrive at a decision on whether or not to initiate social exchange – and thereby facilitate the flow of organisational social capital...|$|R
