5|$|In general, {{the show}} {{began to take}} on a more serious tone as a seriocomic (or dramedy) series, in which the focus was on the {{character}} rather than the character type, and moved away from <b>its</b> <b>status</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> situation comedy.|$|E

In 1825 San Giacomo lost <b>its</b> <b>status</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> parish. In 1927 a fire damaged several works of art, and in 1929 it {{was assigned to}} the Sons of Divine Providence.|$|E
5|$|Kõpu Lighthouse only {{lost its}} {{important}} {{role as a}} primary navigation aid in 1997, when a radar lighthouse took over its duties. Recreational craft and small fishing vessels continue to rely on Kõpu for navigating, as a backup to electronic navigation systems. The Estonian Maritime Administration still classifies it as an active aid to navigation. Its future is ensured by <b>its</b> <b>status</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> protected cultural memorial.|$|E

5|$|Nigeria has {{remained}} {{a key player in}} the international oil industry since the 1970s, and maintains membership in Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), which it joined in July 1971. <b>Its</b> <b>status</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> major petroleum producer figures prominently in its sometimes volatile international relations with both developed countries, notably the United States, and the developing countries of China, Jamaica, and Ghana and Kenya in Africa.|$|E
5|$|Rùm is an {{important}} study site for research in ecology and numerous academic papers have been produced based on work undertaken on the island. In addition to <b>its</b> <b>status</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> National Nature Reserve, Rùm was designated a Biosphere Reserve from 1976 to 2002, a Site of Special Scientific Interest in 1987, and has seventeen sites scheduled as nationally important ancient monuments.|$|E
5|$|Thanks to <b>its</b> <b>status</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{first-class}} fortification, Fort Stanton {{continued to}} receive regular maintenance and was continually garrisoned {{even after the}} final armistice. Work was even done to strengthen the defenses, as a stockade was added {{in the summer of}} 1865, and the parapets of the fort were re-sodded with fresh grass for better traction and to improve the look of the fortification.|$|E

5|$|The Algonquin Round Table, {{as well as}} {{the number}} of other {{literary}} and theatrical greats who lodged there, helped earn the hotel <b>its</b> <b>status</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> New York City Historic Landmark. The hotel was so designated in 1987. In 1996 the hotel was designated a National Literary Landmark by the Friends of Libraries USA.

5|$|Theodoxus fluviatilis littoralis (Linnaeus, 1789)– was {{described}} from brackish water by Linnaeus {{as a separate}} species, originally named Nerita littoralis. A study by Zettler (2008) proved that <b>its</b> <b>status</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> subspecies is unjustified, being regarded as a synonym of Theodoxus fluviatilis. Although these so-called forms (form fluviatilis and form littoralis) differ in morphology, ecology, reproductive strategy and behaviour, they are probably just ecomorphs.|$|E
5|$|A royal {{charter of}} 1215 gave Wellington <b>its</b> <b>status</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> town, {{and during the}} medieval period it grew as a centre for trade on the road from Bristol to Exeter, being laid out, with the church at {{the east end of}} town, in a similar manner to other towns of this era. In 1548, the manor was sold to Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset, but reverted to the control of the bishops after his execution. By the end of the 16th century it had come under the {{protection}} of John Popham (judge) and his descendants who built a manor house which was destroyed during the English Civil War.|$|E

5|$|Further west, {{the city}} of Chicago became the other major site in the {{development}} of early skyscrapers. In contrast to New York, Chicago emerged as a major metropolis only in the mid-19th century, growing from a village of around fifty inhabitants in 1830, to a city of 30,000 in 1850 and nearly 300,000 by 1870. Chicago became the railroad hub for the American West and the primary trading city for the emerging territories, famous for its commercial culture. It saw itself as different from the cities on the east coast and was immensely proud of <b>its</b> <b>status</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> growing, vibrant center.|$|E
5|$|Historically in Lancashire, Salford's {{early history}} {{is marked by}} <b>its</b> <b>status</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Royal caput and the {{judicial}} seat of the ancient hundred of Salfordshire, to which it lent its name. It was granted a charter by Ranulf de Blondeville, 6th Earl of Chester, in about 1230, making Salford a free borough. During {{the early stages of}} its growth, Salford was of greater cultural and commercial importance than its neighbour Manchester, although most contemporary sources agree that since the Industrial Revolution of the late 18th and early 19th centuries that position has been reversed.|$|E
5|$|Historically part of Lancashire, Chadderton's {{early history}} {{is marked by}} <b>its</b> <b>status</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> manorial township, with its own line of lords and overlords, who {{included}} the Asshetons, Chethams, Radclyffes and Traffords. Chadderton in the Middle Ages was chiefly distinguished by its two mansions, Foxdenton Hall and Chadderton Hall, and by the prestigious families who occupied them. Farming was the main industry of the area, with locals supplementing their incomes by hand-loom woollen weaving in the domestic system.|$|E

5|$|In February 2011 the Smithsonian Institution {{announced}} it would be holding an exhibit dedicated {{to the art of}} video games. Several games were chosen initially and the public could vote for which games they felt deserved to be displayed via a poll on the exhibit's website. BioShock was considered a front runner to be displayed because of <b>its</b> <b>status</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> game that demonstrated how artistic the medium can be.|$|E
5|$|Moreover, the Council's secrecy {{has been}} criticized as {{contrary}} to <b>its</b> <b>status</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> symbol of racial harmony in Singapore. The discharge of such a role requires that the PCMR projects an image of effectiveness, which the current requirement of secrecy arguably impedes. Secret discussions also prevent the public from being informed about controversial issues that may have arisen {{in the course of}} implementing new laws, especially those which may affect the rights of minorities.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} staff in the kitchen has {{increased}} from four when it first opened to 42, resulting in a ratio of one kitchen staff member per customer. The restaurant gained its first Michelin star in 1999, its second in 2002 and its third in 2004, making it the fastest in the United Kingdom to earn three Michelin stars. It lost <b>its</b> <b>status</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> three-starred restaurant in the 2016 guide due to renovation preventing it from being open for assessment. The restaurant regained three stars in the following year's Michelin guide.|$|E
50|$|To {{emphasize}} its {{affiliation with}} Rush University and <b>its</b> <b>status</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> academic medical center, Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center was renamed Rush University Medical Center in 2003.|$|R
