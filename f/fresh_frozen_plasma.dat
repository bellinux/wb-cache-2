It {{is recommended that}} the effects of warfarin typically be monitored by checking prothrombin time (INR) every one to four weeks. Many other medications and dietary factors can interact with warfarin, either increasing or decreasing its effectiveness. The effects of warfarin may be reversed with phytonadione (vitamin K1), <b>fresh</b> <b>frozen</b> <b>plasma,</b> or prothrombin complex concentrate.|$|E
5|$|Narrowed {{areas may}} be bridged by a stent, a hollow tube {{that keeps the}} duct open. Removable plastic stents are used in {{uncomplicated}} gallstone disease, while permanent self-expanding metal stents with a longer lifespan are used if the obstruction is due to pressure from a tumor such as pancreatic cancer. A nasobiliary drain may be left behind; this is a plastic tube that passes from the bile duct through the stomach and the nose and allows continuous drainage of bile into a receptible. It {{is similar to a}} nasogastric tube, but passes into the common bile duct directly, and allows for serial x-ray cholangiograms to be done to identify the improvement of the obstruction. The decision on which of the aforementioned treatments to apply is generally based on the severity of the obstruction, findings on other imaging studies, and whether the patient has improved with antibiotic treatment. Certain treatments may be unsafe if blood clotting is impaired, as the risk of bleeding (especially from sphincterotomy) is increased in the use of medication such as clopidogrel (which inhibits platelet aggregation) or if the prothrombin time is significantly prolonged. For a prolonged prothrombin time, vitamin K or <b>fresh</b> <b>frozen</b> <b>plasma</b> may be administered to reduce bleeding risk.|$|E

40|$|Five {{patients}} with acute fulminant hepatic necrosis with coma {{were subjected to}} vigorous, massive, and prolonged plasmapheresis with plasma exchange {{on the theory that}} removal of the patient's plasma would eliminate or reduce circulating noxious protein-bound factors responsible for coma and that replacement of the patient's <b>plasma</b> with <b>fresh</b> <b>frozen</b> human <b>plasma</b> would support the patient through the critical period required for hepatocyte regeneration. One of the five patients emerged from stage IV coma on day 6 and another on day 8 of vigorous plasmapheresis and appeared to be recovering until severe and relentless bronchopneumonia led to their deaths. The technique can be conducted in humans without undue risk and is more practicable and more in keeping with the pathology of hepatic necrosis than pig liver bypass, human cadaver liver bypass, or cross-circulation with humans, baboons, or chimpanzees. Diseases desperate grown by desperate appliances are relieved or not at all. (Hamlet, TV: 3) ACUTE DIFFUSE hepatic necrosis (acute yellow at-rophy) with coma is a lethal disease that seldom re-sponds to conventional treatment.

40|$|Neisseria meningitidis is a Gram {{negative}} bacterium that commonly colonizes the nasopharyngeal mucosa of 10 % of {{the population}} at any given time.

I hypothesize that any surface exposed gene products that are expressed at a higher level in the bloodstream than on the mucosal surface, where immune selection pressure drives antigenic diversity, should be less variable, and so, attractive as cross-protective vaccine candidates. In my thesis research I explored experimental methods for modelling meningococcal bacteraemia ex vivo. I characterised the transcriptional response of a serogroup B strain of N. meningitidis during prolonged incubation (up to 4 hours) in <b>fresh</b> <b>frozen</b> non-bactericidal <b>plasma</b> from two individuals. Subsequently the meningococcal transcriptome was examined during incubation in fresh, anticoagulated non-bactericidal whole human blood for different periods up to 4 hours, using microarrays and realtime PCR technology. The cellular localisation of proteins encoded by genes confirmed to be significantly differentially expressed in plasma and/or blood, both by microarray technology and by real-time PCR, was explored using bioinformatic resources, and those predicted (or established) to be surface-exposed were brought forward for further evaluation. Amongst these, I selected genes up-regulated in bacteria incubated in plasma and/or blood, but down-regulated (according to data previously obtained) for organisms isolated from an experimental system modelling the nasopharyngeal carriage state, for examination of sequence diversity.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{pyometra}} syndrome with endotoxemia and/or sepsis in bitches may impair different organ systems and functions including haemostasis, which may considerably influence the outcome if overlooked or underestimated. The present clinical study was carried out on thirty-seven clinical patients admitted to the Clinic for Small Animal Medicine and Surgery at the Veterinary Faculty in Ljubljana, Slovenia. Preoperative diagnosis was based on clinical signs, haematology results and ultrasonographic examination. Ovariohysterectomy was performed as final treatment. The study is aimed at the effects of pyometra syndrome on haemostatic functions {{as well as at the}} comparison between haemostatic functions and haematology and biochemistry results. Acute phase reaction with leucocytosis, neutrophilia, lymphopenia, hypoalbuminemia and hyperfibrinogenemia was identified preoperatively and up to 24 hours postoperatively. Changes in the haemostatic profile - prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time, shortened thrombin time, increased concentration of D-dimeres and thrombocytopenia - which were confirmed in the study, suggest the development of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), most likely due to influence of E. coli endotoxin. The changes of haemostatic profile and concurrent acute phase reaction suggest the connection between inflammation and coagulopathy. Attention and early recognition of haemostatic function impairment should be addressed in pyometra syndrome patient in order to be able to timely substitute coagulation and anticoagulation factors with fresh blood, <b>fresh</b> or freshly <b>frozen</b> <b>plasma</b> or added heparin when appropriate...|$|R

40|$|Backgrounds and Objectives <b>Fresh</b> <b>frozen</b> human <b>plasma</b> is an {{important}} raw material {{in the production of}} coagulation factor concentrates used in patients with haemorrhagic disorders. The aim {{of the study was to}} determine how the handling of plasma influences the recovery of coagulation factor VIII activity (FVIII:C), i. e. the influence of time between donation and freezing, of the freezing time and of the ice front velocity. We also studied a tentative eutectic point in human plasma. Materials and Methods Aliquots of plasma from 12 different donors were kept at room temperature for 2, 4 and 6 h before start of freezing. We achieved fast freezing with a freezer that blows cooled air at a high velocity on the plasma containers. Freezing times were 0. 5, 1, 4 and 24 h. Temperature was registered continuously during freezing. Plasma and NaCl solutions were frozen slowly to investigate the eutectic point. Results Storage at room temperature for 6 h caused a small but statistically significant decrease in FVIII:C. Slow freezing with programmed freezing times of 4 and 24 h caused a more pronounced drop in FVIII:C as compared to that of 30 and 60 min. We found no eutectic point in plasma or in plasma with addition of 2 % (w/v) NaCl. Conclusion For an optimal yield of FVIII, freezing should start within 4 h after plasma donation. We propose the use of the term 'ice front velocity' instead of 'freezing speed', taking into consideration that the volume and shape of plasma containers may differ. We found only a marginal loss of FVIII:C when the ice front velocity was 26 mm/h or faster, but a significant loss when it was 9 mm/h or slower. We recommend freezing times of 60 min or shorter. We were not able to demonstrate any eutectic point in human plasma. We therefore recommend that the term eutectic point should not be used as a reference temperature in guidelines on plasma handling...|$|R

40|$|We have {{examined}} the multimeric composition of factor VIII/von Willebrand factor in plasma and platelet lysates by means of sodium dodecyl sulfate agarose electrophoresis followed by staining with 125 I-labeled affinity-purified antibody. In normal plasma and platelet lysates, factor VIII/von Willebrand factor displayed 10 distinct multimers that ranged in apparent molecular weight from 0. 86 to 9. 9 × 106. The molecular weight difference between adjacent bands was 0. 8 − 1. 1 × 106. Larger material, not resolved into discrete bands, was also present with an average Mr of 14. 5 × 106. Though the dimer (apparent Mr = 0. 48 × 106) and the monomer (apparent Mr = 0. 28 × 106) {{generated by reduction of}} disulfide bonds were readily identified in this system, they were not detected in normal plasma or platelets. No differences were observed between fresh plasma prepared without anticoagulant and <b>fresh</b> or <b>frozen</b> <b>plasma</b> anticoagulated with either citrate or heparin. “Variant” (type II) von Willebrand's disease could be divided into two subtypes. In subtype IIA, factor VIII/von Willebrand factor in plasma consisted predominantly of the five smaller multimers with traces of the sixth and seventh (Mr up to 4. 5 × 106). In subtype IIB, all these multimers were easily detected and, in addition, bands of intermediate size (Mr = 8. 5 × 106 and smaller) were present. In contrast, the multimeric composition of IIB platelet factor VIII/von Willebrand factor was identical to normal, whereas in subtype IIA the larger multimers were absent from platelets as well as from plasma. In subtype IIB, binding of factor VIII/von Willebrand factor to platelets occurred at lower concentrations of ristocetin than required for normal and multimers of smaller size than in normal bound. On the contrary, in subtype IIA, binding was minimal, as was true of normal factor VIII/von Willebrand factor of equivalent size. Thus, physical as well as functional differences in the two subtypes of variant von Willebrand's disease described suggest that different pathogenetic mechanisms underlie the factor VIII/von Willebrand factor abnormalities in these patients...|$|R
