5|$|An 11-year {{sunspot cycle}} is {{half of a}} 22-year Babcock–Leighton dynamo cycle, which {{corresponds}} to an oscillatory exchange of energy between toroidal and poloidal solar magnetic fields. At solar-cycle maximum, the external poloidal dipolar magnetic field <b>is</b> <b>near</b> its dynamo-cycle minimum strength, but an internal toroidal quadrupolar field, generated through differential rotation within the tachocline, <b>is</b> <b>near</b> its maximum strength. At {{this point in the}} dynamo cycle, buoyant upwelling within the convective zone forces emergence of toroidal magnetic field through the photosphere, giving rise to pairs of sunspots, roughly aligned east–west and having footprints with opposite magnetic polarities. The magnetic polarity of sunspot pairs alternates every solar cycle, a phenomenon known as the Hale cycle.|$|E

5|$|Because {{the orbit}} of the Moon is {{inclined}} only about 5.145° to the ecliptic and the Sun is always very near the ecliptic, eclipses always occur on or near it.
