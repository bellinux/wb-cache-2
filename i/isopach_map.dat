40|$|The Corinth Rift, Greece, is a {{young and}} active {{continental}} rift stretching over 150 km between the cities of Patras and Athens, and is partly covered by the sea forming the Gulf of Corinth. The present study {{is focused on the}} western tip of the Gulf, west of the town of Aigion, where the extension rate measured by GPS is the highest, reaching 14 - 16 mm/yr. The sediments were investigated using seismic reflection profiling (600 km) to characterize the evolution over the last 120 ka of the sedimentation, subsidence and faulting activity. We combined two lines of evidence, the position of lowstand deltas and <b>isopach</b> <b>maps.</b> The <b>isopach</b> <b>maps</b> were built using two stratigraphic markers could be traced through the seismic grid, the most recent one corresponds to the last post-glacial transgression and the antecedent one to MIS 6 / MIS 5 transgression, at ca. 130 ka. The related <b>isopach</b> <b>maps</b> evidence a spatial change in sedimentary infill along the rift axis probably related to a decrease in activity of the south-dipping faults (i. e. Trizonia/Mornos Faults) that formed the northern edge of the westernmost Corinth Rift in an early stage of the rifting. The different identified lowstand fluvio-deltaic deposits are related to global sea-level lowstands during which the Gulf of Corinth was a lake, whose last reconnection to the Sea occurred around 11. 5 ka. Concerning lowstand deltas formed around 11. 5 ka, the subsidence rates exceed 3 mm/yr and are maximal under the apex of the Mornos fan-delta (5. 0 - 6. 6 mm/yr) and in the hanging wall of the north-dipping Lambiri fault (5. 9 - 7. 5 mm/yr). Regarding the anterior lowstand delta, the subsidence was lower ranging from 1 to 2. 7 mm/yr.

40|$|In June 2009, a 2. 2 {{square mile}} 3 -D high {{resolution}} seismic reflection survey {{was shot in}} southeastern Illinois in the Phillipstown Consolidated oilfield. A well was drilled in the 3 -D survey area to tie the seismic to the geological data with a synthetic seismogram from the sonic log. The objectives of the 3 -D seismic survey were three-fold: 1.) To image and interpret faulting of the Herald-Phillipstown Fault using drillhole-based geological and seismic cross-sections and structural contour maps created from the drillhole data and seismic reflection data, 2.) To test the effectiveness of imaging the faults by selected seismic attributes, and 3.) To compare spectral decomposition amplitude maps with an isochron map and an <b>isopach</b> <b>map</b> of a selected geologic interval (VTG interval). Drillhole and seismic reflection data show that various formation offsets increase near the main Herald-Phillipstown fault, and that the fault and its large offset subsidiary faults penetrate the Precambrian crystalline basement. A broad, northeast-trending 10, 000 feet wide graben is consistently observed in the drillhole data. Both shallow and deep formations in the geological cross-sections reveal small horst and graben features within the broad graben created possibly in response to fault reactivations. The HPF faults have been interpreted as originally Precambrian age high-angle, normal faults reactivated with various amounts and types of offset. Evidence for strike-slip movement is also clear on several faults. Changes in the seismic attribute values in the selected interval and along various time slices throughout the whole dataset correlate with the Herald-Phillipstown faults. Overall, seismic attributes could provide a means of mapping large offset faults in areas with limited or absent drillhole data. Results of the spectral decomposition suggest that if the interval velocity is known for a particular formation or interval, high-resolution 3 -D seismic reflection surveys could utilize these amplitudes as an alternative seismic interpretation method for estimating formation thicknesses. A VTG <b>isopach</b> <b>map</b> was compared with an isochron map and a spectral decomposition amplitude map. The results reveal that the isochron map strongly correlates with the <b>isopach</b> <b>map</b> {{as well as the}} spectral decomposition map. It was also found that thicker areas in the isopach correlated with higher amplitude values in the spectral decomposition amplitude map. Offsets along the faults appear sharper in these amplitudes and isochron maps than in the <b>isopach</b> <b>map,</b> possibly as a result of increased spatial sampling...|$|E
40|$|The eastern Mediterranean is a tectonically complex region {{evolving}} in {{the long}} term located {{in the midst of the}} progressive Afro-Eurasian collision. Despite years of investigation, its geological-geophysical structure is not completely known. At the same time, the recent discovery of large gas deposits has attracted the attention of many researchers to this region. For instance, the latest U. S. Geological Survey estimates using conventional assessment methodology suggest that there are on the order of 1. 7 billion barrels of recoverable oil and more than 4 trillion m 3 of recoverable gas in the Levant Basin [1]. This highlights the need for analysis of the paleogeographical conditions that can yield deep paleotectonic criteria for oil and gas discovery in this region. For this purpose, <b>isopach</b> <b>maps</b> of the Middle-Upper Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous were generated from detailed examinations of numerous well sections and the most significant outcroppings in the eastern Mediterranean. The maps confirm an earlier model of continental accretion [2]. In particular, abrupt changes in the trend and thickness of the Early Mesozoic formations coincide with the terrane boundaries. These compiled <b>isopach</b> <b>maps</b> also pinpoint significant distinctions between the Arabian and Sinai plates on the one hand and the Syrian arc on the other. A new tectonic map of the eastern Mediterranean is presented that first of all integrates geophysical satellite-derived gravity and airborne magnetic fields, as well as tectonic-structural, paleogeographical and facial analyses.

40|$|Title page, {{abstract}} and {{table of contents}} only. The complete thesis in print form {{is available from the}} University of Adelaide Library. The Cooper Basin comprises the Early Permian non-marine sediments of the Gidgealpa Group including the Roseneath Shale which is the major focus of the study. Lithologically, the Roseneath Shale has been identified as the thick lacustrine shale unit which was deposited in a large freshwater lake (the ‘Lake Roseneath’) extending across the basin. Previous studies were more focussed in the major troughs where the thickest units were observed such as the Nappamerri Trough. This study is concentrated on the Patchawarra Trough towards the southwestern of the basin to understand the possibility of facies variations in the study area. The combination of wireline log analysis, sequence stratigraphy and palynology permitted the study to create a new chronostratigraphic framework for the Roseneath Shale. To achieve this, palynological data was used to confine the APP 41 interval of the Roseneath Shale in the regional wireline correlation. A flooding surface was interpreted within the unit leading to identification of two distinct time-equivalent units; APP 41 a and APP 41 b units. The interpreted wireline cross section data was utilised for the construction of <b>isopach</b> <b>maps</b> and lithofacies <b>maps.</b> The <b>isopach</b> <b>maps</b> were used to understand the sediment distribution and to recognise thickness trends whereas the lithofacies maps were used to predict the source of the sediment supply and the regional facies variations. Core data of Moomba 065 was studied to understand the Epsilon-Roseneath transition. Derived from all the analysed data, palaeogeograhic maps for the two subunits were reconstructed. Based on the wireline log analysis, five depositional environments were recognised in the study area and these include lacustrine, prodelta, distributary mouth bar, distributary channel and coal swamp deposits. The APP 41 a interval represents a delta progradation from the north/northeast into the Lake Roseneath owing to an increase in sediment supply. The APP 41 b interval marks the increase in lake level and transgression of the lake toward the north. Regional subsidence and differential subsidence are the possible controls on the stratigraphic framework of the Roseneath Shale. Sedimentation of thin Roseneath Unit on the ridges along the Gidgealpa-Merrimelia-Innamincka Trend was proposed based on thickness trend shown in the <b>isopach</b> <b>maps</b> as well as the presence of preserved unit in some wells along this trend.

40|$|An {{extensive}} seismic reflection profile {{survey conducted}} concun:ently with a sediment coring program in northern Lake Huron, Georgian Bay, and the North Channel revealed a detailed Holocene lake level history. Seven acoustic sequences {{were identified in}} the seismic stratigraphy, and these sequences show great variation in both the character and the spatial distribution of sediment deposition through time. The depths to the acoustically-defined sequence boundaries were digitized from the analog seismic records and merged with Loran-C navigation records from the cruise, yielding a three-dimensional record of the location of each sequence boundary. Thicknesses of the sequences were calculated from these depths, and a minimum-curvature spline surface was fit to the thickness data. These surfaces were used to construct <b>isopach</b> <b>maps</b> which show the trends in thickness of sediment accumulation throughout the lake basins {{for each of the}} sequences. 14 C-AMS dates of materials from the cores fixed the dates of the sediment sequence boundaries, allowing sediment accumulation rates to be calculated. The distribution of sedimentation in the basins as shown on the <b>isopach</b> <b>maps</b> allowed assessment of sediment transport and water flow through the basins over time, which when combined with the work of Lewis & Anderson (1989), provides a detailed record of the transport and drainage of water through these basins as the Wisconsinan ice sheet retreated and isostatic rebound opened and closed outlets.
