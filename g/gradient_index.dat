40|$|Edge {{sharpness}} is {{very important}} to the visual quality of an image. Most commonly adopted methods increase the contrast of the edges to achieve sharpening. However, for wider ramp edges, increasing contrast alone brings very limited sharpening effect. In this paper, we propose a new method which sharpens an edge by reducing its width. Based on the intensity of a pixel and that of its neighbors, we derive three intensity <b>indices</b> and three <b>gradient</b> <b>indices</b> for the pixel. The three intensity indices are used to suggest whether the pixel is on an intensity ramp. The three <b>gradient</b> <b>indices</b> further indicate the location of the pixel relative to the ramp's centerline. If it is located above the centerline on the ramp, we increase the pixel's intensity. If it is located below the centerline, we reduce its intensity. If it is on or near the ramp's centerline, we leave the pixel's intensity unchanged. In this way the width of a ramp edge may be reduced and visually the edge becomes sharper.

40|$|Abstract. Functionally graded {{materials}} (FGMs) {{have become}} helpful in our engineering applications. Analysis of {{functionally graded material}} (FGM) plate during debonding case with different boundary conditions is {{the main purpose of}} this investigation. Elastic modulus (E) of functionally graded (FG) plate is assumed to vary continuously throughout the height of the plate, according the volume fraction of the constituent materials based on a modified sigmoid function, but the value of Poisson coefficient is constant. In this research, the finite element method (FEM) is used in order to show the shape of a plate made of FGM during debonding case with different boundary conditions. In the present investigation, the displacement value applied to the FGM plate is changed in order to find the relationship between the maximum von Mises stress and the displacement. Also, the relationship between the maximum shear stress and the displacement is carried out in the present work. The material <b>gradient</b> <b>indexes</b> of the FGM plate are changed from 1 to 10.
