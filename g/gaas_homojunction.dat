40|$|Abstract — It is {{well known}} that the gain–bandwidth product of an {{avalanche}} photodiode can be increased by utilizing a thin multiplication region. Previously, measurements of the excess noise factor of InP–InGaAsP–InGaAs avalanche photodiodes with separate absorption and multiplication regions indicated that this approach could also be employed to reduce the multiplication noise. This paper presents a systematic study of the noise characteristics of <b>GaAs</b> <b>homojunction</b> avalanche photodiodes with different multiplication layer thicknesses. It is demonstrated that there is a definite “size effect ” for multiplication regions less than approximately 0. 5 &quot;m.

This device, which was grown by molecular beam epitaxy, incorporates an undoped GaAs spacer between the emitter and base of a standard AlGaAs/GaAs single-heterojunction bipolar transistor.

40|$|Recently, new quantum {{features}} {{have been}} observed and studied {{in the area of}} nanostructured layers. Nanograting {{on the surface of the}} thin layer imposes additional boundary conditions on the electron wave function and induces G-doping or geometry doping. G-doping is equivalent to donor doping from the point of view of the increase in electron concentration n. However, there are no ionized impurities. This preserves charge carrier scattering to the intrinsic semiconductor level and increases carrier mobility with respect to the donor-doped layer. G-doping involves electron confinement to the nanograting layer. Here, we investigate the system of multiple nanograting layers forming a series of hetero- or homojunctions. The system includes main and barrier layers. In the case of heterojunctions, both types of layers were G-doped. In the case of homojunctions, main layers were G-doped and barrier layers were donor-doped. In such systems, the dependence of n on layer geometry and material parameters was analysed. Si and <b>GaAs</b> <b>homojunctions</b> and GaAs/AlGaAs, Si/SiGe, GaInP/AlGAs, and InP/InAlAs heterojunctions were studied. G-doping levels of 10 ^ 18 - 10 ^ 19 cm^- 3 were obtained in homojunctions and type II heterojunctions. High G-doping levels were attained only when the difference between band gap values was low.

40|$|The {{feasibility}} of fabricating space resistant, high efficiency, light weight, low cost <b>GaAs</b> shallow <b>homojunction</b> solar cells for space application is investigated.

40|$|The {{radiation}} resistance of ITO/InP cells processed by DC magnetron sputtering {{is compared to}} that of standard n/p InP and <b>GaAs</b> <b>homojunction</b> cells. After 20 MeV proton irradiations, it is found that the {{radiation resistance}} of the present ITO/InP cell is comparable to that of the n/p homojunction InP cell and that both InP cell types have radiation resistance significantly greater than GaAs. The relatively lower radiation resistance, observed at higher fluence, for the InP cell with the deepest junction depth, is attributed to losses in the cells emitter region. Diode parameters obtained from I sub sc - V sub oc plots, data from surface Raman spectroscopy, and determinations of surface conductivity types are used to investigate the configuration of the ITO/InP cells.

40|$|Electrical {{characteristics}} of a GaAs(p) /Si(n) interface were determined from capacitance-voltage, current-voltage, and secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS) measurements and compared to those on GaAs(p) epitaxial layers on GaAs(n) substrates. The comparison was made between the junctions as grown, and after an anneal at 850 C for 20 min in 10 percent forming gas under an As overpressure. For the GaAs/Si junction the ideality factor changed from 2 or larger to 1. 5 and the apparent intercept voltage changed from 2. 5 to 1. 3 V after annealing. For the <b>GaAs</b> <b>homojunction,</b> the intercept voltage increased from 1. 1 to 1. 3 V. In addition, the excess current in the forward and reverse bias conditions dropped drastically in the heterojunction. No movement of the metallurgical junction was discernible to within the resolution capability of SIMS. The junction properties obtained by annealing suggest an atomic restructuring of the Si(100) interface during growth or annealing.

40|$|Designs for PnP GaAs/InxGa 1 -xAs/GaAs {{heterojunction}} {{bipolar transistors}} (HBTs) are proposed and simulated {{with the aid}} of commercial software. Band diagrams, Gummel plots and common emitter characteristics are shown for the specific case of x= 1, x= 0. 7, and x linearly graded from 0. 75 to 0. 7. Of the three designs, it is found that the linearly graded case has the lowest leakage current and the highest current gain. IV curves for all four possible classes of InAs/GaAs heterojunction (nN, nP, pN, pP) are calculated. A pN heterojunction is fabricated and characterized. In spite of the 7 % lattice mismatch between InAs and GaAs, the diode has an ideality factor of 1. 26 over three decades in the forward direction. In the reverse direction, the leakage current grows exponentially with the magnitude of the bias, and shows an effective ideality factor of 3. 17, in stark disagreement with simulation. IV curves are taken over a temperature range of 105 K to 405 and activation energies are extracted.

Both GaAs cell types outperform conventional silicon n/p cells under the same conditions. An increase temperature dependency of maximum power for the GaAs n/p cells is attributed largely to differences in Voc between the two GaAs cell types. These results and diffusion length considerations are consistent with the conclusion that p-type GaAs is more radiation resistant than n-type and therefore that the n/p configuration is possibly favored for use in the space radiation environment. However, it is concluded that additional work is required in order to choose between the two GaAs cell configurations...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} in this dissertation attempts {{to take advantage of}} the nanowire platform in order to outperform state-of-the-art commercial detectors in one or more metrics. Nanowire photodetectors with increasing cutoff wavelength and device complexity will be presented, beginning with simple <b>GaAs</b> <b>homojunction</b> photodetectors. It is shown that through proper design, an ideality factor of = 1. 0 − 1. 15 and dark current density as low as = 6 ï¿½ 10 − 7 A/cm 2 can be achieved, both equivalent to the best bulk GaAs diodes. The design principles learned from this study are applied to all of the nanowire photodetectors that follow. InGaAs-GaAs heterojunction photodetectors exhibit = 1. 06 and a responsivity of up to 30 A/W, indicating avalanche gain. InGaAs avalanche photodetectors are shown to have low excess noise with = 0. 15 and a bandwidth of 2. 4 GHz. InGaAs-GaAs single photon avalanche diodes are operated in free-running mode with an ultra-low dark count rate of less than 60 Hz, a photon count rate of 8 MHz, and a timing jitter less than 38 ps. Free-running mode operation is possible through the control of afterpulsing through single nanowire avalanche pulses, with a maximum afterpulsing probability less than 25 %. Finally, InAsSb-InAs heterojunction photodetectors are presented with an absorption cutoff at 3. 0 μm and a maximum quantum efficiency of 29 %. This work shows that for most photodetectors operating in the near-infrared, the nanowire platform can either match or surpass conventional planar photodetector performance, and in the case of single photon detectors, provides a compelling case for the commercialization of nanowire-based photodetectors...|$|E
40|$|Annealing of {{radiation}} damage was observed {{for the first}} time in VPE-grown, 2 - by 2 -cm, n+/p/p+ <b>GaAs</b> shallow <b>homojunction</b> solar cells. Electrical performance of several cells was determined as a function of 1 -MeV electron fluence in the range of 10 to the 13 th power to 10 to the 15 th power e-/sq cm and as a function of thermal annealing time at various temperatures. Degradation of normalized power output after a fluence of 10 to the 15 th power 1 -MeV electrons/sq cm ranged from a low of 24 to 31 percent of initial maximum power. Normalized short circuit current degradation was limited to the range from 10 to 19 percent of preirradiated values. Thermal annealing was carried out in a flowing nitrogen gas ambient, with annealing temperatures spanning the range from 125 to 200 C. Substantial recovery of short circuit current was observed at temperatures as low as 175 C. In one case improvement by as much as 10 percent of the postirradiated value was observed. The key features of these cells are their extremely thin emitter layers (approxmately 0. 05 micrometers), the absence of any Al sub xGd sub 1 -x As passivating window layer, and their fabrication by vapor phase epitaxy...|$|R
40|$|A full-band Monte Carlo {{model is}} used to {{investigate}} the probability distribution functions of impact ionization path length and impact ionization energy for electrons and holes in GaAs. The simulations show that the soft ionization threshold energy in GaAs allows impact ionization to occur at energies {{much higher than the}} band gap. As a result, secondary carriers have a shorter dead space than newly injected carriers. The ionization path length distributions narrow at higher fields, producing a more deterministic impact ionization process in thin devices.

40|$|This work is {{concerned}} with the measurement and interpretation of avalanche noise in avalanche photodiodes (APDs). The design of a measurement system with a higher signal to noise ratio than previous systems reported in the published literature is described. The system uses phase sensitive recovery techniques, which allow the avalanche noise power and photocurrent to be measured unambiguously from the system noise and leakage current of the device under test. Using the measurement system described, avalanche noise measurements have been performed on a range of <b>homojunction</b> <b>GaAs</b> p"+-i-n"+ and n"+-i-p"+ diodes with 'i' region widths, w, from 2. 61 #mu#m to 0. 05 #mu#m, and on a range of homojunction InP p"+-i-n"+ diodes with widths, w, ranging from 2. 40 #mu#m to 0. 24 #mu#m. The results show that, for w #<=# 1 #mu#m, the dependence of excess noise factor F on multiplication does not follow the continuous noise model of McIntyre, which has become well established since its publication in 1966. Instead, a decreasing noise factor is observed as w decreases for a constant multiplication. This reduction in F occurs for both electron and hole initiated multiplication in the thinner w structures even though the ionisation coefficient ratio is close to unity. These results suggest that, in GaAs and in InP, if a thin multiplication region is used it is not always necessary for the greatest ionising carrier type to initiate multiplication for the lowest avalanche noise. To interpret the measurements, a model is used that includes the effect of dead space; the minimum distance a carrier must travel to gain the ionisation threshold energy. The dead space is found to be increasingly important in these thinner structures and restricts carriers to ionising {{in the latter half of}} their transit of the high field. This restriction makes the probability distribution function for the ionisation path length more deterministic and, in turn, reduces the overall unpredictability in the multiplication process, leading to a lower excess noise. The effect of distributed carrier generation, and so of mixed injection, in a 0. 1 #mu#m avalanche region is also investigated experimentally and using a model including dead space. These results show that the noise produced from mixed injection is lower than predicted by McIntyre's model, but higher than that obtained with pure electron or hole injection due to the effect of dead space.
