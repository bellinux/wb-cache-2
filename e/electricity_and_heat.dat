5|$|Sodium at {{standard}} temperature and pressure is a soft silvery metal that combines with oxygen in air and forms grayish white sodium oxide unless immersed in oil or inert gas, {{which are the}} conditions it is usually stored in. Sodium metal can be easily cut with a knife and is a good conductor of <b>electricity</b> <b>and</b> <b>heat</b> because it has only one electron in its valence shell, resulting in weak metallic bonding and free electrons, which carry energy. Due to having low atomic mass and large atomic radius, sodium is third-least dense of all elemental metals {{and is one of}} only three metals that can float on water, the other two being lithium and potassium. The melting (98°C) and boiling (883°C) points of sodium are lower than those of lithium but higher than those of the heavier alkali metals potassium, rubidium, and caesium, following periodic trends down the group. These properties change dramatically at elevated pressures: at 1.5 Mbar, the color changes from silvery metallic to black; at 1.9 Mbar the material becomes transparent with a red color; and at 3 Mbar, sodium is a clear and transparent solid. All of these high-pressure allotropes are insulators and electrides.|$|E
5|$|The {{municipality}} {{aims for}} a coherent and holistic {{administration of the}} water cycle to protect against or clean up previous pollution and encourage green growth and self-sufficiency. The main issues are excessive nutrients, adapting to increasing levels of precipitation brought on by climate change, and securing the water supply. These goals have manifested {{in a number of}} large water treatment projects often in collaboration with private partners. In the 2000s, underground rainwater basins were built across the city while the two lakes Årslev Engsø and Egå Engsø were created in 2003 and 2006 respectively. The number of sewage treatment plants is planned to be reduced from 17 to 2 by 2025 as the treatment plants in Marselisborg and Egå are scheduled for expansion to take over all waste water treatment. They have already been refitted for biogas production to become net producers of <b>electricity</b> <b>and</b> <b>heat.</b> To aid the new treatment plants, and avoid floodings, sewage and stormwater throughout the municipality is planned to be separated into two different drainage systems. Construction began in 2017 in several areas, but it is a long process and is scheduled to be finished by 2085.|$|E

50|$|Hydro was a {{chain of}} fuel {{stations}} throughout Sweden owned by Statoil. The chain had more than 500 stations, {{as well as some}} unmanned Uno-X stations. The company also operated in retailing natural gas, <b>electricity</b> <b>and</b> <b>heating</b> oil.|$|R
25|$|Additionally, {{the city}} has {{developed}} its own {{combined heat and power}} station, using waste wood biomass from the surrounding forests as a renewable energy source. With a thermal efficiency above 80%, the 45MW boiler of the plant provides <b>electricity</b> <b>and</b> <b>heat</b> for 44,000 dwellings. The Metz power station is the first local producer and distributor of energy in France.|$|E
25|$|Photovoltaic thermal hybrid solar {{collector}} (PVT) are systems that convert solar radiation into thermal and electrical energy. These systems combine a solar PV cell, which converts sunlight into electricity, with a solar thermal collector, which captures the remaining energy and removes waste {{heat from the}} PV module. The capture of both <b>electricity</b> <b>and</b> <b>heat</b> allow these devices to have higher exergy and thus be more overall energy efficient than solar PV or solar thermal alone.|$|E
25|$|Coal is {{primarily}} {{used as a}} solid fuel to produce <b>electricity</b> <b>and</b> <b>heat</b> through combustion. According to the EIA, world coal consumption is projected to increase from 2012 to 2040 at an average rate of 0.6%/year, from 153 quadrillion Btu (1 Quad are 36,000,000 tonnes of coal) in 2012 to 169 quadrillion Btu in 2020, and to 180 quadrillion Btu in 2040.

25|$|Incineration {{plants can}} {{generate}} <b>electricity</b> <b>and</b> <b>heat</b> that can substitute power plants powered by other fuels {{at the regional}} electric and district heating grid, and steam supply for industrial customers. Incinerators and other waste-to-energy plants generate at least partially biomass-based renewable energy that offsets greenhouse gas pollution from coal-, oil- and gas-fired power plants. The E.U. considers energy generated from biogenic waste (waste with biological origin) by incinerators as non-fossil renewable energy under its emissions caps. These greenhouse gas reductions are {{in addition to those}} generated by the avoidance of landfill methane.|$|E
25|$|Recoverable {{materials}} that are organic in nature, such as plant material, food scraps, and paper products, can be recovered through composting and digestion processes to decompose the organic matter. The resulting organic material is then recycled as mulch or compost for agricultural or landscaping purposes. In addition, waste gas from the process (such as methane) can be captured and used for generating <b>electricity</b> <b>and</b> <b>heat</b> (CHP/cogeneration) maximising efficiencies. The intention of biological processing in waste management is to control and accelerate the natural process of decomposition of organic matter. (See resource recovery).|$|E
25|$|Energy {{recovery}} from waste is {{the conversion of}} non-recyclable waste materials into usable heat, electricity, or fuel {{through a variety of}} processes, including combustion, gasification, pyrolyzation, anaerobic digestion, and landfill gas recovery. This process is often called waste-to-energy. Energy {{recovery from}} waste is part of the non-hazardous waste management hierarchy. Using energy recovery to convert non-recyclable waste materials into <b>electricity</b> <b>and</b> <b>heat,</b> generates a renewable energy source and can reduce carbon emissions by offsetting the need for energy from fossil sources as well as reduce methane generation from landfills. Globally, waste-to-energy accounts for 16% of waste management.|$|E
50|$|Mälarenergi {{owns and}} {{operates}} a number of plants, mostly {{for the production of}} <b>electricity</b> <b>and</b> <b>heating</b> but also plants for tap water production and waste water purification.

25|$|Combined {{heat and}} power (CHP) fuel cell systems, {{including}} Micro {{combined heat and power}} (MicroCHP) systems {{are used to}} generate both <b>electricity</b> <b>and</b> <b>heat</b> for homes (see home fuel cell), office building and factories. The system generates constant electric power (selling excess power back to the grid when it is not consumed), {{and at the same time}} produces hot air and water from the waste heat. As the result CHP systems have the potential to save primary energy as they can make use of waste heat which is generally rejected by thermal energy conversion systems. A typical capacity range of home fuel cell is 1–3kWel / 4–8kWth. CHP systems linked to absorption chillers use their waste heat for refrigeration.|$|E
25|$|As of 2012, {{there are}} 118 known elements, about 80 {{of which are}} stable – that is, they do not change by {{radioactive}} decay into other elements. Some elements can occur {{as more than a}} single chemical substance (allotropes). For instance, oxygen exists as both diatomic oxygen (O2) and ozone (O3). The majority of elements are classified as metals. These are elements with a characteristic lustre such as iron, copper, and gold. Metals typically conduct <b>electricity</b> <b>and</b> <b>heat</b> well, and they are malleable and ductile. Around a dozen elements, such as carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, are classified as non-metals. Non-metals lack the metallic properties described above, they also have a high electronegativity and a tendency to form negative ions. Certain elements such as silicon sometimes resemble metals and sometimes resemble non-metals, and are known as metalloids.|$|E
500|$|According to Lo, [...] "Habits (Stay High)" [...] is {{the song}} from Truth Serum (2014) {{that means the}} most to her because of its honest lyrics and {{extended}} writing process.
