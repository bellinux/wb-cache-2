25|$|Benzene in {{soft drinks}} {{has to be}} seen in the context of other {{environmental}} exposure. Taking the worst example found to date of a soft drink containing 87.9 ppb benzene, someone drinking a 350 ml (12oz) can would ingest 31 μg (micrograms) of benzene, almost equivalent to the benzene inhaled by a motorist refilling a fuel tank <b>for</b> <b>three</b> <b>minutes.</b> While there are alternatives to using sodium benzoate as a preservative, the casual consumption of such a drink is unlikely to pose a significant health hazard to a particular individual (see, for example, the EPA IRIS document on benzene).|$|E
25|$|Several {{studies have}} shown {{benefits}} of delayed cord clamping: A meta-analysis showed that delaying clamping of the umbilical cord in full-term neonates {{for a minimum of}} 2 minutes following birth is beneficial to the newborn in giving improved hematocrit, iron status as measured by ferritin concentration and stored iron, as well as a reduction in the risk of anemia (relative risk, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.40-0.70). A decrease was also found in a study from 2008. Although there is higher hemoglobin level at 2 months, this effect did not persist beyond 6 months of age. Not clamping the cord <b>for</b> <b>three</b> <b>minutes</b> following the birth of a baby improved outcomes at four years of age. A delay of three minutes or more in umbilical cord clamping after birth reduce the prevalence of anemia in infants.|$|E
