He also stresses that {{we are unable to}} make interesting positive claims about it because we are not able to experience the world of the understanding. Kant argues that we cannot use the notion of the world of the understanding to explain how freedom is possible or how pure reason could {{have anything to say about}} practical matters because we simply do not and cannot have a clear enough grasp of the world of the understanding. The notion of an intelligible world does point us towards the idea of a kingdom of ends, which is a useful and important idea. We just <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> not to get carried away and make claims that we are not entitled to.|$|E

He stated [...] "I think it's a very dangerous thing to suggest at this point. We could find ourselves cut off. ... We could not get into Afghanistan except through Pakistan.

But you don't want to be too careful because he's got a small strike zone and you can't afford to walk him. And that's only half the problem. When he gets on base he's more trouble still." [...] Sportswriter Tom Verducci wrote, [...] "Baseball {{is designed to be}} an egalitarian sort of game in which one player among the 18 is not supposed to dominate... Yet in the past quarter century Henderson and Barry Bonds have come closest to dominating a baseball game the way Michael Jordan could a basketball game." ...|$|E

The rocks will also kill the player on contact, so the player <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> not <b>to</b> get trapped between rocks and the red cars.

The church scene with Charlie and Liam at the church in Manchester was actually filmed on Honolulu, where the scenes on the Island are filmed. Monaghan says that he feels Charlie's black hoodie {{is a sort of}} [...] "security blanket" [...] that he hides underneath and uses it when he feels [...] "lost." [...] The [...] "heroin" [...] that Charlie is supposedly snorting is actually brown sugar. Monaghan revealed this in an interview with Stuff magazine in October 2005, saying, [...] " [...] brown sugar. You get some really sweet boogers. You <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> not to snort too much of it, but it's happened a few times. You just find dessert up your nose couple of hours later." ...|$|E
500|$|For {{the guitar}} sound, the group tried to balance Grohl's [...] "playing the rhythm {{straight}} up the middle", Shiflett's [...] "sharp and clean sense of melodic playing", and Smear's more aggressive sound, with Grohl declaring that [...] "with three guitars, you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> that it doesn't become a huge fucking mess. But when everybody's playing their thing really well, it sounds perfectly orchestrated." [...] Smear would usually play his parts on a baritone guitar, which would both contrast with Grohl and Shiflett {{and add a}} heavier sound - as Grohl declared, [...] "if we ever felt like a section wasn't heavy enough, we put the fuckin' baritone on it, and it became huge." [...] Hawkins added many buzz rolls to his drum fills {{at the suggestion of}} Vig, as buzz rolls were a trademark of one of the producer's favorite drummers, Ian Paice.|$|E
500|$|According to Caballero, SpongeBob was {{the most}} {{challenging}} character to translate to stop motion. It was so [...] "...just because of {{the sheer number of}} parts that needed to be made. We wanted to retain as much of that squashy-stretchy goofiness as possible, so he had dozens of replacement parts, like arms, noses, even various sizes of cheeks and freckles. Of course, as the main character, you really want to make sure he will charm the audience, which brings a special kind of pressure." [...] Walsh said, [...] "The {{most important thing is to}} capture the spirit of the character, not necessarily a literal copy of the 2D. Puppets have their own kind of energy and you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> about what to include and what to leave out." [...] On the other hand, Patchy the Pirate became the easiest character to make [...] "because he has the most humanoid proportions." ...|$|E

500|$|McCain {{played an}} {{important}} part in the expansion of U.S. involvement in Cambodia. [...] In April 1970, McCain gave personal briefings to Nixon in Honolulu, and to Nixon and National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger in San Clemente, where he highlighted the threat from North Vietnamese operations in Cambodia and Laos. [...] In particular, he said that Lon Nol's government in Cambodia would soon collapse unless North Vietnamese operations there were stopped, and that with a secure base there, North Vietnam could then launch attacks on South Vietnam which would cause the failure of Vietnamization. [...] McCain additionally said that the schedule for the ongoing withdrawal of U.S. ground forces from Vietnam had to be flexible. [...] McCain's views, which had the support of his subordinate, MACV commander General Creighton Abrams, helped persuade Nixon {{to go ahead with the}} Cambodian Incursion later that month. [...] Kissinger would subsequently tell another admiral, [...] "We <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> about having McCain around the president too much, because he fires up the president." ...|$|E

In discussion of the album, Key said that the band had matured and that the music in Lights and Sounds would be different from their previous album. Though, Key added, [...] "...we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful,</b> {{we have to try}} and write songs [...] we wrote before. We have to make a conscious effort {{not to think about the}} fact that we went from being a nothing band... to having a bunch of hit singles in like, one year." [...] Printz Board of The Black Eyed Peas collaborated with Yellowcard on the song [...] "Two Weeks from Twenty" [...] where he played a trumpet solo. The song, [...] "How I Go", features a duet with Dixie Chicks' lead vocalist Natalie Maines, and features a twenty-five piece orchestra, which was conducted by violinist Sean Mackin. According to Peter Mosely, the band liked the Dixie Chicks' and even thought of collaborating with Maines on Ocean Avenue for the song [...] "View from Heaven". Mosely also revealed that the band approached Maines about singing on [...] "How I Go"; [...] "The original plan was just for her to sing back-up (on the song). [...] it ended up turning into a duet." [...] He also added that Maines took a demo of the song and returned to the studio, Sunset Sound, where the band were working, in addition to the Dixie Chicks working on their album, with lyrics and vocals of her own.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the case}} of Chee Siok Chin v.

The judge held there was no actual bias whatsoever justifying the recusal application. She further held that judges <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> not to accede too readily to suggestions of actual bias by litigants who do not want particular judges to hear their cases, as this would encourage parties to believe that by seeking the disqualification of judges they would have their cases tried by other judges thought more likely to decide the cases in their favour.

2500|$|After leaving Asylum for Island Records, Waits {{released}} Swordfishtrombones in 1983, {{a record}} that marked a sharp turn in his musical direction.

You <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> when playing {{is no longer in}} the mind but in the fingers, going to happy places. You have to break them of their habits or you don't explore; you only play what is confident and pleasing. I'm learning to break those habits by playing instruments I know absolutely nothing about, like a bassoon or a waterphone." [...] Swordfishtrombones also introduced instruments such as bagpipes ("Town with No Cheer") and marimba ("Shore Leave") to Waits' repertoire, as well as pump organs, percussion (sometimes reminiscent of the music of Harry Partch), horn sections (often featuring Ralph Carney playing in the style of brass bands or soul music), experimental guitar, and obsolete instruments (many of Waits' albums have featured a damaged, unpredictable Chamberlin, and more recent albums have included the little-used Stroh violin).|$|E
