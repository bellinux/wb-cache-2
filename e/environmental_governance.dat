With reference to the 2005 World Summit, the General Assembly approved in April 2007 a number of loosely related reform initiatives, covering international <b>environmental</b> <b>governance,</b> a unified gender organization, and ‘Delivering as One’ at the country level to enhance the consolidation of UN programme activities.|$|E

25|$|The Community Forestry Program in Nepal is a {{participatory}} <b>environmental</b> <b>governance</b> {{that encompasses}} well-defined policies, institutions, and practices. The program addresses the twin goals of forest conservation and poverty reduction. As more than 70 percent of Nepal's population depends on agriculture for their livelihood, community management of forests {{has been a}} critically important intervention. Through legislative developments and operational innovations over three decades, the program has evolved from a protection-oriented, conservation-focused agenda to a much more broad-based strategy for forest use, enterprise development, and livelihood improvement. By April 2009, one-third of Nepal's population was participating in the program, directly managing more than one-fourth of Nepal's forest area.|$|E
25|$|Initially, EU {{environmental}} policy focused on Europe. More recently, the EU has demonstrated leadership in global <b>environmental</b> <b>governance,</b> e.g. {{the role of}} the EU in securing the ratification and coming into force of the Kyoto Protocol despite opposition from the United States. This international dimension is reflected in the EU's Sixth Environmental Action Programme, which recognises that its objectives can only be achieved if key international agreements are actively supported and properly implemented both at EU level and worldwide. The Lisbon Treaty further strengthened the leadership ambitions. EU law has {{played a significant role in}} improving habitat and species protection in Europe, as well as contributing to improvements in air and water quality and waste management.|$|E

2500|$|However, {{the concept}} is {{routinely}} used in {{the proceedings of the}} United Nations, and in the UN Daily News. For example, the UNEP Executive Director Achim Steiner states that the challenge of agriculture is to [...] "feed a growing global population without pushing humanity's footprint beyond planetary boundaries."

2500|$|Several {{environmental}} protocols {{have been}} established (see List of international environmental agreements) {{as a type of}} international law, [...] "an intergovernmental document intended as legally binding with a primary stated purpose of preventing or managing human impacts on natural resources." [...] International environmental protocols came to feature in <b>environmental</b> <b>governance</b> after trans-boundary environmental problems became widely perceived in the 1960s. [...] Following the Stockholm Intergovernmental Conference in 1972, creation of international environmental agreements proliferated. Due to the barriers already discussed, environmental protocols are not a panacea for global commons issues. [...] Often, they are slow to produce the desired effects, tend to the lowest common denominator, and lack monitoring and enforcement. They also take an incremental approach to solutions where sustainable development principles suggest that environmental concerns should be mainstream political issues.|$|E

State authorities rule increasingly via laws and decentralise environmental policymaking and implementation.

5000|$|The International Institute for Sustainable Development {{proposes a}} [...] "reform agenda" [...] for global <b>environmental</b> <b>governance.</b> The main {{argument}} is that there seems to exist an unspoken but powerful consensus on the essential objectives {{of a system of}} global <b>environmental</b> <b>governance.</b> These goals would require top-quality leadership, a strong environmental policy based on knowledge, effective cohesion and coordination, good management of the institutions constituting the <b>environmental</b> <b>governance</b> system, and spreading environmental concerns and actions to other areas of international policy and action.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the global}} level there are {{numerous}} important actors involved in <b>environmental</b> <b>governance</b> and [...] "a range of institutions contribute to and help define the practice of global <b>environmental</b> <b>governance.</b> The idea of global <b>environmental</b> <b>governance</b> is to govern the environment {{at a global level}} through a range of nation states and non state actors such as national governments, NGOs and other international organisations such as UNEP (United Nations Environment Programme). Global <b>environmental</b> <b>governance</b> is the answer to calls for new forms of governance because of the increasing complexity of the international agenda. It is perceived to be an effective form of multilateral management and essential to the international community in meeting goals of mitigation and the possible reversal of the impacts on the global environment. However, a precise definition of global <b>environmental</b> <b>governance</b> is still vague and there are many issues surrounding global governance.Elliot argues that “the congested institutional terrain still provides more of an appearance than a reality of comprehensive global governance.” [...] This meant that there are too many institutions within the global governance of the environment for it to be completely inclusive and coherent leaving it merely portraying the image of this to the global public. Global <b>environmental</b> <b>governance</b> is about more than simply expanding networks of institutions and decision makers. “It is a political practice which simultaneously reflects, constitutes and masks global relations of power and powerlessness.” State agendas exploit the use of global <b>environmental</b> <b>governance</b> to enhance their oven agendas or wishes even if this is at the detriment of the vital element behind global <b>environmental</b> <b>governance</b> which is the environment. Elliot states that global <b>environmental</b> <b>governance</b> “is neither normatively neutral nor materially benign.”As explored by Newell, report notes by The Global Environmental Outlook noted that the systems of global <b>environmental</b> <b>governance</b> are becoming increasingly irrelevant or impotent due to patterns of globalisation such as; imbalances in productivity and the distribution of goods and services, unsustainable progression of extremes of wealth and poverty and population and economic growth overtaking environmental gains. Newell states that, despite such acknowledgements, the “managing of global environmental change within International Relations continues to look to international regimes for the answers.” ...|$|E

Furthermore, the partnerships exemplify the use of transnational governance networks as a mechanism by which to implement environmental policy at local and regional level.
