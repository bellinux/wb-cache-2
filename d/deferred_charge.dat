50|$|<b>Deferred</b> <b>charge</b> (or deferral) is {{cost that}} is accounted-for in latter {{accounting}} period for its anticipated future benefit, or {{to comply with}} the requirement of matching costs with revenues. Deferred charges include costs of starting up, obtaining long-term debt, advertising campaigns, etc., and are carried as a non-current asset on the balance sheet pending amortization. Deferred charges often extend over five years or more and occur infrequently unlike prepaid expenses, e.g. insurance, interest, rent. Financial ratios are based on the total assets excluding deferred charges since they have no physical substance (cash realization) and cannot be used in reducing total liabilities.|$|E

What may {{be referred to as}} a credit card, is most likely to be a deferred debit card on an associated bank current account, {{the most common type of}} card in Israel, somewhat like the situation in France, though the term [...] "debit card" [...] is not in common usage. Cards are nearly universally called cartis eshrei (כרטיס אשראי), literally, [...] "credit card", a term which may bely the card's characteristics. Its main feature may be a direct link to a connected bank account (through which they are mostly issued), with the total value of the transactions made on the card being debited from the bank account in full on a regular date once a month, without the option to carry the balance over; indeed certain types of transactions (such as online and/or foreign currency) may be debited directly from the connected bank account at the time of the transaction. Any such limited credit enjoyed is a result of the customer's assets and credibility with the bank, and not granted by the credit card company. The card usually enables immediate ATM cash withdrawals & balance inquiries (as debit cards do), instalment & <b>deferred</b> <b>charge</b> interest free transactions offered by merchants (also applicable in Brazil), interest bearing instalment plans/deferred charge/revolving credit which is transaction specific at the point of sale (though granted by the issuer, hence the interest), and a variety of automated/upon request types of credit schemes including loans, some of which revolve or resemble the extended payment options sometimes offered by charge cards.|$|E

Therefore, Introduction of fair value accounting will bring income measurement to recent bouts of increased volatility and wide swing in market valuation. In these circumstances, this article discusses one set of the standards on accounting for deferral in the standard-setting direction. Conventionally, it was focused from a view point of allocation of flow in a deferred concept. However, in response to the international trend of the recognition of the debt at fair value, accounting standards based on a deferred concept will come to reflect the reality of stock. It become clear that the deferred concept it was considered that was space of management discretion is also exposed to the influence of the logic of a market. Moreover, for example, the latest international accounting standard-setting focused on exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources, the <b>deferred</b> <b>charge</b> based on allocation of flow should be applied accounting for impairment in accounting period subsequent to initial measurement. That is, the logic of a market has attained to the traditional accounting treatment and therefore, it cannot be overemphasized that the validity of management discretion is examined...|$|E

40|$|The charge {{transfer}} efficiency of a CCD {{is based on}} the average level of signal lost per pixel over a number of transfers. This value can be used to directly compare the relative performances of different structures, increases in radiation damage or to quantify improvements in operating parameters. This number does not however give sufficient detail to mitigate for the actual signal loss/deference in either of the transfer directions that may be critical to measuring shapes to high accuracy, such as those required in astronomy applications (e. g. for Gaia’s astrometry or the galaxy distortion measurements for Euclid) based in the radiation environment of space. Pocket-pumping is an established technique for finding the location and activation levels of traps; however, a number of parameters in the process can also be explored to identify the trap species and location to sub-pixel accuracy. This information can be used in two ways to increase the sensitivity of a camera. Firstly, the clocking process can be optimised for the time constant of the majority of traps in each of the transfer directions, reducing <b>deferred</b> <b>charge</b> during read out. Secondly, a correction algorithm can be developed and employed during the post-processing of individual frames to move most of any deferred signal back into the charge packet it originated from.

40|$|The {{method of}} book value is, relatively, {{the easiest and}} the least {{time-consuming}} method of enterprise assets’ valuation. However, the reliability of valuation by means of this method is questionable. The source of this doubt {{can be attributed to}} the problem of equivocal qualification of some liabilities to equities or to outside capital. <b>Deferred</b> incomes and <b>charges</b> are a particular example of the said liabilities. One of the reasons of showing <b>deferred</b> <b>charges</b> on the assets side and provisions on the liabilities side is the existence of a transitory difference in the income tax. The author of the paper raises the question if this difference influences the value of net assets, and if so, whether it depends on the way it is included in the formula of determining this value? It has been proved that the influence of the allocation for the transitory difference in the income tax on the value of net assets depends on the method of their classification when determining this value. It has also been proved that, at the point of calculating the value of net assets, there exists a problem of classifying some liabilities as equities or as outside capital and that it is needed that each and every part of a balance included in this calculation be dealt with individually...|$|R

40|$|Debt {{issue costs}} {{generally}} are incurred {{in connection with}} the issuance of debt securities or other short- or long-term borrowings. Opinion 21 requires that debt issue costs be reported in the balance sheet as <b>deferred</b> <b>charges.</b> Generally, debt issue costs are capitalized as an asset and amortized over the term of the debt. Statement 95 requires that cash receipts and payments in a statement of cash flows be classified as operating, investing, or financing activities. However, some believe that Statement 95 does not provide specific guidance on the classification of debt issue costs in the statement of cash flows. Because debt issue costs have aspects of more than one class of cash flows, diversity in practice has arisen. Some companies have reported the cash outflow for debt issue costs as a financing activity, while others have reported the outflow for those costs as an operating activity. The issue is how cash payments for debt issue costs should be classified in the statement of cash flows.

50|$|In 2009, {{the school}} {{district}} began facing major civil and criminal complaints about its treatment of special needs children. That year, Tifonie Schilling alleged that two special education paraprofessionals and a special education teacher at North Middle School had physically abused her son. An investigation by the Great Falls Public Schools supported one of three accusations made by Schilling. When news media reported the allegations, three other families made similar accusations of abuse to the Great Falls Police Department, but no charges came of them. The two paraprofessionals were charged in 2009 with felony assault of a minor and misdemeanor endangering the welfare of a child. No charges were filed against the teacher, as police {{found no evidence that}} she directly abused the child. Montana's Attorney General Steve Bullock declined to investigate the allegations, arguing that this was the province of city prosecutors and he would not second-guess them without clear evidence of abuse of prosecutorial discretion. He also contended that the allegations were a matter of professional ethics and district school policy, and should be handled administratively. Great Falls city prosecutors eventually agreed to <b>defer</b> <b>charges</b> against the two. In November 2011, several families of special needs children filed a lawsuit against {{the school district}}, alleging that GFPS knew the paraprofessionals were abusing children in February 2008 (a year before the Schilling case came to light). GFPS settled out of court with seven families in November 2012, agreeing to pay a total of $595,000 to parents of children abused between 2007 and 2009. Meanwhile, in 2010, Schilling filed a $4 million discrimination claim against GFPS with the Montana Human Rights Commission. On May 19, 2011, the Human Rights Commission ordered the school district to pay $150,000 to Schilling for discriminating against her son based on his mental, physical, emotional, and developmental handicaps. GFPS sued to overturn the decision of the Montana Human Rights Commission, and as of September 2014 the appeal was still not resolved.|$|R

Boyarin holds that passivity is an essential feature of Judaism, and that because this is a quality that is held in common with homosexuality, it has the power to inspire panic among Jews who fear the censorious gaze of authority.
