25|$|In metal, the lip and {{spur drill}} bit is {{confined}} to drilling only the thinnest and softest sheet metals in a <b>drill</b> <b>press.</b> The bits have an extremely fast cutting tool geometry: no point angle and a large (considering the flat cutting edge) lip angle causes the edges {{to take a very}} aggressive cut with relatively little point pressure. This means these bits tend to bind in metal; given a workpiece of sufficient thinness, they have a tendency to punch through and leave the bit's cross-sectional geometry behind.|$|E
500|$|After high school, Sands entered Clark University, {{where he}} studied physics and mathematics, and {{eventually}} received his Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) in 1940. [...] At Clark, his physics professors were Theodore P. Jorgensen, who became famous for his book [...] "The Physics of Golf", and Percy M. Roope, {{who participated in the}} rocket experiments of Robert H. Goddard. [...] As part of a job subsidized at 35 cents per hour by the National Youth Administration, they assigned him to build physics equipment in the machine shops, where he became familiar with the <b>drill</b> <b>press,</b> lathe, and other metalworking tools.|$|E
50|$|For most drill presses—especially those {{meant for}} {{woodworking}} or home use—speed change {{is achieved by}} manually moving a belt across a stepped pulley arrangement. Some <b>drill</b> <b>presses</b> add a third stepped pulley {{to increase the number}} of available speeds. Modern <b>drill</b> <b>presses</b> can, however, use a variable-speed motor in conjunction with the stepped-pulley system. Medium-duty <b>drill</b> <b>presses</b> such as those used in machine shop (tool room) applications are equipped with a continuously variable transmission. This mechanism is based on variable-diameter pulleys driving a wide, heavy-duty belt. This gives a wide speed range as well as the ability to change speed while the machine is running. Heavy-duty <b>drill</b> <b>presses</b> used for metalworking are usually of the gear-head type described below.|$|R
50|$|Geared head <b>drill</b> <b>presses</b> are {{commonly}} found in tool rooms and other commercial environments where a heavy duty machine capable of production drilling and quick setup changes is required. In most cases, the spindle is machined to accept Morse taper tooling for greater flexibility. Larger geared head <b>drill</b> <b>presses</b> are frequently fitted with power feed on the quill mechanism, with an arrangement to disengage the feed when a certain drill depth has been achieved or {{in the event of}} excessive travel. Some gear-head <b>drill</b> <b>presses</b> have the ability to perform tapping operations without the need for an external tapping attachment. This feature is commonplace on larger gear head <b>drill</b> <b>presses.</b> A clutch mechanism drives the tap into the part under power and then backs it out of the threaded hole once the proper depth is reached. Coolant systems are also common on these machines to prolong tool life under production conditions.|$|R

Russell was awarded an honorary Doctor of Engineering degree by the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn. He was also named alumnus of the year by California State Polytechnic College for inventing the Klystron.|$|E
2500|$|In April 1956, the {{department}} issued a multi-state alert {{for a person}} described as a skilled mechanic, with access to a <b>drill</b> <b>press</b> or lathe (for its ability to thread pipe), who posted mail from White Plains, was over 40, and had a [...] "deep-seated hatred of the Consolidated Edison Company". A warning circular picturing a homemade pipe bomb similar to the bomber's was distributed. Police distributed samples of the bomber's distinctive printing and asked anyone who might recognize it to notify them. [...] A review of drivers' license applications in White Plains, the city favored by the bomber for posting his mail, found similarities in 500 {{of them to the}} bomber's printing; the names were forwarded to the NYPD for investigation.|$|E

50|$|A <b>drill</b> <b>press</b> (also {{known as}} a {{pedestal}} drill, pillar drill, or bench drill) is a fixed style of drill that may be mounted on a stand or bolted to the floor or workbench. Portable models with a magnetic base grip the steel workpieces they drill. A <b>drill</b> <b>press</b> consists of a base, column (or pillar), table, spindle (or quill), and drill head, usually driven by an induction motor. The head has a set of handles (usually 3) radiating from a central hub that, when turned, move the spindle and chuck vertically, parallel to the axis of the column. The <b>drill</b> <b>press</b> is typically {{measured in terms of}} swing. Swing is defined as twice the throat distance, which is the distance {{from the center of the}} spindle to the closest edge of the pillar. For example, a 16 in <b>drill</b> <b>press</b> has an 8 in throat distance.|$|E

50|$|<b>Drill</b> <b>presses</b> {{are almost}} always {{equipped}} with more powerful motors compared to hand-held drills. This enables larger drill bits to be used and also speeds up drilling with smaller bits.|$|R
50|$|Almost all {{machine tool}} spindles, and many power tool spindles, have a taper {{as their primary}} method of {{attachment}} for tools. Even on many <b>drill</b> <b>presses,</b> handheld <b>drills,</b> and lathes, which have chucks (such as a drill chuck or collet chuck), the chuck is attached by a taper. On <b>drills,</b> <b>drill</b> <b>presses,</b> and milling machines, the male member is the tool shank or toolholder shank, and the female socket is integral with the spindle. On lathes, the male may belong to the tool or to the spindle; spindle noses may have male tapers, female tapers, or both.|$|R

50|$|A third type also exists, {{a lighter}} machine, called a mill-drill, {{which is a}} close {{relative}} of the vertical mill and quite popular with hobbyists. A mill-drill is similar in basic configuration to a small <b>drill</b> <b>press,</b> but equipped with an X-Y table. They also typically use more powerful motors than a comparably sized <b>drill</b> <b>press,</b> with potentiometer-controlled speed and generally have more heavy-duty spindle bearings than a <b>drill</b> <b>press</b> {{to deal with the}} lateral loading on the spindle that is created by a milling operation. A mill drill also typically raises and lowers the entire head, including motor, often on a dovetailed vertical, where a <b>drill</b> <b>press</b> motor remains stationary, while the arbor raises and lowers within a driving collar. Other differences that separate a mill-drill from a <b>drill</b> <b>press</b> may be a fine tuning adjustment for the Z-axis, a more precise depth stop, the capability to lock the X, Y or Z axis, and often a system of tilting the head or the entire vertical column and powerhead assembly to allow angled cutting. Aside from size and precision, the principal difference between these hobby-type machines and larger true vertical mills is that the X-Y table is at a fixed elevation; the Z-axis is controlled in basically the same fashion as <b>drill</b> <b>press,</b> where a larger vertical or knee mill has a vertically fixed milling head, and changes the X-Y table elevation. As well, a mill-drill often uses a standard drill press-type Jacob's chuck, rather than an internally tapered arbor that accepts collets. These are frequently of lower quality than other types of machines, but still fill the hobby role well because they tend to be benchtop machines with small footprints and modest price tags.|$|E
5000|$|Similarly, in rotating-cutter {{metalworking}} {{machine tools}} (such as milling machines and <b>drill</b> <b>presses),</b> the spindle is the shaft {{to which the}} tool (such as a drill bit or milling cutter) is attached (for example, via a chuck).|$|R
50|$|Drilling {{operations}} are operations in which holes are produced or refined by bringing a rotating cutter with cutting edges {{at the lower}} extremity {{into contact with the}} workpiece. Drilling {{operations are}} done primarily in <b>drill</b> <b>presses</b> but sometimes on lathes or mills.|$|R
50|$|Machine vises {{are mounted}} on <b>drill</b> <b>presses,</b> {{grinding}} machines and milling machines. Abrasive chop saws {{have a special}} type of machine vise built into the saw. Some hobbyists use a machine vise as a bench vise because of the low cost and small size.|$|R
50|$|A geared head <b>drill</b> <b>press</b> is a <b>drill</b> <b>press</b> {{in which}} power {{transmission}} from the motor to the spindle is achieved solely through spur gearing inside the machine's head. No friction elements (e.g., belts) {{of any kind}} are used, which assures a positive drive at all times and minimizes maintenance requirements. Gear head drills are intended for metalworking applications where the drilling forces are higher and the desired speed (RPM) is lower than that used for woodworking.|$|E

5000|$|A [...] "machine tool" [...] is {{a machine}} which makes parts to other machines, such as screws or gun stocks, {{generally}} without a skilled craftsman doing the precision work. Instead, a machine operator controls the machine {{as it does}} the precision work. Lathes, milling machines, and <b>drill</b> <b>presses</b> are precision machine tools. The museum has the largest collection of historically significant machine tools in the United States.|$|R
5000|$|Hollow milling cutters, {{more often}} called simply hollow mills, are {{essentially}} [...] "inside-out endmills". They are {{shaped like a}} piece of pipe (but with thicker walls), with their cutting edges on the inside surface. They are used on turret lathes and screw machines as an alternative to turning with a box tool, or on milling machines or <b>drill</b> <b>presses</b> to finish a cylindrical boss (such as a trunnion).|$|R
50|$|Lathes can be {{combined}} with other machine tools, such as a <b>drill</b> <b>press</b> or vertical milling machine. These are usually referred to as combination lathes.|$|E

50|$|<b>Drill</b> <b>presses</b> {{are often}} used for {{miscellaneous}} workshop tasks other than drilling holes. This includes sanding, honing, and polishing. These tasks can be performed by mounting sanding drums, honing wheels and various other rotating accessories in the chuck. This can be unsafe in some cases, as the chuck arbor, which may be retained in the spindle solely by the friction of a taper fit, may dislodge during operation if the side loads are too high.|$|R
