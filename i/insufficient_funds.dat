5|$|This {{perceived}} {{problem with}} expenditure was given further credence when the Hull Stingrays announced on 11 August 2010 {{that they were}} ceasing operations immediately due to <b>insufficient</b> <b>funds</b> from sponsorship to guarantee completing the season. They were, however, taken over on 17 August 2010 by Coventry Blaze and therefore Hull Stingrays continued to operate.|$|E
5|$|Commonwealth {{forces were}} engaged in {{numerous}} conflicts in the south (against the Ottoman Empire), the east (against the Tsardom of Muscovy and later, the Russian Empire) and the north (the Kingdom of Sweden); as well as internal conflicts (most notably, numerous Cossack uprisings). For the first century or so, the Commonwealth military was usually successful, but became less so from around the mid-17th century. Plagued by <b>insufficient</b> <b>funds,</b> it found itself increasingly hard-pressed to defend the country, and inferior in numbers to the growing armies of the Commonwealth's neighbors.|$|E

Michael López-Alegría, President of the Commercial Spaceflight Federation, also attributed the delays in the program to funding problems.|$|R

5|$|Hsu may in {{fact have}} been running {{multiple}} cons on a massive scale. As an example, a New York investment fund run by Woodstock Festival founder Joel Rosenman invested $40 million spread over 37 separate deals with a Hsu company. Hsu reportedly told Rosenman {{the money would be}} used to manufacture apparel for well known luxury brands, yielding a 40% profit on each deal. When Rosenman's fund recently attempted to cash checks from Hsu's company in September 2007, there were <b>insufficient</b> <b>funds.</b> Federal charges of fraud have since been brought against Hsu.|$|E
5|$|The Clevedon Pier Preservation Society {{was formed}} in 1972 and started campaigning for the {{restoration}} of the pier. The district council applied for permission to demolish the pier in 1979, but a public enquiry the following year ruled that it should be retained. The pavilions {{from the end of the}} pier were taken ashore in 1982 for storage in anticipation of eventual restoration; <b>insufficient</b> <b>funds</b> were available to complete restoration and the first stage was to open the Toll House as an exhibition centre in 1984.|$|E
5|$|Ranavalona died {{without ever}} having {{returned}} to Madagascar, after two formal requests in 1910 and 1912 were refused on the pretext of <b>insufficient</b> <b>funds</b> in the colonial coffers. The exiled queen died suddenly at her villa in Algeria on May 23, 1917, {{the victim of a}} severe embolism. Ranavalona was buried at the Saint-Eugene cemetery in Algiers at 10:00a.m. on May 25. Her funeral was attended by dozens of personal friends, admirers, Red Cross colleagues, members of her church congregation and prominent figures of the political and cultural elite of Algiers. By nine in the morning, a long line of cars had already formed {{at the entrance to the}} memorial site.|$|E

5|$|The {{preceding}} German large cruiser design, , was {{an incremental}} increase over previous armored cruisers. Blücher was armed with twelve 21cm(8.3in) guns, {{and designed to}} counter what the Germans knew about the British , which were assumed to be larger iterations of the basic armored cruiser type. Once sufficient information about the new British cruisers became available, {{it was obvious that}} they were not simply an enlargement on previous designs but a whole new type of warship—the battlecruiser—to which Blücher was quite inferior. However, there were <b>insufficient</b> <b>funds</b> to alter Blüchers layout, so the cruiser assigned for 1907 would have to be an entirely new design.|$|E
5|$|Without Marguerite Louise {{to occupy}} his attentions, Cosimo turned to persecuting the Jewish {{population}} of Tuscany. Sexual Intercourse between Jews and Christians was proscribed, {{and by a}} law promulgated on 1 July 1677, Christians could not work in establishments owned by Jews. If they did regardless, a fine of 50 crowns was incurred; if the person in question had <b>insufficient</b> <b>funds,</b> he was liable to be tortured on the rack; {{and if he was}} deemed unfit for torture, a four-month prison sentence was substituted. The anti-Semitic roster was supplemented by further declarations on 16 June 1679 and 12 December 1680 banning Jews from visiting Christian prostitutes and co-habitation, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Between his two matches against Janowski, Lasker {{arranged}} another World Chess Championship in January–February 1910 against Carl Schlechter. Schlechter was {{a modest}} gentleman, who was generally unlikely {{to win the}} major chess tournaments by his peaceful inclination, his lack of aggressiveness and his willingness to accept most draw offers from his opponents (about 80% of his games finished by a draw). The conditions of the match against Lasker are still debated among chess historians, but it seems Schlechter accepted to play under very unfavourable conditions, notably that {{he would need to}} finish two points ahead of Lasker to be declared the winner of the match, and he would need to win a revenge match to be declared World Champion. The match was originally meant to consist of 30 games, but when it became obvious that there were <b>insufficient</b> <b>funds</b> (Lasker demanded a fee of 1,000 marks per game played), the number of games was reduced to ten, making the margin of two points all the more difficult.|$|E

5|$|By mid-1826, the Canal Company had <b>insufficient</b> <b>funds</b> to {{complete}} the work, and a special meeting authorised the taking out of a mortgage to cover the £15,000 deficit. The canal was an obvious competitor to the River Tone Navigation, which was managed by the Conservators of the River Tone, a legal body created for that purpose by Act of Parliament in 1699. There was animosity between the Company and the Conservators, with the Company maintaining {{that they had a}} right to use the Tone to reach the centre of Taunton, and the Conservators maintaining that they did not. The canal was scheduled to be opened on 1 January 1827, but the opening was delayed until 3 January, as the connection to the River Tone was not made until 2 January. The opening celebrations were hampered by snow and bitter cold weather.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} third century, {{the balance of}} power had shifted from the Senate to the army, and the {{position}} of the Senate was considerably weakened. The emperor of Rome was appointed by the support of the military, while the Senate existed solely to officiate state affairs without any real authority. Both Macrinus and later Elagabalus secured the support of the military while generally disregarding the opinion of the Senate. Macrinus was in dire circumstances after Elagabalus' rebellion and had no other choice but to turn to the Senate for assistance. While in Antioch, Macrinus made one final attempt at securing support, this time from Rome. A combination of distrust from the Senate, <b>insufficient</b> <b>funds,</b> and Elagabalus' impending approach, however, forced Macrinus to face Elagabalus' approaching legions with only his Praetorian Guard. Had more time had been available, the Prefect of Rome Marius Maximus {{might have been able to}} muster troops to send as reinforcements to assist Macrinus. Despite their relative powerlessness, the Senate still declared war against the usurper and his family.|$|E
5|$|The new English Parliament, which met in March of {{the same}} year, was quite hostile to Charles. Many members feared that he had {{intended}} to use the standing army to suppress dissent or impose Catholicism. However, with <b>insufficient</b> <b>funds</b> voted by Parliament, Charles was forced to gradually disband his troops. Having lost the support of Parliament, Danby resigned his post of Lord High Treasurer, but received a pardon from the king. In defiance of the royal will, the House of Commons declared that the dissolution of Parliament did not interrupt impeachment proceedings, and that the pardon was therefore invalid. When the House of Lords attempted to impose the punishment of exile—which the Commons thought too mild—the impeachment became stalled between the two Houses. As he had been {{required to do so}} many times during his reign, Charles bowed to the wishes of his opponents, committing Danby to the Tower of London, in which he was held for another five years.|$|E

5|$|The school {{continued}} to use the former guildhall site in Hill Street until 1898, by which stage the medieval building was much altered and in a dilapidated condition. At this point, the school moved to an 18th-century house on South Brink. A fundraising campaign was launched {{to pay for the}} house, but after <b>insufficient</b> <b>funds</b> were donated, the cost of purchase was met by Alexander, Baron Peckover. The house and its grounds was originally intended to be the headmaster's residence and provide lodgings for a few boarders, but soon expanded to accommodate the entire school with the construction of classrooms and a hall. The central block of the 18th-century town house was used as a panelled library. An unusual feature of the old town house is the cupola on the roof, evidence of the town's sea-based prosperity.|$|E
5|$|In March 1979, the {{dilapidated}} theatre {{was purchased}} by a trust headed by Jeremy Fry for £155,000. The following year, an appeal was launched {{to raise money for}} renovations, including the complete rebuilding of the stage, installation of a steel grid to hold stage lighting and scenery and a higher fly system, to allow major touring companies, including the Royal National Theatre under Peter Hall, to be booked to perform. The total projected cost was £3.5 million, of which £1.8 million was seen as being essential to reopening the theatre. Money and donations in kind were received from the city council, Arts Council England, Bath Preservation Trust, Leche Trust, Historic buildings council, Manifold Trust, South-West Stonecleaning and Restoration Company and many individuals. Work on the building started to designs by Dowton and Hurst. However, as <b>insufficient</b> <b>funds</b> had been raised by 1982 to complete the work, loans were negotiated with the Bristol & West and Lombard North Central with guarantees from local councils. The theatre reopened on 30 November 1982 with a performance of A Midsummer Night's Dream, featuring a cast from the National Theatre led by Paul Scofield. The event was attended by Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon.|$|E
