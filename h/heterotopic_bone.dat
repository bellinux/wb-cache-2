50|$|The only {{definitive}} {{diagnostic test}} in the early acute stage is a bone scan, which will show hetertopic ossification 7 - 10 days earlier than an x-ray.

However, an abnormality detected in the early phase may not progress to the formation of <b>heterotopic</b> <b>bone.</b> Another finding, often misinterpreted as early <b>heterotopic</b> <b>bone</b> formation, is an increased (early) uptake around the knees or the ankles in a patient with a very recent spinal cord injury.

40|$|Selection {{pressures}} on copulatory systems rapidly shape {{the anatomy of}} external genitals, affecting both the occurrence and form (size+shape) of baculum (os penis) and baubellum (os clitoridis) in primates. These <b>heterotopic</b> <b>bones</b> are usually located within the distal end of the penis and clitoris. However, the pattern of occurrence within the primate phylogenetic tree and the multitude of forms shown cannot be easily merged into a univocal functional interpretation. This study aims to develop a methodological protocol to supply a suitable dataset of bone virtual volumes. These data are useful in morphological approaches exploiting both traditional and geometric morphometric techniques. We provide results on samples from both captive individuals (i. e. fresh samples from corpses coming from zoos or research laboratories) and museum samples (i. e. the primate collection of “La Specola” Natural History Museum, Florence, IT). We followed a three-step protocol which entails progressive sophistication: (1) manual palpation (efficient for fresh tissues, much less so for museum tissues made stiff by either alcohol or formalin); (2) X-rays (confirming or not the palpation); (3 a) if absence is confirmed, histological analysis is performed focused on hypothetical traces of cartilage or osteocytes; (3 b) if presence is confirmed, high resolution 3 D images are obtained by using a non-invasive microtomography system which allows the exploration of both the external and internal structure of bones. The main objectives of the research were (1) completing the primate genital bone occurrence matrix at the specific level, and (2) providing morphological data to test evolutionary hypotheses by overlapping form variation to reproductive and ecological correlates...|$|R

40|$|Neurogenic, {{heterotopic}} ossification is characterised by {{the formation}} of new, extraosseous (ectopic) bone in soft tissue in patients with neurological disorders. A 33 -year-old female, who was born with spina bifida, paraplegia, and diastasis of symphysis pubis, had indwelling urethral catheter drainage and was using oxybutynin bladder instillations. She was prescribed diuretic for swelling of feet, which aggravated bypassing of catheter. Hence, suprapubic cystostomy was performed. Despite anticholinergic therapy, there was chronic urine leak around the suprapubic catheter and per urethra. Therefore, the urethra was mobilised and closed. After closure of the urethra, there was no urine leak from the urethra, but urine leak persisted around the suprapubic catheter. Cystogram confirmed {{the presence of a}} Foley balloon inside the bladder; there was no urinary fistula. The Foley balloon ruptured frequently, leading to extrusion of the Foley catheter. X-ray of abdomen showed <b>heterotopic</b> <b>bone</b> formation bridging the gap across diastasis of symphysis pubis. CT of pelvis revealed <b>heterotopic</b> <b>bone</b> lying in close proximity to the balloon of the Foley catheter; the sharp edge of <b>heterotopic</b> <b>bone</b> probably acted like a saw and led to frequent rupture of the balloon of the Foley catheter. Unique features of this case are: (1) temporal relationship of <b>heterotopic</b> <b>bone</b> formation to suprapubic cystostomy and chronic urine leak; (2) occurrence of heterotopic ossification in pubic region; (3) complications of <b>heterotopic</b> <b>bone</b> formation viz. frequent rupture of the balloon of the Foley catheter by the irregular margin of <b>heterotopic</b> <b>bone</b> and difficulty in insertion of suprapubic catheter because the <b>heterotopic</b> <b>bone</b> encroached on the suprapubic track; (4) synostosis between pubic bones as a result of heterotopic ossification [...] Common aetiological factors for neurogenic, heterotopic ossification, such as forceful manipulation, trauma, or spasticity, were absent in this patient.

40|$|AbstractHuman {{bone marrow}} stromal cells (BMSCs, {{also known as}} bone marrow-derived “mesenchymal stem cells”) can {{establish}} the hematopoietic microenvironment within heterotopic ossicles generated by transplantation at non-skeletal sites. Here we show that non-mineralized cartilage pellets formed by hBMSCs ex vivo generate complete ossicles upon heterotopic transplantation {{in the absence of}} exogenous scaffolds. These ossicles display a remarkable degree of architectural fidelity, showing that an exogenous conductive scaffold is not an absolute requirement for bone formation by transplanted BMSCs. Marrow cavities within the ossicles include erythroid, myeloid and granulopoietic lineages, clonogenic hematopoietic progenitors and phenotypic HSCs, indicating that complete stem cell niches and hematopoiesis are established. hBMSCs (CD 146 + adventitial reticular cells) are established in the <b>heterotopic</b> chimeric <b>bone</b> marrow through a unique process of endochondral bone marrow formation, distinct from physiological endochondral bone formation. In this process, chondrocytes remain viable and proliferate within the pellet, are released from cartilage, and convert into bone marrow stromal cells. Once explanted in secondary culture, these cells retain phenotype and properties of skeletal stem cells (“MSCs”), including the ability to form secondary cartilage pellets and secondary ossicles upon serial transplantation. Ex vivo, hBMSCs initially induced to form cartilage pellets can be reestablished in adherent culture and can modulate gene expression between cartilage and stromal cell phenotypes. These data show that so-called “cartilage differentiation” of BMSCs in vitro is a reversible phenomenon, which is actually reverted, in vivo, to the effect of generating stromal cells supporting the homing of hematopoietic stem cells and progenitors...|$|R

40|$|The {{ability of}} {{skeletal}} stem cells (SSCs) to direct spinal fusion (SF) upon transplantation {{in conjunction with}} osteoconductive biomaterials was investigated in a rabbit model. When tested in a mouse heterotopic transplantation assay, rabbit SSCs and Pro-Osteon 500 R™ was osteoconductive and supported osteogenesis. When used in a SF model, the same constructs induced bone formation in periapophyseal regions (PARs). In this respect, they proved to be superior to grafts of cell-free carrier or total uncultured bone marrow-carrier constructs, used as controls. However, interapophyseal regions (IARs) remained devoid of new bone, such that true bony bridging of adjacent transverse apophyses (true SF) could not be achieved. Interestingly, this could not be predicted from high-resolution radiography. A systematic histological survey of the entire graft harvested at 6 months was essential for proper assessment of the transplantation procedure outcome. Immunohistochemical analysis of microvessel density revealed that IARs remained undervascularized, as compared to PARs, suggesting that differential vascularization {{could account for the}} absence or presence of new bone formation in the same regions. SF is an extreme model of stem cell-directed bone regeneration, requiring a combination of orthotopic (PAR) and <b>heterotopic</b> (IAR) <b>bone</b> formation. Our data show that, in this setting, graft size can be critical with respect to the necessary neovascularization, a crucial variable independent of proper osteogenic and osteoconductive competence of the cells and materials employed. Furthermore, stringent histological studies are mandatory for proper assessment of outcomes in SF studies, in which the use of mineralized materials can make radiographic assessment misleading.

40|$|Abstract. The {{predominant}} acid mucopolysaccharides {{found in}} selected epithelial mam-mary tumors of dogs stained with alcian blue and were labile to hyaluronidase digestion. These histochemical characteristics identified them as hyaluronic acid, chondroitin- 4 - and chondroitin- 6 -sulfate.

Experimental investigations on bone formation were employed to gain insight to the mechanism of NSAIDs action on bone. (I). Fifty-six patients with bilateral THAs were analyzed. We found {{a strong correlation between}} HO on the two sides. Incidence and grade of HO were higher in men than in women. (II). Sixty-nine patients with bilateral THAs who had been treated with NSAIDs after one or both THAs were analyzed for HO. Widespread HO occurred in untreated THAs, but in none of the treated THAs. (III). A consecutive series of THAs were analyzed for HO. No widespread HO occurred in patients treated with NSAIDs for 21 days. In contrast, widespread HO occurred in 23 % of patients not treated. (IV). A randomized, double-blind, prospective study on 144 patients was performed to determine the efficacy and minimum treatment time with Ibuprofen for prophylaxis of HO after THA. Treatment with Ibuprofen was effective for preventing HO and a treatment time of 8 days was sufficient. (V). A ten-year follow-up examination was performed on the patients from study IV. Thirteen patients had been revised. All but one belonged to groups treated with Ibuprofen. However, the prosthetic survival time was not statistically different for patients treated with NSAIDs compared to the control group. Eighty-four more patients underwent radiographic examination 10 years after THA. Nine loose prostheses were found. These were equally distributed between NSAIDs-treated and non-treated THAs.

Pre- and post-operative evaluation included clinical (Harris hip score (HHS), visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain) and radiological assessment (radiographs, quantitative CT) at a mean follow-up of 4 years (2 to 5. 5). A marked improvement of function (mean HHS increase of 49. 2) and decrease of pain level (mean VAS decrease of 5) as well as retention of the sphericity of the femoral head was noted in five hips at the latest follow-up, while signs of consolidation were apparent from the third post-operative month.

50|$|The {{concept of}} FAI was first {{described}} by Smith-Petersen. However, modern {{diagnosis and treatment}} of FAI was pioneered by Ganz in 2003, who initially advocated the use of an open surgical dislocation technique for treatment of intra-articular pathology. This involved the use of the 'trochanteric flip' approach {{to gain access to the}} hip joint. This is an extensive approach, needing an often large incision over the side of the hip, with the detachment of the greater trochanter of the femur and its attached musculature to gain access to the joint. By using this approach, the ball of the hip joint can be rotated out of the socket (termed 'surgical dislocation'), giving 360-degree access to the whole joint. This approach, although considered generally safe, carries with it inherent risks, which is the case with all large incision surgery. The risks of infection and blood clots are always present, and Ganz and his colleagues cite complications such as <b>heterotopic</b> ossification (new <b>bone</b> formation around the hip), nerve injuries, failure of the greater trochanter to heal back properly, persistent pain following the formation of scar tissue (adhesions) in the hip joint, and a small risk of damage of the blood supply to the femoral head. The patient usually needs to stay in hospital for a few days, and the post-operative rehabilitation after such extensive surgery can be prolonged. As a result, surgeons have looked to use the arthroscope more extensively in the hip joint in an attempt to avoid the possible pitfalls of large, open surgery. The perceived advantages of this are the avoidance of large scars, decreased blood loss, faster recovery periods and less pain. Hip arthroscopy can be performed as an outpatient procedure (i.e. no need to stay in hospital overnight).|$|R

40|$|Tissue Engineering is a {{scientific}} discipline {{that aims to}} regenerate tissues and organs that are diseased, lost or congenitally absent. It encompasses the use of suitable synthetic equivalents of native extracellular matrix {{that may or may}} not be supplemented with cells or relevant growth factors. Such scaffolds are designed to reside at the site of implantation for a variable period of time during which they induce the regeneration of native tissue. During this time, they also provide a template for new cells to attach, infiltrate, differentiate into appropriate phenotype and eventually restore function of the concerned tissue. Among the factors that affect the outcome are the composition of scaffold, methods of fabrication, bulk properties of the scaffold and topography and architecture at the cellular level. Bone is unique in the body in that it is one of the few tissues capable of complete regeneration even in adults, as seen during fracture healing. However, certain conditions (non-union of fractures, congenital and acquired bone deficiencies) exist in which the regenerative capacities of bone are exceeded and appropriate intervention becomes necessary. Current treatment options include autologous bone grafts harvested from iliac crest or de-cellularized allografts or synthetic substitutes made from metals, ceramics and polymers. However these options have serious limitations: while autografts are limited in supply, necessitate second surgery and show inadequate vascularization, allografts can transmit viral infections. Metals, ceramics and polymers are in essence structural replacements without performing any biological function. Other problems associated with these synthetic materials include adverse immune reactions, corrosion, stress-shielding and secondary fractures due to inadequate osseo-integration. Bone tissue engineering is a specialized field of research that provides an alternative strategy to repair bone defects by exploiting the advances in engineering and better understanding of bone biology. Scaffold-based tissue engineering approach is a promising field that involves implantation of a biomaterial that is specifically matched in terms of biological and material properties to the tissue it replaces. This study explores the feasibility of using electrospinning as a potential fabrication strategy for bone tissue engineering applications, more specifically intended for cleft palate repair. This model represents a congenital deformity that affects both hard and soft tissues and presents unique challenges and opportunities. Among the challenges are: the need for the implant allow growth of the most complex areas of the facial skeleton, integrate and grow with the patient through adolescence, the ability of the implant to not interfere with vital functions including breathing and feeding. Further the implant should provide a flexible matrix that can effectively support erupting teeth. In spite of these extreme demands, maxilla is a non load-bearing membranous bone, a favorable consideration from materials engineering perspective. The present study is organized into three independent sections. The first section investigates developing strategies intended to improve the material properties of electrospun bone scaffold. Bone is composed of a high volume fraction (50 %) of inorganic hydroxyapatite nanocrystals that is closely associated with collagen. The dispersal of brittle mineral is critical in not only strengthening the bone in compression but also contributes to the osteoconductivity of the matrix. Since loading of mineral in a bone scaffold is a serious limitation, we attempted to achieve improved loading of bone mineral by dual mineralization approach. We first incorporated nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite (nHA) directly into the scaffold by adding it to the electrospinning polymer solution. The second step involves inducing biomimetic mineralization of electrospun scaffolds by incubating them in simulated body fluid (SBF) for 2 weeks. The hypothesis was that the nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite seeded during electrospinning would act as sites for nucleation and further crystal growth when incubated in solution supersaturated with respect to calcium and phosphate ions. We tested this approach in two synthetic, biocompatible polymers-polydioxanone and poly (lactide: glycolide) and four formulations of SBF with differential loading of nHA (0 - 50 % by wt. of polymer). A modified Alizarin Red S (ARS) staining that specifically binds to calcium was developed that allowed us to quantify the mineral content of 3 D scaffold with great accuracy. Results indicated a unique combination of factors: PDO scaffolds containing 50 % nHA incubated in 1 x revised-SBF incubated under static conditions gave maximum mineralization over a period of two weeks. We then sought to exploit these findings to engineer a stiffer scaffold by stacking multiple layers together and cold welding them under high pressure. Electrospun scaffolds (1, 2 or 4 layered stacks) were either compressed before or after mineralizing treatment with SBF. After two weeks, scaffolds were analyzed for total mineral content and stiffness by uniaxial tensile testing. Results indicated while compression of multiple layers significantly increases the stiffness of scaffolds, it also had lower levels of mineralization partly due to increased density of fibers and loss of surface area due to fiber welding. However this can be offset to a reasonable degree by increasing the number of stacks and hence this strategy can be successfully adopted to improve the mechanical properties of electrospun scaffolds. The second section introduces a novel infrared imaging technique to quantify and characterize the biological activity of biomaterials, based on cell adhesion. Cells attach to the surface by the formation of focal contacts where multiple proteins including vinculin and talin assemble to signal critical processes like cell survival, migration, proliferation and differentiation. After allowing MG- 63 osteoblasts to adhere to 2 D biomaterial surface coated with extracellular matrix proteins (collagen, gelatin, fibronectin) cells were fixed and probed with antibodies for vinculin and talin. Secondary antibodies, tagged with infrared-sensitive fluorescent dyes, were used to quantify the molecules of interest. In addition, the kinetics of focal contact formation in these different substrates was followed. Successful quantification of focal contacts were made and further research revealed phosphorylation of vinculin at pY- 822 as one potential mechanism for recruitment of vinculin to focal contacts. Hence it could represent a subset of vinculin and might serve as a specific molecular marker for focal contacts. As an extension, we evaluated the possibility of using such an assay to quantify 3 D electrospun tissue engineering scaffolds. We fabricated scaffolds of graded biological activity by electrospinning blends of polydioxanone and collagen in different ratios. Vinculin and talin expressed by MG- 63 cultured on these scaffolds for 24 hours were quantified in a similar manner. Results indicate that while talin does not show a significant difference in expression among different scaffolds, vinculin showed a positive correlation with increasing biological activity of scaffolds. In conclusion, we have identified vinculin as a reliable marker of focal contacts in 3 D scaffolds while phosphovinculin (pY- 822) was more specific to focal contacts in coated 2 D substrates. In both instances, infrared imaging proved to be reliable in study of focal contacts. 	The third section aims to make the bone scaffolds osteoinductive- a property of a material to induce new bone formation even when implanted in subcutaneous and intramuscular <b>heterotopic</b> sites. <b>Bone</b> morphogenetic proteins (BMP) are potent cytokines that can induce migration, proliferation and differentiation of stem cells along osteoblastic lineage. The therapeutic efficacy of BMPs in the treatment of severe bone defects has been identified and is currently FDA approved for specific orthopedic applications. BMPs are clinically administered in a buffer form that not only makes the treatment expensive but less effective. Suitable delivery systems for BMP delivery have been an intense area of investigation. We rationalized electrospinning as a strategy to incorporate BMP within the scaffold and that would enable controlled release when implanted. One of the drawbacks of using electrospinning to deliver bioactive molecules is the potential denaturing effect and eventual loss of activity of BMPs. The final section of this dissertation tries to develop sensitive and relevant assays that could answer intriguing questions about solvent-protein interaction. We chose to use the BMP- 2 / 7 heterodimer as the osteoinductive molecule of choice because of its superior potency compared to homodimer counterparts. We characterized the detection and quantification of BMP- 2 / 7 using a slot blot technique. Further, we used a novel cell line (C 2 C 12 BRA) to test the retention of activity of BMP- 2 / 7 that has been exposed to organic solvents. Results indicate significant loss of activity when BMPs are exposed to organic solvents but complete recovery was possible by diluting the solvent with an aqueous buffer...|$|R
