5|$|Drainage of the Colorado Plateau was {{significantly}} altered by {{the opening of}} the Gulf of California. Rifting tore Baja California Peninsula northwestward from the Mexican mainland starting some 10 to 5mya. The ancestral Colorado River responded to the regional downwarping by taking a shortcut to the sea by <b>flowing</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> new gulf. This significantly decreased the distance from the river's headwaters and its delta at the sea. Water in the Colorado and its tributaries moved faster as a result and cut down deeper, creating the canyonland topography.|$|E

5|$|Roaring Brook has a {{high level}} of water quality {{downstream}} as far as Cobbs Gap. However, in its lower reaches, it is impacted by urban storm impacts and abandoned mining land. Silt from the DeNaples Auto Parts property washed into the stream in 1991. There are also stormwater impacts and combined sewer overflows in its lower reaches. Most of the stormwater <b>flowing</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> stream is associated with a combined sewer system in Scranton and Dunmore. Some highways in the watershed contribute stormwater as well. It is also affected by stormwater from the Daleville Shopping area, the village of Elmhurst, the borough of Moscow, Pennsylvania Route 435, Pennsylvania Route 590, and Pennsylvania Route 690. There are 12 stormwater detention facilities in the watershed's lower reaches.|$|E
5|$|The Santa Ana River {{watershed}} shares boundaries {{with many}} adjacent river basins. In the northwest is the San Gabriel River, which empties into the Pacific at Long Beach. In Orange County, the San Diego Creek, Aliso Creek, and San Juan Creek watersheds border the Santa Ana watershed on the south. Further south, in San Diego County, the watershed is bordered {{by those of}} San Mateo Creek, the Santa Margarita River, and the San Luis Rey River. On the east the watershed shares borders {{with those of the}} Whitewater River and the Coachella Valley, <b>flowing</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Salton Sea, and on the north with the Mojave River, which flows into the endorheic basin of the Mojave Desert.|$|E
5|$|The {{current flowing}} from the {{ionosphere}} to the plasma sheet is especially strong when the corresponding part of the plasma sheet rotates slower than the planet. As mentioned above, co-rotation breaks down in the region located between 20 and 40RJ from Jupiter. This region corresponds to the magnetodisk, where the magnetic field is highly stretched. The strong direct current <b>flowing</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> magnetodisk originates in a very limited latitudinal range of about ° from the Jovian magnetic poles. These narrow circular regions correspond to Jupiter's main auroral ovals. (See below.) The return current {{flowing from the}} outer magnetosphere beyond 50RJ enters the Jovian ionosphere near the poles, closing the electrical circuit. The total radial current in the Jovian magnetosphere is estimated at 60 million–140million amperes.|$|E

5|$|Chinese Muslim traders {{from the}} eastern coast of China arrived at the coastal towns of Indonesia and Malaysia in the early 15th century. They were led by the mariner Zheng He, who {{commanded}} several expeditions to southeastern Asia between 1405 and 1430. In the book Yingya Shenglan, his translator Ma Huan documented {{the activities of the}} Chinese Muslims in the archipelago and the legacy left by Zheng He and his men. These traders settled along the northern coast of Java, but there is no documentation of their settlements beyond the 16th century. The Chinese Muslims were likely to have been absorbed into the majority Muslim population. Between 1450 and 1520, the Ming Dynasty's interest in southeastern Asia reached a low point and trade, both legal and illegal, rarely reached the archipelago. The Portuguese made no mention of any resident Chinese minority population when they arrived in Indonesia in the early 16th century. Trade from the north was re-established when China legalized private trade in 1567 through licensing 50 junks a year. Several years later silver began <b>flowing</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> region, from Japan, Mexico, and Europe, and trade flourished once again. Distinct Chinese colonies emerged in hundreds of ports throughout southeastern Asia, including the pepper port of Banten.|$|E
5|$|Hong Kong is the world's {{eleventh}} largest trading entity, {{with the}} total value of imports and exports exceeding its gross domestic product. It is the world's largest re-export centre. Much of Hong Kong's exports consist of re-exports, which are products made outside of the territory, especially in mainland China, and distributed via Hong Kong. Its physical location has allowed the city to establish a transportation and logistics infrastructure that includes the world's second busiest container port and the world's busiest airport for international cargo. Even before the transfer of sovereignty, Hong Kong had established extensive trade and investment ties with the mainland, which now enable it to serve as a point of entry for investment <b>flowing</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> mainland. At the end of 2007, there were 3.46million people employed full-time, with the unemployment rate averaging 4.1% for the fourth straight year of decline. Hong Kong's economy is dominated by the service sector, which accounts for over 90% of its GDP, while industry constitutes 9%. Inflation was at 2.5% in 2007. Hong Kong's largest export markets are mainland China, the United States, and Japan.|$|E
5|$|The Weald Clay {{formation}} {{consists of}} sediments of Hauterivian (Lower Weald Clay) to Barremian (Upper Weald Clay) in age, about 130–125 million years old. The B.walkeri holotype {{was found in}} the latter, in clay representing non-marine still water, which has been interpreted as a fluvial or mudflat environment with shallow water, lagoons, and marsh. During the Early Cretaceous, the Weald area of Surrey, Sussex, and Kent was partly covered by the large, fresh-to-brackish water Wealden Lake. Two large rivers drained the northern area (where London now stands), <b>flowing</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> lake through a river delta; the Anglo-Paris Basin was in the south. Its climate was sub-tropical, similar to the present Mediterranean region. Since the Smokejacks Pit consists of different stratigraphic levels, fossil taxa found there are not necessarily contemporaneous. Dinosaurs from the locality include the ornithopods Mantellisaurus, Iguanodon, and small sauropods. Other vertebrates include sharks (such as Hybodus), bony fishes (including Scheenstia), crocodiles, and pterosaurs. Members of ten orders of insects have been identified, including Valditermes, Archisphex, and Pterinoblattina. Other invertebrates include ostracods, isopods, conchostracans, and bivalves. The plants Weichselia and the aquatic, herbaceous Bevhalstia were common. Other plants found include ferns, horsetails, club mosses, and conifers.|$|E

Continued sulphur dioxide emissions at the eruption sites prompted concerns about air quality in urban areas in eastern Iceland.

Forecast scenarios now included references to possible further subsidence in the caldera prompting eruptions beneath the Dyngjujökull glacier.|$|E
