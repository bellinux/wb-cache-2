40|$|Abstract. The {{testing method}} for {{detecting}} cement paste agglomeration is investigated. Furthermore, the procedure and feasibility are also discussed. Paste agglomeration is an abnormal phenomenon of part hydration {{along with many}} granules forming. Base on measurement of cement setting time, needle-penetration method is used to check the degree of agglomeration by vicat apparatus. Through researching the influence of cement fineness, content of gypsum and hydrating time on amount of agglomeration, the dependability, reproducibility and <b>enantiotropy</b> of this method are analyzed. The {{results show that the}} variation laws of paste agglomeration could be reflected by needle-penetration method effectively, and this method is easy to be carried out. There are better reproducibility and <b>enantiotropy,</b> and this method be used to study the mechanism of agglomeration...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA {{calibration}} {{strategy for}} the continuous monitoring of solvent-mediated phase transition was developed using in situ Raman spectroscopy. Citric acid which exhibits <b>enantiotropy</b> during its anhydrous/monohydrate phase transition was selected as a model organic product. Using 25 samples in suspension, specific calibration of the spectral data was obtained for estimating in-line both the overall solid concentration in suspension and {{the composition of the}} solid phase. In addition to such key-measurements, reliable estimates of supersaturation were computed in-line from the mass balance of the solute. In order to validate the technique, anhydrous to monohydrate phase transition experiments were performed in suspensions at 15 degrees C and the kinetic process involved was monitored. Despite the use of various solid concentrations and reactor configurations, both the reproducibility and the reliability of the in situ Raman measurements are shown to be satisfactory...|$|E
40|$|Understanding the {{polymorphic}} {{behavior of}} active pharmaceutical ingredients {{is important for}} formulation purposes and regulatory reasons. Metacetamol is an isomer of paracetamol and it similarly exhibits polymorphism. In the present article, {{it has been found}} that one of the polymorphs of metacetamol is only stable under increased pressure, which has led to the conclusion that metacetamol like paracetamol is a monotropic system under ordinary (= laboratory) conditions and that it becomes enantiotropic under pressure with the I-II-L triple point coordinates for metacetamol TI-II-L = 535 ± 10 K and PI-II-L = 692 ± 70 MPa. However, whereas for paracetamol the <b>enantiotropy</b> under pressure can be foreseen, because the metastable polymorph is denser, in the case of metacetamol this is not possible, as the metastable polymorph is less dense than the stable one. The existence of the stability domain for the less dense polymorph of metacetamol can only be demonstrated by the construction of the topological phase diagram as presented in this article. It is a delicate interplay between the specific volume differences and the enthalpy differences causing the stability domain of the less dense polymorph to be sandwiched between the denser polymorph and the liquid. Metacetamol shares this behavior with bicalutamide and fluoxetine nitrate. Peer ReviewedPreprin...|$|E
