2500|$|An unrepentant lifelong doodler and sketcher, Saint-Exupéry had {{for many}} years sketched little people on his napkins, tablecloths, letters to paramours and friends, lined {{notebooks}} and other scraps of paper. Early figures took on a multitude of appearances, engaged {{in a variety of}} tasks. Some appeared as doll-like figures, baby puffins, angels with wings, and even a figure similar to that in Robert Crumb's later famous Keep On Truckin' of 1968. In a 1940 letter to a friend he sketched a character with his own thinning hair, sporting a bow tie, viewed as a boyish alter-ego, and he later gave a similar doodle to Elizabeth Reynal at his New York publisher's office. Most often the diminutive figure was expressed as [...] "...a slip of a boy with a turned up nose, lots of hair, long baggy pants that were too short for him and with a long scarf that whipped in the wind. Usually the boy had a puzzled expression... his boy Saint-Exupéry came to think of as [...] "the little prince," [...] and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>usually</b> found <b>standing</b> on top of a tiny planet. Most of the time he was alone, sometimes walking up a path. Sometimes there was a single flower on the planet." [...] His characters were frequently seen chasing butterflies; when asked why they did so, Saint-Exupéry, who thought of the figures as his alter-egos, replied that they were actually pursuing a [...] "realistic ideal". Saint-Exupéry eventually settled on the image of the young, precocious child with curly blond hair, an image which would become the subject of speculations as to its source. [...] One [...] "most striking" [...] illustration depicted the pilot-narrator asleep beside his stranded plane prior to the prince's arrival. Although images of the narrator were created for the story, none survived Saint-Exupéry's editing process.|$|R
