It emphasizes accountability rather than profitability, and is used by Nonprofit organizations and by governments. In this method, a fund consists of a self-balancing set of accounts and each are reported as either unrestricted, temporarily restricted or permanently restricted based on the provider-imposed restrictions.|$|E

40|$|Recent studies {{offer an}} {{ambiguous}} {{picture on the}} effectiveness of foreign aid in strengthening the export capacity of recipient countries. Moreover, the literature on aid for trade (AfT) has often neglected that exporters in the donor countries may be among the main beneficiaries. We hypothesize that AfT is as much in the self-interest of donor countries as it may have promoted the exports of recipient countries. We simultaneously estimate and compare the effects of AfT on trade in both directions. We find that AfT increases recipient exports to donors as well as recipient imports from donors. The first effect tends to dominate the latter, which contradicts the skeptical view that <b>donors</b> <b>grant</b> AfT primarily to promote their own export interests...|$|R

Generally, not-forprofit organizations, funded by government and <b>donor</b> <b>grants</b> have {{played a significant role}} in poverty alleviation. We argue that, by applying entrepreneurial concepts, organizations can create social value, hence mitigate poverty. This is a theoretical paper that builds upon a multidimensional model in analysing how three social enterprises from India and Kenya create social value to address social problems. The findings suggest that whilst the social mission is central to all these organizations, they also create social value through innovation and pro-activeness. Additionally, the cultural and political environmental contexts hinder their attempt to create social value. Building networks and partnerships to achieve social value creation is vital for these organizations. Policy makers should devise policies that would assist social enterprises to achieve development goals...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This article {{examines}} {{the changes that have}} taken place since the mid- 2000 s in the donor agenda in Kyrgyzstan, and what implications these changes have had for Kyrgyzstani NGOs. It uses two-stage longitudinal research. The findings reveal that donors changed their priorities after the mid- 2000 s by closing the civil society building programmes and grants they initiated in the 1990 s. Donors now prioritize promoting NGOs in advocacy roles for policy reform. Interviewed NGOs reported that <b>donor</b> <b>grants</b> had decreased, aggravating the existing competition for donor funding among NGOs. This article suggests {{that as a result of}} these changes NGOs that are organizationally and professionally stronger are in a better position to obtain funding and, thus, continue their work. The research findings also indicate that some NGOs expanded their funding sources between 2008 and 2016...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Cloud {{computing}} is {{a technology}} that provides on demand services to the users for deploying their computational needs in a virtualized environment without the knowledge of technical setup.

The cloud service <b>donors</b> <b>grant</b> the services to the registered cloud users on payment basic through the gage. The cloud facilities are basically classified as SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS. The facilities are accessible to the users depending on cloud deployment and the SLA (service level agreements) between the service providers and the users.

40|$|On a {{worldwide}} basis, microfinance institutions (MFIs) provide financial {{services to the}} poorest households.

There is a subset of the pool of mainstream equity investors who would consider investing in MFI opportunities, even knowing that they would not expect to earn the full economic rate of return that such investments would otherwise require.

40|$|Background: Health care {{expenditure}} {{has been}} {{low over the}} years in developing regions of the world. A majority of countries in these regions, especially sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), rely on <b>donor</b> <b>grants</b> and loans to finance health care. Such expenditures are not only unsustainable but also inadequate considering the enormous health care burden in the region. The objectives of this study are to determine the effect of health care expenditure on population health status and to examine the effect by public and private expenditure sources. Methods: The study used panel data from 1995 to 2010 covering 44 countries in SSA. Fixed and random effects panel data regression models were fitted {{to determine the effects of}} health care expenditure on health outcomes. Results: The results show that health care expenditure significantly influences health status through improving life expectancy at birth, reducing death and infant mortality rates. Both public and private health care spending showed strong positive association with health status even though public health care spending had relatively higher impact. Conclusion: The findings imply that health care expenditure remains a crucial component of health status improvement in sub-Saharan African countries. Increasing health care expenditure will be a significant step in achieving the Millennium Development Goals. Further, policy makers need to establish effective public-private partnership in allocating health care expenditures...|$|R

40|$|Abstract [...] . Even though {{eliminating}} malaria {{from the}} endemic margins {{is a part}} of the Global Malaria Action Plan, little guidance exists on what resources are needed to transition from controlling malaria to eliminating it. Using Philippines as an example, this study aimed to (1) estimate the financial resources used by sub-national malaria programs in different phases during elimination and (2) understand how different environmental and organizational factors may influence expenditure levels and spending proportions. The Philippines provides an opportunity to study variations in sub-national programs because its epidemiological and ecological diversity, devolved health system, and progressive elimination strategy all allow greater flexibility for lower-level governments to direct activities, but also create challenges for coordination and resource mobilization. Through key informant interviews and archival record retrieval in four selected provinces chosen based on eco-epidemiological variation, expenditures associated with provincial malaria programs were collected for selected years (mid- 1990 s to 2010). Results show that expenditures per person at risk per year decrease as programs progress from a state of controlled low-endemic malaria to elimination to prevention of reintroduction regardless of whether elimination was deliberately planned. However, wide variation across provinces were found: expenditures were generally higher if mainly financed with <b>donor</b> <b>grants,</b> but were moderated by the level of economic development, the level of malaria transmission and receptivity, and the capacity of program staff. Across all provinces, strong leadership appears to be a necessar...|$|R
