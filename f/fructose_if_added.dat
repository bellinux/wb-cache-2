Cell-free enzyme studies showed that mannitol was synthesized via the reduction of fructose- 6 -phosphate and not by the direct reduction of <b>fructose.</b> <b>If</b> the cell yield from glucose {{was assumed to be}} 50 % and the theoretical conversion efficiency from glucose to polyols was 90 %, as calculated from the energy balance, then 34 % of the glucose carbon was used for growth and 53 % was used for polyol formation...|$|R
