Here we seek to collate and examine the evidence for long range surface forces in ionic liquids, identify key outstanding questions, and explore possible mechanisms underlying the origin of these long range forces.

However, {{the position of}} Cu in Bi 0. 5 Sb 1. 5 Te 3 is controversial, and the roles of Cu in the enhancement of thermoelectric performance are still not clear. In this study, via defects analysis and stability test, the possibility of Cu intercalation in p-type Bi 0. 5 Sb 1. 5 Te 3 materials has been excluded, and the position of Cu is identified as doping at the Sb sites. Additionally, the effects of Cu dopants on the electrical and thermal transport properties have been systematically investigated.

For monovalent cations, the pore wall charge deduced from pore conductivity measurements yielded theoretical predictions for the streaming potential and for the concentration potential that gree quite well with the data. Such agreement was not obtained with Mg 2 +, probably because these divalent cations adsorbed onto the negative pore wall.

40|$|Liquid dispersions of {{colloidal}} particles {{play a big}} role in nature and as industrial products or intermediates. Their material properties are largely determined by the liquid-mediated particle-particle interaction. In water-based systems, electric charge is ubiquitous and electrostatic particle interaction often is the primary factor in stabilizing dispersions against decomposition by aggregation and sedimentation. Very nonpolar liquids, by contrast, are usually considered free of charge, because their low dielectric constant raises the electrostatic cost of separating opposite charges above the available thermal energy. Defying this conventional wisdom, nonpolar solutions of certain ionic surfactants do support mobile ions and surface charges. Even some nonionic surfactants have recently been found to raise the conductivity of nonpolar oils and promote surface charging of suspended particles, but this counter-intuitive behavior is not yet widely acknowledged, nor is the mechanism of charging understood. The present study provides the first characterization of the electrostatic particle interaction caused by nonionizable surfactants in nonpolar oils. The methods used in this study are video microscopy experiments where particle positions of equilibrium ensembles are obtained and translated into particle interactions. Experimentally, equilibrium particle positions are monitored by digital video microscopy, and subjected to liquid structure analysis in order to find the energy of interaction between two particles. The observed interaction energy profiles agree well with a screened-Coulomb potential, thus confirming the presence of both surface charge and mobile ions in solution. In contrast to recently reported electrostatic particle interactions induced by ionic surfactants in nonpolar solution, the present study finds evidence of charge screening both above and below the surfactant's critical micelle concentration, CMC. Fitted <b>Debye</b> <b>screening</b> <b>lengths</b> are much larger than in aqueous systems, but similar to the Debye length in nonpolar oils reported for micellar solutions of ionic surfactants cite{hsu_charge_ 2005 }.

The measured electrostatic forces and fitted surface potentials are fairly substantial and easily capable of stabilizing colloidal dispersions.
