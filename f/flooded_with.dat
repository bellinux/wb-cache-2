5|$|The American white ibis {{is found}} {{in a variety of}} habitats, {{although}} shallow coastal marshes, wetlands and mangrove swamps are preferred. It is also commonly found in muddy pools, on mudflats and even wet lawns. Populations that are away from the coast and shoreline, particularly in southern Florida, often reside in other forms of wetlands such as marshes, ponds and flooded fields. In summer, these move to more coastal and estuarine habitats as inland waterways become <b>flooded</b> <b>with</b> summer rains and the ibis find the water levels too deep to forage effectively.|$|E

Between 1878 and 1884, the population of Chinese laborers in Hawaii tripled.|$|E
