40|$|The diploma work {{focuses on}} the subject of the <b>high</b> <b>demands</b> placed on the {{profession}} of nursery school teachers. The aim and meaning of the dissertation is to point out and prove how <b>high</b> these <b>demands</b> are. The theoretical part of the work explains the terms profession, teaching profession and the <b>high</b> <b>demands</b> placed on the work of a teacher through the variegated activities applied; and the changes that took place in this profession during the past development stages of society. It analyses the role the nursery school teacher plays in contemporary times due to the changes in society and legislation, which have brought even <b>higher</b> <b>demands</b> made on this profession. The research section contains evaluations of the <b>high</b> <b>demands</b> on the profession compiled by nursery teachers themselves. This part analyses the possibilities of further education to prepare the teachers for the new demands in practice. The opinions of the public concerning the work duties of nursery school teachers are evaluated. Powered by TCPDF (www. tcpdf. org...|$|R

We have developed a world inputoutput table to investigate the way in which New Zealand and Australia depend on the rest of the world, and to look at the role of demand in China, Japan, the US, and the euro area.

We highlight the impact of US demand on other economies and demonstrate the importance of Chinese and Australian demand on New Zealand. ...|$|R
