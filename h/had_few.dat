5|$|A {{little before}} 16:00, Ney noted an {{apparent}} exodus from Wellington's centre. He mistook {{the movement of}} casualties to the rear for {{the beginnings of a}} retreat, and sought to exploit it. Following the defeat of d'Erlon's Corps, Ney <b>had</b> <b>few</b> infantry reserves left, as most of the infantry had been committed either to the futile Hougoumont attack or to the defence of the French right. Ney therefore tried to break Wellington's centre with cavalry alone.|$|E
5|$|After its {{ratification}} of the Thirteenth Amendment in November 1865, the South Carolina legislature immediately began to legislate Black Codes. The Black Codes created a separate set of laws, punishments, and acceptable behaviors for anyone {{with more than one}} black great-grandparent. Under these Codes, Blacks could only work as farmers or servants and <b>had</b> <b>few</b> Constitutional rights. Restrictions on black land ownership threatened to make economic subservience permanent.|$|E

5|$|At Banagher, {{there are}} ridges {{on both sides}} of the river and roads were built along these many centuries ago. The first bridge was built over the Shannon at that point as early as 1049. It was a place of great {{strategic}} importance because the Shannon and its lowlands provided a natural barrier between Connacht and Leinster. An army that wanted to cross the river <b>had</b> <b>few</b> choices; apart from Banagher, the only other suitable places were Athlone, Shannonbridge and Portumna.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{geographic}} isolation of their homeland, the Hupa <b>had</b> <b>few</b> interactions with early European explorers, although they later came {{in conflict with}} miners looking for gold. Even after California became a US state in 1850, the Hupa continued to live on their traditional lands and were eventually granted a reservation here in 1876. They are the only Native American group in California to retain most of their original territory; today, the Hoopa Valley Reservation is {{the largest and most}} populous in the state.|$|E
5|$|Booth had a low key {{season in}} 195556, {{struggling}} to find a regular position in the New South Wales team. As there were no international matches during the summer, the Test players were available for the whole campaign. He played in six matches and <b>had</b> <b>few</b> opportunities, managing only 157 runs at 31.40, passing fifty on only one occasion. New South Wales went on to claim a hat-trick of Sheffield Shield titles.|$|E

5|$|Bradman rotated the two glovemen {{during the}} tour, and Saggers played in 17 of the 31 {{first-class}} matches, taking 23 catches and 20 stumpings. Due to Australia's powerful batting line-up, Saggers <b>had</b> <b>few</b> opportunities with the bat, scoring 209 runs {{at an average}} of 23.22, including his only century at first-class level, 104 not out against Essex.|$|E
5|$|During {{the long}} period of peace between 1815 and 1846 midshipmen <b>had</b> <b>few</b> {{opportunities}} for promotion, and their warrants were often obtained via patronage. The poor quality of officer training in the US Navy became visible after the Somers Affair, an alleged mutiny aboard the training ship USS Somers in 1842, and the subsequent execution of midshipman Philip Spencer. Spencer had gained his post aboard the Somers via the influence of his father, United States Secretary of War John C. Spencer.|$|E
5|$|Enlisted sailors {{during this}} time {{included}} many foreign-born men, and native-born Americans were usually social outcasts who <b>had</b> <b>few</b> other employment options or {{they were trying to}} escape punishment for crimes. In 1835, almost 3,000men sailed with merchant ships out of Boston harbor, but only 90men were recruited by the Navy. It was unlawful for black men to serve in the Navy, but the shortage of men was so acute this law was frequently ignored.|$|E

No.79 Wing's light and medium bombers {{suffered from a}} lack of suitable targets as they <b>had</b> <b>few</b> airfields in forward areas from which to refuel. No.2 Squadron returned to operations with Mitchells in June. That month, No.18 Squadron flew 149 sorties, damaging Japanese airfields and shipping in the Timor area, but lost its commanding officer to anti-aircraft fire during a raid.|$|E

5|$|Industrial Light & Magic's (ILM) Colin Cantwell {{created the}} concept model that {{established}} the TIE fighter's ball-cockpit and hexagonal panels design for Star Wars (1977).

5|$|The City of London <b>had</b> <b>few</b> open spaces, and the {{proposal}} {{to build on the}} north of the park was extremely unpopular with local residents, workers and social reformers. Henry Fitzalan-Howard, the Postmaster-General, persuaded the Government to contribute £5,000 towards the cost, and the clergy of St Botolph's Aldersgate launched an appeal in The Times for the remaining funds.|$|E
5|$|The Maya <b>had</b> <b>few</b> {{domestic}} animals; {{dogs were}} domesticated by 3000 BC, and the Muscovy duck by the Late Postclassic. Ocellated turkeys were unsuitable for domestication, but were rounded {{up in the}} wild and penned for fattening. All of these were used as food animals; dogs were additionally used for hunting. It is possible that deer were also penned and fattened.|$|E

5|$|The battle {{resulted}} {{in the loss of}} the German torpedo boat squadron and prevented the mining of busy shipping lanes, such as the mouth of the River Thames. The British <b>had</b> <b>few</b> casualties and little damage to their vessels. The battle influenced the tactics and deployments of the remaining German torpedo boat flotillas in the North Sea area, as the loss shook the faith of their commanders in the effectiveness of the force.|$|E
5|$|The episode <b>had</b> <b>few</b> {{negative}} consequences. In 1908 Vizzini {{was able}} to acquire {{a substantial part of}} the Belici estate when he brokered a deal between the owner, the duke Francesco Thomas de Barberin who resided in Paris, and the local rural bank Cassa Rurale, whose president, the priest Scarlata, was Vizzini’s uncle. Vizzini held 290 hectares for himself and generously left the rest to the bank to lease out to Catholic peasants.|$|E
5|$|Although fortifications {{could still}} be {{valuable}} in times of war, they had played only a limited role during the Wars of the Roses and, when Henry VII invaded and seized the throne in 1485, he had not needed to besiege any castles or towns during the campaign. Henry rapidly consolidated his rule at home and <b>had</b> <b>few</b> reasons to fear an external invasion from the continent; he invested little in coastal defences {{over the course of}} his reign. Modest fortifications existed along the coasts, based around simple blockhouses and towers, primarily in the south-west and along the Sussex coast, with a few more impressive works in the north of England, but they were very limited in scale.|$|E
