25|$|Amstrad {{was founded}} in 1968 by Alan Sugar {{at the age of}} 21, the name of the {{original}} company being AMS Trading (Amstrad) Limited, derived from its founder's initials (Alan Michael Sugar). Amstrad entered the market in the field of consumer electronics. During the 1970s they were at the forefront of low-priced hi-fi, TV and car stereo cassette technologies. Lower prices were achieved by <b>injection</b> <b>moulding</b> <b>plastic</b> hi-fi turntable covers, undercutting competitors who used the vacuum forming process.|$|E

The optimum gate location improves quality and avoids products defects. This paper presents an investigation {{for the effects of}} gate location on product quality in <b>injection</b> <b>moulding.</b> <b>Plastic</b> advisor, simulation software embedded in Pro/Engineer package has been used for flow analysis of plastic product for selected gate locations. It has been shown that optimum gate location improves cooling quality resulting in a better product quality.

40|$|In {{engineering}} systems, {{early detection}} of the occurrence of faults is critical in avoiding product defects. This problematic is here discussed {{in the framework of}} an industrial process, namely, an <b>injection</b> <b>moulding</b> <b>plastic</b> machine. The relationships between the process state and the product quality are achieved through Principal Component Analysis. After having identified the main variables, two neural network architectures were investigated, TDNN and Elman networks, with respect to one-step ahead prediction. The results show that TDNN exhibited lower training times with respect to a desired performance criteria. However, for time series in which temporal dependency is large, the recurrent networks with time delayed inputs could lead to better results. 1 Introduction Neural networks have achieved, in recent years, a high degree of importance. The availability of process control computers as well as data historians made it easy to develop neural network solutions for process modeling [...] ...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{semantic}} interoperability of information {{has become increasingly}} important in Product Development Process (PDP) to support different phases during the product development. This article presents a proposal of an Interoperable Product Design and Manufacturing System (IPDMS) concept based {{on a set of}} engineering domain ontologies and sematic mapping approaches. The concept explores the potentials of semantic well-defined core-foundations in a Semantic Web ontology language. The formal core-foundations can be specialised to perform application view in Product or Manufacturing Model. The application view is used to support the information sharing between product design and manufacturing and verify the accordance with product requirements. A preliminary experimental has been realised, using a test case to share information from the design to manufacturing of an <b>injection</b> <b>moulding</b> <b>plastic.</b> As results, it was identified potential benefits and limitations.

500|$|The Sovereign {{was unusual}} because the casing {{was made from}} pressed steel, which gave it a much higher quality feel {{compared}} to <b>injection</b> <b>moulded</b> <b>plastic.</b> This allowed a variety of paint and plating options, including black painted, chrome-plated, silver-plated, and gold-plated, and a limited edition silver-plated version, inscribed to commemorate the Silver Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II in 1977, were also produced.

50|$|Several {{materials}} {{are used for}} housings. <b>Injection</b> <b>moulded</b> <b>plastics</b> are most popular for the low end {{and some of the}} more powerful lights produced in large quantities. Low volume products and home built lights are generally machined from aluminium alloy or high grade engineering plastics such as acetal (Delrin), or occasionally stainless steel, brass or bronze. Lenses (ports) are usually high grade transparent plastic or toughened glass. O-ring seals are standard for sealing joints and connections and for sealing penetrations through the watertight housing for switch controls.|$|R

40|$|Effective {{cooling channel}} {{design in the}} mould is {{important}} because it not only affects cycle time but also quality of the <b>injection</b> <b>moulded</b> <b>plastic</b> part. A good cooling system design can reduce cycle time and achieve dimensional stability of the part which will consequently produce better quality part. This paper describes a new square sectioned conformal cooling channel system for <b>injection</b> <b>moulding.</b> Both simulation and experimental verification have been done with these new cooling channels system. Comparative analysis has been done for an industrial part, a plastic bowl, with conventional cooling channels using the Moldflow simulation software. Experimental verification has been done for a test plastic part with mini <b>injection</b> <b>moulding</b> machine. Comparative results are presented based on temperature distribution on mould surface, cooling time or freezing time of the plastic part and hardness number of the plastic part. Results provide a uniform temperature distribution and hardness number with reduced freezing time of the plastic part...|$|R

40|$|The {{process cycle}} time in <b>injection</b> <b>moulding</b> process depends greatly on the cooling {{time of the}} plastic part, which is {{facilitated}} by the cooling channels in the <b>injection</b> <b>mould.</b> Effective cooling channel design in the mould {{is important because it}} not only affects cycle time but also the part quality. Traditional cooling channels are normally made of straight drilled holes in the mould, which have limitations in geometric complexity as well as cooling fluid mobility within the injectio n mould. Over the years, conformal cooling techniques are being introduced as effective alternative to conventional cooling. The main objective {{of this study is to}} determine an optimum design for conformal cooling channel of an <b>injection</b> <b>moulded</b> <b>plastic</b> part using finite element analysis and thermal heat transfer analysis. The part cooling time is optimized by conformal cooling channels in the mould using the ANSYS thermal a nalysis software. Analysis of virtual models showed that those with conformal cooling channels predicted a significant reduction of cycle time with expected improvement in part quality...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} aspects of <b>mould</b> design in <b>injection</b> <b>moulding</b> is the provision of suitable and adequate cooling arrangements. Proper cooling channel design in the mould is an important aspect as it affects cycle time and quality of the <b>injection</b> <b>moulded</b> <b>plastic</b> part. A new cooling channel design with copper tube insert can reduce cycle time by optimal and uniform heat transfer in the mould. In this research work a comprehensive FEA transient thermal-structural analysis has been performed with ANSYS simulation software to understand robustness and longevity of an industrial <b>plastic</b> part <b>mould</b> with these cooling channels and compared with conventional straight cooling channels. Autodesk Moldflow Insight (AMI) also has been used to get essential process parameter values for analysis. Result shows that by inserting copper tube in the cooling channels, a mould can increase cooling efficiency and can last for higher number of cycles before fatigue failure, thus increasing production rate...|$|R
