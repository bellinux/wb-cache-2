5|$|When {{not in a}} dungeon, Link {{explores the}} overworld. In Seasons, the overworld {{consists}} of Holodrum and the subterranean world of Subrosia. The two worlds are linked by several portals. In Ages, Link travels between present-day Labrynna and the past, connected by Time Holes. In either game, some areas of one world are accessible only from portals from the other and vice versa. Holodrum, Subrosia, and Labrynna contain optional side quests and upgrades for Link and his equipment. One such side quest is ring collection; rings provide Link with various bonuses and abilities, such as improved defense. Some rings <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> practical uses, e.g. rings that weaken Link's attack or defense, or transform Link into an enemy creature, or are awarded when certain criteria are met but <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> effect. Another side quest is the optional trading game, in which Link receives and delivers special items to certain people throughout the land. Once completed, Link receives an upgraded sword.|$|E
5|$|Critics chastised Stewart for not {{conducting}} sufficiently hard-hitting {{interviews with}} his political guests, {{some of whom}} he may have lampooned in previous segments. Stewart and other Daily Show writers responded to such criticism by saying that they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> journalistic responsibility and that as comedians their only duty is to provide entertainment. Stewart's appearance on the CNN show Crossfire picked up this debate, where he chastised the CNN production and hosts for not conducting informative and current interviews on a news network.|$|E

5|$|Epiphenomenalism is a {{doctrine}} first formulated by Thomas Henry Huxley. It {{consists of the}} view that mental phenomena are causally ineffectual, where one or more mental states <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> influence on physical states or mental phenomena are the effects, but not the causes, of physical phenomena. Physical events can cause other physical events and physical events can cause mental events, but mental events cannot cause anything, since they are just causally inert by-products (i.e. epiphenomena) of the physical world. This view has been defended most strongly in recent times by Frank Jackson.|$|E

The attribution in certain quarters of such a wish to the judiciary is misconceived and appears to be the product of lack of understanding of the judicial function and the sources of law which the courts are bound to apply.|$|E

5|$|Demerits: However, competencies, {{efficiency}} and effectiveness can be unclear and contradictory, especially {{when dealing with}} oversimplified matters. In a dehumanized bureaucracy, inflexible in distributing the job-scope, with every worker having to specialize from day one without rotating tasks for fear of decreasing output, tasks are often routine and can contribute to boredom. Thus, employees can sometimes {{feel that they are}} not part of the organization's work vision and missions. Consequently, they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> sense of belonging in the long term. Furthermore, this type of organization tends to invite exploitation and underestimate the potential of the employees, as creativity of the workers is brushed aside in favour of strict adherence to rules, regulations and procedures.|$|E
5|$|Follow-ups of {{untreated}} {{people over}} thirty {{with a history}} of severe allergic reactions would greatly benefit from venom immunotherapy. Both rapid and slow doses can be done safely during immunotherapy. The efficacy (capacity to induce a therapeutic effect) of ant venom immunotherapy is effective in reducing systemic reactions in comparison to placebo and whole body extract immunotherapy, where patients were more likely to suffer from a systemic reaction. Ultrarush initiation of insect immunotherapy may be used, but results show higher risks of allergic reactions. Despite immunotherapy being successful, only ten percent of patients <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> response to desensitisation.|$|E

English and Latin are the most-used languages for state mottos, each used by 25 states and territories. Seven states and territories use another language, of which each language is only used once.

5|$|The two Amtrak tracks {{share an}} island platform; the RTA tracks <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> platforms. The {{structure}} has a porte-cochère, which protects passengers from inclement weather. The interior was built {{with a similar}} design {{to that of the}} exterior, and features a central skylight. Shadows from its exposed trusses create different patterns on the brown brick floor, built in a basket-weaved pattern. Exposed ductwork is visible throughout the trusses, as are the light fixtures. All of the ceiling elements are painted white, which tend to recede and produce a sense of airiness which is further enhanced by the floor-to-ceiling windows. Banks of seats are located close to public telephones and a vending area.|$|E
5|$|A Floorless Coaster {{is a type}} {{of steel}} roller coaster {{manufactured}} by Bolliger & Mabillard where riders sit with no floor underneath them allowing their feet to swing freely just above the track. Development of the Floorless Coaster began between 1995 and 1996 with Medusa (now known as Bizarro) at Six Flags Great Adventure opening on April 2, 1999, making it the world's first Floorless Coaster. Floorless Coasters also tend to have 3 to 7 inversions incorporated in the layout of the coaster. Recently, Bolliger & Mabillard have used floorless trains on their Dive Coasters, such as Griffon and SheiKra. Though they contain floorless trains, the coasters are still not considered Floorless Coasters as B classifies them as another model. Also, Maurer Söhne have designed their own version of the Floorless Coaster, a variant of their X-Car called X-Car Floorless, but currently <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> installations.|$|E

5|$|Dausprungas is not {{mentioned}} anywhere else. However, {{it is known}} that Mindaugas had two nephews, Tautvilas and Gedvydas, who waged a war against their uncle. Since historians <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> data on other brothers of Mindaugas, it is generally assumed that the two were sons of Dausprungas. During the civil war of 1249–1252 Tautvilas and Gedvydas asked Daniel of Galicia, their brother-in-law, for help. This bit of information indicates that they also had a sister. The sister was the second wife of Daniel and they did not have children. Dausprugas' wife must have been Duke of Samogitia Vykintas' sister since Vykintas was an uncle of Tautvilas and Gedvydas. It is believed that Gedvydas died in 1253 in a campaign against Bohemia, as it is the last message about him. Tautvilas was killed by his cousin Treniota in 1263. Some historians suggest that Tautvilas had a son, Constantine, who ruled Vitebsk, however others disagree and claim that his son might have been Aigust, who was sent by Novgorod to Pskov in 1271.|$|E
5|$|In the sub-plot, Lisa {{discovers that}} the senior {{citizens}} at Grampa's nursing home <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> entertainment, {{and decides to}} buy them a digital TV converter. However, while at the store to buy it, she discovers Mr. Burns feeling very happy playing Funtendo Zii Sports. She decides to buy this for the senior citizens, hoping they will feel younger and happier. When playing the Zii, the senior citizens feel very happy and feel younger. This forces the nurses at the home to work extra hard after their workout, prompting them to wash the Zii in the dishwasher, causing it to break. Lisa becomes angry at the nurses for doing it on purpose, thus showing their disregard for the senior citizens. However, the nurses blow her off. The senior citizens then return to their boring selves, staring at TV static.|$|E
5|$|Random, {{isolated}} cirrus <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> particular significance. A {{large number}} of cirrus clouds can {{be a sign of}} an approaching frontal system or upper air disturbance. This signals a change in weather in the near future, which usually becomes stormier. If the cloud is a cirrus castellanus, there might be instability at the high altitude level. When the clouds deepen and spread, especially when they are of the cirrus radiatus variety or cirrus fibratus species, this usually indicates an approaching weather front. If it is a warm front, the cirrus clouds spread out into cirrostratus, which then thicken and lower into altocumulus and altostratus. The next set of clouds are the rain-bearing nimbostratus clouds. When cirrus clouds precede a cold front, squall line or multicellular thunderstorm, it is because they are blown off the anvil, and the next to arrive are the cumulonimbus clouds. Kelvin-Helmholtz waves indicate extreme wind shear at high levels.|$|E
