25|$|Turbines {{are much}} less {{accessible}} when offshore (requiring {{the use of a}} service vessel or helicopter for routine access, and a <b>jackup</b> rig for heavy service such as gearbox replacement), and thus reliability is more important than for an onshore turbine. Some wind farms located far from possible onshore bases have service teams living on site in offshore accommodation units.|$|E
25|$|Installation {{and service}} / {{maintenance}} of off-shore wind farms are a specific challenge for technology and economic {{operation of a}} wind farm. , there are 20 <b>jackup</b> vessels for lifting components, but few can lift sizes above 5MW. Service vessels have to be operated nearly 24/7 (availability higher than 80% of time) to get sufficient amortisation from the wind turbines. Therefore, special fast service vehicles for installation (like Wind Turbine Shuttle) {{as well as for}} maintenance (including heave compensation and heave compensated working platforms to allow the service staff to enter the wind turbine also at difficult weather conditions) are required. So-called inertial and optical based Ship Stabilization and Motion Control systems (iSSMC) are used for that.|$|E
500|$|For {{about five}} days, Juan and its {{precursor}} produced gale-force winds {{along the northern}} Gulf of Mexico. The strongest winds in relation to Juan were on offshore oil rigs, with one rig recording peak sustained winds of 92mph (148km/h) and gusts to 110mph (176km/h). Juan also produced high waves that damaged several rigs, of which two were overturned. One of the rigs collapsed and fell onto an adjacent rig about [...] south of Golden Meadow, Louisiana amid hurricane-force winds and high seas. The collapsed rigs, built in 1956 and 1961, were designed to withstand [...] waves that would accompany a 25year storm at the time, though Juan produced waves approaching [...] The combination of the waves and strong winds {{in advance of the}} storm prevented early evacuation of the oil rigs. A boat of evacuees overturned {{in the midst of the}} storm, killing one and hospitalizing two others; the remaining workers were rescued by the United States Coast Guard, and overall the agency rescued at least 160people. While conducting a search and rescue mission, a boat named Miss Agnes capsized about [...] south of Grand Isle, Louisiana; two members of the crew went missing and were presumed killed, and two other occupants were rescued. A <b>jackup</b> rig capsized near the mouth of the Mississippi River, killing three. A rescue helicopter off the coast of Louisiana caused three severe injuries when the rescue basket blew onto the evacuated oil rig amid strong winds.|$|E

500|$|A {{project to}} remove the stern by {{dismantling}} it on the beach was started in June 2008, after Oregon legislative approval. [...] The dismantling, expected to cost USD$18million, {{was approved by the}} State Legislative Emergency Board in September 2006. The move was originally scheduled for 2007, but delays in the negotiations pushed the project back a year. Due to weather and surf conditions, the project had to be undertaken during the spring and summer months. [...] Titan Maritime Company, a subsidiary of Crowley Maritime Corporation, signed a USD$16.4million contract with the Oregon Department of State Lands. Titan Maritime used large <b>jackup</b> barges, Karlissa A and Karlissa B, for the New Carissa dismantling project. [...] Once the barges were in place, a cable car system was installed to allow the crews and their equipment access to the barges from the beach. The barges allowed the crews to access the wreck from 40ft (12.2m) above the surf. The crews cut New Carissa into removable pieces and then lifted them to the barges with cranes. The cutting portion of Titan's plan was largely completed by July 31, 2008, and the company then focused on pulling the stern from the sand, a process that was measured in inches. [...] The project's managing director expressed confidence that the removal deadline of October 1, 2008 would be met. [...] By September 2008, Titan had successfully removed the majority of the wreck; no part of the ship was visible from above the water, and only a few relatively small pieces remained submerged. Karlissa A and Karlissa B were relocated on October 12, 2008, and Titan's shore operations were completely removed by November 2008.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACTSince {{the first}} jack-up was built, <b>jackups</b> {{have become the}} most popular type of mobile {{offshore}} drilling unit (MODU) for offshore exploration and development purposes in shallow water. The most pivotal component of the jack-up unit is the leg, which can directly affect the global performance of the unit. In this paper, an investigation into extending {{the length of the}} jack up leg is carried out in order to study the enhancement of the rig capability to drill in deeper water approaching the range of the Semisubmersible Drilling Unit (SSDU) (300 - 1000 ft). A study of the performance of a deep-water jack-up unit is performed with different leg lengths. Typical leg scantling dimensions and identical external loads are assigned, and then a detailed Finite Element Analysis (FEA) model is created in order to simulate the jack-up leg unit’s structural behavior. A Multi-point Constraint (MPC) element together with the spring element is used to deal with the boundary conditions. Finally, a comparative analysis for five leg lengths is carried out to illustrate their performance, including the ultimate static strength, and weight...|$|R
40|$|La banque de données PLATFORM de l'Institut Français du Pétrole (IFP) {{concerne}} les accidents survenus depuis 1955 aux engins pétroliers de forage, de production et d'habitation en mer, de type fixe (plates-formes en acier, en béton...) ou mobile (submersibles, auto-élévatrices, semi-submersibles, navires, barges...) et ayant donné lieu à un arrêt de travail ni programmé, ni prévisible, d'au moins 24 heures. Ce critère, éliminant les nombreux incidents mineurs, peu ou mal connus, lui confère une certaine homogénéité indispensable à la validité de toute banque de données d'accidents. Comportant : - une banque de connaissanceconstituée de fiches détaillées sur le déroulement et des conséquences de chaque accident, et - une banque informatiséebasée sur les seuls paramètres principaux mis en mémoire d'ordinateur, la banque PLATFORM présente le double avantage de : - regrouper, sous une forme ramassée et facilement interrogeable, l'ensemble des accidents connus d'une branche industrielle, - fournir des résultats chiffrés (comptages, statistiques,...) qui, même approximatifs, sont irremplaçables pour les études de risque, de sécurité et de fiabilité. Différents exemples d'application illustrent les possibilités de PLATFORM en s'appuyant sur des paramètres aussi variés que les types d'engin, d'accident, d'activité au moment de l'accident, de facteurs préliminaires, de zones géographiques. IFP's PLATFORM databank concerns accidents since 1955 to {{all kinds}} of off-shore drilling, production or accomodation platforms, both fixed (steel, cement, etc.) and mobile (<b>jackups,</b> submersibles, semi-submersibles, drillships, barges, etc.) having caused an unplanned and unforeseen work stoppage of at least 24 hours. The databank is designed to underline the homogeneity of the data gathered, which is an indispensible condition for obtaining valid statistics. PLATFORM consists of (1) a knowledge base made up of an ongoing information file, including a synthesis data sheet for each accident giving a selection of important facts (date, location, type of accident, etc.) and summarizing the most probable sequence of events of the accident and their consequences, and (2) a computerized databank giving the most important facts for each accident in a strictly controlled language of codes and abbreviations for use in statistical analysis. The computerized databank contains 25 different parameters. Some are made up of multiple components (there are three preliminary factors, four sequences of events, etc.), and others are codes with sub-elements. Data has been entered in three different ways : as uncoded facts, as simple codes, or as complex codes. The latter have enabled a detailed analysis to be made of certain important factors, such as : (a) 72 possible preliminary factors preceding the accident (b) 74 different kinds of events making up a sequence of events (including 5 different types of blowout and 13 types of collision) (c) 196 countries, provinces or states (d) 30 major geographic zones(e) 139 different constructors of platforms, drillships or barges. An analysis of the number of accidents per year from 1972 to 1988 shows a good correlation with the evolution of the price of crude oil during the same period and that of world rig utilization. A comparison with the number of new rigs put onto the market from 1977 to 1988 shows a peak in accidents for the same years, reflecting the fact that new rigs are often subject to accidents at the start of operations. These comparisons serve to demonstrate the good correlation of the PLATFORM databank with results from other studies. PLATFORM can be used to draw up simple data sheets, such as the two lists given of the accidents having caused the most human casualties as well as those having caused the greatest oil spills. It can be used to furnish the probabilities of occurrence of unusual types of accidents, or to give a figure for well-known high-risk activities having actually led to accidents. Such figures are very much appreciated in safety risk analysis. Several statistical results are given to illustrate PLATFORM's capacities. An analysis of activity {{at the time of the}} accident shows that most accidents occurred (in order) during exploration drilling, during production, while rigs were under tow, while rigs were shut down during a storm, during development drilling, and during jacking-up or jacking-down for this type of mobile platform. In fact, 76. 6 % of the accidents to <b>jackups</b> occurred either during towing (30. 9 %), exploration drilling (27. 1 %) or jacking operations (18. 6 %). Accidents to fixed platforms occurred predominantly during production (53 %). The most frequent types of accident were found to be (in order) blowouts, explosions or fires, damage to legs or mats often due to the sea floor, capsizing of the rig, gas kicks and structural cracks. But the major risk varied according to the type of platform : gas blowouts for submersibles, fire/explosions for fixed production platforms, capsizing for barges, sea floor accidents for <b>jackups,</b> gas kicks for drillships and semi-submersibles. A geographic analysis gives the Louisiana sector of the Gulf of Mexico a higher percentage of accidents (37 %) than the Texas sector (7. 5 %) or the Scottish North Sea (8 %). This can easily be explained both by the relative importance of petroleum activity in the sector (especially barges and submersibles operating in swamps, lakes and deltas) and by the comparable wealth of information made public in this region. A further analysis of the region shows more gas blowouts (28 %) than the world average (21 %) and, on the other hand, a chronological decrease in accidents linked to structural resistance, reflecting better rig design and reliability over the years. In general, statistics of accidents, correlated to offshore oil activity, show that accidents are decreasing in the Gulf of Mexico and in Persian Gulf, whereas there are more in the North Sea sector and in general in new areas outside the four major areas of petroleum activity. A monthly analysis of accidents in the northern hemisphere shows that many accidents to production platforms take place in October, which is an unfavorable period for the Gulf of Mexico as well. May to September is a favorable period for the North Sea, and April to July are favorable months for mobile platform activity. A study of different kinds of blowouts during exploration drilling (54. 8 % of all accidents), development drilling (30. 4 %) and production (14. 8 %) show a predominant number of gas blowouts occurring during production operations. A comparison of <b>jackups</b> and semi-submersible platforms shows a greater blowout risk (40 %) for semi-submersibles that can be explained by the subsea position of the BOP for these platforms. Preliminary factors leading to blowouts are mainly due to the absence or failure of the BOP or diverter, and casing or drillstring problems. The weather factor virtually disappears after 1974. A study of personnel evacuation reveals little use of life rafts (5. 1 %) or survival capsules (6. 2 %). In the final phase of emergency rescue, crew members are picked up by service vessels three times as often as by helicopter. In general the PLATFORM databank shows an increase in platform safety and reliability excluding acts of war, as evidenced by the progressive disappearance of such factors as metal fragility and the lessening impact of bad weather. As demonstrated by these examples, the PLATFORM databank fulfills two important functions : (1) providing a body of essential data for each of these important industrial accidents that is homogeneous, concise and easy to consult, and (2) due to this homogeneity, being able to furnish figures that, even if they are approximate, can make up the indispensable basis of risk, safety and reliability analyses...|$|R
