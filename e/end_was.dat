5|$|As a state highway, M-44 {{dates back}} to around July 1, 1919, and it was routed along a section of its modern route at that time. The eastern <b>end</b> <b>was</b> altered in the late 1920s, and the western <b>end</b> <b>was</b> {{extended}} to the Grand Rapids area in the 1970s. For over 20years, M-44 was truncated to remove the M-37 concurrency. Since 2003 though, the highway has terminated at the intersection with 28th Street.|$|E

5|$|This <b>ending</b> <b>was</b> the {{favourite}} {{amongst the}} actors. Mangan {{said that the}} alternative <b>ending</b> <b>was</b> the best moment {{in the whole of}} Green Wing. However, the alternative <b>ending</b> <b>was</b> rejected and the writers favoured the <b>ending</b> that <b>was</b> eventually broadcast. It is believed that the alternative <b>ending</b> would have <b>been</b> broadcast if a third series was being made, as that <b>ending</b> <b>was</b> much more ambiguous, since Alan and Joanna are still seen alive and Mac tells Caroline that he still has something to say.|$|R

5|$|M-59 {{was first}} {{designated}} by July 1, 1919 between M-10 (now Bus. US24) in Pontiac and M-19 (later US25 and now M-3) in Mt. Clemens. It would {{be moved to}} follow Hall Road exclusively on the east end in 1932. The west <b>end</b> <b>was</b> extended in 1936 to end at the Livingstonâ€“Oakland county line. The extension to US 23 in Hartland was finished by 1938. The east <b>end</b> <b>was</b> extended again in 1939 along US25 and over to M-29 in New Baltimore. The east <b>end</b> <b>was</b> rerouted again between Mt. Clemens and New Baltimore over another former alignment of M-29 in late 1947 or early 1948. The eastern terminus was truncated to M-29 east of US25/Gratiot Avenue in 1961.|$|E

5|$|The highway {{was first}} {{designated}} before 1936 along {{a section of}} its current routing. Sections added since then encompass segments formerly belonging to US Highway 2 (US2) and M-48. The last changes came to the highway in 1962 and 1963, when the northern <b>end</b> <b>was</b> extended and the southern <b>end</b> <b>was</b> truncated slightly.|$|E
5|$|The {{trunkline}} {{was designated}} by July 1, 1919 {{along with the}} rest of the original state highway system along a route that is different that of today. South of Paw Paw, the original M-40 reached Niles and even the Indiana state line for a time. The northern <b>end</b> <b>was</b> extended in stages to Holland. The southern <b>end</b> <b>was</b> shifted in the 1970s, resulting in the current routing.|$|E
5|$|Two {{previous}} unrelated highways {{bore the}} M-85 designation. The first was in Montcalm County {{and the second}} near Caro. These uses were retired in the 1930s and the 1940s, respectively. The current M-85 was created in 1956 after {{the construction of the}} Detroit-Toledo Freeway; the original northern <b>end</b> <b>was</b> at an intersection with US Highway25 (US25) in downtown. The northern <b>end</b> <b>was</b> truncated in the late 1960s to the northern junction with I-75. The highway was then extended back into downtown Detroit {{in the first year of}} the 21st century.|$|E

5|$|When {{originally}} signed around July 1, 1919, M-81 {{ran from}} Bay City southeast and {{east to the}} Munger area; from there it ran south concurrently with M-31 to the Reese area before running northeasterly {{to the east of}} Cass City to M-53. By 1921, the eastern <b>end</b> <b>was</b> extended southerly from Caro to Mayville along a highway that is now part of M-24. In late 1926, the western <b>end</b> <b>was</b> changed so that M-81 followed the former M-31 from Reese into Saginaw and the eastern <b>end</b> <b>was</b> rerouted from Caro northeasterly to the Cass City area. With the exception of the routing through downtown Saginaw, the highway followed the approximate routing of the current highway.|$|E
5|$|When {{the state}} highway system was first signposted in 1919, M-56 was {{assigned}} to roadways that ran northeasterly from the Ohio state line to the Belleville area. When the United States Numbered Highway System was created on November 11, 1926, the southern section between the state line and Monroe was redesignated as a section of US25. In the 1940s, the northern <b>end</b> <b>was</b> rerouted north from New Boston to follow M-112 along the Willow Run Expressway (now I-94 {{and part of the}} Detroit Industrial Freeway) into Belleville north to US112. In late 1954 or early 1955, the northern <b>end</b> <b>was</b> changed again, this time truncating the highway to end at New Boston. The northern <b>end</b> <b>was</b> shortened again to terminate at US24/US25 in Flat Rock in 1956. The remainder of the highway from Monroe to Flat Rock was removed and decommissioned from the state highway system the next year, becoming county roads under the jurisdiction of Monroe and Wayne counties.|$|E

5|$|In 1930, M-57 was {{designated}} from M-66 (now M-91) near Langston to M-47 (now M-52) in St. Charles. By the mid 1936, the section between Ithaca and St. Charles {{was removed from}} the state highway system when the designation was shifted south to run between Ashley and Chesaning. In the process, M-57 was run concurrently along US27 between Ithaca and Ashley. The western section was similarly shifting by May 1938. The new routing started at a junction with US131 between Rockford and Cedar Springs and continued through Greenville and Carson City to Ashley. The eastern <b>end</b> <b>was</b> also extended from Chesaning to the Clio area. It was extended a second time by early 1941 to a junction with Belsay Road. By the middle of 1946, the eastern <b>end</b> <b>was</b> extended a third time to end in Otisville. M-57 was lengthened after a western extension in late 1948 or early 1949. The highway was routed concurrently with US131 to Cedar Springs and then west to M-37 at Kent City.|$|E
