5|$|The {{newly created}} xylem is the sapwood. It is {{composed}} of water-conducting cells and associated cells which are often living, and is usually pale in colour. It transports water and minerals from the roots to the upper parts of the tree. The oldest, inner part of the sapwood is progressively converted into heartwood as new sapwood is formed at the cambium. The conductive cells of the heartwood are blocked in some species, and the surrounding cells are more often dead. Heartwood is usually darker in colour than the sapwood. It is the dense central core of the trunk giving it rigidity. Three quarters of the <b>dry</b> <b>mass</b> of the xylem is cellulose, a polysaccharide, {{and most of the}} remainder is lignin, a complex polymer. A transverse section through a tree trunk or a horizontal core will show concentric circles or lighter or darker wood - tree rings. These rings are the annual growth rings There may also be rays running at right angles to growth rings. These are vascular rays which are thin sheets of living tissue permeating the wood. Many older trees may become hollow but may still stand upright for many years.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{study was}} carried out at Botswana College of Agriculture (BCA) garden to {{evaluate}} the response of Corchorus olitorius grown in four different growing media as follows; clay, sandy, commercial compost and loam soil being the treatments 1 - 4, respectively. A completely randomized design (CRD) with each treatment replicated four times was used.

25|$|Since the 1980s, spice heat {{has been}} more {{precisely}} measured by a method that uses high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). This method measures the concentration of heat-producing chemicals. The measurements uses a mathematical formula that weights them according to their relative capacity to produce perceived heat (pungency). This method yields results, not in Scoville units, but in American Spice Trade Association (ASTA) pungency units. ASTA pungency units are then multiplied by 16 {{in order to be}} reported as Scoville units, as according to the published method, a measurement of one part capsaicin per million corresponds to about 16 Scoville units.

25|$|The {{effect of}} mating on female fitness may vary {{depending}} upon the kind of benefit that the females receive from males through of their choices. Direct benefits include nutritional resources {{to be used by}} females, donation of foods to mates, males offering prey to the female, seen in scorpion flies and dance flies. Several orthopteran species, butterflies, flies, and beetle males can donate secretions or nutritional substances to the females which are transferred in the ejaculate or produced by male glands which can contribute to increase female fecundity. In the green-veined white (Pieris napi), a virgin male can transfer an ejaculate containing 14% nitrogen by <b>dry</b> <b>mass.</b> Females utilize the nutrients transferred from the male in order to increase their nutrients. These nutrients essentially contribute to ensure successful egg production. A positive relationship between the amount of ejaculate material received and lifetime reproductive output, as male-transferred material increases female longevity. Male-transferred material also increases female longevity. In some insect species, males can donate some body parts to females such as the leg spurs or the fleshy hindwings of jumped-winged crickets, or they may be completely cannibalized, as occurs in mantis and some dipterous, as well as in some Arachnida scorpions and spider species.|$|E

2500|$|Perhaps {{the most}} obvious {{structural}} characteristic of bacteria is (with some exceptions) their small size. For example, Escherichia coli cells, an [...] "average" [...] sized bacterium, are about 2µm (micrometres) long and 0.5µm in diameter, with a cell volume of 0.6 - 0.7 μm3. [...] This corresponds to a wet mass of about 1 picogram (pg), assuming that the cell consists mostly of water. The <b>dry</b> <b>mass</b> of a single cell can be estimated as 23% of the wet mass, amounting to 0.2 pg.

Therefore, a typical fully grown 1-liter culture of Escherichia coli (at an optical density of 1.0, corresponding to ca. 109 cells/ml) yields about 1 g wet cell mass. Small size is extremely important because it allows for a large surface area-to-volume ratio which allows for rapid uptake and intracellular distribution of nutrients and excretion of wastes. At low surface area-to-volume ratios the diffusion of nutrients and waste products across the bacterial cell membrane limits the rate at which microbial metabolism can occur, making the cell less evolutionarily fit. The reason for the existence of large cells is unknown, although it is speculated that the increased cell volume is used primarily for storage of excess nutrients.|$|E
