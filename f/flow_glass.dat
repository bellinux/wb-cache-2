This paper {{presents the results of}} a study regarding the application of non-destructive ultrasonic techniques in evaluating the conservation state of the Dolmen Sa Coveccada in northern Sardinia (Italy). The study was carried out within the framework of a relevant project of restoration of megalithic monuments promoted by the Soprintendenza per i Beni Archeologici di Sassari (Italy) (National Archaeological Authority of Sassari – Italy), Comunità Montana di Monte Acuto (Mountain Community Administration of Monte Acuto) and Comune di Mores (Local Town Authority of Mores) (Italy). The study Dolmen is a megalithic structure of great historic and scientific importance and is the only example of its kind in Sardinian archaeology (Italy). It is made of the dacites of the Oligo-Miocene calcalkaline volcanic cycle of northern Sardinia. At the petrographic microscope, the volcanic rocks present a porphyric vitrophyric structure and an isotropic texture, with phenocrystals of plagioclase (often united in glomerocrystals), quartz, biotite, amphibole, clinopyroxene and sanidine, included in a vitreous fluidal mass with laminar <b>flow,</b> <b>glass</b> shards and spherulitic devitrification. In the femic minerals, which are more unstable at environmental temperature and pressure, intense oxidation has caused an increase in microporosity and microcracks which at the macroscale have triggered some important forms of degradation such as exfoliation and fissuration that have drastically changed the stability and safety of the monument. In this context the use of the ultrasonic techniques was very effective both to define the elasto-mechanical properties of the building materials such as longitudinal ultrasonic velocity, quality index and fracture coefficient, and to detect the presence of discontinuities caused by degradation phenomena and cracks. In addition, the ultrasonic techniques were used in laboratory on samples of the same volcanic building materials of the Dolmen to investigate the repairing efficiency of chemical consolidating materials such as epoxidic resins and to test their compatibility with the investigated materials. The selected epoxidic resin (EPO 150) was applied on fresh-cut dacite volcanic samples so that changes on elasto-mechanical properties were also evaluated in time...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Formation damage effects {{have been reported in}} a number of oil reservoirs in secondary and enhanced recovery stages of production. The loss in permeability has been widely attributed to the swelling or pore-plugging action of colloidal clay minerals which are present in varying quantities in the pore spaces of reservoir rocks. This research has been aimed at predicting the action of non-swelling clay particles such as those commonly found in North Sea reservoir sandstones. The literature from the areas of formation damage, colloidal suspensions, and deep bed filtration has been examined with particular attention being given to the subject of clay mineralogy. An experimental test rig was designed, comprising a cylindrical packed sand bed used as a model reservoir to study the permeability changes associated with the action of clay fines under various flooding regimes. The pH, salinity and valency of ionic species present in the flooding fluids were found to be the controlling factors for clay mobilisation. Fines dispersal coincided with spontaneous decrease. in permeability when sandpacks treated with monovalent brine were subjected to fresh water flow. Analysis showed that'the fines released from the bed were primarily kaolinite in the size range 1 - 5 micron. A minimum critical+ salinity of flooding water was shown to exist, above which particle dispersal is prevented. Further, experimental work provided a measure of the ion exchange capacity of the clay fines in the sandpack as well as of pure clay materials. The close-range interaction of kaolinite particles with silica surfaces was measured in a continuous <b>flow</b> <b>glass</b> apparatus which allowed in-situ observation and measurement by optical microscopy. Particle deposition in this system was found to be very sensitive to the method of cleaning of the silica surface. Deposition was also a function of the suspension flowrate. Clay mobilisation behaviour, as observed in the sandpack experiments, was confirmed with suspension pH, salinity and flowrate to a lesser extent, governing the particle release process. The research has identified the conditions under which clay mobilisation is initiated. It is proposed that any model of permeability reduction should be adapted to include the effects of specific ion-exchange processes between clays and flooding liquids...|$|E

40|$|This work {{deals with}} the {{examination}} on influence of the initial redox state of glass on the bubble formation and removing and on the feasibility of identification of bubble sources in a glass melting space. The numerical computation program REDOX was developed for the calculation of distribution of oxidation-reduction species in the non-isothermal melting space with <b>flowing</b> <b>glass</b> and used simultaneously with {{the program for the}} computation of glass temperatures and velocities in a glass melting space and with the procedure for calculation of trajectories, sizes and composition of bubbles. The soda-lime-silica glass containing iron ions and sulphates as well as glass for TV panels containing ions of antimony and cerium were used for the model calculations. The results of cacculations of multicomponent bubble behaviour at different initial values of redox state of glass at isothermal conditions have shown that the initial redox state of glass had an unambiguous impact both on the rate of bubble removing glass and on the final properties of bubbles, currently used for the identification of bubble sources in the glassmelting space. The calculations of distribution of redox species in the non-isothermal glass melting space was carried out to include the time temperature history of bubbles. The results show as well a distinct influence of the redox state of glass on the interaction between glassmelts and gases, corresponding to the results acquired at isothermal conditions. Generally, the increasing redox value increased the driving force of the oxygen transport into bubbles in the glass with the oxide refining agent while the driving force of refining gases into bubbles in glasses containing sulphates exhibited minimum value at the medium values of the initial redox state of glass. Regarding the significance of the redox state of glass for the identification of bubble sources in a glassmelting space, {{it was found that the}} redox value considerably influences both the s. c. stationary concentrations of gases in bubbles an the resulting pressure inside of bubbles, used for the source identification. The results indicate that the identification of bubbles coming from low temperature zones is more feasible than for those coming from high temperature parts.
