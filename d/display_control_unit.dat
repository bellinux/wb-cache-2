40|$|As {{hardware}} becomes {{cheaper and}} cheaper, {{there is an}} increasing interest {{in the implementation of}} distributed control networks with microcontrollers. Such networks are usually inexpensive and of high performance. In this thesis work, a low-cost <b>display</b> <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> for COLAN, a control-oriented network, is designed. The system is based on the 8051 single-chip microprocessor and 82716 video controller. COLAN network users can remotely display and control the screen by sending commands to the display control node through the network. The emphasis of this thesis is in the implementation of the display control node, including hardware and software. It has been demonstrated that a basic set of display control functions has been developed, different type monitors can be supported, and on-screen instructions make the system easy to use...|$|E
30|$|This {{was because}} NC and PC evolved {{independently}} {{through their own}} evolutionary paths (Shibata, 2009). The two systems had reached different modular architectural structures through their own evolutionary paths; the PC reached “open” architecture, while the NC reached “closed” architecture. In other words, many PC modules, such as displays, motherboards and keyboards, can be purchased separately on the open market, whereas NC modules, such as <b>display</b> <b>units,</b> <b>control</b> <b>units</b> and servo units, cannot be purchased on the open market. Therefore, {{it was difficult for}} these two systems to be integrated, although both are modular structures.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{development}} {{trend and}} research focus of control system is networked control. The Field Bus Control System (FCS) {{which is important}} segment in networked system is widely applied in control system. The CAN (Controller Area Network) bus which has strong fault tolerance, high reliability and low cost {{plays an important role}} in FCS. The CAN is a serial communication protocol which efficiently supports distributed real-time control with a very high level of security. Its domain of application ranges from high speed networks to low cost multiplex wiring. In automotive electronics, engine <b>control</b> <b>units,</b> sensors, anti-skid-systems, etc. are connected using CAN with bit rates up to 1 M bit/s. This project is to develop an automatic monitor and control of any non-industrial process using a Portable Embedded data <b>display</b> and <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> based on CAN Bus. It is implemented by applying 16 bit RISC key microprocessor technique, embedded software technology, embedded GUI (Graphics User Interface) technology, CAN bus communication technology, information storage and management technology[6]. The Proposed system involves the CAN Protocol to communicate the data. The system consists of many nodes each comprising a PIC microcontroller and a sensor. The data is retrieved from the sensor and forwarded to a PIC microcontroller through a CAN transceiver. The PIC Microcontroller establishes connection with a CAN Protocol and process the sensor data and the data through the CAN Bus which is twisted pair of wires. Another PIC microcontroller at remote end is interfaced with LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) to view the sensor data and send back control signal to the sensor through CAN protocol. The research and development of this project was driven by robustness of CAN communication and its practicality of application...|$|R
40|$|In many cockpits, <b>control</b> <b>display</b> <b>units</b> (CDUs) {{are vital}} input and {{information}} devices. In {{order to improve}} the usability of these devices, Barco, in cooperation with TU-Delft, created a touch screen <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> (TSCU), consisting of a high-quality multi-touch screen. The unit fits in the standard dimensions of a conventional CDU and is thus suitable for both retrofit and new installations. The TSCU offers two major advantages. First, the interface can be reconfigured to enable consecutive execution of several tasks on the same display area, allowing for a more efficient usage of the limited display real-estate {{as well as a}} potential reduction of cost. Secondly, advanced graphical interface design, in combination with multi-touch gestures, can improve human-machine interaction. To demonstrate the capabilities of this concept, a graphical software application was developed to perform the same operations as a conventional CDU, but now using a direct manipulation interface (DMI) of the displayed graphics. The TSCU can still be used in a legacy CDU mode, displaying a virtual keyboard operated with the touch interface. In addition, the TSCU could be used for a variety of other cockpit functions.
