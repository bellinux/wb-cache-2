40|$|AbstractIn the Chinese {{securities}} market, {{with its}} characteristics of influence through personal relationships (Guanxi) and underdeveloped standards {{of law and}} enforcement, can independent directors play the supervisory role expected by securities regulators? In this study we use the degree of precision and accuracy in corporate earnings forecasts as proxies {{for the quality of}} information disclosure by listed companies and examine the supervisory efficiency of independent <b>directors</b> <b>with</b> respect to information disclosure. Using data from 2007 to 2009, we find that in the absence of ownership balance, independent directors have a significant positive effect on the accuracy of management forecasts. In addition, the personal backgrounds of independent directors have specific effects on management earnings forecasts. <b>Directors</b> <b>with</b> certified public accountant (CPA) expertise significantly improve the precision of management forecasts. However, <b>directors</b> <b>with</b> industrial expertise significantly reduce the precision of management forecasts. In other words, having <b>directors</b> <b>with</b> CPA expertise improves the independence of boards, but having independent <b>directors</b> <b>with</b> industrial expertise has the opposite effect...|$|R
