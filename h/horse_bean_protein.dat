40|$|The {{objective}} of the experiments was to demonstrate the influence of low- and high-tannin <b>horse</b> <b>bean</b> on the selected fermentation indicators. The sheep rumen content {{with the addition of}} 1, 2 and 5 g of high- and low-tannin <b>horse</b> <b>bean</b> was incubated in vessels of 250 ml volume. A significant increase of ammonia, lactic acid, CO 2 and methane as well as pH decrease in samples with addition of <b>horse</b> <b>bean</b> seed was demonstrated. While comparing high- and low-tannin <b>horse</b> <b>bean</b> varieties, it was observed {{that in the case of}} small doses of 1 and 2 g a higher intensity of fermentation takes place in the samples with the addition of high-tannin <b>horse</b> <b>bean.</b> In the case of larger doses of 5 g per sample, a higher intensity of fermentation takes place in the samples with the addition of low-tannin horse-bean. A probable reason for the decrease in the fermentation process intensity in the samples with the addition of 5 g of high-tannin <b>horse</b> <b>bean</b> is a high content of tannins, which reduce fermentation processes.

40|$|ABSTRACT The Metema-Gelabat border <b>horse</b> <b>beans</b> export {{encountered}} {{a number of}} influencing factors that deter its performance. Among others inadequate capital, lack of experience on export trading, inadequate knowledge of exporters, lower quality standards of <b>horse</b> <b>beans</b> and inadequacy of export incentives and government support services {{are supposed to be}} critical. The major objective {{of this study was to}} identify and analyze to what extent those major determinants affect the performance of export of <b>horse</b> <b>beans</b> across the border. A binary logistic regression is employed using SPSS 15. 0 software to examine the effects of the selected variables on the performance of export of <b>horse</b> <b>beans.</b> A sample of fifty exporters residing in Bahir Dar, Gondar and Metema towns have been taken from a total of 87 exporters in the three areas using simple random sampling technique as primary sources of information. The findings of the study implied that the amount of exporters’ capital, the quality of exportable <b>horse</b> <b>beans</b> and support services of the government were found to significantly affect performance of export.

Glomerular IgA deposition was demonstrated in all IgA nephropathy and Henoch-Schoenlein purpura nephritis, and in four lupus nephritis. Positive findings of food antigens, observed as mesangial pattern, were obtained in eleven cases (39. 3 %) with casein, 21 (75. 0 %) with soy <b>bean</b> <b>protein</b> and one (3. 6 %) with rice protein in IgA nephropathy, even though no such findings were seen in the control group. Eleven of 28 patients with IgA nephropathy were positive with soy <b>bean</b> <b>protein</b> alone, nine were positive with soy <b>bean</b> <b>protein</b> + casein, one was positive with soy <b>bean</b> <b>protein</b> + casein + rice protein, and one was positive with casein alone. The deposition of food antigens was not observed in six cases only. Furthermore, no correlation was noted between the deposition of food antigens and the deposition of IgA 1, IgA 2 or J chain, in vitro binding of the secretory component, or histopathological grades. These results suggest that the exact meanings of glomerular deposition are unclear.

Purpose of this study: The aim {{of this study was to}} confirm the positive effects of mung <b>bean</b> <b>protein</b> (GLUCOD IATM) on glucose metabolism in clinical trials. Method: This clinical study was conducted using a double-blind placebo-controlled design with 45 prediabetes patients. Results: Many of the subjects were pre-diabetes with blood glucose levels exceeding 140 mg/dl by 2 -hour plasma glucose lev el. However, the initial mean fasting plasma glucose level was less than 100 mg/dl. Therefore, mung <b>bean</b> <b>protein</b> did not lower fasting plasma glucose levels. The test period extended from summer to autumn, and increased fasting plasma glucose levels in the placebo group were observed due to seasonal factors. However, this increase was suppressed in the test group. Similarly, the mean insulin level increased in the placebo group, but the increase was also suppressed in the test group. Among obese subjects with a high body mass index, significant increases in fasting plasma glucose and insulin levels in the placebo group were observed.

AIbumins and globulins accounted for 21. 18 and 73. 40 percent, respectively, of the total <b>bean</b> <b>proteins.</b> The <b>bean</b> <b>proteins</b> were fractionated and protein concentrates and protein isolates were prepared. The <b>bean</b> flour <b>proteins,</b> albumins, globulins, protein concentrates, and protein isolates (heretofore referred to as fractions) were studied electrophoretically. Several functional properties of the fractions were investigated. Protein concentrates had the highest water and oil absorption capacity (5. 93 and 4. 12 g/g, respectively) and emulsion capacity (72. 6 g oil emulsified/g). Albumins registered the highest emulsion stability (780 hours at 21 °C). Foaming performance of the Great Northern <b>bean</b> <b>proteins</b> was fair and concentration dependent. Sorption isotherms studies indicated that the bean flour had higher equilibrium moisture content at corresponding temperature and equilibrium relative humidity than other fractions. Buffer capacity of the <b>bean</b> <b>proteins</b> over a pH range of 4 - 8 was modest. Modification (succinylation and oxidation) improved the water and oil absorption capacity of the <b>bean</b> <b>proteins.</b> Globulins registered the highest stickiness (92 N) among all the fractions. Alkali solubilization of the <b>bean</b> <b>proteins</b> resulted in significant reduction in trypsin and chymotrypsin inhibitory activities and elimination of hemagglutinating activity. Protein concentrates were essentially void of flatulence activity. Amino acid profiles indicated that the <b>bean</b> flour <b>proteins,</b> albumins, and protein isolates contained high acidic amino acids, while globulins and protein concentrates were characterized by high proportions of hydrophobic amino acids. Sulfur containing amino acids and leucine were {{the first and second}} limiting amino acids in the Great Northern <b>bean</b> <b>proteins.</b> Heat treatment of the fractions improved the in vitro protein digestibility. Baking studies indicated that replacement of wheat flour by the bean flour and the protein concentrates for improved nutritionality of cookies and bread was possible without adversely affecting the sensory quality attributes. In cookie preparation, <b>bean</b> flour and <b>protein</b> concentrates could replace wheat flour up to 30 percent and 20 percent (by weight), respectively; the corresponding figures for the wheat flour replacement in breadmaking were 10 percent and 10 percent (by weight). Fermentation of the Great Northern beanrice blends suggested the potential for these beans in developing fermented foods. The beans contained 59. 20 percent (on a dry weight basis) of starch. Starch granule size ranged from 12 X 12 μm to 58 X 40 μm (length X width) and the granule shape was round to oval to elliptical, and in certain cases, concave as well. Lamellae were present on all the starch granules observed. Amylose {{content of the}} starch was 10. 20 percent (on starch basis). Stable gel formation by the bean starch was observed at concentrations of 7 percent and above (w /v). The viscoamylographic studies of the isolated starch indicated the restricted swelling character of the bean starch. Solubility and swelling of the bean starch was both pH and temperature dependent. The addition of free fatty acids to the isolated starch reduced the viscosity and raised the gelatinization temperature of the bean starch. Modifications (acetylation and oxidation) of the isolated starch resulted in altered solubility and swelling characteristics. Replacement of wheat flour by the bean starch caused an increase in alkaline water retention capacity.
