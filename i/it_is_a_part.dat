5|$|Inocybe praetervisa is a small, {{yellow and}} brown {{mushroom}} in the Inocybaceae family, distinguished from {{other members of}} the genus by its unusual spores and bulb. The unusual spores led to the species being named the type species of the now-abandoned genus Astrosporina; recent studies have shown that such a genus could not exist, as the species with the defining traits do not form a monophyletic group. However, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> of several clades within the genus Inocybe. I.praetervisa grows on the ground in woodland, favouring beech trees, and can be found in Europe, North America and Asia. It is inedible and probably poisonous due to the presence of muscarine. The ingestion of muscarine can lead to SLUDGE syndrome, and could potentially lead to death due to respiratory failure.|$|E
