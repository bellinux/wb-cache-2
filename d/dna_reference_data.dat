40|$|For the Arid Shrublands of Western Australia (WA) {{knowledge}} is limited on what sheep eat and how nutritious their diets are. A study was undertaken on two stations near Yalgoo (28 º 18 ’S 116 º 38 ’E) in WA, from November 2005 to December 2007. Station 1 (28 º 39 ’S 116 º 18 ’E) used a flexible rotational grazing management system (RGS), moving 3000 - 4000 Merino sheep every 3 – 6 weeks through {{a choice of}} 20 paddocks. Station 2 (28 º 18 ’S 116 º 42 ’E) used a flexible continuous grazing management system where small mobs (500 sheep) stayed in paddocks all year, until shearing. Two paddocks on Station 2 were chosen to represent paddocks with high (CGS-G) and low (CGS-P) feed value. A total of 300 Merino hogget (18 months old) ewes {{were randomly selected from}} the stations. One hundred and fifty sheep from each station were selected and separated into three mobs of 50 sheep by stratifying live weights. The selected sheep were allocated to either of the two paddocks on Station 2 or the single rotating mob on Station 1. Therefore there were a total of 100 sheep, 50 from each station, on each of the two paddocks on Station 2 and the one rotating mob on Station 1. Throughout the study period sheep live weights, body condition scores (BCS) and wool production were measured and related to plant photosynthetic activity (derived from Normalised Difference Vegetation Index - NDVI), and dietary energy, protein and digestibility (determined from faecal NIRS calibrations). A <b>DNA</b> <b>reference</b> <b>data</b> bank of some common native plant species was established and then used as a library to identify plant species in sheep faeces and thus provide information on variations in diet composition over the study period. Plant nutritional content was also measured and compared to climatic changes and sheep nutrition. Over the study period Merino ewe live weights, wool production, faecal samples and native plant leaf material were collected and analysed from each of the three management treatments (RGS, CGS-G, CGS-P). Wool production measurements included wool length, strength and fibre diameter, including position of breaks, minimum and maximum diameter along the staple of midside samples. Oven dried plant and faecal samples were ground and subsequently analysed for proximate composition. Plant samples were further analysed for mineral contents and 24 h in vitro gas production (GP) using the rumen buffer gas fermentation technique. Organic matter digestibility (OMD) and metabolisable energy (ME) content of the plants were determined using 24 h net gas production. Faecal near infrared reflectance spectroscopy (fNIRS) calibrations, developed by Curtin University of Technology and ChemCentre WA, were used to predict the nutritional attributes of sheep diets. Sheep production was found to be affected by rainfall, seasons, management and differing blood lines. In 2006, live weights, BCS and wool fibre diameter increased in response to high summer rainfall. Lower rainfall in 2007 resulted in variable, but generally less animal production with lower live weights, BCS and wool fibre diameter. Management decisions to avoid mating in 2006 on CGS; and agistment for sheep on RGS at the end of 2006 resulted in better sheep production results. Sheep originally sourced from Station 2 generally had higher live weights than sheep sourced from Station 1, suggesting a difference in bloodlines. Faecal DNA provided useful information regarding diet selection and diversity of sheep grazing on the Arid Shrublands of WA. Of the species that were DNA profiled, the sheep ate Acacia saligna, Aristida contorta, Atriplex spp., Enchylaena tomentosa, Frankenia sp., Ptilotus obovatus, Rhagodia eremaea and Scaevola spinescens in 2006 whilst in 2007; the sheep consumed A. saligna, A. contorta, Atriplex spp., Eremophila forrestii, Enneapogon caerulescens, Frankenia spp., Maireana spp., Ptilotus obovatus, Rhagodia eremaea, Solanum lasiophyllum and Stipa elegantissima. However, there were 28 amplified bands in 2006 and 51 in 2007 that did not conclusively match any of the reference plant species. This indicates that the sheep were consuming diets that contained more species than what was analysed in this study. Faecal DNA results indicated a decrease in the diversity of the diets selected by the sheep during summer, which coincided with a decrease in animal production. Native plants were found to be low in OMD and ME, but high in crude protein (CP), and variable in mineral content. Sheep were able to select diets adequate in OMD, ME and CP for maintenance requirements, and low in tannins and phenolics, although continuous drought conditions resulted in reduced production, indicating that the sheep were not getting adequate nutrition to meet their growth requirements. The use of fNIRS provided more useful information {{about the quality of the}} diet of the sheep than nutritionally profiling individual plants. NDVI was found to be related to dietary OMD and wool fibre diameter changes along the staple. Overall, the effects of management seemed to be secondary to the effects of climate on sheep production and nutrition. The statistical accuracy of results was low; however, the use of advanced technologies to explore relationships between climate, plant nutritional profiles and animal production and nutrition has provided an expansion of knowledge of sheep nutrition in the region. This extra knowledge may help land owners in the region to make more sustainable management decisions concerning livestock management and grazing pressures on native pastures...|$|E

40|$|The recent {{emergence}} of barcoding approaches coupled {{to those of}} next-generation sequencing (NGS) has raised new perspectives for studying environmental communities. In this framework, we tested the possibility to derive accurate inventories of diatom communities from pyrosequencing outputs with an available <b>DNA</b> <b>reference</b> library. We used three molecular markers targeting the nuclear, chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes (SSU rDNA, rbcL and cox 1) and three samples of a mock community composed of 30 known diatom strains belonging to 21 species. In the goal to detect methodological biases, one sample was constituted directly from pooled cultures, whereas the others consisted of pooled PCR products. The NGS reads obtained by pyrosequencing (Roche 454) were compared first to a <b>DNA</b> <b>reference</b> library including the sequences of all the species used to constitute the mock community, and second to a complete <b>DNA</b> <b>reference</b> library with a larger taxonomic coverage. A stringent taxonomic assignation gave inventories that were compared to the real one. We detected biases due to DNA extraction and PCR amplification that resulted in false-negative detection. Conversely, pyrosequencing errors appeared to generate false positives, especially in case of closely allied species. The taxonomic coverage of <b>DNA</b> <b>reference</b> libraries {{appears to be the}} most crucial factor, together with marker polymorphism which is essential to identify taxa at the species level. RbcL offers a high resolving power together with a large <b>DNA</b> <b>reference</b> library.

40|$|Sufficient {{quantity}} of genomic DNA {{can be a}} bottleneck in genome-wide analysis of clinical tissue samples. DNA polymerase Phi 29 {{can be used for}} the random-primed amplification of whole genomes, although the amplification may introduce bias in gene dosage. We have performed a detailed investigation of this technique in archival fresh-frozen and formalin-fixed/paraffin-embedded tumor DNA by using cDNA microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization. Phi 29 amplified DNA from matched pairs of fresh-frozen and formalin-fixed/paraffin-embedded tumor samples with similar efficiency. The distortion in gene dosage representation in the amplified DNA was nonrandom and reproducibly involved distinct genomic loci. Regional amplification efficiency was significantly linked to regional GC content of the template genome. The biased gene representation in amplified tumor DNA could be effectively normalized by using amplified <b>reference</b> <b>DNA.</b> Our <b>data</b> suggest that genome-wide gene dosage alterations in clinical tumor samples can be reliably assessed from a few hundred tumor cells. Therefore, this amplification method should lend itself to high-throughput genetic analyses of limited sources of tumor, such as fine-needle biopsies, laser-microdissected tissue, and small paraffin-embedded specimens...|$|R

We evaluated the ability of bacterial artificial chromosomes/P 1 -derived artificial and oligonucleotide array-CGH analyses to detect constitutional sex chromosome imbalances using sex-mismatched <b>reference</b> <b>DNAs.</b> Twenty-two samples with imbalances involving either the X or Y chromosome, including deletions, duplications, triplications, derivative or isodicentric chromosomes, and aneuploidy, were analyzed. Although concordant results were obtained for approximately one-half of the samples when using sex-mismatched and sex-matched <b>reference</b> <b>DNAs,</b> array-CGH analyses with sex-mismatched <b>reference</b> <b>DNAs</b> did not detect genomic imbalances that were detected using sex-matched <b>reference</b> <b>DNAs</b> in 6 of 22 patients.

Sex-matched <b>reference</b> <b>DNAs</b> in array-CGH analyses provides optimal sensitivity and enables an automated statistical evaluation for the detection of sex chromosome imbalances when compared with an experimental design using sex-mismatched <b>reference</b> <b>DNAs.</b> Using sex-mismatched <b>reference</b> <b>DNAs</b> in array-CGH analyses may generate false-negative, false-positive, and ambiguous results for sex chromosome-specific probes, thus masking potential pathogenic genomic imbalances.

40|$|Abstract Background Some array {{comparative}} genomic hybridisation (array CGH) platforms {{require a}} minimum of micrograms of DNA for the generation of reliable and reproducible data. For studies where there are limited amounts of genetic material, whole genome amplification (WGA) is an attractive method for generating sufficient quantities of genomic material from miniscule amounts of starting material. A range of WGA methods are available and the multiple displacement amplification (MDA) approach {{has been shown to}} be highly accurate, although amplification bias has been reported. In the current study, WGA was used to amplify DNA extracted from whole blood. In total, six array CGH experiments were performed to investigate whether the use of whole genome amplified DNA (wgaDNA) produces reliable and reproducible results. Four experiments were conducted on amplified DNA compared to unamplified DNA and two experiments on unamplified DNA compared to unamplified DNA. Findings All the experiments involving wgaDNA resulted in a high proportion of losses and gains of genomic material. Previously, amplification bias has been overcome by using amplified DNA in both the test and <b>reference</b> <b>DNA.</b> Our <b>data</b> suggests that this approach may not be effective, as the gains and losses introduced by WGA appears to be random and are not reproducible between different experiments using the same DNA. Conclusion In light of these findings, the use of both amplified test and <b>reference</b> <b>DNA</b> on CGH arrays may not provide an accurate representation of copy number variation in the DNA. </p...|$|R

40|$|Summary: We {{explored}} {{the effect of}} using male and female <b>reference</b> <b>data</b> in a male sample to categorise areal bone mineral density (BMD). Using male <b>reference</b> <b>data,</b> {{a large proportion of}} fractures arose from osteopenia, whereas using female <b>reference</b> <b>data</b> shifted the fracture burden into normal BMD. Introduction: The {{purpose of this study was}} to describe fracture risk associated with osteopenia and osteoporosis in older men, defined by areal BMD and using cut-points derived from male and female <b>reference</b> <b>data.</b> Methods: As part of the Geelong Osteoporosis Study, we followed 619 men aged 60 – 93 years after BMD assessments (performed 2001 – 2006) until 2010, fracture, death or emigration. Post-baseline fractures were radiologically confirmed, and proportions of fractures in each BMD category were age-standardised to national profiles. Results: Based on World Health Organization criteria, and using male <b>reference</b> <b>data,</b> 207 men had normal BMD at the femoral neck, 357 were osteopenic and 55 were osteoporotic. Using female <b>reference</b> <b>data,</b> corresponding numbers were 361, 227 and 31. During the study, 130 men died, 15 emigrated and 63 sustained at least one fracture. Using male <b>reference</b> <b>data,</b> most (86. 5 %) of the fractures occurred in men without osteoporosis on BMD criteria (18. 4 % normal BMD, 68. 1 % osteopenia). The pattern differed when female <b>reference</b> <b>data</b> were used; while most fractures arose from men without osteoporosis (88. 2 %), the burden shifted from those with osteopenia (34. 8 %) to those with normal BMD (53. 4 %). Conclusions: Decreasing BMD categories defined increasing risk of fracture. Although men with osteoporotic BMD were at greatest risk, they made a relatively small contribution to the total burden of fractures. Using male <b>reference</b> <b>data,</b> two-thirds of the fractures arose from men with osteopenia. However, using female <b>reference</b> <b>data,</b> approximately half of the fractures arose from those with normal BMD. Using female <b>reference</b> <b>data</b> to define osteoporosis in men does not appear to be the optimal approach...|$|R

However, when 200 <b>reference</b> <b>data</b> was increased to 388 in the confusion matrix, the accuracy slightly improved from 83. 5 % to 89. 17 %, with Kappa statistic increased from 0. 7502459 to 0. 8026135, respectively. The accuracy in this classification suggested that this strategy for the selection of training area, interpretation approaches and number of <b>reference</b> <b>data</b> used were importance to perform better classification result...|$|R

40|$|The ground {{data used}} as a {{reference}} in the validation of land cover change products are often not an ideal gold standard but degraded by error. The effects of ground <b>reference</b> <b>data</b> error on the accuracy of land cover change detection and the accuracy of estimates {{of the extent of}} change was evaluated. Twelve data sets were simulated to allow the exploration of the impacts of a spectrum of ground data imperfections on the estimation of the producer’s and user’s accuracy of change as well as of change extent. Simulated data were used since this ensured that the actual properties of the data were known and to exclude effects due to other sources of ground <b>reference</b> <b>data</b> error; although the impacts of simulated <b>reference</b> <b>data</b> on two real confusion matrices is also illustrated. The imperfections evaluated ranged from the inclusion of small amounts of known error into the ground <b>reference</b> <b>data</b> through to the extreme situation in which ground data were absent. The results show that even small amounts of error in the ground <b>reference</b> <b>data</b> can introduce large error into studies of land cover change by remote sensing and reinforce the desire to avoid the expression ground truth as this might imply that the data are a gold standard reference. The effect of <b>reference</b> <b>data</b> imperfections was dependent on the degree of association between the errors in the cross tabulated data sets. For example, in the scenarios investigated, a 10 % error in the <b>reference</b> <b>data</b> set introduced an under-estimation of the producer’s accuracy of 18. 5 % if the errors were independent but an over-estimation of the producer’s accuracy of 12. 3 % if the errors were correlated. The magnitude of the mis-estimation of the producer’s accuracy was also a function of the amount of change and greatest at low levels of change. The amount of land cover change estimated also varied greatly as a function of ground <b>reference</b> <b>data</b> error. Some possible methods to reduce or even remove the impacts of ground <b>reference</b> <b>data</b> error were illustrated. These ranged from simple algebraic means to estimate the actual values of accuracy and change extent if the imperfections were known through to a latent class analysis that allowed the assessment of classification accuracy and estimation of change extent without the use of ground <b>reference</b> <b>data</b> if the underlying model is defined appropriately...|$|R
