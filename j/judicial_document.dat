2500|$|Contemporary {{documents}} {{of the reign of}} Ramiro III of León use the magnified titles basileus and magnus rex ("great king"). The former is a Latinisation of the Greek for [...] "king" [...] and was the title employed by the Byzantine Emperors. To western European ears it had an imperial inflection. During the regency of Ramiro's aunt, the nun Elvira Ramírez, the king confirmed a document of 1 May 974 as [...] "Flavius Ramiro, prince, anointed great basileus in the kingdom ... I confirm with my own hand. Elvira, basilea, paternal aunt of the king". The Roman personal name Flavius, which originally meant [...] "blond", was popular among Romanised barbarians, and the kings of the Visigoths took to using it as a Byzantine-sounding title, to give themselves legitimacy. Its use in a document of the tenth century harkens back to Visigothic rule and peninsular unity.

5000|$|After {{the death}} of Raymond, his widow Urraca donated a Galician monastery to the Archdiocese of Santiago de Compostela, signing the charter, dated 13 December 1107, as imperatoris filia et totius gallecie domina. The {{important}} Galician bishops of Lugo, Mondoñedo, Tui, and Ourense, along with Pedro Fróilaz and the Asturian magnate Suero Vermúdez were present to confirm the donation, which was probably designed to secure the support of Diego Gelmírez for Urraca's rule in Galicia. In 1107 Pedro also confirmed a royal donation to the monastery of Caabeiro, signing as [...] "Count Pedro of Galicia", with his two eldest sons beside him, although the comital title (count) and the territorial designation (Galicia) were not directly connected. It {{is not clear whether}} he was named as Raymond's successor in Galicia by Alfonso VI. The authors of the Historia compostelana certainly did not recognise it, but perhaps for partisan reasons. Beginning in 1109, however, Pedro's power and influence in Galicia was such that he was calling himself [...] "Count of Galicia" [...] (Gallecie comes), although he did not control the entire province. This had occurred by 22 July, shortly after {{the death of}} Alfonso VI and the succession of Urraca, who was his heiress after the death of Sancho Alfónsez at the Battle of Uclés (1108). He continued using this title until 1122. A <b>judicial</b> <b>document,</b> and thus one not having royal approval in its particulars, dated 1 November 1109 refers to [...] "duke Don Pedro Fróilaz who is ruling the nearby territory of Sobrado". A royal charter dated 23 May 1121 and calling Pedro a count in maritimis ("in the maritime province") is probably an accurate description of the realm of his public authority: the Atlantic coastlands of Galicia, specifically those north of the river Tambre and encompassing A Coruña. It is a sign of his fame that he was referred to as Petro Galliciensi comite ("Pedro, Galician count") in a letter from William IX, Duke of Aquitaine, to Diego Gelmírez on the occasion of his pilgrimage to Santiago.|$|E

40|$|Document {{drafting}} is {{an essential}} component of judicial problem solving. This paper distinguishes several classes of judicial documents based on (1) the stage of the judicial process in which they are created, (2) the complexity of the documents, and (3) the party who drafts the documents: a judge, judicial support personnel, or a litigant. Three approaches to automated document drafting are identified and the applicability of these approaches to each class of <b>judicial</b> <b>document</b> is described. The paper concludes with a description of several implemented prototype systems for drafting judicial documents at various stages of the judicial process. 1 Introduction Judicial reasoning {{is one of the most}} challenging and complex legal activities.

40|$|Document {{drafting}} is {{a central}} judicial problem-solving activity. Development of automated systems to assist <b>judicial</b> <b>document</b> drafting has been impeded {{by the absence of}} an explicit model of (1) the connection between the document drafter's goals and the text intended to achieve those goals, and (2) the rhetorical constraints expressing the stylistic and discourse conventions of the document's genre. This paper proposes a model in which the drafter's goals and the stylistic and discourse conventions are represented in a discourse structure consisting of a tree of illocutionary and rhetorical operators with document text as leaves. A document grammar based on the discourse structures of a representative set of documents can be used to synthesize a wide range of additional documents from sets of case facts. The applicability of this model to a representative class of judicial orders [...] -jurisdictional show-cause orders [...] -is demonstrated by illustrating (1) the analysis of show-cause orde [...] ...|$|E
40|$|From a {{close reading}} of the {{original}} manuscript of the play Processo Karamazov o La leggenda del grande inquisitore (“The Karamazov Trial or The Legend of the Grand Inquisitor”) held in the Diego Fabbri archive, Antonella Cavazza has obtained information that has enabled her to identify the translation of Brothers Karamazov used by the Italian playwright Diego Fabbri, who {{had no knowledge of}} Russian. She has been able to confirm that Fabbri’s play was based on the Italian version of Brothers Karamazov (I fratelli Karamazov, transl. A. Polledro, Mursia, Milano 1958). Moreo- ver, Cavazza has analysed Fabbri’s usage and re-elaboration of Polledro’s translation of Dostoevskij’s novel, whilst always taking the original Russian into account. A collation of passages shows that Fabbri took Polledro’s translation literally, giving dramatic shape to something which was writ- ten from a narrative perspective. In Fabbri’s play, The Legend of the Grand Inquisitor does not have merely an explanatory function as in Dostoevskij’s text. On the contrary, in Fabbri’s play the “poem” composed by Ivan becomes a <b>judicial</b> <b>document.</b> Even though there are notable changes, Fabbri’s text retains the legend of the little onion...|$|E
