500|$|For {{the first}} time in any of his works {{involving}} amateurs, Britten envisaged a large complement of child performers among his orchestral forces, led by what Graham described as [...] "the professional stiffening" [...] of a piano duet, string quintet (two violins, viola, cello and bass), recorder and a timpanist. The young musicians play a variety of instruments, including a full string ensemble with each section led {{by a member of the}} professional string quintet. The violins are further divided into parts of different levels of difficulty, from the simplest (mostly playing open strings) to those able to play in third position. The recorders should be led by an accomplished soloist able to flutter-tongue; bugles, played in the original production by boys from a local school band, are played as the children representing animals march into the ark, and at the climax of the opera. The child percussionists, led by a professional timpanist, play various exotic and invented percussion instruments: the score itself specifies sandpaper ("two pieces of sandpaper attached to blocks of wood and rubbed together"), and [...] "Slung Mugs", the latter used to represent the first drops of rain. Britten originally had the idea of striking teacups with a spoon, but having failed to make this work, he sought Imogen Holst's advice. She recalled that [...] "by great good fortune <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>once</b> had to teach Women's Institute percussion groups during a wartime 'social half hour', so I was able to take him into my kitchen and show him how a row of china mugs hanging on a length of string could be hit with a large wooden spoon.|$|E
2500|$|Lilburne {{spent his}} exile in the Netherlands at Bruges and elsewhere, where he {{published}} a vindication of himself, and {{an attack on}} the government. In his hostility to the army leaders Lilburne had often contrasted the present governors unfavourably with Charles I. Now he frequented the society of cavaliers of note, such Lords Hopton, Colepeper, and Percy. If he were furnished with ten thousand pounds, he undertook to overthrow Cromwell, the Parliament, and the Council of State, within six months. [...] "I know not," [...] he was heard to say, [...] "why I should not vye with Cromwell, since <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>once</b> as great a power as he had, and greater too, and am as good a gentleman". But {{with the exception of the}} Duke of Buckingham, none of the royalists placed any confidence in him.|$|E

I brought the volume with me on my next visit (I got it prettily bound, first, {{to make it look}} less dry and more inviting); and as we strolled about the Common, I showed her an old housekeeping-book of my aunt's, and gave her a set of tablets, and a pretty little pencil-case and box of leads, to practise housekeeping with.|$|E
