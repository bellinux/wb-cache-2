Fracture surface analysis showed that the scatter was due to incipient melting in the grain boundary region. The melting contributed to low fracture strain but had only a small on the <b>incipient</b> <b>cracking</b> strain. Gleeble tests, which could be interrupted by water quenching, were used to study the incipient intergranular melting of Inconel 718. This modified weld simulation test provided a sufficiently rapid quench to preserve the intergranular microstructure created during incipient melting. This structure was studied both microscopically and with energy dispensive X-ray analysis.

Results show that delamination of inclusions upon compression may provide nucleation sites for damage initiation {{in the form of}} crack tip production. However, under tension the material propagates cracks in a mixed shear localization and mode-I ductile tearing and cracking. Cracks tips appear to link up through regions of severe, shear dominated plastic flow. Shock recovery experiments were conducted on a 50 mm single stage light gas gun. Serial metallographic sectioning was conducted on the recovered samples to characterize the bulk response of the sample. Experiments show delaminated inclusions due to uniaxial compression without damage propagation. Further results show the propagation of the damage through tensile loading to the incipient state, illustrating ductile processes coupled with mixed mode-I tensile ductile tearing, shear localization, and mode-I cracking in depleted uranium...|$|E
40|$|To {{the extent}} that it {{provides}} a potential low energy route for crack propagation the intermetallic compound that forms at the interface between a tin-based solder and the substrate can {{play a critical role in}} determining the likelihood of joint failure in impact loading such as can occur when portable devices are accidentally dropped. While it has been clearly documented in the standard equilibrium phase diagrams the implication of the allotropic change in the Cu 6 Sn 5 intermetallic from a closepacked hexagonal to monoclinic crystal structure at 186 ° C with an accompanying 2. 15 % increase in volume has been found to have implications for the mechanical integrity of the interfacial intermetallic that were not previously recognized. In this paper the authors report the effect of a trace addition of Ni in permanently stabilizing the high-temperature form of the Cu 6 Sn 5 to room temperature on the response to high speed shear of Sn- 0. 7 Cu spheres reflowed to a copper substrate.

40|$|During {{recent years}} it has been {{observed}} an increasing attention to the shrinkage of concrete by considering it as an action that cannot be neglected in structural design. In fact, the distance between the joints of the buildings or walls depends significantly on the shrinkage of the material. In design of floors, the shrinkage is the main cause of cracking that has generated numerous disputes between customers and manufacturers. Shrinkage makes cracks when some restraint prevents the free deformation of concrete. Therefore, the risk of shrinkage cracking should be evaluated through restrained shrinkage tests since free shrinkage tests are not representative. National technical codes and international experimental investigations of drying shrinkage of concrete, do not provide direct information on the risk of cracking when the material is subjected to boundary conditions. In fact, the reference standard method for the evaluation of the cracking risk is based on the so-called "ring test" (ASTM C 1581) which, however, mainly detects the time of <b>incipient</b> <b>cracking</b> in concrete but does not provide direct measures of the cracking risk or indications on the behavior of post-cracking material failure. The present work describes the development of a test method which aims to detect the post-cracking behavior of the material in terms of crack opening displacement with time, in addition to the time of initiation of cracking. The method developed has also proved suitable to appreciate significant differences in performance of concretes characterized by different potential risks of crackin...|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} results of six impact {{fragmentation}} experiments carried out with free-falling macroscopic targets of different compositions and shapes, and with projectile velocities close to 9 km/sec, i. e., {{significantly higher than the}} sound velocity in the target materials. The data have been examined by deriving the mass and shape distributions of the fragments, by reconstructing two of the shattered targets in order to study the geometry of the fracture surfaces, and by analyzing the properties of the fine-grained high-velocity ejecta. The fragment mass distributions show clearly that the degree of target fragmentation depends strongly on the impact parameter. Apart from the few largest fragments, these distributions are well represented by two power laws with different exponents, connected at a size of about 1 cm. The fragment shapes are generally in good agreement with those observed in previous experiments, and no significant shape vs size dependence has been found down to sizes of the order of 0. 1 mm. The fragments tend to become larger and possibly more irregular in shape when they are generated farther from the impact point. The fracture surfaces are oriented roughly along meridians and parallels (with the pole at the impact point) when the target is spherical, but are clustered around the symmetry planes when the target is ellipsoidal. Fine-grained particles, with typical sizes and velocities of 0. 01 cm and 1 km/sec, respectively, are ejected at low-elevation angles and in a rather collimated way, starting both from the neighborhood of the impact point and from regions of <b>incipient</b> <b>cracking.</b> Particular {{attention has been paid to}} a comparison between these results and the observed properties of the outcomes of asteroidal catastrophic collisions, like the dynamical families and the small inner planet crossing objects. While the collisional theory for the origin of families is fully consistent with the experimental results (with some indication for a significant role of the parent asteroid's self-gravitation), the elongated shapes of several Apollo-Amor objects are much rarer among the laboratory fragments, and thus appear to require a different explanation. © 1986...|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} of asphaltenes in heavy oil {{is related to}} its high viscosity which is a major constraint in heavy oil processing and transportation. Moreover, {{problems associated with the}} deposition of asphaltenes at different stages of the heavy oil refining steps increase the cost of heavy oil processing. In this research project, we have achieved viscosity reduction of heavy oil by treating it through the novel JetShear destructuring process. Subsequently we have studied the adsorption of the asphaltenes over specific solid adsorbents. Characterization of the raw and treated heavy oil has been conducted. We have experimentally shown that the JetShear destructuring process reduces diluent requirements (up to 50 %), decreases the initial viscosity of heavy oil and lowers the oil density (increasing its API degree) thus providing a solution for pipeline transportation. The asphaltenes content of the treated product oil was also found to decrease slightly during the JetShear destructuring as per SARA fractions determination. This implies <b>incipient</b> <b>cracking</b> of the heavy oil induced by the JetShear treatment. Adsorption of asphaltenes over practical adsorbents was conducted to determine whether asphaltenes could be selectively removed from the oil aiming at establishing the basis of a process. that could lead to breakthrough technology in heavy oil processing. Investigations of adsorption of asphaltenes were centered onto two objectives: firstly, asphaltenes characterization based on molecular size and separation of asphaltenes into acidic and basic fractions; secondly, asphaltenes interaction with adsorbents was studied. Experiments using virgin and destructured heavy oil showed that asphaltenes were preferentially removed following a multilayer adsorption model in the pores with significant and practical yields (0. 25 ~ 0. 36 g asphaltenes/g adsorbent) in the 150 [degree centigrade] range. Maximum uptake required 200 min of contact time at heavy oil/adsorbents ratios in the 5 : 1 range. The adsorption reduced the asphaltenes remaining in the treated heavy oil by allowing the asphaltenes to lodge in the pores as well as getting adsorbed on the surfaces of the adsorbent particularly the lower molecular weight asphaltenes. The combined treatment (i. e. destructuring and adsorption) also changed the functional group of the asphaltenes, and induced loss of heteroatoms lowering sulfur content in the final oil...|$|E
40|$|A {{probabilistic}} method {{to predict the}} crack formation in polycrystalline materials with a random microstructure under cyclic loading is developed. In particular, transgranular crack growth in 3 D grain structures generated randomly by the Voronoï process is considered. The potential crack extension planes in the individual grains are dependent on the different grain orientations and the crystal structure of the considered material. Under cyclic loading fatigue cracks initiate and propagate along the slip planes of the crystal structure. For this reason, an energy-based criterion is used in order to describe the successive material damage under cyclic loading which is completely projected into the crack extension planes and finally causes the crack propagation. Subsequently, the computation of the crack path {{in a number of}} randomly generated grain structure models provides a raw data base in order to determine probability distributions of the number of cycles up to a pre-defined crack depth.

Focusing on this challenge, a new approach based on proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) is proposed for multicrack localization in rotors. A two-disc rotor-bearing system with breathing cracks is established by the finite element method and simulated sensors are distributed along the rotor to obtain the steady-state transverse responses required by POD.

The specimens were subjected to three-point bend impact loading under a drop weight tower. High-speed photographs of the CGS interferograms were analyzed to determine the crack tip location, the velocity and the dynamic fracture toughness as a function of time. Post-mortem examination of the specimens revealed the fractography of the fracture surfaces, including the development of shear lips. In a parallel numerical phase of the study, fracture has been modeled by recourse to an irreversible cohesive law embedded into cohesive elements. These cohesive elements govern all aspects of the separation and closure of the <b>incipient</b> <b>cracks.</b> The cohesive behavior of the material is assumed to be rate independent.

30|$|During the {{condition}} monitoring of a planetary gearbox, features are extracted from raw data for a fault diagnosis. However, different features have different sensitivity for identifying different fault types, and thus, {{the selection of}} a sensitive feature subset from an entire feature set and retaining as much of the class discriminatory information as possible has a directly effect on the accuracy of the classification results. In this paper, an improved hybrid feature selection technique (IHFST) that combines a distance evaluation technique (DET), Pearson’s correlation analysis, and an ad hoc technique is proposed. In IHFST, a temporary feature subset without irrelevant features is first selected according to the distance evaluation criterion of DET, and the Pearson’s correlation analysis and ad hoc technique are then employed to find and remove redundant features in the temporary feature subset, respectively, and hence, a sensitive feature subset without irrelevant or redundant features is selected from the entire feature set. Further, the k-means clustering method is applied to classify the different kinds of health conditions. The effectiveness of the proposed method was validated through several experiments carried out on a planetary gearbox with <b>incipient</b> <b>cracks</b> seeded in the tooth root of the sun gear, planet gear, and ring gear. The results show that the proposed method can successfully distinguish the different health conditions of a planetary gearbox, and achieves a better classification performance than other methods. This study proposes a sensitive feature subset selection method that achieves an obvious improvement in terms of the accuracy of the fault classification.|$|R
40|$|Atomic force microscopy, a powerful, {{high-resolution}} {{imaging technique}} {{for determining the}} structure of surfaces in gaseous and liquid environments, {{was used to examine}} the reactivity of an electropolished surface of a naturally aged alu-minum-copper-magnesium alloy (2024 -T 3) in aqueous hydrochloric acid (0. 01, 0. 1, and 1 M). When first exposed to acid, the matrix dissolved uniformly. Dissolution then accelerated and pits formed predominately {{in the vicinity of the}} second-phase precipitates. The pits developed into characteristic intergranular damage: i. e., elongated pits (<b>incipient</b> corrosion <b>cracks)</b> along grain boundaries. Postexperimental ex situ energy dispersive x-ray analysis and Auger electron spec-troscopy were employed to characterize the composition of the various surface features of corroded samples...|$|R
