5|$|Ganymede {{also has}} polar caps, likely {{composed}} of water <b>frost.</b> The <b>frost</b> extends to 40° latitude. These polar caps were first {{seen by the}} Voyager spacecraft. Theories on {{the formation of the}} caps include the migration of water to higher latitudes and bombardment of the ice by plasma. Data from Galileo suggests the latter is correct. The presence of a magnetic field on Ganymede results in more intense charged particle bombardment of its surface in the unprotected polar regions; sputtering then leads to redistribution of water molecules, with <b>frost</b> migrating to locally colder areas within the polar terrain.|$|E
5|$|In 1966, Barker got his {{break with}} the satirical sketch series The <b>Frost</b> Report, having been {{recommended}} for the show by producer James Gilbert. The show starred David <b>Frost,</b> John Cleese and Barker's future comedy partner Ronnie Corbett, whom he had met in 1963 when Corbett was the barman at the Buckstone Club near the Haymarket Theatre, and the two became friends. Corbett stated in his autobiography that the two had gravitated towards each other because of their similar backgrounds; neither had attended university, {{while many of the}} other <b>Frost</b> Report cast and writers had. Each episode of the show, which was performed and broadcast live, was focused on a single topic and principally revolved around a continuous monologue from <b>Frost,</b> with sketches from Barker, Corbett and Cleese as the show went on. Barker starred alongside Cleese and Corbett in The <b>Frost</b> Reports best known sketch, which satirised the British class system, with Barker representing the middle class.|$|E

5|$|Nebraska {{began its}} {{possession}} at its five-yard line after the returner was tackled for a three-yard loss and the Cornhuskers were assessed six yards of penalties during the return. <b>Frost</b> threw an incomplete pass, Schuster ran for four yards, then <b>Frost</b> completed a 14-yard pass to Shevin Wiggins {{for a first}} down at the Nebraska 23-yard line. <b>Frost</b> continued the drive by earning nine yards on an option, then Schuster picked up three yards for another first down. Sims followed this by gaining 22 yards and two first downs on the next three plays. <b>Frost</b> then completed a 17-yard throw to Jeff Lake for a first down at Tech's 26-yard line. Just outside Tech's red zone, however, the drive petered out. Sims was stopped for a short loss, <b>Frost</b> ran for eight yards, and threw an incomplete pass, causing a fourth down. Kris Brown kicked his second field goal of the game, this time a 37-yard kick, which was successful. With 7:52 remaining in the game, Nebraska had a 3421 lead.|$|E

5|$|During {{his life}} Etty had {{acquired}} followers such as Irish painters William Mulready and Daniel Maclise, but both rejected Etty's preoccupation with nudes. Mulready painted nudes but became {{best known for}} domestic genre paintings, while Maclise chose to specialise in more traditional history paintings and exhibited only one nude work in his career. One of the few painters who consciously attempted to continue Etty's style after his death was William Edward <b>Frost,</b> who had been an acquaintance of Etty's since 1825. In the early 1830s <b>Frost</b> painted on commission for Thomas Potts (whose 1833 commission of Etty to paint his daughter Elizabeth's portrait had been Etty's first significant portrait commission), and later was commissioned on Etty's recommendation to paint a portrait of Etty's cousin Thomas Bodley. <b>Frost</b> successfully imitated Etty throughout his career, {{to the extent that}} his figure studies and Etty's are often misattributed to each other. Although <b>Frost</b> eventually became a Royal Academician in 1870, by this time Etty's style of painting had badly fallen out of fashion.|$|E

50|$|Typically, {{the cakes}} used in coconut cake are either white or yellow cakes. While some recipes {{do not call}} for coconut flavor in the cake itself, there are others that replace the milk with coconut milk and/or use coconut extract. It is also common to brush the cakes with a simple syrup {{to make it more}} moist. Often the cake layers are filled with either a white <b>frosting</b> or coconut pastry cream. Traditionally, the cake is <b>frosted</b> with a 7-minute <b>frosting,</b> but cream cheese icings and buttercreams are not uncommon. Like the cakes, coconut flavor is not always a must in the <b>frosting.</b> One {{constant}} characteristic of coconut cake is the use of shredded coconut (often toasted and/or sweetened) to cover the <b>frosting.</b>|$|R
