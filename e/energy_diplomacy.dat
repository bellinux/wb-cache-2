A Computable General Equilibrium Model was set up to simulate the influence of levy carbon tax on China's macro-economy, energy saving and CO 2 emission reduction. The results suggest that low rate carbon tax was a feasible option in China's near future. Lower carbon tax rate of RMB yuans 20 /t C has smaller influence on the economic development of China 1, but can lead to obvious CO 2 emission reduction. In order to build China’s carbon tax system, implement the targets of energy-saving and emission reduction and reduce CO 2 emission, the paper designs a carbon tax implementation scheme.

40|$|This {{working paper}} {{examines}} the growing importance of Central Asia in Beijing’s expanding <b>energy</b> <b>diplomacy,</b> focusing on China’s drive to secure external {{oil and gas}} supplies through state-to-state negotiation as well as cooperation within multilateral organizations. Since the late 1990 s, China has been increasing its visibility in Central Asia by means of bilateral energy development deals, including pipeline construction contracts. It has also done so multilaterally, through {{institutions such as the}} Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO). These endeavours constitute a shift towards a more integrated and comprehensive energy policy in the region, and have enabled China to elevate its standing as an energy partner in the region and also react to the growing competition for Central Asian oil and gas supplies and diplomatic influence from the West and from Russia. This working paper begins with an overview of China’s <b>energy</b> <b>diplomacy,</b> followed by a study of the role played by Central Asia in these policies. It then presents bilateral case studies of Chinese relations with Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan, which are swiftly becoming two of China’s key oil and gas suppliers. Finally, the working paper explores the case of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization as a means of facilitating China’s energy policies in Eurasia. Although China has made great inroads in developing energy links with the Caspian region, there remain significant policy obstacles, emanating both from Eurasia and from outside competitors like the USA and Russia. These can be expected to affect Beijing’s <b>energy</b> <b>diplomacy</b> with Central Asia, as well as the overall goal of improved access to continental fossil fuels...|$|E

Indeed, every president since Richard Nixon has labeled America’s overreliance on foreign oil as a strategic liability and promised to put America on the path towards energy independence.

Despite several presidential initiatives, American imports of crude oil rose steadily from 1. 93 billion barrels in 1970 to a peak of 3. 69 billion in 2005. 2 A 2011 CBS News story summarized the trend with the damning headline: “Fuelish Dreams: Every President Tries to Break U.

The United States is in the midst of a “Shale Revolution” in which domestic sources of shale oil and natural gas are rapidly transforming the nation’s energy outlook. Soaring U.

40|$|In the 21 st century, global energy {{challenges}} {{have led}} most countries to pursue energy security, specifically access to oil, {{as a strategic}} foreign policy goal. The diplomacy involved in realising this goal is complex and highly competitive in light of geo-political dynamics marked by a tight market, instability in oil supplying countries and the politicisation of the oil trade. South Africa faces huge socio-economic challenges, rooted in its history of apartheid, and as a net importer of crude oil, energy security {{is critical to the}} country s development. In the past 21 years, since the inception of its democratic order, South Africa has advanced strategic diplomatic partnerships with selected oil-producing countries in order to secure access to this key resource. These initiatives have yielded mixed results due to a variety of factors. Given this context, this study examines South Africa s <b>energy</b> <b>diplomacy</b> within the global energy discourse. The extent to which South Africa s post-apartheid diplomacy has been positioned to secure the country s supply of oil is investigated, with particular focus on how South Africa has used structured bilateral mechanisms to access oil in Africa and the Middle East the two regions from which it imports the largest quantity of its crude oil. The study also assesses the risks associated with exploring access to oil in these regions. It argues that although South Africa s <b>energy</b> <b>diplomacy</b> has contributed to the supply of oil in the past 21 years, long term security of supply cannot be guaranteed without a robust diplomatic strategy that mitigates both internal and external risk factors and locates diversification of supply sources as its central pillar.
