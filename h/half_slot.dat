The servers are marketed with converged network adapters and port virtualization.Around 2010, an extended memory technology expanded the number of memory sockets that can be connected to a single memory channel in some models.A fourth generation {{was announced in}} September 2014.It included an additional [...] "M" [...] series, but the M-series was cancelled in 2016 after poor sales.|$|E
50|$|Turner and Gordon E. Eubanks, Jr., then {{chairman}} of Symantec Corporation, agreed {{to form a}} new division of Symantec, and Eubanks delegated the choice of name to Turner. Turner chose the name Turner Hall Publishing, to be a new division of Symantec devoted to publishing third-party software and hardware. The objective of the division was to diversify revenues and accelerate the growth of Symantec. Turner chose the name Turner Hall Publishing, using his last name and that of Dottie Hall (Director of Marketing Communications) in order to convey the sense of a stable, long established, company. Turner Hall Publishing's first offering was Note-It, a notation utility add-in for Lotus 1-2-3, which was developed by David Whitney, and licensed to Symantec. Its second product was the Turner Hall Card, which was a 256k RAM, <b>half</b> <b>slot</b> memory card, initially made to inexpensively increase the available memory for Symantec's flagship product, Q&A. The Turner Hall division also marketed the card as a standalone product. Turner Hall's third product, also a 1-2-3 add-in was SQZ! a Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet compression utility developed by Chris Graham Synex Systems. In the summer of 1986 Eubanks and Turner recruited Tom Byers from Digital Research, to expand the Turner Hall Publishing product family and lead the Turner Hall effort.|$|E
40|$|A closely-packed ultrawideband (UWB) multiple- input multiple-output (MIMO) /diversity antenna (of two elements) {{with a size}} of 25 mm by 40 mm is {{proposed}} for USB dongle applications. Wideband isolation can be achieved through the different patterns and polarizations of the two antenna elements. Moreover, the slot that is formed between the monopole and the ground plane of the <b>half</b> <b>slot</b> antenna is conveniently used to further enhance the isolation at the lower frequencies and to provide an additional resonance at one antenna element {{in order to increase}} its bandwidth. The underlying mechanisms of the antenna’s wide impedance bandwidth and low mutual coupling are analyzed in detail. Based on the measurement results, the proposed antenna can cover the lower UWB band of 3. 1 - 5. 15 GHz, and within the required band, the isolation exceeds 26 dB. The gains and total efficiencies of the two antenna elements are also measured. Furthermore, a chassis mode can be excited when a physical connection is required between the ground planes of the two antenna elements. Without affecting the performance of the <b>half</b> <b>slot</b> element, the monopole can now cover the band of 1. 78 - 3 GHz, apart from the UWB band. The proposed antenna structure is found to provide good MIMO/diversity performance, with very low envelope correlation of less than 0. 1 across the UWB band...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} relay-assisted transmission for cellular networks. In the considered system, a source node together with n relay nodes are selected in a proportionally fair (PF) manner to transmit to the base station (BS), which uses the maximal ratio combining (MRC) to combine the signals received from the source node in the first <b>half</b> <b>slot</b> and the n relay nodes in the second <b>half</b> <b>slot</b> for successful reception. The proposed algorithm incorporates the PF criterion and cooperative diversity, and is called proportionally fair cooperation (PFC). Compared with the proportional fair scheduling (PFS) algorithm, PFC provides improved efficiency and fairness. The ordinary differential equation (ODE) analysis used to study PFS cannot be used for PFC, otherwise one has to solve {{a large number of}} nonlinear and interrelated ODE equations which is time-prohibited. In this paper, we present a mathematical framework for the performance of PFC. The cornerstone of our framework is a realistic yet simple model that captures node cooperation, fading, and fair resource allocation-induced dependencies. We obtain analytical expressions for the throughput gain of PFC over traditional PFS without node cooperation. Compared with the highly time-consuming ordinary differential equation (ODE) analysis, our formulae are intuitive yet easy to evaluate numerically. To our knowledge, {{it is the first time}} that a closed-form expression is obtained for the throughput of relay-assisted transmission in a cellular network with the PF constraint.

40|$|Broadcast {{nature of}} {{wireless}} networks can be exploited {{to provide a}} flexible transmission, especially in multicast service. The potential relay then is capable to participate in message forwarding. In this paper, we first presents a network coding based cooperative (NCBC) multicast scheme exploiting limited feedback, where the source transmits two separate signals to multiple destinations in two successive half slots. The relay may combine the signals if it received two signals correctly and forward it to destinations in the next <b>half</b> <b>slot.</b> The destinations, therefore, can recover signals either from direct transmission or the relay forwarding. The performance analysis on the developed NCBC multicast protocol is given {{in the viewpoint of}} physical layer, such as the outage probability and diversity order. It is demonstrated that the NCBC multicast scheme can work better than the source direct multicast in terms of outage probability. Meanwhile, the NCBC multicast scheme can achieve full diversity gain(diversity two for one relay case). Comparing with the known relay schemes, i. e., amplify-andforward (AF) and selection decode-and-forward cooperation schemes, it shows that the NCBC multicast scheme achieves almost the same outage performance with relatively less bandwidth and energy consumption. </p...|$|E

40|$|A {{microstrip}} antenna produces a multiband response due to various modifications {{done to the}} patch. These modifications include adding multiple stubs on the patch, or cutting multiple slots on the patch or using combination of stubs and slots. In this paper, an analysis to study the multi-band response in stub loaded half U-slot and rectangular cut rectangular {{microstrip antenna}} is presented. The paper begins with an analysis of <b>half</b> U <b>slot</b> cut and rectangular slot cut antenna which yields a triple band response. Here variations in current distribution and resonance frequencies are studied with respect to variation in length of the rectangular slot and then the position with <b>half</b> U <b>slot</b> cut dimensions kept constant. The paper then moves on to study the effect of variation of <b>half</b> U <b>slot</b> cut dimensions with rectangular slot length and position kept constant. Lastly the analysis of adding a stub on to this dual slot configuration is explained in detail. The proposed analysis gives an insight into the functioning of slot cut stub loaded multi-band rectangular microstrip antennas and will help to design them at desired frequencies...|$|R

This study evaluated two unique corrugated container designs, Kisch Full Circle Tray (FCT) and Single V Kisch Bliss, which are both viable designs available to replace the presently used styles of boxes for produce distribution. This paper presents the compression strength results of Telescoping HSC containers as compared to two possible replacements and the Diagonal Corner Bliss designs when stored under standard, refrigerated and tropical conditions. It also compares the material savings and the life-cycle environmental impacts for the three designs against the Telescoping HSC design. Comparing the average overall peak forces, across all three environmental conditions of the Telescoping HSC boxes {{to that of the}} three designs, it was concluded that the Kisch FCT boxes were approximately 17 % weaker, while providing material savings of over 14 %; the Diagonal Corner Bliss boxes were approximately 9 % weaker, while providing material savings of almost 22 % and the Single V Kisch Bliss boxes were approximately 14 % stronger, while providing material savings of over 19 %. Savings in material ranging from 14 to 22 % for the three designs tested, translates into significant energy savings, relative optimization of natural resources, reductions in green house gas emissions and relative minimization of waste water and solid waste generated during production in comparison to the Telescoping HSC style boxes...|$|R
