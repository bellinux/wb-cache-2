[...] 3 pages, 3 figuresThe recognition, mapping {{and dating}} of marine {{terraces}} in the SW corner of Portugal {{show that this}} region is being subjected to uplift, {{at a faster rate}} than other regions immediately to the north or to the east. In this study we investigate the connection between the Nubia-Iberia convergence and the uplift of the Algarve basin by modelling the flexural <b>deformation</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>compression</b> along a vertical section of the lithosphere across the Algarve’s margin. The model is based on recent regional tectonic and stratigraphic interpretations which helped to define the limits of the several geological domains present in the area. Our main goal is to determine the amount of tectonic uplift that can attributed to the Nubia-Iberia convergence. By exploring the interplay between the amount of uplift and the rheology of the main structural domains we also aim to place constraints on the mechanical behaviour of the lithosphereThis research contribution is supported by the FCT project IDL-FCT-UID/GEO/ 50019 / 2013 Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Centrifugation {{provides}} a fast method to measure soil water retention curves {{over a wide}} moisture range. However, deformation of soil structure may occur at high angular velocities in the centrifuge. The objective {{of this study was}} to capture these changes in soil structure with X-ray microtomography and to measure local deformations via digital volume correlation. Two samples were investigated that differ in texture and rock content. A detailed analysis of the pore space reveals an interplay between shrinkage due to drying and soil compaction due to compression. Macroporosity increases at moderate angular velocity because of crack formation due to moisture release. At higher angular velocities, corresponding to capillary pressure of ψ [*]<[*]− 100  kPa, macroporosity decreases again because of structure <b>deformation</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>compression.</b> While volume changes due to swelling clay minerals are immanent in any drying process, the compaction of soil is a specific drawback of the centrifugation method. A new protocol for digital volume correlation was developed to analyze the spatial heterogeneity of deformation. In both samples the displacement of soil constituents is highest in the top part of the sample and exhibits high lateral variability explained by the spatial distribution of macropores in the sample. Centrifugation should therefore only be applied after the completion of all other hydraulic or thermal experiments, or any other analysis that depends on the integrity of soil structure...|$|E

The upper plate, which includes {{an array of}} ultra wideband antennas, {{is attached to a}} pressing tool, whereas the lower plate is fixed. Each of the antennas at the top plate is used to send an ultra wideband pulse to penetrate the breast and measure the backscattered pulse. Two sets of measurements are taken; one before and another after pressing the breast. A sliding window cross-correlation is then performed on the two sets of data to get the time delay of each segment of the scattered pulse after compression. That time delay is then employed to get a three dimensional strain image of the breast.

40|$|Poor produce {{quality and}} {{inconsistent}} supply currently impede smallholder vegetable growers in Fiji from accessing high-value domestic markets. One proposed option {{to overcome these}} constraints is to adopt a more centralised approach to product grading and storage, based around a network of regional ripening and packaging facilities. In terms of tomato growers, this would necessitate reconfiguring existing postharvest supply chains, removing the need for on-farm ripening, and transport of harvest-green mature fruit. This preliminary study was undertaken {{to determine whether the}} alternative transport of mature hard-green fruit would affect the incidence of bruising and impact damage. Fruits of four ripening stages were commercially transported to Suva municipal market, and then stored for seven days at 20 - 28 °C (ambient market storage conditions). Fruit <b>deformation</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>compression</b> in the carton was significantly less in mature-hard green fruits. We found that mature hard-green stage was least susceptible to bruising (8 %) compared with turning stage tomatoes (12 %), commercially traded fruit (16 %) and light-red (21 %). For mature green tomatoes most damage (36 %) was in the middle inner level of the carton. Light red and turning tomatoes placed in the bottom inside layer displayed highest level of damage, 62 and 46 % respectively. Based on this preliminary trial, transporting hardgreen tomatoes is likely {{to reduce the risk of}} in-transit postharvest damage, compared to the current smallholder practices of transporting fully-ripe fruit...|$|E
40|$|A {{blind rivet}} nut is a {{mechanical}} fastener enabling a fast installation from one side. The setting process relies on plastic <b>deformation</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> axial <b>compression</b> of the rivet nut {{in such a way}} that a bulge is formed on the underside of the work piece. The mechanical performance of such a connection partly depends on the final geometry of the rivet nut after forming. In this contribution, the torque-to-turn resistance of an internally threaded round tubular rivet is studied with the aid of finite element techniques. A strategy is presented to simulate the setting process involving large plastic strains and contact pressures. An FE-based inverse method was used to identify the local plastic material properties of the {{blind rivet nut}}. The forming simulation was validated in terms of predicted shape of the rivet nut and the evolution of the setting force. A quasi-static FE model using the shape and solution variables of the deformed rivet nut was used to reproduce the torque-to-turn resistance as a function of the setting force. Finally, the aim is to apply the presented modelling strategy to explore innovative possibilities to increase the torque-to-turn resistance of a blind rivet nut. status: accepte...|$|R
40|$|The {{topic of}} this PhD is to {{investigate}} materials interfaces under {{the application of}} com-pressive forces and dynamic friction. Friction studies are important in applications for high-speed machining and ballistic penetration modelling, two areas where {{it is important to}} understand the behaviour of rapidly moving interfaces. Gaining insight into the velocity dependence of the effective tangential force, and its time-evolution, under various external loads is also of particular interest. It is important to understand on an atomic and/or molec-ular level the fundamentals of tribological processes. Some of the processes investigated in this thesis include plastic <b>deformation</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> high <b>compression,</b> the response of materials when sliding occurs in terms of temperature variation across the interface and its relation-ship with atomic diffusion. Moreover, the materials dependence on operating conditions of temperature, loading and dynamic friction are factors that ultimately determine the design of tribological systems. In the last few years it has been shown that materials properties depend on the size, as smaller specimens are relatively stronger than larger ones. This thesis is aiming to em-ploy state of the art numerical and theoretical methods, which are vital to give a significant insight and understanding of the fundamental issues concerning dynamic friction of tribo-logical processes at the atomic scale. The mechanical behaviour is investigated in detail to reveal an accurate theoretical description of the frictional force at metallic surfaces. Special consideration is taken into account for the mechanism that causes dissipation in the form of heat. The strong deformation when materials undergo dynamic friction causes energy to dissipate away from the interface at a high rate. Additionally, investigation of the plastic deformation and its variation under conditions prevalent at high speed sliding is carried out. Knowledge of the yield point under these conditions is important to obtain accurate constitutive models for the shear stresses. In-vestigating how the material strength varies under sliding friction and obtaining accurate evaluation of the stresses involved has proved difficult and time consuming. This is primar¬ily attributed to the fact that experiments are difficult to conduct and expensive facilities are required. This thesis focuses on aspects of this complex process with the aid of molecular dynamic simulations. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|A {{combined}} {{experimental and}} computational {{investigation of the}} deformation behavior of pure magnesium single crystal at the micron length scale has been carried out. Employing the recently exploited method of microcompression testing, uniaxial microcompression experiments have been performed on magnesium single crystals with [0001], [2 - 1 - 12], [10 - 11], [11 - 20] and [10 - 10] compression axes. The advantage of the microcompression method over conventional mechanical testing techniques {{is the ability to}} localize a single crystalline volume which is characterizable after deformation. The stress-strain relations resulting from microcompression experiments are presented and discussed in terms of orientation dependent slip activity, twinning mechanisms and an anisotropic size effect. Such a mechanistic picture of the deformation behavior is revealed through SEM, EBSD and TEM characterization of the deformation structures, and further supported by 3 D discrete dislocation dynamics simulations. The [0001], [2 - 1 - 12], and [10 - 11] compression axes results show dislocation plasticity. Specifically, the <b>deformation</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> [0001] <b>compression</b> is governed by pyramidal slip and displays significant hardening and massive unstable shear at stresses above 500 MPa. In the case of the two orientations with compression along an axis 45 degrees to the basal plane, unsurpringly it is found that basal slip dominates the deformation. In contrast, compression along the [11 - 20] and [10 - 10] directions show deformation twinning in addition to dislocation plasticity. In the case of compression along [11 - 20], the twinning leads to easy basal slip, while the twin resultant during compression along [10 - 10] does not lead to easy basal slip. In all cases, a size effect in the stress-strain behavior is observed; the flow stress increases with decreasing column diameter. Furthermore, the extent of the size effect is shown to depend strongly on the number of active slip systems; compression along the [0001] axis is associated with 12 slips systems and displays a saturation of the size effect at a diameter of 10 μm, while the other orientations still show a significant size effect at this diameter. The experimental evidence of an orientation-dependent deformation behavior in flow stress has been investigated by 3 D discrete dislocation dynamics simulations. Here, the code TRIDIS was modified for hcp structure and c/a ratio of Mg. By matching the simulation results to experimental results, some proper constitutive material parameters such as initial dislocation density, dislocation source length, the critical resolved shear stress were suggested. For the case of [0001] and [2 - 1 - 12] orientation, dislocation feature in the pillar during the deformation was exhibited and strain burst was discussed. ...|$|R
