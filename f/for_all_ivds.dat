40|$|In people, {{abnormalities}} in {{vertebral column}} conformation, such as kyphoscoliosis, induce degenerative changes in adjacent intervertebral disc (IVD) structure and composition. It was hypothesised that canine IVDs {{adjacent to a}} vertebral malformation undergo early degeneration. In a blinded retrospective study, thoracic IVD degeneration was evaluated in 14 dogs on magnetic resonance images using Pfirrmann's grade. IVDs adjacent to a vertebral malformation had higher grades of degeneration than non-adjacent IVDs (P[*]&# 60; 0. 0001). There was an age-dependency, with dogs between 1 and 4 years showing higher grade of degeneration in adjacent than non-adjacent IVDs (P[*]&# 60;[*] 0. 0001). Conversely, in older dogs, <b>all</b> <b>IVDs</b> – including the non-adjacents – showed degenerative signs, possibly due to normal aging.

40|$|A revised {{framework}} for the regulation of in vitro diagnostic devices (IVDs) came into force in Australia on July 1, 2010 that aims to 'ensure that public and personal health are adequately protected', but which instead may lead to adverse outcomes in clinical diagnosis and management. The regulatory process aims to regulate <b>all</b> <b>IVDs,</b> including those used by clinical diagnostic laboratories, which are already subject to scrutiny {{as part of the}} current laboratory accreditation process. The IVD regulatory process initiated in Australia is similar to that used in Canada, but different to that currently operating in the USA and Europe. However, it is feasible that other countries will in time adopt a similar regulatory framework, given that many countries are involved in the development process.

40|$|Objectives: Spaceflight {{back pain}} and {{intervertebral}} disc (IVD) herniations cause problems in astronauts. Purpose {{of this study}} was to assess changes in T 2 -relaxation-time through MRI measurements before and after head-down tilt bed-rest, a spaceflight analog. Methods: 8 men participated in the bed-rest study. Subjects remained in 6 ° head down tilt bed-rest in two campaigns of 21 days, and received a nutritional intervention (potassium bicarbonate 90 mmol/d) in a cross-over design. MRI measurements were performed 2 days before bed-rest, as well as one and five days after getting up. Image Segmentation and data analysis were conducted for the IVDs Th 12 /L 1 to L 5 /S 1. Results: 7 subjects, average age of 27. 6 (SD 3. 3) years, completed the study. Results showed a significant increase in T 2 -time in <b>all</b> <b>IVDs</b> (p < 0. 001), more pronounced in the nucleus pulposus than in the annulus fibrosus (p< 0. 001). Oral potassium bicarbonate did not show an effect p= 0. 443). Pfirrmanngrade correlated with the T 2 -time (p< 0. 001).

40|$|Mechanical {{overloading}} of {{the spine}} is associated with low back pain and intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration. How excessive loading elicits degenerative changes in the IVD is poorly understood. Comprehensive knowledge {{of the interaction between}} mechanical loading, cell responses and changes in the extracellular matrix of the disc is needed in order to successfully intervene in this process. The purpose of the current study was to investigate whether dynamic and static overloading affect caprine lumbar discs differently and what mechanisms lead to mechanically induced IVD degeneration. Lumbar caprine IVDs (n = 175) were cultured 7, 14 and 21 days under simulated-physiological loading (control), high dynamic or high static loading. Axial deformation and stiffness were continuously measured. Cell viability, cell density, and gene expression were assessed in the nucleus, inner- and outer annulus. The extracellular matrix (ECM) was analyzed for water, glycosaminoglycan and collagen content. IVD height loss and changes in axial deformation were gradual with dynamic and acute with static overloading. Dynamic overloading caused cell death in <b>all</b> <b>IVD</b> regions, whereas static overloading mostly affected the outer annulus. IVDs expression of catabolic and inflammation-related genes was up-regulated directly, whereas loss of water and glycosaminoglycan were significant only after 21 days. Static and dynami...|$|R

The novel gene identified, called Sickle tail (Skt), {{is composed of}} 19 exons and encodes a protein of 1352 amino acids. Expression of a reporter gene was detected in the notochord during embryogenesis and in the nucleus pulposus of mice. Compression {{of some of the}} nuclei pulposi in the intervertebral discs (IVDs) appeared at embryonic day (E) 17. 5, resulting in a kinky-tail phenotype showing defects in the nucleus pulposus and annulus fibrosus of IVDs in SktGt/Gt mice. These phenotypes were different from those in Danforth's short tail (Sd) mice in which the nucleus pulposus was totally absent and replaced by peripheral fibers similar to those seen in the annulus fibrosus in <b>all</b> <b>IVDs.</b> The Skt gene maps to the proximal part of mouse chromosome 2, near the Sd locus. The genetic distance between them was 0. 95 cM. The number of vertebrae in both [Sd +/+ SktGt] and [Sd SktGt/+ +] compound heterozygotes was less than that of Sd heterozygotes. Furthermore, the enhancer trap locus Etl 4 lacZ, which was previously reported to be an allele of Sd, was located in the third intron of the Skt gene...|$|R
40|$|Lumbar hernias occur {{mostly in}} the posterolateral region of IVDs and {{mechanical}} loading is an important risk factor. Studies show that dynamic and static overloading affect the nucleus and annulus of the IVD differently. We hypothesize there is also variance in the effect of overloading on the IVD's anterior, lateral and posterior annulus, which could explain the predilection of herniations in the posterolateral region. We assessed the regional mechanical and cellular responses of lumbar caprine discs to dynamic and static overloading. IVDs (n = 125) were cultured in a bioreactor and subjected to simulated-physiological loading (SPL), high dynamic (HD), or high static (HS) overloading. The effect of loading was determined in five disc regions: nucleus, inner-annulus and anterior, lateral and posterior outer-annulus. IVD height loss and external pressure transfer during loading were measured, cell viability was mapped and quantified, and matrix integrity was assessed. During culture, overloaded IVDs lost {{a significant amount of}} height, yet the distribution of axial pressure remained unchanged. HD loading caused cell death and disruption of matrix in <b>all</b> <b>IVD</b> regions, whereas HS loading particularly affected cell viability and matrix integrity in the posterior region of the outer annulus. Axial overloading is detrimental to the lumbar IVD. Static overloading affects the posterior annulus more strongly, while the nucleus is relatively spared. Hence, static overloading predisposes the disc for posterior herniation. These findings could have implications for working conditions, in particular of sedentary occupations, and the design of interventions aimed at prevention and treatment of early intervertebral disc degeneratio...|$|R
40|$|Intervertebral disc {{degeneration}} is {{a common}} cause of low back pain in both man and dogs. Research has shown that degenerative changes are influenced by pro-inflammatory mediators such as PGE 2, produced by COX- 2. In this study, the anti-inflammatory effect of celecoxib, a selective COX- 2 inhibitor, on degenerate canine lumbar intervertebral discs was assessed. Celecoxib was administered into the IVD directly during a surgical procedure as a bolus or within several controlled release systems (hydrogels and microspheres). Before and four weeks after the surgery, MRI images were obtained. RT-qPCR {{has been used to}} assess matrix remodelling, cytokine profile, apoptosis, and the quantity of pge 2 synthetase. Histology was used to assess IVD morphology and cell type, and to check for remnants of injected materials and inflammation. <b>All</b> <b>IVDs</b> were assigned a score according to the modified Boos’ scoring system. RT-qPCR showed an increase of pge 2 synthetase in IVDs treated with a celecoxib bolus, but a significant decline in IVDs treated with TNO gel loaded with celecoxib, without concomitant changes in genes related to matrix remodelling. Histologically, no inflammation due to the procedure was seen, one IVD showed mild formation of scar tissue in the superficial region of the AF. No significant changes were found regarding matrix composition and cell populations of the IVDs. A high Boos’ score was associated with a high PGE 2 content. IVDD seems to be associated with an increasing PGE 2 content and celecoxib can effectively inhibit PGE 2 production. TNO gel loaded with celecoxib showed favourable outcomes. Further research is needed to confirm therapeutic effects and assess safety...|$|R
40|$|During spaceflight, it {{has been}} shown that {{intervertebral}} discs (IVDs) increase in height, causing elongation of the spine up to several centimeters. Astronauts frequently report dull lower back pain that is most likely of discogenic origin and may result from IVD expansion. It is unknown whether disc volume solely increases by water influx, or if the content of glycosaminoglycans also changes in microgravity. Aim of this pilot study was to investigate effects of the spaceflight analog of bedrest on the glycosaminoglycan content of human lumbar IVDs. Five healthy, non-smoking, male human subjects of European descent were immobilized in 6 ° head-down-tilt bedrest for 21 days. Subjects remained in bed 24 h a day with at least one shoulder on the mattress. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans were taken according to the delayed gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (dGEMRIC) protocol before and after bedrest. The outcome measures were T 1 and DT 1. Scans were performed before and after administration of the contrast agent Gd-DOTA, and differences between T 1 -values of both scans (DT 1) were computed. DT 1 is the longitudinal relaxation time in the tissue and inversely related to the glycosaminoglycan-content. For data analysis, IVDs L 1 / 2 to L 4 / 5 were semi-automatically segmented. Zones were defined and analyzed separately. Results show a highly significant decrease in DT 1 (p< 0. 001) after bedrest in <b>all</b> <b>IVDs,</b> and in <b>all</b> areas of the IVDs. The DT 1 -decrease was most prominent in the nucleus pulposus and in L 4 / 5, and was expressed slightly more in the posterior than anterior IVD. Unexpected negative DT 1 -values were found in Pfirrmann-grade 2 -discs after bedrest. Significantly lower T 1 before contrast agent application was found after bedrest compared to before bedrest. According to the dGEMRIC-literature, the decrease in DT 1 may be interpreted as an increase in glycosaminoglycans in healthy IVDs during bedrest. This interpretation seems contradictory to previous findings in IVD unloading...|$|R
40|$|Innovations in {{healthcare}} {{have led to}} survival of {{a higher proportion of}} critically-ill, elderly and immuno-compromised patients. Intravascular devices (IVDs) are indispensable in providing safe, reliable vascular access and continuous haemodynamic monitoring of these patients in the intensive care unit. Unfortunately, many healthcare-acquired or nosocomial infections in severely ill patients can be caused by the very medical devices that are implanted to provide life-sustaining care. IVDs comprising peripheral arterial catheters (ACs), non-tunnelled short-term central venous catheters (CVCs) and peripherally-inserted central catheters (PICCs) breach the skin and provide a potential avenue for external micro-organisms to invade the tissue or bloodstream. <b>All</b> <b>IVDs</b> are associated with a risk of both local and systemic catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI). Few studies have been conducted on colonization rates of ACs and their potential to cause CRBSI. Therefore, in a preliminary study, we compared the colonization rates of ACs with CVCs which were concurrently managed in a defined cohort of patients. This study revealed that both AC colonization and CRBSI rates were comparable to those in concurrently-sited and identically managed CVCs. Therefore, ACs should be accorded the same degree of importance as CVCs as a potential source of sepsis. This observation {{led to the development of}} 3 studies to critically examine a number of aspects of this problem. Study 1 : To determine the predominant mechanism of ACs colonization by comparing ACs accessing frequency to colonization rate Study 2 : To determine the degree of microbial colonization on the external and internal surfaces of concurrently-sited IVDs and to establish if microbial growth is greater on a particular segment of the IVDs at the time of removal. Study 3 : To determine the degrees of concordance of nursing care and management of IVDs with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines and institutional protocols, and how the deficit in adherence to these protocols may impact on IVD colonization. There are currently three explanations for the process of microbial colonization in IVDs. The first suggests colonization by micro-organisms occurs on the outside of the catheter, either via downward colonization of micro-organisms from the patient’s skin surface on the outside surface of the catheter, or via upward colonization where the micro-organisms are inoculated on the tip of the IVD at the time of insertion. The second suggests micro-organisms are introduced via the inside surface of the IVD, either via a contaminated infusate, or via contamination of the port or hub connected to the IVD. The third suggests that microorganisms are disseminated from some other part of the patient’s body, and carried via the bloodstream to both the inside and outside surfaces of the catheter. A common assumption is that the more frequently an IVD is accessed, the greater the likelihood of contamination and colonization. My first study sought to determine if accessing frequency had an influence on the rate of colonization in ACs, thereby testing the influence of the second mechanism (i. e. contamination of hub or infusate) on IVD colonization. In this study we used some of the data from the prior surveillance cohort with additional data collection. No significant differences were found between the rates of accessing the ACs and their colonization when adjusted for confounding, continuous variables. Accessing frequency of an AC did not appear to be a major predisposing factor for the likelihood of colonization, suggesting that the second mechanism of IVD colonization via the intra-luminal route was less common in the context of reasonable application of aseptic practices. My next study focused on determining the degree of microbial colonization on the external and internal surfaces of concurrently-sited IVDs, and to establish if a relative difference in microbial growth existed on a particular segment of the IVD at the time of removal. This involved determining the colony count at six different sites on each individual IVD, allowing repeated-measures comparison of each IVD with itself. Degree of colonization was greatest at the proximal, external surface of the intravascular segment of <b>all</b> <b>IVD</b> types compared to the middle or distal segments. Overall degree of colonization on the IVDs’ internal surfaces was also less than on the external surfaces. This suggests that the wound site created by IVD insertion may be a significant source of colonization and CRBSI. This finding raised the question if IVD wound-site care practices might contribute to the likelihood of colonization. It is apparent that IVD colonization is caused by multiple factors, one being the environment in which these IVDs are managed and cared for on a daily basis. Practice guidelines and institutional infection control protocols provide a reference point for nurses involved with the care and management of IVDs to implement best practice. However, little is known about how closely nurses adhered to the guidelines and protocols when caring and managing IVDs, and if any variations in practice contributes to increased microbial colonization in IVDs. Therefore, the final study sought to determine the degree of concordance of current nursing practice to evidence-based practice guidelines, as a proxy for actual adherence to protocols, and how partial or non-adherence to protocols may impact on colonization. This study showed that there was less than ideal adherence to practice protocols, and that for some aspects of practice, adherence to protocol by intensive care unit nurses (who manage IVD care daily), was less than those who had less experience of IVD care. Clearly, nurses had different preferences for sourcing advice and information about IVD care practices. Future research would be required to determine whether this differential adherence to protocols and guidelines was associated with poorer outcomes, better outcomes, or no outcome differences. In summary, the major findings of this work are: 1) Establishing that AC colonization rates and CRBSI rates were similar to CVCs, reiterating the need to accord the same degree of importance to ACs as CVCs as a potential source of sepsis. 2) Dispelling the notion that the more frequently an IVD is accessed, the greater the likelihood of contamination and colonization. 3) IVD colonization via the intra-luminal route was less common when compared to the mechanism of microbial colonization on the external surface of the IVD. 4) Microbial colonization is heaviest on the external surface of the proximal segment of <b>all</b> <b>IVD</b> types compared to the middle or distal segments, and that overall degree of colonization on the IVDs’ internal surfaces was also less than on the external surfaces. 5) Discrepancies in concordance between the CDC guidelines and current nursing practice exist 6) A knowledge-practice gap exists because the access to evidence-based protocols intended to provide vital information and guide nursing practice may be hindered by the choice of end-users who may not use these protocols...|$|R
