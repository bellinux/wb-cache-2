25|$|The United States Air Force's (USAF) {{competition}} for a helicopter {{to be used}} for support on missile bases included a specific requirement to mandate the use of the General Electric T58 turboshaft as a powerplant. The Air Force had a large inventory of these engines on hand for its fleet of HH-3 Jolly Green Giant rescue helicopters and using the same engine for both helicopters would save costs. In response, Bell proposed an upgraded version of the 204B with the T58 engine. Because the T58 output shaft is at the rear, and was thus mounted in front of the transmission on the HH-3, it had to have a separate offset gearbox (SDG or speed <b>decreaser</b> gearbox) at the rear, and shafting to couple to the UH-1 transmission.|$|E
40|$|Depending {{on their}} {{response}} to grazing, grassland species can be categorized as grazing increasers or decreasers. Grazing by livestock includes several different activities that can impact species differently. Recent evidence suggest {{that one of these}} actions, dung deposition, can reduce the germinative performance of <b>decreaser</b> species, thus favouring increasers. The present study tested the hypothesis that decreased germinative success of <b>decreaser</b> species is caused by a greater activity of fungal pathogens under the influence of dung leachates. We performed a phytotron experiment analysing the germination and fungal infections of fourteen species from Mediterranean grasslands. Species were grouped into phylogenetically-related pairs, composed of an increaser and a <b>decreaser</b> species. Seeds of each species were germinated under four different treatments (control, dung leachate addition, fungicide addition and dung leachate and fungicide addition), and the differences in germination percentage, germination speed and infection rate between each increaser species and its <b>decreaser</b> counterpart were analysed. <b>Decreaser</b> species were more affected by mortality than increaser ones, and these differences were higher under the presence of dung leachates. The differences in germinative performance after excluding the effect of seed mortality did not differ between treatments, showing that the main mechanism by which dung leachates favour increaser species is through increased mortality of the seeds of <b>decreaser</b> species. Drastic reductions in the number of dead seeds in the treatments including fungicide addition further revealed that fungal pathogens are responsible for these differences between species with different grazing response. The different vulnerabilities of increaser and <b>decreaser</b> species to the increased activity of fungal pathogens under the presence of dung leachates seems the main reason behind the differential effect of these leachates on species with different grazing responseFinancial support was received from the Spanish MINECO (Project CGL 2014 - 53789 -R) and the Madrid Regional Government (Project REMEDINAL 3).

Based {{on the results of}} growth mixture modelling with a symptom inventory (N = 910), three latent classes emerged: Adolescents following a Stable High trajectory, a Strong <b>Decreasers</b> trajectory and a Moderate <b>Decreasers</b> trajectory. A subsample of this group (N = 116) completed measures on maladaptive personality traits and social relations with parents. Multiple multinomial logistic regression analyses showed that higher scores on Detachment and being a female increased the chance of following the Stable High trajectory and that higher scores on Negative Affectivity increased the chance of following the Strong <b>Decreasers</b> trajectory. Finally, it was found that Support from parents moderated the effect of Negative Affectivity on following the Stable High trajectory of change as opposed to the Strong or Moderate <b>Decreasers</b> trajectories.

40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown limited efficacy of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) among adolescents and generally low compliance rates. As higher compliance rates are associated with improved abstinence rates, the present study examined predictors of NRT compliance. This study aims to test whether different NRT compliance trajectories can be distinguished among adolescents, to test whether these trajectories can be predicted by demographic, smoking-related, and personality factors, and to examine abstinence rates for each trajectory. Data were used from a randomized controlled trial that tested the efficacy of nicotine patches versus placebo patches among 265 Dutch adolescents. During NRT treatment, adolescents filled out six online questionnaires in which they reported {{on the number of}} days they used the patches. Predictors (i. e., demographic and smoking-related factors and personality characteristics) and end-of-treatment abstinence were also administered through these self-reports. Latent class growth analysis (LCGA) was used to analyze compliance data by classifying individuals into similar growth trajectories. Three compliance trajectories were found (i. e., "compliers" (n = 89), "moderate decreasers" (n = 41), and "strong decreasers" (n = 127)). The compliers can be characterized by higher levels of conscientiousness and agreeableness and lower levels of extraversion compared with the strong <b>decreasers,</b> and by higher levels of conscientiousness and education compared with the moderate <b>decreasers.</b> Among the compliers, a substantially higher percentage of adolescents achieved abstinence at end-of-treatment (10 %) compared with the moderate <b>decreasers</b> (3 %) and the strong <b>decreasers</b> (6 %).

40|$|Consumer debt {{played a}} central role in {{creating}} the U.

This paper uses micro-level data to decompose consumer debt dynamics by separating the actions of consumer debt increasers and <b>decreasers,</b> and then further decomposing movements into percentage and size margins among the increasers and <b>decreasers.</b> We view such a decomposition as informative for macroeconomic models featuring a central role for consumer debt. Using this framework, we show that variations in borrowing activity among the increasers explain four times as much of the total variation in consumer debt as variations among the <b>decreasers</b> who are shedding debt, whether through paydowns or defaults. We also provide micro-level evidence of a sharp decline in the percentage of increasers during the financial crisis that is qualitatively consistent with a binding zero lower bound on nominal interest rates, and evidence of a cycle in the average size of debt changes among the increasers that is related to rising collateral values pre-crisis coupled with additional financial frictions after the crisis...|$|R

Some of these plants are palatable and productive, others are unpalatable and unproductive. However, from the presence, absence, or abundance of all plants in this group in a particular range it is possible to evaluate past use, determine range condition, and measure effectiveness of grazing and management programs. The second section, 2 ̆ 2 Common Range Plants of Secondary Importance 2 ̆ 2, includes plants frequently seen in Nebraska grasslands but which are less important indicators of management and producers of forage. Because the practical management of a ranch requires a knowledge of only the first group of plants, educational programs in range management should emphasize recognition and evaluation of this group. Some range plant species respond differently to grazing on different range sites or in different precipitation zones. For example, little bluestem is a <b>decreaser</b> in the 15 to 19 -inch precipitation zone but an increaser in the 20 to 24 -inch precipitation zone.

Growth-Mixture-Modeling (GMM) estimated separate developmental trajectories for each ODB measure for ages 3 to 5.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this project is to link the statistical theory used in the ecological sciences with an actual project that was developed for the South African National Parks Scientific Services. It investigates {{the changes that have}} occurred in the herbaceous and woody structure due to the closure of artificial waterpoints; including the impacts that elephants and other herbivores have on the vegetation of the Kruger National Park. This project was designed in conjunction with South African National Parks (SANP) Scientific Services and it is a registered project with this department. The results of this project will be submitted to Scientific Services in accordance with the terms and conditions of a SANP research project. A major concern within the KNP is the declining numbers of rare antelope and numerous projects have been developed to investigate possible ways of halting this decline and thus protecting the heterogeneity of the Kruger National Park. Three different datasets were investigated, covering three aspects of vegetation structure and composition within the KNP. The first investigated the changes that have occurred since the N'washitsumbe enclosure in the Far Northern KNP was fenced {{off from the rest of}} the park. The results show that over the 40 years since the enclosure was built, changes have occurred which have resulted in a significant difference in the abundance of Increaser 2 and <b>Decreaser</b> grass species between the inside and the outside of the enclosure. Increaser 2 and <b>Decreaser</b> categories are the result of a grass species classification depending on whether the species thrives or is depressed by heavy grazing. The difference in grass species composition and structure between the inside and the outside of the enclosure indicates that the grazing animals within the KNP have influenced the grass composition in a way that favours the dominant animals. This has resulted in a declining roan antelope population - one of the species that is considered as a 'rare antelope'. Many artificial waterpoints (boreholes and dams) have also been closed throughout the KNP in the hope of resulting in a change in vegetation structure and composition in favour of the roan. Veld condition assessment data for 87 boreholes throughout the Park was analyzed to determine whether the veld in the vicinity is beginning to change towards a more <b>Decreaser</b> dominated sward which would favour the roan. The results were analyzed for the different regions of the Park; and they indicate that changes are becoming evident; however, the results are not particularly conclusive, yet. The majority of the boreholes were closed between 1994 and 1998 which means that not a lot of data were available to be analyzed. A similar study conducted in another 10 years time might reveal more meaningful results. However the results are moving in the direction hoped for by the management of the KNP. The results show that the grass composition has a higher proportion of <b>Decreaser</b> grasses since the closure of the waterpoints, and the grass biomass around these areas has also improved. The results were analyzed on an individual basis; and then on a regional basis as the minimal data meant that the individual analyses did not provide any significant results. A third study was then done on the impact that the rapidly increasing elephant population on the vegetation within the Riparian zone along three rivers in the Far Northern region of the KNP. The riparian zone is an important part of the landscape, in terms of providing food for many animals as well as shade. The elephant population has increased substantially since the termination of the culling program and this means that the feeding requirements of the population has increased which could result in severe damage upon the vegetation, as elephants can be very destructive feeders. The results show surprising differences between the three years of data that were analyzed; however the results indicate that the elephants are targeting specific height ranges of trees when feeding; however they do not seem to consistently target specific tree species. This is positive for the diversity of the Riparian zone as this region is very important both ecologically and aesthetically for the tourists who visit the Park...|$|E

30|$|More grass {{species were}} {{observed}} during the wet season {{compared to the}} dry season. This was {{because some of the}} ephemerals like S. verticillata were present only during the wet season. Ephemerals are grass species which regenerate immediately after the rains (Verdoodt et al. 2010; Lugusa et al. 2016), emerging where <b>decreaser</b> species have been depleted as a result of heavy grazing and are therefore a sign of poor range condition (Oluwole et al. 2008). Eragrostis spp., for instance, are increaser species, increasing in abundance where there is severe grazing that leads to range degradation (Du Toit 2009). These results corroborate Egeru et al. (2015) who observed 34 species during the wet season and 26 species during the dry season in Karamoja sub-region of Uganda. As reported by Sabiiti and Teka (2004) and Machogu (2013), Chloris, Hyparrhenia, Aristida, and Sporobolus spp. {{are some of the most}} pronounced grasses in the East African rangelands due to their self-seeding ability, tolerance to drought, and spreading capacity.|$|E

30|$|The {{results suggest}} that most grasses were more {{prevalent}} away from the piospheres, while forbs were predominant near the piospheres. This was probably because most grasses were <b>decreaser</b> species and therefore susceptible to grazing. Aristida spp., Hyparrhenia spp., Bothriochloa spp., T. triandra, and S. holstii are <b>decreaser</b> species (Angassa 2014). Grazing alters species composition within the rangeland ecosystems (Todd 2006; Wu et al. 2009). High grazing pressure reduces the density of palatable plants forcing the animals to forage on species of low nutrition value (Amiri et al. 2008). As such, most preferred plant species cease to grow, giving way for the proliferation of forbs (Chaichi et al. 2005; Loydi et al. 2012). Similar observations were made by Hoshino et al. (2009) who reported that species composition changes along grazing gradients are characterized by changes in density and cover of life forms, and annual species and forbs replace perennial grasses near the piospheres. The {{results are consistent with}} Mudongo et al. (2016) who observed that continuous grazing led to diminished perennial grass population and increase in forbs and woody species in the Kalahari rangelands of Botswana. Furthermore, the findings under this study corroborate those of Mureithi et al. (2010) who reported a prevalence of forbs under heavy grazing in the Njemps Flats of Kenya. Similar observations were also made by Todd (2006) in the Nama-Karoo rangelands of Southern Africa where forbs and annual grasses replaced palatable perennial grasses due to heavy grazing near the piospheres. C. dactylon was, however, more pronounced near the water points. This was because C. dactylon can withstand heavy grazing, is extremely tolerant to fire, and adapts to various climatic and edaphic conditions, in addition to being tolerant to both salinity and flooding (Rita et al. 2012; Egeru et al. 2015). In a related study in the Sonamarg area of the Kashmir Himalayas, Mir et al. (2015) also observed that the importance value index of C. dactylon significantly increased during peak grazing seasons. Cynodon dactylon, Chloris pycnothrix, Eragrostis tenuifolia, and Sporobolus discosporus decreased with distance away from the piospheres. These findings corroborate the observations of Oluwole et al. (2008) that C. dactylon, Sporobolus spp., and Eragrostis spp. increase near the piospheres.|$|E

40|$|Fruit-eating birds {{disperse}} many rainforest seeds, thereby influencing rainforest regeneration.

We assessed {{the responses of}} 26 frugivorous bird species to forest fragmentation by comparing their abundance among extensive tracts, remnants and regrowth patches of rainforest (16 replicate sites in each) in subtropical south-east Queensland, Australia. There were five species that were recorded in much lower numbers in remnants and/or regrowth than in extensive forest ("decreasers"), seven that showed higher abundance in remnants and/or regrowth than in extensive forest ("increasers") and 14 whose abundance did not change substantially between the three habitat types ("tolerant" species). The <b>decreasers</b> included three fruit-specialist rainforest pigeons (the wompoo, rose-crowned and superb fruit-doves Ptilinopus magnificus, P. regina and P. superbus). The increasers were largely bird species with mixed diets, many of which also use non-rainforest habitats. Two <b>decreasers</b> and two tolerant species were substantially more abundant during summer than winter whereas two increaser and two tolerant bird species were more abundant during winter.

We investigated how well observed community changes in both {{space and time}} agree with expectations based on current paradigms in urban ecology. Location Greater Brisbane region, Australia. Methods We compared bird assemblages in two time-periods 15 years apart, at multiple sites in remnant forest and residential suburbs across an urbanizing landscape. Differences in assemblage composition, species abundances and functional groupings were assessed within and between habitats. Results Compared with forest, suburbs in both time-periods had over twice the total bird abundance, a different species composition, greater between-site community similarity, {{a greater proportion of}} non-native species and greater dominance by large-bodied species. These differences corresponded with changes in sites whose habitat was converted from forest to suburb. Between time-periods, abundances of 58 % of suburban species changed significantly compared with those of 11 % in forest. Increaser species outnumbered <b>decreasers</b> in suburbs, with the reverse in forest. Abundance of small-bodied birds decreased 70 % in suburbs and 20 % in forest. Broad-spectrum competitors and nest predators were common among suburban increasers. Among invasive species, the number of increasers was counterbalanced by <b>decreasers.</b> Both site-scale species richness and between-site community similarity increased to a small extent in both habitats. Main conclusions Species composition and ecological function of suburban bird communities were very dynamic. Suburban assemblages were neither a subset of forest species nor an increasingly non-native compilation. Communities in large forest patches were comparatively stable. The notion of habitat-specific species turnover better characterizes the nature of most changes than either species decline or homogenization, even though both of these were evident. There is considerable scope for careful urban planning, focused on both among- and within-habitat variety, to sustain bird diversity in urbanizing landscapes.

40|$|The {{grassland}} {{represents a}} mosaic pattern of areas dominated by either increaser grasses and <b>decreaser</b> grasses or dwarf karroid shrubs. The Braun-Blanquet method {{was used to}} classify the vegetation. The synoptic table of the grassland vegetation shows {{a clear distinction between}} the grass-dominated patches and karroid grassland. The grassland vegetation was grouped into three states in the state-and-transition model, according to the dominant species, namely State I, where a co-dominance of perennial grasses and dwarf karroid shrubs occur; State II, which is characterised by perennial grasses in a matrix of shrubs; and State III, where dwarf karroid shrubs dominate, with perennial grasses being more rare. Signs of deterioration of the grassland are visible in the high percentage of dwarf karroid shrubs and increaser grasses, usually associated with disturbed, overgrazed areas, as well as the presence of bare areas where the topsoil has been eroded away. Short-grass grazers prefer pioneer state territories and these territories thus show the most deterioration. These animals, however, also {{have a positive impact on}} the grassland habitat.

We performed a two stage analysis where genes ascertained for enhanced protein evolution in primates are subsequently searched {{for the presence of}} non-synonymous coding SNPs in the current human population at amino acid sites that differ between humans and chimpanzee. Positively selected genes among primates are generally presumed to determine phenotypic differences between humans and chimpanzee, such as the enhanced cognitive ability of our species. Amino acid substitutions segregating in humans at positively selected amino acid sites are expected to affect phenotypic differences among humans. Therefore we conducted an association study in two family based cohorts and one population based cohort between cognitive ability and the most likely candidate gene among the five that harbored more than one such polymorphism. The derived, human-specific allele of the beta- 2 adrenergic receptor Arg 16 Gly polymorphism was found to be the increaser allele for performance IQ in the young, family based cohort but the <b>decreaser</b> allele for two different measures of cognition in the large Scottish cohort of unrelated individuals. The polymorphism is known to affect signaling activity and modulation of beta- 2 adrenergic signaling has been shown to adjust memory consolidation, a trait related to cognition. The opposite effect of the polymorphism on cognition in the two age classes observed in the different cohorts resembles the effect of ADRB 2 on hypertension, which also has been reported to be age dependent. This result illustrates the relevance of comparative genomics to detect genes that are involved in human behavior. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC...|$|E

40|$|Grazing {{intensity}} gradients {{were determined}} in the duneveld, river terrace and river bed habitats of the Kalahari Gemsbok National Park. Under increased grazing, a species composition characterised mostly by annual forbs and grasses results. In all three habitats the relatively heavily grazed areas were {{closest to the}} watering points, although this was less evident in the river terrace and river bed habitats. Monitoring degradation at a watering point over the long term, produced results similar to those observed from a single sampling period. The identification of grazing gradients within homogeneous habitats, {{is a prerequisite for}} the classification of plant species into different categories. The allocation of a species to a category is based on the changes in frequency along this grazing gradient and this approach is more acceptable than the classification of species commonly used.

40|$|A line {{intercept}} survey {{was done on}} the herbaceous vegetation in permanently marked plots at distance intervals from the Wik-en-Weeg Dam, Kruger National Park, in 1973. The survey was repeated in 1990 so that changes in basal cover could be determined in relation to distance from the dam. Positive relationships with distance from the dam were found for the relative total percentage basal cover of the herbaceous vegetation, {{as well as for}} the relative basal cover of, respectively, grasses, forbs, <b>decreasers</b> and increasers. It was concluded that the provision of a permanent supply of drinking water for game in the Wik-en-Weeg Dam has had an impact on the nearby herbaceous community basal cover composition, as well as a negative impact on the basal cover of the herbaceous vegetation in the vicinity. The basal cover of the herbaceous stratum was more sensitive to the effect of the dam than parameters of the woody stratum...|$|R
40|$|Mobility, which {{includes}} life space and driving behaviors, {{is an important}} functional domain for older adults (e. g., Webber, Porter, 2 ̆ 6 Menec, in press). Low mobility is associated with sensory, physical, and cognitive deficits (e. g., Anstey, Wood, Lord, 2 ̆ 6 Walker, 2005). However, few studies have investigated how mobility changes over time. This dissertation contains three longitudinal articles that explored mobility changes, {{with an emphasis on}} driving and cognition, among community-dwelling older adults. The first paper investigated patterns of driving self-regulation (i. e., adjustment of driving behaviors) among control-group participants from the Advanced Cognitive Training for Independent and Vital Elderly (ACTIVE) study (N= 548). Self-regulation was defined by driving space, frequency, and perceived difficulty. Growth mixture models revealed one subgroup of drivers (2 ̆ 2 <b>Decreasers</b> 2 ̆ 2) that showed declines in their driving, and two subgroups that were stable over time. Relative to the stable groups, <b>Decreasers</b> showed significantly more depressive symptoms and lower reasoning, speed of processing (Useful Field of View Test [UFOV]), self-rated health, balance, and everyday functioning at baseline. The second paper examined mobility changes in ACTIVE participants with psychometrically defined mild cognitive impairment (MCI; N= 304). Group differences in life space and driving (space, frequency, and difficulty) were evaluated using random effects models, which were adjusted for baseline demographics, health, depression, balance, attrition, and cognitive training participation. Relative to normal participants, participants with MCI showed reduced baseline mobility for all outcomes, as well as faster rates of decline for driving frequency and difficulty. Finally, the third paper examined three-year changes in mobility for control-group participants in the Staying Keen in Later Life (SKILL) study (N= 370). Outcomes were life space and driving (space, frequency, and difficulty). Latent change models revealed significant correlations between: changes in life space and age; changes in driving frequency and complex reaction time (Road Sign Test); and changes in driving difficulty and age, gender, mental status, and complex reaction time (Road Sign Test). Taken together, the articles in this dissertation show that older adults exhibit distinct patterns of mobility over time, and that demographic, health, and cognitive factors are associated with these patterns...|$|R
40|$|Since {{laryngoscopy}} and {{tracheal intubation}} {{may result in}} hemodynamic responses {{in the form of}} increasing blood pressure and heart rate and also lead to arrhythmia and myocardial ischemia in the susceptible individuals and these changes can be even harmful for elder people. The present study was conducted to compare Alfentanil and during anesthesia induction and tracheal intubation in the elderly. Forty patients were randomly allocated in two groups in this double blind randomized clinical trial candidates for cataract surgery and received the general anesthesia. Before the anesthesia induction 10 μg kg- 1 Alfentanil and 0. 5 μg kg- 1 Remifentanil were injected respectively in the first and second groups within 30 sec. Both groups received similar general anesthesia and 1 μg kg- 1 Alfentanil and 0. 1 μg kg- 1 Remifentanil were, respectively infused in the first and second groups during anesthesia. Heart rates, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and mean arterial pressure of the patients were regularly measured and recorded in different stages: before anesthesia induction, after drugs injection, after tracheal intubation and after at 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 min later. The data were analyzed using the discriptive and analytic statistics in SPSS statistic software in the form of statistic-T test and chi square. After injection of the initial dose of the narcotics, immediately a remarkable decline was found in hemodynamic variables. But <b>decreaser</b> diastolic blood pressure in Remifentanil group was significantly more than in Alfentanil group (p 0. 05). Morever the dose of ephedrine which is used to compensate the sever hypotension in Remifentanil group was significantly more (11 patients) than in Alfentanil group (4 patients) (p< 0. 05). According to the results of this study, we conclude that Remifentanil more than Alfentanil modifies the increase in the blood pressure resulted from laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation, but it produces more reduction in blood pressure during anesthesia. There {{was no significant difference between}} both drugs in the case of increase in heart rate after laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation...|$|E
40|$|Veld {{fires are}} {{very common in}} the {{semi-arid}} tropics, in Zimbabwe alone they frequently occur causing damage {{to the environment and}} infrastructure in hence their effect was investigated. The project was carried out in Mahiye a farm in Matopos Research Institute (MRI) and Tshabalala game sanctuary with the aim of investigating the effect of the frequent veld fires on the soil seed bank of herbaceous species. The effect of fire was investigated on three depth levels these being the 0 - 3 cm, 3 - 6 cm and 6 - 9 cm. Twelve 100 m 2 plots were marked in the two sites, 6 in burnt site (Mahiye) and the other 6 in unburnt site (Tshabalala). A species composition survey was done in the plots and identified 32 species. The Mahiye site was burnt before soil sampling, and collected in sequence at soil depths of 0 - 3 cm, 3 - 6 cm and 6 - 9 cm. The soil samples were then germinated on heat sterilised sand in a greenhouse. A total of 1472 plants emerged but only 477 (32. 4 %) managed to survive up to species identification stage. A total of 21 and 18 species, including forbs and sage, germinated from the burnt and unbumt sit respectively. Grasses dominated both sites and {{there were no significant differences}} (P> 0. 05) in the germination frequencies of the plants between burnt and unbunrt site meaning fire did not affect seed bank in the burnt site. Amongst the species that emerged in the germination trials there were new species like Disitariaveluting. Digitaiia tenatta and sorehumversicolor while other species did not grow in the germination trials. This meant there were significant differences (P< 0. 05 between species emergence between the in-situ and ex-situ species emergence. The results of the trial also showed that viable seed are mostly found in the upper horizon, the 03 cm, while the 3 - 6 and 69 cm did not show significant differences according to the Duncanâ€™s multiple range test [...] However when comparing germination frequencies between the three depth levels they showed significant differences (P< 0. 05). The frequency of increasers, decreasers and invaders did differ significantly between the sites. The burnt and unbumt sites were dominated by <b>decreaser</b> species in the 0 - 3 cm, followed by increaser species in the burnt site and invaders in the unbent site...|$|E
40|$|The {{widespread}} {{provision of}} water points in protected areas in semi-arid savannas has supported associated increases in cumulative grazing pressure. This study addresses the management implications of artificial water provision which causes {{the development of}} grazing gradients of increasing herbivore impact at artificial water point sites. The aim {{of the study was}} to map and quantify the impact of grazing and trampling at water points sites in a 4 600 ha sized semi arid savanna game reserve (Mafikeng Game Reserve in the North West Province). Aerial photographs and SPOT imagery were used to identify the extent of the sacrifice zone for the period before the reserve was established (1980), and after establishment (2003 and 2009). To quantify the herbaceous species, relative percentage frequency and composition, the frequency of occurrence of species at water point sites was measured along four 100 m transect following cardinal directions (north, east, south, west). Furthermore, Landscape Function Analysis (LFA), which uses indicators that can be assessed rapidly to determine the functional status of the rangelands, was applied. The landscape zones or cover types were related to 10 distance categories within a 100 m transect. The results indicate the increasing extent of the sacrifice zone since the provision of the artificial water points. The water points that are situated away from the river were characterized by Increaser II species. Increaser I and <b>Decreaser</b> species characterized water points which are situated along the river. Species composition was influenced by environmental variables such as soil type and depth and the spatial location of water points in relation to natural water source. The results of the study suggest changes in plant composition and soil cover that are probably related to accumulated long-term loss of herbaceous vegetation cover around water points, with special emphasis on water points that are situated away from the natural water source in the central part of the reserve. This part of the reserve attracts higher concentrations of animals probably due to the water points, which causes loss of herbaceous vegetation. In order to minimize degradation of the areas surrounding water points in the central part of the reserve, the rotational opening and closing of water points situated away from the river should be explored, based on the system change, to allow vegetation recovery. Also, the nonoperating water point near the natural source should be opened in an attempt to attract animals to underutilized areas, to allow uniform desirable utilization of the entire reserve, taking the reserve’s objectives into account...|$|E

Responses were evaluated by multiple linear regression analysis, cOrrelation coefficient analyses, and path coefficient analyses. Data were made available by the U. S. Dept. Agr. Forest Service. Observations were recorded annually from 1957 to 1966 for use, precipitation, and perennial {{grass production}} on 20 transects in each of four pastures. Perennial grass and shrub intercepts were read from the same transects for the period 1956 - 1966, excluding 1960. Range condition ratings were made {{on each of the}} transects in 1966. Perennial grass production was shown to be dependent on the product of current August X previous June-September precipitation. Use levels generally had weak negative effects on production. Range condition was found to be correlated with 10 -year mean use. Range condition was not closely correlated with perennial grass production. Forage cover and percent invaders, <b>decreasers,</b> and increasers were the major determinants of range condition rating. These factors were not strongly correlated with perennial grass production...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{we tested}} {{to what extent}} smoking-specific {{parenting}} and changes in parenting are related to adolescents' smoking trajectories. Data were used from a four-wave prospective study including 428 adolescents (aged M = 15. 2; SD = 0. 60). Latent Class Growth Analyses were conducted to identify trajectories. Multinomial Logistic Regression Analyses were executed to examine the relations between parenting and class membership. Longitudinal cross-lagged models were tested to examine causal predominance between parenting and smoking. Four trajectories were found, consisting of Non-smokers, Increasers, Stable smokers and <b>Decreasers.</b> Quality of parental smoking-specific communication was strongly related to the membership in different trajectories. Along with the cross-lagged associations demonstrating {{that the quality of}} communication was predominantly related to future smoking rather than vice versa, these findings indicate that parents who talked about smoking in a constructive and respectful manner {{were more likely to have}} non-smoking children. In contrast, parents who talked often about smoking-related issues and increased these discussions over time were more likely to have smoking children; cross-lagged associations indicated that these findings could be best explained by children changing their parents. Having a non-smoking agreement was related to a lower risk in becoming a regular smoker...|$|R

We combined {{data from the}} US Geological Survey National Water-Quality Assessment (NAWQA) program and the US Environmental Protection Agency Wadeable Streams Assessment (WSA) to expand the scope of an existing River InVertebrate Prediction and Classification System (RIVPACS) –type predictive model and to assess the biological condition of streams across the western US {{in a variety of}} landuse classes. We used model-derived estimates of taxon-specific probabilities of capture and observed taxon occurrences to identify taxa that were absent from sites where they were predicted to occur (<b>decreasers)</b> and taxa that were present at sites where they were not predicted to occur (increasers). Integration of 87 NAWQA reference sites increased the scope of the existing WSA predictive model to include larger streams and later season sampling.
