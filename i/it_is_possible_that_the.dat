5|$|Although {{its orbit}} is rather {{different}} from those of the main two groups, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> comet of 1680 is also related to the Kreutz sungrazers via a fragmentation many orbits ago.|$|E
5|$|Because Xenopus {{are sold}} in pet shops and used in {{laboratories}} around the world, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> chytrid fungus may have been exported from Africa.|$|E
5|$|The {{radiocarbon}} dating {{of the human}} remains {{does not provide a}} date for the construction of Coldrum Long Barrow itself; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> individuals died either some time before or after the monument's construction.|$|E

5000|$|In {{regard to}} whether two given propositions {{can have the}} same truth value, there are four {{separate}} logical possibilities: the propositions are subalterns (possibly both are true, and possibly both <b>are</b> false); subcontraries (<b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> both <b>are</b> true, but not that both <b>are</b> false); contraries (<b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> both <b>are</b> false, but not that both are true); or contradictories (<b>it</b> <b>is</b> not <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> both <b>are</b> true, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> both <b>are</b> false).|$|R
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> there <b>were</b> other visits. Given {{that the}} darker-skinned Calormenes {{differed}} in appearance from northern peoples (like Telmarines and Archenlanders), <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> they <b>are</b> descended from another {{group from the}} world of men; however, this is not stated in the books.|$|R
5|$|Almost all the {{surviving}} source material is of questionable reliability. The two witnesses who gave evidence, Robert Stubbs and James Kelsall, were strongly motivated to exonerate themselves from blame. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> figures concerning {{the number of}} slaves killed, {{the amount of water}} that remained on the ship, and the distance beyond Jamaica that Zong had mistakenly sailed are inaccurate.|$|E
5|$|An Anglo-Saxon {{spearhead}} {{was found}} in July 1962 by D. Tamkin in a cutting through a natural knoll of sand on Messrs Reed's playing fields at Cobdown, Ditton. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> spearhead came from a grave {{on the top of}} the knoll, destroyed during the making or widening of the cutting.|$|E
5|$|An {{anonymous}} chronicler at Bury St Edmunds, {{working in}} the second quarter of the 12th century, produced a compilation now known as The Annals of St Neots. He used material from a version of Asser's work which differs in some places from the Cotton manuscript and in some places appears to be more accurate, so <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> copy used was not the Cotton manuscript.|$|E

5|$|At {{least one}} sibling of Nyuserre is known with near-certainty: Neferefre, {{who was a}} son of Neferirkare and Khentkaus II, was Nyuserre's elder brother. Since the {{relation}} between Shepseskare and Nyuserre remains uncertain, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> two were brothers too, as suggested by Roth, although the dominant hypothesis is that Shepseskare was a son of Sahure and hence Nyuserre's uncle.|$|E
5|$|Eighteen {{of these}} pits {{were found to}} contain the remains of human skeletons, which are now stored in the Weston-super-Mare Museum in Weston-super-Mare. Eighteen full skeletons were found, of which ten show {{evidence}} of a violent death (including sword cuts in the skulls). <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Romans or the Belgic raiders attacked the fort and killed the inhabitants.|$|E
5|$|Giselle {{was first}} staged in Italy at Teatro alla Scala in Milan on 17 January 1843. The music however was not Adam's {{but that of}} Niccolò Bajetti. The dances were not the {{original}} either but those of Antonio Cortesi. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> ballet was first staged in the provincial theatres. This, however, is not known with certainty.|$|E

5|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Byzantine flavour {{to these}} images was also {{connected}} with contemporary attempts through diplomacy to achieve reconciliation with the Greek Orthodox Church, in which van Eyck's patron Philip the Good took a keen interest. Van Eyck's Portrait of Cardinal Niccolò Albergati (c. 1431) depicts {{one of the}} papal diplomats most involved with these efforts.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Iazyges did {{not move}} west in their entirety, {{and that some of}} them stayed along the Sea of Azov, which would explain the {{occasional}} surname of , however if this is true, the Iazyges that remained along the Sea of Azov are never mentioned again.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Tyne and Wear Metro may be {{extended}} from Northumberland Park and terminate at Blyth, {{but this will}} not be considered before 2019. An alternative, proposed (2009) by the Association of Train Operating Companies, is reopening the existing freight line between Newcastle and Ashington, including reopening Newsham station to serve Blyth.|$|E

5|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> anti-Semitic {{passages}} in her memoir {{were intended to}} be used as evidence that she was not Jewish; alternatively, she may have been influenced by Ezra Pound's anti-Semitic radio broadcasts. Whatever the case, she did help a Jewish couple escape Italy, providing passage on a ship to the United States. By {{the end of the war}} her sympathies had again changed, and she saw the Allies as liberators.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{attribution}} to book three {{was simply}} incorrect, and Atalante's Ehoie came {{within the family}} of Athamas in books one or two. Another possibility {{is that she was}} introduced in the context of her mother's family. Her identity in the Catalogue is unknown, but this hypothesis could allow for Atalanta to appear within the Inachid stemma, following the Danae-Ehoie within the extended family of Belus.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unclear}} exactly who was {{responsible}} for the damage on the German ships. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> mines were air-dropped by RAF Handley Page Hampden bombers. Should this be the case, the bombers achieved far more damage than the Royal Navy {{and the rest of the}} RAF combined.|$|E

5|$|Odo unsuccessfully {{rebelled against}} William II in 1088 {{and in the}} {{aftermath}} was stripped of his lands. His manors across Oxfordshire were taken back into royal control and broken up to be granted to sub-tenants, although it is unclear who was initially granted Deddington Castle; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> powerful Anglo-Norman baron Robert de Beaumont, the Earl of Leicester, controlled it in 1130.|$|E
5|$|Pieces of the {{original}} timbers were preserved enough to allow scientists to analyse them and determine some {{of the types of}} wood used. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> ship was constructed in western Asia and bought by Arabian merchants to be used for the Oman to China route; the cargo contains many Arabian-inspired artefacts.|$|E
5|$|Produced {{later than}} Werferth's coins are those by Efe: these, {{by far the}} most numerous, have dies which change in time. Distribution {{analysis}} suggests that Efe's mint was possibly located in northern Suffolk or southern Norfolk. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> name of the village of Euston, Suffolk, a little southeast of Thetford, is derived from Efe.|$|E
