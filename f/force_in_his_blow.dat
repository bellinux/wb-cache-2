One of the Dynasty's most famous generals, Huo Qubing, was sent by the Emperor to on a punitive expedition into the stronghold of the Hun people, in the northwestern part of China.

Such was the <b>force</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>blows</b> that immediately five springs began spouting water. From that day onward place came to be known as the Five Springs Mountain.|$|R
