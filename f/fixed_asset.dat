What a <b>fixed</b> <b>asset</b> is worth becomes apparent only upon sale, yet even then assets may be sold above or below their true value – an important reason why statisticians adjust depreciation rates retrospectively and use price deflators. [...] Even where detailed information is available, however, assessments of what an asset is worth still depend on the valuation criteria used. Those criteria often differ from the actual criteria used by business, since they must conform to a standard statistical definition for measurement comparisons.|$|E

2500|$|When {{government}} statisticians compile gross {{fixed capital}} formation (GFCF) figures, they usually add in [...] "ownership transfer costs" [...] (fees, taxes, charges, insurance costs, installation costs etc.) {{associated with the}} acquisition of a <b>fixed</b> <b>asset</b> put in place. In the United States, these costs represent around 1% of GDP, or around 4.5% of total fixed investment. This inclusion may be perfectly valid {{for the purpose of}} a realistic gross investment measure, but when GFCF data is subsequently used to extrapolate the value of fixed capital stocks using the PIM (the perpetual inventory method), it includes elements which are, strictly speaking, not part of the value of fixed assets themselves. It appears [...] "as if" [...] ownership transfer costs are incurred and depreciated each year in the lifetime of fixed assets, since the value of these costs is carried forward in the perpetual inventory (unless a special adjustment is made). This has the effect of raising the fixed capital stock estimate above true value, cumulatively.|$|E
