5000|$|In 2007, 23-year-old Daniel Jones founded The Church of Jediism {{with his}} brother Barney, believing that the 2001 UK census {{recognised}} Jediism as a religion, {{and that there were}} [...] "more Jedi than Scientologists in Britain". In 2009, Jones was removed from a Tesco supermarket in Bangor, North Wales, for refusing to remove his hood on a religious basis. The owner justified <b>Jones's</b> ejection by <b>saying,</b> [...] "He hasn't been banned. Jedis are very welcome to shop in our stores although we would ask them to remove their hoods. Obi-Wan Kenobi, Yoda and Luke Skywalker all appeared hoodless without ever going over to the Dark Side and we are only aware of the Emperor as one who never removed his hood." ...|$|R
50|$|Jones {{had become}} one of four world {{champion}}s, from no one wanting to fight him to being world champion in the space of 6 months. Many Great fighters wanted to fight him especially Winky Wright (who later picked up Jones' title on the way to becoming Undisputed Light Middleweight World Champion) The plan was for Jones to defend his WBO title against Bronco Banyon McKart of Bob Arum's Top Rank promotions. Both parties had a verbal agreement for the bout to be staged either in the UK or America. Many did <b>say</b> <b>Jones's</b> style would have been perfect for this big fight but unfortunately this did not materialise however Jones did go on to win the WBC Super Middle Weight International World Title. Jones' last fight was a points decision over the future EBU-EE Super Middleweight champion Kreshnik Qato. Jones retired in 2002 with a record of 31-12-1.|$|R
25|$|In 1946, Jones married fashion czar Harry Conover, one of {{the first}} model agents. They had three sons, and <b>Jones</b> <b>says</b> she didn't realize Conover was {{bisexual}} until some years into their marriage. She recognized some people might consider this naive, but Jones insisted her abusive childhood had made her wary of intimate relationships, and though she had many suitors, she was rather sexually inexperienced when she married. She reported that Conover initiated sexual activities with her very few times, and only when he was intoxicated.|$|E
25|$|While {{promoting}} the band's 2013 box set, Sound System, which <b>Jones</b> <b>says</b> {{will be the}} final time he works on Clash music, he discussed the band reuniting prior to Strummer's death.There were a few moments at the time I was up for it (Hall of Fame reunion in 2003), Joe was up for it. Paul wasn't. And neither, probably, was Topper Headon, who didn't wind up even coming in the end. It didn't look like a performance {{was going to happen}} anyway. I mean, you usually play at that ceremony when you get in. Joe had passed by that point, so we didn't. We were never in agreement. It was never at a point where all of us wanted to do it at the same time. Most importantly for us, we became friends again after the group broke up, and continued that way {{for the rest of the}} time. That was more important to us than the band.|$|E

[...] His name was removed from the title page of most subsequent editions. [...] According to a study of the Manual by critic Joseph Jones in Canadian Notes & Queries, a literary journal, some later editions experienced a falloff in quality. [...] Nevertheless, <b>Jones</b> <b>says</b> the Manual stands as an icon of its age. [...] It made significant appearances in at least five 20th-century novels, including John Irving's A Prayer for Owen Meany, and it continues to be pored over by journalists, ...|$|E
500|$|As {{there is}} {{insufficient}} {{evidence to prove}} Milhouse ate all the food, Bart acquits him. Upset, the other students attempt to kill Milhouse along with Bart and Lisa, who tried to intervene. They chase them into a cave, where it is revealed that Milhouse's [...] "monster" [...] is actually a wild boar. On one of the boar's tusks is an empty bag of chips, revealing {{that it was the}} actual culprit who ate the snacks. Lisa notices that the boar has survived by licking slime from the sides of rocks and proclaims they can likewise live off the slime. The other kids instead kill the boar and eat it, while Lisa adheres to her vegetarianism by licking slime from rocks. A deus ex machina narration by James Earl <b>Jones</b> <b>says</b> the children are eventually rescued by Moe Szyslak.|$|E
500|$|Corwin Jones {{was arrested}} on May 10, 2008, {{at the age of}} 19 in LaSalle Parish on a charge of {{misdemeanor}} simple battery. The Sheriff's Department alleges that three days earlier, Jones had struck a man from behind as several people, including Jones, came toward the man and his friends, with Jones' companions carrying baseball bats. Jones denied fault, saying that the incident was caused by a fight the previous day in which <b>Jones</b> <b>says</b> he was not involved, that he had been harassed and intimidated, and [...] "that the incident that day 'struck a nerve and I reacted'." [...] Jones had previously been arrested on January 24, 2008, on a trespass-related charge. According to his father, Jones received his diploma from Jena High School because he had completed his school work before his arrest. He moved out of Jena and was working in a hotel.|$|E
500|$|St Gallgo's Church {{stands to}} the {{southwest}} of the village of Llanallgo, near the eastern coast of Anglesey, north Wales. It is about [...] from Llangefni, the county town. According to the 19th-century writer Samuel Lewis, St Gallgo established the first church here in the early 7th century; Angharad Llwyd, a 19th-century historian of Anglesey, gives the foundation year as 605. Another writer, Geraint Jones, puts it earlier, and says in his 2006 guide to the churches of Anglesey that Gallgo established {{the church in the}} early 6th century; <b>Jones</b> <b>says</b> that it is [...] "one of the oldest Christian sites in Anglesey." [...] Gallgo was one of the sons of St Caw, a king from northern Britain, and a brother of St Gildas and St Eugrad (the latter establishing the nearby church of St Eugrad's in about 605 as well. Llwyd also recorded that there was a well near the church named after Gallgo, and said that [...] "miraculous cures" [...] had been ascribed to the waters, which were [...] "strongly impregnated with sulphate of lime".|$|E

2500|$|Bain {{reported}} that associates in Jones' modeling schools asserted that Jones indeed had some puzzling absences – supposed business trips where {{little or no}} business seemed to be conducted. Bain also writes that another piece of evidence came forth when [...] "Candy inadvertently held onto a passport of 'Arlene Grant': Candy in a dark wig and dark makeup". <b>Jones</b> <b>says</b> she had no memory of dressing up in such an outfit, or of posing for a passport in a different name.|$|E
2500|$|Howard <b>Jones</b> <b>says</b> [...] "Madame Nhu was chauffeured {{in a black}} Mercedes {{and wore}} a small diamond crucifix", and [...] "wore form-fitting apparel so tight that one French {{correspondent}} suggestively described her as 'molded into her ... dress like a dagger in its sheath.' On formal occasions, she wore red satin pantaloons with three vertical pleats, which was {{the mark of the}} highest-ranking women of the imperial court in ancient Annam." [...] When Diệm once criticized her apparel, she snapped: [...] "It's not your neck that sticks out, it's mine. So, shut up." ...|$|E
2500|$|For 35 years, Barry Jones, who was {{a member}} of both the Victorian and Federal Parliaments refused to comment {{publicly}} on Ryan's hanging. Mr Jones broke his silence in 2002 at the launch of Mike Richards' book, The Hanged Man. Mr <b>Jones</b> <b>says</b> he remains [...] "unsure" [...] of whether Ryan ever pulled the trigger. [...] "It seemed to me that there was probably a reasonable doubt in the case," [...] he said. Mr Jones, also the former secretary of the Victorian Anti-Hanging Committee says he believes Ryan's hanging was an attempt by then Victorian Premier Henry Bolte, to push his law and order agenda.|$|E
2500|$|Not all the Pythons {{agree on}} the {{definition}} of the movie's tone. There was a brief exchange that occurred when the surviving members reunited in Aspen, Colorado, in 1998. In the section where Life of Brian is discussed, Terry <b>Jones</b> <b>says,</b> [...] "I think the film is heretical, but it's not blasphemous." [...] Eric Idle can be heard to concur, adding, [...] "It's a heresy." [...] However, John Cleese, disagreeing, counters, [...] "I don’t think it's a heresy. It's making fun of the way that people misunderstand the teaching." [...] Jones responds, [...] "Of course it's a heresy, John! It's attacking the Church! And that has to be heretical." [...] Cleese replies, [...] "No, it's not attacking the Church, necessarily. It's about people who cannot agree with each other." ...|$|E
2500|$|Chuck Jones, Pepé's creator, {{wrote that}} Pepé was based (loosely) on the {{personality}} of his Termite Terrace colleague, writer Tedd Pierce, a self-styled [...] "ladies' man" [...] who reportedly always assumed that his infatuations were reciprocated. [...] Pepé's voice, provided by Mel Blanc, was based on Charles Boyer's Pépé le Moko from Algiers (1938), a remake of the 1937 French film Pépé le Moko. Eddie Selzer, animation producer—and Jones' bitterest foe—at Warners then once profanely commented {{that no one would}} laugh at those cartoons. [...] However, this did not keep Selzer from accepting an award for one of Pepé's pictures several years later. There have been theories that Pepé was based on Maurice Chevalier. However, in the short film, Chuck Jones: Memories of Childhood, <b>Jones</b> <b>says</b> Pepé was actually based on himself, but that he was very shy with girls, and Pepé obviously was not. A prototype Pepé appears in 1947's Bugs Bunny Rides Again, but sounds similar to Porky Pig.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most common}} {{argument}} then, across {{the research is}} that Stella Browne had the most trouble getting her two beliefs to coexist appropriately. [...] <b>Jones</b> <b>says</b> that Browne constantly needed {{to be on the}} offensive around her ideals on eugenics around her socialist friends and Rowbotham comments on Browne’s “continuing double struggle” to maintain both of these ideals finding connections between the two, which others in her two separate streams of struggle may not have agreed with fully. Browne was a hardworking woman who believed in her work so much so that she was even considered to have a “personal intransigence [...] meant she was as often at odds with her allies as with this her enemies.” [...] One from the literature on Browne can conclude that she has value to the study of women’s sexuality and sexual reform that historians who have studied her believe should continue to be explored and brought to the public’s attention.|$|E
2500|$|Jon Pareles from The New York Times added [...] "The {{productions}} flaunt Timbaland trademarks: vocal sounds imitating turntable scratching, quick keyboard arabesques, grunts as percussion. But now {{he fills}} in the spaces {{that made his}} old tracks so startling. [...] For a few moments Timbaland ignores the Top 10 and accepts that he’s an adult." [...] Slant magazine's Jesse Cataldo who said [...] "Shock Value II is a vanity project, the kind of bonus fluff {{that you can get}} away with releasing when you're as famous and respected as Timbaland. [...] To be fair, Timbaland is not a terrible rapper. His clumsy flow is no worse than Diddy's jittery streams of twaddle, but it's just as annoying. The tendency here, whether intentional or not, is to surround himself with mediocre talent rather than the titans who he helped make superstars [...] The overall laziness of that facet is even more inexcusable coming from one of the most renowned producers of the last decade.". The most positive review comes from USA Today, Steve <b>Jones</b> <b>says</b> [...] "He misses occasionally on this 17-track opus, but he's mainly on target with his jolts to the eardrums." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jones, a Sydney-based broadcaster, has criticised Sydney Lord Mayor Clover Moore's {{efforts to}} close lane ways and parking {{areas in the}} city of Sydney to cars. <b>Jones</b> <b>says</b> that this unduly inconveniences long-distance commuters and {{adversely}} affects city based businesses. On 29 June 2011, Jones said of the Lord Mayor of Sydney ... "put her in the same chaff bag as Julia Gillard and throw them both out to sea" [...] and about Greens leader Bob Brown ... "The woman's [...] off her tree and quite frankly they should shove her and Bob Brown in a chaff bag and take them as far out to sea as they can and tell them to swim home." [...] In February 2011, Jones asked Gillard on-air how she felt about being called [...] "Ju-liar" [...] and that [...] "......are saying that we've got a liar running the country" [...] following the reversal of her pre-election pledge not to introduce a new carbon tax. He also criticised her for being 10 minutes late for his program. These comments attracted condemnation from critics, including ABC Television's Jonathan Holmes of Media Watch.|$|E
2500|$|Doug Jones as the Faun and the Pale Man. As the Faun, Jones guides Ofelia to {{the fantasy}} world. As the Pale Man, {{he plays a}} {{grotesque}} monster with an appetite for children. Jones had previously worked with del Toro on Mimic and Hellboy, and said the director sent him an email saying, [...] "You must be in this film. No one else can play this part but you." [...] Jones responded enthusiastically to an English translation of the script, but then found out the film was in Spanish, {{which he did not}} speak. <b>Jones</b> <b>says</b> he was [...] "terrified" [...] and del Toro suggested learning the script phonetically, but Jones rejected this, preferring to learn the words himself. He said, [...] "I really, really buckled down and committed myself to learning that word for word and I got the pronunciation semi-right before I even went in," [...] using the five hours a day he spent getting the costume and make-up on to practice the words. Del Toro later decided to dub Jones with the voice of Pablo Adán, [...] "an authoritative theatre actor", but Jones's efforts remained valuable because the voice actor was able to match his delivery with Jones's mouth movements. Jones's dual casting is intended to suggest that the Pale Man (along with the toad) is either a creation of the Faun, or the Faun himself in another form.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the early}} reforms under Islam in the 7th century, reforms in women's rights {{affected}} marriage, divorce and inheritance. Lindsay <b>Jones</b> <b>says</b> {{that women were}} not accorded with such legal status in other cultures, including the West, until centuries later. The Oxford Dictionary of Islam states that the general improvement {{of the status of}} Arab women included prohibition of female infanticide and recognizing women's full personhood. [...] "The dowry, previously regarded as a bride-price paid to the father, became a nuptial gift retained by the wife as part of her personal property." [...] Under Islamic law, marriage was no longer viewed as a [...] "status" [...] but rather as a [...] "contract", in which the woman's consent was imperative. [...] "Women were given inheritance rights in a patriarchal society that had previously restricted inheritance to male relatives." [...] Annemarie Schimmel states that [...] "compared to the pre-Islamic position of women, Islamic legislation meant an enormous progress; the woman has the right, at least according to the letter of the law, to administer the wealth she has brought into the family or has earned by her own work." [...] William Montgomery Watt states that Muhammad, in the historical context of his time, {{can be seen as a}} figure who testified on behalf of women's rights and improved things considerably. Watt explains: [...] "At the time Islam began, the conditions of women were terrible - they had no right to own property, were supposed to be the property of the man, and if the man died everything went to his sons." [...] Muhammad, however, by [...] "instituting rights of property ownership, inheritance, education and divorce, gave women certain basic safeguards." [...] Haddad and state that [...] "Muhammad granted women rights and privileges in the sphere of family life, marriage, education, and economic endeavors, rights that help improve women's status in society." ...|$|E
60|$|But Kernin {{says that}} with his patent {{apparatus}} {{if you get a}} fish on you can play him. <b>Jones</b> <b>says</b> to Hades with playing him: give him a fish on his line and he'll haul him in all right. Kernin says he'd lose him. But <b>Jones</b> <b>says</b> he wouldn't. In fact he guarantees to haul the fish in. Kernin says that more than once--in Lake Rosseau--he has played a fish for over half an hour. I forget now why he stopped; I think the fish quit playing.|$|E

And then you won't forget poor old nursey-pursey.' ...|$|E
60|$|As for the {{railroad}} man--quite so, the reader knows {{it as well}} as I do--you can tell him because he carries a pole that he cut in the bush himself, with a ten-cent line wrapped round the end of it. <b>Jones</b> <b>says</b> he can catch as many fish with this kind of line as Kernin can with his patent rod and wheel. So he can too. Just the same number.|$|E

[...] Then in answer to exclamations, half-dismayed, half-wondering, [...] "Yes, it is all right, so Nurse <b>Jones</b> <b>says.</b> I could not send to you, for we had to send everywhere at once.

60|$|They {{might have}} gone on {{laughing}} for quite a time, but Charlie Jones interrupted by saying that in his opinion a landing net {{is a piece of}} darned foolishness. Here Popley agrees with him. Kernin objects that if you don't use a net you'll lose your fish {{at the side of the}} boat. <b>Jones</b> <b>says</b> no: give him a hook well through the fish and a stout line in his hand and that fish has got to come in. Popley says so too. He says let him have his hook fast through the fish's head with a short stout line, and put him (Popley) at the other end of that line and that fish will come in. It's got to. Otherwise Popley will know why. That's the alternative. Either the fish must come in or Popley must know why. There's no escape from the logic of it.|$|E
