5|$|Historians {{have often}} {{referred}} to Conroy as someone with strong ambition, {{with varying degrees of}} positive or negative opinion. Rumours circulated during and after his lifetime that he was perhaps the Duchess of Kent's lover. Queen Victoria was shocked to <b>hear</b> <b>this,</b> stating that her mother's piety would have prevented it.|$|E
5|$|Basically, {{a lot of}} {{you know}} the {{political}} situation in my professional career is not positive. It's been really, really hard. I don't even know if this message is going to get to you because I don't know if they want you to <b>hear</b> <b>this.</b> I'm getting a lot of negative feedback from certain corporate people. But I am not willing to give up.|$|E
5|$|When Valérie becomes pregnant, {{she tells}} {{each of her}} lovers (and her husband) {{that he is the}} father. She gives birth to a {{stillborn}} child, however, and her husband dies soon thereafter. Hulot and Crevel are ecstatic when they <b>hear</b> <b>this</b> news, each believing that he will become her only love once the official mourning period has passed. Valérie chooses Crevel for his comfortable fortune, and they quickly wed. This news outrages Baron Montès, and he devises a plot to poison the newlyweds. Crevel and Valérie die slowly, their bodies devoured by an exotic Brazilian toxin.|$|E

5|$|While Elaine is {{depressed}} {{about the}} low quality of her apartment, Jerry overhears Harold (Glenn Shadix) and Manny (Tony Plana), {{the managers of}} his apartment building, discussing a death that makes an apartment available. Shocked by the low rent, Jerry immediately tells Elaine {{that he will be}} able to get her the apartment above his. She is extremely excited to <b>hear</b> <b>this,</b> as s{{he will be able to}} live near Jerry. Though excited at first, Jerry later realizes how intrusive Elaine might become, and that living with her might get annoying. He discusses his problem with George, but the topic of their conversation changes and they eventually talk about wearing a wedding ring to a party, to see how women will react. George dislikes the idea at first, but eventually borrows one from Jerry's neighbor Kramer (Michael Richards) to experiment.|$|E
5|$|Gov. Schwarzenegger again {{appealed to}} the Supreme Court, looking to {{overturn}} the Ninth Circuit's ruling, filing a writ of certiorari to the Court in May 2009. The Supreme Court agreed to hear the case, at this point filed as Schwarzenegger v. Entertainment Merchants Ass'n. The fact that the Court accepted this case was considered surprising, based on the previous case record for such violent video game laws that were unanimously overturned in other states. Analysts believe that because the Court agreed to <b>hear</b> <b>this</b> case, there are unanswered questions between the protection of free speech from the First Amendment, and the legal enforcement of protecting minors from unprotected free speech such as through restrictions on the sales of pornography to minors. Just a week prior to {{the acceptance of the}} certiorari, in United States v. Stevens the Court overturned another law that sought restrictions on depictions of animal cruelty, which some analysts felt would reflect the Court's position to likely overturn the violent video game law.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the medieval}} common law, {{there was only}} one way to resolve a dispute seeking the {{repayment}} of money or other contract matters; a writ of debt, which only the Court of Common Pleas could <b>hear.</b> <b>This</b> was archaic, did not work against the executors of a will and involved precise pleading; a minor flaw in the documents put to the court could see the case thrown out. By the middle of the 16th century lawyers had attempted to devise an alternative using the action of assumpsit, which was technically a type of trespass due to deceit. The argument was based on the idea that there was an inherent promise in a contract to pay the money, and that by failing to pay the defendant had deceived the plaintiff. By 1558 the lawyers had succeeded, with the Court of King's Bench agreeing to hear cases under this piece of legal fiction. The judges of the Common Pleas, however, a more traditional group, rejected this argument and only accepted cases where an actual promise had been made in addition to the contract.|$|E

25|$|After {{the gang}} {{comes to a}} circus, Lisa entertains the patrons of an under-used merry-go-round. As night falls, she reunites with her horse, Blanka (Zorka), after hearing its neigh. But a nasty {{surprise}} awaits everyone: Dirty Rat makes a deal with Lisa's ringmaster in which he vows to reach Marco's house with a fast horse, and steal the family chest. Lapitch and friends plan to stop him for good when they <b>hear</b> <b>this.</b>|$|E
25|$|The main {{character}} of the novel, Moorthy, is a young Brahmin who leaves {{for the city to}} study, where he becomes familiar with Gandhian philosophy. He begins living a Gandhian lifestyle, wearing home-spun khaddar and discarded foreign clothes and speaking out against the caste system. This causes the village priest to turn against Moorthy and excommunicate him. Heartbroken to <b>hear</b> <b>this,</b> Moorthy's mother Narasamma dies. After this, Moorthy starts living with an educated widow, Rangamma, who is active in India’s independence movement.|$|E

25|$|Liandra {{herself is}} a former {{guardian}} angel who had been employed by God (indeed, she was God's favorite). She states {{that the role of}} Guardians is to protect humans they are assigned to by giving them orders; however, the humans merely <b>hear</b> <b>this</b> as a suggestion in their head, and have the free will to heed it or not. Guardians are typically invisible to humans, though there have been exceptions. Lee's son Jude is a Catholic priest.|$|E
25|$|The first post-Revolution Cuban {{dance music}} genre was the short-lived, but highly {{influential}} mozambique (1963). Neither the dance, nor the music caught on outside of Cuba. In spite of this, members of Eddie Palmieri's Conjunto la Perfecta did <b>hear</b> <b>this</b> new music over shortwave radio, inspiring {{them to create}} a similar rhythm which they also called mozambique. Although the two rhythms share no parts in common, the band received death threats because some right wing Cuban exiles thought Palmieri's band was playing contemporary Cuban music.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{arrival in}} Storybrooke, Dr. Jekyll finds the town more {{beautiful}} than they described it to him; David and Mary Margaret take him to Granny's for a meal. Emma tells Hook she loves him, with both ready to take their relationship further. Henry prepares {{to say good-bye to}} Violet, believing she and her father, Sir Morgan, will return to Camelot. However, Violet reveals that while she was born in Camelot, her father is from Connecticut, but fell into a portal to Camelot at one point; thus they will remain in the Real World.

25|$|When an {{aircraft}} exceeds Mach 1 (i.e. the sound barrier), a large pressure difference is created {{just in front}} of the aircraft. This abrupt pressure difference, called a shock wave, spreads backward and outward from the aircraft in a cone shape (a so-called Mach cone). It is this shock wave that causes the sonic boom heard as a fast moving aircraft travels overhead. A person inside the aircraft will not <b>hear</b> <b>this.</b> The higher the speed, the more narrow the cone; at just over M = 1 it is hardly a cone at all, but closer to a slightly concave plane.|$|E
25|$|Jochanaan {{emerges from}} the cistern and shouts prophecies {{regarding}} Herod and Herodias that no one understands, except Salome when the Prophet refers to her mother. Upon seeing Jochanaan, Salome is filled with an overwhelming desire for him, praising his white skin and asking to touch it, but he rejects her. She then praises his black hair, again asking to touch it, but is rejected once more. She finally begs for a kiss from Jochanaan's lips, and Narraboth, who cannot bear to <b>hear</b> <b>this,</b> kills himself. As Jochanaan is returned to the well, he preaches salvation through the Messiah.|$|E
25|$|In March 2010, Kendall {{finds out}} Greenlee is alive when she {{shows up in}} Spain, where she and Zach are staying. Greenlee accuses Kendall of trying to kill her to get Ryan to herself. Kendall denies this, but Greenlee refuses to <b>hear</b> <b>this</b> and leaves, not {{forgiving}} Kendall. In August 2010, Kendall comes back when Ryan is admitted to the hospital. She finds out Ryan is faking his prognosis because Greenlee, who is now married to David Hayward, is in trouble. Kendall initially doesn't want to get involved, but eventually decides to help Greenlee. Zach is close on her trail, and lets Kendall know he just wants her to be happy.|$|E

25|$|The {{ruling was}} {{appealed to the}} U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit in Denver, Colorado. On August 17, 2006, the Appeals Court upheld the FDA's ban of ephedra alkaloids, finding that the 133,000 page {{administrative}} record compiled by the FDA supported the agency's finding that ephedra alkaloids posed an unreasonable risk to consumers. Nutraceutical Corp. filed a petition for a writ of certiorari seeking a rehearing on the ban of ephedra alkaloids; however, on May 14, 2007 the United States Supreme Court declined to <b>hear</b> <b>this</b> petition. The sale of ephedra alkaloids containing dietary supplements remains illegal in the United States. Sales of products containing ephedra extract not containing ephedrine remain legal.|$|E
25|$|During the trial, Taylor {{received}} {{a series of}} anonymous letters from a person claiming to be an officer who worked with Burge. The anonymous letters asserted that what happened to Wilson {{was part of a}} decades-old pattern of police torture, led by Burge, that victimized African-American detainees. These letters led Taylor and his colleagues to other alleged torture victims, but federal court trial Judge Brian Barnett Duff did not permit the jury to <b>hear</b> <b>this</b> evidence; he held Taylor and Haas in contempt of court. After eight weeks of trial, the jury was unable to reach a verdict. The case was retried later in the year. After a second trial that lasted eight weeks, an all-white jury found Burge not guilty, but the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the verdict, based on ?. Eventually Wilson was awarded more than $1 million in attorney's fees and $100,000 in damages; the $100,000 went to the estate of the officers who were killed in 1982.|$|E
25|$|Governor Paterson's {{directive}} {{was challenged}} as both premature and unconstitutional in an Article 78 proceeding filed on June 3, 2008, against Governor Paterson by the Alliance Defense Fund {{on behalf of}} several state legislators and conservative leaders; this lawsuit failed at all levels. On September 2, 2008, Justice Lucy A. Billings, of the State Supreme Court in Bronx, New York, issued a decision that Governor Paterson acted within his powers when he required state agencies to recognize same-sex marriages from outside the state. Justice Billings found that the governor's order was consistent with state laws on the recognition of marriages from other jurisdictions. The Court of Appeals agreed to <b>hear</b> <b>this</b> and another case on same-sex marriage recognition in 2009. The Court decided these cases on narrow grounds, finding that the state acted within its authority without reaching the issue of marriage recognition; however, a three-justice minority would have ruled more broadly in support of marriage recognition.|$|E
