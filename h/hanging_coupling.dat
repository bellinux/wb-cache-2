50|$|The {{increasing}} {{popularity of}} the aluminum artificial Christmas tree, first manufactured in 1958, made this device far less attractive to the consumer, as an artificial tree had no gaps to be filled. The added expense of the lengthy <b>hanging</b> wire <b>coupled</b> with the diminishing need caused this feature to be discontinued in 1960.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} the hitherto unknown matutinal mating behaviour of Aeshna grandis {{and found that}} matings basically occurred at dawn. With the first morning light males began performing a searching flight for females that roosted deep in terrestrial vegetation characterized by reed, rush and grass. Matutinal mating in the distinctive twisted wheel position is documented. Twisted wheels are unique as they are not formed in flight but while perching on vegetation and they show no readiness to escape. The twisted position, with the male hanging upside down and his appendages being obliquely slipped across the female’s head, {{is the result of}} the formation of mating wheels with the female perched. Later in the morning we observed feeding flight at suitable sites and resting in low vegetation of a wet meadow. During this resting phase some males inspected the vegetation on the wing, described here as ‘mid-morning searching flight’. In this situation and also when foraging individuals aggregated, we found untwisted, upright <b>hanging</b> <b>couples,</b> which we interpret as wheels formed in flight – an indication of alternative mating tactics. Aeshna viridis, also known to exhibit matutinal matings, occurred syntopically and behaved similarly. We interpret the energy-sapping searching flight at dawn as sexual selection: females select genetic quality by choosing only the fittest mates. uploaded for Odonatologica by Plaz...|$|R
50|$|The <b>hanging</b> shows <b>couples</b> strolling, {{the long}} shadows {{suggesting}} a late afternoon in summer. A gentleman doffs his hat while his lady holds out her closed fan, the lappets of her headdress rippling in the breeze. A spaniel chases a squirrel up a tree, peacocks strut around and swans glide on the lake. Orange trees in Chinese pots and laden fruit trees {{contribute to the}} graceful affluence of the scene. Embroidered hangings such as this were used like woven tapestries, lining {{the walls of a}} room with decorative, narrative scenes, and bringing the country or garden inside the house. Despite their large scale they manage to convey a sense of intimacy in their celebration of private family pleasures.|$|R
60|$|She {{was destined}} to learn much from the strange woman. The {{acquaintance}} had begun one day when Saxon, in the back yard, was <b>hanging</b> out a <b>couple</b> of corset covers and several pieces of her finest undergarments. The woman leaning on the rail of her back porch, had caught her eye, and nodded, as it seemed to Saxon, half to her and half to the underlinen on the line.|$|R
5000|$|Newton's {{interpretation}} {{rested on}} typical alchemical associations, construing Vulcan as a stand-in for fire, Venus for copper, and Mars for iron; Vulcan, the craftsman of the gods, having made a metal net {{for the purpose}} of <b>hanging</b> the adulterous <b>couple</b> from a high ceiling, Newton saw the use of iron to reduce antimony sulfide at high temperature to antimony regulus, and combining it with copper to produce the [...] "network" [...] on the alloy, as fulfilling the real meaning of the story.|$|R
5000|$|The {{plate for}} [...] "The Little Girl Lost" [...] {{features}} a couple embracing in a kiss with the woman's arm reaching upward. There {{is also a}} presence of nature with birds flying and branches <b>hanging</b> above the <b>couple.</b> A vine with a snake breaks up the first two stanzas {{from the rest of}} the poem. According to the scholars, Rodney Baine and Mary Baine, the embracing lovers featured on the poem's plate helps to [...] "suggest that Lyca journeys into the sexuality of adulthood, of experience.|$|R
50|$|Christian {{abandons}} {{his girlfriend}} and leaves the party with Barbara, upsetting Alex. They drive through a wooded area, where they see lingerie-clad mannequins <b>hanging.</b> The <b>couple</b> winds up back at Barbara's motel. Christian tells Barbara about a terrible childhood incident with his father, and Barbara explains that Alex is not her boyfriend but more of a provider. After some flirtation, Barbara makes an odd request: Christian must shave his beard before the two have sex. He complies. As Christian shaves in the bathroom, he hears a noise outside. He pokes {{his head out the}} open window and is assaulted by a man with a gun. The man, Tatum, enters the bathroom and threatens Christian. A brief struggle ensues wherein Tatum is shot and killed. Christian leaves the bathroom and tells Barbara everything. Strangely at ease with the concept of a dead man in her room, she convinces Christian that {{the best thing to do}} is run. The pair go to a friend's place, a seaside castle and lighthouse.|$|R

The extreme forms of punishment were meted out for acts of treason against state or Crown, rather than simple crime.|$|R

50|$|After the {{liquidation}} of the ghetto, Kittel {{visited the}} remaining labor camps and terrorized their inmates. On 15 October, he inspected Kailis forced labor camp and deported 30 Jews for execution in Ponary. In late 1943, Germans arrested {{a couple that}} escaped from the HKP 562 forced labor camp. Kittel organized a public <b>hanging</b> of the <b>couple</b> and their daughter, but the noose tore. He then personally shot {{the man and the}} woman; another Gestapo man shot the child. In December, Kittel demanded the location of Salk Dessler, deputy of Jacob Gens who escaped the ghetto. Dessler was betrayed by a former Jewish policeman and arrested with about 30 other Jews; most of them were executed. On 27 March 1944, Kittel was in Kovno Ghetto participating in the Kinderaktion, a roundup of about 1,700 children and the elderly. Kittel also interrogated Jewish policemen on their assistance to Jewish partisans and selected 33 of them for execution at the Ninth Fort.|$|R
50|$|It was {{released}} on June 20, 2008 and premiered on FNMTV. The music video shows a group of friends, {{in which there are}} <b>couples</b> <b>hanging</b> out. The music video starts with the band playing, and then moves on to a group friends along with Boys Like Girls members going to a restaurant to eat and starts having a food fight, with intervals of the band playing. The friends then go a field, where they drink and laugh. The friends then start making a human pyramid, but fail. The <b>couples</b> start <b>hanging</b> out alone and making out. From this on, the band is shown playing in the rain. The friends are then shown going to a swimming pool and start swimming, with a couple making out underwater. They then run through a carpark and stand by the railings to see the sunrise. The couples are then making out again, and the music video ends with the band leaving their instruments.|$|R
50|$|As {{described}} in a film magazine, Cheyenne Harry (Carey), in his search for food, breaks into the home of Grant Young (Rattenberry) and his daughter Molly (Malone), who recognizes him {{as the man who}} held up the train she was traveling on but then allowed her to keep a brooch, a gift from her mother. Grant gives him a chance to make good by becoming an employee on the ranch. Harry enters a horse race contest to get enough money to visit his mother, but Ben Kent, a road agent and an old friend of Harry, cuts his stirrups. Grant forces Harry to assist in holding up a stage coach, and after Kent kills the driver of the coach, both he and Harry are arrested. A message announcing the pending arrival of Harry's mother (Townsend) results in the postponement of Harry's <b>hanging</b> for a <b>couple</b> of weeks, and Harry is allowed by the sheriff (Steele) to make use of Grant's ranch and daughter to deceive Harry's mother, as Harry had stated in his letters to her that he was an honorable man. After his mother's departure, a telegram arrives that exonerates Harry, and he rushes to see Molly.|$|R
