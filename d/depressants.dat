5|$|A {{midazolam}} overdose {{is considered}} a medical emergency and generally requires the immediate attention of medical personnel. Benzodiazepine overdose in healthy individuals is rarely life-threatening with proper medical support; however, the toxicity of benzodiazepines increases when they are combined with other CNS <b>depressants</b> such as alcohol, opioids, or tricyclic antidepressants. The toxicity of benzodiazepine overdose and risk of death is also increased in the elderly and those with obstructive pulmonary disease or when used intravenously. Treatment is supportive; activated charcoal can be used {{within an hour of}} the overdose. The antidote for an overdose of midazolam (or any other benzodiazepine) is flumazenil. While effective in reversing the effects of benzodiazepines it is not used in most cases as it may trigger seizures in mixed overdoses and benzodiazepine dependent individuals.|$|E
50|$|From an {{evolutionary}} perspective BotIT6 {{is linked to}} both the <b>depressant</b> and the α group. BotIT6 is similar to <b>depressant</b> insect toxins, but also has similarities to α type and excitatory toxins. BotIT6 shares 58-66% of its amino-acid sequence with <b>depressant</b> insect toxins, and 24-34% with alfa type and excitatory toxins. In addition, it shares functional characteristics with all three groups. This {{has led to the}} hypothesis that BotIT6 could be an ancestral <b>depressant</b> toxin.|$|R
40|$|Saraca indica is {{popularly known}} as Ashoka {{and one of the}} most legendary and sacred trees of India. Saraca indica is a {{medicinal}} plant widely used in Ayurveda to treat painful conditions, improves complexion of the body, improves digestion and assimilation, alleviates excessive thirst, to kills all infectious agents, in blood disease, inflammation and also as CNS <b>depressant.</b> In view of alleged CNS <b>depressant</b> potential, the present study was carried out to evaluate the central nervous system <b>depressant</b> activity of different extracts of Saraca indica leaves. Saraca indica leaves extracted successively with petroleum ether, chloroform, methanol and water respectively depending upon their polarity. CNS <b>depressant</b> activity was evaluated using pentobarbitone induced sleeping time and by determining locomotor activity using actophotometer. Methanolic extract of Saraca indica leaves (400 mg/kg) produced highest activity as it significantly (P< 0. 01) reduced the onset and prolonged of sleep duration induced by pentobarbitone, extract also decreased locomotor activity by 67. 33 %. Water, chloroform and petroleum ether extract also produced dose dependent CNS <b>depressant</b> activity. Though petroleum ether extract does not produce significant CNS <b>depressant</b> activity in both models.

5|$|Many drugs, {{including}} oral contraceptives, some antibiotics, antidepressants, and antifungal agents, inhibit cytochrome enzymes in the liver. They {{reduce the}} rate of elimination of the benzodiazepines that are metabolized by CYP450, leading to possibly excessive drug accumulation and increased side-effects. In contrast, drugs that induce cytochrome P450 enzymes, such as St John's wort, the antibiotic rifampicin, and the anticonvulsants carbamazepine and phenytoin, accelerate elimination of many benzodiazepines and decrease their action. Taking benzodiazepines with alcohol, opioids and other central nervous system <b>depressants</b> potentiates their action. This often results in increased sedation, impaired motor coordination, suppressed breathing, and other adverse effects that have potential to be lethal. Antacids can slow down absorption of some benzodiazepines; however, this effect is marginal and inconsistent.|$|E
5|$|There is {{controversy}} {{concerning the}} safety of benzodiazepines in pregnancy. While they are not major teratogens, uncertainty remains {{as to whether they}} cause cleft palate in a small number of babies and whether neurobehavioural effects occur as a result of prenatal exposure; they are known to cause withdrawal symptoms in the newborn. Benzodiazepines can be taken in overdoses and can cause dangerous deep unconsciousness. However, they are less toxic than their predecessors, the barbiturates, and death rarely results when a benzodiazepine is the only drug taken. When combined with other central nervous system (CNS) <b>depressants</b> such as alcoholic drinks and opioids, the potential for toxicity and fatal overdose increases. Benzodiazepines are commonly misused and taken in combination with other drugs of abuse.|$|E

40|$|The {{presence}} of a myocardial <b>depressant</b> in the plasma of canines subjected to hemorrhagic shock or derived from homogenates of canine pancreas subjected to shock-like conditions was confirmed with in vitro preparations of both isometric and isotonic contracting young canine papillary muscles. A system was developed to bioassay whole fresh plasma. Shock plasma, but not control plasma, significantly depressed the rate of muscle shortening (Vc) and relaxation (Vr) but did not alter maximum isotonic load (Po). Homogenates of canine pancreas which had been incubated under hypoxic conditions were fractionated by gel chromatography. <b>Depressant</b> activity was localized in a peak with a molecular weight between 500 - 1000. The peak from shock but not control homogenate depressed peak developed tension (AT), the rate of tension developed (+dT/dt), relaxation (-dT/dt), latency (LAT), and the time to maximum velocity of relaxation (TMVR). The effects of temperature and frequency stimulation {{and the influence of}} these factors on the contractile function of isolated myocardium in response to the <b>depressant</b> peak were evaluated. Muscle function was improved by cooling or increasing the frequency of stimulation. Cooling increases AT and shortens LAT, time to maximum rate of developed tension (+dT/dt), the time to peak tension (TPT), the time to maximum rate of decline in tension (-dT/dt), and duration of contraction (DUR). Cooling from 37 C to 27 C antagonized the depression of Po due to the shock material at either frequency (F) tested (12 or 60 /minute). A faster frequency of stimulation antagonized the <b>depressant</b> effect on Po at 37 C and both Vc and Vr at 27 C. Higher frequency also antagonized the slowing effect on all time intervals due to the <b>depressant.</b> Relaxation was the parameter most consistently and significantly affected by the <b>depressant</b> factor and may be an important criterion for evaluating the role and mechanism of action of endogenous myocardial <b>depressant</b> factors. It can be concluded that altered temperature or frequency of an isolated tissue preparation can affect the response to an endogenous myocardial <b>depressant</b> and may explain failure of other laboratories to detect such a <b>depressant...</b>|$|R
