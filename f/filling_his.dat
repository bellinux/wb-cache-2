5|$|Chrysippus was a {{prolific}} writer. He {{is said to}} rarely have gone without writing 500 lines a day and he composed more than 705 works. His desire to be comprehensive meant {{that he would take}} both sides of an argument and his opponents accused him of <b>filling</b> <b>his</b> books with the quotations of others. He was considered diffuse and obscure in his utterances and careless in his style, but his abilities were highly regarded, and he came {{to be seen as a}} preeminent authority for the school.|$|E
5|$|All of Pierce's cabinet {{nominations}} {{were confirmed}} unanimously and immediately by the Senate. Pierce {{spent the first}} few weeks of his term sorting through hundreds of lower-level federal positions to be filled. This was a chore, as he sought to represent all factions of the party, and could fully satisfy none of them. Partisans found themselves unable to secure positions for their friends, which put the Democratic Party on edge and fueled bitterness between factions. Before long, northern newspapers accused Pierce of <b>filling</b> <b>his</b> government with pro-slavery secessionists, while southern newspapers accused him of abolitionism.|$|E
5|$|On July 21, 1961, Grissom was {{pilot of}} the second Project Mercury flight, Mercury-Redstone 4, which he named Liberty Bell 7. This was a sub-orbital flight that lasted 15 minutes and 37 seconds. After splashdown, {{emergency}} explosive bolts unexpectedly fired and blew the hatch off, causing water to flood into the spacecraft. Quickly exiting through the open hatch and into the ocean, Grissom nearly drowned as water began <b>filling</b> <b>his</b> spacesuit. A recovery helicopter tried to lift and retrieve the spacecraft, but the flooding spacecraft became too heavy, and it was ultimately cut loose before sinking.|$|E

5|$|On the ground, it {{appeared}} that Virginia Tech had the edge in experience, forcing Georgia's defense to concentrate on stopping Tech's run game. Virginia Tech running back Branden Ore suffered an ankle injury in the Hokies' regular-season game against Wake Forest, but still took {{the field in the}} Chick-fil-A Bowl. The same could not be said for Georgia, whose original starting running back, Thomas Brown, suffered a season-ending knee injury in October. <b>Filling</b> <b>his</b> role were two inexperienced players: Kregg Lumpkin and Danny Ware. Making up for this inexperience, the two players were coached by Tony Ball, a former Virginia Tech wide receivers coach with insights into the Tech defense.|$|E

25|$|Haiti was {{the first}} {{government}} of an independent state that recognised the revolution. Jean-Pierre Boyer, President of Haiti, following a Greek request for assistance, addressed a letter on 15 January 1822. In the letter sent to Greek expatriates living in France, Adamantios Korais, Christodoulos Klonaris, Christodoulos Klonaris, Konstantinos Polychroniades and A. Bogorides, who had assembled themselves into a Committee which was seeking international support for the ongoing Greek revolution, expressed {{his support for the}} Greek Revolution and compared the struggle underfoot across the Atlantic to the struggle for independence in his own land. He apologized for being unable to support the Revolution in Greece financially, though he hoped {{he might be able to}} in the future. But he articulated his moral and political support for the revolution, notably by <b>filling</b> <b>his</b> letter with references to classical Greek history, demonstrating a detailed knowledge of this history and powerfully evoking the contemporary revolutionaries as the rightful heirs of their ancestors. Some historians claim that Boyer also sent to the Greeks 25 tons of Haitian coffee that could be sold and the proceeds used to purchase weapons, but not enough evidence exists to support this or the other claim that one hundred Haitian volunteers set off to fight in the Greek Revolution. Allegedly, their ship was boarded by pirates somewhere in the Mediterranean and these fighters purportedly never reached their destination.|$|E

500|$|Lochner {{worked in}} the late International Gothic (sch√∂ne stil) style, already {{considered}} dated and old-fashioned by the 1440s, yet {{is widely regarded as}} innovative. He introduced a number of progressions to painting in Cologne, especially by <b>filling</b> <b>his</b> backgrounds and landscapes with specific and elaborate details, and by rendering his figures with more bulk and volume. Wellesz described his paintings as evidencing an [...] "intensity of feeling which gives a very special and very moving quality to his work. His devotion is reflected in his figures: it charges with symbolic meaning the smallest details of his paintings; and, in a hidden, almost magical way, it speaks from the concord of his pure and glowing colours." ...|$|E

500|$|In these series, Van Gogh was not preoccupied by {{his usual}} {{interest}} in <b>filling</b> <b>his</b> paintings with subjectivity and emotion; rather the two series {{are intended to}} display his technical skill and working methods to Gauguin, {{who was about to}} visit. The 1888 paintings were created during a rare period of optimism for the artist. Vincent wrote to Theo in August 1888, [...] "I'm painting with the gusto of a Marseillais eating bouillabaisse, which won't surprise you when it's a question of painting large sunflowers... If I carry out this plan there'll be a dozen or so panels. The whole thing will therefore be a symphony in blue and yellow. I work on it all these mornings, from sunrise. Because the flowers wilt quickly and it's a matter of doing the whole thing in one go." ...|$|E
500|$|On 30 July 1966, Ramsey's promise was {{fulfilled}} as England {{became the}} World Champions by beating West Germany in the final. A lot of Ramsey's tactics and decisions proved their worth in this final. Ramsey came {{under pressure to}} restore the fit-again Jimmy Greaves to the side, but his philosophy was [...] "never change a winning team". He stuck to his guns and kept faith with Greaves's replacement, Geoff Hurst, who vindicated Ramsey's judgement by scoring a hat-trick in a 4‚Äì2 win (after extra time) at Wembley. <b>Filling</b> <b>his</b> side with a good balance of experience and youth proved vital when the gruelling final went to extra time. The youth in the team powered England through extra time. A particular example of this was Alan Ball who, at 21, was the youngest player in the England side. Even in extra time, he never showed signs of tiredness and never stopped running‚Äîfamously setting up Hurst's controversial second goal, as well as having a few chances himself. Even as the match ended with Hurst scoring England's fourth goal, Ball was still running down the pitch in case Hurst needed assistance. Rather than a cross from Hurst, Ball was greeted {{by a number of}} England fans running onto the pitch who, thinking that the game was already over, had already started celebrating England's victory.|$|E
500|$|British {{critics were}} {{especially}} enthusiastic about Nicolas Roeg's direction. In {{the view of}} Tom Milne of Monthly Film Bulletin, Roeg's combined work on Performance, Walkabout and Don't Look Now put him [...] "right {{up at the top}} as film-maker". George Melly similarly wrote in The Observer that Roeg had joined [...] "that handful of names whose appearance {{at the end of the}} credit titles automatically creates a sense of anticipation". Penelope Houston for Sight & Sound also found much to appreciate in Roeg's direction: [...] "Roeg deploys subtle powers of direction and Hitchcockian misdirection." [...] American critics were similarly impressed with Roeg's work on the film. Jay Cocks regarded Don't Look Now to be Roeg's best work by far and that Roeg was one of [...] "those rare talents that can effect a new way of seeing". Cocks also felt that the film was a marked improvement on the novella, noting that a reading [...] "makes one appreciate Roeg and Screenwriters [...] Scott and [...] Bryant all the more. Film and story share certain basic elements of plot and an ending of cruel surprise. The story is detached, almost cursory. Roeg and his collaborators have constructed an intricate, intense speculation about levels of perception and reality." [...] Roger Ebert in his review for the Chicago Sun-Times commented that Roeg is [...] "a genius at <b>filling</b> <b>his</b> frame with threatening forms and compositions", while Pauline Kael labelled him [...] "chillingly chic" [...] in hers. Even Vincent Canby, whose opinion of the film was negative overall, praised Roeg for being able to [...] "maintain a sense of menace long after the screenplay has any right to expect it".|$|E

[...] Over the Christmas and New Year period of 2007 and 2008, Mantle portrayed the villain Abanazer in a pantomime production of Aladdin at the Theatre Royal in Bath, described as an attempt by a theatre spokesman for Mantle to [...] "throw off his gentle giant persona and transform himself into a classic panto baddie for the audience to boo and hiss wildly." [...] He performed in 64 shows over the duration of five and a half weeks. In 2008, he appeared in an episode of The Invisibles, opposite Anthony Head, Warren Clarke and Jenny Agutter.

500|$|The {{earliest}} identified {{version of}} the pursuit or chase is from {{the third quarter of}} the 7th century BC. Next chronologically is the best known version on the Fran√ßois Vase by Kleitias. The number of characters shown on pottery scenes varies with {{the size and shape of}} the space available. [...] The Fran√ßois Vase is decorated with several scenes in long narrow strips. This means that the Troilus frieze is heavily populated. In the centre, (which can be seen at the Perseus Project at ,) is the fleeing Troilus, riding one horse with the reins of the other in his hand. Below them is the vase‚Äîwhich Polyxena (partially missing), who is ahead of him, has dropped. Achilles is largely missing but it is clear that he is armoured. They are running towards Troy [...] where Antenor gestures towards Priam. Hector and Polites, brothers of Troilus, emerge from the city walls in the hope of saving Troilus. Behind Achilles [...] are a number of deities, Athena, Thetis, (Achilles' mother,) Hermes, and Apollo (just arriving). Two Trojans are also present, the woman gesturing to draw the attention of a youth <b>filling</b> <b>his</b> vase. As the deities appear only in pictorial versions of the scene, their role is subject to interpretation. Boitani, sees Athena as urging Achilles on and Thetis as worried by the arrival of Apollo who, as Troilus' protector, represents a future threat to Achilles. He does not indicate what he thinks Hermes may be talking to Thetis about. The classicist and art historian Professor Thomas H. Carpenter sees Hermes as a neutral observer, Athena and Thetis as urging Achilles on and the arrival of Apollo as the artist's indication of the god's future role in Achilles' death. As Athena is not traditionally a patron of Achilles, Sommerstein sees her presence in this and other portrayals of Troilus' death as evidence of the early standing of the prophetic link between Troilus' death and the fall of Troy, Athena being driven, above all, by her desire for the city's destruction.|$|E
