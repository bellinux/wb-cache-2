Alloyed with other metals, it {{is also used}} in making carbide tools for {{metalworking}} equipment and in the production of superalloys for jet engine components, chemical process equipment, nuclear reactors, and missile parts. Because of its ductility, tantalum can be drawn into fine wires or filaments, which are used for evaporating metals such as aluminium. Since it resists attack by body fluids and is nonirritating, tantalum is widely used in making surgical instruments and implants. For example, porous tantalum coatings are used in the construction of orthopedic implants due to tantalum's ability to form a direct bond to <b>hard</b> <b>tissue.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Bone {{tissue is}} a <b>hard</b> <b>tissue,</b> {{a type of}} dense {{connective}} tissue. [...] It has a honeycomb-like matrix internally, which helps to give the bone rigidity. [...] Bone tissue {{is made up of}} different types of bone cells. Osteoblasts and osteocytes are involved in the formation and mineralization of bone; osteoclasts are involved in the resorption of bone tissue. Modified (flattened) osteoblasts become the lining cells that form a protective layer on the bone surface. The mineralised matrix of bone tissue has an organic component of mainly collagen called ossein and an inorganic component of bone mineral made up of various salts. Bone tissue is a mineralized tissue of two types, cortical bone and cancellous bone. Other types of tissue found in bones include bone marrow, endosteum, periosteum, nerves, blood vessels and cartilage.|$|E
2500|$|Depending {{on which}} hard tissues are affected, it is {{possible}} to describe caries as involving enamel, dentin, or cementum. [...] Early in its development, caries may affect only enamel. [...] Once the extent of decay reaches the deeper layer of dentin, the term [...] "dentinal caries" [...] is used. [...] Since cementum is the <b>hard</b> <b>tissue</b> that covers the roots of teeth, it is not often affected by decay unless the roots of teeth are exposed to the mouth. [...] Although the term [...] "cementum caries" [...] may be used to describe the decay on roots of teeth, very rarely does caries affect the cementum alone. [...] Roots have a very thin layer of cementum over a large layer of dentin, and thus most caries affecting cementum also affects dentin.|$|E

40|$|Recognition that conodonts {{were the}} {{earliest}} vertebrate group {{to experiment with}} skeletal biomineraliz-ation provides a window in which to study the origin and early evolution of this developmental system. It has been contended that the conodont skeleton comprised a classic suite of vertebrate <b>hard</b> <b>tissues,</b> while others suggest that conodont <b>hard</b> <b>tissues</b> represent divergent specializations within the early diversi-¢cation of vertebrate <b>hard</b> <b>tissues,</b> supporting a view that the <b>hard</b> <b>tissues</b> of conodonts, particularly enamel, exhibit a range of microstructural variation beyond that seen in vertebrates. New evidence reveals that, although variable, conodont enamel microstructure is consistent between homologous portions of homologous dentitions. Although there is a correlation between morphology and microstructure, this belies a stronger correlation between the commonality of microstructure and dental function. The enamel of conodonts evolved in response to changes in dental function and di¡erentiation of the microstructural layer {{into a number of}} enamel types and can be linked to dental occlusion, heterodonty, a permanent dentition, enamel thickness and, probably above all, the small size of the dental elements...|$|R

As a result, {{it is difficult to}} draw general conclusions about the clinical benefit of GTR. Whilst there is evidence that GTR can demonstrate a significant improvement over conventional open flap surgery, the factors affecting outcomes are unclear from the literature and these might include study conduct issues such as bias.

Materials and Methods: 230 patients at the age of 30 - 59 have been clinically examined. Results: clinical epidemiological research has proved significant prevalence of pathological tooth wear among the population of Ivano-Frankivsk region. Some clinical cases made up a separate group when pathological abrasion of dental <b>hard</b> <b>tissues</b> was complicated by dentition discontinuity, parodentium tissue disease and dento-facial deformations. Therefore, an individual approach to treatment and the usage of complex methods of diagnosis, treatment and prevention is important in orthopedic rehabilitation of such patients. Conclusions. The prevalence of pathological abrasion of dental <b>hard</b> <b>tissues</b> is 58. 6 % prevailing in generalized nature of the lesion in 81. 5 % of cases and increase in the frequency of pathological tooth wear in people at the age of 50 - 59.
