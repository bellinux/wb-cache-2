25|$|Steps towards {{constructing}} a new church at Proserpine began in 1956 when architects Barnes and Oribin of Cairns were engaged.

25|$|Originally, Indians {{were the}} ones who taught the native {{inhabitants}} about writing. This is shown through Brahmic forms of writing present in the region such as the Balinese script shown on split palm leaf called lontar (see image to the left — magnify the image to see the writing on the <b>flat</b> <b>side,</b> and the decoration on the reverse side).|$|E
25|$|A {{speculum}} is {{a circular}} or oval hand-mirror used predominantly by Etruscan women. Speculum is Latin; the Etruscan word is malena or malstria. Specula were cast in bronze as one piece {{or with a}} tang into which a wooden, bone, or ivory handle fitted. The reflecting surface was created by polishing the <b>flat</b> <b>side.</b> A higher percentage of tin in the mirror improved its ability to reflect. The other side was convex and featured intaglio or cameo scenes from mythology. The piece was generally ornate.|$|E

25|$|Over the years, {{the concept}} was further {{developed}} by MARC and its successor, Aker Arctic, together with ABB and the Finnish Funding Agency for Technology and Innovation (Tekes). In addition to icebreaking, the oblique vessel could also be utilized for oil spill response operations in both open and ice-infested waters by using the <b>flat</b> <b>side</b> to guide the oil to a recovery unit. However, {{there have also been}} doubts about the ability of the relatively small vessel to break a wide channel in ice without the much greater displacement and shaft power of a traditional icebreaker.|$|E
25|$|Scientists Emily Craig and Randall Bresee have {{attempted}} to recreate the likenesses of the shroud through the dust-transfer technique, {{which could have been}} done by medieval arts. They first did a carbon-dust drawing of a Jesus-like face (using collagen dust) on a newsprint made from wood pulp (which is similar to 13th- and 14th-century paper). They next placed the drawing on a table and covered it with a piece of linen. They then pressed the linen against the newsprint by firmly rubbing with the <b>flat</b> <b>side</b> of a wooden spoon. By doing this they managed to create a reddish-brown image with a lifelike positive likeness of a person, a three-dimensional image and no sign of brush strokes. However, according to Fanti and Moroni, this does not reproduce many special features of the Shroud at microscopic level.|$|E

25|$|Around {{serial number}} 5000, a new {{receiver}} profile was introduced which had fluted (scalloped) sides, {{as opposed to}} the original <b>flat</b> <b>sided</b> design. This new receiver reduced the weight of the rifle by a small amount, and increased the width by 1/16 of an inch. By serial number 6000, it is thought that the last of the <b>flat</b> <b>sided</b> M1895s left the factory. These early rifles are now exceedingly rare.|$|R

2500|$|A {{constant}} flow of modifications were made as production progressed. A [...] "blown" [...] cockpit hood, manufactured by Malcolm, {{was introduced in}} an effort to further increase the pilot's head-room and visibility. Many mid to late production VBs – and all VCs – used the modified, improved windscreen assembly with the integral bullet resistant centre panel and <b>flat</b> <b>side</b> screens introduced with the Mk III. Because the rear frame of this windscreen was taller than that of the earlier model the cockpit hoods were not interchangeable and could be distinguished by the wider rear framing on the hood used with the late-style windscreen.|$|E
2500|$|The trick {{would be}} to {{introduce}} a third color. For two colors one can aim at {{either side of the}} screen, but for three there is no [...] "third side" [...] that can be used. Baird's solution used a variation on his two-color system, using one side of the screen as-is, and patterning the other side with a series of horizontal triangular ridges. One gun, normally shown as red in most diagrams, fired onto the <b>flat</b> <b>side</b> of the screen, as in the two-color model. The other two guns were arranged above and below the ridged side of the screen, so they fired onto {{one side or the other}} of the ridges. These were colored green and blue. When all three guns fired, the image would be combined into a single display.|$|E
2500|$|New Horizons body forms a triangle, almost [...] thick. (The Pioneers have {{hexagonal}} bodies, {{whereas the}} Voyagers, Galileo, and Cassini–Huygens have decagonal, hollow bodies.) A 7075 aluminium alloy tube forms the main structural column, between the launch vehicle adapter ring at the [...] "rear," [...] and the [...] radio dish antenna {{affixed to the}} [...] "front" [...] <b>flat</b> <b>side.</b> The titanium fuel tank is in this tube. The RTG attaches with a 4-sided titanium mount resembling a gray pyramid or stepstool. Titanium provides strength and thermal isolation. The rest of the triangle is primarily sandwich panels of thin aluminium facesheet (less than [...] ) bonded to aluminium honeycomb core. The structure is larger than strictly necessary, with empty space inside. The structure is designed to act as shielding, reducing electronics errors caused by radiation from the RTG. Also, the mass distribution required for a spinning spacecraft demands a wider triangle.|$|E

2500|$|Following combat {{experience}} the P-51D series introduced a [...] "teardrop", or [...] "bubble", canopy to rectify problems with poor visibility {{to the rear}} of the aircraft. In America, new moulding techniques had been developed to form streamlined nose transparencies for bombers. North American designed a new streamlined plexiglass canopy for the P-51B which was later developed into the teardrop shaped bubble canopy. In late 1942, the tenth production P-51B-1-NA was removed from the assembly lines. From the windshield aft the fuselage was redesigned by cutting down the rear fuselage formers to the same height as those forward of the cockpit; the new shape faired in to the vertical tail unit. [...] A new simpler style of windscreen, with an angled bullet-resistant windscreen mounted on two <b>flat</b> <b>side</b> pieces improved the forward view while the new canopy resulted in exceptional all-round visibility. Wind tunnel tests of a wooden model confirmed that the aerodynamics were sound.|$|E
