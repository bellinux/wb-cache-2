5|$|Both Mulder and Scully stumble {{down the}} stairs in hope of <b>just</b> <b>getting</b> outside to die. They meet up by the door, both {{crawling}} on the floor, covered in massive amounts of blood. Scully claims he shot her, while Mulder claims she shot him. Mulder realizes that {{that could not have}} happened and stands up. The illusion is broken, and the two leave the house. Maurice and Lyda sit by the fire, holding hands, saying that they almost had the two agents. Meanwhile, at Mulder's apartment, Mulder and Scully exchange gifts, even though they told each other they would not.|$|E
5|$|Even {{before the}} Do 17s of KG 76 had touched down, {{the next wave}} was already <b>just</b> <b>getting</b> airborne. II and III./Kampfgeschwader 2 (KG 2), (from Boissy-Saint-Léger and Cambrai) II./Kampfgeschwader 3 (KG 3) (from Antwerp), I and II./Kampfgeschwader 53 (KG 53) (from Lille) and I and II./Kampfgeschwader 26 (from Wevelghem and Gilze en Rijen) took off to target the West India Docks and Royal Victoria Dock north of the Thames {{as well as the}} {{warehouses}} of the Surrey Commercial Docks in the south. JG 53 and Adolf Galland's Jagdgeschwader 26 (JG 26) were to escort the bombers. The fighters met them as the bombers formed up over Calais.|$|E
5|$|On the {{afternoon}} of 6 December, the German ships departed Picton Island, bound for the Falklands. On 7 December, they rounded Tierra del Fuego and turned north into the Atlantic. They arrived off the Falklands at around 02:00; three hours later, von Spee detached Gneisenau and Nürnberg to land a party ashore. By 08:30, the ships were approaching Port Stanley, when they noticed thick columns of smoke rising from the harbor. After closing to the harbor entrance, they quickly realized they were confronted by a much more powerful squadron, which was <b>just</b> <b>getting</b> up steam. Von Spee immediately broke off the operation and turned east to flee before the British ships could catch his squadron. By 10:45, Gneisenau and Nürnberg had rejoined the fleet, and the German auxiliaries were detached to seek shelter in the maze of islands off Cape Horn.|$|E

5|$|TSN {{offered to}} {{broadcast}} her funeral live {{and to make}} the signal available to any other stations at no charge. Her husband, Shannon England, agreed to the broadcast on the condition that the family would not be shown during the service. CBC also broadcast the service, marking the first time a Canadian athlete's funeral had been televised live on two networks. The Brier was <b>just</b> <b>getting</b> underway and games in the afternoon draw were delayed to allow curlers and fans to watch the funeral, which was broadcast on screens at the rink. Regina's Agridome and Schmirler's home Caledonian Curling Club also opened to show the funeral. Nine hundred people attended the service at the Regina Funeral Home, thousands watched at satellite locations around the province, and hundreds of thousands watched on television. The funeral was conducted by the Rev. Don Wells, and Sandra was eulogized by Brian McCusker, teammate Joan McCusker's husband.|$|E
5|$|Faced {{with this}} information, Master Chief and Cortana decide to destroy Halo to prevent its activation. While {{fighting}} the Flood, the Covenant, and Guilty Spark's Sentinels, Cortana discovers {{that the best}} way to accomplish this is to cause the crashed Pillar of Autumn to self-destruct. However, Captain Keyes' authorization is required to destroy the Autumn, forcing the Chief and Cortana to return to the now-Flood-infested Truth and Reconciliation to search for him. By the time they reach Keyes, however, he has been infected beyond the point of no return by the Flood. Master Chief retrieves Keyes' neural implants directly from his brain and retreats to the Autumn, where Cortana activates the ship's self-destruct sequence. However, 343 Guilty Spark reappears and deactivates the countdown, discovering the record of human history in the process. Master Chief manually destabilizes the Pillar of Autumns fusion reactors, and he and Cortana narrowly escape the destruction of the ring via a fighter. Cortana scans nearby space and finds that they are apparently the only survivors. Cortana justifies the sacrifices of the other humans on Halo, stating that they had no choice due to the threat posed by Halo, the Covenant and the Flood. Cortana believes it's over but the Master Chief tells her that they're <b>just</b> <b>getting</b> started.|$|E
5|$|The storm also {{affected}} the United Kingdom {{as it moved}} across the southern portion of the country. In Wales, Charley produced record-breaking daily rainfall, which surpassed 4inches (100mm) in Dyfed. Some locations received hundred-year rainfall. The storm struck the area during the Late Summer Bank Holiday, creating unfavorable conditions for driving and resulting in several accidents. Heavy rainfall flooded rivers, which swept away several people. This prompted officials to deploy boats and helicopters to assist in rescues, although at least three deaths were reported due to drowning in the rivers. Severe flooding was reported in Cumbria and Gloucestershire. The storm also left roads blocked by fallen trees and power lines. At {{the start of the}} storm, the inaugural Birmingham Super Prix motorsport race was <b>just</b> <b>getting</b> underway but poor visibility from precipitation contributed to an accident which temporarily called halt to proceedings. In Whitland, Wales, local soldiers assisted rescuing people, and later contributed to the cleanup of the town. Throughout the country, five people were missing after the storm, all of whom are presumed to have drowned; an additional death was confirmed in Newry, Northern Ireland.|$|E

25|$|When he met Capote in 1948, Dunphy {{had written}} a well-received novel, John Fury, and was <b>just</b> <b>getting</b> over a painful divorce from McCracken. In 1950 the two writers settled in Taormina, Sicily, in a house where the author D. H. Lawrence had once lived. Ten years older than Capote, Dunphy {{was in many ways}} Capote’s opposite, as solitary as Capote was exuberantly social. Though they drifted more and more apart in the later years, the couple stayed {{together}} until Capote's death.|$|E
25|$|Indianapolis {{businessman}} Carl G. Fisher first envisioned {{building the}} speedway in 1905 after assisting friends racing in France and seeing that Europe held {{the upper hand}} in automobile design and craftsmanship. Fisher began thinking of a better means of testing cars before delivering them to consumers. At the time, racing was <b>just</b> <b>getting</b> started on horse tracks and public roads. Fisher noticed how dangerous and ill-suited the makeshift courses were for racing and testing. He also argued that spectators did not get their money's worth, as they were only able to get a brief glimpse of cars speeding down a linear road.|$|E

25|$|Any prey {{that has}} the ability to jump or fly away will always be more {{effective}} in escaping than non-flying insects like the termites. However, many times those that do escape will still lose a leg or other appendage in the process, like 60% of the grasshoppers in this experiment. Because the prey is so much larger than the ants, even <b>just</b> <b>getting</b> this one appendage as a food source is a victory. For example, a hind leg of a grasshopper is still about 12.4 times the size of a single ant and a great resource in itself.|$|E
25|$|The {{limited number}} of copies {{available}} at first were targeted at a select fashionable readership. The late Autumn literary season was <b>just</b> <b>getting</b> under way as the first reviews appeared, and by early January the book {{was the subject of}} conversations at elite literary gatherings. At venues such as Buckingham Palace and Lady Byron's parties, cosmic evolution became a topic of discussion {{for the first time in}} many years. Reforming medical journals including The Lancet for 23 November 1844 carried favourable reviews, while criticising specific points. In January the Unitarian quarterly Prospective gave powerful support, but the influential prestige quarterlies which could determine the long term success of books were still looking for reviewers.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of 3 July, Captain Ross and Colonel Fremantle made an {{inspection}} {{of the town of}} Gettysburg itself, intending to get to the cupola of the seminary, which had been used by General John Buford as a vantage point two days earlier. The commencement of the Union bombardment stopped the two observers, and so they returned to Longstreet's headquarters early in the afternoon. Fremantle alone found the General sitting on a small fence. Thinking that the battle was <b>just</b> <b>getting</b> under way, Fremantle commented to Longstreet that he 'wouldn't have missed this for anything'. Longstreet wryly pointed out to his guest that the attack had already happened, and had been repulsed. Longstreet asked if Fremantle had anything to drink, at which the Englishman made a gift to the general of his silver hip flask.|$|E

25|$|When the ETP {{was being}} developed, the BuAer {{agreed that the}} Aviation RMS <b>just</b> <b>getting</b> {{underway}} in Annapolis, Maryland, would be moved to a more secure and larger facility. Ward Island, a small, uninhabited island {{a short distance from}} the newly opened Naval Air Station Corpus Christi, was selected. In a crash effort, the facilities were ready for the first class at the beginning of July 1942. Commander (later Captain) George K. Stoddard had been brought from retirement to oversee the Ward Island development, and then remained as the Commanding Officer. Lieutenant Commander Stock, who had started the school in Annapolis, served as the initial Superintendent of Training. In September, the school was designated the Naval Air Technical Training Center Ward Island (NATTC Ward Island), serving as the Aviation Secondary School in the ETP. Initially, Navy enlisted graduates received a Petty-officer rating of Aviation Radio Technician (ART); this was changed to Aviation Electronics Technician Mate (AETM) in 1945.|$|E
25|$|The Dodgers finally {{carried out}} their {{original}} plan for Demeter {{for the most}} part, set {{all the way back}} in September 1956. He became the new starter in center field, while Duke Snider was moved over to right field. Don had a very successful spring training and was expected to be the opening day starting centerfielder against the Chicago Cubs, but instead he rode the bench {{for the duration of the}} game. The next day, Duke Snider's lingering knee problems came back, and Demeter was given his first start of the season with the temperature around 40 degrees Fahrenheit. The new and improved Don Demeter made the best first impression he could, hitting a home run and a single while driving in two runs en route to a 5-3 win. Snider started the next game, the series opener against the St. Louis Cardinals. In his second start the next day, Don hit another homer. The next day, another home run. In just three starts, Don already had three home runs and six runs batted in. Demeter was only <b>just</b> <b>getting</b> started with his April tear.|$|E
