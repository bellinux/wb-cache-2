5|$|A deeper analogy relates tidal {{forces with}} a {{property}} of surfaces called curvature. For gravitational fields, the absence or presence of tidal forces <b>determines</b> <b>whether</b> {{or not the}} influence of gravity can be eliminated by choosing a freely falling reference frame. Similarly, the absence or presence of curvature <b>determines</b> <b>whether</b> or not a surface is equivalent to a plane. In the summer of 1912, inspired by these analogies, Einstein searched for a geometric formulation of gravity.|$|E

5|$|In the United Kingdom, the House of Lords {{has held}} {{that the nature of}} the {{decision-making}} process that the public authority is required to engage in <b>determines</b> <b>whether</b> a matter falls into the precedent fact category. If the process is complex and much discretion is accorded to the authority by the empowering statute, the court is unlikely to find that a precedent fact is involved. On the other hand, where an administrative decision interferes with an individual's liberty, the matter will be considered within the precedent fact category unless Parliament has explicitly excluded judicial review. If Parliament intends to do so, it must make its meaning crystal clear.|$|E
5|$|Although not {{all people}} with Tourette's have comorbid conditions, most Tourette's {{patients}} presenting for clinical care at specialty referral centers may exhibit symptoms of other conditions {{along with their}} motor and phonic tics.

Disruptive behaviors, impaired functioning, or cognitive impairment in patients with comorbid Tourette's and ADHD may {{be accounted for by}} the comorbid ADHD, highlighting the importance of identifying and treating comorbid conditions. Disruption from tics is commonly overshadowed by comorbid conditions that present greater interference to the child. Tic disorders in the absence of ADHD {{do not appear to be}} associated with disruptive behavior or functional impairment, while impairment in school, family, or peer relations is greater in patients who have more comorbid conditions and often <b>determines</b> <b>whether</b> therapy is needed.|$|E

5|$|During their {{terrestrial}} phase, crested and marbled newts {{depend on}} a landscape that offers cover, invertebrate prey and humidity. The precise requirements of most species are still poorly known, as the newts are {{much more difficult to}} detect and observe on land. Deciduous woodlands or groves are in general preferred, but conifer woods are also accepted, especially in the far northern and southern ranges. The southern marbled newt is typically found in Mediterranean oak forests. In the absence of forests, other cover-rich habitats, as for example hedgerows, scrub, swampy meadows, or quarries, can be inhabited. Within such habitats, the newts use hiding places such as logs, bark, planks, stone walls, or small mammal burrows; several individuals may occupy such refuges at the same time. Since the newts in general stay very close to their aquatic breeding sites, the quality of the surrounding terrestrial habitat largely <b>determines</b> <b>whether</b> an otherwise suitable water body will be colonised.|$|E

He watches play along the line of scrimmage to make sure that no more than 11 offensive players are on the field prior to the snap and that no offensive linemen are illegally downfield on pass plays. He monitors the contact between offensive and defensive linemen and calls most of the holding penalties. The umpire records the number of timeouts taken and the winner of the coin toss and the game score, assists the referee in situations involving possession of the ball close to the line of scrimmage, <b>determines</b> <b>whether</b> player equipment is legal, and dries wet balls prior to the snap if a game is played in rain.|$|E
