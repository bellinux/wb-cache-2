5|$|Structural {{effects can}} also be important. The {{difference}} between <b>fumaric</b> <b>acid</b> and maleic acid is a classic example. <b>Fumaric</b> <b>acid</b> is (E)-1,4-but-2-enedioic acid, a trans isomer, whereas maleic acid is the corresponding cis isomer, i.e. (Z)-1,4-but-2-enedioic acid (see cis-trans isomerism). <b>Fumaric</b> <b>acid</b> has pKa values of approximately 3.0 and 4.5. By contrast, maleic acid has pKa values of approximately 1.5 and 6.5. The reason for this large difference is that when one proton {{is removed from the}} cis isomer (maleic acid) a strong intramolecular hydrogen bond is formed with the nearby remaining carboxyl group. This favors the formation of the maleate H+, and it opposes the removal of the second proton from that species. In the trans isomer, the two carboxyl groups are always far apart, so hydrogen bonding is not observed.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{changes in}} {{antioxidant}} compounds of Brassica oleracea L. var. costata DC seeds were monitored {{during the first}} twelve days of seedling development. Sprouts were screened at time intervals of two days for phenolic com-pounds and organic acids. The identified phenolic compounds included esters of sinapic acid with glucose, gentiobiose and kaempferol, as well as sinapoylcholine. The organic acids were oxalic, aconitic, citric, pyruvic, malic, shikimic, and <b>fumaric</b> <b>acids.</b> During germination, a depletion of phenolic compounds was observed, although no qualitative changes were seen. Among individual compounds, kaempferol, choline and glucose esters of sinapic acid showed a marked de-crease between days two and six, whereas the changes in gentiobiose esters of sinapic acid were smaller. The total organic acids content increased rapidly during the first four days, with less significant variations thereafter. Malic acid, the major organic acid found in sprouts, greatly contributed to this result though oxalic, pyruvic, and <b>fumaric</b> <b>acids</b> also increased in the same manner.

25|$|The {{organic acids}} are mainly malic and tartaric acids. Tartaric acid is a {{characteristic}} of grapes; in its leaves its content ranges from 5 to 7 grams per litre. Malic acid is present in green grapes and its ratio decreases with maturation to give between 2 and 7 grams per litre at harvest. The range is very wide depending on the variety and soil with hot climates giving lower rates as the heat accelerates its degradation. There are many other acids in small quantities: citric acid, ascorbic acid, α-ketoglutaric, <b>fumaric</b> <b>acid,</b> galacturonic acid, coumaric acid, etc. Their variable quantity varies the pH of the wort. The must of white wine is generally more acidic than red grape must simply because the grape maturity is less advanced.|$|E

500|$|The {{nutritional}} {{components of}} R.virescens mushrooms have been characterized. Fresh mushrooms contain about 92.5% moisture. A [...] sample of dried mushroom (100gdw) has 365 kcal (1527 kilojoules). Carbohydrates {{make up the}} bulk of the fruit bodies, comprising 62% of the dry weight; 11.1% of the carbohydrates are sugars, the large majority of which (10.9%) is mannitol. The total lipid, or crude fat, content makes up 1.85% of the dry matter of the mushroom. The proportion of fatty acids (expressed as a percentage of total fatty acids) are 28.78% saturated, 41.51% monounsaturated, and 29.71% polyunsaturated. The most prevalent fatty acids include: palmitic acid, 17.3% of total fatty acids; stearic acid, 7.16%; oleic acid, 40.27%; and linoleic acid, 29.18%. Several bioactive compounds are present in the mushroom. One hundred grams (dry weight) contains 49.3 micrograms (µg) of tocopherols (20.0µg alpha, 21.3µg beta, and 8.0µg gamma) and 0.19 milligrams (mg) of the carotenoid pigment lycopene.

Furthermore, fruit bodies were determined to have 528mg of the antioxidant compound ergothioneine per kilogram of fresh mushroom; this value was the highest among many food items tested in one study.
