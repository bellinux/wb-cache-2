25|$|AI-10 {{was similar}} in {{performance}} to the AIS {{systems of the}} same vintage, but Bowen found no strong desire {{on the part of}} the RAF to buy the device. This has been attributed to a number of factors including overwork by the AMRE team fitting their own equipment, as well as not invented here syndrome. However, two technical issues appear to be the main reason. One was that the system did not display range directly, and had to be switched to a separate <b>display</b> <b>mode</b> that was described as basically useless. Moreover, the set was far too large to easily fit into a Beaufighter, having been designed for the much larger Havoc (P-70) or even larger Northrop P-61 Black Widow.|$|E

2500|$|Scientific {{notation}} (also {{referred to}} as scientific form or standard index form, or standard form in the UK) {{is a way of}} expressing numbers that are too big or too small to be conveniently written in decimal form. It is commonly used by scientists, mathematicians and engineers, in part because it can simplify certain arithmetic operations. On scientific calculators it is usually known as [...] "SCI" [...] <b>display</b> <b>mode.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Engineering {{notation}} (often named [...] "ENG" [...] <b>display</b> <b>mode</b> {{on scientific}} calculators) differs from normalized scientific notation {{in that the}} exponent n is restricted to multiples of 3. Consequently, the absolute value of m is in the range 1 ≤ |m| < 1000, rather than 1 ≤ |m| < 10. Though similar in concept, engineering notation is rarely called scientific notation. Engineering notation allows the numbers to explicitly match their corresponding SI prefixes, which facilitates reading and oral communication. For example, [...] {{can be read as}} [...] "twelve-point-five nanometers" [...] and written as , while its scientific notation equivalent [...] would likely be read out as [...] "one-point-two-five times ten-to-the-negative-eight meters".|$|E

2500|$|Like the IBM PC {{with the}} {{contemporary}} Color Graphics Adapter, the video {{output of the}} BBC Micro could be switched by software between a number of display modes. These varied between 20 and 40-column text suitable for a domestic TV, to 80-column text best viewed with a high-quality RGB-connected monitor (The 80-column mode was often too blurred to view when using a domestic TV via the UHF output). [...] The variety of modes offered applications a flexible compromise between colour depth, resolution and memory economy. In the first models, the OS and applications were left with the RAM {{left over from the}} <b>display</b> <b>mode.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Finally, by {{this time}} the UK {{electronics}} establishment had developed means to produce low-power pulses of extremely short duration, which were used to produce electronic scales on the same displays. As these scale lines were drawn using the same signals as the main radar pulses, they were always perfectly in synchronicity with the radar, offering accurate distance measurements without the need to calibrate an external mechanical scale. The system adopted for Mk. VIII drew circles every [...] to a maximum of [...] A new <b>display</b> <b>mode</b> was introduced for late stages of the interception, increasing the PRF and expanding the display to , with the scale generating circles at [...] intervals.|$|E
2500|$|Night Shift is a <b>display</b> <b>mode</b> {{introduced}} in iOS 9.3. The mode shifts {{the colors of}} the device's display to be warmer, similar to F.lux, a popular program for Microsoft Windows and Apple macOS computers. When enabled, it uses the device's clock and geographic location to determine when to turn the feature on or off. Optionally, the user can set a manual schedule, or not have a schedule at all. For ease of access, there is a new Night Shift toggle in the Control Center. The settings for Night Shift are located under [...] "Display and Brightness" [...] in the Settings app, and on top of enabling the feature and setting a schedule, the user can also set the warmth of the display.|$|E

5000|$|One {{reason for}} XScreenSaver's {{popularity}} is the modularity of its design, {{which makes it}} easy to add new <b>display</b> <b>modes.</b> The <b>display</b> <b>modes</b> (termed [...] "hacks" [...] from the historical usage [...] "display hack") are each stand-alone programs invoked by the xscreensaver daemon. In this way, a third-party screen saver can be written in any language or with any graphics library, so long as it is capable of rendering onto an externally provided window.|$|R
2500|$|For AIBA, the Lucero system {{sent out}} pulses on 183MHz, and the BABS responded with 8µs pulses on 190.5MHz. These {{were sent to}} yet another <b>display</b> <b>mode,</b> with a single {{vertical}} time base [...] long and the strobe providing markers every [...] along it. No switching {{was used in this}} mode, instead the signal always caused the beam to deflect to the right, causing a fairly wide bar to appear. Depending on which side of the runway the aircraft was on, the operator would either see long bars for 0.2second and short ones for 1, or vice versa. If, for instance, the dot signal was longer, this indicated the aircraft was too far to port as the signal was stronger on that side. Using these signals the aircraft could position itself along the centreline, at which point both the dot and dash signals were the same length, and the bar remained steady.|$|E
2500|$|The {{release of}} Pearltrees 2.0 was {{controversial}} with many users over {{the elimination of}} the [...] "mind mapping" [...] features that where a central theme to Pearltrees 1.0. [...] In Pearltrees 1.0 users could build and collaborate their links in freeform hierarchies displayed on screen as a forking [...] "tree" [...] of links and content elements. [...] While users can still organize their content in containers they are no longer displayed as a [...] "tree" [...] and the complex abstraction of relationships, simplified by the mind maps, is not supported except in a 'check back' <b>display</b> <b>mode.</b> [...] The iPad app does not support the [...] "check back" [...] to Pearl 1.0 hierarchies. [...] The company has made no clear statement if the mind-mapping interface will be supported going forward but has stated clearly that their business model is focused on collaboration of web contact and it was felt that the new interface made Pearltrees more accessible to a wider base of users who may have been previously turned off by the added complexity of mind mapping their content.|$|E

5000|$|Outside of 3D/gaming, V1000's (2D) {{performance}} was subpar {{in almost every}} way. On the extreme, in regular MCGA/VGA resolution or [...] "Mode X", the V1000's {{performance was}} embarrassingly slow; older MS-DOS games (such as Doom) ran at near slideshow speeds, even on a top-of-the-line host CPU (Pentium 166 MHz). Rendition introduced [...] "renutil", an MS-DOS utility, to address performance in MCGA graphics mode. The utility redirected MCGA (VGA-compatible) <b>display</b> <b>mode</b> setup to an equivalent VESA <b>display</b> <b>mode,</b> bypassing the Vérité's slow VGA core. The utility worked with all MCGA games, but was completely incompatible with games using [...] "Mode X" [...] VGA <b>display</b> <b>mode,</b> {{which could not be}} emulated using the VESA mode. Within Windows 95, the V1000 was passable, scoring neither top nor bottom in ZDnet's benchmark suite.

50|$|The {{state of}} the art is to fuse meteorological, oceanographic, and {{acoustic}} data in a variety of <b>display</b> <b>modes.</b> Temperature, salinity and sound speed can be displayed horizontally, vertically, or in three-dimensional perspective.|$|R
50|$|Notable {{improvements}} {{were the}} Super Agnus and the Hires Denise chips. The sound and floppy controller chip, Paula, remained unchanged from the OCS design. Super Agnus supports 2 MB of CHIP RAM, whereas the original Agnus/Fat Agnus and subsequent Fatter Agnus can address 512 KB and 1 MB, respectively. The ECS Denise chip offers Productivity (640&times;480 non-interlaced) and SuperHires (1280&times;200 or 1280&times;256) <b>display</b> <b>modes</b> (also available in interlaced mode), which are however limited to only 4 on-screen colors. Essentially, a 35 ns pixel mode was added plus {{the ability to}} run arbitrary horizontal and vertical scan rates. This made other <b>display</b> <b>modes</b> possible, but only the aforementioned modes were supported originally out of the box. For example, the Linux Amiga framebuffer device driver allows the use of several other <b>display</b> <b>modes.</b> Other improvements were {{the ability of the}} blitter to copy regions larger than 1024&times;1024 pixels in one operation and the ability to display sprites in border regions (outside of any display window where bitplanes are shown). ECS also allows software switching between NTSC and PAL video modes.|$|R
50|$|Unlike modern {{graphics}} editors, such as Adobe Photoshop, most Amiga graphics editors {{were heavily}} oriented towards the bitmapped and bitplaned <b>display</b> <b>modes</b> {{of the native}} Amiga chipset, and in Deluxe Paint this was most prominent.|$|R
