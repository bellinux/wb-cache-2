40|$|Several {{areas in}} Nebraska are not {{appropriate}} for onsite home sewage treatment using conventional septic tank absorption field systems. Site factors that limit the use of conventional absorption fields include slowly permeable soils, shallow or gravelly soils and high water tables. The septic tank-mound system, which consists of a septic tank for primary sewage treatment and a constructed mound for final waste treatment was developed to overcome these site limitations (Figure 1). Although mound systems differ only slightly in principle from conventional sewage systems, they allow the user to select suitable materials to build an absorption field that relies on evapotranspiration {{as well as the}} absorption capacity of existing soil. A pump located in a chamber is generally recommended to distribute the effluent evenly in the mound. Mound location, size and shape, construction procedures, distribution of effluent, and dosing quantity all interact in determining how well the mound will function. Each component must be properly designed and constructed to prevent premature failure of the system. Mound Location The septic tank-mound system can be constructed on soils having percolation rates from 0 to 120 minutes per inch (0 to 48 min/ em); the traditional septic tank-absorption field system is limited to soils with percolation rates from 5 to 60 minutes per inch (2 to 24 min/em). Ideally, the mound should be constructed on the flat area of a hill crest. Other flat areas that do not receive drainage water from surrounding land are also suitable. Gently sloping areas can be used if the soils have minimum percolation rates shown in Table 1. Do not locate the mound on a natural slope exceeding 12 percent under any soil condition, and do not move or grade the soil to change the ground slope. A mound system cannot be used in areas subject to frequent flooding because of possible downstream water contamination. Areas where a seasonal water table, rock formation or impervious stratum occurs within 24 inches (61 em) of the soil surface should also be avoided, since ground water close to the soil surface could be contaminated. Greater distances will further reduce the possibility of contamination. The mound absorption area should be at least 100 feet (30 m) down slope from any well or spring, 50 feet (15 m) from streams, 5 feet (1. 5 m) from property lines, and 10 feet (3 m) from the <b>drip</b> <b>area</b> of trees...|$|E

40|$|AbstractLiquid flow {{distribution}} {{in a square}} column was analyzed to evaluate the contact between liquid and gas phases in an absorption column, and to compare the results from a conventional cylindrical column. The square column was 12  inches wide by 12  inches deep by 40  inches tall. It was constructed with glass walls so that the flow pattern could be observed. The liquid distributor was designed with a pattern that would deliver the flow evenly in a set pattern over the packing with a <b>drip</b> per <b>area</b> ratio of 321 /ft 2  (2. 23 /inch 2). Experiments were conducted using both random and structured packing. A total packing volume of 3  ft 3 was used in each study. One-inch Pall Rings {{were used for the}} random packing study. For the structured packing tests, we designed and developed an innovative packing for the ITC pilot plant. Three packing bricks were used in the column. The testing of the structured packing was done using two different packed brick orientations; one with all of the bricks in the same flow direction, the other with the middle brick rotated 90 ∘ from the orientation of the top and bottom bricks. A monoethanolamine (MEA) solution concentration of 3. 0  molar was used in the experiments. The liquid distribution tests were done at one flow rates. Since the viscosity of the MEA solution was affected by the carbon dioxide (CO 2) solution loading, experiments were also conducted to evaluate the effects of CO 2 loading on the liquid hold-up.

40|$|During the summer, {{precipitation}} events occur {{rarely in}} the Mediterranean region. This results in cement kiln dust deposition on crops grown around cement factories or soil dust deposition on crops grown next to unpaved farm roads. The {{purpose of this}} study was to investigate the effects of particulate matter contamination from cement kiln and soil dust on peach leaf physiological characteristics and functions. Cement kiln dust and soil dust were applied periodically during the summer 2009 in 'Royal Glory' peach trees (fruit harvested early July) located away from contamination sources. Dust accumulation on treated peach leaves and various leaf physiological parameters were measured periodically over the summer period until late September. Specific leaf mass increased and chlorophyll content decreased after harvest and remained unchanged over the summer due to summer heat stress or, most probably, due to low 'sink' demand. Leaf gas exchange functions significantly decreased in June due probably to soil drying and transition of the functioning root system from the whole soil profile to the <b>drip</b> irrigated <b>areas</b> only. Contaminated leaves progressively accumulated soil and cement dust over the summer. This contamination resulted in increased specific leaf mass and decreased leaf chlorophyll content compared to leaves from control plants (uncontaminated). Peach leaves dusted with soil and cement had lower stomatal conductance and transpiration and photosynthetic rates than control leaves throughout the summer period. In May, at the beginning of particulate matter application, and in late September, when rains had removed substantial part of the deposited dust, leaf functions were similar in all treatments. The presence of cement or soil dust contamination did not cause any macroscopic toxicity to peach leaves. But the reduction in leaf productivity may have negative consequences on yield and, possibly, fruit quality, especially for the midseason and late ripening peach cultivars...|$|R

Subsurface drip systems were installed at two sites, one located in D'Hanis, Texas and the other in Stephenville, Texas. The land application systems are comprised of a filtration system and two subsurface <b>drip</b> application <b>areas.</b> One application area contains 4. 0 L/h (1. 08 gal/h) emitter rate drip tubing and the other area contains 2. 0 L/h (0. 53 gal/h) emitter rate tubing.

Emitter flow rates were measured during the study period and no emitter clogging was evident. The concentrations of nutrients in the applied water were lower than cover crop requirements, thus no increase in nutrient levels in the soil were observed. Also, the levels of zinc, iron, manganese and copper in the applied water were low and did not result in an increased concentration of these constituents in the soil profile. Calcium and sulfur concentrations in the soil profile increased with time, particularly at the D'Hanis site, where levels increased by 7 and 16 fold, respectively, between June, 1995 and May 1997.

Dawson reported that in a study of northern California redwood forests, 34% of annual hydrologic input was from fog <b>drip.</b> In <b>areas</b> were trees had been cut down, the average annual input from fog was only 17%, proving that the redwoods were required for the fog moisture input to the ecosystem. In an Occidental, California study beneath a single 200 ft Douglas fir on a ridge dividing the moister western slope of the California Coast Range from the drier eastern slope, moisture collected under the tree averaged 58 in versus 27 in in an adjacent open meadow. On Inverness Ridge in Point Reyes National Seashore fog drip from Douglas firs in summer may add 20 in to the otherwise 40 in of annual average rainfall. Further south, on Cahill Ridge on the San Francisco Peninsula (between Pilarcitos Creek and Crystal Springs Reservoir) at an altitude of 1000 ft, Oberlander measured fog drip beneath Tanoak (Lithocarpus densiflorus), Coast redwood and three Douglas fir trees, the latter 125 ft tall. He found that the trees most exposed produced the most moisture and in five weeks of measurement (July 20-August 28, 1951) fog drip below the tanoak produced 59 in of moisture, more than the total annual precipitation on nearby grasslands and chaparral. The Douglas fir produced 7 - 17 in of fog drip and appeared to provide unique conditions supporting the orchids Giant helleborine (Epipactis gigantea) and Phantom orchid (Cephalanthera austiniae), since these plants were found exclusively in these moist ridge tops.|$|R

Forty barrows with an initial weight of 97. 76 ± 13. 44 kg were distributed, in a randomized block design, into four treatments with five replicates. Treatments consisted of diets containing 0, 5, 10, and 15 % glycerin. Inclusions of salt and sodium bicarbonate were adjusted to balance the sodium content and maintain the same electrolyte balance of the diets as a function of glycerin inclusions.

Sweep net and drop cloth samples revealed lygus bug populations were established and reached pest status in drip-irrigated cotton 2 - 3 weeks prior to those in furrow. Several factors combined to make drip cotton more favorable than furrow for Lygus: more dense plant populations, taller plants, lower vapor pressure deficits within the plant canopy, and earlier availability of squares. Within furrow-irrigated cotton, lygus bugs and the percent Lygus-damaged squares were greater in areas of tall, dense plantings, primarily in areas distant from the water source. In drip, damage was significantly greater than in furrow, and comparable in all field ares. Predator populations were not consistently greater under either irrigation system. Under furrow, Geocoris and Nabis populations were greatest in areas of Lygus abundance. Morisita's index and Taylor's power law indicated {{a higher degree of}} aggregation in the spatial patterns of Lygus and predator populations in furrow-irrigated cotton than in drip. The two indices agreed in magnitude and trend across the insects studied, but Morisita's index was more frequently significant for contagion. Sweep net samples revealed a higher degree of aggregation than drop cloth. Taylor's coefficients were used to determine optimum sweep net and drop cloth sample sizes to evaluate Lygus populations for pest management. The sweep net requires a greater sample size than the drop cloth to ensure a given level of precision, and more samples are required in furrow-irrigated cotton than in drip.

In two years (2011 - 2012), the fog drip was observed by twelve passive fog collectors at transect of the Jizerka experimental catchment. Methods of space interpolation and extrapolation (ArcGis 10. 2) were applied to approximate the areal atmospheric deposition of fog water, sulphur and nitrogen, in catchments of the drinking water reservoirs Josefův Důl and Souš. The mean annual fog drip from vegetation canopy was found between 88 and 106 mm (i. e. 7 to 9 percent of precipitation, and 11 to 13 percent of water yield, estimated by standard rain gauge monitoring).

In laboratory experiments, limestone blocks were treated with dilute hydrochloric acid, and cavities resembling foibe were produced. Vertical walls developed only when a less soluble layer capped the limestone block or when the acid source was stationary, allowing acid to <b>drip</b> to the <b>area</b> directly below. Water analyses from foibe in central Kentucky and Missouri indicate that the water has had less residence time in the zone of aeration than other waters percolating through the rocks and entering the caves. In central Kentucky, foibe seem to be developed by migrating underground waterfalls held up by less soluble layers or by water moving directly down joints below less soluble layers.

In limestone caves of Kansas, foibe are formed in a similar manner as in Missouri. The foibe of the gypsum caves of Kansas are formed mainly on the sides of steep collapse sinkholes and lack joint control although they form beneath less soluble layers in the gypsum. Dripping water is necessary for the development of vertical walls by solution. Less soluble layers seem to be the unique feature which allows water to drip and pour into foibe.

All blinds were drawn down for the most part over all windows; what light came from the sky came like light seen through dusty glass; the grim brown hue of the brick houses looked more dirtily mournful than ever; the smoke from the chimney-pots was lost mysteriously in deepening superincumbent fog; the muddy gutters gurgled; the heavy rain-drops <b>dripped</b> into empty <b>areas</b> audibly.

40|$|Water and {{nitrogen}} {{are the first}} and second constraints to cotton production in the arid southwestern U. S, respectively (Morrow and Krieg, 1990). Subsurface <b>drip</b> irrigation (SDI) <b>area</b> in cottonland is currently estimated at 300, 000 ac, and is growing (Jim Bordovsky, personal communication). Efficiency of water application to cotton in SDI systems is about 90 % (Bordovsky and Lyle, 1998). However, N management research for cotton in SDI has not kept up with the water management research. Improving N fertilizer use efficiency would allow lower rates of N fertilizer to be used by producers without hurting lint yields. The reduced costs of improving efficiency of inputs such as fertilizer would help keep cotton farmers competitive in the world market place. Additionally, residual nitrate (NO 3) can be leached to groundwater and impact water quality. The environment of the West Texas Region is thereby protected when N fertilizer use efficiency is improved. Timing of N application is an important management tool that can result in improved N use efficiency in cotton. Norton and Silvertooth (1998) reported reduction in N fertilizer needed and increased N use efficiency if pre-plant N was avoided in irrigated cotton in Arizona. Based on that research, the Cooperative Extension of the University of Arizona states that the main window for N applications to cotton is centered at peak bloom or about 2200 heat units (base 60 °F). The rate of N uptake at peak bloom is apparently maximum in cotton (Silvertooth, 2001). Previous research conducted in this area has indicated that improving the timing of N fertilizer injections in SDI cotton systems based on canopy reflectance assessments of in-season N status can save up to 90 lb N/ac, without hurting yields (Bronson et al., 2003; Chua et al., 2003). We also observed in earlier work that modifying the timing of in-season N applications by applying N when chlorophyll meter readings were low, resulted in reduced N fertilizer applications and reduced residual soil NO 3 [...] N (Chua et al., 2003). However, more research is needed on basing the timing and rates of N fertilizer injections to SDI cotton on spectral reflectance. In the previous work (Chua et al., 2003), our SDI system was not set up for fertigation treatments, but our existing, present SDI system is. In addition to reflectance treatments and their associate reference treatments (i. e. 1. 5 * soil test treatment), we added a low, 0. 5 * soil test treatment N rate to provide more information {{on a wide range of}} N fertilizer inputs...|$|R
40|$|The Large White and Landrace are the {{predominant}} pig breeds {{used in the}} South African industry. Due to consumer demands, selection of leaner pigs receive attention in selection programs. IGF 2 is an imprinted gene, paternally expressed with a positive association {{with an increase in}} lean yield. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the effect of the IGF 2 gene in the two South African populations with regard to meat and fat quality traits. The first phase of the study was to determine the frequencies of the IGF 2 genotypes in South African pig populations. Frequencies varied from as high as 95 % of the G/G genotype in the Duroc to as low as 9 % of the A/A genotype in the Large White. IGF 2 genotypes were determined to generate sufficient progeny that were finished at a slaughter weight of 100 kg. Carcass, meat and fat quality traits were measured. For the majority of meat quality traits (pH?, water-holding capacity, colour, eye muscle <b>area,</b> <b>drip</b> loss, thiols and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances), the IGF 2 genotypes did not differ significantly (P 0. 05). The colour measurements from 1 to 7 days post mortem increased across all breed*genotype combinations for b* and Chroma measurements. Warner Bratzler shear force displayed differences (P< 0. 05) between the IGF 2 genotypes. The G/G genotype displayed more tender pork. Fat free dry matter of belly fat was the only significant measurement with a genotype effect where the A/A genotype had the highest percentage of 9. 18 % in comparison to the A/G genotype with a percentage of 8. 15 %. The G/G genotype had a higher mean value for fat content in muscle compared to backfat in this study, although not significant in the number of samples tested. Interesting to note that the A/A genotype tended to have more fat in the belly. The IGF 2 genotypes were significant for the SFA s (C 15 : 0, C 16 : 0, C 17 : 0 and C 20 : 0) in belly fat where the A/A was higher compared to A/G and G/G genotypes. The double bond index and iodine values were higher in A/A genotypes which is consistent with leaner animals. Results of this study is comparable with other studies showing that IGF 2 did not have any negative effect on meat and fat quality traits. This study has highlighted that there is potential for using IGF 2 gene as a genetic tool for selection of leaner pigs. Thesis (PhD) [...] University of Pretoria, 2016.

40|$|O Distrito de IrrigaÃÃo Jaguaribe â Apodi (DIJA), no estado do CearÃ, foi criado com o objetivo de produzir alimentos e matÃrias primas, gerar empregos em atividades rurais e urbano-rurais, aumentar e melhorar a distribuiÃÃo de renda e criar condiÃÃes para a conquista da cidadania. Este PerÃmetro foi implantado em 1987, mas os serviÃos essenciais de administraÃÃo, operaÃÃo e manutenÃÃo sÃ iniciaram a partir de 1989. O DIJA possui uma Ãrea irrigÃvel de 5. 393 ha. Os sistemas de irrigaÃÃo adotados sÃo os mÃtodos por microaspersÃo, gotejamento e pivÃ central e sÃo plantados cerca de dezesseis tipos de cultura. O objetivo geral deste trabalho foi avaliar a sustentabilidade hidro-ambiental do DIJA. Utilizaram-se instrumentos que pudessem caracterizar a Ãrea em estudo, como anÃlises fÃsico â quÃmicas e bacteriolÃgicas da qualidade das Ãguas brutas e tratadas, a determinaÃÃo do Indice de Qualidade da Ãgua - IQA, anÃlise das imagens de satÃlite para verificaÃÃo de mudanÃa {{temporal}} do uso e ocupaÃÃo do solo, determinaÃÃo das eficiÃncias de aplicaÃÃo de Ãgua na irrigaÃÃo, cÃlculos dos coeficientes de uniformidade CUC e CUD para vazÃo e umidade do solo, anÃlise da matriz de impactos antes e depois da implantaÃÃo do PerÃmetro e a anÃlise de risco. A Ãgua superficial do DIJA nÃo atendeu a Classe 2 para a maioria das campanhas em todos os pontos estudados, devido apresentar restriÃÃes em relaÃÃo aos parÃmetros bacteriolÃgicos e fÃsico â quÃmicos. NÃo foi encontrado indÃcio de contaminaÃÃo das Ãguas superficiais por agrotÃxicos. O grupo Ãgua Bruta apresentou valor mÃdio para o IQA de 83, 79, considerado bom. Para os pontos analisados de Ãgua tratada, porÃm, houve restriÃÃes em relaÃÃo Ã qualidade bacteriolÃgica nos trÃs pontos estudados, os quais devem ser monitorados pela concessionÃria para corrigir os possÃveis problemas a fim de atender a padrÃes de potabilidade. A anÃlise das imagens de satÃlites, para a anÃlise de uso e ocupaÃÃo do solo do DIJA, mostrou de 1996 a 2004 houve um aumento de 63, 7 % de vegetaÃÃo no DIJA, resultado no aumento de Ãrea irrigada. Comparando-se a imagem mais antiga de 1996 com a de 2004, observou-se que tanto de forma visual quanto quantitativamente houve um aumento da irrigaÃÃo no perÃmetro irrigado durante esses anos, mostrando assim a expansÃo da fruticultura irrigada no perÃmetro. Os resultados da eficiÃncia de aplicaÃÃo de Ãgua na irrigaÃÃo por microaspersÃo mostraram que 73 % das Ãreas analisadas foram irrigadas em dÃficit; para o gotejamento as Ãreas analisadas foram irrigadas em excesso e para pivÃ central 50 % em dÃficit e 50 % em excesso. Desta forma confirma-se a falta de manejo adequado na maioria das Ãreas estudadas. Quanto a uniformidade, o risco de CUCq e CUDq ficar abaixo dos padrÃes foi pequeno; A anÃlise da matriz de impactos para os dias de hoje mostrou que a tendÃncia dos impactos previstos foi de reduzir ou manter os atributos concedidos na Ãpoca da implantaÃÃo e notou-se pouca influÃncia das medidas de controle ambiental, quando inseridas no contexto global. Do ponto de vista ambiental, observou-se que no meio BiofÃsico, principalmente os meios aquÃticos e terrestres, foram os mais afetados no inÃcio da implantaÃÃo do PerÃmetro e continuarÃo sendo, caso nÃo sejam adotadas medidas de controle. The Jaguaribe-Apodi Irrigation District (DIJA), in {{the state}} of the CearÃ, was founded aimed at producing food and substances cousins, to create jobs in agricultural businesses and urban-rural activities, to increase and to improve the income distribution and to create conditions for the conquest of the citizenship. This Perimeter was implanted in 1987, but the essential services of administration, operation and maintenance were initiated only from 1989. The irrigated area of DIJA is 5. 393 ha. The irrigation systems are the methods for microsprinkler, drip and central pivot and are planted about sixteen types of cultures. The general objective of this work was to evaluate the hydro - ambiental sustainability of the DIJA. Instruments were applied to characterize the area under study, such as, as physical - chemical and bacteriological analyses of the surface and drinking waters, determination of the WQI, analysis of satellite images for land use detection and change, determination of Christiansen and Distribution Uniformity Coefficients (CUC and CUD) from emitters and soil â water moisture, analysis of the matrix of impacts before and after the implantation of the irrigation district and risk analysis on those factors. The surface water of the DIJA could not complain to class two for the majority of the samples taken over time in the study area. Restrictions were found relation to bacteriological and physical â chemical parameters. Indication of contamination of surface waters from pesticides was not found. In general, untreated surface water registred an WQI value of 83, 79, considered good. For the analyzed drinking water sites (treated water), there were restrictions in relation to the bacteriological quality in the three studied sampling sites. These points need to be monitored by the state water facility, to correct the possible problems in order to complain with water quality standards. Comparing the images of 1996 to the one of 2004, it was observed, both visually and quantitatively that there was an increase of the irrigation in the irrigated perimeter irrigated during these years, thus showing the expansion of the irrigated fruit production farms in DIJA. The results of the efficiency of water application in microsprinkler areas have shown that 73 % of the analyzed areas were irrigated in deficit; for the <b>drip</b> irrigated <b>areas,</b> the analysis, showed an over irrigation and for central pivot areas, it was observed 50 % in deficit and 50 % in excess of irrigation. Thus one can conclude on the lack of irrigation scheduling practives on the majority of the studied areas. In terms of the irrigation uniformity it was found that the risk of CUCq and CUDq to be below of the standards was small; The analysis of the matrix of impacts for the present time showed that the trend was the impact to reduce or to remain unchanged and noticed little influence of these when inserted environment measures in the global context. Of the environment point of view, it was observed that in the bio-physic environment, specialty the aquatic and terrestrial environment, were mainly affected in the beginning of the implantation of the Perimeter and go on if measured of control not be applied...|$|R
40|$|Avaliou-se o progresso de doenças fúngicas do mamoeiro e os efeitos dos fatores climáticos em três áreas experimentais: 1 - área de produção de mamão conduzida no sistema convencional, que recebeu irrigação por gotejamento; 2 - área de produção de mamão conduzida no sistema convencional, que recebeu irrigação por aspersão; 3 - área de produção de mamão cultivada no sistema orgânico, com irrigação por microaspersão. Na área 1 foram avaliados três sistemas diferentes de condução: 1) sem a aplicação de fungicidas e sem sanitização das plantas (testemunha sem sanitização); 2) sem a aplicação de fungicidas e com sanitização das plantas (testemunha com sanitização); e 3) com a aplicação de fungicidas para o controle de doenças foliares e sem sanitização (padrão do produtor). Em cada sistema de condução foram demarcadas quatro parcelas (repetições) com 20 plantas, sendo 10 plantas consideradas úteis. Foram avaliadas a incidência e a severidade da mancha-de-ascoquita, pinta-preta e do oídio como doenças foliares. Nos frutos, após a colheita foram avaliadas as incidências da antracnose, mancha-chocolate e podridão-peduncular. As epidemias da mancha-de-ascoquita ocorrem em temperaturas variando de 15 ºC a 20 ºC; para a pinta-preta as condições favoráveis ao desenvolvimento de epidemias foi temperatura variando de 25 ºC a 30 ºC e umidade relativa variando de 80 % a 100 %, sendo o pico da intensidade da doença ocorre entre os meses de novembro a março. Para o oídio, a faixa de temperatura que favoreceu a doença foi 15 ºC a 20 ºC e umidade relativa de 60 a 70 %. Em relação às podridões que incidiram nos frutos, observou-se que não houve relação entre a incidência da podridão-peduncular e a precipitação pluvial acumulada, 15 dias antes da avaliação ou no período de desenvolvimento do fruto (r The {{effect of}} climatic {{conditions}} on progress of fungal diseases of papaya were evaluated in three experimental areas in Linhares, State of Espirito Santo, Brazil. First area {{was carried out}} using traditional system and was <b>drip</b> irrigated; second <b>area</b> was also carried out using traditional system, but it was overhead irrigated, and third area was carried out using organic system with micro spray. It was evaluated three different systems of cultural control in the first area: 1 - papaya plants not sprayed with fungicides with any leaf removal (check treatment without sanitation); 2 - papaya plants not sprayed with fungicides with leaf removal (check treatment with leaf removal), and 3 - papaya plants sprayed with fungicides without leaf removal (grower treatment). Each system received four plots with 20 plants. Evaluation was done in 10 plants {{in the center of}} plots. Incidence and severity of Ascochyta leaf spot, black spot and powdery mildew were evaluated on leaves. It was evaluated the incidence and stem end rot of fruits. Epidemics of Ascochyta leaf spot are favoured by temperatures ranging from 15 ºC to 20 ºC. Epidemic of black spot occurred when temperature ranged from 25 ºC to 30 ºC with relative humidity ranging from 80 to 100 %, from november to march. Powdery mildew development was favored by temperatures from 15 ºC to 20 ºC and relative humidity from 60 % to 70 %. It was not observed any relation between incidence of stem end rot of papaya and acumulated rain 15 days before the evaluation (r less than 0. 21). Incidence of fruit rot diseases caused by anthracnose and chocolate spot did not correlate with weather conditions. Ascochyta leaf spot was detected in all the evaluation data with maximum severity from the juliana date 155 to 250 and minimum from 20 to 80; the black spot increased from date juliana 326 to 70 with maximum disease severity on the date 336; powdery mildew increased in two distinct times: one from the date 330 to 80 and another form the date 240 to 320 with maximum severity on the date from 240 to 250. Fruit rot was detected in stored papaya when they were harvested on the dates from 140 to 320. The pattern treatment employed by the growers differed significantly from the treatments involving cultural practices such as sanitization and no sanitization, with the exception for stem end rot, where the grower pattern treatment did not differ from the treatment with sanitization. The cultural treatments with sanitization did not differ from the treatment without sanitization. However for stem end rot, treatment with sanitization increased 24 % and 9 % the number of commercial fruits for the juliana dates 170 and 210, respectively over the treatment without sanitization; for anthracnose, 13 % and 55 %, for the juliana dates 160 and 230, respectively and for the chocolate fruit spot 30 % and 9 %, for the juliana dates 170 e 210, respectively. Total diseased progess curves in the areas called curral and Bitchisner were almost identical; the maximum severity of Ascochyta leaf spot was 20 % in the curral and 10 % in Bitchisner, from the dates 110 e 320. Black spot was more severe in the curral than in Bitchisner. Powdery mildew was detected on the plants from curral and Bitchisner from dates 230 aos 320 with higher severity on the plants of curral where the plants are irrigated with central pivot. Maximum disease severity of 45 and 65 % were detected on papaya areas from curral and Bitchisner, respectively. The incidence of papaya black spot was higher on the curral area than on the plants form Bitchisner due to the method of irrigation...|$|R
