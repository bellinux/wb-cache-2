5|$|In a 2006 Icelandic Radio interview, Fischer {{explained}} {{his reasons for}} advocating Fischerandom Chess:In chess so much depends on opening theory, so the champions before the last century did not <b>know</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> I do and other players do about opening theory. So if you just brought them {{back from the dead}} they wouldn't do well. They'd get bad openings. You cannot compare the playing strength, you can only talk about natural ability. Memorisation is enormously powerful. Some kid of fourteen today, or even younger, could get an opening advantage against Capablanca, and especially against the players of the previous century, like Morphy and Steinitz. Maybe they would still be able to outplay the young kid of today. Or maybe not, because nowadays when you get the opening advantage not only do you get the opening advantage, you know how to play, they have so many examples of what to do from this position... and that is why I don't like chess any more... It is all just memorization and prearrangement...|$|E

25|$|The {{stand by}} diver will be {{prepared}} {{in the same}} way as the working diver, but will not enter the water until needed. He will usually be prepared to the stage of readiness to enter the water, and then will remove his mask, or have his helmet removed and will then sit in as comfortable a place as can be found, so that in case of an emergency he can be readied for action in as short a time as possible. This often means setting up some form of shelter from the weather, and heat and sunshine are usually more of a problem than cold and wet. It is frequently necessary to cool the standby diver to avoid overheating, and dehydration can also be a problem. When the working diver is using a helmet, the standby diver may use a full face mask or bandmask, as this makes it quicker to get into the water in an emergency. The stand by diver's job is to wait until something goes wrong, and then be sent in to sort it out. For this reason a stand by diver should be one of the best divers on the team regarding diving skills and strength, but does not have to be expert at the work skills for the specific job. When deployed, the standby diver will normally follow the umbilical of the diver who is in trouble, as unless it has been severed, it will reliably lead to the correct diver. The standby diver must maintain communications with the supervisor throughout the dive and is expected to give a running commentary of progress so that the supervisor and surface crew <b>know</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> possible what is happening and can plan accordingly, and must take the necessary steps to resolve incidents, which may involve supply of emergency air or locating and rescuing an injured or unconscious diver. In bell diving, the bellman is the standby diver, and may have to recover a distressed diver to the bell and give first aid if necessary and possible.|$|E

The New York Times Magazine wrote, [...] "Aubrey's heavy involvement with every creative detail of MGM's pictures far surpassed his immersal in CBS's scripts." [...] After he made edits {{to the film}} Going Home starring Robert Mitchum, its director, Herbert B. Leonard, protested publicly. [...] "He unilaterally and arbitrarily raped the picture," [...] he told Time in 1971. Director Blake Edwards was incensed by changes Aubrey made to his film The Wild Rovers with William Holden, telling The New York Times Magazine, [...] "Cuts? He doesn't <b>know</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> a first-year cinema student. He cut the heart right out of it." [...] Television producer Bruce Geller, who created , had his name removed from the credits of his first film, Corky, because [...] "It's not my picture any more."

2500|$|Mission-specific {{training}} {{has been part}} of a Canadian soldier's preparation for service on peacekeeping and stability operations since the 1960s. This plays a huge part in the war in Afghanistan. In preparations, [...] "soldiers needed to <b>know</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> possible about local customs, culture, and politics, and about the nature and motivation of groups that might oppose the establishment of peace and order." [...] This, accompanied with psychological triaging with a soldier's family, made this deployment of Canadian forces the most ever prepared overseas. In training for the mission the goal in Afghanistan was clear: “The Afghan mission would only succeed when the Government of Afghanistan could provide for the needs of its people.” It was this notion that shaped the Canadian and NATO approach toward reconstructing the Afghan society.|$|E
2500|$|Plato’s Problem was {{expressed}} generally by Bertrand Russell: [...] "How comes it that human beings, whose {{contacts with the}} world are brief and personal and limited, are nevertheless able to <b>know</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> they do know?" [...] The problem arises {{in the domain of}} language acquisition in that children attain infinitely more than they experience. Literally so, we shall see: they attain a productive system, a grammar, on the basis of very little experience. So there is more, much more, to language acquisition than mimicking what we hear in childhood, and there is more to it than the simple transmission of a set of words and sentences from one generation of speakers to the next. There is more to it than a reproduction of experience and, in maturity, our capacity goes well beyond what we have experienced.|$|E
2500|$|The Army of the Eastern Pyrenees was in {{the grip}} of its representatives on mission, [...] "to an extent unknown elsewhere", {{according}} to historian Ramsay Weston Phipps. This may have been {{because of the lack of}} officers from the regular army establishment and because the representatives were local men who wanted to promote their personal friends. Their arrogance was almost beyond belief. Raymond Gaston boasted, [...] "I know neither Generals nor special powers. As to the Minister, he is like a dog on a race course. I alone should command here, and I shall be obeyed." [...] His colleague Claude Dominique Côme Fabre described the army commanders-in-chief as [...] "useless" [...] and wished the office to be abolished. Joseph Guiter asserted, [...] "What good are Generals? The women of our faubourgs <b>know</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> they do." [...] Fabre demanded and got 100 Jacobins to be sent from Paris to be distributed within the army as [...] "Civic Apostles" [...] where they stirred up trouble among the enlisted men.|$|E
