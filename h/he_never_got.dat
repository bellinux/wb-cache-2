Coyden Harold Uggams, a visiting Presbyterian minister, persuaded the couple to {{relocate}} to Palatka, Florida, to run a mission school. The Bethunes moved in 1899; Mary ran the mission school and began an outreach to prisoners. Albertus left the family in 1907; <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>got</b> a divorce but relocated to South Carolina. He died in 1918 from tuberculosis.|$|E

It peaked at No. 3 in the UK and No. 11 in the U.S., going gold in both countries {{as well as in}} Canada.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{graduated}} in 1925 and enrolled at Ohio State University the following year, {{hoping to make}} the Buckeyes team. <b>He</b> <b>never</b> <b>got</b> past the tryout phase. After his freshman year, he transferred to Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, where he followed Weeb Ewbank as the school's starting quarterback. Under Coach Chester Pittser, Brown {{was named to the}} All-Ohio small-college second team by the Associated Press at the end of 1928. In two seasons at Miami, Brown guided the team to a 14–3 record. He married his high school sweetheart Katie Kester the following year. Brown had taken pre-law at Miami and considered studying history on a Rhodes Scholarship, but after college he instead took his first job as a coach. On Stewart's recommendation, Severn School, a private prep school in Maryland, hired him in 1930.|$|E

25|$|After World War 2, superheroes {{declined}} in popularity. Green Lantern was cancelled in 1949 after 38 issues and All-American Comics dropped superheroes {{in favor of}} westerns. Alan Scott's final Golden Age appearance was in All-Star Comics #57 (1951).

He still managed to impress Brisbane Heat coach to earn a spot in the team for two seasons. <b>He</b> <b>never</b> <b>got</b> to bowl or bat in his first season, but he took five catches and played his part in Brisbane Heat's winning campaign in 2012-13 Big Bash League.|$|E
25|$|The MCG {{was also}} used for another {{demonstration}} sport, Australian Rules. The Olympics being an amateur competition meant that only amateurs could play in the demonstration game. A combined team of amateurs from the VFL and VFA were selected to play a state team from the Victorian Amateur Football Association (VAFA). The game was played 7 December 1956 with the VAFA side, wearing white jumpers, green collars and the Olympic rings on their chests, winning easily 81 to 55. One of the players chosen for the VFA side was Lindsay Gaze (although <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>got</b> off the bench) who {{would go on to}} make his mark in another sport, basketball, rather than Australian Rules.|$|E

25|$|After {{initially}} playing {{five games}} in the reserves Seed got his first team chance with Spurs, making his debut at inside right and forming an immediate understanding with the legendary, diminutive right winger Fanny Walden. Seed played five {{games in the}} remainder of the 1919–20 season, scoring two goals as Spurs ran away with the Division Two title. Seed was a virtual ever present for Spurs in the following seven seasons in Division One. The 1920–21 season saw Tottenham lift the FA Cup with Seed playing in all six matches in the cup run, scoring five goals including a hat trick against Bradford City in the second round. Just two months after getting his cup winners medal Seed was called up for the first of this five England caps on 21 May 1921 against Belgium, <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>got</b> a long run in the international side, playing his final game in April 1925.|$|E
25|$|And yet, for all that, Halbertsma's {{literary}} works {{did not take}} centerstage in his life: that place was reserved for his scientific non-fiction books. More than fifty years he laboured to complete his dictionary of Western Frisian titled Lexicon Frisicum, for which he chose Latin as the descriptive language, but it remained unfinished. He organised it {{along the lines of}} the German dictionary by the Brothers Grimm, but became enmeshed in the addition of insertions and in reworkings, and in writing long semantic etymologies, a part of the work for which he especially had a predilection. In the end, <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>got</b> past the letter F, and the dictionary remained a manuscript, which was published in its unfinished form after Halbertsma's death, in 1872. In the 20th century, the material Halbertsma gathered for his Lexicon Frisicum was used by de Frisian Academy to develop several Western Frisian dictionaries, notably the 25 part Wurdboek fan de Fryske Taal ("Dictionary of the Western Frisian Language"; published 1984–2011).|$|E
25|$|At Atlanta, Earnhardt Jr. {{came home}} with another third-place finish and at Las Vegas, he {{finished}} fourth, scoring his third Top 5 finish after taking two tires during green flag pit-stops with 30 laps to go. At Phoenix, he had his worst finish of the year, with a last place finish after a tire-blowout. At Auto Club, he finished 6th. At Martinsville, he also ran inside the Top 20 until a tire-blowout made him {{get involved in a}} massive pileup that destroyed the front end of his car. Because of this crash, he would go on to finish 36th. At Texas, he narrowly was beaten by Kevin Harvick for second place. At Bristol, he ran as high as third until a loose wheel put him down two laps down. Although <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>got</b> them back, he was able to bring home a 16th-place finish only two laps down. At Richmond, he ran in the Top 10 all day until he and Tony Stewart made contact but managed to finish 14th.|$|E

25|$|In {{the first}} {{race of the}} Chase for the Sprint Cup at Chicagoland, Harvick would start {{at the rear of}} the field due to unapproved body modifications, but quickly moved back up to the front within 30 laps. He would be put a lap down due to an {{untimely}} caution while Harvick was on pit road, because he did not beat the leader, Martin Truex Jr., to the start-finish line. <b>He</b> <b>never</b> <b>got</b> back on the lead lap for the remainder of the race, and ultimately finished 20th. Harvick's third win of the season would come at the very next week at Loudon, where he passed Matt Kenseth on a late-race restart with 7 laps to go. Next week at Dover, Harvick would have a broken trackbar and would have to go to the garage but he was already locked into the next round due to his win at New Hampshire. The next week at Charlotte, Harvick would win the pole and would lead 155 laps before having electrical problems on lap 154 at the same time Joey Logano had a tire problem and hit the wall. Coming into Kansas, Harvick sat 12th in the Chase standings, and would be in a must win situation to make the round of 8, but that was no problem for Harvick as he would dominate the race along with Matt Kenseth, until Kenseth would fade after tapping the wall. Harvick would lead 267 laps to victory, late in the race, Carl Edwards, would get the lead and lead several laps, but after a few cautions and restarts, Harvick would get back the lead and while Edwards and Kyle Busch would battle hard for 2nd place, Harvick would pull away to get his 4th win of the season, and advance into the Round of 8 in the Chase but he would officially get eliminated in the Round of 8. He would wrap up his 2016 season by winning the pole and finishing 3rd at Homestead-Miami.|$|E

Shelved in bookstores during the three weeks prior to 9/11, the book has a paragraph describing reactions to the performance art he staged in the 1940s at the Museum of Modern Art.

500|$|Working with {{a budget}} of $200,000, Dassin could not afford top stars for the film. To carry the lead role, Dassin {{selected}} Jean Servais, an actor whose career had slumped due to alcoholism. For Italian gangster Mario Ferrati, Dassin cast Robert Manuel after seeing him perform a comic role {{as a member of}} Comédie-Française. After a suggestion made by the wife of the film's producer, Dassin cast Carl Möhner as Jo the Swede. Dassin would use Möhner again in his next film He Who Must Die. Dassin himself played the role of the Italian safecracker César the Milanese. Dassin explained {{in an interview that he}} [...] "had cast a very good actor in Italy, whose name escapes me, but <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>got</b> the contract!...So I had to put on the mustache and do the part myself".|$|E
500|$|Cooper was {{naturally}} reserved and introspective, {{and loved}} {{the solitude of}} outdoor activities. Not unlike his screen persona, his communication style frequently consisted of long silences with an occasional [...] "yup" [...] and [...] "shucks". He once said, [...] "If others have more interesting things to say than I have, I keep quiet." [...] According to his friends, Cooper could also be an articulate, well-informed conversationalist on topics ranging from horses, guns, and Western history to film production, sports cars, and modern art. He was modest and unpretentious, frequently downplaying his acting abilities and career accomplishments. His friends and colleagues described him as charming, well-mannered, and thoughtful, with a lively boyish sense of humor. Cooper maintained a sense of propriety throughout his career and never misused his movie star status—never sought special treatment or refused {{to work with a}} director or leading lady. His close friend Joel McCrea recalled, [...] "Coop never fought, <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>got</b> mad, he never told anybody off that I know of; everybody that worked with him liked him." ...|$|E
500|$|Even {{though the}} grunge {{movement}} died down in 1994 {{after the death}} of Kurt Cobain, designers have continued to draw inspiration from the movement from time to time. Grunge appeared as a trend again in 2008 and for Fall/Winter 2013, Hedi Slimane at Yves Saint Laurent brought back grunge to the runway. With Courtney Love as his muse for the collection, she reportedly loved the collection. [...] "No offense to MJ [...] but <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>got</b> it right," [...] Courtney said. [...] "This is what it really was. Hedi knows his shit. He got it accurate, and MJ and Anna [...] did not.” [...] Both Cobain and Love apparently burnt the Perry Ellis collection they received from Marc Jacobs back in 1993. In 2016, grunge inspired an upscale [...] "reinvention" [...] of the style by A$AP Rocky, Rihanna and Kanye West. However, “dressing grunge is no longer a badge of authenticity, though: the signifiers of rebellion (Dr Martens boots, plaid shirts) are omnipotent on the high street”, says Lynette Nylander, deputy editor of i-D magazine.|$|E

500|$|Bauer created most of {{his major}} works in oil at the {{beginning}} of his career, since this was the traditional technique taught at the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts. The trip to northern Sweden resulted in many sketches and watercolors for the Lappland book, but also in an oil on canvas entitled, Kåsovagge (1904). From 1903 to 1905, he made several portraits and landscapes influenced by Expressionism. He also made his first oil of Ester, The Fairy Princess, a painting with elements from the Pre-Raphaelites. This work indicates what kind of paintings Bauer wanted to do, but his commissions from illustrating [...] "Among gomes and trolls" [...] got in the way. He wrote that he [...] "felt like a Jack-of-all-trades", and made regular outbursts in letters to editors and publishers asking for his help, saying that he [...] "had to work, he wanted a future painting in oil and the rest be damned". By the time he ceased painting his trolls and gnomes, he was tired and worn out and turned to other venues such as scenography, writing a compendium on drawing to be used in schools, and starting with frescos. <b>He</b> <b>never</b> <b>got</b> to revisit oil painting fully before he drowned.|$|E
