5|$|The Soviets {{bought an}} example of, and plans for, the {{machinery}} of the later Duca d'Aosta-class cruisers and had some difficulty in adapting the smaller hull for the larger and more-powerful machinery, {{so much so that}} it delayed the start of construction. Another problem was that the Italian design had to be adapted to use the Soviet preference for a mix of longitudinal <b>framing</b> for the hull <b>framing</b> amidships and transverse <b>framing</b> for the ends, while also reinforcing the hull structure to withstand the more-severe weather conditions that the Soviets commonly encountered.|$|E

30|$|A {{video is}} {{composed}} {{of a series of}} <b>frames,</b> which when played back at a certain <b>frame</b> rate provide a visually fluid motion. <b>Frames</b> in a video typically have common data between one or more <b>frames.</b> To eliminate the need to store this content for individual <b>frames,</b> special <b>frames</b> called prediction <b>frames</b> are used [25]. These prediction <b>frames</b> (P-frames) reference other <b>frames</b> or MB within a <b>frame</b> which can be found before or after the predicted <b>frame.</b> <b>Frames</b> that do not reference other <b>frames</b> are referred to as intra-coded <b>frames</b> (I-frames). <b>Frame</b> references are calculated during a phase of the encoding process called motion estimation. The result of the motion estimation step is a model called the motion vector that describes the offset of coordinates shared between prediction and reference <b>frames</b> [26].|$|R
30|$|Conventional intra-frame decoder and <b>frame</b> interpolation/extrapolation Key <b>frame</b> {{decoding}} {{is relatively}} straight forward, since it only exploits the spatial correlation in the given <b>frame.</b> However, the reconstructed key <b>frame</b> also provides an estimate for the WZ <b>frame</b> to be decoded. <b>Frame</b> interpolation/extrapolation is performed on each decoded current key <b>frame</b> along with previously reconstructed <b>frames</b> {{to produce the}} side information W^∼ required for reconstructing the WZ <b>frames.</b>|$|R

30|$|The data <b>frame</b> is {{initially}} processed by FIFO buffer which buffers some bytes {{if there are}} any downstream processing delays. Then, the <b>frame</b> flows into <b>frame</b> store. Next, the <b>frame</b> is stored in SRAM via SRAM interface. The associated <b>frames</b> with the appropriate <b>frame</b> context information are retrieved via Register I/O so that the data <b>frame</b> in the SRAM can be monitored. When the last word of the data <b>frame</b> is written into the SRAM, the <b>frame</b> store will send a control signal to make <b>frame</b> remove informed, which tells the <b>frame</b> remove to begin reading the data <b>frames</b> in the SRAM.|$|R

5|$|Bach {{structured}} the cantata, {{the seventh}} {{work in his}} chorale cantata cycle, in seven movements: two <b>framing</b> choral movements, a recitative and an unusual sequence of four bipartite arias. He scored the work for three vocal soloists, a four-part choir, and a Baroque chamber ensemble of a horn to reinforce the hymn tune in the outer movements, two transverse flutes, two oboes d'amore, strings and continuo. It is the only known work from his chorale cantata cycle that kept the original words unchanged.|$|E

Tamazight verbs have at their core a stem, {{modified}} by prefixes, suffixes, moveable affixes, circumfixes, and ablaut. The prefixes indicate voice, tense, aspect, and polarity, while the suffixes indicate mood (normal, horatory, or imperative). Subject markers are circumfixed to the verb, while object marking and satellite <b>framing</b> are accomplished via either prefixing or suffixing depending on environment Some verb forms {{are accompanied by}} ablaut, and sometimes metathesis.|$|E
5|$|Dyrwood is cursed by the Hollowborn Plague: {{children}} are being born without souls, leaving them totally unresponsive in a way similar to a permanent vegetative state. Many people blame animancers, the scientists who study and manipulate souls. Investigating the curse, the Watcher discovers that the Hollowborns' souls have in fact been stolen by a cult known as the Leaden Key, led by a priest named Thaos, and that Thaos is <b>framing</b> animancers for the Plague. This eventually leads to a riot {{in the capital city}} where animancers are lynched and their college is destroyed.|$|E
30|$|The {{adaptive}} reference <b>frame</b> ordering algorithm, reported previously [24], {{is integrated}} with the proposed prediction architecture. The algorithm is independent of reference <b>frame</b> selection and it offers an efficient mechanism for reordering <b>frame</b> indices which is vital when coding multi-view videos which contain multiple scenes. Coding a <b>frame</b> which belongs to a new scene would change the reference <b>frame</b> ordering, where the most significant reference <b>frame</b> becomes the nearest spatial <b>frame</b> instead of the recent temporal <b>frame.</b> Therefore, the algorithm first detects scene changes by analyzing the amount of intra-prediction for <b>frames</b> which belong to dependent views, then it alters reference <b>frame</b> ordering accordingly so that the spatial <b>frames</b> are indexed prior to temporal <b>frames</b> [24]. The new reference <b>frame</b> ordering is applied for the following <b>frames</b> which belong to neighbouring views.|$|R

Because of his work on the State Building act, Laybourne Smith sat on the Board of Referees responsible for adjudicating disputes, and his position on the Architects Board of South Australia was a direct result of his involvement {{in the creation of the}} Architects Act.|$|E
5|$|Others {{expressed}} a broader analysis, <b>framing</b> Lépine's actions {{as the result}} of societal changes that had led to increased poverty, powerlessness, individual isolation, and polarization between men and women. Noting Lépine's interest in violent action films, some suggested that violence in the media and in society may have influenced his actions. Following a shooting at Dawson College on September 13, 2006, Globe and Mail columnist Jan Wong controversially suggested that Marc Lépine may have felt alienated from Quebec society as he was the child of an immigrant.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} {{a mean of}} a continuous <b>frame</b> which is a generalization of discrete <b>frames.</b> Since a discrete <b>frame</b> is a special case of these <b>frames,</b> we expect {{that some of the}} results that occur in the <b>frame</b> theory will be generalized to these <b>frames.</b> For such a generalization, after giving some basic results and theorems about these <b>frames,</b> we discuss the following: dual to these <b>frames,</b> perturbation of continuous <b>frames</b> and robustness of these <b>frames</b> to an erasure of some elements. 1...|$|R

5|$|The episode's opening scene, {{featuring}} a camera moving slowly towards Scully in a harsh white light, {{was achieved by}} constructing a long narrow set covered in aluminium foil, which amplified the light being used and downplayed any colors. This shot was drained of color entirely, and was combined {{with a series of}} blurring and <b>framing</b> effects in post-production to further enhance the intended image—to create the impression of waking from a dream.|$|E
5|$|The {{house is}} built with stone foundations, {{and the main}} {{structure}} is made of oak timbers, joined together using mortice and tenon joints, and held in place with oak pegs. Wattle and daub or lath and plaster are used to fill the spaces between the timbers. The black and white appearance from the timber <b>framing</b> construction dates from the Tudor period, though some parts have been repaired in later years.|$|E
5|$|The main barn is {{oriented}} on a north–south axis and has {{a conventional}} bent <b>framing</b> and sheathed with vertical boards.

The former ell of the house was converted in a shed and dates to around 1780.|$|E
