5|$|Urban design {{management}} offers prescriptive advice for practitioners trying to organise city planning activities <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> increase sustainability by increasing satisfaction levels. Real estate development and urban planning often occur at very different decision-making levels. The practitioners involved may have diverse educational and professional backgrounds. They certainly have conflicting interests. Providing prescriptive advice for differing, possibly conflicting, groups requires {{construction of a}} framework that accommodates all of their daily activities and responsibilities. Urban {{design management}} provides a common framework to help bring together the conventional practices of urban and regional planning, real estate development, and urban design.|$|E
5|$|Interferometry {{makes use}} of the {{principle}} of superposition to combine waves <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> cause the result of their combination to have some meaningful property that is diagnostic of the original state of the waves. This works because when two waves with the same frequency combine, the resulting intensity pattern is determined by the phase difference between the two waves—waves that are in phase will undergo constructive interference while waves that are out of phase will undergo destructive interference. Waves which are not completely in phase nor completely out of phase will have an intermediate intensity pattern, which can be used to determine their relative phase difference. Most interferometers use light or some other form of electromagnetic wave.|$|E

25|$|The Arabian Peninsula is {{an ancient}} massif {{composed}} of stable crystalline rock whose geologic structure developed concurrently with the Alps. Geologic movements caused the entire mass to tilt eastward and the western and southern edges to tilt upward. In the valley created by the fault, called the Great Rift, the Red Sea was formed. The Great Rift runs from the Mediterranean along {{both sides of the}} Red Sea south through Ethiopia and the lake country of East Africa, gradually disappearing in the area of Mozambique, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. Scientists analyzing photographs taken by United States astronauts on the joint United States-Soviet space mission in July 1975 detected a vast fan-shaped complex of cracks and fault lines extending north and east from the Golan Heights. These fault lines are believed to be the northern and final portion of the Great Rift and are presumed {{to be the result of}} the slow rotation of the Arabian Peninsula counterclockwise <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>will,</b> in approximately 10 million years, close off the Persian Gulf and make it a lake.|$|E

He wrote, “The government must not strip the legal and publicly supported industry of its business and hand it back to drug cartels and criminals ... Dealers don’t card kids.

500|$|In {{most of his}} films, Sukumar's protagonists {{are shown}} to be characterised with grey shades. Y. Sunita Chowdary of The Hindu commented that Sukumar [...] "revels in giving a slight twist to his protagonist, in his {{background}} and character" [...] and leaves the audience to understand him as he [...] "unties the knots during narration and justifies his behaviour and makes us root for him". Karthik Keramalu of CNN-IBN, in his review of Kumari 21F, stated that Sukumar’s lead characters are [...] "psychologically wired differently", adding {{that at least one}} of the characters in his films [...] "behaves <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> amuse the audience and the other characters present in the film". Regarding the same, Sukumar said, [...] "We all have a lot of emotions and we suppress most of them fearing rejection. Instead we sport a smile and move on in this world. Problems arise when we don’t enjoy all feelings like jealousy, selfishness and don’t express them. To achieve something, there must be a driving force and that could be jealousy which you term as negative".|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} {{received}} conflicting reviews by both The Moving Picture World and The New York Dramatic Mirror. The reviewer for the World said, [...] "This well known story is rendered into a motion picture <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> please the most exacting. ... The picture proves {{that a good}} rendering of even an old story is attractive. The audience apparently delights {{in the character of}} John Halifax. He is quite as good on the curtain as he is in the book, and there he has always been a favorite. The different parts are played to perfection. The character of the daughter and the ill son are both faithfully reproduced and seem to live before the audience." [...] The Mirror reviewer The film is not as well acted as Thanhouser pictures usually are. The strict character of the old Quaker is insufficiently expressed and is apt to leave the audience to guess why John is ordered out, and the strike scene is far from impressive. The mob to a man wave their sticks incessantly, instead of portraying intense rage as should have been done." [...] Bowers noted that the Mirror was not a neutral party in respect to the works of the Independent producers.|$|E

The rest of Morphscapes songs were {{composed}} after Red Alert 2. Klepacki composed the album's title track while working on Command & Conquer: Renegade, and feels the game's style is visibly present in Morphscape. Klepacki released the final product after Westwood's dissolution. His biggest inspiration in creating solo works is the legion of fans interested in Command & Conquer. Klepacki took a hiatus from composing video game music to write two other solo albums, {{the first of which}} is entitled Rocktronic. Released in 2004, the album was described as dark, edgy, and heavy <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> appeal to Command & Conquer fans. Klepacki sought out specific samples and instruments used in the Command & Conquer soundtrack for use in the release; the title [...] "Rocktronic" [...] was an attempt to name his style of music. Featuring live drumming in certain songs, the album is Klepacki's best-seller. Following Rocktronic was Virtual Control, released in 2005. Klepacki complemented his usual style with experiments in hip hop on the album. Tracks from each release have been periodically used in The Ultimate Fighter, along with certain custom themes written for the show.|$|E
