40|$|Covalently, {{cross-linked}} immune complexes {{were prepared}} with multivalent 2 -nitro- 4 -azidophenyl X human serum albumin (NAP X HSA) and antibodies to NAP at five times antigen excess. After purification with gel filtration, affinity chromatography with antigen-agarose column, and {{addition of the}} hapten, 9. 5 % of the antibodies dissociated from the complexes by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. After injection of these cross-linked immune complexes into mice, glomeruli stained for the complexes by immunofluorescence microscopy {{for only a few}} hours and electron-dense deposits were not detected. In contrast, when the same immune complexes with comparable lattice but without covalent cross-linking were administered to a second group of mice, the initial deposition by immunofluorescence was comparable and then increased to extensive deposits that persisted to 96 h. In this second group of mice extensive electron-dense deposits evolved. These observations supported the conclusion that the immune complexes initially <b>deposited</b> <b>from</b> circulation <b>must</b> undergo rearrangement to persist and to form electron-dense deposits in glomeruli. The covalently cross-linked immune complexes existed in glomeruli only {{for a short period of}} time since these complexes could not rearrange...|$|R

40|$|An electroactive {{polyaniline}} (PAn) {{was successfully}} prepared from nonaqueous propylene carbonate (PC) solution containing acid (CF 3 COOH) and electrolyte (LiC 104). PAn deposition and the doping-undoping process of deposited PAn film were investigated by consecutive cyclic voltammetry in various electropolymerization s lutions. It {{is confirmed by}} infrared spectral measurement {{that there is no}} essential difference in the manner of bonding between the electroactive PAn films <b>deposited</b> <b>from</b> aqueous and PC solutions. Inspection by scanning electron microscope revealed that PAn films <b>deposited</b> <b>from</b> aqueous HCIO 4 solution had a fibrous structure, whereas the PAn film <b>deposited</b> <b>from</b> PC solution bad a porous surface which resembled polypyrrole films. The shape of the electro-oxidation curve is found to be essentially dif-ferent, depending on the solvent or the pK ~ value of acid in an electropolymerization s lution. An electroactive PAn film <b>deposited</b> <b>from</b> PC solution was applied'to an effective cathode material of a rechargeable lithium battery (Li/LiC 104 -PC/ PAn). The Li/LiC 104 -PC/PAn (<b>deposited</b> <b>from</b> PC solution) battery showed a high coulombic efficiency and high-energy density in charging-discharging behavior. The electroactivity of PAn film <b>deposited</b> <b>from</b> PC solution was found to be as high as, or higher than, that of PAn film <b>deposited</b> <b>from</b> aqueous olution. Electrodes modified by conductive polymer films have been investigated extensively in recent years (1 - 8). Amon...|$|R
40|$|Silicon nitride (a-SiNx:H) films {{deposited}} by {{the expanding}} thermal plasma at high rate (2 ̆ 6 gt; 1 nm/s) {{have been studied}} for application as anti-reflection coatings for multicrystalline silicon (mc-Si) solar cells. Internal quantum efficiency measurements have revealed that bulk passivation is achieved after a firing-through process of the a-SiNx:H as <b>deposited</b> <b>from</b> NH 3 /SiH 4 and N 2 /SiH 4 plasmas. However, the a-SiNx:H films <b>deposited</b> <b>from</b> N 2 /SiH 4 show a lower passivation quality than those <b>deposited</b> <b>from</b> NH 3 /SiH 4.
