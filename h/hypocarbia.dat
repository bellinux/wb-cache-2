50|$|Hypocapnia or hypocapnea (from the Greek words υπό and καπνός kapnós), {{also known}} as <b>hypocarbia,</b> {{sometimes}} incorrectly called acapnia, {{is a state of}} reduced carbon dioxide in the blood. Hypocapnia usually results from deep or rapid breathing, known as hyperventilation.|$|E
50|$|The {{onset of}} CNH in all {{patients}} {{regardless of age}} can be a precursor to ensuing deterioration in patients with infiltrative tumors of the brainstem and medulla. These patients experience prolonged series of CNH before succumbing to the associated deterioration of medullary cardiovascular center, which ultimately results in death. In addition to clinical consequences of a positive CNH diagnosis, sustained hyperventilation also has a marked affect on daily life activities, and may significantly impede a patient’s ability to eat or talk. The persistent <b>hypocarbia,</b> alkalotic pH, and resultant electrolyte disequilibrium may also alter a patient’s mood or mental state. Patients presenting with CNH are often described as inattentive and anxious.|$|E
50|$|For the {{clinical}} diagnosis of CNH, {{it is essential}} that the symptoms, particularly respiratory alkalosis, persist while the patient is both awake and asleep. The presence of hyperventilation during sleep excludes any possible emotional or psychogenic causes for the sustained hyperventilation. There must also be no evidence of drug or metabolic causes, including cardiac or pulmonary disease, or recent or current use of respiration-stimulating drugs. While a positive diagnosis of CNH in adult cases should be reserved only until all other possible causes of tachypnea have been eliminated, CNH should be suspected in any alert child presenting with unexplained hyperventilation and <b>hypocarbia</b> leading to respiratory alkalosis. Once CNH is determined to be a possible cause of hyperventilation, lesions and their location in the brain are verified using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).|$|E
40|$|AIM—To {{determine}} whether patient triggered ventilation (PTV) leads to greater exposure to significant <b>hypocarbia</b> than conventional ventilation (CMV) in premature infants {{during the first}} 72 hours of life.  METHODS—Infants of 32 weeks gestation or less were included. Randomisation yielded 74 infants on PTV and 68 infants on CMV. Arterial PaCO 2 measurements were taken four hourly for the first 72 hours of life.  RESULTS—The mean PaCO 2 levels on days 1, 2, and 3 {{were not significantly different}} between the two groups. The proportion of infants with PaCO 2 levels of 3. 33 kPa or less did not differ between PTV and CMV infants. Mean percentages of infants with this level of <b>hypocarbia</b> at any time were 31. 4 %, 18. 9 %, 8. 8 % on days 1, 2, and 3 respectively.

40|$|Hyperventilation to {{extremely}} low arterial carbon dioxide tension (Paco 2) {{has been used}} in the management of persistent pulmonary hypertension in newborn infants. With progressive <b>hypocarbia,</b> cerebral vasoconstriction occurs, raising the concern that extreme <b>hypocarbia</b> may result in cerebral oxygen deprivation. Therefore, I evaluated regulation of the cerebral circulation during acute <b>hypocarbia</b> in 10 newborn lambs. Whole-brain and regional blood flows measured using radioactive microspheres, arterial and venous (sagittal sinus) blood gases, and oxygen contents were measured in each lamb at four arterial carbon dioxide tensions. Whole-brain oxygen delivery, oxygen consumption, and fractional oxygen extraction were calculated. Finally, arterial and venous lactate concentrations were measured to assess cerebral lactate production. Whole-brain blood flow (CBF) decreased in a nonlinear fashion as Paco 2 ranged from 46 to 12 mm Hg [ln(CBF) = 0. 025 (Paco 2) + 3. 38; r= 0. 70, p< 0. 001].

40|$|SUMMARY Following 5 {{minutes of}} global ischemia, local {{cerebral}} blood flow (LCBF) was shown to have an initial reactive hyperemia that was followed, within the first hour, by persistent hypoperfusion (Part I). In-tracranial pressure (ICP) was never elevated {{during the period of}} poor reperfusion. These experiments attempted to reverse the state of subnormal LCBF by inducing hypercarbia or <b>hypocarbia</b> or maintaining nor-mocarbia. Although <b>hypocarbia</b> did increase LCBF at several electrode sites, neither the intracerebral steal syndrome nor the "squeeze " syndrome are a dominant consequence of hypercarbia in this model of global ischemia. Hypercarbia was consistently more effective in elevating LCBFs and in recovery of the electro-corticogram. It appears that, in the absence of raised ICP, hypercarbia may be preferred to normal or low Paco 2. Even though hypercarbia was superior to normocarbia or <b>hypocarbia,</b> hypercarbia was not a com-pletely satisfactory regimen for reversing the state of poor reperfusion.

40|$|ARTERIAL blood gas {{analysis}} isessential for monitoring the adequacy of ventilation and oxygenation in ventilated babies. It {{is often difficult to}} obtain arterial blood gases frequently especially where resources are limited. Arterial blood sampling leads to blood loss, pain, stress and arteriospasm in neonates and hence need for non invasive monitoring. Pulse oximetry provides the non-invasive method of assessing the oxygenation in neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) patients(1) It is necessary to have a reliable, non-invasive method for detecting <b>hypocarbia</b> and hypercarbia. Both <b>hypocarbia</b> and hypercarbia are detrimental to the ELBW infants and have been implicated as a causative factor in periventricular leukomalacia (PVL), intra-ventricular bleed (IVH) and chronic lung disease (CLD) (2 - 7). Maintaining the PaCO 2 within the desired range by frequent arterial sampling can increase the need for multiple transfusions in these infants(8). Trans-cutaneous CO 2 monitoring is a non-invasive technique for measuring the carbon dioxide(9). However, transcutaneous CO 2 monitoring is not tolerated in VLBW infants because of their fragile skin and is affected by acidosis and hypoxia(10).

Relative changes in total and microvascular cerebral blood volume were determined by steady state contrast agent-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging for transitions from normocarbia to hypercarbia and <b>hypocarbia.</b> Although hypercarbia induced {{a significant increase in}} both total and microvascular blood volume in normal brain and glioma, reactivity of glioma vasculature was significantly blunted in comparison to normal striatum; glioma total CBV increased by 0. 6 ± 0. 1 %/mm Hg CO 2 whereas normal striatum increased by 1. 5 ± 0. 2 %/mm Hg CO 2, (P <. 0001, group t-test). Reactivity of microvascular blood volume was also significantly blunted. In contrast, <b>hypocarbia</b> decreased both total and microvascular blood volumes more in glioma than in normal striatum. These results indicate that cerebral blood vessels derived by tumor-directed angiogenesis do retain reactivity to CO 2.

40|$|Magnesium has a {{profound}} effect on neural excitability; the most characteristic signs and symptoms of Mg deficiency are produced by neural and neuromuscular hyperexcitability. These create a constellation of clinical findings termed tetany syndrome (TS). TS symptoms include muscle spasms, cramps and hyperarousal, hyperventilation and asthenia. Physical signs (Chvostek's, Trousseau's or von Bonsdorff's) and abnormalities of the electromyogram or electroencephalogram can usually be elicited. Signs and symptoms of TS are frequently encountered in clinical practice, especially among patients with functional or stress-related disorders. The role of Mg deficit in TS is suggested by relatively low levels of serum or erythrocyte Mg and by the clinical response to oral Mg salts, which has been demonstrated in controlled studies. Among the more serious neurologic sequelae of TS are migraine attacks, transient ischemic attacks, sensorineural hearing loss and convulsions.

40|$|Abstract__ Human brain {{development}} and maturation consist of complex processes that span {{from the first}} trimester of pregnancy to adult life. These processes include: 1) neuronal proliferation, characterized by generation of neurons in the dorsal subventricular zone and ventral germinative epithelium of the ganglionic eminence; 2) migration, where neurons move from these zones to specific sites where they will reside for life; 3) organization, in which neurons differentiate to subplate neurons, align, orientate and connect through their axons and dendrites. Glial cells differentiate into astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and microglia, and 4) myelination, where oligodendrocytes produce myelin that will be deposited around axons. Preterm infants are born in this critical period, in which the brain is particularly vulnerable to exogenous and endogenous events. Perinatal hypoxia-ischemia, hyperoxia, infection and <b>hypocarbia</b> can result in fluctuations in cerebral blood flow, inflammation, increased excitotoxicity and oxidative stress, {{all of which can}} affect normal brain ontogenesis and cause irreversible injury.

Complex memory tasks remain impaired for a few days after anaesthesia, although immediate memory, tested by digit span, recovers quickly (Flatt, Birrell and Hobbes, 1984). It has been shown that cognition deterio-rates independently of the level of peroperative ventilation, as long as severe <b>hypocarbia</b> is avoided (Blenkarn et al., 1972; Murin and Nagajan, 1974).

Anticholinergic agents are widely used in anaesthesia as premedicants and for the reversal of neuromuscular blockade. It is postu-lated that drugs affecting central cholinergic synapses may be important in the production of postoperative cognitive deficits. The involvement of central cholinergic pathways may be assessed by a comparison of atropine and glycopyrrolate, as the latter does not cross the blood-brain barrier freely (Proakis and Harris, 1978).

Baseline and post intervention measurements were determined by lung function (FVC, FEV 1, FEF 25 - 75), patients’ opinions on physiotherapy (questionnaires), need for antibiotic treatment (clinical follow-up and records) and perception of physical fitness (questionnaires) in the year before and in the year of intervention. Adherence to physiotherapy was monitored by means of a specific device software. ResultsIncreased lung function (FEV 1 p< 0. 01), perception of physical fitness (p< 0. 001) and a reduction in the need for intravenous antibiotic treatment (p< 0. 001) were reported. Adherence to treatment was good/acceptable in 92 % of patients. ConclusionsThis study shows an association between training through a specific device and improved lung function. Further trials are needed to confirm this report...|$|E
40|$|Capnography (ETCO 2) is {{routinely}} {{used as a}} non-invasive estimate of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO 2) levels in order to modify ventilatory settings, whereby {{it is assumed that}} there is a positive gap between PaCO 2 and ETCO 2 of approximately 0. 5 kPa. However, negative values (ETCO 2 > PaCO 2) can be observed. We retrospectively analysed arterial to end-tidal carbon dioxide differences in 799 children undergoing general anaesthesia with mechanical ventilation of the lungs in order to elucidate predictors for a negative gap. A total of 2452 blood gas analysis readings with complete vital sign monitoring, anaesthesia gas analysis and spirometry data were analysed. Mean arterial to end-tidal carbon dioxide difference was - 0. 18 kPa (limits of 95 % agreement - 1. 10 to 0. 74) and 71. 2 % of samples demonstrated negative values. The intercept model revealed PaCO 2 to be the strongest predictor for a negative PaCO 2 -ETCO 2 difference. A decrease in PaCO 2 by 1 kPa resulted in a decrease in the PaCO 2 -ETCO 2 difference by 0. 23 kPa. This study demonstrates that ETCO 2 monitoring in children whose lungs are mechanically ventilated may paradoxically lead to overestimation of ETCO 2 (ETCO 2 > PaCO 2) with a subsequent risk of unrecognised <b>hypocarbia...</b>|$|E
40|$|Electrical {{impedance}} plethysmography (EIP) is a noninvasive {{method that}} may be useful for both the continuous and serial measurement of changes in pulsatile cerebral blood volume and perhaps cerebral blood flow (CBF). It has not been well validated by comparison with other methods. To attempt to validate the EIP technique, {{the relationship between the}} peak amplitude of the transcranial, cardiac-synchronous impedance waveform (dZ(p)) and cerebral blood flow measured by the radiolabelled microsphere technique (CBF(rlm)) and laser Doppler spectroscopy (CBF(lds) was studied in rabbits. CBF was altered by inducing hypertension using metaraminol, hypotension by controlled haemorrhage or <b>hypocarbia</b> by hyperventilation. Twenty-three comparisons between dZ(p) and CBF(lds) and 19 comparisons with CBF(rim) were made in eight rabbits. The percentage change between each measurement using the three techniques in each animal was calculated. Using pooled data from all the animals, the linear regression equations were dZ(p) = 0. 5 CBF(rlm) + 33 (r = 0. 38, p = 0. 22, SE = 79) and dZ(p) = 0 - 84 CBF(lds) + 19. 6 (r = 0. 46, p = 0. 09, SE = 72). It is concluded that, in the anaesthetised rabbit, when large changes in CBF are induced by the manoeuvres described above, changes in dZ(p) correlate very weakly with changes in either cortical or global CBF, and are influenced by other factors such as pulsatile intracranial blood volume...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{variations}} in carbon dioxide concentration on the antagonism of pancuronium-induced neuromuscular block by neostigmine were studied in 21 patients, normocarbia (PE'CO, 5. 4 %, Pico, 4. 93 kPa, n = 7), <b>hypocarbia</b> (PE ' C 0 : 3 6 %, PaCOl 3. 30 kPa, » = 7) and hypercarbia (PE'CQ, 7. 5 %, PSLCOI 7 13 kPa, n = 7). Mechanical and electromyographic responses to ulnar nerve stimulauon (0. 1 Hz and 2 Hz) were recorded A 90 % block during nitrous oxide in oxygen anaesthesia was maintained by incremental single injections of pancuronium and reversed with neostigmine 0. 035 mgkg" 1 with atropine 0. 0175 mgkg" 1. The recovery of twitch tension up to 50 % was similar in all groups but thereafter slower in the hypercarbia group. The recovery times from 25 % to 75 % twitch tension correlated with P*co, (r = 0. 55, P< 0. 05). A residual block of about 10 % {{was seen in}} hypercarbic patients. However, the recovery of e. m. g. amplitude and train-of-four ratios was similar in all groups. Thus, the unpaired recovery of twitch tension {{seems to be the}} result of depressed contractihty rather than failure of neuromuscular transmission Residual neuromuscular blockade is considered to contribute significantly to morbidity and possibly even mortality following operation (Cascorbi an...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background and Aim In {{patients}} with cystic fibrosis (CF) {{the architecture of}} the developing lungs and the ventilation of lung units are progressively affected, influencing intrapulmonary gas mixing and gas exchange. We examined the long-term course of blood gas measurements in relation to characteristics of lung function and the influence of different CFTR genotype upon this process. Methods Serial annual measurements of PaO 2 and PaCO 2 assessed in relation to lung function, providing functional residual capacity (FRC pleth), lung clearance index (LCI), trapped gas (V TG), airway resistance (sR eff), and forced expiratory indices (FEV 1, FEF 50), were collected in 178 children (88 males; 90 females) with CF, over an age range of 5 to 18 years. Linear mixed model analysis and binary logistic regression analysis were used to define predominant lung function parameters influencing oxygenation and carbon dioxide elimination. Results PaO 2 decreased linearly from age 5 to 18 years, and was mainly associated with FRC pleth, (p 1 (p 50 (p p 2 showed a transitory phase of low PaCO 2 values, mainly during the age range of 5 to 12 years.

40|$|Objective: The goal of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} the risk factors of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) in neonatal intensive care unit in preterm infants born with birth weight 1000 - 2000 g or at gestational age less than 34 weeks. Material & Methods: From August 2000 to December 2001, 50 preterm newborn infants with birth weights less than 2000 g or gestational age less than 34 weeks admitted to the NICU were studied. Newborn infants with birth weight between 1200 - 2000 g who received more than 6 hours oxygen and newborn infants with birth weight 1000 - 1200 g regardless of oxygen therapy, who survived until 4 weeks postnatal, were enrolled and followed. Patients underwent indirect ophthalmologic examination by two ophthalmologists between 4 - 8 weeks post partum. The newborn infants who had ROP were assigned to case group and those without ROP to control group, both groups were reexamined every 2 - 4 weeks or according to international classification of retinopathy of prematurity (ICROP) advice. Findings: Fifty newborn infants, 36 (72 %) in control group, 14 (28 %) in case group, were studied. Gestational age and birth weight of the patients with ROP were significantly lower than those of control group. Duration of oxygen therapy, hyperoxia, acidosis, hypercarbia, <b>hypocarbia</b> and phototherapy are suggested as risk factors contributing to ROP. Conclusion: The results of this study demonstrate that the ROP frequency remains elevated among premature and very low birth weight infants. Infants at risk for ROP should have screening eye examinations and proper treatment...|$|E
