30|$|When they occur, <b>risks</b> have an <b>impact</b> on project {{costs and}} project {{completion}} time (Marmier et al. 2013); so, anticipated project success should depend on estimated <b>risk</b> <b>impacts,</b> {{as well as}} on estimated occurrence probabilities. The risks we consider in this study all have negative or undesirable consequences for the focal project, in line with standard project management practice (Maguire and Hardy 2013; Oehmen et al. 2014). The outcomes that result from the decision to carry out the project are always influenced by occurring risks (Raz et al. 2002), such that increasing <b>risk</b> <b>impacts</b> and <b>risk</b> occurrence probabilities mitigate the value of the decision to conduct the project (Dey 2012). If project success is compliance with a specific outcome, which has specific value to the company, then anticipated project success should decrease with greater <b>risk</b> <b>impacts</b> and <b>risk</b> occurrence probabilities.|$|R

30|$|In Hypothesis H 2, {{we propose}} that {{estimated}} <b>risk</b> <b>impact</b> {{should have a}} significantly stronger influence on anticipated project success than estimated risk occurrence probability. Contrary to what was predicted, only the influence of estimated risk occurrence probability {{was found to be}} significant (Î³Â =Â âˆ’ 0.362, pÂ <Â  0.001), while estimated <b>risk</b> <b>impact</b> did not have significant influence (Î³Â =Â  0.026, pÂ =Â  0.880). Furthermore, the path coefficient of estimated <b>risk</b> <b>impact</b> to anticipated project success is slightly positive, which therefore does not indicate that higher estimated <b>risk</b> <b>impact</b> would reduce anticipated project success. Using linear regression analysis, we test if estimated <b>risk</b> <b>impact</b> accounts for a significant R 2 of anticipated project success, which was not the case (R 2 Â =Â  0.006, F(1202)Â =Â  1.30, pÂ =Â  0.256). When adding estimated risk occurrence probability to the regression model, R 2 increased significantly (R_change^ 2 Â =Â  0.107, F(1201)Â =Â  24.17, pÂ <Â  0.001). Accordingly, H 2 has to be rejected, as the results show that estimated <b>risk</b> <b>impact</b> has no significant effect on anticipated project success, while the effect of estimated risk occurrence probability on anticipated project success is significant.|$|R
