500|$|Nabil Elderkin {{directed}} the music video for the song. In a behind-the-scenes video, Mars explained, [...] "The {{concept of the}} video is my struggle, to tell this girl I'd do anything for her, so I'm going as far as dragging a piano {{to get to her}} <b>just</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> can sing my heart out." [...] Mars, sarcastically, replied to rumors related to the use of special effects: [...] "A lot of people think this is a camera trick, but that is a heavy piano. Luckily, I’ve been doing about, you know, 800 to 967 push-ups every day, so it’s not a big deal, I can handle it." [...] Regardless, this achievement, Mars was cautious: [...] "The actions in this video serve as a metaphor, and should not be taken literally. I am aware of the power of visual media, and I encourage everyone who watches this video to understand that it is an artistic interpretation of the song, and not something to imitate".|$|E
2500|$|Despite her {{worldwide}} recognition, Nilsson {{said she}} was nervous before every major performance. [...] "Before a premiere, {{on the way to}} the opera, I'd hope for just a small, small accident, it didn't need to be much, but <b>just</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> would not have to sing", she said in a 1977 interview on Swedish TV. Nilsson often spoke of her limits. She said her voice was not a good fit with what she described as the softer textures and refined tones of Italian operas. Nonetheless, she sang roles in Italianate operas such as Donna Anna in Don Giovanni.|$|E

2500|$|Led Zeppelin's Jimmy Page {{talked about}} his love of Indian music, saying: [...] "I went to India after I {{came back from a}} tour with the Yardbirds in the late sixties <b>just</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> could hear the music firsthand. Let's put it this way: I had a sitar before George Harrison got his. I wouldn't say I played it as well as he did, though …" [...] The East Indian scales used on the track [...] "Friends" [...] (Led Zep III) [...] "Kashmir" [...] (Physical Graffiti) are {{considered}} fine examples of the influence of the sitar in rock music. The Doors extensively used Indian and near eastern scales in their psychedelic soundscapes. Robbie Krieger's guitar part on [...] "The End" [...] was heavily influenced by Indian ragas and features melodic and rhythmic qualities that suggest a sitar or veena. Fleetwood Mac's Gold Dust Woman features the instrument, as well. Many pop performances actually involve the Electric Sitar, a solid body guitar-like instrument quite different from the traditional acoustic Indian instrument.|$|E

60|$|I {{sit here}} in Murderers' Row in Folsom, the drowsy hum of flies {{in my ears}} as I ponder that thought of Pascal. It is true.

6000|$|Do you {{understand}} that? Then think {{what would happen}} if you pricked a hole in the ball. The air inside would come hissing out, and the ball would sink again into the water. But the ants would probably fancy the very opposite.

[...] <b>Just</b> <b>so,</b> <b>I</b> believe, when the sea seems to ebb away during the earthquake, the land is really being raised out of the sea, hundreds of miles of coast, perhaps, or a whole island, at once, by the force of the steam and gas imprisoned under the ground. That steam stretches and strains the solid rocks below, till they can bear no more, and snap, and crack, with frightful roar and clang; then out of holes and chasms in the ground rush steam, gases--often foul and poisonous ones--hot water, mud, flame, strange stones--all signs that the great boiler down below has burst at last.|$|E
6000|$|And <b>just</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> now {{did with}} Queequeg. [...] "Queequeg," [...] said I, [...] "get into bed now, and lie {{and listen to}} me." [...] I then went on, {{beginning}} with the rise and progress of the primitive religions, and coming down to the various religions of the present time, during which time I labored to show Queequeg that all these Lents, Ramadans, and prolonged ham-squattings in cold, cheerless rooms were stark nonsense; bad for the health; useless for the soul; opposed, in short, to the obvious laws of Hygiene and common sense. I told him, too, that he being in other things such an extremely sensible and sagacious savage, it pained me, very badly pained me, to see him now so deplorably foolish about this ridiculous Ramadan of his. Besides, argued I, fasting makes the body cave in; hence the spirit caves in; and all thoughts born of a fast must necessarily be half-starved. This {{is the reason why}} most dyspeptic religionists cherish such melancholy notions about their hereafters. In one word, Queequeg, said I, rather digressively; hell is an idea first born on an undigested apple-dumpling; and since then perpetuated through the hereditary dyspepsias nurtured by Ramadans.|$|E

6000|$|Now, my friends, to {{make the}} matter simpler, I will take you at your words, {{for the sake of}} argument. Suppose you do avoid sin from the fear of hell, does that make what you do RIGHT? Does that make YOU right? Does that make your heart right? It is a great blessing to a man's neighbours, certainly, if he is kept from doing wrong any how-- by the fear of hell, or fear of jail, or fear of shame, or fear of ghosts if you like, or any other cowardly and foolish motive--a great blessing to a man's neighbours: but no blessing, that I can see, to the man himself. He is just the same; his heart is not changed; his heart is no more right in the sight of God, or in the sight of any man of common sense either, than it would be if he did the wrong thing, which he loves and dare not do. You feel that yourselves about other people. You will say [...] "That man has a bad heart, for all his respectable outside. He would be a rogue if he dared, and {{therefore}} he IS a rogue." [...] <b>Just</b> <b>so,</b> <b>I</b> say, my friends, take care lest God should say of you, [...] "He would be a sinner if he dared, and therefore he is a sinner.|$|E
6000|$|They, {{who write}} ill, and they, who ne'er durst write, Turn critics, out of mere revenge and spite: A playhouse gives them fame; and up there starts, From a mean fifth-rate wit, {{a man of}} parts. (So common faces on the stage appear; We take them in, and they turn beauties here.) Our author fears those critics as his fate; And those he fears, by {{consequence}} must hate, For they the traffic of all wit invade, As scriveners draw away the bankers' trade. Howe'er, the poet's safe enough to day, They cannot censure an unfinished play. But, as when vizard-mask appears in pit, Straight every man, who thinks himself a wit, Perks up, and, managing his comb with grace, With his white wig sets off his nut-brown face; That done, bears up to th' prize, and views each limb, To know her by her rigging and her trim; Then, the whole noise of fops to wagers go,-- [...] "Pox on her, 'tmust be she;" [...] and--"damme, no!"-- <b>Just,</b> <b>so,</b> <b>I</b> prophesy, these wits to-day Will blindly guess at our imperfect play; With what new plots our Second Part is filled, Who must be kept alive, and who be killed. And as those vizard-masks maintain that fashion, To soothe and tickle sweet imagination; So our dull poet keeps you on with masking, To make you think there's something worth your asking. But, when 'tis shown, that, which does now delight you, Will prove a dowdy, with a face to fright you.|$|E
60|$|It {{seemed a}} {{valuable}} medical course, and I recommended it to a lady. She had run {{down and down}} and down, and had at last {{reached a point where}} medicines no longer had any helpful effect upon her. I said I knew I could put her upon her feet in a week. It brightened her up, it filled her with hope, and she said she would do everything I told her to do. So I said she must stop swearing and drinking, and smoking and eating for four days, and then she would be all right again. And it would have happened <b>just</b> <b>so,</b> <b>I</b> know it; but she said she could not stop swearing, and smoking, and drinking, because she had never done those things. So there it was. She had neglected her habits, and hadn't any. Now that they would have come good, there were none in stock. She had nothing to fall back on. She was a sinking vessel, with no freight in her to throw overboard and lighten ship withal. Why, even one or two little bad habits could have saved her, but she was just a moral pauper. When she could have acquired them she was dissuaded by her parents, who were ignorant people though reared in the best society, and {{it was too late to}} begin now. It seemed such a pity; but there was no help for it. These things ought to be attended to while a person is young; otherwise, when age and disease come, there is nothing effectual to fight them with.|$|E
