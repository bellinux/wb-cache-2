40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} trace protocols of PROLOG programs. We present a precise mathematical specification {{of the box}} model for definite programs as it was informally introduced by Byrd. We also give a sketch of how to generalize this specification to normal logic programs. 1 Introduction The box model as introduced by Byrd (cf. [1, 2]) describes the process of finding an answer to a query wrt a logic program {{by means of a}} chronological trace protocol. This protocol contains <b>entries</b> for <b>primitive</b> events associated with the execution of PROLOG procedures. Basic events are call (a procedure is being entered), exit (a procedure was left signaling a success), redo (another solution to the call associated with the procedure is sought for), and fail (there is no (other) solution). Byrd only gives an informal account of how to visualize procedural aspects of the execution of PROLOG programs. He e. g. does not explicitly consider goals with variables and does not show how to keep track o [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The {{quiescence}} of hematopoietic {{stem cells}} (HSCs) {{is critical for}} preserving a lifelong steady pool of HSCs to sustain the highly regenerative hematopoietic system. It is thought that specialized niches in which HSCs reside control the balance between HSC quiescence and self-renewal, yet {{little is known about}} the extrinsic signals provided by the niche and how these niche signals regulate such a balance. We report that CXCL 12 produced by bone marrow (BM) stromal cells is not only the major chemoattractant for HSCs but also a regulatory factor that controls the quiescence of primitive hematopoietic cells. Addition of CXCL 12 into the culture inhibits <b>entry</b> of <b>primitive</b> hematopoietic cells into the cell cycle, and inactivation of its receptor CXCR 4 in HSCs causes excessive HSC proliferation. Notably, the hyperproliferative Cxcr 4 −/− HSCs are able to maintain a stable stem cell compartment and sustain hematopoiesis. Thus, we propose that CXCR 4 /CXCL 12 signaling is essential to confine HSCs in the proper niche and controls their proliferation...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{relate the}} number of {{permutation}} polynomials in Fq[x] of degree d≤q− 2 to the solutions (x 1,x 2,…,xq) {{of a system of}} linear equations over Fq, with the added restriction that xi≠ 0 and xi≠xj whenever i≠j. Using this we find an expression for {{the number of}} permutation polynomials of degree p− 2 in Fp[x] in terms of the permanent of a Vandermonde matrix whose <b>entries</b> are the <b>primitive</b> pth roots of unity. This leads to nontrivial bounds for the number of such permutation polynomials. We provide numerical examples to illustrate our method and indicate how our results can be generalised to polynomials of other degrees...|$|R
40|$|Primitive {{representations}} of finite {{groups as well}} as primitive finite groups were classified in the O’nan-Scott Theorem. In this paper we classify faithful finite primitive semigroup representations. To each finite primitive representation, we associate an invariant, a finite dimensional matrix with <b>entries</b> in a <b>primitive</b> finite group representation. To a large extent, this matrix determines the representation. In later papers in this series the invariant is further explored. Our primitivity results rely on two main ideas, one of which is a small but important part of the theory of tame algebras developed by R. McKenzie, while the other is our adaptation of Rees matrix theory to the representation theory of finite semigroups. Using the latter idea we are able to provide a description of all {{representations of}} a regular J class of a finite semigroup. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{contrast}} with mammalian cells, {{little is known}} about the control of Ca 2 + <b>entry</b> into <b>primitive</b> protozoans. Here we report that Ca 2 + influx in pathogenic Trypanosoma brucei can be regulated by phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2) and the subsequent release of arachidonic acid (AA). Several PLA 2 inhibitors blocked Ca 2 + entry; 3 -(4 -octadecyl) -benzoylacrylic acid (OBAA; IC 50 0. 4 +/- 0. 1 microM) was the most potent. We identified in live trypanosomes PLA 2 activity that was sensitive to OBAA and could be stimulated by Ca 2 +, suggesting the presence of positive feedback control. The cell-associated PLA 2 activity was able to release [14 C]AA from labelled phospholipid substrates. Exogenous AA (5 - 50 microM) also initiated Ca 2 + entry in a manner that was inhibited by the Ca 2 + antagonist La 3 + (100 microM). Ca 2 + entry did not depend on AA metabolism or protein kinase activation. The cell response was specific for AA, and fatty acids with greater saturation than tetraeicosanoic acid (AA) or with chain lengths less than C 20 exhibited greatly diminished ability to initiate Ca 2 + influx. Myristate and palmitate inhibited PLA 2 activity and also inhibited Ca 2 + influx. Overall, these results demonstrate that Ca 2 + entry into T. brucei can result from phospholipid hydrolysis and the release of eicosanoic acids...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe epiblast {{layer of}} the chick embryo gives rise to all {{embryonic}} tissues. In vitroanalyses were carried out to determine whether epiblast cells could form skeletal muscle prior to <b>entry</b> into the <b>primitive</b> streak. Epiblasts were separated from the mesoderm, hypoblast, and primitive streak, dissociated to produce a single cell suspension, and plated at high density. Myogenesis began {{on the first day}} in culture, and by the fifth day most cells had differentiated into skeletal muscle. Some cells differentiated without replicating. MyoD messenger RNA was present in epiblast tissue and translated in practically all cells in culture. Cells from regions of the epiblast which do not form muscle later in the embryo did soin vitro. Epiblasts cultured for 2 days as an intact epithelium, or {{in the presence of the}} mesoderm and hypoblast, did not undergo myogenesis. These findings demonstrate that myogenic potential is wide-spread within the primitive streak stage epiblast, and that muscle differentiation, which occurs relatively autonomously in culture, can be prevented by cell and tissue interactions...|$|R

Our main result is summarized as follows. Let d denote a nonnegative integer. Let A denote a matrix in R and let {θdqi}i= 0 d denote {{the roots of}} the characteristic polynomial of A. We say A is multiplicity-free whenever these roots are mutually distinct and contained in R. In this case Ei will denote the primitive idempotent of A associated with thetai (0 ⩽i⩽d). We say A is symmetrizable whenever there exists an invertible diagonal matrix Δ∈R such that ΔAΔ- 1 is symmetric. Let Γ(A) denote the directed graph with vertex set { 0, 1,…,d}, where i→j whenever i≠j and Aij≠ 0. Theorem. Assume that each entry of A is nonnegative. Then the following are equivalent for 0 ≤s,t≤d. (i) The graph Γ(A) is a bidirected path with endpoints s, t: s↔*↔*↔⋯↔*↔t. (ii) The matrix A is symmetrizable and multiplicity-free. Moreover the (s,t) -entry of Ei times (θi-θ 0) ⋯(θi-θi- 1) (θi-θi+ 1) ⋯(θi-θd) is independent of i for 0 ≤i≤d, and this common value is nonzero.
