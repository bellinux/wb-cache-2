Da häufig nur sehr wenige experimentelle Daten vorliegen,werden Methoden benötigt, die eine {{quantitative}} Stoffdatenvorhersage ermöglichen. Hierfür werden üblicherweise Zustandsgleichungen oder GE-Modelle verwendet, die zwar sehr gute Korrelationswerkzeuge sind, aber erhebliche Schwächen bei der Stoffdatenvorhersage haben. Das Entwicklungspotenzial dieser Ansätze ist zudem weitgehend ausgereizt. Die vorliegende Arbeit ist in zwei Teile gegliedert. The {{first part}} of this work is on molecular modeling and simulation of 12 industriallyrelevant pure fluids as well as 12 binary mixtures of these components. Their economicalimportance and hazardous nature is a strong incentive for computer simulations. The investigation of these substances is separated into two groups. The Phosgene groupincludes Hydrogen chloride, Phosgene, Benzene, Chlorobenzene, Ortho-Dichlorobenzeneand Toluene. The <b>Ethylene</b> <b>oxide</b> group contains <b>Ethylene</b> <b>oxide,</b> <b>Ethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> andWater. The underlying force fields for these 12 pure substances are developed in this workon the basis of quantum chemical information on molecular geometry and electrostatics. The molecular models are individually optimized to experimental pure fluid data for vaporpressure and saturated liquid density. A comparison to other molecular models fromthe literature is given. The unlike dispersive interaction is optimized for ten of the 12 studied binary mixtures. Previously unpublished experimental VLE data, measured byBASF in the vicinity of ambient temperature, are predominantly used for these fits. VLEdata, including dew point composition, saturated densities and enthalpy of vaporization,are predicted {{for a wide range of}} temperatures and compositions. The predictions arecompared to additional experimental binary VLE data that was not considered in themodel development. The good agreement shows the reliability of the molecular approachfor predicting thermophysical properties of hazardous fluid mixtures. In the second part of this work, by assessing a large number of binary systems, it isshown on a large scale that molecular modeling is a reliable and robust route to VLE of mixtures.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Chemical process synthesis is an open ended step of process design as it deals {{with the problem of}} how to develop and integrate the chemical process flowsheet. Over the past four decades, very few systematic procedures have been proposed for the rigorous synthesis of complete chemical process flowsheets. Mathematical design and heuristics from experience of past processes are the two main methods usually employed in process synthesis. Most approaches for new designs use heuristics based on studying reaction and separation systems in isolation. This thesis discusses the development of a new process synthesis systematic procedure and software that integrates a knowledge based system with Aspen HYSYS process simulator, HYSYS optimizer, Aspen Icarus economic evaluator, and databases, utilising knowledge from existing industrial processes to obtain design rules. The proposed generic superstructure for the synthesis and optimization of reaction-separation-recycle systems has been validated. To account for the non-ideal behaviour of reactors, modular simulation is used and an example of the approach is illustrated for a fluidized bed reactor. Preliminary work in customizing Aspen HYSYS to simulate new unit operation has been illustrated. A Visual Basic for Application (VBA) programming code has been developed to link the integrated knowledge based system (IKBS) to Aspen HYSYS. The prototype IKBS has been applied for the selection of reactor-separator-recycle systems for <b>ethylene</b> <b>oxide,</b> <b>ethylene</b> <b>glycol,</b> acetic acid and cumene manufacturing processes as case studies. A wide range of chemical reactors and separators were considered during the selection process and then elimination occurs at different levels leading to the best alternatives being selected for simulation, optimization and economic evaluation in the second phase of the IKBS for future development.

40|$|For {{modelling}} reactive distillation columns, two {{distinctly different}} approaches {{are available in}} the literature: (1) the equilibrium (EQ) stage model, in which the vapour and liquid phases are assumed to be in thermodynamic equilibrium, and (2) the nonequilibrium (NEQ) stage model in which the finite mass transfer rates across the vapour–liquid interface are accounted for. In this paper, these two approaches are compared using two case studies: (a) synthesis of MTBE and (b) hydration of <b>ethylene</b> <b>oxide</b> to <b>ethylene</b> <b>glycol.</b> It is shown that while the phenomena of multiple steady states is exhibited by both modelling approaches, the “window ” in which these multiplicities occur is significantly reduced in the NEQ model. It is also shown that in actual column design, some of the steady states calculated by the EQ model cannot be realised due to e. g. flooding or weeping limitations on distillation trays. Another important conclusion that can be drawn from this work is that the hardware design can have a significant influence on the conversion and selectivity. It is concluded that for design of reactive distillation columns we must adopt the NEQ modelling approach. © 2000 Elsevier Science S. A. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|The use of organotransition metal {{complexes}} for selective functionalization of hydrocarbons is {{of great}} importance. Dioxygen is the most practical oxidant for large-scale applications in the petroleum industry. The focus of this work {{is the development of}} ligand-modulated platinum-based systems that can utilize O 2 or air for selective transformation of organoplatinum(II) derivatives into alcohols, diols, aminoalcohols and epoxides in aqueous media. We found that the hemilabile tripod ligand dipyridylmethanesulfonate (dpms) enables facile aerobic functionalization of various Pt II Me complexes and some olefin hydroxo Pt II complexes in hydroxylic solvents such as water and alcohols. Complexes LPt II (R) (HX) (L = dpms; R = Me, Ph; HX = H 2 O, MeOH, PhNH 2) are oxidized by O 2 to yield virtually quantitatively LPt IV (R) (X) (OH). Some of the derived Pt IV alkyls LPt IV (Alk) (X) (OH) (X = OH, OMe) can reductively eliminate methanol in high yield. The mechanism of C-O elimination from LPt IV (Me) (X) (OH) (X = OH, OMe) in acidic aqueous media involves two concurrent pathways: an S N 2 attack by water and an S N 2 attack by a hydroxo or methoxo ligand of another Pt IV species. In the latter case dimethyl ether is produced. The complex (dpms) Pt(ethylene) (OH) is oxidized by O 2 in water to give a Pt IV hydroxyethyl derivative that reductively eliminates <b>ethylene</b> <b>oxide</b> and <b>ethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> in aqueous solutions. The complexes derived from cyclic alkenes, cis-cyclooctene, norbornene, benzonorbornadiene, (dpms) Pt II (cy-alkene) (OH), undergo olefin oxoplatination to give 1, 2 -oxaplatinacyclobutanes (Pt II oxetanes). The derived Pt II oxetanes are easily oxidized by O 2 to produce Pt IV oxetanes. The latter eliminate cleanly the corresponding epoxides by the mechanism of direct C(sp 3) -O reductive eliminations, unprecedented in organoplatinum chemistry. The 1, 2 -azaplatinacyclobutanes (Pt II azetidines) LPt II (CH 2 CH 2 NHR-&kappaC,&kappaN) (R = t-Bu, Me) are oxidized by O 2 in the presence of acids to give Pt IV azetidine complexes, [LPt(CH 2 CH 2 NHR-&kappaC,&kappaN) (OH) ]+. The latter undergo reductive elimination of N-alkyl ethanolammonium salts, HOCH 2 CH 2 NH 2 R+, in acidic aqueous solutions at elevated temperatures. Efficient catalytic systems based on palladium acetate, di(6 -pyridyl) ketone and 6 -methyldi(2 -pyridyl) methanesulfonate ligands, suitable for selective oxidation of ethylene with H 2 O 2 to glycol acetates were developed.
