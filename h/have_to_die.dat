5|$|They realise {{that this}} was a trap {{arranged}} by Kovarian, as the Silence begin to escape confinement and overload the eyedrives (including Madame Kovarian's), killing their users. The Doctor and River escape {{to the top of the}} pyramid while Amy and Rory fight off a wave of Silence and Amy realises who Rory is. Madame Kovarian dislodges her own eyedrive as it begins to overload, but Amy forces it back in place with the intention of killing her as revenge for Kovarian taking her child (Melody Pond) away. Amy and Rory regroup with River and the Doctor. River tries to convince the Doctor that this frozen timeline is acceptable and that he does not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>die,</b> but the Doctor explains that all of reality will soon break down. River claims she'll suffer more than anyone else in the universe if she has to kill the Doctor, despite his horror at the idea. To stop it, the Doctor marries River on the spot and whispers something in her ear, declaring that he had just told her his name. He then requests that River allow him to prevent the universe's destruction. The two kiss, and reality begins to return to normal.|$|E

Emma asks {{to speak with}} Regina alone, and tells {{her that if she}} tells Robin the truth about how she feels, {{everything}} will be fixed and they can both get their happy endings with the men they love, acknowledging that she herself never got the chance to tell Hook how she really felt before it was too late. The trio arrive at the chapel to stop the wedding, but before they can do so, Rumple suddenly appears to stop them. Emma and Henry try to distract Rumple as Regina tries to work up the nerve to interrupt the ceremony. Emma engages Rumple in a sword fight, until he is able to knock her out temporarily. He then aims his sword at Henry, but Regina jumps in front of him just in time to take the hit herself, opting to save Henry instead of pursuing Robin. Moments later, Robin and Zelena exit the chapel and Robin rushes to Regina's side as Zelena's envy starts to take over, causing her to start turning green. Robin tells Regina that she won't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>die</b> alone.|$|E

Because Christ said you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>die</b> to self to follow him". The song is also lyrically about a break-up with sinful human nature.|$|E

Jackson later said of [...] "Beat It", [...] "the point {{is no one}} has to be the tough guy, you can walk away from a fight and still be a man. You don't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>die</b> to prove you're a man".

500|$|In {{writing the}} pilot episode, series creator Eric Kripke made several {{dramatic}} revisions to John's storyline. The {{first draft of}} the script had Sam and Dean being raised by their aunt and uncle, though this was changed when Kripke realized that the backstory became much less complicated by having John raise them on the road. Another revision had John dying {{at the end of}} the episode instead of Sam's girlfriend Jessica. Though he survives in the final version of the pilot, the writers decided halfway through production of the first season that John did <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>die,</b> as they believed his separation from his sons [...] "split the show" [...] by having him away [...] "doing more interesting things than the boys are doing." [...] Kripke also felt that John kept Sam and Dean away from the [...] "front lines", his death being required to allow the brothers to [...] "explore, investigate and confront the yellow-eyed demon directly." [...] The writers initially intended for John to die in the car accident in [...] "Devil's Trap," [...] but they ultimately postponed his death to prevent the finale from becoming too dark. Following the character's eventual escape from Hell, executive producer Ben Edlund stated that even the writers are unsure of where John's soul ended up.|$|E

500|$|Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film 2 out of 4 stars, stating, [...] "The {{movie is a}} mess: a gassy costume epic with nobody at the center." [...] Ebert stated the film may have been {{educational}} for the test audience participants who wrote, [...] "Why does she <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>die</b> at the end?" [...] on their evaluation cards. In a review entitled Vivid Action Can't Save Miscast 'Joan, Todd McCarthy praised the film's action scenes and technical aspects, including Thierry Arbogast's cinematography, though overall gave a negative review. He criticised the casting of Jovovich, stating {{the only thing she}} brought to the film was [...] "her strikingly tall and skinny physicality, which is not exactly how one has been led to picture [...] ". Ron Wells from Film Threat, however, gave the film four out of five stars. Also praising the action scenes, Wells stated that the film's main strength was its [...] "adult ambiguities and relationships"; its decision not to portray Joan as a [...] "super-hero", but rather to let the audience decide whether she was a prophet or merely bipolar, concluding, [...] "This film, as most things that involve religion, is better understood if you learn not to take everything so literally." ...|$|E
500|$|Davies wrote former Prime Minister Harriet Jones (Penelope Wilton) {{into the}} script on —before Wilton was {{approached}} about reprising the role—because Gardner and Collinson wished {{for the character}} to have a satisfying and redemptive conclusion; in the dénouement of her previous appearance in [...] "The Christmas Invasion", the character faced a vote of no confidence in Parliament after she ordered Torchwood to shoot down a fleeing Sycorax ship. Harriet Jones' story arc thus formed a tripartite storyline which consisted of an introduction, animosity towards the Doctor, and redemption (albeit {{at the cost of}} her life). Davies was aware that Wilton was [...] "very hard to book" [...] and restricted her appearance to one day's filming in one location (Harriet's home) to make negotiations easier; had Wilton declined, Davies planned to replace her with either Donna, Mr Copper (Clive Swift) from [...] "Voyage of the Damned", or Elton from [...] "Love & Monsters". Wilton accepted unconditionally because she [...] "would do anything for ...

500|$|After {{the end of}} the war, Sebille left {{active duty}} with the Air Force and began work as a {{commercial}} airline pilot. However he returned to the Air Force in July 1946 after he was offered a commission as a First Lieutenant. He held several positions, first as a staff officer with the Ninth United States Air Force headquarters at Biggs Army Airfield at Fort Bliss, Texas. Shortly thereafter, Sebille was assigned as an F-51 Mustang and F-80 Shooting Star instructor pilot, teaching other pilots how to transition from conventional fighter aircraft to newer jet engine powered models. Sebille then attended Air Tactical School at Tyndall Field, Florida. He was then assigned to Clark Air Base in the Philippines in 1948. During this time, he flew an F-51D named Nancy III (tail number 44-74112). In November 1948, Sebille was once again promoted to major and made the commanding officer of the 67th Fighter-Bomber Squadron, 18th Fighter-Bomber Wing, a component of the Fifth United States Air Force stationed in Japan for post-World War II occupation duties. In November 1949, the squadron began receiving new F-80's but continued to fly a mix of F-80 and F-51 aircraft. Eventually, the squadron transitioned entirely to F-80s, then back to F-51s. During this time, Sebille was known to spend time in his squadron's Quonset hut. He frequently discussed fighting and death, including sentiments supporting suicide attack, at one point saying [...] "If you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>die,</b> then take some of the enemy with you." [...] During this time Sebille worked mostly administrative duty as the squadron absorbed new aircraft and pilots in Japan.|$|E
500|$|On December 30, 2004, {{following}} the island being moved in [...] "There's No Place Like Home", {{the survivors of}} Oceanic Flight 815, the freighter team, and Juliet Burke (Elizabeth Mitchell) begin to erratically jump through time - something Faraday likens to standing on a skipping record - [...] while the Others are unaffected. The first jump takes them {{to the day when}} the Beechcraft carrying Mr. Eko's brother crashes onto the island. John Locke is shot in the leg by Ethan Rom (William Mapother), who has not yet met him and therefore does not recognize him. Meanwhile, James [...] "Sawyer" [...] Ford (Josh Holloway), Juliet and the freighter team head to the [...] in order to determine when they are. A second jump brings the group forward in time to after the destruction of the station, while Locke is approached by Richard Alpert (Nestor Carbonell), who recognizes Locke and treats his wound. He informs Locke that they will be strangers at their next meeting, and explains {{that the only way to}} stop the erratic movements through time is to bring back everyone who has left the island, and to do that Locke will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>die.</b> Another jump brings them to the past, and they find that the Swan station is now intact. Sawyer tries to contact Desmond Hume (Henry Ian Cusick), who is inside, but Daniel asserts that the past can not be changed, and since Desmond did not know Sawyer already when they first met, Sawyer cannot be successful. No one answers, and everyone heads back to the beach. Daniel stays behind and knocks again, and Desmond emerges dressed in a hazmat suit, thus belying Daniel's original assertion. Daniel tells him that if Desmond's future self and the survivors of 815 make it off the island on the helicopter then he should go to Oxford University and find Daniel's mother, in order to help the survivors. Another jump occurs just before Daniel can give his mother's name.|$|E
