5|$|The Greek Orthodox Church of the Annunciation, Manchester {{was founded}} in 1861, in Broughton. It was {{established}} by the local Greek <b>immigrant</b> <b>community,</b> who {{had arrived in the}} area soon after the Greek War of Independence in the early 19th century. It replaced an earlier place of worship on Cheetham Hill Road, and an earlier chapel on Wellington Street. It is the oldest purpose-built Orthodox church in the country.|$|E
5|$|The Rivington Street {{building}} was constructed as a Protestant church around 1860 by the Second Reformed Presbyterian Church, which served the area's large German <b>immigrant</b> <b>community.</b> In November 1864 the {{building was}} sold to the Orthodox German-Jewish Congregation Shaaray Hashomayim ("Gates of the Heavens"), which had been founded in 1841. Though its Hebrew name was {{essentially the same as}} that used by the First Roumanian-American congregation—Congregation Shaarey Shamoyim—which later purchased the building in 1902, the two congregations were unrelated.|$|E
5|$|Aarhus has {{the highest}} ratio of {{immigrants}} in Denmark, 14.8% of the population, outside the Copenhagen area. During the 1990s there was significant immigration from Turkey and in recent years, there has been high growth in the overall <b>immigrant</b> <b>community,</b> from 27,783 people in 1999 to 40,431 in 2008. The majority of immigrants have roots outside Europe and the developed world, comprising some 25,000 people from 130 different nationalities, with the largest groups coming from the Middle East and north Africa. Some 15,000 have come from within Europe, with Poland, Germany, Romania and Norway being the largest contributors.|$|E

5|$|Fish, {{traditionally}} carp, but now other firm {{white fish}} too, are minced and shaped into loaves or balls and cooked in fish broth, {{such as the}} gefilte fish of the Ashkenazi Jews, who also brought pickled herring from Eastern Europe. Herring is often served at the kiddush that follows synagogue services on Shabbat, especially in Ashkenazi communities. In the Russian <b>immigrant</b> <b>community</b> it may be served as a light meal with boiled potatoes, sour cream, dark breads and schnapps or vodka.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, Erie had a {{significant}} Russian <b>immigrant</b> <b>community,</b> many members of which worked in the shipbuilding plants along the bayfront. Unusual for a Great Lakes city, {{a substantial number of}} these Russian immigrants were priestless (Bespopovtsy) Old Believers. In 1983, most of this community united with the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia and became an Old Ritualist priest within the canonical Orthodox Church. Even today, the gold-domed Church of the Nativity, on the bayfront near the former heart of the Russian community, is an Old Ritualist church and home parish to the famed iconographer Fr. Theodore Jurewicz.|$|E
5|$|Starting in {{the early}} 1990s, St. Louis became home to a {{substantial}} Bosnian <b>immigrant</b> <b>community,</b> which became the second-largest in the United States in 1999. The city also began to see an increase in immigrants from Mexico, Vietnam, Ethiopia, and Somalia. Many immigrants reported moving to St. Louis, particularly its south side Bevo Mill neighborhood, due to the low cost of living compared to other American cities. Despite this increase, the foreign-born population of the St. Louis region was roughly one-third of the national average in 2010.|$|E

5|$|A harsh anti-union clampdown {{followed}} the Haymarket incident. There {{was a massive}} outpouring of community and business support for the police and many thousands of dollars were donated to funds for their medical care and to assist their efforts. The entire labor and <b>immigrant</b> <b>community,</b> particularly Germans and Bohemians, came under suspicion. Police raids were carried out on homes and offices of suspected anarchists. Scores of suspects, many only remotely related to the Haymarket affair, were arrested. Casting legal requirements such as search warrants aside, Chicago police squads subjected the labor activists of Chicago to an eight-week shakedown, ransacking their meeting halls and places of business. The emphasis was on the speakers at the Haymarket rally and the newspaper Arbeiter-Zeitung. A small group of anarchists were discovered to {{have been engaged in}} making bombs on the same day as the incident, including round ones like the one used in Haymarket Square.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} housing projects, a 1955 urban renewal bond issue totaled more than $110 million. The bonds {{provided}} funds to purchase land to build three expressways into downtown St. Louis, which later became Interstate 64, Interstate 70, and Interstate 44. In 1967, the highway-only Poplar Street Bridge opened to move traffic {{from all three}} expressways over the Mississippi River. The openings of the Arch in 1965 and the bridge in 1967 were accompanied by {{the opening of a}} new stadium for the St. Louis Cardinals. The Cardinals moved into Busch Memorial Stadium early in the 1966 season. Construction of the stadium required the demolition of Chinatown, St. Louis, ending the decades-old presence of a Chinese <b>immigrant</b> <b>community.</b>|$|E
5|$|Middle Road is a road {{stretching}} {{along the}} Downtown Core and Rochor planning areas within the Central Area of Singapore. It starts from its junction with Selegie Road and ends at Beach Road. Middle Road {{was already in}} existence in early Singapore, appearing in George Drumgoole Coleman's Map of Singapore in 1836. The area around Middle Road was the original settlement of the Hainanese <b>immigrant</b> <b>community,</b> a community noted for its {{active role in the}} food and beverage history of Singapore. From the late 19th century until the Second World War, the area around Middle Road, Hylam Street and Malay Street was also a bustling Japanese enclave known for its brothels of Karayuki-san and traditional shops run by the Japanese immigrants.|$|E

40|$|In recent decades, {{governance}} {{approaches have}} been widely advocated {{in the context of}} <b>immigrant</b> <b>communities.</b> The interplay between state, market, and civil society results in several modes of governance in these approaches. This chapter shows that each mode of governance has its positive and negative consequences for the regeneration of <b>immigrant</b> <b>communities.</b> Planning support systems (PSS) can assist in dealing with the negative consequences. This chapter suggests that three types of PSS—namely ‘‘informing PSS,’’ ‘‘communicating PSS,’’ and ‘‘analyzing PSS’’—can play a distinctive role in dealing with the specific defi- ciencies of each mode of governance in the context of <b>immigrant</b> <b>communities...</b>|$|R
5|$|At {{the same}} time, {{the police were}} {{managing}} the Sitting Bull incident. In 1876 the United States military led a campaign against the Sioux in Dakota; the Sioux's leader, Sitting Bull, concluded that the conflict was unwinnable, and chose to seek sanctuary in Canada. Sitting Bull arrived in May the following year and, by the summer, around 5,600 Sioux had crossed the border despite opposition from the Blackfoot. The mounted police helped to facilitate the negotiations with the Sioux, in which Assistant Commissioner Acheson Irvine played a prominent part. The Sioux declined to return south, however, and the police had to deploy around 200 men to Fort Walsh to oversee the <b>immigrant</b> <b>community.</b> The police lived in primitive conditions and voluntarily shared {{some of their own}} supplies with the Sioux, who were not covered by Treaty 7 and therefore ineligible for government support. Nonetheless, starvation gradually forced the return of most of the newcomers to the United States, and Sitting Bull himself finally surrendered in 1881.|$|E

40|$|Research on <b>immigrant</b> <b>communities</b> {{has often}} been reductionist, stereotypical, and simplistic, {{and even the most}} well‐intentioned {{researchers}} are susceptible to using cultural deficit models. This chapter critically evaluates some of the dominant tensions and problem areas with respect to researching <b>immigrant</b> <b>communities.</b> Specifically, we analyze three primary challenges that researchers encounter: the heterogeneity of immigrant lives, adequate representations of <b>immigrant</b> <b>communities,</b> and researcher privilege. In addition to identifying these unique theoretical, methodological, and ethical concerns, we draw from critical theory, feminist scholarship, and cultural psychology to provide an interdisciplinary solution. For researchers investigating <b>immigrant</b> <b>communities,</b> we advocate the following: (a) grounding of intersectional frameworks; (b) reliance on a risk and resilience framework; (c) phenomenological understanding of immigrants' everyday lives; (d) inclusion of immigrant participants' voices; and (e) cultivation of negative capability. Finally, we briefly review selected studies that address three recurring challenges that researchers face and heed our five recommendations. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to measure the net {{propensity}} to live in isolation for Montréal’s main <b>immigrant</b> <b>communities</b> and to identify specific profiles that are particularly isolated. For that purpose, a statistical approach is used based on individual determinants to compute standardized isolation indexes that take into account the socioeconomic composition of the different groups. The models we developed also reveal how individuals’ characteristics, such as generational status, date of migration, education, language abilities or income, affect their residential isolation. Results reveal that many individual characteristics have strong impacts on residential isolation, and that those impacts are not always the same among <b>immigrant</b> <b>communities.</b> Also, the low propensity to live in isolation observed for all <b>immigrant</b> <b>communities</b> suggests that the place stratification model is probably not relevant to explain the residential dynamics of <b>immigrant</b> <b>communities</b> in Montréal. However, some vulnerable groups are much more likely to live in isolation: Haitian and South Asian with low education, low-income Maghrebis, and Filipinos who arrived via the Live-in Caregivers program. Some wealthy groups are also more isolated, such as Italians arrived before 1981. Therefore, considering this wide heterogeneity among <b>immigrant</b> <b>communities,</b> studies on their residential dynamic should not consider them as a whole...|$|R

40|$|This Honors thesis {{presents}} {{a review of}} the literature on the magnitude and impact of intimate partner violence (IPV) in Black <b>immigrant</b> <b>communities</b> in the U. S. I argue that IPV must be approached within an intersectional framework in order to account for the ways in which multidimensional identities and experiences occur in conjunction with abuse. The intersectional identities of Black Immigrant Women (BIW); as Black, foreign, and woman, render them essentially invisible in U. S. immigration discourse and especially vulnerable to IPV due to multifaceted layers of oppression as well as specific cultural and religious implications. This thesis first presents the demographic makeup of Black <b>immigrant</b> <b>communities</b> in the United States, noting push and pull factors for migration, educational and economic statistics, and a pattern of burgeoning pockets of specific Black immigrant ethnic groups. The following section provides statistics on the prevalence and scope of IPV in Black <b>immigrant</b> <b>communities</b> and throughout the world. I then present unique cultural and societal factors as challenges to addressing IPV among BIW including; risk factors for experiencing abuse such as changing gender and family roles, institutional racism, the process of acculturation as a result of migration, and the burden of cultural honor and responsibilities. In union with unique cultural and societal risk factors are barriers to help-seeking for BIW experiencing abuse. These barriers include prior dissatisfaction to help-seeking services, community pressure, the significance of marriage and honor in Black <b>immigrant</b> <b>communities,</b> and a lack of culturally specific care. Finally, I provide an implications section for social work practice, arguing for culturally relevant IPV interventions in Black <b>immigrant</b> <b>communities</b> from a macro, mezzo, and then micro scale. This includes greater community collaboration and engagement with Black <b>immigrant</b> <b>communities,</b> centering BIW’s voices, culturally relevant prevention and outreach efforts, collaborative and impactful research that is research practice, a re-framing of IPV within social work education, and ultimately, addressing IPV in Black <b>immigrant</b> <b>communities</b> from an intersectional framework at the macro, mezzo, and micro scale...|$|R
