[...] The elevation of precursors {{can be used to}} differentiate GALT deficiency from <b>galactokinase</b> deficiency, as Gal-1-P is typically not elevated in <b>galactokinase</b> deficiency.

50|$|In {{molecular}} biology, the GHMP kinase {{family is}} a family of kinase enzymes. Members of this family include homoserine kinases , <b>galactokinases</b> , and mevalonate kinases. These kinases make up the GHMP kinase superfamily of ATP-dependent enzymes. These enzymes {{are involved in the}} biosynthesis of isoprenes and amino acids as well as in carbohydrate metabolism. These enzymes contain, in their N-terminal section, a conserved Gly/Ser-rich region which is probably involved in the binding of ATP. The C-terminal domain of homoserine kinase has a central alpha-beta plait fold and an insertion of four helices, which, together with the N-terminal fold, creates a novel nucleotide binding fold.|$|R
30|$|Sugars are {{the main}} storage form of photosynthetically fixed carbon in plants. Levels of monosaccharides such as {{fructose}} and mannose declined in RP-I tissues as compared to RP-UI. However, at 48 hai, fructose and glucose levels went up in infested tissues as compared to un-infested tissues. The phosphorylated derivatives of hexoses (galactose and glucose) showed enhanced accumulation in infested tissue as compared to un-infested {{and so did the}} transcripts encoding for hexokinases and <b>galactokinases.</b> The levels of disaccharide sucrose and turanose declined in infested tissues as compared to un-infested tissues (Additional file 5 : Table S 2). A corresponding up-regulation of the transcripts encoding invertases, a class of enzyme that catalyzes the breakdown of sucrose to constituting monosaccharides, was observed. Trehalose, another disaccharide, showed elevated levels which was reflected in down-regulation of transcripts involved in trehalose metabolism. The levels of sugar alcohols such as sorbitol, arabinitol and myo-inositol decreased in host tissues upon gall midge challenge which is in line with the up-regulation of transcripts involved in minor CHO metabolism (Fig.  1, Additional file 6 : Table S 3).|$|R
40|$|Kinases that {{catalyze}} phosphorylation of sugars, called here sugar kinases, can {{be divided}} into at least three distinct nonhomologous families. The first is the hexokinase family, which contains many prokaryotic and eukaryotic sugar kinases with diverse specificities, including a new member, rhamnokinase from Salmonella typhimurium. The three-dimensional structure of hexokinase is known and can be used to build models of functionally important regions of other kinases in this family. The second is the ribokinase family, of unknown three-dimensional structure, and comprises pro- and eukaryotic ribokinases, bacterial fructokinases, the minor 6 -phosphofructokinase 2 from Escherichia coli, 6 -phosphotagatokinase, 1 -phosphofructokinase, and, possibly, inosine-guanosine kinase. The third family, also of unknown three-dimensional structure, contains several bacterial and yeast <b>galactokinases</b> and eukaryotic mevalonate and phosphomevalonate kinases and may have a substrate binding region in common with homoserine kinases. Each of the three families of sugar kinases appears to have a distinct three-dimensional fold, since conserved sequence patterns are strikingly different for the three families. Yet each catalyzes chemically equivalent reactions on similar or identical substrates. The enzymatic function of sugar phosphorylation appears to have evolved independently on the three distinct structural frameworks, by convergent evolution. In addition, evolutionary trees reveal that (1) fructokinase specificity has evolved independently in both the hexokinase and ribokinase families and (2) glucose specificity has evolved independently in different branches of the hexokinase family. These are examples of independent Darwinian adaptation of a structure to the same substrate at different evolutionary times. The flexible combination of active sites and three-dimensional folds observed in nature can be exploited by protein engineers in designing and optimizing enzymatic function...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Galactokinase</b> deficiency, {{also known}} as Galactosemia type 2 or GALK deficiency, is an {{autosomal}} recessive metabolic disorder marked by an accumulation of galactose and galactitol secondary to the decreased conversion of galactose to galactose-1-phosphate by <b>galactokinase.</b> The disorder is caused by mutations in the GALK1 gene, located on chromosome 17q24. [...] <b>Galactokinase</b> catalyzes {{the first step of}} galactose phosphorylation in the Leloir pathway of intermediate metabolism. <b>Galactokinase</b> deficiency is one of the three inborn errors of metabolism that lead to hypergalactosemia. The disorder is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. Unlike classic galactosemia, which is caused by deficiency of galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase, <b>galactokinase</b> deficiency does not present with severe manifestations in early infancy. Its major clinical symptom is the development of cataracts during the first weeks or months of life, {{as a result of the}} accumulation, in the lens, of galactitol, a product of an alternative route of galactose utilization. The development of early cataracts in homozygous affected infants is fully preventable through early diagnosis and treatment with a galactose-restricted diet. Some studies have suggested that, depending on milk consumption later in life, heterozygous carriers of <b>galactokinase</b> deficiency may be prone to presenile cataracts at 20-50 years of age.|$|E

50|$|The Leloir pathway catalyzes the {{conversion}} of galactose to glucose. Galactose is found in dairy products, {{as well as in}} fruits and vegetables, and can be produced endogenously in the breakdown of glycoproteins and glycolipids. Three enzymes are required in the Leloir pathway: <b>galactokinase,</b> galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase, and UDP-galactose 4-epimerase. <b>Galactokinase</b> catalyzes the first committed step of galactose catabolism, forming galactose 1-phosphate.|$|E
50|$|Interestingly, galactokinases across {{different}} species display a great diversity of substrate specificities. E. coli <b>galactokinase</b> can also phosphorylate 2-deoxy-D-galactose, 2-amino-deoxy-D-galactose, 3-deoxy-D-galactose and D-fucose. The enzyme cannot tolerate any C-4 modifications, but {{changes at the}} C-2 position of D-galactose do not interfere with enzyme function. Both human and rat galactokinases are also able to successfully phosphorylate 2-deoxy-D-galactose. <b>Galactokinase</b> from S. cerevisiae, on the other hand, is highly specific for D-galactose and cannot phosphorylate glucose, mannose, arabinose, fucose, lactose, galactitol, or 2-deoxy-D-galactose. Moreover, the kinetic properties of <b>galactokinase</b> also differ across species. The sugar specificity of galactokinases from different sources has been dramatically expanded through directed evolution and structure-based protein engineering. The corresponding broadly permissive sugar anomeric kinases serve as a cornerstone for in vitro and in vivo glycorandomization.|$|E
50|$|Galactosemia, a rare {{metabolic}} disorder characterized by decreased ability to metabolize galactose, {{can be caused}} by a mutation in any of the three enzymes in the Leloir pathway. <b>Galactokinase</b> deficiency, also known as galactosemia type II, is a recessive {{metabolic disorder}} caused by a mutation in human <b>galactokinase.</b> About 20 mutations have been identified that cause galactosemia type II, the main symptom of which is early onset cataracts. In lens cells of the human eye, aldose reductase converts galactose to galactitol. As galactose is not being catabolized to glucose due to a <b>galactokinase</b> mutation, galactitol accumulates. This galactitol gradient across the lens cell membrane triggers the osmotic uptake of water, and the swelling and eventual apoptosis of lens cells ensues.|$|E

5000|$|Recently, {{the roles}} of active site {{residues}} in human <b>galactokinase</b> have become understood. Asp-186 abstracts a proton from C1-OH of α-D-galactose, and the resulting alkoxide nucleophile attacks the γ-phosphorus of ATP. A phosphate group is transferred to the sugar, and Asp-186 may be deprotonated by water. Nearby Arg-37 stabilizes Asp-186 in its anionic form and has also been proven to be essential to <b>galactokinase</b> function in point mutation experiments. Both the aspartic acid and arginine active site residues are highly conserved among galactokinases.|$|E
50|$|<b>Galactokinase</b> is {{composed}} of two domains separated by a large cleft. The two regions are known as the N- and C-terminal domains, and the adenine ring of ATP binds in a hydrophobic pocket located at their interface. The N-terminal domain is marked by five strands of mixed beta-sheet and five alpha-helices, and the C-terminal domain is characterized by two layers of anti-parallel beta-sheets and six alpha-helices. <b>Galactokinase</b> {{does not belong to}} the sugar kinase family, but rather to a class of ATP-dependent enzymes known as the GHMP superfamily. GHMP is an abbreviation referring to its original members: <b>galactokinase,</b> homoserine kinase, mevalonate kinase, and phosphomevalonate kinase. Members of the GHMP superfamily have great three-dimensional similarity despite only ten to 20% sequence identity. These enzymes contain three well-conserved motifs (I, II, and III), the second of which is involved in nucleotide binding and has the sequence Pro-X-X-X-Gly-Leu-X-Ser-Ser-Ala.|$|E

50|$|Galactitol (dulcitol) is a sugar alcohol, the {{reduction}} product of galactose. In people with <b>galactokinase</b> deficiency, {{a form of}} galactosemia, excess dulcitol forms in {{the lens of the}} eye leading to cataracts.|$|E
50|$|However, {{closely related}} {{proteins}} {{do not always}} share the same function. For example, the yeast Gal1 and Gal3 proteins are paralogs (73% identity and 92% similarity) that have evolved very different functions with Gal1 being a <b>galactokinase</b> and Gal3 being a transcriptional inducer.|$|E
50|$|Unlike galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase deficiency, the {{symptoms}} of <b>galactokinase</b> deficiency are relatively mild. The only known symptom in affected children is the formation of cataracts, due to production of galactitol in {{the lens of the}} eye. Cataracts can present as a failure to develop a social smile and failure to visually track moving objects.|$|E
50|$|In nature, lactose {{is found}} {{primarily}} in milk and milk products. Consequently, various food products made with dairy-derived ingredients can contain lactose. Galactose metabolism, which converts galactose into glucose, {{is carried out}} by the three principal enzymes in a mechanism known as the Leloir pathway. The enzymes are listed in the order of the metabolic pathway: <b>galactokinase</b> (GALK), galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (GALT), and UDP-galactose-4’-epimerase (GALE).|$|E
50|$|In {{the first}} step, {{galactose}} mutarotase facilitates {{the conversion of}} β-D-galactose to α-D-galactose since this is the active form in the pathway. Next, α-D-galactose is phosphorylated by <b>galactokinase</b> to galactose 1-phosphate. In the third step, D-galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase converts galactose 1-phosphate to UDP-galactose using UDP-glucose as the uridine diphosphate source. Finally, UDP-galactose 4-epimerase recycles the UDP-galactose to UDP-glucose for the transferase reaction. Additionally, phosphoglucomutase converts the D-glucose 1-phosphate to D-glucose 6-phosphate.|$|E
50|$|The gal operon of E. coli {{consists}} of 3 structural genes: galE (epimerase), galT (galactose transferase), and galK (<b>galactokinase),</b> which are transcribed from two overlapping promoters PG1 and PG2 upstream from galE. Regulation of the operon is complex since the GalE product, an epimerase that converts UDP-glucose into UDP-galactose, {{is required for}} the formation of UDP-galactose for cell wall biosynthesis, in particular the cell wall component lipopolysaccharide, even when cells are not using galactose as a carbon/energy source.|$|E
50|$|<b>Galactokinase</b> {{deficiency}} is an {{autosomal recessive}} disorder, {{which means the}} defective gene responsible for the disorder is located on an autosome (chromosome 17 is an autosome), and two copies of the defective gene (one inherited from each parent) are {{required in order to}} be born with the disorder. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive disorder both carry one copy of the defective gene, but usually do not experience any signs or symptoms of the disorder.|$|E
50|$|Most {{infants with}} DG who are {{detected}} by NBS have their diagnosis confirmed {{in a follow-up}} evaluation. The differential diagnosis of a positive newborn screen for galactosemia includes: classic galactosemia, clinical variant galactosemia, DG, GALE (epimerase) deficiency, GALK (<b>galactokinase)</b> deficiency, or an initial false positive result. There are also other rare conditions, such as portosystemic venous shunting and hepatic arteriovenous malformations, or Fanconi-Bickel Syndrome (GSDXI) {{that can lead to}} elevated blood galactose or urinary galactitol, triggering an initial suspicion of galactosemia.|$|E
50|$|All three dietary monosaccharides are transported {{into the}} liver by the GLUT2 transporter. Fructose and {{galactose}} are phosphorylated {{in the liver}} by fructokinase (Km= 0.5 mM) and <b>galactokinase</b> (Km = 0.8 mM). By contrast, glucose tends {{to pass through the}} liver (Km of hepatic glucokinase = 10 mM) and can be metabolised anywhere in the body. Uptake of fructose by the liver is not regulated by insulin. However, insulin is capable of increasing the abundance and functional activity of GLUT5 in skeletal muscle cells.|$|E
50|$|GALE {{functions}} {{as one of}} four enzymes in the Leloir pathway of galactose conversion of glucose-1-phosphate. First, galactose mutarotase converts β-D-galactose to α-D-galactose. <b>Galactokinase</b> then phosphorylates α-D-galactose at the 1' hydroxyl group, yielding galactose-1-phosphate. In the third step, galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase catalyzes the reversible transfer of a UMP moiety from UDP-glucose to galactose-1-phosphate, generating UDP-galactose and glucose-1-phosphate. In the final Leloir step, UDP-glucose is regenerated from UDP-galactose by GALE; UDP-glucose cycles back to the third step of the pathway. As such, GALE regenerates a substrate necessary for continued Leloir pathway cycling.|$|E
50|$|Lactose is a {{disaccharide}} {{consisting of}} glucose and galactose. After the ingestion of lactose, most commonly from breast milk for an infant or cow milk and any milk from an animal,the enzyme lactase hydrolyzes the sugar into its monosaccharide constituents, glucose and galactose. In {{the first step}} of galactose metabolism, galactose is converted to galactose-1-phosphate (Gal-1-P) by the enzyme <b>galactokinase.</b> Gal-1-P is converted to uridine diphosphate galactose (UDP-galactose) by the enzyme galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase, with UDP-glucose acting as the UDP donor. UDP-galactose can then be converted to lactose, by the enzyme lactose synthase or to UDP-glucose by UDP-galactose epimerase (GALE).|$|E
50|$|Galactosemia {{is caused}} by {{mutations}} in the gene that makes the enzyme galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase. Approximately 70% of galactosemia-causing alleles have a single missense mutation in exon 6. A milder form of galactosemia, called <b>Galactokinase</b> deficiency, is caused a lack of the enzyme uridine diphosphate galactose-4-epimerase which breaks down a byproduct of galactose. This type of is associated with cataracts, but does not cause growth failure, mental retardation, or hepatic disease. Dietary reduction of galactose is also the treatment but not as severe as in patients with classical galactosemia. This deficiency can be systemic or limited to red blood cells and leukocytes.|$|E
5000|$|The exact enzyme {{apparatus}} of mevalonate diphosphate decarboxylase {{is not completely}} understood. Structures of both the yeast and human mevalonate diphosphate decarboxylase have been solved with X-ray crystallography, but scientists have experienced difficulties in obtaining structures of bound metabolites. Scientists have classified mevalonate diphosphate decarboxylase as an enzyme in the GHMP kinase family (<b>galactokinase,</b> homoserine kinase, mevalonate kinase, and phosphomevalonate kinase). [...] Both mevalonate kinase and mevalonate diphosphate decarboxylase probably evolved from a common ancestor since they have a similar fold and catalyze phosphorylation of similar substrates. [...] Due to these commonalities, both enzymes are often studied comparatively, and especially in reference to inhibitors.|$|E
5000|$|In undiagnosed and {{untreated}} children, {{the accumulation}} of precursor metabolites due to the deficient activity of galactose 1-phosphate uridylyltransferase (GALT) can lead to feeding problems, failure to thrive, liver damage, bleeding, and infections. The first presenting symptom in an infant is often prolonged jaundice. Without intervention {{in the form of}} galactose restriction, infants can develop hyperammonemia and sepsis, possibly leading to shock. The accumulation of galactitol and subsequent osmotic swelling can lead to cataracts which are similar to those seen in <b>galactokinase</b> deficiency. [...] Long-term consequences of continued galactose intake can include developmental delay, developmental verbal dyspraxia, and motor abnormalities. Galactosemic females frequently suffer from ovarian failure, regardless of treatment in the form of galactose restriction.|$|E
50|$|The main pathway of {{galactose}} metabolism is the Leloir pathway; {{humans and}} other species, however, {{have been noted}} to contain several alternate pathways, such as the De Ley Doudoroff pathway. The Leloir pathway consists of the latter stage of a two-part process that converts β-D-galactose to UDP-glucose. The initial stage is the conversion of β-D-galactose to α-D-galactose by the enzyme, mutarotase (GALM). The Leloir pathway then carries out the conversion of α-D-galactose to UDP-glucose via three principal enzymes: <b>Galactokinase</b> (GALK) phosphorylates α-D-galactose to galactose-1-phosphate, or Gal-1-P; Galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (GALT) transfers a UMP group from UDP-glucose to Gal-1-P to form UDP-galactose; and finally, UDP galactose-4’-epimerase (GALE) interconverts UDP-galactose and UDP-glucose, thereby completing the pathway.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Galactokinase</b> (GALK) deficiency, or Type II galactosemia, {{is also a}} rare (1 in 100,000 live births), {{autosomal}} recessive disease that leads to variable <b>galactokinase</b> activity levels: ranging from high GALK efficiency to undetectably-low GALK efficiency. The early onset of cataract is the main clinical manifestation of Type II galactosemics, most likely due to the high concentration of galactitol found in this population. GALK deficient patients exposed to high-galactose diets show extreme levels of galactitol in blood and urine. Studies on galactokinase-deficient patients have shown that nearly two-thirds of ingested galactose can {{be accounted for by}} galactose and galactitol levels in the urine. Urinary levels of galactitol in these subjects approach 2500 mmol/mol creatine as compared to 2 to 78 mmol/mol creatine in control patients.A decrease in activity in the third major enzymes of galactose metabolism, UDP galactose-4'-epimerase (GALE), is the cause of Type III galactosemia. GALE deficiency is an extremely rare, {{autosomal recessive}} disease that appears to be most common among the Japanese population (1 in 23,000 live births among Japanese population). While the link between GALE deficiency and cataract prevalence seems to be ambiguous, experiments on this topic have been conducted. A recent 2000 study in Munich, Germany analyzed the activity levels of the GALE enzyme in various tissues and cells in patients with cataract. The experiment concluded that while patients with cataract seldom exhibited an acute decrease in GALE activity in blood cells, [...] "the GALE activity in the lens of cataract patients was, on the other hand, significantly decreased". The study's results are depicted below. The extreme decrease in GALE activity in the lens of cataract patients seems to suggest an irrefutable connection between Type III galactosemia and cataract development.|$|E
50|$|Galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase deficiency, {{also called}} {{galactosemia}} type 1, classic galactosemia or GALT deficiency, {{is the most}} common type of galactosemia, an inborn error of galactose metabolism, caused by a deficiency of the enzyme galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase. It is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder that can cause liver disease and death if untreated. Treatment of galactosemia is most successful if initiated early and includes dietary restriction of lactose intake. Because early intervention is key, galactosemia is included in newborn screening programs in many areas. On initial screening, which often involves measuring the concentration of galactose in blood, classic galactosemia may be indistinguishable from other inborn errors of galactose metabolism, including <b>galactokinase</b> deficiency and galactose epimerase deficiency. Further analysis of metabolites and enzyme activities are needed to identify the specific metabolic error.|$|E
