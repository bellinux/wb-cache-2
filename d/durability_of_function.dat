40|$|Purpose. Comparative {{studies of}} the {{photosynthetic}} apparatus of winter wheat varieties of modern and earlier breeding in the relation to their productivity. Methods. Field, pot experiment, biometrical, gas analysis, analytical and statistical ones. Results. It is found that the modern high-yielding winter wheat varieties have {{a higher rate of}} flag leaf photosynthesis during generative period of development, particularly at grain filling period, improved ability to store assimilates in stem and effectively use them later for grain growth. The modern varieties form crop canopy with greater leaf area and chlorophyll indexes and larger photosynthetic capacity and maintain functional activity of photosynthetic apparatus longer {{at the end of the}} growing season. Conclusions. The superiority for grain productivity of modern high-yielding wheat varieties, originated from the Institute of Plant Physio­logy and Genetics, NAS of Ukraine, over varieties released before the “green revolution”, results from increased capacity and <b>durability</b> <b>of</b> <b>functioning</b> the crop photosynthetic apparatus, higher CO 2 assimilation rate and optimization of source-sink relations in whole plant...|$|R

At 108 extracted teeth examined quality of fit of the seal and microstructure of interaction of adhesive and hard tissues of the tooth dentin with varying humidity and, depending on the type of solvent adhesive systems. Found that the need for a differentiated approach to the choice of the parameter humidity dentin cavity at a choice of different adhesive systems. And evaluation of regional penetration of the dye on the boundary of the "tooth-filling" and the study of the architectonics of adhesive bonds at the microstructural level, showed that 19. 7 % of the most moisture is indicated for use of adhesive systems with an aqueous solvent, 20. 0 % - from ethanol and 20. 3 % - with acetone solvent.

Abstract: Assessment <b>of</b> {{the structure}} <b>durability</b> <b>of</b> concrete bridge in service {{is crucial for}} determining whether their service performance is meeting the design requirements or not.

40|$|Understanding {{the factors}} driving {{pathogen}} emergence and re-emergence {{is a major}} challenge, particularly in agriculture, where the use of resistant plant cultivars imposes strong selective pressures on plant pathogen populations and leads frequently to 'resistance breakdown'. Presently, durable resistances are only identified after {{a long period of}} large-scale cultivation of resistant cultivars. We propose a new predictor <b>of</b> the <b>durability</b> <b>of</b> plant resistance. Because resistance breakdown involves modifications in the avirulence factors of pathogens, we tested for correlations between the evolutionary constraints acting on avirulence factors or their diversity and the <b>durability</b> <b>of</b> the corresponding resistance genes in the case of plant–virus interactions. An analysis performed on 20 virus species–resistance gene combinations revealed that the selective constraints applied on amino acid substitutions in virus avirulence factors correlate with the observed <b>durability</b> <b>of</b> the corresponding resistance genes. On the basis of this result, a model predicting the potential <b>durability</b> <b>of</b> resistance genes as a <b>function</b> <b>of</b> the selective constraints applied on the corresponding avirulence factors is proposed to help breeders to select the most durable resistance gene...|$|R

To this end, we directly compared formation and <b>functions</b> <b>of</b> tissue-engineered blood vessels generated by peripheral blood– and umbilical cord blood–derived EPCs in a model of in vivo vasculogenesis. We found that adult peripheral blood EPCs form blood vessels that are unstable and regress within 3 weeks. In contrast, umbilical cord blood EPCs form normal-functioning blood vessels that last for more than 4 months. These vessels exhibit normal blood flow, perm-selectivity to macromolecules, and induction of leukocyte-endothelial interactions in response to cytokine activation similar to normal vessels. Thus, umbilical cord blood EPCs hold great therapeutic potential, and their use should be pursued for vascular engineering...|$|R

However, in order to compete within the most attractive markets, the PEMFC technologies did not reach all the required characteristics yet, in particular in terms <b>of</b> cost and <b>durability.</b> Because <b>of</b> the strong coupling between different physicochemical phenomena, the interpretation of experimental observations is difficult, and analysis through modeling becomes crucial to elucidate the degradation and failure mechanisms, andto help improving both PEMFC electrochemical performance and <b>durability.</b> The development <b>of</b> a theoretical tool is essential for industrials and the scientific community to evaluate the PEMFC degradation and to predict itsperformance and <b>durability</b> in <b>function</b> <b>of</b> the materials properties and in a diversity of operating conditions.

The {{results show that}} inclusion of fines improves CSC compressive strength and reduces frost <b>durability</b> <b>of</b> C 30 CSC when fines content reaches 10 %, whereas it has little negative influence on frost <b>durability</b> <b>of</b> C 60 CSC. Increasing MB value does not negatively affect compressive strength of C 30 CSC but decreases compressive strength of C 60 CSC and frost <b>durability</b> <b>of</b> CSC, and the reduction is more pronounced when MB value exceeds 1. 0. Lithology has no prominent influence on frost durability and compressive strength of CSC within the lithologies (dolomite, limestone, granite, basalt, and quartz) studied.
