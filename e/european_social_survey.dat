We used {{information from the}} <b>European</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Surveys</b> (20022008) on 19, 210 immigrants from 123 countries of origin, living in 31 European countries. Cross-classified multilevel regression analyses reveal that political suppression in the origin country and living in countries {{with large numbers of}} immigrant peers have a detrimental influence on immigrants health. Originating from predominantly Islamic countries and good average health among natives in the destination country appear to be beneficial.

40|$|European {{citizens}} are largely unfavourable to immigration. These restrictive attitudes {{are linked to}} such factors as the unemployment rate and risk of poverty, {{as well as to}} competition for employment and welfare resources. Refuting insider/outsider theories, this article shows, via an analysis of recent <b>European</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Surveys,</b> that national <b>social</b> protection policies can reduce hostility towards immigration, insofar as they moderate social inequality and the risk of poverty. Ethnic and racial differences are problematic for the ‘egalitarian compromise’ underpinning the welfare state. Nonetheless, strong trade unions and social protection policies are associated with greater integration of immigrants. Over time, the future sustainability of welfare systems may depend on the participation of immigrants as a political force, making their integration even more important...|$|R

40|$|The {{study of}} {{inequality}} in health concerns {{the relationship between}} socially structured characteristics and health outcomes. Howewer, health disparities are also linked to purely individual characteristics and contextual ones. In particular, the contextual effect at a national level may reflect differences in the functioning and performing of national health institutions, that may be conceived as further determinants of health inequalities. In this work we aim at estimating the effect of education on self-assessed health across European countries, taking into account potential confounders like age, gender and family social background. Using a multilevel model with individuals nested in countries, we can achieve two aims. First, we can see whether countries differ in their average self-assessed health score. Second, we can test our hypothesis {{about the existence of}} a <b>European</b> <b>social</b> gradient, that is that education exerts a relatively constant effect on self-assessed health.

40|$|Using {{data from}} five <b>European</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Surveys</b> the study focuses on labor force {{incorporation}} of sub-groups of immigrants in 10 West-European countries. Whereas the analysis reveals that rate of labor force activity among first-generation immigrants {{is lower than}} that of comparable native-born populations regardless of ethnicity or gender, meaningful differences across sub-groups of second-generation immigrants are observed. Second-generation male and female immigrants of European origin achieve parity with native-born Europeans in rate of participation; by contrast, second-generation immigrant men and women of non-European origin and of the Muslim faith are less likely to become economically active than comparable Europeans.

40|$|In {{the present}} study, the authors examine {{the extent to}} which effects of {{individual}} religious involvement on self-assessed health are influenced by the religious context (i. e., religious involvement at the country level). The authors test their expectations using individual level data (N = 127, 257) on 28 countries from the <b>European</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Surveys</b> (2002 - 2008). Results of multilevel analyses show that individual religious attendance is positively related to self-assessed health in Europe. Protestants appear to feel healthier than Catholics. Moreover, modeling cross-level interactions demonstrates that religious denominations at the national level are influential: The health advantage of Protestants as compared to Catholics is greater as the percentage of Protestants in a country is higher, yet smaller as countries have a higher percentage of Catholics. The association between religious attendance and self-assessed health does not depend on the national level of religious attendance...|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} support for radical left ideologies in 32 European countries. It thus extends the relatively scant empirical research available in this field. The hypotheses tested are derived mainly from group-interest theory. Data are deployed from the 2002 - 2010 <b>European</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Surveys</b> (N = 174, 868), supplemented by characteristics {{at the country}} level. The results show that, also in the new millennium, unemployed people and those with a lower income {{are more likely to}} support a radical left ideology. This is only partly explained by their stronger opinion that governments should take measures to reduce income differences. In contrast to expectations, the findings show that greater income inequality within a country is associated with reduced likelihood of an individual supporting a radical left ideology. Furthermore, cross-national differences in the likelihood of supporting the radical left are strongly associated with whether a country has a legacy of an authoritarian regime...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{research}} shows {{that even though the}} lower educated run a relatively high risk to be in poor health, there is ample cross-national variation in the disparity between educational groups in having poor health. Explanations for these differences between countries are, however, rather scarce. We set out to address this lacuna by investigating the extent to which cross-national variation in the health gap between the lower and higher educated in Europe can be explained by a country’s governmental health expenditures and cyclical and structural labour market conditions. We used information from the <b>European</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Surveys</b> 2002 - 2008 on approximately 91000 individuals in 32 European nations, and estimated random slope multilevel models with cross-level interactions to empirically test our hypotheses. We find that the health gap between the lower educated and the higher educated is smaller in countries with higher levels of governmental health expenditure, and with a highly modernized labour market...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{reactions}} to the large demographic changes in Europe due to migration has been the rise of radical right-wing parties.

By pooling the <b>European</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Surveys</b> from 2002, 2004, 2006 and 2008, we test Europe-wide the extent to which ideological and protest explanations of radical right-wing voting differ between higher and lower educated people. Generally, the lower educated base their choice for the radical right less on ideological attitudes and political distrust than the higher educated. The lower educated who do not support the core ideology of the radical right are still relatively likely to vote the radical right. Our findings have strong implications for understanding why lower social strata vote for the radical right; we need to develop alternative explanations for why lower educated people who do not support radical right ideologies still vote for these parties...|$|R

40|$|In this work, we {{perform the}} {{clustering}} of European regions, {{based on their}} citizens’ political interests and electoral participation, as expressed in data from the two most recent <b>European</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Surveys</b> (ESS) - 2012 (round 6) and 2014 (round 7). We resort to a new clustering approach, named EM-MML, which clusters categorical data and simultaneously determines the number of clusters. Clustering is applied to sets of questions referring to whether the citizens were involved in “different ways of trying to improve things in their country or help prevent things from going wrong” – e. g., signed a petition or worked in a political organisation or association. The results of the EM-MML approach are compared with results from the classical EM approach combined with several information criteria. EM-MML approach provides more parsimonious and robust solutions than those obtained by standard EM {{and it is also}} faster than the other methods considered, which is especially relevant when dealing with large data sets.

40|$|In this study, {{we examine}} {{to what extent}} childlessness is {{associated}} with poor psychological well-being in Europe. Moreover, we examine whether the relationship between childlessness and psychological well-being varies between 24 European countries. Additionally, we investigate to what extent societal norms towards childlessness and social contacts {{at the national level}} account for these cross-national variations. Information on 24, 195 individuals aged over 40 years is analyzed, using the third wave of the <b>European</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Surveys</b> (2006). A validated shortened version of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale is used to measure psychological well-being. Using multilevel regression analyses, we found that the extent to which childlessness is associated with worse psychological well-being differs between European societies, especially among women. The disadvantage in psychological well-being of childless people is smaller in countries with tolerant norms towards childlessness and high levels of social contacts. The results suggest that the extent to which childlessness is associated with lower psychological well-being appears to be dependent on the societal context...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{we set out}} {{to explain}} extreme left-wing and extreme right-wing {{ideologies}} within and between 30 European countries in a multi-level framework. To test our hypotheses, we use data from the <b>European</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Surveys</b> of 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008 and 2010 (N = 176. 803), enriched with country characteristics. Our results show that lower educated people and manual workers are more likely to support left-wing extremism, because they are of the opinion that the government should take measures to reduce differences in income levels. Interestingly, the lower educated and manual workers {{are also more likely to}} have an extreme right-wing ideology. This effect, however, is explained by a higher level of perceived ethnic threat. At the country-level, our analyses indicate that a heritage of a totalitarian regime increases the likelihood for an individual to hold an extreme left-wing and extreme right-wing ideology. Moreover, we found a positive effect of the percentage of unemployed people in a country on the probability to support left-wing extremism...|$|R

40|$|A recent large Canadian survey permits us {{to compare}} {{face-to-face}} (‘real-life’) and on-line social networks {{as sources of}} subjective well-being. The sample of 5, 000 is drawn randomly from an on-line pool of respondents, a group well placed to have and value on-line friendships. We find three key results. First, the number of real-life friends is positively correlated with subjective well-being (SWB) even after controlling for income, demographic variables and personality differences. Doubling the number of friends in real life has an equivalent effect on well-being as a 50 % increase in income. Second, the size of online networks is largely uncorrelated with subjective well-being. Third, we find that real-life friends are much more important {{for people who are}} single, divorced, separated or widowed than they are for people who are married or living with a partner. Findings from large international <b>surveys</b> (the <b>European</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Surveys</b> 2002 – 2008) are used to confirm the importance of real-life social networks to SWB; they also indicate a significantly smaller value of social networks to married or partnered couples...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{analyses}} six {{rounds of}} the <b>European</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Surveys</b> (from 2000 to 2012) to explore how 1) media uses, 2) unconventional and 3) conventional (i. e. voting) forms of political participation have changed in sixteen European countries.

The level of digitization in each country is assessed according to its infrastructure, the legal framework (namely the Freedom of Information Act), the quality of the data available from the public administration, and e-government development in terms of online services. The research question is whether use of the Internet and the level of national digitization affect unconventional forms of political participation.

40|$|Most of the {{empirical}} literature on party membership {{has focused on}} the decline of national party membership figures across Europe (Mair and Van Biezen, 2001; Weldon, 2006; Van Biezen et al. 2012). However, when disaggregating the figures at the party level, the trends are far less linear (Delwit 2011, Kolln 2014). Not all parties have been affected by membership decline and some parties have managed to continuously increased their membership base. Besides, many parties have attempted to attract new members by easing their affiliation rules and engaging in processes of intra-party democracy reforms. Yet, today, we still know very little on how internal party factors impact on membership recruitment patterns. This paper investigates this relationship across 30 parties in six European countries. Using a Crisp Set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) relying on data collected in the framework of the Members and Activist of Political Parties (MAPP) project, the Political Party Database (PPDB) and the <b>European</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Surveys</b> (ESS), it shows that parties' internal reforms do have an impact on their ability to attract new members and on the degree of activism of the members that they recruit. info:eu-repo/semantics/nonPublishe...|$|R
