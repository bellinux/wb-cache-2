5000|$|Sydney Chapman gave {{a correct}} {{description}} {{of the source of}} stratospheric ozone and its ability to generate heat within the stratosphere; he also wrote that ozone may be destroyed by reacting with atomic oxygen, making two molecules of molecular oxygen. We now know that there are additional ozone loss mechanisms, and that these mechanisms are catalytic meaning that a small amount of the catalyst can destroy a great number of ozone molecules. The first is due to the reaction of hydroxyl radicals OH· with ozone. OH is formed by the reaction of <b>electronically</b> <b>excited</b> <b>oxygen</b> atoms produced by ozone photolysis, with water vapor. While the stratosphere is dry, additional water vapor is produced in situ by the photochemical oxidation of methane (CH4). The HO2 radical produced by the reaction of OH with O3 is recycled to OH by reaction with oxygen atoms or ozone. In addition, solar proton events can significantly effect ozone levels via Radiolysis with the subsequent formation of OH [...] Laughing gas or Nitrous oxide (N2O) is produced by biological activity at the surface and is oxidised to NO in the stratosphere; the so-called NOx radical cycles also deplete stratospheric ozone. Finally, chlorofluorocarbon molecules are photolysed in the stratosphere releasing chlorine atoms that react with ozone giving ClO and O2. The chlorine atoms are recycled when ClO reacts with O in the upper stratosphere, or when ClO reacts with itself in the chemistry of the Antarctic ozone hole. Paul J. Crutzen, Mario J. Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1995 for their work describing the formation and decomposition of stratospheric ozone.|$|E

40|$|Neutrophil leukocytes {{protect against}} a varied and complex array of {{microbes}} by providing microbicidal action that is simple, potent, and focused. Neutrophils provide such action via redox reactions {{that change the}} frontier orbitals of oxygen (O 2) facilitating combustion. The spin conservation rules define the symmetry barrier that prevents direct reaction of diradical O 2 with nonradical molecules, explaining why combustion is not spontaneous. In burning, the spin barrier is overcome when energy causes homolytic bond cleavage producing radicals capable of reacting with diradical O 2 to yield oxygenated radical products that further participate in reactive propagation. Neutrophil mediated combustion is by a different pathway. Changing the spin quantum state of O 2 removes the symmetry restriction to reaction. <b>Electronically</b> <b>excited</b> singlet molecular <b>oxygen</b> (O 2 * 1) is a potent electrophilic reactant with a finite lifetime that restricts its radius of reactivity and focuses combustive action on the target microbe.

40|$|The {{contribution}} of atmospherically persistent (long-lived) greenhouse gases to the radiative forcing of Earth has {{increased over the}} past several decades. The impact of highly fluorinated saturated compounds, in particular perfluorinated compounds, on climate change is a concern because of their long atmospheric lifetimes, which are primarily determined by stratospheric loss processes, as well as their strong absorption in the infrared "window" region. A potentially key stratospheric loss process for these compounds is their gas-phase reaction with <b>electronically</b> <b>excited</b> <b>oxygen</b> atoms, O(1 D). Therefore, accurate reaction rate coefficient data is desired for input to climate change models. In this work, rate coefficients, k, were measured for the reaction of O(1 D) with several key long-lived greenhouse gases, namely NF 3, SF 5 CF 3, CHF 3 (HFC- 23), C 2 F 6, c-C 4 F 8, n -C 5 F 12, and n -C 6 F 14. Room temperature rate coefficients for the total reaction, k Tot, corresponding to loss of O(1 D), and reactive channel, k R, corresponding to the loss of the reactant compound, were measured for NF 3 and SF 5 CF 3 using competitive reaction and relative rate methods, respectively. k R was measured for the CHF 3 reaction and improved upper-limits were determined for the perfluorinated compounds included in this study. For NF 3, k Tot was determined to be (2. 55 ± 0. 38) × 10 − 11 cm 3 molecule − 1 s − 1 and k R, which was measured using CF 3 Cl, N 2 O, CF 2 ClCF 2 Cl (CFC- 114), and CF 3 CFCl 2 (CFC- 114 a) as reference compounds, was determined to be (2. 21 ± 0. 33) × 10 − 11 cm 3 molecule − 1 s − 1 corresponding to a reactive branching ratio of 0. 87 ± 0. 13. For SF 5 CF 3, k Tot = (3. 24 ± 0. 50) × 10 − 13 cm 3 molecule − 1 s − 1 and k R − 14 cm 3 molecule − 1 s − 1 were measured, where k R is a factor of three lower than the current recommendation of k Tot for use in atmospheric modeling. For CHF 3, k R was determined to be (2. 35 ± 0. 35) × 10 − 12 cm 3 molecule − 1 s − 1, which corresponds to a reactive channel yield of 0. 26 ± 0. 04, and resolves a large discrepancy among previously reported values.

The generation of the atomic species in the different electronic states {{was carried out by}} primary excitation of precursor molecules with UV radiation at varying wavelengths, while the high-energy VUV probe radiation originates from a laserproduced plasma (LPP). Speciﬁcally, the following results were achieved: In photoionization experiments on CS 2, S 2 O isoxazole, 1, 2, 5 -oxadiazole, and 1, 2, 5 -thiadiazole the photoionization properties of these molecules were investigated and the appearance energies of the ionic fragments were used to derive heats of formation and dissociation energies. <b>Electronically</b> <b>excited</b> atomic <b>oxygen</b> O(1 D) was photoioized in the photon energy range from 17 to 27 eV. A broad and intense autoionization resonance, which has been predicted by theoretical work, was observed experimentally for the ﬁrst time. It is assigned to a 2 p 4 1 D → 2 s 1 2 p 5 1 P o excitation with subsequent autoionisation. The intense Coster-Kronig resonance appears redshifted by about 650 meV relatively to the theoretical results, but is otherwise in full agreement. The photodissociation of CS 2 at an excitation wavelength of 193 nm was performed and the formed neutral photo fragments were ionized in the photon energy range between 9. 25 and 30 eV. The photoion yield of atomic sulfur in {{the electronic}} states S(3 P) and S(1 D) was investigated in the photon energy range up to 30 eV and both sulfur species could be clearly identiﬁed on the basis of autoionizing Rydberg resonances. The photoion yield of S(3 P) was recorded in the energy regime from threshold up to 30 eV to be able to eliminate contributions from S(3 P) from the previously mentioned photoion yield curves of S +. The production of atomic triplet sulfur S(3 P) was achieved by photodissociation of S 2 O. Values for the absolute photoionization cross section of S(3 P) were proposed with the help of preliminary theoretical data. The photoion yield curve of <b>electronically</b> <b>excited</b> atomic Sulfur S(1 D) was obtained for the ﬁrst time up to 30 eV by subtracting the contributions of S(3 P) from the afore mentioned experiments on CS 2.
