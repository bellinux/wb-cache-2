40|$|The {{interpretation}} of <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> data at low magnetic latitudes {{is difficult because}} the vector nature of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> increases the complexity of anomalies from magnetic rocks. The most obvious approach to this problem {{is to reduce the}} data to the <b>magnetic</b> <b>pole,</b> where the presumably vertical magnetization vector will simplify observed anomalies. However, RTP requires special treatment of North-South features in data observed in low magnetic latitudes due to high amplitude corrections of these features. Furthermore, RTP requires the assumption of induced magnetization with the result that anomalies from remanently and anisotropically magnetized bodies can be severely distorted. The amplitude of the 3 -D analytic signal of the total <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> produces maxima over magnetic contacts regardless of the direction of magnetization.

The conceptual physics curriculum will be applicable for any quarter in the Freshman science curriculum and will require no prior science background. A text book will not be necessary but conceptual physics or a high school level physical science book would be an appropriate accompaniment for the curriculum. Students must have completed or be concurrently taking a course in algebra. There are three units in the curriculum. The first is mechanics and motion. It includes speed, velocity, acceleration, Mass vs. weight, then Newtons three laws of motion, momentum and energy. The second unit of the curriculum is Electricity and Magnetism. Electrostatic charge, conductors, insulators, charge by contact, charge by induction and the Van de Graaff generator will be topics included under electricity. Magnetism topics will be <b>magnetic</b> force, <b>magnetic</b> <b>poles,</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> and electromagnets. The third unit is Light.

This paper proposes a novel mathematic modeling method based on equivalent energized coil and Biot-Savart law to formulate the complex <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> distribution in three-dimensional (3 D) space. The energized coil model is employed as an equivalent substitution of cylindrical permanent magnet (PM) <b>poles.</b> The <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> distribution of single energized coil is then formulated analytically. The complete <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> model of the actuator with multiple cylindrical PM poles is thus achieved from linear superpositions. Compared with other conventional approaches, as there are no omission of high order of harmonic terms, shape approximation of magnet poles and assumption of evenly distributed flux field, it helps to improve the modeling accuracy. Furthermore, this method is more generic for other flux field applications. It is available for both PM and EM poles, and theoretically could be implemented for other magnet shapes. The computational time may increase for complex magnet shapes and distribution patterns. The proposed method {{is applied to the}} spherical actuator with novel 3 D <b>magnetic</b> <b>pole</b> array that helps to improve the actuator torque output. Numerical computation is conducted to validate the derived analytical <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> model. It shows that the analytical model fits with the result from finite element method (FEM) closely. A research prototype and an automatic experimental platform have been developed. Experiment is thus conducted to measure the <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> distribution of the spherical actuator. The data comparison shows that the analytical model matches the experimental measurement result well.

Since each field line generally begins at a north <b>magnetic</b> <b>pole</b> and ends at a south <b>magnetic</b> <b>pole,</b> the most general way of dividing simple flux systems involves four domains separated by two separatrices: one separatrix surface divides the flux into two bundles, each of which shares a south pole, and the other separatrix surface divides the flux into two bundles, each of which shares a north pole. The intersection of the separatrices forms a separator, a single line that is at the boundary of the four separate domains. In separator reconnection, field lines enter the separator from two of the domains, and are spliced one to the other, exiting the separator in the other two domains (see the figure).|$|R

The particles were also found to align {{in the direction of the}} field and hence in a direction perpendicular to the field gradient. Upon aggregation the new entity continued to move along the direction of the field gradient, but at a velocity distinctly higher than that of the aggregating units. When further aggregation occurred the entity increased to an even higher velocity, though the rate of increase in the velocity decreased, leading to an asymptotic velocity for very large aggregates. This behaviour was examined for spherical particles of different diameter and for rod shaped particles. This work shows the effective magnetisation of the iron particles is governed by the aspect ratio of the particles, indeed the mass distribution of the particles within the <b>magnetic</b> <b>field...</b>|$|R
