5|$|In human anatomy, a bursa {{is a small}} pouch {{filled with}} {{synovial}} fluid. Its purpose is to reduce friction between adjacent structures. The prepatellar bursa {{is one of several}} bursae of the knee joint, and is located between the patella and the skin. Prepatellar bursitis is an inflammation of this bursa. Bursae are readily inflamed when irritated, as their walls are very thin. Along with the pes anserine bursa, the prepatellar bursa {{is one of the most}} common bursae to cause <b>knee</b> <b>pain</b> when inflamed.|$|E

5|$|There {{are several}} types of {{inflammation}} that can cause <b>knee</b> <b>pain,</b> including sprains, bursitis, and injuries to the meniscus. A diagnosis of prepatellar bursitis can be made based on a physical examination {{and the presence of}} risk factors in the person's medical history; swelling and tenderness {{at the front of the}} knee, combined with a profession that requires frequent kneeling, suggest prepatellar bursitis. Swelling of multiple joints along with restricted range of motion may indicate arthritis instead.|$|E
40|$|Objective <b>Knee</b> joint <b>pain</b> {{and reduced}} {{quadriceps}} strength are cardinal symptoms in many knee pathologies. In people with painful knee pathologies, quadriceps exercise reduces pain, improves physical function, and increases muscle strength.

This study evaluated the effects of experimental <b>knee</b> joint <b>pain</b> during quadriceps strength training on muscle strength gain in healthy individuals...|$|R
40|$|Background and Purpose: Gait {{properties}} {{change with}} age {{because of a}} decrease in lower limb strength and visual acuity or knee joint disorders. Gait changes commonly result from these combined factors. This study aimed {{to examine the effects}} of knee extension strength, visual acuity, and <b>knee</b> joint <b>pain</b> on gait properties of for 181 healthy female older adults (age: 76. 1 (5. 7) years). Methods: Walking speed, cadence, stance time, swing time, double support time, step length, step width, walking angle, and toe angle were selected as gait parameters. Knee extension strength was measured by isometric dynamometry; and decreased visual acuity and <b>knee</b> joint <b>pain</b> were evaluated by subjective judgment whether or not such factors created a hindrance during walking. Results: Among older adults without vision problems and <b>knee</b> joint <b>pain</b> that affected walking, those with superior knee extension strength had signifi cantly greater walking speed and step length than those with inferior knee extension strength (P <. 05). Persons with visual acuity problems had higher cadence and shorter stance time. In addition, persons with <b>pain</b> in both <b>knees</b> showed slower walking speed and longer stance time and double support time. Conclusion: A decrease of knee extension strength and visual acuity and <b>knee</b> joint <b>pain</b> are factors affecting gait in the female older adults. Decreased knee extension strength and <b>knee</b> joint <b>pain</b> mainly affect respective distance and time parameters of the gait. © 2014 The Academy of Geriatric Physical Therapy of the American Physical Therapy Association.

25|$|Different implant {{manufacturers}} require {{slightly different}} instrumentation and technique. No consensus has emerged over {{which one is}} the best. Clinical studies {{are very difficult to}} perform, requiring large numbers of cases followed over many years. The most significant variations are between cemented and uncemented components and between resurfacing the patella or not. Among those who do not resurface the patella, there is also variation between denervating the patella using electrocautery or not. In theory, this technique could disrupt the superficial pain receptors near the patella in hopes of relieving anterior <b>knee</b> <b>pain,</b> a common post-operative complaint. No consensus exists, but a recent randomized controlled trial indicates that while both methods provide relief, patellar denervation results in a modest benefit compared to no denervation in the short-term. The patient satisfaction was higher with more number of patients rating the procedure as excellent in the denervation group (74.6% vs 50.8%). The benefit does not, however, persist mid- to long-term post-operatively. Anterior <b>knee</b> <b>pain</b> component within the patellar score and Visual Analogue Scale for anterior <b>knee</b> <b>pain</b> were significantly better in the denervation group at 3 months (4.5 vs 5.1) but not at 12 months (4.4 vs 4.9) and 24 months (2.1 vs. 2.2).|$|E

25|$|Acupuncture {{is a form}} of {{alternative}} medicine. It is used most commonly for pain relief, though it is also used to treat a wide range of conditions.

For example, American Society of Anesthesiologists states it may be considered in the treatment for nonspecific, noninflammatory low back pain only in conjunction with conventional therapy.|$|E
50|$|Following the fever, strong {{joint pain}} or {{stiffness}} occurs; it usually lasts weeks or months, but may last for years. The joint pain can be debilitating, often resulting in near immobility {{of the affected}} joints. Joint pain is reported in 87-98% of cases, and nearly always occurs {{in more than one}} joint, though joint swelling is uncommon. Typically the affected joints are located in both arms and legs, and are affected symmetrically. Joints {{are more likely to be}} affected if they have previously been damaged by disorders such as arthritis. Pain most commonly occurs in peripheral joints, such as the wrists, ankles, and joints of the hands and feet as well as some of the larger joints, typically the shoulders, elbows and <b>knees.</b> <b>Pain</b> may also occur in the muscles or ligaments.|$|R

25|$|Knee replacement, {{also known}} as knee arthroplasty, is a {{surgical}} procedure to replace the weight-bearing surfaces of the knee joint to relieve pain and disability. It is most commonly performed for osteoarthritis, and also for other knee diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis. In patients with severe deformity from advanced rheumatoid arthritis, trauma, or long-standing osteoarthritis, the surgery may be more complicated and carry higher risk. Osteoporosis does not typically cause <b>knee</b> <b>pain,</b> deformity, or inflammation {{and is not a}} reason to perform knee replacement.|$|E
25|$|Following the German {{acupuncture}} trials from 2006 to 2007, the Federal Joint Committee (an agency {{similar to}} the National Institutes of Health in the United States) passed a law which allows the reimbursement of acupuncture treatment by the public health insurance system for the following ailments: chronic lower back pain and chronic <b>knee</b> <b>pain</b> caused by osteoarthritis. In 2006, German researchers published the results {{of one of the}} first and largest randomized controlled clinical trials. As a result of the trial's conclusions, some insurance corporations in Germany no longer reimburse acupuncture treatments. The trials also had a negative impact on acupuncture in the international community.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the primary}} reasons for {{performing}} arthroscopies is to repair or trim a painful and torn or damaged meniscus. The technical terms for the surgery is arthroscopic partial meniscectomy (APM). Arthroscopic surgery, however, {{does not appear to}} result in benefits to adults when performed for <b>knee</b> <b>pain</b> in patients with osteoarthritis who have a meniscal tear. This {{may be due to the}} fact that a torn meniscus may often not cause pain and symptoms, which may be caused by the osteoarthritis alone. Some groups have made a strong recommendation against arthroscopic partial meniscectomy in nearly all patients, stating that the only group of patients who may - or may not - benefit are those with a true locked knee. Professional knee societies, however, highlight other symptoms and related factors they believe are important, and continue to support limited use of arthroscopic partial meniscectomy in carefully selected patients.|$|E

25|$|Some {{advantages}} of the graft include less trauma to the leg that has undergone the ACL revision. Patients regain their range of motion and leg strength on the newly repaired ACL leg much quicker. The graft also allows for a bone-to-bone fixation which allows for more aggressive rehabilitation. The patient also eliminates the chance of any potential complications such as disease transmission that would be present if an allograph was chosen. The dis{{advantages of}} the graft include infection at this site, anterior <b>knee</b> <b>pain,</b> quadriceps muscle weakness, loss of motion, patella fracture, patellofemoral crepitus, patellar tendonitis, and patellofemoral joint pain. Also, {{it is not uncommon}} in certain patient populations to rupture the contralateral ACL following return to their sport. By harvesting the patellar tendon from the opposite knee, the orthopedic surgeon no longer has the option of using that patellar tendon for the reconstruction. It has been noted that a low percentage of patients have suffered a patellar tendon rupture in the first few weeks after surgery due to the increased stress to the area. In addition to a longer operating time the patient will have two scars instead of one.|$|E
