50|$|Moondust is also {{considered}} to be the first interactive music publication, and it sold quite successfully. With the profits from Moondust and additional funding from Marvin Minsky, Lanier formed VPL which would later go on to create the DataGlove and the <b>DataSuit</b> and {{to become one of the}} primary innovators of virtual-reality research and development throughout the 1980s.|$|E
50|$|Piloting a Landmate is {{a unique}} experience, given that the craft behaves as an {{extension}} of the human body, one that just does everything its wearer is doing. There are seemingly no physical controls in the cockpit, rather control is accomplished through motion-capture technology (ironically, very similar to that used to animate the movies) via the pilot's <b>Datasuit,</b> an undergarment that records nerve and muscle impulses. The electrostatic information gathered by the suit is then wirelessly relayed to a central processing unit, that manipulates the various motors and joint servos in order to mimic the pilot's motions in a proportionate, but much bigger scale.|$|E
40|$|While a new {{technology}} called 'virtual reality' is still at the 'ground floor' level, one of its basic components, 3 D computer graphics is already in wide commercial use and expanding. Other components that permit a human operator to 'virtually' explore an artificial environment and to interact with it are being demonstrated routinely at Ames and elsewhere. Virtual reality might be defined as an environment capable of being virtually entered - telepresence, it is called - or interacted with by a human. The Virtual Interface Environment Workstation (VIEW) is a head-mounted stereoscopic display {{system in which the}} display may be an artificial computer-generated environment or a real environment relayed from remote video cameras. Operator can 'step into' this environment and interact with it. The DataGlove has a series of fiber optic cables and sensors that detect any movement of the wearer's fingers and transmit the information to a host computer; a computer generated image of the hand will move exactly as the operator is moving his gloved hand. With appropriate software, the operator can use the glove to interact with the computer scene by grasping an object. The <b>DataSuit</b> is a sensor equipped full body garment that greatly increases the sphere of performance for virtual reality simulations...|$|E
