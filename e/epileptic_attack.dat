25|$|While Napoleon savaged {{his left}} wing, Archduke Charles {{remained}} amazingly inert. At 6:00 AM, the archduke was with Prince Rosenberg and at 7:30 AM he sent orders to Archduke Louis and then {{wrote a letter}} to Emperor Francis I of Austria. But from 11:00 AM until 6:30 PM, the Austrian generalissimo failed to issue any orders. He either became obsessed with capturing Regensburg or he had an epileptic seizure during which he is supposed to have locked himself in his quarters. The <b>epileptic</b> <b>attack</b> is probable, but there is a possibility it may be a cover story for Charles' failure to exercise command. What is known is that the Austrian III, IV, and I Reserve Armeekorps did not disturb Davout's remaining three divisions under Generals of Division Louis Friant, Saint-Hilaire, and Montbrun on 20 April.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1953, Panufnik was sent, with the Chamber Orchestra of the Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra, {{on a tour of}} China, where he met prime-minister Zhou Enlai and, briefly, Chairman Mao. In his first days there, he heard devastating news that his adored Oonagh had been drowned while Scarlett had an <b>epileptic</b> <b>attack</b> while she was bathing her. [...] After {{returning}} to Warsaw he was asked to write a letter that the government could send to western musicians, ostensibly from Panufnik, to sound them out as to their sympathies with the Polish [...] "Peace Movement". Panufnik described this as effectively an order to spy for Moscow, and as the last in a [...] "succession of final straws". [...] Thus in 1954 Panufnik no longer felt able to reconcile his patriotic desire to remain a Polish composer in Poland with his contempt for the musical and political demands of the government. [...] He decided to migrate to Britain in order to highlight the conditions in which Polish composers were being forced to work.|$|E
6000|$|A {{respected}} {{couple in}} the vicinity had long been childless. At length their wishes were crowned with success, and a little baby girl was born to them. But the priest, who had curious ideas of his own, insisted on consulting, as to this child, a certain witch, a woman who dwelt apart in a cave {{where there was a}} sulphurous hot-water spring, surrounded by laurel bushes, regarded as sacred by the benighted islanders. This spring, or the fumes that arose from it, was supposed to confer on the dweller in the cave the gift of prophecy. She was the servant of Apollon, and was credited with possessing a spirit of divination. The woman, after undergoing, or simulating, an <b>epileptic</b> <b>attack,</b> declared, in rhythmical language, that the babe must not be allowed to live. She averred that it would [...] "bring destruction on Scheria," [...] the native name for the island, which I have styled Boothland, in honour of the Salvation Army. This was enough for the priests, who did not actually slay the infant, but exposed it {{on the side of a}} mountain, where the beasts and birds were likely to have their way with it.|$|E

5000|$|Glutamic acid {{has been}} implicated in epileptic seizures.

40|$|OBJECTIVES—Sudden falls {{have been}} {{described}} in patients with partial epilepsy. However, no study has detailed the clinical, EEG, and evolutive features of partial epilepsies with drop attacks.  METHODS—In a consecutive series of 222 patients with partial epilepsy admitted for uncontrolled seizures over a 10 year period, 31 patients presented with <b>epileptic</b> drop <b>attacks</b> during evolution of their illness. Twenty two patients had frontal, five temporal, and four multifocal or undefinable lobe epilepsy; 74 % of the cases showed an EEG pattern of secondary bilateral synchrony during evolution. A statistical comparison of some clinical and EEG features between the patients with <b>epileptic</b> drop <b>attacks</b> and patients with partial epilepsy without drop attacks (control group of 191 patients) was carried out.  RESULTS—Seventy four per cent of patients had a poor prognosis and 45 % were mentally retarded; 52 % of patients with <b>epileptic</b> drop <b>attacks</b> continued to have epileptic falls associated with partial seizures and mental deterioration {{at the end of}} the follow up. These characteristics of patients with <b>epileptic</b> drop <b>attacks</b> were significantly different from the control group.  CONCLUSION—Almost all literature reports concur that the physiopathogenetic substrate of <b>epileptic</b> drop <b>attacks</b> is a mechanism of secondary bilateral synchrony. A localised epileptic focus may lead to a process of secondary epileptogenesis involving the whole brain, causing a progressive cerebral disturbance with worsening of the epileptic seizures and higher cerebral functions. ...|$|R

40|$|Malformations of {{cortical}} development (MCD) {{have been}} increasingly {{recognized as an}} important cause of intractable epilepsy. The aim of our study was to define epileptogenicity of MCDs by correlating MRI, EEG and semiology of <b>epileptic</b> <b>attacks,</b> and {{to determine the effect}} of MCD on drug resistant epilepsy. We also intended to reveal the utility of interictal single photo emission computed tomography (SPECT) in verification of MCD lesions and relative prevalence of different MCDs. Based on interictal EEG finding, semiology of the <b>epileptic</b> <b>attacks</b> and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) "electroclinical epileptogenicity" of MCD was defined. Brain MRI revealed cortical dysplasia (CD) in nine patients, polymicrogyria in four patients, lissencephaly and schizencephaly in one patient each. Three patients had a combination of malformations. The localization of SPECT hypoperfusion corresponded to MCD lesion in ten (66. 67 %) patients. Electroclinically confirmed epileptogenicity of MCD overlapped with MR and interictal SPECT findings in fourteen (93. 3 %) and nine (60. 0 %) patients, respectively. Our study results demonstrated the MCD lesions to be highly epileptogenic and a frequent cause of intractability...|$|R

It can be diagnosed by the brain’s electrical activity (EEG). The determination of <b>epileptic</b> <b>attacks</b> by EEG signals is quite common in both clinical and research fields. During epileptic seizures, the brain dynamics that make up the graph consist of abnormalities in EEG signals.

The severity of these symptoms is correlated with the intensity, frequency, and age of onset of the patient's epilepsy as well as their responsiveness to treatment for the <b>epileptic</b> <b>attacks.</b> In some severe cases, patients develop spastic tetraplegia which is the loss of function in all four limbs.|$|R
