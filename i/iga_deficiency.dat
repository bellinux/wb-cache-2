40|$|Determinations of IgG subclasses {{were made}} by electroimmunoassay and crossed immunoelectrophoresis, and Gm markers were typed in sera from {{seventeen}} patients with well-defined immunodeficiency diseases. Certain IgG subclass and Gm patterns were recognized in various diseases: IgG 2 deficiency and homozygosity of Gm (4, 5) in the cartilage-hair-hypoplasia syndrome, in the ataxia telangiectasia syndrome and in selective IgG subclass deficiency; and IgG 3 deficiency and homozygosity of Gm(1,- 5) in the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome. The findings suggest a common structural or regulator gene defect in some immunodeficiency diseases. In <b>IgA</b> <b>deficiencies,</b> the levels of IgG 1 were raised. In patients with IgG subclass deficiencies there was sometimes a compensatory increase of the remaining IgG subclasses, with a preponderance of IgG 1 and IgG 3. The increased Ig 1 showed restricted heterogeneity with only an increase of the electrophoretically cathodal part. This part contained both kappa and lambda chaings.

40|$|Aim. IgA {{nephropathy}} (IgAN) is {{the most}} common form of glomerulonephritis. Recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) suggested that DEFA locus (which encodes α-defensins) may play a key role in IgAN. Methods. The levels of α-defensins in 169 IgAN patients and 83 healthy controls were tested by ELISA. Results. We observed that α-defensins human neutrophil peptides 1 – 3 (HNP 1 – 3) in IgAN patients were elevated compared with healthy controls. The mean levels of α-defensins of 83 healthy controls and 169 IgAN patients were 50 [*]ng/mL and 78. 42 [*]ng/mL. When the results were adjusted to the mean levels of α-defensins of IgAN patients, the percentage of individuals with high levels of α-defensins increased in IgAN patients (22. 5 %) compared to healthy controls (9. 6 %) (p= 0. 013). The elevation of α-defensins in IgAN patients was independent of renal function or neutrophil count, which were major sources of α-defensins in circulation. More importantly, negative correlation was observed between galactose-deficient IgA 1 and α-defensins. Conclusion. As α-defensin is a lectin-like peptide, we speculated that it might be involved in <b>IgA</b> galactose <b>deficiency.</b> The data implied that patients with IgAN had higher plasma α-defensins levels and high α-defensins correlated with <b>IgA</b> galactose <b>deficiency,</b> further suggesting a pathogenic role of α-defensins in IgAN...|$|R
40|$|SummaryObjectivesImmunoglobulin (Ig) {{deficiency}} is {{a well-known}} risk factor for Streptococcus pneumoniae or Haemophilus influenzae infections and noteworthy invasive diseases. However, the proportion of these deficiencies in cases of invasive disease is unknown. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the rate of Ig deficiency in cases of invasive disease. MethodsA prospective study was conducted from January 2008 to October 2010 in two French hospitals. Measurement of Ig levels was carried out in patients hospitalized for invasive diseases. ResultsA total of 119 patients were enrolled in the study, with nine cases of H. influenzae and 110 cases of S. pneumoniae invasive disease. There were 18 cases of meningitis, 79 of invasive pneumonia, and 22 other invasive diseases. Forty-five patients (37. 8 %) had an Ig abnormality, 37 of whom had an Ig deficiency (20 IgG < 6 g/l, four isolated IgA < 0. 7 g/l, and 13 isolated IgM < 0. 5 g/l), while eight had an elevated monoclonal paraprotein. Nineteen of these 45 patients had a clearly defined Ig abnormality, with five primary deficiencies (three common variable immunodeficiencies and two complete <b>IgA</b> <b>deficiencies)</b> and 14 secondary deficiencies, mainly lymphoproliferative disorders. All these deficiencies were either not known or not substituted. ConclusionsHumoral deficiency is frequent in patients with S. pneumoniae or H. influenzae invasive disease and Ig dosage should be proposed systematically after such infections...|$|R

She had anti-alpha 2 antibodies of the IgG class. One of her daughters also lacked IgA 2 with a normal level of IgA 1. The analysis of the immunoglobulin haplotypes of the family suggested the deletion of the alpha 2 -gene. In addition, the analysis of B lymphocytes of mother and daughter showed the absence of IgA 2 -bearing cells. Upon stimulation with pokeweed mitogen, the B cells differentiated into IgA 1 -containing plasma cells, but IgA 2 -containing cells were not found.

40|$|Ultrastructural and {{immunohistochemical}} {{studies of}} the small intestine are described in a Japanese patient with alpha heavy chain disease who {{had a history of}} colonic ulcers. Endoscopic examinations revealed multiple gastric erosion, duodenal ulcer, and a thickened, cobblestone-like pattern composed of small nodules in the duodenum and jejunum, which was similar in appearance to Crohn's disease. An electron microscopic study showed that the numerous, infiltrated cells in the jejunal lamina propria were matured plasma cells with atypical structure of the organelles. These plasma cells had alpha heavy chain protein devoid of light chain. Although secretory component was demonstrated normally in the epithelial cells by immunofluorescent methods, no association of this component with alpha heavy chain protein could be observed in any of the plasma and epithelial cells of this case. These facts suggest the absence of secretory alpha chain or secretory <b>IgA,</b> and a <b>deficiency</b> of the mucosal secretory immune system in this patient...|$|R
40|$|The humoral {{immune system}} of the small {{intestine}} of 17 patients with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) was studied by immunohistology using antibodies specific for IgA 1, 2, IgM, IgG 1 - 4, the J chain and the secretory component (SC). IgA 1, 2 +, IgG 2 + and IgM+ lamina propria B cells were totally lacking in 65 % (11 / 17), 41 % (7 / 17) and 18 % (3 / 17) of CVID patients, respectively. One patient exhibited an isolated <b>IgA</b> 1 subclass <b>deficiency.</b> The proportion of plasma cells in conventionally stained histological sections of the same intestinal biopsies showed a close correlation with the numbers of IgA+ and IgM+ cells. Considerable numbers of J chain-synthesizing cells were present in all patients with CVID, indicating the presence of early B cells unable to differentiate into immunoglobulin-producing plasma cells. Most of the patients with intestinal IgA and/or IgM defects strongly expressed the SC in their enterocytes, suggesting an immunoglobulin-independent regulation of the SC. Clinically, only CVID patients with intestinal IgA defects developed intestinal infections with Giardia lamblia, Campylobacter jejuni or Candida albicans. The outcome of in vitro immunoglobulin synthesis assays with peripheral blood lymphocytes did not predict {{the presence or absence}} of the respective isotype-producing B cells in the intestinal lamina propria. Thus, immunohistological examinations of intestinal biopsies are required to determine the extent of mucosal immunodeficiency in CVID patients...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Respiratory {{infections are}} major causes of {{morbidity}} and mortality, but determinants of susceptibility are poorly defined. We studied whether {{and to what}} extent immunologic and genetic factors are associated with increased susceptibility to respiratory infections. METHODS: We evaluated the prevalence of IgA, IgM, IgG, and IgG subclass deficiencies, impairment in the antibody response against pneumococcal polysaccharides, G 2 m(n) allotypes, FcgammaRIIa polymorphisms, partial C 2 and partial C 4 deficiency, promoter polymorphisms in MBL 2, and lymphocyte subset deficiencies in a control population and in consecutive children with recurrent respiratory infections. RESULTS: IgA and/or IgG subclass deficiency was found in 27 of 55 patients (49 %) and 6 of 43 controls (14 %) (P = 0. 0006). An impaired antibody response to polysaccharides was found in 7 patients (19 %) and in 0 of 37 controls (P = 0. 002). The Gm(n) marker was absent in 25 of 55 patients (45 %) and 6 of 42 controls (14 %) (P = 0. 009). The MBL 2 variants O/O, A/O, and A/A occurred in 9, 14, and 32 of the 55 patients, respectively, and in 1, 19, and 23 of the 43 controls, respectively (P = 0. 05). There was no increase in the prevalence of partial C 4 deficiency, C 2 deficiency, lymphocyte subset deficiency, or FcgammaRIIa polymorphism in the patients compared to the controls. A combination of at least 2 immune defects was found in 31 of 55 patients (56 %) and in 4 of 42 controls (11. 6 %) (P < 0. 0001). CONCLUSION: Specific antipolysaccharide antibody <b>deficiency,</b> <b>IgA</b> and/or IgG subclass deficiency, Gm(n) allotype, and MBL 2 genotype are susceptibility factors for recurrent respiratory infections, and coexistence of several immune defects is the strongest risk factor in this study. status: publishe...|$|R
