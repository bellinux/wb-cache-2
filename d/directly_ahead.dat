Scarcely had this danger passed when a new enemy appeared in sight <b>ahead.</b> <b>Directly</b> in their way, just beyond the line of floe-ice against which they were alternately thumping and grinding, lay a group of bergs.

40|$|This work {{originated}} in {{a fascination with}} Caché/Hidden (haneke, 2005) for its portrayal of the present-day West as inhabiting a decidedly unreconciled postcolonial moment. Before addressing Hidden <b>directly,</b> the chapter <b>ahead</b> seeks to flesh out a select 'back story' through two other films charting important moments in France’s colonial history: Camp de Thiaroye/The Camp at Thiaroye (Sembene and Faty Sow, 1987) and La Battaglia di Algeri/The Battle of Algiers (Pontecorvo, 1966). The culmination of this process in Hidden presents thus-far suppressed memory, experience, and figuration of the colonial other now operating as a spectral and virtual presence inside the privileged Western subject. Across the films – played out between colonial, anticolonial, and postcolonial eras – I sketch the development of what Edward Said calls this subject’s 'imaginative geography and of the dramatic boundaries it draws' (1979, p. 73). The discussion ahead seeks to chart the spatial eroding of the demarcation between this figure and its colonial other {{to a point where}} a virtual image of the latter haunts the former from within...|$|R
5|$|Then 23-year-old Gordon Touw Ngie Tjouw participated on Suriname's behalf in the men's 100meters butterfly.

5|$|On 9 July 1806, {{the small}} British brig HMS Rattlesnake under Commander John Bastard was {{cruising}} off the Southern {{coast of the}} British colony of Ceylon in search of French privateers that had been attacking small British traders, known as country ships, in the region. Most notorious of these was the Bellone, known to be operating in the area. In the early afternoon, lookouts on Rattlesnake spotted sails near the Little Basses Reef and approached the ship, which turned with the wind and fled to the southwest. Bastard immediately gave chase, and soon came close enough to identify the vessel as the Bellone. Although Bellone was {{much larger than the}} British warship, Captain Perroud was unwilling to risk his vessel in an unprofitable confrontation with Rattlesnake and seemed to be making an effective withdrawal when, at 15:15, a large ship came within sight <b>directly</b> <b>ahead.</b>|$|E

5|$|Pohlmann struck {{camp and}} {{deployed}} his infantry battalions {{in a line}} facing southwards behind the steep banks of the Kailna with his cannon arrayed directly in front. The great mass of Maratha cavalry was kept on the right flank and Berar's irregular infantry garrisoned Assaye to the rear. The only observable crossing point over the river was a small ford <b>directly</b> <b>ahead</b> of the Maratha position. Pohlmann's strategy was to funnel the British and Madras troops across the ford {{into the mouth of}} his cannon, and then on to the massed infantry and cavalry behind. Wellesley's local guides assured him that no other ford existed nearby, but he quickly discarded the option of a frontal assault as suicide. While reconnoitring he had noticed two unguarded villages, Peepulgaon and Waroor, one on each bank of the Kaitna beyond the Maratha left. On the assumption that a ford must exist between the two villages, Wellesley ordered the area to be further reconnoitred by his Chief Engineer, Captain John Johnson, who reported that there was indeed a ford at that spot. Thus Wellesley led his army east to the crossing in an attempt to launch an attack on Pohlmann's left flank.|$|E

25|$|The {{original}} 1838 {{structure was}} relatively small; only two storeys tall with a full-height, central, curved bay, and an accordingly curved pediment on top, the villa {{was designed by}} Thomas McKay (who had also designed and built Earnscliffe) in a Regency style, inspired {{by the work of}} architect Sir John Soane, who had himself designed a never realised government house for the then capital of Upper Canada, York, in 1818. Unlike the present arrangement, the rooms of the McKay villa for entertaining, sleeping, and service were dispersed throughout the two floors of the structure, with the main parlour located on the second level, in an oval room behind the curved, south bay, which National Capital Commission Chief Architect David Scarlett said in 2014 was made in such a shape so as to display the advanced abilities of McKay's stonemasons. The main entrance to the house was on the west side and opened into a hall with stairs to the upper floor <b>directly</b> <b>ahead.</b> Along the south front were a library, a dining room, and a boudoir, all with French doors opening onto a narrow balcony; the dining room was served by three of these doors, one of which now opens into the Tent Room's antechamber, one into the Long Gallery, and one that still opens to the outside.
