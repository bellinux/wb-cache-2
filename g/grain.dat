5|$|The starch {{source in}} a beer {{provides}} the fermentable material {{and is a}} key determinant of the strength and flavour of the beer. The most common starch source used in beer is malted <b>grain.</b> <b>Grain</b> is malted by soaking it in water, allowing it to begin germination, and then drying the partially germinated <b>grain</b> in a kiln. Malting <b>grain</b> produces enzymes that convert starches in the <b>grain</b> into fermentable sugars. Different roasting times and temperatures are used to produce different colours of malt from the same <b>grain.</b> Darker malts will produce darker beers.|$|E

5|$|Nearly all beer {{includes}} {{barley malt}} {{as the majority}} of the starch. This is because its fibrous hull remains attached to the <b>grain</b> during threshing. After malting, barley is milled, which finally removes the hull, breaking it into large pieces. These pieces remain with the <b>grain</b> during the mash, and act as a filter bed during lautering, when sweet wort is separated from insoluble <b>grain</b> material. Other malted and unmalted grains (including wheat, rice, oats, and rye, and less frequently, corn and sorghum) may be used. Some brewers have produced gluten-free beer, made with sorghum with no barley malt, for those who cannot consume gluten-containing grains like wheat, barley, and rye.|$|E

40|$|When {{a mixture}} of two kinds of <b>grains</b> differing in size and shape is poured in a {{vertical}} two-dimensional cell, the mixture spontaneously stratifies in alternating layers of small and large <b>grains,</b> whenever the large <b>grains</b> are more faceted than the small <b>grains.</b> Otherwise, the mixture spontaneously segregates in {{different regions of the}} cell when the large <b>grains</b> are more rounded than the small <b>grains.</b> We address the question of the origin of the instability mechanism leading to stratification using a recently proposed set of equations for surface flow of granular mixtures. We show that the stable solution of the system is a segregation solution due to size (large <b>grains</b> tend to segregate downhill near the substrate and small <b>grains</b> tend to segregate uphill) and shape (rounded <b>grains</b> tend to segregate downhill and more faceted <b>grains</b> tend to segregate uphill). As a result, the segregation solution of the system is realized for mixtures of large-rounded <b>grains</b> and small-cubic <b>grains</b> with the large-rounded <b>grains</b> segregating {{near the bottom of the}} pile. Stability analysis reveals the instability mechanism driving the system to stratification as a competition between size-segregation and shape-segregation taking place for mixtures of large-cubic <b>grains</b> and small-rounded <b>grains.</b> The large-cubic <b>grains</b> tend to size-segregate at the bottom of the pile, while at the same time, they tend to shape-segregate near the pouring point. Thus, the segregation solution becomes unstable, and the system evolves spontaneously to stratification. Comment: 10 pages, 10 figures, [URL]...|$|R
40|$|Granular {{materials}} size segregate {{when exposed}} to external periodic perturbations such as vibrations. Moreover, mixtures of <b>grains</b> of different sizes spontaneously segregate {{in the absence of}} external perturbations: when a mixture is simply poured onto a pile, the large <b>grains</b> {{are more likely to be}} found near the base, while the small <b>grains</b> are more likely to be near the top.

5|$|The <b>grain</b> {{trade was}} a {{profitable}} private enterprise {{during the early}} Western Han, yet Emperor Wu's government intervened in the <b>grain</b> trade when it established the equable marketing system (also known as the ever-normal granary system) in 110 BC. The government purchased <b>grain</b> when it was plentiful and inexpensive, shipping it to granaries for storage or to areas where <b>grain</b> was scarce. The system was intended to eliminate <b>grain</b> speculation, to create a standard price and to increase government revenue. The system was designed by civil servant Sang Hongyang (d. 80 BC)—who was previously a merchant. Sang Hongyang was criticized by merchants for placing government officials in market stalls. This supply system was discontinued in Eastern Han, although it was briefly revived by Emperor Ming of Han (r. 57–75).

40|$|The {{approximately}} 2. 9 Ga old Witwatersrand Basin of South Africa hosts {{different types}} of pyrite <b>grains.</b> The pyrite <b>grains</b> are hosted in different quartz pebble conglomerate reefs including the Ventersdorp Contact Reef (VCR). The various reefs are accessible from numerous goldfields. Regardless of years of studying {{the various types of}} pyrite <b>grains</b> from the VCR, there is still a disagreement as to their origins. Numerous pyrite <b>grains</b> of different types, shapes, and textures have been identified in the VCR of the Kloof Gold Mine. The origin of the {{different types of}} pyrite <b>grains</b> have been attributed to various mechanisms. Consequently, different depositional models were suggested for the mineralisation of the pyrite <b>grains.</b> Nevertheless, the style of mineralisation and origin of the different types of pyrite <b>grains</b> require further work especially for the VCR. This study determined whether a single or multiple processes were responsible for the formation of the different pyrite <b>grains.</b> The different types of pyrite <b>grains</b> including the rounded porous, rounded massive and angular massive <b>grains</b> were identified using a reflected light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and Röntec energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy. The above techniques were used to describe the shapes, sizes, and textures of the different types of pyrite <b>grains</b> in order to classify and group the pyrite <b>grains</b> for further investigation by chemical analysis. Identification and description of minerals associated with pyrite were conducted to determine the environment and conditions under which pyrite <b>grains</b> were formed. Genetic structures were identified in order to resolve whether the pyrite <b>grains</b> were transported or crystallised in situ. Different types of inclusions hosted in pyrite <b>grains</b> were identified and described to determine the nature of pyrite <b>grains.</b> Rounded zircon <b>grains</b> were identified in rounded massive pyrite <b>grains,</b> and the appearance the rounded zircon <b>grains</b> might suggest that the rounded massive pyrite <b>grains</b> formed later after the deposition of the Witwatersrand basin sediments. A particle induced x-ray emission, an electron microprobe, and a laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry were used to carry out chemical analysis of the major, minor and trace elements of the different pyrite <b>grains.</b> The chemical analyses were conducted to investigate and determine the chemical signatures and the composition of the different types of the pyrite <b>grains</b> to determine their processes of formation. Compositional zonation patterns and overgrowths of the pyrite <b>grains</b> were identified in order to determine whether the pyrite <b>grains</b> were formed through multiple mechanisms. The compositional zonation patterns were observed in the rounded porous pyrite <b>grains.</b> The zonations suggest multiple stages of growth processes resulting in most porous parts of the pyrite being enclosed by nearly pure pyrite. The rounded pyrite <b>grains</b> are generally containing high concentrations of Ni and Co as opposed to angular pyrite <b>grains.</b> The Ni/Co ration is low in the angular pyrite <b>grains,</b> but high in the rounded <b>grains.</b> The high Ni/Co ratio in rounded <b>grains</b> may be related to low-temperature sedimentary processes, whereas the low Ni/Co ratio in angular pyrite <b>grains</b> may indicate hydrothermal source. The differences between rounded and angular pyrite <b>grains</b> can be interpreted as a result of different genetic history, and origin from different sources. Thus the different pyrite <b>grains</b> formed under different chemical and atmospheric conditions, and by different depositional mechanisms.
