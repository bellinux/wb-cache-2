Solubility and permeability coefficients measured show a strong {{dependence of the}} applied vapour activity typical for these systems, contrary to the behaviour of permanent gases. However, as irregularities in the series of chloromethanes show, highest sorption does not necessarily lead to the highest permeability value. A possible explanation of this effect {{can be found in}} the concentration dependent diffusion behaviour of poly (<b>dimethylsiloxane)</b> toward these organic vapours.

40|$|This article {{presents}} {{the development of}} technical equations of state for four siloxanes using the 12 -parameter Span–Wagner functional form. Siloxanes are used as heat transfer fluids and working media in energy conversion applications. The investigated fluids are two linear <b>dimethylsiloxanes,</b> namely MM (hexamethyldisiloxane, C 6 H 18 OSi 2) and MD 4 M (tetradecamethylhexasiloxane, C 14 H 42 O 5 Si 6), and two cyclic <b>dimethylsiloxanes,</b> namely D 4 (octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane, C 8 H 24 O 4 Si 4) and D 5 (decamethylcyclopentasiloxane, C 10 H 30 O 5 Si 5). Available measured properties are critically evaluated and selected for the optimization of the equation of state (EoS) parameters. Due to the insufficient number of experimental values, several other properties are estimated with the most accurate ad hoc methods. These estimates {{are included in the}} optimization of the equation of state parameters. Moreover, experimental saturated liquid density and vapor pressure data are correlated with the equations proposed by Daubert and Wagner–Ambrose, respectively, to provide short, simple, and accurate equations for the computation of these properties. The performance of the obtained equations of state is assessed by comparison with experimental data and also with estimates obtained with the Peng–Robinson cubic EoS with the modification proposed by Stryjek and Vera. This equation was adopted in previous technical studies. The improvements obtained with the newly developed EoS's are significant. Exemplary state diagrams are also reported as a demonstration of the consistency of the obtained thermodynamic models. Sound speed measurements in the vapor phase are planned for the near future and results will be incorporated in future improvements of the newly developed thermodynamic models...|$|R

Copolymerization was performed using either low molecular weight monomers or high molecular weight macromers. The organic macromer was prepared by acyclic diene metathesis (ADMET) polymerization of para-phenylenediacrylic acid dipent- 4 -enyl ester. Hexamethyltrisiloxane and,-bishydride-terminated polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) were used as inorganic macromers. The copolymers show microphase separation of the soft siloxane block and the hard semicrystalline organic block, as observed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray scattering experiments (SAXS and WAXS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The crosslinking rate upon UV-irradiation is slightly higher for the microphase-separated copolymer than for the corresponding homopolymer.

40|$|Bioconversion {{reactions}} involving whole {{cells are}} usually characterized by low volumetric productivities in aqueous media, {{due to the}} low solubility of both the substrates and the reaction products in water. In order to overcome this problem, organic solvents {{have been used as}} substrate/product pools, including some environmentally friendly substances in view of their low volatility and toxicity [1]. Silicone oils have successfully been used as production medium in conversion of sterols to steroids with whole cells in monophasic and biphasic systems [1]. For the process scale-up, a number of physical properties of the system are needed, such as viscosity of the production medium and solubility of metabolic gases (oxygen and carbon dioxide) in the organic solvent. Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and polymethylphenylsiloxane have been the most used silicone oils in production media for bioconversion reactions. In the case of polydimethylsiloxane, oils with kinematic viscosities of around 20 cSt are common (molecular weight of 2000). Solubilities of oxygen and carbon dioxide in such silicone oils are very scarce as well as their prediction by molecular simulation. Makrodimitri et al [2] have developed a united atom force field for the calculation of structural and thermodynamic properties of pure PDMS. Using this force field, they have obtained, by simulation, solubilities of oxygen in PDMS (with an average molecular weight of around 6000), as well as solubilities and diffusion coefficients of other penetrant gases, such as n-alkanes, n-perfluoroalkanes and noble gases [3]. This work focused on prediction of the properties of silicone oils of short to moderate chain length (8 to 25 monomers, which corresponds to a molecular weight between around 750 and 2000) by computer simulation, in particular the solubility of oxygen and carbon dioxide in these liquids. Two different force fields were tested against experimental measurements of density for the shortest <b>dimethylsiloxanes</b> methyl terminated: Gromos- 43 A 1 and the force field developed by Makrodimitri et al specifically for PDMS. Henry’s constants for the dissolution of oxygen and carbon dioxide in PDMS oils were obtained as a function of temperature by computer simulation using both the force fields tested. The calculations were done for PDMS with three different chain lengths: 8, 16 and 25 monomers [(CH 3) 2 SiO units] with methyl termination in all cases. The force field developed by Makrodimitri et al provides the best description of the PDMS oils studied both in terms of density and gas solubility.

HTS with a phenyl containing disilazane, diphenyltetramethyldisilazane (DPTMDS), and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) are studied on Cab-O-Sil, a fumed silica, as a model substrate. Using 29 Si CP-MAS NMR, it was shown that no <b>dimethylsiloxane</b> chains were formed upon silylation with DPTMDS under different conditions of humidity and stoichiometry at 377 °C. With DPTMDS deactivation it is possible that amino trisiloxy silane groups are formed, these groups add extra activity to the surface. Silylation with a PDMS, OV 101, at various temperatures between 300 °- 420 °C did show that <b>dimethylsiloxane</b> chains were bonded at the surface. Using the 29 Si CP-MAS NMR technique with variable contact times to reveal siloxy group mobility, the degradation of <b>dimethylsiloxane</b> chains at the surface was studied.

The nanovesicles are formed by self-assembly of amphiphilic copolymer poly-(2 -methyloxazoline) -poly- (<b>dimethylsiloxane)</b> -poly-(2 -methyloxazoline) (PMOXA-PDMS-PMOXA). We chose this polymer due to its advantages over conventional systems, i. e. liposomes. Polymer nanocontainers can be produced with a controlled mean diameter and low polydispersity compared to liposomes. They were tested and shown to be more stable than liposomes. [1] These represent the main advantages {{with respect to the}} application as carriers to improve the drug stability and the circulation life-time. Another factor which could increase dramatically the circulation life-time and therefore the availability of the encapsulated SOD, is the stealth property of the poly- (2 -methyloxazoline) chain, comparable to that of PEG. Besides, the polymer used for this study, has an oxygen permeable membrane, as will be shown later. All these advantages make the nanoreactors a completely new approach of drug delivery systems, in which the cargo is not released, but performs its function within the vesicle. The nanovesicles, made of poly-(2 -methyloxazoline) -poly (<b>dimethylsiloxane)</b> -poly (2 - methyloxazoline), successfully encapsulated the SOD protein during their formation by a self-assembling process, as proved by confocal laser-scanning microscopy and fluorescence-correlation spectroscopy.

The function of this antioxidant nanoreactor was tested by pulse radiolysis which demonstrated that superoxide dismutase remains active inside the nanovesicles.
