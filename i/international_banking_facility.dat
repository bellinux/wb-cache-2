50|$|Economic {{problems}} persisted. From 1987 to 1996 Thailand {{experienced a}} current account deficit averaging -5.4 percent of GDP per year, and the deficit continued to increase. In 1996, the current account deficit accounted for -7.887 percent of GDP (US$14.351 billion). A shortage of capital was another problem. The first Chuan Leekpai government, in office from September 1992 to May 1995, tried {{to solve this problem}} by granting Bangkok <b>International</b> <b>Banking</b> <b>Facility</b> (BIBF) licenses to Thai banks in 1993. This allowed BIBF banks to benefit from Thailand's high interest rate by borrowing from foreign financial institutions at low interest and loaning to Thai businesses. By 1997 foreign debt had risen to US$109, 276 billion (65 5 of which was short-term debt), while Thailand had US$38,700 billion in international reserves. Many loans were backed by real estate, creating an economic bubble. By late 1996, there was a loss of confidence in the country's financial institutions; the government closed 18 trust companies and three commercial banks. The following year, 56 financial institutions were closed by the government.|$|E

Utilizing standard time-series techniques, this study confirms {{that there is}} evidence that developments in some sectoral indices—including those of banking and financial sectors—seem to have caused upward pressure on exchange rates. A correlation between some of these variables is also found to be strong across countries in the crisis period, thereby confirming the importance of the linkages between financial markets as a transmission channel of the Thai crisis to the Philippines.

40|$|This paper investigates how {{business}} groups in Thailand had evolved since the 1950 s. We argue that political connections and foreign capital among other factors were contributable {{to the emerging}} of Thai {{business groups}}. The business groups that owned banks developed fast during the late 1980 s and the early 1990 s until the financial deregulation, {{and the establishment of}} the Stock Exchange of Thailand, and the Bangkok <b>International</b> <b>Banking</b> <b>Facilities.</b> After that the groups that do not own banks have expanded rapidly. We find that the ownership and board structure of the listed firms that belong to the top 30 business groups were not affected by the crisis. Compared to the pre-crisis period, the leverage ratio for the business groups firms has increased while the profitability has declined during the post crisis of 1997 - 1999. Restructuring appears to work well among group firms since it has helped improved industry-adjusted operating performance of the firms.

50|$|Banks are {{key players}} in several {{segments}} of the money market. To meet reserve requirements and manage day-to-day liquidity needs, banks buy and sell short-term uncollateralized loans in the federal funds market. For longer maturity loans, banks can tap the Eurodollar market. Eurodollars are dollar-denominated deposit liabilities of banks located outside the United States (or of <b>International</b> <b>Banking</b> <b>Facilities</b> in the United States). US banks can raise funds in the Eurodollar market through their overseas branches and subsidiaries. A second option is to issue large negotiable certificates of deposit (CDs). These are certificates issued by banks which state that a specified amount of money has been deposited {{for a period of}} time and will be redeemed with interest at maturity. Repurchase agreements (repos) are yet another source of funding. Repos and reverse repos are transactions in which a borrower agrees to sell securities to a lender and then to repurchase the same or similar securities after a specified time, at a given price, and including interest at an agreed-upon rate. Repos are collateralized or secured loans in contrast to federal funds loans which are unsecured.|$|R

40|$|The Federal Reserve Board {{permitted}} banking offices {{located in}} the United States to establish <b>International</b> <b>Banking</b> <b>Facilities</b> (IBFs) beginning in December 1981. The purpose was to allow these banking offices to conduct a deposit and loan business with foreign residents, including foreign banks, without being subject to reserve requirements or to the interest rate ceilings then in effect. IBFs are also exempt from the insurance coverage and assessments imposed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. In addition, {{a number of states}} have encouraged banking institutions to establish IBFs by granting favorable tax treatment under state or local law for IBF operations.; This paper summarizes the history of the IBF proposal and discusses Federal Reserve Board regulations for IBFs and the treatment of IBFs under state and local tax law. The paper analyzes IBF activities and the use of IBFs in comparison with domestic offices and with foreign branches. The growth of IBFs is evaluated in relation to activities in other <b>international</b> <b>banking</b> centers. The paper concludes that IBFs have not {{turned out to be the}} dramatic innovation that some had predicted and that IBFs simply provide another center for booking transactions with foreign residents in a regulatory environment broadly similar to that of the Euromarket. In particular, IBFs appear to be used for a large proportion of transactions with foreign residents that were, or would otherwise have been, booked at Caribbean branches of U. S. banks. To date, the operation of IBFs has not presented a problem either for the conduct of domestic monetary policy or for bank supervision. <b>Banks</b> and <b>banking,</b> <b>International...</b>|$|R
5000|$|In 1997, Thailand {{faced an}} {{economic}} crisis stemming {{from a variety of}} pressures. During the ten year span between 1987 and 1997, Thailand's current account deficit continued to grow. By 1996, the deficit had grown to 7.887% of the total GDP. During this same period, foreign direct investment increased sharply as continuing currency devaluations, first in the 1980's and then as an effect of the Plaza Accord. Real estate investors overestimated the demand for real estate and used the Bangkok <b>International</b> <b>Banking</b> <b>Facility's</b> relatively cheap loans on construction projects that were left vacant due to lower demand than initially thought. [...] Predicting further currency devaluation, speculators launched a series of attacks on the Thai Baht. The Thai government initially attempted to protect the Baht by buying it back and expending its international reserves, but was ultimately forced to float the currency. In August of 1997, the IMF unveiled a relief package for Thailand that would offer a total of 17.2 billion US dollar's worth of bilateral and multilateral assistance. The initial period of policy-making was designed to manage the baht's floating exchange rates, restructure Thai financial institutions, cut public expenditures, promote the private sector, and to attract more foreign capital. The IMF's conditionality for the Thai bailout is characterized by monetary policy reform, fiscal policy reform, and financial sector reform.|$|R

40|$|This Master's thesis' {{purpose is}} to analyse the {{challenges}} that the offshore finance/economy causes to the modern state sovereignty. The offshore finance consists of tax havens, flags of convenience registers, export processing zones, offshore financial centres and <b>international</b> <b>banking</b> <b>facilities,</b> and has grown {{to such an extent}} that if we want to understand the international political economy the offshore simply cannot be left unnoticed. I approach the concept of sovereignty by adopting Giorgio Agamben's idea of the close link between sovereignty and the ability to issue a state of exception. Agamben argues that sovereignty is defined by the ability to issue a state of exception and that in contemporary world the exception takes increasingly often the form of a camp. Albeit Agamben's theory focuses mostly on his idea of biopolitics, I find it imperative to extend its reach. Ronen Palan has shown how offshore jurisdictions commercialise their sovereignty by turning the right to draft legislation into a tradable asset. I will analyse the phenomenon of commercialised sovereignty by using Agamben's theory. The question is who has the de facto power to issue and control the commercialised states of exception within the offshore world? Can we see some kind of shift of sovereignty from states to non-traditional actors of politics? My methodological approach to this question comes from international relations’ constructivism. In line with Nicolas Onuf's constructivist method that operates around the concepts of structures and agents, I start by setting focus on how different types of offshore jurisdictions (structures) establish and use the states of exception. I will then analyse role of the agents that benefit from the special legislation, with particular focus transborder corporations. Onuf argues that the relationship between agents and structures is not mechanical or rigid relation. I agree with him on this. I will take Onuf's point into account by presenting the connections that the politics of offshore has with larger trends of contemporary economical and financial globalisation Susan Strange's theory of the competition state will be extremely helpful in this research process. After focusing on some empirical case studies I conclude that control of the state of exception within the offshore has, at least in some cases, partially shifted to transborder corporations. Therefore, there are some grounds for analysing transborder corporations as participants in politics and bearers of sovereignty. I argue that these kinds of corporations should be called transnational, while their competitors that do not have significant offshore businesses are essentially multinational. Too often these terms are used interexchangeably and without proper definitions. I end my dissertation by suggesting that our fixation on modern state sovereignty is badly outdated in face of the tremendous rise of the offshore world. In the final chapter I introduce one solution for overcoming the difficulties in combining national regulation with increasingly transnational corporations: the new accounting standards proposed by accountant Richard Murphy. The proposed standards would tax transborder corporations as global entities, thus making the regulatory or tax shopping in offshore by and large useless...|$|R
