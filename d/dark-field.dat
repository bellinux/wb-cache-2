25|$|Quantitative tomographic {{reconstruction}} of the <b>dark-field</b> signal has also been demonstrated for the phase-stepping technique and very recently for the Moiré pattern approach as well.|$|E
25|$|It {{has also}} been {{demonstrated}} that <b>dark-field</b> imaging with the grating interferometer {{can be used to}} extract orientational information of structural details in the sub-micrometer regime beyond the spatial resolution of the detection system. While the scattering of X-rays in a direction perpendicular to the grating lines provides the <b>dark-field</b> contrast, the scattering in a direction parallel to the grating lines only lead to blurring in the image, which is not visible at the low resolution of the detector. This intrinsic physical property of the setup is utilized to extract orientational information about the angular variation of the local scattering power of the sample by rotating the sample around the optical axis of the set-up and collecting a set of several <b>dark-field</b> images, each measuring the component of the scattering perpendicular to the grating lines for that particular orientation. This can be used to determine the local angle and degree of orientation of bone and could yield valuable information for improving research and diagnostics of bone diseases like osteoporosis or osteoarthritis.|$|E
25|$|If the {{reflections}} that are selected {{do not include}} the unscattered beam (which will appear up at {{the focal point of the}} lens), then the image will appear dark wherever no sample scattering to the selected peak is present, as such a region without a specimen will appear dark. This is known as a <b>dark-field</b> image.|$|E
25|$|By {{recording}} several images {{at different}} detuning angles, meaning at different {{positions on the}} rocking curve, a data set is gained which allows the retrieval of quantitative differential phase information. There are several algorithms to reconstruct information from the rocking curves, some of them provide an additional signal. This signal comes from Ultra-small-angle scattering by sub-pixel sample structures and causes angular broadening of the beam and hence a broadening of {{the shape of the}} rocking curve. Based on this scattering contrast a new kind of image called <b>Dark-field</b> image can be produced.|$|E
25|$|An {{electron}} microscope is a microscope {{that uses a}} beam of accelerated electrons {{as a source of}} illumination. As the wavelength of an electron can be up to 100,000 times shorter than that of visible light photons, {{electron microscope}}s have a higher resolving power than light microscopes and can reveal the structure of smaller objects. A scanning transmission electron microscope has achieved better than 50pm resolution in annular <b>dark-field</b> imaging mode and magnifications of up to about 10,000,000x whereas most light microscopes are limited by diffraction to about 200nm resolution and useful magnifications below 2000x.|$|E
25|$|The STEM rasters {{a focused}} {{incident}} probe across a specimen that (as with the TEM) has been thinned to facilitate detection of electrons scattered through the specimen. The high {{resolution of the}} TEM is thus possible in STEM. The focusing action (and aberrations) occur before the electrons hit the specimen in the STEM, but afterward in the TEM. The STEMs use of SEM-like beam rastering simplifies annular <b>dark-field</b> imaging, and other analytical techniques, but also means that image data is acquired in serial rather than in parallel fashion. Often TEM can be equipped with the scanning option and then it can function both as TEM and STEM.|$|E
25|$|With the {{development}} of TEM, the associated technique of {{scanning transmission electron microscopy}} (STEM) was re-investigated and did not become developed until the 1970s, with Albert Crewe at the University of Chicago developing the field emission gun and adding a high quality objective lens to create the modern STEM. Using this design, Crewe demonstrated the ability to image atoms using annular <b>dark-field</b> imaging. Crewe and coworkers at the University of Chicago developed the cold field electron emission source and built a STEM able to visualize single heavy atoms on thin carbon substrates. In 2008, Jannick Meyer et al. described the direct visualization of light atoms such as carbon and even hydrogen using TEM and a clean single-layer graphene substrate.|$|E

2500|$|An {{alternative}} {{approach is the}} retrieval of the differential phase by using Moiré fringes. These are created as a superposition of the self-image of G1 and the pattern of G2 by using gratings with the same periodicity and inclining G2 against G1 regarding to the optical axis with a very small angle(<<1). This moiré fringes act as carrier fringes {{because they have a}} much larger spacing/period (smaller spatial frequency) than the Talbot fringes and thus the phase gradient introduced by the sample can be detected as the displacement of the Moiré fringes. [...] With a Fourier analysis of the Moiré pattern the absorption and <b>dark-field</b> signal can also be extracted.|$|E
2500|$|In 2006, {{another great}} {{advancement}} was {{the transfer of}} the grating-based technique to conventional laboratory X-ray tubes by Franz Pfeiffer and co-workers, which fairly enlarged the technique's potential for clinical use. About two years later the group of Franz Pfeiffer also accomplished to extract a supplementary signal from their experiments; the so-called [...] "dark-field signal" [...] was caused by scattering due to the porous microstructure of the sample and provided [...] "complementary and otherwise inaccessible structural information about the specimen at the micrometer and submicrometer length scale". At the same time, Han Wen and co-workers at the US National Institutes of Health arrived at a much simplified grating technique to obtain the scattering (“dark-field”) image. They used a single projection of a grid and a new approach for signal extraction named [...] "single-shot Fourier analysis". Recently, a lot of research was done to improve the grating-based technique: Han Wen and his team analyzed animal bones and found out that the intensity of the <b>dark-field</b> signal depends on the orientation of the grid and {{this is due to the}} anisotropy of the bone structure. They made significant progress towards biomedical applications by replacing mechanical scanning of the gratings with electronic scanning of the X-ray source. The grating-based phase-contrast CT field was extended by tomographic images of the <b>dark-field</b> signal and time-resolved phase-contrast CT. Furthermore, the first pre-clinical studies using grating-based phase-contrast X-ray imaging were published. Marco Stampanoni and his group examined native breast tissue with [...] "differential phase-contrast mammography", and a team led by Dan Stutman investigated how to use grating-based imaging for the small joints of the hand.|$|E
2500|$|In {{order to}} {{separate}} the phase information from other contributions to the signal, a technique called [...] "phase-stepping" [...] is used. One of the gratings is scanned along the transverse direction term [...] over one period of the grating, and for different positions of the grating an image is taken. The intensity signal in each pixel in the detector plane oscillates {{as a function of}} [...] The recorded intensity oscillation can be represented by a Fourier series and by recording and comparing these intensity oscillations with or without the sample the separated differential phase shift and absorption signal relative to the reference image can be extracted. As in ABI an additional signal coming from Ultra-small-angle scattering by sub-pixel microstructures of the sample, called <b>dark-field</b> contrast, can also be reconstructed. This method provides high spatial resolution, but also requires long exposure times.|$|E
50|$|Annular <b>dark-field</b> imaging is {{a method}} of mapping samples in a {{scanning}} transmission electron microscope (STEM). These images are formed by collecting scattered electrons with an annular <b>dark-field</b> detector.|$|E
50|$|The main {{limitation}} of <b>dark-field</b> microscopy is the low light levels {{seen in the}} final image. This means that the sample must be very strongly illuminated, which can cause damage to the sample. <b>Dark-field</b> microscopy techniques are almost entirely free of artifacts, {{due to the nature}} of the process. However, the interpretation of <b>dark-field</b> images must be done with great care, as common dark features of bright-field microscopy images may be invisible, and vice versa.|$|E

50|$|While the <b>dark-field</b> image may first {{appear to}} be a {{negative}} of the bright-field image, different effects are visible in each. In bright-field microscopy, features are visible where either a shadow is cast on the surface by the incident light or a part of the surface is less reflective, possibly by the presence of pits or scratches. Raised features that are too smooth to cast shadows will not appear in bright-field images, but the light that reflects off the sides of the feature will be visible in the <b>dark-field</b> images.|$|E

5000|$|Annular <b>dark-field</b> imaging {{measures}} the scattering of electrons as they deflect off the nuclei of the {{atoms in the}} transmission electron microscopy sample.

The technique {{has been used to}} image atoms as light as boron, nitrogen, and carbon; however, the signal is very weak for such light atoms. If annular <b>dark-field</b> microscopy is put to use for transmission electron microscopy DNA sequencing, it will certainly be necessary to label the DNA bases with heavy atoms so that a strong signal can be detected.|$|E

50|$|Weak-beam imaging {{involves}} optics {{similar to}} conventional <b>dark-field,</b> but {{use of a}} diffracted beam harmonic rather than the diffracted beam itself. Much higher resolution of strained regions around defects can be obtained in this way.|$|E

5000|$|Most LOM {{observations}} are conducted using bright-field (BF) illumination, where {{the image of}} any flat feature perpendicular to the incident light path is bright, or appears to be white. But, other illumination methods can be used and, in some cases, may provide superior images with greater detail. <b>Dark-field</b> microscopy (DF), is an alternative method of observation that provides high-contrast images and actually greater resolution than bright-field. In <b>dark-field</b> illumination, the light from features perpendicular to the optical axis is blocked and appears dark while the light from features inclined to the surface, which look dark in BF, appear bright, or [...] "self-luminous" [...] in DF. Grain boundaries, for example, are more vivid in DF than BF.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dark-field</b> {{microscopy}} (dark-ground microscopy) describes microscopy methods, in both {{light and}} electron microscopy, which exclude the unscattered beam from the image.
