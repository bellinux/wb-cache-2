An increase in molar mass of PET due to post-polycondensation and/or transesterfication during drawing at a high temperature of 160 to 230 °C was found. Moreover, <b>drawing</b> <b>leads</b> to crystallization and large orientation in the amorphous phase, which results in lower molecular mobility and prevents a further growth in chain length.
