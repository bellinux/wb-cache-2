60|$|Will they be {{satisfied}} if the Territories be unconditionally surrendered to them? We {{know they will}} not. In all their present complaints against us, the Territories are scarcely mentioned. <b>Invasions</b> <b>and</b> insurrections are the rage now. Will it satisfy them if, in the future, {{we have nothing to}} do with <b>invasions</b> <b>and</b> insurrections? We know it will not. We so know, because we know we never had anything to do with <b>invasions</b> <b>and</b> insurrections; and yet this total abstaining does not exempt us from the charge and the denunciation.|$|R

5|$|Indonesia used fear of {{communism}} to garner {{varying degrees of}} support among western countries, including the United States and Australia, for its East Timor <b>invasion</b> <b>and</b> occupation. The <b>invasion</b> <b>and</b> suppression of East Timor's independence movement caused great harm to Indonesia's reputation and international credibility. Criticism from the developing world undermined efforts in the 1980s to secure the Non-Aligned Movement chair which Suharto strongly desired for Indonesia and condemnation of Indonesia continued through the 1990s.|$|E

5|$|A {{measure of}} William's success in taking control is that, from 1072 until the Capetian conquest of Normandy in 1204, William and his successors were largely {{absentee}} rulers. For example, after 1072, William {{spent more than}} 75 per cent {{of his time in}} France rather than England. While he needed to be personally present in Normandy to defend the realm from foreign <b>invasion</b> <b>and</b> put down internal revolts, he set up royal administrative structures that enabled him to rule England from a distance.|$|E
5|$|After Francia's death he was {{succeeded by}} Carlos Antonio López, (called ‘López I’ by some authors, a {{convenient}} if inaccurate designation), {{the father of}} Francisco Solano López (‘López II’). López I did open up Paraguay to foreign trade and technology, but the steamship made his country vulnerable to <b>invasion</b> <b>and</b> he understandably feared the machinations of his powerful neighbours.|$|E
5|$|After an {{incident}} involving sentries on the Greek-Bulgarian border in October 1925, fighting began {{between the two}} countries. Three days after the initial incident, Greek troops invaded Bulgaria. The Bulgarian government ordered its troops to make only token resistance, and evacuated between ten thousand and fifteen thousand people from the border region, trusting the League to settle the dispute. The League condemned the Greek <b>invasion,</b> <b>and</b> called for both Greek withdrawal and compensation to Bulgaria.|$|E

After the Japanese surrender on September 1945, Chin Kang Huay Kuan resumed its normal activities of running welfare programmes for needy clan members and organising cultural events.|$|E
5|$|Among the Normans who {{returned}} to their holdings was Walter de Clifford, who reclaimed Cantref Bychan, then invaded Rhys's lands in Cantref Mawr. An appeal to the king produced no response, and Rhys resorted to arms, first capturing Clifford's castle at Llandovery then seizing Ceredigion. King Henry responded by preparing another <b>invasion,</b> <b>and</b> Rhys submitted without resistance. He was obliged to give hostages, probably including his son Hywel.|$|E

5|$|Exocytosis in prokaryotes: Membrane {{vesicular}} exocytosis, {{popularly known}} as membrane vesicle trafficking, a Nobel prize-winning (year, 2013) process, is traditionally regarded as a prerogative of eukaryotic cells. This myth was however broken with the revelation that nanovesicles, {{popularly known as}} bacterial outer membrane vesicles, released by gram-negative microbes, translocate bacterial signal molecules to host or target cells to carry out multiple processes in favour of the secreting microbe e.g., in host cell <b>invasion</b> <b>and</b> microbe-environment interactions, in general.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{invasion}} of the South Korea by North Korea, and the subsequent outbreak of the Korean War on June 25, 1950, the United Nations decided to enter the conflict on behalf of South Korea.
