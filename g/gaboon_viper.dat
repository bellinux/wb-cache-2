500|$|Snakes {{have been}} a motif in human culture and {{religion}} and an object of dread and fascination all over the world. The vivid patterns of snake scales, such as the <b>Gaboon</b> <b>Viper,</b> both repel and fascinate the human mind. Such patterns have inspired dread and awe in humans from pre-historic times and these {{can be seen in}} the art prevalent to those times. [...] Studies of fear imagery and psychological arousal indicate that snake scales are a vital component of snake imagery. Snake scales also appear to have affected Islamic art in the form of tessallated mosaic patterns which show great similarity to snake-scale patterns.|$|E
2500|$|Located {{across from}} the Tropical Bird House, the herpetarium {{is home to the}} zoo's snakes, American alligators, lizards, and frogs. [...] It {{includes}} the rare Louisiana pine snake in addition {{to some of the most}} venomous snakes in the world, including the green mamba and <b>Gaboon</b> <b>viper.</b> It is home to an alligator snapping turtle. In a seasonal exhibit, a simulated shallow pond provides favorable breeding habitat for the highly endangered Mississippi gopher frog; this exhibit also features a slide presentation describing the zoo's participation in the frog's recovery program.|$|E
2500|$|The zoo's reptile and {{amphibian}} house exhibits seventy {{species of}} reptiles and amphibians. These include [...] Aldabra tortoises, radiated tortoises, spider tortoises, Cuban crocodiles, a Gharial, a Philippine crocodile, Eastern indigo snakes, <b>Gaboon</b> <b>vipers,</b> gila monsters, green anacondas, [...] Burmese rock pythons, green tree pythons, Timor pythons, king cobras, northern copperheads, Eastern diamondback rattlesnakes, hellbenders, [...] eastern red-backed salamanders, [...] long-tailed salamanders, Alligator snapping turtles and many more.|$|R
50|$|In 1992 Tom {{was charged}} with {{illegally}} importing reptiles. The charge {{had little effect on}} business as that same year he imported sixteen <b>Gaboon</b> <b>vipers</b> and fourteen Burmese pythons via the Montgomery Zoo. Later, in 1995, Tom was convicted a second time, of illegally smuggling Fiji Banded Iguanas into the United States. The case was tried in district court after complaints that the prosecutor's dissection of Penny Crutchfield's, Tom's wife, sexual behavior was irrelevant in a case about illegally importing iguanas.|$|R
5000|$|A {{study by}} Marsh and Whaler (1984) {{reported}} a maximum yield of 9.7 ml of wet venom, which translated to 2400 mg of dried venom. They attached [...] "alligator" [...] clip electrodes to {{the angle of}} the open jaw of anesthetized specimens (length 133-136 cm, girth 23-25 cm, weight 1.3-3.4 kg), yielding 1.3-7.6 ml (mean 4.4 ml) of venom. Two to three electrical bursts within a space of five seconds apart were enough to empty the venom glands. The <b>Gaboon</b> <b>vipers</b> used for the study were milked between seven and 11 times over a 12-month period, during which they remained in good health and the potency of their venom remained the same.|$|R

5000|$|Primarily nocturnal, <b>Gaboon</b> <b>vipers</b> have a {{reputation}} for being slow-moving and placid. They usually hunt by ambush, often spending long periods motionless, waiting for suitable prey to pass by. On the other hand, they have been known to hunt actively, mostly during the first six hours of the night. In Kumasi, Ghana, they were regularly killed around some stables in an open area with the forest some 500 meters away — a sign that they were hunting rats in the grassland. They are usually very tolerant snakes, even when handled, and rarely bite or hiss, unlike most vipers. However, bites by bad-tempered individuals do occur.Locomotion is mostly rectilinear, in a sluggish [...] "walking" [...] motion of the ventral scales. They may writhe from side to side when alarmed, but only for short distances. Ditmars (1933) even described them as being capable of sidewinding.|$|R
25|$|Formerly {{the camel}} house, this {{enclosure}} adjoining the giraffe house was remodelled in 2006 to house okapi. Initially two males were kept: Dicky arrived from Marwell Wildlife in 2005 and Mbuti came from Bristol Zoo {{in the same}} year. In 2006 Dicky left for London Zoo {{to make way for}} a female named Stuma from Germany. In 2009 Mbuti and Dicky were swapped back, with Mbuti going to London Zoo and Dicky coming back to Chester. Other animals that can be seen here include Red forest duikers, Gambian pouched rats, butterfly barbs, <b>Gaboon</b> <b>vipers</b> and short-eared elephant shrews. Mount Kulal spiny mice and Mesic four-striped grass mice have also been kept here in the past along with various other small species. The Okapi bred for the first time in 2012, producing a female calf named Tafari. The success was repeated in 2014 with the birth of a new male calf.|$|R
50|$|Mandrills are preyed on {{mainly by}} leopards. Additional predators known to attack both adult and young mandrills include crowned eagles and African rock pythons. They may be bitten {{and killed by}} <b>Gaboon</b> <b>vipers</b> when they accidentally rouse the venomous snake. It is thought that most predators are a threat mainly to young mandrills, with the {{likelihood}} of predation decreasing in adult females and especially adult males, which may be invulnerable to all but the seldom ambush by a leopard. In a study where a mandrill troop was exposed to stimuli relating to their natural predators, only the leopard caused the larger {{part of the group}} to flee into trees. However, the large, dominant males were observed to remain in response to the images of the natural predators, even the leopard, and pace back and forth whilst baring their teeth, generally indicating aggression and the defensive role they may play in such circumstances.|$|R

40|$|International audienceHabitat type, {{predation}} {{pressure and}} reproductive interests are all thought {{to determine the}} anti-predator behaviour of non-primates, but only few systematic studies exist. Here, we experimentally elicited anti-predator behaviour in six different groups of forest-living Campbell's monkeys, using visual and acoustic models of leopards, crowned eagles, and snakes. Individuals produced a variety of anti-predator behaviours, {{depending on the type}} of predator and whether or not it was visible. Adult males generally behaved conspicuously, either by attacking eagles or producing threat behaviours at a distance to leopards. Adult females remained cryptic to eagles, but joined their male in approaching leopards. To snakes, both males and females responded strongly to familiar <b>Gaboon</b> <b>vipers,</b> but far less to unfamiliar black mambas. Finally, if a predator could only be heard, both males and females produced fewer alarm calls and often changed their vertical position in the canopy (upwards for leopards; downwards for eagles), despite all predator vocalisations being presented from the ground. We concluded that Campbell's monkeys display sex-specific anti-predator behaviours, which are largely driven by the predators' hunting techniques, mode of predator detection and the forest habitat structur...|$|R
50|$|One of {{the newer}} and more famous {{residents}} of this exhibit is the Komodo dragon. Many other animals are also housed here, including the beaded lizard, Gila monster, green anaconda, reticulated python, <b>gaboon</b> <b>viper,</b> rattlesnake, caiman, and quite a few other reptiles and amphibians.|$|E
5000|$|Mostly unknown, its {{behavior}} {{is assumed to}} be terrestrial and nocturnal. In 1995, the only living specimen known was less irritable than the typical puff adder (B. arietans) and was not inclined to strike. However, it hissed when teased and struggled [...] "furiously" [...] when restrained, suggesting its temperament may be {{similar to that of the}} <b>Gaboon</b> <b>viper</b> (B. gabonica).|$|E
50|$|The <b>Gaboon</b> <b>viper</b> {{is usually}} found in rainforests and nearby woodlands, mainly at low altitudes, but {{sometimes}} {{as high as}} 1500 m. Spawls et al. (2004) mention a maximum altitude of 2100 m. According to Broadley and Cock (1975), it is generally found in environments that are parallel to those occupied by its close relative, B. arietans, which is normally found in more open country.|$|E
50|$|Bitis gabonica, most {{commonly}} known as the <b>Gaboon</b> <b>viper,</b> is a viper species found in the rainforests and savannas of sub-Saharan Africa. Like all vipers, it is venomous. It is not only the largest member of the genus Bitis, but also the world's heaviest viperid, and it has the longest fangs - up to 2 inches in length (5 cm) - and the highest venom yield of any snake. Two subspecies are currently recognized, including the nominate subspecies described here.|$|E

50|$|The {{strength}} of venom differs markedly between species {{and even more}} so between families, as measured by median lethal dose (LD50) in mice. Subcutaneous LD50 varies by over 140-fold within elapids and by more than 100-fold in vipers. The amount of venom produced also differs among species, with the <b>Gaboon</b> <b>viper</b> able to potentially deliver from 450-600 milligrams of venom in a single bite, the most of any snake. Opisthoglyphous colubrids have venom ranging from life-threatening (in the case of the boomslang) to barely noticeable (as in Tantilla).|$|E
50|$|Bites {{from this}} species are rare, {{due to their}} {{extremely}} unaggressive nature and because their range is limited to rainforest areas. Due to their sluggishness and unwillingness to move even when approached, bites most often occur due to persons accidentally stepping on a <b>Gaboon</b> <b>viper,</b> but even then in some cases this does not guarantee a bite. However, when a bite does occur, it should always be considered a serious medical emergency. Even an average bite from an average-sized specimen is potentially fatal. Antivenom should be administered {{as soon as possible}} to save the victim's life if not the affected limb.|$|E
5000|$|Perkins was {{the host}} of Zoo Parade, a {{television}} program that originated from the Lincoln Park Zoo on NBC station WNBQ-TV (now WMAQ-TV) {{when he was the}} director there. During a rehearsal of Zoo Parade, he was bitten by a timber rattlesnake, one of several bites from venomous snakes Perkins suffered throughout his career (over the years he was also bitten by a cottonmouth and a <b>Gaboon</b> <b>viper).</b> Although the incident occurred during a pre-show rehearsal and was not filmed, it has become something of an urban legend, with many people [...] "remembering" [...] seeing Perkins receive the bite on television.|$|E

50|$|A {{majority}} of the collections within the Museum are items gathered from various tribes within Kenya such as the Luyha, Maasai and the Turkana. The museum displays their traditional Kenyan homes, weaponry, utensils and native musical instruments. The museum also includes a nature trail, which was created in 1977 and is located towards {{the back of the}} museum. This nature trail conserves various rare plants and animals. It is a serene makeshift rainforest that allows visitors of the museum to experience what it’s like to be inside an actual Kenyan rainforest. The museum also holds animals such as Nile Crocodiles , Leopard Tortoises and various poisonous snakes such as the Puff Adder, Rock Python, <b>Gaboon</b> <b>Viper</b> and the Rhinoceros Viper.|$|E
50|$|This is {{the largest}} {{rattlesnake}} species and is the heaviest known type of venomous snake, with one specimen shot in 1946 measuring 7.8 ft in length and weighing 15.4 kg. However, other venomous snakes may rival this species in weight, the much longer but more slender king cobra is probably greater in average body mass if not maximum weight and the shorter but even bulkier <b>gaboon</b> <b>viper</b> could (but is not verified to) exceed the rattlesnake in both mean adult body mass and possibly even maximum body mass. Maximum reported lengths for eastern diamondback rattlesnakes are 8 ft. and 8.25 ft. However, the stated maximum sizes have been called into question {{due to a lack}} of voucher specimens. Males are larger than females.|$|E
5000|$|The snake's {{cytotoxic}} venom {{itself is}} not considered particularly toxic based on tests conducted in mice. In mice, the [...] is 0.8-5.0 mg/kg IV, 2.0 mg/kg IP and 5.0-6.0 mg/kg SC. However, the venom glands are enormous and each bite produces the largest quantities of venom of any venomous snake; this is partially {{due to the fact}} that, unlike many African vipers such as the Puff Adder, the <b>Gaboon</b> <b>viper</b> does not release after a bite, which enables it to inject larger amounts of venom. Yield is probably related to body weight, as opposed to milking interval. Brown (1973) gives a venom yield range of 200-1000 mg (of dried venom), A range of 200-600 mg for specimens 125-155 cm in length has also been reported. Spawls and Branch (1995) state from 5 to 7 ml (450-600 mg) of venom may be injected in a single bite.|$|E
50|$|Bitis nasicornis is {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} most dangerous snakes of Africa. Small doses of the snake's primarily hemotoxic venom can be deadly. This is unlike the <b>Gaboon</b> <b>viper,</b> the largest of the vipers, which uses a considerably larger amount of venom. Bitis nasicornis has both neurotoxic, as well as hemotoxic venom, as do most other venomous snakes. The hemotoxic venom in rhinoceros vipers is much more dominant. This venom attacks the circulatory system of the snake's victim, destroying tissue and blood vessels. Internal bleeding also occurs. When not in use, the rhino viper's fangs are folded up into the roof of the snake's mouth. The snake has the ability to control the movement of its fangs. Simply because the rhino viper may open its mouth does not mean that the fangs will flip down into place. These fangs penetrate deep into the victim and the small doses of venom flow through the hollow fangs into the wound.|$|E
50|$|Adults vary {{in length}} from 2 to 3 m, {{although}} some may grow {{to as much}} as 4 m. The largest known specimen was just under 4.5 m, making it the longest venomous snake in the Western Hemisphere. Bushmasters are the longest type of viper in the world. L. muta is possibly the largest of the three species currently recognized, although more scant information suggest L. stenophrys broadly overlaps in size and may average at a similar size, while L. melanocephala is slightly smaller than the other two species. Although they are not the heaviest vipers, being surpassed in mass by the <b>gaboon</b> <b>viper</b> and the Eastern diamondback rattlesnake, large adults still can weigh up to 3 to 7 kg. Bushmasters are sexually dimorphic in size, with males reaching larger sizes than females. The bushmaster's tail ends with a horny spine which it sometimes vibrates when disturbed {{in a manner similar to}} rattlesnakes. This led to some calling it 'the mute rattlesnake'.|$|E
50|$|The {{king cobra}} averages at 3 to 4 m {{in length and}} {{typically}} weighs about 6 kg. The longest known specimen was kept captive at the London Zoo, and grew to around 18.5 to 18.8 ft before being euthanised upon the outbreak of World War II. The heaviest wild specimen was caught at Royal Island Club in Singapore in 1951, which weighed 12 kg and measured 4.8 m, though an even heavier captive specimen was kept at New York Zoological Park and was measured as 12.7 kg at 4.4 m long in 1972. King cobras are sexually dimorphic in size, with males reaching larger sizes than females, which is an unusual trait among snakes whose females are usually larger than males. The length and mass of the snakes highly depend on their localities and some other factors. Despite their large sizes, typical king cobras are fast and agile. Some viper species, such as the eastern diamondback rattlesnake and the <b>Gaboon</b> <b>viper,</b> often much shorter in length but bulkier in build, rival the king cobra in average weight and reportedly best them in maximum weight.|$|E
40|$|The {{action of}} the venom of the <b>gaboon</b> <b>viper</b> (Bitis gabonica) on blood coagulation, platelets, and the fibrinolytic enzyme system was studied. The results confirm that the venom of Bitis gabonica has a marked {{anticoagulant}} action in vitro. The venom appears to impair clot formation by a direct proteolytic action on fibrinogen, releasing soluble breakdown products...|$|E
40|$|The {{characters}} {{which serve}} {{to distinguish the}} <b>Gaboon</b> <b>Viper</b> (Bitis gabonica) from the Rhinoceros Viper (B. nasicornis) are examined {{in relation to a}} subadult female from Dabocrom, Ghana, which displays characters of both species. It is more like B. nasicornis than B. gabonica but the admixture of B. gabonica characters is probably the result of interbreeding...|$|E
40|$|The {{digestion}} and {{absorption of}} collagen, native and artificially cross-linked, has been {{examined in the}} rat and the <b>Gaboon</b> <b>viper,</b> by feeding known quantities and measuring the hydroxy-proline content of the faeces and {{of the contents of}} the gut at different levels, and comparing with an unabsorbable marker (polyethylene glycol). Incubation of collagen in vitro with pepsin at 37 degrees C at pH 1. 5 followed by trypsin or chymotrypsin converted about 40 % into dialysable material...|$|E
40|$|Plasma iron {{turnover}} (PIT) {{has been}} measured {{by means of}} 59 Fe in rats treated with the haemorrhagic venom of the <b>Gaboon</b> <b>viper</b> (Bitis gabonica). Venom was administered on 3 occasions {{over a period of}} 9 days and after this time PIT had fallen from 1045 micrograms/kg/day in normal animals to 449 micrograms/kg/day in envenomated animals. Plasma iron half-life was markedly increased from 64. 8 min to 417. 6 min and this change was associated with a reduced uptake of 59 Fe by the liver. However, marrow and spleen uptake of 59 Fe was normal, as were the red-cell indices, MCH, MCV and MCHC. There was a slight reduction in total red-cell numbers and haemoglobin concentration {{as a result of the}} mild internal haemorrhage induced by the venom. It is concluded that <b>Gaboon</b> <b>viper</b> venom produces a marked disturbance of iron handling by the liver without an associated change in erythropoiesis. The mild haemorrhage was insufficient to produce a microcytic hypochromic anaemia. The results of the study provide further confirmation of the belief that standard ferrokinetic measurements give only limited information on erythropoietic status...|$|E
