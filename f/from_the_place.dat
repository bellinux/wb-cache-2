5|$|A rough collie named Lad {{lives at}} the Place with his Master, Mistress, and his mate, Lady. When Knave, a younger collie, is boarded at the Place, Lady begins {{ignoring}} Lad {{in favor of the}} newcomer. During a romp in the forest with Knave, Lady is caught in a leghold trap. Knave leaves her there and returns home but Lad finds her. Several days later, the still limping Lady accidentally gets locked in the library and is subsequently blamed for the destruction of the Master's beloved mounted bald eagle. The Master starts to whip her, but Lad intervenes and takes the whipping himself, knowing Knave was the culprit. Later, he attacks Knave for getting Lady in trouble, sending him fleeing <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Place.</b> As the Master apologizes to Lad, Lady lovingly licks his wounds from the fight.|$|E
5|$|In June 2010, Jack Thorpe filed {{a federal}} {{lawsuit against the}} borough of Jim Thorpe, seeking to have his father's remains {{returned}} to his homeland and re-interred near other family members in Oklahoma. Citing the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, Jack was arguing to bring his father's remains to the reservation in Oklahoma, {{where they would be}} buried near those of his father, sisters and brother, a mile <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> he was born. He claimed that the agreement between his stepmother and Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania, borough officials was made against the wishes of other family members who want him buried in Native American land. Jack Thorpe died at 73 on February 22, 2011.|$|E

25|$|Despite its {{prominence}} as a San Francisco landmark, no {{primary source}} {{has been found}} that clearly identifies the origin of the Conservatory of Flowers. Contributing to the confusion is erroneous information, based upon misunderstanding of the building or a cursory review of historic documentation that has appeared in print. Some historic documentation infers that the building was imported. Since it was common for conservatories to be shipped far <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> of manufacture, one could be led to conclude that this {{was the case with the}} Conservatory of Flowers. However, there is no historic information to substantiate the importation of the structure.|$|E
25|$|In {{the morning}} of 18 July 2013 at 8:20a.m. (2320 GMT) small amounts of steam escaped from the reactor building. Video images made by a subcontractor, filming the {{destroyed}} building and preparing to remove rubble <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>place,</b> showed some vapors rising, but it was unclear where it came from. Although there was {{no change in the}} afternoon, TEPCO said that radiation levels did not change, and the reactor was still cooled. According to TEPCO rain could have found its way to the primary containment of the reactor, and because this vessel was still hot, it could cause the steam.|$|E
25|$|The Keelmen of Tyne and Wear were a {{group of}} men who worked on the keels, large boats that carried the coal from the banks of both rivers to the waiting collier ships. Because of the shallowness of both rivers, it was {{difficult}} for ships of any significant draught to move up river and load with coal <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> where the coal reached the riverside. Thus the need for shallow-draught keels to transport the coal to the waiting ships. The keelmen formed a close-knit and colourful community on both rivers until their eventual demise late in the nineteenth century.|$|E

25|$|The largest {{variety of}} {{surnames}} {{is found in}} the states of Maharashtra and Goa, which numbers more than the rest of India together. Here surnames are placed last, the order being: the given name, followed by the father's name, followed by the family name. The majority of surnames are derived <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> where the family lived, with the 'ker' (Marathi) or 'Kar'(Konkani) suffix, for example, Mumbaiker, Puneker, Aurangabadker or Tendulkar, Parrikar, Mangeshkar, Mahendrakar. Another common variety found in Maharashtra and Goa are the ones ending in 'e'. These are usually more archaic than the 'Kar's and usually denote medieval clans or professions like Rane, Salunkhe, Gupte, Bhonsle, Ranadive, Rahane, Hazare, Apte, Satpute, Shinde, Sathe, Londhe, Salve, Kale, Gore, Godbole, etc.|$|E
25|$|In the Basque {{provinces of}} Biscay and Gipuzkoa, it was {{uncommon}} {{to take a}} surname <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> (town or village) where one resided, unless one was a foundling; in general, people bearing surnames such as Bilbao (after the Basque city of Bilbao) are descendants of foundlings. However, in the Basque province of Alava and, to a lesser extent, in Navarre, it was common to add one's birth village to the surname using the Spanish particle de to denote a toponymic, particularly when the surname was a common one; for instance, someone whose surname was Lopez and whose family was originally from the valley of Ayala could employ Lopez de Ayala as a surname. This latter practice is also common in Castile.|$|E
25|$|Outdoor or field polo {{consists}} of four to eight 7-minute chukkas, between or during which players change mounts. At {{the end of each}} 7 minute chukka, play continues for an additional 30 seconds or until a stoppage in play, whichever comes first. There is a four-minute interval between chukkas and a ten-minute halftime. Play is continuous and is only stopped for penalties, broken tack (equipment) or injury to horse or player. The object is to score goals by hitting the ball between the goal posts, no matter how high in the air. If the ball goes wide of the goal, the defending team is allowed a free 'knock-in' <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> where the ball crossed the goal line, thus getting ball back into play.|$|E
