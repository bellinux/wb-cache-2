40|$|This {{study has}} been carried out between September 2004 and April 2006 at 8 {{different}} stations located within the fishing zone of the Keban Dam Lake Cemisgezek Fishery Cooperative (Elazig/Turkey). In order to identify the effect of colored gill nets in fish catching in the Keban Dam lake, nets of 40 mm mesh size were colored green, blue, burgundy and black and these 4 different colored, same mesh size nets were equipped with 0. 50 and 0. 67 hanging ratios, totaling up to 8 nets of different configurations. During the 2 years research, a total of 1169 fish were caught, 606 of which were caught in the monofilament gill nets with 0. 50 <b>hanging</b> <b>ratio</b> and the remaining 563 caught in the monofilament gill nets with 0. 67 <b>hanging</b> <b>ratio.</b> The fish caught in the nets were classified according to the <b>hanging</b> <b>ratio,</b> mesh size and the color of the nets. Then the total sizes of the fish were measured and they were weighed; lastly, the mean fish length and weight as well as the standard deviation from these mean values were calculated and recorded. The statistical relation between the fish populations caught with nets possessing differing mesh size, color and <b>hanging</b> <b>ratio</b> properties were compared using the χ 2 -test. The material color of the gill nets was found to be effective on the catch efficiency. Barbus rajanorum mystaceus and Capoeta trutta (Cyprinidae) were caught in black and green nets with 0. 40 mm mesh size and 0. 50 <b>hanging</b> <b>ratio</b> while mostly B. esocinus and B. xanthopterus (Cyprinidae) were caught in the blue nets with the same mesh size and 0. 67 <b>hanging</b> <b>ratio.</b> In conclusion, it is determined that black gill nets can be used for Capoeta trutta, burgundy for carp, green for Barbus rajanorum mystaceus and blue for barbell in Keban Dam lake in Cemisgezek district...|$|E

40|$|A modern {{methodology}} {{has been}} proposed for the system design of dynamic behavior {{in order to provide}} the accurate pertinent analysis of CoalBed Methane (CBM) pumping installations. Dynamic hanging loads on polished rod can fully reflect the kinematic and dynamic characteristics of CBM pumping installations due to their combined action of the inertial hanging loads with the loads generated by vibration and hydrodynamic friction phenomena. The practical dynamometer cards were determined by computing dynamic hanging loads with the increments of stroke length. The interpretations of results show that the maximum errors of within 2 % between the calculated and measured values are obtained with the comparison of calculated hanging loads by American Petroleum Institute (API), Schafer, Gibbs and proposed method. The ratios of inertial and vibration to polished-rod load are relatively high in producing CBM wells and calculated to be 10 % and 8 %, respectively. And the inertial and vibration <b>hanging</b> load <b>ratios</b> decrease rapidly for two-phase CBM wells. Moreover, the effect of friction loadings on polished rod is more obvious than that of inertial and vibration hanging loads for single-phase gas CBM wells. The total deformations of rod string and tubing are within 15 % of polished-rod stroke length in producing CBM wells. And the dynamic loadings enhance the imbalance of hanging loads and improve the power consumption of CBM pumping installations. The total hanging loads on polished rod are variable in a large scale for the pumping prophase and single-phase water CBM wells and the variation range of dynamic hanging loads is much lower for the two-phase and single-phase gas CBM wells...|$|R

40|$|In {{an attempt}} to improve {{selection}} and engineering efficiency in an Australian penaeid fishery, the mesh size and side taper of a generic trawl design were reduced (from 41 to 35. mm) and increased (from 1 N 3 B to 1 N 5 B), respectively and, within the revised design, the independent and combined utility of (i) increasing the frame-line <b>hanging</b> <b>ratio,</b> and (ii) replacing the diamond-orientated wing/side panel with square-orientated mesh were investigated. Compared to the 41 -mm mesh conventional trawl, all of four smaller-meshed designs (comprising either loose or tight hanging ratios, and with diamond- or square-mesh wing/side panels) had lower drag (9 - 12 %) and required less fuel (up to 4 - 12 %). Some of the small-meshed trawls caught fewer unwanted fish-attributed to the steeper side panels allowing individuals to swim forward and escape. Within the small-mesh trawls, there were incremental improvements in size selectivity for the targeted school prawns, Metapenaeus macleayi associated with both modifications. But the square-mesh wing/side panels were {{by far the most}} effective, reducing the catches of sub-commercial school prawns by up to 72 %. The results support simple, retrospectively fitted alterations to existing penaeid-trawl bodies to improve selection and efficiency...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{velocity}} around the conical net in the flume tank at the Faculty of Fisheries, Kagoshima University. Eight types of conical nets {{were used for the}} experiment; out of which four kinds were the same netting with different hanging angles, and the other four were the same <b>hanging</b> <b>ratio</b> with different nettings. The mouth of each net was attached to a circular shaped frame of the same dimension, and the test speed was 80 cm/s at a steady flow. The flow velocity in the test sections were measured with a hot film flow meter. The following results were obtained : 1) The velocity around the nets can be classified into 3 fields, inside net, in the boundary layer in which the flow is passed through a mesh hall and outside net. As the open area ratio (β) became smaller, the velocity of inside net increased but the velocity of boundary layer decreased. 2) The shape of conical net in a flow field depended on the mesh number rather than to the open area ratio of mesh. 3) The theoretical analysis was carried out on the continuity equation to derive an empirical equation for the average flow velocity on the cone type nets. ...|$|E
40|$|Experimental {{demersal}} gillnets and {{demersal longlines}} were deployed from research vessels {{on grounds of}} Mustelus antarcticus during 1973 – 76. Gillnet mesh-size had major effects on catch composition and catch rate, whereas gillnet <b>hanging</b> <b>ratio,</b> hook-size, hook shank-length and hook-spacing had minor effects. The gillnets and longlines were much more effective at catching chondrichthyans than teleosts, and catches of species of cephalopoda, bivalvia, gastropoda, mammalia, aves and reptilia were negligible. Any reduction in the present legal minimum mesh-size of 6 inch the shark fishery would markedly increase by-catch. In gillnets monitored by scientific observers aboard commercial vessels during 1998 – 01, {{the ratio of the}} number of chondrichthyan to teleost animals was ~ 24 : 1 in Bass Strait and ~ 5 : 1 in South Australia. In Bass Strait between 1973 – 76 and 1998 – 2001, the catch rate by 6 inch mesh gillnets of chondrichthyans declined by one-third, whereas a change in the catch rate of teleosts was not statistically detectable. Most of this decline is explained by reductions of 54 % by Cephaloscyllium laticeps and of 87 % by Galeorhinus galeus. The retained commercial catch was 74 % of the chondrichthyan animals and 58 % of the teleosts caught; only 3 % of the chondrichthyans and 2 % of the teleosts were discarded dead. There are occasional interactions with protected species (marine mammals and Carcharodon carcharias) ...|$|E
40|$|A {{strategy}} {{to overcome the}} lack of income obtained from the primary job as gillnet fishermen, households fishermen in the Asinan village have some alternative jobs such as agricultural labour, construction workers, farming, goat farming, trade, and ranching of fish cages. The purpose {{of this research was}} to analyze the level of primary and alternative income gillnet fishermen households in Asinan, Bawen, Semarang and was to determine the technical aspects of gillnet fishing gear which is used by fishermen in Asinan. The research method were descriptive method and case study. The sampling method was census by interviewing 64 fishermen as respondents. The results showed that the average primary income of gillnet fishermen per year was Rp 9, 600, 063. 00 and the average alternative income of gillnet fishermen per year was Rp 7, 129, 307. 00. The maximum average alternative income was Rp 31, 734, 333. 00 per year obtained from trade. The minimum average alternative income was Rp 3, 198, 890. 00 per year obtained from goat farming. Webbing was made from nylon (PA) monofilament with diameter 0. 12 mm; length 15 m; mesh size 7. 62 cm (3 inches); and height 78. 6 cm. The net had 91. 44 cm stretched height with 12 of vertical and 400 of horizontal meshes. <b>Hanging</b> <b>ratio</b> value was 0. 50 and 0. 50 for shortening. Head rope was made from PA monofilament with diameter 0. 5 mm, and length 15. 3 m per piece. Sinker line was made from PE multifilament with diameter 0. 2 mm and length 15 m per piece.

40|$|A {{survey was}} carried out in September 1996 {{alongside}} the annual frame survey of Kainji Lake, Nigeria. As in the previous surveys, there were 6 main fishing gear types in use on the lake, which included gill nets, drift nets, beach seines, cast nets, longlines (baited and foul hooking) acid fishing traps. A total of 813 canoes were sampled. The canoe lengths were similar to the previous gear surveys. Altogether 466 gill nets were measured. They had an average length of 149 m, and were mostly bottom set. Of the gill nets measured 68 % had a mesh size below 3 inches the minimum mesh size allowable according to the Niger and Kebbi State Fisheries Edict, 1996. Of concern was the large {{increase in the number of}} 1 inch meshed nets recorded on the lake. Drift nets had a mean length of 74 m. A total of 88 % of all drift nets measured had a mesh size below 2. 5 inches, the minimum mesh size stipulated in the State Edict. A total number of 102 beach seines were sampled with a mean length of 110 m, the mesh size in use on the lake remained as 0. 1 inches under the Edict beach seines are banned from fishing in Kainji Lake. The decline in the lengths of the beach seines (and therefore catch rates) recorded since l 995 was encouraging in the light of the destructive nature of these nets. A total of 30 cast nets were sampled, they had a mean diameter of 9. 8 and a mean mesh size of 1. 9 inches. All the nets had a <b>hanging</b> <b>ratio</b> of 0. 5. Of the cast nets measured 40 % had a mesh size below the minimum size of 2 inches recommended by the State Fisheries Edicts. Of concern was the continued rise in the number of gill nets with mesh sizes less than 2 inches. There were 2 types of longlines in operation on the lake. The baited and the foul hooking longlines. They were mostly bottom set and the hook size nos. 12 - 14 (Kirby sea hook) were predominant. Two types of fishing traps were identified, one was covered with a mesh of thin cane, one with netting material. The fishing traps had a mean height of 0. 8 m and a mean width at the vase of 0. 53 m. The mean mesh size used was 0. 86 inches. Citharinus was reported as the most targeted of all fish species on the lake. Synodontis membranaceous was also targeted by most gears especially the smaller meshed nets. Labeo and Tilapia were low on the list of targeted species but their incidence remains high in the catches. (PDF contains 27 pages...|$|E
40|$|Se evaluó la utilización de la malla de 50 mm (2 ”) en redes de cerco artesanal de la Región Tumbes en una pesquería multiespecífica. Se trabajó con una red control de tamaño de malla de 38 mm (1, 5 ”) y la red {{experimental}} de 50 mm (2, 0 ”), con un porcentaje de embande de 0, 65 y 0, 77, respectivamente. Se determinó diferencia entre las curvas de profundidad de calado del cuerpo central de las redes (tc= 46, 670, t*= 1, 98, p= 0) la red experimental tuvo mayor profundidad de velado; entre las curvas de velocidad de caída del cuerpo central de las redes, hubo {{diferencia significativa}} (tc= 7, 790, t*= 1, 98, p = 0, 000), debido al mayor lastre y filtrado de las mallas de la red experimental. El coeficiente abertura horizontal (μ 1) de las mallas en la franja superior durante el máximo velado de la red y el gareteo fue en las mallas del cabecero o copo, parte central y ultimo cuerpo de la red, en promedio 0, 71; 0, 74 y 0, 73 respectivamente; (valores cercanos al coeficiente de armado ideal para el escape de ciertos peces fusiformes). El promedio de μ 1 obtenidos en la región de las mallas centrales en el cabecero, centro y ultimo cuerpo de la red fue 0, 85; 0, 85 y 0, 84 respectivamente; lo que indicó una mayor abertura horizontal de las mallas por encima del valor del coeficiente de armado que no permitiría el escape de los peces. Se concluyó que por la condición de las mallas de la red de cerco experimental (tamaño de malla 50 mm) no es óptima para gran parte de la estructura de la red, esto no permitiría la selectividad por tamaños. ABSTRACT: In this paper, {{the use of}} mesh 50 mm (2 ”) in artisanal purse seiner of the Tumbes Region in a multispecies fishery was assessed. We worked with a control purse seiner of mesh size of 38 mm (1. 5 ”) and the experimental fishing net of 50 mm (2. 0 ”) with a percentage of <b>hanging</b> <b>ratio</b> of 0. 65 and 0. 77; respectively. Operational assessment of the purse seine was observed {{that there was a}} difference between the curves of setting depth of the central body of the net (tc = 46. 670, t* = 1. 98, p = 0), the experimental net had a more setting depth. Likewise between the curves drop speed of the central body of the purse seiners, {{there was a significant difference}} (tc = 7. 790, t* = 1. 98, p = 0) due to greater weight and filtering mesh of the experimental net. The horizontal opening (μ 1) of the meshes in the upper band for the maximum setting depth and purse line recovering, the meshes of cod end, middle part and last body of the net, was on average (μ 1) 0. 71, 0. 74 and 0. 73 respectively; (values close to the hanging coefficient ideal for escaping of fusiform fishes). The average (μ 1) obtained in the region of the central meshes in the cod end, middle part and last body of the net was 0. 85, 0. 85 and 0. 84 respectively; which indicated a greater horizontal opening of the mesh above the hanging coefficient would not allow the escape of fishes. It was concluded that the mesh condition of experimental net (mesh size 50 mm) is not optimal for large part of the net structure; this would not allow fish selectivity sizes.
