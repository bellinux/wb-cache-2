5|$|The castle's {{positioning}} {{may have}} been to allow its garrison to guard the Tame Valley; both castle and valley were in the medieval manor of Tintwistle. A manor was a <b>division</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> and administered by a Lord of the Manor or his representative; {{in the case of}} Tintwistle, {{it was part of the}} larger lordship of Longdendale.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 1848 <b>division</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> {{known as}} the Great Māhele, {{during the reign of}} Kamehameha III, all land in Hawaii was owned by the monarchy. The Great Māhele {{subdivided}} the land among the monarchy, the government, and acreage to allow private ownership by tenants living on the land. What was reserved for the monarchy became {{known as the}} Crown Lands of Hawaii. When Hawaii was annexed, the Crown Lands were seized by the United States government. The Queen gave George Macfarlane her power of attorney in 1898 as part of her legal defense team in seeking indemnity for the government's seizure of the Crown Lands. She filed a protest with the United States Senate on December 20, 1898, requesting their return and claiming the lands were seized without due process or recompense.|$|E
5|$|The {{economic}} situation improved {{with the arrival}} of cattle in the colony. It is unknown when the first cattle arrived, but the <b>division</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> for the grazing of cattle in 1627 represented one of the first moves towards private land ownership in the colony. Cattle became an important source of wealth in the colony; the average cow could sell for £28 in 1638 (£ in 2010, or $ at PPP). However, the flood of immigrants during the Great Migration drove the price of cattle down. The same cows sold at £28 in 1638 were valued in 1640 at only £5 (£ in 2010, or $ at PPP). Besides cattle, there were also pigs, sheep, and goats raised in the colony.|$|E

5|$|Castles {{can take}} several forms. The most common is the motte-and-bailey which {{consists}} of a motte (a mound)– surmounted by a keep or tower– connected to a bailey, an outer enclosure where the barracks and workshops were located. Other types of castle in Cheshire are ringworks and fortified manor houses. Ringworks are similar to motte-and-bailey castles but lack the motte; although contemporary with motte-and-baileys, they are an uncommon form of fortification. A ringwork may have been built rather than a motte-and-bailey because the soil was too thin to provide a proper motte or {{simply because of the}} preference of the builder. A fortified manor house was the administrative centre of a manor– a <b>division</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> in medieval England– and was usually the home of the local lord. Fortified manor houses are considered castles because they often had battlements or crenellations.|$|E
25|$|The <b>division</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> is {{somewhat}} obscure. One maxim {{suggests that the}} youngest son divided the land into equal parts. The eldest chose first, followed by the second and so on until the youngest received the remaining land. The intent was to make <b>division</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> equal. Other laws suggested that the eldest son had automatic claims to the buildings. However, there are some hints that this only happened if a younger son challenged a division. The normal practice was that the eldest son both divided and chose first, but had to divide equally. More rarely, a father might divide the land for his sons in his lifetime.|$|E
25|$|In Ireland a townland is {{generally}} the smallest administrative <b>division</b> <b>of</b> <b>land,</b> {{though a few}} large townlands are further divided into hundreds. The concept of townlands {{is based on the}} Gaelic system of land division, and the first official evidence of the existence of this Gaelic land division system can be found in church records from before the 12th century, it was in the 1600s that they began to be mapped and defined by the English administration for the purpose of confiscating land and apportioning it to English investors or planters.|$|E
25|$|In 1932, {{direct control}} of the {{majority}} of the St. Lawrence Reservation's parks was removed from the Conservation Department's <b>Division</b> <b>of</b> <b>Lands</b> and Forests (successor of the Fisheries, Game and Forest Commission) and placed in the hands of the newly created Thousand Islands State Park Commission, a governor-appointed board that reported to the Conservation Department's <b>Division</b> <b>of</b> Parks. With the change in leadership, work began to develop the reservation's lands into independent state parks. The formal definition of the St. Lawrence Reservation was removed from the Lands and Forests Law in 1963, in recognition of the fact that the defined lands were no longer under the jurisdiction of the Conservation Department's <b>Division</b> <b>of</b> <b>Lands</b> and Forests.|$|R

25|$|The {{text of the}} Book of Leviticus {{argues that}} the Jubilee existed because the land was the {{possession}} of Yahweh, and its current occupiers were merely aliens or tenants, and therefore the land should not be sold forever. Midrashic sources argue that the Jubilee was created to preserve the original <b>division</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> between the Israelite tribes, {{as evidenced by the}} rabbinical tradition that the Jubilee should not be imposed until the Israelites were in control of Canaan. Leviticus also states that the Israelites were the servants of Yahweh, which classical rabbis took as justification for the manumission of Israelite slaves at the Jubilee, using the argument that no man should have two masters, and thus, as the servants of Yahweh, the Israelites should not also be the servants of men.|$|E
500|$|Following the {{emergence}} of the united Kingdom of England, Salford became a caput or central manor within a broad rural area in part held by the Kings of England, including Edward the Confessor.

Ideally, an ahuapuaʻa has all necessities in its borders. From the mountains, materials such as wood are provided for thatching roofs and twining rope. The uplands produce crops like sugar cane and sweet potatoes, while the lowlands provide taro and fish. This system typically satisfies the large populations in each ahupuaʻa.|$|E

60|$|The {{provision}} {{which is}} made for the poor in this kingdom is so liberal, as, {{in the opinion of}} some, to discourage industry. The rental of the lands in England and Wales does not, I conjecture, amount to more than eighteen millions a year; and the poor rates amount to two millions. The poor then, at present, possess a ninth part of the landed rental of the country; and, reckoning ten pounds for the annual maintenance of each pauper, it may be inferred, that those who are maintained by the community do not constitute a fortieth part of the people. An equal <b>division</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> would be to the poor a great misfortune; they would possess far less than by the laws of the land they are at present entitled to. When we add to this consideration an account of the immense sums annually subscribed by the rich for the support of hospitals, infirmaries, dispensaries--for the relief of sufferers by fire, tempests, famine, loss of cattle, great sickness, and other misfortunes, all of which charities must cease were all men on a level, for all men would then be equally poor,--it cannot but excite one's astonishment that so foolish a system should have ever been so much as mentioned by any man of common sense. It is a system not practicable; and was it practicable, it would not be useful; and was it useful, it would not be just.|$|E

60|$|It may {{be curious}} to observe, {{in the case}} {{that we have been}} supposing, how some of the laws which at present govern civilized society, would be {{successively}} dictated by the most imperious necessity. As man, according to Mr Godwin, is the creature of the impressions to which he is subject, the goadings of want could not continue long, before some violations of public or private stock would necessarily take place. As these violations increased in number and extent, the more active and comprehensive intellects of the society would soon perceive, that while population was fast increasing, the yearly produce of the country would shortly begin to diminish. The urgency of the case would suggest the necessity of some mediate measures to be taken for the general safety. Some kind of convention would then be called, and the dangerous situation of the country stated in the strongest terms. It would be observed, that while they lived in the midst of plenty, it was of little consequence who laboured the least, or who possessed the least, as every man was perfectly willing and ready to supply the wants of his neighbour. But that the question was no longer whether one man should give to another that which he did not use himself, but whether he should give to his neighbour the food which was absolutely necessary to his own existence. It would be represented, that the number of those that were in want very greatly exceeded the number and means of those who should supply them; that these pressing wants, which from the state of the produce of the country could not all be gratified, had occasioned some flagrant violations of justice; that these violations had already checked the increase of food, and would, if they were not by some means or other prevented, throw the whole community in confusion; that imperious necessity seemed to dictate that a yearly increase of produce should, if possible, be obtained at all events; that in order to effect this first, great, and indispensable purpose, it would be advisable to make a more complete <b>division</b> <b>of</b> <b>land,</b> and to secure every man's stock against violation by the most powerful sanctions, even by death itself.|$|E
60|$|When {{these two}} {{fundamental}} laws of society, {{the security of}} property, and the institution of marriage, were once established, inequality of conditions must necessarily follow. Those who were born after the division of property would come into a world already possessed. If their parents, from having too large a family, could not give them sufficient for their support, what are they {{to do in a}} world where everything is appropriated? We have seen the fatal effects that would result to a society, if every man had a valid claim to an equal share of the produce of the earth. The members of a family which was grown too large for the original <b>division</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> appropriated to it could not then demand a part of the surplus produce of others, as a debt of justice. It has appeared, that from the inevitable laws of our nature some human beings must suffer from want. These are the unhappy persons who, in the great lottery of life, have drawn a blank. The number of these claimants would soon exceed the ability of the surplus produce to supply. Moral merit is a very difficult distinguishing criterion, except in extreme cases. The owners of surplus produce would in general seek some more obvious mark of distinction. And it seems both natural and just that, except upon particular occasions, their choice should fall upon those who were able, and professed themselves willing, to exert their strength in procuring a further surplus produce; and thus at once benefiting the community, and enabling these proprietors to afford assistance to greater numbers. All who were in want of food would be urged by imperious necessity to offer their labour in exchange for this article so absolutely essential to existence. The fund appropriated to the maintenance of labour would be the aggregate quantity of food possessed by the owners of land beyond their own consumption. When the demands upon this fund were great and numerous, it would naturally be divided in very small shares. Labour would be ill paid. Men would offer to work for a bare subsistence, and the rearing of families would be checked by sickness and misery. On the contrary, when this fund was increasing fast, when it was great in proportion to the number of claimants, it would be divided in much larger shares. No man would exchange his labour without receiving an ample quantity of food in return. Labourers would live in ease and comfort, and would consequently be able to rear a numerous and vigorous offspring.|$|E
