The effect of: i. 	different epoxy prepolymers: epoxidized linseed oil (ELO); epoxidized soybean oil (ESBO), and; their corresponding epoxidized methyl esters EML and EMS; ii. 	systematically increasing carbon-carbon chain length of a series of α,ω-dicarboxylic acids (DCAs); iii. 	different curing conditions based on type and concentration of accelerant: N,N- 4 -dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP); 1 -methylimidazole (1 -MI); 2 -methylimidazole (2 -MI); vinylimidazole (VI), and; trimethylamine (TEA), cure temperature and time. iv. 	mixtures glutaric anhydride-adipic acid, and; v. 	inclusion of native and modified starch to ELO-adipic acid resins, on thermal and mechanical properties are discussed in detail. Resins derived from DCAs gave soft and flexible materials. ELO-derived samples possessed higher Tg and better mechanical properties due to their higher oxirane content and functionality. Systematically increasing the carbon-carbon chain length improves thermal stability but reduces Tg, tensile strength, Young’s modulus, elongation at break and toughness. Among the various accelerants trialed, DMAP gave samples with best properties while TEA gave samples with poorest properties. Increasing DMAP concentration resulted in improved Tg, tensile strength and Young’s modulus but reduced thermal stability.

The carboxylic group Of <b>glutaric</b> <b>anhydride</b> was used to condense the free N-terminal group of the side-chain protected peptide sequence. Finally, the Surface was treated with trifluoroacetic acid to deprotect side-chain groups. In the second protocol, the peptide was directly anchored to the Ti oxide surface via UV activation of an arylazide peptide analogue. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses confirmed that modifications induced onto surface composition were in agreement with the reactions performed. The peptide density of each biomimetic Surface was determined on the basis of radiolabeling and XPS derived reaction yields.

In each, the importance of the marriage between computations and experiments is highlighted. Continued efforts in this vein are essential for future efforts towards improving human health. The first case study investigated the effectiveness of computational tools in determining relative configurations of complex molecules, using natural products mandelalides and coibamide A, towards a generalized recipe for the scientific community at large. Ultimately, continuing efforts in this vein will accelerate and strengthen relative structure elucidation of complex molecules, such as natural products. Molecular mechanics conformational search, quantum mechanical nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) chemical shift predictions, and DP 4 analyses led to the revision of relative configurations of mandelalides A-D and coibamide A, reaffirming recent reports from total syntheses. All chiral centers in the northern hemisphere of mandelalides A-D are inverted with respect to the originally proposed structures, in agreement with recent total syntheses of mandelalide A by Ye, Fürstner & Carter. In the case of coibamide A, {{it was found that the}} computed and experimental ¹H and ¹³C NMR spectra of Fang & Su's revised structure, in which both the macrocycle [MeAla¹¹] and the side chain [HIV²] residues are inverted from L to D, was consistent with the spectra of the authentic natural product. In the second study, Shaw and coworkers reported the synthesis of 2 - piperidinones in a single step from imines and 2 -cyano <b>glutaric</b> <b>anhydrides.</b> The reaction provides the products in good diastereoselectivity and generates a quaternary stereogenic center. Substitutions on the anhydride skeleton are well tolerated to provide 2 -piperidinones with three stereogenic centers from a single transformation. The pertinent transition structures have been computed using quantum mechanics, and we reveal the key interactions controlling the stereochemical outcome of the reaction. In the final study, the mechanism of a four-component reaction (4 CR) involving aldehydes, maleic anhydrides, thiols and primary amines to form trisubstituted gamma lactams is presented. Computations reveal that the 4 CR reaction proceeds by a base-catalyzed thiol-anhydride pathway, followed by an in situ acid-catalyzed formation of an imine and an anhydride. Finally, a stepwise Mannich-acylation mechanism leads to γ-lactam. The rate determining step (RDS) involves loss of water to form the imine, crucial for the Mannich-acylation process. The RDS is verified by agreement between experimental and computed natural abundance kinetic isotope effects (KIEs). Computations also show that the resting state is a complex of the amide/acid isomer and the in situ acid as shown earlier by the Shaw group. The in situ acid is essential to catalysis for this entire process. These discoveries could shed light on the understanding of the mechanisms for other related multicomponent reactions such as the Biginelli and Ugi reactions...|$|R

40|$|The {{chemical}} reaction at high temperature (above 200 degrees C) between PC and PMMA {{has been very}} recently highlighted. However, no clear reaction mechanism has been proposed to explain this phenomenon. We suggest a reaction mechanism following two steps. The first step consists of hydrolysis of the ester bonds of the PMMA leading to acid pendant groups. These acids can then either ring close into <b>glutaric</b> <b>anhydride,</b> or acidolyze the carbonate bonds of PC during the second step. At the same time, benzoic acid produced by PC degradation could further react with PMMA or acidolyze the carbonate groups leading to the crosslinking of the system. A satisfactory contact between the reacting units is a key point in the process. Significant amounts of PC-PMMA copolymer are obtained when the reaction is performed from a miscible system. On the contrary, no reaction occurs during melt mixing. Understanding the process enables us to specify the conditions, in which no {{chemical reaction}} takes place. In nonreactive conditions, PC/PMMA blends remain immiscible for several hours at 300 degrees C.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the ability of a third-generation (G 3) polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimer-based carrier to enhance the permeability of paclitaxel (pac) and to overcome cellular barriers. G 3 dendrimers were surface modified with lauryl chains (L) and conjugated with paclitaxel (pac) via a <b>glutaric</b> <b>anhydride</b> (glu) linker, followed by labeling with FITC. Biological evaluation of the dendrimer and conjugates was conducted using the human colon adenocarcinoma cell line (Caco- 2) and primary cultured porcine brain endothelial cells (PBECs). LDH assay was used to evaluate the cytotoxicity of the dendrimer and conjugates. Cytotoxicity studies showed that the conjugation of lauryl chains and paclitaxel on G 3 dendrimer significantly (p < 0. 05) increased the cytotoxicity against both cell types. Permeability studies of dendrimer-drug conjugates demonstrated an increase in the apparent permeability coefficient (Papp) in both apical to basolateral A → B and basolateral to apical B → A directions across both cell monolayers compared to unmodified G 3 and free drug. The B → A Papp of paclitaxel was significantly (p < 0. 05) higher than the A → B Papp, indicating active function of P-gp efflux transporter system in both cell models.

In the present study, the effect of cyclic monomers on the coordinative structure of Al((OPr) -Pr-i) (3) in benzene was investigated by cryometry. gamma-Butyrolactone (gamma-BL), a nonpolymerizable lactone, was first studied as a model monomer. The cryometric Job diagram for the gamma-BL/Al((OPr) -Pr-i) (3) system in benzene established formation of a trisolvated six-coordinate [Al((OPr) -Pr-i) (3). 3 gamma-BL] complex. This is in perfect agreement with the hexacoordinated Al atoms as reported by Al- 27 NMR. The extension of the cryometric study to a polymerizable lactone, e. g., delta-valerolactone (delta-VL), confirmed that the single [Al((OPr) -Pr-i) (3). 3 M] species is the actual initiator for the ring-opening polymerization. Al- 27 NMR shows that the same conclusion holds when other cyclic monomers, such as lactides and <b>glutaric</b> <b>anhydride,</b> are considered. The induction period of time that is usually observed in the ROP of lactones, lactides, and cyclic anhydrides may now be attributed to the dissociation of the Al((OPr) -Pr-i) (3) aggregates upon the addition of the cyclic monomer. Toluene solutions of living poly(epsilon-CL) and polylactide chains as initiated by Al((OPr) -Pr-i) (3) were also investigated by viscosimetry. The mean association degree ((DA)) over bar of the living chains was calculated from the intrinsic viscosity compared to the value measured for the parent hydrolyzed and purified polyester.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} investigations {{made into}} {{the chemistry of}} C- 4 substituted glutarimides. It develops two contrasting approaches to this goal, which reflect the previous synthetic interests in the area. The glutarimides made were screened for potential agrochemical actions at Shell Research Centre, Sittingbourne. The anti-Leukemia alkaloid sesbanimide has prompted much recent work into the formation of glutarimides attached to functionalised precursors. This chemistry {{was developed by the}} formation of a glutarimide from C- 5 of xylo dialdofuranose, using standard methods. Wittig extension of the aldehyde, followed by Michael addition of malonate and dealkoxycarbonylation gave a glutarate diester, this was converted to the glutarimide via an anhydride. A glutarimide was similarly constructed from a β-ribose residue, forming an analogue of the β-C-nucleosides. An approach to the epimeric α- ribo -glutarimide was also made. The α- and β- ribo aldehydes, from which the glutarimides were elaborated, were each formed stereospecifically by the ring contractions of a pyranose triflate. Synthetic interest towards the so-called glutarimide antibiotics has centred around the elaboration of a side chain attached to a pre-formed glutarimide. The common precursors in this work were glutarimides attached via C- 4 to β-acetyl functions. The corresponding side chain in this work was activated, in a novel manner, by the formation of a stabilized ylid at that centre. Wittig reactions between this ylid and a number of carbonyl compounds were achieved. Some of these Wittig products were elaborated further, a number of simple heterocycles were thus formed, attached to glutarimide via a 1 -carbon extension. Using a carbohydrate derived side chain an attempt to form a glutarimide attached to a shikimate-related residue was made, by means of an intramolecular aldol cyclisation. An N -substituted glutarimide was formed in a novel reaction between an iminophosphorane and <b>glutaric</b> <b>anhydride.</b> Many of these synthetic glutarimides exhibited some biological activity. </p...|$|E
40|$|Dendrimers are a novel {{class of}} highly {{branched}} polymers {{with a high}} degree of uniformity and monodispersity. As a result of the unique properties and characteristics of dendrimers, they have found a wide range of pharmaceutical applications. This study investigated the ability of polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimer-based drug delivery systems to enhance the permeability of a drug that is a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) efflux transporter with low water solubility. This thesis described the syntheses, characterisations and biological evaluations of the dendrimer-based drug delivery system to overcome the cellular barriers. G 3 PAMAM dendrimers were conjugated with lauryl chains via a carbamate bond. Paclitaxel, a low water solubility P-gp substrate and anti-tumour drug, was conjugated to G 3 and/or lauryl-G 3 PAMAM dendrimer conjugates via a <b>glutaric</b> <b>anhydride</b> linker. Unmodified G 3 PAMAM dendrimer and all the dendrimer conjugates (lauryl-G 3 and G 3 -drug conjugates) were labelled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) for quantitative detection by spectrofluorimetry in permeability studies. These conjugates were characterised using various techniques including thin layer chromatography, 1 H and 13 C NMR, ESI-MS and dynamic light scattering. Chemical stability studies showed that the tested dendrimer conjugate (FITC-G 3 L 6 -glu-pac) was stable at all test pHs (1. 2, 7. 4, and 8. 5) after 48 h of incubation at 37 oC. The ester bond of the conjugate was stable under several chemical conditions after 10 days of incubation. Biological evaluation of the dendrimer conjugates was initially conducted using Caco- 2 cells. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assay showed that conjugation of lauryl chains and paclitaxel molecules on the surface of G 3 PAMAM dendrimer significantly (p < 0. 05) increased the cytotoxicity in Caco- 2 cells. The permeation of G 3 PAMAM dendrimer and drug conjugates was investigated by measuring the apparent permeability coefficient (Papp) in both apical to basolateral AB and BA directions across Caco- 2 cell monolayers at 37 oC. The BA Papp of paclitaxel was found to be significantly (p < 0. 05) higher than the AB Papp, indicating active function of P-gp efflux transporter system in the cell model. Covalent conjugation of paclitaxel to G 3 PAMAM dendrimer via a <b>glutaric</b> <b>anhydride</b> linker significantly (p < 0. 05) increased its AB Papp through Caco- 2 cell monolayers. A more pronounced increase of paclitaxel permeation was observed when surface modified G 3 PAMAM dendrimers with six lauryl chains were used as the carrier. L 6 -G 3 -glu-pac was found with highest permeability across the Caco- 2 cell monolayers. The results suggested that G 3 PAMAM dendrimer-based drug delivery systems enhance the permeability of paclitaxel and bypass P-gp efflux transporter system in Caco- 2 cell monolayers, thereby overcoming the intestinal barrier. Further biological evaluation was carried out using porcine brain endothelial cells (PBECs) as a blood-brain barrier (BBB) cell model to examine the potential of G 3 PAMAM dendrimer as a carrier for paclitaxel (P-gp substrate) to bypass the BBB. Cell culture conditions of PBECs were monitored and examined to establish optimal conditions for cell growth. PBECs were successfully cultured with characteristic elongated spindle-like morphology. Integrity of the cell monolayers was evaluated by measuring the transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) across the cell monolayers. Successfully cultured cell monolayers that achieved TEER values of higher than 200 Ω. cm 2 were used for permeability studies. Elevation of TEER was observed when PBEC monolayers were cultured in the serum-free medium with hydrocortisone and treated with the cAMP/RO- 20 - 1724 solution mixture. G 3 PAMAM dendrimer was found to be relatively non-toxic to PBECs compared to all other conjugates. Conjugation of lauryl chains and paclitaxel molecules on the surface of G 3 PAMAM dendrimer significantly (p < 0. 05) increased the cytotoxicity in PBECs, as assessed by LDH assay. Permeability studies of paclitaxel across the PBEC monolayers showed a similar transport profile to that of Caco- 2 cell. The significant higher BA Papp of paclitaxel compared to the AB Papp indicated active function of P-gp efflux transporter system in the cell model. The AB Papp of L 6 -G 3 -glu-pac was found to be approximately 12 fold greater than that of free paclitaxel across the PBEC monolayers, where lauryl chains were acting as permeability enhancer. The cytotoxicity and permeability results using PBECs were found to be in good agreement with the findings when Caco- 2 cells were used as the cellular barrier cell model. From these studies, it can be concluded that G 3 PAMAM dendrimers-based drug delivery systems are potential nanocarriers for low solubility and P-gp substrate drug to bypass the P-gp efflux transporter system and overcome cellular barriers...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the development of new organic ligands as corrosion inhibitors. The introductory chapter presents a review of the chemistry involved in the corrosion of metal surfaces. Chapter 2 considers the requirements necessary to develop new ligands. The ligand-surface complex must have a high thermodynamic and kinetic stability. The inclusion of multifunctionality allows the potential for intermolecular ligand-ligand or ligand-surface secondary bonding which can generate a multisite attachment mode of binding. For example, Irgacor 419 ©, 3 -(4 -methylbenzoyl) -propionic acid, is used commercially in surface coatings as a corrosion inhibitor. Its efficacy is rationalised by the strong binding of the carboxylic acid group to iron(III) atoms and the secondary bonding of the keto group to a surface hydroxyl. Its bromo-analogue, 3 -(4 -bromobenzoyl) -propionic acid, was studied for use in Quartz Crystal Microbalance studies. Use of a QCM and the adsorption isotherm of a ligand from a solution phase onto high surface area solid substrate, goethite, were considered as analytical techniques to investigate ligand-surface interactions. Chapter 3 considers the synergistic corrosion inhibition effect obtained by combining two knonwn corrosion inhibitors for mild steel, 2 -hydroxyl- 5 -nonyl-benzaldehyde oxime (P 50 oxime) and polyisobutylene succinic anhydride (PIBSA) which has been patented by ICI. Reactions between salicyaldehyde or benzaldehyde oxime and succinic or <b>glutaric</b> <b>anhydride</b> are shown to result in ring opening and generation of a series of ligands, including salicyaldehyde O-(4 -carboxypropanoyl) oxime and benzaldehyde O-(5 -carboxybutanoyl) oxime. A search of the CSD shows that salicylaldoximes and similar structures have a propensity for formation of polynuclear complexes. Measurement of adsorption isotherms on goethite indicate that the inclusion of a phenolic hydroxyl to these oxime ester molecules allows them to generate multilayers when attaching to iron(III) oxide surfaces which is useful in generating hydrophobic thick-films. The absence of a phenol to surface interaction in surface binding is supported by the binding of 2 -hydroxy-benzaldehyde-O-methyl-oxime being weaker than that of 2 -hydroxy-benzaldehyde oxime. In addition, these are both weaker than P 50 oxime suggesting that the corrosion resistance synergism observed when combining P 50 oxime with PIBSA is partly due to the high number of alkyl chain groups held in close proximity to the surface which assists in forming films with good hydrophobicity. In the fourth chapter, the synthesis of several benzoic acid derivatives was used to determine the effect of the systematic introduction of cooperative intermolecular bonding groups to a ligand. In addition, the inclusion of a sulfur atom was used to allow adsorption isotherm determination to be carried out using ICP-OES. The binding strength of 4 -[3 -(4 -Methylsulfanyl-phenyl) -ureido]-benzoic acid, as determined by adsorption isotherms, is considerably higher than that of 4 -ethylsulfanyl benzoic acid. A series of methionine derivates generated 2 -[4 -(1 -Carboxy- 3 -methylsulfanyl-propylcarbamoyl) -benzoylamino]- 4 -methylsulfanyl-butyric acid, which has a large number of surface ligating and hydrogen bonding groups. This ligand forms a very stable ligand-surface assembly and has a tendency to create second or further layers. Carboxylic acids with a single carbon atom link to a carbonyl group are considered in chapter 5. Adsorption isotherm determinations demonstrate that 2 -(4 -chloro-phenyl) malonic acid binds more strongly to goethite that the commercial reagent, Irgacor 419 ©, and much more strongly than (4 -chloro-phenyl) acetic acid. Molecular modelling identifies surface binding modes which could account for the higher stability of the malonate surface complexes. The most plausible models involve multisite attachment with a binucleating mode which leaves on carboxylic acid group free to form hydrogen bonds to adjacent ligands or, a trinucleating arrangement with malonate in its dianionic form. The development of commercial corrosion inhibitors is considered. A propensity for decarboxylation, observed when attempting to prepare polynuclear complexes as model compounds and when attempting to prepare new 2 -substituted malonic acids may limit their efficacy in surface protection and surface engineering.

40|$|Heute handelt es sich bei mehr als der Hälfte aller zugelassenen Arzneimittel um Naturstoffe, Naturstoffderivate oder Naturstoffanaloga. Die Suche nach neuen Leitstrukturen beschränkt sich nicht mehr nur auf terrestrische Pflanzen und Mikroorganismen, sondern vermehrt auf marine Organismen. Dabei sind vor allem fest am Meeresboden verwachsene Schwämme und Korallen sehr interessant, da sie sich nur durch Anpassung ihres Metabolitprofiles, das heißt die Biosynthese geeigneter Toxine, vor Feinden schützen können. So wurde auch das marine 22 -gliedrige Makrolacton (–) -Dictyostatin erstmals 1988 bei der systematischen Suche nach neuen Leitstrukturen von G. R. Pettit aus Spongia sp. isoliert. Durch zellbiologische Studien von A. E. Wright wurde der Taxol-ähnliche Wirkmechanismus, welcher durch Stabilisierung der Mikrotubuli zum Zellzyklusarrest zwischen der G 2 /M-Phase führt, aufgeklärt und im Jahr 2003 veröffentlicht. Im darauf folgenden Jahr gelang der Beweis des von I. Paterson publizierten vollständigen Strukturvorschlages durch zwei voneinander unabhängige Totalsynthesen. Neben der Etablierung der drei Stereokaskaden (C 6 -C 9, C 12 -C 16, C 19 -C 22) stellen bei der Synthese von (–) -Dictyostatin vor allem die C 2 :C 3 -(Z) - und die C 10 :C 11 -(Z) -Doppelbindung eine Herausforderung dar, da sie relativ leicht zur Isomerisierung neigen. Um einen relativ kostengünstigen Zugang zu größeren Substanzmengen zu erreichen, wurde im Gegensatz zu den bisher veröffentlichten Synthesen von (–) -Dictyostatin auf die Verwendung des teuren Roche-Esters verzichtet. Stattdessen wurden die chiralen Vorläufer für die ersten Stufen durch enzymatische ADS und kinetische Resolution aus prochiralen bzw. racemischen Edukten dargestellt. Bei der Synthese von meso- 1, 3 -Dimethylglutarsäureanhydrid, dem prochiralen Vorläufer des oberen Fragmentes, konnte die Gesamtausbeute durch basenkatalysierte Äquilibierung des Isomerengemisches, im Vergleich zu den bisher publizierten Ausbeuten, mehr als verdoppelt werden. Auf die Reduktion zum entsprechenden meso- 1, 5 -Diol folgte die enzymatische Desymmetrisierung unter Verwendung von PFL und Vinylacetat als irreversiblem Acyldonor. Die Komplettierung der C 12 -C 16 -Stereokaskade gelang durch anti-selektive Abiko-Aldol-Addition. Die Einführung der C 19 -C 22 -Stereotetrade erfolgte in nur zwei Schritten durch Dipropionat-Evans-Aldol-Addition und anschließende Kiyooka-Reduktion des resultierenden beta-Hydroxyketons. Die terminale Dien-Einheit wurde nach einem Protokoll von I. Paterson mittels Nozaki-Hiyama-Kishi-Addition, sowie nachfolgender Peterson-Eliminierung etabliert, womit das Kohlenstoffgrundgerüst des C 11 -C 26 -Fragmentes vollständig ist. Nach der enantioselektiven Noyori-Transferhydrierung des entsprechenden Propargylketons wurde die C 6,C 7 -anti-Stereochemie im C 1 -C 10 -Fragment mittels Marshall-Tamaru-Addition eingeführt. Die Etablierung C 1 -C 5 -(2 Z, 4 E) -Dienoat-Einheit erfolgte, nach Entschützung des terminalen Alkins und dessen Hydroborierung mit Catecholboran, durch Suzuki-Kupplung mit Ethyl-(Z) -iodacrylat. Die Synthese des C 1 -C 10 -Fragmentes wurde durch die Einführung der bis-(2, 2, 2 -Trifluorethyl) -beta-ketophosphonat-Einheit, welche für Fragmentkupplung unter Still-Gennari-Bedingungen benötigt wurde, abgeschlossen. Die Fragmentkupplung erfolgte mittels (Z) -selektiver Still-Gennari-Olefinierung, wodurch mit reproduzierbar guten Ausbeuten das entsprechende alpha,beta-ungesättigte Keton erhalten wurde. Im weiteren Verlauf der Synthese erwies sich die alpha,beta-Enon-Einheit als sehr instabil, was in der Isomerisierung oder Zersetzung der jeweiligen Verbindungen resultierte. Die analogen Allylalkohole, welche aus den entsprechenden Substraten durch Nozaki-Hiyama-Kishi- bzw. Vinylzinkat-Kupplung dargestellt wurden, erwiesen sich ebenfalls als recht labil. Um die Probleme mit der instabilen C 10 :C 11 -(Z) -Doppelbindung bei den weiteren Stufen zu umgehen sollte die Makrolactonisierung möglichst rasch nach Fragmentkupplung erfolgen. Anschließend sollte die Fertigstellung der Totalsynthese von (–) -Dictyostatin, analog zu den bisher veröffentlichen Strategien, in wenigen Stufen möglich sein.

The search for new lead structures is not limited to terrestrial plants and micro organisms, but increased on marine organisms. Thereby most notably tight to the see ground bound sponges and corrals are very interesting, because the only way to defend their self from enemies is the adaptation of the metabolite profile, which means biosynthesis of appropriate toxins. So the 22 -membered macrolactone (–) -dictyostatin was isolated first in 1988 from Spongia sp. by G. R. Pettit during a systematic search for new lead structures. Through cell biological studies by A. E. Wright, the taxol-like mode of action, which leads to cell cycle arrest between the G 2 /M phase by stabilizing microtubules, was elucidated and published in 2003. The ensuing year the proof of the complemented structure, proposal published by I. Paterson, was carried out by two independent total synthesis. Besides the establishing of the three stereo cascades (C 6 -C 9, C 12 -C 16, C 19 -C 22) mainly the C 2 :C 3 -(Z) - and the C 10 :C 11 -(Z) -double bond pose to be challenging in the synthesis of (–) -dictyostatin, because they tend to isomerize easily. To achieve a relatively cheap access to larger amounts of substance and in contrast to the previous synthesis of (–) -dictyostatin, the usage of the costly Roche ester as a starting material was disclaimed. Instead chiral precursors for the first steps are generated through enzymatic ADS or kinetic resolution out of prochiral respectively racemic starting materials. For the synthesis of meso-dimethyl <b>glutaric</b> <b>anhydride,</b> the prochiral precursor of the upper fragment, the overall yield could have been doubled by base catalyzed equilibration of the isomeric mixture. After reduction to the accordant meso- 1, 5 -diol enzymatic desymmetrization using PFL and vinyl acetate as irreversible acyl donor was carried out. The completion of the C 12 -C 16 -stereochemistry succeeded through anti-selective Abiko aldol addition. The introduction of the C 19 -C 22 -stereotetrade was carried out in just two steps by dipropionate Evans aldol addition and subsequent Kiyooka reduction of the resulting beta-hydroxy ketone. The terminal diene unit was established, using a protocol by I. Paterson, through Nozaki-Hiyama-Kishi addition followed by Peterson elimination, whereby the carbon backbone of the C 11 -C 26 fragment was completed. After enantioselective Noyori transfer hydrogenation of the accordant propargyl ketone the C 6,C 7 -stereochemistry in the lower fragment was established by Marshall-Tamaru addition. The establishment of the C 1 -C 5 -(2 Z, 4 E) -dienoate unit was carried out, after deprotection of the terminal alkyne and subsequent hydroboration with cathecholborane, by Suzuki cross-coupling with ethyl-(Z) -iodoacrylate. The synthesis of the C 1 -C 10 -fragment was completed by introducing the bis-(2, 2, 2 -trifluoroethyl) -beta-ketophosphonate unit, which was necessary for the fragment coupling under Still-Gennari conditions. The fragment coupling was carried out by (Z) -selective Still-Gennari olefination, whereby the accordant alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone was received in reproducible good yields. In the further progression of the synthesis this alpha,beta-enone unit turned out to be very instable, what led to isomerization or decomposition of the respective compounds. The analogous allylic alcohols, which had been produced by Nozaki-Hiyama-Kishi- respectively vinyl zincate coupling of accordant substances, turned out to be relatively labile as well. To avoid the problems with the instable C 10 :C 11 -double bond during the next steps, the macrolactonization should be carried out rapidly after the fragment coupling. Afterwards the completion of the total synthesis of (–) -dictyostatin, according to the so far published strategies, should be possible in a few steps...|$|E
