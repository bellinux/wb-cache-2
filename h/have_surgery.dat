5|$|On December 8, Emery {{was placed}} on injured reserve to <b>have</b> <b>surgery</b> on a torn muscle in his abdomen. Originally {{expected}} to miss about six weeks, the prognosis changed when {{it was discovered that}} he had avascular necrosis. In March 2010, Flyers General Manager Paul Holmgren announced that Emery would be out for remainder of the season due to the diagnosis and that a bone graft would be done to alleviate his hip issues.|$|E
5|$|As {{a sophomore}} at Georgia Southern in 1990, Hamilton had an 18–4 record with a 3.07 ERA. He was one of nine finalists for the Golden Spikes Award, and he earned Second Team All-American honors from The Sporting News and Baseball America. However, at the {{beginning}} of his junior season he went 13 with a 7.43 ERA after starting five games. It was soon discovered that Hamilton was suffering from an elbow injury, which forced him to <b>have</b> <b>surgery</b> in 1992.|$|E
5|$|However, {{he was a}} late scratch from a game on September 28 {{because of}} soreness in his ankle. An MRI the {{following}} day revealed major swelling in a weight-bearing bone in his ankle. Kemp was told that if he kept playing his ankle could break and leave him with chronic problems {{for the rest of}} his career. He was shut down, and the team announced he would not be available for the playoffs and would <b>have</b> <b>surgery</b> to repair the problem. Kemp suffered an articular talar injury requiring microfracture surgery to his talus bone.|$|E

5|$|Voorhis had the {{advantage}} of incumbency, but this was balanced by other factors favoring Nixon. Due to the press of Congressional business, Voorhis was able to devote only two months to the campaign, while Nixon campaigned in the district for ten months. Voorhis's time was further limited when, while en route to California from Washington D.C. in August, he was forced to <b>have</b> <b>surgery</b> for hemorrhoids in Ogden, Utah. He spent two weeks in an Ogden hotel recuperating from the operation.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland {{decided to}} <b>have</b> <b>surgery</b> secretly, to avoid further panic that might worsen the {{financial}} depression. The surgery occurred on July 1, to give Cleveland {{time to make}} a full recovery in time for the upcoming Congressional session. Under the guise of a vacation cruise, Cleveland and his surgeon, Dr. Joseph Bryant, left for New York. The surgeons operated aboard the Oneida, a yacht owned by Cleveland's friend E. C. Benedict, as it sailed off Long Island. The surgery was conducted through the President's mouth, to avoid any scars or other signs of surgery. The team, sedating Cleveland with nitrous oxide and ether, successfully removed parts of his upper left jaw and hard palate. The size of the tumor and the extent of the operation left Cleveland's mouth disfigured. During another surgery, Cleveland was fitted with a hard rubber dental prosthesis that corrected his speech and restored his appearance. A cover story about the removal of two bad teeth kept the suspicious press placated. Even when a newspaper story appeared giving details of the actual operation, the participating surgeons discounted the severity of what transpired during Cleveland's vacation. In 1917, one of the surgeons present on the Oneida, Dr. William W. Keen, wrote an article detailing the operation.|$|E
5|$|Jared {{initially}} {{tells the}} police nothing {{of what he}} saw. He is torn between the need {{to tell the truth}} and the desire to protect his friends; his anger leads to the breakdown of his relationships with both Rachel and Diane. Despite Jared's silence, police arrest Toby and the three other boys within a few days. Jared decides to tell the police what he saw, as he believes Toby and the other boys will be charged with Tracy's murder; however, on his way into the police station he is confronted by Ricko. Ricko confesses to Jared that he killed Tracy, but claims it was an accident – that she hit her head on a rock when he attempted to have sex with her. He has already told police that he was with Jared all night and asks Jared to confirm his alibi in the name of mateship. Diane, who still {{has not been able to}} tell Jared that she has cancer due to his behaviour, goes in to <b>have</b> <b>surgery.</b>|$|E

30|$|To {{assess the}} effect of {{increasing}} experience, of the surgeon in the laparoscopic staging procedure, the patients were arranged in chronological order based on the date of their staging surgery. The patients were divided in equal groups according to three periods.

5|$|A {{week after}} the Canucks' Game 7 loss, Kesler was awarded the Selke Trophy after {{finishing}} as a runner-up the previous two years. He received 1,179 voting points in comparison to runners-up Jonathan Toews' 476 and Pavel Datsyuk's 348. Kesler was also ranked eighth in Hart Memorial Trophy voting as the league's most valuable player. Later in the off-season, Kesler underwent arthroscopic surgery for the torn labrum in his hip. Unrelated to his labrum tear in 2007, he had adopted a program to recuperate from the injury naturally until a specialist advised him to <b>have</b> <b>surgery</b> in late-July 2011. The Canucks announced on August 2 that Kesler had successfully undergone the procedure, while it was also reported {{he would not be}} ready to play until mid-October. On schedule, he returned to the lineup on October 18 against the New York Rangers after missing the first five games of the 2011–12 season. Appearing in 77 contests, Kesler recorded his lowest scoring total in four years with 22 goals, 27 assists and 49 points. On a team basis, the Canucks remained a successful regular season team, winning their second consecutive Presidents' Trophy. They failed to defend their Western Conference playoff title, however, losing in the first round to the Los Angeles Kings in five games. Kesler recorded three assists in the series.|$|E

40|$|Background: Guidelines {{recommend}} that adults with {{congenital heart disease}} (CHD) undergo noncardiac surgery in regionalized centers of expertise, but no studies have assessed whether this occurs in the United States. We hypothesized that adults with CHD {{are less likely than}} children to receive care at specialized CHD centers. Methods: Using a comprehensive state ambulatory surgical registry (California Ambulatory Surgery Database, 2005 – 2011), we calculated the proportion of adult and pediatric patients with CHD who <b>had</b> <b>surgery</b> at a CHD center, distance to the nearest CHD center, and distance to the facility where surgery was performed. Results: Patients with CHD accounted for a larger proportion of the pediatric population (n = 11, 254, 1. 0 %) than the adult population (n = 10, 547, 0. 07 %). Only 2, 741 (26. 0 %) adults with CHD <b>had</b> <b>surgery</b> in a CHD center compared to 6, 403 (56. 9 %) children (p, 0. 0001). Adult CHD patients who <b>had</b> <b>surgery</b> at a non-specialty center (11. 9615. 4 miles away) lived farther from the nearest CHD center (37. 9643. 0 miles) than adult CHD patients who <b>had</b> <b>surgery</b> at a CHD center (23. 2628. 4 miles; p, 0. 0001). Pediatric CHD patients who <b>had</b> <b>surgery</b> at a non-specialty center (18. 0620. 7 miles away) lived farther from the nearest CHD center (35. 7645. 2 miles) than pediatric CHD patients who <b>had</b> <b>surgery</b> at a CHD center (22. 4626. 0 miles; p, 0. 0001). Conclusions: Unlike children with CHD, most adults with CHD (74 %) do not <b>have</b> outpatient <b>surgery</b> at a CHD center. Fo...|$|R
