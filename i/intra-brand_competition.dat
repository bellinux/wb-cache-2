We study the welfare implications of {{resale price maintenance}} (RPM), which eliminates the <b>intra-brand</b> <b>competition.</b> We show that with RPM, the manufacturer can make more profit {{at the cost of}} the consumers.

To prevent each retailer from selling on both markets, the upstream producer increases the delay of delivery on the market where the willingness to pay is the lowest. It therefore separates the markets across time, by orientating consumers to the appropriate downstream retailer. Consumers pay their highest valuation, and a price differential higher than the switching cost persists in equilibrium.

40|$|Purpose – This paper first {{attempts}} {{to analyze the}} issue of brand proliferation by a monopolist allowing transfer pricing as a channel to bridge headquarters and brand divisions, and then to view how the headquarters uses transfer pricing as a strategic device to encounter <b>intra-brand</b> <b>competition,</b> inter-brand competition and cross-border profit-shifting under an oligopolistic market. Design/methodology/approach – This paper models cross-country interactions in a Cournot-Nash framework, and characterizes equilibrium that involves both transfer pricing and output decision. MNE’s behavior {{is based on a}} two-stage process in which the centralized headquarters ’ prior action on setting transfer pricing is to backup the decentralized subsidiaries in their output decision-making. Findings – It is demonstrated that MNEs have the incentive to manipulate their transfer prices in order to shift profit cross-border. Higher transfer pricing enables brand divisions to collude easier in the <b>intra-brand</b> <b>competition</b> model, and the level of transfer price hinges upon the strength of <b>intra-brand</b> <b>competition</b> and inter-brand competition. In addition, transfer pricing is affected by tax differences between two countries.

40|$|An {{upstream}} supplier that is constrained both by downstream {{competition and}} the threat of demand-side substitution faces a tradeoff between maximizing joint-profit and extracting surplus. Although joint-profit maximization calls for relatively high marginal wholesale prices in order to dampen <b>intra-brand</b> <b>competition,</b> surplus extraction will be higher when the supplier instead charges relatively low marginal wholesale prices. The reason is that by inducing more <b>intra-brand</b> <b>competition</b> through lower wholesale prices, the supplier makes it less attractive for downstream firms to switch to alternative sources of supply. We show how this can make it optimal for the supplier to disadvantage more efficient and thus ultimately larger buyers, thereby smoothing out differences in their market shares. We further show that despite the use of non-linear supply contracts, marginal wholesale prices and thus final goods’ prices will decrease when either downstream competition intensifies or the supplier becomes more constrained by the threat of demand-side substitution. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper investigates {{what are}} the {{equilibrium}} distribution systems in a successive duopoly when retailers hold the power to choose the number of products they wish to market. Since they both can be multi-product sellers, the number of possible channel structures considered is larger than in previous work. Then, we study whether the resulting distribution systems obtained in earlier papers still remain. In particular, whether there are incentives to adopt exclusive distribution agreements, whether a manufacturer is foreclosed from the market and, essentially, whether there exists, at equilibrium, enough inter and <b>intra-brand</b> <b>competition.</b> The analysis shows that provided low brand asymmetry, it is sufficient that retailers hold the power to choose the number of products they wish to distribute to obtain endogenously both inter and intra-brand competition; both retailers become multi-product sellers. However, as the profitability of brands diverges sufficiently, only the most profitable brand will be distributed by both retailers thus only arising <b>intra-brand</b> <b>competition</b> at equilibrium. Neither the exclusive distribution system nor a common distribution system analized in the previous literature appears at equilibrium. Distribution systems, retailer power. ...|$|E

40|$|Transfer pricing {{can be used}} as a {{strategic}} instrument to accomplish those objectives that enterprises pursue within the context of multi-divisional organization. This paper analyses the use of transfer pricing for decentralized multinational enterprises (MNEs) as {{a strategic}} instrument to tackle the issues of brand proliferation. The centralized headquarters ’ prior action on setting transfer pricing is to backup the decentralized subsidiaries in their output decision- making. It shows that the higher transfer pricing has enabled easier collusion amongst the brand’s agencies in developing an <b>intra-brand</b> <b>competition</b> model. With regard to the level of transfer pricing, this hinges upon the strength of <b>intra-brand</b> <b>competition</b> and inter-brand competition which are expressed in opposite direction. It also demonstrates that the optimal transfer pricing is affected by any difference in tax rates between two countries. (In the case where tax rates are the same, there is no effect on transfer pricing strategy). With the rapid growth of multinational enterprises (MNEs), the pricing of internal transactions undertaken by MNE’s headquarters is a tax issue that tax authorities are concerned about but it is also a strategic concern of MNE in supporting its local subsidiaries in brand proliferation and output decision, as the MNEs have the incentive to manipulate their transfer prices in order to shift profit “cross-border”, so that they may minimize their tax burden.

40|$|In {{light of}} the {{economic}} reality, which is increasingly confirmed by relevant judicial authorities, we submit that hindering parallel trade in prescription medicines does not damage patients and national health budgets. It is therefore to be welcomed that both Community and national case law has confirmed that pharmaceutical companies are entitled to adopt measures responding to – but not prohibiting or eliminating – parallel trade, and such measures are not contrary to the EC competition rules. Parallel traders had previously been free-riding on case law which referred to sectors and cases that bore {{no relation to the}} special features of the European prescription medicines sector. To the extent there is an assumption that parallel trade in Europe safeguards <b>intra-brand</b> <b>competition,</b> the recent case law does not call this assumption into question: on the contrary, it confirms it, while noting that this assumption is inapplicable to the prescription medicines sector in Europe precisely because of that sector’s very specific features. It is therefore to be hoped that the long-running obsession of European competition law with parallel trade in prescription medicines may (at last) be coming to an end. ...|$|E
40|$|The central {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to show how vertical restraints, which affect <b>intra-brand</b> <b>competition,</b> can and will be used as an effective mechanism for reducing inter-brand competition and increasing producer profits. We show how exclusive territories alter the perceived demand curve, making each producer believe he faces a less elastic demand curve, thereby inducing an increase of the equilibrium price. The use of exclusive territories may increase producers' profits, even if the producers cannot charge franchise fees, and so cannot recapture, from the retailers, the monopoly rents they earn from their exclusive territory: we show that 'double marginalization' effects can be overcome by the strategic effect on producers' competition. We provide a model in which we can clearly specify the full range of feasible contracts between producers and retailers, and show that it is always a dominant strategy for firms to use exclusive territories (so that exclusive territories are used in equilibrium) and that the best situation from the producers' viewpoint may or may not entail franchise fees. In all cases, exclusive territories hurt consumer surplus and reduce total welfare, which yields a different light on vertical restraints from a competition policy perspective. ...|$|E
40|$|Market {{integration}} is an objective of Article 101 TFEU. As a result, agreements aimed at partitioning national markets are in principle restrictive of competition by object. The case law {{on this point}} has been consistent since Consten-Grundig. Making sense of it, however, remains a challenge. The purpose of this piece is to show, first, how the methodological approach followed by the Court of Justice changes when market integration considerations are at stake. Secondly, it explains why and when restrictions on cross-border trade have been found not to restrict competition by object {{within the meaning of}} Article 101 (1) TFEU. 	An agreement aimed at partitioning national markets is not as such contrary to Article 101 (1) TFEU if the analysis of the counterfactual reveals that it does not restrict inter-brand and/or <b>intra-brand</b> <b>competition</b> that would have existed in its absence. It is possible to think of three scenarios in this regard: (i) an agreement may be objectively necessary to achieve the aims sought by the parties; (ii) a clause may be objectively necessary for an agreement and (iii) competition is precluded by the underlying regulatory context (as is the case, in particular, when the exercise of intellectual property rights is at stake) ...|$|E
40|$|A {{cornerstone}} of Anti-trust (Competition) regulation is a Prohibition on Abuse of Dominance; however, the question must be asked: what recourse does a multinational Dominant Firm have when a franchisee with an exclusive manufacturing agreement, conducts itself {{in such a}} way that the Dominant Firm is being commercially constrained and consumers are being disadvantaged, through the forced market exit of a large firm providing lower prices? The dissertation looks at South African Competition Law provisions and international developments; and provides comment based on a hypothetical market scenario, aimed at assessing whether the current South African law provides adequate relief for Dominant Firms, should a franchisee become so powerful that it begins to constrain the Dominant Firm’s market growth. The hypothetical scenario touches on the relationship between the franchisees that is created by the Dominant Firms’ vertical agreements, and considers if the franchisees conduct on the one hand lessened <b>intra-brand</b> <b>competition</b> for the Dominant Firms products, and on the other hand, if the arrangement created by the vertical agreements in fact amounted to collusion by dividing and controlling markets. The value in this research lies in the fact that there are conflicting commercial interests that exist in the marketplace; and Competition policies could interfere with a firm’s rights to freedom to contract. It is envisioned that the South African legislature will in time, be put under pressure to step up regulation in this space, should South Africa want to position itself as an attractive market for investors to expand their businesses.

40|$|This thesis {{provides}} a thorough clarification {{of the rules}} governing parallel trade in pharmaceutical products within the EEA; from first to final marketing. More specifically, the thesis {{provides a}}n analysis of the application of EC competition law (Articles 81 and 82 EC Treaty), the free movement of goods provisions (Articles 28 - 30 EC Treaty), Community measures, and Member State laws to parallel import-restrictive measures. The EC Treaty and Community measures must, in conjunction with Member State laws, facilitate the establishment of an internal market without compromising public health and safety. For example, the application of Articles 81 and 82 EC Treaty to parallel import-restrictive measures must take into consideration the need to promote public health and safety by acknowledging the pharmaceutical industry’s reliance on future investments in 'research and development' (R&D). Similarly, the application of Articles 28 - 30 EC Treaty to repackaging of pharmaceutical products must take into consideration the need to protect public health and safety. The importance of balancing the pro-integration objective with the public health and safety objective is particularly evident in relation to the application of the EC Treaty to Member State laws governing the pharmaceutical market-specific and potentially parallel import-restrictive requirement of marketing authorisations. Parallel trade is, nevertheless, a statistically safe practice, and considered essential to market integration by encouraging <b>intra-brand</b> <b>competition</b> and widening customer choice. Parallel trade is also believed to generate savings to national health authorities, and ultimately patients and taxpayers. The thesis therefore concludes with a set of recommendations aimed at strengthening the protection and promotion of public health and safety without having an unduly negative impact on the establishment of an internal market.

40|$|Primarily, this {{research}} study {{was concerned with}} {{the evaluation of the}} brand campus concept implemented at then DaimlerChrysler South Africa in 2002, as a case study. Pretoria-based Mercedes-Benz South Africa (Pty) Ltd. (MBSA) is a subsidiary of global vehicle manufacturer Germany’s Daimler-Benz AG (DBAG). They are responsible for assembling, distributing and retailing, certain Mercedes-Benz and Mitsubishi vehicle brands, and spare parts. The landmark 1998 DaimlerChrysler global ‘merger of equals’ was preceded by the 1995 joint venture between Mercedes-Benz and Mitsubishi Motor Corporation. Consequently, three brands (Mercedes-Benz, Chrysler and Mitsubishi) were retailed and marketed under DaimlerChrysler South Africa (Pty) Ltd. (DCSA), positioned next {{to each other in the}} same showroom. This report identifies key challenges stemming from this approach, namely: brand strength dilution, more than 80 multi-franchised dealers and multi-branded showrooms, service capacity problems, old working environment and infrastructure, and perceived <b>intra-brand</b> <b>competition.</b> The research evidence suggests that these problems prompted then DCSA to launch the 2000 Dealer Network Strategy (DNS). In the grand scheme of things, the DNS intervention entailed partitioning the dealer network into five brand centres in five metro regions, and eighteen market centres in the rural areas. The brand campus concept was borne out of DNS and proved to be a masterstroke since, the primary focus was on streamlining the retail facilities for DCSA vehicle sales, service and spare parts for both the passenger and commercial vehicles. This study highlights key pillars of the brand campus concept, namely: profitability, brand focus, customer orientation and diversity. The challenge was to address seven major drivers of the brand campus concept, namely: after-sales vehicle support, vehicle service capacity, lead-times, spare parts availability, sales information propagation, behavior of sales personnel and the overall vehicle dealership appearance. Semi-structured interviews constituted part of the evaluation based on the perspectives of five customers, three dealer principals and two MBSA marketing executives. The research evidence, which also came from MBSA documentation and direct observation, shows that this innovative concept has been remarkably successful...|$|E
40|$|Growing {{franchise}} {{systems are}} admired and rewarded favorably by press, seen as “growth engines” in investor stock portfolios, and attract significant interest from potential franchisees. Yet growth {{brings with it}} the specter of <b>intra-brand</b> <b>competition,</b> and its attendant ill effect of sharply reducing the motivation of franchisees – the very drivers of such growth. Facing competition from their very own, franchisees indulge in shirking, in turn eliciting franchisor terminations in ever greater numbers as they run afoul of the franchise agreement. These franchisor terminations, in turn, may subsequently affect the financial position of franchise systems in terms of sales and profitability. It is therefore worth investigating the relational and financial consequences of franchise system growth. Importantly, {{it is useful to}} uncover means of growing even while reducing the extent to which terminations might even be necessary. Further, as a franchise system’s growth in a particular market fosters geographic proximity or clustering of the same-brand outlets leading to intrabrand competition, it is useful to uncover the conditions under which this proximity is beneficial or harmful to the same-brand outlets’ performance. Proximal same-brand outlets may share knowledge while competing with one another. The boundary conditions where one effect overcomes the other are worth exploring. My dissertation comprises two essays assessing the performance implications of growth and geography in the context of franchising at two different levels of analysis – at the franchise system-, and at the individual outlet-level. My first essay traces the growth in the retail footprint – the number of outlets operating – of 75 franchise systems operating in 11 industries, observed over up to thirteen years. In contrast, essay 2 examines the implications of growth-induced proximity for each of the 988 individual outlets of a single franchise system from its inception in 1977 until 2012. Overall, my findings suggest that franchise system growth increases franchisor terminations of franchisees, but the likelihood of these terminations may be reduced if growth relies on ownership of franchisor outlets, higher royalty rate, or clustering of outlets. Furthermore, the impact of clustering of outlets on their performance is contingent on outlets’ experience and the governance context...|$|E
