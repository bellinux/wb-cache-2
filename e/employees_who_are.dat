25|$|Peer {{mentoring}} {{takes place}} in learning environments such as schools, usually between an older more experienced student and a new student. Peer mentors appear mainly in secondary schools where students moving up from primary schools may need assistance in settling into the whole new schedule and lifestyle of secondary school life.

25|$|Shelter {{employees}} are sometimes {{at risk from}} violence perpetrated by the clients they are serving. In order to address problems faced by <b>employees</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> {{trying to help the}} homeless in New York, the Department of Homeland Security increased security at some shelters and conducted security assessments of shelters in 2015.

25|$|Narcissism as a {{personality}} trait, generally assessed with the Narcissistic Personality Inventory, {{is related to}} some types of behavior in the workplace. For example, individuals high on narcissism inventories {{are more likely to}} engage in counterproductive work behavior (CWB, behavior that harms organizations or other people in the workplace). Although individuals high on narcissism might engage in more aggressive (and counterproductive) behaviors, they mainly do so when their self-esteem is threatened. Thus narcissistic employees are {{more likely to engage in}} CWB when they feel threatened. Individuals high in narcissism have fragile self-esteem and are easily threatened. One study found that <b>employees</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> high on narcissism are more likely to perceive the behaviors of others in the workplace as abusive and threatening than individuals who are low on narcissism.|$|E
25|$|In a U.S. court filing on February 11, 2010, Nortel {{proposed}} to spend $92.3M on retention bonuses for 1,475 employees in its Nortel Business Services and Corporate groups. According to the plan, Christopher Ricaurte, president of Nortel Business Services, would receive $2.5 million in incentives.

This proposed plan came the same week Nortel negotiated a $57-million deal to wind up health care and other benefits for former Canadian employees.

25|$|The initiative, called Postal Transformation, {{has been}} rolled {{out across the}} country from 2010-2017. This {{transformation}} saw {{a fundamental change in}} the work duties of letter carriers. Previously, the delivery of parcels, clearance and transfers to retail postal outlets and collection of mail from street letter boxes was carried out by the separate position of a mail service courier, while letter carriers delivered the mail through walking routes, utilizing public transit and taxis to travel to their work locations. Today, letter carrier routes are motorized and they are responsible for delivering parcels, mail, clearing and transfers at retail postal outlets, and collection of mail from street letter boxes. The additional duties have led to increased overtime, work stress, and injuries to <b>employees</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> facing greater fatigue and delivering mail in the dark; with many complaining that regular routes can no longer be completed in 8 hours, resulting in forced overtime and undelivered mail.|$|E

25|$|In Australia the {{employment}} relationship involves {{a degree of}} trust and confidence, particularly for a corporate employer that can only act through its employees. An employer may summarily dismiss an employee who destroys that trust and confidence. An employer may seek to entice or motivate its employees in the expectation of receiving a bonus payment or promises of fair treatment. Statute, regulation and industrial awards may provide the “means by which employees may be protected from abuses of power by the employer, and provides means of redress to <b>employees</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> aggrieved by some conduct of the employer” In some instances however the availability of redress may be less certain, for example a bonus payment made {{be left to the}} discretion of the employer, or the promises of fair treatment may be contained solely in policies of the employer. The employee trusts that the employer will deliver on that expectation or promise. The question arising in Mr Barker's case was whether the expectation or promise in the Bank's policies were legally enforceable.|$|E
