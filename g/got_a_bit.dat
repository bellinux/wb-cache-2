25|$|The {{following}} season, things <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> {{better for}} the Cents in the standings. Although they finished last in the Interior Division yet again, they managed to avoid the league basement. Merritt went 26–38–2, ending up well ahead of the last place Nanaimo Clippers. Zelinski continued his torrid scoring pace, finishing fifth in league scoring with 50 goals, 61 assists, and 111 points in 66 games. In the playoffs, Merritt once again locked horns with the Kelowna squad {{in the first round}} and again the Buckaroos proved to be too much, beating the Centennials in seven games.|$|E
25|$|Aftab Ahmed, the batsman {{used as an}} all-rounder {{with his}} medium pace in ODIs, <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of {{movement}} in the conditions, and that helped him to take two wickets - those of Tharanga and Kumar Sangakkara. However, he also bowled five wides in the process, {{and one of them}} even went to the boundary for four runs. Ahmed conceded 55 runs off his ten overs, and the two wickets did not help Bangladesh much, as Mahela Jayawardene and Russel Arnold helped themselves to boundaries as the innings neared a close. Spinner Mohammad Rafique toiled for Bangladesh, but could only get one wicket for plenty of runs, although a stumping chance went begging earlier on. Arnold was run {{out at the end of}} the 43rd over, though, and Manjural Islam Rana got a wicket with his very last delivery of the day, as the new batsman Tillakaratne Dilshan swept a top edge to Syed Rasel down the leg side. The wickets slowed Sri Lanka down somewhat, but only temporarily, as Jayawardene quickly got on top of the bowling again. In the final over of Sri Lanka's innings, three wickets fell, Jayawardene eventually being run out having added 50 runs in an hour. Sri Lanka closed on 269 for 9.|$|E
25|$|Having {{set their}} sights on A.C. Milan player Antonio Nocerino, D.C. United found their {{negotiation}} was undermined when Orlando City S.C.'s Kaka apparently convinced his former teammate to reject United's offer and pursue {{a contract with}} Orlando. Fortunately, a plan B quickly emerged. The team filled the holding mid slot by trading for MLS veteran Marcelo Sarvas, and <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of an unexpected boost when {{the name of a}} former acquisition target, Boca Junior's midfielder/forward Luciano Acosta suddenly showed up on the transfer rumor wires. Within a week, United had the diminutive midfielder signed and training in their Florida pre-season camp. The next day, Acosta even assisted on the lone goal in a match against Tampa Bay Rowdies. Reportedly, United agreed to a trade of a conditional draft pick to New York Red Bulls, who had gained discovery claim priority on Acosta, after United had relinquished its own. As preseason continued, the team released Conor Doyle {{to make way for a}} trialist from USL side Pittsburgh Riverhounds, winger Rob Vincent. United took to the pitch for the first time in 2016, with a 2015-16 CONCACAF Champions League quarterfinal series against Queretaro FC. In a match in the Mexican mountain city, D.C. United mostly held its own. But, missed chances by the visitors opened the door for the home team, which scored twice in the final 20 minutes, to take a daunting 2-0 lead in the series.|$|E

He also claims he [...] "really thought that was it for the group. I had every intention of signing off. I {{wanted to make the}} ultimate 'fuck off' record, and then sign off [...] ". Smith was mentally exhausted during that period of time: [...] "I was in a really depressed frame of mind between 1981 and 1982".

Babe saw herself in Abi and {{she really wanted to}} help her." [...] Abi's attempt at getting pregnant is unsuccessful so when Abi suffers a fall in The Vic, Babe persuades Abi to fake a miscarriage.

500|$|She was {{considered}} for the role eventually played by Cécile de France in Un Secret (2007). Additionally, she was initially approached for the female lead in Lars von Trier's controversial film Antichrist (2009). According to Trier, Green was positive about appearing in the film, but her agents refused to allow her. The unsuccessful casting attempt took two months of the film's pre-production process. Anglo-French actress Charlotte Gainsbourg was subsequently cast in the role. Green later said that she got along well with Trier, [...] "but then we started talking about nudity and sex and so on. It <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> too far ... It was my dream to work with him, but it’s a shame it was on that film that it nearly happened. I’m sure I would have been trashed doing that film".|$|E
500|$|During the mid 1960s, {{pop music}} made {{repeated}} forays into new sounds, styles, and techniques that inspired public discourse among its listeners. The word [...] "progressive" [...] was frequently used, {{and it was}} thought that every song and single was to be a [...] "progression" [...] from the last. The Beatles' Paul McCartney intimated in 1967: [...] "we [...] <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> bored with 12 bars all the time, so we tried to get into something else. Then came [...] Dylan, the Who, and the Beach Boys.... We're all trying to do vaguely the same kind of thing." [...] Before the progressive pop of the late 1960s, performers were typically unable to decide on the artistic content of their music. The Beach Boys' leader Brian Wilson is credited for setting a precedent that allowed bands and artists to enter a recording studio and act as their own producers.|$|E

500|$|Spins Colin Joyce was {{impressed}} by [...] "Start a War". He stated that [...] "the number {{seems to be the}} sort of skyward ballad that [...] has made her wheelhouse" [...] and found it to be [...] "a good look for Stefani". Stassa Edwards of Jezebel was equally positive, declaring that it [...] "has all of the hallmarks of a Sia ballad – those mournful, moody bridges that Sia does so well". Edwards concluded by saying she enjoyed the feathery-inspired setup that accompanied Stefani's performance. Richard Baxter, a blogger on Popology Now, largely praised the track. He wrote: [...] "As expected, 'Start a War' is very much in the veins of a typical Sia ballad. Same sound, same melodies, yet Gwen makes the song her own by not channeling Sia's vocals." [...] Baxter continued: [...] "It's <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of radio appeal, at least from what we can understand, and Gwen sounds pretty phenomenal." [...] Also writing of Stefani's vocals, Julien Goncalves on the French website Purebreak Charts was pleased that the [...] "aerial" [...] song was strong enough to emphasize her voice.|$|E
500|$|In 1966, {{the level}} of social and artistic {{correspondence}} among British and American rock musicians dramatically accelerated for bands like the Beatles, the Beach Boys and the Byrds who fused elements of cultivated music with the vernacular traditions of rock. Progressive rock was predicated on the [...] "progressive" [...] pop groups from the 1960s who combined rock and roll with various other music styles such as Indian ragas, oriental melodies and Gregorian chants, like the Beatles and the Yardbirds. The Beatles' Paul McCartney said in 1967: [...] "we [...] <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> bored with 12 bars all the time, so {{we tried to get}} into something else. Then came Dylan, the Who, and the Beach Boys. ... We're all trying to do vaguely the same kind of thing." [...] Rock music started to take itself seriously, paralleling earlier attempts in jazz (as swing gave way to bop, a move which did not succeed with audiences). In this period, the popular song began signalling a new possible means of expression that went beyond the three-minute love song, leading to an intersection between the [...] "underground" [...] and the [...] "establishment" [...] for listening publics.|$|E
500|$|The group {{employed}} Brian Eno and his assisting partner Mark [...] "Flood" [...] Ellis—both of whom {{worked on}} Achtung Baby—to produce the sessions; long-time Eno collaborator Daniel Lanois was busy promoting his solo album and was unavailable. Similar to the Achtung Baby sessions, Eno worked two-week shifts. The group often gave him in-progress songs to adjust {{and to which}} he could add his own personality. Initially, the band {{did not have a}} clear plan for how they would release the material being written. At the time, Clayton said, [...] "I don't know if what we're doing here is the next U2 album or a bunch of rough sketches that in two years will turn into the demos for the next U2 album." [...] The Edge was a proponent of making an EP of new material to promote the upcoming leg of the tour, describing his mentality as thus: [...] "We've <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of time off. We've got some ideas hanging around from the last record, let's do an EP, maybe four new songs to spice the next phase of the tour up a bit. It'll be a fan thing. It'll be cool." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{day after}} leaving CSSD in 1987, Nesbitt <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> part in Virtuoso, a BBC Two Screen Two {{television}} play {{about the life}} of John Ogdon. He worked for two days on the play, earning £250 per day. His first professional stage appearance came in the same year, when he played Keith in Up on the Roof. The musical ran at the Theatre Royal, Plymouth, before transferring to the London West End. Nesbitt reprised the role when the production returned to Plymouth in early 1989. Roger Malone in The Stage and Television Today wrote that Nesbitt [...] "steals the show with the best lines and best delivery as he laconically squares up to life with an easy contentment". Nesbitt appeared in two other plays in 1989; in June, he played Dukes Frederick and Senior in Paul Jepson's As You Like It at the Rose Theatre Club, and then appeared in Yuri Lyubimov's version of Hamlet. Hamlet had been translated back to English from Boris Pasternak's Russian translation. It ran at the Haymarket Theatre, Leicester for a month before a transfer to the Old Vic and then a nine-month world tour. Nesbitt played Guildenstern, Barnardo and the second gravedigger. He recalled that the play received [...] "shocking" [...] reviews, but was exciting.|$|E
500|$|... "Yellow" [...] {{was written}} in [...] Rockfield studio in Wales called the Quadrangle, where Coldplay began working on their debut album, Parachutes. One night after {{finishing}} recording [...] "Shiver", the band took a break and {{went out of the}} studio. Outside, there were few lights on and the stars in the sky were visible and [...] "just amazing", according to the song's co-producer, Ken Nelson. He told the band to look at the stars, which they did. Lead singer Chris Martin was inspired by the sight and the song's main melody, consisting of a chord pattern, popped into his head. At first, Martin did not take it seriously [...] "as he relayed the tune {{to the rest of the}} band in his worst Neil Young impersonation voice". Martin has said, [...] "The song had the word 'stars' and that seemed like a word you should sing in a Neil Young voice." [...] The melody [...] "started off a lot slower", according to drummer Will Champion, and it sounded like a Neil Young song. Not long after, despite not taking the song seriously, Martin's idea worked out when he had developed the tempo of the verse. When guitarist Jonny Buckland started playing it and supplemented it with his ideas, they had created the riff, [...] "and it sort of <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> heavier".|$|E

Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A, the best grade of the night, saying [...] "Simpsons was one of their best episodes in a long time, and it continues a season that's had some pretty good episodes overall. I wouldn't put this on The Simpsons' top tier, but I think it's definitely on that next tier down, episodes that maybe don't have the most original plots but do have solid jokes throughout. Even the Bart and Lisa B-plot, involving Lisa getting a sudden addiction to Olympic pin collecting, starts out kind of bland and gets better and better as Lisa's jones grows." [...] Jason Hughes of the TV Squad gave the episode a positive review as well saying [...] "All in all, it was a weird time out of Springfield this week, with some highlight moments sprinkled throughout". Steve Tilley of the Toronto Sun wrote [...] "Sure, the episode was probably funnier for Canadians and curlers (and maybe Harry Potter fans) than anyone else, but it did prove Homer has <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of meteorological, psychic in him: 'Pack your winter coat, we're going to Canada's warmest city!'" ...|$|E
