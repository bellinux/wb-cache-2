30|$|In the {{crystalline}} basement terrain of SW-Nigeria which constitutes almost one-fifth of Nigeria, groundwater occurrences are largely limited to shallow weathered overburden units {{and degree of}} fracturing of the bedrocks. These serve as the main sources of freshwater supply for domestic and industrial purposes, especially in the rural and sub-urban areas with no public/municipal water supply. In addition, {{it should be noted}} that since early 1990 s, most of the major cities and urban centres are increasingly relying on groundwater system too, due to the failing public/municipal pipe borne-water supply systems. This situation had resulted in a significant increase of indiscriminate exploitation of groundwater resources and random sitting of dug-wells and boreholes leading to attendant high failure rate. Consequently, to forestall possible negative impacts of indiscriminate exploitation in terms of lowering of water level and groundwater quality deterioration, it is, therefore, necessary to have a proper understanding of the <b>hydrogeological</b> <b>condition</b> and groundwater potentiality in such basement terrain.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{impacts of}} climate change and human {{pressure}} in groundwater have been greatest threats facing small islands. This paper represents {{a case study of}} groundwater responses towards the climate change and human pressures in Manukan Island Malaysia. SEAWAT- 2000 was used for the simulations of groundwater response in study area. Simulations of six scenarios representing climate change and human pressures showed changes in hydraulic heads and chloride concentrations. Reduction in pumping rate and an increase in recharge rate can alter the bad effects of overdrafts in Manukan Island. In general, reduction in pumping rate and an increase in recharge rate are capable to restore and protect the groundwater resources in Manukan Island. Thus, for groundwater management options in Manukan Island, scenario 2 is capable to lessen the seawater intrusion into the aquifer and sustain water resources on a long-term basis. The selection of scenario 6 is the preeminent option during wet season. The output of this study provides a foundation which can be used in other small islands of similar <b>hydrogeological</b> <b>condition</b> for the purpose of groundwater resources protection...|$|R

40|$|The {{usage of}} {{reclaimed}} water can efficiently mitigate water crises, {{but it may}} cause groundwater pollution. To clearly understand the potential influences of long-term reclaimed water usage, a total of 91 samples of shallow and deep groundwater were collected from a typical reclaimed water use area during the dry and rainy seasons. The results suggest both shallow and deep groundwater are mainly naturally alkaline freshwater, which are composed mainly of Ca-HCO 3, followed by mixed types such as Ca-Na-HCO 3 and Ca-Mg-HCO 3. A seasonal desalination trend was observed in both shallow and deep aquifers due to dilution effects in the rainy season. Groundwater chemical compositions in both shallow and deep aquifers are still dominantly controlled by natural processes such as silicate weathering, minerals dissolution and cation exchange. Human activities are also the factors influencing groundwater chemistry. Urbanization has been found responsible for the deterioration of groundwater quality, especially in shallow aquifers, because of the relative thin aquitard. Reclaimed water usage for agricultural irrigation and landscape purposes has nearly no influences on groundwater quality in rural areas due to thick aquitards. Therefore, reclaimed water usage should be encouraged in arid and semiarid areas with proper <b>hydrogeological</b> <b>condition...</b>|$|R

With the assumption of radial water flow pattern in the rock mass during the HPPT, a theoretical formula was presented to estimate the coefficient of permeability of the rock mass using water pressures in injection and measuring boreholes.
