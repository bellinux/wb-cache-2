25|$|Some <b>existing</b> <b>research</b> {{focuses on}} the ways that {{political}} campaigns, parties, and candidates have incorporated new media into their political strategizing. This is often a multi-faceted approach that combines new and old media forms to create highly specialized strategies. This allows them to reach wider audiences, but also to target very specific subsets of the electorate. They are able to tap into polling data {{and in some cases}} harness the analytics of the traffic and profiles on various social media outlets to get real-time data about the kinds of engagement that is needed and the kinds of messages that are successful or unsuccessful.|$|E

Since then, campaigns also have their outreach methods by developing targeted messages for specific audiences that can be reached via different social media platforms.

The Ministry’s National Infrastructure Programme aims to create {{a critical mass of}} knowledge in national priority fields and to nurture the younger generation of scientists.

Over 80% of the ministry’s budget is channelled towards research in academic institutions and research institutes, as well as towards revamping scientific infrastructure by upgrading <b>existing</b> <b>research</b> facilities and establishing new ones. In 2012, the ministry resolved to invest NIS 120 million over three years in four designated priority areas for research: brain science; supercomputing and cybersecurity; oceanography; and alternative transportation fuels. An expert panel headed by the Chief Scientist in the Ministry of Science, Technology and Space chose these four broad disciplines in the belief that they would be likely to exert the greatest practical impact on Israeli life in the near future.|$|E

However, the <b>existing</b> <b>researches</b> on PAs are still immature and far from being fully recognized. A major reason is that these researches have not been well organized so far.

After that, we analyze the network optimization problems and applications that have been challenged by PAs based on these models. Ultimately, we discuss the <b>existing</b> <b>researches</b> on PAs and identify two fundamental questions: 1) What are the characteristics of Physarum networks? 2) Why can Physarum solve some network optimization problems? Answering these two questions is essential to the future development of Physarum-inspired network optimization. Comment: Physarum polycephalum; nature-inspired algorithm; data analytic...|$|R

500|$|Carme Juncadella {{produced}} a systematic review of research as of 2013 {{related to the}} impact of NVC on the development of empathy. She found 13 studies which met her inclusion criteria (three were published in peer reviewed journals; ten were unpublished theses or researcher reports). Eleven of these suggested an increase in empathy subsequent to the application of NVC (five of these with evidence of statistical significance) and two did not. Juncadella notes several shortcomings of her review. None of the studies she included were randomized and only three used validated instruments. As a result she used a narrative synthesis review format, which, [...] "lacks precision," [...] but allows the summarization of studies of different types, sizes, outcome measures and aims. She suggests the primary limitation of her review is that a number of relevant studies exist that could not be included due to lack of availability. She suggests these might have significantly altered her results. Finally, she includes the following caveat: [...] "I must mention the inevitable subjectivity bias present throughout the whole review. In spite of the efforts made towards 'disciplined subjectivity'... my decisions show a degree of uncertainty and inaccuracy born via the tension between the weak evidence of the studies and my own convictions about the NVC model." [...] Her overall assessment of the current research on NVC's efficacy in promoting the development of empathy is that the results are promising, but [...] "would need to be confirmed with further studies bearing stronger designs and more appropriate measures." [...] She notes that a major shortcoming of the <b>existing</b> <b>research</b> is the [...] "mismatch between the constructs of the model and the validated empathy measures" [...] and suggests that improved instruments need to be developed to adequately test NVC.|$|E
