The Y-shape of the selected synthetic antenna leads to a limited frequency domain where the Fourier transform of the brightness temperature of a scene is measured: a star-shape experimental frequency coverage. The resulting truncation causes Gibbs oscillations {{to appear in the}} reconstructed brightness temperature maps. The windowing principle is to reduce Fourier components near zero at the boundaries of the experimental frequency domain {{in order to reduce the}} sharp frequency cut-off. Previous works have used windowing functions to reduce Fourier components near zero at the boundaries of the star-shape experimental frequency coverage. However, these functions depend only on a radial parameter. As a consequence, sharp frequency cut-off still remains near the troughs of the star where the Fourier components may not be damped down to zero.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The energy {{confinement}} time of TCV ohmic L mode discharges depends strongly on plasma shape. For fixed average current and electron densities, {{confinement time}}s increase with plasma elongation and decrease with (positive) plasma triangularity. This dependence {{can be explained}} by the geometrical effects of flux surface expansion and compression on the temperature gradients together with the effect of power degradation, without the need to invoke a shape dependence of the transport coefficients. A global <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> <b>merit,</b> the shape enhancement factor H,, is introduced to quantify this geometrical effect. The shape enhancement factor also has the potential to improve the description of the shape dependence in existing interdevice scaling laws. Modified versions of Nec-Alcator scaling and of Rebut-Lallia-Watkins scaling provide successful descriptions of ohmic L mode confinement for a large variety of plasma shapes in TCV by making use of H,. Magnetohydrodynamic activity is also strongly dependent on plasma shape. Sawtooth amplitudes are largest at positive triangularity and sometimes vanish at negative triangularity, where the amplitude of MHD modes is highest.

40|$|Integration of {{structures}} and functions allowed reducing electric consumptions of sensors, actuators and electronic devices. Therefore, {{it is now}} possible to imagine low-consumption devices able to harvest their energy in their surrounding environment. One way to proceed is to develop converters able to turn mechanical energy, such as vibrations, into electricity: this paper focuses on electrostatic converters using electrets. We develop an accurate analytical model of a simple but efficient cantilever-based electret energy harvester. Therefore, we prove that with vibrations of 0. 1 g (1 m/s^ 2), it is theoretically possible to harvest up to 30 per gram of mobile mass. This power corresponds to the maximum output power of a resonant energy harvester according to the model of William and Yates. Simulations results are validated by experimental measurements but the issues of parasitic capacitances get a large impact. Therefore, we 'only' managed to harvest 10 per gram of mobile mass, but according to our <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> <b>merit,</b> this puts us in the best results {{of the state of the}} art.

40|$|MoO 3 /Ag/MoO 3 (MAM) {{multilayer}} {{structures were}} deposited by vacuum evaporation on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate. We demonstrate that, {{as in the}} case of glass substrate, the sheet resistance of such structures depends significantly on the Ag filmdeposition rate. When it is deposited between 0. 2 and 0. 4 nm/s, an Ag thickness of 11 nm allows achieving sheet resistance of 13 Ω/sq and an averaged transmission of 74 %. A study of the influence of the PET substrate on the optimumMoO 3 thicknesses was done. A good qualitative agreement between the theoretical calculations of the variation of the optical transmittance of the MoO 3 /Ag/MoO 3 structures is obtained. The optimum MAM structures MoO 3 (17. 5 nm) /Ag (11 nm) /MoO 3 (35 nm) has a <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> <b>merit</b> FM = 4. 21 10 − 3 (Ω/sq) − 1. Proven by the scotch test the MAM structures exhibit a good adhesion to the PET substrates. The MAM structures were also submitted to bending tests. For outer bending, the samples exhibit no variation of their resistance value, while for inner bending there is a small increase of the resistance of the MAM structures. However this increasing is smaller than that exhibited by Indium Tin Oxide. When the PET/MAM structures are used as anode in organic photovoltaic cells, it is shown that the need to use thicker Ag films inside the multilayer and to cover the MAM with Au to obtain promising Current density vs Voltage characteristics is due to the heating of the PET substrate during the deposition process...|$|R
