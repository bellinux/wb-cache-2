What {{became known as}} the York Legend had emerged in a form that would survive into Preston's Illustrations of Freemasonry, a work of 1772 which was still being reprinted in the mid 19th century. The requirement for every new admission to be sworn to the Old Charges on the bible now meant that every lodge should have its own manuscript charges, and over a hundred survive from the seventeenth century until the period in the eighteenth when their use died out. Describing them all <b>is</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> <b>scope</b> of a single article, and unnecessary since differences are only in details, such as occasional clumsy attempts to deal with the absence of Edwin, Athelstan's son, from any historical record.

Families of documents have been identified, and two systems of classification exist. A few documents deserve special attention.|$|E

The variations that constitute types occur in the various facial features on Washington, and on his Toga and on the various lines of shading on the ornaments of the stamp design. Defining all the various types among these two denominations involves a highly specialized area of study that encompasses a sizable amount of additional information whose many details need accompanying illustrations and as such <b>is</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> <b>scope</b> of this section.

There are various places on-line, one listed in 'External links', 'Identifying the 2 and 3 cent types', that can provide detailed information about the 2c and 3c design types with an assortment of illustrations and charts to aid positive identification. Various publications like the popular Scott Specialized Catalogue of US Stamps also provide detailed and illustrated information for design types.|$|E

[...] The degree to which OCB can influence judgments of job performance is relatively high. [...] Controversy exists as to whether OCB should be formally considered as a part of performance appraisal (PA).|$|E
2500|$|In-line {{holography}} {{is another}} approach that provides some unique advantages for particle imaging. Perhaps {{the largest of}} these is the use of forward scattered light, which is orders of magnitude brighter than scattering oriented normal to the beam direction. Additionally, the optical setup of such systems is much simpler because the residual light {{does not need to be}} separated and recombined at a different location. The in-line configuration also provides a relatively easy extension to apply CCD sensors, creating a separate class of experiments known as digital in-line holography. The complexity of such setups shifts from the optical setup to image post-processing, which involves the use of simulated reference beams.
