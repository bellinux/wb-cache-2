2500|$|Filming {{took place}} in the fall of 1984 at {{locations}} in Pennsylvania and Florida. All above-ground scenes were filmed at several locations around Florida, where Romero was living at the time. The opening scene was filmed in Fort Myers, Florida. The fenced in compound with the helicopter landing pad was shot at a location called Bowman's Beach <b>Helistop</b> in Sanibel. [...] Underground scenes were filmed in a former mine shaft located near Wampum, Pennsylvania, converted into a long-term storage facility for important documents. Though the mine maintained a constant temperature of about 50 degrees Fahrenheit, its high humidity played havoc with the crew's equipment and props. Mechanical and electrical failures were a constant problem throughout filming, and caused several of special effects leader Tom Savini's props to fail during the filming. Despite these failures, Savini was nominated and won the 1985 Saturn Award for best makeup effects. The remote location also complicated the transportation of crew members and equipment. Cast and crew would often sleep in the mine overnight to avoid the time-consuming travel to and from the shooting location. [...] "Zombie" [...] extras were recruited from among the citizens of Pittsburgh, with preference given to those who had worked on previous Romero films. Extras were paid $1.00 for their services, and given a hat that read [...] "I was a Zombie in Day of the Dead".|$|E

5000|$|<b>Helistop</b> - A term {{sometimes}} {{used to describe}} a minimally developed heliport for boarding and discharging passengers or cargo.|$|E
50|$|Owned by the Government of Greenland, it {{operates}} 13 airports, {{all of which}} can accommodate fixed-wing STOL operations year-round, and two can handle airliners. It also operates a large, countrywide network of heliports, of which 8 are primary heliports, while the rest are considered <b>helistops.</b>|$|R
50|$|The company employs over 400 people, mainly {{staffing}} {{the main}} airports. Most of the <b>helistops</b> are staffed by Air Greenland. Greenland Airports also owns two airport hotels, at Kangerlussuaq and Narsarsuaq. It also operates an AFIS school at Narsarsuaq. Greenland Airports is supervised by the Danish Transport Authority regarding safety rules and other regulations.|$|R
50|$|Smaller {{communities}} {{are served by}} settlement flights from the local helicopter hubs in Upernavik Airport in the Upernavik Archipelago in northwestern Greenland, in Uummannaq Heliport in the Uummannaq Fjord region in northwestern Greenland, Ilulissat Airport and Aasiaat Airport in the Disko Bay region in western Greenland, in Qaqortoq Heliport and Nanortalik Heliport in southern Greenland, and in Tasiilaq Heliport in southeastern Greenland. Out of 45 heliports served, 8 are primary, the remainder are <b>helistops.</b>|$|R

5|$|Smaller {{communities}} are served via heliports which connect with hubs located at Upernavik Airport in the Upernavik Archipelago in northwestern Greenland; at Uummannaq Heliport in the Uummannaq Fjord region in northwestern Greenland; at Ilulissat and Aasiaat Airports in the Disko Bay region in western Greenland; at Qaqortoq and Nanortalik Heliports in southern Greenland; and at Tasiilaq Heliport in southeastern Greenland. Of the 45 heliports in use, 8 are primary and {{equipped with a}} tarmac, a terminal building and permanent staff. The other heliports are <b>helistops</b> with either a gravel or grass landing area. Often helicopters need to make more than one flight for each connection to a fixed-wing flight because of passenger capacity, causing longer total travel time.|$|R
50|$|In a large {{metropolitan}} {{and urban}} areas a heliport can serve passengers needing to quickly move {{within the city}} or to outlying regions. Generally heliports can be situated closer to a town or city center than an airport for fixed-wing aircraft. The advantage in flying by helicopter to a destination or even to the city's main airport is that travel can be much faster than driving. As an example, the Downtown Manhattan Heliport in New York City provides scheduled service to John F. Kennedy International Airport and is used to move wealthy persons and important goods quickly to destinations {{as far away as}} Maryland.Some skyscrapers feature rooftop heliports or <b>helistops</b> to serve the transport needs of executives or clients. Many of these rooftop sites also serve as Emergency Helicopter Landing Facilities (EHLF) in case emergency evacuation is needed. The U.S. Bank Tower in Los Angeles is an example. Police departments use heliports as a base for police helicopters, and larger departments may have a dedicated large heliport facility dedicated such as the LAPD Hooper Heliport.|$|R
40|$|The {{rotorcraft}} operations {{will grow}} as air taxi services and business trips {{and even as}} “commuter”, intercity and line services between urban centres and touristic or economic-industrial places of special value. But actually the rising public opposition to helicopter activities reduces the number of available heliports for private and corporate operators, as environmental limits of all type of allowed operations and of suitable sites to construct new infrastructures. So the growth of scheduled rotorcraft services (passengers and freights) has to be supported not only by advances in machine’s technologies, but also by an adequate and strategically distributed infrastructure network. This vision should be supported by a global and successful strategy conducted by private industry, Aviation Authorities and Operators, also with a public information campaign aiming to make the public aware about {{the positive aspects of}} rotary wing (i. e. rescue operations, charter flights and public or security services). This paper exposes urban and territorial planning problems which heliport offers for its integration into the urban tissue and into the transport system. The complex challenge to plan and develop this system is crucial to make this infrastructure acceptable for the community. The identification of the best location of the site depends on many factors such as availability of dimensionally suitable land, airspace, modal integration, accessibility and mitigation of environmental impact. Generally a heliport identifies an area for landing and takeoff of helicopters or tiltrotors. The range goes from a simple open area without special infrastructure or parking zone to sites where scheduled air service are supported by hangars, terminals, maintenance and handling companies. However in the world over 90 % of present infrastructures (i. e. helipads or <b>helistops)</b> do not provides these services or facilities. VTOL aircrafts allow the use of heliports that are small and easily placeable within urban centres and airports (or better if they are located at independent sites out of the aerodrome). A good geographic distribution of these infrastructures could reduce airports congestion and distance between airports and cities, for fast transport links. Travel speed should be increased also by avoiding modal shift. So the main category of users that would benefit from this kind of service can be identified: wealthy tourist or business travellers, which even accept surcharges in order to obtain best comfort, efficient and fast services...|$|R
