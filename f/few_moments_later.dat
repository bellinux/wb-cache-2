5|$|On May 24, {{the strikers}} seized the Strong mine on Battle Mountain, which {{overlooked}} {{the town of}} Victor. The next day, at about 9am, 125 deputies arrived in Altman and set up camp {{at the base of}} Bull Hill. As they started to march toward the strikers' camp, miners at the Strong mine blew up the shafthouse, hurling the structure more than 300 feet into the air. A <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> <b>later,</b> the steam boiler was also dynamited, showering the deputies with timber, iron and cable. The deputies fled to the rail station and left town.|$|E
5|$|Around 1:00am (evidence on {{the precise}} time conflicts) on Monday, 8 January, a {{rumbling}} or cracking noise was {{heard from the}} vessel, followed shortly by a huge explosion within its hull. The force of the explosion was seen to blow men from the jetty into the sea. Local residents reported seeing Betelgeuse engulfed in a ball of fire a <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> <b>later.</b> A series of further explosions followed, breaking the vessel in half. Much of the oil cargo still on board ignited and this generated temperatures estimated to exceed 1,000°C. The concrete unloading jetty crumbled and firefighters, arriving on the scene from several neighbouring towns, were unable to get near the vessel. The firefighters concentrated their efforts on preventing the fire from spreading to the tanks of the storage farm and on containing the oil spillage. Local families living on the island fled for their lives.|$|E
5|$|On {{the first}} play of the fourth quarter, Thurman Thomas ran for a 31-yard {{touchdown}} that put the Bills back in front, 19–17. A few possessions later, the Giants drove down to the Bills 4yard line, but were unable to score and {{had to settle for}} a 21-yard field goal by Matt Bahr that gave the Giants a 20–19 lead. Both teams exchanged possessions before the Bills began one final drive. The Bills drove down to the Giants 30-yard line to set up what would be a potentially game-winning 47-yard field goal attempt by Scott Norwood. Just before the kick, ABC showed a graphic indicating that, on grass that season, Norwood had made just 3–of–7 field goals from at least 40yards. A <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> <b>later,</b> in what became the game's signature moment, Norwood's attempt missed wide right, and the Giants won their second Super Bowl, 20–19.|$|E

During this period, Petherick left his overcoat where only Mrs Spragg could have gained access to the envelope with the will in it. Petherick took it to his office where he was soon visited by Mr Spragg, who was left alone with the will for a <b>few</b> <b>moments.</b> Two months <b>later,</b> Clode died. When the will was opened, the sheet was blank. Petherick's problem was that Mrs Spragg had the opportunity to change the will, but the will was already in her favour, so she had the opportunity but no motive. George had the motive but no opportunity, as when he had access to the will Mr Petherick was present; thus George had motive but no opportunity.|$|R

Later at the coast of South Africa, a hungry mob of common dolphins, gannets, bronze whaler sharks, and brydes whales hunt sardines. After the feast, manta rays gobble down a <b>few</b> sardines. <b>moments</b> <b>later</b> a blanket octopus swims quietly along the current. Meanwhile, the sardines start making odd shapes. At a beach sea lions rest in the sun. In deeper water, a humpback whale and her calf start to flipper slap, spyhop, and breach. Meanwhile, the sea lions start hunting. the others on the beach watch sally lightfoot crabs crawl on the sand. The hunting sea lions are returning home, but some are eaten by a great white shark and a killer whale. In the deeper waters, a blue whale feasts on some krill. At twilight, birds are flying back to their nests. At night carnivores are out to hunt on the reef including the mantis shrimp who kills a crab in the movie. In Australia, a Spanish dancer comes out of its home. At day, bottlenose dolphins are leaping on the waves. Meanwhile, a dugong and green sea turtle are feasting on sea grass. On the beach, baby sea turtles have {{to make it to the}} ocean without being eaten by frigatebirds, which only one baby turtle survives. In the sea, sailfish are feasting on fish.|$|R

5|$|As {{physical}} {{on the ice}} as Bouchard was, he {{was also}} regarded as a clean player and only rarely participated in hockey fights. Immensely strong, most players avoided engaging him in fights and Bouchard more often would be the person to break up combatants. However, it was a fight involving Bouchard {{which led to a}} significant change in the role of referees. During the 1946–47 season, Bouchard became involved in a prolonged and one-sided fight with Boston's Terry Reardon. Due to the fight, Clarence Campbell, president of the NHL, added to the duties of referees; for the first time they had the responsibility of breaking up fights. Then there was the time in March 1947, in a game in Boston, as the Canadiens were coming back onto the ice for the beginning of the third period, a female fan attacked Bouchard spearing him with a hat pin. Bouchard responded by pushing the woman away forcefully. A <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> <b>later,</b> Boston police were leading Bouchard out to a police car. According to Bouchard, Pat Egan of the Boston Bruins, interceded and talked the police out of the arrest.|$|E
5|$|The {{script is}} {{characterized}} by numerous inexplicable mood and personality shifts in characters. In analyzing the film's abrupt tone shifts, Greg Sestero highlighted two scenes in particular. In the first scene, Johnny enters the rooftop {{in the middle of}} a tirade about being accused of domestic abuse, only to become abruptly cheerful upon seeing Mark; a <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> <b>later,</b> he laughs inappropriately upon learning that a friend of Mark's had been severely beaten. On set, Sestero and first assistant director Sandy Schklair repeatedly tried to convince Wiseau that the line should not be delivered as comical, but Wiseau refused to refrain from laughing. In the second instance, occurring a few scenes later, Mark attempts to kill Peter by throwing him off a roof after Peter expresses his belief that Mark is having an affair with Lisa; just as Peter is about to fall to his death, Mark pulls Peter back over the edge of the roof, apologizes, and the two continue their previous conversation with no acknowledgement of what just occurred.|$|E

5000|$|After the United States Tag Team Championship match Gordon Solie {{reported}} from backstage that RoboCop {{had arrived at}} the building, followed by RoboCop and Sting entering the arena <b>moments</b> <b>later.</b> During the segment the Four Horsemen came to ringside to attack Sting, locking him in the steel cage that Jim Cornette had been confined to earlier in the night. <b>Moments</b> <b>later</b> RoboCop ran off the Horsemen and then pulled the door off the steel cage to release Sting. The sixth match of the night, a tag team match between The Rock 'n' Roll Express (Ricky Morton and Robert Gibson) and The Freebirds (Michael Hayes and Jimmy Garvin) was billed as a [...] "Corporal Punishment" [...] match. The [...] "Corporal Punishment" [...] stipulation meant that each team was given a three-foot-long leather strap they were allowed to use during the match. The straps themselves were not widely used during the match as both teams opted to wrestle the match as a straight match with only a <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> of actual whipping. In the end, Morton rolled up Michael Hayes to win the match.|$|R

5|$|Meanwhile, Peter {{begins to}} insult Lois about her {{advancing}} age, including her minor strands of gray hair. This makes her extremely self-conscious, and soon Lois {{becomes aware of}} her lust for a younger man. After introducing her new boyfriend, Anthony, to the family, Meg goes on to make out {{with him on the}} family couch, with Lois watching over nearby. Jealous of her daughter's new-found love, she begins hitting on Anthony. Later that day, Lois sends Meg to pick up her grandfather, leaving her all alone with Anthony. The two then begin making out on the couch, but Meg returns to the house only a <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> <b>later</b> and discovers them. Angry at her mother for ruining her chance at having a normal boyfriend, Meg threatens Lois to lay off of him, pulling out one of her own teeth in frustration. Lois quickly agrees, but is still angry with Peter for continually insulting her. She confronts him about this, and he admits that he was actually embarrassed about his own advancing age, as well as his lack of fitness, and was only insulting Lois in order to distract her from the fact that she could be with a much better-looking man. He apologizes for his behavior, and Lois forgives him.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} was a {{standard}} {{match for the}} NWA World Heavyweight Championship, in which then-champion Jeff Jarrett defended the title against A.J. Styles with Tito Ortiz as Special Guest Referee. During the bout, Jarrett tried to use his signature guitar as a weapon, however was stopped by Ortiz. Styles instead tried to use it, but was also stopped by Ortiz. Styles then broke the guitar, preventing it from {{being used as a}} weapon. Jarrett earned a near-fall after performing Styles' own signature maneuver the Styles Clash. Later, Styles also gained a near-fall after performing Jarrett's own signature maneuver The Stroke. In the final minutes, Monty Brown interfered in the contest, performing the Pounce on Jarrett after Styles pushed him into Brown's path. While Ortiz was distracted by Brown, Styles covered Jarrett for a pin. Another referee came to make the count, however was stopped by Ortiz. This allowed Jarrett to hit Styles in the groin and place him {{on the top of a}} padded turnbuckle. A <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> <b>later,</b> Ortiz knocked Jarrett out after Jarrett shoved Ortiz, which allowed Styles to move from one turnbuckle to another, he then performed his Spiral Tap maneuver. Styles followed with the pinfall victory at nineteen minutes and thirty seconds to become the new NWA World Heavyweight Champion for the third time.|$|E
5|$|U.S. {{soldiers}} at outpost number 3 called on supporting artillery units at Khâm Đức to fire directly {{at their own}} position {{in an attempt to}} hold off the North Vietnamese, but they too were defeated a <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> <b>later.</b> Before sunrise, all seven outposts were firmly in North Vietnamese hands, so U.S. and allied soldiers were placed in a perilous position. The North Vietnamese had occupied all the high ground, from which they could fire down on any support aircraft that tried to resupply the camp or to evacuate people from it. By sunrise, the North Vietnamese moved closer to the Special Forces Camp under the cover of the early morning fog. About one hour before the fog was lifted, an additional 24 B-52 bombers flew in and dropped several hundred tons of bombs on suspected North Vietnamese positions south of Khâm Đức. At 08:20, General Burl W. McLaughlin – commander of the 834th Air Division – was ordered by the U.S. 7th Air Force to make an all-out effort to evacuate the besieged Special Forces Camp at Khâm Đức. By 09:35, the B-52 strikes had clearly failed to stop the North Vietnamese advance, when the camp's south-eastern perimeter was subjected to a massive ground assault.|$|E
60|$|I {{understood}} {{their air}} of anxious expectation a <b>moment</b> <b>later,</b> when Mother Otter dived like a flash from under them, leaving {{them to make}} their own way in the water. They began to swim naturally enough, but the fear of the new element was still upon them. The moment old Mother Otter appeared they made for her whimpering, but she dived again and again, or moved slowly away, and so kept them swimming. After a little they seemed to tire and lose courage. Her eyes saw it quicker than mine, and she glided between them. Both little ones turned in at the same instant and found a resting place on her back. So she brought them carefully to land again, and in a <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> they were all rolling about in the dry leaves like so many puppies.|$|R

5|$|United {{responded with}} their first {{extended}} period of possession of the half, working the ball into wide areas to be crossed into the middle, but Rooney's first couple of attempted centres were well cleared by Piqué. At the third attempt, though, Rooney's cross evaded the Barcelona defence as Touré kicked at thin air; however, it also failed to find a Manchester United player in the penalty area, both Ronaldo and Park going close. After Ronaldo was called offside in the 59thminute – despite appearing to be level with the last defender – Giggs stole the ball mid-way inside the Barcelona half before playing the ball to Ronaldo on the left wing. The Portuguese forward stepped over the ball several times {{in an attempt to}} wrong-foot Puyol, before cutting inside and playing the ball across the edge of the area towards Carrick. A sliding challenge from Busquets prevented a shot, only for the English midfielder to slide the ball out for a Barcelona goal kick while attempting to play Rooney through. Rooney was again played down the right wing a <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> <b>later,</b> but his low cross was diverted behind by Piqué, and the resulting corner came to nothing. A left-wing attack from Ronaldo followed, but after cutting inside, he gave the ball away cheaply. Barcelona immediately went on the attack down the other end, but Henry was unable to get past O'Shea and his shot was well saved by Van der Sar low at the near post.|$|E

25|$|Scott's {{final two}} years with the Jets were marred by struggles and {{controversy}} {{on and off the}} field. On January 1, 2012, the day after the Jets missed the playoffs after losing their last 3 games, Scott was fined $10,000 for showing an obscene gesture in front of a cameraman while in the locker room. That September, Scott threatened to assault a photographer in the Jets' locker room. In November, Scott tried and failed to organize a media boycott; however, it lasted only a <b>few</b> <b>moments.</b> <b>Later</b> that month, Scott verbally attacked fans after the Jets gave up 35 second quarter points in a 49-19 blowout loss to New England.

According to Pro Football Focus, Scott ranked last among inside linebackers in tackling efficiency in 2012.|$|E
25|$|Unaware of the {{situation}} on the beaches because of a smoke screen laid by the supporting destroyers, Major General Roberts sent in the two reserve units: the Fusiliers Mont-Royal and the Royal Marines. At 07:00 the Fusiliers under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Dollard Ménard in 26 landing craft sailed towards their beach. They were heavily engaged by the Germans, who hit them with heavy machine gun, mortar and grenade fire, and destroyed them; only a few men managed to reach the town. Those men were then sent in towards the centre of Dieppe and became pinned down under the cliffs and Roberts ordered the Royal Marines to land in order to support them. Not being prepared to support the Fusiliers, the Royal Marines had to transfer from their gunboats and motor boat transports onto landing craft. The Royal Marine landing craft were heavily engaged on their way in with many destroyed or disabled. Those Royal Marines that did reach the shore were either killed or captured. As he became aware of {{the situation}} the Royal Marine commanding officer Lieutenant Colonel Phillipps, stood up on the stern of his landing craft and signalled {{for the rest of his}} men to turn back.

25|$|On {{the morning}} of July 20, two 75mm guns {{commanded}} by a retired artillery officer Captain Orad de la Torre, plus one 155mm gun joined the siege. Also, a Breguet XIX warplane from the Cuatro Vientos air base bombed the barracks. At half past ten, one bomb wounded Fanjul and Sierra. A <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> <b>later</b> some soldiers inside the barracks waved a white sheet from the windows apparently {{with the intention of}} surrendering. Against the orders of Lieutenant Moreno of the Assault Guards, who were leading the attack, the crowd ran forward but other defenders fired at them from the barracks with machine guns. This happened twice, killing or wounding numbers of people. Around noon, the crowd maddened by these incidents broke through the main gate. Some surrendering defenders were massacred by the crowd in the main courtyard, several being thrown from an upper gallery. Photographs show the courtyard littered with uniformed bodies. Captain Orad de la Torre and Arturo Barea both reported seeing a number of rebel officers who had gathered in a mess room and then shot themselves. At least some of the Falangist and monarchist volunteers wearing civilian clothes were able to slip away in the confusion.|$|E
25|$|On September 7, the Shinyō Maru was sailing for Manila in convoy C-076 {{with seven}} other vessels, {{including}} two torpedo boats, two tankers, {{and four other}} medium and small cargo ships. They were sailing two to three miles off the Lanboyan Point of Zamboanga Peninsula {{on the island of}} Mindanao, when the USS Paddle found them. A few days previously, American intelligence had reported the Shinyō Maru to be carrying Japanese soldiers, so they assigned Paddle to search for it. The Paddle, under the command of Captain Byron Nowell, was 10 miles away when the Japanese were first spotted, so Nowell maneuvered forward to attack with torpedoes. A spread of four was then released {{in the direction of the}} Shinyō Maru, which was the leading ship in the convoy. Two of the torpedoes struck, both in the hold, and a <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> <b>later</b> the Paddle was lined up against one of the cargo ships. It, too, was struck by two torpedoes, so her commander grounded her on the nearby shore to prevent the ship from sinking. Just after the Shinyō Maru was hit, the guards opened fire on the prisoners with captured Thompson submachine guns, though several of the men fought their way out of the hold, with their fists and improvised weapons, and abandoned ship.|$|E
25|$|Around noon on July 23, 1968, a {{call was}} made to the Cleveland Police {{reporting}} an abandoned vehicle on Beulah Avenue between E. 123rd Street and Lakeview Road. The location was just a block north of Evans' home (at the intersection of Auburndale Avenue and Lakeview). The vehicle was ticketed at 1:25 PM, but a tow truck did not arrive until dusk. It parked {{on the north side}} of Beulah Avenue near the intersection with Lakeview Road. According to tow truck worker William McMillan, the truck backed up to the abandoned car, and then McMillan got out. He was checking the license plate of the automobile a <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> <b>later</b> when a man with a shotgun standing at the corner of Beulah and Auburndale shot him in the back. An official chronology later placed the attack on McMillan at 8:25 PM. Another man hiding in the bushes near the front of the truck fired, and shot McMillan in the side. McMillan's coworker, still in the truck, radioed for help at 8:28 PM. According to McMillan, Ahmed Evans—armed with a carbine—walked on the sidewalk across the street and demanded to know if he was stealing cars. McMillan stood and said he had no weapons. He ran toward and then north up E. 123rd Street, and Evans shot him in the right side. An African American woman on E. 123rd Street gave refuge to McMillan.|$|E
