5|$|Frank A. Vanderlip was {{president}} of the National City Bank of New York, Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, and a founder of the Federal Reserve System. He lived at the Beechwood estate and created the first Montessori school in the United States, the Scarborough School, nearby. Vanderlip also helped found and was the first president of Scarborough's Sleepy Hollow Country Club. Marian Cruger Coffin, a landscape architect, was born and grew up in Scarborough. The twentieth and last Third Assistant Secretary of State, J. Butler Wright, also lived in Scarborough, at Woodlea, later the golf house for Sleepy Hollow Country Club. Emily Taft Douglas, a U.S. Representative and wife of Senator Paul Douglas, lived in Briarcliff Manor from 1986 to her death in 1994. Composer and conductor Aaron Copland, famous for Rodeo and Fanfare for the Common Man, began spending weekdays at Mary Churchill's house in Briarcliff Manor in early 1929, and had a post office box in Briarcliff Manor. He spent almost a month living there before moving to nearby Bedford; his ultimate residence is in nearby Cortlandt Manor. Brooke Astor, a philanthropist, socialite, and member of the Astor family, lived in Briarcliff Manor for much of her life. Children's author C. B. Colby was on the village board, was the village's Fire Commissioner, and researched for the village historical society's 1977 history book. He lived on Pine Road until his death in 1977. Anna Roosevelt Halsted lived with Curtis Bean Dall on Sleepy Hollow Road; their children, Eleanor and Curtis, attended the Scarborough School. Blanchette Ferry Rockefeller, twice-president of the Museum of Modern Art, lived in the village until her death. Eugene T. Booth, a nuclear physicist and Manhattan Project developer, lived in the village. John Cheever lived in Scarborough, and spent most of his writing career in Westchester towns such as Briarcliff Manor and Ossining. He served in the Briarcliff Manor Fire Department. Coby Whitmore, a painter and magazine illustrator, lived in the village from 1945 to 1965. Pulitzer Prize-winning writer and journalist John Hersey attended public school and lived in Briarcliff Manor; he was the village's first Eagle Scout and a lifeguard at the village pool, and his mother Grace Baird Hersey was a village librarian. Folk singer and songwriter Tom Glazer lived on Long Hill Road for almost 30 years. Mathematician Bryant Tuckerman, who helped develop the Data <b>Encryption</b> <b>Standard,</b> was a long-time village resident.|$|E

25|$|The Data <b>Encryption</b> <b>Standard</b> (DES) and the Advanced <b>Encryption</b> <b>Standard</b> (AES) are {{block cipher}} designs {{that have been}} {{designated}} cryptography standards by the US government (though DES's designation was finally withdrawn after the AES was adopted). Despite its deprecation as an official standard, DES (especially its still-approved and much more secure triple-DES variant) remains quite popular; it is used across {{a wide range of}} applications, from ATM encryption to e-mail privacy and secure remote access. Many other block ciphers have been designed and released, with considerable variation in quality. Many have been thoroughly broken, such as FEAL.|$|E

25|$|Since {{differential}} cryptanalysis became public knowledge, {{it has become}} a basic concern of cipher designers.

50|$|Because Sicher is {{a closed}} source {{proprietary}} application, {{it is not}} possible to verify whether the claimed <b>encryption</b> <b>standards</b> are properly used and well implemented.

25|$|In cryptography, Camellia is a {{symmetric}} key block cipher with a block size of 128 bits and key sizes of 128, 192 and 256 bits. It was jointly developed by Mitsubishi Electric and NTT of Japan. The cipher {{has been approved}} {{for use by the}} ISO/IEC, the European Union's NESSIE project and the Japanese CRYPTREC project. The cipher has security levels and processing abilities comparable to the Advanced <b>Encryption</b> <b>Standard.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{cryptographic}} applications, {{the ability}} to find two distinct values xμ-1 and xλ+μ-1 mapped by some cryptographic function ƒ to the same value xμ may indicate a weakness in ƒ. For instance, Quisquater and Delescaille apply cycle detection algorithms {{in the search for}} a message and a pair of Data <b>Encryption</b> <b>Standard</b> keys that map that message to the same encrypted value; Kaliski, Rivest, and Sherman also use cycle detection algorithms to attack DES. The technique may also be used to find a collision in a cryptographic hash function.|$|E
25|$|On March 26, 2013, Camellia was {{announced}} {{as having been}} selected again for adoption in Japan's new e-Government Recommended Ciphers List as the only 128-bit block cipher encryption algorithm developed in Japan. This coincides with the CRYPTREC list being updated {{for the first time}} in 10 years. The selection was based on Camellia's high reputation for ease of procurement, and security and performance features comparable to those of the Advanced <b>Encryption</b> <b>Standard</b> (AES). Camellia remains unbroken in its full implementation. An impossible differentials attack on 12-round Camellia without FL/FL−1 layers does exist.|$|E

25|$|Quantum key {{distribution}} is only {{used to produce}} and distribute a key, not to transmit any message data. This key can then be used with any chosen encryption algorithm to encrypt (and decrypt) a message, which can then be transmitted over a standard communication channel. The algorithm most commonly associated with QKD is the one-time pad, as it is provably secure when used with a secret, random key. In real-world situations, it is often also used with encryption using symmetric key algorithms like the Advanced <b>Encryption</b> <b>Standard</b> algorithm.|$|E
25|$|Web-based {{services}} such as Open Diary (started in October 1998) and LiveJournal (January 1999) soon appeared to streamline and automate online publishing, but growth in personal storytelling came {{with the emergence of}} blogs. While the format first focused on external links and topical commentary, widespread blogging tools were quickly used to create web journals. Recent advances have also been made to enable the privacy of internet diary entries. For example, some diary software now stores entries in encrypted format, such 256-bit AES (Advanced <b>Encryption</b> <b>Standard)</b> encryption, and others only permit access to the diary after correct PIN entry on a secure USB device.|$|E
25|$|Support for {{wireless}} networks {{is built}} into the network stack itself, and does not emulate wired connections, {{as was the case with}} previous versions of Windows. This allows implementation of wireless-specific features such as larger frame sizes and optimized error recovery procedures. Windows Vista uses various techniques like Receive Window Auto-scaling, Explicit Congestion Notification, TCP Chimney offload and Compound TCP to improve networking performance. Quality of Service (QoS) policies can be used to prioritize network traffic, with traffic shaping available to all applications, even those that do not explicitly use QoS APIs. Windows Vista includes in-built support for peer-to-peer networks and SMB 2.0. For improved network security, Windows Vista supports for 256-bit and 384-bit Diffie-Hellman (DH) algorithms, as well as for 128-bit, 192-bit and 256-bit Advanced <b>Encryption</b> <b>Standard</b> (AES) is included in the network stack itself, while integrating IPsec with Windows Firewall.|$|E
50|$|The PEM format {{was first}} {{developed}} in the privacy-enhanced mail series of RFCs: RFC 1421, RFC 1422, RFC 1423, and RFC 1424. These standards assumed prior deployment of a hierarchical public key infrastructure (PKI) with a single root. Such a PKI was never deployed, due to operational cost and legal liability concerns. These standards were eventually obsoleted by PGP and S/MIME, competing e-mail <b>encryption</b> <b>standards.</b>|$|R

The following codenames are known to be related to BULLRUN: APERIODIC, AMBULANT, AUNTIE, PAINTEDEAGLE, PAWLEYS, PITCHFORD, PENDLETON, PICARESQUE, and PIEDMONT.
