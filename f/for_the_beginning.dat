5|$|Bowman {{remained}} with Charlotte <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> of the 2011–12 season, failing {{to make the}} Hurricanes' roster out of training camp. In November 2011, he received a call-up to Carolina that lasted five days. The following month, he was recalled again and recorded a two-goal game against the Vancouver Canucks on December 15, 2011. The goals were his first in the NHL in over a year and eight months. After being reassigned, he received two more call ups {{before the end of}} the season.

5|$|Following the Draft, the 1994–95 NHL {{season was}} {{suspended}} for three-and-a-half months due to a labour dispute between NHL players and owners. Consequently, Jovanovski remained in junior <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> of the 1994–95 OHL season. When NHL was set to resume play in January 1995, it was speculated that the Panthers might sign Jovanovski and call {{him up to the}} NHL. However, then-Panthers General Manager Bryan Murray announced that Jovanovski would remain with Windsor, citing that he would likely not receive much playing time with the club. He averaged approximately 40 minutes per game with Windsor that season, scoring 23 goals and 65 points over 50 contests. He also added nine points in nine playoff games before Windsor was eliminated. Jovanovski was named to the OHL First All-Star Team.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1806, Cabell {{learned that}} his father was sick. Not long after, however, he {{received}} word {{that his father was}} improving and expected to meet him in Virginia en route to the capital. Although a rendezvous location had not been set, he assumed it would be in Lynchburg, where the Breckinridges had relatives. In October, he traveled to his uncle Lewis Breckinridge's home to wait for his father, but he never came. Disappointed, he returned to Princeton <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> of the new term, unaware that his father's recovery had been short-lived. Later he {{learned that his}} father had attempted to leave Cabell's Dale on October 22 but collapsed off his horse and returned to his sick bed; he died December 14, 1806.|$|E

5|$|On August 30, 1493, Cairano was {{tasked with}} the {{decoration}} of {{the exterior of the}} Palazzo della Loggia with the delivery of capita 5 imperatorum romanum, or five busts <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> of a cycle of thirty Caesars, which would become among the finest achievements of his career. The production of these busts can be traced, in general, to a contemporary reworking of ancient portraiture. In the oldest busts, i.e., those facing the piazza, there are similarities with the image of Bartolomeo Colleoni in the memorial by Andrea del Verrochio in Venice, with an evoking of an effigy of Antoninus Pius and a portrait of Nero, all famous images at the time and here revived in three dimensions.|$|E
5|$|The Louisiana Tech Lady Techsters {{were ranked}} {{second in the}} country and was {{expected}} to challenge Tennessee for the national title. Tech returned all five of its starters from a team that had beaten the Vols twice the previous year. Tech came out on a 9–2 run, but led at the half by only a point. The teams played evenly <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> of the second half, before Louisiana Tech raised the lead to five with just over twelve minutes remaining. Summitt put her four freshman into the line-up, which went on a 12–0 run, giving Tennessee a lead they would never relinquish. Holdsclaw finished with a double-double (24 points, 11 rebounds), and Catchings contributed 17 points.|$|E
5|$|The crew {{moved to}} a small island in the Bahamas called White Cay <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> {{and end of the}} Isla Cruces battle, before {{production}} took a break until August, where in Los Angeles the interiors of the Flying Dutchman were shot. On September 18, 2005, the crew moved to Grand Bahama Island to shoot ship exteriors, including the working Black Pearl and Flying Dutchman. Filming there was a tumultuous period, starting {{with the fact that the}} tank had not actually been finished. The hurricane season caused many pauses in shooting, and Hurricane Wilma damaged many of the accessways and pumps, though no one was hurt nor were any of the ships destroyed. Filming completed on September 10, 2005.|$|E

5|$|The episode {{opens with}} Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) and Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) {{preparing}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> {{of her new}} talk show, Dealbreakers. Jack's rival, Devon Banks (Will Arnett), complicates the situation by threatening to publicly ridicule Jack if the show loses money. Jack, under pressure, begins to interfere with Liz's appearance, sending her over the edge with insecurity. After 510 takes, they finally settle on an opening title to the show. After Liz locks herself in her dressing room, Jack shuts Dealbreakers down, but manages to break even by selling the show's opening titles; in future, whenever a television show is playing {{in the background of}} a Sheinhardt Universals soap opera, the Dealbreakers titles will be shown.|$|E
5|$|The {{first presidential}} term {{and the first}} vice presidential term both officially started on March 4, 1789, the date set by the Congress of the Confederation <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> of {{operations}} {{of the federal government}} under the new U.S. Constitution. However, due to a delay in the counting and certification of the electoral votes, which was not done until April 6 (because although the Senate of the 1st Congress initially convened on March 4, it did not achieve a quorum until April 6, and so could not conduct business), they commenced several weeks late. Adams first presided over the Senate on April 21. Washington was inaugurated into office on April 30.|$|E
5|$|The idea <b>for</b> <b>The</b> <b>Beginning</b> or the End {{originated}} in October 1945 with actress Donna Reed, and {{her high school}} science teacher, Edward R. Tompkins, a chemist at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. According to The Hollywood Reporter issues of December 1945 and January 1946, MGM, Paramount and 20th Century-Fox were all interested in making a film about the Manhattan Project. Paramount's Hal B. Wallis was already working on his own version, titled Top Secret, but agreed to merge his project with MGM's and hand over his story and research, offering {{to serve as an}} adviser on the MGM treatment in return for a fixed fee and a percentage of the box office gross.|$|E

5|$|The rivalry was {{controlled}} by Navy for its entirety, with the Midshipmen winning nine out of twelve contests played. While Johns Hopkins' largest win was a 25–12 defeat of the Naval Academy in 1888, Navy shutout Hopkins five times, including a 66–0 blowout in the 1919 contest. The rivalry was an essential contest <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> of both schools' football programs. Prior to the first game, Navy had competed in only a single contest. Johns Hopkins began their football program with the rivalry, originally having to play under a fake title in order to compete.|$|E
5|$|When PASS Sports' {{respective}} National Hockey League and Major League Baseball broadcast {{rights to}} the Detroit Red Wings and Detroit Tigers franchises came up for renewal, Fox Sports Net made a bid for the contracts and won them both. Fox Sports decided to push the launch date of the new channel forward in time <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> of the 1997–98 NHL season and 1998 MLB season; Fox Sports Detroit began broadcasting on September 17, 1997. Post-Newsweek, meanwhile, concluded that its coverage area was not large enough to support two RSNs and sold the remainder of its Tigers and Pistons contracts, and the contract of sportscaster John Keating, to Fox Sports Detroit. Post-Newsweek shut down PASS Sports on October 31, 1997, leaving Fox Sports Detroit as the sole regional sports network in Michigan.|$|E
5|$|According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, Penda became king in 626, ruled for 30 years, and was 50 {{years old}} at the time of his accession. That he ruled for 30 years should not be taken as an exact figure, since the same source says he died in 655, which would not {{correspond}} to the year given <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> of his reign unless he died in the thirtieth year of his reign. Furthermore, that Penda was truly 50 {{years old at}} the beginning of his reign is generally doubted by historians, mainly because of the ages of his children. The idea that Penda, at about 80 years of age, would have left behind children who were still young (his son Wulfhere was still just a youth three years after Penda's death, according to Bede) has been widely considered implausible. The possibility has been suggested that the Chronicle actually meant to say that Penda was 50 {{years old at the}} time of his death, and therefore about 20 in 626.|$|E
