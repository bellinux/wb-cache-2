5|$|A {{hypothesis}} of Albertosaurus life history postulates that hatchlings died in large numbers, {{but have not}} been preserved in the fossil record due to their small size and fragile construction. After just two years, juveniles were larger than any other predator in the region aside from adult Albertosaurus, and more fleet of foot than most of their prey animals. This resulted in a dramatic decrease in their mortality rate and a corresponding rarity of fossil remains. Mortality rates doubled at age twelve, perhaps {{the result of the}} physiological demands of the rapid growth phase, and then doubled again with the onset of sexual maturity between the ages of fourteen and sixteen. This elevated mortality rate continued throughout adulthood, perhaps due to the high physiological demands of procreation, including stress and injuries received during intraspecific competition for mates and resources, and eventually, the ever-increasing effects of senescence. The higher mortality rate in adults may explain their more common preservation. Very large animals were rare because few individuals survived long enough to attain such sizes. High infant mortality rates, followed by reduced mortality among juveniles and a sudden increase in mortality after sexual maturity, with very few animals reaching maximum size, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>pattern</b> observed in many modern large mammals, including elephants, African buffalo, and rhinoceros. The same pattern is also seen in other tyrannosaurids. The comparison with modern animals and other tyrannosaurids lends support to this life history hypothesis, but bias in the fossil record may still play a large role, especially since more than two-thirds of all Albertosaurus specimens are known from one locality.|$|E

25|$|There is {{a strong}} link between {{domestic}} violence and child abuse.

25|$|The North American climate {{stabilized}} around 8000 BCE (10,000 years ago). Climatic {{conditions were}} similar to modern patterns; however, the receding glacial ice sheets still covered large portions of the land, creating lakes of meltwater. Most population groups during the Archaic periods were still highly mobile hunter-gatherers. However, individual groups started to focus on resources available to them locally; thus {{with the passage of}} time, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>pattern</b> of increasing regional generalization (i.e.: Paleo-Arctic, Plano and Maritime Archaic traditions).|$|E

25|$|The {{arrival of}} Paleoindians from Beringia {{took place between}} 20,000 and 12,000 years ago. Hunter-gatherer {{families}} were the main social structure from 10,000 to 5,000 years ago. The nomadic population lived in non-permanent structures foraging for nuts, berries and edible roots while hunting and trapping larger and small game for food and furs. Around 5,000 years ago individual groups started to focus on resources available to them locally. Thus {{with the passage of}} time there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>pattern</b> of increasing regional generalization with a more sedentary lifestyle. These indigenous populations evolved over the next 5,000 years across a large area into many groups with shared traditions and customs.|$|E

25|$|In Tunisian Arabic, as {{in other}} Semitic languages, the {{creation}} of new words is based on a root and pattern system, also known as the Semitic root. That means that new words can be created through the association of a root that is composed most of the time of three letters that have a meaning with a rhythm or pattern that informs about the position of the object in the fact. For example, K-T-B is a root meaning to write and مفعول mafʿūl <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>pattern</b> meaning that the object submitted the fact. Thus, the combination of the root and the given pattern render maKTūB, which means something that was written.|$|E
25|$|A deimatic {{displays}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>pattern</b> {{of threatening}} or startling behaviour, such as suddenly displaying conspicuous eyespots, used to scare off or momentarily distract a predator, thus giving the prey animal {{an opportunity to}} escape. For example, some moths look threatening while at rest by displaying a sinister lurking face, {{such as those of}} genus Speiredonia, or the more aggressive face of a snake poised to attack, such as many species of genus Spirama. Adult Atlas moths of the genera Attacus and Rothschildia also display snake heads. The eyed hawkmoth displays its large eyespots on its wings and moves them slowly {{as if it were a}} vertebrate predator such as an owl.|$|E
25|$|Domestic {{violence}} (also named domestic abuse, battering, {{or family}} violence) <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>pattern</b> of behavior which involves violence or other abuse by one person against {{another in a}} domestic setting, such as in marriage or cohabitation. It may be termed intimate partner violence when committed by a spouse or partner in an intimate relationship against the other spouse or partner, and can take place in heterosexual or same-sex relationships, or between former spouses or partners. Domestic violence may also involve violence against children or the elderly. It takes a number of forms, including physical, verbal, emotional, economic, religious, reproductive, and sexual abuse, which can range from subtle, coercive forms to marital rape and to violent physical abuse such as choking, beating, female genital mutilation and acid throwing that results in disfigurement or death. Domestic murders include stoning, bride burning, honor killings, and dowry deaths.|$|E
