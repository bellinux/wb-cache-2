25|$|In 2009, Ohio {{approved}} {{the use of}} an intramuscular injection of 500 mg of <b>hydromorphone</b> (a 333-fold overdose for an opioid-naïve patient of this narcotic analgesic closely related to and five times stronger than morphine; this is the equivalent of an entire 50-ml bottle of Dilaudid HP, the most powerful commercially available form, although the advantage of <b>hydromorphone</b> is its very high solubility allowing for solutions of almost arbitrary concentration; 500 mg of <b>hydromorphone</b> HCl as pure powder can be dissolved in isotonic saline in volumes as small as under 2 cc) and a supratherapeutic dose of midazolam as a backup means of carrying out executions when a suitable vein cannot be found for intravenous injection.|$|E
25|$|People on {{high-dose}} buprenorphine therapy may be {{unaffected by}} even large doses of opioids such as oxycodone, morphine, or <b>hydromorphone.</b>|$|E
25|$|Among the narcotics, it is opiates such as {{morphine}} and codeine, and opioids such as diacetylmorphine (Heroin), hydrocodone (Vicodin; Hycodan), oxycodone (Percocet; Oxycontin), <b>hydromorphone</b> (Dilaudid), and oxymorphone (Opana).|$|E
25|$|Morphine is a {{precursor}} {{in the manufacture}} in {{a large number of}} opioids such as dihydromorphine, <b>hydromorphone,</b> hydrocodone, and oxycodone as well as codeine, which itself has a large family of semi-synthetic derivatives. Morphine is commonly treated with acetic anhydride and ignited to yield heroin.|$|E
25|$|It is more lipid-soluble than morphine, {{resulting}} in a faster onset of action. Its duration of clinical effect is 120–150 minutes, although it is typically administered at 4– to 6-hour intervals. Pethidine {{has been shown to}} be less effective than morphine, diamorphine, or <b>hydromorphone</b> at easing severe pain, or pain associated with movement or coughing.|$|E
25|$|Levomepromazine is {{frequently}} prescribed and valued worldwide in palliative care medicine for its multimodal action, to treat intractable nausea or vomiting, and for severe delirium/agitation {{in the last}} days of life. Palliative care physicians will commonly prescribe it orally or via subcutaneous syringe drivers in combination with opioid analgesics such as <b>hydromorphone.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{data from}} the U.S. Drug Abuse Warning Network, {{mentions}} of hazardous or harmful use of pethidine declined between 1997 and 2002, in contrast to increases for fentanyl, <b>hydromorphone,</b> morphine, and oxycodone. The number of dosage units of pethidine reported lost or stolen in the U.S. increased 16.2% between 2000 and 2003, from 32,447 to 37,687.|$|E
25|$|The methyl {{group that}} makes {{morphine}} into codeine {{can be removed}} or added back, or replaced with another functional group like ethyl and others to make codeine analogues of morphine-derived drugs and vice versa. Codeine analogues of morphine-based drugs often serve as prodrugs of the stronger drug, as in codeine and morphine, hydrocodone and <b>hydromorphone,</b> oxycodone and oxymorphone, nicocodeine and nicomorphine, dihydrocodeine and dihydromorphine, etc.|$|E
25|$|The {{production}} of opium {{has not changed}} since ancient times. Through selective breeding of the Papaver somniferum plant, {{the content of the}} phenanthrene alkaloids morphine, codeine, {{and to a lesser extent}} thebaine has been greatly increased. In modern times, much of the thebaine, which often serves as the raw material for the synthesis for hydrocodone, <b>hydromorphone,</b> and other semisynthetic opiates, originates from extracting Papaver orientale or Papaver bracteatum.|$|E
25|$|Fentanyl in {{injectable}} formulation {{is commonly}} used for analgesia and {{as a component of}} balanced sedation and general anaesthesia in small animal patients. Its potency and short duration of action make it particularly useful in critically ill patients. In addition, it tends to cause less vomiting and regurgitation than other pure-opioid agonists (morphine, <b>hydromorphone)</b> when given as a continuous post-operative infusion. As with other pure opioids, fentanyl can be associated with dysphoria in both dogs and cats.|$|E
25|$|Opioids {{are safe}} and {{effective}} at providing pain control in patients with acute pancreatitis. Adequate pain control {{requires the use of}} intravenous opiates, usually {{in the form of a}} patient-controlled analgesia pump. <b>Hydromorphone</b> or fentanyl (intravenous) may be used for pain relief in acute pancreatitis. Fentanyl is being increasingly used due to its better safety profile, especially in renal impairment. As with other opiates, fentanyl can depress respiratory function. It can be given both as a bolus as well as constant infusion.|$|E
25|$|Oxycodone is {{available}} as controlled-release tablet, {{intended to be}} taken every 12 hours. A 2006 review found that controlled-release oxycodone is comparable to instant-release oxycodone, morphine, and <b>hydromorphone</b> in management of moderate to severe cancer pain, with fewer side effects than morphine. The author concluded that the controlled release form is a valid alternative to morphine and a first-line treatment for cancer pain. In 2014, the European Association for Palliative Care recommended oral oxycodone as a second-line alternative to oral morphine for cancer pain.|$|E
25|$|The clandestine {{conversion}} of morphine to ketones of the <b>hydromorphone</b> class or other derivatives like dihydromorphine (Paramorfan), desomorphine (Permonid), metopon, etc. and codeine to hydrocodone (Dicodid), dihydrocodeine (Paracodin), etc. is more involved, time-consuming, requires lab equipment of various types, and usually requires expensive catalysts and {{large amounts of}} morphine at the outset and is less common but still has been discovered by authorities in various ways during the last 20 years or so. Dihydromorphine can be acetylated into another 3,6 morphine diester, namely diacetyldihydromorphine (Paralaudin), and hydrocodone into thebacon.|$|E
25|$|Like other opioid drugs, {{pethidine}} has {{the potential}} to cause physical dependence or addiction. It {{may be more likely to}} be abused than other prescription opioids, perhaps because of its rapid onset of action. When compared with oxycodone, <b>hydromorphone,</b> and placebo, pethidine was consistently associated with more euphoria, difficulty concentrating, confusion, and impaired psychomotor and cognitive performance when administered to healthy volunteers. The especially severe side effects unique to pethidine among opioids—serotonin syndrome, seizures, delirium, dysphoria, tremor—are primarily or entirely due to the action of its metabolite, norpethidine.|$|E
25|$|The Ohio protocol, {{developed}} {{after the}} incomplete execution of Romell Broom, ensures the rapid and painless onset of anesthesia by only using sodium thiopental and eliminating {{the use of}} Pavulon and potassium as {{the second and third}} drugs, respectively. It also provides for a secondary fail-safe measure using intramuscular injection of midazolam and <b>hydromorphone</b> in the event intravenous administration of the sodium thiopental proves problematic. The first state to switch to use midazolam as the first drug in a new three-drug protocol was Florida on October 15, 2013. Then on November 14, 2013, Ohio made the same move.|$|E
25|$|Another {{source of}} illicit {{morphine}} {{comes from the}} extraction of morphine from extended-release morphine products, such as MS-Contin. Morphine can be extracted from these products with simple extraction techniques to yield a morphine solution that can be injected. As an alternative, the tablets can be crushed and snorted, injected or swallowed, although this provides much less euphoria but retains some of the extended-release effect, and the extended-release property is why MS-Contin is used in some countries alongside methadone, dihydrocodeine, buprenorphine, dihydroetorphine, piritramide, levo-alpha-acetylmethadol (LAAM), and special 24-hour formulations of <b>hydromorphone</b> for maintenance and detoxification of those physically dependent on opioids.|$|E
25|$|At {{the press}} conference held by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation on July 17, 2007, it was {{announced}} that three different drugs were found in Nancy Benoit's system: hydrocodone, <b>hydromorphone</b> and Xanax. All three drugs were found to be at levels investigators considered normal for therapeutic treatment (as opposed to recreational use or abuse.) A blood-alcohol level was found at 0.184. Dr. Kris Sperry, the medical examiner, added it was impossible to say whether any of the blood findings was due to ingestion of alcohol or the post-mortem process. It was also ruled out that Nancy was sedated by Chris before she was murdered.|$|E
25|$|Most of the licit {{morphine}} produced {{is used to}} make codeine by methylation. It is also {{a precursor}} for many drugs including heroin (3,6-diacetylmorphine), <b>hydromorphone</b> (dihydromorphinone), and oxymorphone (14-hydroxydihydromorphinone); many morphine derivatives can also be manufactured using thebaine or codeine as a starting material. Replacement of the N-methyl group of morphine with an N-phenylethyl group results in a product that is 18 times more powerful than morphine in its opiate agonist potency. Combining this modification with {{the replacement of the}} 6-hydroxyl with a 6-methylene group produces a compound some 1,443 times more potent than morphine, stronger than the Bentley compounds such as etorphine (M99, the Immobilon tranquilliser dart) by some measures.|$|E
25|$|The {{primary source}} of {{morphine}} is isolation from poppy straw of the opium poppy. In 2013, an estimated 523000kg of morphine were produced. About 45000kg were used directly for pain, a four-time increase over the last twenty years. Most use for this purpose was in the developed world. About 70% of morphine is used to make other opioids such as <b>hydromorphone,</b> oxymorphone, and heroin. It is a Schedule II drug in the United States, Class A in the United Kingdom, and Schedule I in Canada. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, {{the most effective and}} safe medicines needed in a health system. Morphine is sold under many trade names.|$|E
25|$|Jackson {{was said}} to have used propofol, as well as {{alprazolam}} (an antianxiety agent), and sertraline (an antidepressant). Other drugs named in connection with him included omeprazole, hydrocodone, paroxetine, carisoprodol, and <b>hydromorphone.</b> After his death, police found several drugs in his home, which included propofol. Some of these drugs had labels made out to Jackson under pseudonyms, while others were unlabeled. A 2004 police document prepared for the 2005 People v. Jackson child abuse trial alleged that Jackson was taking up to 40 alprazolam pills a night. Alprazolam was not found in his bloodstream at his time of death. Dr. A.J. Farshchian, Michael Jackson's friend and confidante, has claimed that Jackson was scared of drugs.|$|E
25|$|Animal {{and human}} studies and {{clinical}} experience {{back up the}} contention that morphine {{is one of the}} most euphoric drugs known, and via all but the IV route heroin and morphine cannot be distinguished according to studies because heroin is a prodrug for the delivery of systemic morphine. Chemical changes to the morphine molecule yield other euphorigenics such as dihydromorphine, <b>hydromorphone</b> (Dilaudid, Hydal), and oxymorphone (Numorphan, Opana), as well as the latter three's methylated equivalents dihydrocodeine, hydrocodone, and oxycodone, respectively; in addition to heroin, there are dipropanoylmorphine, diacetyldihydromorphine, and other members of the 3,6 morphine diester category like nicomorphine and other similar semi-synthetic opiates like desomorphine, hydromorphinol, etc. used clinically in many countries of the world but in many cases also produced illicitly in rare instances.|$|E
25|$|Morphine was {{the most}} {{commonly}} abused narcotic analgesic in the world until heroin was synthesized and came into use. In general, until the synthesis of dihydromorphine (ca. 1900), the dihydromorphinone class of opioids (1920s), and oxycodone (1916) and similar drugs, {{there were no other}} drugs in the same efficacy range as opium, morphine, and heroin, with synthetics still several years away (pethidine was invented in Germany in 1937) and opioid agonists among the semi-synthetics were analogues and derivatives of codeine such as dihydrocodeine (Paracodin), ethylmorphine (Dionine), and benzylmorphine (Peronine). Even today, morphine is the most sought after prescription narcotic by heroin addicts when heroin is scarce, all other things being equal; local conditions and user preference may cause <b>hydromorphone,</b> oxymorphone, high-dose oxycodone, or methadone as well as dextromoramide in specific instances such as 1970s Australia, to top that particular list. The stop-gap drugs used by the largest absolute number of heroin addicts is probably codeine, with significant use also of dihydrocodeine, poppy straw derivatives like poppy pod and poppy seed tea, propoxyphene, and tramadol.|$|E
25|$|Morphine is {{the most}} {{abundant}} opiate found in opium, the dried latex extracted by shallowly scoring the unripe seedpods of the Papaver somniferum poppy. Morphine is generally 8–14% of the dry weight of opium, although specially bred cultivars reach 26% or produce little morphine at all (under 1%, perhaps down to 0.04%). The latter varieties, including the 'Przemko' and 'Norman' cultivars of the opium poppy, are used to produce two other alkaloids, thebaine and oripavine, which {{are used in the}} manufacture of semi-synthetic and synthetic opioids like oxycodone and etorphine and some other types of drugs. P. bracteatum does not contain morphine or codeine, or other narcotic phenanthrene-type, alkaloids. This species is rather a source of thebaine. Occurrence of morphine in other Papaverales and Papaveraceae, as well as in some species of hops and mulberry trees has not been confirmed. Morphine is produced most predominantly early in the life cycle of the plant. Past the optimum point for extraction, various processes in the plant produce codeine, thebaine, and in some cases negligible amounts of <b>hydromorphone,</b> dihydromorphine, dihydrocodeine, tetrahydro-thebaine, and hydrocodone (these compounds are rather synthesized from thebaine and oripavine).|$|E
25|$|Morphine is {{a highly}} {{addictive}} substance. In controlled studies comparing the physiological and subjective effects of heroin and morphine in individuals formerly addicted to opiates, subjects showed no preference for one drug over the other. Equipotent, injected doses had comparable action courses, with no difference in subjects' self-rated feelings of euphoria, ambition, nervousness, relaxation, drowsiness, or sleepiness. Short-term addiction studies by the same researchers demonstrated that tolerance developed at a similar rate to both heroin and morphine. When compared to the opioids <b>hydromorphone,</b> fentanyl, oxycodone, and pethidine/meperidine, former addicts showed a strong preference for heroin and morphine, suggesting that heroin and morphine are particularly susceptible to abuse and addiction. Morphine and heroin were also {{much more likely to}} produce euphoria and other positive subjective effects when compared to these other opioids. The choice of heroin and morphine over other opioids by former drug addicts may also be because heroin (also known as morphine diacetate, diamorphine, or diacetyl morphine) is an ester of morphine and a morphine prodrug, essentially meaning they are identical drugs in vivo. Heroin is converted to morphine before binding to the opioid receptors in the brain and spinal cord, where morphine causes the subjective effects, which is what the addicted individuals are seeking.|$|E
25|$|Morphine can {{be taken}} orally, sublingually, bucally, rectally, subcutaneously, intranasally, intravenously, intrathecally or epidurally and inhaled via a nebulizer. As a {{recreational}} drug, it is becoming more common to inhale ("Chasing the Dragon"), but, for medical purposes, intravenous (IV) injection {{is the most common}} method of administration. Morphine is subject to extensive first-pass metabolism (a large proportion is broken down in the liver), so, if taken orally, only 40% to 50% of the dose reaches the central nervous system. Resultant plasma levels after subcutaneous (SC), intramuscular (IM), and IV injection are all comparable. After IM or SC injections, morphine plasma levels peak in approximately 20min, and, after oral administration, levels peak in approximately 30min. Morphine is metabolised primarily in the liver and approximately 87% of a dose of morphine is excreted in the urine within 72h of administration. Morphine is metabolized primarily into morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G) and morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G) via glucuronidation by phase II metabolism enzyme UDP-glucuronosyl transferase-2B7 (UGT2B7). About 60% of morphine is converted to M3G, and 6% to 10% is converted to M6G. Not only does the metabolism occur in the liver but it may also take place in the brain and the kidneys. M3G does not undergo opioid receptor binding and has no analgesic effect. M6G binds to μ-receptors and is half as potent an analgesic as morphine in humans. Morphine may also be metabolized into small amounts of normorphine, codeine, and <b>hydromorphone.</b> Metabolism rate is determined by gender, age, diet, genetic makeup, disease state (if any), and use of other medications. The elimination half-life of morphine is approximately 120min, though there may be slight differences between men and women. Morphine can be stored in fat, and, thus, can be detectable even after death. Morphine can cross the blood–brain barrier, but, because of poor lipid solubility, protein binding, rapid conjugation with glucuronic acid and ionization, it does not cross easily. Diacetylmorphine, which is derived from morphine, crosses the blood–brain barrier more easily, making it more potent.|$|E
500|$|Midazolam {{has been}} used as part of a three-drug cocktail, with vecuronium bromide and {{potassium}} chloride in Florida and Oklahoma prisons. [...] Midazolam has also been used along with <b>hydromorphone</b> in a two-drug protocol in Ohio and Arizona. Ohio used midazolam in the execution of Dennis McGuire in January 2014; it took McGuire 24 minutes to die after the procedure started, and he gasped and appeared to be choking during that time, leading to questions about the dosing and timing of the drug administration, as well as the choice of drugs.|$|E

2500|$|It was {{discovered}} in 1953, that humans and some animals naturally produce minute amounts of morphine, codeine, and possibly some of their simpler derivatives like heroin and dihydromorphine, in addition to endogenous opioid peptides. [...] Some bacteria are capable of producing some semi-synthetic opioids such as <b>hydromorphone</b> and hydrocodone when living in a solution containing morphine or codeine respectively.|$|E
2500|$|Approved {{indication}} for dihydrocodeine is {{the management}} of moderate to moderately severe pain as well as coughing and shortness of breath. [...] As {{is the case with}} other drugs in this group, the antitussive dose tends to be less than the analgesic dose, and dihydrocodeine is a powerful cough suppressant like all other members of the immediate codeine family (see below) and their cousins hydrocodone, oxycodone and ethylmorphine, whole opium preparations, and the strong opioid <b>hydromorphone.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Toxicology reports {{released}} on July 17, 2007, revealed that at their time of death, Nancy had three different drugs in her system: Xanax, hydrocodone, and <b>hydromorphone,</b> {{all of which}} were found at the therapeutic rather than toxic levels. Daniel was found to have Xanax in his system, which led the chief medical examiner to believe that he was sedated before he was murdered. Benoit was found to have Xanax, hydrocodone, and an elevated level of testosterone, caused by a synthetic form of the hormone, in his system. The chief medical examiner attributed the testosterone level to Benoit possibly being treated for a deficiency caused by previous steroid abuse or testicular insufficiency. There was no indication that anything in Benoit's body contributed to his violent behaviour that led to the murder–suicide, concluding that there was no [...] "roid-rage" [...] involved. Prior to the murder–suicide, Benoit had been given illegal steroids not in compliance with WWE's Talent Wellness Program in February 2006. Benoit received nandrolone and anastrozole.
