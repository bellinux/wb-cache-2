5|$|Amazing Stories is an American {{science fiction}} {{magazine}} launched in April 1926 by Hugo Gernsback's <b>Experimenter</b> Publishing. It {{was the first}} magazine devoted solely to science fiction. Science fiction stories had made regular appearances in other magazines, including some published by Gernsback, but Amazing helped define and launch a new genre of pulp fiction.|$|E
5|$|Barlow was {{an early}} <b>experimenter</b> with civil {{engineering}} uses for steel, carrying out research at Woolwich Arsenal in the 1850s and {{being a member of}} the Institution of Civil Engineers' committee on the subject. From 1873 he was a member of a Board of Trade committee which produced the first recommendations on safe working loads for steel in railway structures in 1877.|$|E
40|$|The general pourpose of {{the present}} {{investigation}} was to study the expectancy effect on <b>Experimenter's</b> behavior proposed by Rosenthal, R. (1964) {{as well as the}} effect of Subject's role on the interpersonal non-intentional communication of the two. 1. Procedure: 18 female undergraduate <b>experimenters</b> employing a Taffel-type task conducted a verbal conditioning experiment with 87 male undergraduate subjects. For half the <b>experimenters,</b> the instructions claimed that their subjects had such personality characteristics that they would be easily conditioned. The rest of the <b>experimenters</b> were not especially given such instructions. In addition, the subjects in each group were divided into two subgroups-apprehensive subjects and un-apprehensive subjects. Therefore, a 2 × 2 matrix was adopted in this study. 2. Results: Expectancy effect on <b>Experimenter's</b> behavior showed as differentiated voice expresseions (like speaking fast or vividly). Meanwhile, the awareness of subjects under non-expectancy condtion was enhanced. Apprehensive subjects caused <b>experimenters</b> to behave positively toward them (like nodding, smiling) and regarded <b>experimenters</b> favorably. At the same time they were evaluated favorably by their <b>experimenters.</b> How preferably the <b>experimenters</b> evaluated un-apprehensive subjects negatively correlated with the magunitude of verbal condtioning under expectancy condition, while under non-expectancy condition positive correlation between them was found. These findings could be explained by "Congruency Model" reported by Smith F. J. & Luginbuhl, E. R. (1976). However, this model was not necessarily sufficient for the complete explanation as apprehensive subjects got less feedback from <b>experimenters...</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{a double}} blind taste test, the <b>experimenters</b> {{know nothing about}} the {{participants}}, and the participants know nothing about the <b>experimenters</b> or the product they are testing.|$|R
50|$|In one group, ("Group A"), <b>experimenters</b> {{were told}} to expect {{positive}} ratings while in another group, ("Group B"), <b>experimenters</b> {{were told to}} expect negative ratings. Data collected from Group A was a significant and substantially more optimistic appraisal than the data collected from Group B. The researchers suggested that <b>experimenters</b> gave subtle but clear cues with which the subjects complied.|$|R
5|$|With John Hawkshaw, he {{completed}} Isambard Kingdom Brunel's Clifton Suspension Bridge. Following the Tay Bridge disaster {{he sat on}} the commission which investigated the causes and designed the replacement Tay Bridge. Barlow was also an inventor and <b>experimenter,</b> patenting a design for a rail and carrying out investigations on the use and design of steel structures.|$|E
5|$|Chimpanzees {{are capable}} of {{actively}} locating objects that {{are the focus of}} another individual's attention by tracking the gaze of others. They are not limited to following eye gaze to the first interesting object in their view. They use a number of different cues to engage in shared focus, including head movement and eye gaze. Infant chimpanzees start to follow tap, point, and head turn cues of an <b>experimenter</b> by nine months of age. By 13 months of age, they show following responses to glance cues without a head turn. There is no evidence to support that infant chimpanzees are able to use eye gaze alone as a cue for following responses. By 20 months of age, infant chimpanzees are able to follow an experimenter's cues to a target behind the chimpanzee but infant chimpanzees do not look back to the <b>experimenter</b> after looking at the target. Moving targets are more salient than stationary targets for infant chimpanzees. Chimpanzee infants are sensitive to faces which are gazing at them, but chimpanzees less than three to four years old only look within their visual field when using the experimenter's head turn as their cue.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, the Baron {{appeared}} as a character in John Kendrick Bangs's comic novels A House-Boat on the Styx, Pursuit of the House-Boat, and The Enchanted Type-Writer. Shortly after, in 1901, Bangs published Mr. Munchausen, a collection of new Munchausen stories, closely following the style and humor of the original tales. Hugo Gernsback's second novel, Baron Münchhausen's New Scientific Adventures, put the Baron character in a science fiction setting; the novel was serialized in The Electrical <b>Experimenter</b> from May 1915 to February 1917.|$|E
50|$|A {{major problem}} in studies is <b>experimenter's</b> bias. Research into studies of media bias in the United States shows that liberal <b>experimenters</b> tend to get results that say the media has a {{conservative}} bias, while conservatives <b>experimenters</b> tend to get results that say the media has a liberal bias, {{and those who do}} not identify themselves as either liberal or conservative get results indicating little bias, or mixed bias.|$|R
50|$|The {{technique}} of using optogenetics is flexible and adaptable to the <b>experimenter's</b> needs. For starters, <b>experimenters</b> genetically engineer a microbial opsin {{based on the}} gating properties (rate of excitability, refractory period,etc..) required for the experiment.|$|R
50|$|In {{a single}} blind test, <b>experimenters</b> know {{information}} about the participants, but the participants know nothing about the <b>experimenters</b> or the product they are testing. The aforementioned Pepsi Challenge {{is an example of}} a single blind test.|$|R
5|$|Maxwell also {{investigated}} the kinetic theory of gases. Originating with Daniel Bernoulli, this theory was advanced by the successive labours of John Herapath, John James Waterston, James Joule, and particularly Rudolf Clausius, {{to such an}} extent as to put its general accuracy beyond a doubt; but it received enormous development from Maxwell, who in this field appeared as an <b>experimenter</b> (on the laws of gaseous friction) as well as a mathematician.|$|E
5|$|The artist {{held her}} first solo show in Tunis in 2009, and {{subsequent}} solo shows in Berlin (2010), the Mosaic Rooms of Earl's Court (London, 2014), and the Dallas Contemporary (2015). Kaabi-Linke received the 2009 Alexandria Biennale's Jury Prize and the 2011 Abraaj Group Art Prize. The latter commissioned her 2011 Flying Carpets, which was {{shown at the}} 54th Venice Biennale and later purchased by and exhibited at the New York Guggenheim Museum in 2016. Kaabi-Linke held a residency at the London Delfina Foundation in 2012, where she was inspired after meeting survivors of domestic violence. She won the Discoveries Prize for emerging art at the 2014 Art Basel Hong Kong, where she exhibited with the Kolkatan <b>Experimenter</b> gallery. One of the judges juxtaposed the social content of her work against the political reservations of other exhibitions in the show. Earlier that year, she completed her Meinstein ("My Stone") project {{in the center of}} Neukölln, a borough of Berlin. Her pavement mosaic uses stones that correspond to the national origins of the borough's residents, which is a largely immigrant population. She described her practice, at that time, as an archaeology of contemporary life. As of 2016, Kaabi-Linke is represented by Lawrie Shabibi of Dubai and <b>Experimenter</b> of Kolkata.|$|E
5|$|The {{editorial}} work was largely done by Sloane, but Gernsback retained final say over the fiction content. Two consultants, Conrad A. Brandt and Wilbur C. Whitehead, were hired {{to help find}} fiction to reprint. Frank R. Paul, {{who had worked with}} Gernsback as early as 1914, became the cover artist; Paul had produced many illustrations for the fiction in The Electrical <b>Experimenter.</b> Amazing was issued in the large bedsheet format, 8.5 × 11.75 in (216 × 298mm), {{the same size as the}} technical magazines. It was an immediate success and by the following March reached a circulation of 150,000.|$|E
50|$|Where Cartesian-Newtonian science accepts only a single, {{practical}} syllogism about <b>experimenters</b> {{and research}} topics, Goethe stood for and demonstrated {{the practice of}} science as an art, an artistic practice directed towards refining the <b>experimenter's</b> perceptions over time towards Imagination, Inspiration and Intuition.|$|R
40|$|Banning {{deception}} {{in economic}} experiments does not exclude experiments with {{participants in the}} role of <b>experimenters</b> who can gain by deceiving those {{in the role of}} participants. We compare treatments with and without possible deception by experimenter-participants to test whether deception aects behaviour of participant-participants in a dictator experiment and whether participants in the role of <b>experimenters</b> engage in deception. We find no dierence in behaviour of participant-participants between the treatments whereas most participants in the role of <b>experimenters</b> engage in deception...|$|R
50|$|It {{refers to}} a {{tendency}} to under-report unexpected or undesirable experimental results, while being more trusting of expected or desirable results. This can propagate, as each instance reinforces the status quo, and later <b>experimenters</b> justify their own reporting bias by observing that previous <b>experimenters</b> reported different results.|$|R
5|$|Wonder Stories was {{an early}} American science fiction {{magazine}} which was published under several titles from 1929 to 1955. It was founded by Hugo Gernsback in 1929 after he had lost control of his first science fiction magazine, Amazing Stories, when his media company <b>Experimenter</b> Publishing went bankrupt. Within {{a few months of}} the bankruptcy, Gernsback launched three new magazines: Air Wonder Stories, Science Wonder Stories and Science Wonder Quarterly.|$|E
5|$|Gernsback {{was slow}} to pay his authors and creditors; {{the extent of his}} {{investments}} limited his liquidity. On 20 February 1929 his printer and paper supplier opened bankruptcy proceedings against him. It has been suggested that Bernarr Macfadden, another magazine publisher, maneuvered to force the bankruptcy because Gernsback would not sell his titles to Macfadden, but this is unproven. <b>Experimenter</b> Publishing did not file any defence and was declared bankrupt by default on 6 March 1929; Amazing survived with its existing staff, but Hugo and his brother, Sidney, were forced out as directors. Arthur H. Lynch took over as editor-in-chief, though Sloane continued to have effective control of the magazine's contents. The receivers, Irving Trust, sold the magazine to Bergan A. Mackinnon on 3 April 1929.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} {{philosophy}} of science trace back to Plato and Aristotle who distinguished {{the forms of}} approximate and exact reasoning, set out the threefold scheme of abductive, deductive, and inductive inference, and also analyzed reasoning by analogy. The eleventh century Arab polymath Ibn al-Haytham (known in Latin as Alhazen) conducted his research in optics by way of controlled experimental testing and applied geometry, especially in his investigations into the images resulting from the reflection and refraction of light. Roger Bacon (1214–1294), an English thinker and <b>experimenter</b> heavily influenced by al-Haytham, is recognized {{by many to be}} the father of modern scientific method. His view that mathematics was essential to a correct understanding of natural philosophy was considered to be 400 years ahead of its time.|$|E

50|$|Luchins gave an elementary-school class a set {{of water}} jar problems. In {{order to create a}} {{stressful}} situation, <b>experimenters</b> told the students that the test would be timed, that the speed and accuracy of the test would be reviewed by their principal and teachers, and that the test would affect their grades. To further agitate the students during the test, <b>experimenters</b> were instructed to comment on how much slower the children were compared to children in lower grades. The <b>experimenters</b> observed anxious, stressed, and sometimes tearful faces during the experiment.|$|R

25|$|In this condition, the <b>experimenter</b> {{gives the}} {{individual}} moderately preferred items and instructs {{them to go}} play. After that initial instruction, the <b>experimenter</b> pretends to act busy and ignores all bids for attention from the individual. If the individual engages {{in the behavior of}} interest, the <b>experimenter</b> provides the individual with attention (commonly {{in the form of a}} reprimand). Behaviors that occur more frequently in this condition can be said to be attention maintained.|$|E
25|$|In {{the classic}} test, the <b>experimenter</b> first {{played with the}} children, making sure that they {{looked in the mirror}} at least three times. Then, the rouge test was {{performed}} using a dot of rouge below the child's right eye. For their modified testing, the <b>experimenter</b> introduced a doll with a rouge spot under its eye and asked the child to help clean the doll. The <b>experimenter</b> would ask up to three times before cleaning the doll themselves. The doll was then put away, and the mirror test performed using a rouge dot on the child's face. These modifications were shown {{to increase the number of}} self-recognisers.|$|E
25|$|A {{primary source}} has {{reported}} a functional neuroimaging experiment, where participants were scanned while they imitated an <b>experimenter</b> performing constructions with small objects {{and while the}} <b>experimenter,</b> while performing such a manipulation, imitated the participants. Across both conditions, the participants' sense of ownership (the sense that it is I who am experiencing the movement or thought) {{as well as the}} visual and somatosensory inputs were similar or coincided. What differed between imitating and being imitated was the agent who initiated the action. The primary source reports that several key regions were involved in the two conditions of reciprocal imitation compared to a control condition (in which subjects acted differently from the <b>experimenter),</b> namely in the superior temporal sulcus, the temporoparietal cortex (TPJ), and the medial prefrontal cortex.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>experimenters</b> {{violated}} this implicit rule {{by asking}} people {{to give up their}} seats. They then measured the responses as the number of times individuals consented or refused to give up their seats, and also noted people's verbal and physical reactions to the request. <b>Experimenters</b> approached individuals under three conditions: ...|$|R

25|$|In this condition, the <b>experimenter</b> instructs the {{individual}} {{that it is}} time to work. After the initial instruction, the <b>experimenter</b> delivers a series of demands that {{the individual}} is typically required to complete (e.g. math problems, cleaning up, etc.). If the individual engages in the behavior of interest, the demand is removed and the child is allowed to take a break. Behaviors that occur more frequently in this condition can be said to be escape maintained.|$|E
5000|$|Numerically, the KH {{instability}} is simulated in {{a temporal}} or a spatial approach. In the temporal approach, <b>experimenters</b> consider the flow in a periodic (cyclic) box [...] "moving" [...] at mean speed (absolute instability). In the spatial approach, <b>experimenters</b> simulate a lab experiment with natural inlet and outlet conditions (convective instability).|$|R
