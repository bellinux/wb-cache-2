The approach is based on modifying the peridynamic influence function according to the state of accumulated damage.

Commercial grades of hydrotalcites have been added to rigid PVC formulations, containing a range of different stabiliser types, to evaluate their contribution to heat stability and their effect on mechanical properties. Hydrotalcites are confirmed to be effective costabilisers for rigid PVC: static thermal stability (through oven testing) and dynamic thermal stability (via torque rheometry) of PVC compounds are modified by their presence. The extent of change is determined by the primary stabiliser type and the grade of the hydrotalcite.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Impaction of {{front teeth}} (often upper canines) {{can result in}} esthetic, functional, and phonetic problems, in {{addition}} to root resorption and chronic or acute infections. Most impacted front teeth can be extruded orthodontically after minor periodontal surgery. The purpose of this retrospective {{study was to examine}} the periodontal outcome of surgically exposed and orthodontically <b>extruded</b> <b>impacted</b> teeth compared with the spontaneously erupted contralateral teeth. METHODS: A total of 38 patients, who had been treated by a combined surgical and orthodontic approach (closed eruption technique by same periodontist and 2 associated orthodontists), underwent a periodontal re-examination after 4 to 10 years. Periodontal parameters (plaque and gingivitis indices, probing depth, bleeding on probing, gingival recession and width, bone level, and root resorption) of the orthodontically extruded teeth (test) were scored and compared with those of the contralateral naturally erupted teeth (control) in a masked set-up. RESULTS: No significant differences could be detected between test and control teeth, except for the gingival width, which was 1 mm larger for the spontaneously erupted teeth. CONCLUSIONS: The data indicate that orthodontic extrusion of impacted front teeth does not jeopardize their periodontal health. This procedure appears to be a satisfactory alternative to extraction and/or transplantation. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the <b>impact</b> of an <b>extruded</b> muesli product based on -glucan-rich oat bran on postprandial glycaemia and insulinaemia. Subject/Design: The study is divided in two series. Blood glucose and serum insulin responses were studied after subjects consuming test meals including {{a serving of}} muesli with 3 g (series 1) and 4 g (series 2) of -glucans, respectively. The muesli was a component in a single serving packet with muesli and yoghurt. This was served together with white wheat bread in the morning after an overnight fast. The compositions were standardized to contain 50 g available carbohydrates. As a reference meal a serving packet without -glucans was included. The study was performed at Applied Nutrition and Food Chemistry, Lund University, Sweden. Nineteen and thirteen healthy volunteers with normal body mass index were recruited for series 1 and 2, respectively. Results: Muesli with 3 g of -glucans, included in a mixed bread meal, gave {{no significant differences in}} glycaemic response compared to a reference meal without muesli and -glucans. In contrast, muesli with 4 g of -glucans significantly (P< 0. 05) lowered the glucose and insulin responses compared to the reference meal. Conclusions: Muesli enriched with 4 g of -glucans reduces postprandial glucose and insulin levels to a breakfast based on high glycaemic index products. A total of 4 g of beta-glucans from oats seems to be a critical level for a significant decrease in glucose and insulin responses in healthy people...|$|R

Dietary linseeds significantly increased proportions of 18 : 3 n- 3 (+ 56 and + 36 % respectively), total trans 18 : 1 (+ 66 and + 105 %); and of 9 cis, 11 trans 18 : 2 (CLA) (+ 50 and + 41 %) in LT muscle of which 18 : 3 n- 3 and CLA are known to be beneficial for the human health. Addition of antioxidants (vitamin E plus plant extracts rich in polyphenols, PERP) reinforced the stimulating effect of lipid supplements on proportions of the three considered FA (18 : 3 n- 3, total trans 18 : 1, 9 cis, 11 trans 18 : 2) in total lipids of both muscles. Dietary n- 3 PUFA reduced the resistance capacity of plasma against lipoperoxidation (– 11 %) favouring peroxidized products formations such as conjugated dienes (× 1. 75) and malonedialdehyde (MDA, × 2). Intensity of beef lipoperoxidation (estimated by MDA level) tended to be higher in meats packaged under modified atmosphere rich in oxygen (70 %) in the linseed group (2. 96 μg/g of tissue) compared to that of the control group (2. 19 μg/g of tissue, P = 0. 1). Dietary vitamin E provided with PERP effectively protected beef against lipoperoxidation, even in beef packagings with O 2. Beef under air packaging from cows given the linseed supplement had a higher redness value than that from control cows. In the case of animals given lipid supplemented diets and submitted to an emotional stress, beef packaged under air or modified atmosphere rich in O 2 had a lower redness than that of the same animals given lipids associated to antioxidant supplements. We concluded that the dietary strategy combining addition of n- 3 PUFA and of the antioxidant mixture in diets would avoid major risks of lipoperoxidation and alteration of colour in beef products whatever: 1) the conditions of meat ageing and packaging (especially those with contact with oxygen); 2) the degree of emotional stress of animals just prior slaughter...|$|R
40|$|While Europe {{is slowly}} {{emerging}} from a devastating financial crisis, in Greece the ordeal {{is far from being}} over. Every-day life is frustrating and tough, and the economic figures do not capture the hardship of the austerity-hit economy. In amidst the challenging realities of poverty, unemployment, indebtedness, markets’ stagnation and austerity measures children’s lives are suffering tremendous and deep impacts. The government programs in education, health, and child protection were amongst the first to be cut due to budget constraints. Furthermore, the financial crisis is intensifying the effects of the increasing cost of the daily life, seriously challenging the abilities of families to cope and of children to thrive. This study aimed to explore children’s experiences and perspectives of poverty in the urban area of Athens, the capital of Greece. Fourteen children, whose one or both parents have lost their jobs, participated and they helped me generate rich and valuable data. Parents, teachers and social workers were also interviewed and contributed with their knowledge to a more diverse and broad understanding of child and familial poverty. The major theoretical perspectives on which this study was based are the Structural perspective of the new Social Studies of Childhood, political economy as well as discourses on agency, resilience, neoliberalism, poverty and social reproduction. This theoretical background constituted an excellent base to build my study upon, pointing out that children are deeply affected by political, economic and societal macro-parameters stemming from the financial crisis and neoliberalism practices. Children, although they are capable social actors, they cannot escape the macro-parametric <b>impacts</b> that <b>extrude</b> them and their families in poverty. Yet, poverty is multifaceted and goes beyond monetary aspects, therefore children’s perspectives are very illuminating. The children in this study are excellent political and economic commentators. Not only they realize that the financial crisis is part of a “global picture” but they also link it with parental unemployment and the consequent economic problems they face in their households. Children exercise their agency in order to get by, to get out and, what I propose, to “get on with life” under poverty. They do not consider themselves poor. Instead, they use other expressions that indicate financial constriction. Children’s views on poverty go beyond material deprivation and they include lack of quality-time spent with the parents, inability of going on vacations or on family nights-out, self-exclusion practices and constrains on their dreams for the future. Another aspect of poverty that emerged from the narratives of children is the “parent poverty” which {{has to do with the}} physical and emotional absence of the parent. Children endure a harsh, everyday reality and they do so in silence in order not to over-burden their parents. Disrupted social reproduction has led them in shouldering more domestic and caretaking responsibilities. Since there are not many similar studies done in Greece, I consider it very important to let the children’s voices to be heard and illuminate their realitie...|$|R
