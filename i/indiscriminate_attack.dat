2500|$|According to Grist, it was Georgia that {{launched}} the first military strikes against Tskhinvali. [...] "It {{was clear to}} me that the [...] attack was completely indiscriminate and disproportionate to any, if indeed there had been any, provocation,” he said. “The attack was clearly, in my mind, an <b>indiscriminate</b> <b>attack</b> on the town, as a town.” Grist's views were echoed by Stephen Young, who was another senior OSCE official in Georgia at the time. According to him, there had been no extensive shelling of the Georgian villages on the evening or night of August 7. Young added, that if there had been shelling of Georgian villages that evening, the OSCE monitors at the scene would have heard it. According to him, the monitors only heard occasional small arms fire.|$|E

60|$|In 1838 {{appeared}} Homeward Bound and Home as Found, two satirical novels, {{in which}} Cooper {{held up to}} ridicule a certain class of conductors of the newspaper press in America. These works had not {{the good fortune to}} become popular. Cooper did not, and, because he was too deeply in earnest, perhaps would not, infuse into his satirical works that gaiety without which satire becomes wearisome. I believe, however, that if they had been written by anybody else they would have met with more favor; but the world knew that Cooper was able to give them something better, and would not be satisfied with anything short of his best, Some childishly imagined that because, in the two works I have just mentioned, a newspaper editor is introduced, in whose character almost every possible vice of his profession is made to find a place, Cooper intended an <b>indiscriminate</b> <b>attack</b> upon the whole body of writers for the newspaper press, forgetting that such a portraiture was a satire only on those to whom it bore a likeness We have become less sensitive and more reasonable of late, and the monthly periodicals make sport for their readers of the follies and ignorance of the newspaper editors, without awakening the slightest resentment; but Cooper led the way in this sort of discipline, and I remember some instances of towering indignation at his audacity expressed in the journals of that time.|$|E
5000|$|Articles 51 and 54 outlaw <b>indiscriminate</b> <b>attacks</b> on {{civilian}} populations, {{and destruction}} of food, water, and other materials needed for survival. <b>Indiscriminate</b> <b>attacks</b> include directly attacking civilian (non-military) targets, but also using technology such as biological weapons, nuclear weapons and land mines, whose scope of destruction cannot be limited. A total war that does not distinguish between civilian and military targets is considered a war crime.|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. This thesis {{examines}} {{the prohibition of}} <b>indiscriminate</b> <b>attacks</b> in non-international armed conflicts. The world has seen {{an increase in the}} number of armed conflicts that are not of an international character. Most of these conflicts have proven to be very destructive and detrimental to persons not taking part in the hostilities. Having in mind the fact that International Humanitarian Law seeks to protect persons not taking part in armed conflicts, this thesis is an appraisal of whether International Humanitarian Law prohibits <b>indiscriminate</b> <b>attacks</b> in non-international armed conflicts...|$|R
5000|$|A {{report by}} the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights stated that [...] "Palestinian armed groups {{continuously}} violated international humanitarian law, by launching <b>indiscriminate</b> <b>attacks</b> on Israel and by attacking civilians". The report further stated, [...] "While some projectiles were directed at military objectives, many, if not {{the vast majority of}} the Palestinian attacks on Israel constituted <b>indiscriminate</b> <b>attacks.</b> Such attacks violate international humanitarian law. ... Most rockets fired by the armed groups did not seem to be directed at a specific military objective. Furthermore, many Palestinian armed groups directly and indirectly indicated their determination to - and took responsibility for - attacks on Israeli civilians or large population centres in Israel. Such acts clearly violate international humanitarian law." ...|$|R

50|$|The UN {{investigation}} found the FARC {{in violation of}} several principles of international humanitarian law, including an <b>indiscriminate</b> <b>attack</b> causing unnecessary civilian casualties, failure to distinguish between civilian and combatant, failure to take efforts to protect civilians from avoidable harm, and attacks against cultural property. Prohibitions against these acts are found in Common Article 3 of the 1949 Geneva Conventions and Articles 4, 13, and 16 of Additional Protocol II.

50|$|All three Scandinavian {{countries}} remained neutral {{throughout the}} First World War. The war {{did have a}} significant impact on the economy of the area, primarily as a result of the British blockade of Germany. However, they were able to work around that with trade agreement with Britain. Norway's large merchant marine delivered vital supplies to Britain but suffered huge losses in ships and sailors because of <b>indiscriminate</b> <b>attack</b> by the German navy. Denmark called up much of its military, but Germany still violated Danish sovereignty to some extent, for example by mining the Øresund.

In 1996, the Russian public, military and political elite were fed up and opted to withdraw Russian troops. Anyway, the destruction of Grozny in August 1996 was hardly a reasonable option: Thousands of MVD troops were trapped {{in the city and}} most likely would have perished together with the Chechens.

The evidence available concerning the nature, quality and quantity of the agents used on 21 August indicated that the perpetrators likely had access to the chemical weapons stockpile of the Syrian military, as well as the expertise and equipment necessary to safely manipulate large amount of chemical agents."

Many Protestants saw the bombing as an <b>indiscriminate</b> <b>attack</b> on them. Adair believed that the bomb was meant for him. Two days after the bombing, as Adair was driving away from his house, he stopped and told a police officer [...] "I'm away to plan a mass murder". In the week following the bombing, the UDA and UVF launched a wave of [...] "revenge attacks", killing 14 civilians. The UDA shot a Catholic delivery driver in Belfast after luring him to a bogus call just a few hours after the bombing. He died on 25 October. On 26 October, the UDA shot dead another two Catholic civilians and wounded five in an <b>indiscriminate</b> <b>attack</b> at a Council Depot on Kennedy Way, Belfast. On 30 October, UDA members entered a pub in Greysteel frequented by Catholics and again opened-fire indiscriminately. Eight civilians (six Catholics and two Protestants) were killed and 13 were wounded. This became known as the Greysteel massacre. The UDA claimed it was a direct retaliation for the Shankill Road bombing. Michael Stone and another UDA member said that Adair also vowed to launch simultaneous attacks on Catholics attending mass in Belfast. The day after the attack (Sunday), the security forces were sent to guard all Catholic churches in Belfast. A UDA member said that a carload of gunmen were sent to attack Holy Family Catholic Church on the Limestone Road, but called off the attack due to the high security. Adair denied the claims. The UVF shot dead a Catholic man in Newtownabbey and two Catholic brothers in Bleary.|$|E

50|$|The Hornet Bank {{massacre}} of eleven Europeans (including seven {{members of the}} Fraser family) was one of direct retaliation {{to the deaths of}} twelve Iman people by member(s) of the Fraser clan.

It unfortunately spurred a much greater third massacre (led by William Fraser).
