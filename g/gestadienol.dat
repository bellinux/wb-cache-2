It has no androgenic or estrogenic effects. The effects of <b>gestadienol</b> acetate on the endometrium and its general pharmacology were studied in a clinical trial in women. It has also been studied in a clinical trial for benign prostatic hyperplasia in men, but {{was found to be}} ineffective. <b>Gestadienol</b> acetate is the C17α acetate ester of <b>gestadienol.</b>|$|E

It is specifically a combined derivative of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone and 19-norprogesterone, or of gestronol (17α-hydroxy-19-norprogesterone), with an acetate ester at the C17α position and a double bond between the C6 and C7 positions.
