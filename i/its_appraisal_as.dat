40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to create a scale that could measure compartmentalization. In the first of two studies 311 working {{undergraduates}} were asked to indicate agreement with 119 items that measured compartmentalization. The resulting scale 2 ̆ 7 s reliability and validity were evaluated by having a second sample of 312 working students complete the items that comprise a sphere overlap scale, two measures of spillover, and a measure of personality, coping, and demoralization. Although the study 2 ̆ 7 s original goal was not realized, its procedures were successful in developing a short (10 -item) measure of work-to-home spillover whose items loaded on a single factor. Structural equation modeling indicated that SOS items were correlated with existing measures of spillover and could be discriminated from related concepts of personality and coping. The SOS was also more highly correlated with demoralization than existing measures of spillover in hierarchical analyses that controlled for demographic factors, personality characteristics, and coping style. It is concluded that the SOS shows enough promise to warrant the cost of <b>its</b> <b>appraisal</b> <b>as</b> an alternative measure of spillover in a longitudinal study...|$|E

40|$|The {{government}} agency at {{the centre of}} the study is concerned with public welfare. Its appraisal system is based on a “performance management system”, the purpose being to ensure that employees work in the most effective way possible to deliver the agency’s business. Individuals are assessed on how well they have met the behaviour characteristics for selected competencies. A survey of middle management shows that whilst the agency attempts to use <b>its</b> <b>appraisal</b> system <b>as</b> part of a performance management system, the model is to some extent faulted. All the elements of the system are present but they do not necessarily link together as intended. The role of appraisal and the cultural expectation of appraisal are well managed by the performance management system, although the link to competence is weakened by the difficulties middle managers have in relating competence to training and performance. The link to change and learning is shown to be single loop and change that is effected tends to be of a minor nature...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{identify}} and account for individual differences in the contextual experience of anger and <b>its</b> <b>appraisals</b> and in the associations between both. Participants (N = 832) engaged in a directed imagery task of descriptions of unpleasant situations and reported on their appraisal and anger experience. Additionally, they filled out several dispositional questionnaires. The results demonstrated that at the basis of the experience of anger lies an externally induced disadvantage, which for many people elicits frustration. For some individuals, the latter is sufficient for becoming angered. Yet, for others, the thwarting has to be characterised by norm violation and has to be appraised as unfair and deliberate in order for them to experience anger. Individuals also differed as to whether threat to self-esteem was experienced along with frustration in situations that involved negative evaluative self-relevant information. Combined, the findings demonstrated that anger can occur in combination with different patterns of <b>appraisals,</b> varying <b>as</b> a function of situation and person characteristics. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{refers to}} the history of {{reception}} of emperor Louis the Pious in historiographic literature from Carolingian times up to the 13 th century. Louis’ contemporaries – like Thegan, Astronomus, Nithard and Ermoldus Nigellus – understand his reign as presence, which they try to influence. Political support or opposition is expressed by the omission or misrepresentation of facts. During the following generations, the reign of Louis the Pious is taken as a recent and still influential past and it is set in different relations to present reality. Here two characteristic approaches can be distinguished: the image of Louis’ reign as a "golden age" in the interpretation of Ado of Vienne or <b>its</b> negative <b>appraisal</b> <b>as</b> a "root of all evil" by Regino of Prüm. The third phase of reception then illustrates a radical break, due to the disintegration of the Carolingian Empire. Just in few regional references a reception of Louis the Pious can be traced. The subsequent fourth phase of reception which starts in the 11 th century again offers a broader variety of approaches. Analysis has to focus separately on the Empire and France. Parallel to the renaissance of literary type of World Chronicles the historic figure of Louis the Pious is directly employed within larger schemes in which Louis the Pious as individual person is covered by the figure of the Emperor. Abbreviations and concentration on few elements produce a schematization. Most significant changes and divergence can be observed in texts which polarize between pope and emperor which are abstractly seen as antagonist institutions. The reign of Louis the Pious becomes a historical exemplum. This tendency is even enhanced in the historiography of Staufer-epoch. The focus on these two poles of power brings about the creation of the type of Pope-Emperor-Chronicles. The most popular author of this category is Martin of Troppau. Without any historical concern the reign of Louis the Pious is used as material to be fitted into this dualistic scheme. In France a similar development can be observed, though the reception of emperor Louis is accompanied by more national implications. This is the case in the texts of Helinand of Froidmont and other authors. The Grandes Chroniques de France present the final stage of a specific French development. They are the origin of an absolutely new quality of reception: Louis the Pious is shown as the ideal emperor and king of France. This fifth phase of reception is specific for France and cannot be traced in the Empire. In Western reception Louis the Pious steps out of the shadow of Charlemagne, in the East he is not even seen in this respect...|$|R
