40|$|Ground based, {{wind energy}} {{extraction}} systems have reached their maximum capability. The limitations of current designs are wind instability and {{high cost of}} installations. The wind energy industry {{is in need of}} revolutionary ideas to increase the capabilities of wind systems. This article suggests a revolutionary innovation which produces a dramatic increase in power per unit at a lower cost per unit of energy extracted and is independent of prevailing weather. The main innovation consists of large free-flying air rotors positioned at high altitude for power and stable air stream, and two types (mechanical and electrical) of an <b>energy</b> <b>cable</b> transmission system between the air rotor and a ground system. The air rotor system flies at high altitude up to 10 km. Stability and control systems is provided which also enable changing altitude. This article includes the theory of airborne wind systems and provides the analysis of four examples having a high unit power output (up to 50 MW). The proposed examples provide the following main advantages: 1) Large power production capacity per unit- up to ten- hundred times more than conventional ground-based small rotor designs; 2) The rotor operates at high altitude of 0. 5 - 10 km where the wind flow is strong and steady; 3) Installation cost per unit energy is low and 4) The installation is environmentally friendly (no propeller noise).

40|$|Reliable {{cable systems}} are {{essential}} for offshore wind operation. Industry trends {{have led to a}} large number of offshore cable connections being installed recently, with 11027 MW of offshore wind connected at the end of 2015 compared to just 2955 MW in 2010 [1]. Despite the increase in connections, the publically available reliability data in this area is almost non-existent. With several connections in planning of both similar and increasing lengths it is essential to better understand these metrics. A review of published reliability data was undertaken in order to populate a database which is presented in this paper. This data focusses on a number of connection types including both AC and DC connections across a number of cable ratings and configurations. From this database it is confirmed that reliability figures currently being used across the literature generally conform to those currently being experienced in the offshore wind industry. However it is established that failure rates taken from some reports are not accurate as the technology and environments these are calculated from are typically different from those used in offshore wind farm connections. This information is collated and converted into reliability metrics in order for comparisons to be made. Analysis of the cost of an outage experienced by a windfarm is also carried out in this paper. The results of which establish that the revenue lost from a cable failure could potentially be substantial. The findings in this paper would also suggest a greater risk of failure in the early life of a windfarm and as such a greater potential cost associated with this risk. It is important to {{have a better understanding of}} offshore renewable <b>energy</b> <b>cable</b> connections as the reliability of a cable has a significant impact on the Levelised Cost of Energy. With a greater understanding of the metrics investors can make more informed decisions with respect to the technology that is installed as well as the importance of the installation process itself, due diligence on subsequent OFTO asset purchases and the maintenance plans that have been outlined for the connection...|$|E

The space charge density has been determined by measurements performed on plane samples of polyethylene by using the Thermal Step Method. The repartition of the space charge in the water treed regions has been estimated from FTIR analysis on the repartition of the ions associated to water trees. The results show that the presence of water trees and of space charge determines an important increase of the electric field strength near to the semiconductor layers, which facilitate the inception of electrical trees in insulations and consequently the breakdown at lower voltage...|$|R

40|$|In general, in NMR {{spectroscopy}} {{a sample}} {{is prepared for}} the NMR measurement, positioned in the magnet, measured, and discarded. But when non-destructiveness of the sample is more important, it becomes important to rely on relaxation analysis at low resolution NMR. If the samples are big in size the unilateral or single-sided NMR in inhomogeneous fields is an important choice. Unilateral NMR or inside-out NMR is one recognized technique {{in the field of}} low resolution NMR. The NMR-MOUSE (Mobile Universal Surface Explorer) belongs to this single-sided NMR concept. It is a palm-size NMR device which is built from two permanent magnets. They are mounted on an iron yoke with anti-parallel polarization. The main direction of the polarization field B 0 is across the gap. The rf field B 1 is generated by a surface coil which is mounted in the gap. Together with the equation of motion for the nuclear magnetization the profiles of the B 0 and B 1 fields define the sensitive volume in which the NMR conditions are satisfied. The sensitive volume is restricted to regions near the surface of the examined object. A particularly interesting development in this context is the use of NMR for process and quality control. It implies the lack of invasive sample preparation. Applications of low-resolution NMR are in the food industry, the paper and pulp industry, and in the analysis of building materials and polymer materials. Following research areas has been covered in the Ph. D. thesis: (a) Investigation of Silicone and synthetic rubber samples: Different NMR-MOUSEs have been used for the analysis of industrial and institute made rubber samples (multi-layered PDMS cable shells and cured natural rubber samples). High <b>energy</b> <b>cable</b> shells made of silicone rubber (aged and stretched at different temperature) were investigated successfully with relaxometric analysis with Hahn, CPMG and MQ pulse sequences. Besides the detection of voids in the sample, agglomerates have also been discovered with the NMR imaging technique in silicone as well as natural rubber. The results obtained with the NMR imaging experiments confirm the results obtained with NMR-MOUSE. (b) Investigation of porous building materials: Different NMR-MOUSEs have been used to characterize the size distribution of water filled pores in building materials with the CPMG pulse sequence even in the case of ferromagnetic contaminations. The main idea was to investigate the state of historical building materials which can be subjected to chemical treatment with stone strengtheners for preservation. The shapes and the positions of the relaxation time distributions {{are similar to those of}} the pore size distributions obtained by mercury intrusion porosimetry unless the samples exhibit very strong ferromagnetic contaminations (historical brick samples). (c) Degradation of historical papers: In the present work historical books from the 17 th century were subjected to the non-destructive relaxometric analysis with the NMR-MOUSE using the Hahn echo pulse sequence. The distribution of relaxation times obtained from inverse Laplace transformation of the Hahn echo envelope data of differently degraded paper samples clearly discriminate the paper types investigated...|$|E

Also there was noticed that VSC type converters have better working principles regarding polymeric cables, but space charge trapping on insulation layer still deeply impacts values of electric field in insulation layer on steady or changing working regimes. In order to analyze main aspects of high voltage direct current cables working modes there was created a high voltage direct cable and converter station system model in MATLAB environment using parameters from NordBalt link. 12 main working modes form literature sources were simulated. Working modes consisted of: <b>cable</b> energization with <b>energy</b> transmission, polarity reversal with <b>energy</b> transmission, <b>cable</b> energization without <b>energy</b> transmission, energy transmission turn-on after cable energization, <b>cable</b> energization with <b>energy</b> transmission with 100 % greater current, <b>cable</b> energization with <b>energy</b> transmission with 50 % higher voltage, fast <b>cable</b> energization with <b>energy</b> transmission, <b>cable</b> energization with <b>energy</b> transmission when cooling properties of cable are worsen, positive polarity overvoltage peak on <b>cable</b> energization with <b>energy</b> transmission working mode, negative polarity overvoltage peak on <b>cable</b> energization with <b>energy</b> transmission working mode, negative pole energization with <b>energy</b> transmission, warm <b>cable</b> energization with <b>energy</b> transmission.
