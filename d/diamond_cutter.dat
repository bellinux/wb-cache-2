25|$|Retail {{engravers}} mainly use {{two different}} processes. The {{first and most}} common 'Diamond Drag' pushes the <b>diamond</b> <b>cutter</b> through {{the surface of the}} material and then pulls to create scratches. These direction and depth are controlled by the computer input. The second is 'Spindle Cutter'. This is similar to Diamond Drag, but the engraving head is shaped in a flat V shape, with a small diamond and the base. The machine uses an electronic spindle to quickly rotate the head as it pushes it into the material, then pulls it along whilst it continues to spin. This creates a much bolder impression than diamond drag. It is used mainly for brass plaques and pet tags.|$|E
50|$|The square princess cut diamond {{is usually}} {{slightly}} cheaper than round brilliant cut diamonds {{of the same}} carat weight because it retains about 80% of the rough diamond, {{as opposed to the}} round brilliant which retains only about 50% of the rough.

25|$|In 2002, Zbyszko {{had a short}} {{feud with}} Chris Harris in the Nashville, Tennessee-based USA Championship Wrestling promotion.

On August 27, 2005 at WrestleReunion in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, Zbyszko faced Diamond Dallas Page, {{with the provision that}} he would receive five minutes alone in the ring with the sixty-nine-year-old Bruno Sammartino if he won. Page knocked Zbyszko out with his signature <b>Diamond</b> <b>Cutter,</b> however, then pulled Zbyszko on top of him, thus giving him the win by pinfall. Sammartino then entered the ring and began throttling the still-prone Zbyszko until he was dragged away.|$|E
25|$|During {{the diamond}} cutting process, the <b>diamond</b> <b>cutter</b> {{wants to get}} the {{heaviest}} diamond out of a rough stone. However, this can come {{at the cost of}} lowering cut grade. If a diamond is too deep, the carat weight will increase but result in a loss of brilliance due to light leakage. Diamond cutters have to contend with working a stone to its best finished form with the least amount of waste. This strategy depends {{on the quality of the}} stone and its final proportions. If two diamonds of equal weight are inspected there can be a noticeable difference in size when viewed from above; arguably the most important view. A well cut 0.90ct diamond for example could have the same width as a poorly cut 1.00ct diamond. This phenomenon is known as spread.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the first}} mixed cuts was the Barion cut, {{introduced}} in 1971. Invented by South African <b>diamond</b> <b>cutter</b> Basil Watermeyer and named after {{himself and his}} wife Marion, the basic Barion cut is an octagonal square or rectangle, with a polished and faceted girdle. The total facet count is 62 (excluding the culet): 25 on the crown; 29 on the pavilion; and 8 on the girdle. This cut can be easily identified by the characteristic central cross pattern (as seen through the table) created by the pavilion facets, {{as well as by}} the crescent-shaped facets on the pavilion. A similar cut is the Radiant cut: It differs in having a total of 70 facets. Both it and the Barion cut exist in a large number of modified forms, with slightly different facet arrangements and combinations.|$|E

50|$|Originally, all tool bits {{were made}} of high carbon tool steels with the {{appropriate}} hardening and tempering. Since the introductions of high-speed steel (HSS) (early years of the 20th century), sintered carbide (1930s), ceramic and <b>diamond</b> <b>cutters,</b> those materials have gradually replaced the earlier kinds of tool steel in almost all cutting applications. Most tool bits today are made of HSS, cobalt steel, or carbide.|$|R
50|$|Rhodes and Barney {{planned to}} reduce the number of buyers for the rough {{diamonds}} to ten companies who would in turn sell to the <b>diamond</b> <b>cutters</b> and set up lines of distribution throughout the World. De Beers Consolidated duly carried out this plan and the ten companies became known as the syndicate. The syndicate included Barnato Brothers in London. Only these ten companies could buy production from De Beers Consolidated Mines.|$|R
25|$|Badd {{competed in}} the mid-card {{throughout}} 1995, until he defeated Brian Pillman to become the #1 contender for the United States Heavyweight Championship at Fall Brawl. Badd received his title shot on the September 30 episode of Saturday Night against Sting, but failed to appear {{as he had been}} attacked by the Television Champion Diamond Dallas Page. Badd faced and defeated Page to win his second World Television Championship at Halloween Havoc. Badd defended the title against Page at the inaugural World War 3 pay-per-view, with the stipulation that if Badd won, he would gain Page's Diamond Doll as his valet. Badd defeated Page to retain the title and won the services of Kimberly, but he freed her. She continued to be in Badd's corner and the rivalry with Page continued. Badd defeated Page to retain the title at SuperBrawl VI in 1996. Badd lost the World Television Championship to Lex Luger during a house show on February 17, but defeated Luger to regain the title on February 18. He lost the title to Luger again on the March 9 episode of Saturday Night, after Page delivered a <b>Diamond</b> <b>Cutter</b> to Badd. This was Badd's final appearance in WCW. He left the company because he strongly objected to the ongoing angle with Kimberly Page.|$|E

50|$|The Wittelsbach-Graff Diamond is a 31.06 carat g deep-blue diamond with {{internally}} flawless clarity. Laurence Graff {{purchased the}} Wittelsbach Diamond in 2008 for £16.4 million. In 2010, Graff revealed {{he had had}} the diamond cut by three <b>diamond</b> <b>cutters</b> to remove flaws. The diamond was now more than 4 carat mg lighter and was renamed the Wittelsbach-Graff Diamond. There is controversy, as critics claim the recutting has so altered the diamond as to make it unrecognisable, compromising its historical integrity.|$|R
50|$|With {{the opening}} of the Nahe Valley Railway (Bingen-Saarbrücken) in 1860 - single-tracked until 1882 - came {{transport}} links for the first time between the Nahe Valley and both the Frankfurt Rhine Main Region and the Saarland. In 1880, Sonnenberg station came into service, whereupon many Frauenbergers found work in Idar-Oberstein, the Saarland and the Frankfurt Rhine Main Region. This also brought about population growth: by 1910 there were 51 families. After the First World War, electricity came to Frauenberg, allowing many agate, gem and <b>diamond</b> <b>cutters</b> to set up their workshops at home.|$|R

My advice to you is, either sell them directly you get them into your hands, or go straight to Amsterdam and sell them there {{to one of the}} <b>diamond</b> <b>cutters,</b> who will turn them out so that they will be altered beyond all recognition. Don't sell more than two stones at most to any one man; then they will never come out as a bracelet again, and the hunt will be over." ...|$|R
