The film, based on a [...] "Kevin Grisham novel" [...] (John Grisham's brother), {{revolves}} around a Southern–born lawyer named Constance Justice. Jenna wants Liz to give her an honest opinion of the film, as she is nervous about <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> received by the public. Liz sees the film in private, and her reaction is very negative, but she hesitates to tell Jenna the truth. When Jenna finds out that Liz hated the film, the two start fighting and accusing each other of not being truthful. Meanwhile, ignoring Liz's warnings, Josh Girard (Lonny Ross) manages to break into Liz's office to steal the film, which he watches {{with the rest of}} the TGS with Tracy Jordan writing staff. Much to Liz's shock, the staff say they liked the film. As the argument between Liz and Jenna escalates, Jack intervenes and persuades them to work things out. Liz admits that she was jealous of Jenna's success and Jenna remembers that the diet pills she was taking would lead to mood swings, and they forgive one another.|$|E

2500|$|Both leaders, Massoud and Haq, were {{recognized}} for being fiercely independent from foreign, especially Pakistani, influence. Both, {{two of the}} most successful anti-Soviet resistance leaders, were rejecting the Pakistani claim of hegemony over the Afghan mujahideen. Abdul Haq was quoted as saying during the anti-Soviet period: [...] "How is that we Afghans, who never lost a war, must take military instructions from the Pakistanis, who never won one?" [...] Massoud during the Soviet period said to the Pakistani Foreign Minister who had asked him {{to send a message to}} the Russians through the Pakistanis who were conducting talks [...] "on behalf of our Afghan brethren": [...] "Why should I send a message? Why are you talking on our behalf? Don't we have leaders here to talk on our behalf?" [...] Khan replied [...] "This is how it has been and <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be.</b> Do you have a message?" [...] Massoud told the foreign minister that [...] "nobody who talks on our behalf will have any kind of result." [...] Consequently, neither Massoud nor Abdul Haq were consulted before and neither participated in the Battle of Jalalabad (1989) in which the ISI tried but failed to install Gulbuddin Hekmatyar as the post-communist leader of Afghanistan.|$|E
