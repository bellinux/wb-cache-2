40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to extend the {{literature}} on earnings management by examining whether stock dividends provide management with an incentive to manipulate earnings. Design/methodology/approach – This paper employs a refined accrual model that controls the performance effects in estimating the part of accruals subject to managerial discretion. Findings – Stock dividend issuing firms increase accruals substantially in the <b>issue</b> <b>year</b> followed by poor earnings and stock price performance in the subsequent year. More importantly, discretionary accruals of stock dividend issuing firms are negatively correlated with the declines in both future earnings and abnormal stock returns. Originality/value – This paper examines the hypothesis that stock dividend firms engage in earnings management. Dividends, Earnings, Financial management, New Zealand, Stocks...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the evidence of}} earnings management around seasoned equity issues. The opportunistic earnings management hypothesis suggests an increase in net income and discretionary accruals before issues, a decrease in R&D expenses before issues, and a negative relation between pre-issue discretionary accruals and post-issue stock performance. Our results are inconsistent with these predictions. Instead, we find support for managerial optimism and earnings smoothing hypotheses. Consistent with managerial optimism, net income, discretionary accruals, and R&D expenses peak during the <b>issue</b> <b>year.</b> Furthermore, we find a positive relation between managerial optimism measures and issue-year discretionary accruals. Consistent with earnings smoothing, we find that reported earnings of issuing firms are smoother than their pre-managed earnings and discretionary accruals are positively related to future changes in operating cash flows...|$|E
40|$|The {{integration}} of bibliographical information of scholarly publications {{available on the}} Internet is an important task in academic research. Accurate reference metadata extraction for scholarly publications {{is essential for the}} {{integration of}} information from heterogeneous reference sources. In this paper, we propose a knowledge-based approach to literature mining and focus on reference metadata extraction methods for scholarly publications. We adopt an ontological knowledge representation framework called INFOMAP to automatically extract the reference metadata. The experimental results show that, by using INFOMAP, we can extract author, title, journal, volume, number (<b>issue),</b> <b>year,</b> and page information from different reference styles {{with a high degree of}} accuracy. The overall average field accuracy of citation extraction for a Bioinformatics dataset is 97. 87 % for six reference styles...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{whether the}} long-run underperformance of convertible bond issuers {{can be explained}} by earnings management, as reflected in discretionary current accruals {{around the time of the}} offer. Consistent with the earnings management hypothesis, we find that convertible issuers who adjust their discretionary current accruals to report higher net income in the <b>issue</b> <b>year</b> will generally experience inferior operating and stock return performance over the five-year post-issue period. Our findings indicate that there is some temporary overvaluation of convertible issuers by the stock market, but that the resultant disappointed investors will subsequently correct their valuation errors. The similarity of our results to those reported within the prior literature on initial public offers (IPOs) and seasoned equity offers (SEOs) suggests that the earnings management hypothesis is not unique to stock offers, but that it actually extends to convertible bond offers.

40|$|Bibliometrics is a {{relatively}} young and rapidly evolving discipline. Essential for this discipline are bibliometric databases and their information content concerning scientific publications and relevant citations. Databases are unfortunately affected by errors, whose main consequence is represented by omitted citations, i. e., citations that should be ascribed to a certain (cited) paper but, for some reason, are lost. This paper studies the impact of omitted citations on the bibliometric statistics of the major Manufacturing journals. The methodology adopted {{is based on a}} recent automated algorithm—introduced in (Franceschini et al., J Am Soc Inf Sci Technol 64 (10) : 2149 - 2156, 2013) —which is applied to the Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus database. Two important results of this analysis are that: (i) on average, the omitted-citation rate (p) of WoS is slightly higher than that of Scopus; and (ii) for both databases, p values do not change drastically from journal to journal and tend to slightly decrease with respect to the <b>issue</b> <b>year</b> of citing papers. Although it would seem that omitted citations do not represent a substantial problem, they may affect indicators based on citation statistics significantly. This paper analyses the effect of omitted citations on popular bibliometric indicators like the average citations per paper and its most famous variant, i. e., the ISI Impact Factor, showing that journal classifications based on these indicators may lead to questionable discriminations...|$|E
40|$|This thesis studies {{determinants}} of defaults {{experienced in the}} Norwegian High Yield bond market from 2006 to 2013. This is done by finding defaulted issuers from the bonds registered in the Norwegian Trustees database Stamdata. The information about defaulted and non-defaulted companies is coupled with financial and other characteristics {{available at the time}} of the bond issue. From a univariate assessment, the typical issuer that defaulted in the Norwegian High Yield bond had lower profits relative to their debt already before issuance, was significantly smaller than a non-non defaulted issuer, the issue had higher coupon rates adjusted for the level of interbank interest rates, and the issued amount was higher relative to the issuer’s total assets. Of the defaults found in the final sample of 176 issuers, 35 of the 59 (59 %) observed defaults involved issuers that founded their companies less than six years from the <b>issue</b> <b>year.</b> Some of the rather surprisingly results regarding the liquidity ratios and the book equity ratio must be seen in connection with the relative high amount of start-up firms defaulting. Logistic regressions were carried out with default as the dependent variable using the variables in the SEBRA-basic bankruptcy prediction model developed by the Central Bank of Norway. The model performs decent when classifying the non-defaulted companies, but breaks down when classifying the defaulted companies. The logistic regressions back up the conclusions from the univariate analysis regarding profits relative to debt level, the size of the company, and that a start-up firm are more prone to default on their bond issues than more matured companies...|$|E
