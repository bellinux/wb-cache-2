5|$|In July 1889, Police Constable Luke Hanks was {{investigating}} a theft from the London Central Telegraph Office. During the investigation, a fifteen-year-old telegraph boy named Charles Thomas Swinscow was discovered {{to be in}} possession of fourteen shillings, equivalent to several weeks of his wages. At the time, messenger boys were not permitted to carry any personal cash <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> duties, to prevent their own money being mixed {{with that of the}} customers. Suspecting the boy's involvement in the theft, Constable Hanks brought him in for questioning. After hesitating, Swinscow admitted that he earned the money working as a prostitute for a man named Charles Hammond, who operated a male brothel at 19 Cleveland Street. According to Swinscow, he was introduced to Hammond by a General Post Office clerk, eighteen-year-old Henry Newlove. In addition, he named two seventeen-year-old telegraph boys who also worked for Hammond: George Alma Wright and Charles Ernest Thickbroom. Constable Hanks obtained corroborating statements from Wright and Thickbroom and, armed with these, a confession from Newlove.|$|E

Francis Muthaura initially appointed another British lawyer, Karim Ahmad Khan, who previously led the defence of Charles Taylor at the Special Court for Sierra Leone, and subsequently also recruited Essa Faal and Shyamala Alagendra who both formerly worked in the ICC Prosecutor's office. Ali's defence was led by Canadian John Philpot, Kosgey's by Julius Kemboi, and William Ruto appointed Dr. Kindiki Kithure and Katwa Kigeni. Kigeni is also representing Joshua Sang. The Kenyan government has agreed to pay the legal costs of Francis Muthaura and Mohamed Ali due to their actions being taken <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> public employment.

40|$|CONTEXT: Chronic {{exposure}} to talc <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> carpet installation {{can result in}} pneumoconiosis. CASE PRESENTATION: We present {{a case of a}} young carpet installer who was diagnosed with silicatosis of the lung. Review of occupational history revealed that the patient had been working as a carpet installer for approximately 15 years, since he was 15 years of age. The patient was exposed to talc <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> his work. DISCUSSION: Exposure to talc <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> carpet installation has not been reported as a possible cause of pneumoconiosis. In this article we review different causes of silicatosis and discuss chronic exposure <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> carpet installation and development of pneumoconiosis. In addition, we also review the relevance of mycobacterial infection in cases of silicosis and silicatosis. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL OR PROFESSIONAL PRACTICE: Exposure to talc <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> carpet installation should be added to conditions that can cause pneumoconioses, specifically silicatosis of the lung...|$|R

Troops from the Japanese 87th Naval Garrison Force quickly surrounded the beachhead and, as their supply situation grew desperate, the Australians were forced to withdraw. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> evacuation by sea another landing craft ran aground.
