5000|$|SPS at {{the time}} was a {{prominent}} maker of shaft hangers and collars, the latter of which were set in place with set screws. In pursuit of headless set screws with a better drive than a straight slot, Hallowell said, SPS had sourced set screws of square-socket drive from Britain, but they were very expensive. (This was only 2 years after Robertson's Canadian patent.) This cost problem drove SPS to purchase its first screw machine and make its screws in-house, which soon led to SPS's foray into fastener sales (for which it later became well known within the metalworking industries). Hallowell said that [...] "for a while we experimented with a screw containing a square hole like the British screw but soon found these would not be acceptable in this country U.S.. Then we decided to incorporate a <b>hexagon</b> <b>socket</b> into the <b>screw</b> …." [...] Hallowell does not elaborate on why SPS found that the square hole [...] "would not be acceptable in this country", but it seems likely that it would have to have involved licensing Robertson's patent, which would have defeated SPS's purpose of driving down its cost for internal-wrenching screws (and may have been unavailable at any price, as explained at [...] "List of screw drives > Robertson"). The story, if any, of whether SPS's methods required licensing of Allen's 1910 patent is not addressed by Hallowell's memoir. The book does not mention which method—cold forming or linear broaching—was used by SPS in these earliest years. If the latter was used, then Allen's patent would not have been relevant.|$|R

40|$|Background The {{removal of}} well-fixed {{acetabular}} components following THA (total hip arthroplasty) {{is a difficult}} operation and could be accompanied {{by the loss of}} acetabular bone stock. The optimal method for fixation is still under debate. The aim of this pilot study was to compare the tear-out resistance and failure behavior between osseo-integrated and non-integrated screw cups. Furthermore, we examined whether there are differences in the properties mentioned between <b>screw</b> <b>sockets</b> and cemented polyethylene cups. Hypothesis Tear-out resistance and related mechanical work required for the tear-out of osseo-integrated <b>screw</b> <b>sockets</b> are higher than in non-integrated <b>screw</b> <b>sockets.</b> Patients and methods Ten human coxal bones from six cadavers with osseo-integrated <b>screw</b> <b>sockets</b> (n = 4), non-integrated (implanted post-mortem, n = 3) <b>screw</b> <b>sockets</b> and cemented polyethylene cups (n = 3) were used for tear-out testing. The parameters axial failure load and mechanical work for tear-out were introduced as measures for determining the stability of acetabular components following THA. Results The osseo-integrated <b>screw</b> <b>sockets</b> yielded slightly higher tear-out resistance (1. 61 ± 0. 26 kN) and related mechanical work compared to the non-integrated <b>screw</b> <b>sockets</b> (1. 23 ± 0. 39 kN, P = 0. 4). The cemented polyethylene cups yielded the lowest tear-out resistance with a failure load of 1. 18 ± 0. 24 kN. Compared to the screw cups implanted while alive, they also differ on a non-significant level (P = 0. 1). Osseous failure patterns differed especially for the <b>screw</b> <b>sockets</b> compared to the cemented polyethylene cups. Discussion Osseo-integration did not greatly influence the tear-out stability in cementless <b>screw</b> <b>sockets</b> following axial loading. Furthermore, the strength of the bone-implant-interface of cementless <b>screw</b> <b>sockets</b> appears to be similar to cemented polyethylene cups. However, given the high failure load, high mechanical load and because of the related bone failure patterns, removal should not be performed by means of tear-out but rather by osteotomes or other curved cutting devices to preserve the acetabular bone stock...|$|R

5000|$|Concerning the {{dissemination}} of the screws and wrenches, Hallowell said that [...] "the transition from a square head set screw refers here to the then-ubiquitous external-wrenching square drive to a <b>hexagon</b> <b>socket</b> head hollow set screw, for {{which had to be}} developed special keys or wrenches for tightening or loosening the screw, was the cause of more profanity among the mechanics and machine manufacturers than any other single event that happened. … I am sure that the old-timers who read this book will remember this period vividly." [...] (These transitional growing pains echo those experienced many decades later with the adoption of the Torx drive).|$|R
5000|$|Hex <b>socket</b> <b>screw</b> {{heads are}} usually made by {{stamping}} {{the head with}} a die, plastically deforming the metal. Other ways to generate the hex socket include linear broaching and rotary broaching. Broaching the heads with a linear broach is essentially the metalworking analog of mortising wood with a mortising machine; a hole is drilled and then the corners are broached out. This operation often leaves little telltale curled chips still attached {{at the bottom of the}} socket. These are negligible for most applications.|$|R
50|$|Canadian P.L. Robertson, {{though he}} was not the first person to patent the idea of socket-head screws, was the first to {{successfully}} commercialize them, starting in 1908. <b>Socket</b> <b>screws</b> rapidly grew in popularity, and are still a favorite of mechanics today for their resistance to wear and tear, compatibility with hex keys, and ability to stop a power tool when set.

5000|$|Extant records suggest (without {{offering}} exhaustive documentation) {{that the}} idea of a hex <b>socket</b> <b>screw</b> drive was probably conceived as early as the 1860s to the 1890s, but that such screws were probably not manufactured until around 1910.

50|$|The Fisher Body company, {{which made}} the car bodies for the Ford Motor Company, was one of Robertson's first {{customers}} and used over 700 Robertson screws in its Model T car.

Phillips had invented another kind of <b>socket</b> <b>screw</b> and had no such reservations.

50|$|Manual impact drivers {{consist of}} a heavy outer sleeve that {{surrounds}} an inner core that is splined to it. The spline is curved {{so that when the}} user strikes the outer sleeve with a hammer, its downward force works on the spline to produce turning force on the core and any socket or work bit attached to it. The tool translates the heavy rotational inertia of the sleeve to the lighter core to generate large amounts of torque. At the same time, the striking blow from the hammer forces the impact driver down into the screw reducing or eliminating cam out. This attribute is beneficial for Phillips screws which are prone to cam out. It is also excellent for use with the Robertson square <b>socket</b> head <b>screws</b> that are in common use in Canada. It is less beneficial for slot head screws and is not beneficial at all for most other types.|$|R
50|$|Two metal cams, one {{stationary}} and one movable, {{are used}} to immobilize the rope. The position of the movable cam {{is controlled by the}} locking handle. When the handle is raised, the movable cam is pressed towards the stationary cam so as to grip the rope by compressing it between the cams. Conversely, the lock is released by lowering the handle, thus retracting the movable cam away from the stationary cam and releasing the grip on the rope. The position of the stationary cam can usually be adjusted with a <b>socket</b> head adjustment <b>screw.</b> This enables the spacing between the cams to be adjusted so that, when locked, the rope lock can accommodate ropes of different diameters.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a series of tests in which high strength fasteners, <b>socket</b> head set <b>screws</b> (SHCS), were tightened to yield as a means of generating maximum clamping force. The tightening tests were performed {{with the aid of a}} microprocessor controlled torque wrench and a torque-tension testing rig. Load cells fitted to the test rig provided an accurate measurement of the joint clamp load and the faster thread and underhead torque distribution under a range of lubrication conditions. Measurements were made during tightening to yield, under static load condition after yield tightening, and during loosening. The results obtained established that the lubrication conditions dramatically affect the magnitude of the maximum clamp load achieved on the joint and the torque distribution on the fastener. The results also enabled an estimate to be made of the coefficient of friction on the various mating surfaces during the tightening and loosening of the fastener. It was shown that the design of bolted joints must take account of the influence of friction if thejoints are to operate effectively in service. ...|$|R
