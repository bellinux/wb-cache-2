25|$|Jandamarra {{was held}} in awe by other Aboriginal people who {{believed}} he was immortal, his body simply a physical manifestation of a spirit that resided in a water soak near Tunnel Creek. It was believed that only an Aboriginal person with similar mystical powers could kill him. Police chasing Jandamarra were also in awe at his ability to cross the rugged ranges with no effect on <b>his</b> <b>bare</b> <b>feet,</b> despite their boots being cut to shreds by the sharp rocks.|$|E
25|$|Dodge, {{with many}} other POWs from the Allied defeat in France, was forced to march towards Germany. During the march <b>his</b> <b>bare</b> <b>feet</b> became badly cut, and {{eventually}} he was put on a barge with other Army prisoners for transport to Germany. While on the River Scheldt he jumped overboard, but was handed over to a Luftwaffe officer by a frightened Dutch civilian. As {{he had become a}} captive of the Luftwaffe, he, with all Air Force POWs, was sent to the Dulag Luft reception and transit camp at Oberursel.|$|E
25|$|By 1971 Keating {{had come}} to be {{regarded}} as one of the great full-forwards of the era, as Tipperary regrouped for one final push at glory. A 4-16 to 3-18 victory over Limerick gave him a fourth Munster medal. On 5 September 1971 Kilkenny faced Tipperary in the All-Ireland final, the first to be broadcast in colour by Telefís Éireann and the only eighty-minute meeting between the two sides. Kilkenny's ever-dependable goalkeeper, Ollie Walsh, had a nightmare of a game in which he conceded five goals, one of which passed through his legs, while Keating played out the closing stages of the game in <b>his</b> <b>bare</b> <b>feet.</b> Tipperary emerged the victors on a score line of 5-17 to 5-14. It was his second All-Ireland medal. Keating finished off the year by winning an All-Star before being named Texaco Hurler of the Year.|$|E
60|$|Puck coughed a small cough as {{he shifted}} {{a piece of}} wood with <b>his</b> <b>bare</b> <b>foot.</b>|$|R
60|$|That was {{all very}} well, but I'm sure Captain Chris jumped {{the first time he}} ever put <b>his</b> <b>bare</b> <b>foot</b> into a sponge under water.|$|R
50|$|As a result, Lee {{had broken}} the ankle strap on his boot after taking the mark. He removed his boots and kicked the goal with <b>his</b> <b>bare</b> <b>foot.</b>|$|R
500|$|Yount {{enlisted in}} the Union Army for a six-month term on November 9, 1861, and served in Company F of Phelps' Regiment of the Missouri Infantry. John W. Phelps, his {{commanding}} general, was an ardent abolitionist. [...] Yount {{was wounded in the}} leg in a skirmish just before the Battle of Pea Ridge began on March 6, 1862, and taken prisoner by the Confederates. [...] As a captive, he was marched more than [...] to Fort Smith in <b>his</b> <b>bare</b> <b>feet</b> on cold, wet roads, and was held there as a POW for 28days before his release in a prisoner exchange. [...] He was discharged from the Union Army in May 1862.|$|E
500|$|Magnus grew {{up among}} the hird (royal retinue) {{of his father}} in Nidaros (modern Trondheim), de facto capital of Norway at the time. His father's cousin, the {{chieftain}} Tore Ingeridsson, was foster-father to Magnus. In his youth, he was apparently more similar to his warlike grandfather, King Harald Hardrada, than to his father (who bore the byname Kyrre: [...] "the Peaceful"). According to Snorri Sturluson, Magnus was considered handsome and gifted in learning; although he was shorter in stature than his grandfather Harald, he was reportedly known as [...] "Magnus the Tall". Magnus' more-common byname, [...] "Barefoot" [...] or [...] "Barelegs", was—according to Snorri—due to his adopting the Gaelic dress of the Irish and Scots: a short tunic, which left the lower legs bare. Another version (by Danish historian Saxo Grammaticus) maintains that he acquired the nickname because {{he was forced to}} flee from a Swedish attack in <b>his</b> <b>bare</b> <b>feet,</b> while a third explains that he rode barefoot (like the Irish). Due to Magnus' aggressive nature and his campaigns abroad, he also had the nickname styrjaldar-Magnús ("Warrior Magnus" [...] or [...] "Magnus the Strife-lover").|$|E
2500|$|... "And the bare-footed wonder {{with the}} ball now" [...] - O'Hehir's {{description}} of Babs Keating who played some of the 1971 All-Ireland Hurling Final in <b>his</b> <b>bare</b> <b>feet</b> ...|$|E
6000|$|Sam {{climbed out}} of the cab, and holding up the counterpane walked across the yard in <b>'is</b> <b>bare</b> <b>feet</b> to the stable. [...] "Well, will you drive me 'ome?" [...] he ses.|$|R
6000|$|... "Peace! It was {{a shameful}} thing and a cruel!" [...] cried the little prince, {{stamping}} <b>his</b> <b>bare</b> <b>foot.</b> [...] "If the King--Stir not a step till I come again! It is a command!" ...|$|R
60|$|Link Merwell {{certainly}} {{looked the}} picture of misery. His clothing was much tattered and still wet, and his forehead was swollen from contact with the rocks. One of his shoes was so cut that <b>his</b> <b>bare</b> <b>foot</b> was exposed.|$|R
2500|$|At Cuauhtémoc's request, Cortés {{also allowed}} the {{defeated}} Mexica to depart the city unmolested. Subsequently, however, when the booty found did not {{measure up to}} the Spaniards' expectations, Cuauhtémoc was subjected to [...] "torture by fire", whereby the soles of <b>his</b> <b>bare</b> <b>feet</b> were slowly broiled over red-hot coals, in an unsuccessful attempt to discover its whereabouts. On the statue to Cuauhtemoc, on the Paseo de la Reforma in Mexico City, there is a bas relief showing the Spaniards' torture of the emperor. Eventually, some gold was recovered but far less than Cortés and his men expected.|$|E
2500|$|In 1971 ‘the Cats’ {{reclaimed}} the Leinster {{title from}} Wexford and booked {{their place in}} the All-Ireland final. [...] Fierce rivals Tipperary provided the opposition in one of the great All-Ireland finals of the decade. [...] The game was notable as it was the first All-Ireland final to be broadcast in colour by Telefís Éireann. [...] Tipperary relied on two freak goals to put them in the driving seat, one of which passed through Ollie Walsh’s legs. [...] Kilkenny’s Eddie Keher surpassed his own record by scoring 2-11, in spite of ending up on the losing side. [...] The game is also memorable for the fact that Michael ‘Babs’ Keating discarded his boots and socks and played out the last period of the game in <b>his</b> <b>bare</b> <b>feet.</b> [...] The final score of 5-17 to 5-14 gave Tipperary a merited victory and allowed the team to go top of the all-time roll of honour. [...] Furthermore, Tipp wouldn’t win another All-Ireland title for eighteen years.|$|E
2500|$|In 1990, an {{unspecified}} K9 unit appeared with Sylvester McCoy as the Seventh Doctor and Sophie Aldred as Ace in {{an episode of}} the children's education programme Search Out Science entitled Search Out Space, which was included as an extra on {{the release of the}} Doctor Who story Survival by the BBC. Another unspecified K9 unit also appeared in the 1993 charity special Dimensions in Time. In the 1998 computer game Fallout 2, the Navarro base has a damaged robot dog known as K9, which uses similar speech mannerisms to the Infobox Doctor Who character. If repaired, the cyberdog is willing to join the character's party as a companion. In the 1999 television series Queer as Folk (written by future Doctor Who executive producer Russell T Davies), a K9 model is given to the character Vince as a birthday present. The prop used was an original, operated [...] as occasionally in Doctor Who [...] by visual effects assistant Mat Irvine. In the second series of I'm Alan Partridge (2002), the character of Alan Partridge recalls how his purchase of the rights to K9 contributed to his mental breakdown and driving to Dundee in <b>his</b> <b>bare</b> <b>feet</b> while gorging on Toblerone. In the South Park episode [...] "Go God Go XII" [...] (2006), Eric Cartman, being trapped in the year 2546, has acquired a robot dog called [...] "K-10", a parody of K9. Due to timeline alterations, he is replaced by robot cat [...] "Kit-9" [...] and later robot bird, [...] "Cocka-3". K9 appeared on a special Doctor Who-themed edition of The Weakest Link in 2007, but was voted out unanimously {{at the end of the}} first round, despite answering his question correctly. Anne Robinson (whom K9 addressed as [...] "Mistress") said [...] "I'm so sorry" [...] before declaring him the weakest link.|$|E
60|$|He stamped angrily, and <b>his</b> <b>bare</b> <b>foot</b> {{came down}} on a small, sharp pebble. With a brief exclamation he seized his foot {{in one hand and}} hopped up the beach. While hopping, he {{delivered}} his ultimatum. Probably the only instance on record of a father adopting this attitude in dismissing a suitor.|$|R
60|$|I {{locked up}} agin, and 'ad {{another look at}} the dock. The water 'ad nearly gone and the mud was showing in patches. My mind went back to a sailorman wot had dropped 'is watch over-board two years before, and found it by walking about in the dock in <b>'is</b> <b>bare</b> <b>feet.</b> He found it more easy because the glass broke when he trod on it.|$|R
60|$|Still the {{children}} stared at him--from his dark-blue cap, {{like a big}} columbine flower, to <b>his</b> <b>bare,</b> hairy <b>feet.</b> At last he laughed.|$|R
60|$|They {{heard the}} patter of <b>his</b> <b>bare</b> <b>feet</b> on the pavement, and the cry repeated.|$|E
60|$|The indistinct {{murmur of}} his {{criticism}} went away, faded and died out {{together with the}} soft footfall of <b>his</b> <b>bare</b> <b>feet</b> in the dark passage.|$|E
6000|$|... "Barlow he's tellin' round {{that she}} 's very fine appearin'." [...] He handed the corn-ball to Widow Seth Wray's boy, who went noiselessly out on <b>his</b> <b>bare</b> <b>feet.</b>|$|E
60|$|Ginger and Peter was {{for getting}} out, but Sam wouldn't 'ear of it. It {{was bad enough}} being {{wrapped up in a}} blanket in a cab, without being turned out in <b>'is</b> <b>bare</b> <b>feet</b> on the pavement, and at last Ginger apologized to the cabman by saying 'e {{supposed}} if he was a liar he couldn't 'elp it. The cabman collected three shillings more to go to Guy's 'orsepittle, and, arter a few words with Ginger, climbed up on 'is box and drove off agin.|$|R
60|$|Jerry, {{scarcely}} {{aware of}} Lerumie's presence, was trotting past {{on his way}} aft to where Borckman, the mate, was superintending the stringing of the barbed wire to the stanchions. And Lerumie, with a side-long look {{to see if the}} deed meditated for his foot was screened from observation, aimed a kick at the son of his four-legged enemy. <b>His</b> <b>bare</b> <b>foot</b> caught Jerry on the sensitive end of his recently bobbed tail, and Jerry, outraged, with the sense of sacrilege committed upon him, went instantly wild.|$|R
50|$|In 2001, Bronstein was {{attacked}} by a Komodo dragon at the Los Angeles Zoo. He was on a private tour, and a keeper had invited him into the enclosure. Bronstein was bitten on <b>his</b> <b>bare</b> <b>foot,</b> as the keeper {{had told him to}} take off his white shoes and socks, which the keeper stated could potentially excite the Komodo dragon as they were the same color as the white rats the zoo fed the dragon. Although he escaped, Bronstein needed to have several tendons in his foot reattached surgically.|$|R
6000|$|Willie shook in his boots, figuratively speaking, for {{in reality}} he shook upon <b>his</b> <b>bare</b> <b>feet.</b> [...] "Lemme go," [...] he wailed, [...] "an' I won't tell nobody nothin'." ...|$|E
60|$|And even as {{his mind}} dwelt delightedly upon the subject a ragged Indian {{carrying}} a carbine and with heavy silver spurs strapped to <b>his</b> <b>bare</b> <b>feet</b> approached and saluted him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, my eye! Where can I move to!" [...] cries the boy, {{clutching}} quite desperately at {{his hair}} and beating <b>his</b> <b>bare</b> <b>feet</b> upon the floor of Mr. Snagsby's passage.|$|E
50|$|Mayilattam {{performer}} wears costumes {{from head}} to toe like peacock with beak, that can be opened and closed using a thread and performs specific dances. The performer dances not on <b>his</b> <b>bare</b> <b>foot</b> but on a tall piece of wood attached {{at the end of his}} feet. This art requires extensive training and practise. Even today this dance will be performed in all Murguan(Lord Subrahmanya) temples as a tradition during festivals.But due to the difficulties in practise and less amount of wages for the dancers, the number of Mayilattam performers is decreasing.|$|R
2500|$|According to Harper's New Monthly Magazine, {{toward the}} end of his career, he was present when an {{itinerant}} missionary was exhorting an open-air congregation in Mansfield, Ohio. The sermon was long and severe on the topic of extravagance, because the pioneers were buying such indulgences as calico and imported tea. [...] "Where now is there a man who, like the primitive Christians, is traveling to heaven barefooted and clad in coarse raiment?" [...] the preacher repeatedly asked until Johnny Appleseed, his endurance worn out, walked up to the preacher, put <b>his</b> <b>bare</b> <b>foot</b> on the stump that had served as a podium, and said, [...] "Here's your primitive Christian!" [...] The flummoxed sermonizer dismissed the congregation.|$|R
50|$|Even {{seemingly}} docile dragons {{may become}} unpredictably aggressive, {{especially when the}} animal's territory is invaded by someone unfamiliar. In June 2001, a Komodo dragon seriously injured Phil Bronstein, the then husband of actress Sharon Stone, when he entered its enclosure at the Los Angeles Zoo after being invited in by its keeper. Bronstein was bitten on <b>his</b> <b>bare</b> <b>foot,</b> as the keeper {{had told him to}} take off his white shoes and socks, which the keeper stated could potentially excite the Komodo dragon as they were the same colour as the white rats the zoo fed the dragon. Although he escaped, Bronstein needed to have several tendons in his foot reattached surgically.|$|R
60|$|Miguel {{had worked}} {{himself up to}} a state of great excitement, and when he finished, <b>his</b> <b>bare</b> <b>feet</b> went pattering off across the deck almost before Grahame could give the order.|$|E
60|$|He {{remained}} {{standing on the}} chair, not caring to venture {{on the floor in}} <b>his</b> <b>bare</b> <b>feet</b> and with the mice still at liberty. He had placed his shoes under the head of the bed.|$|E
60|$|Better {{to cling}} to the smooth stone he kicked off his sandals of zitidar hide and with <b>his</b> <b>bare</b> <b>feet</b> braced himself against the sickening tilt, {{at the same time}} {{throwing}} his arms supportingly about the girl.|$|E

6000|$|However, it was {{not there}} merely to be looked at, for after giving me a glance which said [...] "Now observe!" [...] he raised <b>his</b> <b>bare</b> <b>foot</b> and ran <b>his</b> mouth along the toes, like one playing on a barbaric instrument. He then tossed his foot aside, smiled his long triumphant smile and intimated that it was now my turn to do something. I thought the best thing I could {{do would be to}} put his sock on him again, but as soon as I tried to do so I {{discovered}} why Irene had warned me so portentously against taking it off. I should say that she had trouble in socking him every morning.|$|R
60|$|There was no time, just then, {{to inquire}} what the Speaking Oak had said. But the briskness of her tone {{encouraged}} the young man; and besides, {{he had never}} in his life felt so vigorous and mighty as since taking this old woman on his back. Instead of being exhausted, he gathered strength as he went on; and, struggling up against the torrent, he at last gained the opposite shore, clambered up the bank, and set down the old dame and her peacock safely on the grass. As soon as this was done, however, {{he could not help}} looking rather despondently at <b>his</b> <b>bare</b> <b>foot,</b> with only a remnant of the golden string of the sandal clinging round his ankle.|$|R
