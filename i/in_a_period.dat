40|$|We {{investigated}} {{geomagnetic activity}} which was induced by interplanetary magnetic clouds {{during the past}} four solar cycles, 1965 &ndash; 1998. We {{have found that the}} intensity of such geomagnetic storms is more severe in solar maximum than in solar minimum. In addition, we affirm that the average solar wind speed of magnetic clouds is faster in solar maximum than in solar minimum. In this study, we find that solar activity level plays a major role on the intensity of geomagnetic storms. In particular, some new statistical results are found and listed as follows. (1) The intensity of <b>a</b> geomagnetic storm <b>in</b> <b>a</b> solar active <b>period</b> is stronger than <b>in</b> <b>a</b> solar quiet <b>period.</b> (2) The magnitude of negative Bzmin is larger <b>in</b> <b>a</b> solar active <b>period</b> than <b>in</b> <b>a</b> quiet <b>period.</b> (3) Solar wind speed <b>in</b> <b>an</b> active <b>period</b> is faster than <b>in</b> <b>a</b> quiet <b>period.</b> (4) VBsmax <b>in</b> <b>an</b> active <b>period</b> is much larger than <b>in</b> <b>a</b> quiet <b>period.</b> (5) Solar wind parameters, Bzmin, Vmax and VBsmax are correlated well with geomagnetic storm intensity, Dstmin during <b>a</b> solar active <b>period.</b> (6) Solar wind parameters, Bzmin, and VBsmax are not correlated well (very poorly for Vmax) with geomagnetic storm intensity during <b>a</b> solar quiet <b>period.</b> (7) The speed of the solar wind plays <b>a</b> key role <b>in</b> the correlation of solar wind parameters vs. the intensity of a geomagnetic storm.
