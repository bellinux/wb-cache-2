5|$|When Tennyson {{heard on}} 1 October 1833 of his friend's death, {{he was living}} in Somersby, Lincolnshire, in cramped {{quarters}} with his mother and nine of his ten siblings. His father had died in 1831, requiring Tennyson to return <b>home</b> <b>and</b> <b>take</b> responsibility for the family. Tennyson's friends were becoming increasingly concerned about his mental and physical health during this time. The family had little income, and three of Tennyson's brothers were mentally ill. Just as Tennyson's outlook was improving—he was adjusting to his new domestic duties, regaining contact with friends, and had published his 1832 book of poems—the news of Hallam's death arrived. Tennyson shared his grief with his sister, Emily, who had been engaged to Hallam.|$|E

Once there, the individual declares the produce in front of three {{people who do not}} live with him. He then waits to give the witnesses a chance to claim the produce. Once they have taken what they want, he is permitted to reclaim whatever remains. It is permissible to choose three people whom one knows will not claim the produce for themselves, even though they are legally entitled to.|$|E

25|$|Seven more {{errors in}} nine more chances {{followed}} that day, a debacle that McGraw would not soon forget. After the team opened with no wins in six contests, Kenney {{and the other}} members of the ownership of the team—in the face of attendance that had dwindled to nearly nothing—were forced to overhaul the team. McGraw was given his release from the team, but Kenney also loaned him $70 and wished him luck if he wanted to try to catch on with another squad. McGraw could not bear the thought of going home a failure, as both his father and Mary Goddard had urged him to stay <b>home</b> <b>and</b> <b>take</b> a regular job, instead of chasing his dream of being a ballplayer. McGraw was resolute in his determination to make a name for himself as a professional baseball player, even if that meant struggling along in poverty for a time.|$|E

He had his first serious romantic relationship, living with John Perry, an {{unsuccessful}} actor, later a writer, who remained a lifelong friend after their affair ended. Morley makes the point that, like Coward, Gielgud's principal passion was the stage; both men had casual dalliances, but were more comfortable with [...] "low-maintenance" [...] long-term partners who did not impede their theatrical work and ambitions.|$|E
2500|$|You gotta realize that, out of {{the whole}} cast, nobody was over thirty. Diane Lane was, I think, eighteen. It was an {{enormous}} Hollywood production. My manager had me hire a limousine {{to pick me up}} at <b>home</b> <b>and</b> <b>take</b> me to work. I was like, [...] "Jesus, this is incredible. This is... Hollywood. The real Hollywood. The Hollywood they make movies about."... It was scary. And Walter isn't {{the kind of guy who}} works well with kids. He's a cowboy. He's like John Ford. [...] "Don't ask me how to act! I'm a director!" [...] (Laughs) ...|$|E

Under a system {{peculiar}} to Ireland {{he did not have}} to live in Dublin to attend lectures, but could study at <b>home</b> <b>and</b> <b>take</b> examinations at the university when necessary. He was called to the bar in 1839, but he never practised and soon abandoned law for journalism. In 1838 he began contributing stories to the Dublin University Magazine, including his first ghost story, entitled [...] "The Ghost and the Bone-Setter" [...] (1838). He became owner of several newspapers from 1840, including the Dublin Evening Mail and the Warder.|$|E

2500|$|Within a {{few months}} of his arrival in Ireland, Irvine was already disillusioned with the Faith Mission. There was {{friction}} over its Holiness teachings, and Irvine saw its organization as a violation of his concept of a faith-based ministry. Above all, Irvine was increasingly intolerant of the Faith Mission's cooperation with the other churches and clergy in the various communities of southern Ireland, regarding converts who joined churches as [...] "lost among the clergy". In 1897, he began preaching independently, proclaiming that true ministers must have no <b>home</b> <b>and</b> <b>take</b> no salary. He became convinced that he had received this as a special revelation he referred to as his [...] "Alpha message". Opposed to all other established churches, he held that {{the manner in which the}} disciples had been sent out in chapter 10 of the Gospel of Matthew was a permanent commandment which must still be observed. The passage reads in part: ...|$|E
2500|$|Hideo Kojima {{compared}} {{the notion of}} the Switch to his idea of [...] "transfarring" [...] that he presented in 2011, allowing players to take a game from a home platform to a portable one, which became the basis of Sony's Cross-Buy program. He said that the Switch was [...] "an extension of that idea. The fact you can play something at <b>home</b> <b>and</b> <b>take</b> it outside, this is the gamer's dream. The Switch is an evolution of that." [...] Capcom stated that while they are committed to releasing titles for the Switch, they [...] "do feel that there are differences in the desired direction and the play-style of the Nintendo Switch and those of the PlayStation 4 or Xbox One" [...] and may not be releasing cross-platform games for the new console. Bethesda's Todd Howard stated, [...] "I think Nintendo is the only company that could pull something like this off," [...] commenting on the Nintendo Switch's design and functionality. Bethesda is releasing [...] on the Switch, and Howard has stated that Nintendo reached out to Bethesda for possible support of the console.|$|E
