This includes Monte Carlo calculations, 3D rendering and Mandelbrot maps.|$|E
5|$|Bacterial {{insecticides}} can {{be effective}} if application <b>is</b> <b>targeted</b> towards the vulnerable early-instar larvae. Two strains of the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis produce toxins which kill the larvae. Other forms of pest control, through non-pesticidal management are available. Feeding can be inhibited by applying antifeedants, such as fungicides or products derived from Neem (Azadirachta indica), but these may have negative effects on the plants as well. The steam distillate of fresh leaves and flowers of tansy (Tanacetum vulgare) contains high levels of camphor and umbellulone and these chemicals are strongly repellent to L. decemlineata.|$|E

5|$|Compared to Final Fantasy XI, where party-based {{gameplay}} is forefront at all times, the gameplay in XIV is adjusted so {{that players}} {{can go for}} longer periods without joining a party. There is no auto-attack option, with each action needing a manual input while an enemy <b>is</b> <b>targeted.</b> Each action uses up a stamina bar. Through defeating monsters, crafting items, and completing quests, players accumulate EXP which, when a certain threshold is reached, automatically increments the player's level. The player's level affects attributes such as HP (health/hit points), MP (magic/mana points), {{and the number of}} abilities available to them.|$|E

Vision Technologies Systems launched {{a similar program}} in December 2011. All three aftermarket conversions modify the forward portion of the aircraft to provide room for up to ten cargo pallets, while leaving the remaining space to fit around 45 to 58 passenger seats. This configuration <b>is</b> <b>targeted</b> at commercial charter flights which transport heavy equipment and personnel simultaneously.

5|$|In {{the board}} (and card) game domain, 4X {{is less of}} a {{distinct}} genre, {{in part because of the}} practical constraints of components and playing time. The Civilization board game that gave rise to Sid Meier's Civilization computer game, for instance, has no exploration and no extermination. Unless extermination <b>is</b> <b>targeted</b> at non-player entities, it tends to be either nearly impossible (because of play balance mechanisms, since player elimination is usually considered an undesirable feature) or certainly unachievable (because victory conditions are triggered before extermination can be completed) in board games.|$|E

5|$|The {{mechanism}} by which a polyubiquitinated protein <b>is</b> <b>targeted</b> to the proteasome is not fully understood. Ubiquitin-receptor proteins have an N-terminal ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain and one or more ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domains. The UBL domains are recognized by the 19S proteasome caps and the UBA domains bind ubiquitin via three-helix bundles. These receptor proteins may escort polyubiquitinated proteins to the proteasome, though the specifics of this interaction and its regulation are unclear.|$|E
5|$|Hobgood et al. {{argue that}} one key {{component}} in equipping nations to develop emergency medical systems {{is to identify}} the aspects of training that are essential for health care providers. In their view, a standard curriculum is useful for identifying core issues, even if countries have very different needs and resources. To address this goal, the International Federation for Emergency Medicine developed a model curriculum in 2009. This initiative seeks to provide a minimum basic standard that can be tailored to {{the specific needs of}} the various nations implementing training in emergency medicine. It <b>is</b> <b>targeted</b> towards all medical students in order to produce a minimum competency in emergency care for all physicians, regardless of their specialty.|$|E

The remaining Mew Mews continue {{to eliminate the}} Chimera Animas {{left behind by the}} aliens. They face a new threat {{in the form of the}} Saint Rose Crusaders: humans with special powers who desire to conquer the world and create a utopia while taking over the remaining Chimera Animas. Berry Shirayuki becomes the sixth Mew Mew and temporarily takes Ichigo's place as the leader. Berry is the first Mew Mew to be infused with the DNA of two endangered species, the Andean mountain cat and the Amami rabbit. As one of the strongest Mew Mews, Berry <b>is</b> <b>targeted</b> by two of the Crusaders, who attack her at school. Ichigo returns to provide assistance during this battle. For their final attack, two Crusaders hypnotize the citizens of Tokyo and set them against the Mew Mews.

5|$|Several {{species of}} {{cockatoo}} can be serious agricultural pests. They are sometimes controlled by shooting, poisoning or capture followed by gassing. Non-lethal damage mitigation methods used include scaring, habitat manipulation {{and the provision}} of decoy food dumps or sacrifice crops to distract them from the main crop. They can be a nuisance in urban areas due to destruction of property. They maintain their bills in the wild by chewing on wood but, in suburbia, they may chew outdoor furniture, door and window frames; soft decorative timbers such as western red cedar are readily demolished. Birds may also target external wiring and fixtures such as solar water heaters, television antennae and satellite dishes. A business in central Melbourne suffered as sulphur-crested cockatoos repeatedly stripped the silicone sealant from the plate glass windows. Galahs and red-tailed black cockatoos have stripped electrical cabling in rural areas and tarpaulin <b>is</b> <b>targeted</b> elsewhere. Outside Australia, the Tanimbar corella is a pest on Yamdena Island where it raids maize crops.|$|E
5|$|The game {{takes place}} on the {{floating}} island of Skyloft and surrounding airborne islands; and the three Surface overworlds {{where the majority of}} the main adventure takes place. Side quests for the town's citizens are unlocked as the game progresses. The different areas of the Surface are accessed through portals in the clouds. Side quests for characters of the Surface are also available, and sometimes mandatory for completing the main quest. The Skyloft overworld is navigated with a great bird called a Loftwing, while the Surface is navigated on foot. Marker beacons can be set on the map for Link to follow, and save points in the form of statues preserve Link's progress up to that point. During his quest, Link is aided by the sword spirit Fi, who is able to give hints to the player for both environmental elements and enemies: for example, when an enemy <b>is</b> <b>targeted</b> and Fi is summoned, she will give the enemy's characteristics and weaknesses.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, {{almost no}} {{country in the}} world had a women's {{national}} football team. Djibouti was no exception: women's football was not officially organised in the country until 2002 and then, only for players sixteen years and older. As of 2009, there were only eight women's clubs for these players in the country. There is a regional and national women's competition, which was established in 2007. The league provided the first opportunity for women outside the capital and major cities to play football. The country has a women's national team but has no youth teams, meaning no U17 or U20 teams. 12% of the money from the FIFA Financial Assistance Programme (FAP) <b>is</b> <b>targeted</b> at the technical development of the game, which includes women's football, sport medicine and futsal. This compares to 11% specifically set aside for men's competitions and 10% set aside for youth football. Between 1991 and 2010, there was no FIFA FUTURO III regional course for women's coaching. A FUTURO III regional course men's coaching workshop was hosted in 2008. In 2007, there was a women's football seminar held in the country. In 2007, there was a FIFA MA course held for women/youth football.|$|E

5|$|Lucas Fitzgerald {{admits to}} Mark {{that he is}} {{involved}} in illegal races, and Mark goes undercover to catch the gang. Mark eventually catches the ringleader of the illegal races, Garland Cole (Jack Finsterer), after he asks Lucas to rebirth some cars for him. After Rebecca admits to pushing Paul, Kate confesses to giving her a false alibi. Mark breaks up with her, but he becomes jealous when it appears she is moving on with Kyle Canning. Mark briefly moves in with Toadfish Rebecchi, when his home has to be fumigated, and becomes a role model to his son, Callum (Morgan Baker). Kyle turns to Mark for help when he is blackmailed by corrupt policeman Wes Holland. Mark does not initially believe Kyle, but after seeing Holland taking a bribe, Mark arrests him. Some of Mark's colleagues turn against him. He has a one-night stand with Jade Mitchell and Kate struggles to forgive him. Mark <b>is</b> <b>targeted</b> with small acts of revenge for arresting Holland. Things escalate and Mark is asked to go into witness protection until the trial. Mark asks Kate {{to go with him}} and she agrees. However, she misses the deadline and Mark leaves without her. Shortly afterwards Toadie overhears a conversation at the police station and learns Mark has been killed. He is forbidden from telling anyone, but ultimately convinces the superintendent to tell Kate, who is heartbroken.|$|E
5|$|The Decepticon {{scientist}} Shockwave {{begins the}} secretive Operation: Regenesis — seeding Energon on various planets, including Earth. While stabilizing Earth's seeding, the Dynobots attack Shockwave, {{and they are}} all buried in molten lava for thousands of years. Bludgeon is assigned by Megatron to investigate Operation: Regenesis and Soundwave is told to spy on him. In 1984, Soundwave learns to his horror that Bludgeon intends to use the Ultra-Energon on Earth to re-animate Thunderwing, but is silenced and put into stasis-lock in his cassette player mode. The following year, an organization named Skywatch find Laserbeak and Ravage's bodies. Starscream and his unit later come to Earth, discover Shockwave's Energon and mine it in Nebraska. When they exhaust this supply in 2006, they move to Oregon, entering siege mode to protect their discovery. As part of their plan to acquire a Transformer, an agent working for the Machination takes a photo of a Decepticon transforming and locates the original Decepticon base. As a response he <b>is</b> <b>targeted</b> and killed by Thundercracker, Runabout and Runamuck. Before his death, his laptop with the photo is stolen by a girl named Verity Carlo and she is taken to the Autobots - inadvertently leading the Machination straight to them via a homing device in the laptop.|$|E
5|$|The game's prologue sees Garrett, the protagonist, {{describing}} his youth as a homeless orphan on the City's streets. He is caught {{while attempting to}} pickpocket a suspicious man who reveals {{himself to be a}} Keeper. Impressed by Garrett's ability to see him, he offers him the chance to join his order. Garrett accepts, but later leaves the order to pursue a life of thievery. Years later, Garrett works as a thief, and is under pressure to join a crime ring. As punishment for his failure to pay a protection fee, he <b>is</b> <b>targeted</b> for assassination by the crime lord Ramirez. Garrett evades the assassins, and robs Ramirez's mansion in retaliation. Following this, he is approached by a woman named Viktoria—the representative of an anonymous client who was impressed by Garrett's theft from Ramirez. He is contracted to steal a sword from Constantine, an eccentric nobleman who recently arrived in the City. After Garrett completes the mission, Viktoria takes him to Constantine, who explains that he hired Garrett to steal his own sword as a test. Constantine offers him a fortune to steal The Eye—a gem kept within a sealed and deserted Hammerite cathedral.|$|E

5|$|At a Nintendo {{press conference}} in Tokyo, Japan on October 5, 2005, the company {{announced}} several games {{that it would be}} releasing in 2006 in Japan. The list included Brain Age 2, with a release date set for December 29, 2005. Nintendo later announced that the game would be released in Europe on June 29, 2007 for €30, and in Australia on July 5, 2007 for A$49.95. The American version of Brain Age 2 was first revealed in May 2007. The game <b>is</b> <b>targeted</b> to casual gamers, similar to its predecessor; its basic concepts stay the same as in , along with the graphics, menu, and presentation. Brain Age 2 also uses the same Sudoku engine, an addition in the original Brain Age that has been applauded for being one of the best handheld Sudoku games available; Brain Age 2s rendition of Sudoku introduces 100 new puzzles. All of the minigames in the game are new to the series; however, some of them are derived from exercises in Brain Age. One of the challenges in the first game, Head Count, requires that the player count how many people are shown on the screen; after a few seconds, a house falls on top of them, and then several people leave and enter the house. Afterward, the player must write down how many people they think are still in the house. A variation of this game is available in Brain Age 2, called Memory Sprint, which asks the player to observe a specific sprinter in a race as they pass other sprinters and are passed themselves, and then determine which place they finished in after they cross the finish line. The game's voice recognition technology has improved since the last game. The only challenge that uses the feature, Rock, Paper, Scissors, requires that the player speak the correct answer into the microphone as soon as possible.|$|E
5|$|Evidence from {{microelectrode}} recordings {{from the}} brains of animals shows that dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra are strongly activated by {{a wide variety of}} rewarding events. These reward-responsive dopamine neurons in the VTA and substantia nigra are crucial for reward-related cognition and serve as the central component of the reward system.The brain reward circuitry that <b>is</b> <b>targeted</b> by addictive drugs normally mediates the pleasure and strengthening of behaviors associated with natural reinforcers, such as food, water, and sexual contact. Dopamine neurons in the VTA are activated by food and water, and dopamine release in the NAc is stimulated by the presence of natural reinforcers, such as food, water, or a sexual partner....The NAc and VTA are central components of the circuitry underlying reward and memory of reward. As previously mentioned, the activity of dopaminergic neurons in the VTA appears to be linked to reward prediction. The NAc is involved in learning associated with reinforcement and the modulation of motoric responses to stimuli that satisfy internal homeostatic needs. The shell of the NAc appears to be particularly important to initial drug actions within reward circuitry; addictive drugs appear to have a greater effect on dopamine release in the shell than in the core of the NAc.... If motivational drive is described in terms of wanting, and hedonic evaluation in terms of liking, it appears that wanting can be dissociated from liking and that dopamine may influence these phenomena differently. Differences between wanting and liking are confirmed in reports by human addicts, who state that their desire for drugs (wanting) increases with continued use even when pleasure (liking) decreases because of tolerance.}} The function of dopamine varies in each axonal projection from the VTA and substantia nigra; for example, the VTA–nucleus accumbens shell projection assigns incentive salience ("want") to rewarding stimuli and its associated cues, the VTA–orbitofrontal cortex projection updates the value of different goals in accordance with their incentive salience, the VTA–amygdala and VTA–hippocampus projections mediate the consolidation of reward-related memories, and both the VTA–nucleus accumbens core and substantia nigra–dorsal striatum pathways are involved in learning motor responses that facilitate the acquisition of rewarding stimuli. Some activity within the VTA dopaminergic projections appears to be associated with reward prediction as well.|$|E
