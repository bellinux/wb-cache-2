5|$|Odd Horten is an overcautious 67-year-old {{man about}} to retire after forty {{years as a}} train driver on the route between Oslo and Bergen. As he awakes, he goes through a meticulous daily routine, as he prepares for his second-to-last time <b>driving</b> <b>the</b> <b>train</b> to Bergen. When he gets there, he makes small talk with Svea, who owns the {{boarding}} house where he stays when there and whom he now may never see again.|$|E
5|$|On 21 November, {{reinforcements}} {{had reached}} {{them and the}} decision was made to move the commandos to La Calle by rail. With only intermittent air cover, the train was attacked by German fighters and No. 6 Commando suffered heavy casualties with 11 killed and 32 wounded. After the train driver jumped from the engine, one of the commandos took over the duties of <b>driving</b> <b>the</b> <b>train.</b> The unit remained in La Calle until 26 November, during which time the commandos were used to unload stores from the ships in the port, while half the unit carried out a reconnaissance patrol near Tabarka, to determine whether the German tanks that were parked there were real or decoys.|$|E
25|$|Edison {{was active}} in {{business}} {{right up to the}} end. Just months before his death, the Lackawanna Railroad inaugurated suburban electric train service from Hoboken to Montclair, Dover, and Gladstone, New Jersey. Electrical transmission for this service was by means of an overhead catenary system using direct current, which Edison had championed. Despite his frail condition, Edison was at the throttle of the first electric MU (Multiple-Unit) train to depart Lackawanna Terminal in Hoboken in September 1930, <b>driving</b> <b>the</b> <b>train</b> the first mile through Hoboken yard on its way to South Orange.|$|E
5000|$|The two men of No 6 (Railwaymen's) Garrison Company {{responsible}} for <b>driving</b> <b>the</b> armoured <b>train</b> wore silver arm badges bearing a locomotive {{and the word}} 'DRIVER' and 'FIREMAN' ...|$|R
5000|$|The first, {{fourth and}} the fifth, eighth cars(if applicable)(i.e. <b>the</b> <b>driving</b> trailers) of <b>the</b> <b>train</b> in NSW TrainLink {{services}} are designated [...] "Quiet Carriages".|$|R
30|$|Both {{during their}} {{classroom}} <b>training,</b> and while <b>driving</b> <b>the</b> simulated <b>train,</b> <b>the</b> participants rehearsed various SOPs, including the procedure {{corresponding to the}} report of a suspicious item on <b>the</b> <b>train.</b> In real-life working conditions, all the participants had received the report of a suspicious item on <b>the</b> <b>train</b> at least once, with a maximum of six reports received by two participants.|$|R
25|$|Day-to-day {{operations}} will {{be handled}} rather {{like those of}} Docklands Light Railway, with service employees riding in some trains {{to watch out for}} disruptive passengers and unusual occurrences and to supply information to passengers. Unlike the DLR however, not every train will be accompanied by a service employee, and again unlike the DLR, service employees have no task in the actual operation of the train. Hence the grade of automation is mixed between GoA 3 - Driverless, and GoA 4 - Unattended Train Operation (UTO). Doors close automatically, supervised by light barriers and pressure-sensitive door edges. Only in the case of service disruptions will a service employee take over the task of <b>driving</b> <b>the</b> <b>train.</b> For this purpose, all service employees are fully trained drivers.|$|E
2500|$|A Court Inquiry {{was held}} into the crash, headed by Supreme Court of Queensland Judge, Sir Alan Mansfield, and {{attended}} by railway experts, several passengers and local witnesses. [...] The inquiry {{found that the}} driver had been rostered to drive a train on a line he had little knowledge of, and was <b>driving</b> <b>the</b> <b>train</b> with excessive speed.|$|E
2500|$|As {{early as}} 1926, the first CI trains were trialed. They were 18 meters long and were tested thoroughly, before {{production}} {{started with the}} CII and CIII types. On the outside, CII and CIII trains were identical, but they were very different on the inside. The electricity <b>driving</b> <b>the</b> <b>train</b> was routed directly through the steering in the CII ("Schaltwerksteuerung"), while the CIII used the safer [...] "Schützensteuerung" [...] (with only a weak control current running through the controls).|$|E
50|$|The {{elimination}} of cams, lifters, rockers, and timing set reduces not only weight and bulk, but also friction. A {{significant portion of}} the power that an engine actually produces is used up just <b>driving</b> <b>the</b> valve <b>train,</b> compressing all those valve springs thousands of times a minute.|$|R
50|$|On 21 June 1898, David Fenwick, engine driver, {{was killed}} whilst <b>driving</b> <b>the</b> Royal <b>Train</b> between Aberdeen and Perth. The inquest {{found that he}} had climbed onto the coal tender to attempt to resolve {{a problem with the}} {{communication}} cord, and was killed after an impact with a bridge.|$|R
40|$|Intrinsic Motivations (i. e motivations not {{connected}} to rewardrelated stimuli) drive humans and other biological agents to autonomously learn different skills in absence of any biological pressure or any assigned task. In this paper we investigate {{which is the best}} learning signal for <b>driving</b> <b>the</b> <b>training</b> of different tasks in a modular architecture controlling a simulated kinematic robotic arm that has to reach for different objects. We compare the performance of the system varying the Intrinsic Motivation signal and we show how a Task Predictor whose learning process is strictly connected to the competence of the system in the tasks is able to generate the most suitable signal for the autonomous learning of multiple skills...|$|R
2500|$|Time {{magazine}} {{praised the}} series, saying [...] "Forget sleeping through this one--you won't {{even want to}} blink. 24 is the most distinctive, addictive new TV series this season. As an old-fashioned thriller, it's relentless, tense and deliciously paranoiac, with more twists than a Twizzler. But it's also boldly different. Most notably, there's its clever visual signature: picture-in-picture screens that show two, three and even four different scenes simultaneously." [...] Time also noted that [...] "The show takes {{to the next level}} the trend of serial story 'arcs', which began with '80s dramas like Hill Street Blues and Wiseguy and which continues on The West Wing and The Sopranos." [...] Time also praised the performances of Kiefer Sutherland and Dennis Haysbert, saying that [...] "It helps that there's a strong cast <b>driving</b> <b>the</b> <b>train.</b> Haysbert is commanding, if a tad underutilized in the pilot, as an idealist with a dangerous secret. And Sutherland plays the gravel-voiced Bauer with an assurance that belies his teen-movie-star past; his overstressed agent is stalwart but weary, a haunted spook." ...|$|E
50|$|For through-operation, a train must be {{equipped}} with special trucks holding variable gauge wheelsets containing a variable gauge axle (VGA). The gauge is altered by <b>driving</b> <b>the</b> <b>train</b> through a gauge changer or gauge changing facility.|$|E
5000|$|The {{conversation}} {{over the}} air with [...] "Ralph" [...] while Michael Wincott's character [...] "Kent" [...] enters the studio consisting of [...] "Something is wrong... like nobody's <b>driving</b> <b>the</b> <b>train.</b> The system... there's too many people getting sick" [...] {{was used by the}} California punk band Lagwagon on the album Blaze.|$|E

50|$|A {{driving cab}} in the {{rearmost}} coach (known as an autocoach or auto trailer) has controls {{to allow the}} driver to operate the regulator, brake and whistle when <b>driving</b> <b>the</b> <b>train</b> 'in reverse'. The fireman would remain on the engine in order to stoke the fire and {{to take off the}} brakes, as the driver could only apply them.|$|E
50|$|Rack-and-adhesion systems use the cog drive only on {{the steepest}} {{sections}} and elsewhere operate as a regular railway. Others, the steeper ones, are rack-only. On the latter type, the locomotives' wheels are generally free-wheeling and despite appearances do not contribute to <b>driving</b> <b>the</b> <b>train.</b> In this case the racks continue also in the horizontal parts, if any.|$|E
25|$|Belcher died on December 1, 2012, in a murder-suicide, {{murdering his}} girlfriend, 22-year-old Kasandra Perkins, before <b>driving</b> to <b>the</b> Chiefs' <b>training</b> {{facility}} and shooting {{himself in the}} head with a handgun.|$|R
30|$|Observation {{of drivers}} was {{undertaken}} in the simulator, and in three cab rides on actual trains. Notes about train driving were taken, and three informal interviews were performed with train drivers, while they were <b>driving</b> <b>the</b> simulated <b>train,</b> and through observation of work during <b>the</b> <b>train</b> ride. <b>The</b> direct methods of talking to the drivers and watching them at work were used to conceptualise {{the issue in the}} problem domain [15], and as a means of framing the ensuing focus groups.|$|R
50|$|In January 2012, he had {{a traffic}} {{accident}} while <b>driving</b> to <b>the</b> <b>training</b> ground of his club, Gorica. Because of his injuries, {{he was unable to}} play for the whole year. On 24 September 2012, he signed for Maribor as a free agent. He returned on 10 March 2013 in a match against Olimpija, when he fully recovered from his injury.|$|R
50|$|The fireman <b>driving</b> <b>the</b> <b>train</b> {{was tired}} {{as he had}} {{finished}} his previous shift at 06:05 {{in the morning and}} had not slept well at the provided facilities at Tampere. Additionally, the engineer had begun brewing coffee just before arriving at Jyväskylä. He was then unable to warn his colleague about the overspeed before it was too late.|$|E
50|$|The Jyväskylä rail {{accident}} {{occurred on}} 6 March 1998 in Jyväskylä, Finland, when the Sr1-driven express train P105 from Turku bound for Joensuu via Pieksämäki derailed. The train left the tracks after coming in too fast on a 35 km/h switch near the station. 300 people were on board (some sources say 500); the fireman <b>driving</b> <b>the</b> <b>train</b> and nine passengers were killed, and 94 passengers injured.|$|E
50|$|The Voiture État à 2 étages {{were used}} as unseparable sets of {{carriages}} and used for réversibilité, <b>driving</b> <b>the</b> <b>train</b> from the end passenger car and the steam locomotive pushing, on the Réseau Saint-Lazare. They often operated once in the morning, taking commuters to work, and once in the evening, returning them back home. They were also briefly used on the Réseau Montparnasse in shorter sets of six cars.|$|E
5|$|If the {{undamaged}} part {{were the}} rear half of <b>the</b> <b>train,</b> {{this would be}} driven by <b>the</b> Chef du <b>Train,</b> who is a fully authorised driver and occupies <b>the</b> rear <b>driving</b> cab while <b>the</b> <b>train</b> travels through <b>the</b> tunnel for this purpose.|$|R
5000|$|In 1898 Walter Peart and Henry Dean {{were the}} driver and fireman of <b>the</b> Great Western <b>train</b> known as <b>the</b> Windsor Express. On 18 July 1898, they were <b>driving</b> <b>the</b> 4:15 <b>train</b> from Windsor to Paddington when, just outside Acton, the {{connecting}} rod broke. Part of it was driven through the boiler casing and caused damage to the firebox which overwhelmed the men with cinders, steam and fire. They succeeded in applying the brake and bringing <b>the</b> <b>train</b> to a safe standstill before leaving the engine at Acton station.|$|R
50|$|Trambesòs stop {{is located}} on Avinguda del Marquès de Mont-Roig, between Joaquim Ruyra and Pau Claris streets.
