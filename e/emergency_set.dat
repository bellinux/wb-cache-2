50|$|Stoker {{was cast}} in the role {{primarily}} because he was an actor with a Screen Actors Guild card, and a qualified firefighter specialist engineer able to drive and operate the fire engine. During the time Emergency! was in production, Stoker was an engineer at LACoFD Station 69 in Topanga Canyon, which is about 20 miles from Universal Studios, where the series was filmed. As an engineer, it was Stoker's responsibility to drive Engine 69 {{to the scene of}} the call, and operate Engine 69's pump to provide water to crews fighting the fire - exactly as his character did in the television series. Of the main characters, Stoker's was perhaps one of the least seen on camera, ostensibly due to his firefighting shift work schedule. However, he became the production's face for public safety, making several commercials for fire prevention and awareness, mostly shot on the <b>Emergency!</b> <b>set.</b>|$|E

The ship was powered by an eight-cylinder two-stroke diesel engine of the type Sulzer 8SD72-CRDA, which was built under license by Cantieri Riuniti dell'Adriatico in Trieste. Each cylinder had a bore of 720 mm and a stroke of 1250 mm. The engine's normal service rating was 5,600 hp at 125 rpm, driving a Karl Zeise right-hand four-bladed propeller of 4.8 m im diameter. The main engine was generally of standard Sulzer design of the crosshead type, with an independent scavenge pump to each cylinder. It was arranged for operation on heavy oil.

50|$|Hull {{form for}} the vessel was {{developed}} based on a semi displacement hard chine form, flared forward in combination of built in spray rail to further improve the vessel's performance and planing at high speeds. The hull was initially developed and designed by Tenix using hydrostatics software Maxsurf and later sent to the Maritime Research Institute (MARIN) for review, which confirmed the predicted performance of the vessel. Seakeeping features includes sustained speeds of 12 knots in Sea State 4. Hull is of all-welded construction with grade 250 steel with aluminum superstructure including flight deck. Stern door constructed of aluminum alloy to reduce weight. Main propulsion consists of two medium speed Caterpillar 3612, producing 4,060 bkW at 1,000 rpm mounted with a flexible coupling connecting the flywheel to a clutchable Reintjes LAF 3445 reduction gearbox, gearbox ratio 2.515:1. The gearbox is hard mounted with a horizontally offset output driving a shaft line connected to acbLips four-bladed (Hub 4D710D) controllable-pitch propeller. Each propulsion train and ancillary systems are capable of operating independently. Port reduction gearbox provides a power take-off connection for the fire monitor pump which are used alongside firefighting capability. Main engines and auxiliaries are fueled by 109,762 liters of diesel, sufficient for an operational range of 1,000 nm at speeds of 24 knots and 2,000 nm at speeds of 15 knots, both with 10% remaining fuel. Electrical power is supplied by two Caterpillar 3406 generators sets each provides 260 ekW located in the forward area of the engine room. The design allows for the complete electric power demand to be supplied with only one generator. Emergency Caterpillar 3306 harbor generator located at main deck aft provides 105 ekW in case of main generator failure. The <b>emergency</b> <b>set</b> is air cooled and configured for automatic startup on loss of the ships main power. Main engine room is protected with a carbon dioxide extinguishing system. Aqueous Film Forming Foam (AFFF) is provided for protection of the flight deck via a mixed foam tank and proportioners. Electronics includes Furuno GPS with Furuno ARPA 26 plotter, Furuno X and S band radars, Furuno depth sounder, Furuno 8000 GMDSS, Furuno Inmarsat B and C Satcom, Furuno FAX 2084 weatherfax, Tokimec 110GS gyrocompass and Tokimec PR 2213 autopilot. Flight deck located on the after end of the bridge deck can support a helicopter for airborne SAR or emergency evacuation, with a maximum weight of 4,672 kg (10,728 lb). Weapons hardpoints located at the bow can mount heavier caliber guns, which was specified by the PCG.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND Influenza viruses {{are common}} {{seasonal}} pathogens affecting the human respiratory system.

40|$|Background: Fingertip injury {{requiring}} flap {{cover is}} very common in the modern era. The ideal cover should fulfill both functional and aesthetic improvement. Materials and Methods: From June 2015 to April 2016, we performed seven free toe pulp flaps for finger defect reconstruction. All patients were males. Five flaps were done in emergency post-traumatic cases, and two were done in elective set up. The cases included reconstruction of three thumbs, one index and one ring finger in an <b>emergency</b> <b>set</b> up and two ring fingers in the elective. Thumb reconstruction was done with great toe lateral pulp and the other digits reconstructed with second toe pulp flap. Follow-up evaluation included both functional and aesthetic assessment. Results: Five flaps survived completely, one suffered partial loss, and one flap failed completely. The median follow-up period was 9 months. The median duration of surgery was 255 min (range 210 to 300 min). The median two-point discrimination was 6. 5 mm (range 4 – 8 mm). There was the return of temperature sensation in all patients; two had cold intolerance. The Semmes-Weinstein monofilament score varied from 3. 61 to 5. 07 (median filament index value 4. 31 /pressure value of 2 g/mm 2). Three patients had delayed donor site wound healing.

40|$|Background:  Patients who undergo {{emergency}} {{colorectal cancer}} surgery has poor outcome compared to elective surgery, {{both in terms}} of morbidity and mortality. Approximately 15 to 30 % of colorectal cancers present as an emergency, most often as obstruction or perforation. Objective:  To compare surgical outcome and clinical profiles of emergency and elective cases for colorectal cancer. Methods:  Retrospective analysis of 34 cases who underwent surgery for colorectal cancer between December 2011 to January 2013 was carried out and their surgical outcomes, clinical presentation, demographic profile were analyzed. Results:  The total numbers of patients included in this study were 34. Out of which 52. 94 %(n= 18) were emergency cases and 47. 05 %(n= 16) were elective. Male female ratio was 3 : 1 in emergency cases and 2. 6 : 1 in elective cases. Per rectal bleeding (56 %) and altered bowel habit (31. 25 %) was predominant clinical presentation in elective cases whereas intestinal obstruction (55. 55 %) and peritonitis (22. 22 %) were predominant clinical presentation in emergency cases. In emergency cases most of the tumors were located in left side (77. 77 %) and in elective cases rectum was common site (37. 5 %). Left hemicolectomy was the commonest surgery performed (72. 22 %) in <b>emergency</b> <b>set</b> up. In elective cases, right hemicolectomy, left hemicolectomy, APR and LAR was done in 31. 25 %, 31. 25 %, 25 % and 25 % cases respectively. In the emergency group 11. 11 % (n= 2) developed enterocutaneous fistula and early mortality within 30 days was observed in 5 % (n= 1) of emergency cases only. Conclusion:  In emergency conditions, colorectal cancer presented with intestinal obstruction where as elective cases presented with per rectal bleeding and altered bowel habits. Compared with the elective patients, the emergency patients had higher rate of morbidity and mortality. Because of higher incidence of colorectal cancer in our institution, in all emergency cases who presents with features of intestinal obstruction and peritonitis, we have to rule out colorectal cancer especially if the patients are elderly. Therefore, we should encourage screening programme for early detection of colorectal cancers for better outcome of surgery.
