5|$|The {{design was}} adopted by an Act of Parliament in 1813, which {{permitted}} the commissioners to borrow £600,000 for building and construction. The street was intended to have commercial purposes and {{it was expected that}} a majority of the income would come from private capital. Nash took responsibility for design and valuation of all properties. Construction of the road resulted in demolishing numerous properties, disrupting trade and polluting the air with dust. Existing tenants had first offer to purchase leases on the new properties. The Treasury supported the proposal because, in the aftermath of the lengthy Napoleonic Wars, there was an urgent need for the government to create jobs. Government expenditure was low because the design relied heavily upon private developers, such as Nash himself. The buildings were to be let on 99-year leases, as was common at the time, and income could be recouped in the form of <b>ground</b> <b>rent.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{road was}} {{designed}} as part of Pentonville, a new suburb away from the City and became a local hub for manufacturing in the area. There was some debate over the final route of the road; the original plan to run straight through fields owned by the Skinners Company and the New River Company was rejected in favour of the route further north via Battle Bridge. As it was always {{intended to be a}} main road, a coach service began in 1798 between Paddington and Bank but was quickly withdrawn. The road was turnpiked in 1830 and renamed Pentonville Road after landowner Henry Penton in 1857. Until 1882, the upkeep of the road was paid by the local parish, paying a <b>ground</b> <b>rent</b> to Penton's estate for the disused toll house at No.274.|$|E
25|$|When the Treaty of Nanking {{was signed}} in 1842 between Britain and China, the Portuguese {{government}} requested the Qing government to exempt them from the <b>ground</b> <b>rent.</b> The Qing authorities refused the request, but retained the preferentials that were already given to Portugal. However, on 20 November 1845, Maria II of Portugal unilaterally declared Macau a free port in which Portugal was exempt from <b>ground</b> <b>rent</b> and allowed merchant vessels of other countries to interact freely in Macau. After the new Governor of Macau, João Ferreira do Amaral, arrived in 1846, a series of colonial policies were enforced in Macau. In May 1846, Amaral demanded that all Chinese residents in Macau pay <b>ground</b> <b>rent,</b> poll tax and property tax, which broadened Portuguese rule in Macau over the Chinese residents. The Qing authorities in Macau immediately protested against Amaral's action and attempted to negotiate. However, beginning in 1849, Amaral expelled all Qing officials from Macau, destroyed the Qing Customs and stopped paying <b>ground</b> <b>rent</b> to the Qing government. Amaral's actions enraged the Chinese residents further, and he was assassinated on 22 August 1849.|$|E

The actor-manager John Philip Kemble, raised seat prices to help recoup the cost of rebuilding {{and the cost of}} an increased <b>ground</b> <b>rent</b> introduced by the landowner, the Duke of Bedford, but the move was so unpopular that audiences disrupted performances by beating sticks, hissing, booing and dancing.

25|$|Profit {{income from}} {{ordinary}} land sales, for example, {{is not included}} in official value-added, since land transactions do not result in additional land (See also gross fixed capital formation, differential and absolute <b>ground</b> <b>rent</b> and land grabbing). Official fixed capital aggregates exclude the value of land, and no very reliable official estimates exist for the value of land, because of problems with credibly valuing land in a standard way for measurement purposes. If the world market prices for farm products rise, profit rates on land sales and commercial land values will increase; even if the number of land sales stays constant, the profit on land sales will increase.|$|E
25|$|William Stanford the younger's {{complicated}} will {{prevented the}} selling of freehold building land but a subsequent Act of Parliament, the 1871 Stanford Estate Act, allowed Ellen to grant building agreements with the option to purchase the freehold within seven years at a price equivalent to the <b>ground</b> <b>rent</b> for twenty-five years, {{clearing the way for}} the transformation of the Stanford estate from agricultural lands to building sites. To offset the sale of land in Brighton, the Stanford estate trustees acquired freeholds in Wiltshire, Sussex, Middlesex and Croydon and leaseholds in London. In 1891 Vere and Ellen persuaded the trustees of the Stanford Estate to purchase his family's estates at Pythouse and Norton Bavant in Wiltshire. The profit made from this transaction enabled Vere and Ellen to purchase a yacht and a property on the island of Madeira called Quinta Vigia, where they began spending the winter months for the sake of Vere's health. He died there in 1894.|$|E

500|$|In 1863, William Burges gained {{his first}} major {{architectural}} commission, Saint Fin Barre's Cathedral, Cork, {{at the age of}} 35. In the following twelve years, his architecture, metalwork, jewellery, furniture and stained glass led Crook to claim that Burges rivaled Pugin as [...] "the greatest art-architect of the Gothic Revival". But by 1875, his short career was largely over. Although he worked to finalise earlier projects, he received no further major commissions, and the design, construction, decoration and furnishing of the Tower House occupied much of the last six years of his life. In December 1875, after rejecting plots in Victoria Road, Kensington and Bayswater, Burges purchased the leasehold of the plot in Melbury Road from the Earl of Ilchester, the owner of the Holland Estate. The <b>ground</b> <b>rent</b> was £100 per annum. Initial drawings for the house had been undertaken in July 1875 and the final form was decided upon {{by the end of the}} year. Building began in 1876, contracted to the Ashby Brothers of Kingsland Road at a cost of £6,000.|$|E

China retained sovereignty and Chinese residents were subject to Chinese law, but the territory was under Portuguese administration.

2500|$|After {{an initial}} meeting at Trinity College, the Provost of the College banned any further meeting on campus. Dunlop {{had to find}} a new home for his {{sporting}} endeavours. Writing in 1921, Dunlop stated: [...] "I was therefore forced to look for another plot, and after careful consideration chose the present Lansdowne Road one. In conjunction with the late Edward Dillon (my trainer), I took a 69 year lease from the Pembroke Estate, paying a <b>ground</b> <b>rent</b> of £60 per annum, of part only of the premises stretching from the railway to about 60 yards from the Dodder. I laid down a cinder running path of a quarter-mile, laid down the present Lansdowne Tennis Club ground with my own theodolite, started a Lansdowne archery club, a Lansdowne cricket club, and last, but not least, the Lansdowne Rugby Football Club - colours red, black and yellow. On the tennis club grounds the first tennis championship was held long before Fitzwilliam meetings." ...|$|E
2500|$|Proudhon {{originated}} mutualism, an anarchist {{school of}} thought, envisioning {{a society where}} each person might possess a means of production, either individually or collectively, with trade representing equivalent amounts of labor in the free market. Integral to the scheme was {{the establishment of a}} mutual-credit bank which would lend to producers at an interest rate only high enough to cover the costs of administration. Mutualism is based on a labor theory of value which holds that when labor or its product is sold, in exchange, it ought to receive goods or services embodying [...] "the amount of labor necessary to produce an article of exactly similar and equal utility". Some mutualists believe that if the state did not intervene, as a result of increased competition in the marketplace, individuals would receive no more income than that in proportion to the amount of labor they exert. Mutualists oppose the idea of individuals receiving income through loans, investments, and rent, as they believe these individuals are not laboring. Some of them argue that if state intervention ceased, these types of incomes would disappear due to increased competition in capital. Though Proudhon opposed this type of income, he expressed: [...] "... I never meant to ... forbid or suppress, by sovereign decree, <b>ground</b> <b>rent</b> and interest on capital. I believe that all these forms of human activity should remain free and optional for all." ...|$|E
