40|$|We {{examine the}} {{dynamics}} of stellar systems embedded within cold dark matter (CDM) halos {{in order to assess}} observational constraints on the dark matter content of Local Group dwarf spheroidals (dSphs). Approximating the stellar and dark components by King and NFW models, respectively, we identify the parameters of dark halos consistent with the kinematics and spatial distribution of stars in dSphs as well as with cosmological N-body simulations. Our analysis shows, in agreement with previous work, that the total mass within the luminous radius is reasonably well constrained and approximately independent of the luminosity of the dwarf, highlighting the poor correspondence between luminosity and halo mass at the extremely faint end of the luminosity function. This result implies that the average density of dark matter is substantially higher in physically small systems such as Draco and Sculptor than in larger systems such as Fornax. Because massive CDM halos are denser than low mass ones at all radii, these results imply that Draco formed in a halo 5 times more massive than Fornax’s despite being roughly 70 times <b>fainter.</b> <b>Stellar</b> velocity dispersion profiles (σp(R)) provide further constraints; in systems where data exist, σp(R) remains flat almost to the nominal “tidal ” radius, implying that stars are deeply embedded within their cold dark matter halo...|$|E

The red giant branch tip occurs at i' = 23. 6 +/- 0. 1 in NGC 2403, and the Cepheid and RGB-tip distance scales for this galaxy are in good agreement. While very young stars are restricted to radii < 10 kpc along {{the plane of the}} disk, a population of bright asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars is present out to r = 20 kpc, indicating that star formation occured outside of the present-day star-forming disk of NGC 2403 during intermediate epochs. The AGB stars are not in a tidal stream; in fact, the ratio of AGB stars above the RGB-tip to those below the RGB-tip does not change with radius, indicating that the bright AGB stars are uniformly mixed with the <b>fainter</b> <b>stellar</b> content throughout the field. A similar population of bright AGB stars is detected in the outer regions of M 33, and the ratio of bright AGB stars to stars on the upper RGB is at least as large as that measured in the outer regions of NGC 2403; thus, an intermediate-age population occurs well outside of the young star-forming disk of M 33.

We estimate that halos would need to lose more than 90 % of their original mass before tides begin affecting the kinematics of stars. We estimate that V_max is about 3 times higher than the central velocity dispersion of the stars, which alleviates significantly the CDM ``substructure crisis''. We use these results to interpret the size differences between the M 31 and Milky Way (MW) dSph population. Our modeling indicates that this difference should be reflected in their kinematics, and predicts that M 31 dwarfs should have velocity dispersions up to a factor of ~ 2 higher than their MW counterparts. This CDM-motivated prediction may be verified with present observational capabilities. Comment: ApJ accepted. Additional figure and extended discussion adde...|$|E

From observations, the nature of several <b>faint</b> <b>stellar</b> systems in the Milky Way halo is not clear, therefore, I quantify the contribution of star clusters to the <b>faint</b> <b>stellar</b> systems population. (ii) Probe the underlying DM density of their host galaxy. I apply a new method to the recently discovered Eridanus~II ultra-faint dwarf galaxy that hosts a star cluster in its centre.

40|$|Many {{groups are}} trying to find <b>faint</b> <b>stellar</b> companions using a variety of techniques. The most obvious is to take long {{exposure}} pictures. Here adaptive optics (AO) is useful in correcting the blurring effects of the atmosphere. Starlight is concentrated into a tighter peak and less energy is put into the surrounding halo. Another method is to look for periodic decreases in a star's irradiance due to a planet blocking some of the light as it crosses in front of the star or transits. The most productive technique so far has been to look for periodic doppler shifts in the light coming from a candidate star, i. e. radial velocity searches. Several large planets have been found this way. This dissertation explores aspects of these three methods. The ability to detect a companion amid noise depends on the properties of the noise. While theoretical expectations exist for the properties of the halo produced by an AO system, experimental studies are few. The temporal and spatial characteristics of the halo produced by the AO system at the Starfire Optical Range are explored from the viewpoint of searching for <b>faint</b> <b>stellar</b> companions. We set limiting companion magnitudes for stars imaged while searching for brown dwarfs. The primary limitation to ground based transit searches is scintillation, irradiance fluctuations due to atmospheric turbulence. We explore reduction of this noise via differencing signals from binary stars. Theory is extended to include temporal and angular separation effects simultaneously. Evaluation of the derived equations and simulations demonstrate the benefits and limitations. Finally the design of an echelle spectrograph for use on the 6. 5 m MMT or the Magellan telescope that is well suited to radial velocity searches for planets is presented. It has throughput between 10 % and 18 %, resolution of 200, 000 per pixel and can sample the entire 0. 31 to 1. 1 μm range at once. This is accomplished by avoiding metallic reflections whenever possible and by using a mosaic of CCDs fit to the curved focal surface of a Schmidt camera. Efficient simultaneous observation of many spectral lines makes this a powerful instrument for radial velocity companion searches...|$|R

40|$|The <b>faint</b> <b>stellar</b> halos {{of galaxies}} contain key {{information}} about the oldest stars {{and the process of}} galaxy formation. A previous study of stacked SDSS images of disk galaxies has revealed a halo with an abnormally red r−i colour, seemingly inconsistent with our current understanding of the stellar populations inhabiting stellar halos. Measurements of this type are however plagued by large uncertainties which calls for follow-up studies. Here, we investigate the statistical properties of the faint envelopes of low surface brightness disk galaxies to look for further support for a red excess. A total of 1510 nearly edge-on, bulgeless low surface brightness galaxies were selected from the SDSS Data Release 5, rescaled to the same apparent size, aligned and stacked. This procedure allows us to reach a surface brightness of µr ∼ 31 mag arcsec− 2. After a careful assessment of instrumental light scattering effects in the stacked images, we derive median and average radial surface brightness and colour profiles in g, r and i.

New Spitzer mid-infrared observations at 3. 6, 4. 5, 5. 8, 8. 0, 15 and 24 µm show that young SF is restricted to the southern part of the cloud. Despite the relatively uniform H 2 and Hi column density across the cloud, young SF occurs only in those regions where the velocity dispersion in the CO and Hi is a factor o...|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} {{discovery}} of a new ultra-faint globular cluster in the constellation of Ursa Minor, based on stellar photometry from the MegaCam imager at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT). We find that this cluster, Munoz 1, is located at a distance of 45 +/- 5 kpc and at a projected distance of only 45 arcmin {{from the center of the}} Ursa Minor dSph galaxy. Using a Maximum Likelihood technique we measure a half-light radius of 0. 5 arcmin, or equivalently 7 pc and an ellipticity consistent with being zero. We estimate its absolute magnitude to be M_V=- 0. 4 +/- 0. 9, which corresponds to L_V= 120 (+ 160, - 65) L_sun and we measure a heliocentric radial velocity of - 137 +/- 4 km/s based on Keck/DEIMOS spectroscopy. This new satellite is separate from Ursa Minor by ~ 30 kpc and 110 km/s suggesting the cluster is not obviously associated with the dSph, despite the very close angular separation. Based on its photometric properties and structural parameters we conclude that Munoz 1 is a new ultra-faint stellar cluster. Along with Segue 3 this is one of the <b>faintest</b> <b>stellar</b> clusters known to date. Comment: Accepted for publication in ApJ Letter...|$|R
40|$|According to {{a popular}} {{scenario}} supported by numerical models, the mass assembly and growth of massive galaxies, in particular the Early-Type Galaxies (ETGs), is, below a redshift of 1, mainly due to the accretion of multiple gas [...] poor satellites. In order to get observational evidence of {{the role played by}} minor dry mergers, we are obtaining extremely deep optical images of a complete volume limited sample of nearby ETGs. These observations, done with the CFHT as part of the, NGVS and MATLAS projects, reach a stunning 28. 5) 29 mag. arcsec- 2 surface brightness limit in the g' band. They allow us to detect the relics of past collisions such as <b>faint</b> <b>stellar</b> tidal tails as well as the very extended stellar halos which keep the memory of the last episodes of galactic accretion. Images and preliminary results from this on-going survey are presented, in particular a possible correlation between the fine structure index (which parametrizes the amount of tidal perturbation) of the ETGs, their stellar mass, effective radius and gas content.
