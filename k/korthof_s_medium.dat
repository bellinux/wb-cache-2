Replanting saline areas using salt-tolerant, or halophytic, species is one method of reclaiming this land. This project investigated the possibility of using in vitro methods to select for increased salt tolerance in halophytic plants. By establishing clonal lines of halophytes in culture and screening those clones for cells exhibiting variation in their capacity to tolerate salt, {{it may be possible to}} regenerate plants with elevated salt tolerance. Clonal lines of six species of A triplex (saltbushes) were obtained. Two clones each of A. amnicola and A. cinerea, and one clone of A. nummularia were established as shoot cultures. Explants were induced to form multiple shoots or roots in tissue culture, by the addition of 1 μM of the cytokinins kinetin or 2 iP, or the auxins NAA, IAA or IBA to M 2 ̆ 6 <b>S</b> basal <b>medium.</b> Callus was readily initiated from leaves of A. nummularia, by the use of M 2 ̆ 6 <b>S</b> <b>medium</b> containing 9 - 18 μM NAA or IAA, and 9 μM kinetin or 2 iP.

They find {{no relationship between}} the movements in prices of Egyptian long and extra-long cottons and prices for the base quality of U. <b>S.</b> <b>medium</b> staple cotton traded on the New York futures market. (Probably because Egyptian cotton prices are government-determined, U. <b>S.</b> <b>medium</b> staple cotton prices are influenced by price support policies unrelated to the longer staple markets, and the fiber of the cottons analyzed have different physical characteristics.) So, the New York cotton futures market's No. 2 contract is not an appropriate mechanism for hedging the price risk facing Egyptian cotton under present procedures for determining prices - and probably not under market-determined prices. If the cotton market in Egypt is liberalized, cotton prices there may correlate more with prices elsewhere - especially for the longer staple cottons. The authors extend their regression analysis to the prices of other medium staple cottons - Australian, Central Asian, Mexican, Pakistani, and Turkish - to determine how they behave relative to U. <b>S.</b> <b>medium</b> staple cotton prices. None of these prices had short-term movements closely related to U. S. cotton prices, indicating mainly the influence of domestic policies on the U. S. market. Again, the New York futures No. 2 contract {{does not provide a}} satisfactory hedge for these cottons. The cotton futures contract recently introduced in New York (world cotton contract) - based on the Cotlook A Index - may prove useful for hedging the price risk for some cottons (especially Australian, Central Asian, and Pakistani) but apparently not Egyptian cotton. The authors recommend (together with privatizing the industry) establishing a domestic spot market to give transparency to the price-forming process. When the spot market is functioning well, establishing a foward market could provide a hedging instrument for Egyptian cotton.

As the brine obtained by this process contains coinparatively large quantities of sulphates and other ingredients, it is unavoidable that they should cause much trouble in the production of pure salt. While both physical and chemical methods are in use for the purification of the brine, we have never been. informed of the application of any biological process to it.

Next, the writer confir med the presence of the desired halophilic bacteria not only in every sample of solar salt from Taiwan, Tsingtau in China but also in a sample of Japanese brine from Funabashi. The durability of these bacteria in salt solution is so great that it can certainly develop in van Delden 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>medium,</b> which contains twenty five percent. of sodium chloride, tinder anaerobic conditions.

It seems that the best culture media for embryonic development and cell cleavage is the natural composition which surrounds the oocyte which has been used occasionally in human IVF programs. For further investigation of effects of natural media composition of human follicular fluid (HFF) on embryo development, we compared the biochemical constituents of HFF with synthetic serum substitute (3 S) and their effects on embryo development and cell cleavage. From a total of 40 women with unexplained infertility, who attended for intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) in IVF center of Mirzakoochak Khan Hospital, we collected the HFF during oocyte pick-up in operation room.
