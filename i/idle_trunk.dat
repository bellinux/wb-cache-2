25|$|Calls from manual {{offices to}} panel offices {{required}} the A board, or outgoing operator, to request the number from the caller, connect to an <b>idle</b> <b>trunk</b> {{to the distant}} exchange and relay the desired number to the B Board Manual Incoming Call operator, who keyed it to the Panel machine for setting up the incoming and final frames to the called telephone number.|$|E
25|$|A second {{common form}} of {{signaling}} for supervision was called single-frequency or SF signaling. The most {{common form of}} this used a steady 2,600Hz tone to identify a trunk as <b>idle.</b> <b>Trunk</b> circuitry hearing a 2,600Hz tone for a certain duration would go idle. (The duration requirement reduced falsing.) Some systems used tone frequencies over 3,000Hz, particularly on SSB frequency division multiplex microwave radio relays.|$|E

50|$|During the 1960s, in-band {{signaling}} was used, so {{the same line}} for both voice conversations and telephone connection management signals. Since a pause in a voice conversation would produce silence, another method was required for switches to determine available circuits. The solution AT&T created was to produce a 2600 Hz tone on <b>idling</b> <b>trunks.</b>|$|R
50|$|An {{outgoing}} marker, being {{a complex}} control instrument {{with a short}} holding time, had the additional task of decoding the first three digits of the seven-digit telephone number to determine the routing to a distant exchange. A cross connect field had a terminal for each office code, which was cross connected to the coil of a route relay. When the office code point was grounded, it operated the route relay, whose contacts were wired in another cross connect or data field. Thus, the outgoing marker could select two office frames to search for <b>idle</b> <b>trunks</b> to the destination, and had pulsing information for the sender. The sender sent the telephone number to the distant terminating office. When one office was constructed, retired, or changed, staff in other offices received a Routing Letter, ordering the cross connect fields to be changed at a particular date and time, usually after midnight, to accommodate {{the change in the}} network. Translation cross connect fields such as these {{were among the first to}} be converted from soldered terminals to wire wrap.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Idle</b> {{outgoing}} <b>trunks</b> {{were picked}} {{by the traditional}} [...] "sleeve test" [...] method, as lines were, except that hunting was the usual practice for trunks rather than a special service feature. The selector moved upward to the proper trunk group, and then through twenty terminals, checking for one with an un-grounded sleeve lead, then selecting and grounding it. If all the trunks were busy, the selector sent back an All Circuits Busy tone (reorder tone). [...] There was no provision for alternate routing as in earlier manual systems and later more sophisticated mechanical ones.|$|R

5000|$|It gained brief fame as {{the last}} place in the {{continental}} United States to use a trunking system (inter-office circuits) that was called [...] "N2 Carrier", an analog system that utilized Multi-Frequency (MF) tones and the infamous 2600 Hz control tone for answer supervision and <b>idle</b> <b>trunk</b> condition. This system was much loved by phone phreaks {{as it was the}} same system which the now infamous John Draper made famous. The era ended in June 2006, when the privately owned exchange switched to a digital trunk. Phone hacking attempts from across the nation had placed a large burden on the extremely small telephone company serving the township.|$|E
50|$|Thanks to {{this more}} complex trunk circuit, {{outgoing}} trunks are selected by a quicker and more versatile method than the sleeve test previously used. Each trunk circuit provides a ground on an FT lead to indicate idleness. The FT leads for trunks {{in a particular}} group are cross-connected to a FTC (frame test common) lead for its trunk link frame, {{to indicate that the}} TLF has one or more idle trunks in that group. The route relay in the completing marker connects sensor relays to all the trunk link frames, allowing the marker to choose a TLF that has an <b>idle</b> <b>trunk</b> and then connect to that trunk through the trunk link connector (TLC) to choose one of those idle trunks. This two step method, along with the mixing of incoming and outgoing traffic, distributed traffic more evenly, thus alleviating the link congestion problems that often arose with earlier methods that restricted a trunk group to one or two outgoing switch frames.|$|E
50|$|For example, if police {{communications}} are configured {{in such a}} {{way that}} twelve conventional channels are required to permit citywide dispatch based upon geographical patrol areas, during periods of slow dispatch activity, much of that channel capacity is <b>idle.</b> In a <b>trunked</b> system, the police units in a given geographical area are not assigned a dedicated channel, but instead are members of a talk-group entitled to draw upon the common resources of a smaller pool of channels.|$|R
