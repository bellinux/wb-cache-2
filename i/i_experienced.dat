He provoked opposition by ruling without Parliament from 1629 to 1640, unilaterally levying taxes and adopting controversial religious policies (many of which were offensive to the Scottish Presbyterians and the English Puritans). His attempt to enforce Anglicanism led to organised rebellion in Scotland (the [...] "Bishops' Wars") and ignited the Wars of the Three Kingdoms. In 1642, the conflict between the King and English Parliament reached its climax and the English Civil War began.|$|E

[...] "Esta Noche" [...] is a pop/funk track with reggae influences. [...] "A Más No Poder" [...] has sexual connotations in its lyrics and as stated by Ángel Rodríguez of ADN Informativo, [...] "brings back memories when Guzmán was produced by Miguel Blasco in the 90's". [...] "Mi Debilidad" [...] is a pop/rock song, while [...] "No Puedo Parar" [...] is a heavy metal track.

About the songs included, Guzmán stated to Tabasco Hoy: [...] "In recent years <b>I</b> <b>experienced</b> many good and bad things, so I thought, why not transform them into songs.

Several people at the network enjoyed it and commissioned The Edge, a sketch comedy show also written by Mirkin and Brown, with Mirkin directing. NBC opted against production, but Fox ran it from 1992 to 1993. Mirkin had long wished to produce a sketch show, and designed The Edge to be [...] "fast-paced" [...] and [...] "some skits overlap, end abruptly or are broken into segments", {{in order to maintain}} attention. The Edge was a ratings success and was supported by the network. Mirkin considered it [...] "the first time <b>I</b> <b>experienced</b> the feeling of having a hit that I created. It just kept building and growing." [...] The show's material often inflamed its targets, particularly producer Aaron Spelling. Spelling objected to a sketch mocking his series Beverly Hills, 90210, another Fox show, and its lead actress Tori Spelling, who is his daughter. He demanded a public apology and that no further episodes contain the parody, threatening to sue. The show's production company TriStar Television refused, while Mirkin responded: [...] "The thing about these parodies is they don't hurt a show. It's only cross-promotion. The viewers who like the show always come back the next week. What's upsetting to me is it shows absolutely that Mr. Spelling has no sense of humor." [...] Mirkin left his role as executive producer of The Edge during its run. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported that Mirkin had been [...] "forced off the show", due to the negative reaction of Spelling and others, though in 2012, Mirkin stated that he left the series after refusing to accept a substantially reduced budget. The show's producers Sony failed to persuade him to stay but he returned to the series to produce its final [...] "Best Of" [...] compilation.|$|E
