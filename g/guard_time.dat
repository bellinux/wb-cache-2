40|$|Traditionally, slotted {{communication}} protocols have employed <b>guard</b> <b>times</b> to delineate and align slots. These <b>guard</b> <b>times</b> may expand the slot duration significantly, especially when clocks {{are allowed to}} drift for longer time to reduce clock synchronization overhead. Recently, {{a new class of}} lightweight protocols for statistical estimation in wireless sensor networks have been proposed. This new class requires very short transmission durations (jam signals), thus the traditional approach of using <b>guard</b> <b>times</b> would impose significant overhead. We propose a new, more efficient algorithm to align slots. Based on geometrical properties of space, we prove that our approach bounds the slot duration by only a constant factor of what is needed. Furthermore, we show by simulation that this bound is loose and an even smaller slot duration is required, making our approach even more efficient. I...|$|R
40|$|In Radio Packet Network (RPN), {{unconstrained}} transmission {{may lead}} to collision {{of two or more}} packets. Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) protocol is a common used protocol to schedule collision-free transmission for such networks. TDMA transmission allows a number of users to access a single radio channel without interference by allocating unique time slots to each user. In TDMA network, time is divided into frames and a frame consists of time slots. For networks where each node is a neighbor for all the other nodes, each node should assign a different time slot in TDMA frame to transmit in it to have collision-free transmission. Typically, those time slots are ended by <b>guard</b> <b>times</b> for propagation delays. Those <b>guard</b> <b>times</b> are fixed for all time slots regardless the actual needed propagation delays. In this paper, we propose a topology-dependent algorithm that automatically schedules collision-free channel access and specify the time instant when a node is to send a packet. We use variable <b>guard</b> <b>times,</b> instead of the fixed ones, calculated using the actual needed propagation delays between sources and destinations. We show that with such scheduling algorithm, a 90...|$|R

30|$|We {{begin our}} {{analysis}} with the FSA protocol {{which is used}} by both FSASeq and BLSync protocols. This is followed by developing expressions for the time slots required to read all tags when using the FSASeq and BLSync protocols. We will subsequently compare these two based {{on the amount of}} overlapped tags between readers and the type of tag distribution in the layout under consideration. The analysis in this section {{does not take into account}} the use of <b>guard</b> <b>times</b> in protocol timing to handle time synchronization errors. We present those results in the following section where we compare FSASeq to BLSync for practical deployments. Further, we ignore the relatively small time taken by the readers to transmit query bits as explained in Section 3.4 as well. Our notion of time to identify all tags only looks at the number of time slots required. We will consider the time to send query bits when we modify our results to include <b>guard</b> <b>times</b> in the following section.|$|R
5000|$|Hayes had {{initially}} filed {{for a patent}} on the electronic design of the Smartmodem in June 1981. In September 1983 they purchased a patent from Dr. Eaton of Bizcomp for $2 million, which included both a circuit design {{as well as a}} description of an escape sequence to trigger it. Hayes then updated the patent and re-filed it, this time including a lengthy abstract that focused entirely on the <b>guard</b> <b>time</b> and escape sequence, something that was mentioned only in passing in the original version. They received patent #4,549,302 in October 1985, Modem With Improved Escape Sequence With <b>Guard</b> <b>Time</b> Mechanism, commonly known as the [...] "Hayes '302 patent" [...] or the [...] "Heatherington patent".

50|$|For {{makers of}} {{low-cost}} modems, the $1 license fee represented a significant cost. A {{number of such}} manufacturers banded together {{to come up with}} a new system that avoided the patent, introducing TIES in 1991. TIES was written and freely given to the market in 1992 by Floyd Kling, then Engineering Manager of Ven-Tel Inc. Since the patent was based on the <b>guard</b> <b>time</b> concept, the new system had to be based solely on the string itself.

50|$|TDMA systems must {{carefully}} synchronize {{the transmission}} times {{of all the}} users {{to ensure that they}} are received in the correct time slot and do not cause interference. Since this cannot be perfectly controlled in a mobile environment, each time slot must have a <b>guard</b> <b>time,</b> which reduces the probability that users will interfere, but decreases the spectral efficiency. Similarly, FDMA systems must use a guard band between adjacent channels, due to the unpredictable Doppler shift of the signal spectrum because of user mobility. The guard bands will reduce the probability that adjacent channels will interfere, but decrease the utilization of the spectrum.|$|E
