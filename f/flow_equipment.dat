30|$|Within the {{laboratory}} domain, Xiao et al. used two microbial strains to remove paraffin deposits on stainless steel surfaces (Xiao et al. 2012). Those were Pseudomonas Aeruginosa (N 2) and Bacillus Licheniformis (KB 18). They {{were able to}} draw the conclusion that biosurfactant-producing species can change the wettability of stainless steel to water wet and reduce the adhesion of the aqueous phase to the stainless steel by forming an emulsion. This mechanism may be of paramount importance to preventing the paraffin deposition. These studies reached very promising results in what concerns the process efficiency. In fact, the paraffin removal efficiency accomplished by bacterial treatment could reach 79.0 %. Previously, Lazar et al. composed a special bacterial consortium, by isolating and selecting naturally occurring bacterial strains and bacterial consortia from waste hydrocarbon-contaminated sites, {{with which they were}} able to remove solid and semi-solid paraffin depositions on <b>flow</b> <b>equipment</b> (Lazar et al. 1999).|$|E
40|$|From {{studies of}} the {{oxygenation}} rate of red blood cells (RBC) using rapid-mix techniques, {{it has been suggested}} that RBC are surrounded by a stagnant layer of water that does not (or cannot) mix with the rest of the water. A consideration of the appropriate hydrodynamics and convective diffusion rates shows that a mixer can reduce the resolution time to approximately 1 ms (or possibly less) and give a diffusion layer around the TBC that is approximately 1 micron thick. In stopped <b>flow</b> <b>equipment</b> it expands to approximately 4 micron over approximately 10 ms, whereas in continuous flow work the diffusion layers expands slightly less rapidly and less far. Thus the rate of oxygenation of TBC should be slower when measured by stopped flow techniques than by continuous flow apparatus for which the rate will depend weakly on the Reynolds number of the flow in the interrogation tube...|$|E

30|$|Values of k_O_ 3, M {{obtained}} by stopped flow are twice the values {{obtained by}} competitive kinetics for both steroids; {{this can be}} due to the fate that competitive kinetics is subject to a reference compound, in this study sodium phenolate, which competes with the steroid for consumption of ozone. However, in the stopped <b>flow</b> <b>equipment,</b> only the steroids react with ozone. In addition, competitive kinetics is subject to the effectiveness of analytical methods to determine the residual steroids. In contrast, with the stopped flow method, the concentration of steroids is directly determined from the equipment {{at the same time the}} reaction occurs. Another difference among the methods is that reaction time in competitive kinetics is calculated, however in the stopped flow, it is displayed in real time and only depends on the concentrations of the residual steroid. Thus, the advantage of using the stopped flow methodology is the certitude in the generation of absorbance data at the same time while the reaction happens.|$|E
