5|$|An active {{vibration}} control system, {{known as the}} active control of structural response system, reduces airframe vibration by up to 80% which increases crew comfort and minimises the buildup of stress on the airframe. The cockpit is fitted with armoured seats for the crew, and can withstand an impact velocity of over 10m/s. Dual <b>flight</b> <b>controls</b> are provided, though the AW101 can be flown by a single person. The pilots' instrument displays include six full-colour high-definition screens and an optional mission display; a digital map or forward looking infrared (FLIR) display can also be installed.|$|E
5|$|For the {{avionics}} {{and weapons}} qualification {{phase of the}} flight testing, PT-04 was fitted with a fourth-generation avionics suite that incorporates sensor fusion, an electronic warfare suite, enhanced man-machine interface, Digital Electronic Engine Control (DEEC) for the RD-93 turbofan engine, FBW <b>flight</b> <b>controls,</b> day/night precision surface attack capability, and multi-mode, pulse-Doppler radar for BVR air-to-air attack capability.

5|$|In {{addition}} to normal <b>flight</b> <b>controls,</b> the Harrier has a lever for controlling {{the direction of}} the four vectoring nozzles. It is viewed by senior RAF officers as a significant design success, that to enable and control the aircraft's vertical flight required only a single lever added in the cockpit. For horizontal flight, the nozzles are directed rearwards by shifting the lever to the forward position; for short or vertical takeoffs and landings, the lever is pulled back to point the nozzles downwards.|$|E
5|$|Rogue Squadron {{received}} generally positive reviews.

40|$|Abstract: Building a {{scalable}} {{and highly}} integrated systems {{is an important}} re-search direction and one of key technologies in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). Au-tonomous helicopter is a typical CPS application and its flight presents challenges in <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> system design with scalability. In this paper, we present the integration architecture of hardware and software for the <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> system based TREX 600 helicopter. In order to enhance scalability, the <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> system uses the PC 104 and the ARM which is exerted to process the measurement data, including the posi-tion, attitude, height etc. The <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> is developed based multi-loop decoupling PI control which is easy to be implemented.

40|$|The F/A- 18 Hornet {{aircraft}} {{with the}} original <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> law exhibited an out-of-control phenomenon known as the falling leaf mode. The falling leaf mode went unde-tected during the validation and verification stage of the <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> law. Several F/A- 18 Hornet aircraft were lost due to the falling leaf mode {{which led to the}} redesign of the lateral-directional axis of the <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> law. The revised <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> law exhibited successful suppression of the falling leaf mode during flight tests with aggressive maneuvers. Prior to performing expensive flight tests, the <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> law was extensively validated and verified by performing linear robustness analysis at different trim points and running many Monte-Carlo simulations. Additional insight can be gained by using nonlinear anal-yses. This paper compares the two <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> laws using nonlinear region-of-attraction analyses and Monte Carlo simulations. The results of these nonlinear analyses indicate that the revised <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> law has better significantly improved nonlinear robustness properties as compared with baseline design...|$|R
5|$|The A-10's {{durability}} {{was shown}} on 7 April 2003 when Captain Kim Campbell, while flying over Baghdad during the 2003 invasion of Iraq, suffered extensive flak damage.

Despite this damage, Campbell flew the aircraft {{for nearly an hour}} and landed safely.|$|E
5|$|Media {{attention}} {{centred on}} sabotage, while other speculation ranged from clear-air turbulence to {{an explosion of}} vapour in an empty fuel tank. The Abell Committee focused on six potential aerodynamic and mechanical causes: control flutter (which had led {{to the loss of}} DH 108 prototypes), structural failure due to high loads or metal fatigue of the wing structure, failure of the powered <b>flight</b> <b>controls,</b> failure of the window panels leading to explosive decompression, or fire and other engine problems. The committee concluded that fire was the most likely cause of the problem, and a number of changes were made to the aircraft to protect the engines and wings from damage that might lead to another fire.|$|E

5|$|The Hunter F.1 entered {{service with}} the Royal Air Force in July 1954. It {{was the first}} {{high-speed}} jet aircraft equipped with radar and fully powered <b>flight</b> <b>controls</b> to go into widespread service with the RAF. The Hunter replaced the Gloster Meteor, the Canadair Sabre, and the de Havilland Venom jet fighters in service. Initially, low internal fuel capacity restricted the Hunter's performance, giving it only a maximum flight endurance of about an hour. A tragic incident occurred on 8 February 1956, when a flight of eight Hunters was redirected to another airfield owing to adverse weather conditions. Six of the eight aircraft ran out of fuel and crashed, killing one pilot.|$|E
5|$|The cockpit in the Sea Harrier {{includes}} a conventional centre stick arrangement and left-hand throttle. In addition to normal <b>flight</b> <b>controls,</b> the Harrier has a lever for controlling {{the direction of}} the four vectorable nozzles. The nozzles point rearward with the lever in the forward position for horizontal flight. With the lever back, the nozzles point downward for vertical takeoff or landing. The usefulness of the vertical landing capability of the Sea Harrier was demonstrated in an incident on 6 June 1983, when Sub Lieutenant Ian Watson lost contact with the aircraft carrier HMS Illustrious and had to land Sea Harrier ZA176 on the foredeck of the Spanish cargo ship Alraigo.|$|E
5|$|Yet another DC-10, {{performing}} Western Airlines Flight 2605, {{crashed in}} Mexico City after a red-eye flight from Los Angeles barely 5 {{months after the}} crash of American Airlines flight 191. The Western Airlines DC-10's crash, however, was due to low visibility and an attempt to land on a closed runway. Ironically, the crash of yet another DC-10, United Airlines Flight 232, ten years later, restored some of the aircraft's reputation. Despite losing an engine and all <b>flight</b> <b>controls</b> and crash-landing in a huge fireball (which was caught on video by a local news crew), 185 people survived the accident. Experts praised the DC-10's sturdy construction as {{partly responsible for the}} high number of survivors, though the efforts of the crew were primarily responsible.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWith control using {{redundant}} multiple {{control surface}} arrangement and large-deflection drag rudders, a combat flying wing {{has a higher}} probability for control surface failures. Therefore, its <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> system {{must be able to}} reconfigure after such failures. Considering three types of typical control surface failures (lock-in-place (LIP), loss-of-effectiveness (LOE) and float), <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> reconfiguration characteristic and capability of such aircraft types are analyzed. Because of the control surface redundancy, the aircraft using the dynamic inversion <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> law already has a control allocation block. In this paper, its <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> configuration during the above failures is achieved by modifying this block. It is shown that such a reconfigurable <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> design is valid, through numerical simulations of <b>flight</b> attitude <b>control</b> task. Results indicate that, in the circumstances of control surface failures with limited degree and the degradation of the flying quality level, a combat flying wing adopting this <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> reconfiguration approach based on control allocation could guarantee its flight safety and perform some flight combat missions...|$|R
5|$|After {{the loss}} of G-ALYV, the Central Government of India convened a court of inquiry to examine {{the cause of the}} accident. Professor Natesan Srinivasan joined the inquiry as the main {{technical}} expert. A large portion of the aircraft was recovered and reassembled at Farnborough, during which the break-up was found to have begun with a left elevator spar failure in the stabilizer. The inquiry concluded that the aircraft had encountered extreme negative G forces during takeoff; severe turbulence generated by adverse weather was determined to have induced down-loading, leading to {{the loss of}} the wings. Examination of the cockpit controls suggested that the pilot may have inadvertently over-stressed the aircraft when pulling out of a steep dive by over-manipulation of the fully powered <b>flight</b> <b>controls.</b> Investigators did not consider metal fatigue as a contributory cause.|$|E
5|$|The JVX {{aircraft}} was designated V-22 Osprey on 15 January 1985; by that March, {{the first six}} prototypes were being produced, and Boeing Vertol was expanded {{to deal with the}} project workload. Work has been split evenly between Bell and Boeing. Bell Helicopter manufactures and integrates the wing, nacelles, rotors, drive system, tail surfaces, and aft ramp, as well as integrates the Rolls-Royce engines and performs final assembly. Boeing Helicopters manufactures and integrates the fuselage, cockpit, avionics, and <b>flight</b> <b>controls.</b> The USMC variant of the Osprey received the MV-22 designation and the U.S. Air Force variant received CV-22; this was reversed from normal procedure to prevent Marine Corps Ospreys from having a conflicting designation with aircraft carriers (CV). Full-scale development of the V-22 tilt-rotor aircraft began in 1986. On 3 May 1986, the Bell Boeing partnership was awarded a $1.714 billion contract for V-22 aircraft by the U.S. Navy. At this point, all four U.S. military services had acquisition plans for V-22 versions.|$|E
5|$|The Victor B.2 {{featured}} a distinct {{change in the}} aircraft's engine arrangements; incorporated into the right wing root was a Blackburn Artouste airborne auxiliary power unit (AAPU), effectively a small fifth engine. The AAPU was capable of providing high-pressure air for starting the main engines, and also providing electrical power {{on the ground or}} alternatively in the air as an emergency back-up in the event of main engine failures. The AAPU also acted to reduce the need for external specialist support equipment. Turbine-driven alternators, otherwise known as ram air turbines (RATs), had been introduced on the B.2 to provide emergency power in the event of electrical or hydraulic power being lost. Retractable scoops in the rear fuselage would open to feed ram air into the RATs, which would provide sufficient electrical power to operate the <b>flight</b> <b>controls.</b> In the event of engine flameout RATs would assist the crew in maintaining control of the aircraft until the main engines could be relit.|$|E
40|$|A <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> system's task is {{to process}} and {{distribute}} signals under real time conditions. Such a <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> system has to be extremely reliable and still be capable of tolerating arbitrary faults. A <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> computer system consists of several autonomous processing-units, the so-called nodes. A time-independant model was developed to abstract the communication messages of the <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> system. This model is used to identify system assumptions, characteristic features and their relationship assuming arbitrary faults. A node has the 'jurisdiction to isolate other nodes' and is itself failure-propagation-boundary and thus potential elimination level. If a node is clearly identified as being faulty on the local level, the desire to isolate the node {{is sent to the}} so-called isolators, which will reconfigure the <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> system if a certain amount of other nodes are in agreement.

5|$|The log-on message {{sent from}} the {{aircraft}} at 08:19:29 {{was not immediately}} well understood. The 02:25 handshake was also initiated by the aircraft. Only a few reasons that the SDU would transmit a log-on message exist, such as a power interruption, software failure, loss of critical systems providing input to the SDU, or a loss of the link due to aircraft attitude. Investigators consider the most likely reason to be that they were sent during power-up after an electrical outage. At 08:19, the aircraft had been airborne for 7h 38min; the typical Kuala Lumpur-Beijing flight is 5hours and fuel exhaustion was likely. In the event of fuel exhaustion and engine flame-out, the aircraft's ram air turbine would deploy, providing power to various instruments and <b>flight</b> <b>controls,</b> including the SDU. Approximately 90seconds after the 02:25 handshake, communications from the aircraft's inflight entertainment system were recorded in the ground station log. Similar messages would be expected following the 08:19 handshake but none were received, supporting the fuel starvation scenario.|$|E
5|$|As {{the crew}} began {{to prepare for}} arrival at Sioux City, they {{questioned}} whether they should deploy the landing gear or belly-land the aircraft with the gear retracted. They decided that having the landing gear down would provide some shock absorption on impact. The complete hydraulic failure left the landing gear lowering mechanism inoperative. Two options were available to the flight crew. The DC-10 is designed such that if hydraulic pressure to the landing gear is lost, the gear will fall down slightly and rest on the landing gear doors. Placing the regular landing gear handle in the down position will unlock the doors mechanically, and the doors and landing gear will then fall down into place and lock due to gravity. An alternative system is also available using a lever in the cockpit floor to cause the landing gear to fall into position. This lever has {{the added benefit of}} unlocking the outboard ailerons, which are not used in high-speed flight and are locked in a neutral position. The crew hoped that there might be some trapped hydraulic fluid in the outboard ailerons and that they might regain some use of <b>flight</b> <b>controls</b> by unlocking them. They elected to extend the gear with the alternative system. Although the gear deployed successfully, there was no change in the controllability of the aircraft.|$|E
