5|$|In their ninth {{game of the}} season, the Tar <b>Heels</b> lost to No. 2 Florida State, 203. The {{loss was}} the sole losing effort for the Tar <b>Heels</b> in the 1997 season, and came {{at the hands of}} the {{eventual}} Atlantic Coast champion Seminoles. During the game, the Tar <b>Heels</b> also lost their then-starting quarterback, Oscar Davenport, to a broken ankle. North Carolina recovered from the loss to win its final two games: 1710 against Clemson, and 5014 over Duke. Despite having only one loss, the Tar <b>Heels</b> were denied a chance to participate in a Bowl Alliance game and instead accepted a bid to the 1998 Gator Bowl.|$|E

Hopes were high for the Tar <b>Heels</b> heading into the 1997 season, with some writers and fans picking North Carolina {{to have a chance}} to compete for the national championship. The Tar <b>Heels</b> bore out those hopes in the first game of the season, beating Big Ten opponent Indiana, 236.|$|E
5|$|The Tar <b>Heels</b> {{defeated}} the Yale Bulldogs 9074 in the NCAA East Regional Quarterfinal {{in order to}} advance to the semifinal against Canisius College.

The final, along with the semifinal, were held at the Palestra in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The Syracuse Orange fell to the Tar <b>Heels</b> 6758 as the Tar <b>Heels</b> advanced to the Final Four in Kansas City, Missouri. The Tar <b>Heels</b> opponent for the national semifinal was Michigan State. The Tar <b>Heels</b> were tied with the Spartans as time was winding down in regulation. Michigan State's Jack Quiggle made a half court shot that would have given the Spartans the lead, but the shot left his hands after time expired, nullifying the basket. In the first overtime, Michigan State had a two-point lead with eleven seconds remaining, while also having a player at the foul line. The Spartan missed both shots and Tar Heel Brennan gathered the rebound, dribbled down the court, and made a shot as time expired to send the game to a second overtime. The Tar <b>Heels</b> pulled away in the third overtime to win the game 7470. The game saw the lead change thirtyone times before the Tar <b>Heels</b> were able to emerge victorious after three overtime periods.|$|E

5|$|After {{surviving}} numerous close games {{during the}} regular season, conference tournament, and most recently a triple overtime game against Michigan State in the national semifinal, North Carolina came into the National Championship game with an unblemished record of 310. Led by coach Frank McGuire and Helms Foundation College Basketball Player of the Year Lennie Rosenbluth, the Tar <b>Heels</b> were ranked first overall in the AP Poll. Kansas came into the National Championship game with two losses, which were credited to poor ball control on the Jayhawks part. The Kansas Jayhawks, led by Sophomore phenom and Firstteam All-American Wilt Chamberlain, came into the game favored to win against the Tar <b>Heels</b> of North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|Chamberlain {{made the}} First Team of the All-America squad and led his Jayhawks into the NCAA finals against the Tar <b>Heels</b> of North Carolina. In that game, Tar <b>Heels</b> coach Frank McGuire used several unorthodox tactics to thwart Chamberlain. For the tip-off, {{he sent his}} {{shortest}} player, Tommy Kearns, in order to rattle Chamberlain, and the Tar <b>Heels</b> {{spent the rest of}} the night triple-teaming him, one defender in front, one behind, and a third arriving as soon as he got the ball. With their fixation on Chamberlain, the Jayhawks shot only 27% from the field, as opposed to 64% of the Tar <b>Heels,</b> and trailed 22–29 at halftime. Later, North Carolina led 40–37 with 10 minutes to go and stalled the game: they passed the ball around without any intention of scoring a basket. After several Tar Heel turnovers, the game was tied at 46 at the end of regulation. In the first overtime each team scored two points, and in the second overtime Kansas froze the ball in return, keeping the game tied at 48. In the third overtime, the Tar <b>Heels</b> scored two consecutive baskets, but Chamberlain executed a three-point play, leaving KU trailing 52–51. After King scored a basket, Kansas was ahead by one point, but then Tar Heel Joe Quigg was fouled on a drive with 10 seconds remaining and made his two foul shots. For the final play, Dick Harp called for Ron Loneski to pass the ball into Chamberlain in the low post. The pass was intercepted, however, and the Tar <b>Heels</b> won the game. Nonetheless, Chamberlain, who scored 23 points and 14 rebounds, was elected the Most Outstanding Player of the Final Four. Cherry has speculated, however, that this loss was a watershed in Chamberlain's life, because it was the first time that his team lost despite him putting up impressive individual stats. Chamberlain later admitted that this loss was the most painful of his life.|$|E

However, the in vivo properties of the <b>heel</b> pad during gait remain largely unexplored in this cohort. The aim of the current study was to characterise the bulk compressive properties of the <b>heel</b> pad in individuals with and without plantar <b>heel</b> pain while walking. [...] Methods: The sagittal thickness and axial compressive strain of the <b>heel</b> pad were estimated in vivo from dynamic lateral foot radiographs acquired from nine subjects with unilateral plantar <b>heel</b> pain and an equivalent number of matched controls, while walking at their preferred speed. Compressive stress was derived from simultaneously acquired plantar pressure data. Principal viscoelastic parameters of the <b>heel</b> pad, including peak strain, secant modulus and energy dissipation (hysteresis), were estimated from subsequent stress–strain curves. [...] Findings: There {{was no significant difference in}} loaded and unloaded <b>heel</b> pad thickness, peak stress, peak strain, or secant and tangent modulus in subjects with and without <b>heel</b> pain. However, the fat pad of symptomatic feet had a significantly lower energy dissipation ratio (0. 55 ± 0. 17 vs. 0. 69 ± 0. 08) when compared to asymptomatic feet (P <. 05).

40|$|Background The plantar <b>heel</b> pad is a {{specialised}} fibroadipose {{tissue that}} attenuates and dissipates, in part, the impact energy associated with <b>heel</b> strike.

This study used a digital fluoroscope, synchronised with a pressure plate, to obtain force–deformation data for the <b>heel</b> pad during walking. Methods Dynamic lateral foot radiographs were acquired from sixteen healthy adults while walking at their preferred speed. Sagittal thickness and deformation of the <b>heel</b> pad relative to the support surface were calculated. Simultaneous measurement of peak force beneath the <b>heel</b> was used to estimate the princi-pal structural properties of the <b>heel</b> pad. Results Transient loading profiles associated with walking induced rapidly changing deformation rates in the <b>heel</b> pad and resulted in irregular load–deformation curves. The initial stiff-ness (32 ± 11 N. mm– 1) of the <b>heel</b> pad was an order of magni-tude lower than its final stiffness (212 ± 125 N. mm– 1) and only 1. 0 J of energy, on average, was dissipated by the <b>heel</b> pad during walking.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the <b>heel</b> pad {{mechanical}} properties of runners, who repetitively load the <b>heel</b> pad during training, with cyclists who do not load their <b>heel</b> pads during training. Ten competitive long distance runners and 10 competitive cyclists volunteered for this study. The thickness of the unloaded <b>heel</b> pad was measured using realtime B-mode ultrasonography. A <b>heel</b> pad indentation device was used to measure the mechanical properties of the <b>heel</b> pads. To evaluate the differences between the two groups, in <b>heel</b> pad properties, a repeat measures analysis of variance was used (p <. 05.) <b>Heel</b> pad thickness was not different between groups when normalized with respect to subject height. There was no significant difference between the groups in percentage energy loss during loading and unloading (runners: 61. 4 % +/- 8. 6; cyclists: 62. 5 % +/- 4. 6). <b>Heel</b> pad stiffness for the runners was statistically significantly less than that of the cyclists (p =. 0018; runners: 17. 1 N. - 1 +/- 3. 0; cyclists: 20. 4 N. - 1 +/- 4. 0).
