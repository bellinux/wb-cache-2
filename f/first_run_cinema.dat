40|$|Traditionally film {{studies are}} focused on the stylistic, {{narrative}} and cultural history of cinema. Even with the acknowledgement that the movies were cultural yet commercial artefacts traded on a variety of film markets, contemporary film studies favour a socio-cultural film history as a niche. Our contribution examines local film culture based on the analysis of actual attendance figures from the major first-run cinema of Ghent, the Capitole, between 1953 and 1971. It is a historiographic research on unique archival material captured in a database containing data on 801 films. Based on cultural economics, the analysis explores issues like taste-patterns, financial policy and programming strategies in a pivotal period of crisis in the film market. A first analysis describes the programming strategies of Capitole based on preferences in genre of the films, their country of origin and year of production. A second analysis studies the popularity of the programmed films. Finally, a financial analysis of the data on the ticket prices, gross revenues, taxes, admission numbers and net income characterizes this <b>first</b> <b>run</b> <b>cinema</b> in times of crisis. Capitole was an exclusive first-run cinema with a varied programming strategy thriving on a luxurious image and runaway entertainment. This manuscript which draws upon longitudinal analyses, shows that even though cinema attendance dropped significantly over the course of twenty years this did not correspond with equally plummeting gross income...|$|E

The film arm of Civic primarily shows a variety of independent and international films, generally at lower prices than <b>first</b> <b>run</b> <b>cinemas,</b> about 60-80 movie titles a year. The Civic Theatre School enrolls more than 350 students a year in Fall, Winter and Summer sessions. The theatre's annual operating budget is roughly $1 million per year.|$|R
5000|$|The Communist {{government}} invested {{resources into}} building a sophisticated cinema audience. All the cinema were state owned {{and consisted of}} <b>first</b> <b>run</b> premiere <b>cinema,</b> local cinema and art house cinemas. Tickets were cheap and students and old people received discounts. In the city of Lodz there were 36 cinemas in the 1970s showing films {{from all over the}} world. There were the Italian films of Fellini, French comedies, American crime movies such as Don Siegel's [...] "Charley Varrick" [...] Films were shown in their original versions with polish subtitles. Anti communist and cold war films were not shown, but a bigger restriction was the cost of some films. There were popular film magazines like [...] "Film" [...] and [...] "Screen", critical magazines such as [...] "Kino". This all helped to build a well informed film audience.|$|R
5000|$|The Dome is an Edwardian {{building}} {{and one of}} the oldest working cinemas in England, and was opened in 1911 (Brighton's Duke of York's Picture House was opened in 1910). It was opened by Swiss impresario Carl Adolf Seebold. It was originally named The Kursaal — a German word translating as [...] "cure hall". The Kursaal was used as a health centre and entertainment complex by visitors to the seaside town. At the time it contained the Coronation Hall, which was used for roller skating, exhibitions, concerts and events, and the Electric Theatre, the <b>first</b> <b>cinema</b> <b>run</b> for paying audiences in West Sussex.|$|R
50|$|On its release, London {{received}} generally good, albeit not outstanding, reviews. The {{photography and}} acting was praised, although the storyline was deemed unconvincing and over-reliant on coincidence.

5000|$|A {{native of}} Cornwall, in 1930 Williams joined Teddington Studios, the British arm of Warner Brothers, {{where he would}} spend the next 15 years. The 1930s was {{the golden age of}} the quota quickie, when Teddington was {{churning}} out quickly and cheaply shot films by the week, so work was plentiful. With few exceptions, these films were deemed of ephemeral value, with no worthwhile life after their <b>first</b> <b>cinema</b> <b>run.</b> The unfortunate result for modern film historians is that a good proportion are now classed as lost films, while those that have survived did so more by chance than intention. Films on which Williams worked included three early Michael Powell ventures Something Always Happens, The Girl in the Crowd and Someday, of which only the first is still extant. Between 1936 and 1939 he also formed part of a regular four-way working partnership with director Arthur B. Woods, producer Irving Asher and cinematographer Basil Emmott, most notably on Q Planes.|$|R
