5|$|Wet {{deposits}} of ash on high voltage insulators can initiate a leakage current (small amount of current <b>flow</b> <b>across</b> the insulator surface) which, if sufficient current is achieved, can cause ‘flashover’ (the unintended electrical discharge around {{or over the}} surface of an insulating material).|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Edith rapidly {{weakened}} {{over the}} mountainous terrain of northeastern Central America, and 18 hours after it made landfall, it emerged into the Gulf of Honduras as an 80 mph (130 km/h) Category 1 hurricane. It continued to weaken {{as it moved}} northwestward, and made landfall near Belize City with tropical storm winds of 70 mph (115 km/h). Edith weakened further while crossing the Yucatán Peninsula, and emerged into the Gulf of Mexico near Campeche, Mexico late on September 11 as a minimal tropical storm. Edith initially failed to re-intensify as it moved northwestward, despite low amounts of wind shear and warm waters. This was because an anticyclone over the Gulf was closely connected with Hurricane Fern, which developed and moved over the northwestern portion of the Gulf of Mexico. The anticyclone resulted in an easterly upper-level <b>flow</b> <b>across</b> Edith, creating conditions not conducive for intensification. As Fern moved inland over Texas, the flow became more favorable around Edith, and 36 hours after entering the Gulf of Mexico, the storm began to reintensify slightly.|$|E

40|$|We provide {{evidence}} regarding the dynamic behaviour of net labour <b>flows</b> <b>across</b> U. S. states {{in response to}} a positive technology shock. Technology shocks are identified as disturbances that increase relative state productivity in the long run for 226 state pairs, encompassing 80 per cent of labour <b>flows</b> <b>across</b> U. S. states in the 1976 - 2008 period. The data suggest heterogeneous responses of both employment and net labour <b>flows</b> <b>across</b> states, conditional on a positive technology shock. We build a two-region dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model with endogenous labour mobility and region-specific shocks to account for this evidence. We calibrate the model economy consistently with the observed differences in the degree of nominal rigidities across states, and show that we replicate the different patterns of the responses in employment and net labour <b>flows</b> <b>across</b> states following a technology shock...|$|R
5|$|In mid-August, a {{tropical}} wave emerged off the western coast of Africa. The northern {{portion of the}} wave {{led to the formation}} of Tropical Storm Emily in the Atlantic, while the southern portion of the wave continued westward. It crossed Central America on August31 and September1, characterized by a large area of convection and a mid-level circulation. The disturbance traversed southern Mexico before emerging offshore, where it began to interact with a broad area of low pressure that existed in the eastern Pacific for several days prior. Shower and thunderstorm activity became concentrated about a well-defined center, leading to the formation of {{a tropical}} depression near Manzanillo, Mexico by 12:00UTC on September5. A portion of the tropical wave also combined with monsoonal-like <b>flow</b> <b>across</b> the Bay of Campeche to form Tropical Depression Seven in the Atlantic.|$|E

25|$|Vibrio cholera {{bacteria}} are transmitted through contaminated water.

25|$|DNA {{transfers}} naturally between organisms. Several natural mechanisms allow gene <b>flow</b> <b>across</b> species. These {{occur in}} nature {{on a large}} scale – for example, it is one mechanism for the development of antibiotic resistance in bacteria. This is facilitated by transposons, retrotransposons, proviruses and other mobile genetic elements that naturally translocate DNA to new loci in a genome. Movement occurs over an evolutionary time scale.|$|E

25|$|Only five {{laminations}} or {{plates are}} shown in this example, so as to show the subdivision of the eddy currents. In practical use, the number of laminations or punchings ranges from 40 to 66 per inch, and brings the eddy current loss down to about one percent. While the plates can be separated by insulation, the voltage is so low that the natural rust/oxide coating of the plates is enough to prevent current <b>flow</b> <b>across</b> the laminations.|$|E
25|$|Ripple {{current is}} the AC {{component}} of an applied source (often a switched-mode power supply) whose frequency may be constant or varying. Ripple current causes heat to be generated {{within the capacitor}} due to the dielectric losses caused by the changing field strength together with the current <b>flow</b> <b>across</b> the slightly resistive supply lines or the electrolyte in the capacitor. The equivalent series resistance (ESR) {{is the amount of}} internal series resistance one would add to a perfect capacitor to model this.|$|E
25|$|Another paradox due to {{mathematical}} idealization is D'Alembert's {{paradox of}} fluid mechanics. When the forces associated with two-dimensional, incompressible, irrotational, inviscid steady <b>flow</b> <b>across</b> a body are calculated, {{there is no}} drag. This is in contradiction with observations of such flows, but {{as it turns out}} a fluid that rigorously satisfies all the conditions is a physical impossibility. The mathematical model breaks down at the surface of the body, and new solutions involving boundary layers have to be considered to correctly model the drag effects.|$|E

25|$|When two solid bodies come in contact, such as A and B in Figure 1, heat {{flows from}} the hotter body to the colder body. From experience, the {{temperature}} profile along the two bodies varies, approximately, {{as shown in the}} figure. A temperature drop is observed at the interface between the two surfaces in contact. This phenomenon {{is said to be a}} result of a thermal contact resistance existing between the contacting surfaces. Thermal contact resistance is defined as the ratio between this temperature drop and the average heat <b>flow</b> <b>across</b> the interface.|$|E
25|$|No truly smooth {{surfaces}} really exist, {{and surface}} imperfections are visible under a microscope. As a result, when two bodies are pressed together, contact is only {{performed in a}} finite number of points, separated by relatively large gaps, as can be shown in Fig. 2. Since the actual contact area is reduced, another resistance for heat flow exists. The gases/fluids filling these gaps may largely influence the total heat <b>flow</b> <b>across</b> the interface. The thermal conductivity of the interstitial material and its pressure are the two properties governing its influence on contact conductance.|$|E
25|$|Another {{division}} is between side-blown (or transverse) flutes, {{such as the}} Western concert flute, piccolo, fife, dizi and bansuri; and end-blown flutes, such as the ney, xiao, kaval, danso, shakuhachi, Anasazi flute and quena. The player of a side-blown flute uses a hole {{on the side of}} the tube to produce a tone, instead of blowing on an end of the tube. End-blown flutes should not be confused with fipple flutes such as the recorder, which are also played vertically but have an internal duct to direct the air <b>flow</b> <b>across</b> the edge of the tone hole.|$|E

25|$|Geo{{textiles}} {{form one}} of the two largest groups of geosynthetics. They are textiles consisting of synthetic fibers rather than natural ones such as cotton, wool, or silk. This makes them less susceptible to bio-degradation. These synthetic fibers are made into flexible, porous fabrics by standard weaving machinery or are matted together in a random non woven manner. Some are also knitted. Geotextiles are porous to liquid <b>flow</b> <b>across</b> their manufactured plane and also within their thickness, but to a widely varying degree. There are at least 100 specific application areas for geotextiles that have been developed; however, the fabric always performs at least one of four discrete functions: separation, reinforcement, filtration, and/or drainage.|$|E
25|$|The random {{disorder}} in the potential {{landscape of the}} two-dimensional electron gas {{plays a key role}} in the observation of topological sectors and their instantons (phase transitions). Because of the disorder, the electrons are localized and thus they cannot <b>flow</b> <b>across</b> the sample. But if we consider a loop around a localized 2D electron, we can notice that current is still able to flow in the direction around this loop. This current is able to renormalize to larger scales and eventually becomes the Hall current that rotates along the edge of the sample. A topological sector corresponds to an integer number of rotations and it is now visible macroscopically, in the robustly quantized behavior of the measurable Hall current. If the electrons were not sufficiently localized, this measurement would be blurred out by the usual flow of current through the sample.|$|E
25|$|Biofilms {{have become}} {{problematic}} in several food industries {{due to the}} ability to form on plants and during industrial processes. Bacteria can survive long periods of time in water, animal manure, and soil, causing biofilm formation on plants or in the processing equipment. The buildup of biofilms can affect the heat <b>flow</b> <b>across</b> a surface and increase surface corrosion and frictional resistance of fluids. These can lead to a loss of energy in a system and overall loss of products. Along with economic problems biofilm formation on food poses a health risk to consumers due {{to the ability to}} make the food more resistant to disinfectants As a result, from 1996 to 2010 the Center for Disease Control and Prevention estimated 48 million foodborne illnesses per year. Biofilms have been connected to about 80% of bacterial infections in the United States.|$|E
