5|$|Emeco founder Wilton C. Dinges {{developed}} the Emeco 1006 chair in 1944 {{in collaboration with}} the Aluminum Company of America (ALCOA). It was originally designed for the US Navy, which needed a chair for the deck of battleships that could survive sea air and a torpedo blast {{to the side of the}} ship. The chairs had <b>eye</b> <b>bolts</b> under the seat, so they could be attached to a ship-deck using cables.|$|E
2500|$|The pier was [...] {{long with}} a [...] {{passenger}} deck. This comprised three [...] wooden spans suspended [...] above high water from lengths of wrought-iron chain connecting cast-iron standards to the shore. Each standard {{was in the}} shape of an arch which the passengers walked through. By 1838 the passenger deck had rails fitted to assist in moving large items of luggage. The chain was made of <b>eye</b> <b>bolts</b> about [...] long, which, uniquely among Brown's designs, varied in thickness according to the load they were expected to carry. The long <b>eye</b> <b>bolts</b> were joined by shorter linking plates, and hung in a catenary [...] from the tops of the standards. The chains crossed the standards on cast-iron saddles. The three seaward standards were built on platforms anchored to wooden piles driven into the foreshore. The largest platform, which formed the head of the pier, was [...] by , and covered in [...] thick planks. The length of the pier head was extended to [...] prior to November 1821. It was supported on 46 piles driven [...] into the clay seabed. At the landward end the chain passed over a solid masonry construction, [...] square and [...] high, and was then anchored at a 45° angle [...] into the hard clay soil. The seaward end of the chain went over the outer piles at the same angle, and the piles were braced with diagonal supports to take the sideways load. There was a [...] wrought-iron railing {{along the length of the}} deck, straight diagonal members connecting the deck to the standards, and iron bracing under the deck. The pier was designed for passenger use only, and moved noticeably when walked on.|$|E
2500|$|While {{serving in}} the Royal Navy, Brown had experimented with using chain instead of rope in rigging sailing ships, and in 1808 he {{patented}} {{a new kind of}} wrought-iron chain. He sold the design to the Admiralty, which used it as anchor cable on ships. Brown considered that using piles to support a pier was superior to the traditional method of building in stone, because it was more economical to build and easier for ships to dock with. He cited pile-supported piers at Yarmouth, Ostend and Kronstadt which had been successful for long periods based on this design. Brown had used chains in his designs for some of Britain's first suspension bridges; he realised that chains made out of <b>eye</b> <b>bolts</b> joined together were stronger than traditional designs based on shorter links. He was regarded as a [...] "leading promoter" [...] of suspension bridges. He proposed that suspension piers could support military and rescue operations. On 14 August 1822 Brown married Mary Horne from Edinburgh. After the pier at Trinity he went on to build the similar but much larger Royal Suspension Chain Pier in Brighton in 1823. It was destroyed by a storm in 1896.|$|E
5000|$|A cranked <b>eye</b> <b>bolt</b> is an <b>eye</b> <b>bolt</b> {{typically}} {{used as a}} structural tie down [...] in building construction where the <b>eye</b> of the <b>bolt</b> must be fastened {{to a point that}} cannot be directly below where the shaft would otherwise be fastened. This often occurs where a bearer must be tied down to a post or column but the bearer cannot be directly fastened to the post of column.|$|R
5000|$|She {{designed}} {{a necklace of}} an <b>eye</b> <b>bolt</b> on a chain, meant to represent [...] "strength without a fist"; she gave {{the first of these}} to Arlene Raven and Judy Chicago when they started the Feminist Studio Workshop in 1972. Since then she has given them to other women with whom she shares a vision of the creation of women's culture. Members of the Feminist Studio Workshop of 1978-79 also made 500 of these necklaces to celebrate the 5th anniversary of the Woman's Building in Los Angeles. The feminist art group Sisters of Jam (Mikaela & Moa Krestesen) turned the necklace into a mobile monument; they see the <b>eye</b> <b>bolt</b> [...] "as a symbol for the work already done but also as an encouragement for the work that is not yet completed." [...] Sisters of Jam also did the installation [...] "Hello Sheila", which features an <b>eye</b> <b>bolt</b> on a chain, at the Survival Kit Festival in Umeå in 2014.|$|R
50|$|A special type of Stevenson {{screen with}} an <b>eye</b> <b>bolt</b> {{on the roof}} is used on a ship. The unit is hung from above and remains {{vertical}} despite {{the movement of the}} vessel.|$|R
50|$|Machinery <b>eye</b> <b>bolts</b> {{are fully}} {{threaded}} {{and may have}} a collar, making them suitable for use with angular loads up to 45°. <b>Eye</b> <b>bolts</b> without a shoulder {{should not be used}} for angular loads.|$|E
50|$|A turnbuckle, {{stretching}} screw or bottlescrew is {{a device}} for adjusting the tension or length of ropes, cables, tie rods, and other tensioning systems. It normally {{consists of two}} threaded <b>eye</b> <b>bolts,</b> one screwed into each end of a small metal frame, one with a left-hand thread {{and the other with}} a right-hand thread. The tension can be adjusted by rotating the frame, which causes both <b>eye</b> <b>bolts</b> to be screwed in or out simultaneously, without twisting the <b>eye</b> <b>bolts</b> or attached cables.|$|E
50|$|Wire eye lags (also called {{screw thread}} <b>eye</b> <b>bolts,</b> eye screws, or turned/bent eye lags) have a wood screw thread {{for use in}} wood or lag anchors. Like wire <b>eye</b> <b>bolts,</b> wire eye lags are {{intended}} for light duty applications {{and should not be}} used for angular loads.|$|E
50|$|An <b>eye</b> <b>bolt</b> is a bolt with a loop at one end. They {{are used}} to firmly attach a {{securing}} eye to a structure, so that ropes or cables may then be tied to it.|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the first}} actions of Superintendent Sumner Increase Kimball, the only {{superintendent}} of the U.S. Life-Saving Service, {{was to find a}} better line-throwing device. Kimball realized he needed the best artillery expertise available, so he engaged the help of the Army Board of Ordnance and in 1877 they assigned David A. Lyle, First Lieutenant, U.S.A (1845-1937), a West Point and MIT graduate who began research and testing that resulted in reliable efficient designs. Lyle developed 3 bronze, smooth-bore guns of different sizes and the 2+1/2 in gun became the USLSS standard line-throwing gun. Projectiles for the gun were made of cast iron with a wrought iron <b>eye</b> <b>bolt</b> screwed into the base as an attachment point for the shot line. The projectile for the 2+1/2 in gun was 15+3/4 in long and weighed [...] It was placed into the 24 in gun barrel so the <b>eye</b> <b>bolt</b> with the line attached was sticking out. After firing, the projectile rotated so that the <b>eye</b> <b>bolt</b> and line were trailing. The gun had a large recoil from firing. A standard charge of 1.5 oz of gunpowder would knock the gun back 6 ft. The maximum rescue charge of 8 oz would send the gun flying back even further.|$|R
5000|$|A ring <b>bolt</b> is an <b>eye</b> <b>bolt</b> with {{a captive}} ring passing through it. The loose ring is articulated, {{such that it}} can rotate {{in at least one}} axis, and can thus reduce bending forces on the bolt when loaded and will present the minimum {{obstruction}} when [...] "flat".|$|R
50|$|<b>Eye</b> <b>bolts</b> made by bending a rod or wire into a loop {{are only}} {{suitable}} for light duty applications, as heavy loads {{can cause the}} eye to open. For high loads, <b>eye</b> <b>bolts</b> with forged or welded loops should be chosen, as they can withstand loads up to the tensile strength of the material {{of which they are}} made.|$|E
50|$|Cranked <b>eye</b> <b>bolts</b> {{are made}} with {{different}} degrees of crank and lengths of shaft for flexibility.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} of several trigger {{mechanisms}} is two <b>eye</b> <b>bolts</b> and a peg through both bolts. The <b>eye</b> <b>bolts</b> are usually {{placed at the}} bottom of the frame, locking above the arm to prevent accidental release. In larger designs, the trigger system is applied at the top of the drop channel. Large scale designs require special trigger mechanisms that can hold the weight of the throwing arm.|$|E

50|$|Stress positions: Prisoners {{are forced}} to stand, handcuffed and with their feet {{shackled}} to an <b>eye</b> <b>bolt</b> in the floor (and/or wall), for more than 40 hours, causing the prisoners' weight {{to be placed on}} just one or two muscles. This creates an intense amount of pressure on the legs, leading first to pain and then muscle failure.|$|R
5000|$|The {{following}} {{types of}} sex swing exist: traditional swing, door swing, body swing, and fantasy swing. The body swing is suspended from one partner's body. The door swing {{is mounted on}} a door. The fantasy swing is suspended from an <b>eye</b> <b>bolt</b> in the ceiling. In popular culture, sex swing is mostly associated with BDSM practices.|$|R
50|$|Today, cranked <b>eye</b> <b>bolts</b> are now {{typically}} made by welding a cranked and {{threaded rod}} to a {{heavy gauge steel}} washer.|$|E
50|$|Heavy forged <b>eye</b> <b>bolts</b> with a {{continuous}} eye may be forged with an integral shoulder, allowing their use for heavy off-axis loads.|$|E

25|$|The Seagull had an {{all-metal}} construction with a two spar {{parasol wing}} {{mounted on a}} pylon connecting it to the fuselage. The single engine, a Rolls-Royce Griffon drove contra-rotating propellers; radiators were mounted below the engine in the pylon. The rear of the pylon accommodated an observer's position with two windows. An <b>eye</b> <b>bolt</b> was fitted on the wing, behind the engine, so the aircraft could be easily lifted from the water by crane.|$|R
5000|$|Sand anchor: The sand anchor is used {{to secure}} the shore-side of the fall to the beach. It {{consists}} of two wooden planks connected loosely together with an <b>eye</b> <b>bolt</b> with pendant attached. The pendant {{is used to}} attach the fall to the sand anchor. A narrow trench is dug in the fashion of a cross {{to a depth of}} approximately 2+1/2 ft. The anchor is placed in it and buried with care given not to cover the pendant.|$|R
5000|$|... 'Pigtail' <b>eye</b> <b>bolts</b> are {{a form of}} bent loop {{where the}} ends are not closed, but {{multiple}} turns are used to prevent a rope slipping out. They allow a rope to be threaded into the loop, even if its ends are already attached elsewhere.|$|E
50|$|<b>Eye</b> <b>bolts</b> {{are often}} {{installed}} into masonry and so versions that {{form their own}} anchor bolt are commonly available. Most of these screw into some form of shield anchor. Some lightweight forms are not screwed, but rely on just the pull on the ring itself to expand the anchor.|$|E
