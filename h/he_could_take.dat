5|$|Bowie had {{originally}} {{planned to take}} the Glass Spider Tour to Russia, albeit with the band only (no dancers or elaborate props), but with the money and extra stage provided by the sponsorship, Bowie felt <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>take</b> the full tour to Russia and South America. However, these plans failed to come to fruition, and the tour never reached those regions.|$|E
5|$|Cornwallis was {{sensitive}} {{to the fact that}} Tipu was likely to deny the invading army access to local forage and provisions, so he made arrangements for a large supply of provisions and arranged for the use of elephants to assist in the movement of the army's siege equipment. He also encouraged the Marathas and the Nizam to step up their advances to join his army as quickly as possible so that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>take</b> advantage of their cavalry.|$|E

5|$|In {{the second}} episode, both St-Pierre and Koscheck had Johnson {{at the top}} of their lists when it came time to select fighters. During the team {{selection}} process however, St-Pierre created a fake list which did not have Johnson among his top selections, and subtly showed it to Koscheck to fool him into believing it. This seemed to manipulate Koscheck into picking Marc Stevens, as he may have believed <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>take</b> Johnson later. This allowed St-Pierre to choose Johnson with the second overall pick.|$|E
5|$|The Binding of Isaac was {{developed}} following {{the release of}} Super Meat Boy, which McMillen considered a significant risk and a large time effort. When Super Meat Boy was released to both critical praise and strong sales, {{he felt that he}} no longer had to worry about the consequences of taking risks with his finances supported by its sales. He also considered <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>take</b> further risk with the concept.|$|E
5|$|From 11 to 14 February 1945, the Yalta Conference {{took place}} in the neighbouring, former {{imperial}} Livadia Palace; this was between representatives from the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union. Winston Churchill and part}} of his British delegation were given temporary residence within the Vorontsov Palace. Within two weeks, construction workers had restored 22 rooms in the main palace, 23 rooms in the Shuvalov wing, and even replanted the palace gardens. The palace's English-inspired architectural style gained praise from Churchill himself: Churchill was so taken by the garden's Medici lions that he later asked Stalin if <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>take</b> them home; Stalin declined the request.|$|E

60|$|The {{funeral was}} a fine thing. The Cadets paraded in a style {{calculated}} to kill the late member with envy. Tom was a free boy again, however --there was something in that. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> drink and swear, now--but found to his surprise {{that he did not}} want to. The simple fact that <b>he</b> <b>could,</b> <b>took</b> the desire away, and the charm of it.|$|R

5|$|Lead {{production}} designer Richard Hudolin flew to Los Angeles, 1996 {{to gather}} material from Stargate for reference {{and found the}} original film prop stored outside in the Californian desert. Although the prop had severely disintegrated, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>take</b> a detailed mould for Stargate SG-1 production to build its own prop. The new Stargate was engineered to turn, lock the chevrons, and be computer-controlled to dial specific gate addresses. A portable Stargate prop was built for on-location shoots and required six workers and one full day to set up. Since visual effects are sometimes faster and cheaper, a computer-generated Stargate was occasionally used in on-location shoots in later seasons.|$|E
5|$|Lee {{was born}} in Bagan Serai, Perak, to a Malaysian Chinese family. In his early years, he favoured {{basketball}}, however his mother soon banned him from the game due to the searing heat of the outdoor basketball court. Lee began to learn badminton {{at the age of}} 11, when his father, who liked to play the game, brought him to the badminton hall. Attracting the attention of a local coach, the coach asked Lee's father if <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>take</b> him as a student. After receiving his father's consent, the coach began to train Lee after school. Discovered by Misbun Sidek, he was drafted into the national squad when he was seventeen years old.|$|E
5|$|Michael Woodruff {{was born}} on 3 April 1911 in Mill Hill, London, England. In 1913, his father, Harold Woodruff, a {{professor}} of veterinary medicine at the Royal Veterinary College in London, moved the family to Australia so <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>take</b> up the post of Professor of Veterinary Pathology and Director of the Veterinary Institute at the University of Melbourne. The elder Woodruff later became the Professor of Bacteriology. The family's new life in Australia was interrupted by World War I, which prompted Harold to enlist in the armed services. He became {{an officer in the}} Australian Army Veterinary Corps and was sent to Egypt.|$|E

5|$|Once the VIII Corps was at Koblenz, Patton took {{most of its}} {{divisions}} {{away for}} an operation with XII Corps further up the river at Mainz, leaving Middleton with some corps units (mostly artillery) and a single division, the 87th Infantry. Middleton asked Patton if <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>take</b> Koblenz with the 87th, eliciting a laugh from the army commander. Middleton pressed him to let him try, and with the commander's approval {{he was able to}} take the city, which only had about 500 defenders. Most of the other German troops were {{on the other side of}} the Rhine not wanting to get trapped between the Rhine and the Moselle Rivers.|$|E
5|$|Otonashi is {{the protagonist}} of Angel Beats!. Due to his past, he has a caring {{personality}} and does not want anyone to experience pain or sadness. After dying, he lost his memories {{of the time when}} he was still alive, but later regains them. He had a younger sister, , who died of cancer and whom he cared for very much. When she died, he decided to go to school to become a doctor, but died in a train accident before <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>take</b> the entrance exam to college. Initially unskilled in any equipment, he starts to practice his marksmanship, and pulls through for the team when they are in danger. He carries a Glock 17.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} 70 {{people who have}} served as governor, over 73 {{distinct}} terms. Additionally, Henry Molleston was elected, but died before <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>take</b> office. Only four governors have been elected to two consecutive terms, with the longest-serving being Ruth Ann Minner, who was elected twice after succeeding to the office, serving a total of just over eight years. The shortest term is that of Dale E. Wolf, who served 18 days following his predecessor's resignation; David P. Buckson served 19 days under similar circumstances. The current governor is John Carney, who took office on January 17, 2017.|$|E

5|$|After a long {{absence from}} politics, Marshall {{was called to}} one final act of public service. Upon the death of Martin D. Hardin who had been elected to the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1823 but died before <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>take</b> office, Marshall pursued an {{abbreviated}} campaign for the vacant seat and defeated Jeptha Dudley {{by a margin of}} 3 votes. The primary issue of the day was the Old Court – New Court controversy, an attempt by the legislature to abolish the extant Court of Appeals {{and replace it with a}} new court in retaliation for overturning a replevin law passed in a previous legislative session. Marshall enjoyed a higher level of support in this election by virtue of his support for the Old Court, which was the prevailing sentiment in his district. His actions in the session, however, appear to have been unremarkable, and he did not seek reelection at the end of his term.|$|E
5|$|Governor Broward {{ran for the}} U.S. Senate in 1908 but lost. Broward and his predecessor, William Jennings, {{were paid}} by Richard Bolles to tour the state to promote drainage. Broward {{was elected to the}} Senate in 1910, but died before <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>take</b> office. He was eulogized across Florida for his {{leadership}} and progressive inspiration. Rapidly growing Fort Lauderdale paid him tribute by naming Broward County after him (the town's original plan had been to name it Everglades County). Land in the Everglades was being sold for $15 an acre a month after Broward died. Meanwhile, Henry Flagler continued to build railway stations at towns as soon as the populations warranted them. News of the Panama Canal inspired him to connect his rail line to the closest deep water port. Biscayne Bay was too shallow, so Flagler sent railway scouts to explore the possibility of building the line through to the tip of mainland Florida. The scouts reported that not enough land was present to build through the Everglades, so Flagler instead changed the plan to build to Key West in 1912.|$|E
5|$|Marcel Lihau {{was born}} on 29 September 1931 in Bumba, Équateur Province, Belgian Congo, the eldest of eight children. After his {{secondary}} education at the Bolongo seminary, he attended the Jesuit University Centre in Kisantu, graduating from the school's administrative sciences division. One of Lihau's teachers, sociologist Willy De Craemer, resolved to help him enroll in the Université catholique de Louvain in Belgium, a school mostly unavailable to Congolese. To do this, De Craemer tutored him in Latin, Greek, and Flemish so <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>take</b> the Jury Central entrance exam. Lihau passed the test with a high score and {{was admitted to the}} university. Since it was his goal to study law (not permitted to Congolese students at the time), De Craemer and several sympathetic Jesuit educators arranged for Lihau to take the necessary classes under the cover of studying Roman philology. He also studied economics and philosophy. For the duration of his studies he stayed with the family of a former director of Léopoldville Radio, Karel Theunissen. Lihau {{served as president of the}} small Congolese-Ruanda-Urundi students' union in Belgium, Association Générale des Étudiants Congolais en Belgique (AGEC).|$|E

5|$|The squad {{turned in}} a decent ride in the stage 2 team time trial, {{finishing}} ninth of 22 teams. The result installed Vinokourov into 27th place, 32 seconds off the race lead. Vinokourov took third in stage 4 on the Mûr-de-Bretagne, one of only ten riders to finish together {{at the front of}} the race. He moved up six places to 18th with this result. In stage 8 on Super Besse, Vinokourov and 's Juan Antonio Flecha put in an attack that constituted a clear bid to take the yellow jersey. Starting the day 32 seconds back of race leader Thor Hushovd, Vinokourov surged past Flecha and all remaining members of the morning breakaway other than eventual stage winner Rui Costa. He occupied second position on the road, holding a sufficient time gap that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>take</b> the race leadership, until he was reabsorbed by the depleted front peloton and finished at the back of that group. The result did, however, move Vinokourov up to 11th.|$|E
5|$|Writer Mike Scully came up {{with the}} idea for the plot because he used to live in West Springfield, Massachusetts and he would ask his parents if <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>take</b> the bus to Springfield, Massachusetts and they finally agreed to let him one day. The {{production}} team faced several challenges during development of this episode. The animators had to come up with a special mouth chart to draw Bart's mouth with the joke teeth in. The pile of dead animals in the back of Cletus' truck originally included dead puppies, but the animators thought it was too sad, so they removed them. Scully used to write jokes for Yakov Smirnoff so he called him up to get the signs in Russian. Dan Castellaneta had to learn proper Russian pronunciation so he could speak it during the chess scene in which he voiced the Russian chess player.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{the third}} period Eric Staal tied the game at seven with his first goal of the game. Minutes later Duchene got a breakaway, but before <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>take</b> a shot, Ovechkin threw his stick at the puck, {{resulting}} in the first penalty shot in All-Star game history, and only the third penalty assessed during the past ten years of All-Star competition. Duchene took the shot against Henrik Lundqvist, who stopped the attempt. Kris Letang scored shortly after the penalty shot to give back the lead to Team Staal. Briere scored a little over a minute later assisted by Weber and Henrik Sedin to re-tie the game. Weber's assist was his fourth of the game making him the second defenceman in history to record four assists in an All-Star Game (Ray Bourque, 1985). Team Lidstrom added two more goals before Rick Nash scored to cut the deficit to one. With about {{a minute and a half}} left in the game, Team Staal pulled their goaltender for the extra attacker. The decision backfired as Eriksson scored on the empty net with 1:11 remaining. Eric Staal scored with 33.6 seconds remaining to bring his team back within one goal, but they failed to get another shot on goal before time ran out. By coming back from a four-goal deficit to win the game Team Lidstrom set the record for biggest comeback victory in All-Star history. Lidstrom finished the game with a +7 rating, the highest rating since 1991 when Adam Oates was also a +7 for the Wales Conference. Tim Thomas earned the victory becoming the first goaltender to win three straight All-Star Games. Patrick Sharp was named Most Valuable Player (MVP) after registering one goal and two assists in a losing cause for Team Staal. The combined 21 goals was the fourth highest total in NHL All-Star Game history.|$|E
