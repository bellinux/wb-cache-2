25|$|The BP {{oil spill}} in the Gulf of Mexico {{affected}} Florida's number one industry, which is tourism. The lack of a relief well prevented company officials from shutting down the leak immediately. Instead, it took months to drill a new relief well, while {{millions of gallons of}} oil gushed into the Gulf each week. In response, Grayson introduced the Emergency Relief Well Act, which would require that an emergency relief well be drilled {{at the same time as}} any new <b>exploratory</b> <b>well.</b>|$|E
500|$|At [...] CDT on 20 April 2010, {{during the}} final phases of {{drilling}} the <b>exploratory</b> <b>well</b> at Macondo, a geyser of seawater erupted from the marine riser onto the rig, shooting [...] into the air. [...] This was soon followed by the eruption of a slushy combination of drilling mud, methane gas, and water. The gas component of the slushy material quickly transitioned into a fully gaseous state and then ignited {{into a series of}} explosions and then a firestorm. An attempt was made to activate the blowout preventer, but it failed. The final defense to prevent an oil spill, a device known as a blind shear ram, was activated but failed to plug the well.|$|E

Deepwater Horizon was still working on the Macondo site on 20 April 2010, when a violent explosion occurred leading to destruction of the rig and resulting oil spill. The well was {{in the final stages}} of completion at the time; its cement casing was injected and hardening, and the rig was due to move shortly to its next role as a semi-permanent production platform at the Nile site followed by a return to the Kaskida field; squatting semi-permanently over an oil dome 50 miles off the coast of Louisiana. The exploratory work was described as [...] "concluded" [...] and permission had already been requested from MMS to terminate operations at the Macondo site.|$|E

40|$|Basin, Ghana. Ten (10) samples {{each of the}} drilled {{cuttings}} {{from the}} three key <b>exploratory</b> <b>wells</b> were geochemically characterized for total organic carbon contents (TOC), rock-eval pyrolysis techniques and vitrinite reflectance measurements (Ro). The results revealed that they have fair to good total organic carbon (TOC) contents, suggesting that there might exist conditions in the Saltpond Basin that favour organic matter production and preservation. The rock-eval results showed that all the samples from the 3 <b>exploratory</b> <b>wells</b> contain predominantly types II and III kerogen with a capacity to generate gas-oil and gas respectively. They have good generation potential. Results of the vitrinite reflectance measurement also reveal that all the samples from the 3 <b>exploratory</b> <b>wells</b> have poor to low source-rock grade.

2500|$|Ten years later, SDC was recommissioned {{to drill}} an <b>exploratory</b> <b>well</b> for Encana Oil & Gas at the McCovey {{prospect}} off Alaska. After {{a month and}} a half of preparations, the rig was towed back to the Beaufort Sea in July 2002 by two icebreakers, Arctic Kalvik and Kigoria, which completed the [...] tow from Port Clarence in just 12 days. The preparations for the winter were stopped on 15 August for about two months to avoid disturbing the bowhead whaling season. Drilling of the well, located in only [...] of water, began on 6 December 2002 and was completed on 27 January 2003. With no immediate drilling work available for SDC, the rig was towed to Thetis Bay where it had previously been stored for two winters. In 2003, the ownership of the drilling unit was passed to a Liberian-registered company, SDC Drilling Inc, and both SDC and SDC II were reflagged to Liberia.|$|E
