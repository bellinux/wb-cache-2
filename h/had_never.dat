5|$|One man in {{the village}} could {{accurately}} mimic the sound of many animals, and when asked to imitate the kilopilopitsofy, he made noises {{very similar to that}} of a hippopotamus, even though he <b>had</b> <b>never</b> left the island and said he <b>had</b> <b>never</b> seen an African hippo.

5|$|Despite Sheila's erratic mental state, her {{psychiatrist}} {{told the}} court {{that the kind of}} violence necessary to commit the murders was not consistent with his view of her.

Her ex-husband said the same: that, despite her tendency to throw things and sometimes hit him, she <b>had</b> <b>never</b> harmed the children. June Bamber's sister, Pamela Boutflour, testified that Sheila was not a violent person and that she <b>had</b> <b>never</b> known her to use a gun; June's niece, Ann Eaton, {{told the court}} that Sheila did not know how to use one. Bamber disputed this, telling police on the night of the shooting, as they stood outside the house, that he and Sheila had gone target shooting together. He acknowledged later that he had not seen her fire a gun as an adult.|$|E
