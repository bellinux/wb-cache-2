The three rooms are shown behind a department store window, outside which a crowd of observers form.

[...] Truitt was especially inspired by the [...] "universe of blue paint" [...] and the subtle modulation and shades of color in Newman's Onement VI. The singularity of the Abstract Expressionists that she observed in work by Barnett Newman and Ad Reinhardt struck Truitt and sparked a turning point in her work.|$|R
