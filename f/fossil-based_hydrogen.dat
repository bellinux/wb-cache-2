40|$|Industrial {{hydrogen}} production via alkaline water electrolysis (AEL) is a mature {{hydrogen production}} method. One {{argument in favor}} of AEL when supplied with renewable energy is its environmental superiority against conventional <b>fossil-based</b> <b>hydrogen</b> production. However, today electricity from the national grid is widely utilized for industrial applications of AEL. Also, the ban on asbestos membranes led to a change in performance patterns, making a detailed assessment necessary. This study presents a comparative Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) using the GaBi software (version 6. 115, thinkstep, Leinfelden-Echterdingen, Germany), revealing inventory data and environmental impacts for industrial hydrogen production by latest AELs (6 MW, Zirfon membranes) in three different countries (Austria, Germany and Spain) with corresponding grid mixes. The results confirm the dependence of most environmental effects from the operation phase and specifically the site-dependent electricity mix. Construction of system components and the replacement of cell stacks make a minor contribution. At present, considering the three countries, AEL can be operated in the most environmentally friendly fashion in Austria. Concerning the construction of AEL plants the materials nickel and polytetrafluoroethylene in particular, used for cell manufacturing, revealed significant contributions to the environmental burden...|$|E
40|$|The {{implementation}} of CO 2 capture into biohydrogen-production systems {{is seen as}} a potential solution for greening the energy sector. However, the performance of biocapture strategies needs to be assessed thoroughly in order to guarantee their suitability. In this work, the Life Cycle Assessment methodology is used to evaluate an energy system producing hydrogen from short-rotation poplar biomass through gasification coupled with carbon dioxide capture. The biomass feedstock is dried and milled before being fed to a low-pressure char-indirect gasifier. The syngas produced is conditioned and undergoes a water gas shift process. Biohydrogen is separated from the rest of compounds in a pressure swing adsorption (PSA) unit. The PSA off-gas is burnt for electricity production and the exhaust gas from this power-generation section goes through a two-stage gas separation membrane process for CO 2 capture. The results show that the system succeeds in obtaining a negative (i. e., favourable) global warming impact with a low cumulative non-renewable energy demand. Direct emissions to the air, external electricity production and biomass production are the key processes contributing to the evaluated impacts. When it comes to replacing conventional (<b>fossil-based)</b> <b>hydrogen,</b> the biohydrogen product is found to be a better alternative than biohydrogen without CO 2 capture only under global warming aspects...|$|E
40|$|Presented at the National Hydrogen Association Annual Hydrogen Conference (NHA 2005), Washington, DC, March 29 - April 1, 2005 The use of {{hydrogen}} as a light-duty transportation fuel requires {{the development of}} a widespread regional hydrogen infrastructure, including production facilities, a distribution network, and refueling stations. In the case of <b>fossil-based</b> <b>hydrogen</b> production with carbon capture and sequestration, additional infrastructure is needed for CO 2 disposal. If construction of this infrastructure is to proceed, it is necessary to identify strategies for minimizing the cost while maximizing the utility during the transition. We have developed an infrastructure model that identifies the major parameters that determine infrastructure cost and uses a geographic information system (GIS) to apply these parameters to optimize infrastructure design for a given region. In this paper, the model is applied to a regional case study of a potential coalbased hydrogen economy in Ohio with CO 2 capture and sequestration. The objective is to model the optimal hydrogen infrastructure design for the entire state under different market penetration scenarios. GIS facilitates this analysis by allowing one to use existing spatially-referenced data, such as population distribution, coal resources, existing infrastructure, and CO 2 sequestration sites, to calculate the location and magnitude {{of hydrogen}} demand and optimize the placement of production facilities and pipeline networks for transporting hydrogen and carbon dioxide. Engineering/economic models that identify the costs and technical performance of infrastructure components allow for the calculation of the costs, energy usage and emissions of different hydrogen infrastructure options. Based on these parameters, it is possible to identify the lowest cost infrastructure design for supplying hydrogen to users under multiple scenarios. The goal of this research is to increase understanding of the economics and design issues related to hydrogen infrastructure development under real-world constraints.
