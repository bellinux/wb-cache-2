Further, this effort identified the mechanism by which gray iron age strengthens and the mechanism by which age-strengthening improves the machinability of gray cast iron. These results were then used to determine whether age strengthening improves the machinability of ductile iron and compacted graphite iron alloys in order to develop a predictive model of alloy factor effects on age strengthening. The results of this work will lead to reduced section sizes, and corresponding weight and energy savings. Improved machinability will reduce scrap and enhance casting marketability. Technical Conclusions: ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ Age strengthening was demonstrated to occur in gray iron ductile iron and compacted graphite iron. ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ Machinability was demonstrated to be improved by age strengthening when <b>free</b> <b>ferrite</b> was present in the microstructure, but not in a fully pearlitic microstructure. ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ Age strengthening only occurs when there is residual nitrogen in solid solution in the Ferrite, whether the ferrite is <b>free</b> <b>ferrite</b> or the ferrite lamellae within pearlite. ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ Age strengthening can be accelerated by Mn at about 0. 5 % in excess of the Mn/S balance Estimated energy savings over ten years is 13. 05 trillion BTU, based primarily on yield improvement and size reduction of castings for equivalent service. Also it is estimated that the heavy truck end use of lighter castings for equivalent service requirement will result in a diesel fuel energy savings of 131 trillion BTU over ten years...|$|E

40|$|Ultrahigh-carbon {{steel wire}} can achieve very high {{strength}} after severe plastic deformation, {{because of the}} fine, stable substructures produce. Tensile strengths approaching 6000 MPa are predicted for UHCS containing 1. 8 %C. This paper discusses the microstructural evolution during drawing of UHCS wire, the resulting strength produced and the factors influencing fracture.

40|$|The 1970 ’s saw {{the demand}} for more fuel {{efficient}} vehicles. This necessitated lighter automobiles, and was partly attained by lowering {{the weight of the}} coil springs used for the suspensions of these vehicles. Substantial weight reductions were achieved with new steels such as SUP 7, with their elevated carbon and silicon contents allowing the springs to operate at higher stresses. However, these steels are prone to decarburisation during spring manufacture, which sharply reduces the sag resistance and the fatigue strength of the springs. The literature pertaining to the decarburisation of high silicon spring steels is limited, despite the subsequent reduced sag and fatigue properties. The research detailed in this thesis was therefore undertaken to investigate the decarburisation of spring steels with 0 to 3 wt. % silicon for a range of temperatures and heat treatment atmospheres. The austenitisation of these steels was also investigated to provide complementary information. Austenitisation and decarburisation heat treatments were undertaken with 0, 1 and 3 wt. % silicon experimental steels, and the commercially available 2 wt. % silicon SUP 7 and SUP 7 NV steels. These five steels have similar carbon, manganese and chromium contents. Two dimensional austenite growth occurred for the different steels, with the austenite grain shape inherited from the initial ferrite grain structure. The austenitisation accelerated with increasing temperature, with the higher silicon steels exhibiting faster transformation kinetics at comparable intercritical fractional superheat temperatures due to the higher Ac₁ and Ac₃ temperatures. The austenite growth was controlled by the substitutional diffusion of the alloy elements at low intercritical temperatures, and by carbon diffusion through the austenite at higher temperatures. This resulted in the faster transformation of ferrite/spheroidal cementite initial microstructures than pearlitic microstructures at low intercritical temperatures, and the opposite at higher temperatures. Austenite nucleated earlier in ferrite/spheroidal cementite initial microstructures when the cementite particles were located predominantly on the ferrite grain boundaries of the initial structures rather than within the ferrite grains. The austenite growth eventually became faster for the latter structure. An increasing silicon content up to 2 wt. % increased the rate of carbon removal at comparable temperatures. Multiple linear regression analysis demonstrated that the mass of carbon removed during decarburisation increased with silicon contents up to 2 wt. %, with temperature, and with PH₂O/PH₂ ratios of 0. 01 to 0. 25, while manganese decreased the decarburisation. However, slower decarburisation resulted for the 3 % Silicon steel, especially at higher temperatures and lower PH₂O/PH₂ ratios, where a dense oxide layer strongly inhibited carbon removal. The decarburisation of the 1 % Silicon, SUP 7 and SUP 7 NV steels was fastest at their respective Ac₃ temperatures. Columnar <b>free</b> <b>ferrite</b> grain structures were obtained for the 0 % Silicon and SUP 7 steels, compared with equiaxed grains for the 1 % Silicon, SUP 7 NV and 3 % Silicon steels. The decarburisation of SUP 7 was fastest when the specimen was heated in the furnace with the heat treatment atmosphere already established, while slower decarburisation resulted when the specimens were annealed in inert atmospheres prior to the introduction of the decarburisation atmosphere. Different initial SUP 7 microstructures influenced the carbon release kinetics as the specimens heated to temperature. Prolonged decarburisation of SUP 7 and SUP 7 NV at 900 °C yielded decreasing <b>free</b> <b>ferrite</b> depths after 4 hr, despite continued carbon removal from the steel. This research contributes {{to the understanding of the}} austenitisation and decarburisation of spring steels.

40|$|The {{response}} of materials to shock loading {{has been investigated}} through use of a plate impact experimental technique. A single stage gas gun was utilized to drive projectiles to velocities between 50 - 500 m/s, facilitating investigations into low to moderate shock loading conditions. Temporal records of the dynamic events were captured {{with the use of}} commercial manganin stress gauges that were embedded within layers of test material. Within this thesis, there is a bimodal theme. The first portion of this thesis investigated the spall fracture of cast irons with varying microstructure. Although the study of the spall fracture of materials is a common theme in literature, there exists a noteworthy scarcity of research specific to cast iron. Given that cast iron {{is one of the most}} widely utilized materials in engineering structures, this research was pursued in an effort to characterize its strength and identify the fracture mechanisms and kinetics associated with its failure process. The second portion of this thesis involved the development of a new technique that could be utilized to generate multiple Hugoniot states in a single experiment. Generation of a material’s Hugoniot is a fundamental theme in shock wave studies because it allows researchers to determine all mechanical and thermodynamic properties associated with dynamic loading conditions. Traditionally, the locus of points necessary to construct a material’s Hugoniot is obtained through a rigorous series of experiments, where each test produces a single data set. By considering the shock wave processes associated with layered plates, a new method was developed that will significantly reduce the process of obtaining material Hugoniots. Within the study of the spall fracture of cast iron, experiments were designed to induce an extreme tensile state within test samples from the interaction of decompression waves. The dynamic fracture strength, known as spall strength, was determined from temporal records of the stress evolution inside the samples. In order to encompass a vast majority of castings typical to industry, five separate cast irons were tested. Four of these castings consisted of gray cast iron with graphite in flake form, where three were classified as Type VII A 2 and the other contained a bimodal distribution of Type VII A 4 and VII D 8. The fifth casting consisted of ductile cast iron with graphite in nodular form, classified as Type I with an average of 200 nodules per square millimeter of size class 5. The spall strength for the Type VII A 2 gray cast irons was found to vary 40 - 370 MPa, and the additional gray cast iron was found to vary between 410 - 490 MPa. The spall strength of the ductile cast iron was found to fall within the range of 0. 94 - 1. 2 GPa. It was shown that the spall strength is linked to the damage level at the spall plane, where an increased amount of tensile stress is required to generate higher levels of damage. Post mortem analysis was performed on recovered samples in order to establish a relationship between microstructure and the fracture mechanisms of the failure process. This study has identified the graphite phase as the primary factor governing the spall fracture of cast irons, where crack nucleation is directly correlated to the debonding of graphite from the metal matrix. It has been noted that the average length of graphite found within a casting is linked to the material’s strength, where strength has been shown to increase as a function of decreasing length. The morphology, and mean free path of graphite precipitates, has been shown to further govern the subsequent coalescence of initiated cracks to form a complete fracture plane. In cases where graphite spacing is large, an increased amount of energy is required to complete the fracture process. A secondary factor governing the spall fracture of cast irons has been linked to the microstructure of the metal matrix. It has been noted that pearlite will yield higher spall strengths in cast irons than <b>free</b> <b>ferrite.</b> Within the second portion of this thesis, an experimental approach was developed to induce shock reflections in a low impedance inner-layer embedded within a high impedance bulk structure. By capturing temporal records of the stress evolution at each side of the inner-layer, step-like loading profiles were obtained that allowed for the capture of multiple Hugoniot states. The mathematical framework employed in this technique utilized the classical Rankine-Hugoniot equations in the method of impedance matching, where either the bulk material (case 1) or inner-layer (case 2) was required to have a known Hugoniot. Validation of the new technique was performed by testing well classified materials in order to facilitate comparison of the Hugoniots generated from the method with published data found in literature. For the first case, where the Hugoniot of the bulk material is known, the Hugoniot Ring-Up Method (HRUM) was shown to accurately generate states along the Hugoniot of the inner-layer, where the number of states acquired is directly linked to the experimental design. Factors including the wave velocities in the materials, input pulse duration (controlled by the thickness and wave velocity of the impactor), thickness of the innerlayer, and diameter of the test samples (arrival of the radial release) affect the number of states that can be generated from a single experiment. Experiments employing 6061 aluminum and polycarbonate, respectively, as the bulk material and inner-layer, accurately generated six Hugoniot states for polycarbonate. Additionally, experiments employing A 572 grade 50 structural steel as the bulk material were able to accurately generate ten Hugoniot states of the polycarbonate inner-layer. In these experiments, the method was extended to generate a Hugoniot equation defining the material {{response of}} the inner-layer within the domain encompassed by the specific test. Through comparison of these experimentally determined equations to the real Hugoniot of polycarbonate, it has been shown that a single HRUM experiment can yield an accurate Hugoniot for the inner-layer. For the second case, when the Hugoniot of the inner-layer is known, the HRUM failed to accurately generate states along the Hugoniot of the bulk material. Thus, the HRUM requires significant improvements before it can be used in this application. In light of these shortcomings, a procedure utilizing over-deterministic methodology has been proposed, that may allow future researchers to extend application of the HRUM to the case of determining the Hugoniot of the bulk material...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{studies using}} atom probe {{tomography}} (APT) show that bainitic ferrite formed at low temperature contains more carbon {{than what is}} consistent with the paraequilibrium phase diagram. However, nanocrystalline bainitic ferrite exhibits a non-homogeneous distribution of carbon atoms in arrangements with specific compositions, i. e. Cottrell atmospheres, carbon clusters, and carbides, in most cases with a size of a few nanometers. The ferrite volume within a single platelet that is free of these carbon-enriched regions is extremely small. Proximity histograms can be compromised on the ferrite side, {{and a great deal of}} care should be taken to estimate the carbon content in regions of bainitic <b>ferrite</b> <b>free</b> from carbon agglomeration. For this purpose, APT measurements were first validated for the ferritic phase in a pearlitic sample and further performed for the bainitic ferrite matrix in high-silicon steels isothermally transformed between 200 °C and 350 °C. Additionally, results were compared with the carbon concentration values derived from X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses considering a tetragonal lattice and previous APT studies. The present results reveal a strong disagreement between the carbon content values in the bainitic ferrite matrix as obtained by APT and those derived from XRD measurements. Those differences have been attributed to the development of carbon-clustered regions with an increased tetragonality in a carbon-depleted matrix.

40|$|The {{effect of}} varying welding {{conditions}} on multipass weld metal {{has been investigated}} in all-weld test plates produced by flux cored arc (FCA) welding. The principal welding conditions varied for the test samples in the current research program were heat input (between approximately 1 and 2. 5 kJ/mm), welding technique (stringer or weave beads), shielding gas, welding position (flat or vertical) and consumable type. Mechanical testing of weld metal included tensile testing and Charpy-vee-notch impact tests over a range of temperatures from - 60 °C to 40 °C. The tensile testing results showed that yield and tensile strength generally decreased with increasing heat input and that the changes were {{of the order of}} 100 MPa. Impact properties showed more varied behaviour depending on consumable type. The effect of varying welding conditions on some less commonly studied microstructural factors has also been investigated, such as proportions of reheated and double-reheated regions and mean free path (MFP) in various distinctive microstructural zones. Using the simplifying assumption that the structural gradient the heat affected zone (HAZ) of reheated weld metal can be characterized in terms of three regions: the grain coarsened, GC; grain refined, GR and intercritical, IC heat affected regions; a second overlapping weld bead creates double-reheated weld metal structures which can be defined in terms of 9 sub-zones: GC-GC, GC-GR, GC-IC, GRGC, GR-GR, GR-IC, IC-GC, IC-GR, IC-IC. Linear and areal measurement techniques have been used on cross-sections of seventeen test plates to determine the volume fractions of solidified weld metal (SW), GC, GR and IC sub-zones of the reheated weld metal and the double-reheated zone. The hardness variation in the sub-zones and the influence of welding conditions has also been investigated in the present research. The mean free path was determined for SW, GC, GR and IC regions and the overall average mean <b>free</b> path of <b>ferrite</b> in each weld was also calculated to provide a characteristic length of the totality of the structural microconstituents in the weld metal. Strong relationships were found between mean free path and heat input and also with the strength of the weld metal. In contrast, toughness correlated poorly with overall mean free path. Impact toughness {{is one of the most}} important mechanical properties of welds. Assessment and understanding of the impact properties of welds is central to the avoidance of catastrophic failure of welded steel structures. Neural networks analysis has been used for the purpose of assessing which factors are beneficial to the low temperature impact properties of steel welds in order to obtain practical guidance as to how impact properties might be improved in FCA welds. Four major data fields were involved in the training of the neural networks: chemical composition, microstructure, non-metallic inclusions and welding condition. The backpropagation algorithm was used for the analysis. Sensitivity analysis of the neural network model revealed that the characteristics of the non-metallic inclusion distribution exerted only a small direct influence on toughness. In contrast, chemical composition and microstructure were indicated to be very important. In particular the toughness is predicted to increase with increasing % acicular ferrite and % reaustenitised region and these factors in turn are sensitive to the selected FCAW process and the welding conditions...|$|R
