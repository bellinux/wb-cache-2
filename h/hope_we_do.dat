6000|$|It {{was always}} the unexpected, certainly, that {{happened}} from the Altrurian. [...] "It is merely this," [...] he said: [...] "Having come to live rightly upon earth, as we believe, or having at least ceased to deny God in our statutes and customs, the fear of death, as it once, weighed upon us, has been lifted from our souls. The mystery of it {{has so far been}} taken away that we perceive it as something just and natural. Now that all unkindness has been banished from among us, we can conceive of no such cruelty as death once seemed. If we do not know yet the full meaning of death, we know that the Creator of it and of us meant mercy and blessing by it. When one dies we grieve, but not as those without <b>hope.</b> <b>We</b> <b>do</b> not say that the dead have gone to a better place, and then selfishly bewail them, for we have the kingdom of heaven upon earth already, and we know that wherever they go they will be homesick for Altruria; and when we think of the years that may pass before we meet them again our hearts ache, as theirs must. But the presence of the risen Christ in our daily lives is our assurance that no one ceases to be, and that we shall see our dead again. I cannot explain this to you; I can only affirm it." ...|$|E

40|$|This book {{potentially}} {{addresses a}} real need for schools {{to come to}} terms with on a general level – that of encouraging open dialogue both in school and with the community, and treating pupils with respect. Education generally have {{to come to terms}} with the religious values of pupils and parents, and have the confidence to know how to scaffold learning based on these values. This interest in ethos and school climate is of great interest to CPD. This book is however not the ideal text for this: its style is not accessible; in another book the author disrespectfully calls pupils “buggers”. It is too focused on the world of religious education, which will confine its readership. However, I <b>hope</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not because of these weaknesses lose sight of the central positive message...|$|E

40|$|At {{one point}} in Sir Philip Sidney's The Countess of Pembroke's Arcadia (The Old Arcadia), the Amazon Cleophila (the crossdressed hero Pyrocles) "laying fast hold of Philoclea's face with her eyes... sang these sapphics, {{speaking}} as it were to her own hope. " Although {{the content of the}} verses Cleophila sings to the woman she loves is somewhat conventional ("If mine eyes can speak to do hearty errand, / Or mine eyes' language she do hap to judge of, / So that eyes' message be of her received, / <b>Hope,</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> live yet" [A, 73]), the explicit identification of their form as "sapphics" has, I argue, a different conventional resonance. In her edition of The Old Arcadia, Katherine Duncan-Jones footnotes this moment with the comment that "it is appropriate that the first poem sung by Pyrocles while he is disguised as a woman should be in the verse form associated with the best known Greek poetess," yet mentions no other association with Sappho save her gender and profession. In this essay I discuss what "sapphics," a poetic ode in quatrain stanza form with a complex metrical scheme named after the poet Sappho (7 th century BCE), might have connoted to a seventeenth-century writer and audience. I focus on the function and place of Sidney's sapphics in both the narrative context of a crossdressed character who elicits a complicated matrix of desires (Philoclea falls for Cleophila when she hears the sapphics), and in a text explicitly addressed to women. I argue that the dedication to and interpellation of women in The Old Arcadia is not simply titular or conventional but an integral part of its poetics. In addition to examining the specific place of the sapphics in Sidney's romance, I look at the textual means by which Sappho and sapphics circulated in the early modern period. I argue that the sapphics Sidney uses in the First Eclogues and the sapphic variations that appear elsewhere in The Old Arcadia are not merely metrical experiments. Rather, Sidney's sapphics invoke and enact female agency, desire and homoeroticism, and this specific invocation of female desire is part of the "hidden design" of The Old Arcadia. Sidney's sapphics, and the way the text draws reader attention to them, including the detailed record of Philoclea's sexual response to the sapphics, solicit a moment of undeniable female-female desire. Such attention suggests that the invisibility, or what Valerie Traub has called the "(in) significance," of lesbian desire in the early modern period—in both primary texts and secondary criticism—is not absolute, particularly to readers in the know. The sapphics invoke female homoeroticism in the story line of the Arcadia, but they may also have encoded a register of desire which early modern writers employed specifically to appeal to women readers. Sidney's sapphics have historical and literary associations at work which no one—with the important exception of Elizabeth Harvey, who noted that Sidney translated Sappho's "Ode to Aphrodite" into anacreontics in the Second Eclogues of the Arcadia—has addressed. The fact that Sidney's anacreontics (a metrical verse form associated with Sappho) are a translation of Sappho's ode and are, like the First Eclogue's sapphics discussed above, addressed by the Amazon Cleophila to the desirous Philoclea suggests that Sidney was versed in Sappho lore and knew the content as well as the form of her poems (enough so to deploy them in an explicitly homoerotic context). When Jonathan Goldberg asks what Spenser's imitations of Virgil, a classical poet associated with male homoeroticism, might mean to an audience—"Where does the literary allusion place the erotics of Spenser's text?"—he asks a question that should also be asked of Sidney's sapphics: where, if anywhere, do the Arcadia's literary invocations of Sappho place the erotics of Sidney's work, and what {{does this have to do}} with interpretive communities...|$|E

40|$|Evidence based {{library and}} {{information}} practice (EBLIP) {{is a strategy}} to bridge research and practice. Generally EBLIP {{is seen as a}} movement to encourage and give practitioners the means to incorporate research into their practice, where it previously may have been lacking. The widely accepted definition of EBLIP (Booth, 2000) stresses three aspects that contribute to a practice that is evidence based: 1) "the best available evidence;" 2) "moderated by user needs and preferences;" 3) "applied {{to improve the quality of}} professional judgements. " The area that the EBLIP movement has focused on is how to create and understand the best available research evidence. CE courses, critical appraisal checklists, and many articles have been written to address a need for librarian education in this area, and it seems that strides have been made. But very little in the EBLIP literature talks about how we make professional judgements, or moderate evidence based on our user needs and preferences. Likewise, how do we make good evidence based decisions when our evidence base is weak. These things seem to be elements we just take for granted or can’t translate into words. It is in keeping with tacit knowledge that librarians just seem to have or acquire skills with education and on the job experience. Tacit knowledge is "knowledge that is not easily articulated, and frequently involves knowledge of how to do things. We can infer its existence only by observing behaviour and determining that this sort of knowledge is a precondition for effective performance" (Patel, Arocha, & Kaufman, 1999, p. 78). It is something that is difficult to translate into an article or guideline for how we work. I think of this area as the "art" of evidence based practice. And the art is crucial to being an evidence based practitioner. Science = systematized knowledge, explicit research, methodological examination, investigation, data Art = professional knowledge of your craft, intuition, experience, tacit knowledge, reflection, creativity, values, people-skills Both science and art are important and I <b>hope</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not measure their worth against one another. Rather, we need to recognize that both elements contribute to good decision making and practice improvement. Without taking research evidence into consideration, we would be lacking scientific knowledge that helps us gain a deeper understanding of our profession. This needs to be continually renewed and paid attention. However, without the art side of the equation, meaning and context may easily be lost. Someone can gather all the best evidence, but not know how to effectively implement it. Or if you are overly reliant on perfect evidence before you make a decision that is in the best interest of your community, you will likely lag behind and not serve people’s needs. No research study, no matter how perfectly conducted is going to provide all the answers for what we do in practice. We need to embrace both the science and the art of evidence based practice – otherwise, we will overlook important elements of the whole situation that practitioners work within. Doing so is not neat and tidy, but does that really matter? LIS is a social science, and the "social" implies "messy" because people and real-life situations are not easily controlled. The art of our craft allows us to embrace the messy situation, find ways to be creative, put our professional judgements to use and find the best solutions to meet the needs of individual users by applying the best of what we find in the research literature together with the best of what we know is likely to help this person. My purely unscientific judgement as a practitioner is that LIS practice is probably 30 % science and 70 % art (more or lessdepending upon the specific topic). As such, I think that we cannot ignore the art of evidence based practice, and in fact should begin thinking about ways to be better artists as well as better scientists. Within this journal, the Using Evidence in Practice section brings together the science and art of evidence based practice. In this section, practitioners recount how they used evidence to assist with their practice decisions. They also provide details of non-research evidence or situations that impact their judgements, and at the end of the piece they reflect on the overall process and how their practice may be improved in the future. I hope these experiences inspire readers, and make the connections between science and art more obvious...|$|E
