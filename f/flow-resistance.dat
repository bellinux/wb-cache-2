40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIM: Patients with non-obstructive {{dysphagia}} (NOD) report {{symptoms of}} impaired esophageal bolus transit without evidence of bolus stasis. In such patients, manometric investigation may diagnose esophageal motility disorders; however, many have normal motor patterns. We hypothesized {{that patients with}} NOD would demonstrate evidence of high <b>flow-resistance</b> during bolus passage which in turn would relate to the reporting of bolus hold up perception. METHODS: Esophageal pressure-impedance recordings of 5 mL liquid and viscous swallows from 18 NOD patients (11 male; 19 - 71 years) and 17 control subjects (9 male; 25 - 60 years) were analyzed. The relationship between intrabolus pressure and bolus flow timing in the esophagus was assessed using the pressure flow index (PFI). Bolus perception was assessed swallow by swallow using standardized descriptors. RESULTS: NOD patients were characterized by a higher PFI than controls. The PFI defined a pressure-flow abnormality in all patients who appeared normal based on the assessment esophageal motor patterns and bolus clearance. The PFI was higher for individual swallows during which subjects reported perception of bolus passage. CONCLUSION: Bolus <b>flow-resistance</b> is higher in NOD patients compared with controls as well as higher in relation to perception of bolus transit, suggesting {{the presence of an}} esophageal motility disorder despite normal findings on conventional analysis.

40|$|We {{measured}} the <b>flow-resistance</b> of five commercially available 10 cm H 2 O expiratory positive-pressure (EPP) valves (n = five per valve type) at bias flows of between 0 and 2, 000 ml/s. We found that individual valves {{of each type}} and manufacturer functioned similarly. Different valve types, however, functioned differently: with one type, system pressure was higher than rated (p < 0. 05), and with another type, system pressure was significantly flow-dependent (p < 0. 01). The remaining types of valves had no flow-resistive properties and maintained a system pressure of 10 cm H 2 O. We conclude that system pressure is not similar in all continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) systems using bias flow and EPP valves. The work of breathing imposed by CPAP circuits will be increased in systems whose EPP valves have flow-dependent properties...|$|E
40|$|This paper deduces a new <b>flow-resistance</b> {{equation}} for {{open-channel flow}} applying dimensional analysis and self-similarity theory. The incomplete self-similarity hypothesis {{is used to}} establish the flow velocity distribution whose integration gives the theoretical expression of the Darcy-Weisbach friction factor. The theoretical resistance equation then is tested by the available field measurements of flow velocity, water depth, river width and bed slope carried out in 653 reaches of several Canadian mountain streams. A relationship between the G function of the velocity profile and the channel slope and the flow Froude number is also established. The analysis shows that the Darcy- Weisbach friction factor can be accurately estimated by the proposed theoretical approach based on a power-velocity profile. Finally, the Darcy-Weisbach friction factor values obtained by the proposed theoretical resistance law are compared with those estimated by the approach of Rickenmann and Recking...|$|E
40|$|The Savonius rotor {{can develop}} a {{relatively}} high torque at low rotational speeds and is cheap to build, but it harnesses {{only a small fraction}} of the wind energy incident upon it. One initially attractive proposal for augmenting its harnessing effectiveness, was to fit an array of hinged flaps in place of the curved parts of the turbine's blades. The flaps open automatically as a result of wind pressure when they advance into the wind (and hence experience less <b>flow-resistance),</b> but close (again automatically) when retreating from the wind, i. e. during the power-harnessing part of the cycle. It had been found previously that this arrangement, as required, significantly enhances the static torque imposed by the wind on the rotor. So, in this study, dynamic-torque and power-harnessing tests were carried out for a Savonius rotor as well as for rotors modified with 8 or subsequently 16 hinged flaps. The modified rotors displayed slightly increased torques at low rotational speeds, but the traditional Savonius rotor developed a peak power-coefficient of 18 % compared with only 5 % for the slatted turbines. ...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} the <b>flow-resistance</b> {{of a new}} generation of Heat Moisture Exchanging Filters (HME filters) during 24 h of clinical use. DESIGN: Before-after trial. SETTING: A general Intensive Care Unit of a university hospital. PATIENTS: A consecutive series of 96 patients undergoing mechanical ventilation for respiratory insufficiency of various etiology and severity. METHODS: The characteristics of the secretions collected by tracheal suctioning and the pressure/flow relationship of the HMEs before and after 24 h of clinical use were analyzed. RESULTS: The resistance of the HMEs when dry was 2 hPa/l. s, and it increased to a maximum of 1 hPa/l. s in 83 % of the patients after 24 hours; in four patients with particularly heavy secretions HME resistance was 4 - 5 hPa/l. s. There were no significant modifications of the secretions within the investigation period, excluding, in particular, an increase in density with consequent tracheal tube obstruction. CONCLUSION: The gas conditioning efficiency and design performance of the tested HMEs did not create a significant obstacle to airflow medium term mechanical ventilation; however, these devices should be cautiously used in patients with heavy bronchial secretions...|$|E
40|$|An {{important}} feature of most rivers and canals is their habitats for a rich of aquatic vegetation which is extremely important from an environmental and ecological point of view. These variations in habitat mean that it is rare to find a cross-section of a natural channel which has the same roughness along its perimeter. In these channels, flow conditions lead to a complex flow situation with intensive mass and momentum exchange between main channel and banks, and secondary currents. Therefore the flow structures that occur in these channels are extremely complex. In this research, a method for predicting the total conveyance of trapezoidal channel cross-section with varying roughness in perimeter due to growth of flexible vegetation is developed based on the 2 D velocity distribution in open channel. Where, numerical hydraulic model is coupled with physically based flexible vegetation <b>flow-resistance</b> equation. The study covers three patterns of flexible vegetation growth, the first is vegetation growth on bed and side banks with equal height on both, the second is vegetation growth on bed only and sediment roughness on side banks {{and the third is}} vegetation growth on sid...|$|E
40|$|Background: It {{has been}} shown {{previously}} that conventional ventilation delivered through a long cuffed endotracheal tube {{is associated with a}} high <b>flow-resistance</b> and frequent perioperative complications. Aim: We attempted to supersede the conventional ventilation by high-frequency jet ventilation through a catheter (HFJV-C) and assess safety of the procedure. Material and methods: Using a translaryngeal tracheostomy kit, we performed a translaryngeal (Fantoni) tracheostomy (TLT). Subsequently, we introduced a special 2 -way prototype ventilatory catheter into the trachea via the TLT under bronchoscopic control. Satisfactory HFJV-C ventilation through the catheter was achieved in 218 patients. Results: There were no significant adverse effects on vital signs observed in the cohort during the study. The pH, SpO 2, PaO 2, and PaCO 2 did not change significantly following the HFJV-C. The intrinsic PEEPi measured in trachea did not exceed 4 — 5 cm H 2 O during its application, which was significantly less than during the classical ventilation via the endotracheal tube fluctuating between 12 and 17 cm H 2 O. No serious medical complications occurred.

40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{determine}} whether an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support could be sufficiently conducted by the right ventricle alone {{from the viewpoint of}} the hemodynamics and blood gas state. Six infant dogs underwent a bypass between the left pulmonary artery and left atrium with an in-line oxygenator after a left pneumonectomy. Partial ECMO support was conducted simply by opening the circuit, and total ECMO support was conducted by ligating the right pulmonary artery. After the establishment of partial ECMO, approximately one-third of the right ventricular output was passively shunted through the bypass circuit, and the cardiac index and central venous pressure did not change. The mean pulmonary arterial pressures increased significantly. After a complete ligation of the right pulmonary artery, all 6 dogs survived for 12 h, but the cardiac output and blood pressure decreased significantly. The blood gas state was sufficiently maintained throughout the experiment. The results suggest the possibility of using the pumpless ECMO support. However, the flow resistance of the membrane oxygenator proved to still be too high for use in a total pumpless ECMO. Further studies on long-term ECMO {{and the development of a}} membrane oxygenator with a considerably low <b>flow-resistance</b> are needed. </p...|$|E
40|$|With the advancements {{in quiet}} engine technology, {{reduction}} of the fan noise sources, and use of higher mean flow speeds, the aerodynamic noise generation due to unsteady and turbulent mean flow in the ducts of automotive exhaust muffler may become {{a significant source of}} exhaust noise, thereby limiting the net insertion loss of the muffler. Three-pass double-reversal muffler is often used in automotive exhaust systems. This muffler is characterized by a fairly wide-band transmission loss (TL) curve as well as relatively low back pressure. However in the flow-reversal end chambers, it produces a lot of aerodynamic noise due to impingement of jets on the end plates, generation of free shear layer and vortex shedding. This paper deals with the design and analysis of the muffler with a novel feature (tubular bridges in the end-chambers) specially configured to minimize the free shear layer in the end chambers of the three-pass double-reversal muffler as well as to provide adequate acoustic transmission loss and to further reduce the back pressure of the muffler. The TL curve predicted by means of the 1 -D integrated transfer matrix (ITM) approach is validated against the 3 -D FEM and compared with that of the base muffler (without tubular bridges). Back pressure of the configuration with tubular bridges, estimated by means of the lumped <b>flow-resistance</b> network, is shown to be considerably less than that of the base muffler.

40|$|Fully {{validated}} numerical models {{specifically designed}} for simulating bedload transport dynamics in mountain streams are rare. In this study, the recently developed modelling tool sedFlow {{has been applied to}} simulate bedload transport in the Swiss mountain rivers Kleine Emme and Brenno. It is shown that sedFlow can be used to successfully reproduce observations from historic bedload transport events with plausible parameter set-ups, meaning that calibration parameters are only varied within ranges of uncertainty that have been pre-determined either by previous research or by field observations in the simulated study reaches. In the Brenno river, the spatial distribution of total transport volumes has been reproduced with a Nash–Sutcliffe goodness of fit of 0. 733; this relatively low value is partially due to anthropogenic extraction of sediment that was not considered. In the Kleine Emme river, the spatial distribution of total transport volumes has been reproduced with a goodness of fit of 0. 949. The simulation results shed light on the difficulties that arise with traditional <b>flow-resistance</b> estimation methods when macro-roughness is present. In addition, our results demonstrate that greatly simplified hydraulic routing schemes, such as kinematic wave or uniform discharge approaches, are probably sufficient for a good representation of bedload transport processes in reach-scale simulations of steep mountain streams. The influence of different parameters on simulation results is semi-quantitatively evaluated in a simple sensitivity study. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates the usefulness of sedFlow for a range of practical applications in alpine mountain streams...|$|E
40|$|The discussers congratulate {{the authors}} for their {{systematic}} study of skimming flows on stepped channels with different slopes and step heights. Their experimental data provide a solid database {{that might lead}} to better and improved design criteria. Important out-comes include some estimate of the friction factors for skimming flows and a design flowchart for stepped canals. Despite these outstanding results, the discussers would like to comment con-structively on further design criteria for skimming flows and to provide additional <b>flow-resistance</b> results and a discussion on the physical processes. The authors proposed a chart for the design of stepped chutes that can be applied {{to a wide range of}} channel slopes 5. 7 ° 55 ° and step heights 0. 1 S /dc S /dcs, where S /dcs represents the upper limit for skimming flow regime in terms of relative step height. For larger values, the flow will be a transition flow regime. However hydraulic designers must also consider a minimum value of S /dc, below which the steps no longer act as large roughness. A detailed review of large rough-ness flows demonstrated that the flow resistance decreases with decreasing relative roughness height Chanson 1995, pp. 92 – 96. When the relative step height is small, the roughness of the steps becomes negligible and the flow resistance is drastically reduced. A reanalysis of experimental data on rockfill chutes and large roughness elements suggests a lower limit for the relative step height: S dc 1 15 · co...|$|E
40|$|Numerical {{models of}} {{diffusive}} transport, commonly considered as approximate solvers of the partial differential equation, focus on evaluation of gradients at a point. Gradient-approximation inaccuracies manifest themselves as errors in conductances and capacitances that enter into matrices that are finally solved. In turn, these errors arise {{from a lack}} of consideration of flow geometry in the point’s vicinity. In order to improve accuracy, flow geometry may be incorporated into evaluation of conductances and capacitances by choosing segments of flow tubes as volume elements. Flow tubes, inherent in the initial conditions, can be generated using appropriate interpolation schemes that are built into contouring algorithms. The principal task is to structure contouring tools {{in such a way as}} to generate information to facilitate accurate evaluation of conductances and capacitances. The logical framework of this novel approach is founded on the contributions of Maxwell, who visualized a flow domain as a collection of flow tubes, Ohm, who introduced the notion of resistance of a finite body, and Fick, who introduced a differential equation for diffusive flow through a tube of non-uniform cross section. Computer-graphics capability to implement this approach has become available only over the past two decades. Casting aside the notion of a point, the new paradigm is to evaluate <b>flow-resistance</b> over finite distances. The method suggested is referred to as a Resistance-Integral Natural-Coordinate Method (RINC). Formulated from first principles, this method dispenses with the differential equation as an intermediary to formulate the numerical equations.

40|$|Especially in mountainous environments, the {{prediction}} of sediment dynamics is important for managing natural hazards, assessing in-stream habitats and understanding geomorphic evolution. We present the new modelling tool {sedFlow} for simulating fractional bedload transport dynamics in mountain streams. sedFlow is a one-dimensional model that aims to realistically reproduce the total transport volumes and overall morphodynamic changes resulting from sediment transport events such as major floods. The model is intended for temporal scales from the individual event (several hours to few days) up to longer-term evolution of stream channels (several years). The envisaged spatial scale covers complete catchments at a spatial discretisation of several tens of metres to a few hundreds of metres. sedFlow {{can deal with the}} effects of streambeds that slope uphill in a downstream direction and uses recently proposed and tested approaches for quantifying macro-roughness effects in steep channels. sedFlow offers different options for bedload transport equations, <b>flow-resistance</b> relationships and other elements which can be selected to fit the current application in a particular catchment. Local grain-size distributions are dynamically adjusted according to the transport dynamics of each grain-size fraction. sedFlow features fast calculations and straightforward pre- and postprocessing of simulation data. The high simulation speed allows for simulations of several years, which can be used, e. g., to assess the long-term impact of river engineering works or climate change effects. In combination with the straightforward pre- and postprocessing, the fast calculations facilitate efficient workflows for the simulation of individual flood events, because the modeller gets the immediate results as direct feedback to the selected parameter inputs. The model is provided together with its complete source code free of charge {{under the terms of the}} GNU General Public License (GPL) (www. wsl. ch/sedFlow). Examples of the application of sedFlow are given in a companion article by Heimann et al. (2015) ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{considers}} a fluid dynamic study of blood flow within the umbilical vessels {{of the human}} maternal-fetal circulatory system. In particular it evaluates {{the efficacy of the}} umbilical coiling index (UCI) in predicting the blood vessel pressure drop, and develops clinically viable indices for the quantification of umbilical cord flow resistance. A numerical approach is developed employing the finite element method via the open-source c++ code oomph-lib, available from the University of Manchester. This permits the description of an umbilical vessel geometry as a fully three-dimensional rigid tube in order to consider a wide range of cords subject to steady and unsteady boundary conditions. The thesis is composed of three main studies. The first concerns steady incompressible Newtonian flow through model geometries representative of the umbilical vessels. It is found that the UCI is unable to distinguish between cords of significantly varying pressure and flow characteristics, which are typically determined by the vessel curvature, torsion and length. Larger scale geometric non-uniformities superposed over the inherent coiling, including cords exhibiting width and/or local UCI variations as well as loose true knots, typically produce a small effect on the total pressure drop. Crucially, this implies that a helical geometry of mean coiling may be used to determine the steady vessel pressure drop through a more complex cord. The presence of vessel constriction, however, drastically increases the steady pressure drop and alters the flow profile. The second study provides an analysis of pulsatile incompressible Newtonian flow through arterial geometries. The steady pressure drop is found to approximate the time-averaged value with high accuracy over a wide range of arteries. Furthermore, the relative peak systolic pressure measured over the period is found to remain virtually constant and approximately 25 % below the equivalent straight pipe value for a large range of non-straight vessels. Interestingly, this suggests that the coiled structure dampens extreme pressures within the arterial cycle and may provide another possible evolutionary benefit to the coiled structure of the cord. Having shown the UCI ineffective at predicting the vessel pressure drop, the third and final study presents two alternative indices for the diagnosis of cord pathology based on steady calculations. The umbilical pressure index, PX, and ow index, QX, quantify the deviation of a cord geometry from typical conditions by considering the steady pressure and ow-rate, respectively. These indices are calculated based on a combination of empirical and interpolated numerical data and require only one additional geometric measurement to the calculation of the UCI; namely the cord width. Together the indices provide a non-invasive measure of the <b>flow-resistance</b> inherent to a particular cord geometry, and allow comparison with typical values in pregnancy. Further testing of the indices is required to determine their efficacy in a clinical setting, however, their simple and robust nature ensures that they are promising candidates. Thesis (Ph. D.)
