40|$|Biological <b>field</b> <b>notebooks</b> are {{records of}} lives spent outside in nature. Part diary, part {{scientific}} record, <b>field</b> <b>notebooks</b> often contain details required {{to understand the}} location and environmental conditions existent during collecting events. Despite their clear value for (and recent use in) global change studies, the text-mining outputs from <b>field</b> <b>notebooks</b> have been idiosyncratic to specific research projects, and impossible to discover or re-use. Best practices and workflows for digitization, transcription, extraction, and integration with other sources are nascent or non-existent. In this paper, we demonstrate a model workflow to generate structured outputs while also maintaining linkages to the original texts. The first step in this workflow was placing already digitized and transcribed <b>field</b> <b>notebooks</b> from the University of Colorado Museum of Natural History founder, Junius Henderson, on Wikisource, an open manuscript-editing platform. Next, we created Wikisource-specific templates to document places, dates, and taxa to facilitate annotation and wiki-linking. We then requested help from the public, through social media tools, {{to take advantage of}} volunteer efforts and energy. After three notebooks were fully annotated, content was converted into XML and annotations were extracted and placed into Darwin Core compliant record sets. Finally, these record sets were vetted, specifically to provide valid taxon names, via a process we call “taxonomic referencing. ” The result is identification and mobilization of 1076 observations from three of Henderson’s thirteen notebooks and a publishable Darwin Core record set for use in other analyses. Although challenges remain, this work demonstrates a feasible approach to unlock observations from <b>field</b> <b>notebooks</b> that enhances their discovery and interoperability without losing the narrative context from which those observations are drawn...|$|R

The ship continued the survey in the second voyage of the Beagle under the command of captain FitzRoy, who took Charles Darwin along as a self-funding , giving him opportunities as an amateur naturalist. Darwin had his first sight of glaciers when they reached the channel on 29 January 1833, and wrote in his <b>field</b> <b>notebook</b> [...] "It is scarcely possible to imagine anything more beautiful than the beryl-like blue of these glaciers, and especially as contrasted with the dead white of the upper expanse of snow." ...|$|E
