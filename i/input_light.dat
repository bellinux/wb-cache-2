Light reflected from the surface after the polarizer is transformed into the opposite [...] "handedness". This light cannot pass back through the circular polarizer because its chirality has changed (e.g. from right circular polarized to left circularly polarized). A disadvantage of this method is that if the <b>input</b> <b>light</b> is unpolarized, the transmission through the assembly will be less than 50%.|$|E

50|$|<b>Input</b> <b>light</b> {{need not}} be {{polarized}} for a non-collinear design. Unpolarized <b>input</b> <b>light</b> is scattered into orthogonally polarized beams separated by the scattering angle for the particular design and wavelength. If the optical design provides an appropriate beam block for the unscattered light, then two beams (images) are formed in an optical passband that is nearly equivalent in both orthogonally linearly polarized output beams (differing by the Stokes and Anti-Stokes scattering parameter). Because of dispersion, these beams move slightly with scanning rf frequency.|$|E
5000|$|Identifying {{materials}} that re-emit more <b>input</b> <b>light</b> as useful luminescence with negligible self-absorption is crucial.

The sources and/or sinks could be distributed in two dimensions; that is, on planes. Alternatively or in addition, sources and/or sinks could be distributed in three dimensions [...] for example, on curved surfaces or in more complex (including random) three-dimensional patterns...|$|R

40|$|The {{circadian}} {{clock is}} entrained {{to the daily}} cycle of day and night by light signals at dawn and dusk. Plants make use of both the phytochrome (phy) and cryptochrome (cry) families of photoreceptors in gathering information about the light environment for setting the clock. We demonstrate that the phytochromes phyA, phyB, phyD, and phyE act as photoreceptors in red <b>light</b> <b>input</b> to the clock and that phyA and the cryptochromes cry 1 and cry 2 act as photoreceptors in blue <b>light</b> <b>input.</b> phyA and phyB act additively in red <b>light</b> <b>input</b> to the clock, whereas cry 1 and cry 2 act redundantly in blue <b>light</b> <b>input.</b> In addition to the action of cry 1 as a photoreceptor that mediates blue <b>light</b> <b>input</b> into the clock, we demonstrate a requirement of cry 1 for phyA signaling to the clock in both red and blue light. Importantly, Arabidopsis cry 1 cry 2 double mutants still show robust rhythmicity, indicating that cryptochromes do not form {{a part of the}} central circadian oscillator in plants as they do in mammals...|$|R
5000|$|A Faraday rotator is a {{polarization}} rotator {{based on the}} Faraday effect, {{which in turn is}} based on a magneto-optic effect.It works because one polarization of the <b>input</b> <b>light</b> is in ferromagnetic resonance with the material which causes its phase velocity to be higher than the other.|$|E
5000|$|Nonlinear optics: Frequency {{conversion}} efficiency in s {{is proportional to}} the square (sometimes cubed or more) of the <b>input</b> <b>light</b> intensity. Therefore, to get efficient frequency conversion, the input beam waist must be as small as possible. A beam profiler can help minimize the beam waist in the nonlinear crystal.|$|E
50|$|The {{effect will}} be a change of the optical fibre properties. For {{instance}} glass poling will permit to realize second-harmonic light generation which consists on converting an <b>input</b> <b>light</b> into another wavelength, twice the original radiation.

Moreover, such a third-order Butterworth filter is not only insensitive to the incident angle and but also to <b>input</b> <b>light's</b> polarization.

50|$|Encoding (in cognition) {{is a basic}} perceptual {{process of}} {{interpreting}} incoming stimuli; technically speaking, it is a complex, multi-stage process of converting relatively objective sensory <b>input</b> (e.g., <b>light,</b> sound) into subjectively meaningful experience.|$|R
5000|$|This {{mechanism}} allows entrainment {{of flies}} to environmental light cues. When Drosophila receive <b>light</b> <b>inputs</b> {{in the early}} subjective night, light-induced TIM degradation causes a delay in TIM accumulation, which creates a phase delay. [...] When <b>light</b> <b>inputs</b> are received in the late subjective night, a light pulse causes TIM degradation to occur earlier than under normal conditions, leading to a phase advance.|$|R

The material operates with much lower intensity light than traditional approaches. For a given <b>input</b> <b>light</b> intensity and structure thickness, the metamaterial produced approximately one million times higher intensity output. The mirrors do not require matching the phase velocities of the input and output waves.|$|E
5000|$|A {{special case}} of sum-frequency {{generation}} is second-harmonic generation, in which ω1=ω2. In fact, in experimental physics, {{this is the}} most common type of sum-frequency generation. This is because in second-harmonic generation, only one <b>input</b> <b>light</b> beam is required, but if ω1≠ω2, 2 simultaneous beams are required, which can be more difficult to arrange. In practice, the term [...] "sum-frequency generation" [...] usually refers to the less common case where ω1≠ω2.|$|E
50|$|Operations via linear optical {{elements}} (beam splitters, {{mirrors and}} phase shifters, in this case) preserve the photon statistics of <b>input</b> <b>light.</b> For example, a coherent (classical) light input produces a coherent light output; a superposition of quantum states input yields a quantum light state output. Due to this reason, people usually use single photon source case {{to analyze the}} effect of linear optical elements and operators. Multi-photon cases can be implied through some statistical transformations.|$|E

50|$|The {{amount of}} light diffracted by the sound wave depends on the {{intensity}} of the sound. Hence, {{the intensity of the}} sound can be used to modulate the intensity of the light in the diffracted beam. Typically, the intensity that is diffracted into m = 0 order can be varied between 15 % to 99 % of the <b>input</b> <b>light</b> intensity. Likewise, the intensity of the m = 1 order can be varied between 0 % and 80 %.|$|E
50|$|In {{an ideal}} system, the emitter would be {{surrounded}} by converters so no light is lost. However, realistically, geometries must accommodate the input energy (fuel injection or <b>input</b> <b>light)</b> used to heat the emitter. Additionally, costs prohibit the placement of converters everywhere. When the emitter reemits light, anything that does not travel to the converters is lost. Mirrors {{can be used to}} redirect some of this light back to the emitter; however, the mirrors may have their own losses.|$|E

50|$|A Faraday rotator {{consists}} of an optical material in a magnetic field. One polarization of the <b>input</b> <b>light</b> is in ferromagnetic resonance with the material which causes its phase velocity {{to be higher than}} that of the orthogonal polarization. This causes the polarization of light to rotate as it propagates through the material. Light propagating in the opposite direction rotates in the opposite direction relative to the light's direction of travel: the rotation of polarization is not reversed by going back through the rotator. This {{can be used to make}} an optical isolator.|$|E
50|$|Loss of {{activity}} caused by photobleaching {{can be controlled}} by reducing the intensity or time-span of light exposure, by increasing the concentration of fluorophores, by reducing the frequency and thus the photon energy of the <b>input</b> <b>light,</b> or by employing more robust fluorophores that are less prone to bleaching (e.g. Alexa Fluors or DyLight Fluors). To a reasonable approximation, a given molecule will be destroyed after a constant exposure (intensity of emission X emission time X number of cycles) because, in a constant environment, each absorption-emission cycle has an equal probability of causing photobleaching.|$|E

40|$|SummaryDirection-selective {{ganglion}} cells (DSGCs) are {{tuned to}} motion in one direction. Starburst amacrine cells (SACs) {{are thought to}} mediate this direction selectivity through precise anatomical wiring to DSGCs. Nevertheless, we previously found that visual adaptation can reverse DSGCs’s directional tuning, overcoming the circuit anatomy. Here we explore the role of SACs in the generation and adaptation of direction selectivity. First, using pharmacogenetics and two-photon calcium imaging, we validate that SACs are necessary for direction selectivity. Next, we demonstrate that exposure to an adaptive stimulus dramatically alters SACs’ synaptic inputs. Specifically, after visual adaptation, On-SACs lose their excitatory <b>input</b> during <b>light</b> onset but gain an excitatory <b>input</b> during <b>light</b> offset. Our data suggest that visual stimulation alters the interactions between rod- and cone-mediated inputs that converge on the terminals of On-cone BCs.
