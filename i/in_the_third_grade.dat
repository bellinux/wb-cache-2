25|$|John David Duty {{was born}} on April 25, 1952, to Charles Houston Duty and Mildred Duty Hall. Duty stated {{that he had been}} raised in a broken home, his mother having {{remarried}} twice. His family included two brothers, a sister, a half-brother, and a half-sister. For some time, Duty went by the name of John David Hall; there had been some confusion over the identity of his biological father as his mother had married O.H. Hall at Atoka, Oklahoma in 1950, but his birth certificate listed Duty as his surname. According to Duty, he lost an eye due to an accident <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>grade</b> and suffered a head injury from a collapsed brick wall; the latter incident led him to be hospitalized for scarlet fever.

The dining room doubled as Loung's bedroom. Church members continued to help the Ungs adjust and provided tutoring in the English language. In a few months, Meng, whose grasp of English was good, obtained employment as an interpreter for newly arrived refugees in Vermont, and Eang found work at a local manufacturing company. In September, Loung, age ten, began her formal education in the United States <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>grade.</b> The early years of her education were difficult for Loung because of the language barrier, and she continued to be tutored during those years. In the late stage of Eang's pregnancy, Meng abandoned his studies at a nearby college and began working at two jobs; on December 21, Meng and Eang's daughter Maria was born.|$|E

500|$|West {{demonstrated}} {{an affinity for}} the arts at an early age; he began writing poetry when he was five years old. His mother recalled that she first took notice of West's passion for drawing and music when he was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>grade.</b> Growing up in Chicago, West became deeply involved in its hip hop scene. He started rapping <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>grade</b> and began making musical compositions in the seventh grade, eventually selling them to other artists. At age thirteen, West wrote a rap song called [...] "Green Eggs and Ham" [...] and began to persuade his mother to pay $25 an hour for time in a recording studio. It was a small, crude basement studio where a microphone {{hung from the ceiling}} by a wire clothes hanger. Although this wasn't what West's mother wanted, she nonetheless supported him. West crossed paths with producer/DJ No I.D., with whom he quickly formed a close friendship. No I.D. soon became West's mentor, and it was from him that West learned how to sample and program beats after he received his first sampler at age 15.|$|E
500|$|In 1970, {{exploring}} {{new designs}} in school furniture, the Institute for Educational Research {{worked with the}} Design Department of Southern Illinois University to create a series of interconnected truncated octahedrons known as [...] "learning spaces", which resembled an oversized beehive. Each child had {{his or her own}} semi-private space with a fold-down seat, reading light, and bookshelf. The goal was to provide private spaces where third grade (eight-year-old) children could develop good study habits, and the school found that the children spent 90 percent of their work time in their learning spaces. The structures were featured in local news stories and in Life magazine. ACS patented the invention and sold models to several local schools. The original structures are still in use <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>grade</b> classroom in 2014.|$|E

In [...] "Cartman's Mom Is Still a Dirty Slut" [...] (1998), Liane Cartman claims to be a hermaphrodite when she also claims to be the father of Cartman and that she did not know the woman who gave birth to Cartman. However, the season 14 (2010) episode [...] "201" [...] later reveals that Liane actually is his mother, and that his true biological father is Jack Tenorman, a fictional former player for the Denver Broncos whom Cartman arranged to be killed in the season five (2001) episode [...] "Scott Tenorman Must Die", making Cartman and Scott Tenorman half-brothers and putting Liane's intersexual identity in question.|$|E

500|$|Stan {{lives in}} South Park at 2001 Bonanza Street {{with his parents}} Randy and Sharon Marsh. Randy is a geologist, and Sharon is a {{secretary}} at a rhinoplasty clinic. Stan's family includes his 13-year-old sister Shelly, who bullies and beats him, and his centenarian grandfather, Marvin, who calls Stan [...] "Billy" [...] and who previously begged Stan to help him commit suicide. Stan attends South Park Elementary as part of Mr. Garrison's fourth grade class. During the show's first 58 episodes (1997 through the season 4 episode [...] "4th Grade" [...] in 2000), Stan and the other main child characters were <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>grade.</b> His birthday is listed as October 19 (the same day as co-creator Trey Parker), 2001 on his Facebook page during the season 14 episode [...] "You Have 0 Friends". Stan is frequently embarrassed and/or annoyed by his father's antics and frequent acts of public drunkenness. Stan's relationship as nephew to his uncle Jimbo received moderate attention in the show's first two seasons.|$|E
500|$|His cricket aspirations, already {{hindered}} due {{to economic}} difficulties {{caused by the}} Great Depression, were further interrupted when he was wheelchair-bound for months after a ruptured appendix in 1938. He {{was not allowed to}} enlist in the Australian Defence Force during World War II and worked at Lithgow's Small Arms factory, in the Blue Mountains west of Sydney. Only {{at the end of the}} war, aged 30, did he go to Sydney. At the time, he was a medium-fast left-arm bowler and approached Petersham—as Toshack lived in their locality, they had the right to register him ahead of other clubs. They did not select Toshack, so he joined Marrickville in Sydney Grade Cricket, starting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>grade</b> team in 1944–45. Within two matches, he rose to the first grade team. By this time, Petersham regretted their decision to spurn Toshack and lodged a complaint with the cricket authorities, claiming that he was obliged to represent them and ineligible to play for Marrickville. Toshack later recalled that Petersham were [...] "told where to go".|$|E
500|$|Stan {{is portrayed}} as the everyman of the group, as the show's website {{describes}} him as an [...] "average, American 4th grader". Kyle is the lone Jew among the group, and his portrayal in this role is often dealt satirically. Stan is modeled after Parker, while Kyle is modeled after Stone. They are best friends, and their friendship, symbolically intended to reflect Parker and Stone's friendship, is a common topic throughout the series. Eric Cartman (usually nicknamed by his surname only) is loud, obnoxious, and amoral, often portrayed as an antagonist. His anti-Semitic attitude {{has resulted in a}} progressive rivalry with Kyle, although the deeper reason is the strong clash between Kyle's strong morality and Cartman's complete lack of such. Kenny, who comes from a poor family, wears his parka hood so tightly that it covers most of his face and muffles his speech. During the show's first five seasons, Kenny would die in nearly every episode before returning in the next with little-to-no definitive explanation given. He was written out of the show's sixth season in 2002, re-appearing in the season finale. Since then, Kenny's death has been seldom used by the show's creators. During the show's first 58 episodes, the boys were <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>grade.</b> In the season four episode [...] "4th Grade" [...] (2000), they entered the fourth grade, but have remained ever since.|$|E
