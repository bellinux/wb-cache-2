5|$|The 1834 revolt and the {{immediate}} aftermath reduced the male population of Palestine by about one-fifth.

Around 10,000 peasants were <b>deported</b> <b>to</b> Egypt and the general population was disarmed. The conscription orders were extended beyond the Muslim population to the local Christians. Taxes were also extended from landed property to include livestock as well. As Ibrahim consolidated his hold over Palestine and disarmed the population, banditry by local tribesmen and civil strife was largely eliminated.|$|E
