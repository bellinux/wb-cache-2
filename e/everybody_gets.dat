2500|$|After tip-off, Troy State scored {{their first}} basket after 54 seconds. Player Paul Bryan later said, jokingly, [...] "It {{was a little}} touch and go there early." [...] Despite their frenetic pace, the Trojans [...] "only" [...] had 15 points after the first three minutes.

Guard Tommy Davis said, [...] "When you see one guy hitting, then <b>everybody</b> <b>gets</b> in the act. It becomes contagious." [...] At {{the end of the}} first half, the score was 123–53.

2500|$|In 2000 and 2004, Robin Ficker {{successfully}} collected signatures {{to place}} a question on the ballot that would have imposed term limits on the County Executive {{and members of the}} County Council. In 2000, the voters rejected term limits 54% to 45%. In 2004, voters rejected term limits 52% to 48%. In each instance, the definition of the word [...] "term" [...] was undefined and the offices were limited to two consecutive terms. With the assistance of Help Save Maryland, a group designated as [...] "nativist extremist" [...] by the Southern Poverty Law Center, Ficker successfully gathered the requisite signatures to place term limits on the 2016 general election ballot. The 2016 ballot measure (Question B) set a three-term (12 year) limit on the County Executive and County Council. It also included language defining term [...] "as either a full or partial term," [...] which would have term-limited Navarro after only 10 years of service. Ficker asserted to the Washington Post that, [...] "he included similar language in his 2000 and 2004 proposed amendments, long before he ran against Navarro or even knew who she was." [...] However, [...] "a review of the [...] shows no such provisions." [...] Navarro responded by saying that she believed, [...] "Ficker's intent was 'pretty clear'," [...] and that, [...] "if it passes, <b>everybody</b> <b>gets</b> three terms, but not the Latina woman." [...] Question B was approved with 69.79% of the vote.|$|E

6000|$|September 29th.--Last evening I met Mr. Powers at Miss Blagden's, and {{he talked}} about his treatment, by our {{government}} in reference, to an appropriation of twenty-five thousand dollars made by Congress for a statue by him. Its payment and the purchase of the statue were left at the option of the President, and he conceived himself wronged because the affair was never concluded. [...] . As for the President, he knows nothing of art, and probably acted in the matter by the advice of the director of public works. No doubt a sculptor gets commissions as <b>everybody</b> <b>gets</b> public employment and emolument of whatever kind from our government, not by merit or fitness, but by political influence skilfully applied. As Powers himself observed, the ruins of our Capitol are not likely to afford sculptures equal to those which Lord Elgin took from the Parthenon, if this be the system under which they are produced. [...] . I wish our great Republic had the spirit to do as much, according to its vast means, as Florence did for sculpture and architecture when it was a republic; but we have the meanest government and the shabbiest, and--if truly represented by it--we are the meanest and shabbiest people known in history. And yet the less we attempt to do for art the better, if our future attempts are to have no better result than such brazen troopers as the equestrian statue of General Jackson, or even such naked respectabilities as Greenough's Washington. There is something false and affected in our highest taste for art; and I suppose, furthermore, we are the only people who seek to decorate their public institutions, not by the highest taste among them, but by the average at best.|$|E
