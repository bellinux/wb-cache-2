5000|$|Many orphan train {{children}} {{went to live}} with families that placed orders specifying age, gender, and hair and eye color. Others were paraded from the depot into a local playhouse, where they were put up on stage, thus the origin of the term “up for adoption.” [...] According to an <b>exhibit</b> <b>panel</b> from the National Orphan Train Complex, the children [...] "took turns giving their names, singing a little ditty, or ‘saying a piece." [...] According to Sara Jane Richter, professor of history at Oklahoma Panhandle State University, the children often had unpleasant experiences. “People came along and prodded them, and looked, and felt, and saw how many teeth they had.” ...|$|E
5000|$|Panel & frame systems: These are the {{ubiquitous}} exhibit, retail, display and presentation systems. In many ways, {{when people think}} of modular exhibits today, they are thinking of panel & frame systems like aluminum extrusions, which is sold (in pieces and parts) to distributors, who in turn market a range of solutions (including exhibit solutions) for rent or purchase {{at a variety of}} quality levels and price points. There are hundreds (or maybe even thousands) of [...] "parts" [...] available. In North America anyway, trade show floors are typically laid out with panel & frame products. These products are a ubiquitous category all to themselves. Unlike a tabletop display or modular <b>exhibit,</b> <b>panel</b> & frame systems will require the services of an on site labor source (show general contractor, or a labor contractor approved through show management).|$|E

In {{recognition}} of the International Year of Astronomy, the exhibit includes six two-sided panels that feature key astronomical discoveries from the past 400 years. The exhibit also highlights the technological advancements that made these discoveries possible. For example, in turning his telescope to the heavens in 1609, Galileo embarked upon a journey that would revolutionize science and culture alike, profoundly changing our view of {{our place in the}} universe. Exhibit topics range from celestial objects within our own “cosmic backyard” to those beyond the realm of our solar system. Featured objects include the Sun, the Moon, Saturn, Mars, comets, stars, nebulae, and galaxies. Images are accompanied by captions that highlight relevant, historical discoveries. The exhibit is supported by supplemental resource documents available online, in PDF format, for each panel.

40|$|Two {{parallel}} slender beams with visco-elastic interlayer {{can serve}} as a relevant mathematical model of a number of engineering systems. A typical example is a double skin facade of tall buildings. The outer skin can be considered as a dynamic damper and thus contribute to comfort inside the building. Many applications emerge in power piping when using two coaxial pipes with an interlayer in order to suppress vibration due to flow and structure interaction. Similar inconvenient behavior can <b>exhibit</b> <b>panels</b> which fall into the flutter post-critical state. Further applications can be expected at industrial chimneys, towers, etc. In principle the idea of vibration damping using such a formation is inspired by very well known tuned mass damper. However its internal structure, function, limitations and singular states are incomparably more complicated and therefore adequate applications should be cautious...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 06 How museums {{engage with}} {{visitors}} who speak different languages is seldom {{looked at in}} museum literature. The goal {{of this research was}} to examine the characteristics of museums who are using non-English and non-Spanish language within the museum. To accomplish this a qualitative multiple method approach was used. Five semi-structured interviews were conducted with museum professionals from four different institutions. In addition, document analysis was used on the museum’s website. The research suggests that museums who want to incorporate language to engage with communities should engage in conversations and build relationships with that community. Asking the community how or if they would use bilingual <b>exhibit</b> <b>panels,</b> and asking for help from the community to accomplish the museum’s linguistic goals are some examples that museums can do to develop those relationships...|$|R
