5|$|The first {{images of}} viruses were {{obtained}} upon {{the invention of}} electron microscopy in 1931 by the German engineers Ernst Ruska and Max Knoll. In 1935, American biochemist and virologist Wendell Meredith Stanley examined the tobacco mosaic virus and <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> mostly made of protein.

5|$|A limited genetic {{sampling}} of species in a 1996 study by Annette Kretzer and colleagues showed Suillus bovinus {{was related to}} a lineage that diverged to S.punctipes, S.variegatus and S.tomentosus. A 2001 study <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not closely related to other European species, and that all populations tested were more closer to each other than any other and hence it was a cohesive species.|$|E

5|$|Between {{the summer}} of 2009 and March 2010, the use of {{mephedrone}} grew rapidly in the UK, with it becoming readily available at music festivals, head shops and on the internet. A survey of Mixmag readers in 2009, <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> the fourth most popular street drug in the United Kingdom, behind cannabis, cocaine, and ecstasy. The drug was used by a diverse range of social groups. Whilst the evidence was anecdotal, researchers, charity workers, teachers and users reported widespread and increasing use of the drug in 2009. The drug's rapid growth in popularity {{was believed to be}} related to both its availability and legality.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that when energy was applied to a combination of gases like those in Titan's atmosphere, five nucleotide bases, the building blocks of DNA and RNA, were among the many compounds produced.

5|$|One {{published}} {{study that}} analysed samples of mephedrone bought {{using the internet}} in the UK in 2010 <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> racemic (a mixture of both stereoisomers) and of high purity. An unpublished study of six samples also ordered off the internet in the UK in 2010 found they contained very few organic impurities. Four products sold in Irish head shops were tested in 2010 and were found to contain between 82% and 14% mephedrone, with some products containing benzocaine and caffeine.|$|E

5|$|Parents of {{children}} with Asperger syndrome can typically trace differences in their children's development to as early as 30 months of age.

5|$|Stela 11 was {{originally}} an interior column from Temple 18, the funerary shrine of Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat. When it was <b>found,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> broken {{in two parts}} {{at the base of}} the temple. It portrays the king as the elderly Maya maize god and has imagery that seems to deliberately parallel the tomb lid of the Palenque king K'inich Janaab' Pakal, probably because of Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat's close family ties to that city. The text of the column formed part of a longer text carved onto the interior walls of the temple and may describe the downfall of the Copán dynasty.|$|E

5|$|Currently, Wales {{play all}} their home matches at the 74,500 {{capacity}} Millennium Stadium, Cardiff, {{which is also}} Wales' national stadium. The Millennium Stadium was first conceived in 1994, when a group redevelopment committee was set up. It was decided to replace the National Stadium at Cardiff Arms Park after a review <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> out of date; new legislation also required stadia to be all seated. Construction began in September 1997, and was completed by June 1999, {{in time for the}} Rugby World Cup. The construction cost the WRU £126million, which was funded by private investment, £46million of public funds from the National Lottery, the sale of debentures to supporters (which offered guaranteed tickets in exchange for an interest-free loan), and loans. While the new ground was being built, Wales used the old Wembley Stadium for their home matchesa deal reciprocated during construction of the new Wembley, when FA Cup finals were held at the Millennium Stadium.|$|E
5|$|George Mack, ornithologist of the National Museum of Victoria, was {{the first}} to {{classify}} the three forms melanocephalus, cruentatus and pyrrhonotus as one species, although Richard Schodde reclassified pyrrhonotus as a hybrid from a broad hybrid zone in North Queensland; this area is bounded by the Burdekin, Endeavour and Norman Rivers. Breeding males of intermediate plumage, larger and scarlet-backed, or smaller and orange-backed, as well as forms that resemble one of the two parent subspecies, are all encountered within it. A molecular study published in 2008 focussing on the Cape York population <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> genetically closer to the eastern forest subspecies than to the Top End form. These birds became segregated around 0.27 million years ago, with some gene flow still with eastern birds.|$|E

5|$|Lindow Man {{marked the}} first {{discovery}} in Britain of a well-preserved bog body; its condition was {{comparable to that of}} Grauballe Man and Tollund Man from Denmark. Before Lindow Man was <b>found,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> estimated that 41bog bodies had been found in England and Wales and 15 in Scotland. Encouraged by the discovery of Lindow Man, a gazetteer was compiled, which revealed a far higher number of bog bodies: over 85 in England and Wales and over 36 in Scotland. Prior to the discovery of the bodies in Lindow Moss, British bog bodies had been a relatively neglected subject compared to European examples. The interest caused by Lindow Man led to more in-depth research of accounts of discoveries in bogs since the 17thcentury; by 1995, the numbers had changed to 106 in England and Wales and 34 in Scotland. The remains covered a large time frame.|$|E
5|$|On 30 July 1502, {{during his}} fourth voyage, Christopher Columbus arrived at Guanaja, {{one of the}} Bay Islands {{off the coast of}} Honduras. He sent his brother Bartholomew to scout the island. As Bartholomew {{explored}} the island with two boats, a large canoe approached from the west, apparently en route to the island. The canoe was carved from one large tree trunk and was powered by twenty-five naked rowers. Curious as to the visitors, Bartholomew Columbus seized and boarded it. He <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a Maya trading canoe from Yucatán, carrying well-dressed Maya and a rich cargo that included ceramics, cotton textiles, yellow stone axes, flint-studded war clubs, copper axes and bells, and cacao. Also among the cargo were a small number of women and children, probably destined to be sold as slaves, as were a number of the rowers. The Europeans looted whatever took their interest from amongst the cargo and seized the elderly Maya captain to serve as an interpreter; the canoe was then allowed to continue on its way. It is likely that news of the piratical strangers in the Caribbean passed along the Maya trade routes.|$|E

5|$|Port Lavaca or Labaca, {{developed}} {{after the}} abandonment of Linnville.

The small town of Olivia, which was founded in 1892 as a Swedish Lutheran community, is located on the shores of Keller Bay. The unincorporated towns of Alamo Beach, established around 1900, and Magnolia Beach, founded sometime thereafter, and named for the Magnolia figs produced in the area, are found north of the remains of the ghost town of Indianola.|$|E
5|$|Successful mining {{took time}} and capital, {{particularly}} once {{most of the}} timber around the Klondike had been cut down. A realistic mining operation required $1,500 ($1.2 million) for wood to be burned to melt the ground, along with around $1,000 ($800,000) to construct a dam, $1,500 ($1.2 million) for ditches and up to $600 ($480,000) for sluice boxes, a total of $4,600. The attraction of the Klondike to a prospector, however, was that when gold was <b>found,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> often highly concentrated. Some of the creeks in the Klondike were fifteen times richer in gold than those in California, and richer still than those in South Africa. In just two years, for example, $230,000 ($184 million) worth of gold was brought up from claim 29 on the Eldorado Creek.|$|E
