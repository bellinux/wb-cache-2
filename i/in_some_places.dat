5|$|An {{anonymous}} chronicler at Bury St Edmunds, {{working in}} the second quarter of the 12th century, produced a compilation now known as The Annals of St Neots. He used material from a version of Asser's work which differs <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>places</b> from the Cotton manuscript and <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>places</b> appears to be more accurate, so it is possible that the copy used was not the Cotton manuscript.|$|E

5|$|A more ancient {{dwelling}} on Shapinsay is the Iron Age Broch of Burroughston. Only {{the interior of}} this partially buried building has been excavated, allowing visitors to look down into the broch from the surrounding mound. The surviving drystone walls rise to about threemetres (10ft) and are more than fourmetres (13ft) thick <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>places.</b>|$|E

5|$|In some areas, {{introduced}} {{black and}} brown rats raid nests for eggs and young. Cats also threaten the red-billed tropicbird.

5|$|It {{was early}} {{afternoon}} {{by the time}} Ike and Tom had seen doctors for their head wounds. The day was chilly, with snow still on the ground <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>places.</b> Both Tom and Ike {{had spent the night}} gambling, drinking heavily, and without sleep. Now they were both out-of-doors, both wounded from head beatings, and at least Ike was still drunk.|$|E

With increasing distance they are 2.5–1.5 {{million years old}} Pilisca centre, the 2.8–2.2 million years old Cucu centre and the 4.3–3.6 million years old Luci-Lazu and Sumuleu-Ciuc volcanic centres. South of Ciomadul the Murgul shoshonites were erupted 2.3–1.5 million years ago; they represent cryptodomes. Andesite lava flows from Pilisca underlie the Ciomadul deposits <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>places.</b>|$|E
5|$|Releases {{are named}} by year but have {{internal}} version numbers as well. The internal version number was advanced to 15.x in the 2008 edition {{to match the}} Norton AntiVirus release of the same year.

5|$|Although the {{fracturing}} {{process is}} not yet known, the altitudinal statistical analysis indicates that the caldera had formed just before the eruption. The area of the island was smaller, and the southern and eastern coastlines appeared regressed. During the eruption, the landscape was covered by the pumice sediments. <b>In</b> <b>some</b> <b>places,</b> the coastline vanished under thick tuff depositions. In others, recent coastlines were extended towards the sea. After the eruption, the geomorphology of the island was characterized by an intense erosional phase during which the pumice was progressively removed from the higher altitudes to the lower ones.|$|E

5|$|Apart {{from these}} more {{spectacular}} pieces of resistance, <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>places</b> chantry priests continued to say prayers and landowners {{to pay them}} to do so. Opposition to the removal of images was widespread—so much so that when during the Commonwealth, William Dowsing was commissioned {{to the task of}} image breaking in Suffolk, his task, as he records it, was enormous. In Kent and the southeast, compliance was mostly willing and for many, the sale of vestments and plate was an opportunity to make money (but it was also true that in London and Kent, Reformation ideas had permeated more deeply into popular thinking).|$|E
5|$|Before {{developing}} the route west of Aspen, the state turned its attention the other way. In 1927 it rebuilt the old stage road over Independence Pass to Twin Lakes and designated {{it part of}} Highway 82, closing it in winters to avoid the maintenance costs. Most of it followed the original route; however <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>places</b> it deviated. The largest section of the original remains three miles (5km) below the pass on the east approach. The foundation of the gatekeeper's house remains, {{as well as some}} of the original toll gate.|$|E

5|$|Halfbeaks {{are not a}} major {{target for}} {{commercial}} fisheries, though small fisheries for them exist <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>places,</b> for example in South Australia where fisheries target the southern sea garfish (Hyporhamphus melanochir). and the eastern sea garfish (Hyporhamphus australis). Halfbeaks are caught {{by a variety of}} methods including seines and pelagic trawls, dip-netting under lights at night, and with haul nets. They are utilized fresh, dried, smoked, or salted, and they are considered good eating. However, even where halfbeaks are targeted by fisheries, they tend to be of secondary importance compared with other edible fish species.|$|E
5|$|Hemlock trees form {{a canopy}} over Big Wapwallopen Creek <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>places.</b> The Wapwallopen Gorge {{is listed as}} a Locally Significant site on the Luzerne County Natural Areas Inventory.

There are riparian forests along Big Wapwallopen Creek in the American Legion Post 781 land tract. The tract of land also contains some wet areas such as vernal pools and marshes. These areas provide breeding grounds for reptiles, amphibians, fish, and aquatic invertebrates.|$|E
5|$|In June 2016, the {{estimated}} cost of the one-stop SSE was revised from $2 billion to $2.9 billion because tunnels need to be deeper than expected <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>places,</b> with the new terminal station being 45 to 90 per cent deeper. An additional cost factor is that a high water table would require more concrete. There is also a $300 million maintenance cost to keep Line 3 Scarborough operating until the SSE's opening {{resulting in a total}} project cost of $3.2 billion.|$|E
