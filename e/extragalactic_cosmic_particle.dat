50|$|Unlike solar or galactic cosmic rays, {{little is}} known about the origins of <b>extragalactic</b> <b>cosmic</b> rays. This is largely due to a lack of statistics: only about 1 <b>extragalactic</b> <b>cosmic</b> ray <b>particle</b> per square meter per year reaches the Earth's surface (see figure).There are many ideas about which {{processes}} may be responsible for cosmic rays with such high energies. In the 'bottom-up' approach, cosmic rays gain more and more energy through electromagnetic processes. Bouncing randomly back and forth in the shock waves of some violent object allows some of the particles to gain energy. Eventually they may build up enough speed that the object can no longer contain them, and they escape. Proposed sites for this type of acceleration include gamma ray bursts and active galactic nuclei. Indeed, recent analysis of cosmic ray measurements with the Pierre Auger Observatory suggests a correlation between the arrival directions of cosmic rays of the highest energies of more than 5×1019 eV and the positions of nearby active galaxies.|$|R
40|$|Forty {{years have}} passed since the first Explorer {{orbiting}} observatory - the 1958 mission used to discover the Van Allen radiation belts outside the atmosphere - ushered in the modern age of space science. Even though in situ observations of outer space are still restricted to measurements made within the solar system, we now have access {{to a wide range of}} cosmic signals, extending from the well understood microwave photons indicative of the earliest epoch of the universe to those apparently inexplicable ultra-high energy <b>extragalactic</b> <b>cosmic</b> ray <b>particles</b> that are too energetic (up to 50 Joules/each) to have survived passage through a cosmological extent of the pervasive thermal relic radiation field. In this lecture the extremes of cosmic ray physics are discussed within the context of particles having the lowest energy (down to ~ 10 ** 3 eV/nucleon) and highest energy (> 10 ** 20 eV), emphasizing those aspects of astronomy, particularly gamma-ray and x-ray, that appear to be especially revealing for these regimes.

40|$|Abstract Although kilometer-scale {{neutrino}} detectors such as IceCube are discovery instruments, their {{conceptual design}} {{is very much}} anchored to the observational fact that Nature produces protons and photons with energies in excess of 10 20 eV and 10 13 eV, respectively. The puzzle of where and how Nature accelerates the highest energy <b>cosmic</b> <b>particles</b> is unresolved almost a century after their discovery. From energetics considerations we anticipate order 10 ∼ 100 neutrino events per kilometer squared per year pointing back at the source(s) of both galactic and <b>extragalactic</b> <b>cosmic</b> rays.

40|$|<b>Extragalactic</b> <b>cosmic</b> ray protons with an {{injection}} {{spectrum of the}} type E − 2. 7 show a spectrum on earth with a dip due to the Bethe-Heitler pair production against the photons of the cosmic microwave background. The dip is produced in the energy region 10 18 − 4 × 10 19 eV with position and shape that reproduce with high accuracy the spectrum observed experimentally. This interpretation of the observed data predicts {{the existence of an}} energy scale that signals a possible transition from galactic to <b>extragalactic</b> <b>cosmic</b> rays. In fact, at energies lower than a characteristic value Ec ≈ 1 × 10 18 eV, determined by the equality between the rate of energy losses due to pair production and adiabatic losses, the spectrum of cosmic rays flattens in all cases of interest. In this model, the transition from galactic to <b>extragalactic</b> <b>cosmic</b> rays occurs at some energy below Ec, corresponding to the position of the so-called second knee. Another viable explanation of the observed data is based on a completely different approach assuming a mixed composition with protons and nuclei at energies E ≥ 10 19 eV. This scenario implies a transition from galactic to <b>extragalactic</b> <b>cosmic</b> rays at the ankle energies (∼ 10 19 eV). In the present paper we will review the main features of the dip model comparing it with the model of transition at the ankle. ...|$|R

40|$|Motivated {{by recent}} {{experimental}} proposals {{to search for}} <b>extragalactic</b> <b>cosmic</b> rays (including anti-matter from distant galaxies), we study particle propagation through the intergalactic medium (IGM). We first use estimates of the magnetic field strength between galaxies to constrain the mean free path for diffusion of particles through the IGM. We then develop a simple analytic model to describe the diffusion of cosmic rays. Given the current age of galaxies, our results indicate that, in reasonable models, a completely negligible number of particles can enter our Galaxy from distances greater than ∼ 100 Mpc for relatively low energies (E < 10 ^ 6 GeV/n). We also find that particle destruction in galaxies along the diffusion path produces an exponential suppression of the possible flux of <b>extragalactic</b> <b>cosmic</b> rays.

Fundamental Assumptions It is useful to begin by recalling the basic assumptions and observations that lead us to {{the concept of the}} <b>extragalactic</b> <b>cosmic</b> background radiation, as opposed to radiation surface brightness that may be some highly variable function of position and direction. Deep counts of objects detected at a broad range of wavelengths, from gamma ray sources to radio galaxies, are close to isotropic across the sky. It is an excellent bet therefore that the integrated radiation from observed sources plus those too faint to be detectable as individual objects also is quite to isotropic. This allows us to think of the local extragalactic radiation background as...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{discuss the}} anisotropies at large angular scales {{expected}} for <b>extragalactic</b> <b>cosmic</b> rays. The {{transition from the}} ‘low’ energy galactic cosmic rays to the high energy extragalactic ones probably occurs around EeV energies. Depending on the amplitude of the extragalactic magnetic field and the charge of the particles the propagation of <b>extragalactic</b> <b>cosmic</b> rays from their sources to our galaxy {{would be in the}} diffusive regime or the quasi-rectilinear one, with just angular diffusion at higher energies. The anisotropy from a single source of protons is obtained using both numerical simulations and analytical approximations. For a diffusive scenario with a few sources in the local supercluster, we discuss the possible transition between the case in which the anisotropies are dominated by a few sources at energies below few EeV towards the regime in which many sources contribute at higher energies. The effect of a non-isotropic source distribution is also discussed, showing that it can significantly affect the observed dipole...|$|R
40|$|The models {{proposed}} {{to explain the}} observed spectrum of cosmic ray antiprotons are reexamined {{in light of recent}} results from balloon-borne experiments. It is found that the prediction of modified closed galaxy model fits the observed data very well. Models in which secondary antiprotons are produced in the sources, could be made consistent with the data provided the secondary particles do not suffer considerable adiabatic deceleration. It has been shown that there cannot be any significant contribution to the observed antiprotons, from the evaporation of mini black holes or from the annihilation of dark matter like photinos. The role of <b>extragalactic</b> <b>cosmic</b> rays has been examined critically {{in the context of the}} recent data, and they are not the source of cosmic ray antiprotons. However, determination of the energy spectrum of antiprotons at least up to a few tens of GeV would be valuable to provide information on the possible existence of supersymmetric particles and on the modulation of <b>extragalactic</b> <b>cosmic</b> rays while entering the Galaxy...|$|R
