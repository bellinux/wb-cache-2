40|$|This study {{examined}} {{factors associated with}} burnout and secondary trauma among forensic interviewers of abused children. Sixty-six forensic interviewers who are affiliated with advocacy centers across the United States completed an online survey. The Oldenburg Burnout Inventory and Secondary Traumatic Stress Scale were used to measure burnout and secondary trauma, respectively. Results indicate that organizational satisfaction has a moderate inverse relationship with burnout and a slight inverse relationship with secondary trauma. The number of forensic interviews conducted or length of employment in forensic <b>interviewing</b> <b>did</b> not have a strong relationship with either burnout or secondary trauma...|$|E
40|$|Background: Obesity is {{a serious}} health concern {{throughout}} the world. This systematic review aims {{to see if the}} use of motivational interviewing provides more successful results in weight loss in males than more traditional weight loss education. Method: An exhaustive literature search was performed using MEDLINE, CINAHL and Web of Science databases using the keywords “motivational interviewing,” “obesity,” “weight loss,” “behavior change,” and “male”. From here, articles were chosen based on title and then abstracts were reviewed. The articles were then assessed using GRADE criteria. Results: Only two articles that fit the topic and inclusion/exclusion criteria were included in this review. Groeneveld et al study showed a mean loss of 0. 9 kg (1. 98 lbs) in the participants in the intervention group who received MI, versus a mean gain of 0. 9 kg (1. 98 lbs) in the control group who did not receive MI. It is apparent in this study that motivational <b>interviewing</b> <b>did</b> have statistically significant outcomes on weight loss when compared to more traditional weight loss education, p 3 ̆c 0. 05. Rocha-Goldberg et al study showed that after the six week study, participants did show a mean decrease in weight of 2. 9 lbs. Although in this pilot study, there was no control group to measure the intervention group against. Conclusion: Motivational interviewing does have statistically significant results on weight loss in adult males...|$|E
40|$|Background: Preventive {{guidelines}} on cardiovascular risk management recommend lifestyle changes. Support for lifestyle changes {{may be a}} useful task for practice nurses, but the effect of such interventions in primary prevention is not clear. We examined the effect of involving patients in nurse-led cardiovascular risk management on lifestyle adherence and cardiovascular risk. Methods: We performed a cluster randomized controlled trial in 25 practices that included 615 patients. The intervention consisted of nurse-led cardiovascular risk management, including risk assessment, risk communication, a decision aid and adapted motivational interviewing. The control group received a minimal nurse-led intervention. The self-reported outcome measures at one year were smoking, alcohol use, diet and physical activity. Nurses assessed 10 -year cardiovascular mortality risk after one year. Results: There {{were no significant differences}} between the intervention groups. The effect of the intervention on the consumption of vegetables and physical activity was small, and some differences were only significant for subgroups. The effects of the intervention on the intake of fat, fruit and alcohol and smoking were not significant. We found no effect between the groups for cardiovascular 10 -year risk. Interpretation: Nurse-led risk communication, use of a decision aid and adapted motivational <b>interviewing</b> <b>did</b> not lead to relevant differences between the groups in terms of lifestyle changes or cardiovascular risk, despite significant within-group differences...|$|E

40|$|Background: To date, male {{circumcision}} prevalence {{has been estimated}} using surveys of men self-reporting their circumcision status. HIV prevention trials and observational studies involving female participants also collect data on partners ’ circumcision status as {{a risk factor for}} HIV/STIs. A number of studies indicate that reports of circumcision status may be inaccurate. This study assessed different methods for improving self- and partner reporting of circumcision status. Methods/Findings: The study was conducted in urban and rural Zambia and urban Swaziland. Men (N = 1264) aged 18 – 50 and their female partners (N = 1264), and boys (N = 840) aged 13 – 17 were enrolled. Participants were recruited from HIV counseling and testing sites, health centers, and surrounding communities. The study experimentally assessed methods for improving the reporting of circumcision status, including: a) a simple description of circumcision, b) a detailed description of circumcision, c) an illustration of a circumcised and uncircumcised penis, and d) computerized self-interviewing. Self-reports were compared to visual examination. For men, the error in reporting was largely unidirectional: uncircumcised men more often reported they were circumcised (2 – 7 %), depending on setting. Fewer circumcised men misrepresented their status (0. 05 – 5 %). Misreporting by women was significantly higher (11 – 15 %), with the error in both directions. A sizable number of women reported {{that they did not know}} their partner’s circumcision status (3 – 8 %). Computerized <b>interviewing</b> <b>did</b> not improve accuracy.

40|$|Hearing of {{the news}} of the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, in a traffic accident, is taken as an {{analogue}} for being a percipient but uninvolved witness to a crime, or a witness to another person 2 ̆ 7 s sudden confession to some illegal act. This event (known in the literature as a “reception event”) has previously been hypothesized to cause one to form a special type of memory commonly known as a “flashbulb memory” (FB) (Brown and Kulik, 1977). FB 2 ̆ 7 s are hypothesized to be especially resilient against forgetting, highly detailed including peripheral details, clear, and inspiring great confidence in the individual for their accuracy. FB 2 ̆ 7 s are dependent for their formation upon surprise, emotional valence, and impact, or consequentiality to the witness of the initiating event. FB 2 ̆ 7 s are thought to be enhanced by frequent rehearsal. FB 2 ̆ 7 s are very important in the context of criminal investigation and litigation in that investigators and jurors usually place great store in witnesses, regardless of their actual accuracy, who claim to have a clear and complete recollection of an event, and who express this confidently. Therefore, the lives, or at least the freedom, of criminal defendants, and the fortunes of civil litigants hang on the testimony of witnesses professing to have FB 2 ̆ 7 s. ^ In this study, which includes a large and diverse sample (N = 305), participants were surveyed within 2 – 4 days after hearing of the fatal accident, and again at intervals of 2 and 4 weeks, 6, 12, and 18 months. Contrary to the FB hypothesis, I found that participants 2 ̆ 7 FB 2 ̆ 7 s degraded over time beginning at least as early as two weeks post event. At about 12 months the memory trace stabilized, resisting further degradation. Repeated <b>interviewing</b> <b>did</b> not have any negative affect upon accuracy, contrary to concerns in the literature. Analysis by correlation and regression indicated no effect or predictive power for participant age, emotionality, confidence, or student status, as related to accuracy of recall; nor was participant confidence in accuracy predicted by emotional impact as hypothesized. Results also indicate that, contrary to the notions of investigators and jurors, witnesses become more inaccurate over time regardless of their confidence in their memories, even for highly emotional events. ...|$|E
40|$|This dataset {{consists}} of ethnographic fieldnotes collected between August 2008 and July 2009 {{in a southern}} Malawian village {{as part of the}} PhD research of Dutch anthropologist Janneke Verheijen. The PhD dissertation itself is included as well, hence Verheijen's analysis of these data. In the dissertation all arguments are hyperlinked to the fragments in the raw data set on which these arguments build. The raw data consist of fieldnotes (including interview transcripts) of both Verheijen and her Malawian research assistant Gertrude Finyiza. The research took {{a close look at the}} widely presumed causality between poverty and risky sexual behaviour. The assumption that poverty and gender inequality push women to exchange sex for material support is increasingly used to explain the continued spread of HIV throughout sub-Saharan Africa and consequently to inform policy. Based on one year of anthropological field research, this case study from rural Malawi draws different conclusions. In the field, the researchers soon found that <b>interviewing</b> <b>did</b> not provide them with sufficiently reliable data. Fortunately, many of the village women liked to spend their afternoons knitting with the researchers, and while chatting provided great insights into their life worlds. The raw data exist of many of these ‘knitting’ conversations (not tape-recorded, but recalled on hindsight by the researchers), the researchers’ observations while participating in village life, various interviews with all adult village women, interviews with women working at three nearby markets, and interviews with health workers in two nearby clinics. All data have been anonymized by changing the names of places and persons. In a few cases, the researcher decided this was insufficient to protect an informant against potential harm. In these cases minor details have been changed so as to avert recognition. The researcher can be contacted about this (and other questions) at jpeverheijen@gmail. com. The rich insights gained through this study confirm that the sexual and relationship choices of the village women put them at increased risk of contracting HIV. These choices are not, however, forced upon them by acute destitution – as commonly assumed by development professionals. Rather, they result from women’s careful balancing of personal wants and community rules. Among the factors that impact on this ‘balancing act’ are the strict (but not necessarily unequal) division of gender roles, the vital importance of conforming to cultural norms, and suspicion towards women’s independence. Related factors are the patterns of matrilineal and matrilocal organization, the outmigration of men, the traditional valuation of sex, and fatalistic attitudes towards HIV and AIDS. In conclusion, this study argues that the ‘transactional sex paradigm’ fails to acknowledge the major role played by cultural conventions, the complexity of women’s economic survival strategies, and the agency that women exert in upholding the prevalent gender norms...|$|E

40|$|Patients {{with chronic}} obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD) often experience symptoms of dyspnea and fatigue during daily life activities. The avoidance {{of these activities}} induces an inactive lifestyle which is associated with skeletal muscle weakness and decreased exercise tolerance. Comprehensive multidisciplinary pulmonary rehabilitation is a key intervention in symptomatic patients leading to enhanced exercise tolerance and improved health-related quality of life. While pulmonary rehabilitation has established the status of evidence-based treatment in patients with stable COPD, the present thesis has focussed on three areas where uncertainty remains: 1) the implementation of rehabilitation programs in non-stable patients, 2) the reasons why some patients are responding better than others to exercise training and 3) the paradigm of changing physical activity behaviour as a spin-off to the improvement of exercise tolerance and symptoms. Hospitalizations for an exacerbation of COPD are associated with prolonged inactivity and muscle weakness. In a systematic review we describe the systemic consequences of (repeated) hospitalizations. Furthermore, the scientific evidence about a range of interventions during and after the exacerbation, including exercise training, nutritional interventions and self-management strategies, is thoroughly discussed. The most important conclusion is that exercise training is safe, feasible and effective both during and after hospitalization for an exacerbation, if the modality is adapted to the compromised respiratory situation. In severe cases, exacerbations can lead to admission at the intensive care unit (ICU) and mechanical ventilation. The associated immobility leads to detrimental muscle wasting and ICU-related myopathy and polyneuropathy are highly prevalent in patients with a prolonged ICU stay. Consequently, patients report poor functional status several years after the ICU admission. We investigated the feasibility and effectiveness of a daily passive or active bedside cycling session, initiated at the moment that patients became cardiorespiratory stable. Most patients were sedated and mechanical ventilated {{at the start of the}} intervention. We showed that daily bedside cycling during ICU stay is safe in selected patients and leads to an enhanced recovery of muscle strength and functional exercise capacity at the moment of hospital discharge. Although the beneficial effects of pulmonary rehabilitation have been well established at a group level, individual patients can show less favorable results. It has been shown that patients with more pronounced deconditioning and a higher ventilatory reserve generally have better effects after rehabilitation, but the explained variability remains low. The development of contractile muscle fatigue during training might be a marker of adequate overload to the muscle. This way it is important that patients can fatigue their muscles in order to obtain significant physiological training effects. We reported that approximately 60 % of patients develop quadriceps fatigue during high-intensity exercise training. It was impossible to predict whether a patient would develop muscle fatigue based on lung function, baseline muscle strength, exercise tolerance or any other baseline characteristics. Furthermore, training intensity was similar in patients with and without fatigue. Muscle fatigability decreased during the course of the rehabilitation program. Patients who developed muscle fatigue during training had more pronounced increases in six-minute walking distance and health-related quality of life. The difference between patients with and without fatigue clearly exceeded the proposed minimal important difference for these measures, indicating the importance of developing quadriceps contractile fatigue during exercise training. Studies investigating the influence of pulmonary rehabilitation on physical activity levels report unequivocal results. It is clear that beneficial effects in terms of exercise tolerance do not automatically translate into a higher level of daily physical activity. The lack of change in physical activity levels likely impacts on the long-term maintenance of training effects. We found no changes in daily physical activity behaviour after a six-month pulmonary rehabilitation program, despite a significant increase in exercise tolerance. Remarkably, the addition of an individual activity counseling program, based on techniques of motivational <b>interviewing,</b> <b>did</b> not enhance the physical activity levels. These findings indicate that it is a clear challenge to change the physical activity behavior of patients with severe COPD and that this topic requires further attention in the near future. status: publishe...|$|E
