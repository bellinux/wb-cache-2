5|$|The {{main reason}} for the {{predicted}} differences between unbinilium and the other alkaline earth metals is the spin–orbit (SO) interaction—the mutual interaction between the electrons' motion and spin. The SO interaction is especially strong for the superheavy elements because their electrons move faster—at velocities comparable to the speed of light—than those in lighter atoms. In unbinilium atoms, it lowers the 7p and 8s <b>electron</b> <b>energy</b> levels, stabilizing the corresponding electrons, {{but two of the}} 7p <b>electron</b> <b>energy</b> levels are more stabilized than the other four. The effect is called subshell splitting, as it splits the 7p subshell into more-stabilized and the less-stabilized parts. Computational chemists understand the split as a change of the second (azimuthal) quantum number l from 1 to 1/2 and 3/2 for the more-stabilized and less-stabilized parts of the 7p subshell, respectively. Thus, the outer 8s electrons of unbinilium are stabilized and become harder to remove than expected, while the 7p3/2 electrons are correspondingly destabilized, perhaps allowing them to participate in chemical reactions. This stabilization of the outermost s-orbital (already significant in radium) is the key factor affecting unbinilium's chemistry, and causes all the trends for atomic and molecular properties of alkaline earth metals to reverse direction after barium.|$|E
5|$|Close {{examination}} of the spectral lines reveals that some display a fine structure splitting. This occurs because of spin–orbit coupling, which is an interaction between the spin and motion of the outermost electron. When an atom is in an external magnetic field, spectral lines become split into three or more components; a phenomenon called the Zeeman effect. This {{is caused by the}} interaction of the magnetic field with the magnetic moment of the atom and its electrons. Some atoms can have multiple electron configurations with the same energy level, which thus appear as a single spectral line. The interaction of the magnetic field with the atom shifts these electron configurations to slightly different energy levels, resulting in multiple spectral lines. The presence of an external electric field can cause a comparable splitting and shifting of spectral lines by modifying the <b>electron</b> <b>energy</b> levels, a phenomenon called the Stark effect.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Quasi {{electrostatic}} fields generated {{during the}} lightning produces runaway <b>electrons</b> with <b>energies</b> in MeV range.

In this research work the distribution function of relativistic <b>electrons</b> <b>energy</b> is calculated.

25|$|Lenard {{observed}} {{the variation in}} <b>electron</b> <b>energy</b> with light frequency using a powerful electric arc lamp which enabled him to investigate large changes in intensity, and that had sufficient power to enable him to investigate the variation of potential with light frequency. His experiment directly measured potentials, not electron kinetic energy: he found the <b>electron</b> <b>energy</b> by relating it to the maximum stopping potential (voltage) in a phototube. He found that the calculated maximum electron kinetic energy {{is determined by the}} frequency of the light. For example, an increase in frequency results in an increase in the maximum kinetic energy calculated for an electron upon liberation – ultraviolet radiation would require a higher applied stopping potential to stop current in a phototube than blue light. However Lenard's results were qualitative rather than quantitative because of the difficulty in performing the experiments: the experiments needed to be done on freshly cut metal so that the pure metal was observed, but it oxidised {{in a matter of minutes}} even in the partial vacuums he used. The current emitted by the surface was determined by the light's intensity, or brightness: doubling the intensity of the light doubled the number of electrons emitted from the surface.|$|E

25|$|The {{formation}} of a plasma for polymerization depends {{on many of the}} following. An <b>electron</b> <b>energy</b> of 1–10 eV is required, with electron densities of 109 to 1012 per cubic centimeter, in order to form the desired plasma state. The {{formation of}} a low-temperature plasma is important; the electron temperatures are not equal to the gas temperatures and have a ratio of Te/Tg of 10 to 100, so that this process can occur at near ambient temperatures, which is advantageous because polymers degrade at high temperatures, so if a high-temperature plasma was used the polymers would degrade after formation or would never be formed. This entails non-equilibrium plasmas, which means that charged monomer species have more kinetic energy than neutral monomer species, and cause the transfer of energy to a substrate instead of an uncharged monomer.|$|E

25|$|Medical grade linacs {{accelerate}} electrons using a tuned-cavity waveguide, {{in which}} the RF power creates a standing wave. Some linacs have short, vertically mounted waveguides, while higher energy machines {{tend to have a}} horizontal, longer waveguide and a bending magnet to turn the beam vertically towards the patient. Medical linacs use monoenergetic electron beams between 4 and 25MeV, giving an X-ray output with a spectrum of energies up to and including the <b>electron</b> <b>energy</b> when the electrons are directed at a high-density (such as tungsten) target. The electrons or X-rays can be used to treat both benign and malignant disease. The LINAC produces a reliable, flexible and accurate radiation beam. The versatility of LINAC is a potential advantage over cobalt therapy as a treatment tool. In addition, the device can simply be powered off when not in use; there is no source requiring heavy shielding – although the treatment room itself requires considerable shielding of the walls, doors, ceiling etc. to prevent escape of scattered radiation. Prolonged use of high powered (>18MeV) machines can induce a significant amount of radiation within the metal parts of the head of the machine after power to the machine has been removed (i.e. they become an active source and the necessary precautions must be observed).|$|E
500|$|Calculations have {{confirmed}} {{the accuracy of}} this simple extrapolation, although experimental verification of this is currently impossible as the half-lives of the known tennessine isotopes are too short. Significant differences between tennessine and the previous halogens are likely to arise, largely due to spin–orbit interaction— the mutual interaction between the motion and spin of electrons. The spin–orbit interaction is especially strong for the superheavy elements because their electrons move faster— at velocities comparable to the speed of light— than those in lighter atoms. In tennessine atoms, this lowers the 7s and the 7p <b>electron</b> <b>energy</b> levels, stabilizing the corresponding electrons, although two of the 7p <b>electron</b> <b>energy</b> levels are more stabilized than the other four.
