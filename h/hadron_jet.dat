We give the angle and energy dependence of the cross section for photons radiated from the final state quarks, the initial state leptons, and also the interference term. Large angle radiation by the quarks is only mildly affected by QCD corrections to the parton model. For photons radiated within or near a jet axis, however, the gluon radiative corrections can be large. We study the phenomenological implications of these corrections at presentand future energies. Direct photon production affords a unique view into the short and long distance processes of jet formation.
