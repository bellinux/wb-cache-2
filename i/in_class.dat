5|$|Bruichladdich Radical {{remained}} in the Le Mans Series in 2008, but had an all-new driver line-up of Jens Petersen, Jan-Dirk Leuders and Marc Rostan. The season opener, which was the 1000 km of Catalunya, saw the team finish 15th overall, and seventh <b>in</b> <b>class.</b> However, {{the rest of the}} season was unsuccessful, as the team did not finish above 30th overall in any of the remaining LMS races, or the 24 Hours of Le Mans; although 30th at the 1000km of Spa equated to seventh <b>in</b> <b>class,</b> due to attrition. As a result, the team slipped to joint-eleventh <b>in</b> <b>class,</b> with four points.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, {{the team}} ended their {{association}} with Radical, and replaced the SR9 with a LM P2 class Ginetta-Zytek GZ09S/2; Tim Greaves, Karim Ojjeh and Thor-Christian Ebbesvik were named as the team's regular drivers, resulting in the team being known as Team Bruichladdich. The team's first race with the car came at the LMS opener, the 8 Hours of Castellet, and they finished twelfth overall, fifth <b>in</b> <b>class.</b> The 1000km of Spa proved to be less successful; the team suffered a blown engine during qualifying, and Ebbesvik crashed {{out of the race}} after 15 laps. For the 24 Hours of Le Mans, Gary Chalandon replaced Ebbesvik, and the team finished tenth overall, fifth in the LM P2 class. Next up was the 1000km of Algarve, and Ebbesvik returned to the team; fifth overall, and second <b>in</b> <b>class,</b> for their first class podium of the season. The 1000 km of Hungaroring saw another fifth place overall, although mechanical difficulties with the LM P1-class cars meant that this also equated to fifth <b>in</b> <b>class.</b> The season finale, which was the 1000km of Silverstone, saw the team end the season with a 19th overall, and eighth <b>in</b> <b>class.</b> The team finished the season ranked fifth in the LMP2 Team's Championship, with 46 points.|$|E

3000|$|We {{have created}} a new {{scheduling}} algorithm, which we call ReTaClasses (Resources and Tasks <b>in</b> <b>Classes).</b> The proposed algorithm is simple and basically consists in classifying both tasks and resources <b>in</b> <b>classes.</b> Resources are classified <b>in</b> <b>classes</b> CR={r_ 1, [...]...,r_nc} according to their speed. For instance, if they are classified <b>in</b> three <b>classes</b> (nc= 3), the first class can have resources until 1  GHz, the second one resources from 1 to 3  GHz, and the third one over 3  GHz.
