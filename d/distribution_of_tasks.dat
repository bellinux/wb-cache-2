The event stream model is a powerful yet efficient way to describe the temporal occurrence of events within a system. Real time analysis can be elegantly performed using given event streams, however it has so far not been investigated how the event streams themselves can be acquired.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we {{continue}} our investigation of stochastic (and hence dynamic) variants of classical scheduling problems. Such problems can be modeled as duration probabilistic automata (DPA), a well-structured class of acyclic timed automata where temporal uncertainty is interpreted as a bounded uniform <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>task</b> durations [18]. In [12] we have developed a framework for computing the expected performance of a given scheduling policy. In the present paper we move from analysis to controller synthesis and develop a dynamicprogramming style procedure for automatically synthesizing (or approximating) expected time optimal schedulers, using an iterative computation of a stochastic time-to-go function over the state and clock space of the automaton. ...|$|R

5000|$|Primary Socialization {{takes place}} as a child. It is highly charged emotionally and is not questioned. Secondary Socialization {{includes}} the acquisition of role-specific knowledge, thus taking one’s place in the social division of labor. It is learned through training and specific rituals, and is not emotionally charged: “it is necessary to love one’s mother, but not one’s teacher”. Training for secondary socialization can be very complex and depends on the complexity of division of labor in a society. Primary socialization is much less flexible than secondary socialization. E.g. shame for nudity comes from primary socialization, adequate dress code depends on secondary: A relatively minor shift in the subjective definition of reality would suffice for an individual {{to take for granted}} that one may go to the office without a tie. A much more drastic shift would be necessary to have him go, as a matter of course, without any clothes at all.“The child does not internalize the world of his significant others as one of many possible worlds… It {{is for this reason that}} the world internalized in primary socialization is so much more firmly entrenched in consciousness than worlds internalized in secondary socialization…. Secondary socialization is the internalization of institutional or institution-based ‘sub worlds’… The roles of secondary socialization carry a high degree of anonymity… The same knowledge taught by one teacher could also be taught by another… The institutional <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>tasks</b> between primary and secondary socialization varies with the complexity of the social distribution of knowledge” (p. 129-147) ...|$|E

30|$|A growing {{literature}} is now grappling with these challenges. A recent working paper by Firpo et al. (2011), for example, develops an innovative method {{for measuring the}} impact <b>of</b> changing <b>task</b> prices on wage structure. Using a simple statistical model of occupational wage setting, their work predicts that occupations that are specialized in tasks that have declining market value should see a reduction in both mean occupational wages and the variance of occupational wages, and vice versa for tasks with rising prices. This latter (variance) effect stems from the interaction between a falling task price and a fixed <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>task</b> efficiencies within an occupation; as the market value <b>of</b> a given <b>task</b> falls, the range of wages paid to workers with differing productivities in that task compresses along with it.|$|R

We formulate {{the problem of}} adaptively optimizing the expected present value of a project’s cash flow, and we show that it is practical to perform the optimization. The formulation includes randomness in activity durations, costs, and revenues, so the optimization leads to a recursion with a large state space even if the durations are exponentially distributed. We present an algorithm that partially exorcises the “curse of dimensionality ” as computational results demonstrate. Most of the paper is restricted to exponentially distributed task durations, but we sketch the adaptation of the algorithm to approximate any probability <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>task</b> duration...|$|R
