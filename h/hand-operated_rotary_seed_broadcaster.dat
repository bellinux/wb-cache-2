The load and stress situations were assessed {{as a function of}} factors related to the implements and to the work which is done using them. While loads were measured and evaluated by Fraunhofer-Institut fuer Arbeitswirtschaft und Organisation (IAO), Stuttgart, stresses were analyzed by the Department of Ergonomics at the Hohenheim University. Physiological stress analyses were competed questioning the users about their subjective stress sensations. Technical measures for reduction of the loads and stresses on users were developed {{on the basis of the}} evaluated data. Weak points as regards safe and ergonomic handling were analyzed in addition. The detected design deficiencies lead to measures which reduce mental stresses and increase safety while working. (orig.)

40|$|International audiencePompeian {{millstones}} {{are known}} by their characteristic shape and size. They consist of an hourglass-shaped (bi-conical) upper stone (catillus) and a conical lower stone (meta). The larger models were driven by animals (hence their name, 'donkey mills') {{by means of}} fittings inserted in lugs {{on opposite sides of}} the catillus. The inclination of the grinding surfaces is very important. Recent research has proved, contrary to established assumption, that this type of mill was quite common in Narbonese Gaul. In this Roman Province, all of these mills are made of volcanic rock. The source of this volcanic rock is most likely the Italian peninsula, specifically the region of Orvieto. Although this distinctive rock was also used for other types of large (hydraulic?) millstones and small <b>hand-operated</b> <b>rotary</b> querns, it was mainly used for Pompeian millstones. Beyond southern France, no comprehensive survey of this type of mill has yet been conducted. Several are known in Amiens, Lyon, Paris, Troyes, etc. Unlike the finds from southern France, not all are of volcanic rock. Most come from excavations of urban sites. The aim of this study is to provide a first distribution of Pompeian mills across French territory. For this study, the factors taken into account are raw material, chronology, and the context of each fin...|$|R

The machine was designed, constructed and tested on the University farm in Yola-Nigeria, using locally available materials. The machine consists of roller-metering device that rotates and receives constant flow of seeds from a bottomless hopper, a furrow opener and covering device. There is a front land wheel from which the seed-metering device is directly driven through chain and sprockets. The frame is made of hollow pipe on which the entire assembly is mounted. The machine performance evaluation was carried out using paddy rice BG 302 variety. The actual field capacity of the machine was found to be 0. 067 ha/h with field efficiency of 77. 9 %, and application rate of 21. 62 kg/ha.

40|$|In the <b>seed</b> {{processing}} industry, <b>rotary</b> batch <b>seed</b> coaters {{are widely}} used for providing a protective coating layer to the seeds consisting of various ingredients including fertilisers and crop protection chemicals. Seed motion and mixing are important in ensuring uniform coating; hence {{the focus of this}} work is to address the mixing efficiency and coating uniformity of corn <b>seeds</b> in a <b>rotary</b> batch <b>seed</b> mixer. In the present study, the Discrete Element Method (DEM) is used to analyse the motion and coating uniformity of the seeds. A comprehensive study has been carried out addressing the influence of the shape of corn seeds for accurately simulating their flow in the mixer using two commonly used techniques: (i) manipulation of coefficient of rolling friction of spherical particles, and (ii) clumping multiple spheres. Both methods were successful in simulating the flow of seeds in the mixer, however the former method is found to be an empirical approach rather than predictive. A coating model is used for predicting the coating uniformity of corn seeds in the mixer. Effect of various process parameters on variation of coating mass among the seeds is investigated. For the seed mixer, the baffle clearance gap, baffle geometry and position of the atomiser disc were found to be the key influential process parameters affecting the coating uniformity of corn seeds. Other process parameters such as the base rotational speed, baffle angle, width and curvature had less effects on coating variability. A study has also been carried out on tailoring the existing methods of measuring the extent of breakage of particles for seeds. Four breakage criteria were proposed and assessed for consideration of mass of broken seeds, and the most suitable methods are suggested. The simulations developed here are generic and can be applied {{to a wide range of}} coating processes, such as particle and tablet coating.

40|$|Objective: To {{develop a}} {{practical}} method of measuring shotcrete adhesion strength in underground mines. A more {{thorough understanding of}} the in-situ strength properties of shotcrete, particularly the bond strength of shotcrete to the rock, will lead to improvements in ground support practices, thereby preventing ground falls and reducing mine roof-fall incidents. Background: When shotcrete is used {{as an integral part}} of a mine's ground support system, it is important to know the strength properties of the in-place shotcrete. To quantify the bond strength of the shotcrete to the rock, a shotcrete adhesion test system has been developed for use in underground mines. The test system consists of readily available components, primarily a small stand-mounted core drill and a pulling unit equipped with a precision pressure gauge. All of these components are rugged and portable, and they can reliably be used to measure the adhesion strength of shotcrete app lied to the surface of an underground mine opening. With this test method, a direct tensile load is applied to a core drilled through the shotcrete into the underlying rock. As this load is gradually increased, the test core typically breaks or fails in tension. This tensile failure can occur in the shotcrete, at the bond surface (interface), in the rock, or at some combination of these locations. As a result, the tensile-strength values derived from these tests provide important information about the quality of the applied shotcrete and the competency of the underlying rock, as well as the bond strength of the shotcrete to the rock. Conducting the Shotcrete Adhesion Test: Once a desired test site has been selected, a <b>hand-operated</b> <b>rotary</b> percussive drill is used to drill a 16 -mm x 51 -mm (0. 625 - in x 2 -in) hole for anchoring the drill stand. After installing a 13 -mm- (0. 5 -in-) diameter threaded stud and expansion anchor in this hole, the drill stand is leveled and secured in position. Three holes are then drilled from this drill setup ensuring that all of the holes are parallel and concentric. First, an 11. 1 -mm- (0. 4375 -in-) diameter hole is drilled dry into the shotcrete using a rotary percussive bit, to a depth of 60 mm (2. 375 in), assuming a shotcrete thickness of 75 mm (3 in). Next, the hole is cleaned, filled with a quick-setting, two-part epoxy adhesive, and a 9. 5 -mm- (0. 375 -in-) diameter pull anchor is inserted. After the epoxy has initially set or gelled (about 15 min), a 102 -mm- (4 -in-) diameter diamond core bit is used to wet drill a second hole through the shotcrete to a depth of about 25 to 50 mm (1 to 2 in) into the underlying rock. Finally, a 127 -mm- (5 -in-) diameter diamond core bit is used to wet drill a shallow kerf for seating the base of the pulling fixture. After the epoxy has fully set (30 - 60 min), a threaded extension rod is connected to the pull anchor with a coupling nut; the pulling fixture is then carefully placed over the core sample with the base of its reaction ring positioned in the kerf of the outer drill hole. Next, a collet and a slip-on, quick-threading locknut are connected to the threaded extension rod to serve as a mechanical stop for the pulling fixture's ram. The hydraulic hose from the hand pump is then connected to the loading ram, and the pressure gauge is zeroed. To conduct a test, an increasing tensile load is applied to the core sample through a slow and steady movement of the pump handle until the core breaks. The adhesion strength of the test core is determined by converting the maximum hydraulic pressure value, saved on the pressure gauge's digital display, to the maximum tensile stress acting normal to the core's failure surface. Typical adhesion test results comparing tensile strength with shotcrete curing age are shown in Figure 4. " - NIOSHTIC- 2 "June 2011.

40|$|In the <b>seed</b> {{processing}} industry, <b>rotary</b> batch <b>seed</b> coaters {{are widely}} used for providing a protective coating layer (consisting of various ingredients including fertilisers and crop protection chemicals) on the seeds. Seed motion and mixing are important in ensuring uniform coating. In the batch seed coater, {{the base of a}} cylindrical vessel rotates, whilst the cylindrical wall is stationary and two baffles turn the bed over for mixing. In the present study, the Discrete Element Method (DEM) is used to simulate the effect of particle shape on motion and mixing in this device. Corn seed is used as a model material and the effect of its shape on motion is analysed by considering two approaches: (1) manipulation of rolling friction to account for shape as it is commonly used in the field; (2) approximation of the actual shape by a number of overlapping spheres of various sizes. The geometry of corn seeds is captured using X-Ray micro tomography and then the ASG 2013 software (Cogency, South Africa) is used to generate and optimise the arrangement of the overlapping spheres. A comparison is made of the predicted tangential and radial velocity distributions of the particles from DEM and those measured experimentally. It is concluded that for rapid shearing systems with short collisional contacts a small number of clumped spheres suffices to provide a reasonable agreement with experimental results. Equally well, manipulating the rolling friction coefficient can provide results that match experiments but its most suitable value is unknown a priori, hence the approach is empirical rather than predictive...|$|R
40|$|Coating of {{particulate}} solids by a {{thin film}} layer is of interest in many industrial applications such as seed and tablet coating. In seed processing, seeds are commonly coated with a protective coating layer consisting of fertilisers and crop protection products. Rotary drum batch coaters are typically used for this purpose. The coater consists of a cylindrical vessel with a rotating spray disk in the centre, onto which the coating liquid is fed. The seeds are driven around the vessel by its rotating base, and are mixed by two baffles; one {{on either side of}} the vessel. In the present study, DEM simulations are used to analyse the seed coating process. Corn seed is used as a model material and its shape is captured using X-Ray micro-tomography (XRT). The shape is incorporated into the simulations by the clumping multiple spheres to form a particle assembly. The coating uniformity of the seeds is predicted by implementing a coating model, whereby the coating mechanism is represented in the DEM by considering that once a droplet contacts a corn seed, it is removed from the simulation and its mass is attributed to the coating mass of the corn seed. The distribution of mass of sprayed spheres on the corn seeds and the coefficient of variation are evaluated for a range of process conditions, such as spinning disk rotational speed, droplets size and baffle arrangement and designs. In addition to evaluation of coating uniformity of particles, the scale-up rules for rotary drum batch coaters are investigated and reported. The outcome provides guidelines on scale-up rules and improvement of coating uniformity for <b>rotary</b> batch <b>seed</b> coaters...|$|R

Maximum depth and uniformity of incorporation of surface applied materials by three rotary tillers and a spading machine were compared in a loamy sand nursery using ceramic-sphere tracers (1 - 3 mm diameter) and dazomet (tetrahydro- 3, 5,dimethyl- 2 H- 1, 3, 5 -thia-diazone- 2 -thione) micro-granules. Depth of incorporation in the top 30 cm of soil was evaluated by (1) recovery of incorporated spheres in 2 cm increments, (2) biocidal activity in 6 cm increments, and (3) cone resistance by 1. 5 cm increments to 45 cm. Uniformity of incorporation was evaluated by sphere recovery and biocidal activity. Depths above which more than 95 % of the spheres were recovered for the four implements were: 12. 5 cm, Kuhn and Fobro rotary tillers; 17 cm, Northwest rotary tiller; 21 cm, Gramegna spading machine.

40|$|International audienceWhen the {{spreading}} {{of a disease}} depends on the proportion of infected residues remaining at soil surface it is of crucial importance to analyse the effects of tillage practices on the vertical distribution of stubble. This {{is the case with}} phoma stem canker (blackleg), whose epidemics are initiated in autumn, by air-borne ascospores released from stubble located at the soil surface. We compared initial vertical distribution of oilseed rape residues to those observed after sowing and various tillage operations (rotary harrowing, stubble disking, chiselling and mouldboard ploughing). Almost 20 % of the initially buried residue was brought back to soil surface with <b>seeding.</b> <b>Rotary</b> harrow brought 40 % of the residue buried in the 0 - 10 cm layer up to the surface and left unburied about 70 % of surface residue. Stubble disking appeared to be more efficient for residue burial than chiselling. Mouldboard plough was the only tool that buried all residues. A simple model was developed that predicted burial and return to the soil surface of potentially infected residues as a function of tillage practices used after harvest. Simulation of different tillage sequences showed that the order in which tools were used also affected location of residues. Our results highlighted the importance of tillage in the cultural control of phoma stem canker and will contribute to the definition of integrated pest management strategies for oilseed rape...|$|R
40|$|Aims The {{relationship}} between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning {{is among the}} most active areas of ecological research. Furthermore, enhancing the diversity of degraded ecosystems is a major goal in applied restoration ecology. In grasslands, many species may be locally absent due to dispersal or microsite limitation and may therefore profit from mechanical disturbance of the resident vegetation. We established a seed addition and disturbance experiment across several grassland sites of different land use to test whether plant diversity can be increased in these grasslands. Additionally, the experiment will allow us testing the consequences of increased plant diversity for ecosystem processes and for the diversity of other taxa in real-world ecosystems. Here we present details of the experimental design and report results from the first vegetation survey one year after disturbance and seed addition. Moreover, we tested whether the effects of seed addition and disturbance varied among grassland depending on their land use or pre-disturbance plant diversity. Methods A full-factorial experiment was installed in 73 grasslands in three regions across Germany. Grasslands were under regular agricultural use, but varied in the type and the intensity of management, thereby representing the range of management typical for large parts of Central Europe. The disturbance treatment consisted of disturbing the top 10 cm of the sward using a rotavator or <b>rotary</b> harrow. <b>Seed</b> addition consisted of sowing a high-diversity seed mixture of regional plant species. These species were all regionally present, but often locally absent, depending on the resident vegetation composition and richness of each grassland. Important findings One year after sward disturbance it had significantly increased cover of bare soil, seedling species richness and numbers of seedlings. Seed addition had increased plant species richness, but only in combination with sward disturbance. The increase in species richness, when both seed addition and disturbance was applied, was higher at high land-use intensity and low resident diversity. Thus, we show that at least the early recruitment of many species is possible also at high land-use intensity, indicating the potential to restore and enhance biodiversity of species-poor agricultural grasslands. Our newly established experiment provides a unique platform for broad-scale research on the land-use dependence of future trajectories of vegetation diversity and composition and their effects on ecosystem functioning...|$|R

Na štirih poskusnih poljih smo predsetveno pripravo tal opravili s predsetvenikom ali vrtavkasto brano, nato smo opravili setev z dvema razlicnima sejalnicama. Prva je pnevmatska nadtlacna, druga pnevmatska podtlacna. Pri vseh opravilih smo merili porabo goriva in casa, pri setvi pa še porabo semena. Po 14 dnevih smo opazovali vznik. Jeseni smo izmerili pridelek na vseh poskusnih parcelah in izmerili vlago zrnja koruze. Zbrali smo tudi vremenske podatke za celo leto. Ugotovili smo, da se predsetvena priprava tal opravi hitreje in bolje z vrtavkasto brano v primerjavi s predsetvenikom poleg tega pa prihranimo tudi gorivo. Setev s podtlacno sejalnico je bolj natancna, poraba semena pa je nižja v primerjavi z nadtlacno sejalnico. Pridelek je bil najvišji na poskusni parceli V 1 (6596, 8 kg SS/ha), kjer smo tla obdelali z vrtavkasto brano in sejali s podtlacno sejalnico.

40|$|Consumption of raw or lightly cooked alfalfa sprouts {{has been}} a concern of the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in recent years due to {{connections}} between sprouts and foodborne illnesses. Researchers have identified, contaminated seeds as {{the primary source of}} alfalfa sprouts contamination. Contamination of alfalfa seeds can originate in the field, harvesting, storing, or sprouting. Two pathogens of particular concern on alfalfa seeds are Escherichia coli 0157 :H 7 (E. coli) and Salmonella. These pathogens are capable of producing biofilms that provide protection for individual cells and allow for survival in otherwise hostile environments, including some disinfectant washes. Other factors that contribute to contamination are the crevices of the seed surface, which provide opportunities for the protection of organisms. Various disinfection options have been evaluated and the use of a 20, 000 ppm calcium hypochlorite (Ca(OCl) 2)) solution is the most effective disinfectant for satisfying the requirements of Task 2. Continued outbreaks of food poisoning indicate current disinfecting procedures are inadequate. In an effort to improve disinfection procedures, three bench scale apparatuses were constructed and tested to provide options for the commercial range of seed sanitation rates (from about 75 to 600 lb/week). Experiments were conducted to determine the disinfecting effectiveness of the apparatuses, as well as the current sanitization practices in industry. Experiments included dye removal tests where non-uniform dye removal indicated ineffective contacting. Similar experiments were performed using E. coli inoculating and post-contacting culturing. One bench scale apparatus constructed was a model of the rotary drums widely used in industry. After a 30 minute treatment in the <b>rotary</b> drum, the <b>seeds</b> were found to be free of dye, indicating good contacting. The seeds were also sprouted showing sanitation did not damage the seeds. However, due to the capital expense of 14, 000, the drum is not a viable option for small-scale sprout producers. For sprout growers who currently own rotary drums, drum use is recommended for seed sanitation. Another bench scale apparatus was designed to improve the current industry practice of hand dunking seed-filled mesh draw-string bags. Through experimentation, it was determined. the current hand dunking procedure, with little or no agitation, produces inadequate, non-uniform contact of the seeds and sanitizer. Therefore, the hand dunking procedure was modified to include agitation to effectively suspend the seeds throughout the bag to obtain good contact of the sanitizer solution with the seeds. The agitation-in-bag method is recommended for use in small volume sprout facilities, which currently employ the hand dunking procedure for sanitizing. A modest investment of 113 is needed to implement the agitation-in-bag sanitizing method. Since no additional operating costs are accrued in implementation, no incremental costs are required. Finally, an auger system was designed to sanitize one ton per hour of alfalfa seeds. The one ton per hour rate exceeds the demand of any individual sprout producer. Thus, the auger system is applicable to a partnership of sprout growers. Individual sprout growers within the mung bean industry, with much larger production volumes than the alfalfa industry, could economically use the auger system. However, the auger system can be scaled to sanitize any feed rate. A 1 3 / 82 ̆ 2 diameter, 42 ̆ 7 long auger bench scale model was constructed and tested at 4. 5 lbs/hr rate with a contact time of 15 minutes. Scale-up of this bench scale sanitizer to a 2000 lb/hr rate requires a 162 ̆ 2 diameter by 202 ̆ 7 auger. The entire full-scale sanitizing system, which includes a vibrating screen washer, will handle 5, 000, 000 lb/yr of seeds, operating 8 2 ̆ 7 hr/day, with a capital investment of 227, 000 and an incremental operating cost (primarily labor) of 214, 000 /yr...|$|R
