25|$|IPv6 is not {{directly}} interoperable by design with IPv4. In essence, it establishes a parallel version of the Internet {{not directly}} accessible with IPv4 software. Thus, translation facilities must exist for internetworking or nodes must have duplicate networking software for both networks. Essentially all modern computer operating systems support both versions of the Internet Protocol. Network infrastructure, however, has been lagging in this development. Aside from the complex array of physical connections that make up its infrastructure, the Internet is facilitated by bi- or multi-lateral commercial contracts, e.g., peering agreements, and by technical specifications or protocols that describe the <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> over the network. Indeed, the Internet is defined by its interconnections and routing policies.|$|E
25|$|The key lies {{in strong}} {{institutions}} and cooperation. The Indus River Commission and the Indus Water Treaty survived two wars between India and Pakistan despite their hostility, {{proving to be}} a successful mechanism in resolving conflicts by providing a framework for consultation inspection and <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> <b>data.</b> The Mekong Committee has also functioned since 1957 and survived the Vietnam War. In contrast, regional instability results when there is an absence of institutions to co-operate in regional collaboration, like Egypt's plan for a high dam on the Nile. However, there is currently no global institution in place for the management and management of trans-boundary water sources, and international co-operation has happened through ad hoc collaborations between agencies, like the Mekong Committee which was formed due to an alliance between UNICEF and the US Bureau of Reclamation. Formation of strong international institutions seems to be a way forward – they fuel early intervention and management, preventing the costly dispute resolution process.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the current {{direction in the}} architecture of STEP (STandard for the <b>Exchange</b> <b>of</b> Product model <b>data,</b> formally known as ISO 10303). STEP is an international standard designed to enable the <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> product <b>data</b> between heterogeneous computer systems used throughout the product life cycle. A new modular STEP architecture addresses some deficiencies of the initial architecture and is intended to speed development, facilitate implementation, and increase interoperability of applications of STEP. This paper describes the initial STEP architecture, requirements for improvements to the architecture, and features of the new modular architecture.
