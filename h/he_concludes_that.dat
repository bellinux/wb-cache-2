5|$|Egyptologist and {{archaeology}} pioneer Sir Flinders Petrie {{surveyed the}} Giant, probably during the First World War, and published his {{results in a}} Royal Anthropological Institute paper in 1926. Petrie says that he made 220 measurements, and records slight grooves across the neck, and from the shoulders down to the armpits. He also notes a row of pits suggesting {{the place of the}} spine. <b>He</b> <b>concludes</b> <b>that</b> the Giant {{is very different from the}} Long Man of Wilmington, and that minor grooves may have been added from having been repeatedly cleaned.|$|E
5|$|In Legacy of the Void, it is {{revealed}} that before Fenix's defeat at Antioch in StarCraft, his personality was cloned and inserted into an experimental mechanical body of ancient Purifiers. This body was locked inside a stasis vault on planet Glacius. Artanis obtained Fenix {{and with his}} help {{he was able to}} gain the Purifiers as allies against Amon. During the campaign <b>he</b> <b>concludes</b> <b>that</b> despite having Fenix's memories, he was a different being. Because of this he changed his name to Talandar.|$|E
5|$|In {{seventeenth century}} Spain, Lope de Vega, with a {{detailed}} knowledge of astronomy, wrote plays that ridicule astrology. In his pastoral romance La Arcadia (1598), {{it leads to}} absurdity; in his novela Guzman el Bravo (1624), <b>he</b> <b>concludes</b> <b>that</b> the stars were made for man, not man for the stars. Calderón de la Barca wrote the 1641 comedy Astrologo Fingido (The Pretended Astrologer); the plot was borrowed by the French playwright Thomas Corneille for his 1651 comedy Feint Astrologue.|$|E

25|$|In 1958 Robert Stuckert {{produced}} a statistical analysis using historical census data and immigration statistics. <b>He</b> <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> {{the growth in}} the White population could not be attributed solely to births in the White population and immigration from Europe, but was also due to people identifying as white who were partly black. <b>He</b> <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> 21 percent of white Americans had some recent African-American ancestors. <b>He</b> also <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> the majority of Americans of known African descent were partly European and not entirely sub-Saharan African.|$|R

5|$|Kurt and Blaine {{attend a}} party hosted by New Directions co-captain Rachel Berry (Lea Michele). The {{attendees}} play spin the bottle, {{which results in}} Rachel and Blaine kissing. In the aftermath, Blaine wonders whether he might be bisexual, and goes {{on a date with}} Rachel. When she kisses him again while they are both sober, <b>he</b> <b>concludes</b> <b>that</b> he is indeed gay, which relieves Kurt.|$|E
5|$|Newly {{promoted}} officer Ali Khan (Uday Chopra) and Jai Dixit (Abhishek Bachchan) {{are introduced}} to Shonali Bose (Bipasha Basu), a special officer assigned to investigate Mr. A's case, {{who also happens to}} be a former classmate of Jai. After the initial investigation, Dixit analyses the underlying trend in Mr. A's heists. <b>He</b> <b>concludes</b> <b>that</b> a theft will follow in one of two famous Mumbai city museums.|$|E
5|$|The case baffles Colton, as {{the only}} common {{elements}} in the murders are the lack of entry points and the apparent removal of the victims' livers with bare hands. Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) looks over the case and notes their similarity to earlier murder sprees that occurred in 1933 and 1963. At the crime scene, Mulder notices an elongated fingerprint on the air vent, which he also finds {{to be similar to}} some documented in the X-Files. <b>He</b> <b>concludes</b> <b>that</b> because five murders occurred during the earlier sprees, the investigators should expect two more.|$|E

5|$|Andrew Peck also {{considers}} the Slender Man {{to be an}} authentic form of folklore and notes its similarity to emergent forms of offline legend performance. Peck suggests that digital folklore performance extends the dynamics of face-to-face performance in several notable ways, such as by occurring asynchronously, encouraging imitation and personalization while also allowing perfect replication, combining elements of oral, written, and visual communication, and generating shared expectations for performance that enact group identity {{despite the lack of}} a physically present group. <b>He</b> <b>concludes</b> <b>that</b> the Slender Man represents a digital legend cycle that combines the generic conventions and emergent qualities of oral and visual performance with the collaborative potential of networked communication.|$|E
5|$|Boyer {{observes the}} {{distinction}} between how nonhuman animals can receive political protection {{as individuals and as}} species. He argues that the latter form of protection is motivated by a desire to preserve human experience of the species rather than the experiences of the nonhuman animals themselves. Politically motivated species advocacy, Boyer argues, is highly anthropocentric, as advocates present these animals as sharing in particular revered virtues; as a result, the likes of habitat and genetic health are the focus of advocates, rather than the nonhuman animals themselves. Using the example of polar bear preservation, Boyer illustrates how species advocacy becomes tied up with broader political goals concerning humans and competing visions of the value of animals. <b>He</b> <b>concludes</b> <b>that</b> the advancement of species advocacy can limit the achievement of animal welfare/rights goals.|$|E
5|$|He {{begins the}} section with an {{analysis}} of the temporal opening found in the skull of many extant birds. After a thorough comparison, he rejects the notion, which was common at the time, that this temporal opening was homologous with the supratemporal fenestra in reptiles. Instead, <b>he</b> <b>concludes</b> <b>that</b> it is a recent feature. Next he makes some observations on the wing structure of modern nestling birds. He finds that some species of extant birds have claws on their first and second fingers when very young, and some, like the hoatzin, will even use these temporary claws to climb about, including in the branches of trees. He also discovers that far more nestlings have a nonfunctional claw on the first digit, and some adult birds do as well.|$|E

5000|$|When Attorney General Thornburgh denied Doherty's {{motion to}} reopen, he offered three {{separate}} grounds for doing so. First, Thornburgh <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> Doherty did not present {{new evidence that}} warranted reopening. Second, <b>he</b> <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> Doherty had waived his claims to asylum and withholding of deportation when he abandoned those claims during the original deportation proceedings. Third, <b>he</b> <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> Doherty was ineligible for withholding of deportation and for asylum because he had committed [...] "serious nonpolitical crimes" [...] in Northern Ireland.|$|R
5|$|He {{describes}} {{the range of}} species in each group in some detail, concluding that the birds are unlike those {{of any of the}} surrounding countries and are quite isolated, but are related to those of distant places including New Guinea, Australia, India and Africa; he thinks there is nowhere else where so many such species occur in one place. Similarly in the Nymphalidae (he mentions the English member, the purple emperor butterfly), there are 48 species of which 35 are endemic to Celebes. <b>He</b> <b>concludes</b> <b>that</b> the Celebes group of islands is a major faunal division of the archipelago.|$|E
5|$|Otjes's {{approach}} is more empirical {{than that of}} many contributors to Political Animals and Animal Politics. He examines the Dutch Party for the Animals (PvdD), which, in 2006, won two seats in the House of Representatives. Otjes explores whether the PvdD's presence has changed {{the amount of time}} more established parties spent on animal issues by examining both parliamentary speeches and motions before and after the introduction of the PvdD members. He finds that established parties began to talk more about animal issues in 2006, and that this could be attributed to conflict between the PvdD and the established parties. Though Otjes allows that his study's relevance may seem limited, <b>he</b> <b>concludes</b> <b>that</b> smaller parties can affect government agenda by remaining focused on their own primary concern.|$|E
5|$|Previous authors (Kristjánsson cites Joel Feinberg, Alan Wertheimer and Robert Nozick) {{provided}} {{moral and}} statistical analyses of various thought experiments {{to determine whether}} the proposals they involve are threats or offers. On Kristjánsson's account, by contrast, all of the thought experiments considered are throffers. Instead, he argues, the previous thinkers' analyses attempted to differentiate offers that limit freedom from those that do not. They conflate two tasks, that of differentiating threats and offers and that of differentiating freedom-restricting threats from non-freedom-restricting threats. <b>He</b> <b>concludes</b> <b>that</b> the thinkers' methods are also inadequate for determining the difference between freedom-restricting and non-freedom-restricting threats, for which a test of moral responsibility would be required.|$|E

5|$|Tanasescu {{explores the}} idea of rights for nature, an idea which, though unorthodox, has seen success in implementation. He first {{introduces}} the concept, {{with a focus on}} the differences between moral and legal rights, before examining the particular case of Ecuador's entrenchment of rights for nature in its 2008 constitution, which is compared with other real-world cases. He finally addresses what can be learnt from these theoretical and practical considerations. <b>He</b> <b>concludes</b> <b>that</b> much work on the topic is left to be done, but the key lesson to be learnt is the significance of innovation; environmental politics, he claims, should remain both inventive and optimistic.

5|$|A {{reference}} to the Consolatio made by the Christian theologian Jerome in a consolation letter to Heliodorus of Altino concerning the death of St. Nepotian suggests that the work was heavily based on the Greek philosopher Crantor's ancient work De Luctu ("On Grief"). Paul MacKendrick argues that the general outline for the Consolatio can be deduced based both on the structure used by Servius Sulpicius Rufus in a consolation letter sent to Cicero following Tullia's death, {{as well as the}} structure of Cicero's reply. From what little remains of the work, {{it would appear that the}} piece was addressed to Cicero himself. A novel part of the Consolatio seems to be Cicero's idea that Tullia deserves to be deified as a god. Cicero notes that, in order for his plan to work, her assent must both be recognized by the gods, as well as the Roman public. In order to win over the public, <b>he</b> <b>concludes</b> <b>that</b> he will build Tullia a shrine.|$|E
5|$|The third episode {{takes up}} events {{eighteen}} {{years prior to}} the present, where Gregory and Shigaraki are called to defend Issei Tenkai from the charge of murdering fellow chef Isaku Hyōdō. Because the body has disappeared, Gregory and prosecutor Manfred von Karma cannot make much progress, but von Karma coerces Tenkai into falsely confessing to being an accomplice. This leads to Gregory accusing von Karma of forging evidence which lead to the infamous DL-6 Incident. In the present, the chef Yutaka Kazami is almost killed in an art gallery run by Tenkai's assistant Tsukasa Oyashiki. Yumihiko is assigned to prosecute under Mikagami's direction, but Edgeworth still investigates. <b>He</b> <b>concludes</b> <b>that</b> Oyashiki killed Hyōdō and attempted to kill Kazami; Oyashiki admits to the latter crime, but accuses Kazami of being Hyōdō's murderer. Kazami admits to murdering Hyōdō, who he had conspired with to cheat in a cooking contest, but had then been betrayed by. Kazami and Oyashiki are jailed, and Tenkai is freed.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, President Shinra becomes {{suspicious}} of the Turks activities, believing that someone within the organization is leaking sensitive information. <b>He</b> <b>concludes</b> <b>that</b> it must be Veld, and removes him from command, instead placing the company's security leader Heidegger in charge. In his first operation however, Heidegger nearly destroys Junon, and the President reinstates Veld. In his first mission back in command, Veld plans to defeat AVALANCHE. An assault is launched at a Mako Reactor, during which Rufus Shinra is revealed to be the traitor supporting AVALANCHE. He is captured by the Turks and placed under house arrest. At the same time, Shears defects to the Turks {{in an effort to}} save the gravely ill Elfé. Veld discovers that Elfé is his daughter Felicia, whom he thought dead in a botched Shinra operation, and resigns from the Turks. With Elfé continuing to weaken, Fuhito takes over the command of AVALANCHE. It is revealed that a Materia owned by Elfé is Zirconiade, an ancient and powerful summoned monster that Fuhito intends to use to destroy humanity and stop them harming the planet. However, the Materia is broken, and is slowly draining Elfé's life energy. To save her, the four Support Materia must be found. Fuhito holds one, and the Turks and Shears hold another.|$|E
