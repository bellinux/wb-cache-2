5|$|The role of {{wildfire}} <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>one</b> {{for plant}} and animal species diversity. Many tree species have evolved to mainly germinate after a wildfire. Regions of the park that have experienced wildfire in historical times have greater species diversity after reestablishment than those regions that have not been influenced by fire. Though the Yellowstone fires of 1988 had minimal impact on Grand Teton National Park, studies conducted before and reaffirmed after that event concluded than the suppression of natural wildfires during the middle part of the 20th century decreased plant species diversity and natural regeneration of plant communities. One study conducted 15 years before the 1988 Yellowstone National Park fires concluded that human suppression of wildfire had adversely impacted Aspen tree groves and other forest types. The majority of conifer species in Grand Teton National Park are heavily dependent on wildfire and this is particularly true of the Lodgepole Pine. Though extremely hot canopy or crown fires tend to kill Lodgepole Pine seeds, lower severity surface fires usually result in a higher post wildfire regeneration of this species. In accordance with {{a better understanding of the}} role wildfire plays in the environment, the National Park Service and other land management agencies have developed Fire Management Plans which provide a strategy for wildfire management and are expected to best enhance the natural ecosystem.|$|E

25|$|In {{statistics}} and numerical analysis, {{the problem of}} numerical methods for linear least squares <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>one</b> because linear regression models {{are one of the}} most important types of model, both as formal statistical models and for exploration of data sets. The majority of statistical computer packages contain facilities for regression analysis that make use of linear least squares computations. Hence it is appropriate that considerable effort has been devoted to the task of ensuring that these computations are undertaken efficiently and with due regard to numerical precision.|$|E
25|$|An {{apparent}} magnitude 4.18 type A0p star, Lambda Boötis is {{the prototype of}} a class of chemically peculiar stars, only some of which pulsate as Delta Scuti-type stars. The distinction between the Lambda Boötis stars as a class of stars with peculiar spectra, and the delta Scuti stars whose class describes pulsation in low-overtone pressure modes, <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>one.</b> While many Lambda Boötis stars pulsate and are delta Scuti stars, not many delta Scuti stars have Lambda Boötis peculiarities, since the Lambda Boötis stars are a much rarer class whose members can be found {{both inside and outside}} the delta Scuti instability strip. Lambda Boötis stars are dwarf stars that can be either spectral class A or F. Like BL Boötis-type stars they are metal-poor. Scientists have had difficulty explaining the characteristics of Lambda Boötis stars, partly because only around 60 confirmed members exist, but also due to heterogeneity in the literature. Lambda has an absolute magnitude of 1.8.|$|E
500|$|The first {{explicit}} History of Mysore in English is Historical Sketches of the South of India, in {{an attempt}} to trace the History of Mysoor (...) , by Mark Wilks. Wilks claimed to have based his history on various Kannada language documents, many of which have not survived. According to , all subsequent histories of Mysore have borrowed heavily from Wilks's book for their pre-1760 content. These include, , Lewis Rice's well-known Gazetteer and , C. Hayavadana Rao's major revision of the Gazetteer half a century later, and many modern spin-offs of these two works. In Subrahmanyam's words, [...] "Wilks's work <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>one</b> therefore, not only for its own sake, but for its having been regurgitated and reproduced time and again with minor variations." ...|$|E

500|$|Similar {{confusion}} {{is involved in}} objections that evolution is [...] "unproven," [...] since no theory in science {{is known to be}} absolutely true, only verified by empirical evidence. This distinction <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>one</b> in philosophy of science, {{as it relates to the}} lack of absolute certainty in all empirical claims, not just evolution. Strict proof is possible only in formal sciences such as logic and mathematics, not natural sciences (where terms such as [...] "validated" [...] or [...] "corroborated" [...] are more appropriate). Thus, to say that evolution is not proven is trivially true, but no more an indictment of evolution than calling it a [...] "theory." [...] The confusion arises in that the colloquial meaning of proof is simply [...] "compelling evidence," [...] in which case scientists would indeed consider evolution [...] "proven." ...|$|E

By connecting with his associates, Ryan states, it's [...] "valuable {{when it comes to}} figuring out how to motivate somebody (...) because I want that guy to fight for me, just like I want to fight for him." [...] Fullback Tony Richardson, in an interview, stated Ryan [...] "loves his football team, loves his players" [...] and does as much as he possibly can to ensure their success. Despite his boisterous and brash comments that have caused increased media coverage of the team, Ryan has taken the attention and has managed to [...] " [...] it on himself" [...] so the players can focus on their tasks. Ryan has also stressed that the teaching process <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>one,</b> {{particularly when it comes to}} providing a player information and building chemistry. However, there has to be flexibility as the process must also be insightful and positive. Ryan states that coaches are responsible for providing players with information that is vitally important otherwise [...] "if you emphasize everything, you've emphasized nothing." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Church of the East {{was headed}} by the Patriarch of the East, an office that traces its origin to the Apostolic Age. The head of the church also bears the title [...] "Catholicos". Like the churches from which it developed, the Church of the East has an ordained clergy divided into the three {{traditional}} orders of deacon, priest (or presbyter), and bishop. Also like other churches, it has an episcopal polity: organisation by dioceses, each headed by a bishop and made up of several individual parish communities overseen by priests. Dioceses are organised into provinces {{under the authority of}} a metropolitan bishop. The office of metropolitan bishop <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>one,</b> and comes with additional duties and powers; canonically, only metropolitans can consecrate a patriarch.

Shiva offered him a choice: a virtuous son who would live 16 years, or 100 long-lived, foolish sons. Mrikandu chose the former and accordingly had a son, whom he named Markandeya. As Markandeya neared {{the end of his}} fifteenth year, the god Brahma taught him a mantra named Mahamrityunjaya Mantra (means [...] "the great death-conquering" [...] mantra- Sanskrit) that conquered death and blessed him with long life. As per Brahma's advice, Markandeya prayed to Shiva, worshipping the linga (Shiva's aniconic symbol) south of Vilvavanam, later identified with the present Thirukkadavoor. The gods pleaded with Shiva to extend Markandeya's life and Shiva consented.|$|E
