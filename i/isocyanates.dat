5|$|A {{number of}} {{industries}} and sources have been implicated, including {{high levels of}} dust in coal mining, gold mining, and the cotton textile industry, occupations involving cadmium and <b>isocyanates,</b> and fumes from welding. Working in agriculture is also a risk. In some professions the risks have been estimated as equivalent to that of one half to two packs of cigarettes a day. Silica dust and fiberglass dust exposure {{can also lead to}} COPD, with the risk unrelated to that for silicosis. The negative effects of dust exposure and cigarette smoke exposure appear to be additive or possibly more than additive.|$|E
5|$|Nitrogen {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} elements in organic chemistry. Many organic functional groups involve a carbon–nitrogen bond, such as amides (RCONR2), amines (R3N), imines (RC(=NR)R), imides (RCO)2NR, azides (RN3), azo compounds (RN2R), cyanates and <b>isocyanates</b> (ROCN or RCNO), nitrates (RONO2), nitriles and isonitriles (RCN or RNC), nitrites (RONO), nitro compounds (RNO2), nitroso compounds (RNO), oximes (RCR=NOH), and pyridine derivatives. C–N bonds are strongly polarised towards nitrogen. In these compounds, nitrogen is usually trivalent (though it can be tetravalent in quaternary ammonium salts, R4N+), with a lone pair that can confer basicity on the compound by being coordinated to a proton. This may be offset by other factors: for example, amides are not basic because the lone pair is delocalised into a double bond (though they may act as acids at very low pH, being protonated at the oxygen), and pyrrole is not acidic because the lone pair is delocalised as part of an aromatic ring. The amount of nitrogen in a chemical substance can be determined by the Kjeldahl method. In particular, nitrogen is an essential component of nucleic acids, amino acids and thus proteins, and the energy-carrying molecule adenosine triphosphate and is thus vital to all life on Earth.|$|E
25|$|Aliphatic and cycloaliphatic <b>isocyanates</b> {{are used}} in smaller quantities, most often in {{coatings}} and other applications where color and transparency are important since polyurethanes made with aromatic <b>isocyanates</b> tend to darken on exposure to light. The most important aliphatic and cycloaliphatic <b>isocyanates</b> are 1,6-hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI), 1-isocyanato-3-isocyanatomethyl-3,5,5-trimethyl-cyclohexane (isophorone diisocyanate, IPDI), and 4,4′-diisocyanato dicyclohexylmethane, (H12MDI or hydrogenated MDI).|$|E
50|$|The <b>isocyanate</b> {{functional}} {{groups in}} TDI react with hydroxyl groups to form carbamate (urethane) links. The two <b>isocyanate</b> groups in TDI react at different rates: The 4-position is approximately {{four times more}} reactive than the 2-position. 2,6-TDI is a symmetrical molecule and thus has two <b>isocyanate</b> groups of similar reactivity, similar to the 2-position on 2,4-TDI. However, since both <b>isocyanate</b> groups {{are attached to the}} same aromatic ring, reaction of one <b>isocyanate</b> group will cause a change in the reactivity of the second <b>isocyanate</b> group.|$|R
50|$|IPDI {{exists in}} two {{stereoisomer}}s, cis and trans. Their reactivities are similar. Each stereoisomer is an unsymmetrical molecule, and thus has <b>isocyanate</b> groups with different reactivities. The primary <b>isocyanate</b> group is more reactive than the secondary <b>isocyanate</b> group.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we have {{developed}} simple though efficient test method for evaluating both isocyanurate formation and <b>isocyanate</b> degree of conversion using FT-IR analyses and have applied them to polyisocyanurate-polyurethane foams to verify {{the reliability of the}} results obtained and evaluate the influence of <b>isocyanate</b> index on both these quantities. We have also characterised the foams from a physical-mechanical point of view and demonstrated that the dimensional stability and compression strength of polymers are closely related to isocyanurate content and therefore to <b>isocyanate</b> index. The results obtained have clearly revealed that an increase in <b>isocyanate</b> index leads to an increase in trimer content and consequently to an improvement of mechanical properties; on the other hand, an increase in the <b>isocyanate</b> index brings about a decrease in <b>isocyanate</b> conversion. Moreover, since isocyanurate content and free <b>isocyanate</b> amount affect the fire behaviour of the foam we will apply the procedure proposed in this article to analyse the influence of both factors on the fire behaviour of such foams; the results of our research will be published in a future work...|$|R

25|$|Polyurethane {{polymers}} {{are traditionally}} and most commonly formed by reacting a di- or poly-isocyanate with a polyol. Both the <b>isocyanates</b> and polyols {{used to make}} polyurethanes contain, on average, two or more functional groups per molecule.|$|E
25|$|The {{properties}} of a polyurethane are {{greatly influenced by}} the types of <b>isocyanates</b> and polyols used to make it. Long, flexible segments, contributed by the polyol, give soft, elastic polymer. High amounts of crosslinking give tough or rigid polymers. Long chains and low crosslinking give a polymer that is very stretchy, short chains with lots of crosslinks produce a hard polymer while long chains and intermediate crosslinking give a polymer useful for making foam. The crosslinking present in polyurethanes means that the polymer consists of a three-dimensional network and molecular weight is very high. In some respects a piece of polyurethane {{can be regarded as}} one giant molecule. One consequence of this is that typical polyurethanes do not soften or melt when they are heated; they are thermosetting polymers. The choices available for the <b>isocyanates</b> and polyols, in addition to other additives and processing conditions allow polyurethanes to have the very wide range of properties that make them such widely used polymers.|$|E
25|$|Polyurethane polymer is a {{combustible}} {{solid and}} can be ignited if exposed to an open flame. Decomposition from fire can produce significant amounts of carbon monoxide and hydrogen cyanide, in addition to nitrogen oxides, <b>isocyanates,</b> and other toxic products. Because of the flammability of the material, {{it has to be}} treated with flame retardants (at least in case of furniture), almost all of which are considered harmful.|$|E
30|$|<b>Isocyanate</b> resin, on {{the other}} hand, allows boards to be {{manufactured}} from high-moisture particles without lowering the bonding strength [4, 6]. Therefore, <b>isocyanate</b> resin {{is likely to be}} more effective than urea–formaldehyde resin for high-moisture particles. In this study, <b>isocyanate</b> resin bonded boards were manufactured from high-moisture particles using an air-injection press, and the blowout conditions and board properties were evaluated.|$|R
30|$|Since <b>isocyanate</b> resin is expensive, {{the total}} cost of board {{production}} must be reduced. When using an air-injection press, {{it is not necessary to}} dry particles in advance, thereby reducing the cost [1]. Moreover, <b>isocyanate</b> resin releases carbon dioxide during hot pressing [6] and is more prone to blowouts than urea–formaldehyde resin [7]. Therefore, the air-injection press should also prove effective in preventing the blowouts of <b>isocyanate</b> resin bonded boards.|$|R

25|$|Consolidation is {{the process}} in which the fabric of the ceramic is {{strengthened}} by introducing a material into the fabric that will bind together. The most common ceramics that need consolidation are excavated pieces because they tend to have lost their bonding fabrics due to leeching or have absorbed soluble salts. A consolidant works in two ways: it either links to the particles in the ceramic chemically or it may form a support system mechanically without reacting with the fabric itself. Chemical consolidants that are used in modern conservation include <b>isocyanates,</b> silanes, siloxnes, and methyl methacrylates, however the consolidants that create a mechanical support system are used more frequently.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Isocyanates</b> {{used to make}} {{polyurethane}} {{have two}} or more isocyanate groups on each molecule. The most commonly used <b>isocyanates</b> are the aromatic diisocyanates, [...] toluene diisocyanate (TDI) and methylene diphenyl diisocyanate, MDI.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Isocyanates</b> {{are very}} {{reactive}} materials. This makes them useful in making polymers but also requires special care in handling and use. [...] The aromatic <b>isocyanates,</b> diphenylmethane diisocyanate (MDI) or toluene diisocyanate (TDI) are more reactive than aliphatic <b>isocyanates,</b> such as hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) or isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI). Most of the <b>isocyanates</b> are difunctional, that {{is they have}} exactly two isocyanate groups per molecule. An important exception to this is polymeric diphenylmethane diisocyanate, which {{is a mixture of}} molecules with two, three, and four or more isocyanate groups. In cases like this the material has an average functionality greater than two, commonly 2.7.|$|E

2500|$|MDI is {{the least}} {{hazardous}} of the commonly available <b>isocyanates</b> but is not benign.

However, it, like the other <b>isocyanates,</b> is an allergen and sensitizer. [...] Persons developing sensitivity to <b>isocyanates</b> may have dangerous systemic reactions to extremely small exposures, including respiratory failure. [...] Handling MDI requires strict engineering controls and personal protective equipment. Compared to other organic cyanates, MDI has a relatively low human toxicity.

2500|$|Some {{noteworthy}} {{recent efforts}} have been dedicated to minimizing the use of <b>isocyanates</b> [...] to synthesize polyurethanes, because the <b>isocyanates</b> raise severe toxicity issues.

2500|$|TDI and MDI are {{generally}} {{less expensive and}} more reactive than other <b>isocyanates.</b> Industrial grade TDI and MDI are mixtures of isomers and MDI often contains polymeric materials.

30|$|The {{investigation}} {{showed that}} boards blow out {{due to a}} rise in vapor pressure inside the board. <b>Isocyanate</b> resin is known to produce carbon dioxide during its curing and {{is believed to be}} more vulnerable to blowouts than urea–formaldehyde resin [7]. However, this study showed that the high bonding strength of <b>isocyanate</b> resin prevented blowouts. On the other hand, the board inside during hot pressing is a high-temperature and high-pressure vapor atmosphere, which may inhibit the curing of urea–formaldehyde resin. This reduces bonding strength [5, 12] and causes blowouts. However, the curing of <b>isocyanate</b> resin is hardly affected by high-temperature and high-pressure vapor, and so the bonding strength remains strong [4, 12]. Therefore, <b>isocyanate</b> resin may not be vulnerable to blowouts.|$|R

2500|$|Polyurethanes, {{especially}} those made using aromatic <b>isocyanates,</b> contain chromophores that interact with light.

When PU foam, which is made using aromatic <b>isocyanates,</b> is exposed to visible light, it discolors, turning from off-white to yellow to reddish brown. It has been generally accepted that apart from yellowing, visible light has little effect on foam properties. This is especially the case if the yellowing happens on the outer portions of a large foam, as the deterioration of properties in the outer portion has little effect on the overall bulk properties of the foam itself.|$|E
