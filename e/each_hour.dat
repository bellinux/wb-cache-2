5|$|In September 2000, Harries' {{portfolio}} {{was significantly}} expanded {{when he was}} appointed Granada's controller of drama, following the resignations of Sue Hogg and Simon Lewis. 2002 commissions included Doctor Zhivago and Henry VIII. ITV would provide only £750,000 for <b>each</b> <b>hour</b> of the serials, so Harries approached US broadcaster WGBH {{to make up the}} remaining funds. Following the merging of Granada Films with Granada Productions in 2002, Harries' brief was expanded to include films.|$|E

It is served and {{operated}} by Great Western Railway and served by CrossCountry, with services to Manchester, Birmingham, Cardiff, Bristol, London, Exeter, Plymouth and Penzance, {{as well as the}} rest of the West Country. There are generally one fast and one slow trains <b>each</b> <b>hour</b> to both Bristol Temple Meads and Exeter St Davids and one train to London Paddington.|$|E
5|$|In late November 1918 the 4th Division began a road {{march of}} more than 125 miles from the French city of Metz toward the German city of Koblenz, on the Rhine River. The final {{destination}} of Middleton's 47th Regiment would be the town of Adenau, 35 miles due west of Koblenz. The road trip took fifteen days of moving through almost incessant rain and ended in a driving snowstorm on 15 December. During the march, Middleton broke character and rode a horse during most of each day, surveying his troops and occasionally dismounting to talk with them. The formation marched for fifty minutes of <b>each</b> <b>hour,</b> and rested for ten, with a full hour for lunch.|$|E

5|$|Mendelevium was {{discovered}} by bombarding einsteinium with alpha particles in 1955, the same method still used to produce it today. It was named after Dmitri Mendeleev, father of the periodic table of the chemical elements. Using available microgram quantities of the isotope einsteinium-253, over a million mendelevium atoms may be produced <b>each</b> <b>hour.</b> The chemistry of mendelevium is typical for the late actinides, with a preponderance of the +3 oxidation state but also an accessible +2 oxidation state. Owing to the small amounts of produced mendelevium {{and all of its}} isotopes having relatively short half-lives, there are currently no uses for it outside basic scientific research.|$|E
5|$|Like the series, {{the game}} takes place over 24 hours {{and has the}} same start and end clocks for <b>each</b> <b>hour,</b> marking the start and end of {{each part of the}} game. The hours are broken down into 58 {{separate}} missions, of which there are three broad types, each described in further detail below. Some missions are objective based, while others have a time-restricted element. Each mission is graded out of 100 points, based on the quality of performance, number of objectives completed, shooting accuracy and so on. A grade of 90 points or higher rewards the player by unlocking some form of bonus feature, including three movies (interviews with cast about the game, TV promos), 98 images (wallpaper-like images of main characters) and 23 characters (3D models that the player can view).|$|E
5|$|Street {{entertainment}} at Covent Garden {{was noted}} in Samuel Pepys's diary in May 1662, when he recorded the first {{mention of a}} Punch and Judy show in Britain. Impromptu performances of song and swimming were given by local celebrity William Cussans in the eighteenth century. Covent Garden is licensed for street entertainment, and performers audition for timetabled slots {{in a number of}} venues around the market, including the North Hall, West Piazza, and South Hall Courtyard. The courtyard space is dedicated to classical music only. There are street performances at Covent Garden Market every day of the year, except Christmas Day. Shows run throughout the day and are about 30 minutes in length. In March 2008, the market owner, CapCo, proposed to reduce street performances to one 30-minute show <b>each</b> <b>hour.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Langoliers is {{a horror}} miniseries {{consisting}} of two episodes of 1½ <b>hours</b> <b>each</b> (two <b>hours</b> <b>each</b> with commercials).

Kappes. The miniseries originally aired May 14-15, 1995 on the ABC network.|$|R

25|$|Charging times vary {{depending}} on the ESS's state-of-charge, the available voltage, and the available circuit breaker amp rating (current). In a best case scenario using a 240 V charger on a 90 A circuit breaker, Tesla documents a recharging rate of -of-range for <b>each</b> <b>hour</b> charging; a complete recharge from empty would require just under 4 hours. The slowest charging rate using a 120V outlet on a 15 A circuit breaker would add -of-range for <b>each</b> <b>hour</b> charging; a complete recharge from empty would require 48 hours.|$|E

25|$|The new {{timetable}} {{concentrated on}} key points at Oxted, East Grinstead and the Ashurst-Groombridge-Birchden triangle. It also introduced {{the concept of}} a regular hourly service. Off-peak services now departed Victoria for East Grinstead and Tunbridge Wells West at 8 minutes past the hour, and from Tunbridge Wells West for Victoria at 47 minutes past the hour. A push-and-pull service worked the section from Tunbridge Wells West via Edenbridge Town, connecting at Oxted with London trains. A push-pull service was also introduced between Three Bridges and East Grinstead, also providing connections on the main line in both directions. London trains were scheduled to cross in the High Level for a few minutes <b>each</b> <b>hour,</b> ensuring that at a certain time <b>each</b> <b>hour</b> all three trains were together in the station. At Groombridge connections were made with Brighton and Eastbourne services.|$|E
