50|$|<b>Inflation</b> <b>accounting</b> {{is a term}} {{describing}} a range of accounting models designed to correct problems arising from historical cost accounting {{in the presence of}} high inflation and hyperinflation. <b>Inflation</b> <b>accounting</b> is used in countries experiencing high inflation or hyperinflation. For example, in countries experiencing hyperinflation the International Accounting Standards Board requires corporations to implement financial capital maintenance in units of constant purchasing power in terms of the monthly published Consumer Price Index. This does not result in capital maintenance in units of constant purchasing power since that can only be achieved in terms of a daily index.|$|E

50|$|IAS 29 Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies is the IASB´s <b>inflation</b> <b>accounting</b> model {{authorized}} in April 1989. IAS 29 {{requires the}} implementation of financial capital maintenance in units of constant purchasing power {{in terms of the}} monthly published CPI. That requirement does not result in actual capital maintenance in units of constant purchasing power since that can only be achieved with following all changes in the general price level; i.e., at least daily changes. The ineffectiveness of IAS 29 was clearly demonstrated with its implementation during the final 8 years of hyperinflation in Zimbabwe. IAS 29 had no positive effect in Zimbabwe: the Zimbabwean economy imploded on 20 November 2008 with full implementation of IAS 29. The IASB has not yet changed IAS 29 to require daily indexing.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of financial reporting {{is to provide}} information about an entity which is useful {{to a wide range of}} users in making economic decisions. This study empirically investigates the utility of <b>inflation</b> <b>accounting</b> data to investors, by examining the ability of this data to explain the share prices of UK listed companies. Previous research supports a relation between historical cost accounting data and share prices from a conceptual and empirical perspective. Prior evidence from studies on the utility of <b>inflation</b> <b>accounting</b> data to investors is mixed. However, many of these suffer from methodological problems which cast doubts on their ability to evaluate the utility of <b>inflation</b> <b>accounting</b> data. This study overcomes some of the problems encountered in earlier studies and incorporates additional research design features. In evaluating <b>inflation</b> <b>accounting</b> data, this study explores whether or not company policy towards the disclosure of <b>inflation</b> <b>accounting</b> data in the premandatory period is associated with the explanatory power of this data. The investigation was undertaken for 2 periods to discover whether or not a learning lag exists in relation to the <b>inflation</b> <b>accounting</b> data. To achieve the objectives of this study, a recently developed cross sectional valuation model was used. The model incorporates measures from both the balance sheet and income statement, which allows the value relevance of key financial report disclosures to be assessed. The analysis reveals evidence supporting the utility of <b>inflation</b> <b>accounting</b> data to investors. The results show that a company 2 ̆ 7 s policy towards disclosing <b>inflation</b> <b>accounting</b> data in the premandatory period is associated with the explanatory power of this data. The significance of the <b>inflation</b> <b>accounting</b> data appears to be greater for the companies disclosing <b>inflation</b> <b>accounting</b> data in the premandatory period (Supportive Companies), than for companies which commenced disclosure in the first mandatory period (Reluctant Companies).

40|$|A {{number of}} economists have stated, and two recent {{empirical}} studies have suggested, that financial globalization should exert {{a positive effect}} on macroeconomic outcomes in general and inflation in particular. We re-examine the impact of such openness on inflation by exploiting a recent index of capital controls which improves on previous binary measures. In addition, we include one key variable missing from the previous studies-money growth. We find, as did the previous studies, that in the absence of money growth financial (and trade) openness appear to lower inflation. However, once previous money growth is taken into account, financial (and even a proxy for trade) openness exerts no significant effect at all on <b>inflation.</b> Capital <b>Account,</b> <b>Inflation...</b>|$|R

The study aims to recommend an <b>inflation</b> <b>accounting</b> approach which will provide government and managements with information required for decision-making and control.

In order to achieve this object, a field study has been conducted to discover whether <b>inflation</b> <b>accounting</b> systems are well known and used in Iraqi companies. Moreover, the study examines and assesses the different accounting measurements which have been suggested for financial reports during periods of inflation. In the light of an evaluation of different accounting methods advocated for use during inflation times, a system is recommended for use in Iraqi Industrial Companies. This study starts with the assumption that management needs accounting information which takes into account changes in prices; is provided frequently and in enough detail; is provided on time, and is relevant to management information needs.
