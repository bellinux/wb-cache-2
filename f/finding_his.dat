50|$|After <b>his</b> <b>findings</b> were published, many {{attempted}} to discredit Lai {{in order to}} suppress <b>his</b> <b>findings.</b> Cell phone proponents have funded their own research to confuse the subject and mitigate <b>his</b> <b>findings.</b>|$|R
5|$|There was an {{undercurrent}} theme involving Bruce having repressed memories of {{an aspect of}} his parents' death that he hadn't faced which was <b>finding</b> <b>his</b> father's diary {{on the night of}} his parents' wake and reading that Bruce insisted his parents go to the theater so he could watch one of the shows, meaning the reason he became Batman was out of the guilt that he killed them.|$|E
5|$|American photojournalist Andrew Kaulder (Scoot McNairy) {{receives}} {{a call from}} his employer, who tasks Andrew with <b>finding</b> <b>his</b> daughter, Samantha Wynden (Whitney Able), and escorting {{her back to the}} US. Andrew locates Samantha in a Mexican hospital and the pair board a train, until learning the tracks ahead have been damaged. They discover that if they do not leave the country within a few days, sea and air travel will be blocked for six months. Andrew and Samantha decide to hitchhike their way to the coast.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the season, Underwood is trying to erase all links to Russo's death. Thus, he kills Barnes by shoving her in front of an oncoming Washington Metro train, and frames her colleague and lover Lucas Goodwin (Sebastian Arcelus) for cyberterrorism. Another early task for newly promoted Underwood is <b>finding</b> <b>his</b> own replacement as House Majority Whip. He supports Jacqueline Sharp (Molly Parker), a military veteran and third-term Representative from California, although he refrains from offering public backing.|$|E

25|$|Despite the {{thoroughness}} of Kistiakowsky’s work, it was {{not complete}} and needed further evidence to back up <b>his</b> <b>findings.</b> <b>His</b> work was a crucial first step to {{the beginnings of the}} ideas of hyperconjugation and conjugation effects.|$|R
50|$|Ultimately, his {{recommendations}} for breast-cancer treatment won {{the approval of}} the medical establishment. “In 1985,” reported the Atlantic, “the New England Journal of Medicine published two of Fisher’s studies that definitively proved” <b>his</b> earlier <b>findings.</b> <b>His</b> recommended approach to treating breast cancer thereafter gained universal acceptance.|$|R
5|$|Hoshino based the {{character}} on a celebrity whose identity {{she refused to}} reveal. Primarily a clown in his early appearances, she later gave him a human form which would have an unspecified impact in the series. Critical reaction to the Millennium Earl has been positive, with critics <b>finding</b> <b>his</b> revival {{of the dead and}} killing of humans appealingly ironic. His enigmatic depth in the sequel, D.Gray-man Hallow, was also praised. A variety of merchandise based on {{the character}} has been released.|$|E
5|$|Moreau {{accompanied}} Desaix's Left Wing {{with the}} divisions of Delmas and Sainte-Suzanne (vice Beaupuy), Bourcier's Reserve and Saint-Cyr's cavalry and horse artillery which were ineffective in the mountains. Malsch was captured twice by the French and recaptured each {{time by the}} Austrians. Latour tried to force {{his way around the}} French left with cavalry but was checked by the mounted troops of the Reserve. <b>Finding</b> <b>his</b> horsemen outnumbered near Ötigheim, Latour used his artillery to keep the French cavalry at bay. In the Rhine plain the combat raged until 10 PM. In the evening the Austrians were pushing Desaix back when bad news from the left flank caused Charles to call a halt.|$|E
5|$|No. 4 Commando {{was formed}} in Weymouth on 21 July 1940, when the first intake of 500 volunteers arrived. The unique nature of the commandos {{immediately}} became apparent when every man was held responsible for <b>finding</b> <b>his</b> own quarters. As commandos {{were expected to be}} fighting troops, they had no administrative personnel, such as clerks and cooks for example. To assist them with living 'off camp', with no cook house all ranks were given a daily allowance and a ration card, the allowance being 67 pence for officers and of 34 pence for other ranks. This arrangement meant that commandos lived on civilian rations, {{while the rest of the}} armed forces had the more plentiful military scale of rations.|$|E
50|$|Todd won the June 14 primary with 49 {{percent of}} the vote, without voters knowing about the report's {{preliminary}} <b>findings.</b> <b>His</b> closest challenger, Leon T. Andrews, Jr., had 40.8 percent. Todd was unopposed in the general election. Once more, voters remained {{in the dark about}} the report's finding.|$|R
30|$|In sum, Maslow {{acknowledged}} that his methodology was lacking, {{and he tried}} to draw tentative conclusions regarding <b>his</b> <b>findings.</b> <b>His</b> hope was that future researchers would extend his ideas and investigate them more rigorously, but by following the aforementioned methodological guidelines, he could have avoided these shortcomings altogether. The fact that <b>his</b> <b>findings</b> are still so highly regarded and regularly debated underscores the interesting and important findings that exemplar research- even flawed exemplar research- can uncover.|$|R
25|$|Friedrich Sertürner {{isolated}} morphine from opium in 1804. Morphine was {{the first-ever}} alkaloid isolated from any plant. Sertürner {{wanted to prove}} <b>his</b> <b>findings</b> to <b>his</b> colleague with a public experiment on himself and three other friends.|$|R
5|$|Tamagnino {{is known}} to have left Brescia while the {{construction}} of the sanctuary was ongoing, evidently <b>finding</b> <b>his</b> work undervalued and underpaid. The reasons for the bias are unclear, but it is possible that Cairano enjoyed local favour, especially from the directors of the company commissioning the shrine, which allowed him to prevail over Tamagnino despite the latter's technical superiority. Tamagnino then won the prestigious contract for the façade of the Certosa of Pavia, to be installed under the aegis of Father Amedeo and Antonio Mantegazza. The corporate pact between the artist and the two sculptors strengthened in May 1492, providing Tamagnino with a unique training experience as well as a remarkable leap in his career.|$|E
5|$|The game's protagonist is the unnamed Rookie, a {{new member}} of the Orbital Drop Shock Troopers. Troopers, known as ODSTs or Helljumpers, often deploy in small, one-man Human Entry Vehicles (HEVs), {{launched}} from spaceships in the upper atmosphere. The Rookie is assisted in <b>finding</b> <b>his</b> teammates by Mombasa's city maintenance AI, called the Superintendent or Virgil. The Rookie's teammates are Buck, Dutch, Romeo, Mickey, and Dare. The lattermost is a UNSC Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) {{agent in charge of}} the squad's operation.|$|E
5|$|They trace Hoffman to his home, <b>finding</b> <b>his</b> {{equipment}} {{used to create}} the chemical agent downstairs but no sign of Hoffman.

50|$|Peter Kropotkin, while aide de camp to the {{governor}} of Transbaikalia in the 1860s, was appointed to inspect {{the state of the}} prison system in the area; he later described <b>his</b> <b>findings</b> in <b>his</b> book In Russian and French Prisons (1887).|$|R
5|$|Vaughan Williams {{was born}} to a well-to-do family with strong moral views and a {{progressive}} social outlook. Throughout his life he sought to be of service to his fellow citizens, and believed in making music as available as possible to everybody. He wrote many works for amateur and student performance. He was musically a late developer, not <b>finding</b> <b>his</b> true voice until his late thirties; his studies in 1907–08 with the French composer Maurice Ravel helped him clarify the textures of his music.|$|E
5|$|According to naval {{historian}} Ian Buxton, {{the most}} important role of the Royal Navy was to blockade the Dardanelles and thus guard the Eastern Mediterranean against a breakout by Goeben. On 12 January 1918, Rear-Admiral Arthur Hayes-Sadler hoisted his flag aboard Lord Nelson at Mudros as the new commander of the Aegean Squadron. Needing transportation to Salonika for a conference with the British Army commander there, and <b>finding</b> <b>his</b> personal yacht unavailable, Hayes-Sadler opted to have Lord Nelson take him there, and thus she was not present when Goeben and Breslau finally made their breakout attempt on 20 January. The ship could not {{get back to the}} Dardanelles in time to participate in the resulting Battle of Imbros or intercept Goeben before she gained shelter in the Dardanelles. Lord Nelson was later given a short refit at Malta in October.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to the present and retrieving three magical stones to complete the wand, Oliver learns that his mother Allie {{was in fact the}} great sage, Alicia. Realizing she could not defeat Jabou, and that he had destroyed his soulmate in the other world to avoid the possibility of being defeated through them, she chose to travel into both the future and into Oliver's world in the hopes of <b>finding</b> <b>his</b> next soulmate; after settling into this new world, she eventually gave birth to her son, Oliver, who unknowingly became Jabou's soulmate. After he is defeated, Jabou's past is shown. He was once a soldier who helped a young girl against orders, and whose hometown was destroyed to set an example. The spirit of Alicia talks to the dying Jabou, who realises that the girl he saved was the young Alicia herself. Jabou then uses his power to sever the link between himself and Oliver, in order to save Oliver from dying as well.|$|E
25|$|In 1929, {{he resumed}} {{excavations}} {{and the new}} findings were divided. That year, Oppenheim also founded the Max-von-Oppenheim-Stiftung to ensure work on <b>his</b> <b>findings</b> continued after <b>his</b> death.|$|R

5|$|After {{returning}} to the present and retrieving three magical stones to complete the wand, Oliver learns that his mother Allie {{was in fact the}} great sage, Alicia. Realizing she could not defeat Shadar, and that he had destroyed his soulmate in the other world to avoid the possibility of being defeated through them, she chose to travel into both the future and into Oliver's world in the hopes of <b>finding</b> <b>his</b> next soulmate; after settling into this new world, she eventually gave birth to her son, Oliver, who unknowingly became Shadar's soulmate. After he is defeated, Shadar's past is shown. He was once a soldier who helped a young girl against orders, and whose hometown was destroyed to set an example; a being known as the White Witch called to him to embrace his despair and become the Dark Djinn, Shadar. The spirit of Alicia talks to the dying Shadar, who realises that the girl he saved was the young Alicia herself. Shadar then uses his power to sever the link between himself and Oliver, in order to save Oliver from dying as well.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of his mother Ishwari, Ajay Ghale (James A. Woods) returns to his home country of Kyrat to carry out Ishwari's final wish by {{returning}} her ashes to Lakshmana. However, his mission is interrupted when the bus he is traveling on is attacked by the Royal Army and he is taken prisoner by Pagan Min (Troy Baker), the country's eccentric and violent king, who claims to have been romantically involved with Ishwari. After <b>finding</b> <b>his</b> way through Pagan's mansion, Ajay escapes with the aid of Sabal (Naveen Andrews), a commander in the Golden Path, a rebel movement established by Ajay's father, Mohan Ghale. Ajay is not able to leave the country as the Royal Army has taken control of Kyrat's only airport and sealed the borders.|$|E
5|$|Mahayana, writing elsewhere, sees Karman as {{undergoing}} {{an existential}} quest {{to establish his}} identity, seemingly finding an answer in the PKI but ultimately becoming trapped by them. Mahayana indicates that a religious message is evident beginning with the novel's opening, in which Tohari provides a four-line quote from an old Javanese text regarding faith and becoming more explicit later on. He finds Karman's dealing with the raftsman Kastagethek while escaping from the government the most explicit expression of Tohari's intent; unlike Karman, Kastagethek is a devout yet simple man who is happy in his poverty, leading Karman to question his own views before ultimately <b>finding</b> <b>his</b> identity in Islam. Mahayana thus argued that Kubah was meant as dawah, or Islamic preaching, with its message that humans should recognise their status as creatures of God conveyed through characters' dialogue and actions.|$|E
50|$|Bennett's {{other more}} {{unconventional}} interest was in ghosts. He {{was a member}} of the Council of the Society for Psychical Research, and spent much time investigating haunted houses. While he undoubtedly hoped for positive <b>findings,</b> <b>his</b> rigorous and systematic scientific approach left him empty handed in the end. He wrote extensively on the subject, and was regularly interviewed by the BBC.|$|R
