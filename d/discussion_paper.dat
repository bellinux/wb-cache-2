25|$|At the 2006 Victoria state election, the Labor Government costed the {{construction}} of the Doncaster rail line at around $1 billion. Other costings have been as high as $3 billion. In 2008, the Australian Greens Victoria released a transport <b>discussion</b> <b>paper,</b> The People Plan, which costed {{the construction}} of the line at $450 million. The Age newspaper quoted a 2012 report by transport experts from various Australian universities that suggested the line could be built for $840 million, being funded by the increase in property prices of the surrounding areas (although the report has not been made publicly available for review).|$|E
25|$|The {{claims that}} there is no {{consensus}} is without merit. About 10 years ago, when opposition formed the central government, they had proposed retail reforms and suggested India consider FDI in retail. Retail reforms discussions are not new. More recently, retail reforms announced evolved after a process of intense consultations and consensus building initiative. In 2010, the Indian government circulated a <b>discussion</b> <b>paper</b> on FDI retail reforms. On 6 July 2011, another version of the <b>discussion</b> <b>paper</b> was circulated by the central government of India. Comments from a wide cross-section of Indian society including farmers' associations, industry bodies, consumer forums, academics, traders' associations, investors, economists were analysed in depth before the matter was discussed by the Committee of Secretaries. By early August 2011, the consensus from various segments of Indian society was overwhelming in favour of retail reforms. The reform outline was presented in India's Rajya Sabha in August 2011. The announced reforms are the result of this consensus process. The current opposition is not helping the consensus process, since consensus is not built by threats and disruption. Those who oppose current retail reforms should help build consensus with ideas and proposals. The opposition parties currently disrupting the Indian parliament on retail reforms have not offered even one idea or a single proposal on how India can eliminate food spoilage, reduce inflation, improve food security, feed the poor, improve the incomes of small farmers.|$|E
25|$|Krugman {{has also}} been {{influential}} {{in the field of}} international finance. As a graduate student, Krugman visited the Federal Reserve Board, where Stephen Salant and Dale Henderson were completing their <b>discussion</b> <b>paper</b> on speculative attacks in the gold market. Krugman adapted their model for the foreign exchange market, resulting in a 1979 paper on currency crises in the Journal of Money, Credit, and Banking, which showed that misaligned fixed exchange rate regimes are unlikely to end smoothly: instead, they end in a sudden speculative attack. Krugman's paper {{is considered one of the}} main contributions to the 'first generation' of currency crisis models, and it is his second-most-cited paper (457 citations as of early 2009).|$|E
