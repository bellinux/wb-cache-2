25|$|White House Press Secretary, Robert <b>Gibbs</b> <b>said</b> {{the effort}} to get a team in place {{to respond to the}} health scare has not been {{hindered}} by the lack of a secretary of Health and Human Services or appointees in any of the department’s 19 key posts. The president's nominee, Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius, was still awaiting confirmation from the U.S. Senate until passing on April 28. The President has not yet made appointments to either the Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, the Surgeon General, or the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The current acting Surgeon General, Steven K. Galson, is also currently serving as the Acting Assistant Secretary for Health.|$|E
500|$|Beach Thomas's war work led {{to state}} recognition, {{as it did}} for many of the correspondents and {{newspaper}} owners; France appointed him a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour in 1919 and he was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in 1920. In 1923, <b>Gibbs</b> <b>said</b> of the KBE award, which he too received: [...] "I was not covetous of that knighthood and indeed shrank from it so much that I entered into a compact with Beach Thomas to refuse it. But things had gone too far, and we could not reject the title with any decency." [...] This quandary was caused by realisation of the gulf between what they had reported and what had actually happened.|$|E
500|$|Mechanical effects {{supervisor}} George <b>Gibbs</b> <b>said</b> {{the film}} {{was the most difficult}} one of his career. He visited a museum to negotiate renting a small French World War I tank, but decided he wanted to make one. The tank was based on the Tank Mark VIII, which was [...] long and weighed [...] Gibbs built the tank over the framework of a [...] excavator and added [...] tracks that were driven by two automatic hydraulic pumps, each connected to a Range Rover V8 engine. Gibbs built the tank from steel rather than aluminum or fiberglass because it would allow the realistically suspensionless vehicle to endure the rocky surfaces. Unlike its historical counterpart, which had only the two side guns, the tank had a turret gun added as well. It took four months to build and was transported to Almería on a Short Belfast plane and then a low loader truck.|$|E

500|$|On June 3, White House Press Secretary Robert <b>Gibbs</b> <b>said</b> {{during his}} morning press briefing, [...] "I hope that {{baseball}} awards a perfect game to that pitcher", joking that the White House was [...] "going {{to work on}} an executive order" [...] to that effect. He elaborated, [...] "To watch an umpire take responsibility and to watch a pitcher do what he did, the type of sportsmanship that was exhibited there—I think that gives a lot of heart (...) I think it's tremendously heartening to see somebody understand that {{they made a mistake}} and somebody accept the apology from somebody who made that mistake. I think that's a good lesson in baseball." [...] Michigan state Governor Jennifer Granholm also issued a gubernatorial proclamation stating, in part, [...] "I, Jennifer M. Granholm, {{governor of the state of}} Michigan, do hereby declare Armando Galarraga to have pitched a perfect game." ...|$|E
500|$|During a February 2010 {{television}} interview, Sestak {{said that}} in July 2009 he was offered a job in President Obama's administration if {{he dropped out of}} the race. During a February 18 taping of Larry Kane: Voice of Reason, a Philadelphia-area local news show, host Larry Kane asked Sestak whether such an offer had been made, to which Sestak responded, [...] "Yes", without elaborating beyond that it was a high-ranking assignment and that he did not plan to take it. In subsequent press inquiries, Sestak repeatedly stood by his original statement. When asked about the matter by The Washington Post, he said, [...] "There has been some indirect means in which they were trying to offer things if I got out." [...] Likewise, during an appearance on the Fox News Channel, he said, [...] "I was asked a direct question yesterday and I answered it honestly. There's nothing more to go into. I'm in this race now." [...] Over the next month, White House officials did not answer multiple press inquiries about whether Sestak's claims were true. On March 16, White House Press Secretary Robert <b>Gibbs</b> <b>said</b> he had reviewed the matter and found conversations that had been held with Sestak were [...] "not problematic." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{impending}} {{opening of}} the Bushehr I plant in late 2010 prompted the White House to question why Iran is continuing to enrich uranium within its borders. [...] "Russia is providing the fuel, and taking the fuel back out," [...] White House spokesman Robert <b>Gibbs</b> <b>said</b> in August. [...] "It, quite clearly, I think, underscores that Iran does not need its own enrichment capability if its intentions, as it states, are for a peaceful nuclear program," [...] he said.|$|E

2500|$|The Tasmanian {{government}} (as well as {{the governments}} of Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland) opposed this action. Allowing the federal government such broad new powers would infringe on the States' power to legislate in many areas, and would upset the [...] "federal balance". Chief Justice <b>Gibbs</b> <b>said</b> that although all of the Constitution is open to interpretation, [...] "the external affairs power differs from the other powers conferred by s 51 in its capacity for almost unlimited expansion." [...] Defining which affairs were of “international character” was a difficult task for the court.|$|E
2500|$|Concerns that Karzai might {{reject the}} ECC {{findings}} in direct conflict with his main backer for eight years, the United States, led to continued intense American and ally {{pressure on him}} to accept a power-sharing deal or face a second round run-off. Senator John Kerry made an unplanned stop in Kabul to meet Karzai in the presidential palace [...] "to continue his discussions and consultations", according to the U.S. embassy. White House spokesperson Robert <b>Gibbs</b> <b>said</b> former U.S. army general Karl Eikenberry, the U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan, was engaged in [...] "delicate but extremely important" [...] efforts to persuade Karzai to accept the ECC's findings.|$|E
2500|$|Macquarie Group economists {{estimated}} {{the energy crisis}} could reduce gross domestic product growth by 0.25 percentage points in the third quarter, as gas prices increased {{and the percentage of}} gas production allocated to export reduced. Natural gas sales were worth $5.2billion in the 2006/2007 financial year, and its five-year trend growth rate is 16.8%. Chief Macquarie economist Richard <b>Gibbs</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "WA supplies the lion's share of the gas exports. The effect on exports is that as {{there is a shortage of}} gas in the system, the capability to export will be diminished because the gas that there is will be directed towards domestic use... The gas exports have been pretty healthy. In the next couple of quarters that will be moderated dramatically if not stalled altogether. I think this will have an impact on the broader commodities side and the trade gap could widen".|$|E

2500|$|At around 8:30 am on 10 March 1988, Gibb's {{doctor told}} Andy that more tests were needed. But later that day, he slumped into {{unconsciousness}} and {{died as a}} result of myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart muscle caused by a recent viral infection (a diagnosis supported by William Shell, a cardiologist who had previously treated Gibb), which was exacerbated by his years of cocaine abuse. Robin <b>Gibb</b> <b>said</b> [...] "he was also not eating properly and the lack of nutrition also damaged his heart," [...] adding that the paranoia associated with cocaine abuse [...] "shattered his confidence and he became scared of people." ...|$|R
2500|$|Across the globe, {{messages}} of sympathy and {{solidarity with the}} Filipino people were sent by various heads of state and international leaders. Pope Benedict XVI, {{in his letter to}} Archbishop Rosales, recalled Aquino's [...] "courageous commitment to the freedom of the Filipino people, her firm rejection of violence and intolerance" [...] and called her a woman of courage and faith. U.S. President Barack Obama, through White House Press Secretary Robert <b>Gibbs,</b> <b>said</b> that [...] "her courage, determination, and moral leadership are an inspiration to us all and exemplify the best in the Filipino nation". U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton expressed sadness over the passing of Aquino, to whom she had sent a personal letter of best wishes for recovery while she was still in hospital in July 2009. Clinton said that Aquino was [...] "admired by the world for her extraordinary courage" [...] in leading the fight against dictatorship. Meanwhile, South Africa President Jacob Zuma called Aquino [...] "a great leader who set a shining example of peaceful transition to democracy in her country".|$|E
2500|$|The Czech Republic, {{which held}} the {{presidency}} of the European Union, praised Netanyahu's address. [...] "In my view, this {{is a step in the}} right direction. The acceptance of a Palestinian state was present there," [...] said Czech Foreign Minister Jan Kohout, whose country held the EU's six-month presidency at the time of the speech. President Barack Obama's press secretary, Robert <b>Gibbs,</b> <b>said</b> that the speech was an [...] "important step forward". President Obama stated that [...] "this solution can and must ensure both Israel's security and the Palestinians' legitimate aspirations for a viable state". Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt stated that [...] "the fact that he uttered the word state is a small step forward". He added that [...] "whether what he mentioned can be defined as a state is a subject of some debate". France praised the speech but called on Israel to cease building settlements in the West Bank. French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner stated that [...] "I can only welcome the prospect of a Palestinian state outlined by the Israeli Prime Minister." [...] The Foreign Ministry of Russia called the speech [...] "a sign of readiness for dialogue" [...] but said that [...] "it does not open up the road to resolving the Israeli–Palestinian problem. The conditions on the Palestinians would be unacceptable." ...|$|E
2500|$|A few of {{the cables}} {{released}} by WikiLeaks concerned Clinton directly: they revealed that directions {{to members of the}} foreign service had gone out in 2009 under Clinton's name to gather biometric details on foreign diplomats, including officials of the United Nations and U.S. allies. These included Internet and intranet usernames, e-mail addresses, web site URLs useful for identification, credit card numbers, frequent flier account numbers, work schedules, and other targeted biographical information in a process known as the National Humint Collection Directive. State Department spokesman Philip J. Crowley said that Clinton had not drafted the directive and that the Secretary of State's name is systematically attached to the bottom of cables originating from Washington; it was unclear whether Clinton had actually seen them. The guidance in the cables was actually written by the CIA before being sent out under Clinton's name, as the CIA cannot directly instruct State Department personnel. The disclosed cables on the more aggressive intelligence gathering went back to 2008 when they went out under Condoleezza Rice's name during her tenure as Secretary of State. The practice of the U.S. and the State Department gathering intelligence on the U.N. or on friendly nations was not new, but the surprise in this case was that it was done by other diplomats rather than intelligence agencies, and that the specific types of information being asked for went beyond past practice and {{was not the kind of}} information diplomats would normally be expected to gather. In any case, the instructions given in these cables may have been largely ignored by American diplomats as ill-advised. Responding to calls from WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and a few others that Clinton possibly step down from her post due to the revelation, White House Press Secretary Robert <b>Gibbs</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "I think that is absurd and ridiculous. I think Secretary of State Clinton is doing a wonderful job." ...|$|E
50|$|This {{song was}} {{credited}} to The Fut. Years later, <b>Gibb</b> <b>said</b> {{that he had}} no idea how that happened. The record appeared in early 1970, with rumours that this song was one of The Beatles, perhaps a bootleg recording. The recording was so plausible as a Lennon song that Yoko Ono and Lenono Music, cleaning house in 1985, registered a copyright on it as a song written by John Lennon, even though Lennon had earlier denied participation in this song. Later in May 1974, on RSO tapes, this song was credited as a Kipner/Groves composition, although BMI listed it as by Kipner, Groves and Lawrie.|$|R
5000|$|In the Now is {{the second}} solo album by British singer-songwriter Barry Gibb, {{released}} on 7 October 2016 by Columbia Records. Although his second solo album (since 1984's Now Voyager), {{it is the first}} of all new material since the Bee Gees' final studio album This Is Where I Came In (2001). <b>Gibb</b> <b>said</b> of the album: [...] "This is a dream come true for me. It's a new chapter in my life. I always hoped one day that The Bee Gees would be with Columbia or indeed Sony so, it's a great joy for me to start again this way with such great people." ...|$|R
50|$|Gibbs's {{research}} was mainly in analytical and inorganic chemistry, especially the cobalt-amines, platinum metals, and complex acids.

60|$|At {{a general}} council of officers, Sammy and Captain Hubbell both {{declared}} {{that they were}} not willing to take any other path homeward except one which led along the seventieth line of longitude. That had brought them safely up, and it would take them safely down. If they went under the ice at some point eastward, how were they to find the seventieth line of longitude? They could not take observations down there; and they might have to go south on some other line, which would take them nobody knew where. Mr. <b>Gibbs</b> <b>said</b> little, but he believed that it would be well to go back the way they came.|$|E

Did I {{tell you what the}} Honourable Jack <b>Gibbs</b> <b>said</b> to me at the club? Ged, he let me have it straight! 'Buck,' he said, 'I don't mind you. You're one o' the right sort when all's said and done, but if you ever inthroduce such a chap as that to me again, I'll cut you as well as him for the future.'

50|$|The {{issue of}} Scottish Home Rule entered the {{campaign}} through {{the intervention of}} the Young Scots. The Liberal Government had introduced a Scottish Home Rule Bill that had passed its second reading in May 1913, despite Unionist opposition. The Young Scots were critical of Gibb's lack of support for the policy.Leading Labour Party figure, Robert Smillie speaking during the campaign in support of <b>Gibb</b> <b>said</b> any miner who did not vote Labour was a traitor to his class and he threatened those miners who did would be black-legged. Countering for the Liberal campaign, J.M. Robertson argued that anyone voting for Gibb would be the traitor; He argued that Gibb had no chance of success and that any vote for him risked letting in the anti-democratic Tory which would damage the interests of the workers.|$|R
5000|$|Following {{the deaths}} of his {{brothers}} Maurice and Robin Gibb in 2003 and 2012, respectively, Barry Gibb thought his music career was over: [...] "I was ready to quit. I was done. There {{was no point in}} going on any further. I’ve done solo work my whole life but never felt like a solo artist." [...] <b>Gibb</b> <b>said</b> he [...] "gave up for a long time" [...] until he became interested in writing songs again. The album was written with his sons Stephen and Ashley Gibb, which according to Barry Gibb meant [...] "there was this huge personal thing going on between the three of us for the whole of this album" [...] and [...] "that you could say whatever it is you’ve got to say and be as honest as you can".|$|R
