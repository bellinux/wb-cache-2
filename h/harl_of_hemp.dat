40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{the impact}} of mean size <b>of</b> anisometric <b>hemp</b> shives {{particles}} (length) on compressive strength and other parameters of lightweight composites is studied. Sample <b>of</b> <b>hemp</b> shive with a wide lengths distribution (8 – 0. 2 mm; mean length: 33. 7 mm) and two separated fractions (< 4 mm and 4 - 8 mm) with mean length of particles 7. 3 mm and 27. 7 mm {{were used in the}} experiments. Composites based on MgO-cement as a binder with a constant ratio <b>of</b> <b>hemp</b> shives (40 vol. %) were prepared.

Effect of mean length <b>of</b> <b>hemp</b> shives slices on the above mentioned characteristics of fibrous composites was confirmed. Values of density and compressive strength of fibrous composites increase with decreasing length <b>of</b> <b>hemp</b> shive slices.

This paper presents an analysis of cetane numbers and low-temperature properties <b>of</b> <b>hemp</b> biodiesels as well as spray and evaporation of these fuels. Two types <b>of</b> <b>hemp</b> biodiesel fuels are analyzed: Hemp Methyl esters, produced from hemp oil in Ukraine (HM 1) and European Union (HM 2). It was found that hemp biodiesel has smaller cetane number than traditional rapeseed or soy biodiesel. At the same time hemp biodiesel shows better low-temperature properties compared with traditional biodiesels. So, it was recommended to use the mixture of rapeseed or soy biodiesel with hemp biodiesel to optimise both the low-temperature properties and cetane number of fuel. According to modelling the spray parameters <b>of</b> <b>hemp</b> biodiesel are very close to those of soy biodiesel. Evaporation <b>of</b> <b>hemp</b> biodiesel is very close to soy biodiesel according to previous research. Therefore, mixture <b>of</b> soy/rapeseed and <b>hemp</b> biodiesels can be recommended for experimental investigation as a future fuel for Ukrainian market. ...|$|R

40|$|Hemp shiv {{has been}} widely used as a plant {{aggregate}} incorporated into natural building composites such as hemp-lime due to its low thermal conductivity and high moisture buffer value. The aim {{of this research is}} to study the intrinsic physical parameters such as the porosity and cell wall structure <b>of</b> <b>hemp</b> shiv, which are responsible for the favourable thermal and hygric properties <b>of</b> <b>hemp</b> shiv. Scanning electron microscope observations <b>of</b> <b>hemp</b> shiv revealed microstructural features. A computed tomography (CT) scan improved the vizualization of pore shape and pore connectivity in three dimensions. The vessels exhibit little variation in size and there is no clear pore arrangement with a diffuse-porous distribution. The vessels are mostly solitary although some small groups of adjacent vessels exhibit shared cell walls between them. The vessels are approximately 50 to 100 μm in diameter and are surrounded by relatively thick fibre cells. These thick-walled fibres are located between the vessels with a diameter ranging from 1 μm to 2 μm. The pore frequency <b>of</b> <b>hemp</b> shiv (generally only measured on diffuse-porous woods) is around 20. 8 vessels/mm 2. The porosity <b>of</b> <b>hemp</b> shiv has been studied by a combination of mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) and CT scanning.
