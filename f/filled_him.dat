5|$|As {{a student}} holidaying in coastal towns, Hesketh had {{become aware of}} the lack of resorts in Lancashire. He was {{concerned}} that the working classes of Lancashire could not afford to travel south for their holidays as wealthy people like him could. The number of railways in Great Britain steadily increased {{in the first half of}} the 19th century, and Hesketh was impressed by the arrival in 1828 of the steam locomotive in Lancashire. As High Sheriff of Lancashire, he attended the opening of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway on 15 December 1830. The event <b>filled</b> <b>him</b> with great excitement at the idea of bringing the railway to the coast and enabling Lancashire mill workers to take day-trips to the seaside.|$|E

In the novel Desolation Island (1978), he recalls that he had been [...] " [...] a {{midshipman}} stationed on the lower deck of the Ardent, 64 , when the Vrijheid killed or wounded one hundred and forty-nine of the his shipmates out of four hundred and twenty-one and reduced the Ardent to something very nearly a wreck: this, and all that he head heard of the Dutch, <b>filled</b> <b>him</b> with respect for their seamanship and their fighting qualities." ...|$|E
500|$|Nijinsky's genius as {{a dancer}} would {{translate}} {{into the role of}} ballet-master; he was not dissuaded when Nijinsky's first attempt at choreography, Debussy's L'après-midi d'un faune, caused controversy and near-scandal because of the dancer's novel stylised movements and his overtly sexual gesture at the work's end. It is apparent from contemporary correspondence that, at least initially, Stravinsky viewed Nijinsky's talents as a choreographer with approval; a letter he sent to Findeyzen praises the dancer's [...] "passionate zeal and complete self-effacement". However, in his 1936 memoirs Stravinsky writes that the decision to employ Nijinsky in this role <b>filled</b> <b>him</b> with apprehension; although he admired Nijinsky {{as a dancer}} he had no confidence in him as a choreographer: [...] "...the poor boy knew nothing of music. He could neither read it nor play any instrument". Later still, Stravinsky would ridicule Nijinsky's dancing maidens as [...] "knock-kneed and long-braided Lolitas".|$|E

He reads a random section in which Elmer and his brother Joseph were attacked by Ben. [...] Jake confronts Ben and accuses him of only pretending to be his parents’ friend. Ben becomes angry and tells Jake {{that it was a}} different time, and that he would not understand. Ben reveals that there were a few chickens who became intelligent prior to 1979, and that he met one at the poultry where he worked. Ben recognized that the chicken was aware, but he beat it to death with a brick out of fear. This <b>filled</b> <b>him</b> with guilt, so when all chickens gained awareness he protected the three he could – Elmer, Helen, and Joseph. Ben suggests Jake read the whole diary from beginning and offers to add context if he can.|$|E

Due to the time difference, the game would be occurring during {{the early morning hours}} in Vladivostok. Ford then instructed his military aide Bob Barrett to wake him up at 6:00am the next morning with the result of the game, which he did: [...] "Twelve to ten". Ford responded: [...] "Wait a minute.

2500|$|The poem {{begins with}} Tithonus {{speaking}} to Eos [...] "at the quiet {{limit of the}} world" [...] (line 7) where he lives with her. Confronted with old age and its attendant pains, he meditates upon death and mortality, and mourns the fact that death cannot release him from his misery. He recounts how Eos, choosing him to be her lover, had <b>filled</b> <b>him</b> with so much pride that he had seemed [...] "To his great heart none other than a God!" [...] (14). Though she carelessly granted him immortality at his asking, he could not escape the ravages of time. The Hours aged him and his youth and beauty faded away−-"But thy strong Hours indignant work'd their wills / And beat me down and marr'd and wasted me" [...] (18–19). He asks Eos to set him free−-"Let me go; take back thy gift" [...] (27)−-and questions why anyone should desire that which is unattainable.|$|E

On the contrary, they <b>filled</b> <b>him</b> with the desire for reconciliation and understanding among people. He and his dream triumphed. His vision and kindness saved the South African people from suffering and hardships. Nelson Mandela with his unstoppable run towards freedom left to humanity a heritage of immense and eternal value, the model of transformation of an epoch and of a life of goodness and wisdom. In my name and on behalf of the Albanian people I would like to extend our deep condolences to his spouse, Graça Machel, to his entire family and to the people of South Africa. We, Albanians join the South African people and whole world in this grief." [...] (spelling and grammar corrected) ...|$|E

2500|$|The Matterhorn {{remained}} unstudied {{for more}} than two centuries, until a geologist from Geneva, Horace Benedict de Saussure, travelled to the mountain, which <b>filled</b> <b>him</b> with admiration. However, de Saussure was not moved to climb the mountain, and had no hope of measuring its altitude by taking a barometer to its summit. [...] "Its precipitous sides," [...] he wrote, [...] "which give no hold to the very snows, are such as to afford no means of access." [...] Yet his scientific interest was kindled by [...] "the proud peak which rises to so vast an altitude, like a triangular obelisk, that seems to be carved by a chisel." [...] His mind intuitively grasped the causes which gave the peak its present precipitous form: the Matterhorn was not like a perfected crystal; the centuries had laboured to destroy a great part of an ancient and much larger mountain. On his first journey de Saussure had come from Ayas to the Col des Cimes Blanches, from where the Matterhorn first comes into view; descending to Breuil, he ascended to the Theodul Pass. On his second journey, in 1792, he came to the Valtournanche, studying and describing it; he ascended to the Theodul Pass, where he spent three days, analysing the structure of the Matterhorn, whose height {{he was the first to}} measure, and collecting stones, plants and insects. He made careful observations, from the sparse lichen that clung to the rocks to the tiny but vigorous glacier fly that fluttered over the snows and whose existence at such heights was mysterious. At night he took refuge under the tent erected near the ruins of an old fort at the top of the pass. During these days he climbed the Klein Matterhorn (3,883 metres), which he named the Cime Brune du Breithorn.|$|E
2500|$|Rabbi Johanan {{taught that}} God proclaims three things for God's Self: famine, plenty, {{and a good}} leader. 2 Kings [...] shows that God proclaims famine, when it says: [...] "The Lord {{has called for a}} famine." [...] shows that God proclaims plenty, when it says: [...] "I will call for the corn and will {{increase}} it." [...] And [...] shows that God proclaims a good leader, when it says: [...] "And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, ‘See I have called by name Bezalel, the son of Uri.'" [...] Rabbi Isaac taught that we cannot appoint a leader over a community without first consulting the people, as [...] says: [...] "And Moses said unto the children of Israel: ‘See, the Lord has called by name Bezalel, the son of Uri.'" [...] Rabbi Isaac taught that God asked Moses whether Moses considered Bezalel suitable. Moses replied that if God thought Bezalel suitable, surely Moses must also. God told Moses that, all the same, Moses should go and consult the people. Moses then asked the Israelites whether they considered Bezalel suitable. They replied that if God and Moses considered Bezalel suitable, then surely they had to, as well. Rabbi Samuel bar Nahmani said in the name of Rabbi Johanan that Bezalel ( [...] , whose name can be read , betzel El, [...] "in the shadow of God") was so called because of his wisdom. When God told Moses (in [...] ) to tell Bezalel to make a tabernacle, an ark, and vessels, Moses reversed the order and told Bezalel to make an ark, vessels, and a tabernacle. Bezalel replied to Moses that as a rule, one first builds a house and then brings vessels into it, but Moses directed to make an ark, vessels, and a tabernacle. Bezalel asked where he would put the vessels. And Bezalel asked whether God had told Moses to make a tabernacle, an ark, and vessels. Moses replied that perhaps Bezalel had been in the shadow of God ( [...] , betzel El) and had thus come to know this. Rav Judah taught in the name of Rav that [...] indicated that God endowed Bezalel with the same attribute that God used in creating the universe. Rav Judah said in the name of Rav that Bezalel knew how to combine the letters by which God created the heavens and earth. For [...] says (about Bezalel), [...] "And He has <b>filled</b> <b>him</b> with the spirit of God, in wisdom and in understanding, and in knowledge," [...] and [...] says (about creation), [...] "The Lord by wisdom founded the earth; by understanding He established the heavens," [...] and [...] says, [...] "By His knowledge the depths were broken up." ...|$|E
