5|$|In December 2012 Clinton {{was hospitalized}} {{for a few}} days for {{treatment}} of a blood clot in her right transverse venous sinus. Her doctors had discovered the clot during a follow-up examination for a concussion she had sustained when she fainted and fell nearly three weeks earlier, as a result of severe dehydration from a viral intestinal ailment acquired during a trip to Europe. The clot, which caused no immediate neurological injury, was treated with anticoagulant medication and her <b>doctors</b> <b>have</b> said she has made a full recovery.|$|E
5|$|After enjoying life as {{a billionaire}} for a few days, Homer decides to throw a party before Burns returns. He heads to Moe's Tavern to buy some beer and invite his friends to the party. However, Moe informs Homer {{that he can not}} sell him alcohol on account of it being Sunday before 2:00 PM. After Homer is told {{the only way he could}} buy alcohol would be to sail out to {{international}} waters where there are no laws, he and his friends (including his son Bart) set sail in Burns' private yacht to throw the party there. Back at the Mayo Clinic, Burns discovers that he not only has all previously discovered diseases, but numerous new diseases the <b>doctors</b> <b>have</b> just discovered in him. However, the sheer number of diseases prevents any one disease from actually doing harm to him. This leads Burns to (incorrectly) conclude that he is indestructible, even though the doctors protest that even a slight breeze could disrupt the balance in his body.|$|E
5|$|Gregory House, M.D., often {{construed}} as a misanthropic medical genius, heads a team of diagnosticians at the Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital in New Jersey. Most episodes revolve around the diagnosis of a primary patient and start with a cold open set outside the hospital, showing events ending {{with the onset of}} the patient's symptoms. The typical episode follows the team in their attempts to diagnose and treat the patient's illness, which often fail until the patient's condition is critical. They usually treat only patients whom other <b>doctors</b> <b>have</b> not accurately diagnosed, and House routinely rejects cases that he does not find interesting. The story lines tend to focus on his unconventional medical theories and practices, and on the other characters' reactions to them, rather than on the details of the treatments.|$|E

60|$|Could she {{possibly}} {{come out}} by the next train? Bailey was very ill. Bailey was dying. Bailey had come home last night looking ghastly. He had not slept. In the early morning {{he had begun to}} babble--Mrs. Bailey's voice had risen and broken on the word, and Ruth {{at the other end of}} the wire had heard her frightened sobs. The <b>doctor</b> <b>had</b> come. The <b>doctor</b> <b>had</b> looked awfully grave. The <b>doctor</b> <b>had</b> telephoned to New York for another doctor. They were both upstairs now. It was awful, and Ruth must come at once.|$|R

25|$|Doctors, too, {{have changed}} professions {{and joined the}} {{international}} mobility trend. Filipino <b>doctors</b> <b>have</b> begun leaving their professions to train as nurses under the title MD-RN {{with the hope of}} immigrating to the U.S. or other developed nations more easily. Since 2000, 3,500 Filipino <b>doctors</b> <b>have</b> migrated abroad as nurses. The U.S. incentives for nurse migration encourage doctors to train as nurses in the hopes of increasing their economic prospects. As a result, the Philippines have a lower average of doctors and nurses with 0.58 and 1.69 respectively for a population of 1,000. The average statistics globally in contrast are 1.23 and 2.56. Between 2002 and 2007, 1,000 Filipino hospitals closed due to a shortage of health workers. A study conducted by the former Philippine Secretary of Health, Jaime Galvez-Tan, concluded that close to 80% of government <b>doctors</b> <b>have</b> become nurses or are studying nursing. Of the 9,000 doctors-turned-nurses, 5,000 are working overseas. The extraordinary influence of this international migration has had devastating effects on the health of Filipinos. The number of deaths that were not prevented with medical attention have increased as hospitals are shut down and rural areas are deprived of any medical treatment.|$|E
25|$|Much of Britain's legal {{structure}} concerning {{health care and}} medicine was reviewed and modified {{as a result of}} Shipman's crimes.

25|$|As of 29 June, {{there are}} 523 {{confirmed}} cases. The Ministry of Health changed plan from 'Containment' to 'Care in the Community'. There is 1 critical case in Hawkes Bay.

25|$|Unlike other countries, until {{recently}} Spain has registered a comparatively {{small number of}} Doctor degree holders, but the tendency is changing. According to the Spanish Statistical Office (INE), less than 5% of M.Sc. degree holders are admitted to Ph.D. programs.

25|$|This {{controversial}} tone lessened {{after the}} initial results reported a successful first month after Ecopass implementation.

25|$|There are {{currently}} sixteen doctors providing specialised medical care in Kiribati, with sixteen more scheduled to join them. Cubans have also offered training to I-Kiribati doctors.

In response, the Solomon Islands began recruiting Cuban doctors in July 2007, while Papua New Guinea and Fiji considered following suit.|$|E
