While <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>do</b> naval planning, his team prepared plans that coordinated land, air and sea operations. A staff study might be put into effect and become an operation, or MacArthur might shelve it {{in favor of an}} alternative operation, especially if the staff study revealed that it would be too time-consuming, difficult or costly. The three teams would work simultaneously on three different objectives in leapfrog fashion. Tarbuck routinely attended staff conferences that involved naval matters.|$|E
5|$|In {{his second}} {{meeting of the}} day with Scully and Doggett, Wells {{explains}} that he cannot remember the last few days. Scully suggests that maybe <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>do</b> it. Wells begins having flashes of the murder but they are unclear. Waiting in his cell, he kills a spider. Later, a nanny cam from his house reveals that {{the only person to}} arrive between the police’s arrival and the last time his wife is on camera is Martin Wells. Eventually, Wells meets his lawyers and tells them about the nanny cam. However, it turns out that it is Wednesday: Wells is somehow “living the week backwards”.|$|E

25|$|For a year {{he tried}} his luck in West Germany at SV Meppen, a club then {{active in the}} Regionalliga Nord. Derksen, living in Emmen, found it too hard to travel over 400 {{kilometers}} to Haarlem and back every day. Meppen is just across the Dutch-German border, so that's where he went. He didn't play many games though. What <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>do</b> was fight a lot with every one.|$|E
25|$|Born in Onitsha, he {{attended}} Dennis Memorial Grammar School {{in his home}} town and displayed the characteristics that would later define his life. He trained in the high jump under his games teacher, and he also {{took part in a}} protest that closed down the school for a term. He {{graduated from high school in}} 1951. Ilesa Grammar School also claims him as a past alumnus. This is disputed, although <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>do</b> summer school teaching at the institution.|$|E
500|$|Davis was {{recalled}} on August 25 after Andruw Jones {{went on the}} DL and Blalock struggled. On September 8, in {{the second}} game of a doubleheader, he had three hits and four RBI, including a three-run home run against José Veras in a 105 victory over the Cleveland Indians. When Davis returned to the majors, his numbers improved dramatically, as he hit [...]318 in September and October, with five home runs and 21 RBIs in the two-month span. In 113 games (391 at bats), Davis batted [...]238 with 93 hits, 15 doubles, 21 home runs, and 59 RBI. However, he ranked seventh in the AL with 150 strikeouts. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>do</b> well defensively; Washington said, when Blalock replaced him at first following his demotion, [...] "We can't expect Hank Blalock to be Chris Davis , but Hank is a professional. I think he can play first base." ...|$|E

500|$|Deciding to let Simpson stay {{at their}} house, word soon gets out of Simpson's {{presence}} in Quahog, causing Peter to decide to throw a house party and help everyone else {{get to know him}} better. Later that day, Peter and Simpson are met with an angry mob instead led by Mayor Adam West, intent on driving the latter out of town. Desperate for a place to live without being bothered by furious citizens, Simpson makes a heartfelt speech, professing that he is just as imperfect as everyone else, causing the residents of Quahog to apologize and embrace with him. A split second later, however, the tables turn to a surprise ending as Simpson takes out a knife and kills three people before running off. A furious mob goes on to chase after Simpson, as the Griffins look on, with Peter, wearing a guilty disappointed look, indifferently declaring, [...] "I guess <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>do</b> it." ...|$|E
500|$|During the 1990s, Reubens kept a low profile, {{dedicating}} {{himself to}} writing and collecting {{a variety of}} things, [...] "everything from fake food, to lamps", although <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>do</b> some dubbing and took small parts in films such as 1992's Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Tim Burton's Batman Returns (Reubens portrayed the Penguin's father) and 1996's Matilda and Dunston Checks In. In 1993, he voiced for a character in another one of Burton's productions, The Nightmare Before Christmas. (Reubens would later voice Lock for the video game [...] in 2004.) During the mid-1990s, Reubens played a recurring role on the TV series Murphy Brown. The role earned him positive reviews and his first and only non-Pee-wee Emmy nomination, for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series. He appeared six times on the show between 1995 and 1997. Afterward, Reubens began working on an NBC pilot entitled Meet the Muckles, a show that {{would be based on}} You Can't Take It with You. The project got stuck in development hell, and was later dropped when Reubens' ideas grew too elaborate and expensive, although Philip Rosenthal blamed NBC's negative response on Reubens being on a [...] "blacklist".|$|E
500|$|Nixon infused {{elements}} of those literatures into the Dimitri and Natalie romance with as well. [...] "There's a gothic quality to it", she said, {{referring to the}} couple. [...] "It's Wuthering Heights or Jane Eyre. Everybody loves somebody who has a past and a secret- and certainly Dimitri does- which we haven't divulged yet. That heightens ones interest and suspense. It's a special situation but what really makes it special is the actor's talent, personalities, good looks, and chemistry." [...] Since the writers created Dimitri as a very mysterious character, Michael Nader mostly {{stayed away from the}} press in order to help maintain that image. Whenever <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>do</b> an interview, he discussed the character {{in such a way as}} to add more mystery. Nader compared Dimitri to the Dynasty character he once portrayed, Dex Dexter. On Dynasty, [...] "John James (Jeff Colby) played the 'aw, shucks;' nice guy, and I played the guy who was on the edge, who would take care of business and not take any bull", he said. [...] "Dimitri is sort of a darker Dex. Though I don't know exactly how dark to make him yet." [...] Nader, as an actor, also provided the writers with more inspiration on the character. [...] "The more we see of him, the more he inspires us", Broderick said. [...] "It's just a wonderful marriage of actor and character He's giving us so many levels and such depth, that it's a challenge. But it's exciting. Dimitri is one of the characters that is so much fun to write." ...|$|E

2500|$|In humanist fashion, Leland styled himself antiquarius, a title {{which was}} at one time {{interpreted}} as referring to a formal appointment as [...] "king's antiquary": however, it is now understood to have been merely Leland's own preferred way of describing himself. There {{is no evidence that}} he personally oversaw the relocation of the books to their new home or received a librarian's wages. What <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>do</b> was to compile his lists of important volumes, and to take measures to encourage their preservation.|$|E

As a tactician, one of Jones' strong points was his ability to spot {{opposition}} weaknesses. Before we played Wales in 1984, he suggested we play the blinds. He had noticed the Welsh No. 8 Eddie Butler, had not played for three weeks and he had a hunch he would not be fit. So the first chance I got I went down the blind side and from that we scored under the posts." ...|$|E

A {{representative}} for the firm (Marly Rusoff), however, revealed in March 1993 that the company shipped 133,000 copies of the book, and took around 80,000 returns and 3000 reorders. Thus, the project was close to 60% down in total sales. Rusoff stated that the commercial performance of Dancing the Dream was low because an anticipated Jackson tour of the United States never occurred. He commented, [...] "The reviews—and there were some—were rather discouraging. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>do</b> a Europe tour and the British edition did quite well.

2500|$|By 1950, {{the rise}} of McCarthyism led to Wattenberg leaving Argonne, first {{to go to the}} University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign for a year, and then to MIT, where he {{remained}} until 1958. He used MIT's synchrotron to study the properties of nucleons and K-mesons, gaining important insights that would later be incorporated into the standard model. In 1958, he was recruited by the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign. Although <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>do</b> some teaching, he was largely free to work at Argonne and the Brookhaven National Laboratory on his research into [...] K-meson decay. He published a paper with J.J. Sakurai in 1967 about his efforts to distinguish matter from antimatter. He worked on the giant scintillation counters at Fermilab, and directed searches for charm quark s there with photon and neutron beams, and at SLAC using colliding electron-positron beams. Between 1953 and 2003, he was the author of over 115 papers. He retired in 1986.|$|E
