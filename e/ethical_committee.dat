In half of the local <b>ethical</b> <b>committees,</b> penalties for non-compliance with the regulations are considered. The average number of research project evaluated in last session of these committees was 15. 2 and the committees in 50 % of cases have provided ethics training specifically for their members. Conclusions: Policymakers should develop a standard guideline for local <b>ethical</b> <b>committees</b> in medical science universities in Iran...|$|R
