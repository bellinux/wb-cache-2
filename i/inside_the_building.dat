5|$|Apart from stun grenades, {{the policemen}} did not fire a single shot. After {{securing}} the restaurant, the police let {{in a large}} number of medical personnel. The only person alive who remained <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> was Gabriel, who had been hiding in the bathroom for the entire duration of the incident.|$|E
5|$|Designers {{restored}} the light corridors <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> during the remodel. These two central light courts allowed more natural lighting {{into the interior}} of the building. Additionally, the old Fourth Avenue entrance was restored, and the address was changed to 1221 S.W. Fourth Avenue. Renovations also {{restored the}} original look of the City Council chamber, with council members now facing the windows.|$|E
5|$|Located at the {{southwest}} corner of Ellis Avenue and 55th Street, the Ratner Center has an award-winning design that substitutes a complex external mast and counterweight system for interior support devices to allow for large open-space areas <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>building.</b> Cesar Pelli & Associates Inc. was credited as the design architect and OWP/P was the architect of record.|$|E

25|$|As {{state schools}} are public, smoking is universally {{prohibited}} <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>buildings.</b> Smoking teachers are generally {{asked not to}} smoke while at or near school.|$|R
5|$|After Monica Dawson (Dana Davis) is {{captured}} by a street gang, Micah Sanders (Noah Gray-Cabey) {{turns to his}} mother Niki (Ali Larter) for help. Despite the fact that Niki no longer has her powers due to the virus, she agrees to help. They follow a GPS signal emitted by Monica's cell phone and find her in an abandoned warehouse. She is tied up and the warehouse is burning around her. Using what remains of her superhuman strength, Niki manages to help Monica escape, but her strength eventually fails and she ends up trapped <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> as it explodes.|$|E
5|$|After World of Motion {{had closed}} on January 2, 1996, {{everything}} inside the ride building was removed. After, new track was constructed {{outside of the}} building which is used as the high-speed test for Test Track. Work <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> also continued at the same time. It was scheduled to open 29 months after World of Motion's closing, in May 1997, but after numerous problems rose, the ride opening was delayed by nearly 2 years. Also, the cars used on the ride were designed to resemble {{the look of a}} test car that is used to go through multiple safety tests.|$|E
5|$|After {{the work}} {{stoppage}} at pit number six, more white miners assembled near the town. They marched to Rock Springs {{by way of}} the railroad, carrying firearms. At about 10:00a.m., the bell in the Knights of Labor meeting hall tolled, and the miners <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> joined the already large group. There were white miners who opted to go to saloons instead of joining the gathering mob, but by 2:00p.m., the saloons and grocers were persuaded by a Union Pacific official to close.|$|E

50|$|Gulfport High School {{currently}} has two SRDs that work on campus, {{as well as}} multiple camera systems <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>buildings.</b> <b>The</b> school also has multiple exits; however, once the new construction is complete, there will only be two entrances.|$|R
5|$|In 2013, the MTA filed {{to change}} the {{location}} of Entrance 1, moving it onto from the sidewalk, away from its original proposed location inside 301 East 69th Street. This was because designs for entrances <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> failed to both satisfy the building's residents as well as meet the MTA's engineering requirements. With the New York City Department of Transportation planning a bike lane along {{the east side of}} Second Avenue after construction is finished, the MTA could widen the sidewalk {{to make room for the}} entrances without ultimately disrupting traffic flow.|$|E
5|$|<b>Inside,</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> held {{a two-story}} balconied main {{sanctuary}} and dining room, {{in addition to}} the basement kitchen and bathrooms. The heating system was in a sub-basement. The front ark and wood bimah in the sanctuary were ornate; the red velvet draped ark was elaborately decorated, and the bimah was also decorated, and supported a large bronze candelabra. The sanctuary floor was wood, with wood wainscoting and plaster walls.|$|E
5|$|Like flour mills, {{factories}} that make aspirin tablets must {{pay attention to}} {{how much of the}} powder gets into the air <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>building,</b> because the powder-air mixture can be explosive. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended exposure limit in the United States of 5mg/m3 (time-weighted average). In 1989, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) set a legal permissible exposure limit for aspirin of 5mg/m3, but this was vacated by the AFL-CIO v. OSHA decision in 1993.|$|E

5|$|Soon {{after the}} attack, {{hundreds}} of policemen and army forces personnel and two {{armored personnel carriers}} were brought into Yerevan, positioned on Baghramyan Avenue surrounding the National Assembly building. An anti-terrorist squad from Russia also participated in the operation. Meanwhile, ambulance vehicles rushed {{to the site of}} the shooting. President Robert Kocharyan was directing the operation of the security forces around the parliament building. While holding around 50 hostages <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>building,</b> the men demanded a helicopter and airtime on national television for a political statement.|$|E
5|$|The FBI {{task force}} rush {{to locate the}} bomb, tracing the phonecall to a small {{section of the city}} that might house it. Scanning the area, Black notices another parking garage {{opposite}} an office block, and attempts to have the building evacuated. However, Dees has planted a second bomb which detonates fifteen minutes early, while Black is <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>building.</b> However, he is pulled to safety by a stranger, who is interviewed on the news following the explosion—Raymond Dees.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} housed around 440 people, mainly retired teachers. An early report {{showed that}} the ages of those injured in the fire range from 3 to 85, with the majority (64.5%) {{over the age of}} 50. Most of the injured appeared to be elderly residents or children, and it was confirmed that the youngest victim of the fire was 16 months old. A firefighter said that 57 of the 58 killed had died <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>building.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Inside,</b> <b>the</b> <b>buildings</b> have {{undergone}} many changes {{since they were}} first built, and have lost most of their architectural distinctiveness. The courthouse retains its original windows and high ceilings, {{and there are some}} original cells left in the jail wing.|$|R

5|$|Accounts vary, but historians {{estimate}} that by spring 1903, between 700 and 1,000 men {{arrived in the}} Tanana Valley. This put an enormous strain on Barnette's stock of food, which rapidly rose in price with demand. Miners objected to Barnette charging $12 per bag of flour and requiring them to buy cases of canned food. They gathered outside his store and demanded he lower his prices or they would burn it down. He responded that he had riflemen <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>building,</b> and both groups reached a compromise. Shortly afterward, Barnette headed south with his wife on a dog team, intending to gather investors to purchase more supplies.|$|E
5|$|An {{estimated}} 646people were <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> {{when the}} bomb exploded. By {{the end of}} the day, 14 adults and 6 children were confirmed dead, and over 100 injured. The toll eventually reached 168confirmed dead, not including an unmatched left leg that could have belonged to an unidentified 169th victim or could have belonged to any one of eight victims who had been buried without a left leg. Most of the deaths resulted from the collapse of the building, rather than the bomb blast itself. Those killed included 163 who were in the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, one person in the Athenian Building, one woman in a parking lot across the street, a man and woman in the Oklahoma Water Resources building, and a rescue worker struck on the head by debris.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{increasingly}} squalid conditions, {{the population}} inside continued to grow. The situation <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> {{was described as}} chaotic; reports of rampant drug use, fights, rape, and filthy living conditions were widespread. At the time, as many as 100 {{were reported to have}} died in the Superdome, with most deaths resulting from heat exhaustion, but other reported incidents included an accused rapist who was beaten to death by a crowd and an apparent suicide. Despite these reports, though, the final official death toll was significantly less: six people inside (4 of natural causes, one overdose, and an apparent suicide) and a few more in the general area outside the stadium.|$|E

5|$|On 23 March 1933, the Reichstag {{assembled}} at the Kroll Opera House under turbulent circumstances. Ranks of SA men {{served as}} guards <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>building,</b> while large groups outside opposing the proposed legislation shouted slogans and threats towards the arriving members of parliament. The {{position of the}} Centre Party, the third largest party in the Reichstag, was decisive. After Hitler verbally promised party leader Ludwig Kaas that Hindenburg would retain his power of veto, Kaas announced the Centre Party would support the Enabling Act. The Act passed {{by a vote of}} 441–84, with all parties except the Social Democrats voting in favour. The Enabling Act, along with the Reichstag Fire Decree, transformed Hitler's government into a de facto legal dictatorship.|$|E
5|$|The Air Force tracks {{a larger}} UFO as it hovers over Townsend. The {{invisible}} alien enters Max's trailer and abducts him. When the agents visit the trailer and find Max missing, an Army radio transmission reveals {{that he has}} been transported to a waterfront. They race to save Max as Henderson's men scour the area searching for him. The alien kills two soldiers who encounter Max, causing him to flee into a warehouse. As Mulder finds Max <b>inside,</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> is surrounded by Henderson's forces. Mulder tries to comfort Max, but is attacked and injured by the alien. Mulder then sees Max floating in a pillar of light before vanishing. When Henderson finds that Max is missing, he orders Mulder arrested.|$|E
5|$|The Man's {{aircraft}} crash lands at night. The following morning he continues on foot. The Brute {{returns to the}} hospital with a new box of items, though this time he constructs a device that will keep the door open long enough for him to enter the building. The plan works, however, once back <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> The Doctor pulls a lever which closes a secondary iron bar gate preventing The Brute from entering. The Man finds an abandoned bar, get himself heavily intoxicated and passes out. When he awakes, he ventures outside where he is amazed that it is raining fish. While searching for a way to cook the fish, The Man encounters The Brute. A fight ensues; the Brute gains the upper hand though The Man is able to escape.|$|E
