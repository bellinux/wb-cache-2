40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} the feasibility {{and accuracy of}} a model for tissue characterization with dual source computed tomography (DSCT). METHODS AND MATERIALS: A model for tissue characterization in CT was used with a parameterization of linear attenuation coefficients. Sixteen chemical substances with <b>effective</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>numbers</b> between 5. 21 and 13. 08 and electron densities between 2. 20 and 4. 12 x 10 (23) electrons/cm(3) were scanned at energies of 80 and 140 kV on a DSCT. From the reconstructed dual energy data sets, <b>effective</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>numbers</b> and electron densities of the substances were calculated. RESULTS: Our presented model using DSCT approximated the <b>effective</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>numbers</b> and <b>effective</b> electron densities of 16 substances very well. The measured <b>effective</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>numbers</b> deviated 3. 4 ± 6. 8 % (R(2) = 0. 994) from theoretical <b>effective</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>numbers.</b> In addition, measured effective electron densities deviated - 0. 6 ± 2. 2 % (R(2) = 0. 999) from theoretical effective electron densities. CONCLUSION: <b>Effective</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>numbers</b> and <b>effective</b> electron densities can be determined with a high accuracy with DSCT.

50|$|An {{alternative}} {{definition of}} the <b>effective</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>number</b> is one quite different from that described above. The atomic number of a material exhibits a strong and fundamental relationship {{with the nature of}} radiation interactions within that medium. There are numerous mathematical descriptions of different interaction processes that are dependent on the atomic number, Z. When dealing with composite media (i.e. a bulk material composed of more than one element), one therefore encounters the difficulty of defining Z. An <b>effective</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>number</b> in this context is equivalent to the atomic number but is used for compounds (e.g. water) and mixtures of different materials (such as tissue and bone). This is of most interest in terms of radiation interaction with composite materials. For bulk interaction properties, it can be useful to define an <b>effective</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>number</b> for a composite medium and, depending on the context, this may be done in different ways. Such methods include (i) a simple mass-weighted average, (ii) a power-law type method with some (very approximate) relationship to radiation interaction properties or (iii) methods involving calculation based on interaction cross sections. The latter is the most accurate approach (Taylor 2012), and the other more simplified approaches are often inaccurate even when used in a relative fashion for comparing materials.|$|E
50|$|The <b>effective</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>number</b> is {{important}} for predicting how photons interact with a substance, as certain types of photon interactions depend on the atomic number. The exact formula, {{as well as the}} exponent 2.94, can depend on the energy range being used. As such, readers are reminded that this approach is of very limited applicability and may be quite misleading.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: There are a {{range of}} genetic and nongenetic factors {{influencing}} the elemental composition of different human tissues. The elemental composition of cancerous tissues frequently differs from healthy tissue of the same organ, particularly in high-Z trace element concentrations. For this reason, one could suggest {{that this may be}} exploited in diagnostics and perhaps even influence dosimetry. Methods: In this work, for the first time, <b>effective</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>numbers</b> are computed for common cancerous and healthy tissues using a robust, energy-dependent approach between 10 keV and 100 MeV. These are then quantitatively compared within the context of diagnostics and dosimetry. Results: Differences between <b>effective</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>numbers</b> of healthy and diseased tissues are found to be typically less than 10. Fibrotic tissues and calcifications of the breast exhibit substantial (tens to hundreds of percent) differences to healthy tissue. Expectedly, differences are most pronounced in the photoelectric regime and consequently most relevant for kV imagingtherapy and radionuclides with prominent low-energy peaks. Cancerous tissue of the testes and stomach have lower <b>effective</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>numbers</b> than corresponding healthy tissues, while diseased tissues of the other organ sites typically have higher values...|$|R

This experiment was carried out on several elements in the atomic range for 59. 54 [*]keV incident photons. Photopeak efficiency and air and sample absorption corrections were performed on Rayleigh to Compton scattering intensity ratio; then the ratio was plotted {{as a function of}} <b>atomic</b> <b>number</b> and a fit curve was constituted. The <b>effective</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>numbers</b> of rare earth oxide samples were determined by this fit curve. Also, related parameters were determined by absorption technique with the same incident photon energy.

50|$|This 'power law' method, while {{commonly}} employed, is {{of questionable}} appropriateness in contemporary scientific applications {{within the context}} of radiation interactions in heterogeneous media. This approach dates back to the late 1930s when photon sources were restricted to low-energy x-ray units (Mayneord 1937). The exponent of 2.94 relates to an empirical formula for the photoelectric process which incorporates a ‘constant’ of 2.64 x 10−26, which is in fact not a constant but rather a function of the photon energy. A linear relationship between Z2.94 has been shown for a limited number of compounds for low-energy x-rays, but within the same publication it is shown that many compounds do not lie on the same trendline (Spiers et al. 1946). As such, for polyenergetic photon sources (in particular, for applications such as radiotherapy), the <b>effective</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>number</b> varies significantly with energy (Taylor et al. 2008). As shown by Taylor et al. (2008), it is possible to obtain a much more accurate single-valued Zeff by weighting against the spectrum of the source. The <b>effective</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>number</b> for electron interactions may be calculated with a similar approach; see for instance Taylor et al. 2009 and Taylor 2011. The cross-section based approach for determining Zeff is obviously much more complicated than the simple power-law approach described above, and this is why freely-available software has been developed for such calculations (Taylor et al. 2012).|$|E
5000|$|The {{binding energy}} of an {{electron}}, or the energy needed {{to remove the}} electron from the atom, {{is a function of}} the electrostatic interaction between the negatively charged electrons and the positively charged nucleus. In Iron, atomic number 26, for instance, the nucleus contains 26 protons. The electrons that are closest to the nucleus will 'see' nearly all of them. However, electrons further away are screened from the nucleus by other electrons in between, and feel less electrostatic interaction as a result. The 1s electron of Iron (the closest one to the nucleus) sees an <b>effective</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>number</b> (number of protons) of 25. The reason why it is not 26 is because some of the electrons in the atom end up repelling the others, giving a net lower electrostatic interaction with the nucleus. One way of envisioning this effect is to imagine the 1s electron sitting on one side of the 26 protons in the nucleus, with another electron sitting on the other side; each electron will feel less than the attractive force of 26 protons because the other electron contributes a repelling force. The 4s electrons in Iron, which are furthest from the nucleus, feel an <b>effective</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>number</b> of only 5.43 because of the 25 electrons in between it and the nucleus screening the charge.|$|E
5000|$|Effective atomic {{numbers are}} useful {{not only in}} {{understanding}} why electrons further from the nucleus {{are so much more}} weakly bound than those closer to the nucleus, but also because they can tell us when to use simplified methods of calculating other properties and interactions. For instance, lithium, atomic number 3, has two electrons in the 1s shell and one in the 2s shell. Because the two 1s electrons screen the protons to give an <b>effective</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>number</b> for the 2s electron close to 1, we can treat this 2s valence electron with a hydrogenic model.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>effective</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>number</b> Zeff, (sometimes {{referred}} to as the effective nuclear charge) of an atom is the number of protons that an electron in the element effectively 'sees' due to screening by inner-shell electrons.

These properties make it an excellent host for active ions such as Yb, Tm, Er, and Ho employed in diode pumped Solid-state lasers.The density of the Lutetium crystal is greater than that of other metals, such as Yttrium, meaning that the crystal properties do not change with the addition of dopant ions. It can be especially useful for high energy particle detection and quatification on account of its density and thermal stability. This high melting temperature, in addition to the lack of availability of Lutetium has made this crystal less commonly used than its fellow garnets, despite its favorable physical properties.|$|E
40|$|Radiotherapy and {{particle}} therapy treatment planning require accurate {{knowledge of}} the electron density and elemental composition of the tissues in the beam path to predict the local dose deposition. We describe a method {{for the analysis of}} dual energy computed tomography (DECT) images that provides the electron densities and <b>effective</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>numbers</b> of tissues. The CT measurement process is modelled by system weighting functions, which apply an energy dependent weighting to the parameterization of the total cross section for photon interactions with matter. This detailed parameterization is based on the theoretical analysis of Jackson and Hawkes and deviates, at most, 0. 3 % from the tabulated NIST values for the elements H to Zn. To account for beam hardening in the object as present in the CT image we implemented an iterative process employing a local weighting function, derived from the method proposed by Heismann and Balda. With this method <b>effective</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>numbers</b> between 1 and 30 can be determined. The method has been experimentally validated on a commercially available tissue characterization phantom with 16 inserts made of tissue substitutes and aluminium that has been scanned on a dual source CT system with tube potentials of 100 [*]kV and 140 [*]kV using a clinical scan protocol.
