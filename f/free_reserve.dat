40|$|Following the Treasury-Federal Reserve Accord of March 3, 1951, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) {{focused on}} <b>free</b> <b>reserves</b> - the {{difference}} between excess reserves (reserve deposits in excess of reserve requirements) and borrowed reserves - as the touchstone of U. S. monetary policy. However, managing <b>free</b> <b>reserves</b> was problematic because highly variable and not readily predictable autonomous factors, including float, Treasury balances at Federal Reserve Banks, and currency {{in the hands of}} the public, induced comparable volatility and unpredictability in reserve deposits and hence in <b>free</b> <b>reserves.</b> Managing <b>free</b> <b>reserves</b> effectively required policy instruments that could inject and drain large quantities of reserves quickly at low transaction costs. This paper surveys the two leading policy instruments for reserves management: 1) open market purchases and sales of Treasury bills, and 2) repurchase agreements. Outright transactions in bills were specifically authorized by statute and used in unexceptional ways for managing reserves over relatively long periods, but they had significant drawbacks for short-term "in and out" operations when additional reserves were needed for only a few days. Repos, however, while not specifically authorized by statute, were ideally suited for in-and-out operations. The acceptance of repurchase agreements as an instrument of monetary policy, even in the face of active resistance by some FOMC members, illustrates how utility can sometimes trump concerns about statutory authority, equity, and need...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{represents}} {{a model for}} the financial valuation of a firm which has control on the dividend payment stream and its risk, as well as potential profit by choosing different business activities among those available to it. Furthermore the company invests its <b>free</b> <b>reserve</b> in an asset, {{which may or may not}} contain an element of risk. The company chooses a dividend payment policy and we associate the value of the company with the expected present value of the net dividend distributions (under the optimal policy). One of the examples could be a large corporation such as an insurance company, whose liquid assets in the absence of control and investments fluctuate as a Brownian motion with a constant positive drift and a constant diffusion coefficient. We interpret the diffusion coefficient as risk exposure, while drift is understood as potential profit. At each moment of time, there is an option to reduce risk exposure, simultaneously reducing the potential profit, like using proportional reinsurance with another carrier for an insurance company. The company invests its reserve in a financial asset, whose price evolve as a geometric Brownian motion, with mean rate r> 0 and diffusion constant σ_P≥ 0. Thus σ_P= 0 corresponds to investments in a riskless bank account. The objective is to find a policy, consisting of risk control and dividend payment scheme, which maximizes the expected total discounted dividends paid out until the time of bankruptcy. We apply the theory of controlled diffusions to solve the problem. We show that if the discount rate c is less than r, the optimal return function is infinite. If r=c the return function is finite for all xDividend pay-out, proportional reinsurance, diffusion models, stochastic control theory, HJB equation, singular control...|$|E

Therefore, the investigation of liquidity effect will help which monetary policy tolls should be used in what ways in order to reach the macroeconomic targets of the country in question. This study aims to examine the effectiveness of the monetary program between 1990 : 1 - 2007 : 3 period that the Turkish Central Bank has implemented by measuring the liquidity effect in Turkey, by means of VAR methodology. The model enables us to examine the liquidity effect and not only helps to evaluate the effectiveness of the monetary policy but also examines the relationship between the monetary measures used in the implementation of monetary policies and the other macro variables.. Interest rates were examined in terms of a dynamic response to a shock in monetary policies, currency in circulation, <b>free</b> <b>reserves</b> and different monetary measures like M 1 and M 2. According to the results of the estimates, the reaction of the interest rates to a shock applied to <b>free</b> <b>reserves</b> and M 1 in an increasing trend was negative.

In order to enhance the QoS service in the dynamic changing wireless networks, this paper proposes two channel allocation schemes to improve the resource utilization of the base station, named FSC and FRC.

FRC, however, assigns the <b>free</b> <b>reserved</b> channel or the shared channel when the reserved channels are fully occupied. We use two-dimension Markov model to analysis the new call blocking probability and handover call dropping probability. Extensive numeric {{results show that the}} two schemes have strongly influence on the network resource utilization.
