The study aims were to introduce and assess the performance of clinically based response surface pathway (RSP) design for dose-finding studies, exemplified by one between-patient study, one within-patient study, and simulation studies. Methods: The between-patient study consisted of 15 women suffering from stage IV breast cancer, while the within-patient study consisted of seven female dogs with metastatic mammary cancer. The studies were conducted to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of a new anticancer agent named BP-C 1 using three-level RSP designs. Adjustment of the dose from one design level to the next {{was based on a}} k-adjustment factor estimated to ensure coverage of the entire predefined <b>dose</b> <b>window.</b> Patient sequences with an equal number of patients as design levels were included in the between-patient design, whereas the same patients were included in all the design levels in the within-patient design. Results: Four of the five patient sequences in the between-patient study and all seven dogs in the within-patient study reached the upper limit of the dose windows without any increase in toxicity. The MTD of BP-C 1 was thus found to be higher than the predefined cumulative <b>dose</b> <b>window</b> for both patient groups. In all three scenarios, the RSP design estimated MTDs better than the traditional 3 + 3 design; however, the toxicity rates were found to be higher when the target MTD was under the starting dose. Conclusion: The RSP designs do not need an assumed statistical model, and may be useful in estimating MTD, using a minimal sample size. The k-adjustment factor ensures complete <b>dose</b> <b>window</b> coverage and the design utilizes more information by allowing multinomial outcomes.

Its dose {{can be expressed}} in milligram or milligram equivalents (mg eq) of active paliperidone (39, 78, 117, 156, and 234 mg of PP correspond to 25, 50, 75, 100, and 150 mg eq of paliperidone). The recommended initiation dosing regimen for PP is 150 [day 1]/ 100 [day 8] mg eq. Labeling guidance allowed a ± 2 day window for the day 8 injection that provides more flexibility with patient scheduling and avoids missing the day 8 initiation dose. Recently, expansion of the day 8 <b>dosing</b> <b>window</b> from ± 2 to ± 4 days has been approved in the United States based on results obtained from the model-based simulations and review of safety data presented here. Methods: The predicted exposure for the recommended initiation regimen of PP was compared with day 1 /day 4, and day 1 /day 12 dosing scenarios; each scenario was compared with the highest clinically evaluated initiation regimen (150 [day 1]/ 150 [day 8] mg eq) and to the recommended 6 mg/day oral dose of extended-release paliperidone. Results: Simulated exposures with PP 150 mg eq on day 1 and 100 mg eq on days 4, 8, or 12 overlap considerably, with ± 3 ng/mL variation in median maximum plasma concentrations. Based upon pharmacokinetic bridging/bracketing, the peak concentration with PP 150 / 100 mg eq [days 1 / 4] was lower than that with the highest initiation regimen. Exposures for PP 150 mg eq on day 1 and 100 mg eq on days 4, 8, or 12 were maintained close to those of 6 mg of paliperidone extended-release. Conclusion: These simulations indicate that using the expanded <b>dosing</b> <b>window</b> of ± 4 days has little effect on paliperidone exposure.

40|$|Objective: This {{commentary}} summarizes recommended dosing {{strategies for}} a recently developed 3 monthly long-acting injectable 1 (LAI) formulation of paliperidone palmitate (PP 3 M) {{for the treatment}} of schizophrenia in adults. Methods: Recommendations for different dosing scenarios are based on the pharmacokinetic, efficacy and safety outcomes from phase 1 and phase 3 studies, population pharmacokinetic models, and model based simulations. Results: Switching to PP 3 M treatment is recommended only in patients previously treated with once monthly paliperidone palmitate LAI (PP 1 M) for at least 4 months. The first injection of PP 3 M (175 to 525 mg equivalent [eq. ]) should be given at the time of next scheduled injection of PP 1 M as a 3. 5 -fold multiple of the last PP 1 M dose (50 - 150 mg eq.), with a <b>dosing</b> <b>window</b> of 1 week. Following that first injection of PP 3 M, once-every-three-months maintenance injections with PP 3 M are recommended, with a <b>dosing</b> <b>window</b> of 2 weeks. The doses of PP 3 M can be administered in either deltoid (90 kg: 1. 5 inch 22 G needle; < 90 kg: 1. 0 inch 22 G needle) or gluteal muscles (1. 5 inch 22 G needle regardless of weight). In patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance: 50 - 80 mL/min), a 25 % dose reduction in PP 1 M and subsequent switching to a corresponding 3. 5 -dose multiple of PP 3 M (but not exceeding 350 mg eq.) is recommended. Appropriate dosing is recommended in elderly patients with diminished renal function not exceeding mild renal impairment. Similarly to PP 1 M, PP 3 M is not recommended in patients with moderate/severe renal impairment. Like PP 1 M, no dosage adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment or elderly patients with normal renal function. Conclusions: These data provide clinical guidelines for the optimum use of PP 3 M in patients with schizophrenia previously treated with PP 1 M for at least 4 months.

40|$|AbstractThe {{limitations}} of current basal insulin preparations include concerns {{related to their}} pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, hypoglycaemia, weight gain, and perception of management complexity, including rigid dosing schedules. Insulin degludec (IDeg) is a novel basal insulin with improved pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties compared to insulin glargine (IGlar) including a long half-life of ∼ 25 h and a duration of action > 42 h at steady state, providing a flat and stable blood glucose-lowering effect when injected once daily. Evidence from phase 3 a clinical trials with a treat-to-target design in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes has shown that IDeg has similar efficacy to IGlar, with a 9 % and 26 % reduction in risk of overall and nocturnal hypoglycaemia, respectively (in the pooled population) during the entire treatment period, and a 16 % and 32 % reduction during the maintenance period, respectively.

40|$|International {{audience}} The {{number of}} antibiotic-resistant bacteria is increasing worldwide, {{and the demand}} for novel antimicrobials is constantly growing. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) could be an important part of future treatment strategies of various bacterial infection diseases. However, AMPs have relatively low stability, because of proteolytic and chemical degradation. As a consequence, carrier systems protecting the AMPs are greatly needed, to achieve efficient treatments. In addition, the carrier system also must administrate the peptide in a controlled manner to match the therapeutic <b>dose</b> <b>window.</b> In this work, lyotropic liquid crystalline (LC) structures consisting of cubic glycerol monooleate/water and hexagonal glycerol monooleate/oleic acid/water have been examined as carriers for AMPs. These LC structures have the capability of solubilizing both hydrophilic and hydrophobic substances, as well as being biocompatible and biodegradable. Both bulk gels and discrete dispersed structures (i. e., cubosomes and hexosomes) have been studied. Three AMPs have been investigated with respect to phase stability of the LC structures and antimicrobial effect: AP 114, DPK- 060, and LL- 37. Characterization of the LC structures was performed using small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), dynamic light scattering, zeta-potential, and cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (Cryo-TEM) and peptide loading efficacy by ultra performance liquid chromatography. The antimicrobial effect of the LCNPs was investigated in vitro using minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and time-kill assay. The most hydrophobic peptide (AP 114) was shown to induce an increase in negative curvature of the cubic LC system. The most polar peptide (DPK- 060) induced a decrease in negative curvature while LL- 37 did not change the LC phase at all. The hexagonal LC phase was not affected by any of the AMPs. Moreover, cubosomes loaded with peptides AP 114 and DPK- 060 showed preserved antimicrobial activity, whereas particles loaded with peptide LL- 37 displayed a loss in its broad-spectrum bactericidal properties. AMP-loaded hexosomes showed a reduction in antimicrobial activity. </p...|$|E

The successful rat models were randomly divided into 16 groups according to the orthogonal layout of [L 16 (45) ] and treated by injecting picroside II intraperitoneally with different doses at various times. The neurological behavioral function was evaluated by Bederson’s test and the cerebral infarction volume was measured by tetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining.

Parasitemia was monitored throughout, and cures were detected by parasitological and PCR assays. The results were compared with those achieved with benznidazole treatment at the same doses. Fexinidazole metabolites were effective in reducing the numbers of circulating para-sites and protecting mice against death, compared with untreated mice, but without providing cures at daily doses of 10 and 25 mg/kg. Both metabolites were effective in curing mice at 50 mg/kg/day (30 % to 40 %) and 100 mg/kg/day (100 %). In the benz-nidazole-treated group, parasitological cure was detected only in animals treated with the higher dose of 100 mg/kg/day (80 %). Single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters for each metabolite were obtained from a parallel group of uninfected mice and were used to estimate the profiles following repeated doses.

Normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells were cultured at an air-liquid interface {{in order to produce}} an in vitro model of the respiratory epithelium for toxicological testing. Extensive biochemical and morphological characterisation during construct development revealed that the NHBE model formed a pseudo-stratified, fully-differentiated culture of muco-ciliary phenotype. Histochemical and immunohistochemical techniques allowed the identification of basal, Clara, goblet and ciliated cells. Developmental characterisation revealed a toxicological <b>dosing</b> <b>window</b> of 7 days, where the model was deemed to be fully-established. Fully-developed NHBE cultures were then exposed to classical pulmonary toxicants (CPT) Lipopolysaccharide, cadmium chloride, paraquat, Amiodarone and cigarette smoke.

40|$|Background This study {{describes}} {{the development of}} Response Surface Pathway (RSP) design, assesses its performance and effectiveness in estimating LD 50, and compares RSP with Up and Down Procedures (UDPs) and Random Walk (RW) design. Methods A basic 4 -level RSP design was used on 36 male ICR mice given intraperitoneal doses of Yessotoxin. Simulations were performed to optimise the design. A k-adjustment factor was introduced to ensure coverage of the <b>dose</b> <b>window</b> and calculate the dose steps. Instead of using equal numbers of mice on all levels, the number of mice was increased at each design level. Additionally, the binomial outcome variable was changed to multinomial. The performance of the RSP designs and a comparison of UDPs and RW were assessed by simulations. The optimised 4 -level RSP design was used on 24 female NMRI mice given Azaspiracid- 1 intraperitoneally. Results The in vivo experiment with basic 4 -level RSP design estimated the LD 50 of Yessotoxin to be 463 μg/kgBW (95 % CI: 383 – 535). By inclusion of the k-adjustment factor with equal or increasing numbers of mice on increasing dose levels, the estimate changed to 481 μg/kgBW (95 % CI: 362 – 566) and 447 μg/kgBW (95 % CI: 378 – 504 μg/kgBW), respectively. The optimised 4 -level RSP estimated the LD 50 to be 473 μg/kgBW (95 % CI: 442 – 517). A similar increase in power was demonstrated using the optimised RSP design on real Azaspiracid- 1 data. The simulations showed that {{the inclusion of the}} k-adjustment factor, reduction in sample size by increasing the number of mice on higher design levels and incorporation of a multinomial outcome gave estimates of the LD 50 that were as good as those with the basic RSP design. Furthermore, optimised RSP design performed on just three levels reduced the number of animals from 36 to 15 without loss of information, when compared with the 4 -level designs. Simulated comparison of the RSP design with UDPs and RW design demonstrated the superiority of RSP. Conclusion Optimised RSP design reduces the number of animals needed.

The {{aim of this}} paper was to introduce and demonstrate additional procedures to strengthen and generalize the design and combine RSP with classical study design. Materials and methods: Nine bull calves and six heifer calves were included in an unbalanced 2  ×  2 Latin Square (LSQ) designed study with large and small aperture bottle teats. The two LSQ sequences were performed with independent randomized three-level between-patient RSP design with an odd number of response classifications. The milk temperature window was 8 °C– 38 °C with a mid temperature of 23 °C. X-rays of the abdominal cavity were taken before, during, and immediately after intake of milk and recorded as “milk”, “trace”, or “no milk”. Based on the results of the first design level, the milk temperatures for five calves in the second design level were obtained by a randomization procedure. A similar procedure was performed for seven calves in the third design level. Adjustment of the dose from one design level to the next was based on a k-adjustment factor estimated to ensure coverage of the entire predefined <b>dose</b> <b>window.</b> Results: Starting with a low number of subjects and increasing this number with increasing design levels reduces the sample size without reducing the power. The suggested randomization procedure worked as expected. No milk in Rumen was recorded and minimum milk temperature (MMT) was estimated to be ≤ 8 °C for both teats. The odd number of response categories increases the flexibility of RSP, enabling category redefinition in hindsight from “trace” to “uncertain”. After category redefinition, MMT for large bottle teat was estimated to be 14. 3 °C (95 % confidence interval: 8. 3 – 20. 3 °C), but 8 °C for small. Conclusion: The suggested changes and additional procedures increase the strength and flexibility of the RSP design.

40|$|There are an {{estimated}} 14. 1 million cancer cases around the world every year, with this number expected to increase to 24 million by 2035. Breast cancer {{is the most common}} cancer in the UK, with 50, 000 new cases per year. Due to the limitations and side effects of most available anticancer therapy, there is an urgent need to develop new anticancer agents. There has been significant progress in utilizing nanotechnology in several areas of cancer care, including in vitro diagnostics, imaging, and therapy. The first generation of novel nanomaterials (NMS) as anticancer agents has successfully entered a widespread use. Recent studies demonstrate that zinc oxide (ZnO) NMS hold a considerable promise as potential anticancer agents. In addition to the novel size and shape properties, ZnO NMS exhibit a pH-sensitive dissolution. These properties of ZnO NMS could potentially allow increased cancer selectivity, changes in pharmacokinetics and amplification of cytotoxic effects. The selectivity of ZnO NMS can be further induced by attaching of cancer target reactive-ligands. 	The aim {{of this study is to}} test the hypothesis that zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs), grafted with RGD peptide, would target tumours that up- regulate integrin alpha v beta 3 (αvβ 3) receptors, and that targeting using this peptide would further enhance the antitumor efficacy of ZnO. Therefore, the toxicity and uptake of bare zinc oxide nanostructures and their RGD-targeted counterparts to a panel of malignant breast cancer cell lines was investigated. Two breast cancer cell lines of differing metastatic and invasive capacities were used: MDA-MB- 231 cell line that is oestrogen receptor-negative and highly invasive; and, MCF- 7 cell line that is oestrogen receptor-positive and non-metastatic. Healthy epithelial MCF- 10 - 2 A cell line was used as a control. To test the toxicity of the ZnO NPs (bare and RGD targeted), a combination of cell viability assays including; Alamar Blue, LDH, and ATP assays was used. Flow Cytometry was used to detect necrosis and apoptosis. The intracellular uptake of the ZnO NPs (bare and RGD targeted) was investigated and compared using different correlative microscopy techniques; Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and confocal microscopy. Furthermore, the protein corona formed around the particles was analysed using mass spectroscopy (MS). The bare and RGD targeted ZnO NPs exhibited dose and time dependent toxicity to the MCF- 7 and the MDA-MB- 231 cell lines in a concentration range of 10 - 100 µg/ml. Significant differences in the responses of the MCF- 7 and MDA-MB- 231 cells after exposure to the bare ZnO NPs were observed in the LDH assay and the Alamar Blue assays. Cell death had features of necrosis and apoptosis with mitochondrial structural changes. RGD-targeting of the ZnO NPs was efficient and successfully increased the toxicity of the ZnO NPs to breast cancer cells at lower doses, while preserving the viability of the healthy cells at the same dose and exposure time indicating that a potential therapeutic <b>dose</b> <b>window</b> exists. In the Alamar Blue viability assay, for example, the IC 50 values of the bare and targeted ZnO NPs after 24 h exposure to the MDA-MB- 231 cells were 30 and 22 μg/ml, respectively. In cell free experiments, the bare ZnO NPs dissolved very rapidly in simulated body fluid of lysosomal pH 5. 2, whereas they were more stable at pH 7. 4. Confocal and transmission electron microscopy confirmed uptake of both classes of ZnO NPs and a rise in intracellular Zn 2 + concentration prior to cell death after exposure to ZnO NPs. RGD-grafted ZnO NPs were more associated to MDA-MB- 231 cells possibly by binding to integrin αvβ 3 compared to the bare ZnO. The kinetics of intracellular dissolution of the RGD-targeted and bare ZnO NPs showed differences. The bare ZnO NPs, showed a clear time dependent increase in intracellular dissolution while the RGD-targeted ZnO NPs showed very low intracellular dissolution with time and then a sudden burst of ionic zinc. Preliminary studies were also performed on one dimensional ZnO nanowires and data are in broad agreement with the NP study, showing dose and time dependent toxicity in the MDA-MB- 231 cells. This research establishes a successful NP-based platform for cancer targeting and therapy. Open Acces...|$|E
40|$|The {{efficacy}} {{of three different}} doses of sodium salicylate (SAL) in combination with one dose of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) to prevent noise-induced hearing loss was studied in chinchillas. After obtaining baseline-hearing thresholds, the chinchillas {{were randomly assigned to}} one of four treatment groups: three sets were injected intraperitoneally with 325 mg/kg NAC combined with 25, 50, or 75 mg/kg SAL, and a separate control group was injected with an equal volume of saline. Animals were injected twice daily for 2 days prior to and 1 hour before the noise exposure (6 hours to a 105 -dB Standard Pressure Level octave band noise centered at 4 kHz). Immediate post-noise hearing thresholds were obtained followed by post-noise treatments at 1 hour then twice-daily for 2 days. Hearing tests continued at 1, 2, and 3 weeks post-noise, and immediately after the last hearing test, animals′ cochleae were stained for hair cell counts. All the groups showed hearing improvement until week 2. However, at week 3, saline treated animals demonstrated a 17 - 33 dB SPL permanent threshold shift (PTS) across the test frequencies. Hearing loss was lowest in the 50 SAL/ 325 NAC mg/kg group (all frequencies, P < 0. 001), and although PTS was reduced in the 25 and 75 mg/kg SAL dosage groups compared to the saline group, only the 75 mg/kg SAL group was significantly different at all but 2 kHz frequency. Coupled with the hearing loss, outer hair cell (OHC) loss was maximal in the 4 - 8 kHz cochlear region of saline treated animals. However, there was a substantial reduction in the mean OHC loss of the NAC plus 50 or 75 mg/kg (but not the 25 mg/kg) SAL groups. These findings suggest that SAL in combination with NAC is effective in reducing noise damage to the cochlea, but SAL has a relatively narrow therapeutic <b>dosing</b> <b>window...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{this study}} was to explore the optimal {{therapeutic}} <b>dose</b> and time <b>window</b> of picroside II for treating cerebral ischemic injury in rats according to the orthogonal test. The middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) models were established by intraluminally inserting a thread into middle cerebral artery (MCA) from left external carotid artery (ECA). The successful rat models were randomly divided into 16 groups according to the orthogonal layout of [L 16 (4 5) ] and treated by injecting picroside II intraperitoneally with different doses at various times. The neurological behavioral function was evaluated by Bederson’s test and the cerebral infarction volume was measured by tetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining. The expressions of neuron specific enolase (NSE) and neuroglial mark-protein S- 100 were determined by immunohistochemisty assay. The results indicated that the optimal compositions of the therapeutic <b>dose</b> and time <b>window</b> of picroside II in treating cerebral ischemic injury were ischemia 1. 5 h with 20 mg/kg body weight according to Bederson’s test, 1. 0 h with 20 mg/kg body weight according to cerebral infarction volume, 1. 5 h with 20 mg/kg body weight according to th...|$|R

This study aims to present RSP with two interventional and one result variables, combining between- and within-patient models and introduce a randomization procedure in a clinical situation. Methods: To estimate optimal efficacy dose and spreading duration of particulate CaO powder, material consisting of 18 net pens with salmon indicated for lice treatment was required. The study was performed as a randomized “between-patient” RSP designed trial with CaO dose as the interventional variable and percentage lice reduction as the outcome. Each net pen received three treatments with 24 -hour intervals of unchanged CaO dose and a starting spreading duration of 2  hours. The change in spreading duration followed a “within-patient” RSP procedure with percentage lice reduction as the outcome. In all participating fish farms, one net pen remained untreated and was used as control. Results: The minimum and the optimal efficacy doses were estimated to be 6. 1  g/kg and 8. 5  g/kg biomass (bm), respectively. In order to optimize lice reduction, the spreading duration increases with increasing CaO dose. The minimum efficacy combination was predicted to be 6. 1  g/kg bm administered in 2 : 00 (h:mm) and the optimal to be 8. 5  g/kg bm in 3 : 00. Three of the seven net pens allocated to 7. 4  g/kg bm erroneously received 8. 5  g/kg and due to weather circumstances three other net pens became untreated. Consequently, accuracy of the predictions was slightly reduced. Conclusion: The two-dimensional RSP design combining between- and within-patient RSP detected its power and predicted the two interventional variables to obtain minimum and optimal efficacy with sufficient accuracy.

40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} neuroprotective effect of picrosede II {{and explore the}} best {{therapeutic}} <b>dose</b> and time <b>window</b> according to orthogonal design in cerebral ischemic injury in rats. Methods: The forebrain ischemia rat models were established by bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAO) method. The successful models were randomly grouped according to orthogonal experimental design and treated by injecting picroside II intraperitoneally at different ischemic time with different doses. The contents of neuron-specific enolase (NSE), neuroglial marker protein S 100 B and myelin basic protein (MBP) in serum and brain tissue were determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to evaluate the therapeutic effect of picroside II in cerebral ischemic injury. Results: The best therapeutic time <b>window</b> and <b>dose</b> of picroside II in cerebral ischemic injury may be 1) ischemia 1. 5 h with 20 mg/kg and ischemia 1. 5 h with 10 mg/kg body weight according {{to the content of}} NSE in serum and brain tissue respectively, 2) ischemia 1. 5 h with 20 mg/kg according to the content of S 100 B in both serum and brain tissue, and 3) ischemia 1. 5 h with 20 mg/kg and ischemia 1. 5 h with 10 mg/kg according to the content of MBP in serum and brain tissue respectively.

40|$|The {{contribution}} of central pharmacodynamic mechanisms to {{the pathogenesis of}} motor fluctuations in advanced Parkinson's disease was studied in 29 patients by evaluating their acute response to intravenously injected levodopa. While the threshold dose for an antiparkinsonian effect did not change, that for induction of dyskinesia showed a progressive reduction in 4 groups: (1) levodopa-naive patients, (2) those with a stable response to oral administration, and (3) those with wearing-off or (4) on-off fluctuations. Concomitantly, the therapeutic window for levodopa narrowed and the levodopa dose-antiparkinsonian response slope increased. The antiparkinsonian threshold dose correlated best with duration of symptoms; the dyskinesia threshold <b>dose,</b> therapeutic <b>window,</b> and dose-response slope related most closely with the duration of levodopa treatment. The differing dose-response profiles for the antiparkinsonian and dyskinetic effects suggest involvement of separate pharmacological mechanisms. The present results, taken together with previous observations that the wearing-off phenomenon responds promptly to plasma levodopa stabilization while on-off fluctuations tend to diminish over several days, suggest that postsynaptic modifications, presumably at the receptor level, serve as the major determinant for the increasing difficulty with optimal dose adjustment and the motor fluctuations, especially of the on-off type, which complicate levodopa therapy of patients with advanced Parkinson's disease...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY. Experiments {{by others}} {{have shown that}} {{exogenous}} bradykinin dilates cerebral arterioles and that the brain contains kininogen and kallikrein, the latter being the enzyme which converts kininogen to bradykinin. The objective of these experiments {{was to determine if}} bradykinin produced from endogenous brain kininogen can affect the cerebral microcirculation. Rabbit pial arteriolar diameter was measured with a microscope using the <b>dosed</b> cranial <b>window</b> technique. Topical application of bradykinin (10 ~ 8 - 10 ~ 5 M) induced a dose-dependent vasodilation (8 — 46 %) which was completely inhibited by the cydooxygenase enzyme inhibitors indomethadn and medofenamic add. Topical application of 1 U of tissue kallikrein per milliliter of artificial cerebrospinal fluid induced 43 % dilation, which could be prevented by local treatment with indomethadn or the proteinase inhibitor aprotinin. The action of aprotinin and indomethadn was specific, since aprotinin did not affect the dilation produced by bradykinin, and indomethadn did not affect dilation produced by adenosine. A second application of kallikrein had no effect on cerebral diameter, yet the arterioles still responded normally to exogenous bradykinin, indicating that the first application of kallikrein depleted brain kininogen. We suggest that activation of brain kallikrein and subsequent formation of kinin from brain kininogen may be important in modulation of cerebral blood flow or generation of cerebral edema.

40|$|During aging, many {{neurodegenerative}} disorders {{are associated with}} reduced neurogenesis {{and a decline in}} the proliferation of stem/progenitor cells. The development of the stem cell (SC), the regenerative therapy field, gained tremendous expectations in the diseases that suffer from the lack of treatment options. Stem cell based therapy is a promising approach to promote neuroregeneration after brain injury and can be potentiated when combined with supportive pharmacological drug treatment, especially in the aged. However, the mechanism of action for a particular grafted cell type, the optimal delivery route, <b>doses,</b> or time <b>window</b> of administration after lesion is still under debate. Today, it is proved that these protections are most likely due to modulatory mechanisms rather than the expected cell replacement. Our group proved that important differences appear in the aged brain compared with young one, that is, the accelerated progression of ischemic area, or the delayed initiation of neurological recovery. In this light, these age-related aspects should be carefully evaluated in the clinical translation of neurorestorative therapies. This review is focused on the current perspectives and suitable sources of stem cells (SCs), mechanisms of action, and the most efficient delivery routes in neurorestoration therapies in the poststroke aged environment...|$|R
