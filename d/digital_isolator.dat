40|$|As digital {{power supply}} became a {{significant}} market opportunity, manufacturers {{started looking at}} ways to control the system cost by reducing components and their technical requirements. This thesis proposes a multiplexed digital feedback solution for isolated digital power supply systems. Several <b>digital</b> <b>isolators</b> used in existing applications {{can be reduced to}} one. The data transmission speed is greatly reduced. The communication protocol is DC-balanced; therefore pulse-transformer type <b>digital</b> <b>isolators</b> can be used resulting in further lower cost. The proposed solution also improves output accuracy over existing solutions. Presentation of the proposed system will be in three parts: architecture, protocol, and Piece-wise Linear Feedback method. Both theoretical analysis and practical implementation will be discussed, and the simulation results included support the theoretical analysis. A prototype board was built and its performance is promising...|$|R

These advanced package and pin compatible drop-in optocoupler replacements provide sustainability higher performance and reliability with none of the technical liabilities of optocouplers. <b>Digital</b> <b>isolators</b> can directly replace 6-pin and 8-pin optocouplers and are suitable for both optocoupler retrofit and new system designs. These devices use CMOS-based isolation architecture that are ten times more reliable than optocouplers, enabling manufacturers to support longer end product warranties and reduce costs associated with repairs or replacement.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Controller Area Network (CAN) bus {{has been}} popularly {{employed}} {{in most of}} vehicles {{and it will be}} heavily involved to the electric vehicle (EV) applications. A vehicle is a noisy system, with electromagnetic interference (EMI) over a wide range of frequencies. EMI generated by the inductive loads is the major cause of performance degradation of CAN bus communications. In order to enhance and protect the reliability and robustness of the CAN bus communication and to maintain safe operation of the battery stack, galvanic isolator is required for the data transmission. This study compares two different galvanic isolators, Optocoupler and <b>Digital</b> <b>Isolator,</b> and three different isolation schemes are evaluated by their protection capability for various EMI affected signals. The best isolation scheme has been recommended for EMI prevention of the CAN-bus-based BMS...|$|E

The main objective is the delay elimination between reading {{the current state of}} the inputs and outputs setting which occurs on the actual used commercial card. Further initial analysis outlines possible solutions at the beginning of the work. One of chapters describes USB communication interface, including its com- munications protocol and USB driver implementation on the operating system Microsoft Windows.

40|$|A {{pulsed laser}} mapping of <b>Digital</b> <b>Isolators</b> was done. They were {{previously}} characterized with heavy ions at RADEF. During the test {{there was not}} only an identification of the regions which are sensitive to single-event effects (SEE) but it also revealed additional failure modes (i. e. high-frequency ringing and latchup) not seen during heavy ion testing. So this device was considered latchup free up to an LET of 60 MeV cm 2 /mg. But those effects could also be induced by highly penetrating particles and hence {{must be taken into}} account for radiation hardness assurance (RHA). In addition it was possible to measure the sensitive area for the different types of SEE at different laser energies...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigated}} a gate driver using a GaN HEMT push-pull configuration for the high-frequency hard switching of a SiC power MOSFET. Low on-resistance and low input capacitance of GaN HEMTs {{are suitable for}} a high-frequency gate driver from the logic level, and robustness of SiC MOSFET with high avalanche capability is suitable for a valve transistor in power converters. Our proposed gate driver consists of digital isolators, complementary Si MOSFETs, and GaN HEMTs. The GaN HEMT push-pull stage has a high driving capability owing to its superior switching characteristics, and complementary Si MOSFETs can enhance the control signal from the <b>digital</b> <b>isolator.</b> We investigated limiting factors of the switching frequency of the proposed gate driver by focusing on each circuit component and proposed an improved driving configuration for the gate driver. As a result, 20 -MHz hard switching of a SiC MOSFET was achieved using the improved gate driver with GaN HEMTs...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, 3 D TSV {{transformers}} {{are designed}} and fabricated for monolithic high-voltage <b>digital</b> <b>isolator</b> applications. The transformers {{are embedded in}} the bottom layer of a silicon substrate by using through-silicon-via (TSV) technique without consuming chip surface area, and sandwiched between system circuitries using flip-chip bonding technique for reducing form factor. For a transformer with a size of 1. 4 mm x 1. 4 mm, a peak primary quality factor of 12. 7 and a voltage gain of 0. 82 at 34. 1 MHz are experimentally demonstrated. Moreover, the performance dependent on the various design parameters is also investigated, including coil sizes, number of winding turns, and coil shapes. Experimental results illustrate the design flexibility of the proposed transformer technology, which allows tradeoffs among key electrical properties such as peak quality factor, mutual inductance, voltage gain, and operating frequency. Asymmetric transformers with different number of turns for the primary and secondary coils are also demonstrated. They can achieve a voltage gain around unity, but sacrifice the bidirectional signal transfer capability. (C) 2014 The Electrochemical Society. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|A {{relatively}} {{new type of}} signal isolation based on Giant Magnetoresistive (GMR) technology was investigated for potential use in harsh temperature environments. Operational characteristics of the 2 Mbps single channel, IL 510 -Series commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) <b>digital</b> <b>isolator</b> chip was obtained under extreme temperature exposure and thermal cycling {{in the range of}} - 190 C to + 120 C. The isolator was evaluated in terms of its output signal delivery and stability, output rise (t(sub r)) and fall times (t(sub f)), and propagation delays at 50 % level between input and output during low to high (t(sub PLH)) and high to low (t(sub PHL)) transitions. The device performed very well throughout the entire test temperature range as no significant changes occurred either in its function or in its output signal timing characteristics. The limited thermal cycling, which comprised of 12 cycles between - 190 C and + 120 C, also had no influence on its performance. In addition, the device packaging underwent no structural damage due to the extreme temperature exposure. These preliminary results indicate that this semiconductor chip has the potential for use in a temperature range that extends beyond its specified regime. Additional and more comprehensive testing, however, is required to establish its operation and reliability and to determine its suitability for long-term use in space exploration missions...|$|E
