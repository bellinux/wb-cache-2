40|$|Simplified <b>hazard</b> <b>areas</b> (SHA) {{can help}} to master the wake vortex problem. Avoiding these zones allows safe and {{undisturbed}} flight operations. The definition of the <b>hazard</b> <b>areas</b> {{is based on the}} nominal required roll control power. The limit for this value must be chosen carefully to ensure that outside the <b>hazard</b> <b>area</b> all wake vortex effects are noncritical. In order to identify such a limit offline simulations, full flight simulator studies and in-flight simulations were conducted. The <b>hazard</b> <b>area</b> dimensions for a specific roll control limit are derived with the "Simplified <b>Hazard</b> <b>Area</b> Prediction" method (SHAPe). Parameterization of the input parameters makes this method universally applicable to different aircraft types. SHAPe represents a fundamental element of the wake vortex prediction and observation sys-tem within the interdisciplinary DLR project Wirbelschleppe II, for the generation of safe dynamic wake vortex separations...|$|R

40|$|Debris flow is a {{destructive}} disaster causing tragic loss and damages to vulnerable {{people and their}} properties in many regions around the world. According an impact of this disaster, <b>hazard</b> <b>areas</b> are submerged in mud and debris causing enormous difficulties to all relevant organisations and affected people to access over the hazard community. Although an inaccessibility {{is one of the}} major problems considered to be solved in an urgent stage, the lack of a comprehensive study in activities of involved people through time line since the disaster occurrence causes a difficulty to plan the feasible solution to overcome those problems effectively. Therefore, this paper presents the existing knowledge in several activities related to accessibilities in <b>hazard</b> <b>areas.</b> Additionally, the initial findings derived from interviews conducted as a part of a doctoral research are determined showing real activities related to accessibilities in a study area of Thailand where was attacked by a major debris-flow event in 2001.

5000|$|North Carolina {{is one of}} {{the more}} {{progressive}} states when it comes to addressing hurricane related land-use issues. This is probably because the state has received the second most direct hurricane strikes in the US. North Carolina pairs strong regional coastal management with intelligent hazard mitigation efforts to create an effective statewide emergency management program. It is important to initiate these actions during the recovery phase of a disaster in order to prevent repeat tragedies and wasted tax dollars. These mitigation efforts paired with restrictions on hard beach structures protect the natural ability of a coastal region to maintain itself, and protects future coastal developments. As a result of the federally mandated Coastal Zone Management Program, North Carolina passed CAMA, both of which produced a number of hurricane mitigation efforts in North Carolina. The Albemarle-Pamilico watershed is part of the National Estuary Program. CAMA requires a review and approval by an appropriate government body for areas designated as [...] "Areas of Environment Concern" [...] (AEC). These include estuarine <b>areas</b> and ocean <b>hazard</b> <b>areas.</b> Within the ocean <b>hazard</b> <b>areas</b> category of AECs are ocean erodible zones, high <b>hazard</b> flood <b>areas,</b> and inlet <b>hazard</b> <b>areas.</b> Each of these zones have general regulations that establish setbacks, erosion control projects, dune stabilization, and prevents all development in some areas.
