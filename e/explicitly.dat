5|$|About 3,000 runestones {{from the}} Viking Age have been {{discovered}} in Scandinavia of which c. 2,700 were raised within what today is Sweden. As many as 1,277 of them were raised {{in the province of}} Uppland alone. The Viking Age coincided with the Christianisation of Scandinavia, and in many districts c. 50% of the stone inscriptions have traces of Christianity. In Uppland, c. 70% of the inscriptions are <b>explicitly</b> Christian, which is shown by engraved crosses or added Christian prayers, while only a few runestones are <b>explicitly</b> pagan. The runestone tradition probably died out before 1100, and at the latest by 1125.|$|E
5|$|Although Newton {{states that}} the problem was to be solved by Proposition 6, he does not use it <b>explicitly.</b> In the following, {{simplified}} proof, Proposition 6 is used {{to show how the}} result is derived.|$|E
5|$|Another {{regulation}} of 1857 <b>explicitly</b> banned private ownership of artillery, while 1898 regulation lifted {{the ban on}} small pistols (shorter than 18 cm).|$|E
5|$|Both {{of these}} {{indexing}} strategies {{are consistent with}} the SQL:2003-defined behavior of Nulls. Because indexing methodologies are not <b>explicitly</b> defined by the SQL:2003 standard, indexing strategies for Nulls are left entirely to the vendors to design and implement.|$|E
5|$|China backed Musharraf in {{his stand}} against Lal Masjid. The Chinese Minister of Public Security, Zhou Yongkang, {{referred}} <b>explicitly</b> to the Lal Masjid militants as terrorists {{and demanded that}} Pakistan act more forcefully to protect Chinese nationals working in the country.|$|E
5|$|Demands that implicitly or <b>explicitly</b> {{threaten}} listeners with blame or punishment if {{they fail}} to comply.|$|E
5|$|Embedded systems: Although it <b>explicitly</b> {{focuses on}} the IA-32 and x86-64 platforms, FreeBSD also {{supports}} others such as ARM, PowerPC and MIPS to a lesser degree.|$|E
5|$|Escher's {{later work}} Four Regular Solids (Stereometric Figure) {{returned}} {{to the theme of}} polyhedral compounds, depicting a more <b>explicitly</b> Keplerian form in which the compound of the cube and octahedron is nested within the compound of the dodecahedron and icosahedron.|$|E
5|$|Four {{states in}} the U.S.—Minnesota, Utah, Oklahoma, and Iowa—require their shelters to provide animals to {{research}} facilities. Fourteen states <b>explicitly</b> prohibit the practice, while the remainder either allow it or have no relevant legislation.|$|E
5|$|Herodotus {{does not}} <b>explicitly</b> mention other ships. Since {{there were at}} {{probably}} 100 more ships at the Battle of Salamis than at Artemisium, Holland assumes that the remainder were patrolling the coast of Attica.|$|E
5|$|In practice, any {{cardinal}} who intends not {{to accept}} will <b>explicitly</b> state this before he receives {{a sufficient number of}} votes to become pope, as Giovanni Colombo did in October 1978.|$|E
5|$|Managed memory {{cannot be}} <b>explicitly</b> freed; instead, it is {{automatically}} garbage collected. Garbage collection addresses {{the problem of}} memory leaks by freeing the programmer of responsibility for releasing memory {{that is no longer}} needed.|$|E
5|$|Not <b>explicitly</b> {{influenced}} by Bembo but also {{influenced by}} Griffo is Minion by Slimbach. Released by Adobe, a 2008 survey ranked {{it as one of}} the most popular typefaces used in modern fine printing.|$|E
5|$|Opus Dei {{has been}} accused of {{deceptive}} and aggressive recruitment practices such as showering potential members with intense praise ("Love bombing"), and instructing numeraries to form friendships and attend social gatherings <b>explicitly</b> for recruiting purposes.|$|E
5|$|Post-Skilling, some {{courts have}} held that gratuities may be reached as kickbacks, while others {{have held that}} they may not. Prof. Coffee has argued that honest {{services}} fraud doctrine should <b>explicitly</b> distinguish {{between public and private}} corruption.|$|E
5|$|SQL defines two {{functions}} to <b>explicitly</b> handle Nulls: NULLIF and COALESCE. Both functions are abbreviations for searched CASE expressions.|$|E
5|$|The 14th Dalai Lama {{has also}} <b>explicitly</b> {{laid out his}} theory of mind as experiential dualism which is {{described}} above under {{the different types of}} dualism.|$|E
5|$|The Supreme Court of the United States has <b>explicitly</b> {{referenced}} Lord Coke's {{analysis of}} Magna Carta as an antecedent of the Sixth Amendment's {{right to a}} speedy trial.|$|E
5|$|The current Texas Constitution {{was adopted}} in 1876. Like many states, it <b>explicitly</b> {{provides}} for a separation of powers. The state's Bill of Rights is much larger than its federal counterpart, and has provisions unique to Texas.|$|E
5|$|The first suit, Montauk Tribe of Indians v. Long Island R.R. Co., {{brought by}} Wyandank Pharaoh {{in the name}} of the tribe, was {{dismissed}} because the tribe had not been <b>explicitly</b> authorized by the state to sue in its own name.|$|E
5|$|The rod-and-ring symbol, her {{necklace}} and her wig are all attributes that are <b>explicitly</b> {{referred to in}} the myth of Inanna's descent into the nether world.|$|E
5|$|Turrill thus <b>explicitly</b> {{excludes}} from alpha taxonomy {{various areas}} of study that he includes within taxonomy as a whole, such as ecology, physiology, genetics, and cytology. He further excludes phylogenetic reconstruction from alpha taxonomy (pp. 365–366).|$|E
5|$|UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon {{condemned}} {{the violence and}} reiterated calls for reform, while EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton said that the violence must stop and that Mubarak needed to <b>explicitly</b> describe proposed changes.|$|E
5|$|After protein {{amino acid}} {{sequences}} have been translated from nucleic acid chains, {{they can be}} edited by appropriate enzymes. Although this {{is a form of}} protein affecting protein sequence, not <b>explicitly</b> covered by the central dogma, there are not many clear examples where the associated concepts of the two fields {{have much to do with}} each other.|$|E
5|$|Although Kasuya did not <b>explicitly</b> {{define the}} mode of {{nutrition}} for A.coccinea, most Phallaceae species are suspected to be saprobic—decomposers of wood and plant organic matter. The fruit bodies of A.coccinea, known only from temperate regions of Japan (Tochigi Prefecture), grow solitarily or in groups on rice husks, straw, or dung. They are found from summer to autumn.|$|E
5|$|Although some eyewitnesses {{expressed}} {{the view that}} Joseph Locke, driving Rocket, was at fault, following a few words from the coroner the jury returned a verdict of accidental death. The directors and engineers of the L were <b>explicitly</b> absolved of all blame, and no deodand was to {{be attached to the}} locomotive or the railway.|$|E
5|$|At {{the second}} {{meeting of the}} day, {{following}} 'secret' negotiations, a compromise began to emerge after the Executive Committee moved <b>explicitly</b> to exclude consideration of extra-solar planets and to bring into the definition a criterion concerning the dominance of a body in its neighbourhood.|$|E
5|$|By 1966 the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod and the Wisconsin Synod forbade {{membership}} in the Loyal Order of Moose. The Catholic Church, however, has never <b>explicitly</b> objected to the Moose, despite having condemned similar organizations, such as the Freemasons for their oaths and other rituals.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{original}} formulation of the rules in England, the standard dimensions of a hockey pitch were originally expressed in imperial units. The rules are now expressed <b>explicitly</b> in metric dimensions (since 1998), although {{the use of the}} imperial terms remains common in some countries.|$|E
5|$|From the outset, {{the fate}} of the pier has been intimately linked with the central {{reclamation}} project which was unveiled in 1989 but not <b>explicitly</b> spelled out as such. However, the scale of reclamations has only been slightly cut back following significant legal battles.|$|E
5|$|In 1890 the English {{zoologist}} Edward Bagnall Poulton categorised animal colours {{by their}} uses, which cover both camouflage and mimicry. Poulton's categories were largely followed by Hugh Cott in 1940. Relevant Poulton categories {{are listed in}} the table. Where Poulton's definition covers a method but does not name it <b>explicitly,</b> the category is named in parentheses.|$|E
5|$|In 499 CE, the Indian {{astronomer}} Aryabhata propounded {{a planetary}} model that <b>explicitly</b> incorporated Earth's rotation about its axis, which he explains {{as the cause}} of what appears to be an apparent westward motion of the stars. He also believed that the orbits of planets are elliptical.|$|E
5|$|In {{his opening}} statement, Krum argued that Burton had only agreed {{to act as}} general counsel and to allow his name {{to be placed in}} Rialto's literature, and that the {{agreement}} <b>explicitly</b> provided that Burton would never represent Rialto before any federal agency.|$|E
5|$|Kitayama and Karasawa {{concluded}} that Japanese people do indeed have warm feelings towards themselves, just like Americans and Europeans, but that these feelings are masked when <b>explicitly</b> asked for. They {{speculated that the}} reason for this masking lies in the Japanese tendency to attend to negative, undesirable features by way of improving the self.|$|E
5|$|Mainstream {{parallel}} programming languages remain either <b>explicitly</b> parallel or (at best) partially implicit, {{in which a}} programmer gives the compiler directives for parallelization. A few fully implicit {{parallel programming}} languages exist—SISAL, Parallel Haskell, SequenceL, System C (for FPGAs), Mitrion-C, VHDL, and Verilog.|$|E
