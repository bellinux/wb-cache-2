5|$|By 2002, Caltrans had two {{proposals}} {{for the part}} of the widening project between East Vista Way and Mission Road: building the new highway on top of the old one, or constructing a new roadway to the south of the San Luis Rey River.

The San Diego Association of Governments included the widening east to Bonsall <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>regional</b> plan in 2003, but indicated that the portion from Bonsall to I-15 would be dependent on the availability of funding. Residents of Fallbrook and Bonsall criticized the fact that SR76 {{was one of the few}} TransNet projects that was not to be completed by the expiration of the tax in 2008.

5|$|In February 2016, the {{conservative}} majority <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Regional</b> Council of Réunion with president Didier Robert {{announced plans to}} transform the national park into a regional nature park. Too restrictive rules, which hindered tourism development, was cited as a motive. A regional nature park, unlike a national park, functions {{on the basis of}} mutual agreements and has no power to establish its own regulations. Park officials and opposition politicians rejected the plan, saying it would threaten the island's biodiversity, the World Heritage listing, and critical access to state funding. It would be the first case of a national park in France being downgraded. In September 2016, the national park's director, Marylène Hoarau, announced her withdrawal upon pressure from Ségolène Royal, head of the Ministry of Ecology, Sustainable Development and Energy. This led the park's president, Daniel Gonthier, to suspect political interference; Hoarau had criticised Robert for launching a call for proposals {{on the future of the}} park. In an interview,Robert denied involvement in Hoarau's departure and criticised the minister for her decision.|$|E
