40|$|The Neoproterozoic (1000 – 542 Myr ago) {{witnessed}} {{the dawn of}} Earth {{as we know it}} with modern-style plate tectonics, high levels of O 2 in atmosphere and oceans and a thriving fauna. Yet, the processes leading to the fully oxygenation of the external envelopes, its exact timing and its link with {{the inner workings of the}} planet remain poorly understood. In some ways, it is a chicken and egg question: did the Neoproterozoic Oxygenation Event (NOE) cause life blooming, low-latitudes glaciations and perturbations in geochemical cycles or is it a consequence of these phenomena? Here, we suggest that the NOE may have been triggered by multi-million years oxic volcanic emissions along a protracted period at the end of the Neoproterozoic when continents were assembled in the Rodinia supercontinent. We report a very oxidized magma source at the upper mantle beneath a ring of subducting margins around Rodinia, and detail here the evidence at the margin of the Arabian shield. We investigate the 780 Ma Biotite and Pink granites and associated rocks of the Socotra Island with rock magnetic and petrographic methods. Magnetic susceptibility and isothermal remanent magnetization acquisitions show that, in these granites, both magnetite and hematite are present. Hematite subdivides magnetite grains into small grains. Magnetite and hematite are found to be primary, and formed at the early magmatic evolution of the granite at very high oxygen fugacity. Massive degassing of these oxidized magmas would reduce the sink for oxygen, and consequently contribute to its rise in the atmosphere with a net O 2 flux of at least 2. 25 x 107 Tmol. Our conceptual model provides a deep <b>Earth</b> <b>link</b> to the NOE and implies the oxygenation burst has occurred earlier than previously envisaged, paving the way for later changes in the outer envelopes of the planet epitomized on the extreme Neoproterozoic glaciations and the appearance of the first animals...|$|E
40|$|International audienceGPS signal {{processing}} in geostationary environment {{is more difficult}} than for a classical receiver on Earth in normal conditions. There are numerous differences between the GPS signals that an Earth user receives and the signals that a geostationary satellite receives. The specific and main characteristics of the GPS signal received by a geostationary satellite are the following: high C/No values only for ray tangential to the earth, very important Doppler values (+/- 15 kHz), and poor Dilution Of Precision factor (usually higher than 5). A GPS/Galileo receiver onboard a geostationary satellite {{has to deal with}} these specific constraints. Several acquisition strategies can be envisaged so as to produce a point position. To reduce the delay and Doppler uncertainty and to get the navigation data, we could for example choose a strategy where some of the data (such as ephemeris or almanacs) are downloaded from Earth, but this increases the complexity and the cost of the receiver and of its integration in the satellite. Our aim in this paper is to use acquisition techniques which work in a global autonomous acquisition strategy. So the receiver does not use aiding data". In this case, the chosen acquisition technique must be really effective at least down to the demodulation threshold, and that threshold needs to be lowered to its minimum. The aim {{of this paper is to}} present 3 different unaided acquisition schemes and to compare their performances to process the GPS/Galileo signals in the particular context of a geostationary orbit. The first method consists in a classical FFT acquisition. This technique will be used as a reference to evaluate the performances of the other techniques. The second scheme called Half Bit Method (developed by M. Psiaki) is a method which allows long coherent integration time without knowing the data bit transition time. It avoids losses due to a bit transition occurring within the coherent integration time. The last acquisition technique studied is known as "double block zero padding" method. The main interest of this method is its rapidity and also, its low computational cost. The paper presents the test acquisition results over one standard day for a given geostationary orbit position. The work presented shows the statistics of successful acquisition as well as misdetection over one day for the three acquisition techniques. The length of signal required to achieve a minimum successful detection rate is also investigated. Due to the weakness of the considered signals and the power difference between the different received signals inducing cross-correlation, it is often necessary to process more than 1 second sometimes around 2 or 3 seconds. In this paper, we focus on an autonomous acquisition strategy, so we consider the receiver does not use "aiding data" downloaded from an <b>earth</b> <b>link.</b> Then, so as to perform a precise positioning, we need to demodulate the navigation message to extract the previous data. This is also necessary in order to reduce the Doppler uncertainty and so, to reduce the processing time. Thus, the paper considers several data demodulation thresholds (from 24 dBHz to the usual 27 dBHz value) and assesses the impact on the data demodulation and the consequence of a possible bit error on the final calculated position. Finally, we can compare the 3 acquisition methods in regards with their efficiency towards the different values when they are processed onboard a GEO satellite...|$|E
