Research in this area has become quite active in recent years, attributable in part, at least, to the entry of physicists and their sophisticated experimental techniques into the field.

From a unified perspective that embraces physical chemistry, fluid mechanics, and applied mathematics, the authors study recent developments related to the Marangoni effect, including patterned convection and instabilities, oscillatory/wavy phenomena, and turbulent phenomena. They examine Bénard layers subjected to transverse and longitudinal thermal gradients and phenomena involving surface tension gradients as the driving forces, including falling films, drops, and liquid bridges.

Ultra morphological characterization shows that observing and understanding the <b>interfacial</b> <b>phenomenon</b> and its quality would be of great importance {{in the selection of}} a dental adhesive for its use in pediatric restorative dentistry.

Teeth were then equally distributed into 2 subgroups each namely B 1 - Prime and Bond NT & B 2 - Xeno III. Results : The resin tags seen in the samples of group B 2 were both qualitatively and quantitatively advanced as compared to group B 1. This reveals that the quality of the penetration of the resin was better in group B 2.

40|$|Abstract. The present work {{attempts}} {{to investigate the}} <b>interfacial</b> <b>phenomenon</b> occurring between two dissimilar materials and in particular organic and inorganic hybrid materials. Layer by layer hybrid heterostructures are fabricated by electro-deposition technique. Here, ZnO thin films are deposited using potentiostatic mode using regulated DC voltage supply fixed at- 1. 0 V (with respect to the reference electrode) with platinum sheet (99. 99 % purity) used as the counter electrode and ITO-coated glass used as a working electrode. The as obtained ZnO films are then used as substrates for deposition of organic layer. Two conducting polymers namely polyaniline (PANI) and polypyrrole (PPy) are deposited by electro-deposition method on ZnO to form ZnO/PANI and ZnO/PPy interfaces. The two interfaces are compared for their photoconducting response. These studies are further correlated with the properties that the two interfaces share. Zinc oxide (ZnO) is a promising candidate for several device applications due to its highly stable structure at room temperature.
