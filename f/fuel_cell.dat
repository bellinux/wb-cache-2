40|$|Abstract — Static {{characteristics}} of <b>fuel</b> <b>cells</b> show {{more than a}} 30 % difference in the output voltage between no-load to full-load conditions. This inevitable decrease, which is caused by internal losses, reduces the utilization factor of the <b>fuel</b> <b>cells</b> at low loads. Additionally, the converters fed by these <b>fuel</b> <b>cells</b> have to be derated to accommodate higher input voltages at low currents. To increase the utilization of <b>fuel</b> <b>cells</b> and to avoid derating of semiconductors, this paper proposes a level reduction control using a multilevel inverter. Level reduction is done by inhibiting {{a certain number of}} <b>fuel</b> <b>cells</b> when the load current decreases.
