40|$|The {{presence}} of {{significant amounts of}} hydrogen sulphide is a critical issue in fuel cell power systems fed with biogas from anaerobic digestion. The concentration of this contaminant in the digester output biogas varies over the time, {{but it should be}} kept below the ppm level at the <b>fuel</b> cell <b>system</b> <b>inlet,</b> to minimize the reformer catalyst poisoning and cell component degradation. This work was aimed to analyse, into a real case, the entire anaerobic digestion process, highlighting the parameters that govern the hydrogen sulphide production, and to study the behaviour of a biotrickling filter for fine desulphurisation of real biogas to be fed into a laboratory scale HT-PEM (High Temperature Proton Exchange Membrane) fuel cell system. The amount of hydrogen sulphide in biogas resulted to be an important instantaneous indicator of the proper digestion process. The biotrickling filter showed high hydrogen sulphide removal efficiencies and proved to be a quite robust system, satisfactorily performing also in off-design conditions...|$|R

25|$|The inverse is {{also true}} when the {{aircraft}} is in inverted flight. The float becomes submerged as the fuel is pulled downward by gravity {{to the top of}} the fuel bowl.

With the float at the bottom of the fuel bowl, the <b>fuel</b> <b>inlet</b> valve opens, as it would when there is not enough fuel in the fuel bowl. With the <b>fuel</b> <b>inlet</b> valve open, the fuel pump continues pumping fuel into the fuel bowl, where the resulting excess fuel causes the fuel-air ratio to become lower than nine to one, which is then too rich for combustion to take place, stopping the engine.|$|R
40|$|Study of {{two-dimensional}} and axisymmetric supersonic mixed-compression <b>inlet</b> <b>systems</b> {{has shown}} that the geometry of both systems can be varied to provide adequate transonic airflow to satisfy the airflow demand of most jet engines. Collapsing geometry systems for both types of <b>inlet</b> <b>systems</b> provide a generous amount of transonic airflow for any design Mach number <b>inlet</b> <b>system.</b> However, the mechanical practicality of collapsing centerbodies for axisymmetric <b>inlet</b> <b>systems</b> is doubtful. Therefore, translating centerbody axisymmetric inlets with auxiliary airflow systems to augment the transonic airflow capability are an attractive alternative. Estimates show that the capture mass-flow ratio at Mach number 1. 0 can be increased approximately 0. 20 for a very short axisymmetric <b>inlet</b> <b>system</b> designed for Mach number 2. 37.

30|$|The air <b>inlet</b> <b>system</b> of {{traditional}} engines mainly relies on absorption by the quarter-wavelength straight-tube to suppress high-frequency noise, but two major problems exist. First, the quarter-wavelength straight-tube has a narrow denoising band and cannot cover the low-frequency noise band completely, {{which results in}} incomplete noise reduction. Second, due to the greatly restricted radial size of the air inlet tube in the engine’s <b>inlet</b> <b>system,</b> the longer length of the traditional quarter-wavelength straight-tube {{will be difficult to}} arrange in a compact car air <b>inlet</b> <b>system.</b> Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new type of muffler design, which has the advantages of both the quarter-wavelength straight-tube and Helmholtz muffler, with a wider noise elimination frequency band and smaller radial size. When used in a practical automobile test, the muffler showed excellent performance in high frequency noise reduction of the air <b>inlet</b> <b>system,</b> and this performance was supported by the experimental data.|$|R

An existing farm biogas production site (35 m 3 per day), currently equipped with a SOFC demonstration stack, is taken for reference. A process flow diagram was defined in a software package allowing to vary system operating parameters like the <b>fuel</b> <b>inlet</b> composition, reforming technology, stack temperature and stack current (or fuel conversion). For system reforming simplicity, a base case parameter set {{was defined as the}} <b>fuel</b> <b>inlet</b> of 60 % CH 4 : 40 % CO 2 mixed with air in a 1 : 1 ratio, together with 800 8 C operating temperature and 80 % fuel conversion.

40|$|The {{changes in}} the anode and cathode {{potentials}} of a phosphoric acid fuel cell under various conditions were studied using a single cell equipped with four reversible hydrogen electrodes located near the inlets and outlets. When pure hydro-gen gas {{was used as a}} fuel, the polarizations under load were homogeneous in the plane of the cell. However, when the re-formate gas was used, inhomogeneity in the plane arose under load. The cathode and anode potentials hifted in the posi-tive direction at the fuel outlet area. The potential shifts increased with an increase of fuel utilization or due to CO poisoning. The voltage loss due to CO poisoning (CO loss) caused an increase not only of the anode polarization but also of the cathode polarization in the <b>fuel</b> <b>inlet</b> area. The increase of cathode polarization at the <b>fuel</b> <b>inlet</b> area was due to current convergence into the <b>fuel</b> <b>inlet</b> area. The potential shifts at the fuel outlet can be attributed to he acidity change of electro-lyte there. The local acidity change of electrolyte can arise from a local starvation of hydrogen and hence of protons. Half-cell investigations have been conducted to evaluate overpotentials of the electrodes in a phosphoric acid fuel cell (PAFC). For example, Appleby et al. (1 - 3) and Kunz et al.

40|$|Barrier coasts {{and their}} {{associated}} tidal <b>inlet</b> <b>systems</b> {{are a common}} feature {{in many parts of}} the world. They constitute dynamic environments that are in a continuous stage of adapting to the prevailing tide and wave conditions. Commonly, these coastal areas are densely populated and (partly) as a result there often exists a strong conflict of interests between issues related to coastal safety, economic activities and ecology. To manage these different interests, it is important to gain more understanding of the long-term morphological evolution of tidal <b>inlet</b> <b>systems</b> and their adaptation to natural changes and human intervention. In this thesis the focus is on double <b>inlet</b> <b>systems,</b> where two tidal inlets connect a back-barrier basin to an ocean or a coastal sea. To investigate the morphological evolution of double <b>inlet</b> <b>systems</b> and their adaptation to internal or external change, the equilibrium configuration and stability properties of the cross-sectional areas of the two tidal inlets are studied in detail. To that extent, a widely used empirical relationship for cross-sectional inlet stability is combined with (i) a lumped-parameter (L-P) model (Chapters 2 and 3) and (ii) a two-dimensional, depth-averaged hydrodynamic (2 DH) model for the water motion (Chapter 4). The Marsdiep-Vlie <b>inlet</b> <b>system</b> in the western Dutch Wadden Sea and the Faro-Armona <b>inlet</b> <b>system</b> in the Portuguese Ria Formosa serve as case studies throughout this thesis. With the assumptions of a cross-sectionally averaged, uniform inlet flow velocity and a uniformly fluctuating basin surface elevation, model results of the L-P model show that stable equilibrium configurations where both inlets are open exist. It is necessary, however, to account for the important processes either explicitly, e. g. including a topographic high in the back-barrier basin as observed in the Wadden Sea (Chapter 2), or parametrically, e. g. allowing for inlet entrance/exit losses for relatively short inlets such as in the Ria Formosa (Chapter 3). By solving the depth-averaged, linear shallow water equations on the f-plane with linearised bottom friction, the 2 DH model explicitly accounts for spatial variations in surface elevation in the ocean, inlets and basin. Model results show that these spatial variations, induced by e. g. basin bottom friction, radiation damping, and Coriolis effects, are crucial to simulate and explain the long-term evolution of double <b>inlet</b> <b>systems.</b> This approach further allows the identification of a stabilising and destabilising mechanism associated with the persistence or closure of one (or both) of the inlets in a double <b>inlet</b> <b>system</b> and hence with its long-term evolution.

A single cylinder direct injection diesel engine developing a power output of 2. 8  kW at 1500  rev/min is tested using preheated animal fat as fuel. Experiments are conducted at the <b>fuel</b> <b>inlet</b> temperatures of 30, 40, 50, 60 and 70  °C. Animal fat at low temperature results in higher ignition delay and combustion duration than diesel. Preheated animal fat shows reduced ignition delay and combustion duration. Peak pressure and rate of pressure rise are found as high with animal fat at high <b>fuel</b> <b>inlet</b> temperatures. Heat release pattern shows reduced premixed combustion phase with animal fat as compared to neat diesel at normal temperature. Preheating improves the premixed combustion rate. At low temperature, animal fat results in lower smoke emissions than diesel. The maximum smoke density is K= 6. 5  m− 1 with diesel and K= 3. 6  m− 1 with animal fat at 30  °C. Preheated animal fat further reduces smoke levels at all temperatures. The smoke level is reduced up to K= 1. 7  m− 1 with preheated animal fat at the temperature of 70  °C. Hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions are higher with animal fat at low temperature as compared to diesel. Fuel Preheating reduces these emissions. emission is found as low with animal fat at low temperature. Fuel preheating results in increased emission.

The total sediment flux cannot be balanced by the input from the open sea, the aerosol and biological production; rather, the material from land (which has been intensified by agricultural activities over the past several decades) represents a major component for the balance.
