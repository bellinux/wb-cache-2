5|$|Samarium {{carbides}} {{are prepared}} by melting a graphite-metal mixture in an inert atmosphere. After the synthesis, they are unstable in air and are studied also under inert atmosphere. Samarium monophosphide SmP is a semiconductor with the bandgap of 1.10eV, {{the same as}} in silicon, and high electrical conductivity of n-type. It can be prepared by annealing at 1100°C an evacuated quartz ampoule containing mixed powders of phosphorus and samarium. Phosphorus is highly volatile at high temperatures and may explode, thus the <b>heating</b> <b>rate</b> has to be kept well below 1°C/min. Similar procedure is adopted for the monarsenide SmAs, but the synthesis temperature is higher at 1800°C.|$|E
5|$|Males {{must first}} wait to sense a female’s pheromones {{before they can}} locate her. Before males engage in flight to find a female, they warm-up by {{shivering}} the major flight muscles to reach thoracic temperature optimal to sustain flight, around 26 degrees Celsius. The thermoregulatory shivering activities of males were measured as they were exposed to different sex-related olfactory cues. Males are found to heat up more quickly {{in the presence of}} a female pheromone and take-off at a lower thoracic temperature than males who are exposed to other chemical scents. Since heating up to the right temperature leads to better flight performance than flying immediately, there is a trade-off between sub-optimal flight performance and rapid onset of directed flight. Helicoverpa zea males exposed to an attractive pheromone blend thus spend less time shivering and increase their <b>heating</b> <b>rate.</b> Thermoregulatory behavior of unrestrained moths is associated with competition for access to females, showing the ecological trade-off.|$|E
5|$|Nanostructures of ZnO can be {{synthesized}} into {{a variety}} of morphologies including nanowires, nanorods, tetrapods, nanobelts, nanoflowers, nanoparticles etc. Nanostructures can be obtained with most above-mentioned techniques, at certain conditions, and also with the vapor-liquid-solid method. The synthesis is typically carried out at temperatures of about 90°C, in an equimolar aqueous solution of zinc nitrate and hexamine, the latter providing the basic environment. Certain additives, such as polyethylene glycol or polyethylenimine, can improve the aspect ratio of the ZnO nanowires. Doping of the ZnO nanowires has been achieved by adding other metal nitrates to the growth solution. The morphology of the resulting nanostructures can be tuned by changing the parameters relating to the precursor composition (such as the zinc concentration and pH) or to the thermal treatment (such as the temperature and <b>heating</b> <b>rate).</b>|$|E

25|$|The idea {{of using}} steady {{alternating}} current (AC) to create the pinch had a serious limitation. AC power drops to zero voltage twice per cycle, and during this time it would not induce a current in the plasma, briefly ending confinement. Direct current (DC) power avoids this issue. Another key point was that the current in the plasma also heated it. In the original designs, a weak pinch current was used for confinement while the external heaters slowly heated the plasma. But if the current was also used as the heat source there was no practical limit to the <b>heating</b> <b>rate,</b> which was limited only {{by the power of}} the pulse. Combining the two concepts, a new reactor design emerged where the system operated in brief but powerful pulses. Such a machine would demand a very large power supply.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "hot start" [...] {{model of}} heating {{suggests}} Enceladus began as ice and rock that contained rapidly decaying short-lived radioactive isotopes of aluminium, iron and manganese. Enormous amounts of heat were then produced as these isotopes decayed for about 7 million years, {{resulting in the}} consolidation of rocky material at the core surrounded by a shell of ice. Although the heat from radioactivity would decrease over time, the combination of radioactivity and tidal forces from Saturn's gravitational tug could prevent the subsurface ocean from freezing. The present-day radiogenic <b>heating</b> <b>rate</b> is 3.2 ergs/s (or 0.32 gigawatts), assuming Enceladus has a composition of ice, iron and silicate materials. Heating from long-lived radioactive isotopes uranium-238, uranium-235, thorium-232 and potassium-40 inside Enceladus would add 0.3 gigawatts to the observed heat flux. The presence of Enceladus's regionally thick subsurface ocean suggests a heat flux ~10 times higher than that from radiogenic heating in the silicate core.|$|E

The method uses airborne in situ observations of BC particles, ozone and actinic flux. Total BC mass is obtained along the flight track by summing the masses of individually detected BC particles in the range 90 to 600 -nm volume-equivalent diameter, which includes most of the BC mass. Ozone mixing ratios and upwelling and partial downwelling solar actinic fluxes were measured concurrently with BC mass. Two estimates used for the BC wavelength-dependent absorption cross section yielded similar <b>heating</b> <b>rates.</b> For mean altitudes of 16. 5, 17. 5, and 18. 5 km (0. 5 km) in the tropics, average BC <b>heating</b> <b>rates</b> were near 0. 0002 K/d.

40|$|M. Tech. (Mechanical Engineering) Eskom {{fossil fuel}} power {{stations}} operate {{under various conditions}} and the ageing fleet of fossil fuel power stations are under strain due to the rising demand in electricity. The quest for cheaper electricity in growing businesses and bringing foreign investment into South Africa is significant for economic growth. Therefore, minimizing operation costs and improving availability, reliability and thermal <b>heat</b> <b>rate</b> are key objectives for {{the operation of the}} business. Thermal <b>heat</b> <b>rate</b> calculation is a method used to assess the performance of fossil fuel power stations. It provides an indication of the thermal performance which reflects the condition and operation of the plant. This dissertation refers to the tools used to measure the condenser performance and to identify the reason for unhealthy condenser performance and an increase in thermal <b>heat</b> <b>rate.</b> Problem: Poor condenser performance causes significant losses in generation and thermal <b>heat</b> <b>rate</b> in fossil fuel plants. Loss in generation and thermal <b>heat</b> <b>rate</b> is caused by condenser backpressure. This has an adverse effect on turbine thermal <b>heat</b> <b>rate</b> and henceturbine efficiency. The performance of the condenser affects the turbine performance to a large extent. Decreased condenser performance will increase the turbine thermal <b>heat</b> <b>rate,</b> i. e. kJ/kWh, because of the increased steam consumption per kWh of energy generated and therefore lowering the overall turbine efficiency. This will result in poor thermal <b>heat</b> <b>rate</b> efficiency resulting in an increased coal burn rate, i. e. kg/kWh, and an increased fuel bill and carbon foot print for the fossil fuel power station. The aim of this dissertation is {{to determine the effects of}} condenser performance on thermal <b>heat</b> <b>rate</b> and to provide the engineering and operating personnel with a guide for monitoring condenser back pressure in order to improve turbine thermal <b>heat</b> <b>rate</b> and turbine efficiency. Method and Procedure: Chapter 4 describes the method and procedure used for the pre and post outage evaluation to cost-effectively determine the current condition of the condenser and to quantify the increase in thermal <b>heat</b> <b>rate</b> due to condenser degradation. The pre and post outage evaluation offered an opportunity to evaluate and quantify the effectiveness of the maintenance program and the value of the capital layout undertaken during the scheduled Unit outage. Findings: Chapter 5 discusses the findings of the pre and post outage data analysis of the condenser using the EtaPRO system as the tool. Re-tubing 50 % of the condenser inner loop tubes and cleaning the other 50 % of the outer loop tubes demonstrated a decrease in condenser backpressure and therefore an improvement in thermal <b>heat</b> <b>rate.</b> This will also result in an improvement in turbine cycle efficiency and reduce coal cost...|$|R
