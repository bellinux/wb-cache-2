5|$|Although many of {{the coins}} bear {{the name of a}} moneyer, there is no {{indication}} of the mint where each coin was struck.

5|$|Although {{the first}} {{documentary}} {{reference to a}} castle at Framlingham occurs in 1148, the actual date of its construction is uncertain and three possible options have been suggested by academics. The first possibility is that the castle was built by Roger Bigod in either the late 11th century or around 1100, similar to the founding of Bigod's caput at nearby Eye. A second possibility is that Roger's son, Hugh Bigod, built it {{during the years of}} the Anarchy in the 1140s on the site of an existing manor house; the castle would then be similar to the Bigod fortification at Bungay. A third possibility <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> in fact two castles: the first being built in the late 11th century and then demolished by Hugh Bigod in the 1160s in order {{to make way for a}} newer, larger castle. Historian Magnus Alexander hypothesizes the castle might have been built on top of a set of pre-existing Anglo-Saxon, high prestige buildings, a practice common elsewhere in East Anglia, possibly echoing the arrangement at Castle Acre; this would be most likely if the castle was built in the 11th century.|$|E
5|$|Two {{conflicting}} views {{exist as}} to whether the war was a civil or an international war. The prevailing view in Serbia <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> two civil wars in the area: one between Croats and Serbs living in Croatia, and another between SFR Yugoslavia and Croatia, a part of the federation. The prevailing view in Croatia and of most international law experts, including both international courts ICTY and ICJ, is that the war was an international conflict, a war of aggression waged by the rump Yugoslavia and Serbia against Croatia, supported by Serbs in Croatia.The armed conflict in the former Yugoslavia started shortly after the date on which Slovenia and Croatia declared their independence on June 25, 1991 between the military forces of the SFRY and Slovenia and Croatia. Such armed conflict should of course be characterized as internal because the declarations of independence were suspended in consequence of the proposal of the EC for three months. After the expiration of the three months' period, on October 7, 1991, Slovenia proclaimed its independence with effect from that date, and Croatia with effect from October 8, 1991. So the armed conflict in the former Yugoslavia should be considered international as from October 8, 1991 because the independence of these two States was definite on that date}} Neither Croatia nor Yugoslavia ever formally declared war on each other. Unlike the Serbian position that the conflict need not be declared as it was a civil war, the Croatian motivation for not declaring war was that Tuđman believed that Croatia could not confront the JNA directly and did everything to avoid an all-out war.|$|E

25|$|Census {{figures in}} Ireland {{do not provide}} a {{breakdown}} of religions outside of the major Christian denominations and other major world religions. A total of 22,497 people stated Other Religion in the 2006 census; and a rough estimate <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> 2,000–3,000 practicing pagans in Ireland in 2009. Numerous pagan groups – primarily Wiccan and Druidic – exist in Ireland though none is officially recognised by the Government. Irish Paganism is often strongly concerned with issues of place and language.|$|E
25|$|Augustan drama has a {{reputation}} as an era of decline. One reason for this <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> few dominant figures of the Augustan stage. Instead of a single genius, a number of playwrights worked steadily to find subject matter that would appeal to a new audience. In addition to this, playhouses began to dispense with playwrights altogether or to hire playwrights to match assigned subjects, and this made the producer the master of the script. When the public did tire of anonymously authored, low-content plays and a new generation of wits made the stage political and aggressive again, the Whig ministry stepped in and began official censorship that put an end to daring and innovative content. This conspired with the public's taste for special effects to reduce theatrical output and promote the novel.|$|E

25|$|Whitney {{received}} a patent (later numbered as X72) for his cotton gin on March 14, 1794, {{but it was}} not validated until 1807. Whitney and his partner, Miller, did not intend to sell the gins. Rather, like the proprietors of grist and sawmills, they expected to charge farmers for cleaning their cotton – two-fifths of the value, paid in cotton. Resentment at this scheme, the mechanical simplicity of the device and the primitive state of patent law, made infringement inevitable. Whitney and Miller could not build enough gins to meet demand, so gins from other makers found ready sale. Ultimately, patent infringement lawsuits consumed the profits and their cotton gin company went out of business in 1797. One oft-overlooked point <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> drawbacks to Whitney's first design. There is significant evidence that the design flaws were solved by a plantation owner, Catharine Littlefield Greene, wife of the American Revolutionary War general Nathanael Greene; Whitney gave her no public credit or recognition.|$|E
25|$|China's {{educational}} television system began in 1960 but was suspended during the Cultural Revolution in 1966. In 1979 the Central Radio and Television University {{was established in}} Beijing with branches in twenty-eight provincial-level universities. Many Central Radio and Television University students were recent senior-middle school graduates who scored just below the cut-off point for admission to conventional colleges and universities. Full-time (who take four courses) and part-time students (two courses) had at least two years' work experience, and they return to their jobs after graduation. Spare-time students (one course) studied after work. Students whose work units granted them permission to study in a television university were paid their normal wages; expenses {{for most of their}} books and other educational materials were paid for by the state. A typical Central Radio and Television University student spent up to six hours a day over a three-year period watching lectures on videotapes produced by some of the best teachers in China. These lectures were augmented by face-to-face tutoring by local instructors and approximately four hours of homework each evening. The major problem with the system <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> too few television sets. In 1987 the Central Television and Radio University had its programs produced, transmitted and financed by the State Administration of Radio, Film, and Television. The State Education Commission developed its curriculum and distributed its printed support materials. Curriculum included both basic, general-purpose courses in science and technology and more specialized courses. The Central Television and Radio University offered more than 1,000 classes in Beijing and its suburbs and 14 majors in 2- to 3-year courses through 56 working centers. Students who passed final examinations were given certificates entitling them to the same level of remuneration as graduates of regular, full-time colleges and universities. The state gave certain allowances to students awaiting jobs during their training period.|$|E
2500|$|Another myth {{about the}} site <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> tunnels that led {{all the way}} to Teotihuacan. In reality, the {{underground}} passages are believed to have been caves [...] that were dynamited when North American soldiers were looking for treasure in 1847. Excavation work by INAH began in 1981, but much of the site is still unexcavated. The site has suffered damage from vandalism and graffiti, including a portion called the Patio of the Gods, where ceremonies to mark the spring equinox and the birthday of Nezahualcoyotl (August 28) are still held.|$|E

2500|$|In the {{historical}} literature Peter {{is thought to}} have been: boyar, great boil, comita, ichirgu-boil [...] and kavhan (conditional or unconditional). The discussion on the title (or office) of Peter is part of the scientific discussion on the place of the ichirgu-boil and the kavhan in the administration of the First Bulgarian Empire. The starting point of those discussions <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> one kavhan and one ichirgu-boil {{at the same time and}} that the kavhan is the higher office. The different views on the functions of Peter comes from the different interpretation of {{the historical}} sources (the letters of Pope John VIII, the notes of the Cividale gospel and the story of Anastasius Bibliothecarius about the Council of Constantinople).|$|E
2500|$|This ossuary {{was found}} on May 17, 1937; {{the day after the}} {{individual}} burial was discovered. [...] It contained 67 skeletons and was about 77 feet from the second ossuary.

[...] No European artifacts were found in this ossuary, as in Ossuary 2. [...] A difference from Ossuary 2 <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> few native made artifacts present, beyond low amounts of small shell beads, some bone awls, parts of worked deer antlers, broken animal bones, and broken pottery sherds.|$|E
2500|$|Uncertainty exists {{regarding}} {{the duration of}} the overall extinction and about the timing and duration of various groups' extinctions within the greater process. Some evidence suggests that there were multiple extinction pulses or that the extinction was spread out over a few million years, with a sharp peak in the last million years of the Permian. Statistical analyses of some highly fossiliferous strata in Meishan, Zhejiang Province in southeastern China, suggest that the main extinction was clustered around one peak. Recent research shows that different groups became extinct at different times; for example, while difficult to date absolutely, ostracod and brachiopod extinctions were separated by 670 to 1170 thousand years. In a well-preserved sequence in east Greenland, the decline of animals is concentrated in a period 10 to [...] long, with plants taking several hundred thousand additional years to show the full impact of the event. An older theory, still supported in some recent papers, <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> two major extinction pulses 9.4 million years apart, separated by a period of extinctions well above the background level, and that the final extinction killed off only about 80% of marine species alive at that time while the other losses occurred during the first pulse or the interval between pulses. According to this theory one of these extinction pulses occurred {{at the end of the}} Guadalupian epoch of the Permian.|$|E
