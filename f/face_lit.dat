25|$|One folk belief {{concerning}} the bakeneko {{is that they}} would lick the oil of oriental lamps, and in the Edo period encyclopedia, the Wakan Sansai Zue, {{it is said that}} for a cat to lick this oil is an omen of some strange event about to occur. People in the early modern period used cheap oils from fish, like sardine oil, in the lamps, and that could explain why cats would want to lick them. Also, the diet of Japanese people at that time was based mainly on grains and vegetables, and the leftovers would be fed to the cats. However, since cats are carnivores, such a diet would have been lacking in protein and fat, and therefore they would have been even more attracted to the oil in the lamps. Furthermore, the sight of a cat standing up its hind legs to reach the lamp, with its <b>face</b> <b>lit</b> up and eyes round with anticipation, could have seemed eerie and unnatural, like a yōkai.|$|E

Go home, get your England stuff ready, and I'll call first thing tomorrow...' Even though I was approximately the seventeenth choice, this was still fantastic news... After three disappointing Test appearances, this was my second chance, {{and the opportunity to}} set the record straight... the telephone finally rang. 'Got some bad news, I'm afraid,' David began. 'I couldn't persuade Ted Dexter or Mickey Stewart, so you're not in any more. They've gone for Alan Igglesden. Know anything about him?' With that, David must have known his influence as England captain was over – and indeed Graham Gooch succeeded him after that Test. I felt utterly devastated, and knew I would never play for England again, which had been my main motivating force. So when the Today newspaper offered me the post of cricket correspondent the following summer, it was an easy decision to make. I might have been only thirty, which was no age to retire from professional cricket, and I could easily have played for another five years. But it was definitely time to move on." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gregor von Rezzori {{wrote of}} Kraus, [...] " [...] life stands {{as an example}} of moral uprightness and courage which should be put before anyone who writes, in no matter what language... I had the {{privilege}} of listening to his conversation and watching his <b>face,</b> <b>lit</b> up by the pale fire of his fanatic love for the miracle of the German language and by his holy hatred for those who used it badly." ...|$|E
60|$|Up to {{that time}} it is {{probable}} that they believed that they were only being kept to be solemnly put to death. Their <b>faces</b> <b>lit</b> up, and without a word they sprang on to the horses' backs and dashed over the plains.|$|R

2500|$|The Radio Times kept up its {{positive}} {{reaction to the}} series throughout the programme's run. Of episode eight, Butcher again wrote a positive preview. [...] "We're halfway through this mesmerising serial and it {{shows no sign of}} letting up," [...] he wrote. [...] "As ever, each frame is composed to perfection, each <b>face</b> <b>lit</b> like an oil painting, and the acting is out of this world. You might want to take the phone off the hook." ...|$|E
2500|$|In retrospect, {{it is easy}} to see {{the monumental}} nature of Foster's {{appointment}} in lieu of the profound effects Rivers's work would have on Cambridge and indeed in the scientific world in general. However, at the time the Cambridge University Senate were wary of his appointment. As Bartlett writes: [...] "how many times have I heard Rivers, spectacles waving in the air, his <b>face</b> <b>lit</b> by his transforming smile, tell how, in Senatorial discussion, an ancient orator described him as a 'Ridiculous Superfluity'!" ...|$|E
2500|$|He kept many pets at {{home and}} Surgeon-General Bannerman noted in his preface to Eha's books that he often found himself having to go on {{unpleasant}} trips to the primeval forests of Cumballa Hill to look for mosquito larvae to feed the fish. In appearance Eha {{has been described as}} a long, thin, erect, bearded man...with a typically Scots <b>face</b> <b>lit</b> up with the humorous twinkle one came to know so well. A photograph taken in 1902 shows a fringe of hair encircling a bald head which is commented upon by Bannerman as [...] "a condition which Kemp's Equatorial Hair Douche had not been able to prevent".|$|E

50|$|Man of Many <b>Faces</b> (<b>lit.</b> 20 <b>Faces,</b> Please!!) is a manga by Clamp about {{a nine-year-old}} boy named Akira Ijyuin who steals {{beautiful}} and valuable objects to please his two mothers {{and is known}} {{to the public as}} the dashing, clever thief named the Man of 20 Faces. The manga took inspiration from the works of Edogawa Ranpo, most notably from The Fiend with Twenty Faces.|$|R
2500|$|In 1843, the Act for Regulating the Theatres {{came into}} force, {{bringing}} {{an end to}} the monopolies of the two existing companies and, by doing so, increased the number of theatres in London. At the same time, the fashion in theatre was [...] "pictorial": valuing visual spectacle above plot or characterisation and often required lengthy (and time consuming) scene changes. For example, Henry Irving's 1892 King Lear offered spectacles such as Lear's death beneath a cliff at Dover, his <b>face</b> <b>lit</b> by the red glow of a setting sun; at the expense of cutting 46% of the text, including the blinding of Gloucester. But Irving's production clearly evoked strong emotions: one spectator, Gordon Crosse, wrote of the first entrance of Lear, [...] "a striking figure with masses of white hair. He is leaning on a huge scabbarded sword which he raises with a wild cry in answer to the shouted greeting of his guards. His gait, his looks, his gestures, all reveal the noble, imperious mind already degenerating into senile irritability under the coming shocks of grief and age." ...|$|E

60|$|It is both {{painful and}} {{satisfactory}} {{to think how}} often these antitheses are to be observed in the individual most open to our observation--ourselves. We pass the evening with <b>faces</b> <b>lit</b> up by some flaring illumination or other: we get up the next morning--the fiery jets have all gone out, and nothing confronts us but a few crinkled pipes and sooty wirework, hardly even recalling {{the outline of the}} blazing picture that arrested our eyes before bedtime.|$|R

60|$|There was a silence, then a {{crashing}} {{among the}} interlacing vegetation, first here, then there, and then half-a-dozen <b>faces</b> appeared,--strange <b>faces,</b> <b>lit</b> by a strange light. M'ling made a growling noise in his throat. I recognised the Ape-man: I had indeed already identified his voice, {{and two of}} the white-swathed brown-featured creatures I had seen in Montgomery's boat. With these were the two dappled brutes and that grey, horribly crooked creature who said the Law, with grey hair streaming down its cheeks, heavy grey eyebrows, and grey locks pouring off from a central parting upon its sloping forehead,--a heavy, faceless thing, with strange red eyes, looking at us curiously from amidst the green.|$|R

60|$|With a grave <b>face</b> he <b>lit</b> {{the lamp}} {{and led the}} way down the corridor. Twice he struck at the chamber door without any reply from within. Then he turned the handle and entered, I at his heels, with the cocked pistol in my hand.|$|R
60|$|His {{eyes were}} {{flashing}} now and his <b>face</b> was <b>lit</b> {{up so that}} he hardly seemed the same man. There was a flush on his sallow, thin cheeks, and I forgot that his voice was harsh and unpleasant. There was even a certain charm about him.|$|R

5000|$|Van Gogh’s first {{impression}} on seeing {{the painting was}} that Gauguin had depicted him as a madman. He later softened his view. [...] "My <b>face</b> has <b>lit</b> up after all a lot since, but it was indeed me, extremely tired and charged with electricity as I was then".|$|R
60|$|At {{the end of}} supper, during dessert, {{the music}} began to play, violins, and flutes. Everybody's <b>face</b> was <b>lit</b> up. A glow of {{excitement}} prevailed. When the little speeches were over, and the port remained unreached for any more, those who wished were invited out to the open for coffee. The night was warm.|$|R
60|$|Gerald's <b>face</b> was <b>lit</b> up with {{an uncanny}} smile, full of light and rousedness, yet unconscious.

And she knew, she watched her own fascination.|$|R
