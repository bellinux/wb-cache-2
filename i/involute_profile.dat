Most of the gears are manufactured by <b>involute</b> <b>profile</b> with 20° pressure angle. When two gears are in mesh at one instant {{there is a}} chance to mate involute portion with non-involute portion of mating gear. This phenomenon is known as [...] "interference" [...] and occurs when the number of teeth on the smaller of the two meshing gears is less than a required minimum. To avoid interference we can have undercutting, {{but this is not a}} suitable solution as undercutting leads to weakening of tooth at its base. In this situation Corrected gears are used.

Other uses are in consumer electronics and many machines used in homes like the washing machines, electric drills and kitchen appliances. Gears come in different sizes ranging from a module of 0. 5 to 100 mm. Currently {{there is a problem}} of accurately machining gears. This is due to inaccurate positioning of the blank and cutter. The objective {{of the study was to}} investigate and determine the appropriate way of producing quality and accurate gears most economically through the use of a circle as a substitute to <b>involute</b> <b>profile</b> in gear cutting. Two different gears of same dimensional characteristics were cut; one using a Computer Numerical Control machine utilizing circle profile and the other using conventional milling machine. Dimensional comparisons were made of the two cut gears against an actual <b>involute</b> <b>profile</b> to determine the margin of error. The circle <b>involute</b> <b>profile</b> made using CNC was found to be exactly as the true <b>involute</b> <b>profile</b> though an error of 0. 078 mm was observed in some sections of the profile. For the hobbing case, it was impossible to accurately machine the actual depth and as such, the intended depth of 7. 32 was surpassed by 0. 2 mm. The tooth was thicker throughout the length of the profile and the fillet radii lucked homogeneity. The involute circle approach was therefore successful and as such can benefit all CNC users and gear cutters in producing accurate gears cheaply...|$|E

The gear honing process is used to eliminate errors that appears after the heat treatment on the tooth surface and. Although the material and cutting speed of the tool {{are similar to the}} grinding process, honing the process simulates true cinematic movement of the mesh gear, which provides a better surface roughness compared to the Hobbing process. Consequently, it is hard to correct anomalies in the gear teeth. This process has been used to improve the mechanisḿs hydraulic steering pinion / rack system. For the experiments, it were compared two processes, namely honing and hard Hobbing in order to assess the adequate strength in the direction of clockwise rotation and counter clockwise, which represents the actual effort exerted by the driver of the vehicle.

A strong {{demand for}} higher efficiency compressors {{that meet the}} stringent requirements of small size, light weight and quiet operation {{has resulted in the}} development of the scroll compressor. A scroll compressor’s pressure ratio is defined solely by the geometry of the scroll wraps. The equations for the <b>involute</b> <b>profiles</b> are established and the volume of the pockets are derived to illustrate the relationship between the various parameters. The relationships for the axial, radial, and tangential components of gas pressure forces, centrifugal force, bearing frictional forces, and contact forces are presented to quantify the system behavior. Optimization process has been employed as a tool to systematize the engineering design. The optimum design of the scroll compressor is formulated as a measure of performance parameters to be optimized while satisfying all the problem constraints. The system is mathematically defined in terms of the design variables, three objective functions (radius, mass of the orbiting scroll, and average torque to drive the compressor) and constraint equations representing the relationships within the design problem. Sensitivity analysis was performed on the design variables to determine their significance in the optimum design of the system. A multicriterion optimization of the scroll compressor was performed by considering the various objective functions simultaneously and assigning weighting coefficients to each objective function The relative size of the weighting coefficients reflect the relative importance of the various objective functions in the composite function.
