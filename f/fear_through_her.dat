60|$|Beatrice made no answer; {{that look}} sent a thrill of <b>fear</b> <b>through</b> <b>her.</b> Oh; what had happened! Or was it all a dream? Had she dreamed that she stood {{face to face}} with Geoffrey in his room before a great {{darkness}} struck her and overwhelmed her? Or was it an awful truth, and if a truth, how came she here again? She went to the pantry, found a morsel of bread and ate it, for faintness still pursued her. Then feeling better, she left the house and set her face towards the beach.|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{where are}} we to go?" [...] said Gwendolen, with a trace of {{sharpness}} in her tone. She felt a new current of <b>fear</b> passing <b>through</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R
60|$|A sudden pang of <b>fear</b> shot <b>through</b> <b>her.</b> She {{thought he}} felt himself dying, and she sank on her knees at his feet, holding his hand, while {{she looked up at}} him, almost breathless.|$|R
60|$|The girl's heart sank, and {{a feeling}} of cold <b>fear</b> crept <b>through</b> <b>her.</b> For years that name had been the symbol of fierce cruelty, and mad hatred against her kind. Little {{children}} were frightened into obedience by the vaguest hint that the Devil of Torn would get them, and grown men had come to whisper the name with grim, set lips.|$|R
5000|$|Dr. Coleman-Adebayo was {{a senior}} policy analyst for the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). She founded two employee-rights groups, EPA Employees Against Racial Discrimination and the No <b>FEAR</b> coalition. <b>Through</b> <b>her</b> leadership, the No FEAR Coalition, working closely with Representative James Sensenbrenner, {{organized}} a successful grass-roots campaign and obtained overwhelming Congressional support for the [...] "Notification of Federal Employees Anti-discrimination and Retaliation Act." [...] The Act {{was signed into law}} by President Bush in 2002.|$|R
6000|$|Closer {{and closer}} to the fringe of willows along the river she came, until, at their very edge, there broke upon her already taut nerves the hideous and uncanny scream of a wildcat. The girl stopped short in her tracks. She felt the chill of <b>fear</b> creep <b>through</b> <b>her</b> skin, and a {{twitching}} at the roots of her hair evidenced to her the extremity of her terror. Should she turn back? The horses might be between her and the river, but judgment told her that they had crossed. Should she brave the nervous fright of a passage through that dark, forbidding labyrinth of gloom when she knew that she should not find the horses within reach beyond? ...|$|R
60|$|There was {{the letter}} sure enough, {{and another in}} a woman's writing. She {{recognised}} the hand as that of Lady Honoria, which she had often seen on envelopes directed to Geoffrey, and a thrill of <b>fear</b> shot <b>through</b> <b>her.</b> She took the letters, and walking as quickly as she could to the school, locked herself in her own little room, for {{it was not yet}} nine o'clock, and looked at them with a gathering terror. What was in them? Why did Lady Honoria write to her? Which should she read first? In a moment Beatrice had made up her mind. She would face the worst at once. With a set face she opened Lady Honoria's letter, unfolded it, and read. We already know its contents. As her mind grasped them her lips grew ashy white, and by the time that the horrible thing was done she was nigh to fainting.|$|R
60|$|Yet a quiver of <b>fear</b> went <b>through</b> <b>her.</b> If {{he should}} leave her? She sat conjuring fears and sufferings, till she wept with very self-pity. She {{did not know}} what she would do if he left her, or if he turned against her. The thought of it chilled her, made her desolate and hard. And against him, the stranger, the outsider, the being who wanted to arrogate authority, she {{remained}} steadily fortified. Was she not herself? How could one who was not of her own kind presume with authority? She knew she was immutable, unchangeable, she was not afraid for her own being. She was only afraid of all that was not herself. It pressed round her, it came to her and took part in her, in form of her man, this vast, resounding, alien world which was not herself. And he had so many weapons, he might strike from so many sides.|$|R
6000|$|In pursuance of this plan, {{the anxious}} little {{housekeeper}} removed the trout from the kettle, which she cleaned out and refilled with snow. When this was melted and boiled, she {{put in the}} tea. In due time this also was ready, and she sallied forth once more, with a feeling approaching to anxiety, to look for Frank. Still her companion did not make his appearance, {{and for the first}} time a feeling of dread touched her heart. She strove to avert it, however, by considering that Frank might have been obliged to follow the wolf farther than he expected or intended. Then a thrill of <b>fear</b> passed <b>through</b> <b>her</b> breast as the thought occurred, [...] "What if the wolf has attacked and killed him?" [...] As time wore on, and no sound of voice or gun or bark of dog broke the dreary stillness of that gloomy place, a feeling of intense horror took possession of the child's mind, and she pictured to herself all kinds of possible evils that might have befallen her companion; while at the same time she could not but feel how awful was her unprotected and helpless condition. One thought, however, comforted her, and this was that Maximus would certainly come to the hut on his return to the fort. This relieved her mind in regard to herself; but the very relief on that point enabled her all the more to realise the dangers to which Frank might be exposed without any one to render him assistance.|$|R

2500|$|According to {{the account}} of Zosimus, [...] "When Maria {{was about to be}} married to Honorius, her mother, deeming her too young for the marriage-state and being unwilling to defer the marriage, {{although}} she thought that to submit so young and tender a person to the embraces of a man was offering violence to nature, she had recourse to a woman who knew how to manage such affairs, and by her means contrived that Maria should live with the emperor and share his bed, but that he should not have the power to deprive her of virginity. In the meantime Maria died a virgin, and Serena, who, as may readily be supposed, was desirous to become the grandmother of a young emperor or empress, <b>through</b> <b>fear</b> of <b>her</b> influence being diminished, used all her endeavours to marry her other daughter to Honorius." [...] The account may have attempted to explain why Maria died without giving birth. However this might also be explained by the young ages of the imperial couple, the tale of Honorius being drugged by his mother-in-law Serena considered fanciful. Her sister Thermantia went on to marry Honorius.|$|R
60|$|Here he {{straightened}} up, threw away the splinter, {{and took off}} his hat. He was a very pleasant figure as the girl stole a look at him. His black laughing eyes were especially earnest just now. His voice had a touch of pleading. The popple tree over their heads murmured applause at his eloquence, then hushed to listen. A cloud dropped a silent shadow down upon them, and it sent a little thrill of <b>fear</b> <b>through</b> Rob, {{as if it were}} an omen of failure. As the girl remained silent, looking away, he began, man-fashion, to desire her more and more as he feared to lose her. He put his hat on the post again and took out his jackknife. Her calico dress draped her supple and powerful figure simply but naturally. The stoop in her shoulders, given by labor, disappeared as she partly leaned upon the fence. The curves of her muscular arms showed <b>through</b> <b>her</b> sleeve.|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the experience that}} a heart transplant has on a human being. To analyze the subject matter, we decided to conduct {{an interview with a}} woman, whom we chose to refer as “Eva”, who in her mid- 20 ’s received a heart transplant. To properly interview and thereafter analyze the interview, we made use of phenomenology. With phenomenology, we were able to conduct an open interview, where our goal was to capture our informant, Eva’s experience with her transplanted heart. After the interview, we identified four central themes that we decided best captured the most important aspects of Eva’s experience with her transplanted heart. These themes were heart as a symbol, heart in regards to identity, heart as a gift and death itself. We concluded through our analysis that Eva’s rational thinking in regards to the new heart, meant that our informant did not view the new heart in a symbolical way. Eva has a dualistic view on the self and the body, and therefore has no issues in separating the two. The new heart did not shape or alter her identity. Eva is capable of separating the new heart from her identity. The heart’s function, in Eva’s view, is that of a mere motor and carries no emotional value. In regards to her new heart being a gift, we concluded that Eva contradicts herself. She does this by both describing the heart as being a machine, but also admits a desire not to dishonour it. <b>Through</b> <b>her</b> own involvement in organ donation and plea for others to consider organ donation, we arrived at the conclusion that a part of her subconscious was trying to live up to her transplanted heart. Eva’s battle with her own health and thus death, is seen <b>through</b> <b>her</b> positive outlook on life. She does not <b>fear</b> death, and <b>through</b> <b>her</b> positive outlook on life, she is able to confront her inevitable death with a sense of ease. Through our analysis we’ve reached a better understanding of Eva’s experience with the transplanted heart. By no means is her experience shared by every single person who has received a heart transplant. Eva’s story is one of many, and in an ever technologically advancing world, an increasing amount of people will have {{to come to terms with}} organs inside them, which are not biologically their own...|$|R

6000|$|And yet, {{happy as}} she was, Netta {{could never be}} {{absolutely}} free from a pressing fear, a doubt that Cyril might not repent his choice, and feel sorry in the end for not having married a real lady. That <b>fear</b> pursued <b>her</b> <b>through</b> all <b>her</b> little triumph, and almost succeeded in making her half jealous of Cyril whenever she saw him talking at all earnestly (and he was very apt to be earnest) with other women. [...] "They know {{so much more than}} I do," [...] she thought to herself often; [...] "he must feel so much more at home with them, naturally, and {{be able to talk to}} them about so many things that he can never possibly talk about with poor little me." [...] Poor girl, it never even occurred to her that from the higher standpoint of a really learned man like Cyril Milliter the petty smattering of French and strumming of the piano, wherein alone these grand girls actually differed from her, were mere useless surface accomplishments, in no way affecting the inner intelligence or culture, which were the only things that Cyril regarded in any serious light as worthy of respect or admiration. As a matter of fact, Netta had learnt infinitely more from her Bible, her English books, her own heart, and surrounding nature, than any of these well-educated girls had learnt from their parrot-trained governesses; and she was infinitely better fitted than any of them to be a life companion for such a man as Cyril Milliter.|$|R
