25|$|People {{suspected}} of being dependent on benzodiazepine drugs should be very <b>gradually</b> <b>tapered</b> off the drug. Withdrawals can be life-threatening, particularly when excessive doses have been taken for extended periods of time. Equal prudence should be used whether dependence has occurred in therapeutic or recreational contexts.|$|E
2500|$|Clonidine therapy should {{generally}} be <b>gradually</b> <b>tapered</b> when discontinuing therapy to avoid rebound effects from occurring. Treatment of clonidine withdrawal hypertension {{depends on the}} severity of the condition. Reintroduction of clonidine for mild cases, [...] alpha and beta blockers for more urgent situations. Beta blockers never should be used alone to treat clonidine withdrawal as alpha vasoconstriction would still continue.|$|E
2500|$|Opium {{tincture}} is used {{to treat}} neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) when diluted 1:25 (one part opium tincture to 25 parts water). The recommended dose is 0.2 mL of the diluted solution under the tongue every three hours, which may be increased by 0.05 mL every three hours until no objective signs of withdrawal are observed. In no event, however, should the dose exceed 0.7 mL every three hours. [...] The opium tincture is <b>gradually</b> <b>tapered</b> over a 3–5 week period, {{at which point the}} newborn should be completely free of withdrawal symptoms.|$|E

60|$|We {{discharged}} {{the carriage}} at the bridge. The river {{was full of}} logs--long, slender, barkless pine logs--and we leaned on the rails of the bridge, and watched the men put them together into rafts. These rafts were of a shape and construction to suit the crookedness and extreme narrowness of the Neckar. They were from fifty to one hundred yards long, and they <b>gradually</b> <b>tapered</b> from a nine-log breadth at their sterns, to a three-log breadth at their bow-ends. The {{main part of the}} steering is done at the bow, with a pole; the three-log breadth there furnishes room for only the steersman, for these little logs are not larger around than an average young lady's waist. The connections of the several sections of the raft are slack and pliant, so that the raft may be readily bent into any sort of curve required by the shape of the river.|$|E
60|$|To {{this speech}} Louisa made no reply, but {{continued}} gazing on the object which had elicited her remarks. In {{addition to the}} bright and circular flame, was now to be seen a fainter, though a vivid light, of an equal diameter to the other at the upper end, but which, after extending downward for many feet, <b>gradually</b> <b>tapered</b> to a point at its lower extremity. A dark space was plainly visible between the two, and the new illumination was placed beneath the other, the whole forming an appearance not unlike an inverted note of admiration. It was soon evident that the latter was nothing but the reflection, from the water, of the former, and that the object, whatever it might be, was advancing across, or rather over the lake, for {{it seemed to be}} several feet above its surface, in a direct line with themselves. Its motion was amazingly rapid, the ladies having hardly discovered that it was moving at all, before the waving light of a flame was discerned, losing its regular shape, while it increased in size, as it approached.|$|E

60|$|The sledge {{on which}} Edith was seated was formed {{very much in}} the same manner as the little sled which had been made for her at Fort Chimo. It was very much larger, how ever, and could have easily held eight or ten persons. The runners, which were shod with frozen mud (a {{substance}} that was now becoming nearly unfit for use owing to the warm weather), were a perfect wonder of ingenuity--as, indeed, was the whole machine--being pieced and lashed together with lines of raw hide in the most complicated manner and very neatly. The dogs were each fastened by a separate line to the sledge, the best dog being placed in the centre and having the longest line, while the others were attached by lines proportionably shorter according to the distance of each from the leading dog, and the outsiders being close to the runners of the sledge. All the lines were attached to the front bar of the machine. There were many advantages attending this mode of harnessing, among which were the readiness with which any dog could be attached or detached without affecting the others, and the ease with which Annatock, when so inclined, could lay hold of the line of a refractory dog, haul him back without stopping the others, and give him a cuffing. This, however, was seldom done, as the driver could touch any member of the team with the point of his whip. The handle of this terrible instrument was not much more than eighteen or twenty inches long, but the lash was upwards of six yards! Near the handle it was about three inches broad, being thick cords of walrus-hide platted; it <b>gradually</b> <b>tapered</b> towards the point, where it terminated in a fine line of the same material. While driving, the long lash of this whip trails on the snow behind the sledge, and by a peculiar sleight of hand its serpentine coils can be brought up for instant use.|$|E
