40|$|The Blue Bond proposal, {{published}} in May 2010 (Bruegel Policy Brief 2010 / 03) suggests that sovereign debt in euro-area countries be {{split into two}} parts. The first part, the senior ‘Blue’ tranche of up to 60 percent of GDP, would be pooled among participating countries and jointly and severally guaranteed. The second part, the <b>junior</b> ‘Red’ <b>tranche,</b> would keep debt in excess of 60 percent of GDP as a purely national responsibility. This paper revisits the proposal, discusses its implications and addresses {{some of the comments}} and criticisms received in response to the proposal.

50|$|All the tranches {{together}} make up what {{is referred}} to as the deal's capital structure or liability structure. They are generally paid sequentially from the most senior to most subordinate (and generally unsecured), although certain tranches with the same security may be paid pari passu. The more senior rated tranches generally have higher bond credit ratings (ratings) than the lower rated tranches. For example, senior tranches may be rated AAA, AA or A, while a <b>junior,</b> unsecured <b>tranche</b> may be rated BB. However, ratings can fluctuate after the debt is issued and even senior tranches could be rated below investment grade (less than BBB). The deal's indenture (its governing legal document) usually details the payment of the tranches in a section often referred to as the waterfall (because the moneys flow down).|$|R

5000|$|The first {{private label}} deals {{in the late}} 1980s and early 1990 often had only two tranches, but by 2005-06 the deals became more complex.

(See table to the right.) Dubbed [...] "CMLTI 2006-NC2", the deal involved 4499 subprime mortgages originated by New Century Financial—a California-based lender—and issued by a special purpose entity created and sponsored by Citigroup. The entity issued 19 tranches of mortgage-backed bonds worth $947 million. Since Citigroup and other firms focused on achieving high ratings, the (four) senior ranches rated triple A made up 78% or $737 million of the deal.

40|$|We {{present a}} method for pricing {{structured}} CAT bonds based on utility indifference pricing. The CAT bond considered here is issued in two distinct notes called tranches, specifically senior and junior tranches {{each with its own}} payment schedule. Our contributions to the literature of CAT bond pricing are two-fold. First, we apply indifference pricing to structured CAT bonds. We find a price for the senior tranche as a relative indifference price, that is, relative to the price of the <b>junior</b> <b>tranche.</b> Alternatively, one could take the approach that the senior tranche is priced first and the price of the <b>junior</b> <b>tranche</b> is relative to that. Second, instead of simply supposing that the "not-issue-a-CAT-bond" strategy of the reinsurer is to do nothing, we suppose that the reinsurer reduces its risk by reinsuring proportionally less claims. We assume that the reinsurance claims follow a (Poisson) jump-diffusion process. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} simple {{model of the}} sovereign-bank diabolic loop, and {{establish}} four results. First, the diabolic loop can be avoided by restricting banks domestic sovereign exposures relative to their equity. Second, equity requirements can be lowered if banks only hold senior domestic sovereign debt. Third, such requirements shrink even further if banks only hold the senior tranche of an internationally diversified sovereign portfolio known as ESBies in the euro-area context. Finally, ESBies generate more safe assets than domestic debt tranching alone; and, insofar as the diabolic loop is defused, the <b>junior</b> <b>tranche</b> generated by the securitization is itself risk-free...|$|E
40|$|The {{structural}} model of sovereign credit risk introduced {{in an earlier}} paper by the authors is applied here to measure the impact of introducing Eurobonds. Tranching (i. e. splitting the public debt into a senior and a <b>junior</b> <b>tranche)</b> is coupled with a cross-guarantee among eurozone countries and with a cash transfer. We show that Eurobonds can reduce the overall cost of servicing the public debt for some (high debt) countries in the euro area without increasing the cost for other countries. Moreover, {{they are likely to}} give governments an incentive to curb their deficits, due to the higher marginal cost of debt...|$|E
40|$|We examine {{screening}} incentives, {{welfare and}} the case for mandatory skin-in-the-game. Ex ante banks can screen, using interim private information to choose retentions and structuring. Ex post speculators trade with rational hedging investors. Absent regulation, there is a separating equilibrium with voluntary retentions. If funding value is high, banks may instead originate-to-distribute (OTD), selling the entire asset in opaque form, deterring informed speculation and destroying screening incentives. Under weaker conditions, banks instead sell the asset in transparent form, using tranching to increase hedging demand, informed speculation and price informativeness. With sufficient informed speculation, transparent OTD actually creates stronger screening incentives than voluntary retentions. In all unregulated market equilibria, interim adverse selection reduces screening incentives, so mandated retentions potentially increase welfare. To induce screening via pooling, banks {{should be required to}} retain a uniform <b>junior</b> <b>tranche</b> size which decreases in informational efficiency. However, uniform retention mandates may not be optimal. To improve risk-sharing, screening can instead be induced via separating contracts by compelling banks to choose from a menu of <b>junior</b> <b>tranche</b> retention sizes. In either case, efficiency of risk-sharing is maximized by splitting marketed claims into safe senior and risky mezzanine tranches. Finally, the separating (pooling) regulatory regime generally leads to higher welfare if efficient risk-sharing (bank investment scale) is the dominant consideration, and is always optimal in informationally inefficient markets. adverse selection; originate to distribute; screening incentives; securitization; skin in the game; speculator; uninformed investors...|$|E

40|$|As {{a sign of}} ambivalence in the {{regulatory}} definition of capital adequacy for credit risk {{and the quest for}} more efficient refinancing sources collateral loan obligations (CLOs) have become a prominent securitisation mechanism. This paper presents a loss-based asset pricing model for the valuation of constituent tranches within a CLO-style security design. The model specifically examines how tranche subordination translates securitised credit risk into investment risk of issued tranches as beneficial interests on a designated loan pool typically underlying a CLO transaction. We obtain a tranchespecific term structure from an intensity-based simulation of defaults under both robust statistical analysis and extreme value theory (EVT). Loss sharing between issuers and investors according to a simplified subordination mechanism allows issuers to decompose securitised credit risk exposures into a collection of default sensitive debt securities with divergent risk profiles and expected investor returns. Our estimation results suggest a dichotomous effect of loss cascading, with the default term structure of the most <b>junior</b> <b>tranche</b> of CLO transactions (“first loss position”) being distinctly {{different from that of the}} remaining, more senior “investor tranches”. The first loss position carries large expected loss (with high investor return) and low leverage, whereas all other tranches mainly suffer from loss volatility (unexpected loss). These findings might explain why issuers retain the most <b>junior</b> <b>tranche</b> as credit enhancement to attenuate asymmetric information between issuers and investors. At the same time, the issuer discretion in the configuration of loss subordination within particular security design might give rise to implicit investment risk in senior tranches in the event of systemic shocks.

European Safe Bonds (ESBies), a union-wide safe asset without joint liability, would help to resolve these problems. We make three contributions. First, numerical simulations show that ESBies {{would be at least}} as safe as German bunds and approximately double the supply of euro safe assets when protected by a 30 %-thick <b>junior</b> <b>tranche.</b> Second, a model shows how, when and why the two features of ESBies - diversification and seniority - can weaken the diabolic loop and its diffusion across countries.

40|$|Ambivalence in the {{regulatory}} definition of capital adequacy for credit risk has recently steered {{the financial services}} industry to collateral loan obligations (CLOs) as an important balance sheet management tool. CLOs represent a specialised form of Asset-Backed Securitisation (ABS), with investors acquiring a structured claim on the interest proceeds generated from a portfolio of bank loans {{in the form of}} tranches with different seniority. By way of modelling Merton-type risk-neutral asset returns of contingent claims on a multi-asset portfolio of corporate loans in a CLO transaction, we analyse the optimal design of loan securitisation from the perspective of credit risk in potential collateral default. We propose a pricing model that draws on a careful simulation of expected loan loss based on parametric bootstrapping through extreme value theory (EVT). The analysis illustrates the dichotomous effect of loss cascading, as the most <b>junior</b> <b>tranche</b> of CLO transactions exhibits a distinctly different default tolerance compared to the remaining tranches. By solving the puzzling question of properly pricing the risk premium for expected credit loss, we explain the rationale of first loss retention as credit risk cover on the basis of our simulation results for pricing purposes under the impact of asymmetric information...|$|E
40|$|This article {{examines}} {{the performance of the}} <b>junior</b> <b>tranche</b> of a Collateralized Fund Obligation (CFO), i. e. the residual claim (equity) on a securitized portfolio of hedge funds. We use a polynomial goal programming model to create optimal portfolios of hedge funds, conditional to investor preferences and diversification constraints (maximum allocation per strategy). For each portfolio we build CFO structures that have different levels of leverage, and analyze both the stand alone performance as well as potential diversification benefits (low systematic risk exposures) of investing in the Equity Tranche of these structures. We find that the unconstrained mean-variance portfolio yields a high performance, but greater exposure to systematic risk. We observe the exact opposite picture in the case of unconstrained optimization where a skewness bias is added, thus proving the existence of a trade-off between stand alone performance and low exposure to systematic risk factors. We provide evidence that leveraged exposure to these hedge fund portfolios through the structuring of CFOs creates value for the Equity Tranche investor.

40|$|In {{a typical}} cash flow {{securitization}} a SPV (Special Purpose Vehicle) transfers interest income and principal repayments from {{a portfolio of}} risky assets, the so called asset pool, to a prioritized set of tranches. The level of credit exposure of every single tranche depends upon its level of subordination: so, the <b>junior</b> <b>tranche</b> {{will be the first}} to bear the effect of a credit deterioration of the asset pool, and senior tranches the last. The asset pool can be made up by either any type of debt instrument, mainly bonds or bank loans, or Credit Default Swaps (CDS) in which the SPV sells protection 1. When the asset pool is made up solely of CDS contracts we talk of ‘synthetic ’ Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs); in the so called ‘semi-synthetic ’ CDOs, instead, the asset pool is made up by both debt instruments and CDS contracts. The tranches backed by the asset pool can be funded or not, depending upon the fact that the final investor purchases a true debt instrument (note) or a mere synthetic credit exposure. Generally, when the asset pool is constituted by debt instruments, the SPV issues notes (usually divided in more tranches) which are sold to the final investor; in synthetic CDOs, instead, tranches are represented by basket CDSs with which the final investor sell...|$|E
40|$|The EU Commission proposes {{establishing}} Sovereign-Backed Securities (SBSs) as a {{class of}} safe assets for the euro area. SBSs are generated by an issuing agency that would purchase a large diversified portfolio of national sovereign bonds, and finance the purchases by issuing (at least) two types of structured bonds: a risk-free senior SBSs tranche and a risky junior SBSs tranche. Overall, we recognise that the SBSs concept has the theoretical potential to improve financial stability and financial integration in the euro area, provided it is built on a sound framework that overcomes several potential technical and political problems. However, SBSs could pose the risk of eventually leading to unconditional debt mutualisation in times of severe crisis. With regard to technical problems, {{it is not clear}} whether the SBSs concept represents a viable business model for a private entity, and whether senior and junior SBSs would find sufficient demand, particularly in times of crisis. If the market for the <b>junior</b> <b>tranche</b> broke down, the whole concept would collapse. In such instances, the political risk could arise that rescue measures are taken that, in contrast to existing rescue mechanisms (ESM and OMT), are not subject to sufficient controls by Member States, solvency tests and reform requirements (conditionality). Another political risk relates to the introduction of the SBSs concept, which is regarded here as one part of a political compromise. We foresee the danger that the second part - de-privileging national sovereign bonds in banking regulation to sever the sovereign-banking nexus - may not be followed through, due to political resistance and to sequencing problems with introducing SBSs. Other political problems concern possible market distortions even in non-crisis times (particularly in primary markets), and the potential irreversibility of the concept. [ [...] . ...|$|E
