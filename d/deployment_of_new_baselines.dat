In this paper, we propose a new distributed service-oriented framework for wireless multihop networks, called MultiServ, in which it adopts a quantitative approach toward optimal traffic distribution. Under Multiserv framework, an efficient overlay network can be easily constructed that can greatly facilitate the <b>deployment</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> services.

To support multiple applications which may change over the lifetime of the network, the programming system should allow for the <b>deployment</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> code in an efficient and on-demand fashion. Existing programming frameworks focus on providing an efficient means for reprogramming an entire network; we believe that self-directed propagation can be more efficient for applications that do not require (or would not benefit from) network-wide <b>deployment</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> code. We present and analyze a framework enabling autonomous programs (agents) capable of propagating themselves through a sensor network. 1...|$|R

40|$|Policy {{intervention}} {{schemes for}} increased <b>deployment</b> <b>of</b> solar photovoltaics (PV) have been launched in several countries, with varying success. In {{order to ensure}} an efficient <b>deployment</b> <b>of</b> the technology, thorough knowledge is needed about relevant present actors and institutions, and about how a desirable actor base and institutional setup should look like; mere cost reductions are not enough to guarantee <b>deployment</b> <b>of</b> a <b>new</b> technology. A framework that captures the systemic nature of technical change, i. e. the development and <b>deployment</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> technology, is the technological innovation systems (TIS) framework. The objective {{of this paper is}} to discuss how the TIS framework could be used to analyze policy for PV with a focus on <b>deployment</b> <b>of</b> grid-connected, building-sited PV systems. So far, little emphasis has been on using TIS for detailed analysis <b>of</b> <b>deployment</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> emerging energy technologies. The TIS framework has been used for analyzing market growth <b>of</b> <b>new</b> energy technologies including processes <b>of</b> <b>deployment</b> in parallel with processes of technology development and production. We argue that “upstream” parts of the PV value chain differ fundamentally from “downstream” parts in that “upstream” activities (e. g. production of purified silicon, wafers, and solar cells) can often be understood as pertaining to a global TIS, while “downstream” activities (system installation etc.) could generally be assumed to be part of a more local (or national) TIS, and we identify and discuss components and processes of the TIS that are of particular importance for <b>deployment</b> <b>of</b> PV...|$|R
