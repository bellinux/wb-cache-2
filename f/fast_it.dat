5|$|Affeldt {{had three}} {{different}} kinds of pitches: a sinking fastball (which is rare for a lefty), a curveball, and a split. His fastball travelled in the low nineties, and while his curveball was not <b>fast,</b> <b>it</b> had late breaking action and {{got a lot of}} swing-throughs. Affeldt induced groundballs at a high rate with his sinking fastball and could also get the strikeout when the situation called for it.|$|E
5|$|The {{explanation}} of this instability {{begins with the}} existence of tiny perturbations in the stream. These are always present, no matter how smooth the stream is. If the perturbations are resolved into sinusoidal components, we find that some components grow with time while others decay with time. Among those that grow with time, some grow at faster rates than others. Whether a component decays or grows, and how <b>fast</b> <b>it</b> grows is entirely a function of its wave number (a measure of how many peaks and troughs per centimeter) and the radii of the original cylindrical stream.|$|E
5|$|William Russell, {{senior partner}} of 'Russell, Majors, and Waddell' {{and one of}} the biggest investors in the Pony Express, used the 1860 presidential {{election}} as a way to promote the Pony Express and how <b>fast</b> <b>it</b> could deliver the U.S. Mail. Prior to the election, Russell hired extra riders to ensure that fresh riders and relay horses were available along the route. On November 7, 1860, a Pony Express rider departed Fort Kearny, Nebraska Territory (the end of the eastern telegraph line) with the election results. Riders sped along the route, over snow-covered trails and into Fort Churchill, Nevada Territory (the end of the western telegraph line). California's newspapers received word of Lincoln's election only seven days and 17 hours after the East Coast papers, an unrivaled feat at the time.|$|E

Flowers are associated with how pretty the girls are in the colorful costumes. They form circles and triangles during the dance.

25|$|Aside {{from the}} {{properties}} described in articles about electromagnetism, charge is a relativistic invariant.

25|$|More bands {{provide more}} {{discrete}} information, or greater resolution. The characteristic emission and absorption spectra serve to fingerprint or define {{the makeup of}} the feature that was observed. A radiometric plot represents the radiant intensity versus time; there can be plots at multiple bands or wavelengths. For each point along a time-intensity radiometric plot, a spectral plot can be generated {{based on the number of}} spectral bands in the collector, such as the radiant intensity plot of a missile exhaust plume as the missile is in flight. The intensity or brightness of the object is a function of several conditions including its temperature, surface properties or material, and how <b>fast</b> <b>it</b> is moving. Remember that additional, non-electro-optical sensors, such as ionizing radiation detectors, can correlate with these bands.|$|E
25|$|The {{definition}} of angular momentum for a point particle is a pseudovector r×p, the cross {{product of the}} particle's position vector r (relative to some origin) and its momentum vector p = mv. This definition {{can be applied to}} each point in continua like solids or fluids, or physical fields. Unlike momentum, angular momentum does depend on where the origin is chosen, since the particle's position is measured from it. The angular momentum of an object can also be connected to the angular velocity ω of the object (how <b>fast</b> <b>it</b> rotates about an axis) via the moment of inertia I (which depends on the shape and distribution of mass about the axis of rotation). However, while ω always points {{in the direction of the}} rotation axis, the angular momentum L may point in a different direction depending on how the mass is distributed.|$|E
25|$|The {{prairie dog}} is well adapted to predators. Using its dichromatic color vision, it can detect predators {{from a great}} distance; it then alerts other prairie dogs of the danger with a special, high-pitched call. Constantine Slobodchikoff and others assert that prairie dogs use a {{sophisticated}} system of vocal communication to describe specific predators. According to them, prairie dog calls contain specific information {{as to what the}} predator is, how big it is and how <b>fast</b> <b>it</b> is approaching. These have been described as a form of grammar. According to Slobodchikoff, these calls, with their individuality in response to a specific predator, imply that prairie dogs have highly developed cognitive abilities. He also writes that prairie dogs have calls for things that are not predators to them. This is cited as evidence that the animals have a very descriptive language and have calls for any potential threat.|$|E

25|$|In baseball, {{although}} only {{the positions of}} pitcher and catcher are prescribed by the rules, fielders' positions are dictated closely by custom, and shifts in fielders' positions according to circumstance are less dramatic; the strike zone and smaller angle of fair territory limit the usefulness of some strategies which cricket makes available to batsmen. The chief occasion on which fielding placement differs markedly from the usual {{is the presence of}} a pull, or dead-pull, hitter at bat (such hitters almost never, except on the rare occasion of a fluke or mishit, hit the ball in any direction except towards {{the same side of the}} field as they stand at the plate, i.e. a right-handed pull hitter hits everything toward left field). In such case the fielders will move so far in the direction of the pull that one half of the field is almost completely unprotected. This is called an infield shift or overshift. A six-man infield has also been used when circumstances warrant. For the great majority of batters, however, the traditional fielding arrangement is used, with minor changes in position to accommodate the batter's power or bat-handling ability, the location of runners, or the number of outs. (For example, with a base runner on third with less than two out, the importance of fielders being able to throw quickly to home plate on a bunt is increased, and the infielders will play closer to home plate.) However, baseball has no equivalent of cricket's close-in fielders, because it is impractical to have fielders so close to the bat as they would have virtually no chance of latching onto a ball travelling so <b>fast.</b> <b>It</b> is possible to place a close-in fielder to catch a bunt, but this practice is almost never followed except in specialised circumstances such as a pitcher being forced to bat late in a game, with less than two outs and the opportunity to drive in a run. The team's best chance to score in such a situation may be to sacrifice bunt and may warrant the first or third baseman playing halfway up the line to cut off the run at home.|$|E

Mustaine had saved a number of old rehearsal tapes, which were used as the album's starting point.
