2500|$|By {{the time}} the smoke cleared at Franklin, the Army of Tennessee had {{suffered}} a cataclysmic defeat: it had lost 6,252 men {{in just a couple}} of hours, including six dead generals, six wounded, and one captured. [...] In addition, 55 of Hood's regimental commanders became casualtiesan appalling loss of mid-level commanders in an army that had lost many, already. [...] The 33rd Alabama lost two-thirds of its original 285 men; the remnant could no longer function as an independent fighting unit, so they were consolidated with survivors from the 16th and 45th Alabama regiments <b>in</b> a <b>single</b> <b>formation,</b> though the regimental designations were not rescinded.|$|R

50|$|The term itself, as used today, {{does not}} refer to a {{distinctive}} military unit or division (e.g., the Roman legion or the contemporary Western-type battalion), but to the general formation of an army's troops.

25|$|At {{the end of}} the Civil War, Augustus reorganized Roman {{military}} forces, discharging {{soldiers and}} disbanding legions. He retained 28 legions, distributed through the provinces of the Empire. During the Principate, the tactical organization of the Army continued to evolve. The auxilia remained independent cohorts, and legionary troops often operated as groups of cohorts rather than as full legions. A new versatile type of unit, the cohortes equitatae, combining cavalry and legionaries <b>in</b> a <b>single</b> <b>formation</b> could be stationed at garrisons or outposts, could fight on their own as balanced small forces or could combine with other similar units as a larger legion-sized force. This increase in organizational flexibility over time helped ensure the long-term success of Roman military forces.|$|R

During the London shows of the tour, Beyoncé debuted a gold leotard covered in 70,000 Swarvoski crystals, designed by Julien Macdonald. The outfit also contained 24 carat gold embroidered components. Fishnet tights worn in accompaniment with the tour's outfits were hand dyed in crock pots {{in order to}} correctly match the varying skin tones of Beyoncé's dancers.

50|$|With the {{construction}} of the large super carriers of the Cold War era, the practice of operating each carrier <b>in</b> a <b>single</b> <b>formation</b> was revived. During the Cold War, the main role of the CVBG in case of conflict with the Soviet Union would have been to protect Atlantic supply routes between the United States and Europe, while the role of the Soviet Navy would have been to interrupt these sea lanes, a fundamentally easier task. Because the Soviet Union had no large carriers of its own, a situation of dueling aircraft carriers would have been unlikely. However, a primary mission of the Soviet Navy's attack submarines was to track every allied battle group and, on the outbreak of hostilities, sink the carriers. Understanding this threat, the CVBG expended enormous resources in its own anti-submarine warfare mission.|$|R

The alignment is independent of a thin GaAs cap layer on the QDs revealing its origin is due to local strain recognition. This enables nanometer-scale precise lateral and vertical site registration between the QDs and the In nanocrystals and arrays <b>in</b> a <b>single</b> self-organizing <b>formation</b> process. The plasmon resonance of the In nanocrystals overlaps with the high-energy side of the QD emission leading to clear modification of the QD emission spectrum...|$|R

We {{introduce the}} non-cooperative concept of stable sequences of coalitions, a general solution to sequential coalition formation games. The main results are i) {{the order of}} the agenda matters for the equilibrium outcome, ii) punishment strategies can support otherwise unstable coalition structures, in particular the phenomenon of “strange bedfellows ” can arise in the first round, and iii) a party which is median in all decisions is always better off in the sequential game than <b>in</b> a <b>single</b> coalition <b>formation</b> over two decisions, while the converse is not true...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{interest}} of molecular double core holes was predicted in 1986 by Cederbaum et al who showed that their spectroscopy {{can be more}} informative {{than that of the}} single core holes, especially when the holes are located at different sites in the molecule (Cederbaum et al J. Chem. Phys. 85 (1986) 6513). Their experimental study <b>in</b> <b>single</b> photon <b>formation</b> had to await 2009 - 2010 with progress in synchrotron sources and development of efficient multi-electron coincidence experiments based on a magnetic bottle time of flight spectrometer. At the same time the advent of X-rays Free Electron Lasers opened the possibilty to create them in a two-photon process, and motivated new theoretical studies of their properties. We will illustrate here with a few examples, the progress done recently in the field, including formation of double core holes by double core photoionization, their spectroscopy and decay paths, and the related process of simultaneous core ionization and core excitation...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAerodynamics is a {{critical}} factor in the performance of cyclists, with drag being the dominant resistive force at racing speeds. Many cycling events involve athletes riding in close proximity. Previous studies have shown that flow interactions result in significant drag reductions for tandem cyclists, inline parallel to the flow [1 – 5]. However, the flow mechanisms associated with these changes have not been well characterised to date. This paper reports the results of wake surveys of an athlete <b>in</b> <b>single</b> and tandem <b>formations</b> <b>in</b> the Monash Wind Tunnel. Flow measurements were phase averaged over segments of the crank cycle to investigate the dynamic evolution of the wake of a pedalling cyclist. Results show that the dominant hip vortices previously identified {{in the wake of a}} single cyclist remain dominant in the trailing cyclist wake, with minimal reduction in vorticity. Wake profiles indicate the large drag saving experienced by a trailing cyclist are not due to disruption of the wake vortices or significant streamwise momentum recovery...|$|R
5000|$|What {{to make of}} the {{replacement}} of the other halfback from the top illustration by the fullback in the bottom one? Well, if the wingback were playing in a true wingback position but named halfback, then the other [...] "halfback" [...] would be playing deeper and thus deserve the name fullback. Another justification is that the player positioned as the left halfback in the top illustration tends to have the fullback characteristics described above. But rather than call the faster, lighter back behind (and in this formation, to the left of) him a halfback and so contradict the distance-back-determines-the-name principle (and rather than add rugby's three-quarters back), we call that player [...] "tailback"—the tail of the formation, farther back than the fullback. Even when two players positioned to take a thrown snap <b>in</b> a <b>single</b> wing <b>formation</b> are level with each other (i.e. at equal depth), the faster one (usually playing weak side) is often called the tailback and the more massive one the fullback.|$|R

Single-, double- and triple-mutant Vp 1 at Cys 9, Cys 104 and Cys 207 continued to localize to the nuclei of transfected CV- 1 cells and to bind DNA, but showed a range of abilities to form plaques. Only mutants containing the Cys 9 !Ser change showed defects <b>in</b> plaque <b>formation.</b> <b>Single</b> mutants at Cys 9 formed small plaques; mutants at Cys 9104, Cys 9207 and Cys 9104207 formed no plaques.

40|$|Macroscopic growths at {{geographically}} separated acid mine drainages (AMDs) exhibit distinct populations. Yet, local heterogeneities {{are poorly}} understood. To gain novel mechanistic insights into this, we used OMICs tools to profile microbial populations coexisting <b>in</b> a <b>single</b> pyrite gallery AMD (pH ~ 2) in three distinct compartments: two from a stratified streamer (uppermost oxic and lowermost anoxic sediment-attached strata) {{and one from}} a submerged anoxic non-stratified mat biofilm. The communities colonising pyrite {{and those in the}} mature formations appear to be populated by the greatest diversity of bacteria and archaea (including â��ARMANâ�� (archaeal Richmond Mine acidophilic nano-organisms) -related), as compared with the known AMD, with ~ 44. 9 % unclassified sequences. We propose that the thick polymeric matrix may provide a safety shield against the prevailing extreme condition and also a massive carbon source, enabling non-typical acidophiles to develop more easily. Only 1 of 39 species were shared, suggesting a high metabolic heterogeneity in local microenvironments, defined by the O 2 concentration, spatial location and biofilm architecture. The suboxic mats, compositionally most similar to each other, are more diverse and active for S, CO 2, CH 4, fatty acid and lipopolysaccharide metabolism. The oxic stratum of the streamer, displaying a higher diversity of the so-called â��ARMANâ��-related Euryarchaeota, shows a higher expression level of proteins involved in signal transduction, cell growth and N, H 2, Fe, aromatic amino acids, sphingolipid and peptidoglycan metabolism. Our study is the first to highlight profound taxonomic and functional shifts <b>in</b> <b>single</b> AMD <b>formations,</b> as well as new microbial species and the importance of H 2 in acidic suboxic macroscopic growths...|$|R

40|$|Aims The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the antimicrobial efficacy of five different proteases belonging to two different families on Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis strains. Methods and Results We used three serine proteases and two metalloproteases <b>in</b> <b>single</b> species biofilm <b>formation</b> assays and in human cell invasion processes. Following each protease incubation with bacterial cells, surface protein patterns were analysed by SDS-PAGE and zymography. Some differently expressed proteins were identified by mass spectrometry. Conclusions The effect of tested proteases on biofilm formation was not related to the protease category but was strain-dependent and was related to the biofilm formation capacity of each staphylococcal strain. Some proteases showed a nonspecific and indiscriminate effect on surface proteins, while others induced a discrete and reproducible action on protein profiles. Significance and Impact of the Study The inhibition of the surface-related virulence factors is a promising avenue to overcome persistent infections caused by bacterial biofilms. To this end, we show here that proteases, in particular the metalloprotease serratiopeptidase, can interfere with adhesion and invasion of eukaryotic cells and biofilm formation in staphylococci and their use could represent a viable treatment for the development of novel combination therapies...|$|R

3000|$|A {{computational}} dynamical analysis at {{the individual}} neuron level, {{such as the one}} presented in the previous section, is too complicated to perform for any realistic population size; a coarse-grained, population-level dynamical description and analysis become not only preferred, but necessary. Instead of keeping track of the state of every single neuron, we need to keep only a few collective descriptors of these states; yet, since the neurons are not homogeneous in their synaptic dynamics, a few moments of the distribution of the states are not sufficient: We need to not only know what the average and standard deviation of the states are, we also need to know which neurons (e.g. the low-τ or the high-τ ones) have low or high state values. In this joint distribution of neuron identities and neuron states, the marginal distribution of neuron states is not informative enough. That is why we turn to PC coefficients quantifying the correlation between the neuron identities and the neuron states. As was observed <b>in</b> the <b>single</b> cluster <b>formation</b> <b>in</b> a few different networks of oscillators [24, 27 – 29], a similar type of correlation between the dynamical variables ([...] [...]...|$|R
50|$|The central cubic parsec around Sagittarius A* {{contains}} around 10 million stars. Although most of {{them are}} old red giant stars, the Galactic Center is also rich in massive stars. More than 100 OB and Wolf-Rayet stars have been identified there so far. They seem to have all been formed <b>in</b> a <b>single</b> star <b>formation</b> event a few million years ago. The existence of these relatively young stars was a surprise to experts, who expected the tidal forces from the central black hole to prevent their formation. This paradox of youth is even stronger for stars that are on very tight orbits around Sagittarius A*, such as S2 and S0-102. The scenarios invoked to explain this formation involve either star formation in a massive star cluster offset from the Galactic Center that would have migrated to its current location once formed, or star formation within a massive, compact gas accretion disk around the central black-hole. Most of these 100 young, massive stars seem to be concentrated within one or two disks, rather than randomly distributed within the central parsec. This observation however does not allow definite conclusions to be drawn at this point.|$|R
40|$|Mining is {{an arduous}} job and involve risk at each working stage. In {{open cast mining}} method, {{since it is the}} main focus as it {{contributes}} major portion of production, stability of the slope is of utmost importance. To avoid a slope from failure, working is to be carried out in accordance with the guidelines and safety standards. The factor of safety of the working slope has to be calculated and monitored from time to time so that safe working environment can be created and the slope can be avoided from failure. Factor of safety often calculated by the traditional deterministic analysis methods cannot exactly represent the stability of the slope. Case of Rajpardi Lignite Mine (GMDC) has been considered for this project. The working benches with height 3 m are very steep with individual bench slope angle varying from 80 o to almost 90 o. A total of 50 benches has been considered <b>in</b> a <b>single</b> <b>formation</b> for calculation of factor of safety with varying overall slope angle. The probability of failure of slope increases by increasing the overall slope angle of the working bench. A benchmark safety factor of 1. 20 was set to consider the working conditions to be safe. Beyond this safety factor, working would be difficult and risky and probability of failure will be more. SURPAC software was used to make the solid and block model. Volume calculation, reserve estimation and average grade calculation was done using the borehole data of the mine. Followed by SURPAC, FLAC/Slope is used for calculation of factor of safety and numerical modelling of the slope. A total of five sections were considered to calculate the factor of safety with varying rock type. The sections were incorporated into FLAC/Slope from the block model that was made in SURPAC. Sections with ball clay was found to be less stable as compared to sections without ball clay...|$|R
