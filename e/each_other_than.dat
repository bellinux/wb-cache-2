5|$|A limited genetic {{sampling}} of species in a 1996 study by Annette Kretzer and colleagues showed Suillus bovinus {{was related to}} a lineage that diverged to S.punctipes, S.variegatus and S.tomentosus. A 2001 study found it was not closely related to other European species, and that all populations tested were more closer to <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> any other and hence it was a cohesive species.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{relationships}} of millipede orders are still the subject of debate, the class Diplopoda {{as a whole is}} considered a monophyletic group of arthropods: all millipedes are more closely related to <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> to any other arthropods. Diplopoda is a class within of the arthropod subphylum Myriapoda, the myriapods, which includes centipedes (class Chilopoda) as well as the lesser-known pauropods (class Pauropoda) and symphylans (class Symphyla). Within myriapods, the closest relatives or sister group of millipedes has long been considered the pauropods, which also have a collum and diplosegments.|$|E
5|$|Balaenidae {{consists}} of two genera: Eubalaena (right whales) and Balaena (the bowhead whale, B. mysticetus). Balaenidae was thought to have consisted of only one genus until studies done through the early 2000s reported that bowhead whales and right whales are morphologically (different skull shape) and phylogenically different. According to a study done by H. C. Rosenbaum (of the American Museum of Natural History) and colleagues, the North Pacific (E. japonica) and Southern right (E. australis) whales are {{more closely related to}} <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> to the North Atlantic right whale (E. glacialis).|$|E

They concluded that only three hypotheses of aetosaur relationships from previous studies were still true: that Aetosaurus is the most basal aetosaur, that Aetosauroides is the sister taxon of Stagonolepis robertsoni, and that Longosuchus and Desmatosuchus are more closely related to <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> either is to Neoaetosauroides. They also went on to correct the trees from all previous analyses.|$|E

5|$|Analyses since 2001 have {{concluded}} that Eumetazoa (more complex than sponges) are {{more closely related to}} particular groups of sponges than {{to the rest of the}} sponges. Such conclusions imply that sponges are not monophyletic, because the last common ancestor of all sponges would also be a direct ancestor of the Eumetazoa, which are not sponges. A study in 2001 based on comparisons of ribosome DNA concluded that the most fundamental division within sponges was between glass sponges and the rest, and that Eumetazoa are more closely related to calcareous sponges, those with calcium carbonate spicules, than to other types of sponge. In 2007 one analysis based on comparisons of RNA and another based mainly on comparison of spicules concluded that demosponges and glass sponges are more closely related to <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> either is to calcareous sponges, which in turn are more closely related to Eumetazoa.|$|E
5|$|As of 2010 {{there are}} no indisputable body fossils of phoronids. There is good {{evidence}} that phoronids created trace fossils found in the Silurian, Devonian, Permian, Jurassic and Cretaceous periods, and possibly in the Ordovician and Triassic. Phoronids, brachiopods and bryozoans (ectoprocts) have collectively been called lophophorates, because all use lophophores to feed. From about the 1940s to the 1990s, family trees based on embryological and morphological features placed lophophorates among or as a sister group to the deuterostomes, a super-phylum which includes chordates and echinoderms. While a minority adhere to this view, most researchers now regard phoronids {{as members of the}} protostome super-phylum Lophotrochozoa. Although analysts using molecular phylogeny are confident that members of Lophotrochozoa are more closely related to <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> of non-members, the relationships between members are mostly unclear. Some analyses regard phoronids and brachiopods as sister-groups, while others place phoronids as a sub-group within brachiopoda.|$|E
5|$|Extant East Asian {{starling}}s, {{such as the}} Bali myna (Leucopsar rothschildi) and the {{white-headed starling}} (Sturnia erythropygia), have similarities with these extinct species in colouration and other features. As the Rodrigues and Mauritius starlings {{seem to be more}} closely related to <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> to the hoopoe starling, which appears to be closer to Southeast Asian starlings, there may have been two separate colonisations of starlings in the Mascarenes from Asia, with the hoopoe starling being the latest arrival. Apart from Madagascar, the Mascarenes were the only islands in the south-west Indian Ocean that contained native starlings. This is probably due to the isolation, varied topography and vegetation of these islands.|$|E

5|$|In 2003, Philip J. Currie, {{benefiting from}} much more {{extensive}} finds {{and a general}} increase in anatomical knowledge of theropods, compared several tyrannosaurid skulls {{and came to the}} conclusion that the two species are more distinct than previously thought. The decision to use one or two genera is rather arbitrary, as the two species are sister taxa, more closely related to <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> to any other species. Recognizing this, Currie nevertheless recommended that Albertosaurus and Gorgosaurus be retained as separate genera, as he concluded that they were no more similar than Daspletosaurus and Tyrannosaurus, which are almost always separated. In addition, several albertosaurine specimens have been recovered from Alaska and New Mexico, and Currie suggested that the Albertosaurus-Gorgosaurus situation may be clarified once these are described fully. Most authors have followed Currie's recommendation, but some have not.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, in 1999, Sharon Jansa {{and colleagues}} {{published}} a molecular phylogenetic {{study of the}} Nesomyinae, the native Malagasy rodents, using the mitochondrial gene cytochrome b. Their results suggested that the current definitions of Eliurus and Voalavo may not be correct, because they found that northern voalavo and Grandidier's tufted-tailed rat are {{more closely related to}} <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> to the remaining species of Eliurus. However, the DNA of Petter's tufted-tailed rat, a possible close relative of northern voalavo, could not be sampled, so Jansa and colleagues recommended further evaluation of the problem. According to a 2003 report, data from nuclear genes also support the relationship between northern voalavo and Grandidier's tufted-tailed rat, but Petter's tufted-tailed rat remains genetically unstudied and the taxonomic issue has not been resolved.|$|E

It made them vulnerable to surprise attacks by Bf 109s and Bf 110s. Even if the British fighters reached the bombers without interception, the chaos of modern aerial combat {{made it impossible to}} concentrate attacks with large, rigid formations. Pilots were also forced into paying far too much respect to the bomber's defensive capabilities. Attacks were broken off far too early and caused little damage to bombers. These tactical failures were evident during the battles in Belgium and France. Moreover, rushed training with pilots who were barely able to use the old tactical methods meant that airmen could not cope with much needed radical changes.|$|E
5|$|The {{three species}} of the {{subgenus}} Zanda have been variously considered as two, then as a single species for many years. In a 1979 paper, Australian ornithologist Denis Saunders highlighted the similarity between the short-billed and the southern race xanthanotus of the yellow-tailed and treated them as a single species with the long-billed as a distinct species. He proposed that Western Australia had been colonised on two separate occasions, once by a common ancestor of all three forms (which became the long-billed black cockatoo), and later by what has become the short-billed black cockatoo. However, an analysis of protein allozymes published in 1984 revealed the two Western Australian forms to be {{more closely related to}} <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> to the yellow-tailed, and the consensus since then has been to treat them as three separate species.|$|E
5|$|Woese {{used his}} new rRNA {{comparison}} method to categorize and contrast different organisms.

These methanogens were much more similar to <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> they were to other organisms sequenced, leading Woese to propose the new domain of Archaea. His experiments showed that the Archaea were more similar to eukaryotes than prokaryotes, even though they were more similar to prokaryotes in structure. This led to the conclusion that Archaea and Eukarya shared a more recent common ancestor than Eukarya and Bacteria in general. The development of the nucleus occurred after the split between Bacteria and this common ancestor. Although Archaea are prokaryotic, they are more closely related to Eukarya and thus cannot be placed within either the Bacteria or Eukarya domains.|$|E
