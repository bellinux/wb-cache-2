5|$|Apart from {{permanent}} garrisons at Berwick, Calais, and Carlisle, England's {{standing army}} numbered {{only a few}} hundred men. This was increased only slightly by Henry. Henry's invasion force of 1513, some 30,000 men, was composed of billmen and longbowmen, {{at a time when the}} other European nations were moving to <b>hand</b> <b>guns</b> and pikemen. The difference in capability was at this stage not significant, however, and Henry's forces had new armour and weaponry. They were also supported by battlefield artillery and the war wagon, relatively new innovations, and several large and expensive siege guns. The invasion force of 1544 was similarly well-equipped and organised, although command on the battlefield was laid with the dukes of Suffolk and Norfolk, which in the case of the latter produced disastrous results at Montreuil.|$|E

25|$|In {{the seventeenth}} and eighteenth centuries the Turco-Persian empires {{weakened}} by the Europeans' discovery of a sea route to India, and introduction of <b>hand</b> <b>guns,</b> which gave the horsemen of the pastoral societies greater fighting capability. In India, the Mughal Empire decayed into warring states. Only Ottoman Turkey survived into the twentieth century. The European powers encroached into the Turco-Persian region, contributing to the political fragmentation of the region.

25|$|Soviet {{defector}} Vasili Mitrokhin alleged in the 1990s {{that the}} Goulding leadership sought, in 1969, a small quantity of arms (roughly 70 rifles, {{along with some}} <b>hand</b> <b>guns</b> and explosives) from the KGB. The request was approved and the weapons reportedly arrived in Ireland in 1972, although {{this has not been}} independently verified. On the whole, the OIRA had a more restricted level of activity than the Provisionals. Unlike the Provisionals, it did not establish de facto control over large Catholic areas of Belfast and Derry and its use of force was more defensive. However it retained a strong presence in certain localities, notably the Lower Falls Road, Andersonstown, Turf Lodge and the Markets areas of Belfast, along with a strong presence in Derry (particularly Free Derry in the Bogside area) as well as Newry and South County Down.|$|E

500|$|The {{regiment}} {{was armed}} by December 15, 1861. Most of the regiment {{was equipped with}} horse pistols, a poor weaponry choice for a cavalry unit. Horse pistols were 58-caliber <b>hand</b> <b>guns</b> that fired a single shot. They were typically carried in pairs—one in each holster {{on the sides of}} the horse.

This British import fired a [...]577-caliber projectile, and was popular with both sides at the beginning of the war. Like the horse pistol, it needed to be reloaded after firing a single shot. Both weapons were difficult for a rider to reload while mounted—and had significant recoils. The men were also issued sabers, which were good quality, but not always useful in the mountainous terrain of western Virginia.|$|E

500|$|On {{the night}} of August 6, Averell's cavalry {{cautiously}} moved toward the Confederate camps. Using an advance guard disguised as Confederate soldiers, Averell's cavalry quietly captured all of the Confederate pickets that separated the Union force from the sleeping Confederates. On the early morning of August 7, Averell's first brigade attacked the Confederate brigade camped {{on the north side}} of the river. Many of these rebels were sleeping and did not have their horses saddled. In some cases, entire Confederate regiments simply tried to run away, leaving behind weapons and loot taken from Chambersburg. Although the Confederates attempted to offer resistance on the south side of the river that separated the two Confederate camps, many of those men were also caught unprepared. Averell added his second brigade to the fight, and it charged across the river. The disorganized Confederate force was no match for Averell's cavalry, which was armed with sabers, 6-shot revolvers (<b>hand</b> <b>guns)</b> and 7-shot repeating rifles. Over 400 men were either killed or captured, while the Union force lost less than 50. Averell's victory inflicted permanent damage on the Confederate cavalry, and it was never again the dominant force it once was in the Shenandoah Valley.|$|E

The Orne canal formed its northern boundary and the Casino strong point was to the south. It was surrounded by barbed wire and had three machine gun posts. Two of the posts faced where the canal joined {{the sea and the}} third faced up the canal towards the port. To the west of the battery were the houses of the town and the port area of Ouistreham. The order of march was: CTroop to deal with any opposition on route, DTroop [...] who were to force an entrance into the battery, ATroop to [...] provide covering fire for the assaulting troops. In the assault ETroop would take the left <b>hand</b> <b>guns,</b> and FTroop the right. Bringing up the rear was the headquarters and the heavy weapons troop. The heavy weapons troop set up a fire base to support both the French and British attacks if needed. Progress along the road was rapid with only intermittent artillery fire slowing them down. As they advanced, a tank from the 13th/18th Royal Hussars joined them, just in time to engage German snipers who had started shooting at E and F Troops.|$|E

2500|$|The rise in {{testosterone}} levels during competition predicted aggression in males {{but not in}} females. Subjects who interacted with <b>hand</b> <b>guns</b> and an experimental game showed rise in testosterone and aggression. Natural selection might have evolved males {{to be more sensitive}} to competitive and status challenge situations and that the interacting roles of testosterone are the essential ingredient for aggressive behaviour in these situations. Testosterone produces aggression by activating subcortical areas in the brain, which may also be inhibited or suppressed by social norms or familial situations while still manifesting in diverse intensities and ways through thoughts, anger, verbal aggression, competition, dominance and to physical violence. [...] Testosterone mediates attraction to cruel and violent cues in men by promoting extended viewing of violent stimuli. Testosterone specific structural brain characteristic can predict aggressive behaviour in individuals.|$|E
2500|$|Firearms seem to {{have been}} known in Japan around 1270 as proto-cannons invented in China, which the Japanese called teppō (鉄砲 lit. [...] "iron cannon"). Gunpowder {{weaponry}} exchange between China and Japan was slow and {{only a small number of}} <b>hand</b> <b>guns</b> ever reached Japan. The first recorded appearance of the cannon in Japan was in 1510 when a Buddhist priest presented Hōjō Ujitsuna with a teppō iron cannon he acquired during his travels in China. However gunpowder weapons saw very little use in Japan until Portuguese firearms were introduced in 1543. During the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592-1598), the forces of Toyotomi Hideyoshi effectively utilized matchlock firearms against the Korean forces of Joseon, although they would ultimately be defeated and forced to withdraw from the Korean peninsula.|$|E
2500|$|Because the dry {{powdered}} ingredients must {{be mixed}} and bonded together for extrusion and cutting into grains {{to maintain the}} blend, size reduction and mixing is done while the ingredients are damp, usually with water. After 1800, instead of forming grains by hand or with sieves, the damp mill-cake was pressed in molds to increase its density and extract the liquid, forming press-cake. The pressing took varying amounts of time, depending on conditions such as atmospheric humidity. [...] The hard, dense product was broken again into tiny pieces, which were separated with sieves to produce a uniform product for each purpose: coarse powders for cannons, finer grained powders for muskets, and the finest for small <b>hand</b> <b>guns</b> and priming. Inappropriately fine-grained powder often caused cannons to burst before the projectile could move down the barrel, due to the high initial spike in pressure. Mammoth powder with large grains, made for Rodman's 15-inch cannon, reduced the pressure to only 20 percent as high as ordinary cannon powder would have produced.|$|E

While the Resistance had about twenty-thousand fighters, they had only sixty <b>hand</b> <b>guns,</b> a few machine guns, and no heavy weapons. [...] Nonetheless, on the morning of August 20, a small group of Resistance fighters, led by Léo Hamon, walked into the office of Marcel Flouret, the new Prefect of Paris at the Hôtel de Ville and demanded that he hand over the building. The Prefect asked to see his papers and Hamon replied, [...] "We've gotten out of the habit of that kind of thing." [...] Hamon placed the Prefect and the member of the Municipal Council under arrest, and occupied the building. Rol-Tanguy commanded the uprising from a bunker twenty-six meters beneath the statue of the Lion de Belfort, Place Denfert-Rochereau, which communicated with the catacombs. Parisians cut down trees and tore up paving stones to build barricades. Scattered sniping and street fighting broke out between the Germans, the Milice and the Resistance; prisoners were executed on both sides. The Resistance took weapons from fallen Germans, and even captured trucks and even tanks, but neither side had enough military power to defeat the other.|$|E
