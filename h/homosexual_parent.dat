40|$|The {{problematic}} {{nature of}} the right of a <b>homosexual</b> <b>parent</b> to vest custody over a child is biarticulated: {{the nature and extent of}} custody disputes as well as the issues of discrimination based on sexual orientation are relevant. Homosexual orientation is emotional and controversial, all the more when it is accompanied by custody disputes. In this context the constitutional protection given to human rights and the constitutional provisions containing constitutional values are of paramount importance. The contents of these provisions have direct consequences for custody disputes and homosexual parenthood. In the pre-constitutional dispensation, the court gave judgement in Van Rooyen v Van Rooyen 1994 2 SA 325 (W) on the awarding of access rights to a <b>homosexual</b> <b>parent.</b> With regard to the provisions of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa 108 of 1996 and trends in relevant foreign law, the decision in the Van Rooyen case is subjected to criticism. Since the commencement of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa 200 of 1993, no South African court has given judgement on this issue. The aim of this contribution is to set out an autochthonous frame of reference considering the provisions of the Constitution, case law and comparative foreign law in an attempt to resolve the issue under discussion...|$|E

40|$|The thesis aims {{to study}} how rainbows {{families}} are being treated by the authorities and the surroundings. It focuses on how <b>homosexual</b> <b>parents</b> are met in society. Although, homosexuals have {{the legal right to}} have a family and enter into marriage, the social norms are still far behind and rainbows families are seen as “the others” and abnormal.   Earlier researches have been studding how the authorities still assumes that every family are living in a heterosexual family constellation. By this assumption they exclude families who are not living in a heterosexual family. To find out what kind of experiences the <b>homosexual</b> <b>parents</b> have we have interviewed eight <b>homosexual</b> <b>parents.</b> Which four were females and four were males. The result of this thesis shows that most of the <b>homosexual</b> <b>parents</b> are not experience that they are treated bad or in any other way different then heterosexual parents. It also shows that people in the nearest surroundings to the homosexual family are really glad that the gay couple have a family. At the same time the <b>homosexual</b> <b>parents</b> are saying that there will always be people who think it’s abnormal. But as long as the nearest families and friends find it alright they are not paying too much energy of those who thinks it’s wrong. The majority of gay males explain that the hardest part in building a family is that they are males; it’s harder to be accepted as two fathers. One conclusion is not that homosexuals are being treated different; it’s more a question of gender. Especially when the children are young, a lot of males feels that the always have to state themselves, not as a gay parents but as two males who is having infants...|$|R

40|$|In 1994, {{national}} media {{attention focused on}} the Virginia case Bottoms v. Bottoms, in which Kay Bottoms successfully fought to terminate her lesbian daughter Sharon 2 ̆ 7 s custody of Sharon 2 ̆ 7 s son, Tyler. Although the Court of Appeals of Virginia reversed the trial court 2 ̆ 7 s award of custody to Kay Bottoms, the Supreme Court of Virginia reversed the appellate court and returned custody to Tyler 2 ̆ 7 s grandmother. Sharon then sought modification of the visitation and custody order, but the trial court denied her petition and instead reduced and further restricted her visitation rights. In Bottoms III, the Court of Appeals of Virginia reversed the trial court 2 ̆ 7 s decision and remanded for reconsideration. This Comment uses the Bottoms case {{as a framework for}} analyzing state courts 2 ̆ 7 approaches to determining homosexual parents 2 ̆ 7 custody and visitation rights. Two approaches have emerged: the traditionalist approach, under which a trial court may consider a parent 2 ̆ 7 s homosexuality as evidence of moral unfitness inherently contrary to {{the best interests of the}} child, and the nexus approach, under which a <b>homosexual</b> <b>parent</b> 2 ̆ 7 s conduct, rather than status, is the pertinent consideration. The Comment concludes with a recommendation that courts adopt the conduct-focused nexus approach in order to afford homosexual parents a genuine opportunity to receive objective judicial consideration in custody and visitation contexts...|$|E
40|$|In this study, 15 {{teenagers}} and 16 young adults related their experiences of having {{one or two}} homosexual parents. All of these young informants were born in a heterosexual relationship where the parents later separated and then they lived in "new" or "post-nuclear" families. The analysis shows considerable variation in the children's and adolescents' perceptions and experiences of living with homosexual or bisexual parents. One important finding {{of the study is}} that the parent's homosexuality becomes a highly prominent theme in the interviews where the parent/child relationship is also described as inadequate. This was found in a few cases in the study where the parent's homosexuality is presented as closely associated with negatively charged experiences. In the remaining interviews, parent/child relationships are presented as good and meaningful. In those cases, homosexuality is accorded less prominence in the children's life stories. Here emerge two different ways of telling about the parent's homosexuality that show how experiences of life with a <b>homosexual</b> <b>parent</b> can vary. In the one case, homosexuality is described as something self-evident that certainly distinguishes the family, but not in a negative sense. Despite an array of differences in living conditions, homosexuality is described as a natural and accepted element of family life. Homosexuality in these cases is not a point of conflict for the informant. In the other case, homosexuality is described as a problem in relation to the informant's friends and peers. The difficulties they describe do not however encompass the parent as a person; instead, the parental relationship is  presented as significant. This attitude appears to be a consequence of the social, psychological, and cultural expectations that characterize the teenage years for some adolescents. A point of conflict emerges here concerning on the one hand loyalty to the parent and the adolescents' familiarity with homosexuality, {{and on the other hand}} the adolescents'participation in peer groups in which heterosexist views are expressed. The informants use various strategies to manage this conflict, which seems to characterize early adolescence since the endeavors to conceal are eventually transformed into a more accepting attitude as the adolescents get older. It is similar to the process that relatives of homosexuals go through when a son, daughter, brother, or sister "comes out" and the relative must manage kinship and concern on the one hand and heterosexist value judgments on the other...|$|E

In this paper, we examine for the first time whether schools are more hesitant about giving feedback to <b>homosexual</b> <b>parents</b> during children's pre-registration period in Catalonia (Spain). To do so, we designed a correspondence experiment to be conducted in schools. We created three types of fictitious couples-one heterosexual, one gay, and one lesbian-and sent emails to schools in which the couples' sexual orientation was explicit. Our results show that gay couples had a significantly lower (22 percentage points) call-back probability than heterosexual couples.
