50|$|Wheel sensors {{along the}} tracks feel for flat {{spots on the}} train's wheels. Any flat wheel that becomes too {{dangerous}} to travel on (a big flat spot on the train wheel) will be counted as a defect. Typically, these systems utilise accelerometers, strain gauges, fibre optic methods, or the very latest (WIPD) wheel impact phase detector. A wheel <b>impact</b> <b>load</b> detector (WILD) measures impacts, but does not normalise these impact measurements against anything: simply the impact reading. They do not attempt to cater for differences in sprung mass, as they are measuring wheel defect impact rather than <b>impact</b> <b>load.</b> Therefore, the same wheel defect will register a much larger impact when a wagon is loaded, versus when it is empty.A wheel condition monitoring detector monitors {{the condition of the}} wheel independent of sprung mass - independent of load. They do this by subtracting the wheel mass to get the normalised impact value. These systems are therefore typically better at detecting smaller defects with greater resolution.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{treats the}} crush {{behaviour}} and energy absorption response of foam-filled conical tubes subjected to oblique <b>impact</b> <b>loading.</b> Dynamic computer simulation techniques validated by experimental testing {{are used to}} carry out a parametric study of such devices. The study aims at quantifying the energy absorption of empty and foam-filled conical tubes under oblique <b>impact</b> <b>loading,</b> for variations in the load angle and geometry parameters of the tube. It is evident that foam-filled conical tubes are preferable as impact energy absorbers due to their ability to withstand oblique <b>impact</b> <b>loads</b> as effectively as axial <b>impact</b> <b>loads.</b> Furthermore, it is found that the energy absorption capacity of filled tubes is better maintained compared to that of empty tubes as the load orientation increases. The primary outcome of this study is design information for the use of foam-filled conical tubes as energy absorbers where oblique <b>impact</b> <b>loading</b> is expected...|$|R

Here, impact velocity and with/without crack repairing were taken as variable. The results obtained from this study are as follows; 1) static load carrying capacity of the RC beams damaged due to <b>impact</b> <b>loading</b> previously is {{higher than that of}} virgin one due to strain hardening effects of the rebar, 2) frequency and amplitude of the impact response of the RC beams at the second <b>impact</b> <b>loading</b> are almost the same and both initial load carrying capacity and flexural stiffness are ensured regardless with/without crack repairing after the first <b>impact</b> <b>loading,</b> 3) crack repairing is useful to keep concrete blocks from falling and for cracks to be dispersed...|$|R
40|$|The chronic {{exposure}} of astronauts to microgravity results in structural degradation of their lower limb bones. Currently, no effective exercise countermeasure exists. On Earth, the <b>impact</b> <b>loading</b> that occurs with regular locomotion {{is associated with}} the maintenance of bone’s structural integrity, but <b>impact</b> <b>loads</b> are rarely experienced in space. Accurately mimicking Earth-like <b>impact</b> <b>loads</b> in a reduced-gravity environment should help to reduce the degradation of bone caused by weightlessness. We previously showed that running with externally applied horizontal forces (AHF) in the anterior direction qualitatively simulates the high-impact loading associated with downhill running on Earth. We hypothesized that running with AHF at simulated reduced gravity would produce <b>impact</b> <b>loads</b> equal to or greater than values experienced during normal running at Earth gravity. With an AHF of 20 % of gravity-specific body weight at all gravity levels, impact force peaks increased 74 %, average <b>impact</b> <b>loading</b> rates increased 46 %, and maximum <b>impact</b> <b>loading</b> rates increased 89 % compared to running without any AHF. In contrast, AHF did not substantially affect active force peaks. Duty factor and stride frequency decreased modestly with AHF at all gravity levels. We found that running with an AHF in simulated reduced gravity produced <b>impact</b> <b>loads</b> equal to or greater than those experienced at Earth gravity. An appropriate AHF could easily augment existing partial gravity treadmill running exercise countermeasures used durin...|$|R
5000|$|Brinelling is a {{material}} surface failure caused by Hertz contact stress that exceeds the material limit. It usually occurs {{in situations where}} a significant load force is distributed over a relatively small surface area. Brinelling typically results from a heavy or repeated <b>impact</b> <b>load,</b> either while stopped or during rotation, though {{it can also be}} caused by just one application of a force greater than the material limit.|$|E
50|$|Impact {{is a very}} {{important}} phenomenon in governing the life of a structure. For example, {{in the case of an}} aircraft, impact can take place by a bird hitting a plane while it is cruising, or during take off and landing the aircraft may be struck by debris that is present on the runway, and as well as other causes. It must also be calculated for roads if speed breakers are present, in bridge construction where vehicles punch an <b>impact</b> <b>load,</b> etc.|$|E
50|$|Mostly, for {{measurement}} of temperature at tip of moving crack mode-I of fracture is being preferred. But maximum temperatures are expected for other two modes-(I, II)of fracture due large deformations with shear banding, particularly with high confining pressure, where impact generated shear bands {{is due to}} the <b>impact</b> <b>load</b> itself. According to a study by Zhou et al. and Rosakis et al.(1997) on impact produced shear bands of mode-II gives a result of temperature rises of over 1650 K for C-300 steel. These temperatures are being measured by special purpose high precision thermocouple.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{estimate}} the <b>impact</b> <b>loads</b> delivered to the housing of a hydraulic breaker quantitatively. Striking forces caused vibrations in the equipment housing, which were experimentally measured, and frequency response functions were also found through modal impact experiments. Transfer path analysis (TPA) method of the data quantified the <b>impact</b> <b>loads</b> delivered to the housing. TPA method can analyze the relationship between the vibration energy and the transfer path of an excitation source and so explore the way in which vibrations on each path contribute to the entire vibration profile. The <b>impact</b> <b>loads</b> of each part derived by TPA method were compared with the <b>impact</b> <b>loads</b> in the chisel derived from strain gauge measurements of the striking energy. This comparison validated the TPA approach. This study describes the basic concepts and components of TPA method and also reviews its applicability to mechanical equipment that experiences impact vibrations and <b>impact</b> <b>loads...</b>|$|R
40|$|Background/purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effects of cyclic <b>impact</b> <b>loading</b> on shear bond strengths of three different luting cements to zirconia. Materials and methods: The following cements were used in this study for bonding two zirconia blocks that were tribochemically silica-coated with the Rocatec system: Super Bond C&B (SB); Panavia Fluoro Cement (PF); and Fuji Luting (FL). Specimens were subsequently subjected to three storage conditions: 106 compressive cyclic <b>impact</b> <b>loading</b> (CL), 106 shear cyclic <b>impact</b> <b>loading</b> (SL), and no cyclic <b>impact</b> <b>loading</b> (Control) in distilled water at 37  °C with a mechanical fatigue testing device. Shear bond strength tests were performed with a universal testing machine. Results: Bond strengths of PF+Control (63. 6 ± 2. 4  MPa) and PF+CL (57. 2 ± 3. 8  MPa) were significantly higher than those with SB and FL. There was no significant difference between CL and SL (P> 0. 05) with SB and FL. The bond strength of the FL resin-modified glass ionomer cement was significantly lower than those with PF and SB. After applying tribochemical treatment, all specimens subjected to cyclic <b>impact</b> <b>loading</b> exhibited cohesive failure in the resin cement. Conclusions: After 106 compressive cyclic <b>impact</b> <b>loading,</b> the highest bond to zirconia was obtained with 10 -methacryloxydecyl-dihydrogenphosphate containing a luting system (Panavia Fluoro Cement). After applying tribochemical treatment to zirconia, all cements used in this study survived more than 106 shear or compressive cyclic <b>impact</b> <b>loading</b> at 10  kg...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental study on unsaturated soils. A designed test setup was {{used and the}} <b>impact</b> <b>loading</b> was applied with a drop hammer. The experimental {{results show that the}} soil properties, including water content, density, void ratio, and saturation, changed because of <b>impact</b> <b>loading,</b> and these variations of the soil properties affected the matrix suctions of the unsaturated soils. The impact hole depth increased with the increasing impact energy and gradually reached a critical value. The dynamic stress in soil increased with the increased <b>impact</b> <b>loading.</b> The results obtained in this work can be applied to optimize the effective reinforcement region of soils in the dynamic compaction construction...|$|R
50|$|A set of jars {{consisted}} of two interlocking links which could telescope. In 1880 they had a play of about 13 inches such that the upper link could be lifted 13 inches before the lower link was engaged. This engagement occurred when the cross-heads came together.Today, there are two primary types, hydraulic and mechanical jars. While their respective designs are quite different, their operation is similar. Energy is stored in the drillstring and suddenly released by the jar when it fires. Jars can be designed to strike up, down, or both. In the case of jarring up above a stuck bottomhole assembly, the driller slowly pulls up on the drillstring but the BHA does not move. Since {{the top of the}} drillstring is moving up, this means that the drillstring itself is stretching and storing energy. When the jars reach their firing point, they suddenly allow one section of the jar to move axially relative to a second, being pulled up rapidly {{in much the same way}} that one end of a stretched spring moves when released. After a few inches of movement, this moving section slams into a steel shoulder,imparting an <b>impact</b> <b>load.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The Watanabe {{classification}} of discoid lateral meniscus is: (A) Incomplete, (B) Complete, and C) Wrisberg-ligament variant [...] Normally, the meniscus {{is a thin}} crescent-shaped piece of cartilage that lies between the weight bearing joint surfaces of the femur and the tibia. It {{is attached to the}} lining of the knee joint along its periphery and serves to absorb {{about a third of the}} <b>impact</b> <b>load</b> that the joint cartilage surface sees and also provides some degree of stabilization for the knee. There are two menisci in the knee joint, the outside one being the lateral meniscus the inner one the medial meniscus. A discoid meniscus is a congenital anomaly of the knee found in 3% of the population (up to 15% in Asia). It typically affects the lateral meniscus and may be found bilaterally (20%). Instead of the narrow crescent shape, as seen in a normal meniscus above, a discoid meniscus is thickened, and has a fuller crescent shape. In addition, a discoid meniscus does not taper as much towards the center of the joint and is shaped like a disc. The thickness of the meniscus, its diminished vascular blood supply, and in some instances, weak capsular attachment, makes it more prone to tears compared to a normal meniscus. The anomaly in itself is asymptomatic; however, a tear of the meniscus can result in pain, swelling, and snapping of the affected knee. The orthopedic {{classification of}} discoid menisci includes: complete, incomplete or Wrisberg-ligament types as depicted here. Coverage of the lateral tibial plateau determines the designation of complete or incomplete. The Wrisberg-ligament type has an abnormal posterior attachment by attaching to part of the posterior cruciate ligament.|$|E

40|$|In {{real-world}} <b>impact</b> <b>loading</b> situations {{the structure}} could {{be subjected to}} both axial and off-axis loads. Tapered thin-walled rectangular tubes have been considered desirable impact energy absorbers due {{to their ability to}} withstand oblique <b>impact</b> <b>loads</b> as effectively as axial loads.

The aim {{of this paper is to}} compare the energy absorption response of straight and tapered thin-walled rectangular tubes under oblique <b>impact</b> <b>loading,</b> for variations in the <b>load</b> angle, <b>impact</b> velocity and tube dimensions. It is found that the mean load and energy absorption decrease significantly as the angle of applied load increases. Nevertheless, tapering a rectangular tube enhances its energy absorption capacity under oblique loading. The outcome of the study is design information for the use of straight and tapered thin-walled rectangular tubes as energy absorbers in applications where oblique <b>impact</b> <b>loading</b> is expected...|$|R

40|$|In this study, <b>impact</b> <b>loading</b> {{tests of}} six {{specimens}} were conducted using the falling weight <b>impact</b> <b>loading</b> machine {{in order to}} get the basic knowledge on the response characteristics of concrete-filled steel tubular (CFT) specimens. Although the maximum velocity of Tsunami might be estimated as 15 m/s in typical seashore, it may be thought that around 7 m/second is the maximum velocity of the flotsam in inland. The impact velocity of falling weight is proportional to the square root of the falling height of the weight, so that the maximum falling height in this test is determined as 2. 5 m corresponding to the velocity of 7 m/s. Another four specimens were also conducted under static condition which are the standard references to be compared with the specimens subjected to <b>impact</b> <b>loads.</b> The specimens are simply-supported beams, and the <b>impact</b> <b>loads</b> or static loads concentrically and vertically applies to the mid-span of the beams. The test specimens are circular and square CFT specimens and circular and square vacant steel tubular specimens.

30|$|Theoretical {{analysis}} and field monitoring show that lateral vibration has very important effect on casing wear in deep & ultra-deep well drilling. The wear mechanism of casing under impact-sliding work conditions {{has been investigated}} and many experiments have been completed with a newly developed full-scale casing wear test machine. Test results present that adhesion wear, contact fatigue, and grinding abrasion are the main wear mechanisms under impact-sliding test conditions. The friction coefficient and linear wear rate of the casing rise obviously {{with an increase in}} <b>impact</b> <b>load.</b> And the larger the <b>impact</b> <b>load,</b> the rougher the worn surface of the casing. The linear wear rate decreased slightly but the average friction coefficient increased slightly with an increase in impact frequency under an <b>impact</b> <b>load</b> of 2, 500 N. Both the linear wear rate of the casing and the average friction coefficient increased substantially with an increase in impact frequency under an <b>impact</b> <b>load</b> of 4, 000 N.

40|$|Experimental {{findings}} indicate that in-situ chondrocytes die readily following <b>impact</b> <b>loading,</b> but remain essentially unaffected at low (non-impact) strain rates. This study was aimed at identifying possible causes for cell death in <b>impact</b> <b>loading</b> by quantifying chondrocyte mechanics when cartilage was subjected to a 5 nominal tissue strain at different strain rates. Multi-scale modelling techniques were used to simulate cartilage tissue and the corresponding chondrocytes residing in the tissue. Chondrocytes were modelled by accounting for the cell membrane, pericellular matrix and pericellular capsule. The results suggest that cell deformations, cell fluid pressures and fluid flow velocity through cells are highest at the highest (impact) strain rate, {{but they do not}} reach damaging levels. Tangential strain rates of the cell membrane were highest at the highest strain rate and were observed primarily in superficial tissue cells. Since cell death following <b>impact</b> <b>loading</b> occurs primarily in superficial zone cells, we speculate that cell death in <b>impact</b> <b>loading</b> is caused by the high tangential strain rates in the membrane of superficial zone cells causing membrane rupture and loss of cell content and integrity...|$|R

Using a non-contact photoelectric testing method, this paper experimentally obtained the dynamic data of the instantaneous rotational speed for an aircraft wheel when it contacts the platform. Moreover, the kinetic relationship between the transient rotational speed of the aircraft wheel and the force of horizontal impact was established. According to the change data measured from the transient rotational speed of the aircraft wheel, the maximum horizontal <b>impact</b> <b>load</b> at the instant of aircraft contact with the platform was calculated.

40|$|Key words: elas-plastic impact load; {{numerical}} solution; bar model; tube model; mass ratio. Abstract: The explicit numerical {{method is}} used to trace the impact procedure of the tube columns impacted by a rigid body. The bar and rectangle tube models are both used to simulate the tube column. The elastic and elas-plastic <b>impact</b> <b>load</b> with different mass ratio and impact speed are obtained. The calculation results show that: for elastic models, the bigger the mass ratio and the higher the rigid body speed, the bigger the peak value of elastic impact load; at the same time, the more obvious the reduction effect of local buckling of rectangle tube on the peak value of <b>impact</b> <b>load</b> and the longer the contact time of tube model; so the peak value of <b>impact</b> <b>load</b> of the rectangle tube is not proportional to the rigid body speed. The stress wave in the tube causes a little difference between the load curves of tube model and bar model. For elas-plastic models, the higher the rigid body speed and the smaller the mass ratio, the bigger the peak value of <b>impact</b> <b>load</b> and the longer the contact time. The higher the rigid body speed, the bigger the difference between elastic and elas-plastic <b>impact</b> <b>load</b> peak value due to the expanding of plasticity. Because {{of the effect of}} local buckling, the peak value of elas-plastic <b>impact</b> <b>load</b> of rectangle tube is always lower than that of bar...|$|E

The effects of impact velocity, impact mass, support condition, axial loading and CFRP thickness are examined through detail parametric study. The impact simulation results indicate that the strengthening technique shows an improved impact resistance capacity by reducing lateral displacement of the strengthened column about 58 % compared to the bare steel column.
