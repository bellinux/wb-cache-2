5|$|Farther {{north in}} Rhode Island, 10,000people fled from the coast. Despite {{evacuation}} orders, {{nearly half of}} the residents in Narragansett, Rhode Island, refused to leave their homes and as a result martial law was implemented to <b>get</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> leave. The Red Cross reported that about 2,300 people evacuated Cape Cod, Massachusetts, and thousands of tourists left the area. About 70flights to and from Boston's Logan International Airport were canceled. Flood warnings were raised across western portions of the state.|$|E
5|$|Harvey {{needed a}} way to <b>get</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> Monte Ne. In 1900, there were few {{adequate}} roads, and automobiles were not yet practical. The natural solution seemed to be to build a railroad from Lowell, Arkansas to Monte Ne. The Arkansas Railroad Commission granted a charter on April 26, 1902, and the Monte Ne Railway Company was incorporated in May 1902, with a capital stock of $250,000. Besides Harvey, the company included: Carl A. Starck, P. G. Davidson, A. L. Williams, B. R. Davidson, J. H. McIlroy, J. W. Kimmons, F. F. Freeman, J. F. Felker, Robert H. Harven and Thomas W. Harvey (Coin's brother). Another of Harvey's brothers, a banker at Huntington, West Virginia, furnished $25,000. Of the 250 shares in the company, 240 were registered in Harvey's name. The five-mile (8km) private railroad spur started at the Lowell transfer station. Fourteen thousand oak railway ties were laid running through Cross Hollows, south of Rogers, where two ravines met. It then passed through Limedale, terminating above Big Spring Lake at a log cabin depot with open-air waiting rooms. Harvey leased an engine, a tender, and a passenger coach from the St. Louis and San Francisco Railroad. The railway opened on June 19, 1902. Harvey imported a 50-foot (15m) gondola from Venice in July 1901 to meet guests arriving by rail and carry them to the resort.|$|E

25|$|Knievel's daredevil show {{broke up}} after the Barstow {{performance}} because injuries prevented him from performing. After recovering, Knievel started traveling from small town to small town as a solo act. To get ahead of other motorcycle stunt people who were jumping animals or pools of water, Knievel started jumping cars. He began adding more and more cars to his jumps when {{he would return to}} the same venue to <b>get</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> come out and see him again. Knievel had not had a serious injury since the Barstow performance, but on June 19 in Missoula, Montana, he attempted to jump twelve cars and a cargo van. The distance he had for takeoff did not allow him to get up enough speed. His back wheel hit the top of the van while his front wheel hit the top of the landing ramp. Knievel ended up with a severely broken arm and several broken ribs. The crash and subsequent stay in the hospital were a publicity windfall.|$|E

While in the kitchen alone, an unseen man enters and he and Kat have a sexual encounter. She feels guilty {{the next day and}} attempts to neglect calls and texts from the mystery man, who has bought her a new phone. Kat eventually responds and talks with the man to tell him to leave her alone, but changes her mind and they begin a frequent affair, and he supplies them with a flat to use. Kat endeavours several times to end it, but she continuously succumbs. He falls in love with her, with Kat reciprocating, and when he sends Kat flowers, Alfie becomes suspicious. Kat lies they are from Charlie, but Alfie does not believe her and asks her to be totally honest, to which Kat reveals her three-month affair, telling him he does not know the other man. Alfie is furious and throws her out. After a heart-to-heart with Michael, Kat returns to The Queen Victoria to ask for Alfie's forgiveness and suggests going away for a while.|$|E

[...] Brooks spent a year reworking the screenplay: [...] "There were changes made and the emphasis was changed but it's the product, really, of a very unusual writing team," [...] and the project became As Good as It Gets, taking a year to produce after funding had been secured. According to The New York Times, Brooks [...] "was constantly experimenting, constantly reshooting, constantly re-editing" [...] the film, changing its ending five times and allowing the actors to improvise the film's tone.|$|E

Pitt appeared on Forbess annual Celebrity 100 list of the 100 most powerful celebrities in 2006, 2007, and 2008, at No. 20, No. 5, and No. 10 respectively.

500|$|According to Ocias, {{the main}} themes of Loved were of {{dominance}} and power, but {{to provide a}} fuller answer would [...] "defy {{the point of the}} game". His intentions in making the game were to <b>get</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> think about the games they were playing—a direction he found much of the video game industry shying away from. The confrontational aspect of the game was motivated by two aspects: primarily to use [...] "the resource of emotions" [...] invoked by its risk and reward mechanic; and secondly to absorb the awareness of people online. Expanding upon his inspirations, Ocias cited individual games such as The Last Guardian and , along with companies such as Thatgamecompany and Eidos Montréal, as showing [...] "greater depth" [...] to video games as well as experimentation and research. Ocias ultimately stated that while he dislikes [...] "force-feeding" [...] players, he would try to take a different approach both mechanically and thematically for his next game.|$|E

[...] Nick Levine of Digital Spy called it [...] "a rave-tinged electro blipathon on which Spears is vocodered {{to the point of}} sounding extra-terrestrial." [...] Alexis Petridis from The Guardian said that the song [...] "seems to be bending over backwards to annoy the listener.

[...] He stated that [...] "the whole point of the book is to raise awareness about the kiddie-sex tourism business in Thailand". Though the story uses more realism than the escapism typically associated with superhero fiction, Vachss did end the book with endorsements of two real non-profit groups; Don't! Buy! Thai! and End Child Prostitution in Asian Tourism. The writing is not subtle, as Vachss noted [...] "If you don't get angry, you're not going to do anything". Understanding that the likely readers were young males with short attention spans, Vachss tried to be dramatic by using what author Adam Begley calls [...] "a motivational hat trick: sympathy for the victims, revenge, and a family calling".|$|E
