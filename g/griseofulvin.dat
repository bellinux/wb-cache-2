5|$|Many species produce {{metabolites}} {{that are}} {{major sources of}} pharmacologically active drugs. Particularly important are the antibiotics, including the penicillins, a structurally related group of β-lactam antibiotics that are synthesized from small peptides. Although naturally occurring penicillins such as penicillin G (produced by Penicillium chrysogenum) have a relatively narrow spectrum of biological activity, {{a wide range of}} other penicillins can be produced by chemical modification of the natural penicillins. Modern penicillins are semisynthetic compounds, obtained initially from fermentation cultures, but then structurally altered for specific desirable properties. Other antibiotics produced by fungi include: ciclosporin, commonly used as an immunosuppressant during transplant surgery; and fusidic acid, used to help control infection from methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteria. Widespread use of antibiotics for the treatment of bacterial diseases, such as tuberculosis, syphilis, leprosy, and others began in the early 20th century and continues to date. In nature, antibiotics of fungal or bacterial origin appear to play a dual role: at high concentrations they act as chemical defense against competition with other microorganisms in species-rich environments, such as the rhizosphere, and at low concentrations as quorum-sensing molecules for intra- or interspecies signaling. Other drugs produced by fungi include <b>griseofulvin</b> isolated from Penicillium griseofulvum, used to treat fungal infections, and statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors), used to inhibit cholesterol synthesis. Examples of statins found in fungi include mevastatin from Penicillium citrinum and lovastatin from Aspergillus terreus and the oyster mushroom.|$|E
25|$|Topical {{steroids and}} {{antibiotic}} ointments such as Neosporin {{have not only}} shown to be ineffective in treating dermatophytosis caused by Aphanoascus fulvescens, but have {{also been shown to}} enhance its fungal growth. Ringworm infections caused by A.fulvescens in animals have been successfully treated with anti-fungal drugs such as Tinactin, which contains tolnaftate as its active ingredient, and Grisactin, which contains <b>griseofulvin</b> as its active ingredient. However, topical treatment of human A.fulvescens infections with tolnaftate-containing drugs has been shown to worsen the lesions, causing further inflammation and increased sensitivity. Treatment with <b>griseofulvin</b> has proven somewhat effective in reducing lesion sizes and appears to have a dose-dependent effect. It should be noted however that while lesions continue to heal after increased <b>griseofulvin</b> administration, there is some residual scarring of the infected area. Currently, there is no documentation providing evidence of an anti-fungal treatment that is completely effective against human dermatophytosis caused by A.fulvescens.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the most}} common fungal {{diseases}} in dogs is ringworm, or dermatophytosis, an infection of the skin, hair, or nails. [...] There are three fungal species that cause ringworm in dogs. [...] About 70 percent of infections are caused by Microsporum canis, 20 percent by M. gypseum, and 10 percent by Trichophyton mentagrophytes. [...] Signs include hair loss and scaling of the skin. [...] Treatment for localized ringworm is not always necessary as the disease is self-limiting, but the cliinical course can be shortened by using topical miconazole or clotrimazole. [...] Generalized infections, most commonly seen in immunocompromised dogs, can be treated with oral antifungal drugs such as <b>griseofulvin</b> or itraconazole. [...] Infection can spread to humans.|$|E
2500|$|Several {{anti-infective}} medications {{have been}} derived from fungi including penicillin and the cephalosporins (antibacterial drugs from Penicillium chrysogenum and Cephalosporium acremonium, respectively) and <b>griseofulvin</b> (an antifungal drug from Penicillium griseofulvum). [...] Other medicinally useful fungal metabolites include lovastatin (from Pleurotus ostreatus), {{which became a}} lead {{for a series of}} drugs that lower cholesterol levels, cyclosporin (from Tolypocladium inflatum), which is used to suppress the immune response after organ transplant operations, and ergometrine (from Claviceps spp.), which acts as a vasoconstrictor, and is used to prevent bleeding after childbirth. Asperlicin (from Aspergillus alliaceus) is another example. [...] Asperlicin is a novel antagonist of cholecystokinin, a neurotransmitter thought to be involved in panic attacks, and could potentially be used to treat anxiety.|$|E

50|$|The {{treatment}} of choice by dermatologists is a safe and inexpensive oral medication, <b>griseofulvin,</b> a secondary metabolite of the fungus Penicillium <b>griseofulvin.</b> This compound is fungistatic (inhibiting the growth or reproduction of fungi) and works by affecting the microtubular system of fungi, interfering with the mitotic spindle and cytoplasmic microtubules. The recommended pediatric dosage is 10 mg/kg/day for 6-8 weeks, although this may be increased to 20 mg/kg/d for those infected by T. tonsurans, or those who fail {{to respond to the}} initial 6 weeks of treatment. Unlike other fungal skin infections that may be treated with topical therapies like creams applied directly to the afflicted area, <b>griseofulvin</b> must be taken orally to be effective; this allows the drug to penetrate the hair shaft where the fungus lives. The effective therapy rate of this treatment is generally high, in the range of 88-100%.Other oral antifungal treatments for tinea capitis also frequently reported in the literature include terbinafine, itraconazole, and fluconazole; these drugs have the advantage of shorter treatment durations than <b>griseofulvin.</b> However, concern has been raised about the possibility of rare side effects like liver toxicity or interactions with other drugs; furthermore, the newer drug treatments tend to be more expensive than <b>griseofulvin.</b>|$|E

5000|$|A {{symptomatic}} {{patient will}} present an unusual amount of itching and alopecia. [...] Primary treatment involves <b>griseofulvin,</b> an antimycotic agent.

[...] However, these agents have drug-drug interactions and over a prolonged period of time can cause liver damage. [...] Currently, squalamine, an aminosterol with fungicidal properties is being researched as its mechanism of action is different from that of the aforementioned medicines, making it a good drug for those who don't respond well to Itraconazole, fluconazole or terbinafine. Systemic treatment with oral medication and anti-fungal shampoos has also been effective. [...] Antifungal shampoos (Ketoconazole 2% shampoo or selenium sulfide 2.5% [...] ) are effective as they reduce the transmission of the diseased hair by preventing its shedding. [...] Other treatments include, epilation of the infected follicles, topical ointments and steroidal treatments.

50|$|The {{first step}} in the {{biosynthesis}} of <b>griseofulvin</b> by P. <b>griseofulvin</b> is the synthesis of the 14-carbon poly-β-keto chain by a type I iterative polyketide synthase (PKS) via iterative addition of 6 malonyl-CoA to an acyl-CoA starter unit. The 14-carbon poly-β-keto chain undergoes cyclization/aromatization, using cyclase/aromatase, respectively, through a Claisen and aldol condensation to form the benzophenone intermediate. The benzophenone intermediate is then methylated via S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) twice to yield griseophenone C. The griseophenone C is then halogenated at the activated site ortho to the phenol group on the left aromatic ring to form griseophenone B. The halogenated species then undergoes a single phenolic oxidation in both rings forming the two oxygen diradical species. The right oxygen radical shifts alpha to the carbonyl via resonance allowing for a stereospecific radical coupling by the oxygen radical on the left ring forming a tetrahydrofuranone species. The newly formed grisan skeleton with a spiro center is then O-methylated by SAM to generate dehydrogriseofulvin. Ultimately, a stereoselective reduction of the olefin on dehydrogriseofulvin by NADPH affords <b>griseofulvin.</b>|$|E
