Bowling Green State University was recognized {{for excellence in}} first-year experience programs and residential living/learning communities by U.S. News & World Report from 2002–2003 through 2010–2011. In BGSU's residential learning communities, students with similar interests, majors, cultural connections, and goals live and study together. In the academically-based communities students work closely with <b>faculty</b> <b>members</b> <b>who</b> teach classes and have offices in the residence hall. BGSU offers eight residential learning communities: Arts Village, Global Village, Honors Learning Community, La Comunidad, La Maison Française, Natural and Health Sciences Residential Community, Partners in Context and Community, Chapman Community at Kohl; eight residential theme communities: Army ROTC, Aviation, Batchelder Music Community, Construction Management, Fraternity and Sorority Life, Wellness, and SEARCH; and one non-residential learning community known as Honors Scholars.

30|$|This {{is where}} {{teaching}} and research activities and their associated input–output factors differ by nature, though they are not mutually exclusive. In fact, they are two independent objects with obvious overlaps. For example, a <b>faculty</b> <b>member</b> <b>who</b> teaches a course at an undergraduate level is more a teacher rather than a researcher. Also, a <b>faculty</b> <b>member</b> <b>who</b> teaches a supporting course for graduate students is both a teacher and a researcher.|$|R

Williams, a Harvard University Phi Beta Kappa, was a self-made gentleman farmer and {{prominent}} Michigan attorney. He was a passionate promoter {{of higher education}} for the farming and working classes. In the first year, Williams hired several well-educated <b>faculty</b> <b>members</b> <b>who</b> had studied in prominent east coast schools. In cramped College Hall, these scholars developed well-equipped laboratories with then-rare microscopes and other state-of-the-art scientific equipment. Under Williams, the College offered a unique blend of practical and theoretical academics.|$|E

25|$|The Center for Undergraduate Research Opportunities (CURO), {{which is}} {{administered}} by the Honors Program, promotes opportunities for all undergraduate students at the University of Georgia to engage in research with premier research faculty regardless of discipline, major or GPA. CURO operates on the premise that it is possible for undergraduate students and faculty members to cooperatively engage in the creation of knowledge. Research <b>faculty</b> <b>members</b> <b>who</b> participate in CURO consider students partners in a learning community, and many students find they develop mentoring relationships focused on conducting research. Participating in undergraduate research contributes to the intellectual, professional, and personal growth of students. Through in-depth research with faculty members, students can explore questions and issues of interest as lines of inquiry develop through their undergraduate careers, earning academic credit in the process.|$|E

500|$|The {{publication}} of this essay, {{the title of}} which Esolen claimed he did not choose, was greeted with anger on the Providence campus from students and faculty alike. Providence students organized a protest march. A group of faculty members of the school wrote a petition in which they charged that Esolen's writings contained repeated [...] "racist, xenophobic, misogynist, homophobic and religiously chauvinist statements." [...] The Rev. Brian Shanley, O.P., President of Providence College, publicly distanced himself from Esolen's statements by claiming [...] "that he speaks only for himself." [...] Meanwhile, Robert P. George, a conservative Catholic professor at Esolen's alma mater, Princeton University, defended him. He argued that students and <b>faculty</b> <b>members</b> <b>who</b> disagree with him [...] "should respond in the currency of academic discourse—reasons, evidence, arguments—not by attempting to isolate, stigmatize, and marginalize him for stating dissenting opinions." ...|$|E
500|$|In May 1970, {{there was}} a Vietnam War protest held in the park blocks, held in {{response}} to the invasion of Cambodia and the Kent State Shootings. Strikers barricaded streets surrounding the university and Park Blocks, causing them to become car-free, as they are now. Due in part to the Kent State Shootings on May 4, and 134 <b>faculty</b> <b>members</b> <b>who</b> had formally joined the strike, Portland State University was forced to close from May 6 to 11. By May 6, the protesters formed an underground newspaper, called the Wallposter, and had four demands: [...] "U.S. out of S.E. Asia now; troops, cops off campus; free Bobby Seale; detoxify nerve gas." [...] Posters with a logo were printed in the PSU Smith Center cafeteria, but protesters were evicted from the area by May 7 after a [...] "wild, all-night party". On May 11, police officers charged protesters and forcibly removed a symbolic hospital tent (a geodesic dome) placed on the blocks. 28 protesters were injured and taken to area hospitals, and four police officers were injured. Lawsuits following the protest led to Portland Police agreeing to never use force against non-violent protesters in the future.|$|E

500|$|In 1905 {{a scandal}} erupted in French musical circles over the country's top musical prize, the Prix de Rome. Fauré's pupil Ravel had been {{eliminated}} prematurely in his sixth attempt for this award, and many believed that reactionary {{elements within the}} Conservatoire had {{played a part in}} it. Dubois, who became the subject of much censure, brought forward his retirement and stepped down at once. Appointed in his place, and {{with the support of the}} French government, Fauré radically changed the administration and curriculum. He appointed independent external judges to decide on admissions, examinations and competitions, a move which enraged <b>faculty</b> <b>members</b> <b>who</b> had given preferential treatment to their private pupils; feeling themselves deprived of a considerable extra income, many of them resigned. Fauré was dubbed [...] "Robespierre" [...] by disaffected members of the old guard as he modernised and broadened the range of music taught at the Conservatoire. As Nectoux puts it, [...] "where Auber, Halévy and especially Meyerbeer had reigned supreme... it was now possible to sing an aria by Rameau or even some Wagner– up to now a forbidden name within the Conservatoire's walls". The curriculum was broadened to range from Renaissance polyphony to the works of Debussy.|$|E
500|$|As {{of the end}} of the 2009 season, the Presidents {{have played}} in 1,057 games during their 119 seasons; during that time they have {{employed}} 30 head coaches. [...] In 1894, E. Gard Edwards became the first paid head coach. [...] The hiring of professional coaches for the football team was controversial among large portions of the college community, including those who felt it was a poor use of college funds and <b>faculty</b> <b>members</b> <b>who</b> believed that the focus on athletics detracted from the ideal of a scholar-athlete. [...] Professor Edward Linton represented the college at the 1906 founding of the International Athletic Association of the United States, the forerunner of the NCAA, where the first national standards for edibility and amateurism were developed. [...] At that meeting, Linton expressed a desire for the student athlete to be [...] "relieved of the incubus of the professional coach." [...] Three coaches have led Washington & Jefferson College to the NCAA Division III playoffs: John Luckhardt, John Banaszak, and Mike Sirianni. Those three coaches, plus Chuck Ream, coached teams that won the Presidents' Athletic Conference Championship. [...] Greasy Neale's 1921 team played in the 1922 Rose Bowl, the oldest bowl game, where they tied the heavily favored California Golden Bears. [...] Neale is the only coach to lead the Presidents to a bowl game appearance.|$|E
