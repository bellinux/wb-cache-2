5|$|The film {{opens in}} 35,000 B.C., in {{what will become}} North Texas. Two cavemen hunters {{encounter}} a large extraterrestrial life form in a cave, which kills one and infects the other with a black oil-like substance. In 1998, in the same area, a boy falls into a hole and is also infected by a black substance which seeps from the ground. Firefighters who enter the hole to rescue him <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>come</b> out. A team of men wearing hazmat suits arrive and extract the boy's body. Meanwhile, FBI Special Agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully, while investigating a bomb threat against a federal building in Dallas, discover the bomb in a building across the street. As the building is evacuated, Special Agent in Charge Darius Michaud remains, ostensibly to disarm the bomb. However, he simply waits for the bomb to detonate.|$|E
5|$|Self-incompatible, Acacia pycnantha cannot {{fertilise}} {{itself and}} requires cross-pollination between plants to set seed. Birds facilitate this and field experiments keeping birds away from flowers greatly reduces seed production. Nectaries {{are located on}} phyllodes; those near open flowers become active, producing nectar that birds feed upon just before or during flowering. While feeding, birds brush against the flower heads and dislodge pollen and often visit multiple trees. Several species of honeyeater, including the white-naped, yellow-faced, New Holland, and occasionally white-plumed and crescent honeyeaters, and Eastern spinebills have been observed foraging. Other bird species include the silvereye, striated, buff-rumped and brown thornbills. As well as eating nectar, birds often pick off insects on the foliage. Honeybees, native bees, ants and flies also visit nectaries, but generally <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>come</b> {{into contact with the}} flowers during this activity. The presence of Acacia pycnantha is positively correlated with numbers of swift parrots overwintering in box–ironbark forest in central Victoria, though {{it is not clear whether}} the parrots are feeding on them or some other factor is at play.|$|E
5|$|This fern was {{at first}} {{identified}} by André Michaux, in 1803, as black spleenwort (Asplenium adiantum-nigrum). Carl Ludwig Willdenow recognized and {{described it as a}} separate species, which he named Asplenium montanum, in 1810. In 1901, John A. Shafer attempted to transfer it to the genus Athyrium as Athyrium montanum, but this name is illegitimate as a later homonym of Athyrium montanum (Lam.) Röhl. ex Spreng. The species was segregated from Asplenium as Chamaefilix montana by Oliver Atkins Farwell in 1931. The change was not widely accepted and current authorities do not recognize this segregate genus. In 1974, Timothy Reeves described an unusual population of A.montanum from the Shawangunk Mountains. Having used chromatography to show {{that it was not a}} hybrid, he interpreted it as a new form, Asplenium montanum forma shawangunkense. In this form, as contrasted with the usual forma montanum, the leaf blade is yellow-green, the fronds continue highly dissected to the apex and <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>come</b> to a pointed tip, the fronds are shorter and more highly dissected than usual, and all fronds are sterile.|$|E

25|$|Tickets {{purchased}} from a machine <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>come</b> pre-validated. Passengers must validate their tickets using the validators {{located on the}} platforms.

25|$|Stagings and {{broadcasts}} of {{the original}} five-act French version of the opera have become more frequent in the later 20th and into the 21st century, although they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>come</b> anywhere near to equaling the number given in Italian.

Without a willingness to change, companies get stuck in patterns that prevent them from not only progressing operationally, but also culturally...|$|R
25|$|Since in God Speaks {{there is}} no mention of Charles Darwin's theory of evolution, the {{progression}} must be seen as a progression in consciousness rather than in biological linearity. Meher Baba's explanations <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>come</b> to disprove any scientific discoveries of biological evolution, but rather examine a different side of the process.|$|E
25|$|Zoophilia {{may reflect}} {{childhood}} experimentation, sexual abuse {{or lack of}} other avenues of sexual expression. Exclusive desire for animals rather than humans is considered a rare paraphilia, and sufferers often have other paraphilias with which they present. Zoophiles will not usually seek help for their condition, and so <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>come</b> {{to the attention of}} psychiatrists for zoophilia itself.|$|E
25|$|Chabad {{has set up}} an {{extensive}} network of camps around the world, most using the name Gan Israel, a name chosen by Schneerson although the first overnight camp was the girls division called Camp Emunah. There are 1,200 sites serving 210,000 children — most of whom <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>come</b> from Orthodox homes. Of these, 500 camps are in the United States.|$|E

25|$|According to rabbinical law, a woman {{becomes a}} niddah {{when she is}} aware that blood has come from her womb, whether it is due to menstruation, childbirth, sexually {{transmitted}} disease, or other reasons. If menstruation began before she sees evidence of it, the rabbinic regulations regard her as not being niddah until she notices. Until this point, the regulations <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>come</b> into force.|$|E
25|$|The {{heat source}} may be {{provided}} by the combustion of a fuel and, since the combustion products do not mix with the working fluid and hence <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>come</b> {{into contact with the}} internal parts of the engine, a Stirling engine can run on fuels that would damage other engines types' internals, such as landfill gas, which may contain siloxane which can deposit abrasive silicon dioxide in conventional engines.|$|E
25|$|Standards usually <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>come</b> with {{fairings}} or windscreens, or if {{they have}} them, they are relatively small. Standard is often a synonym for naked bike, a term that became popular in the 1990s {{in response to the}} proliferation of fully faired sport bikes. The standard seemed to have disappeared, fueling nostalgia for the return of the Universal Japanese Motorcycle, which were admired for their simplicity, quality, and versatility.|$|E

25|$|Hainan Province uses a {{slightly}} different administrative system than the other provinces of China. Most other provinces are divided entirely into prefecture-level divisions, {{each of which is}} then divided entirely into county-level divisions. County-level divisions generally <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>come</b> directly under the province. In Hainan, nearly all county-level divisions (the eight districts excepted) come directly under the province. This method of division is due to Hainan's relatively sparse population of around 8 million people.|$|E
25|$|One modern {{variant of}} chu shogi, called Heisei chu shogi (平成中将棋), is {{played on a}} more open board. Forty percent of the pieces are set aside at setup and held in reserve, and once during the game a player may drop one of these on an empty square {{adjacent}} to a friendly piece. Captured pieces <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>come</b> back into play, {{and the rest of}} the game is played as in regular chu shogi.|$|E
25|$|Anyone {{who claims}} to speak God's words or teach in his name {{and is not a}} prophet the Bible terms a false prophet. One test given in the Old Testament in Deuteronomy {{contains}} a warning of those who prophecy events which <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>come</b> to pass and said they should be put to death. Elsewhere a false prophet may be someone who is purposely trying to deceive, is delusional, under the influence of Satan or is speaking from his own spirit.|$|E

25|$|Special {{awards are}} {{presented}} at each year's World Schools Debating Championships to the best-performing English-as-a-Second-Language (ESL) and English-as-a-Foreign-Language (EFL) teams. These awards {{are open to}} teams from nations where English is not an official national language. To {{be eligible for the}} EFL award, a team must be predominantly made-up of students who <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>come</b> from English-speaking homes and who do not attend schools where English is used as a medium of instruction. The ESL award is for teams predominantly composed of students who are not first-language English-speakers, but who attend schools where {{some or all of the}} teaching is in English.|$|E

Artwork can be obtained for songs not purchased from the store for free if the user has an iTunes Store account. Purchased songs <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>come</b> with lyrics, nor does iTunes provide a service for acquiring the missing lyrics.
