5|$|The {{entire body}} {{of the book is}} {{arranged}} as a dictionary from Aberdevine ('Vide Siskin.) on page 58 (the pages are however not numbered in the original) to Yelper ('Vide Avoset.) on page 687. Since the book does not have a continuous narrative to summarise, the account <b>here</b> <b>will</b> use one species as a running example to illustrate the book's approach. The cirl bunting is chosen because it was discovered by Montagu and is associated in Britain with his home town of Kingsbridge, Devon. He also chose the species for the colour frontispiece of the book.|$|E
5|$|Krueger flap and Natural Laminar Flow Insect Mitigation Test Program – Boeing {{commenced}} {{a series}} of test flights on 17 March 2015 with a modified Boeing 757, incorporating new wing-leading-edge sections and an actively blown vertical tail. The left wing has been modified to include a 6.7 m-span glove section supporting a variable-camber Krueger flap which will be deployed during landing and which protrudes {{just ahead of the}} leading edge. Although Krueger flaps have been tried before as insect-mitigation screens, previous designs caused additional drag; the newer design being tested is variable-camber and designed to retract as seamlessly as possible into the lower wing surface. Increasing the use of natural laminar flow (NLF) on an aircraft wing has the potential to improve fuel burn by as much as 15%, but even small contaminants from insect remains will trip the flow from laminar to turbulent, destroying the performance benefit. The test flights have been supported by the European airline group TUI AG and conducted jointly with NASA as part of the agency’s Environmentally Responsible Aviation (ERA) program. While the left wing tests the Kreuger flaps, the right wing is being used to test coatings that prevent insects from adhering to the wing. Success <b>here</b> <b>will</b> {{open the door to the}} application of Natural Laminar Flow to reduce fuel burn.|$|E

25|$|Different {{kinds of}} cell {{organizations}} {{have been used for}} different purposes. This section focuses on clandestine cells, as would be used for espionage, sabotage, or the organization for unconventional warfare. When unconventional warfare starts using overt units, the cell system tends to be used only for sensitive leadership and intelligence roles. The examples <b>here</b> <b>will</b> use CIA cryptonyms as a naming convention used to identify members of the cell system. Cryptonyms begin with a two-letter country or subject name (e.g., AL), followed with an arbitrary word. It is considered elegant to have the code merge with the other letters to form a pronounceable word.|$|E
25|$|This {{situation}} {{represents a}} conflict of interest and duty. Both X and Y hold fiduciary duties to each other, which means they must subdue their own interests in favor of the duo's collective interest. By signing an individual contract and taking all the money, X has put personal interest above the fiduciary duty. Therefore, a court will find that X has breached his fiduciary duty. The judicial remedy <b>here</b> <b>will</b> be that X holds both the contract and the money in a constructive trust for the duo. Note, X will not be punished or totally denied of the benefit; both X and Y will receive a half share in the contract and the money.|$|E
25|$|Since {{its initial}} construction, very {{little has been}} updated or modified. However, {{intensive}} renovation efforts were begun in 2009 for the upcoming 2010 celebrations. Much of the equipment and machinery is original from the early 20th century. Much of the technological equipment is being updated, especially in the theatre which needs computerized lights, sound systems and other improvements. Other work will improve the acoustics. Upgrades to the theatre will allow for multimedia shows which were not available before. The main hall has had no renovation or upgrade work since it opened in 1934. Renovations <b>here</b> <b>will</b> lessen {{the number of people}} the hall can accommodate but should make the area more comfortable.|$|E

500|$|In a {{retrospective}} {{of the first}} season in Entertainment Weekly, [...] "Conduit" [...] was rated a B, with the episode being described as [...] "excellent for background" [...] for the series, though {{it was noted that}} Duchovny gave [...] "a performance that makes wood look lively". [...] Keith Phipps, writing for The A.V. Club, reviewed the episode positively, rating it a B+, feeling that the episode worked well to expand on the motivations of the two lead characters, noting that [...] "the work done <b>here</b> <b>will</b> pay off well later". The episode has been seen as laying the foundation for the recurrence of Fox Mulder's obsession with finding his missing sister, which would come {{to be one of the}} main plot threads of the series.|$|E

Michael Howard and Charles Kennedy, {{the leaders of}} the UK's other leading political parties at the time, were also present. A guard of honour was provided by 56 officers wearing the uniforms of each of the UK's police forces. The Queen stated that [...] "It is surely appropriate that this should be positioned in The Mall - an area of London so often associated with our national way of life. When people pass by the memorial, I hope they will pause and reflect on the proud traditions that it represents. The courage and personal sacrifice recorded <b>here</b> <b>will,</b> I am certain, serve as an inspiration to us all." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite his {{successful}} media career, Icke wrote that 1989 {{was a time}} of considerable personal despair, and it was during this period that he said he began to feel a presence around him. He often describes how he felt it while alone in a hotel room in March 1990, and finally asked: [...] "If there is anybody <b>here,</b> <b>will</b> you please contact me because you are driving me up the wall!" [...] Days later, in a newsagent's in Ryde, he felt a force pull his feet to the ground, he wrote, and heard a voice guide him toward some books. One of them was Mind to Mind (1989) by Betty Shine, a psychic healer in Brighton. He read the book, then wrote to her requesting a consultation about his arthritis.|$|E
500|$|... "Baby" [...] {{was written}} by Bieber with Christopher [...] "Tricky" [...] Stewart and Terius [...] "The-Dream" [...] Nash, both of whom worked with Bieber on [...] "One Time", R singer and The-Dream's then wife Christina Milian and labelmate, Ludacris. When asked how the {{collaboration}} initially came about, Bieber said, [...] " [...] both live in Atlanta. I met him a year prior to this and we figured {{it was a perfect}} collaboration for him, so we invited him out to do it." [...] Bieber first premiered the song performing on MuchMusic on December 28, 2009. A few days before the release of the single, Bieber posted an acoustic version of the song to his YouTube with his guitarist Dan Kanterr, similar to the way he did with [...] "Favorite Girl". Billboard said that: [...] "Bieber delivers his characteristically clean vocals with conviction: [...] "My first love broke my heart for the first time / and I'm like, 'baby, baby, baby, no!' I thought you'd always be mine." [...] Also in a review of the acoustic version Bill Lamb of About.com said that [...] "I think the vocals <b>here</b> <b>will</b> convince some that Justin Bieber really does have the vocal chops." ...|$|E

500|$|According to {{reviewer}} Heid Erdrich, Mom & Me & Mom {{does not}} center on Angelou's childhood trauma, {{as described in}} Caged Bird, but [...] "rather constructs a portrait of self via details of her relationship to the mother who abandoned her and with whom she reunited as a teenager". [...] Erdrich states that Angelou's prose is [...] "very simply written", and calls her tone [...] "mostly light, even sweet, filled with affection for her younger self". [...] Erdrich states that even though {{it could have been}} written for young women experiencing the same difficulties Angelou faced, the book does not preach, but [...] "presents Angelou’s life path scattered with enormous obstacles endured and conquered through knowledge of self and a singular brand of mother love". [...] Publishers Weekly agrees, stating, [...] "The lessons and love presented <b>here</b> <b>will</b> speak to those trying to make their way in the world". [...] Erdrich also states that Angelou's narrative of her [...] "hard-won love for her extraordinary mother" [...] is compelling, and that Angelou portrays Baxter [...] "as extraordinarily self-aware, liberated from what others might think, and independent beyond any feminist of her era" [...] and [...] "the stuff of fiction but real and responsible in unexpected ways for the gift of her talented daughter".|$|E
500|$|Another spoof was of {{a musical}} {{detailing}} the life of Bessie Bunter, entitled Bessie! The musical starts as an Andrew Lloyd Webber parody with the setting of a girl's private school but they've [...] included {{issues such as the}} Spanish Civil War and the McCarthy era. On being asked about Bessie's fatness, the producer (Sir Dave) replies [...] "it is a sort of mental fatness". The lead actress, Carla, belts out in rehearsals one of the songs, [...] "One Day", despite insisting she has [...] "pneumonia". She says to prepare for the role she starts with the bra and then everything falls into place. Later, Bessie! is rewritten completely and the previous cast are sacked: it is, after all, a musical about [...] "a big fat girl". Meanwhile, Carla is crying and being comforted by her colleagues, but further upset by Sir Dave telling her to [...] "get the **** out of <b>here</b> <b>will</b> you Carla, we don't really want snot all over the plush love" [...] In this rewritten part of Bessie, she is played by Victoria Wood who sings an impossibly glamorous and upbeat number. However, she complains at the end that [...] "you're {{going to have to change}} this floor".|$|E
500|$|Of {{the seven}} major New York {{newspaper}} drama reviewers, five gave the show very positive reviews. [...] For example, New York Journal American critic John McClain stated, [...] "Flower Drum Song {{is a big}} fat Rodgers and Hammerstein hit, and nothing written <b>here</b> <b>will</b> have the slightest effect on the proceeds." [...] The New York Daily Mirror termed it, [...] "Another notable work by the outstanding craftsmen of our musical theatre... a lovely show, an outstanding one in theme and treatment." [...] Less enthusiastic, however, was the longtime New York Times critic, Brooks Atkinson, who repeatedly described it as merely [...] "pleasant". [...] UPI's drama critic, Jack Gaver, scored it as [...] "well north of Me and Juliet and Pipe Dream" [...] but [...] "well south" [...] of Oklahoma!, Carousel, South Pacific and even the team's first flop, Allegro. [...] Ward Morehouse applauded Suzuki for having [...] "a brassy voice and the assurance of a younger Ethel Merman" [...] and termed the production [...] "an excellent Broadway show" [...] though [...] "erhaps it doesn't belong in the same world... as The King and I and Carousel." [...] Critic Kenneth Tynan, in The New Yorker magazine, alluded to the show The World of Suzie Wong in dismissing Flower Drum Song with the spoonerism, [...] "a world of woozy song".|$|E
