5|$|According {{to local}} geologists, the exact {{source of the}} spring remains unknown, but it is {{believed}} that its origin may be southwest of its actual location, possibly at Bukit Timah. Hot springs are formed when underground water comes into contact with hot rock masses. The resulting high pressure causes the water to seep upwards through cracks, forcing <b>itself</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the ground as a spring.|$|E
5|$|The {{length and}} nature of parental care varies widely amongst {{different}} orders and species. At one extreme, parental care in megapodes ends at hatching; the newly hatched chick digs <b>itself</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the nest mound without parental assistance and can fend for itself immediately. At the other extreme, many seabirds have extended periods of parental care, the longest being that of the great frigatebird, whose chicks take {{up to six months}} to fledge and are fed by the parents for up to an additional 14 months. The chick guard stage describes the period of breeding during which one of the adult birds is permanently present at the nest after chicks have hatched. The main purpose of the guard stage is to aid offspring to thermoregulate and protect them from predation.|$|E

25|$|The Protestant Ascendancy {{was shocked}} by the events of the 1790s, as was the British government. In {{response}} to them, in 1801 under the Irish Act of Union, which merged the Kingdom of Ireland with the Kingdom of Great Britain to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland the Irish Parliament voted <b>itself</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> existence and Dublin lost its political status as a capital.|$|E
25|$|Some 700 representatives at {{the conference}} {{ultimately}} adopted a draft constitution on July12 that envisaged a bicameral legislature and {{the dissolution of the}} congress. But because the convention's draft of the constitution would dissolve the congress, there was little likelihood that the congress would vote <b>itself</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> existence. The Supreme Soviet immediately rejected the draft and declared that the Congress of People's Deputies was the supreme lawmaking body and hence would decide on the new constitution.|$|E
25|$|Shen, et al. created fusion {{proteins}} between OA1 and GFP. Melanosomal localization of OA1 {{has been}} confirmed by immuno-electron microscopy and other techniques alike. Localization patterns of wild type OA1-GFP and mutated OA1-GFP were compared. The wild type OA1 localized to late endosomal or lysosomal compartments. This is supported by data from Samaraweera, et al. that OA1 colocalizes with Lamp1, which is a marker for late endosomal compartment. Hence, OA1 might traffick <b>itself</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> this compartment to the melanosomes.|$|E

25|$|Due to Newfoundland's high debt load, {{arising from}} World War I and {{construction}} of the Newfoundland Railway, and decreasing revenue, due {{to the collapse of}} fish prices, the Newfoundland legislature voted <b>itself</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> existence in 1933, in exchange for loan guarantees by the Crown and a promise it would be re-established. On February 16, 1934, the Commission of Government was sworn in, ending 79 years of responsible government. The Commission consisted of seven persons appointed by the British government. For 15 years no elections took place, and no legislature was convened.|$|E
25|$|During the {{resurgence}} in co-operation following {{the successes of}} the Rochdale Pioneers and the Co-operative Wholesale Society (CWS), the Co-operative Movement began to lift <b>itself</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the decade of society failures between 1834 and 1844. The success brought pride but also anxiety for the movement's leaders {{as they began to}} fear that societies might forget their co-operative ideals in the face of material success. The solution, it was decided at the first of the modern Co-operative Congresses, was the creation of a national organisation that could hold the movement together and emphasise the important role that co-operatives could play in society at large.|$|E
25|$|This sort of scheme {{needs to}} have a far broader base than is {{currently}} the case, it requires organization and the setting up of waste brokerages where lists of currently available wastes are and the quantities available. One of the problems is once a demand for a waste is known or shown then the material is no longer a “waste” but a sellable commodity which often prices <b>itself</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the market, c.f waste cement kiln dust and N-viro (lime conditioned sewage sludge fertilizer). In the former East Germany, organic household waste was collected and used as fodder for pigs. This integrated system was made possible by the state's control of agriculture; the complexities of continuing it in a market economy after German reunification meant the system had to be discontinued.|$|E

25|$|Sometimes {{the town}} might cease to officially exist, but the {{physical}} infrastructure remains. For example, the five Mississippi communities {{that had to}} be abandoned to build SSC still have remnants of those communities within the facility itself. These include city streets, now overgrown with forest flora and fauna, and a one-room school house. Another example of infrastructure remaining is the former town of Weston, Illinois, that voted <b>itself</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> existence and turned the land over for construction of the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory. Many houses and even a few barns remain, used for housing visiting scientists and storing maintenance equipment, while roads that used to cross through the site have been blocked off {{at the edges of the}} property, with gatehouses or simply barricades to prevent unsupervised access.|$|E
25|$|The Government, led by Prime Minister Frederick C. Alderdice, {{called upon}} the British {{government}} to take direct control until Newfoundland could become self-sustaining. The United Kingdom, concerned over Newfoundland's likelihood of defaulting on its loans, asked the government to establish the Newfoundland Royal Commission, headed by a Scottish peer, Lord Amulree. Its report, released in 1933, assessed Newfoundland's political system as institutionally corrupt and its economic future as bleak, recommending the abolition of responsible government, and its replacement by a Commission of the British Government. Acting on the report's recommendations, Alderdice's government voted <b>itself</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> existence in December 1933. Appointed as Chair of the Commission of Government in 1934, Anderson found his role as Governor with significantly expanded powers and proved himself up to the job, constantly sending reports back to the Dominions Office and giving advice to the Dominions Secretary {{on how to deal}} with the Commission members.|$|E
25|$|Once he {{is legally}} elected President of the Confederacy, Featherston slowly and quietly twists the Confederate Constitution into giving him more power. He {{maneuvers}} the Supreme Court into striking <b>itself</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> existence, provokes the black minority toward rebellion with race riots, creates farm machinery to root {{them out of}} their livelihoods so he could incarcerate them in concentration camps, and repeals the single term limit so he could run multiple times. In the meantime, the black rebellions give the CSA a plausible excuse to reinstitute conscription and arm itself. He manipulates Socialist US President Al Smith into allowing the states of Kentucky, Houston, and Sequoyah (all formerly part of the Confederacy) to hold plebiscites to determine their futures. Kentucky and Houston vote to rejoin the Confederacy with Houston also rejoining Texas, while Sequoyah, which had been saturated with settlers {{from other parts of the}} north, voted to remain part of the US.|$|E

25|$|Leather {{has been}} a {{predominantly}} gay male term to refer to one fetish, but it can stand for many more. Members of the gay male leather community may wear leathers such as Motorcycle leathers, or may be attracted to men wearing leather. Leather and BDSM are seen as two parts of one whole. Much of the BDSM culture {{can be traced back}} to the gay male leather culture, which formalized <b>itself</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the group of men who were soldiers returning home after World War II (1939–1945). WWII was the setting where countless homosexual men and women tasted the life among homosexual peers. Post-war, homosexual individuals congregated in larger cities such as New York, Chicago, San Francisco, and Los Angeles. They formed leather clubs and bike clubs, some were fraternal services. The establishment of Mr. Leather Contest and Mr. Drummer Contest were made around this time. This was the genesis of the gay male leather community. Many of the members were attracted to extreme forms of sexuality, for which peak expression was in the pre-AIDS 1970s. This subculture is epitomized by the Leatherman's Handbook by Larry Townsend, published in 1972, which describes in detail the practices and culture of gay male sadomasochists in the late 1960s and early 1970s.|$|E

500|$|The Protestant Ascendancy {{stood to}} lose {{a great deal in}} union, as seats in parliament, a {{significant}} source of power to {{a relatively small number of}} families, would necessarily be reduced as a consequence.

500|$|Harding's vague oratory irritated some; McAdoo {{described}} a typical Harding speech as [...] "an army of pompous phrases moving over {{the landscape in}} search of an idea. Sometimes these meandering words actually capture a straggling thought and bear it triumphantly, a prisoner in their midst, until it died of servitude and over work." [...] H. L. Mencken concurred, [...] "it reminds me of a string of wet sponges, it reminds me of tattered washing on the line; it reminds me of stale bean soup, of college yells, of dogs barking idiotically through endless nights. It is so bad that a kind of grandeur creeps into it. It drags <b>itself</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the dark abysm... of pish, and crawls insanely up the topmost pinnacle of tosh. It is rumble and bumble. It is balder and dash." [...] The New York Times took a more positive view of Harding's speeches, stating that in them the majority of people could find [...] "a reflection of their own indeterminate thoughts".|$|E
500|$|The taijitu ( [...] ; {{commonly}} known as the [...] "yin and yang symbol" [...] or simply the [...] "yin yang") and the bagua 八卦 ("Eight Trigrams") have importance in Taoist symbolism. In this cosmology, the universe creates <b>itself</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> a primary chaos of material energy, organized into the cycles of Yin and Yang and formed into objects and lives. Yin is the receptive and Yang is the active principle, seen in all forms change and difference such as the annual season cycles, the landscape, sexual coupling, the formation of both men and women as characters, and sociopolitical history. While almost all Taoist organizations make use of it, one could also regard it as Confucian, Neo-Confucian or pan-Chinese. One can see this symbol as a decorative element on Taoist organization flags and logos, temple floors, or stitched into clerical robes. According to Song dynasty sources, it originated around the 10th century CE. Previously, a tiger and a dragon had symbolized yin and yang.|$|E
500|$|Former federal MP Brian Jean {{was elected}} Wildrose leader on March 28, 2015.

Prentice's Progressive Conservatives, however, collapsed and lost 60 of the 70 seats it had at dissolution, returning only 10 MLAs, finding <b>itself</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> power for the first time since 1971 and coming in third behind the NDP and Wildrose.
