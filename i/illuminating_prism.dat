50|$|Ernst Abbe (1840-1905), {{working for}} Carl Zeiss AG in Jena, Germany {{in the late}} 19th century, {{was the first to}} develop a {{laboratory}} refractometer. These first instruments had built-in thermometers and required circulating water to control instrument and fluid temperatures. They also had adjustments for eliminating the effects of dispersion and analog scales from which the readings were taken. In the Abbe' refractometer the liquid sample is sandwiched into a thin layer between an <b>illuminating</b> <b>prism</b> and a refracting prism. The refracting prism is made of a glass with a high refractive index (e.g., 1.75) and the refractometer is designed to be used with samples having a refractive index smaller than that of the refracting prism. A light source is projected through the <b>illuminating</b> <b>prism,</b> the bottom surface of which is ground (i.e., roughened like a ground-glass joint), so each point on this surface {{can be thought of as}} generating light rays traveling in all directions. A detector placed on the back side of the refracting prism would show a light and a dark region.|$|E
50|$|With {{this type}} of illumination, a wide light beam is {{directed}} onto the limbal region of the cornea at an extremely low angle of incidence and with a laterally de-centered <b>illuminating</b> <b>prism.</b> Adjustment must allow the light beam to transmit through the corneal parenchymal layers according {{to the principle of}} total reflection allowing the interface with the cornea to be brightly illuminated. The magnification should be selected so that the entire cornea can be seen at a glance.|$|E
50|$|With this method, light {{enters the}} eye {{through a narrow}} to medium slit (2 to 4 mm) {{to one side of}} the area to be examined. The axes of {{illuminating}} and viewing path do not intersect at the point of image focus, to achieve this; the <b>illuminating</b> <b>prism</b> is decentered by rotating it about its vertical axis off the normal position. In this way, reflected, indirect light illuminates the area of the anterior chamber or cornea to be examined. The observed corneal area then lies between the incident light section through the cornea and the irradiated area of the iris. Observation is thus against a comparatively dark background.|$|E
5000|$|Unfortunately, {{the final}} design was {{leaked to the}} Washington Post, which printed it before the design was {{submitted}} to the CFA, the National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC), or other agencies for approval. J. Carter Brown was enraged, and he asked the National Capital Memorial Advisory Commission to stop the design approval process immediately. The CFA, NCPC, National Park Service, Virginia Commission for Historic Preservation, and other agencies with approval over the design let the Women in Military Service for America Memorial Foundation know informally that the Weiss/Manfredi design was not acceptable. Senator John Warner, J. Carter Brown, and the superintendent of Arlington National Cemetery all publicly voiced {{their opposition to the}} design. Opposition centered on the glass prisms. It was felt they were too tall and would interfere with the vista between Arlington House and the Kennedy grave site toward the Lincoln Memorial, and that their light would detract from the existing monuments. The Union Leader newspaper quoted an unnamed official with an approval agency, [...] "There's just no way those prisms aren't going to get lopped off. They are just too much." [...] Marion Weiss defended the memorial, arguing that the visit from Arlington House was preserved and the lighting would be very soft. Robert Campbell also defended the design, arguing that a memorial to women was long overdue, the <b>illuminated</b> <b>prisms</b> would not be disruptive, and the Hemicycle was doomed to deterioration and irrelevancy without it.|$|R
50|$|The {{apparatus}} used in {{the colour}} vision experiments is depicted in Fig. 1. It was constructed by joining a 5-foot box (AK) with a 2 foot box (KN) at a 100-degree angle. A mirror at M reflects light coming through the opening at BC towards a lens at L. Two equilateral prisms at P diffract light coming from the three slits at X, Y, and Z. This <b>illuminated</b> the <b>prisms</b> with {{the combination of the}} spectral colors created by the diffraction of the light from the slits. This light was also visible through the lens at L. The observer then peered through the slit at E while the operator adjusted the position and width of each slit at X, Y, and Z until the observer could not distinguish the prism light from the pure white light reflected by the mirror. The position and width of each slit was then recorded.|$|R
50|$|His {{representative}} work is Garden of Light (Eniwa, Hokkaido, 1989) where light sculptures {{are installed}} in a public space that is covered by a meter of snow {{six months of the}} year. The light changes in response to music and presents a space of poetic dimensions. Based on the same concept, in the year 2000, Echos du Lumières was installed in the Canal Saint-Martin, commissioned as a public space project by the City of Paris. The spectacle colors from the <b>prisms</b> <b>illuminate</b> the stone wall synchronizing with the sounds.|$|R

25|$|The {{outskirts}} of Tunstall will became {{home to a}} new public art statue called Golden in 2015. The 69ft (21m) steel work of art by Wolfgang Buttress was privately funded with £180,000 Section 106 monies and will be made from COR-TEN Steel, the same material as the Angel of the North. The tapered lozenge design features powerful LED lights that will <b>illuminate</b> 1,500 glass <b>prisms</b> containing the written wishes or memories of local residents. Each prism will be suspended from {{the main body of}} the sculpture by a short arm, giving the artwork a bristly appearance.

40|$|ABSTRACT | In this paper, {{we discuss}} the {{development}} of a bulk negative refractive index metamaterial made of cascaded Bfishnet [structures, with a negative index existing over a broad spectral range. We describe in detail the design of bulk metamaterials, their fabrication and characterization, as well as the mechanism of how coupling of the unit cells can reduce loss in the material through an optical transmission-line approach. Due to the lowered loss, the metamaterial is able to achieve the highest figure of merit to date for an optical negative index metamaterial (NIM) in the absence of gain media. The increased thickness of the metamaterial also allows a direct observation of negative refraction by <b>illuminating</b> a <b>prism</b> made of the material. Such an observation results in an unambiguous demonstration of negative phase evolution of the wave propagating inside the metamaterial. Furthermore, the metamaterial can be readily accessed from free space, making it functional for optical devices. As such, bulk optical metamaterials should open up new prospects for studies of the unique optical effects associated with negative and zero index materials such as the superlens, reversed Doppler effect, backward Cerenkov radiation, optical tunneling devices, compact resonators, and highly directional sources...|$|R
40|$|There {{have been}} wide-ranging debates about {{medicine}} and the law encapsulated in {{the figure of the}} coroner in Victorian England. Recently the historical literature on coroners has been enriched by macro-studies. Despite this important research, the social lives of coroners and their daily interactions remain relatively neglected in standard historical accounts. This article redresses that issue by examining the working life of the coroner for Oxford during the late-Victorian era. Edward Law Hussey kept very detailed records of his time in office as coroner. New research material makes it feasible to trace his professional background, from doctor of the sick poor, to hospital house surgeon and then busy coroner. His career trajectory, personal interactions, and professional disputes, provide an important historical <b>prism</b> <b>illuminating</b> contemporary debates that occupied coroners in their working lives. Hussey tried to improve his medico-legal reach and the public image of his coroner's office by reducing infanticide rates, converting a public mortuary, and acquiring a proper coroner's court. His campaigns had limited success because the social scene in which he worked was complicated by the dominance of health and welfare agencies that resented his role as an expanding arm of the Victorian information state. 10837...|$|R
40|$|This thesis aims to {{illuminate}} {{the economic and social}} world of the Glasgow-West India merchants, planters and the temporary economic migrants who travelled across the Atlantic during the period, 1776 - 1846. The city of Glasgow and her satellite ports was the premier Scottish transatlantic hub with connections across the British Atlantic world. This thesis has focused on the period after the American War of Independence ended the city of Glasgow’s tobacco monopoly. Thus, the rise to prominence of the city’s West India elite is assessed as well as the social, political, financial and commercial networks that underpinned their rise. This thesis offers new insights on religious affiliations of the merchants of Glasgow and traces the exportation of Presbyterianism to Jamaica in 1814. This thesis has implications for other aspects of the incipient Scottish-Atlantic historiography. In particular it contributes to T. M. Devine’s recent view that Caribbean slavery made Scotia great. However, this thesis is deliberately placed into a British-Atlantic context. Although this research demonstrates how a distinctly Caledonian operation promoted the flow of capital to Scotland, the ‘Glasgow West India interest’ themselves were part of a wider international network which in turn dictates the scope of this thesis and the historiography with which it engages. Specifically, this body of research traces direct investments of capital by West India merchants into Scottish industry and land, thus providing qualified support for Eric Williams’ main thesis in Capitalism and Slavery. However, this work goes significantly beyond the work of Williams to trace the connections between commerce and banking institutions in Scotland and the plantations of the West Indies. This thesis has examined in some detail the political activities of the Glasgow West India Association from inception in 1807 up to 1834. The Association’s sophisticated operations at a national and regional level supported the exploitative activities of the Glasgow-West India elite. Indeed, this research demonstrates that the members of the Association collected the bulk of the compensation awarded to individuals resident in Glasgow on the emancipation of slavery in 1834. This thesis has adopted a transatlantic approach that connects Scotland and the West Indies. In particular, these connections are <b>illuminated</b> through the <b>prism</b> of the careers of the young Scotsmen who sojourned to Jamaica and Grenada in particular. This thesis suggests there were increasing levels of emigration to the West Indies in this period and the skilled and educated young men sought economic opportunities not available at home. By examining wealth repatriation in life and post-mortem property transmission strategies, this thesis offers a revision on the view that such young men struggled to repatriate colonial profits. This has implications for the work of Alan Karras and others. The transatlantic approach is developed in case study examinations of Glasgow-West India merchant houses. This connects Scottish banks, commerce and industry with the British Parliament and the planters of the West Indies. The world of Scottish planters, merchants and sojourners is now becoming increasingly well known. The life, wealth and legacy of the Glasgow West India elite traced here provide innovative insights into their living conditions and material culture. It is further argued that a West India career could propel even those of modest means into the British super-wealthy. Finally, this thesis recognises the contribution of enslaved peoples to the economic development of Scotland which will hopefully stimulate further research in a Scottish-Atlantic context. </p...|$|R
