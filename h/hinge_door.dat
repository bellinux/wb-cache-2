50|$|Opens {{normally}} like {{a traditional}} van sliding door, but unlike most sliding doors where the track ison {{the exterior of}} the vehicle, this type has it inside and {{on the side of the}} door itself. This allows the exterior to remain clean in design and yet the door can slide past the trailing edge of the car. However, this design is very unusual and can only be found on the Mitsubishi RVR (Space Runner, not ASX). Invented by Mitsubishi Motors, it was designed because the RVR is a short car compared to the size of the siding door, making it incapable of having a track on {{the exterior of the}} car. Thus, the inner-track mechanism was used so the sliding door can slide open wide enough to let passengers enter and exit the car easily. The new Mitsubishi EK Wagon/Nissan Otti also uses this type of sliding door, but has it only on one side while the driver's side door of the back seats is a normal <b>hinge</b> <b>door.</b> The sliding door of the EK wagon is also electric-powered.|$|E

40|$|Purpose To {{investigate}} {{the prevalence of}} anatomical and surgical findings and complications in maxillary sinus floor elevation surgery, and to describe the clinical implications. Patients and Methods One hundred consecutive patients scheduled for maxillary sinus floor elevation were included. The patients consisted of 36 men (36 %) and 64 women (64 %), {{with a mean age}} of 50 years (range, 17 to 73 years). In 18 patients, a bilateral procedure was performed. Patients were treated with a top <b>hinge</b> <b>door</b> in the lateral maxillary sinus wall, as described by Tatum (Dent Clin North Am 30 : 207, 1986). In bilateral cases, only the first site treated was evaluated. Results In most cases, an anatomical or surgical finding forced a deviation from Tatum's standard procedure. A thin or thick lateral maxillary sinus wall was found in 78 % and 4 % of patients, respectively. In 6 %, a strong convexity of the lateral sinus wall called for an alternative method of releasing the trapdoor. The same method was used in 4 % of cases involving a narrow sinus. The sinus floor elevation procedure was hindered by septa in 48 %. In regard to complications, the most common complication, a perforation of the Schneiderian membrane, occurred in 11 % of patients. In 2 %, visualization of the trapdoor preparation was compromised because of hemorrhages. The initial incision design, ie, slightly palatal, was responsible for a local dehiscence in 3 %.

40|$|Animal models, {{particularly}} rodents, are {{the foundation}} of pre-clinical research to understand human diseases and evaluate new therapeutics, and {{play a key role}} in advancing biomedical discoveries both on Earth and in space. The National Research Councils Decadal survey emphasized the importance of expanding NASAs life sciences research to perform long duration, rodent experiments on the International Space Station (ISS). To accomplish this objective, flight hardware, operations, and science capabilities were developed at NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) to enhance science return for both commercial (CASIS) and government-sponsored rodent research. The Rodent Research program at NASA ARC has pioneered a new research capability on the International Space Station and has progressed toward translating research to the ISS utilizing commercial rockets, collaborating with academia and science industry, while training crewmembers to assist in performing research on orbit. Throughout phases of these missions, our practices, hardware and operations have evolved from tested to developed standards, and we are able to modify and customize our procedure and operations for mission specific requirements. The Rodent Research Habitat is capable of providing a living environment for animals on ISS according to standard animal welfare requirements. Using the cameras in the Habitat, the Rodent Research team has the ability to perform daily health checks on animals, and further analyze the collected videos for behavioral studies. A recent development of the Rodent Research hardware is inclusion of enrichment, to provide the animals the ability to rest and huddle. The Enrichment Hut is designed carefully for adult mice (up to 35 week old) within animal welfare, engineering, and operations constraints. The Hut is made out of the same stainless steel mesh as the cage interior, it has an ingress and an egress to allow animals move freely, and a <b>hinge</b> <b>door</b> to allow crewmembers remove the animals easily. The Rodent Research team has also developed Live Animal Return (LAR) capability, which will be implemented during Rodent Research- 5 mission for the first time. The animals will be transported from the Habitat to a Transporter, which will return on the Dragon capsule and splashes down in the Pacific Ocean. Once SpaceX retrieves the Dragon, all powered payloads will be transferred to a SeaVan and transferred to the Long Beach pier. The NASA team then receives the transporter and delivers to a PI-designated laboratory within 120 mile radius of Long Beach. This is a significant improvement allowing researchers to examine animals within 72 hrs. of reentry or to conduct recovery experiments. Together, the hardware improvements and experience that the Rodent Research team has gained working with principal investigators and ISS crew to conduct complex experiments on orbit are expanding capabilities for long duration rodent research on the ISS to achieve both basic science and biomedical objectives...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe vacuum plume effects {{experimental}} system (PES) is {{the first}} experimental system designed to {{study the effects of}} vacuum plume in China. The main equipment, a vacuum chamber of 5. 5 m in diameter and 12. 8 m in length, and structure design of <b>hinged</b> <b>door</b> are described. The finite element method (FEM) is adopted to analyze the static strength and stability of the PES vacuum chamber. It is demonstrated that the static strength and stability are qualified. For the 5. 5 m diameter vacuum chamber door, three design schemes are put forward. After comparisons are made, the single-axis-double-pin <b>hinged</b> <b>door</b> is selected. The FEM is applied to checking its static strength as well as distortions. The results show that the door's distortion and displacement change mainly due to the gravity of the door which leads to its sinking. The calculated displacement is less than 7. 8 mm, while the actual measurement is 5 mm. The single-axis-double-pin <b>hinged</b> <b>door</b> mechanism completely satisfies the design requirements. This innovative structure can be introduced as a reference for the design of large-scale <b>hinged</b> <b>doors...</b>|$|R
