This monograph begins with background topics in acoustics and instrumentation and then focuses on current acoustic emission technology. It covers the overall design and system setups for a test, with a wind turbine blade as the object. Test analysis is discussed {{with an emphasis on}} source location. Three test examples are presented, two on experimental wind turbine blades and one on aircraft <b>fire</b> extinguisher <b>bottles.</b> Finally, the code for a FORTRAN source location program is given {{as an example of a}} working analysis program.

40|$|In all large {{passenger}} transport airplanes, halon <b>fire</b> <b>bottles</b> {{are used to}} extinguish fire in the cargo compartments. Halon as a fire-extinguishing agent, contributes {{to the destruction of}} stratospheric ozone in the atmosphere and it is banned in many countries. FAA considers halon 1301 as an effective firefighting agent due to its low toxicity and noncorrosive properties but because it damages the ozone layer, it has been phased out of production. However, it is still widely used on commercial aircraft until a suitable replacement is found. In this paper we will present an alternative approach to using halon 1301 as a fire fighting paradigm. In the proposed method, nitrogen is first extracted from the atmosphere by using the onboard air separator module it is then cooled, and pressurized into the cargo compartments to suppress any fire. Several methodologies can be used to increase the flow rate from the air separator module, to extinguish fire in cargo compartment...|$|R

40|$|Nitrogen {{is usually}} used to {{increase}} the total pressure of the fluid in aircraft <b>fire</b> suppression <b>bottle.</b> The amount of nitrogen required in the bottle is a significant factor to assure complete and effective discharge into the protected area and {{it depends on the}} solubility of the nitrogen in the fire extinguishing agent. In this article, the Peng-Robinson equation of state (PR EOS) including both the classical van der Waals mixing rule and the Wong-Sandler mixing rule is utilized to correlate the Gas-Liquid Equilibrium (GLE) data from available open published literature and to analyze the solubility of nitrogen in halon alternatives such as HFC 227 ea (C 3 HF 7), CF 3 I, FC 218 (C 3 F 8), and HFC 125 (C 2 HF 5) with Halon 1301 (CF 3 Br) as a reference. A new method is proposed to compute the adjustable interaction parameters in the van der Waals mixing rule and in the Wong-Sandler mixing rule based on the measurements of nitrogen required to pressurize the <b>fire</b> suppression <b>bottle</b> to a specified equilibrium pressure at room temperature. Results show that the PR EOS reproduces the GLE data very well with both van der Waals mixing rule and the Wong-Sandler mixing rule and it is then utilized to predict the temperature dependence of the Henry’s law constants of nitrogen dissolved in the fire extinguishing agents. The PR EOS with van der Waals mixing rule is much more appropriate for determining the Henry’s constants than that with the Wong-Sandler mixing rule and the results calculated by the current model are used to establish a new correlation for the Henry’s law constants. This correlation will be very helpful for <b>fire</b> extinguishing <b>bottle</b> designers to acquire the pressure-temperature relationships for the mixture of nitrogen and agents...|$|R

40|$|Top-level {{military}} aircraft specifications typically require operational performance capability over a broad temperature range. For example, V- 22 requires such capability for any exterior ambient atmosphere temperature between- 65 °F (- 54 °C) and 125 °F (52 °C) and an interior ambient atmosphere temperature between- 65 °F (- 54 °C) and 160 °F (71 °C) [1]. In developing the temperature envelope for future aircraft specifications, acquisition officials and technical experts will derive requirements from guidance documents [2, 3], which may likely {{be used to}} also derive development and testing requirements for aircraft systems, subsystems, and components (e. g., nacelle fire suppression systems, nacelle <b>fire</b> <b>bottles,</b> etc.). In previous aircraft acquisitions, a requirements document [4] was used to develop aircraft temperature envelope requirements. Therefore, {{what was once a}} requirement is now guidance, thus allowing future military acquisition program managers flexibility in specifying realistic requirements. The temperature data that is recommended to define the low and high temperature extremes for airborne systems are world-wide air environments (WWAE) that are described in [2] (and previously [4]) as values with a 1 %, 5 %, 10 % and 20 % frequency of occurrence.
