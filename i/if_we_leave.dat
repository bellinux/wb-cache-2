25|$|Because of the {{importance}} of Iraq, the potential for catastrophe, and the role and commitments of the United States in initiating events that have led to the current situation, we believe it would be wrong for the United States to abandon the country through a precipitate withdrawal of troops and support. A premature American departure from Iraq would almost certainly produce greater sectarian violence and further deterioration of conditions, leading to a number of the adverse consequences outlined above. The near-term results would be a significant power vacuum, greater human suffering, regional destabilization, and a threat to the global economy. Al Qaeda would depict our withdrawal as a historic victory. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>leave</b> and Iraq descends into chaos, the long-range consequences could eventually require the United States to return.|$|E
2500|$|Thompson {{believed}} that the United States should be looking beyond the present situation in Iraq: [...] "whether we leave there under our own terms or not, it's {{still going to be}} a very dangerous world. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>leave</b> there under bad circumstances, we're going to have a haven down there for terrorists. The whole area, I'm afraid, will become nuclearized." ...|$|E
2500|$|... where [...] is {{the width}} of the lens, {{changing}} in each point with a shape that is the same of [...] because [...] and n are constants. In other words, {{in order to get a}} focusing effect we just have to introduce a phase change of such a shape, but we are not obliged to change the width. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>leave</b> the width L fixed in each point, but we change the value of the refractive index [...] we will get exactly the same effect, but with a completely different approach.|$|E
6000|$|... "Wait and see!" [...] she chanted ironically. [...] "Wait and see! <b>If</b> <b>we</b> must <b>leave</b> {{the dear}} country--then adieu!" [...] And she gravely bowed to an {{imaginary}} England.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{what would}} happen to us <b>if</b> <b>we</b> did <b>leave</b> the yacht?" [...] said another. [...] "We might simply have to remain at Kingston until you returned. Oh no, we wouldn't think of it!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Madame de Lescure {{immediately}} {{jumped at}} the proposal. [...] "For heaven's sake, Arthur, do so, if it be possible," [...] said she; [...] "it will be the greatest relief. I do not think we should ever get across to the other boat, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> once <b>leave</b> this." ...|$|R
60|$|PICKERING. I say: Mrs. Pearce will row <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>leave</b> {{these things}} lying {{about in the}} drawing-room.|$|E
6000|$|... "Even <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>leave</b> {{the masses}} out of account, {{it is still}} rather more than {{doubtful}} {{if there is any}} secular intellectual growth." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Aunt Pullet, [...] "it'll {{perhaps be}} safer {{for the girls}} to come; they'll be {{touching}} something <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>leave</b> 'em behind." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All {{except what}} we need {{for a couple of}} months. The boys can send us more <b>if</b> <b>we</b> {{conclude}} to <b>leave</b> the quiet little place we're bound for." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A unique {{idea for}} the groundwork of a scenario. It unfolds itself all before me. I'll borrow part of the title from Moliere. We'll call it 'Les Fourberies de Scaramouche,' and <b>if</b> <b>we</b> don't <b>leave</b> the audiences of Maure and Pipriac with sides aching from {{laughter}} I'll play the dullard Pantaloon in future." ...|$|R
60|$|EDSTASTON. By everybody. By {{the most}} unutterable swine. And <b>if</b> <b>we</b> do not <b>leave</b> this abominable city now: do you hear? now; I shall be called darling by the Empress.|$|R
6000|$|... “Yes, and <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>leave</b> {{him out in}} {{the cold}} he may be more hard-hearted than ever,” added Gus, {{with a certain amount of}} worldly wisdom.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{all well}} enough to talk so, Randy," [...] was the elder brother's {{cautious}} response. [...] "But where are we to go <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>leave</b> here?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, dearest, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>leave</b> it, it will,--in a {{month or}} two. We can do nothing by interference. Remember the old saying, You cannot touch pitch without being defiled." ...|$|E
60|$|Yes, {{there were}} all the {{materials}} for the catastrophe--the cannon, the powder, the shot. But {{to say that the}} Persians must have conquered the Medes, even if Cyrus had never lived, is to say, as too many philosophers seem to me to say, that, given cannon, powder, and shot, it will fire itself off some day <b>if</b> <b>we</b> only <b>leave</b> it alone long enough.|$|R
30|$|We can {{publicly}} debate educational {{problems in}} a way {{much more likely to}} increase our understanding of education and each other than <b>if</b> <b>we</b> were to <b>leave</b> the management of schools to…enlightened experts” (Gutmann, 1999. p. 11).|$|R
6000|$|And {{then she}} fell into the same deadly gloom; but I think she had almost a wild animal's longing for solitude; for she made a solemn promise not to attempt her life <b>if</b> <b>we</b> would only <b>leave</b> her alone! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think, Helène, {{if you are}} ready, we {{had better}} go," [...] he said. [...] "It is nearly half-past twelve, and we shall escape the crush <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>leave</b> at once." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We can't {{take him}} with us, and <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>leave</b> him behind he {{will only be}} up to more evil," [...] said Dick. [...] "We ought to turn {{him over to the}} British authorities." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, you foolish person, {{is there}} not the woman up the village that has just brought another fool into the world, and will she not need sack and caudle, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>leave</b> some of our wine?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It will be enough. Unluckily, {{the tide}} is ebbing yet, and {{although}} there's not much rise and fall, I don't know <b>if</b> <b>we</b> can both <b>leave</b> the boat. It would be awkward if she grounded and we couldn't shove her off." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{a case of}} fire, lads! Jump to it {{for what}} {{provisions}} an' water can be got out in a hurry! There's no time to be lost <b>if</b> <b>we</b> want to <b>leave,</b> for most likely the hold is one mass of flame." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I wasn't {{thinking}} of that," [...] continued the first; [...] "I am troubled about our course. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> could <b>leave</b> the Pleiades {{a little more}} to the right, striking a middle course between Boötes and the ecliptic, we should find it all plain sailing as far as the solstitial colure. But once we get into the Zodiac upon our present bearing, we are certain to meet with shipwreck before reaching our aphelion." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Precisely. If {{he thinks}} the formula is in England, Fischer will stay in England. If he thinks that it has gone abroad he will go abroad. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>leave</b> him free we can watch which he does." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{never will}} under direct opposition--she is too high-spirited for that; but <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>leave</b> it alone, {{and they are}} unpledged, there is a fair chance of her seeing the folly both for her and for him." ...|$|E
6000|$|Jake {{grinned and}} pulled his horse round a hole. [...] "They're all cleverer than we think. Sometimes it's an {{advantage}} and sometimes a drawback. Anyhow, I guess I won't meddle again. Carrie will make good <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>leave</b> her alone----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There are {{chances in}} favor of our bein' {{able to do this}} without interferin' with the work set for us by the commodore; but there isn't much hope for the sailor if he swims over to the Tangiers an' fails of findin' us waitin' for him. You say he'll be hanged if they catch him tryin' to desert. I don't believe I could sleep well nights <b>if</b> <b>we</b> should <b>leave</b> this place, an' he met with his death." ...|$|R
30|$|The {{need for}} orchid {{conservation}} is paramount <b>if</b> <b>we</b> are to <b>leave</b> {{to future generations}} the rich and wildly fascinating orchid legacy we all enjoy today. Without effective conservation actions…, threatening process will continue to militate against the survival of rare orchids, resulting in their continued degradation and inevitable extinction.|$|R
6000|$|But {{it was not}} {{probable}} that he would let her do so. [...] "Why should I not go with you?" [...] he said. [...] "When I get there I {{have nothing to do}} but see him fish. Only <b>if</b> <b>we</b> were to <b>leave</b> him by himself he would not be happy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{will die}} <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>leave</b> him here," [...] said Jonas, [...] "for {{he has lost}} his mother now. I think we had better carry him home, if we can, and feed him, till he {{is old enough to}} fly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No; {{she will}} bring evil on us <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>leave</b> her," [...] cried the fierce man. [...] "I am sure {{she is a}} witch. We must carry her with us, {{and when we come}} to a {{convenient}} cliff, toss her into the sea." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The idea is a {{good one}} as far as it goes. But you see at present we are in a very strong position. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>leave</b> this and they {{overtake}} us in the woods, we shall not have the advantages that we have here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For my part I have {{no desire}} for food," [...] I cried, almost irritated because he had brought up the matter at such a time, when it was as <b>if</b> <b>we</b> had taken <b>leave</b> of an old friend. [...] "It seems {{to me as if}} I should never be hungry again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, indeed!" [...] said Mrs. Corey; [...] "are they so much attached? But I can quite {{understand}} it. My {{children would be}} heart-broken too <b>if</b> <b>we</b> were to <b>leave</b> the old place." [...] She turned to Penelope. [...] "But you must think of the lovely new house, and the beautiful position." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Besides," [...] added Leo, [...] "it {{would not}} be polite to Chingatok's countrymen <b>if</b> <b>we</b> were to <b>leave</b> them {{immediately}} after arriving. Perhaps they would not let us go, so I fear that we shan't gain {{the end of our}} journey yet a while, but that does not matter much, for we're sure to make it out at last." ...|$|R
