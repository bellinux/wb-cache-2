The objective {{of this study is}} to analyze the effect of locating an <b>inflatable</b> <b>weir</b> over a spillway profile in what regards its hydraulic response. With this purpose, an experimental and a numerical CFD model of a WES original spillway profile are developed, to then include an EPDM weir whose effect is analyzed for different inflation levels. Numerical and experimental results are close and highlight significant variations in the pressure distribution along the spillway, with aeration playing a significant role. This study concludes that the placement of this particular <b>inflatable</b> <b>weir</b> has an overall positive result if conveniently undertaken, but additional studies with different geometries are required to delve in the topic...|$|E

ENGLISH ABSTRACT: General {{objective}} of the study This thesis aims to evaluate the hydraulics of an <b>inflatable</b> <b>weir</b> in its fully inflated position to the almost fully deflated position using different diameter circular weirs with varying discharges, by considering {{the change in the}} weir radius and the dynamic pressures on the weir. In the evaluation, three cylindrical weirs were installed in a 2 m wide flume and tested over various discharges. Methodology The three weirs, one with a 300 mm diameter, another with a 250 mm diameter, and the last one with a 100 mm diameter, were used {{to determine the effects of}} over flow water on the weir as seen in the different stages of the normal operation of an <b>inflatable</b> <b>weir.</b> Simulation involved measurement of the upstream and downstream water levels with the weir height involved at stable over flow conditions. Measurement of pressure variations was done on the weir faces with different water inflow rates to the test flume with three pressure sensors installed on each weir at 0 °, 11. 25 ° and 22. 5 ° from the crest to the downstream. Additionally a single 0. 15 m radius weir was tested for pressures 67. 5 °, 78. 75 ° and 90 ° from weir crest. Water level variation on the downstream of the weir was created by means of a variable tail gate to observe its effects. Results of the investigation The effects of upstream arches, stage, radius of curvature, discharge, pressure, energy losses over the weir and the downstream hydraulic jump were investigated in the inflation and deflation of the <b>inflatable</b> <b>weir.</b> The findings were as follows: ►Based on literature by Chanson and Montes (1998), Shabanlou et al. (2013), Schmockeret al. (2011) and Bahzad et al. (2010), upstream arches have insignificant influence onthe performance of the <b>inflatable</b> <b>weir.</b> There is rather reduced afflux due to the shape ofthe upstream of the weir from the Bernoulli’s equation. This shape of the upstream of theweir also contributes to the transport of sediments Gebhardt et al. (2012). ►Investigation of the discharge coefficient and factors influencing showed that: oAs the weir radius is reduced during the deflation, the unit discharge over each weirincreased with increase in head above the crest. oDischarge coefficient of the <b>inflatable</b> <b>weir</b> increases with the increase in head aboveweir crest, and the discharge coefficient is inversely proportional to the radius ofcurvature of the weir. ►Investigation of pressures on the downstream face of the weir models showed that: oThe negative (suction) pressure acting on the downstream face of the weir becomesincreasingly negative with increase in H/R values. oPoint of separation of nappe was seen with pulsations of pressure of the recordpressure. Generally, energy dissipation over the weir decreases with the decrease in the weir radius and the jump is more stable with the smallest circular weir and can be more accurately determined in the case of a small weir. Conclusions and Recommendations The <b>inflatable</b> <b>weir</b> has a high discharge at its fully inflated position. Its hydraulic performance is largely influenced by inflow head and is inversely proportional to the radius of curvature. Nappe pulsation as seen in the nappe vibrations can cause the vibration of weir. Future research on inflatable weirs should aim to monitor the negative pressure on measuring pressures further down the face of the weir because larger negative pressures are expected to develop after 90 ˚ as with this study...|$|E
