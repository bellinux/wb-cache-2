25|$|Main {{production}} {{was to start}} in 2016 in an 82,300-square-foot (7,646 m²), $26.3 million hangar facility at Lafayette Regional Airport in Louisiana, but the tooling is prepared for assembly in different places in the world. Louisiana offered $8 million in support for 250 new jobs, and started construction of the factory in August 2014 which will then be leased to Bell. The factory opened in August 2015. On May 19, 2016, Bell Helicopter CEO Mitch Snyder announced changes to the production supply chain that include relocating the Bell 505 production to Bell Helicopter's assembly and distribution center in Mirabel, Quebec, Canada. The Lafayette Assembly Center, which was specifically designed to manufacture and deliver the 505, will instead complete Bell 525 sub-assemblies and perform work on Northrop Grumman MQ-8C <b>Fire</b> <b>Scout</b> UAVs.|$|E

2500|$|On 16 October 2014, the Navy {{announced}} that Coronado conducted dynamic interface testing with the MQ-8B <b>Fire</b> <b>Scout</b> unmanned helicopter. [...] The tests familiarized the crew with operating the unmanned aircraft, verified and expanded launch and recovery envelopes, and identified opportunities for envelope expansion to demonstrate future concepts {{of operations for}} the aircraft aboard an LCS, which will use the <b>Fire</b> <b>Scout</b> in all three mission packages. Final Contract Trials (FCT) for the ship were completed in June 2014, and Coronado is scheduled to begin Post Shakedown Availability in October 2014.|$|E
2500|$|From 25 April-16 May 2014, Freedom {{conducted}} the future {{concept of operations}} (CONOPS) for manned and unmanned helicopters aboard littoral combat ships. Operations had the manned MH-60R working together with the unmanned MQ-8B <b>Fire</b> <b>Scout.</b> [...] The demonstration included one MH-60R and one MQ-8B flying with the surface warfare (SUW) mission package installed, intended to provide fleet protection against small boats and asymmetric threats.|$|E
2500|$|DESRON 7 assumed {{tactical}} command of USS Fort Worth (LCS 3) on December 4, 2014. Building on {{the achievements of}} [...] inaugural 10-month deployment to Southeast Asia from March to December 2013, Fort Worth will visit more ports, engage more regional navies during exercises like CARAT and expand LCS capabilities, including embarking and using the MQ-8B <b>Fire</b> <b>Scout</b> unmanned aircraft system. LCSs are optimally sized for the region’s geography and operate well alongside the small, but capable, ships of many Southeast Asian navies.|$|E
5000|$|In May 2011, three MQ-8s were {{deployed}} to northern Afghanistan for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) purposes. During the 2011 {{military intervention in}} Libya, several <b>Fire</b> <b>Scouts</b> were operated on board the [...] by HSL-42 Squadron as part of Operation Unified Protector. On 21 June 2011, a MQ-8 from Halyburton was shot down by pro-Gaddaffi forces during a reconnaissance mission.|$|R
25|$|Rakkestad Flyklubb was {{established}} {{during the winter}} of 1971–72 and bought a Piper Cherokee in April 1972. They built a small wooden hangar next to the runway which they used as their club house. A year later the aircraft was written off in an accident, and replaced with a Piper Challenger. That year the club commenced forest <b>fire</b> <b>scouting</b> services, which provided an important income for the club.|$|R
50|$|In 2017, the MQ-8B {{will receive}} a mine-detection sensor for use in {{littoral}} waters called the Coastal Battlefield Reconnaissance and Analysis (COBRA). The COBRA is designed to detect naval mines {{at a safe distance}} from a Littoral Combat Ship operating in coastal waters, and also has the capability to locate submarines through acoustic detection if they are on or near the surface. COBRA takes the place of the <b>Fire</b> <b>Scout's</b> usual EO/IR sensor.|$|R
2500|$|The Eagle Eye {{prototype}} {{crashed in}} 2006, and Bell {{could not get}} enough interest or money to keep the program going.

2500|$|... 21 June: An {{unmanned}} US Navy MQ-8 <b>Fire</b> <b>Scout</b> {{went down}} over Libya, possibly due to enemy fire. NATO confirmed that they lost radar {{contact with the}} unmanned helicopter as it was performing an intelligence and reconnaissance mission near Zliten. NATO began investigating the crash shortly after it occurred. On 5 August, {{it was announced that}} the investigation had concluded that the cause of the crash was probably enemy fire; with operator or mechanical failure ruled out and the inability of investigators to access the crash site the [...] "logical conclusion" [...] was that the aircraft had been shot down.|$|E
2500|$|As the Gazelle {{continued}} to serve into the 21st century, several major modernisation and upgrade programs were undertaken, commonly adding new avionics {{to increase the}} aircraft's capabilities. [...] Aerotec group offered an overhaul package to existing operators, which comprised upgraded ballistic protection, night vision goggles, new munitions including rockets and machine guns, and 3D navigational displays; as of 2013, Egypt {{is said to be}} interested in upgrading their domestically built Gazelles. QinetiQ developed a Direct Voice Input (DVI) system for the Gazelle, the DVI system enables voice control over many aspects of the aircraft, lowering the demands placed upon the crew. In September 2011, QinetiQ and Northrop Grumman proposed outfitting former British Gazelles with autonomous flight management systems derived from the Northrop Grumman MQ-8 <b>Fire</b> <b>Scout,</b> converting them into unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)s to meet a Royal Navy requirement for an unmanned maritime aerial platform.|$|E

2500|$|Fort Worth {{departed}} her homeport of San Diego on 17 November 2014 for a 16-month rotational deployment to Singapore {{in support}} of the U.S. Navy's strategic rebalance to the Pacific. The ship is the first LCS to deploy under the [...] "3-2-1" [...] manning concept, swapping fully trained crews roughly every four months. Under this concept three rotational crews will support two LCS ships and maintain one deployed ship. Fort Worth also deploys with an aviation detachment from Helicopter Maritime Strike Squadron 35 (HSM-35) [...] "Magicians", the U.S. Navy's first composite expeditionary helicopter squadron. The aviation detachment will consist of one MH-60R Seahawk helicopter and one Northrop Grumman MQ-8 <b>Fire</b> <b>Scout</b> unmanned autonomous helicopter. Fort Worth reached the 7th Fleet area of responsibility on 4 December 2014. The ship is expected to remain in the area until March 2016. It will be the longest deployment of a U.S. warship in 42 years, since the aircraft carrier [...] was under way for 327 days in 1973. The long deployment is to stress the Navy’s logistics capabilities and identify potential problems. Once the deployment is completed, Freedom will take the ship's place, returning to the area again.|$|E

The <b>Fire</b> <b>Scout</b> significantly contributes to the LCS's primary mission roles of anti-submarine warfare, surface warfare and mine warfare. The ship's modular nature is complemented by the Fire Scout's own modular mission payloads.
