40|$|Background: At {{the present}} time, the {{government}} is considering to establish the independent financing system for essential medicines (EMs). However, it {{is still in the}} exploration phase. The objectives of this study were to calculate and estimate financing amount of <b>EMs</b> <b>in</b> China in 2014 and to provide data evidence for establishing financing mechanism of EMs. Methods: Two approaches were adopted in this study. First, we used a retrospective research to estimate the cost of <b>EMs</b> <b>in</b> China in 2014. We identified all the 520 drugs listed in the latest national EMs list (2012) and calculated the total sales amount of these drugs in 2014. The other approach included the steps that first selecting the 109 most common diseases in China, then identifying the EMs used to treat them, and finally estimating the total cost of these drugs. Results: The results of the two methods, which showed the estimated financing amounts of <b>EMs</b> <b>in</b> China in 2014, were 17, 776. 44 million USD and 19, 094. 09 million USD, respectively. Conclusions: Comparing these two results, we concluded that the annual budget needed to provide for the <b>EMs</b> <b>in</b> China would be about 20 billion USD. Our study also indicated that the irrational drug use continued to plague the health system with intravenous fluids and antibiotics being the typical examples, as observed in other studies...|$|R

40|$|The cephalic gap gene empty spiracles (ems) encodes a {{homeodomain}} {{transcription factor}} {{that is essential}} for the regional specification of the early embryonic brain in Drosophila. This thesis presents the analysis of ems expression and function during larval and pupal development of the brain. In the late larval brain eight neuroblast lineages express <b>ems.</b> <b>In</b> seven lineages <b>ems</b> is only transiently expressed and expression disappears in the early pupa. In contrast, all adult-specific neurons of the medial-most lineage (EM lineage) continuously express ems throughout larval and pupal development {{as well as in the}} adult brain. In a first study (Chapter II) we have investigated the function of <b>ems</b> <b>in</b> the <b>EM</b> lineage. The cell bodies of the EM lineage are located ventral to the antennal lobes from where they extend fine neurite arborizations into the suboesophageal ganglion and a prominent projection into the superior medial protocerebrum. Clonal mutant analysis of the adult-specific cells <b>in</b> the <b>EM</b> lineage has revealed three distinct functions of ems during larval development. First, the number of cells was reduced by half. This could be rescued by blocking apoptosis <b>in</b> <b>ems</b> mutant clones suggesting a function of <b>ems</b> <b>in</b> cell survival. Second, all mutant clones extended undirected misprojections into the surrounding neuropile. Third, the projection into the superior protocerebrum was missing in half of the clones. A closer examination of the projection patterns of ems mutant single-cell clones demonstrated that ems is required cell-autonomously in postmitotic neurons for the correct extension of the protocerebral projection. In our second study (Chapter III) we have examined the role of <b>ems</b> <b>in</b> development of the olfactory projection neurons (PNs). Two of the transiently expressing ems-positive lineages in the larval brain correspond to the adult-specific anterodorsal and lateral PN lineages (adPN and lPN, respectively). Clonal mutant analysis of the GH 146 -positive PNs revealed different roles of <b>ems</b> <b>in</b> the two lineages. In the adPN lineage transient ems expression is required for precise dendritic targeting. In the lPN lineage ems function is necessary for the formation of the correct number of progeny during larval development. Furthermore, timely down-regulation of ems expression is necessary for the proper connectivity of PNs. The finding that ems and its mammalian homologs Emx 1 /Emx 2 are both expressed in second order olfactory PNs suggests conserved genetic mechanisms for the specific relay of olfactory information to higher brain centres...|$|R

40|$|Rapid eye {{movement}} (REM) sleep occurs throughout {{a relatively large}} proportion of early development, and normal REM activity appears to be required for healthy brain development. The {{eye movement}}s (EMs) observed during REM sleep are the most distinctive characteristics of this state. EMs are used as an index of neurological function postnatally, but no specific indices of EM activity exist for fetuses. We aimed to identify and characterize EM activity, particularly EM bursts suggestive of REM periods, in fetuses with a gestational age between 24 and 39 weeks. This cross-sectional study included 84 normal singleton pregnancies. Fetal EMs were monitored using real-time ultrasonography for 60 min and recorded as videos. The videos were manually converted into a time series of EM events, which were then analyzed by piecewise linear regression for various EM characteristics, including EM density, EM burst density, density of <b>EMs</b> <b>in</b> <b>EM</b> bursts, and continuous EM burst time. Two critical points for EM density, EM burst density, and density of <b>EMs</b> <b>in</b> <b>EM</b> bursts were evident at gestation weeks 28 - 29 and 36 - 37. Overall <b>EM</b> activity <b>in</b> human fetuses increased until 28 - 29 weeks of gestation, then again from 36 - 37 to 38 - 39 weeks of gestation. These findings may be useful for creating indices of fetal neurological function for prognostic purposes...|$|R

40|$|The ems/Emx genes encode {{homeodomain}} transcription {{factors that}} have conserved actions in anterior embryonic patterning in bilaterian animals ranging from insects to mammals. Recently, genes of the ems/Emx family {{have been identified in}} cnidarians raising the possibility that some of their develomental functions might be conserved throughout the Eumetazoa. To determine to what extent functions of a cnidarian ems/Emx protein have been retained across phyla, we carried out cross-phylum rescue expression experiments in which the coral Acropora emx-Am gene was misexpressed <b>in</b> Drosophila <b>ems</b> mutants. Our findings demonstrate that coral emx-Am can substitute for fly <b>ems</b> <b>in</b> embryonic head development and rescue the open head defect and the loss of segmental engrailed expression domains <b>in</b> Drosophila <b>ems</b> mutants. <b>In</b> contrast, the coral emx-Am gene can not substitute for fly <b>ems</b> <b>in</b> embryonic brain development. Even when a hexapeptide motif of the type present <b>in</b> the Drosophila <b>ems</b> gene is inserted into the coral emx-Am gene, rescue of the developmental brain defects <b>in</b> fly <b>ems</b> mutants fails.
