40|$|My Masters by Research project took me {{from the}} insular environs of the {{jewellery}} workbench to the social environs of urban Auckland and Taipei. Directed by the writing of contemporary jewellers, such as Roseanne Bartley and Jason Wade, I examined methods of process-driven making, participation, collaboration, the ‘performative’, and social value. Through research I was drawn to a revised and expanded arena where jewellery processes may relate to an entire social body, rather than being limited {{to the creation of}} objects pertaining to a single body. This investigation of social value and meaning latent in contemporary jewellery practice engaged me in unanticipated notions of preciousness. The research culminated {{in the creation of a}} counter-memorial in the Auckland suburb of Waterview, a neighbourhood in which 115 houses and a park will be destroyed to make way for a state highway extension. Guided by the model of ‘the urban physiognomist’ as described by Walter Benjamin, discourses on countermemorials articulated by theorist James E. Young, and the work of practitioners such as Jochen Gerz and Rachel Whiteread, I responded to a community confronted by major urban development. Processes typically employed within my jewellery making practice, were transferred and applied within the setting of a public walkway. 115 elements (core samples from homes to be destroyed or reflective car head and tail light plastic) were implanted, without official sanction, in trees in the northern end of Oakley Creek Walkway.

Before the 1971, lacking of the geological information In Taiwan, the route decision is need to survey in-situ the area and choose the line on the paper maps. Nowadays, the experience engineers judge the route decision by Base Maps, Aerial Photos and Geological Map of 1 : 5000 or 1 : 10000 and interpret route decision. Engineers can survey the path on the spot and decide the most likely line on the paper. Owing to strong capacity on spatial analysis of GIS, the new technology of telemetry and high resolution of images, the GIS is an excellent tool for finding routes by easily obtaining the database map of the National Geographical Information System. After 921 Earthquake, debris flows had continuously occurred in Taiwan. The sabotage of debris flow is as serious as the earthquake. Thus, the route decision passing the mountain area should collect the damage type and model of bridges which suffered from the debris flows. We can use the data as the most important factor to build the model of selecting the best route passing the debris flow area and modeling of disaster assessment. For example, at the Soon-Hoo area of the 8 -th Provincial Highway (28 k~ 30 k), the place nearing the Ta-Chia river had the sabotage of debris flow and bed loads sedimentation [...] This study used The Geographical Information System to investigate the facilitating the changing routes,model of selecting the best route passing the debris flow area and modeling of disaster assessment. Three procedures are preceeding as follows. First, this study used the database of the National Geographical Information System to obtain Geographical Information facilitating the changing routes. Then, the Geographic Information Systems could be used to analyze, overlay, and help to decide the route. Then, the information can interpret potential hazardous debris flow regions of brooks, judge the debris flow regions which helps us for aligning the best route passing the debris flow landslide areas. Finally, We can check the level of the point crossing about the river and highway and by making the hydraulics algorithm. We can design to build the model of selecting the best route passing the debris flow area and modeling of disaster assessment. According to the results of the aforementioned procedures, the National Geographical Information System could be used to analyze, overlay, and improved significantly the quality and effective programming, routing, and decision of space. Then we can use this system to spatiotemporally establish the general model of routing selection. Besides, under the disaster assignment of route decision through the debris flow area, we simply concluded that the Geographic Information Systems could be used to analyze, overlay, and calculate data easily. The techniques of <b>geological</b> <b>information</b> <b>system</b> could be used in operating system model of route decision programming, passing debris flow and performing hydraulics algorithm. Therefore, the GIS which is applied to operate system model of route decision programming passing debris flow area is worthy for extending. 公路選線旨在找出最安全、便捷、經濟、養護容易並符合設計標準之廊道以供興建道路。台灣在 1971 年代以前因圖資缺乏，公路選線須先赴現場踏勘初測再進行紙上定線。現今選線則以 5 千或 1 萬分之一比例尺之類比式像片基本圖、航照圖及地質圖等由有經驗之工程人員以目視判讀進行圖上選線後，再進行平面測量與紙上定線。鑒於GIS技術具有甚強之空間分析能力、遙測技術日新月異，加上影像解析度愈來愈高，選線所需圖資取得愈趨方便，GIS已成為選線之最佳工具。 台灣自 1999 年發生九二一大地震後即不斷發生土石流，並引發嚴重災害，其破壞程度不亞於地震。故山區公路選線，應蒐集土石流對公路橋樑破壞之型態及模式，並整理回饋到以土石流防災作為選線之主要考量因素。 本研究以台 8 線(中橫) 公路上約 2 公里長曾遭大甲溪河砂淤積及嚴重土石流災害之松鶴路段為例，探討GIS用於選線決策模式及山區公路跨越土石流發生區之方式及其防災評估之研究。其步驟有三：首先利用國土資訊系統所建置之資料庫，取得公路改線所需之圖資，再以GIS進行套疊分析以輔助選線。接著就跨越路線之野溪土石流發生潛勢進行查詢或判釋，並以GIS判斷土石流潛勢之區位，以做為公路通過土石流發生區選址之參考。最後檢核公路通過溪流交叉點之地面與溪床相對高程，以決定跨越土石流發生區之方式並完成土石流水理計算，以建立山區公路通過土石流潛勢溪流區防災評估之模式。 依上述步驟推演之結果，以GIS之套疊分析功能可大為提高規劃階段選線之空間決策品質及效率，可作為道路選線時空間決策之模式。另在公路通過土石流潛勢溪流區選址及防災評估上，GIS可經由系統分析功能及簡單之計算工具提供各項數據，以供選址、跨越模式及水理計算所需，故GIS應用於山區公路通過土石流潛勢溪流選線決策模式之構想確為可行。目 錄 摘要…………………………………………………………………………………Ⅰ Abstract……………………………………………………………………………Ⅱ 目錄…………………………………………………………………………………Ⅳ 圖目錄………………………………………………………………………………Ⅴ 表目錄………………………………………………………………………………Ⅵ 第一章 緒論……………………………………………………………………… 1 一、緣起 ………………………………………………………………… 1 二、研究動機…………………………………………………………… 2 三、研究目的…………………………………………………………… 3 四、研究內容…………………………………………………………… 3 第二章 文獻回顧 ……………………………………………………………… 5 一、土石流概述………………………………………………………… 5 二、土石流潛勢溪流之判釋…………………………………………… 16 三、山區公路特性……………………………………………………… 17 四、地理資訊系統（Geographic Information System, GIS）…… 19 第三章 研究材料與方法 …………………………………………… 22 一、試區簡介………………………………………………… 22 二、資料蒐集………………………………………………… 30 三、研究流程………………………………………………… 42 四、研究方法………………………………………………… 43 第四章 結果分析與討論 …………………………………………… 46 一、分析與結果……………………………………………… 46 二、結果討論 ……………………………………………… 63 第五章 結論與建議 ………………………………………………… 65 一、結論……………………………………………………… 65 二、建議……………………………………………………… 66 參考文獻 ……………………………………………………………… 6...|$|E

The second layer of analysis point out that improper management of camping fire taking the majority of the causes 33. 0 %. Followed by incendiarism (21. 9 %), weather related factors (20. 3 %), plantation related (12. 3 %), topographic (8. 0 %) and soil related factors (4. 5 %). The above numbers all indicating that human-cause is the main cause of forest fire. 4. this study, using spatial overlapping analytical method in the GIS together with the relative weight value given by the AHP method, calculate and analyze various graphs against and overlapping each other, the result list and categorize the potential risk rating of forest fires happening into five levels including: Slight danger level(4. 61 %);Cautious level (47. 00 %);Alarming level (33. 04 %); Dangerous level (13. 59 %) and Extremely dangerous level (1. 76 %). 5. The levels of potential forest fires happening categorized in this study have been proven right against the past six years (1994 - 1999) records of forest fire. Both the records and the result of the study indicate that 94 % of time when an area is in the sector of Alarming level, Dangerous level and extremely dangerous level forest fire had happened. Not only has this proven the validity of this study but more so in the value of every day use. 6. The <b>geological</b> <b>information</b> <b>system</b> has the functions of spatial analysis, combining graphs and information gathered. It will provide more precise detailed information needed in the area of forest fire management in the future. If combined with more quantitative information in the structure, it will further enhance the effectiveness of the system. This study has already categorized the potential levels in the Da-Pu working circle using digital photogrammetry, GIS technique and AHP method. The result can be provided as reference for the potential forest fire risk rating in Da-Pu working circle. However as for the building of the forest fire records database is a long-term process, it need further in depth investigation. 森林火災的防救為森林保護之重要工作，基於「預防勝於治療」之理念，有效的預防森林火災，才能避免林火造成的破壞與損失，所以建立森林火災資料庫及劃分潛在森林火災危險等級，實為森林防火之基本工作。 本研究以大埔事業區為範圍，應用數值航測與GIS技術，建立森林火災地理資料庫；利用分析階層程序法建立影響森林火災發生因子之階層架構並計算各影響因子的相對權重；再應用GIS所提供之空間套疊分析功能，劃分大埔事業區潛在森林火災之危險等級。所得之結果如下： 一、 民國 83 - 88 年間，大埔事業區森林火災發生的原因多屬人為因子，其中以蓄意縱火為主要原因，其次為狩獵，再其次為引火不慎。 二、 森林火災地理資料庫的建立，為防範森林火災的基礎。而數值航測製圖因可提供森林火災相關的基本資料，包括向量圖形、影像及DTM等重要空間資訊，此亦為本研究建構相關模式的基礎資料。 三、 經由AHP法問卷分析結果，第一階層環境因素之相對權重值為 45. 1 %，而人為因素則佔 54. 9 %。第二階層之權重值，以使用不慎(33. 0 %) 所佔權重最高，其次依序是蓄意方面(21. 9 %) ，氣候方面(20. 3 %) 、植物方面(12. 3 %) 、地形方面(8. 0 %) 、土壤方面(4. 5 %) 。顯示人為因素為造成森林火災的主因。 四、 本研究應用GIS軟體之空間套疊分析功能，配合AHP法所求得之相對權重，進行計算及多圖層套疊分析，將潛在森林火災危險等級劃分為五級，包括I：輕微級(4. 61 %) 、II：注意級(47. 00 %) 、III：警告級(33. 04 %) 、IV：危險級(13. 59 %) 、V：極危險級(1. 76 %) 。 五、 本研究所建立之潛在森林火災危險等級，經近六年(83 - 88 年) 的森林火災資料驗證結果，顯示在第III級(含) 以上之發生機率達 94 %，可證實本模式除理論基礎外，更具有實用價值。 六、 地理資訊系統因具有空間分析及整合圖形與屬性資料的功能，可提供精確、詳實的資料，在未來森林火災管理上，如整合更豐富的資料結構，將可提高其效用。 本研究應用航測與GIS技術，配合AHP法，劃分大埔事業區森林火災危險等級，將可提供大埔事業區森林火災防範之參考，唯森林火災資料庫的建立，為一長期性的工作，仍有待後續深入的研究。圖目錄 [...] - IV 表目錄 [...] - VI 中文摘要 [...] - 1 英文摘要 [...] - 3 壹、 前言 [...] 6 貳、 前人研究 [...] 8 一、 森林火災之探討 [...] 8 (一) 森林火災的意義與等級 [...] - 8 (二) 森林火災之燃燒狀態 [...] - 8 (三) 影響森林火災發生的因素 [...] - 13 (四) 森林火災相關問題之探討 [...] - 13 二、 地理資訊系統之應用 [...] 16 (一) 地理資訊系統之定義 [...] - 16 (二) 地理資訊系統在森林經營上之應用 [...] - 17 三、 航測製圖 [...] - 19 (一) 航測製圖之意義及發展 [...] - 19 (二) 航測製圖的應用 [...] - 22 (三) GIS 與航測之關係 [...] - 23 四、 分析階層程序（AHP）法 [...] - 24 (一) AHP法之緣起 [...] 24 (二) AHP法之理論基礎 [...] 25 (三) AHP法之應用 [...] 27 參、 研究材料與方法 [...] 28 一、 研究地區概況 [...] 28 (一) 大埔事業區地理位置 [...] - 28 (二) 氣候、氣溫、降雨 [...] - 29 (三) 植物分佈 [...] - 30 二、 研究設備及材料 [...] 31 (一) 研究設備 [...] - 31 (二) 研究材料 [...] - 31 三、 研究流程及假設 [...] 34 (一) 研究流程 [...] - 34 (二) 研究假設 [...] - 34 四、研究方法 [...] - 36 (一) 森林火災現況分析 [...] - 36 (二) 各類主題圖之建立 [...] - 36 (三) 地理資訊系統資料庫建立 [...] - 38 (四) 影響森林火災發生因素之篩選 [...] - 39 (五) 問卷設計及調查 [...] - 39 (六) 潛在森林火災危險等級區之劃分 [...] - 48 肆、 結果與討論 [...] 50 一、 大埔事業區歷年森林火災分析 [...] 50 (一) 森林火災統計分析 [...] - 50 (二) 大埔事業區森林巡護現況 [...] - 54 二、 大埔事業區地理資料庫之建立 [...] 55 (一) 地種分類 [...] - 55 (二) 地形資料分析 [...] - 56 (三) 主要林型分佈 [...] - 59 (四) 土壤性質與濕度 [...] - 62 (五) 公共設施分佈 [...] - 64 (六) 氣象資料分析 [...] - 67 (七) 水系分佈 [...] - 71 (八) 影像資料之建立 [...] - 72 三、 影響森林火災發生因素之篩選 [...] 73 (一) 影響森林火災發生因素之羅列 [...] - 73 (二) 森林火災重要影響因子之選取 [...] - 77 四、 問卷調查結果及相對權重之分析 [...] 81 (一) 問卷調查結果 [...] - 81 (二) 相對權重之分析 [...] - 82 五、 潛在森林火災危險等級之劃分 [...] 85 (一) 確立森林火災發生因子之評估準則 [...] - 85 (二) 環域分析 [...] - 88 (三) 套疊分析 [...] - 90 六、 討論 [...] 93 伍、結論與建議 [...] - 95 陸、引用文獻 [...] - 98 附錄 [...] - 10...|$|E
40|$|This article {{presents}} a geographical <b>information</b> <b>system</b> (GIS) which manages geotechnical {{data obtained from}} detailed geotechnical surveys {{as well as from}} in situ observations in Athens, Greece. Thoroughly examined data from more than 2, 000 exploratory boreholes and trial pits located in the wider area of Athens have been incorporated using a relational database system. From the analysis of these results, thematic maps are compiled to illustrate the distribution of engineering <b>geological</b> <b>information</b> (e. g. the depth of the ""Athens schist"" head).

40|$|The use {{of digital}} <b>information</b> in <b>geological</b> fields is {{becoming}} very important. Thus, informatization in geological surveys should not stagnate {{as a result}} of the level of data accumulation. The integration and sharing of distributed, multi-source, heterogeneous <b>geological</b> <b>information</b> is an open problem in geological domains. Applications and services use geological spatial data with many features, including being cross-region and cross-domain and requiring real-time updating. As a result of these features, desktop and web-based geographic <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> (GISs) experience difficulties in meeting the demand for <b>geological</b> spatial <b>information.</b> To facilitate the real-time sharing of data and services in distributed environments, a GIS platform that is open, integrative, reconfigurable, reusable and elastic would represent an indispensable tool. The purpose of this paper is to develop a geological cloud-computing platform for integrating and sharing <b>geological</b> <b>information</b> based on a cloud architecture. Thus, the geological cloud-computing platform defines geological ontology semantics; designs a standard <b>geological</b> <b>information</b> framework and a standard resource integration model; builds a peer-to-peer node management mechanism; achieves the description, organization, discovery, computing and integration of the distributed resources; and provides the distributed spatial meta service, the spatial information catalog service, the multi-mode geological data service and the spatial data interoperation service. The <b>geological</b> survey <b>information</b> cloud-computing platform has been implemented, and based on the platform, some geological data services and geological processing services were developed. Furthermore, an iron mine resource forecast and an evaluation service is introduced in this paper...|$|R
40|$|Pipelines {{and other}} linear {{structures}} often cover large distances across topographically and geologically varied ground. In the last decade, or so, <b>geological</b> <b>information</b> {{has started to}} become available in digital form for countries and regions. This enables a wide-range of users, including pipeline operators, to access interpreted geohazard information {{not only for the}} construction of new linear infrastructure, but also to assess a range of geological risks to existing linear infrastructure that might have been constructed before such information was available. Examples of the use of such information are discussed in relation to Great Britain’s national natural gas and ethylene pipeline networks and the possible raising of the Thames Estuary flood embankment that helps to protect London from flooding. Future developments in the provision of <b>geological</b> <b>information</b> are discussed, including bespoke <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> in which the outputs are defined by the users rather than the information holders...|$|R
40|$|The {{purposes}} of this thesis are to: (a) provide a review of previous research on the economic value of <b>geological</b> <b>information,</b> including the identification of important lessons from such work: and (b) assess the current use and non-use of <b>geological</b> <b>information</b> in Swedish municipalities. The thesis consists of three papers all related to the assessment or adoption of <b>geological</b> <b>information.</b> Paper I provides a review of previous research on the economic value of <b>geological</b> <b>information</b> and other earth observations as well as related products, services and infrastructure. Furthermore, the paper identifies important lessons and issues that require increased attention in future research. The review of prior research shows that significant economic benefits {{are attached to the}} use of <b>geological</b> <b>information.</b> The value of <b>geological</b> <b>information</b> has typically been measured in terms of avoided costs. Still, it is difficult to compare results across studies since they differ in scope and make alternative assumptions concerning which sectors to cover. Furthermore, previous research is not uniform in its treatment of potential (rather than only existing) users, and it employs varying conceptions of avoided costs. The paper concludes that future research should devote more attention to the public and experience good characteristics of this type of information, thus highlighting the preconditions for information adoption as well as addressing the role of potential users. A number of specific methodological challenges also deserve further scrutiny in future research, {{such as the use of}} discount rates and benefit-transfer approaches in the empirical context of <b>geological</b> <b>information.</b> Based on the results of Paper I it is important to also analyze what, beyond technological advances, influences the adoption of <b>geological</b> <b>information.</b> Paper II and III investigate the determinants of adopting <b>geological</b> <b>information</b> in the public sector with an emphasis on Swedish municipalities. Paper II contributes to the literature by theoretical explanations and empirical findings on individual and organizational effects influencing the adoption of <b>geological</b> <b>information.</b> In this paper an information adoption model is proposed and tested against data collected from 677 officials in Swedish municipalities. The model is estimated using linear probability (LPM) and instrument variable generalized method of moment (IV-GMM) approaches. The results suggest that perceived advantages have the largest effect on the likelihood of adopting <b>geological</b> <b>information,</b> but also follow-up education (motivation) and gender are found to affect adoption behavior. In addition, the results also indicate a group effect within working units. Some implications of the findings and future research areas are discussed. Paper III further investigates the adoption of <b>geological</b> <b>information</b> in the public sector by considering social effects (collegial advice), and whether the information is jointly adopted with related information. The related information considered in this paper is other geoinformation such as map data, demographic information concerning population or building information. The empirical analysis builds on the survey sent out to officials at Swedish municipalities. The information adoption model is estimated using probit and bivariate probits. The results suggest that the adoption of <b>geological</b> and related <b>information</b> is a joint and complementary decision. It is also found that collegial advice, perceived skills from education, motivation to adopt, perceived advantage, gender and working unit affect the likelihood of adopting <b>geological</b> <b>information.</b> Godkänd; 2015; 20150212 (eliols); Nedanstående person kommer att hålla licentiatseminarium för avläggande av ekonomie licentiatexamen.

30|$|Geological risk {{evaluation}} reveals {{the uncertainty of}} converting an anticipated resource potential in an identified exploration target into an economic petroleum accumulation prior to drilling. Providing consistent and unbiased estimates of geological risk for all exploration targets {{in an area of}} interest is essential in {{risk evaluation}}. This paper discusses the potential use of an object-based stochastic procedure for geological risk evaluation at the play level. The object-based model of SuperSD, as a data integration tool, can integrate <b>geological</b> <b>information</b> of petroleum <b>system</b> elements that control occurrences of petroleum pools with the spatial correlation characteristics of the discoveries in a play. Other information, such as the estimated total play potential and size characteristics, from conventional resource assessments can be also incorporated into the model as geological constraints. The uncertainty associated with the data and domain knowledge in the predicted pool locations is expressed as a probability map, representing the geological exploration risk of the play. By incorporating all available information and checking the consistency of models with geological constraints, the object-based model improves predictions of petroleum occurrences, thus enhancing the associated risk evaluation. The proposed method was applied to the fractured petroleum play of the western Qaidam Basin in northwestern China in order to illustrate the use of the object-based method for risk evaluation.|$|R
