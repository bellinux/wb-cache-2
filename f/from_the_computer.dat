Jason lunges at the old man, choking him. Wrapping his arms around his younger self, the old man bursts into flames, and the fire consumes them both. Later, Lisa sets to work at the cryonics lab, attempting to reconstruct the chemical compound.|$|E

25|$|Several {{solutions}} to the problem were studied, and in the end Heatherington decided the only practical one was to have the modem operate in two modes.

In the other, command mode, data forwarded <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>computer</b> were instead interpreted as commands. In this way, the modem could be instructed by the computer to perform various operations, such as hang up the phone or dial a number. The modem would normally start up in command mode.|$|E

25|$|The {{main problem}} with {{producing}} such a modem was forwarding commands <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>computer.</b> This could {{be addressed in}} internal modems that plugged directly into the computer's motherboard. Such modems {{had access to the}} computer's main memory, and by dedicating certain memory locations (or registers) to various status readouts or commands, software programs running on the computer could control the modem. This was a straightforward and thus a popular solution; the Novation APPLE-CAT II for the Apple II computer was an early programmable modem of this type.|$|E

By connecting a scanner and a fax-capable modem to the computer, users can preview documents before scanning them and can choose to directly fax or email the scanned documents. The user interface resembles that of 'Windows Mail' with preview pane, tree views etc.|$|E
25|$|The usual {{technique}} for authorities, either public entities such as law enforcement or private organizations like companies, seizing a computer (usually a laptop) {{that they believe}} is being used improperly is to first physically separate the suspect user <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>computer</b> enough {{that he or she}} cannot touch it, to prevent them from closing its lid, unplugging it or typing a command. Once they have done so, they often install a device in the USB port that spoofs minor actions of a mouse, touchpad or keyboard, preventing the computer from going into sleep mode, from which it would usually return to a lock screen which would require a password. One program commonly used for this purpose is Mouse Jiggler.|$|E
