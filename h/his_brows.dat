25|$|Everyone {{can imagine}} how terrified the peasant must have been when he saw Thor making <b>his</b> <b>brows</b> sink down over his eyes; as for what could be seen of the eyes themselves, {{he thought he would}} {{collapse}} at just the very sight. Thor clenched his hands on the shaft of the hammer so that the knuckles went white, and the peasant did as one might expect, and all his household, they cried out fervently, begged for grace, offered to atone with all their possessions.|$|E
2500|$|Rolf Krauss, {{followed}} by Aidan Dodson, suggests that Amenmesse {{was once a}} Kushite Viceroy called Messuwy. In particular, two representations of Messuwy on the temple of Amida allegedly shows that a royal uraeus had been added to <b>his</b> <b>brows</b> in a way consistent with other pharaohs such as Horemheb, Merenptah {{and some of the}} sons of Rameses III. [...] An inscription at the temple of Amada also calls him [...] "the king's son himself" [...] but this may be merely a figure of speech to emphasize Messuwy's high stature as Viceroy under Merneptah. [...] However, Frank Yurco notes that various depictions of Messuwy in several Nubian temples were never deliberately defaced by Seti II's agents compared to the damnatio memoriae meted out to all depictions of another Viceroy of Kush, Kha-em-ter, who had served as Amenmesse's Vizier. This strongly implies that Seti II held no grudge against Messuwy, which would be improbable if Messuwy was indeed Amenmesse. Yurco also observes that the [...] only objects from Messuwy's tomb which identified a Pharaoh all named only Merneptah, Seti II's father, which leads to the conclusion that Messuwy died and was buried in his tomb at Aniba, Nubia, during Merneptah's reign, and could not be Amenmesse.|$|E
