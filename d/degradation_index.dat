Over the past 50 years, interfered {{by the natural}} factors and human activities, the quality of grassland and the carrying capacity declined. It {{is important for the}} rational utilization of grassland resources and the carbon cycle study of terrestrial ecosystem by analyzing human factors on the grassland productivity. The studying sites were divided into 8 land units with relatively homogeneous natural conditions. Then identify the grassland areas interfered and those not interfered by human activities. The sum NDVI of each land unit were obtained by using satellite remote sensing data. The effects of human factors on grassland productivity were got through calculating the relative <b>degradation</b> <b>index</b> of grassland. It showed that the productivity of grassland without anthropogenic interference was much higher than that of anthropogenic interference in the growing season.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} {{a method for}} {{detection}} of glottal clo-sure instants (GCI) in the voiced regions of speech signals. The method is based on periodicity of significant excitations of the vocal tract system. The key idea is the computation of coherent covariance sequence, which overcomes the effect of dynamic range of the excitation source signal, while preserv-ing the locations of significant excitations. The Hilbert enve-lope of linear prediction residual is used as {{an estimate of the}} source of excitation of the vocal tract system. Performance of the proposed method is evaluated in terms of the deviation be-tween true GCIs and hypothesized GCIs, using clean speech and degraded speech signals. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of speech signals in the vicinity of GCIs has significant bear-ing on the performance of the proposed method.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the results of a series of undrained cyclic triaxial tests carried out on four lime-cement stabilized specimens and clay specimen. The shear resistance degradation rate of lime-cement column subjected to cyclic loading simulated from heavy truck was investigated based on stress-controlled test. The influence of lime and cement on the degradation rate was investigated by comparing the behavior of stabilized kaolin and unstabilized kaolin with similar initial condition. The results indicate an increase in degree of degradation as the number of loading cycles and cyclic strain increase. It is observed that the <b>degradation</b> <b>index</b> has approximately a parabolic relationship with the number of cycles. Generally adding lime and cement to the clay will increase the <b>degradation</b> <b>index</b> which means lower degree of degradation. The degradation parameter, t has a hyperbolic relationship with shear strain, but it loses its hyperbolic shape as the soil getting stronger. On the other hand, for unstabilized clay an approximate linear relationship between <b>degradation</b> <b>index</b> and number of cycles was observed and the degradation parameter has a hyperbolic shape with the increase number of cycles.

An adaptive and rescaling scheme is also proposed to balance the influence of these two different regularization constraints and allowing to prevent that a overwhelming importance for one of them prevail over the other in order to efficiently fuse them during the iterative deconvolution process. This hybrid regularization approach, mixing these two constraints and more precisely, favoring a solution image having simultaneously spatial sparseness of edges (with the GGMRF constraint) and sparseness of its frequency DCT coefficients, yields significant improvements in term of image quality and higher ISNR results, comparatively to a single GGMRF or DCT prior model, and leads to competitive restoration results, in benchmark tests, for various level of blur, BSNR and noise <b>degradations.</b> <b>Index</b> Terms — Regularized iterative restoration/deconvolution methods, edge-preserving regularizers, fusion of regularization terms, mix of multiple constraints, generalized Gaussian Markov random field (GGMRF) prior model, discrete cosine transform.

The study area is characterized by gradients in water oxygen concentration, water depth, organic matter (OM) source, primary productivity, and sedimentation rate. Both CI and DI indicate a decline in OM reactivity, with the transition from a more terrestrial to a more marine-dominated sedimentation regime as one moves from the shallow Upper Estuary (23 – 95 m) to the hypoxic, mid-depth Lower Estuary and to the deep (< 400 m), well-oxygenated Gulf. Whereas the CI more accurately reflected OM reactivity in surface sediments and sediments down to 5 cm, the amino acid-based <b>degradation</b> <b>indices</b> (DI and RI) better described degradation in sediments down to 35 cm. Systematic variations in the amino acid composition along the Laurentian Channel confirmed the increased diagenesis of OM with distance from the Upper St. Lawrence Estuary. The ratio of d/l-stereoisomers of alanine increased along the transect, and the co-variation between DI and the d/l-Ala suggest a close coupling between the extent of diagenesis and the accumulation and selective preservation of bacterially-derived cell wall material in the sediments. The same patterns that we observed along the estuarine transect were present down-core in two sediment cores, confirming the robustness of our reactivity indices. Oxygen exposure time of the sediments appears to strongly determine sediment OM reactivity in the St. Lawrence Estuary. The sediment oxygen regime itself is related to the interplay between water column depth, vertical OM flux, and reactivity of settling OM...|$|R

40|$|Boreal lake sediments are {{important}} sites of organic carbon (OC) storage, which have accumulated {{substantial amounts of}} OC over the Holocene epoch; the temporal evolution {{and the strength of}} this Holocene carbon (C) sink is, however, not well constrained. In this study we investigated the temporal record of carbon mass accumulation rates (CMARs), and assessed qualitative changes of terrestrially derived OC in the sediment profiles of seven Swedish boreal lakes, in order to evaluate the variability of boreal lake sediments as a C sink over time. CMARs were resolved on a short-term (centennial) and long-term (i. e. over millennia of the Holocene) time scale, using radioactive lead (210 Pb) and carbon (14 C) isotope dating. Sources and degradation state of terrestrially derived OC were identified and characterized by molecular analyses of lignin phenols. We found that CMARs varied substantially on both short-term and long-term scales, and that the variability was mostly attributed to sedimentation rates and uncoupled from the OC content in the sediment profiles. The lignin phenol analyses revealed that woody material from gymnosperms was a dominant and constant OC source to the sediments over the Holocene. Furthermore, lignin-based <b>degradation</b> <b>indices,</b> such as acid-to-aldehyde ratios, indicated that post-depositional degradation in the sediments was very limited on longer time scales, implying that terrestrial OC is stabilized in the sediments on a permanent basis...|$|R

40|$|Neutrophil-mediated {{degradation}} of bronchial matrix {{has been proposed}} as a pathogenetic factor in bronchiectasis. We hypothe-size that neutrophils, found in abundance in the bronchial lumens of patients with bronchiectasis, are capable of degrading lung matrix proteoglycans and that proinflammatory mediators in bronchial secretions of these patients can enhance the degradative action of neutrophils. We used rat bronchoalveolar proteoglycans entrapped in polyacrylamide gel beads as a substrate for test incubations with neutrophils from healthy volunteers and sputum sol from patients with idiopathic bronchiectasis. Coincubations with specimens of sputum sol and neutrophils showed proteoglycan <b>degradation</b> <b>indices</b> (PDIs) {{in excess of the}} sum of indices due to incubation with either heat-inactivated sputum sol or heat-inactivated neutrophils, suggesting sputum stimulation of the neutrophil response. Mediation of this stimulation by tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -α was suggested because (1) indices for the coincubations correlated with sputum levels of TNF-α and (2) an anti-TNF-α antibody completely attenuated the sputum-stimulated effect. Furthermore, recombinant human TNF-α required accompanying sputum sol to exert an enhancing effect on neutrophil-mediated proteoglycan degradation. Because neutrophil-mediated proteoglycan degradation in the coincubations was inhibited largely (90 %) by Eglin C and much less so (8 % to 20 %) by ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid, we conclude that serine proteases secreted by neutrophils were mainly responsible for {{degradation of}} proteoglycans in the model matrix and that the secretion was stimulated by TNF-α in the presence of cofactors in the bronchial secretions of patients with bronchiectasis. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R

Altogether, 26 sampling stations were chosen to account for different potential exposure to organotin pollution and environmental conditions: from shallow and well-oxygenated waters, shipping routes and river mouths, to deep and anoxic sites. Additionally, the organic carbon content, pigment content, and grain size of all the sediment samples were determined, and some parameters of the nearbottom water (oxygen content, salinity, temperature) were measured as well. Total concentrations of butyltin compounds ranged between 2 and 182 ng Sn g− 1 d. w., whereas phenyltins were below the detection limit. Sediments from the Gulf of Gdańsk and Vistula Lagoon were found moderately contaminated with tributyltin, whereas those from the Szczecin Lagoon were ranked as highly contaminated.

40|$|The fate {{of organic}} carbon in marine sediments is {{closely linked to}} {{atmospheric}} CO 2 concentrations and thus to climate variability over geological time scales. The East China Sea (ECS) is characterized not only by massive terrestrial organic matter (TOM) inputs from the Yangtze (Changjiang) River but also by a shallow (500 km) continental shelf with widespread relict sands, such that it is distinct from other continental margins. We examine the diagenesis of sedimentary TOM and the impacts of relict sands on TOM in the ECS. The results reveal that bulk δ 13 Corg values correlate with terrestrial biomarker concentrations in muddy and accumulative areas; in contrast, depleted δ 13 Corg values around − 24. 5 ‰ co-occur with almost absent terrestrial biomarkers in sandy/erosional areas. We suggest that mixing of contemporary TOM and marine OM dominates in the muddy/accumulative shelf areas, whereas a putative relict OM, associated with relict sands, appears to be significant in many sandy/erosional shelf areas. Given the global occurrence of relict sands, a persistent amount of relict OC (e. g., 0. 1 %) may complicate TOM budget calculations.

40|$|Moon Zoo is {{a citizen}} science project that utilises {{internet}} crowd-sourcing techniques. Moon Zoo users {{are asked to}} review high spatial resolution images from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera (LROC), onboard NASA’s LRO spacecraft, and perform characterisation such as measuring impact crater sizes and identify morphological ‘features of interest’. The tasks are designed to address issues in lunar science and to aid future exploration of the Moon. We have tested various methodologies and parameters therein to interrogate and reduce the Moon Zoo crater location and size dataset against a validated expert survey. We chose the Apollo 17 region as a test area since it offers {{a broad range of}} cratered terrains, including secondary-rich areas, older maria, and uplands. The assessment involved parallel testing in three key areas: (1) filtering of data to remove problematic mark-ups; (2) clustering methods of multiple notations per crater; and (3) derivation of alternative crater <b>degradation</b> <b>indices,</b> based on the statistical variability of multiple notations and the smoothness of local image structures. We compared different combinations of methods and parameters and assessed correlations between resulting crater summaries and the expert census. We derived the optimal data reduction steps and settings of the existing Moon Zoo crater data to agree with the expert census. Further, the regolith depth and crater degradation states derived from the data are also found to be in broad agreement with other estimates for the Apollo 17 region. Our study supports the validity of this citizen science project but also recommends improvements in key elements of the data acquisition planning and production...|$|R
40|$|This work {{shows the}} experimentation’s {{results of a}} {{projected}} instrument based on a Geographical Information System, realized by a research group formed by Italians and Algerians, on occasion of the Masterplan of Medina di Costantina. The SIG, formed by the stratification of the collected data allows the synchronous reading of single buildings information and {{at every level of}} aggregation, block or urban sector, as for instance the residence density with the number building level or the building typology with the level of degradation. The existence of difference data allows disyncrhronous analysis of information, {{in order to understand the}} courses of transformation processes in different time as for example the ones pertinent to the building consistence or the degradation level, useful the definition of urban management. The SIG is very efficient when it is use with the urban and architectonic project. About the urban project, the SIG produces the quality and <b>degradation</b> <b>indexes,</b> that allows to value the single unit level, in accordance with the priority and the classes of the necessary activities. The typology and historic-constructive classes of a district or sector of the city define the units and the ways of the activities, by a process that order and classify the building heritage. About the architectonic project, the SIG produce not only the geometric base within the project must find the real references, but it elaborate also a description of both the territory and the single building, by the formal and typological characterization, supporting the relationships among the single parts...|$|R
