40|$|The {{detection}} of gases via their absorption bands {{in the mid}} infrared portion of the spectrum is discussed. Various fibre optic probe designs suitable for use with Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrometers are described. The probes fabrication and evaluation with various gases, hydrocarbons and flue gas products are described. Porous clad fibres, tapered fibres, special capillary type fibres and fibre fed transmission cells are all used and their minimum detection concentration (MDC) values quoted for various gases. Evanescent wave absorption spectroscopy of relevance to both the porous clad and tapered fibre probes is compared to the direct transmission cell spectroscopy in terms of sensitivity. The poor sensitivity of the tapered fibre probe is attributed to the underfilled local numerical aperture in the sensing region.

40|$|Small {{packaged}} boilers {{are used}} to generate steam or hot water for industrial, commercial and institutional power plants. Due to their small size and relatively small fuel capacity, they have not received the energy saving attention that larger industrial boilers have. That situation is changing as energy deregulation brings gas prices into parity with oil. This paper describes a recent development brought on by these rising fuel costs and the technological break through of low cost microprocessor controls and inexpensive oxygen sensors to measure excess oxygen in the boiler flue gas. The new developments make possible low cost, continuous, automatic optimization of boiler performance by direct control of air/fuel ratio using <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> <b>analysis</b> trim control.

40|$|The {{necessity}} of {{the reduction of}} greenhouse gas emissions, as formulated in the Kyoto Protocol, imposes the need for improving environmental aspects of existing thermal power plants operation. Improvements can be reached either by efficiency increment or by implementation of emission reduction measures. Investments in refurbishment of existing plant components or in plant upgrading by <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> desulphurization, by primary and secondary measures of nitrogen oxides reduction, or by biomass co-firing, are usually accompanied by modernisation of thermal power plant instrumentation and control system including sensors, equipment diagnostics and advanced controls. Impact of advanced control solutions implementation depends on technical characteristics and status of existing instrumentation and control systems {{as well as on}} design characteristics and actual conditions of installed plant components. Evaluation of adequacy of implementation of advanced control concepts is especially important in Western Balkan region where thermal power plants portfolio is rather diversified in terms of size, type and commissioning year and where generally poor maintenance and lack of investments in power generation sector resulted in high greenhouse gases emissions and low efficiency of plants in operation. This paper is intended to present possibilities of implementation of advanced control concepts, and particularly those based on artificial intelligence, in selected thermal power plants in order to increase plant efficiency and to lower pollutants emissions and to comply with environmental quality standards prescribed in large combustion plant directive.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{describes}} the availability {{analysis of a}} generic, post-combustion carbon capture plant. The analysis first establishes the minimum work input required in an ideal plant with a <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> inlet temperature equal to the sink temperature. The analysis shows that the ideal work input is surprisingly low and that, roughly equal amounts of work are required to first separate and then compress the CO 2 contained in a typical <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> stream. The <b>analysis</b> is then extended to include the effects of variable inlet temperature and extraction efficiency. This extended analysis shows {{that there is a}} considerable quantity of available energy in the <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> of a normal power station. Indeed, in principle, carbon capture is theoretically possible without any external work input for fuels of low carbon/hydrogen ratio such as heavy fuel oil and natural gas. When burning coal, the minimum work input would be significantly reduced if the flue gases’ availability were utilized. The final section of the paper compares the actual work input of a variety of carbon cap-ture schemes found in the literature, with the minimum work input for an ideal process. This comparison shows that the techniques presently found in the literature have a low second-law efficiency...|$|R

40|$|Growing {{concerns}} over {{greenhouse gas emissions}} have driven extensive research into new power generation cycles that enable carbon dioxide capture and sequestration. In this regard, oxy-fuel combustion is a promising new technology for capturing carbon dioxide in power generation systems utilizing hydrocarbon fuels. Combustion of a fuel {{in an environment of}} oxygen and recycled combustion <b>gases</b> yields <b>flue</b> <b>gases</b> consisting predominantly of carbon dioxide and water. To capture carbon dioxide, water is condensed, and carbon dioxide is purified and compressed beyond its supercritical state. However, conventional atmospheric oxy-fuel combustion systems require substantial parasitic energy in the compression step within the air separation unit, a <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> recirculation system and carbon dioxide purification and compression units. Moreover, a large amount of <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> latent enthalpy, which has high water concentration, is wasted. Both lower the overall cycle efficiency.

In this thesis, the analysis of an oxy-fuel combustion power cycle that utilizes a pressurized coal combustor is reported.

40|$|Heladhanavi 100 MW Diesel Power Plant in Puttalam, Sri Lanka {{comprises}} of six 18 V 46 Wartsila turbocharged {{air cooled}} engines. Fuel {{consumption of the}} engines varies with the ambient conditions. It has been seen in hotter days fuel consumption is higher comparatively to cooler days. This study was conducted as per the requirement {{to find out the}} reasons behind this variation of the fuel consumption and to quantify the effects on the efficiency with respect to the charge air properties in relation to temperature and humidity. In this study the effect of charge air temperature was analyzed performing two sets of experiments. A combustion analysis experiment (experiment 1) was performed to monitor what happens inside the combustion chamber during day and night times. This is to investigate the cause of efficiency variation and why and how it happens. Simultaneously a fuel consumption test was performed using the direct method with the fuel flow meter and energy dispatch readings taking in to the consideration. A humidity analysis inside the charge air receiver was carried out simultaneously to investigate the humidity effect on the combustion. A <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> <b>analysis</b> test (experiment 2) was performed to determine the efficiency variation in day and night times through the indirect method. Along with this analysis the direct method was followed up to calculate fuel consumption to compare the results from the both tests. A humidity analysis inside the charge air receiver was carried out simultaneously to investigate the humidity effect on the combustion. For all the tests and analysis DG 02 at approximately Rhs: 55, 000 was selected to conduct the measurements as 48, 000 rhs major overhaul was completed recently. All the components in the fuel system such as pumping elements and injectors are in good condition. The cylinder head, liner and piston overhaul was also have been carried out. The experiments were planned so the lots other factors are not affecting the combustion efficiency during the process to isolate the ambient conditions. The experiments were also carried out during day and night times on the same day to minimize other factors such as fuel quality affecting the equations. Always the LHV of the incoming fuel was obtained for calculations to avoid further mistakes. The results are elaborated along with findings from the past studies in the Literature review. It was confirmed the fuel consumption is positively affected by the charge air temperature while the efficiency is negatively affected. From the literature review it was found out the humidity in charge air affects positively on the fuel consumption while efficiency is negatively affected. The charge air temperature affects the ignition delay period so that the peak pressure and then the combustion efficiency. The efficiency improvement is further confirmed by the <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> <b>analysis</b> experiment as the loss in the flue gas reduces in night time comparatively to the day time. At Heladhanavi temperature and humidity in charged air behaves in completely opposite manner in day and night times. During day time temperature is high while humidity is low. For the night time case its vise versa. Finally it can be concluded that under the prevailing ambient conditions at the Heladhanavi Power Plant, Puttalam, Sri Lanka, the effect of charge air temperature is more prominent than the effect of humidity in the combustion process for the Wartsila 18 V 46 diesel engines, as a result the efficiency improves during the night time comparatively to the day time.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the possible application of instrumental methods {{used by the}} British Coal Utilisation Research Association for <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> <b>analysis</b> to detect the con-tamination, by higher oxides of nitrogen, of nitrous oxide (N 3 O) intended for use as an anaesthetic. Two galvanic instruments sensitive to 1 p. pjn. v/v of nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) —or, when supplemented by a pre-oxidizer, of nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide (NO + NOa) —are described; either might be adapted to actuate an alarm. The methods {{are discussed in the}} light of governmental standards of air quality. The possibility of contamination of nitrous oxide by higher oxides of nitrogen may make it desirable for the clinician to have his own means for the routine testing of N 2 O. In considering the highest concentrations of toxic substances in air that will probably not have ill effects on healthy people, the American Con-ference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists has adopted, in its annually revised Table of Threshold Limit Values, a TLV of 5 p. pjn. v/v for NO 3. No limit for NO is included, presum-ably because this would be expected to be oxidized to NO 3. The limit of 5 p. p. m. v/v for NO 2 is accepted in the United Kingdom by H. M. Factory Inspectorate (1966) and for the present purpose a value of not higher than 5 p. p. m. v/v of (NO + NOj) will be assumed as the concentration to which detectors must give an appreciable res-ponse {{if they are to be}} useful to monitor anaes-thetic gases. Considerable experience has been gained by the BCURA of the use of two instruments, the Hersch sensor and the Mast meter, for the deter-mination of higher oxides of nitrogen in flue gas and the opportunity was taken to ascertain whether these instruments would be suitable for the routine monitoring of N 2 O. Both were found capable of detecting as little as 1 p. p. m. v/v of NOj or, if used in conjunction with an oxidizer, of (NO + NO,), in nitrous oxide...|$|E

The waste heat of <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> is used for high-pressure condensate regeneration heating. This reduces high pressure steam extraction from steam turbine and more power is generated. The waste heat recovery of <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> decreases coal consumption. Other approaches for heat recovery of <b>flue</b> <b>gas,</b> direct utilization of <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> energy and indirect <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> heat recovery system, are also considered in this work. The proposed systems coupled with a reference 330 MWe power plant are simulated using equivalent enthalpy drop method. The results show that the additional economizer scheme has the best performance. When the exhaust <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> temperature decreases from 153 ℃ to 123 ℃, power output increases by 6. 37 MWe and increment in plant efficiency is about 1. 89 %.

40|$|Lightweight {{engineering}} plastics {{have been}} increasingly used in automotive applications(3), this tends toward more fuel efficient vehicles(1). Glass reinforced plastics commonly include thermosetting polymers. These cannot be re-moulded, unlike thermoplastics, thus thermoset scrap is currently disposed of in landfill. This is increasingly targeted by legislation(14) and {{is becoming more}} expensive. This thesis describes work to maximise resource recovery from scrap thermoset composites. A review of relevant literature identified thermal processes for treating scrap thermoset composites. Combustion is particularly suitable for the mixed and contaminated materials arising from end of life vehicles. The literature showed that heating glass fibres reduced their properties, which is a concern for any thermal recycling process. The methodology of this work is to recover energy from the composite polymer and reuse the incombustible residues. Two experimental processes are reported: Fluidised Bed Co-combustion of Thermoset Composites with Coal. The common composite filler of calcium carbonate captures the sulphur emissions from the coal combustion. Results show that scrap composites can successfully be burned in a commercial scale fluidised bed. Retention of the sulphur from the coal by the composite filler was up to 75 % of the input. Although a technical success, economic analysis shows this disposal to be unviable compared with similar desulphurisation via crushed limestone. Fluidised Bed Thermal Processing Rig for Recovering Glass Fibres. The incombustible constituents of a crushed Sheet Moulding Compound were released from processing above 400 ° C in the fluidised bed test rig. The reinforcing glass fibres were elutriated as monofilaments, suitable {{for use in a}} veil product, and recovered from the flue gases. Scanning Electron Microscopy showed that the fibres were intact. The tensile strength of fibres from 450 °C processing was reduced by approximately 50 % and by 90 % from 650 °C(73). Strength was also found to reduce with increasing time at a temperature(76). <b>Flue</b> <b>gas</b> <b>analysis</b> showed that carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons were present. This indicated that full combustion did not take place and the associated heat energy lost. Measured nitrogen oxides and sulphur dioxide concentrations were low. After initial testing, the test rig was refined by the incorporation of a Rotating Screen Collector to separate the fillers and fibres. The fibre contamination was reduced by 50 % via this novel equipment. Fibre recovery rates of up to 57 % were achieved. Resin Decomposition Model. Results indicate that the resin endothermic energy of decomposition maintained the temperature of the Sheet Moulding Compound significantly below the bed temperature...|$|E
40|$|The 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAAs) {{required}} the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) {{to determine whether}} the presence of mercury in the stack emissions from fossil fuel-fired electric utility power plants poses an unacceptable public health risk. EPA's conclusions and recommendations were presented in the Mercury Study Report to Congress (1) and the Utility Air Toxics Report to Congress (1). The first report addressed both the human health and environmental effects of anthropogenic mercury emissions, while the second addressed the risk to public health posed by the emission of mercury and other hazardous air pollutants from steam-electric generating units. Given {{the current state of the}} art, these reports did not state that mercury controls on coal-fired electric power stations would be required. However, they did indicate that EPA views mercury as a potential threat to human health. In fact, in December 2000, the EPA issued an intent to regulate for mercury from coal-fired boilers. However, it is clear that additional research needs to be done in order to develop economical and effective mercury control strategies. To accomplish this objective, it is necessary to understand mercury behavior in coal-fired power plants. The markedly different chemical and physical properties of the different mercury forms generated during coal combustion appear to impact the effectiveness of various mercury control strategies. The original Characterization and Modeling of the Forms of Mercury from Coal-Fired Power Plants project had two tasks. The first was to collect enough data such that mercury speciation could be predicted based on relatively simple inputs such as coal analyses and plant configuration. The second was to field-validate the Ontario Hydro mercury speciation method (at the time, it had only been validated at the pilot-scale level). However, after sampling at two power plants (the Ontario Hydro method was validated at one of them), the EPA issued an information collection request (ICR). The ICR required all coal-fired utilities to submit the mercury concentrations in their coal for one year quarterly, and 80 coal-fired power plants were selected to do mercury <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> <b>analysis.</b> It was decided by EPRI and the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) that this project would be suspended until the results of the ICR were known. This report presents the results that were obtained at the two power plants referred to as Sites 111 and E- 29. The EERC teamed with Radian International (now URS Corp.) to do the sampling and analysis at these two power plants...|$|E
40|$|Hydrogen {{has gained}} {{interest}} as fuel {{recently as the}} harmful effects of fossil fuels on the environment can no longer be ignored. Hydrogen, which produces no pollutants, forms the feed for cleaner fuel cells systems currently in use. Fuel cells, although not as economically viable as fossil fuels, have found a foothold in the energy market in various markets like power backup and use in remote locations. Production of hydrogen is still largely done via fossil fuel reforming and this technology has received renewed interest for use with fuel cells in the form of micro- reformers or fuel processors. This study entailed the performance benchmarking of a so called Best-in-Class commercial micro reformer (as available in 2010), the 1 kW WS FLOX Reformer, and was undertaken {{under the auspices of the}} national HySA programme. The study’s focus was primarily on reformate output quality (carbon monoxide concentration), and start up time, thermal efficiency and hydrogen output (15 SCLM). The reformer consisted of a combustion section encased in an outer reforming section consisting of three reactors in series, steam reforming, water gas shift and selective methanation. As-provided temperature control is simplified though the use of only one temperature setpoint in the combustion chamber and temperature control in the CO clean up stages obtained through means of heat transfer with incoming water being evaporated. Combustion takes place through flame combustion or by means of the supplier’s patented FLOX (flameless oxidation) combustion. The purchased FLOX Reformer assembly was integrated into a fully automated unit with all balance of plant components as well as microGC and <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> <b>analysis</b> for measurement of outlet conditions. The FLOX Reformer was tested at multiple combustion temperatures, combustion flowrates, reforming loads and steam-to-carbon ratios to obtain a wide set of benchmark data. From the testing it was found that the reformer was able to produce the necessary 15 SCLM hydrogen with a carbon monoxide purity of less than 10 ppm as required in fuel cells for all testing if the reaction temperatures were within the recommended limits. Intermediary water gas shift analysis showed methane and carbon monoxide conversion in the reforming and water gas shift stages to be identical to thermodynamic equilibrium conversion – 95 % and higher for all temperatures. iii Selective methanation conversion obtained was 99 %, but not always at equilibrium conversion due to increased selective methanation temperatures, where carbon dioxide methanation was also observed at the higher temperatures. Temperature control through heat exchange with incoming water in the CO removal stages was found to be less than ideal as the temperature inside these stages fluctuated dramatically due to inaccuracies in the water pump and a lagged response to flowrate changes. Startup times of less than an hour was observed for multiple combustion flowrates and the reformer boasts a standby function to reduce this to less than half an hour. The thermal efficiency was independently confirmed and tested and found to be higher than 70 % for flame combustion and on par with other commercially available fuel processors. The suppliers trademark FLOX combustion only reaching 65 % due to decreased combustion efficiency...|$|E
