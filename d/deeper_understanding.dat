5|$|In {{an effort}} to allow the general public to gain a <b>deeper</b> <b>understanding</b> about THSR, THSRC {{provides}} station tour guides who educate visitors about its operation and service. In addition, professional organizations are also permitted to visit the depots and OMC (Operational Management Center) to gain hands-on knowledge about THSR. In 2011, THSRC received 281 groups {{with a total of}} 10,700 people. It also continues to actively conduct experience sharing with its fellow railway transportation operators to enhance the quality of public transportation and create better planning, design and service. By engaging with industry peers, THSRC can pinpoint areas of improvement, with the continual aim of providing high-quality services to its passengers.|$|E
40|$|An {{empirical}} {{study is}} reported which identified and compared a <b>deep</b> <b>understanding</b> {{of the concept}} of an information system (IS) with the various levels of understanding of a group of undergraduate IS students. The aim was to identify the educationally critical aspects of the <b>deep</b> <b>understanding.</b> The study was significant in that the educationally critical aspects are not known, yet have significant implications for IS education and practice. Without addressing the critical aspects in teaching and learning about IS the development of an appropriate <b>deep</b> <b>understanding</b> by students is unlikely. The production of entry-level IS practitioners without a <b>deep</b> <b>understanding</b> {{of the concept of}} an IS is logically likely to have adverse implications for IS development projects...|$|R

5|$|In the infancy of the hacker {{subculture}} and {{the computer}} underground, criminal convictions were rare because there was an informal code of ethics {{that was followed by}} white hat hackers. Proponents of hacking claim to be motivated by artistic and political ends, but are often unconcerned about the use of criminal means to achieve them. White hat hackers break past computer security for non-malicious reasons and do no damage, akin to breaking into a house and looking around. They enjoy learning and working with computer systems, and by this experience gain a <b>deeper</b> <b>understanding</b> of electronic security. As the computer industry matured, individuals with malicious intentions (black hats) would emerge to exploit computer systems for their own personal profit.|$|E
5|$|A {{major element}} of {{gameplay}} is the optional discovery and collection of manuscript pages from Alan Wake's latest novel—Departure. Although Wake does not remember writing this book, its storyline {{seems to be}} becoming real around him. These readable manuscript pages are scattered around the game world, out of chronological order; they often describe scenes {{that have yet to}} occur and act as warning and instructions for proceeding through upcoming challenges. Other optional collectibles include coffee thermoses scattered around the game world (100 in all), as well as discovering television sets which show different episodes of the fictional Night Springs series, radios airing talk and music from Bright Falls' local radio station, and textual signs around the town. The radio shows and signs provide a <b>deeper</b> <b>understanding</b> of the town's history and culture. The game's downloadable content episodes introduce other collectibles such as alarm clocks.|$|E
5|$|During {{the summer}} of 1887, Bruce {{travelled}} north to Edinburgh to attend a pair of vacation courses in natural sciences. The six-week courses, at the recently established Scottish Marine Station at Granton on the Firth of Forth, were {{under the direction of}} Patrick Geddes and John Arthur Thomson, and included sections on botany and practical zoology. The experience of Granton, and the contact with some of the foremost contemporary natural scientists, convinced Bruce to stay in Scotland. He abandoned his place at UCL, and enrolled instead in the medical school at the University of Edinburgh. This enabled him to maintain contact with mentors such as Geddes and Thomson, and also gave him the opportunity to work during his free time in the Edinburgh laboratories where specimens brought back from the Challenger expedition were being examined and classified. Here he worked under Dr John Murray and his assistant John Young Buchanan, and gained a <b>deeper</b> <b>understanding</b> of oceanography and invaluable experience in the principles of scientific investigation.|$|E

25|$|Dnyaneshwar {{highlights}} {{the limitations of}} the traditional epistemological methods (pramanas) used in Indian philosophy. He points out that any perception is validated only by another <b>deeper</b> <b>understanding,</b> while in establishing the rationality of reason, reason itself is transcended. Dnyaneshwar even cautions against reliance on scriptural testimony, which is accepted as a valid source of knowledge by philosophers of Vedanta and Mīmāṃsā schools of philosophy. Scriptural validity, to him, stems from its congruence with experiential truth and not vice versa.|$|E
25|$|A <b>deeper</b> <b>understanding</b> of the {{mechanisms}} underlying consciousness on the biochemical level has practical implications which {{extend to the}} development of more effective and reliable anesthetics. This method is especially useful for the study of consciousness because of anesthetic's well-known ability to elicit unconsciousness. This often happens in a single moment, giving the impression of a collapse of conscious coherence. Stuart Hameroff is a notable anesthesiologist who promotes this method {{in the development of a}} science of consciousness.|$|E
