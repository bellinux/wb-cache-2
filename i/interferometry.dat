5|$|Angle-resolved low-coherence <b>interferometry</b> (a/LCI) uses {{scattered}} light {{to measure the}} sizes of subcellular objects, including cell nuclei. This allows <b>interferometry</b> depth measurements to be combined with density measurements. Various correlations have been found between the state of tissue health and the measurements of subcellular objects. For example, {{it has been found}} that as tissue changes from normal to cancerous, the average cell nuclei size increases.|$|E
5|$|Atom <b>interferometry</b> {{techniques}} are reaching sufficient precision to allow laboratory-scale tests of general relativity.|$|E
5|$|Electronic {{speckle pattern}} <b>interferometry</b> (ESPI), {{also known as}} TV holography, uses video {{detection}} and recording to produce {{an image of the}} object upon which is superimposed a fringe pattern which represents the displacement of the object between recordings. (see Fig.21) The fringes are similar to those obtained in holographic <b>interferometry.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Interferometry</b> is {{a family}} of {{techniques}} in which waves, usually electromagnetic waves, are superimposed causing the phenomenon of interference in order to extract information. <b>Interferometry</b> is an important investigative technique {{in the fields of}} astronomy, fiber optics, engineering metrology, optical metrology, oceanography, seismology, spectroscopy (and its applications to chemistry), quantum mechanics, nuclear and particle physics, plasma physics, remote sensing, biomolecular interactions, surface profiling, microfluidics, mechanical stress/strain measurement, velocimetry, and optometry.|$|E
5|$|Holographic <b>interferometry</b> is a {{technique}} which uses holography to monitor small deformations in single wavelength implementations. In multi-wavelength implementations, {{it is used to}} perform dimensional metrology of large parts and assemblies and to detect larger surface defects.|$|E
5|$|Optical {{coherence}} tomography (OCT) is {{a medical}} imaging technique using low-coherence <b>interferometry</b> to provide tomographic visualization of internal tissue microstructures. As seen in Fig.22, {{the core of a}} typical OCT system is a Michelson interferometer. One interferometer arm is focused onto the tissue sample and scans the sample in an X-Y longitudinal raster pattern. The other interferometer arm is bounced off a reference mirror. Reflected light from the tissue sample is combined with reflected light from the reference. Because of the low coherence of the light source, interferometric signal is observed only over a limited depth of sample. X-Y scanning therefore records one thin optical slice of the sample at a time. By performing multiple scans, moving the reference mirror between each scan, an entire three-dimensional image of the tissue can be reconstructed. Recent advances have striven to combine the nanometer phase retrieval of coherent <b>interferometry</b> with the ranging capability of low-coherence <b>interferometry.</b>|$|E
5|$|Phase-contrast X-ray imaging (Fig.26) {{refers to}} a variety of {{techniques}} that use phase information of a coherent x-ray beam to image soft tissues. (For an elementary discussion, see Phase-contrast x-ray imaging (introduction). For a more in-depth review, see Phase-contrast X-ray imaging.) It has become an important method for visualizing cellular and histological structures {{in a wide range of}} biological and medical studies. There are several technologies being used for x-ray phase-contrast imaging, all utilizing different principles to convert phase variations in the x-rays emerging from an object into intensity variations. These include propagation-based phase contrast, talbot <b>interferometry,</b> moiré-based far-field <b>interferometry,</b> refraction-enhanced imaging, and x-ray <b>interferometry.</b> These methods provide higher contrast compared to normal absorption-contrast x-ray imaging, making it possible to see smaller details. A disadvantage is that these methods require more sophisticated equipment, such as synchrotron or microfocus x-ray sources, x-ray optics, or high resolution x-ray detectors.|$|E
5|$|The {{spacecraft}} {{would have}} used optical <b>interferometry</b> to accomplish these and other scientific goals. This technique collects light with multiple mirrors (in SIM's case, two) which is combined to make an interference pattern which can be very precisely measured.|$|E
5|$|During the {{occultation}} of 29 May 1979 {{the discovery}} of a possible tiny satellite with a diameter of about 1km was reported, which was never confirmed. In 1980, speckle <b>interferometry</b> was reported as indicating a much larger satellite with a diameter of 175km, whose existence was later refuted.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, several {{independent}} {{groups of}} experimenters in the mid-60s {{realized that the}} fringes encoded important information about dimensional changes occurring in the subject, and began intentionally producing holographic double exposures. The main Holographic <b>interferometry</b> article covers the disputes over priority of discovery {{that occurred during the}} issuance of the patent for this method.|$|E
5|$|Holographic <b>interferometry</b> was {{discovered}} by accident {{as a result of}} mistakes committed during the making of holograms. Early lasers were relatively weak and photographic plates were insensitive, necessitating long exposures during which vibrations or minute shifts might occur in the optical system. The resultant holograms, which showed the holographic subject covered with fringes, were considered ruined.|$|E
5|$|In {{coherence}} scanning <b>interferometry,</b> interference is only achieved {{when the}} path length delays of the interferometer are matched within the coherence {{time of the}} light source. CSI monitors the fringe contrast rather than the phase of the fringes. Fig.17 illustrates a CSI microscope using a Mirau interferometer in the objective; other forms of interferometer used with white light include the Michelson interferometer (for low magnification objectives, where the reference mirror in a Mirau objective would interrupt {{too much of the}} aperture) and the Linnik interferometer (for high magnification objectives with limited working distance). The sample (or alternatively, the objective) is moved vertically over the full height range of the sample, and the position of maximum fringe contrast is found for each pixel. The chief benefit of coherence scanning <b>interferometry</b> is that systems can be designed that do not suffer from the 2pi ambiguity of coherent <b>interferometry,</b> and as seen in Fig.18, which scans a 180μmx140μmx10μm volume, it is well suited to profiling steps and rough surfaces. The axial resolution of the system is determined in part by the coherence length of the light source. Industrial applications include in-process surface metrology, roughness measurement, 3D surface metrology in hard-to-reach spaces and in hostile environments, profilometry of surfaces with high aspect ratio features (grooves, channels, holes), and film thickness measurement (semi-conductor and optical industries, etc.).|$|E
5|$|Jodrell Bank {{has been}} {{involved}} with Very Long Baseline <b>Interferometry</b> (VLBI) since the late 1960s; the Lovell telescope took part in the first transatlantic interferometer experiment in 1968, with other telescopes being those at Algonquin and Penticton in Canada. The Lovell Telescope and the Mark II telescopes are regularly used for VLBI with telescopes across Europe (the European VLBI Network), giving a resolution of around 0.001 arcseconds.|$|E
5|$|Lipid bilayers exhibit {{high levels}} of {{birefringence}} where the refractive index in {{the plane of the}} bilayer differs from that perpendicular by as much as 0.1 refractive index units. This has been used to characterise the degree of order and disruption in bilayers using dual polarisation <b>interferometry</b> to understand mechanisms of protein interaction.|$|E
5|$|Phase {{shifting}} <b>interferometry</b> overcomes {{these limitations}} by not relying on finding fringe centers, {{but rather by}} collecting intensity data from every point of the CCD image sensor. As seen in Fig.17, multiple interferograms (at least three) are analyzed with the reference optical surface shifted by a precise fraction of a wavelength between each exposure using a piezoelectric transducer (PZT). Alternatively, precise phase shifts can be introduced by modulating the laser frequency. The captured images are processed by a computer to calculate the optical wavefront errors. The precision and reproducibility of PSI is far greater than possible in static interferogram analysis, with measurement repeatabilities of a hundredth of a wavelength being routine. Phase shifting technology has been adapted {{to a variety of}} interferometer types such as Twyman-Green, Mach–Zehnder, laser Fizeau, and even common path configurations such as point diffraction and lateral shearing interferometers. More generally, phase shifting techniques can be adapted to almost any system that uses fringes for measurement, such as holographic and speckle <b>interferometry.</b>|$|E
5|$|The early {{investigation}} into the size and nature of quasars drove the development of <b>interferometry</b> techniques in the 1950s; the Lovell telescope had an advantage due to its large collecting area, meaning that high sensitivity interferometer measurements can be made relatively quickly using it. As a result, the telescope featured heavily in the discovery of quasars.|$|E
5|$|Early radio {{telescope}} interferometers used a single baseline for measurement. Later astronomical interferometers, {{such as the}} Very Large Array illustrated in Fig11, used arrays of telescopes arranged in a pattern on the ground. A limited number of baselines will result in insufficient coverage. This was alleviated by using {{the rotation of the}} Earth to rotate the array relative to the sky. Thus, a single baseline could measure information in multiple orientations by taking repeated measurements, a technique called Earth-rotation synthesis. Baselines thousands of kilometers long were achieved using very long baseline <b>interferometry.</b>|$|E
5|$|Epsilon Eridani is {{a target}} for planet finding {{programs}} because it has properties that allow an Earth-like planet to form. Although this system was not chosen as a primary candidate for the now-canceled Terrestrial Planet Finder, it was a target star for NASA's proposed Space <b>Interferometry</b> Mission to search for Earth-sized planets. The proximity, Sun-like properties and suspected planets of Epsilon Eridani have also made it the subject of multiple studies on whether an interstellar probe {{can be sent to}} Epsilon Eridani.|$|E
5|$|<b>Interferometry</b> {{is another}} method {{to find the}} {{wavelength}} of electromagnetic radiation for determining the speed of light. A coherent beam of light (e.g. from a laser), with a known frequency (f), is split to follow two paths and then recombined. By adjusting the path length while observing the interference pattern and carefully measuring the change in path length, the wavelength of the light (λ) can be determined. The speed of light is then calculated using the equationc=λf.|$|E
5|$|Neutron <b>interferometry</b> {{has been}} used to {{investigate}} the Aharonov–Bohm effect, {{to examine the effects of}} gravity acting on an elementary particle, and to demonstrate a strange behavior of fermions that is at the basis of the Pauli exclusion principle: Unlike macroscopic objects, when fermions are rotated by 360° about any axis, they do not return to their original state, but develop a minus sign in their wave function. In other words, a fermion needs to be rotated 720° before returning to its original state.|$|E
5|$|The Space <b>Interferometry</b> Mission, or SIM, {{also known}} as SIM Lite (formerly known as SIM PlanetQuest), was a planned space {{telescope}} proposed by the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), in conjunction with contractor Northrop Grumman. One of the main goals of the mission was the hunt for Earth-sized planets orbiting in the habitable zones of nearby stars other than the Sun. SIM was postponed several times and finally cancelled in 2010.|$|E
5|$|The mass of Beta Pictoris {{has been}} {{determined}} by using models of stellar evolution and fitting them to the star's observed properties. This method yields a stellar mass between 1.7 and 1.8 solar masses. The star's angular diameter has been measured using <b>interferometry</b> with the Very Large Telescope and {{was found to be}} 0.84 milliarcseconds. Combining this value with the distance of 63.4 light years gives a radius 1.8 times that of the Sun.|$|E
5|$|Another way {{to measure}} {{the speed of light}} is to {{independently}} measure the frequency f and wavelength λ of an electromagnetic wave in vacuum. The value of c can then be found by using the relation c=fλ. One option is to measure the resonance frequency of a cavity resonator. If the dimensions of the resonance cavity are also known, these can be used to determine the wavelength of the wave. In 1946, Louis Essen and A.C. Gordon-Smith established the frequency for a variety of normal modes of microwaves of a microwave cavity of precisely known dimensions. The dimensions were established to an accuracy of about ±0.8μm using gauges calibrated by <b>interferometry.</b> As the wavelength of the modes was known from the geometry of the cavity and from electromagnetic theory, knowledge of the associated frequencies enabled a calculation of the speed of light.|$|E
5|$|Deciding between {{building}} ground- versus space-based telescopes is complex. Even before Hubble was launched, specialized ground-based {{techniques such}} as aperture masking <b>interferometry</b> had obtained higher-resolution optical and infrared images than Hubble would achieve, though restricted to targets about 108 times brighter than the faintest targets observed by Hubble. Since then, advances in adaptive optics have extended the high-resolution imaging capabilities of ground-based telescopes to the infrared imaging of faint objects. The usefulness of adaptive optics versus HST observations depends strongly on the particular details of the research questions being asked. In the visible bands, adaptive optics can only correct a relatively small field of view, whereas HST can conduct high-resolution optical imaging over a wide field. Only {{a small fraction of}} astronomical objects are accessible to high-resolution ground-based imaging; in contrast Hubble can perform high-resolution observations of any part of the night sky, and on objects that are extremely faint.|$|E
5|$|Interferometric {{synthetic}} aperture radar (InSAR) is a radar technique used in geodesy and remote sensing. Satellite {{synthetic aperture}} radar images of a geographic feature are taken on separate days, and changes {{that have taken place}} between radar images taken on the separate days are recorded as fringes similar to those obtained in holographic <b>interferometry.</b> The technique can monitor centimeter- to millimeter-scale deformation resulting from earthquakes, volcanoes and landslides, and also has uses in structural engineering, in particular for the monitoring of subsidence and structural stability. Fig20 shows Kilauea, an active volcano in Hawaii. Data acquired using the space shuttle Endeavour's X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar on April 13, 1994 and October 4, 1994 were used to generate interferometric fringes, which were overlaid on the X-SAR image of Kilauea.|$|E
5|$|<b>Interferometry</b> at Jodrell Bank started {{before the}} Lovell {{telescope}} was constructed, using the Transit Telescope with a 35 square meter broadside array {{to determine the}} size of radio-loud nebulae. Once construction of the Lovell telescope was complete, the broadside array was put on a steerable mount and the pair were used as a tracking radio interferometer. This was then {{used to determine the}} 2D shape of quasars on the sky.Rowson (1963) In the summer of 1961, a 25-foot (8-m) diameter paraboloid telescope was constructed (it was made of aluminium tubing and was mounted on the rotating structure of an old defence radar). This was then used as a steerable interferometer with the Mark I, with a resolution of 0.3 arcseconds, to determine the sizes of some high-redshift (z~0.86) quasars.|$|E
5|$|<b>Interferometry</b> {{makes use}} of the {{principle}} of superposition to combine waves {{in a way that will}} cause the result of their combination to have some meaningful property that is diagnostic of the original state of the waves. This works because when two waves with the same frequency combine, the resulting intensity pattern is determined by the phase difference between the two waves—waves that are in phase will undergo constructive interference while waves that are out of phase will undergo destructive interference. Waves which are not completely in phase nor completely out of phase will have an intermediate intensity pattern, which can be used to determine their relative phase difference. Most interferometers use light or some other form of electromagnetic wave.|$|E
5|$|On 13 December 1920, Betelgeuse {{became the}} first star outside the Solar System to have the angular size of its {{photosphere}} measured. Although <b>interferometry</b> was still in its infancy, the experiment proved a success. The researchers, using a uniform disk model, determined that Betelgeuse had a diameter of 0.047arcseconds, although the stellar disk was likely 17% larger due to the limb darkening, resulting in an estimate for its angular diameter of about 0.055". Since then, other studies have produced angular diameters that range from 0.042 to 0.069arcseconds. Combining these data with historical distance estimates of 180 to 815ly yields a projected radius of the stellar disk of anywhere from 1.2 to 8.9AU. Using the Solar System for comparison, the orbit of Mars is about 1.5AU, Ceres in the asteroid belt 2.7AU, Jupiter 5.5AU—so, assuming Betelgeuse occupying {{the place of the}} Sun, its photosphere might extend beyond the Jovian orbit, not quite reaching Saturn at 9.5AU.|$|E
5|$|The Space <b>Interferometry</b> Mission {{began as}} a four-month {{preliminary}} architecture study in March 1997. NASA selected TRW's Space & Electronics Group, Eastman Kodak and Hughes Danbury Optical Systems to conduct the study. In 1998, TRW Inc. {{was selected as the}} contractor for the SIM Lite project; Northrup Grumman acquired part of TRW in 2002 and took over the contract. Also selected was Lockheed Martin Missiles and Space located in Sunnyvale, California. The two contracts, which included the mission formulation and implementation phases, were announced in September 1998 and worth a total of over US$200million. The formulation phase of the mission included initial mission design and planning for the full scale implementation of the mission. At the time of the NASA announcement, launch was scheduled for 2005 and the mission was part of the Origins Program, a series of missions designed to answer questions such as the origin of life Earth.|$|E
5|$|The favoured {{model for}} the enzyme–substrate {{interaction}} is the induced fit model. This model proposes that the initial interaction between enzyme and substrate is relatively weak, but that these weak interactions rapidly induce conformational changes in the enzyme that strengthen binding. These conformational changes also bring catalytic residues in the active site close to the chemical bonds in the substrate that will be altered in the reaction. Conformational changes can be measured using circular dichroism or dual polarisation <b>interferometry.</b> After binding takes place, one or more mechanisms of catalysis lower {{the energy of the}} reaction's transition state by providing an alternative chemical pathway for the reaction. Mechanisms of catalysis include catalysis by bond strain; by proximity and orientation; by active-site proton donors or acceptors; covalent catalysis and quantum tunnelling.|$|E
5|$|To {{overcome}} these challenges, researchers have employed various solutions. Astronomical <b>interferometry,</b> first conceived by Hippolyte Fizeau in 1868, was the seminal concept that has enabled major improvements in modern telescopy {{and led to}} the creation of the Michelson interferometer in the 1880s, and the first successful measurement of Betelgeuse. Just as human depth perception increases when two eyes instead of one perceive an object, Fizeau proposed the observation of stars through two apertures instead of one to obtain interferences that would furnish information on the star's spatial intensity distribution. The science evolved quickly and multiple-aperture interferometers are now used to capture speckled images, which are synthesized using Fourier analysis to produce a portrait of high resolution. It was this methodology that identified the hotspots on Betelgeuse in the 1990s. Other technological breakthroughs include adaptive optics, space observatories like Hipparcos, Hubble and Spitzer, and the Astronomical Multi-BEam Recombiner (AMBER), which combines the beams of three telescopes simultaneously, allowing researchers to achieve milliarcsecond spatial resolution.|$|E
5|$|Since Johnston's death, {{his field}} of {{volcanic}} eruption prediction has advanced significantly, and volcanologists are {{now able to}} predict eruptions based on a number of precursors that become apparent between days and months in advance. Geologists can now identify characteristic patterns in seismic waves that indicate particular magmatic activity. In particular, volcanologists have used deep, long-period earthquakes that indicate that magma is rising through the crust. They can also use carbon dioxide emission as a proxy for magma supply rate. Measurements of surface deformation due to magmatic intrusions, like those that were conducted by Johnston and the other USGS scientists at the ColdwaterI and II outposts, have advanced in scale and precision. Ground deformation monitoring networks around volcanoes now consist of InSAR (<b>interferometry),</b> surveys of networks of GPS monuments, microgravity surveys in which scientists measure the change in gravitational potential or acceleration because of the intruding magma and resulting deformation, strain meters, and tiltmeters. Though there is still work to be done, this combination of approaches has greatly improved scientists' abilities to forecast volcanic eruptions.|$|E
5|$|When lasers {{were first}} invented, laser speckle was {{considered}} to be a severe drawback in using lasers to illuminate objects, particularly in holographic imaging because of the grainy image produced. It was later realized that speckle patterns could carry information about the object's surface deformations. Butters and Leendertz developed the technique of speckle pattern <b>interferometry</b> in 1970, and since then, speckle has been exploited in a variety of other applications. A photograph is made of the speckle pattern before deformation, and a second photograph is made of the speckle pattern after deformation. Digital subtraction of the two images results in a correlation fringe pattern, where the fringes represent lines of equal deformation. Short laser pulses in the nanosecond range can be used to capture very fast transient events. A phase problem exists: In the absence of other information, one cannot tell the difference between contour lines indicating a peak versus contour lines indicating a trough. To resolve the issue of phase ambiguity, ESPI may be combined with phase shifting methods.|$|E
25|$|Grating-based imaging (GBI) {{includes}} Shearing <b>interferometry</b> or X-ray Talbot <b>interferometry</b> (XTI), and polychromatic far-field <b>interferometry</b> (PFI). Since {{the first}} X-ray grating interferometer—consisting of two phase gratings and an analyzer crystal—was built, various slightly different setups for this method have been developed; {{in the following}} the focus lies on the nowadays standard method consisting of a phase grating and an analyzer grating. (See figure to the right).|$|E
25|$|Another {{promising}} {{approach is}} nulling <b>interferometry.</b>|$|E
25|$|OCT {{is based}} on low-coherence <b>interferometry.</b> In {{conventional}} <b>interferometry</b> with long coherence length (i.e., laser <b>interferometry),</b> interference of light occurs over a distance of meters. In OCT, this interference is shortened to a distance of micrometers, owing {{to the use of}} broad-bandwidth light sources (i.e., sources that emit light over a broad range of frequencies). Light with broad bandwidths can be generated by using superluminescent diodes or lasers with extremely short pulses (femtosecond lasers). White light {{is an example of a}} broadband source with lower power.|$|E
