50|$|Fixing Prices - Prices {{were fixed}} under {{the premise that}} it would force {{producers}} to behave more efficiently, instead the price-controlled products were produced in lower quantities. In Yugoslavia, the market distortion cause by the price fixing was realized, {{and led to the}} un-freezing of prices in 1967. Hungary also had <b>frozen</b> <b>prices,</b> they slowly un-froze them over a period of 10 to 15 years because otherwise the structural disproportions of the Hungarian economy would spin prices out of control.|$|R

They also believed that the AFL-CIO might attempt to declare its neutrality in the forthcoming U.S. presidential campaign in which President Richard Nixon was seeking re-election. The members of the CBTU thought that the re-election of Richard Nixon would continue hurtful policies to laborers such as unemployment, inflated <b>prices,</b> <b>frozen</b> wages, and appointing judges to the U.S. Supreme Court who did not consider the rights of minorities, workers, and the poor.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{focuses on}} {{causality}} in demand. A methodology where causality is imposed and tested within an empirical co-integrated demand model, not pre-specified, is suggested. The methodology allows different causality of different products {{within the same}} demand system. The methodology is applied to fish demand. On the German market for farmed trout and substitutes, {{it is found that}} supply sources, i. e. aquaculture and fishery, are not the only determinant of causality. Storing, tightness of management and aggregation level of integrated markets might also be important. The methodological implication is that more explicit focus on causality in demand analyses provides improved information. The results suggest that frozen trout forms part of a large European whitefish market, where prices of fresh trout are formed on a relatively separate market. Redfish is a substitute on both markets. The policy implication is that increased production of trout causes a downward pressure on fresh trout <b>prices,</b> but <b>frozen</b> trout <b>prices</b> remain relatively unaffected...|$|R

30|$|Although the Brazilian {{sugarcane}} agroindustry {{has been}} traditionally criticized, today, {{the awareness of}} society about all its value for the country is growing. In recent years, the sector started a growth rate higher than many others, when several new sugarcane mills entered in operation. But {{in the last few}} years, due to an increase in the production costs and <b>frozen</b> of ethanol <b>prices,</b> the growth rate stopped and the amount of ethanol becomes insufficient to supply the internal market. Of the many projections about ethanol production in Brazil in the coming decades, one of them foresees that the production of 47 billion liters and the production of 11, 500 Â MW of bioelectricity, or 15 % participation in the Brazilian energy matrix, will happen in 2015 [43].|$|R
50|$|Chen was not, in principle, {{opposed to}} the scope of Deng's reforms: China's {{economic}} policy had effectively <b>frozen</b> consumer <b>prices</b> for decades, {{to the point that}} prices in China no longer had much relationship to the relative value of resources, goods, or services. Chen did object {{to the way in which}} the urban reforms were carried out. The immediate consequence of Deng's price reform was a sudden and massive inflation, unprecedented in the experience of the younger generation and particularly frightening to older folks who could still remember the rampant inflation in the last years of the Nationalist regime. The increasing circulation of money in the economy, together with a hybrid system in which those in official position or with official connections were particularly well-placed to take advantage of the new opportunities to make a profit, encouraged official corruption. The government's first response to inflation was to issue bonuses to workers in state-owned enterprises, to help make up for the price increases. Chen Yun argued that, if there were to be such bonuses, they should be gauged to increased productivity. In practice these bonuses were universal throughout the state sector, and had the same economic effect as if the government had simply printed more money. Because Chinese farmers were not eligible for bonuses (since they were not technically state employees), China's agricultural sector, which had prospered in the first stage of the reform, was especially damaged by inflation.|$|R
50|$|In November 1961, John S. Marten and {{his brother}} Harry Marten left Sexton Foods. The Marten {{brothers}} had advocated {{an expansion of the}} Sexton Foods product line to include a frozen food line. However, other family members did not believe that the traditional Sexton customer would be interested in frozen foods since the capital required for restaurants to install freezers and refrigerators was large. In addition, Sexton Foods was reluctant to make the large investment to install freezers in the Sexton warehouses and convert the Sexton delivery fleet to freezer trucks. The value the Marten brothers saw was that a restaurant, hotel or cafeteria could save on food preparation labor by buying prepared frozen foods that were heat and serve. <b>Frozen</b> foods were <b>priced</b> higher than canned goods and also require the customers have freezer storage. However, the value to the customers was reduced costs in delivering quality finished meals in their restaurants, hotels, cafeterias etc.|$|R
5000|$|However, Taylor {{realized}} that in practice, {{there is much}} heterogeneity in the length of wage contract across the economy. [...] "There {{is a great deal}} of heterogeneity in wage and price setting. In fact, the data suggest that there is as much a difference between the average lengths of different types of price setting arrangements, or between the average lengths of different types of wage setting arrangements, as there is between wage setting and price setting. Grocery prices change much more frequently than magazine <b>prices</b> - <b>frozen</b> orange juice <b>prices</b> change every two weeks, while magazine prices change every three years! Wages in some industries change once per year on average, while others change per quarter and others once every two years. One might hope that a model with homogenous representative price or wage setting would be a good approximation to this more complex world, but most likely some degree of heterogeneity will be required to describe reality accurately." ...|$|R
40|$|Lobos, G (Lobos, German). Univ Talca, Escuela Ingn Comercial, Talca, ChileThe {{low levels}} of {{consumption}} of lamb meat in Chile {{suggest the need for}} studies on consumer preferences in order to orient production. A study with this object was carried out to evaluate preferences for various cuts, breeds, state (fresh or <b>frozen)</b> and <b>price</b> of lamb's meat among supermarket buyers in Temuco, Chile, and the existence of different market segments, through a survey of 400 persons. Using a fractional factorial design for conjoint analysis, it was determined that the state of the meat was more important than the cut, the price and the breed, with a preference for meat in half carcasses and quarters, Araucano lamb, fresh, at a medium price level. Four consumer segments were distinguished by analysis of hierarchic conglomerates. The majority group (47. 7 %) was sensitive to the state and the cut, with preference for meat in quarters, fresh, Texel breed. The second group (25. 3 %) was sensitive to the breed, presenting the strongest preferences for meat in whole carcass, fresh, Araucano lamb. The third group (14. 3 %) was sensitive to the price, preferred meat in quarters, fresh, Araucano lamb. The minority group (12. 7 %) was sensitive to the state and price, preferring meat in quarters, Texel breed, and was the only group which preferred frozen meat and would pay a higher price. The segments were distinguished by age, ethnic origin and satisfaction with food-related life. Thus the commercialisation strategy for lamb in supermarkets in Temuco should concentrate principally on the sale of fresh meat cut in quarter...|$|R
40|$|Obesity is {{generally}} {{inversely related to}} income among women in the United States. Less access to healthy foods is one way lower income can influence dietary behaviors and body weight. Federal food assistance programs, such as the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), are {{an important source of}} healthy food for low-income populations. In 2009, as part of a nationwide policy revision, WIC added a fruit and vegetable (F/V) voucher to WIC food packages. This quasi-experimental study determined whether F/V prices at stores authorized to accept WIC (ie, WIC vendors) decreased after the policy revision in seven Illinois counties. It also examined cross-sectional F/V price variations by store type and neighborhood characteristics. Two pre-policy observations were conducted in 2008 and 2009; one post-policy observation was conducted in 2010. Small pre- to post-policy reductions in some F/V prices were found, particularly for canned fruit and frozen vegetables at small stores. Compared with chain supermarkets, mass merchandise stores had lower prices for fresh F/V and frozen F/V and small stores and non-chain supermarkets had higher canned and <b>frozen</b> F/V <b>prices,</b> but lower fresh F/V prices. Limited price differences were found across neighborhoods, although canned vegetables were more expensive in neighborhoods with higher concentrations of either Hispanics or blacks and fresh F/V prices were lower in neighborhoods with more Hispanics. Results suggest the WIC policy revision contributed to modest reductions in F/V prices. WIC participants' purchasing power can differ depending on the type and neighborhood of the WIC vendor used.

40|$|Autoxidation of lipids {{is related}} to flesh {{deterioration}} and discoloration, as well as unpleasant flavors produced during processing and storage. This becomes a major factor determining fresh and <b>frozen</b> seafood products <b>price.</b> The aims of this research were to investigate the effect of two novel dietary supplementation antioxidants VinlifeÂ® grape seed extract and HerbaloxÂ® rosemary extract on lipid oxidation during post-mortem storage of zebrafish (Brachydanio rerio) and the relationships between dietary antioxidants with the enzymatic antioxidant activities. HerbaloxÂ® supplemented diet showed no harmful effects on growth or survival of zebrafish. However, the diet could not inhibit Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances (TBARS) formation in zebrafish during post-mortem storage at 4 Â°C. Dietary HerbaloxÂ® and VinlifeÂ® supplementation also showed no deleterious effects on growth or survival of zebrafish. The VinlifeÂ® supplementation efficiently suppressed TBARS formation in the zebrafish but the HerbaloxÂ® supplementation. The two novel antioxidants had significant effects on catalase and glutathione S-transferase but not on glutathione peroxidase. These findings suggested that the supplementation with VinlifeÂ® was more effective than with HerbaloxÂ® in inhibiting the formation of lipid oxidation products in zebrafish. Hence, VinlifeÂ® supplementation, could be a safe alternative method to improve oxidative stability of fish lipid contents...|$|R
40|$|This {{case study}} focuses on meat goat {{marketing}} involving one distinct immigrant group residing {{in one area}} of Columbus, Ohio: the Somalis. There are about 20, 000 - 25, 000 Somalis living in Columbus, the second largest concentration of Somalian immigrants in the U. S. after Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota. It is estimated that Columbus Somalis consume the meat from about 14, 000 goats each year. The objective of this pilot study is to analyze the meat goat marketing and consumption patterns of the Somali immigrant population of Columbus, Ohio. Understanding gained in the Somali meat market will assist in determining the feasibility of establishing a more structured marketing system, including the possible need for a processing plant dedicated to goat meat. The Southern Ohio Meat Goat Task Force {{is a group of}} meat-goat producers, marketers, OSU extension professionals, and Ohio Cooperative Development Center staff members that are working with the meat-goat industry to assess and develop goat production, processing, and meat marketing in Ohio. Tours of several retail shops within the Somali community were conducted to further understand the preferences of the Somali population. Interviews were conducted with a slaughter-plant manager in nearby Detroit, Michigan, the current major supplier of fresh goat meat to the Columbus market. During January and March 2003, two focus-group sessions were organized and conducted by task force members with Somali consumers, entrepreneurs, and retail grocery owners. Significant results and discussion presented in detail within this research report include: Somalia's prefer fresh over <b>frozen</b> goat meat, <b>pricing</b> is a key determinant in meat choices for Somali consumers, goat meat and lamb meat are somewhat substitutable in Somali diets, Somalis will substitute halal chicken and beef if lamb and goat meat is not available, lean grass-fed carcass is preferred to a grain-fed goat, Somalis eat goat meat 1 - 2 times a day year-round, most people feeding families buy a whole carcass, and only a slight preference was indicated between the halal and kosher slaughter practices.
