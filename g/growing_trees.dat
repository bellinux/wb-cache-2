5|$|A {{strategy}} {{for dealing with}} seasonal plenty is to eat {{as much as possible}} and store the surplus nutrients as fat. Marmots do this, and may be 50% heavier in the autumn than in the spring. They rely on their fat reserves during their long winter hibernation. Beavers feed on the leaves, buds, and inner bark of <b>growing</b> <b>trees,</b> as well as aquatic plants. They store food for winter use by felling small trees and leafy branches in the autumn and immersing them in their pond, sticking the ends into the mud to anchor them. Here, they can access their food supply underwater even when their pond is frozen over.|$|E

25|$|Normally, {{the purpose}} of the dam is to provide water around their lodges that is deep enough that it does not freeze solid in winter. The dams also flood areas of {{surrounding}} forest, giving the beaver safe access to an important food supply, which is the leaves, buds, and inner bark of <b>growing</b> <b>trees.</b> They prefer aspen and poplar, but also take birch, maple, willow, alder, black cherry, red oak, beech, ash, hornbeam, and occasionally pine and spruce. They also eat cattails, water lilies, and other aquatic vegetation, especially in the early spring (and contrary to widespread belief, they do not eat fish). In areas where their pond freezes over, beavers collect food in late fall in the form of tree branches, storing them under water (usually by sticking the sharp chewed base of the branches into the mud on the pond bottom), where they can be accessed through the winter. Often, the pile of food branches projects above the pond and collects snow. This insulates the water below it and keeps the pond open at that location.|$|E
500|$|The {{grounds of}} the Kew Asylum were {{originally}} landscaped {{in the tradition of}} an English country park. [...] This was consistent with the Victorian idea that pleasant or beautiful surroundings would help ease the mental anguish of the inmates. [...] It has been proposed that the initial plantings on the site were supplied by Baron Ferdinand von Mueller, director of the Botanic Gardens. Initially, the grounds were planted with many conifers and large <b>growing</b> <b>trees,</b> oaks, elms and Moreton Bay figs; and trees indigenous to the area, river red gum, yellow box, and lightwood were retained in the landscape. In 1913 the landscape gardener Hugh Linaker was employed to lay out the grounds of Mont Park Asylum. As landscape gardener for the State Lunacy Department he commenced a program of landscape improvements and tree plantings at other asylums in Victoria, including Kew.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} years of using the technique, it was {{understood}} that it depended on the atmospheric / ratio having remained the same over the preceding few thousand years. To verify the accuracy of the method, several artefacts that were datable by other techniques were tested; the results of the testing were in reasonable agreement with the true ages of the objects. Over time, however, discrepancies began to appear between the known chronology for the oldest Egyptian dynasties and the radiocarbon dates of Egyptian artefacts. Neither the pre-existing Egyptian chronology nor the new radiocarbon dating method could be assumed to be accurate, but a third possibility was that the / ratio had changed over time. [...] The question was resolved by the study of tree rings: comparison of overlapping series of tree rings allowed the construction of a continuous sequence of tree-ring data that spanned 8,000 years. [...] (Since that time the tree-ring data series has been extended to 13,900 years.) [...] In the 1960s, Hans Suess was able to use the tree-ring sequence to show that the dates derived from radiocarbon were consistent with the dates assigned by Egyptologists. [...] This was possible because although annual plants, such as corn, have a / ratio that reflects the atmospheric ratio at the time they were <b>growing,</b> <b>trees</b> only add material to their outermost tree ring in any given year, while the inner tree rings don't get their [...] replenished and instead start losing [...] through decay. [...] Hence each ring preserves a record of the atmospheric / ratio of the year it grew in. [...] Carbon-dating the wood from the tree rings themselves provides the check needed on the atmospheric / ratio: with a sample of known date, and a measurement of the value of N (the number of atoms of [...] remaining in the sample), the carbon-dating equation allows the calculation of N0 – the number of atoms of [...] in the sample at the time the tree ring was formed – and hence the / ratio in the atmosphere at that time. Equipped with the results of carbon-dating the tree rings, it became possible to construct calibration curves designed to correct the errors caused by the variation over time in the / ratio. These curves are described in more detail below.|$|E
