50|$|Shpolsky {{studied at}} the {{department}} of physics of Moscow State University. In the aftermath of the Casso affair of 1911 professors of physics Pyotr Lazarev and Pyotr Lebedev and their assistant Sergey Vavilov resigned and joined the faculty of the fledgling private Shanyavsky University. Shpolsky followed them, remaining de jure a student of Moscow State, and made his first research assignment in Lazarev's private laboratory in Arbat District. He graduated from the department of physics of Moscow State University in 1913 and joined the staff of Shanyavsky University. In 1918 he returned to Moscow State University and lectured there until 1939. In 1932 he also joined the faculty of Moscow State Pedagogical Institute and chaired its department of physics for 46 years. He received the doctorate at MSU in 1933. After World War II Shpolsky engaged in physical studies of carcinogens. He reasoned that carcinogens should possess physical properties distinct from harmless substances, and although no such link was ever found, his studies led to the discovery of Shpolsky effect. In 1952 Shpolsky, Ilyina and Klimov published an article in Doklady Akademii Nauk asserting that complex organic substances that normally do not have clearly defined spectral lines do, in fact, emit or absorb them at low temperatures when mixed with specific organic solvents. Use of the solvent, forming a snow-like paraffin structure at 77 K, was a radical departure from an established spectroscopy routine. In the same year Pyotr Kapitsa provided Shpolsky his laboratory to repeat the experiment at lower temperatures. This property became known as Shpolsky effect; Soviet authorities formally recognized it as a discovery only after Shpolsky's death. Organic compounds possessing this effect became known as Shpolsky matrixes and Shpolsky systems. The method, although lacking solid theoretical foundation, provided extreme spectral selectivity and became a major improvement in detecting 3,4-benzapyrene in the 1960s. In 1961 Karl Rebane suggested that Shpolsky effect was an optical analogy to Mössbauer effect (see zero-phonon line and phonon sideband). Roman Personov, an alumnus of Shpolsky laboratory, confirmed Karl Rebane hypothesis in 1971. Later studies showed that matrix isolation <b>fluorimetry</b> has significant practical advantages over original Shpolsky methode.|$|E

30|$|In early reports, the {{optimization}} {{of culture}} media and culture conditions was largely studied for higher spore yields for particular Bacillus strains, since each strain differed from different nutrient requirements and culture conditions (Chen et al. 2010; Khardziani et al. 2017; Posada-Uribe et al. 2015; Setlow 2006; Shi and Zhu 2007). In whichever reports, the spore concentrations were all quantified by plate counting assay, which were generally time-consuming and quite tedious (Hazan et al. 2012).

30|$|More importantly, {{the current}} study {{demonstrated}} the use of DPA <b>fluorimetry</b> assays {{as an alternative to}} traditional plate counting for quantifying spore concentration in the optimization procedures. From the linear curve in Fig.  1, {{it can be seen that}} the LOD in this study (8000 spores/mL) was close to the lowest LOD (1000 spores/mL) identified in the literature (Pellegrino et al. 2002). The LOD was low enough to allow for the quantification of spore concentrations since spore yields in fermented cultures are often above 108 spores/mL. Moreover, the DPA <b>fluorimetry</b> assay used in this study is very simple, and the fluorescent complex was produced by just mixing the diluted DPA samples, europium, and the chelating agent CyDTA. The fluorescence intensity was readily measured by a fluorescence spectrophotometer or microplate readers (Pellegrino et al. 2002). Additionally, DPA <b>fluorimetry</b> assay allowed fast and synchronous detection of many samples in the statistical optimization experiments. For example, in the ion-optimized RSM experiment of this study, 27 runs with 2 replicates were carried out simultaneously and all the 54 samples could be detected in 1  h by the fluorescence spectrophotometer. However, in the plate counting assay, the spore concentration of one sample was achieved by plating three tenfold dilutions of spore suspensions with at least three replicates for each dilution. Therefore, at least 3  ×  3  ×  54 plates were required and the colonies were finally counted after at least 24  h cultivation. Based on the results found by the DPA <b>fluorimetry</b> assay (presented in Table  6), it was demonstrated that the optimization techniques described in this paper provided an easy and feasible way to enhance spore production. Finally, from the optimized and verified results in this study, a DPA <b>fluorimetry</b> assay was successfully applied and provided a general analytical method for assessing spore concentrations with less work and time than a plate-counting assay would require.|$|E
