40|$|It {{has long}} been {{recognised}} that the actors involved in crafting and implementing China’s <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> are not always in agreement. This paper argues that the prioritisation of commercial outreach over purely political objectives in Africa {{has led to a}} shift in influence from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) to the Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM). To that end, the paper examines the rising prominence of China Exim Bank’s concessional loans as a <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> <b>instrument</b> in Africa along with the process through which they are negotiated and implemented. Using the case of Angola, this paper shows how despite formal institutional equality, the MOFCOM is playing a far more influential role than the MFA is in defining the direction of China’s <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> toward Africa...|$|R

Applying these indicators to the South African case, the analysis demonstrates the crucial significance of institutional <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> <b>instruments.</b> But although the South African government is ready to pay the costs of co-operative hegemony (such as capacity building for regional institutions and peacekeeping), the regional acceptance of South Africa’s leadership is constrained by its historical legacy. Additionally, Pretoria’s foreign policy is based on ideational resources such as its reputation as an advocate of {{democracy and human rights}} and the legitimacy derived from its paradigmatic behaviour as a ‘good global citizen’. However, the Mbeki presidency is more successful in converting these resources into discursive instruments of interest-assertion in global, rather than in regional bargains.

40|$|The {{revolutions}} in North Africa, {{the approaching}} {{end of the}} ‘strategic review’ of the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) initiated by the European Commission, {{and the beginning of}} negotiations on the European Union’s new financial perspective, have intensified the debate among the member states and EU institutions on what policy the EU will adopt towards its neighbourhood in the future.

40|$|Work in progress: Any {{comments}} will be gratefully received. Organisational {{learning is}} key {{in understanding the}} inner dynamics of European <b>foreign</b> <b>policy.</b> Some concepts have been developed in sociology and microeconomics, yet the subject is still understudied in international relations or European integration theories.

40|$|The {{evolution}} of the EU s Eastern Partnership initiative and especially {{the adoption of the}} Association Agreements by Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia have evoked Russia s increasing concern regarding the incremental EU-ization of the post-Soviet regional order. Moscow has adjusted its own policy toward the respective states accordingly. In the context of the 2014 Crimean issue, a number of empirically-oriented research which explore Russian <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> <b>instruments</b> towards its Near Abroad countries has grown. Even the concepts of soft power and smart power are often used by experts to portray the recent transformations in Russia s foreign policy. However, the employment of such concepts risks neglecting the fundamental and complex asymmetric interdependence between Russia and the post-Soviet republics. This study puts forward an alternative theoretical framework underpinned by the concepts of leverage and linkage, as developed by Levitsky & Way, that allows the accounting for this interdependence in a systematic manner. The thesis develops the linkage-leverage nexus approach, which enables a comprehensive analysis of Russian <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> <b>instruments</b> toward post-Soviet states in a regional environment determined by security threats, stateness issues, turbulence in domestic politics, energy, and trade-related problems. The respective analytical approach is subsequently applied to the case study of Russian-Moldovan relations. In order to demonstrate the validity of this approach the author employs a method of process-tracing that examines vast empirical data, including various documents, numerous official statements, expert opinions and media accounts, and eventually unfolds the causal mechanism of linkage-leverage nexus. The result of analysis supports the main argument of the thesis asserting that the increasing instrumentalization of the existing linkage between Russia and the countries in its Near Abroad may lead to undermining sovereignty and territorial integrity of individual states, such as Moldova. The presented conceptualization of external influence on domestic decision-making process with regard to foreign policy agenda brings closer structuralist and agent-centred International Relations approaches...|$|E
