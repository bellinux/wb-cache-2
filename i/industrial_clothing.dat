He finds an outlet for his creativity making custom horse masks and provocative outfits for Galega (Maeve Jinkings), the group's driver who also performs sexually enticing dances for groups of men after each rodeo. They are accompanied by Galega's daughter, Cacá (Alyne Santana); and Zé (Carlos Pessoa), a buffoonish bull wrangler who is {{the butt of the}} other's jokes. The film deals mainly with the interactions between the members of this group, interspersed with Iremar's attempts to design clothing, and rodeo scenes. After an attempt by Iremar and Zé to steal valuable horse semen from a stud auction goes awry, Zé is offered a new job as a horse wrangler; he is replaced in the group by Junior (Vinícius de Oliveira) a young, attractive, and vain, but kind, man who befriends Cacá and becomes sexually involved with Galega.

5000|$|The first {{official}} reference to Blackpool in Cork City as an urban centre was {{in relation to}} the building of a Guard House in 1734 mentioned in the Cork Corporation minute book. Its early development can be traced to it being on the main thoroughfare from Cork City to the north with roads leading to the important destinations of Mallow, Limerick and Dublin. Dublin Street and Hill in Blackpool were named after this route. Weaving became identified with Blackpool from its early beginnings and it was later recalled that the cabins of Blackpool were a hive of wool combing and weaving. The success of weaving in Blackpool can in part be attributable to British Army and Naval contracts that accrued to the area. The Revolutionary War period (1793-1815) was a buoyant time for weaving in Blackpool as a result. But after the war ended and the Act of Union of 1801 eventually allowed cheaper <b>industrial</b> <b>clothing</b> to invade the Irish market it marked the end of the cabin weaving industry of Blackpool. Many of the weavers from Blackpool emigrated to Britain. Thereafter Blackpool had a concentration of industries such as tanning, bacon curing, brewing and distilling. As well as being a suburb, Blackpool is regarded by some as a now faded commercial and social centre of working class districts on the northside of Cork City. A vibrant working class community developed, its identity reinforced by the area's association with icons such as Taoiseach (Prime Minister of the Republic of Ireland) and hurler Jack Lynch, Christy Ring (commonly regarded as the greatest hurler of all time) and footballer Charlie Hurley.|$|E

40|$|Workplace romances (WRs) {{have become}} a common {{occurrence}} and growing trend in today’s work-oriented culture. People are spending more time at work and {{in close proximity to}} their work colleagues which provides the ideal stage for romantic relationships to develop. Whilst on the one hand, WRs could have beneficial consequences for the individuals or organisations involved, they could also on the other hand be a problematic occurrence for some employers. The reason is that WRs have the risk of ending badly and that could open a field of possible complicated legal, emotional, ethical or productivity consequences. In the light of this problem, the general objective {{of this study is to}} explore the effects of dissolved romances on the psychosocial functioning and productivity of involved employees at an <b>industrial</b> <b>clothing</b> factory in Cape Town in 2012 / 13 and also to explore the consequent need for appropriate intervention through the existing employee assistance programmes (EAP).

A collective case study design was utilised because of its aims to understand a social issue, namely the breakdown of romantic relationships in the workplace, and studied the experiences and perceptions of a group of individuals affected by this phenomenon.

Under these circumstances, this work is intended to expose the Costing and Pricing Methodologies used by the Micro and Small <b>Industrial</b> <b>Clothing</b> Manufacturing Companies, which participate in the SEBRAE GEOR Project. The researches were accomplished bibliographically, through the study of the literature on the theme and also a field research by means of a questionnaire. An interview with managers and trade union leaders of the companies researched was carried out. From what was studied and researched, it has become evident that most of these companies use the definite costing method, and the pricing methodology applied is that represented by the mathematic formula in which the selling price equals the total costs, plus profit margin. Thus, it can be concluded that the methodologies applied for the balancing of the costs and pricing are the most appropriate to the bulk of these companies, in addition to being an auxiliary management instrument.
