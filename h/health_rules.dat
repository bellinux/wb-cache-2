50|$|The Northwest Cattle Project is an {{agreement}} between the United States and Canada, first announced on October 22, 1997, that was initially intended to facilitate shipments of live cattle from the states of Montana and Washington to Canada. Such shipments had been blocked due to Canadian animal <b>health</b> <b>rules.</b> Canada revised its animal health import requirements for live cattle entering from these U.S. states among other things by recognizing areas deemed to be at low risk for certain animal diseases.

In his articles, Goethe also explained that Mexicans and South Europeans were responsible for stealing jobs from Americans and introducing germs to the people.|$|E
50|$|There is {{very little}} manufacturing. Agriculture is largely undeveloped and is mainly {{confined}} to the area near the coast and along the Maroni River. Sugar and bananas were traditionally two of the main cash crops grown for export but have almost completely disappeared. Today they {{have been replaced by}} livestock raising (essentially beef cattle and pigs) in the coastal savannas between Cayenne and Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni, and market gardening (fruits and vegetables) developed by the Hmong communities settled in French Guiana in the 1970s, both destined to the local market. A thriving rice production, developed on polders near Mana from the early 1980s to the late 2000s, has almost completely disappeared since 2011 due to marine erosion and new EU plant <b>health</b> <b>rules</b> which forbid the use of many pesticides and fertilizers.

The kinds of animal processing which can occur at knackeries {{are defined by}} law, for example, in Australia by the Commonwealth Meat Inspection Act 1983.

This is so not only in Ireland or Britain, but also, for example, in Japan, where it is performed by burakumin.

50|$|The Act {{replaced}} the previous legislation, largely removing voluntary adult (age 18 and over) prostitution from {{the criminal law}} {{and replacing it with}} civil law at both national and local level. A distinction was made between voluntary and involuntary prostitution. It remains a crime to coerce someone to provide sexual services. Sex work is also prohibited for those on temporary visas, and immigration for and investment in sex work is prohibited. Contracts between provider and client were recognised, and providers have the right to refuse services. Contested contracts can be referred to the Disputes Tribunal. Advertising is banned, with the exception of print media, which is restricted. The Summary Offences Act remains in force in relation to soliciting, which may be classed as offensive behaviour. The Criminal Records (Clean Slate) Act 2004 also allows sex workers to apply for previous convictions to be removed from the record. Sex work is recognised (but not promoted) as legitimate work by Work and Income New Zealand, who may not advertise vacancies in brothels or suggest people start sex work as a means of getting off a benefit. Now, workplace safety and <b>health</b> <b>rules,</b> developed in consultation with the prostitutes' collective, apply to sex work. Employment disputes can be referred to the Labour Inspectorate and Mediation Service. There is an obligation on employers and employees to practise and promote safe sexual practices. The Ministry of Health has the responsibility for enforcement. Registration of indoor sex workers with the police was replaced by certification at an administrative law level of brothel operators. Prior records have been destroyed. Refusal of a certificate is permitted for prior criminal offences (not necessarily related to prostitution). Police activities changed from the registration and prosecution of sex workers to protection. The Police Manual of Best Practice was amended to include prostitution.|$|E
