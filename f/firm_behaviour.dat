5000|$|The {{behavioural}} approach, as {{developed in}} particular by Richard Cyert and James G. March of the Carnegie School places emphasis on explaining how decisions are taken within the firm, and {{goes well beyond}} neoclassical economics. [...] Much of this depended on Herbert A. Simon’s work in the 1950s concerning behaviour in situations of uncertainty, which argued that “people possess limited cognitive ability and so can exercise only ‘bounded rationality’ when making decisions in complex, uncertain situations”. Thus individuals and groups tend to [...] "satisfice"—that is, to attempt to attain realistic goals, rather than maximize a utility or profit function. Cyert and March argued that the firm cannot {{be regarded as a}} monolith, because different individuals and groups within it have their own aspirations and conflicting interests, and that <b>firm</b> <b>behaviour</b> is the weighted outcome of these conflicts. Organisational mechanisms (such as [...] "satisficing" [...] and sequential decision-taking) exist to maintain conflict at levels that are not unacceptably detrimental.

40|$|Innovation is {{a complex}} {{trade-off}} between routinisation and change, between reliability and accountability of firms and timely adaptation. This innovator's dilemma confronts innovation theory with the question, how to align routinisation with innovation induced organisational change and consistent performance. Obviously it {{is a complex}} issue. Dominant innovation theory neglects this subject due to its pro-innovation bias, while evolutionary organisation and innovation theory give opposite perspectives on this problem. The adaptation perspective considers pro-active behaviour as the best condition for innovative performance, whereas the selection perspective advances inert <b>firm</b> <b>behaviour</b> as the best alternative to achieve successful innovations. Our research question focuses on the explanatory value of either the selection or the adaptation perspective for the innovative performance of industrial firms. Our empirical findings confirm the adaptation perspective and reject the selection perspective. Comparatively, <b>firm</b> <b>behaviour</b> involving the highest risks and uncertainties—e. g., high environmental dynamics {{and high levels of}} adaptive activity—contributes most significant to the explanation of innovative performance. Inert, risk averse behaviour, conversely, does not improve or even impedes innovative performance compared with other types of <b>firm</b> <b>behaviour...</b>|$|E

40|$|Purpose – This paper aims {{to argue}} that the {{principal}} components of the Resource-Based View (RBV) as a theory of sustained competitive advantage are not a sufficient basis for a complete and consistent theory of <b>firm</b> <b>behaviour.</b> Two missing elements are value theory and accountability mechanisms. Design/methodology/approach – The paper proposes a link between value theory and accountability using a Resource Value-Resource Risk perspective {{as an alternative to the}} Capital Asset Pricing Model. The link operates first from the labour process, where value is created but is imperfectly observable by intra-firm mechanisms of organizational control and outside governance arrangements without incurring monitoring costs. Second, it operates through contractual arrangements which impose fixed cost structures on activities with variable revenues. Findings – The paper thereby explains how value originates in risky and difficult to monitor productive processes and is transmitted as rents to organizational and capital market constituents. It then reviews recent contributions to the RBV, arguing that the proposed new approach overcomes gaps inherent in the alternatives, and thus offers a more complete and integrated view of <b>firm</b> <b>behaviour.</b> Originality/value – The RBV can become a coherent theory of <b>firm</b> <b>behaviour,</b> if it adopts and can integrate the labour theory of value, associated measures of risk arising from the labour process and mechanisms of accountability.

40|$|The overall {{economic}} framework, {{the amount of}} foreign direct investments, the regulatory context, <b>firm</b> <b>behaviour</b> {{and the intensity of}} competition are among the factors that have an impact on a country's export competitiveness. Due to the ever-increasing engagement of firms in export activities, it seems of particular relevance {{to examine the relationship between}} different determinants of a <b>firm</b> <b>behaviour</b> and its export intensity. The objective of this paper is to emphasize the relationship between different factors affecting the export competitiveness. The paper proposes and empirically tests a model for analysing the export intensity of firms from selected transition economies. The sample predominantly consists of medium sized firms established in the course of transition. The results of the Tobit analysis indicate that larger firms participate with higher intensity on the international market. Business experience seems to be a less important determinant of export success. Price based competitiveness has an important role in the ability of firms from the sample to compete. In addition, firms which have discontinued some of their product lines have higher export intensity. Outsourcing of activities, technology transfer, the use of the Internet and quality certificates have a positive impact on firm's export intensity. Competition and customs and trade regulations seem to be the most important obstacles for doing business. export competitiveness, <b>firm</b> <b>behaviour,</b> transition economies, external environment, Tobit estimation...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} two {{possible}} remedies for corporate governance research. First, when examining {{the effects of}} corporate governance, researchers may want to simultaneously consider the role of firm resources and capabilities.

We base our propositions on the notion that 2 ̆ 7 capability 2 ̆ 7 and 2 ̆ 7 motivation 2 ̆ 7 are the two fundamental drivers of <b>firm</b> competitive <b>behaviour.</b> <b>Firm</b> resources/capabilities, which correspond to the capability driver, define the potential level of a firm 2 ̆ 7 s competitive activity. Further, corporate governance, by virtue of affecting managers 2 ̆ 7 motivation to take actions, moderates the relationship between firm resources/capabilities and competitive behaviour.

The present paper studies how additionality affects the impact of firm-level investment support on <b>firm</b> investment <b>behaviour</b> in differently competitive markets. We find that the investment additionality and the level of competition importantly affect the <b>firm</b> investment <b>behaviour.</b> Imposing additionality to the ECP investments in perfectly competitive markets causes distortions in the capital market and leads to lower welfare levels. In contrast, without the enforcement of additionality, the distortions are zero and the investment support fully benefits the firms. In an imperfectly competitive environment the firm-level investment support may increase investment and may be welfare increasing with and without the enforcement of the investment additionality...|$|R
