5|$|The {{taxonomy}} of Narcissus is complex, {{and still not}} fully resolved. Known to the ancients, the genus name appears in Graeco-Roman literature, although their interest was as much medicinal as botanical. It is unclear which species the ancients were familiar with. Although frequently mentioned in Mediaeval and Renaisance texts it was not formally described till the work of Linnaeus in 1753. By 1789 it had been grouped into a family (Narcissi) but shortly thereafter this was renamed Amaryllideae, from which comes the modern placement within Amaryllidaceae, although <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>it</b> was considered part of Liliaceae.|$|E
5|$|When Russia {{invaded the}} Turkish Balkans in 1853, fears of Russian {{dominance}} in the Mediterranean and Middle East led Britain and France to invade the Crimean Peninsula to destroy Russian naval capabilities. The ensuing Crimean War (1854–56), which involved new techniques of modern warfare, was the only global war fought between Britain and another imperial power during the Pax Britannica and was a resounding defeat for Russia. The situation remained unresolved in Central Asia for two more decades, with Britain annexing Baluchistan in 1876 and Russia annexing Kirghizia, Kazakhstan, and Turkmenistan. <b>For</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>it</b> appeared that another war would be inevitable, but the two countries reached an agreement on their respective spheres of influence in the region in 1878 and on all outstanding matters in 1907 with {{the signing of the}} Anglo-Russian Entente. The destruction of the Russian Navy by the Japanese at the Battle of Port Arthur during the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05 also limited its threat to the British.|$|E

DVG joined the Humanistische Alliantie ("Humanist Alliance"), a national umbrella for humanist organisations founded in 2001, but because they found this coalition much too postmodernist and moderate, the freethinkers were hardly involved in its activities. Under chairship of Anton van Hooff, who opined that the 'combativeness against religion and other unscientific quackery' is threatening to disappear with the 'softened' humanist groups, they left the Alliantie in 2014, and instead sought to work with amongst others Stichting Skepsis and the Vereniging tegen de Kwakzalverij.|$|E

The Luftwaffe tipped the balance back in the Axis favour. Kurt Pflugbeil's Fliegerkorps V conducted rolling attacks on the attacking Soviet 26th Army. In two days 148 motor vehicles and 48 Soviet tanks were destroyed which stopped the attack. Rolling attacks were used in turn against the trapped Soviet armies. On 10 August Luftflotte 2 destroyed another 300 vehicles and 54 tanks. Fliegerkorps V claimed 420 motor vehicles, 58 tanks and 22 artillery batteries. The battle ended with 79,220 soldiers of the two armies dead, and 103,054 captured, although a large number were civilians that had been rounded up.|$|E

In another retrospective review, The Quietus called it [...] "an album that pushed the elegant, improbably-coiffed Sylvian into the limelight, aided and abetted {{by some of the}} band's best songs. Quiet Life deserves to be placed alongside Travelogue, Mix-Up and Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark as one of the key early British synth-based pop/rock albums".|$|R
25|$|Even {{with the}} {{addition}} of $800 million of state funds promised in 1978, {{less than half of the}} $600 million authorized in the 1967 bond issue for major construction had been spent. The MTA made improvements to tunnels, tracks, switches and signals. It had to do this with a smaller amount of funding than available in the past due to the fiscal crisis, and keep the subway operating 24 hours a day. However, it had a major public relations problem. As people didn't see any improvements, they assumed that crime was out of control, and <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>it</b> was, but this assumption was maintained even during periods of reduced crime. In an attempt to alleviate the crime situation and extend the service life of rolling stock, half-length trains began running during off-peak hours. Infrastructure was in such poor condition that even the 63rd Street and Archer Avenue subway projects were threatened by 1980. The 63rd Street Line was flooded with water, while the Archer Avenue Line could barely be built past Parsons Boulevard.|$|E
25|$|In October 1942, the 34th and 36th Battalions were {{detached}} from the division to garrison Tonga and Norfolk Island respectively. The 36th Battalion was accompanied by detachments from the divisional engineer, artillery and service units as N Force. After completing its initial training in New Zealand the 3rd NZ Division moved to New Caledonia for garrison duty and further training in December 1942 and January 1943. At that time, the third brigade, the 15th, came into being. Each of the brigades consisted of only two battalions, initially, although in March 1943 the New Zealand government approved {{the expansion of the}} division to 17,637 men all ranks and decided that the two battalions on Norfolk Island and Tonga would be assigned to the division. Almost immediately, however, manpower became an issue and during the early months of 1943 it became clear {{that it would not be}} possible to raise the division to full strength. Indeed, <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>it</b> seemed that the division might be disbanded before it saw active service but its commander, Barrowclough urged the government to allow the division to see active service before any decision was made.|$|E
25|$|Sons and Daughters {{has also}} had three repeat runs on other TV {{channels}} in the UK.

The whole series was aired on UK Gold from 1 November 1992 to 23 July 1996 at 8am and repeated at 12 noon. Finally, Channel 5 also aired the entire series. Episodes 1 - 212 were shown on Channel 5 at 1.30pm Monday to Friday between 2 March and 24 December 1998, after which time it was dropped <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while.</b> <b>It</b> did however return to Channel 5 in January 2002 (from episode 213) in a late night slot at around 4am every Friday and Saturday night where two episodes were shown back to back {{until they reached the}} end of the series on 6 November 2005. The series gained a new level of UK fans in this early morning slot as the Aussie cult classic Prisoner Cell Block H had previously aired in the same time slot and when that ended, Sons and Daughters eventually replaced it a few months later.|$|E
