5|$|At a given temperature, each {{material}} has an electrical conductivity that determines {{the value of}} electric current when an electric potential is applied. Examples of good conductors include metals such as copper and gold, whereas glass and Teflon are poor conductors. In any <b>dielectric</b> <b>material,</b> the electrons remain bound to their respective atoms and the material behaves as an insulator. Most semiconductors have a variable level of conductivity that lies between the extremes of conduction and insulation. On the other hand, metals have an electronic band structure containing partially filled electronic bands. The presence of such bands allows electrons in metals to behave {{as if they were}} free or delocalized electrons. These electrons are not associated with specific atoms, so when an electric field is applied, they are free to move like a gas (called Fermi gas) through the material much like free electrons.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Dielectric</b> <b>materials</b> {{are used}} as spacers in antennas. The design of the {{dielectric}} determines {{the properties of the}} antenna. The insertion of high <b>dielectric</b> <b>materials</b> in a specific pattern into a low <b>dielectric</b> matrix <b>material</b> is one means to accomplish this. This article reports on the insertion of metal cylinders (wire or nails) into polymer foams to produce such a material. Depending upon the antenna properties desired, the patterns and number of nails vary tremendously. Varying the depths of the nails into the antenna spacers is also important. A penetration model was developed that calculates the forces required to penetrate a nail into foam. Experimental observations are used to verify the model. These equations allow one to predict the forces required for a nail to be inserted into foam to a desired depth, thereby facilitating manufacture of these <b>dielectric</b> <b>materials.</b> KEY WORDS: foam penetration, <b>dielectric</b> <b>materials,</b> antenna spacers, metallic inserts, metal wires...|$|R

25|$|A {{capacitor}} is {{a passive}} two-terminal electrical component that stores electrical energy in an electric field. The {{effect of a}} capacitor is known as capacitance.
