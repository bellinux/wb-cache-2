500|$|Women debtors were {{housed in}} rooms over the tap room. The {{rooms in the}} barracks (the men's rooms) were [...] square and [...] high, with a window, wooden floors and a fireplace. Each housed two or three prisoners, and as the rooms were too small for two beds, prisoners had to share. Apart from the bed, prisoners were {{expected}} to provide their own furniture. The anonymous witness complained in 1833: [...] "170persons have been confined at one time within these walls, making an average of more than four persons in each room—which are not ten feet square!!! <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>leave</b> the reader to imagine what the situation of men, thus confined, particularly in the summer months, must be." ...|$|E
500|$|... "I Was Here" [...] {{begins with}} quivering reverb and a plaintively plucked guitar setting a somber mood for about fifteen {{seconds before the}} beats begin {{alongside}} Beyoncé's voice. Her vocals set a hushed and morbid tone on the song as she bring doses of edge and grit, singing: [...] "I wanna leave my footprints on the sands of time / Know {{there was something that}} meant something that I left behind / When I leave this world, I'll leave no regrets / I'll leave something to remember, So they won't forget". She further sings throughout the song, [...] "The hearts I have touched will be the proof that I leaved that I made a difference". Watery synths shimmer in the background before Beyoncé adopts an authoritative tone to chant the chorus lines: [...] "I was here / I lived, I loved / I was here / I did, I've done / Everything that I wanted / And it was more than I thought it would be / <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>leave</b> my mark so everyone will know / I was here".|$|E

500|$|Zacharias {{was born}} in Madras, India. He is descended from {{a woman of the}} Nambudiri Brahmin caste and a Christian man of the Boatman caste. His mother was from Madras (now Chennai) while his father was from Kerala. He grew up in Delhi. According to Zacharias, before her marriage, Swiss German missionaries had spoken to his Brahmin {{ancestor}} about Christianity and she had converted and had been made an outcast by her Brahmin family and community. Zacharias grew up in a nominal Anglican household, and says that he was an atheist until the age of 17 when he tried to commit suicide by swallowing poison. While in the hospital, a local Christian worker brought him a Bible and told his mother to read to him from John 14. [...] Zacharias says that it was [...] that touched him and meant to him as the defining paradigm: [...] "Because I live, you also will live." [...] He said that he thought, [...] "This may be my only hope: A new way of living. Life as defined by the Author of Life." [...] and that he committed his life to Christ praying, [...] "Jesus if You are the one who gives life as it is meant to be, I want it. Please get me out of this hospital bed well, and I promise <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>leave</b> no stone unturned in my pursuit of truth." [...] In 1966 Zacharias emigrated with his family to Canada, earning his undergraduate degree from the Ontario Bible College in 1972 (now Tyndale University College & Seminary) and his M.Div. from Trinity International University. In 1990 Mr. Zacharias did a 2-3 month sabbatical at Ridley Hall in the town of Cambridge. Zacharias has multiple honorary doctoral degrees.|$|E
500|$|The ballad [...] "I Miss You" [...] was {{performed}} {{in front of an}} electronic backdrop in which a male dancer was silhouetted in kinetic, black-and-white stripes. A re-arranged version of [...] "Resentment" [...] followed with an acoustic guitar used for its musical backbone. Beyoncé opened the performance of [...] "If I Were a Boy" [...] saying [...] "We all know how it feels to be hurt and lied to" [...] and later turned it into a guitar-pop song, in which elements of Goo Goo Dolls' adult-alt ballad [...] "Iris" [...] were used. An acoustic cover of [...] "Ex-Factor" [...] originally performed by Lauryn Hill followed. [...] "Flaws and All" [...] featured Beyoncé making facial expressions as she dedicated the song to her fans, singing the lines, [...] "I don't know why you love me/And that's why I love you." [...] During the performance of [...] "Irreplaceable", she asked from the crowd to sing the lines [...] "to the left" [...] along with her and made a competition in singing between sections. The first verse and the chorus were sung solely by the crowd. The intro of [...] "Countdown" [...] began with Beyoncé's ululations and moans, the Boyz II Men sample used in the song, and the opening drum crack and continued with the song's music video being projected on the screen. Brief snippets of Beyoncé performing Destiny's Child's [...] "Jumpin', Jumpin'" [...] (2000) followed. [...] "Run the World (Girls)" [...] {{was performed}} with a march choreography and a funky version of [...] "Why Don't You Love Me" [...] followed. During the end, the song's beat got transformed into an extended outro. Prior {{the end of the show}} a home-video sequence showing Beyoncé biking, drinking a pint of Guinness, going whale-watching and holding her daughter Blue Ivy Carter with a voice-over was shown. Referencing her song [...] "I Was Here" [...] which was played in the background, she said [...] "When I leave this world I'll leave no regrets. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>leave</b> my mark, so everyone will know I was here". Beyoncé went on to perform [...] "Halo" [...] in a red dress which she opened with a performance of Whitney Houston's [...] "I Will Always Love You" [...] as a tribute to her following her death. The show ended with a performance of [...] "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)" [...] which featured a Bob Fosse-inspired choreography and a singalong with the crowd.|$|E

Khorkina said, [...] "I thought she could win the gold. I'm glad I could give her that opportunity." [...] She then won the uneven bars final with a score of 9.862. Commenting on the {{all-around}} final, Khorkina said, [...] "If I didn't get over the disappointment, I wouldn't be Khorkina. I wouldn't be standing here with the gold medal. It still hurts a lot.

2500|$|Perhaps {{the most}} obvious {{recurring}} linguistic motif in the play is that of state power as specifically represented by the crown and the throne. Both words occur multiple times throughout the play. For example, in Act 1, Scene 1 (which is set in parliament, with York spending most of the scene sitting on the throne), Warwick introduces the imagery, saying to York [...] "Before I see thee seated in that throne,/Which now the House of Lancaster usurps,/I vow by heaven these eyes shall never close" [...] (ll.22–24). He then introduces the word [...] "crown"; [...] "Resolve thee Richard, claim the English crown" [...] (l.49). Immediately after York sits in the throne, Henry enters, exclaiming, [...] "My lords, look where the sturdy rebel sits,/Even in the chair of state. Belike he means,/Backed {{by the power of}} Warwick, that false peer,/To aspire unto the crown and reign as king" [...] (ll.50–54). During the subsequent debate over legitimacy, Exeter tells York [...] "Thy father was a traitor to the crown" [...] (l.80), to which York replies [...] "Exeter, thou art a traitor to the crown" [...] (l.81). Also during the debate, Henry asks York, [...] "And shall I stand, and thou sit in my throne?" [...] (l.85). York next asks Henry, [...] "Will you we show our title to the crown? (l.103), to which Henry says [...] "What title hast thou, traitor, to the crown?" [...] (l.105). As the debate reaches an impasse, Richard urges York, [...] "Father, tear the crown from the usurper's head" [...] (l.115). Henry refuses to yield however, declaring [...] "Think'st thou that <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>leave</b> my kingly throne?" [...] (l.125). Subsequently, during the debate about the conflict between Henry Bolingbrook and Richard II, York asks Exeter if Richard's abdication [...] "was prejudicial to his crown?" [...] (l.145) to which Exeter responds [...] "No, for he could not so resign his crown" [...] (l.146). York then demands that Henry [...] "Confirm the crown to me and to mine heirs" [...] (l.173), to which Henry reluctantly agrees, [...] "I here entail/The crown to thee and to thine heirs forever" [...] (ll.195–196).|$|E
