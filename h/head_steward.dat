The <b>head</b> <b>steward</b> at the event, Nazir Hoosein, had a history of making strange decisions, as he was <b>head</b> <b>steward</b> at the 1998 British Grand Prix, where Michael Schumacher won the race in the pitlane, which led to Hoosein losing his license to be a steward for a year.|$|E
500|$|During the trip, Danner {{wonders if}} the Mayans and Egyptians had {{discovered}} the same formula as his father, [...] "which could be poured into the veins of the slaves , making them stronger than engines". There, he works as the <b>head</b> <b>steward</b> of the hired Mayan helpers and proves himself an asset to the team. But when a mishap reveals his great strength to the professor, the elderly man suggests Danner use his father's formula {{to create a new}} race of men known as the [...] "Sons of Dawn", who will use their powers to right the world's wrongs. The idea appeals to him at first, but Danner fears that these sons would also be hated by humanity for their superiority and treated much the same as himself. In the end, he climbs a mountain amidst an oncoming thunderstorm, and is struck dead by lightning while praying to God. The formula is lost in the resulting fire. The professor discovers his charred remains three days later and buries him among the Mayan ruins.|$|E

The group comprises 17 elected members of the Leaving Class: one steward for each house (the heads of houses) plus seven—the <b>Head</b> <b>Steward</b> and six stewards with portfolio—chosen {{by the majority of}} the whole student body. In addition to the stewards, students can enter the prefects program, requiring them to show leadership through their senior years in order to be awarded the title of Prefect upon graduation, the highest recognition UCC offers [...] "for citizenship and leadership." ...|$|E

60|$|The list {{did not say}} of itself, {{but with}} the help of the <b>head</b> <b>steward's</b> diagram it said that the gentleman at the head of the table was Mr. R. M. Kenby; the father and the {{daughter}} were Mr. E. B. Triscoe and Miss Triscoe; the bridal pair were Mr. and Mrs. Leffers; the mother and her son were Mrs. Adding and Mr. Roswell Adding; the young man who came in last was Mr. L. J. Burnamy. March carried the list, with these names carefully checked and rearranged on a neat plan of the table, to his wife in her steamer chair, and left her to make out the history and the character of the people from it. In this sort of conjecture long experience had taught him his futility, and he strolled up and down and looked at the life about him with no wish to penetrate it deeply.|$|R

5000|$|A majordomo is {{a person}} who speaks, makes arrangements, or takes charge for another. Typically, the term refers to the highest (major) person of a {{household}} (domūs or domicile) staff, a head servant who acts on behalf of the owner of a large or significant residence. Similar terms include castellan, concierge, chamberlain, seneschal, mayor of the palace, maître d'hôtel, <b>head</b> butler, and <b>steward.</b>|$|R
60|$|In {{the cabins}} the berths {{were not made}} up, and those who {{remained}} below had to sit on their hard edges, or on the sofas, which were cumbered with, hand-bags and rolls of shawls. At an early hour after breakfast the bedroom stewards began to get the steamer trunks out and pile them in the corridors; the servants all became more caressingly attentive; and people who had left off settling {{the amount of the}} fees they were going to give, anxiously conferred together. The question whether you ought ever to give the <b>head</b> <b>steward</b> anything pressed crucially at the early lunch, and Kenby brought only a partial relief by saying that he always regarded the <b>head</b> <b>steward</b> as an officer of the ship. March made the experiment of offering him six marks, and the <b>head</b> <b>steward</b> took them quite as if he were not an officer of the ship. He also collected a handsome fee for the music, which is the tax levied on all German ships beyond the tolls exacted on the steamers of other nations.|$|E

[...] Men in the Achaemenid era wore long beards, with warriors adorning theirs with jewelry. Men also commonly wore beards during the Safavid and Qajar eras.|$|R
60|$|Sir Henry Lee {{remained}} still confused, {{and unable}} to answer, when there arrived a fourth person, whom the cries of Alice had summoned to the spot. This was Joceline Joliffe, one of the under-keepers of the walk, who, seeing how matters stood, brandished his quarterstaff, a weapon from which he never parted, and having made it describe the figure of eight in a flourish through the air, would have brought it down with a vengeance upon the <b>head</b> of the <b>steward,</b> had not Sir Henry interposed.|$|R

60|$|It is {{possible}} that, lacking {{the initiative to}} make his way down the long aisle and find a table for himself, he might have stood there indefinitely, but for the restless activity of Adams, the <b>head</b> <b>steward.</b> It was Adams' mission in life to flit to and fro, hauling would-be lunchers to their destinations, as a St. Bernard dog hauls travelers out of Alpine snowdrifts. He sighted Lord Emsworth and secured him with a genteel pounce.|$|E
60|$|Michael {{remained}} on the beach, waiting invitation, his mind not quite made up, but so nearly so that all that was required was that lip-noise. Dag Daughtry made the lip-noise so low {{that the old man}} did not hear, and Michael, springing clear from sand to canoe, was on board without wetting his feet. Using Daughtry's shoulder for a stepping-place, he passed over him and down {{into the bottom of the}} canoe. Daughtry kissed with his lips again, and Michael turned around so as to face him, sat down, and rested his <b>head</b> on the <b>steward's</b> knees.|$|R
5000|$|On July 23, Abel Tasman {{was entered}} in the Coaching Club American Oaks at Saratoga, run at a {{distance}} of [...] miles. She broke poorly and settled near the back of the field of seven, but was urged to the lead down the backstretch when the pace slowed. As they turned into the stretch, Salty mounted a brief challenge on the outside while Elate started closing ground on the rail. Smith guided Abel Tasman closer towards the rail, making it harder for Elate to go by. The two dueled for the final furlong with Abel Tasman prevailing by a <b>head.</b> The <b>stewards</b> mounted an inquiry about possible interference in the stretch run but allowed the results to stand. [...] "It's just good, old-fashioned race riding," [...] said Smith. [...] "By no means did I put (Elate) in any harm. My filly really waits (for other horses to challenge her). Once she was in there, she was engaged. I made sure that I didn't touch (Elate). I made it tight, but there's no rules that say you can't make it tight." ...|$|R
50|$|Less {{than three}} weeks after his defeat at Epsom, Dawn Approach {{returned}} to the one-mile distance for the St. James's Palace Stakes at Royal Ascot. In this race he was opposed again by Toronado but his main challenger appeared to be Aidan O'Brien's Irish 2000 Guineas winner Magician: Dawn Approach started the 5/4 favourite, with Magician on 5/2 and Toronado on 5/1. Manning settled the colt behind the leaders before moving up on the outside in the straight. Two furlongs from the finish Glory Awaits veered to the left, colliding with Magician, who in turn bumped Dawn Approach who in turn made contact with Toronado. Dawn Approach recovered from the incident {{to take the lead}} and got the better of a sustained struggle with Toronado to win by a short <b>head.</b> The raceourse <b>stewards</b> held an enquiry into the incident which had occurred early in the straight, but the result of the race was upheld.|$|R
60|$|Lord Emsworth had his lucid moments; {{and in the}} {{one that}} {{occurred}} now it came home {{to him that he}} was not talking to himself, as he had imagined, but confiding intimate family secrets to the <b>head</b> <b>steward</b> of his club's dining-room. He checked himself abruptly, and with a slight decrease of amiability fixed his gaze on the bill of fare and ordered cold beef. For an instant he felt resentful against Adams for luring him on to soliloquize; but the next moment his whole mind was gripped by the fascinating spectacle of Mr. Simmonds dealing with a wedge of Stilton cheese, and Adams was forgotten.|$|E
6000|$|There seemed {{scarcely}} a vacant {{place in the}} huge saloon; through the oval openings in the centre they {{looked down into the}} lower saloon and up into the music-room, as thickly thronged with breakfasters. The tables were brightened with the bouquets and the floral designs of ships, anchors, harps, and doves sent to the lady passengers, and at one time the Marches {{thought they were going to}} be put before a steam-yacht realized to the last detail in blue and white violets. The ports of the saloon were open, and showed the level sea; the ship rode with no motion except the tremor from her screws. The sound of talking and laughing rose with the clatter of knives and forks and the clash of crockery; the homely smell of the coffee and steak and fish mixed with the spice of the roses and carnations; the stewards ran hither and thither, and a young foolish joy of travel welled up in the elderly hearts of the pair. When the <b>head</b> <b>steward</b> turned out the swivel-chairs where they were to sit they both made an inclination toward the people already at table, as if it had been a company at some far-forgotten table d'hote in the later sixties. The <b>head</b> <b>steward</b> seemed to understand as well as speak English, but the table-stewards had only an effect of English, which they eked out with [...] "Bleace!" [...] for all occasions of inquiry, apology, or reassurance, as the equivalent of their native [...] "Bitte!" [...] Otherwise there was no reason to suppose that they did not speak German, which was the language of a good half of the passengers. The stewards looked English, however, in conformity to what seems the ideal of every kind of foreign seafaring people, and that went a good way toward making them intelligible.|$|E
60|$|In one of {{the many}} visits to the {{steamship}} office which his wife's anxieties obliged him to make, March had discussed the question of seats in the dining-saloon. At first he had his ambition for the captain's table, but they convinced him more easily than he afterwards convinced Mrs. March that the captain's table had become a superstition of the past, and conferred no special honor. It proved in the event that the captain of the Norumbia had the good feeling to dine in a lower saloon among the passengers who paid least for their rooms. But while the Marches were still in their ignorance of this, they decided to get what adventure they could out of letting the <b>head</b> <b>steward</b> put them where he liked, and they came in to breakfast with a careless curiosity to see what he had done for them.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the loss}} of King Eärnur, his steward Mardil {{continued}} to rule Gondor in his name, since Eärnur's death was not affirmed, and Mardil's descendants held to this practice. The Ruling Stewards wielded {{the authority of the}} Kings, but never presumed to take the title for themselves: each succeeding Steward swore an oath to yield the rule of the realm back to the King, if he should ever return, although with the passing of centuries the oath became more a formality. The office had become hereditary already with Mardil's grandfather, and thereafter passed to the eldest son if there was any; otherwise, the heir was selected among the near kin by the Council of Gondor. The latter body consisted, at least {{at the time of the}} War of the Ring, of the captains of armed forces, was <b>headed</b> by the <b>Steward,</b> and is recorded to have debated whether to risk retaking Osgiliath or not. The Council's duties and powers are not elaborated further, but it is also credited with rejecting Arvedui's claim after the death of Ondoher and should possibly be equated with [...] "the elders" [...] that sent Boromir to Rivendell.|$|R
5000|$|In 1954, Premonition was {{prepared}} for the major staying races. To assist his preparation, Wyatt purchased a supposedly ordinary French horse named Osborne to act as his training partner and pacemaker. His season began successfully as he won the Yorkshire Cup in impressive style by three lengths from Eastern Emperor, Childe Harolde and Osborne. Premonition and Osborne ran next in the Winston Churchill Stakes at Hurst Park. Before the race, Boyd-Rochfort told Osborne's rider, an inexperienced jockey named Royce Burrows, to set the pace for Premonition, the 1/8 favourite, and to [...] "be second if you can". Osborne led Premonition into the straight, where it soon became apparent that he was travelling much more easily than his better fancied stable companion. In the closing stages, Burrows made little attempt to ride a finish, allowing the hard-ridden Premonition to win by a <b>head.</b> The racecourse <b>stewards</b> held an enquiry and referred the matter to the Jockey Club, which fined Boyd-Rochfort £100 for his ambiguous instructions to Burrows. Boyd-Rochfort responded {{by saying that the}} punishment seemed to question his honesty and that he felt like retiring from the sport.|$|R
5000|$|On September 27, Main Sequence {{attempted}} to gain his third consecutive Grade I {{victory in the}} Joe Hirsch Turf Classic at Belmont Park. As well as Twilight Eclipse and Imagining, his opponents included Big Blue Kitten (winner of the United Nations Stakes and the Sword Dancer Invitational in 2013) and Real Solution (winner of the Arlington Million and the Manhattan Handicap). The gelding raced in fifth before moving up into third on the outside on the final turn. He took the lead inside the final furlong and held off the renewed challenge of Twilight Eclipse to win by <b>head.</b> The racecourse <b>stewards</b> held an inquiry into interference caused when Main Sequence hung to the left in the closing stages and bumped the runner-up, but allowed the result to stand. Maragh admitted that on this occasion, he may have sent the horse into the lead too early saying [...] "When he made the lead, {{it was a little}} sooner than we wanted. He started loafing a little bit; I tried to make him see the other horse and a little contact happened. I felt like I was going to be OK on the inquiry, but it was nerve-wracking." ...|$|R
6000|$|The Amstel {{had lost}} {{so much time in}} the rough weather of her first days out that she could not make it up with her old-fashioned single screw. She was at best a ten-day boat, {{counting}} from Sandy Hook to Boulogne, and she had not been four days out when she promised to break her record for slowness. Three days later Miss Rasmith said to Breckon, as he took the chair which her mother agilely abandoned to him beside her: [...] "The <b>head</b> <b>steward</b> says it will be a twelve-day trip, end our bedroom steward thinks more. What is the consensus of opinion in the smoking-room? Where are you going, mother? Are you planning to leave Mr. Breckon and me alone again? It isn't necessary. We couldn't get away from each other if we tried, and all we ask--Well, I suppose age must be indulged in its little fancies," [...] she called after Mrs. Rasmith.|$|E
6000|$|... "I know," [...] {{said the}} other lady, with caressing intelligence. [...] "That is just the way with--" [...] She stopped, {{and looked at the}} young man whom the <b>head</b> <b>steward</b> was {{bringing}} up to take the vacant place next to March. He came forward, stuffing his cap {{into the pocket of his}} blue serge sack, and smiled down on the company with such happiness in his gay eyes that March wondered what chance at this late day could have given any human creature his content so absolute, and what calamity could be lurking round the corner to take it out of him. The new-comer looked at March as if he knew him, and March saw at a second glance that he was the young fellow who had told him about the mother put off after the start. He asked him whether there was any change in the weather yet outside, and he answered eagerly, as if the chance to put his happiness into the mere sound of words were a favor done him, that their ship had just spoken one of the big Hanseatic mailboats, and she had signalled back that she had met ice; so that they would probably keep a southerly course, and not have it cooler till they were off the Banks.|$|E
6000|$|He told me I might lodge {{the money}} in the bank as an account, and its being entered into the books would entitle me to the money at any time, and if I was in the north I might draw bills on the cashier and receive it when I would; but that then it would be esteemed as running cash, and the bank would give no {{interest}} for it; that I might buy stock with it, and so it would lie in store for me, but that then if I wanted to dispose if it, I must come up to town on purpose to transfer it, and even it would be with some difficulty I should receive the half-yearly dividend, unless I was here in person, or had some friend I could trust with having the stock in his name to do it for me, and that would have the same difficulty in it as before; and with that he looked hard at me and smiled a little. At last, says he, 'Why do you not get a <b>head</b> <b>steward,</b> madam, that may take you and your money together into keeping, and then you would have the trouble taken off your hands?' 'Ay, sir, and the money too, it may be,' said I; 'for truly I find the hazard that way is as much as 'tis t'other way'; but I remember I said secretly to myself, 'I wish you would ask me the question fairly, I would consider very seriously on it before I said No.' ...|$|E
5000|$|US Army Ranger {{was sent}} to England and stepped up in class for the Group Three Chester Vase (a major trial race for the Epsom Derby) on 5 May at Chester Racecourse. He was made the 4/11 {{favourite}} ahead of his stablemate Port Douglas (ridden by Seamie Heffernan) and four British-trained colts. After racing in second place behind Port Douglas (who was carrying four pounds more) he moved up on the inside {{to take the lead}} a furlong out. Port Douglas rallied and the favourite was [...] "hard pressed" [...] in the final strides before prevailing by a short <b>head.</b> The racecourse <b>stewards</b> held an inquiry into possible [...] "team tactics" [...] by the riders of the two O'Brien runners but took no action. Ryan Moore commented [...] "He travelled through the race like a very good horse and I wanted to teach him plenty today. He just wanted to hang left at the end and he didn’t switch his leads and got a bit tired, but he’ll come on plenty for it. He’s a beautiful mover with a good mind and a very well-balanced horse. The good ones move very well and he’s one of those." ...|$|R
50|$|The first {{event was}} held on the Boavista street course in Porto on 17 June 1951 as a sports car race. The Grand Prix was moved to Monsanto Park, Lisbon, in 1954 as a one-off. Monsanto, like the Boavista circuit was a {{hazardous}} street circuit lined with trees and had lots of elevation change and fast sweepers; but Monsanto was quite wide as opposed to Boavista, which was narrow. Sportscar events continued until 1957 when the following year it {{became part of the}} Formula One world championship. The first Formula One race {{was held on}} 14 August 1958 in Boavista. This circuit was situated in a hazardous area; it was laid out through the town and included sections of cobbled street and even tramlines. British drivers Stirling Moss in a Vanwall and Mike Hawthorn in a Ferrari were {{at the top of the}} championship table, battling it out for the first eight rain-interrupted laps. Moss then pulled away as Hawthorn slipped behind Frenchman Jean Behra in a BRM until the British car hit spark plug problems. But the drama was only just beginning as a protest was made against Hawthorn who, it was claimed, when he had restarted his car had driven a few yards in the wrong direction, which was against the rules and meant that Hawthorn was to be disqualified. As soon as he heard it, Moss <b>headed</b> to the <b>stewards</b> and told them Hawthorn had been off the course when he was spotted and that was not against the rules. Moss's evidence swung the decision, and no action was taken. Had the protest been upheld, Hawthorn would have lost seven points - six for finishing second and an extra one for recording the fastest lap. In the event, Moss's intervention allowed Hawthorn to win the Drivers' Championship title by one point - from Moss. This race was followed in 1959 by a Grand Prix at Monsanto, which was won again by Moss, this time in a mid-engined Cooper. Australian Jack Brabham hit a telegraph pole after swerving to hit the twice lapped local driver Mario Cabral; Brabham was thrown out of the car and landed on the track; he was then narrowly missed by American Masten Gregory. After this race, Monsanto Park was abandoned, and F1 returned to Boavista in 1960; this race was won by Brabham in a Cooper. The Portuguese Grand Prix was then discontinued and did not return until 1984.|$|R
60|$|She {{did not ask}} who the swells were, and March took {{no trouble}} to find out. He took no trouble to get a passenger-list, {{and he had the}} more trouble when he tried at last; the lists seemed to have all vanished, as they have a habit of doing, after the first day; the one that he made {{interest}} for with the <b>head</b> <b>steward</b> was a second-hand copy, and had no one he knew in it but the Eltwins. The social solitude, however, was rather favorable to certain other impressions. There seemed even more elderly people than there were on the Norumbia; the human atmosphere was gray and sober; there was nothing of the gay expansion of the outward voyage; there was little talking or laughing among those autumnal men who were going seriously and anxiously home, with faces fiercely set for the coming grapple; or necks meekly bowed for the yoke. They had eaten their cake, and it had been good, but there remained a discomfort in the digestion. They sat about in silence, and March fancied that the flown summer was as dreamlike to each of them as it now was to him. He hated to be of their dreary company, but spiritually {{he knew that he was}} of it; and he vainly turned to cheer himself with the younger passengers. Some matrons who went about clad in furs amused him, for they must have been unpleasantly warm in their jackets and boas; nothing but the hope of being able to tell the customs inspector with a good conscience that the things had been worn, would have sustained one lady draped from head to foot in Astrakhan.|$|E
