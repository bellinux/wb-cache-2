Because epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation and histone modifications, modulate age-related gene expression during development, and are highly conserved among species, {{the current study}} examined the epigenetic regulation of age-related expression of the Cyp 2 <b>d</b> <b>genes</b> in mouse liver. DNA methylation (DNAme), histone 3 lysine 4 dimethylation (H 3 K 4 me 2), and histone 3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H 3 K 27 me 3) was established by ChIP-on-chip tiling microarrays from mouse livers at prenatal, neonatal, and adult stages. Levels of DNAme, H 3 K 4 me 2, and H 3 K 27 me 3 were analyzed in a genomic region containing the Cyp 2 <b>d</b> clustering <b>genes</b> and their surrounding genes. Gradually increased expression levels of the Cyp 2 d 9, Cyp 2 d 10, Cyp 2 d 22, and Cyp 2 <b>d</b> 26 <b>genes</b> from prenatal, through neonatal, to adult are associated with gradually increased levels of H 3 K 4 me 2 in the nucleosomes associated with these genes.

40|$|Background - A {{considerable}} number of individuals suffer from oral allergy syndrome (OAS) to apple, resulting in the avoidance of apple consumption. Apple cultivars differ greatly in their allergenic properties, but knowledge of the causes for such differences is incomplete. Mal d 1 is considered the major apple allergen. For Mal d 1, {{a wide range of}} isoallergens and variants exist, and they are encoded by a large gene family. To identify the specific proteins/genes that are potentially involved in the allergy, we developed a PCR assay to monitor the expression of each individual Mal <b>d</b> 1 <b>gene.</b> Gene-specific primer pairs were designed for the exploitation of sequence differences among Mal <b>d</b> 1 <b>genes.</b> The specificity of these primers was validated using both in silico and in vitro techniques.

Results - We successfully developed gene-specific primer pairs for each of the 31 Mal <b>d</b> 1 <b>genes</b> and incorporated them into a qRT-PCR assay. The results from the application of the assay showed that 11 genes were not expressed in fruit.

50|$|One {{study by}} {{focused on a}} {{regulatory}} archipelago, a region with “islands” of coding sequences surrounded by vast noncoding regions. The study, which explores the effects of regulation on the hox genes, initially focused on two enhancer sequences, GCR and Prox, which are located 200 basepairs and 50 basepairs respectively upstream of the Hox D locus. To manipulate the region, the study inverted the two enhancer sequences and discovered no major effects on the transcription of the Hox <b>D</b> <b>gene,</b> even though the two sequences were the closest sequences to the gene. Thus, the turned to the gene desert that flanked the GCR sequence upstream and found 5 regulatory islands within it that could regulate the gene. To select the most likely candidate, the study then applied several individual and multiple deletions to the five islands to observe the effects. These varied deletions only resulted in minor effects including physical abnormalities or a few missing digits. When the experiment was taken {{a step further and}} applied a deletion of the entire 830 kilobase gene desert, the functionality of the entire Hox D locus was rendered inactive. This indicates that the neighboring gene desert, as an entire 830 kilobase unit (including the five island sequences within it), serves as an important regulator of a single gene that spans merely 50 kilobases. Therefore, these results hinted at the regulatory effects of flanking gene deserts. This study was supported by a later observation through a comparison between fluorescence in situ hybridization and chromosome conformation capture which discovered that the Hox D locus was the most decondensed portion in the region. This meant that it had relatively higher activity in comparison to the flanking gene deserts. Hence, the Hox D could be regulated by specific nearby enhancer sequences that were not expressed in unison. However, the does caution that proximity is inaccurate when either analytical method is used. Thus, associations between regulatory gene deserts and their target promoters seem to have variable distances and are not required to act as borders. The variability in distance demonstrates that distance may be another important factor that is determined by gene deserts. For instance, distal enhancers may interact with their target promoters through looping interactions which must act over a certain distance. Thus, proximity is not an accurate predictor of enhancers: enhancers do not need to border their target sequence to regulate them. While this leads to a variation in distances, the average distance between transcription start sites and the interaction complex mediated by their enhancer elements is 120 kilobases upstream of the start site. Gene deserts {{may play a role in}} constructing this distance to allow maximal looping to occur. Given that the mechanism of enhancer complex formation is a fairly simply regulated mechanism (the structures that are recruited into the enhancing complex have various regulatory controls that control construction), more than 50% of promoters have several long-range interactions. Certain core genes even have up to 20 possible enhancing interactions. There is a curious bias for complexes to form only upstream of the promoters. Thus, given the correlation that many regulatory gene deserts appear upstream of their target promoters, it is possible that the more immediate role that gene deserts play is in long-range regulation of key sequences. As the ideal formation of enhancer interactions requires specific constructs, a possible side-product of the regulatory roles of gene deserts may be the conservation of genes: to retain the specific lengths of loops and order of regulating genes hidden in gene deserts, certain portions of gene deserts are more highly conserved than others when passing through inheritance events. These conserved noncoding sequences (CNS) are directly associated with syntenic inheritance in all vertebrates. Thus, the presence of these CNSs could serve to conserve of large regions of genes. Although distance may vary in regulatory gene deserts, distance appears to have an upper limit in conservative gene deserts. CNSs were initially thought to occur close to their conserved genes: earlier estimates placed most CNSs in proximity of gene sequences. However, the expansion of genetic data has revealed that several CNSs reside up to 2.5 megabases from their target genes, with the majority of CNSs falling between 1 and 2 megabases. This range, which was measured for the human genome, is varied among different species. For instance, in comparison to humans, the Fugu fish has a smaller range, with an estimated maximum distance of a few hundred kilobases. Regardless of the difference in lengths, CNSs work in similar methods in both species. Thus, as functions differ between gene deserts, so do their contents.|$|E

This leads to a deficiency in vesicle transport and storage, which affects neurotransmitter vesicle turnover and release in the central nervous system. Since the genomic sequence of the Ap 3 <b>d</b> 1 <b>gene</b> of mocha mouse is not known, precise mapping of the deletion as well as reliable genotyping protocols are lacking. Findings We sequenced the Ap 3 <b>d</b> 1 <b>gene</b> (HGNC GeneID: 8943) around the deletion site in the mocha mouse and revealed a 10639 bp deletion covering exon 2 to 6. Subsequently, new PCR primers were designed yielding a reliable genotyping protocol of both newborn and adult tissue. To examine the genotypes further, hippocampal neurons were cultured from mocha and control mice. Patch-clamp recordings showed that mocha neurons had a higher input resistance, and that autaptic EPSC in mocha cultures depressed faster and stronger as compared with control cultures. Conclusion Our study reports the sequence of the deleted part of the Ap 3 <b>d</b> 1 <b>gene</b> in mocha mice, {{as well as a}} reliable PCR-based genotyping protocol. We cultured hippocampal neurons from control and mocha mice, and found a difference in input resistance of the neurons, and in the synaptic short-term plasticity of glutamatergic autapses showing a larger synaptic depression than controls. The described procedures may be useful for the future utilization of the mocha mouse as a model of defective vesicle biogenesis. Importantly, as genotyping by eye color is complicated in newborn mice, the designed protocol is so fast and reliable that newborn mice could rapidly be genotyped and hippocampal neurons dissociated and cultured, which is normally best done at P 0 -P 2. </p...|$|R

To elucidate duration-dependent effects of the ICU intervention on molecular and functional networks that control the muscle wasting and weakness associated with AQM, a gene expression profile was analyzed at time points varying from 6 hours to 14 days in a unique experimental rat model mimicking ICU conditions, i. e., post-synaptically paralyzed, mechanically ventilated and extensively monitored animals. RESULTS: During the observation period, 1583 genes were significantly up- or down-regulated by factors of two or greater. A significant temporal gene expression pattern was constructed at short (6 h- 4 days), intermediate (5 - 8 days) and long (9 - 14 days) durations. A striking early and maintained up-regulation (6 h- 14 d) of muscle atrogenes (muscle ring-finger 1 /tripartite motif-containing 63 and F-box protein 32 /atrogin- 1) was observed, followed by an upregulation of the proteolytic systems at intermediate and long durations (5 - 14 d). Oxidative stress response genes and genes that take part in amino acid catabolism, cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, muscle development, and protein synthesis together with myogenic factors were significantly up-regulated from 5 to 14 days. At 9 - 14 <b>d,</b> <b>genes</b> involved in immune response and the caspase cascade were up-regulated. At 5 - 14 <b>d,</b> <b>genes</b> related to contractile (myosin heavy chain and myosin binding protein C), regulatory (troponin, tropomyosin), developmental, caveolin- 3, extracellular matrix, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, cytoskeleton/sarcomere regulation and mitochondrial proteins were down-regulated. An activation of genes related to muscle growth and new muscle fiber formation (increase of 3 myogenic factors and JunB and down-regulation of myostatin) and up-regulation of genes that code protein synthesis and translation factors were found from 5 to 14 days. CONCLUSIONS: Novel temporal patterns of gene expression have been uncovered, suggesting a unique, coordinated and highly complex mechanism underlying the muscle wasting associated with AQM in ICU patients and providing new target genes and avenues for intervention studies...|$|R

The Mal <b>d</b> 1 <b>gene</b> family {{is known to have}} at least 7 intron-containing and 11 intronless members that have been mapped in clusters on three linkage groups. In this study, the allelic diversity of the seven intron-containing Mal <b>d</b> 1 <b>genes</b> was assessed among a set of apple cultivars by sequencing or indirectly through pedigree genotyping. Protein variant constitutions were subsequently compared with S kin P rick T est (SPT) responses to study the association of deduced protein variants with allergenicity in a set of 14 cultivars. Results From the seven intron-containing Mal <b>d</b> 1 <b>genes</b> investigated, Mal <b>d</b> 1. 01 and Mal d 1. 02 were highly conserved, as nine out of ten cultivars coded for the same protein variant, while only one cultivar coded for a second variant. Mal d 1. 04, Mal d 1. 05 and Mal d 1. 06 A, B and C were more variable, coding for three to six different protein variants. Comparison of Mal d 1 allelic composition between the high-allergenic cultivar Golden Delicious and the low-allergenic cultivars Santana and Priscilla, which are linked in pedigree, showed an association between the protein variants coded by the Mal d 1. 04 and - 1. 06 A genes (both located on linkage group 16) with allergenicity. This association was confirmed in 10 other cultivars. In addition, Mal d 1. 06 A allele dosage effects associated with the degree of allergenicity based on prick to prick testing.

40|$|Background Mal d 1 {{is a major}} apple {{allergen}} causing food allergic {{symptoms of}} the oral allergy syndrome (OAS) in birch-pollen sensitised patients. The Mal <b>d</b> 1 <b>gene</b> family {{is known to have}} at least 7 intron-containing and 11 intronless members that have been mapped in clusters on three linkage groups. In this study, the allelic diversity of the seven intron-containing Mal <b>d</b> 1 <b>genes</b> was assessed among a set of apple cultivars by sequencing or indirectly through pedigree genotyping. Protein variant constitutions were subsequently compared with Skin Prick Test (SPT) responses to study the association of deduced protein variants with allergenicity in a set of 14 cultivars. Results From the seven intron-containing Mal <b>d</b> 1 <b>genes</b> investigated, Mal <b>d</b> 1. 01 and Mal d 1. 02 were highly conserved, as nine out of ten cultivars coded for the same protein variant, while only one cultivar coded for a second variant. Mal d 1. 04, Mal d 1. 05 and Mal d 1. 06 A, B and C were more variable, coding for three to six different protein variants. Comparison of Mal d 1 allelic composition between the high-allergenic cultivar Golden Delicious and the low-allergenic cultivars Santana and Priscilla, which are linked in pedigree, showed an association between the protein variants coded by the Mal d 1. 04 and - 1. 06 A genes (both located on linkage group 16) with allergenicity. This association was confirmed in 10 other cultivars. In addition, Mal d 1. 06 A allele dosage effects associated with the degree of allergenicity based on prick to prick testing. Conversely, no associations were observed for the protein variants coded by the Mal d 1. 01 (on linkage group 13), - 1. 02, - 1. 06 B, - 1. 06 C genes (all on linkage group 16), nor by the Mal <b>d</b> 1. 05 <b>gene</b> (on linkage group 6).

40|$|The chicken adult alpha-globin genes, alpha A and alpha D, {{are closely}} linked in {{chromosomal}} DNA and are coordinately expressed in vivo in an approximate 3 : 1 ratio, respectively. When subcloned DNAs containing {{one or the}} other gene are stably transfected into QT 6 quail fibroblasts, the alpha A-globin gene is expressed at measurable RNA levels, but the alpha <b>D</b> <b>gene</b> is not. The alpha A gene expression can be considerably increased by the presence of a linked Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat enhancer, but that of the alpha <b>D</b> <b>gene</b> remains undetectable. Transfection with subclones containing both genes, either in cis or in trans, leads to considerably reduced alpha A RNA levels and still no observable alpha <b>D</b> <b>gene</b> expression. Transfection with deleted subclones suggests that maximal expression levels in this system require the alpha A-globin gene promoter, as opposed to that of the alpha <b>D</b> <b>gene,</b> but that such expression is greatly reduced by one or more DNA sequences which lie approximately 2, 000 base pairs upstream of the alpha A gene, within the body of the alpha <b>D</b> <b>gene...</b>|$|E

40|$|We {{have studied}} the roles of {{estrogen}} receptor-a (ERa) and the Stat 5 b form of STAT (signal transducers and activators of tran-scription) in sex-specific expression of Cyp 2 a 4 (steroid 15 a-hydroxylase) and Cyp 2 d 9 (steroid 16 a-hydroxylase) genes us-ing ERa-deficient mice. ERa deficiency resulted in the repression of the female-specific Cyp 2 a 4 and expression of the male-specific Cyp 2 <b>d</b> 9 <b>genes,</b> respectively in females. In ERa-deficient males, the Cyp 2 <b>d</b> 9 <b>gene</b> continued to be expressed. Nuclear localization of Stat 5 b occurs in both sexes of ERa-deficient mice, although it is normally observed in only wild-type males. Nuclear localization of Stat 5 b correlates with the repression of Cyp 2 a 4 and expression of Cyp 2 d 9, respectively. Because Stat 5 b was not detectable in liver nuclear extracts prepared from hypophysectomized ERa-deficient females, th...|$|R
40|$|Abstract European populations exhibit {{progressive}} sensitisation to food allergens, {{and apples}} {{are one of}} the foods for which sensitisation is observed most frequently. Apple cultivars vary greatly in their allergenic characteristics, and {{a better understanding of the}} genetic basis of low allergenicity may therefore allow allergic individuals to increase their fruit intake. Mal d 1 is considered to be a major apple allergen, and this protein is encoded by the most complex allergen gene family. Not all Mal d 1 members are likely to be involved in allergenicity. Therefore, additional knowledge about the existence and characteristics of the different Mal <b>d</b> 1 <b>genes</b> is required. In the present study, we investigated the genomic organisation of the Mal <b>d</b> 1 <b>gene</b> cluster in linkage group 16 of apple through the sequencing of two bacterial artificial chromosome clones. The results provided new information on the composition of this family with respect to the number and orientation of functional and pseudogenes and their physical distances. The results were compared with the apple and peach genome sequences that have recently been made available. A broad analysis of the whole apple genome revealed the presence of new genes in this family, and a complete list of the observed Mal <b>d</b> 1 <b>genes</b> is supplied. Thus, this study provides an important contribution towards a better understanding of the genetics of the Mal d 1 family and establishes the basis for further research on allelic diversity among cultivars in relation to vari-ation in allergenicity...|$|R
40|$|SummaryInsects use {{taste to}} {{evaluate}} food, hosts, and mates. Drosophila has many “orphan” taste neurons that express no known taste receptors. The Ionotropic Receptor (IR) superfamily {{is best known}} for its role in olfaction, but virtually nothing is known about a clade of ∼ 35 members, the IR 20 a clade. Here, a comprehensive analysis of this clade reveals expression in all taste organs of the fly. Some members are expressed in orphan taste neurons, whereas others are coexpressed with bitter- or sugar-sensing Gustatory receptor (Gr) genes. Analysis of the closely related IR 52 c and IR 52 <b>d</b> <b>genes</b> reveals signatures of adaptive evolution, roles in male mating behavior, and sexually dimorphic expression in neurons of the male foreleg, which contacts females during courtship. These neurons are activated by conspecific females and contact a neural circuit for sexual behavior. Together, these results greatly expand the repertoire of candidate taste and pheromone receptors in the fly...|$|R
