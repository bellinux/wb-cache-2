25|$|However, at the {{beginning}} of 1988 Anita Dobson decided that she wanted to move on after three years playing Angie. She made her final appearance in May that year. Leslie Grantham had also decided that he wanted to move on, but Julia Smith didn't want the programme to suffer the double blow of losing both Den and Angie so close together. The solution to the problem was one of the soap's most complex and creative exercises, that required intricate planning. The idea was to enable Den to stay as an on-screen presence until 1989, while keeping Grantham working for EastEnders only until the autumn of 1988. Tony Holland and writer/editor Bill Lyons came up with a story to put Den in prison for a year, intending that material recorded in a block of intensive filming would then be included in the programme {{for the rest of the}} year. The programme didn't want to make Den into a criminal, however, so he had to be put in prison <b>for</b> <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> that could be justified to the viewing public — otherwise there would be no sympathy for him. The answer lay in a storyline that was running with another character — the rape of Kathy Beale (Gillian Taylforth). After simultaneously getting in way over his head with a criminal organisation (The Firm), Den torched Kathy's rapist's winebar in retaliation, and was then made to take the blame for the deed by the firm. After he refused, went on the run, and was nearly killed by the firm's heavies, Den turned himself into the police and was put on remand at Dickens Hill prison in September 1988. For the next five months he was seen, in the company of a small group of new characters also confined in the prison, on a regular basis in EastEnders. This material was shot in less than a month at Dartmoor Prison, Devon. When these segments were written and recorded, they were done so entirely in isolation and in advance - the production team had no real idea of other material that would have to fit around it.|$|E

Entertainment Weekly writer Darren Franich named Fat Tony's death the ninth Best TV Character Death of 2010, writing, [...] "give the writers some credit <b>for</b> <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> different: In the middle of an otherwise straightforward mob-themed episode, they actually went ahead and killed off Fat Tony, a character who was first introduced almost twenty years ago." ...|$|E

500|$|The song [...] "Talk Soup", {{which is}} about a man who desires to go on {{television}} to tell the world about his strange life, was originally commissioned as a new theme for the E! Entertainment Television show of the same name. Although the producers approved the lyrics and enjoyed the final result, they decided against using it. [...] "Waffle King", the track that had been intended for Off the Deep End, was written as [...] "a song about a guy who becomes incredibly famous <b>for</b> <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> kinda stupid, and then starts taking himself way too seriously".

[...] Comedian Richard Herring recalls watching the show as a recent graduate, commenting that it [...] "was subtle, sophisticated and much too good for kids." [...] According to Moffat, [...] "Press Gang had gone over very, {{very well in the}} industry and I was being touted and romanced all the time."

Writing for About.com, Bill Lamb was critical of Rihanna's decision to perform [...] "Rockstar 101" [...] on American Idol. He commented that previous media reports had indicated that the singer would be debuting a different album track, [...] "Te Amo", which was later released as the sixth and final single from Rated R. Lamb thought that [...] "Rockstar 101" [...] {{was one of the}} [...] "weaker" [...] songs on the album, and predicted that it would be [...] "destined to end the streak of three consecutive top 10 pop hits from the album". While he wrote that the [...] "intensely chilly, distant feel of the song works" [...] within the context of Rated R, Lamb was unsure of whether or not it would appeal to the masses on radio. The song was included on the set list of the Last Girl on Earth Tour (2010–11). Clay Cane for BET wrote that Rihanna [...] "deserves a round of applause <b>for</b> <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> different, straying away from being a standard pop tart". [...] "Rockstar 101" [...] is also included on Rihanna's Diamonds World Tour (2013).|$|E

While he would not recommend the book to readers new to Clarke's work, Elhefnawy said that fans would not regret reading the book. Mark Yon at SFF World said that while this {{is not one of}} Clarke's best works, [...] "it is still very good". He said that even though it is a collaboration, the book is still recognisably Clarke, [...] "with the same humour, the same enthusiasm, the great flashes of inspiration, the big ideas and the same curious positivism that underlines most of Sir Arthur’s work. ... There is a joy throughout here: a joy of learning, of opening up new opportunities and experiences, and a love of mathematics and science." [...] Michael Berry at the San Francisco Chronicle said that the novel does a [...] "stellar job of conveying some of the intellectual fun that can be had by manipulating math." [...] He said that Sri Lanka, Clarke's home for most of his life, is brought [...] "vividly to life", and that despite some minor flaws, The Last Theorem is a [...] "fitting valedictory for Clarke, one of science fiction's most acclaimed authors, and a reminder of Pohl's great relevance to a genre he has championed for more than 70 years." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{the third}} season, Beiste {{continues}} as football coach, and is recruited by Will to co-direct the school musical West Side Story with guidance counselor Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays) and Artie. Beiste orders {{the football team}} to play the Jets in the show. Beiste also takes {{on the task of}} running the school elections. In the episode [...] "The First Time", the coach begins dating Ohio State football recruiter Cooter Menkins (Eric Bruskotter), who is scouting for talent at McKinley, but discovers in [...] "I Kissed a Girl" [...] that Sue has become a rival for Cooter's affections just as Beiste begins {{to fall in love with}} him, thus prompting the character's first solo song, [...] "Jolene". Beiste later tells Emma and Sue, in episode [...] "Yes/No", that Beiste and Cooter have impulsively gotten married. A few months later, in the episode [...] "Choke", Beiste is hit by Cooter and given a black eye. Although initially convinced by Sue and Roz Washington (NeNe Leakes) to leave for Beiste's own safety, the coach later returns home to give Cooter a second chance, before ultimately leaving him and giving him back his wedding ring. The catalyst for the final break is Puck (Mark Salling), a football player and glee club member. Beiste stops a fight between Puck and another student: Puck is wielding a knife, and the coach berates him <b>for</b> <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> so stupid. Puck calls himself a loser, and starts crying; Beiste cries with him, saying that no one ever thinks the two of them hurt because they are [...] "badasses", but they do. Beiste arranges for Puck to retake a geography exam he flunked, which is keeping him from graduating high school, and helps him study for it; he passes and graduates. In the interim, Beiste helps chaperone New Directions on their trip to Chicago, where they win the national show choir championship.|$|E

500|$|Radio Times {{reviewer}} Patrick Mulkern {{likened the}} character to Brigitte Nyborg (Sidse Babett Knudsen) in the Danish series Borgen, {{explaining that the}} two [...] "form a very small club of politicians in TV drama who are hugely sympathetic, female and enjoy a rapid rise to PM". Mulkern felt that Wilton was [...] "a major saving grace" [...] in the [...] "disappointing" [...] "Aliens of London" [...] / [...] "World War Three". The Daily Telegraphs Hugh Davies commented {{on a number of}} political allusions made through Jones's characterisation as Prime Minister in [...] "The Christmas Invasion". He felt that her rebuttal of aid from the US president after aliens invade is a [...] "swipe at Blair and Bush over the invasion of Iraq". He also compared Jones's destruction of the fleeing Sycorax—a decision heavily criticised by the Doctor—to Margaret Thatcher's decision to sink the Argentine warship General Belgrano during the Falklands War. Russell T Davies responded to observations of political commentary by stating that there is [...] "absolutely an anti-war message" [...] present in the episode due to Christmas being [...] "a day of peace". In their unauthorised guide to Doctor Who, Graeme Burk and Robert Smith felt that Wilton delivered the [...] "standout performance" [...] of the Christmas special" [...] stating that, whilst the character remained recognisable, it was [...] "fascinating watching her harder edge emerge from the woman we know and love". Of Harriet Jones's development, Stuart Galbrainth of DVD Talk felt that she begins as a [...] "charming neophyte minister" [...] but becomes [...] "suddenly much less charming at the end of [...] "Christmas Invasion," [...] when she becomes just another politician". However, Cliff Chapman of Den of Geek felt that the episode's denouement was flawed by trying to [...] "make out that Harriet Jones is awful <b>for</b> <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> perfectly reasonable." [...] Similarly, io9's Chris Cummins commented that the character had [...] "noble intentions" [...] and that she was proved right upon her return in the fourth series.|$|E
