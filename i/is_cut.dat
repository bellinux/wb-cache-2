40|$|Abstract. The {{corrosion}} {{behaviors of}} {{304 stainless steel}} (304 SS) which has <b>been</b> <b>cut</b> and 304 SS which has not <b>been</b> <b>cut</b> in two different solutions were investigated using polarization curve and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) methods. The results show that 304 SS which has <b>been</b> <b>cut</b> and 304 SS which has not <b>been</b> <b>cut</b> have the similar corrosion voltage in two different solutions. However, the corrosion velocity of 304 SS which has <b>been</b> <b>cut</b> <b>is</b> more than 304 SS which has not <b>been</b> <b>cut</b> both in the two solutions and the corrosion behaviors of two 304 SS in the water solution are better than in the water which has little oil...|$|R

Under its northeast edge, Calabozos <b>is</b> <b>cut</b> by a north-south trending segment of sedimentary rock that includes gypsiferous and carbonates.|$|E

5|$|Fried chicken (also {{referred}} to as Southern fried chicken for the variant in the United States) is a dish consisting of chicken pieces usually from broiler chickens which have been floured or battered and then pan-fried, deep fried, or pressure fried. The breading adds a crisp coating or crust to the exterior. What separates fried chicken from other fried forms of chicken is that generally the chicken <b>is</b> <b>cut</b> at the joints, and the bones and skin are left intact. Crisp well-seasoned skin, rendered of excess fat, is a hallmark of well made fried chicken.|$|E

5|$|The {{spore print}} is white. The spores are elliptical, smooth, with {{dimensions}} of 8–11 by 5–7µm. They are amyloid, meaning they will absorb iodine when stained with Melzer's reagent.

Cystidia that are present on the stipe (caulocystidia) appear in clusters, and clublike to irregular in shape, measuring 20–55 by 3.5–12.5µm. The gill tissue contains numerous lactifers, cells that produce the latex that is secreted when it <b>is</b> <b>cut.</b>|$|E
