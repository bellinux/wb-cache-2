They consisted of two glass plies connected with an interlayer, for which two different polymers PVB and EVA SAFE were used. The analysis {{of the influence of}} polymer type on the behaviour of laminted glass was carried out separetly for elastic region, post-critical region and for the region of total failure of both glass plies. Also, a comparisson between experimental and numerical results is introduced. Numerical results were obtained with the analytical Newmark's model, Zenkert's effective moment of inertia method, WB and EET effective thickness methods and finite element method in SAP 2000, v 15. 0. 0. Ultimate. Furthermore, a study of interlayer type's influence on stresses and displacements was carried out. It is shown which types of glass constructions are more affected by the change of interlayer and which ones have the strongest composite behaviour. In addition, a comparisson of methods was made, in which stresses and displacements were tested throughout the construction surfaces...|$|R
40|$|Modern {{architecture}} requires {{transparent and}} slender structural elements for columns. Structural steel is a material {{that allows for}} slender columns. However, flexural buckling is usually the dominant failure mode of such columns. If flexural buckling can be suppressed, the full yield stress of the steel may be utilized. It would then make sense to use high-strength steel. In this work, a slender transparent glass-supported high-strength steel column was designed, tested and numerically analysed. It consisted of a 32 mm diameter Dywidag steel bar restrained against flexural buckling by four <b>heat-strengthened</b> float <b>glass</b> panes, thus providing sufficient redundancy, allowing for a glass pane to break without column failure. The glass panes were connected to the steel bar by vertically sliding steel sleeves avoiding normal stresses caused by axial column deformation occurring in the glass panes. The column was one storey high with slightly shorter glass panes, keeping them free from the roof and the floor. This paper focuses {{on the design of}} the glass-supported high-strength steel column by finite element analysis. Further, it briefly discusses the feasibility of the concept by experiments and it simulates these experiments again with finite element analysis...|$|R

The greenhouse was closed for extensive renovations in 1988 and reopened in March 1990. The original Plexiglas glazing was replaced with 2,425 panes of <b>heat-strengthened</b> <b>glass</b> (containing a plastic interlayer called Saflex) and coated with a low-emissivity film. In 2010, the Botanical Garden celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Climatron.|$|E
50|$|David Childs of Skidmore, Owings and Merrill {{worked in}} {{conjunction}} with glass artist and designer James Carpenter to create a design that uses ultra-clear, low-iron glass to provide reflectivity and light, with stainless-steel spandrels behind the glass to help reflect sunlight. Stainless steel used in the building façade is molybdenum-containing Type 316, which provides improved resistance to corrosion. To enclose the power substation and improve its aesthetics, {{the base of the}} building has a curtain wall with stainless steel louvers that provide ventilation for the machinery. During the day, the curtain wall reflects light, while at night it is illuminated with blue LED lights. The curtain wall around the lobby uses heavily laminated, <b>heat-strengthened</b> <b>glass</b> that meets high standards for blast resistance. At night, a large cube of light above the lobby also emanates blue light, while during the day it provides white light to the lobby, and at dusk it transitions to violet and back to blue. Inside the main lobby, artist Jenny Holzer created a large light installation with glowing text moving across wide plastic panels. The entire wall, which is 65 ft wide and 14 ft tall, changes color according to the time of day. Holzer worked with Klara Silverstein, the wife of Larry Silverstein, to select poetry for the art installation. The wall is structurally fortified as a security measure.|$|E
5000|$|Unique tower {{envelope}} made of cold-bent glass {{emphasizes the}} lightness and {{dynamic of the}} form visually denying the gravity force. Two hundred meters high sculpture, crafted of materials traditionally believed to be fragile and inflexible, symbolizes the idea of evolution spiral as the pinnacle of progress {{and the power of}} human intellect, challenging the forces of nature and the laws of physics. Original façade concept and innovative construction technology allow to create visually organic and flowing 3D form. Double curved tower envelope is provided by the cold bending of reflective glass units. The innovative cold-bent glazing in the curtain wall uses flat double glazed units cold-formed in 3D within the aluminum frame to avoid stepping in geometry. This approach appeared to be both more energy-efficient and more cost-efficient solution in comparison to the stepped curtain wall units previously applied in some twisted unitized facades. During factory fabrication the glass unit is placed in the twisted aluminum frame horizontally and then takes curved shape by its own weight without any thermal treatment. Maximum corner deformation does not exceed 50 mm relative to the opposite corner of the unit. Finally façade looks like continuously twisted spiral glass surface. Currently this curtain wall is the world’s largest cold bent façade in terms of the area in one building. Organic cold-bent glazed ribbon with constant leaning angle at the corners (approx. 14 degrees vertically) creates a stunning optical illusion reflecting the surrounding cityscape vertically with 90-degree twist.Evolution tower total façade area is 40,500 sq m, including 34,500 sq m of the typical facade areas from 3-rd to 51-st level. On each floor the curtain wall consists of 108 parallelogram façade panels 4.3 m high and 1.5m wide. 27 of them have 2 types of different sizes that vary with twist angle from +14 to -14 that largely complicated the construction logistics. However the implementation of this façade structure was successful due to involvement of German façade company Joseph Gartner (Permasteelisa Group) in design and production of tower curtain wall, atrium glazing and canopies /entrances. The company was selected through the tender with 30 façade manufacturers competing for a prestigious contract. The aluminum profiles were extruded in Russia at a specially arranged production line. Despite glass units fabrication in Germany with all associated delivery and customs duties the overall façade cost per m2 remained within the budget of a ‘standard’ benchmark high-rise tower, that was an achievement of German logistics. Double glazed units with energy-efficient multi-functional glass (manufactured by Guardian) provide the energy efficiency and thermal insulation parameters (U-Value) similar to those of standard triple glazed units but with less weight in panoramic floor to ceiling application. The units themselves were assembled in Germany by BGT, who provided long-time warranty for cold bent <b>heat-strengthened</b> <b>glass</b> in a result of multiple tests. Transparent double glazed units consist of triplex 8+6mm from <b>heat-strengthened</b> <b>glass</b> from the outside and 8mm Guardian Standard HP Neutral 60/40 tempered glass on the inside with application of energy efficient coating, significantly reducing the solar gain whilst providing the double glazed unit thermal performance equal to a standard triple glazed unit normally used in Moscow to withstand harsh winter conditions. Guardian SunGuard production technology allows to create almost perfect combination of transparent and spandrel façade areas. Guardian magnetron coating has a special feature - it is colored outside and transparent on the inside, which does not distort the view color unlike tinted glass in mass. With no color filter (color is from the coating, not from coloured glass) the high color quality provides comfortable environment inside the building given that the glass panel is 3m high (floor to ceiling) the perfect daylighting is provided in the office spaces. Glass unit formula with heat-strengthened triplex outside and tempered glass inside allows bending of the unit in installation position to achieve required façade geometry providing additional safety of envelope structure , as in case of destruction the tempered glass (5 times stronger than usual) is fractured in small pieces and triplex lamination film protects it from falling out. Heat strengthened glass triplex gains additional strength and reduces the risk of glass destruction via associated heat soak tests as part of the production process.|$|E

Its nature as brittle material, together with the inevitable presence of micro-cracks on its surface and the consequences of eventual failures, demand rigorous methods to achieve a safe design for glass elements, whose stress resistance is very much dependent on the integrity of its surface, element size and loading pattern. Thus, glass design must rely on probabilistic concepts and fracture mechanics criteria, substitutive of the conventional glass design based on charts derived from experimental programmes and subsequent application of the admissible stress concept.

Shear wall specimens measuring 1200 [*]×[*] 2400  mm 2 manufactured with three adhesives of varying stiffness were tested.

40|$|Glass panels {{which are}} widely used in curtain wall systems, behave nonlinearly under high wind load when their {{deflections}} exceed about 3 / 4 of their thickness. The American and the Canadian design codes for curtain wall and window systems have made it mandatory to include the effect of large deflection {{in the design and}} analysis of glass panels. This paper presents a versatile finite shell element method for nonlinear analysis of glass panels subjected to high wind loads. The accuracy of the proposed method is demonstrated via comparison with the results of previous studies and experiments. The advantage of the present method is its versatility in handling complex loading and boundary conditions whilst its longer computational time has been effectively offset by the adoption of the efficient incremental-iterative minimum residual displacement method of analysis and the availability of fast personal computers. Using the examples studied in this paper, {{it was found that the}} nonlinearity in glass may violate the linear assumption in the practical loading range, resulting in unexpected glass behaviour if the linear theory is used. More interestingly, the use of higher strength glass, the tempered or the <b>heat-strengthened</b> <b>glass,</b> will not increase the load resistance of the panel when it is under in-plane loads causing instability.

40|$|The {{conversation}} about the restoration materialization of historic buildings is an ongoing debate. Additions are allowed only {{if they do not}} detract from the interesting parts of the building, integrate harmoniously, yet are distinguishable to prevent architectural falsification of the monument. Completely transparent additions to historic buildings of structural glass can be an answer to all the above demands. As a research into these possibilities, a refurbishment proposal is made for the Ruin of Teylingen in the Netherlands. Here the original wood roof that is missing, is replaced by a structural glass roof. As a design research, the glass roof design has been elaborated in this graduation. The roof has the same shape and size of the original roof, and closes off the donjon, allowing a new function to be put in the castle. Laminated <b>heat-strengthened</b> <b>glass</b> beams are connected to a slender steel contour frame. To create a fluid curvature, laminated heat-treated cold bend glass panels are used, which are held in place by clamping joints, connected onto the glass beams. Passive climate measures are used to prevent overheating of the glass roof. A glass floor allows the roof {{to be used as a}} lookout point over the refurbished area around the castle. The design is checked by structural calculations. The product of the design process is an plausible and elegant solution for covering the historic building with an all glass roof that respects the historical and aesthetical value of the monument. This research has shown that if designed and detailing right, structural glass can be a very appropriate solution for the restoration of monumental buildings.

40|$|The post-breakage-integrity of BIPV module {{is the one}} of {{the most}} {{critical}} measurement for the approval of the use of BIPV module in buildings; especially for overhead-glazing application. Up to now, only laminated glass with PVBinterlayer is accepted as laminated safety glass in a regulated building product list. With respect to higher operating temperature and alternative interlayer materials used in PV laminated glass (BIPV-modules), therefore, the mechanical behaviours of PV laminated glass will be changed compared to conventional laminated glass. The aim of this paper is to examine post-breakage-integrity behaviour of eleven BIPV modules with different module configurations; glass types, operating temperatures, interlayer types of EVA and PVB, with- and without solar cells, interlayer thickness and glass thickness. For the test procedure, the PV module was damaged by striking with external mechanical load. The applied load and load duration are 500 N/m² over 24 hours by flexible sand bags. A 2 -side standard-conform line mounting was used. Due to different fracture behaviour of BIPV-laminated glass modules, two identical modules have been investigated in parallel. At room temperature, all specimens pass the test. Even PV module with glass-backsheet configuration is not allowed to be employed in overhead-glazing applications, it also passes the test. The glass configuration of <b>heat-strengthened</b> <b>glass</b> (TVG) has better behaviours compared to tempered safety glass (ESG), which is also in a good agreement with the regulation of DIN 18008. At high temperature, the trend of the results becomes negative compared to those at room temperature. There is no difference between EVA and PVB interlayers in PV modules without solar cell. The solar cells with certain interlayers could have a positive result. PV modules with thinner glass thickness could also pass the test, even though the stiffness of thinner laminated glasses is lower compared to that of thicker laminated glass...|$|E
40|$|The {{construction}} {{principles of}} "Timber-Glass-Composite-Girders" demand practical and theoretical research to ensure reliable designs. Toward this objective the mathematical description of load-bearing and the non-rigid bond {{is the subject}} of this work, i. e. to define the contributing parameters for the design of these girders. The non-rigid-bond of the adhesive joint is of great importance because of its influence on the load-bearing of the system as a whole. The loading of girders is dominated by permanent forces thus leading to the obligation of knowing the long-term behaviour of the system and its components. The definition of the characteristic values, taking into account the long-term load-bearing, is an intrinsic part of this investigation. It can be shown that the load-bearing of the girders depends on the fracture of the glass panes. The properties of glass-fractures are a function of the residual internal prestresses due to the heat-strengthening of the panes. The load-bearing, particularly the post-cracked behaviour, changes with respect to the intensity of these internal prestresses. The timber is able to reinforce the cracked glass, leading to a ductile load-bearing behaviour as in the girders, with a dependency upon the size of the remaining fractures. A model based on the differential equations of the non-rigid bond is defined in order to calculate the loading-peaks of the adhesive joint and the material loading itself. The characteristic values of the non-rigid bond, such as the number and distances between cracks and the load introducing length, were evaluated in tests on composite slabs and small scale girders. The existing calculation models which take into account non-rigid bonding were modified to adapt the influence of the width and thickness of the adhesive joint. In order to calculate the stressing of the material the existing calculation models were adapted to calculate the post-cracked situation. The load-bearing behaviour of glass-panes bent with respect to its strong neutral axis needs other safety-considerations than panes, bent off their plane. It is shown that the existing safety considerations subject to the use of glass can not easily be adapted onto the composite girders. The bending with respect to the strong neutral axis and the reinforcement of the glass of the timber demands a different hypothesis to adapt the fractural mechanical analysis and to establish a safe limit conception. This is part of the performed research of this document. The following descriptions present briefly the obtained results: Depending on the quality of the glass (residual stresses due to heat-strengthening, e. g. annealed glass, <b>heat-strengthened</b> <b>glass,</b> fully tempered glass), the ductility and the mode of failure of the girders does change. As a result of its failure mode, annealed glass without internal prestresses offers the highest remaining load-carrying potential after the first crack has appeared. This ductility and thus the structural safety, diminishes with an increasing degree of internal prestressing due to thermal treatment. <b>Heat-strengthened</b> <b>glass</b> (with various degrees of prestressing, various residual stresses) shows a decrease in remaining load-carrying capacity with an increasing degree of prestressing until it fails in a brittle mode as fully toughened glass does. This has to be well considered in respect to safety considerations. Girders with panes made of glass having internal residual stresses due to heat strengthening below 50 N/mm 2 are considered to collapse ductily, residual stresses bigger than 50 N/mm 2 cause brittle failure. The effective stiffness of the girders decreases under permanent loads in function of the bondage. Both, timber and adhesive take part in this decrease; the influence of both of the involved materials has been defined. Since the design of conventional glass constructions which uses the concept of principle stresses cannot be adapted, unidirectional shear stresses had to be determined for the shear strength of glass, which is defined as 25 N/mm 2 for annealed glass. The characteristic values of the adhesive to define the non-rigid bonds have been determined, likewise the influence of the width and thickness of the adhesive joint. The load introducing length, the distances between cracks and the number of cracks are defined with tests on composite slabs. A model to describe the theoretical bond with the defined parameters based on the differential equations was developed. This model allows the calculation of the material stressing at the load introduction and on both sides of a crack. To calculate the stressing of glass and timber existing calculation models which take into account non-rigid bonding were modified to adapt the influence of the width and thickness of the adhesive joint. In order to calculate the stressing of the material the existing calculation models were adapted to calculate the post-cracked situation. The safety factors for the influences of the glass surface, environmental conditions, load duration and the parameters of fracture mechanical analysis as developed as they are known for semi-probabilistic safety concepts for glass constructions cannot easily be adopted. The bending with respect to the strong neutral axis demands a different hypothesis in order to adapt the fractural mechanical analysis and to develop the safety parameters. For the reliable design of timber-glass-composite-girders a contribution to the appropriate use of probabilistic, semi-probabilistic and deterministic safety concepts are given. A realised construction (Hotel "Palafitte" in Monruz (NE)) shows an example and the experience made in designing girders...|$|E
