5|$|Bernard Siegel, an {{attorney}} from Florida, {{learned of the}} case and felt that a <b>hearing</b> <b>should</b> be held about Eve's welfare. In January 2003, he initiated legal proceedings, seeking to bring the clone's parents to court so its health could be verified. Raël and Boisselier attacked the filing as an attempt to take a child from loving parents and announced that, in protest, they would not provide DNA for testing. An arraignment occurred on January 24 and was televised live on CNN; Boisselier and Clonaid's vice president, Thomas Kaenzig, were subpoenaed in lieu of the child's parents. In courtroom testimony, the vice president of Clonaid said he knew very little about the clone, and that Boisselier controlled all the information. She did not attend the hearing, and Kaenzig provided little information, angering the judge, who threatened contempt of court charges. Boisselier attended a second hearing on January 29, telling the court that the child was in Israel. The judge then ruled that the court had no jurisdiction. In late January, the science editor announced that he suspected the cloning announcements were a hoax. Around that time, Boisselier held a press conference at which she announced that the cloned baby's parents had cut off contact with her and would never speak to the press.|$|E

With large tumors, the chance of hearing preservation is small with any approach. When hearing is already poor, the translabyrinthine approach may be used for even small tumors. Small, lateralized tumours in patients with good <b>hearing</b> <b>should</b> have the middle fossa approach. When the location of the tumour is more medial a retrosigmoid approach may be better.|$|E

The Department of Conservation, the Fish and Game Council, the Royal Forest and Bird Protection Society and Te Runanga o Ngai Tahu (TRONT) all submitted that the hearing panel should close the hearing and decline all the consents applied for by CPW as these had been presented as an integrated proposal where water storage was fundamental. The Malvern Hills Protection Society recommended declining all applications, noting that CPW had obtained requiring authority status {{on the basis that}} the dam and reservoir were essential (para 14). The Society also noted that any water-take consents granted were likely to be ultimately transferred to Dairy Holdings Limited under existing loan agreements (para 29).|$|E
25|$|Every {{person has}} the right to have a hearing and be allowed to present his or her own case. Should a person not attend the hearing, even with {{adequate}} notice given, the adjudicator has the discretion to decide if the <b>hearing</b> <b>should</b> proceed. In Ridge v. Baldwin, a chief constable succeeded in having his dismissal from service declared void as he had not been given the opportunity to make a defence. In another case, Chief Constable of the North Wales Police v. Evans (1982), a chief constable required a police probationer to resign on account of allegations about his private life which he was given no fair opportunity to rebut. The House of Lords found the dismissal to be unlawful. Likewise in Surinder Singh Kanda v. Government of the Federation of Malaya (1962), a public servant facing disciplinary proceedings was not supplied with a copy of a prejudicial report by a board of inquiry which the adjudicating officer had access to before the hearing. The Privy Council held that the proceedings had failed to provide him a reasonable opportunity of being heard.|$|E

[...] On 22 May 2008, magistrates in Haverfordwest magistrates court rejected Oakwood Leisure Limited's request for an adjournment and directed that the <b>hearing</b> <b>should</b> proceed on the assumption of a not guilty plea. [...] The magistrates declined jurisdiction and adjourned the case which was committed for crown court trial in Swansea Crown Court on 7 July 2008. The magistrates' court was limited to fining the company £20,000, the crown court can impose an unlimited fine. On 8 July 2008, Oakwood plead guilty under the Health and Safety Act 1974 for failing to conduct its business such to ensure that its guests were not exposed to risks. In December 2008 the company was fined £250,000 plus £80,000 in costs.|$|E

[...] Accordingly the Judges delivered their opinion, and each argued it (though they were all agreed) seriatim and in open court. Another abstract point of law was also proposed from the bar, on the same trial, concerning the legal sentence in high treason; {{and in the same}} manner the Judges on reference delivered their opinion in open court; and no objection, was taken to it as anything new or irregular.[19] ...|$|E

60|$|Professor Murray will, I am sure, {{excuse me}} if I {{say that he}} has the common fault of most Englishmen of being inaudible. Why on earth people who have {{something}} to say which is worth <b>hearing</b> <b>should</b> not take the slight trouble to learn how to make it heard is one of the strange mysteries of modern life. Their methods are as reasonable as to try to pour some precious stuff from the spring to the reservoir through a non-conducting pipe, which could by the least effort be opened. Professor Murray made several profound remarks to his white tie and to the water-carafe upon the table, with a humorous, twinkling aside to the silver candlestick upon his right. Then he sat down, and Mr. Waldron, the famous popular lecturer, rose amid a general murmur of applause. He was a stern, gaunt man, with a harsh voice, and an aggressive manner, but he had the merit of knowing how to assimilate the ideas of other men, and to pass them on in a way which was intelligible and even interesting to the lay public, with a happy knack of being funny about the most unlikely objects, so that the precession of the Equinox or the formation of a vertebrate became a highly humorous process as treated by him.|$|E
6000|$|From {{the ninth}} month onward the child begins serious {{attempts}} to talk. In order {{that it may}} learn to do this as easily as possible, it requires {{to be surrounded by}} people speaking one language, and speaking it with a uniform accent. Those who are most in the child's <b>hearing</b> <b>should</b> endeavour to speak--even when they are not addressing the child --deliberately and clearly. All authorities are agreed upon the mischievous effect of what is called [...] "baby talk," [...] the use of an extensive sham vocabulary, a sort of deciduous milk vocabulary that will presently have to be shed again. Froebel and Preyer join hands on this. The child's funny little perversions of speech are really genuine attempts to say the right word, and we simply cause trouble and hamper development if we give back to the seeking mind its own blunders again. When a child wants to indicate milk, it wants to say milk, and not [...] "mooka" [...] or [...] "mik," [...] and when it wants to indicate bed, the needed word is not [...] "bedder" [...] or [...] "bye-bye," [...] but [...] "bed." [...] But we give the little thing no chance to get on in this way until suddenly one day we discover it is [...] "time the child spoke plainly." [...] Preyer has pointed out very instructively {{the way in which the}} quite sufficiently difficult matter of the use of I, mine, me, my, you, yours, and your is made still more difficult by those about the child adopting irregularly the experimental idioms it produces. When a child says to its mother, [...] "Me go mome," [...] it is doing its best to speak English, and its remark should be received without worrying comment; but when a mother says to her child, [...] "Me go mome," [...] she is simply wasting an opportunity of teaching her child its mother-tongue. One sympathizes with her all too readily, one understands the sweetness to her of these soft, infantile mispronunciations; but, indeed, she ought to understand; it is her primary business to know better than her feelings in this affair.|$|E

40|$|Suppose you {{witnessed}} {{the killing of}} Harry by Frank and wish to report on that. To express this unfortunate event, you may consider using a sentence such as Frank killed Harry, or A man killed Harry, or He killed Harry, and perhaps even briefly consider the reverse word order Harry killed Frank. When choosing the form to be used, however, {{it is important that}} a hearer will understand the chosen form correctly. This means that the <b>hearer</b> <b>should</b> be able to identify the intended referents {{on the basis of the}} referring expressions used. If a pronoun is used, it should be clear to the hearer to whom this pronoun refers. In addition, the <b>hearer</b> <b>should</b> be able to distinguish between an interpretation according to which Frank is the killer and Harry the victim and an interpretation such that Harry is the killer and Frank the victim. In English, this distinction is made with the help of word order. That is, for an English hearer, the sentence Frank killed Harry can only mean that Frank is the agent and Harry the patient in the killing event, as Frank is mentioned first. If the speaker had wanted to express the meaning that Harry killed Frank, the speaker would have mentioned Harry first and thus would have said Harry killed Frank.
