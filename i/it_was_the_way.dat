25|$|To {{improve the}} {{calculation}} time, the Norden used a mechanical computer inside the bombsight {{to calculate the}} range angle of the bombs. By simply dialing in the aircraft's altitude and heading, along with estimates of the wind speed and direction (in relation to the aircraft), the computer would automatically, and quickly, calculate the aim point. This not only reduced the time needed for the bombsight setup but also dramatically reduced the chance for errors. This attack on the accuracy problem {{was by no means}} unique; several other bombsights of the era used similar calculators. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> the Norden used these calculations that differed.|$|E

In addition, Mascis was also a fan of many punk and hardcore bands such as The Birthday Party, and has frequently noted Nick Cave as an influence. Dinosaur Jr.'s members also combined elements of hardcore punk and noise rock in their songs, which often featured {{a large amount of}} feedback, distortion and extreme volume. When the master tape of You're Living All Over Me arrived at SST, the label's production manager noticed the level on the tape was so high it was distorting; however, Mascis confirmed <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> he wanted the album to sound. To accentuate their use of volume, the band employed and popularised the quiet–loud change of dynamic in many of its songs, a technique that would be later popularised by Pixies, Nirvana and alternative rock in general during the 1990s.|$|E

25|$|Weininger (1880–1903), who {{was also}} Jewish, argued that the {{concepts}} male and female exist only as Platonic forms, and that Jews tend to embody the platonic femininity. Whereas men are basically rational, women operate only {{at the level of}} their emotions and sexual organs. Jews, Weininger argued, are similar, saturated with femininity, with no sense of right and wrong, and no soul. Weininger argues that man must choose between his masculine and feminine sides, consciousness and unconsciousness, Platonic love and sexuality. Love and sexual desire stand in contradiction, and love between a woman and a man is therefore doomed to misery or immorality. The only life worth living is the spiritual one—to live as a woman or a Jew means one has no right to live at all; the choice is genius or death. Weininger committed suicide, shooting himself in 1903, shortly after publishing the book. Many years later, as a professor at Cambridge, Wittgenstein distributed copies of Weininger's book to his bemused academic colleagues. He said that Weininger's arguments were wrong, but that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> they were wrong that was interesting.|$|E

500|$|Given the {{strongly}} entrenched opposition the Greek Army faced, [...] historian Richard Hall {{cites the}} Battle of Bizani {{and the fall}} of Ioannina as Greece's greatest military achievement in the First Balkan War.

500|$|By {{the time}} [...] "Damien" [...] was animated, {{much of the}} drawing and {{animation}} responsibilities {{that had previously been}} handled by Parker and Stone were now being delegated to a team of animators.

While animating Jesus, Parker and Stone deliberately left glitches in the animation that made it appear skin was showing beneath the beard on the left-hand side of the character's face. Parker said this was done because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> Jesus appeared in the crudely animated The Spirit of Christmas, a 1995 animated short film by Parker and Stone that served as a precursor to South Park, and they wanted to maintain that nuance for the character.|$|E

Rather it is God's basic design and plan for mankind, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> most of mankind lived most of the time, until the 20th century." [...] Charles D. Provan additionally argues:"Be fruitful and multiply" ... is a command of God, indeed the first command to a married couple. Birth control obviously involves disobedience to this command, for birth control attempts to prevent being fruitful and multiplying. Therefore birth control is wrong, because it involves disobedience to the Word of God. Nowhere is this command done away with in the entire Bible; therefore it still remains valid for us today.|$|E
