5|$|Curie's {{systematic}} studies {{included two}} uranium minerals, pitchblende and torbernite (also known as chalcolite). Her <b>electrometer</b> showed that pitchblende was {{four times as}} active as uranium itself, and chalcolite twice as active. She concluded that, if her earlier results relating the quantity of uranium to its activity were correct, then these two minerals must contain small quantities of another substance that was far more active than uranium. She began a systematic search for additional substances that emit radiation, and by 1898 she discovered that the element thorium was also radioactive. Pierre was increasingly intrigued by her work. By mid-1898 he was so invested in it {{that he decided to}} drop his work on crystals and to join her.|$|E
25|$|Thomson {{constructed}} a Crookes tube with an <b>electrometer</b> set to one side, {{out of the}} direct path of the cathode rays. Thomson could trace {{the path of the}} ray by observing the phosphorescent patch it created where it hit the surface of the tube. Thomson observed that the <b>electrometer</b> registered a charge only when he deflected the cathode ray to it with a magnet. He concluded that the negative charge and the rays were one and the same.|$|E
50|$|Also {{known as}} Attracted Disk <b>Electrometers,</b> {{attraction}} <b>electrometers</b> are sensitive balances measuring the attraction between charged disks. William Snow Harris {{is credited with}} the invention of this instrument, which was further improved by Lord Kelvin.|$|R
50|$|Other {{instruments}} included nondispersive infrared {{gas analyzers}} <b>electrometers</b> {{such as the}} Cary Model 31 and 36 <b>Electrometers</b> which used a vibrating reed with an ionization chamber and calorimeters such as the Cary Model 41 Calorimeter.|$|R
25|$|Among other applications, <b>electrometers</b> {{are used}} in nuclear physics {{experiments}} as {{they are able to}} measure the tiny charges left in matter by the passage of ionizing radiation. The most common use for modern <b>electrometers</b> is the measurement of radiation with ionization chambers, in instruments such as geiger counters.|$|R
25|$|Thomson {{did more}} than any other {{electrician}} up to his time in introducing accurate methods and apparatus for measuring electricity. As early as 1845 he pointed out that the experimental results of William Snow Harris were in accordance with the laws of Coulomb. In the Memoirs of the Roman Academy of Sciences for 1857 he published a description of his new divided ring <b>electrometer,</b> based on the old electroscope of Johann Gottlieb Friedrich von Bohnenberger and he introduced a chain or series of effective instruments, including the quadrant <b>electrometer,</b> which cover the entire field of electrostatic measurement. He invented the current balance, also known as the Kelvin balance or Ampere balance (SiC), for the precise specification of the ampere, the standard unit of electric current. From around 1880 he was aided by the electrical engineer Magnus Maclean FRSE in his electrical experiments.|$|E
25|$|For {{convenience}} of use, the vibrating reed assembly is often attached by a cable {{to the rest}} of the <b>electrometer.</b> This allows for a relatively small unit to be located near the charge to be measured while the much larger reed-driver and amplifier unit can be located wherever it is convenient for the operator.|$|E
25|$|A more {{sensitive}} form of quadrant <b>electrometer</b> {{was developed by}} Frederick Lindemann. It employs a metal-coated quartz fiber instead of an aluminum sector. The deflection is measured by observing {{the movement of the}} fiber under a microscope. Initially used for measuring star light, it was employed for the infrared detection of airplanes {{in the early stages of}} World War II.|$|E

50|$|Abraham Brook (fl. 1789) was an English {{bookseller}} in Norwich, now {{remembered as}} an experimental physicist, working with <b>electrometers</b> and vacuum flasks.|$|R
50|$|Keithley Instruments's major {{product lines}} include Test & Measurement {{products}} such as <b>electrometers,</b> voltmeters, signal generators, data acquisition, and production and benchtop parameteric testers and analyzers.|$|R
25|$|A modern <b>electrometer</b> is {{a highly}} {{sensitive}} electronic voltmeter whose input impedance is so high that the current flowing into it can be considered, for most practical purposes, to be zero. The actual value of input resistance for modern electronic electrometers is around 1014Ω, compared to around 1010Ω for nanovoltmeters. Owing to the extremely high input impedance, special design considerations must be applied to avoid leakage current such as driven shields and special insulation materials.|$|E
25|$|Berger's first {{recording}} device was very rudimentary. He inserted silver wires under the scalps of his patients. These were later replaced by silver foils {{attached to the}} patient's head by rubber bandages. Berger connected these sensors to a Lippmann capillary <b>electrometer,</b> with disappointing results. However, more sophisticated measuring devices, such as the Siemens double-coil recording galvanometer, which displayed electric voltages as small as one ten thousandth of a volt, led to success.|$|E
25|$|Valve electrometers use a {{specialized}} vacuum tube (thermionic valve) {{with a very}} high gain (transconductance) and input resistance. The input current is allowed to flow into the high impedance grid, and the voltage so generated is vastly amplified in the anode (plate) circuit. Valves designed for <b>electrometer</b> use have leakage currents as low as a few femtoamperes (10−15 amperes). Such valves must be handled with gloved hands as the salts left on the glass envelope can provide leakage paths for these tiny currents.|$|E
40|$|Charge is {{observed}} in clouds of all forms, which influences their development and properties. In-cloud charge measurements require a {{wide dynamic range}} instrument, extending from charge in aerosols and dusts to that present in thunderstorms. Unexpectedly large charge densities (> 200 pCm- 3) have recently been detected in layer clouds using balloon-carried linear <b>electrometers.</b> These, however, lead to instrument saturation if sufficient sensitivity for aerosol and droplet charge is maintained. Logarithmic <b>electrometers</b> provide an alternative, but suffer strong non-linear thermal effects. This is a limitation for balloon-carried instruments which encounter temperature changes up to ~ 100 °C, as full thermal compensation requires complexity inappropriate for disposable devices. Here, a novel hybrid system is described, combining linear and logarithmic <b>electrometers</b> to provide extended dynamic range (± 50 pA), employing the negligible (± 4 %) total temperature drift of the linear device to provide in situ calibration of the logarithmic device. This combination opens up new measurement opportunities for charge in clouds, dusts and aerosols...|$|R
25|$|Some {{mechanic}} <b>electrometers</b> were housed {{inside a}} cage {{often referred to}} as a “bird cage”. This is a form of Faraday Cage that protected the instrument from external electrostatic charges.|$|R
25|$|The {{most modern}} <b>electrometers</b> {{consist of a}} solid state {{amplifier}} using one or more field-effect transistors, connections for external measurement devices, and usually a display and/or data-logging connections. The amplifier amplifies small currents {{so that they are}} more easily measured. The external connections are usually of a co-axial or tri-axial design, and allow attachment of diodes or ionization chambers for ionising radiation measurement. The display or data-logging connections allow the user to see the data or record it for later analysis. <b>Electrometers</b> designed for use with ionization chambers may include a high-voltage power supply, which is used to bias the ionization chamber.|$|R
25|$|Vibrating reed electrometers use a {{variable}} capacitor formed between a moving electrode (in {{the form of}} a vibrating reed) and a fixed input electrode. As the distance between the two electrodes varies, the capacitance also varies and electric charge is forced {{in and out of the}} capacitor. The alternating current signal produced by the flow of this charge is amplified and used as an analogue for the DC voltage applied to the capacitor. The DC input resistance of the <b>electrometer</b> is determined solely by the leakage resistance of the capacitor, and is typically extremely high, (although its AC input impedance is lower).|$|E
25|$|The {{action and}} {{efficiency}} of influence machines were further investigated by F. Rossetti, A. Righi, and Friedrich Kohlrausch. E. E. N. Mascart, A. Roiti, and E. Bouchotte also examined the efficiency and current producing power of influence machines. In 1871, sectorless machines were investigated by Musaeus. In 1872, Righi's <b>electrometer</b> was developed {{and was one of}} the first antecedents of the Van de Graaff generator. In 1873, Leyser developed the Leyser machine, a variation of the Holtz machine. In 1880, Robert Voss (a Berlin instrument maker) devised a form of machine in which he claimed that the principles of Toepler and Holtz were combined. The same structure become also known as the Toepler-Holtz machine.|$|E
25|$|Developed by Lord Kelvin, this is {{the most}} {{sensitive}} and accurate of all the mechanical electrometers. The original design uses a light aluminum sector suspended inside a drum cut into four segments. The segments are insulated and connected diagonally in pairs. The charged aluminum sector is attracted to one pair of segments and repelled from the other. The deflection is observed by a beam of light reflected from a small mirror attached to the sector, just as in a galvanometer. The engraving on the right shows a slightly different form of this <b>electrometer,</b> using four flat plates rather than closed segments. The plates can be connected externally in the conventional diagonal way (as shown), or in a different order for specific applications.|$|E
50|$|This {{instrument}} was also {{essential for the}} graduate diploma work and discovery of light and heavy fractions of myosine (muscle cell proteins) of Cywinski’s wife, Hanna Zawistowska, a biochemist herself. Cywinski worked as a full-time engineer in the Laboratory of Applied Physics at the Warsaw Pol where he constructed vacuum-tube <b>electrometers.</b> It was thanks {{to the use of}} Cywinski’s <b>electrometers</b> that the first European semiconductor-charge copying machine was developed. Later, in 1959 he worked at the Laboratory of Computer Science of the Warsaw University of Technology where he built vacuum-tube registers for the first Polish-made computer.|$|R

500|$|She used an {{innovative}} technique to investigate samples. [...] Fifteen years earlier, {{her husband and}} his brother had developed {{a version of the}} <b>electrometer,</b> a sensitive device for measuring electric charge. Using Pierre's <b>electrometer,</b> she discovered that uranium rays caused the air around a sample to conduct electricity. Using this technique, her first result was the finding that the activity of the uranium compounds depended only on the quantity of uranium present. She hypothesized that the radiation was not the outcome of some interaction of molecules but must come from the atom itself. This hypothesis was an important step in disproving the ancient assumption that atoms were indivisible.|$|E
2500|$|Electricity {{readings}} may {{be recorded}} continuously with a device {{known as an}} electrograph. [...] Francis Ronalds created an early electrograph around 1814 in which the changing electricity made a pattern in a rotating resin-coated plate. [...] It was employed at Kew Observatory and the Royal Observatory, Greenwich in the 1840s to create records of variations in atmospheric electricity. In 1845, Ronalds invented photographic means of registering the atmospheric electricity. [...] The photosensitive surface was pulled slowly past of the aperture diaphragm of the camera box, which also housed an <b>electrometer,</b> and captured ongoing movements of the <b>electrometer</b> indices as a trace. [...] Kelvin used similar photographic means for his quadrant <b>electrometer</b> (see above) in the 1860s.|$|E

50|$|A {{differential}} mobility analyzer (DMA) is {{device that}} separates charged aerosol particles or ions {{according to their}} mobility in an electric field prior to their detection, which {{can be done with}} several means, including <b>electrometers</b> or the more sophisticated mass spectrometers.|$|R

2500|$|Francis Ronalds {{delineated}} “intensity” (voltage) and “quantity” (current) for the dry pile – a {{high voltage}} source – in 1814 using a gold-leaf <b>electrometer.</b> [...] He found for a dry pile {{that the relationship}} between the two parameters was not proportional under certain meteorological conditions.|$|E
2500|$|An initial {{breakthrough}} {{came when}} Willem Einthoven, working in Leiden, the Netherlands, used the string galvanometer (the first practical electrocardiograph) he invented in 1901. This device {{was much more}} sensitive than both the capillary <b>electrometer</b> Waller used and the string galvanometer that had been invented separately in 1897 by the French engineer Clément Ader. Einthoven had previously, in 1895, assigned the letters P, Q, R, S, and T to the deflections in the theoretical waveform he created using equations which corrected the actual waveform obtained by the capillary <b>electrometer</b> {{to compensate for the}} imprecision of that instrument. Using letters different from A, B, C, and D (the letters used for the capillary electrometer's waveform) facilitated comparison when the uncorrected and corrected lines were drawn on the same graph. Einthoven probably chose the initial letter P to follow the example set by Descartes in geometry. When a more [...] precise waveform was obtained using the string galvanometer, which matched the corrected capillary <b>electrometer</b> waveform, he continued to use the letters P, Q, R, S, and T, and these letters are still in use today. Einthoven also described the electrocardiographic features of a number of cardiovascular disorders. In 1924, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine for his discovery.|$|E
2500|$|In 1748, Nollet invented one of {{the first}} electrometers, the electroscope, which showed {{electric}} charge using electrostatic attraction and repulsion. Nollet is reputed {{to be the first to}} apply the name [...] "Leyden jar" [...] to the first device for storing electricity. Nollet's invention was replaced by Horace-Bénédict de Saussure's <b>electrometer</b> in 1766.|$|E
2500|$|Solid-state <b>electrometers</b> {{are often}} {{multipurpose}} devices that can measure voltage, charge, resistance and current. They measure voltage {{by means of}} [...] "voltage balancing", in which the input voltage is compared with an internal reference voltage source using an electronic circuit with a very high input impedance (of the order of 1014 ohms). A similar circuit modified {{to act as a}} current-to-voltage converter enables the instrument to measure currents as small as a few femtoamperes. [...] Combined with an internal voltage source, the current measuring mode can be adapted to measure very high resistances, of the order of 1017 ohms. Finally, by calculation from the known capacitance of the <b>electrometer's</b> input terminal, the instrument can measure very small electric charges, down to a small fraction of a picocoulomb.|$|R
