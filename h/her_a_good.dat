25|$|Her {{association}} with Handel can be dated to 1714, {{when he wrote}} the solo soprano role in the Ode for the Birthday of Queen Anne for her. She joined his company early that year, making her debut in Creso, a pasticcio. As the year went on she sang in revivals of Arminio and Ernelinda (both pasticcios, possibly with music by Nicola Haym); on several occasions new music was written for her. London audiences clearly gave <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> reception, and her career continued to prosper; she {{played the role of}} Almirena in a 1715 revival of Rinaldo, and originated the role of Oriana in Handel's Amadigi. In a 1717 revival of this opera Handel created a new scene for her and Nicolini, the brilliant castrato who had earlier originated the title role in Rinaldo.|$|E

It was [...] "the first English edition to make comprehensive critical and historical claims" [...] and was in every respect [...] "a canon-making enterprise." [...] In her insightful essay, Barbauld legitimises the novel, then still a controversial genre, by connecting it to ancient Persian and Greek literature. For <b>her,</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> novel is [...] "an epic in prose, with more of character and less (indeed in modern novels nothing) of the supernatural machinery." [...] Barbauld maintains that novel-reading has a multiplicity of benefits; not only is it a [...] "domestic pleasure", but it is also a way to [...] "infus principles and moral feelings" [...] into the population. Barbauld also provided introductions to each of the fifty authors included in the series.|$|E

Hamilton met Adams in New York, and cast her because [...] "she was elegant and beautiful {{that it seemed to}} me she was the perfect Bond girl". When Ekland read the news that Adams had been cast for The Man with the Golden Gun, she became upset, thinking Adams had been selected to play Goodnight. Broccoli then called Ekland to invite her for the main role, as after seeing her in a film, Broccoli thought Ekland's [...] "generous looks" [...] made <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> contrast to Adams. Hamilton decided to put Marc Lawrence, whom he had worked with on Diamonds Are Forever, to play a gangster shot dead by Scaramanga {{at the start of the}} film, because he found it an interesting idea to [...] "put sort of a Chicago gangster in the middle of Thailand".|$|E

Following her dance teacher's recommendation, she was invited to appear in the music video of Renoo Nathan's [...] "Thirakti Kyun Hawa". Shot in Banaras, the video was seen by Ramoji Films who offered her the lead role of Neha in their film Ishtam. Saran accepted the part and, even before it was released she was signed to four more films, including Nuvve Nuvve, in which she played a millionaire's daughter who falls for a middle-class man. In 2002, she starred in Santosham, co-starring Nagarjuna, Prabhu Deva and Gracy Singh, which was her first commercial success. The film took the Nandi Award for Best Feature Film and Filmfare Best Film Award (Telugu). Saran played a woman who lets someone she loves go with another, but wins him back later in life. For her performance, she earned a nomination for the CineMAA Award for Best Actor- Female, giving <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> foothold in the Telugu industry in the early part of her career.|$|E
500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from November 19, 1910. It states: [...] "Paul and Virginia are two young lovers who have grown up together from babyhood. Their widowed mothers lived near each other in rude cottages, on {{an island in the}} Indies, on which there are few inhabitants. Here the children are reared, knowing no play fellows but each other. When Virginia is 16 years of age, her mother receives a letter from a wealthy aunt in Paris, who offers to make Virginia her heir and give <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> education, providing Virginia will, in the future, make her aunt's home her own. Virginia's mother, having lost her own fortune through marrying against the will of her family, feels that she must not let her daughter suffer the poverty that she has been compelled to endure. She accordingly insists upon Virginia's acceptance of her wealthy relatives offer. Virginia thereupon sets sail for France, leaving Paul broken-hearted at her departure. Virginia tries to be a dutiful niece to her aunt, who is very old and sickly, although she longs to return to her humble home and Paul, whom she dearly loves. When, however, the aunt insists that she marry a rich nobleman, Virginia refuses; her aunt disowns the girl and sends her back to the island home. Virginia's ship arrives at the Indies during a hurricane, and although a cable's length from shore, it sinks before help can reach it, and Virginia is drowned. Paul witnesses her death from the shore, and almost loses his own life in a vain attempt to save her." ...|$|E

500|$|Much of Kim Possibles cast {{consists}} of Disney Channel and ABC alumnae, {{as well as}} actors known for their roles on other popular animated and comedy series. The lead role of Kim was originally offered to Anneliese van der Pol, who declined in favor of appearing as Chelsea Daniels on the Disney Channel teen sitcom That's So Raven. After auditioning several actresses to voice the title character, then-16 year-old Christy Carlson Romano was finally cast as Kim after first being introduced to Schooley and McCorkle by Disney Channel executives. Romano had already been well known to Disney Channel audiences for her portrayal of Ren Stevens on the series Even Stevens, and began voicing Kim while completing her stint on the show. Her first voice acting role, Romano immediately identified with her character because both were [...] "dealing with teenage issues" [...] at the same time, comparing Kim's challenge of battling both her personal life and villains to herself balancing schoolwork with her budding acting career; the actress was forced to forfeit her own senior prom due to Kim Possible commitments. Describing her character as [...] "very ambitious, very skilled, very smart," [...] Romano told The New York Times [...] "I've tried to make <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> role model. Her confidence and her sincerity really shine through." [...] One episode in particular, [...] "Blush", was inspired by Romano's modesty and tendency to blush at the slightest compliment. Romano's performance as Kim was nominated for an Emmy Award. Recognized {{for his ability to}} play [...] "over-the-top characters", Will Friedle, best remembered for his performance as Eric Matthews on the sitcom Boy Meets World, was cast as Ron. Actor Neil Patrick Harris had auditioned for the role, as did actor John Cena before he decided to pursue a professional wrestling career. Schooley attributes much of the show's success to Romano and Friedle's chemistry, explaining, [...] "they add something to this that makes it more than a typical gag-oriented cartoon." ...|$|E

2500|$|Despite her {{religious}} upbringing, Ruiz describes {{herself at the}} time as a skeptic and a [...] "Sunday morning Catholic". [...] A successful, sophisticated woman, Ruiz was embarrassed by Reyes' religiosity and was jealous of his affection for the dark-skinned Virgin. [...] While her husband was gone, Ruiz almost took down the icon of the Virgin of Guadalupe (painted by Reyes) that hung in their home. [...] She decided to leave it up, however, and the next day as she walked past the painting, she heard it wish <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> morning. [...] She dismissed the greeting as a figment of her imagination or a signal of mental instability. [...] The next week, the painting greeted her again, and Ruiz felt a sensation that the voice was coming from the Virgin Mary. [...] Following the two auditory experiences, Ruiz began waking up early with a strong desire to attend six o'clock mass. [...] By the time Reyes returned, he found his wife much more open to his spirituality, and when he asked for her help to spiritually revitalize the family, she agreed.|$|E

It is this quality which both impresses and irritates Broyles, as it makes <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> agent but also makes her prone to biting off more than she can chew when it comes to pursuing suspects. Olivia had an abusive stepfather, and shot him several times in defense of her mother and herself. She was unable to finish him off, and so he recovered and disappeared, leaving her to blame herself for not exacting retribution against him, contributing to her determination to bring criminals to justice. She was nine years old when she shot her stepfather, and she states in an earlier episode that she knew {{what she wanted to do}} for a career [...] "pretty much since [...] was nine", indicating a direct link between the childhood abuse and her job.|$|E
