5000|$|Heinrich Dreyer founded Amazone in 1883, {{though the}} Dreyer {{family had been}} {{involved}} in the manufacture of agricultural machines earlier. The first machines brought to production were <b>grain</b> <b>cleaning</b> <b>machines,</b> later plow cultivators, potato sorters and in 1915 the first fertilizer spreader was put on the market. Early on Dreyer began exporting of his machinery; in 1906 the first <b>grain</b> <b>cleaning</b> <b>machines</b> were sold in Valparaíso, Chile. He substantiated this with his slogan: [...] "We must go out to the world". In 1942, the first potato harvesters were introduced to the market and in 1949 the seed drill machines and 1959, a manure spreader. In the 1960s, the two-disc ZA fertilizer spreaders and D4 seed drills were very successful, which helped Amazone to reach market leadership at this time. In 1967 the company entered into tillage and there developed the first Amazone manufactured PTO driven tillage equipment that could be used with a drill. The harrow and rotary cultivator were also included into the product range. Later, after the German reunification, a variety of passive soil-working machines were added to the market.|$|R

5000|$|A sand <b>cleaning</b> <b>machine,</b> beach cleaner, or (colloquially) sandboni is {{a vehicle}} that drags a raking or sifting device over beach sand to remove rubbish and other foreign matter. They are {{manually}} self-pulled vehicles on tracks or wheels or pulled by quad-bike or tractor. Seaside cities use beach <b>cleaning</b> <b>machines</b> to combat the problems of litter left by beach patrons and other pollution washed up on their shores. A chief task in beach cleaning strategies is finding {{the best way to}} handle waste matter on the beaches, taking into consideration beach erosion and changing terrain. Beach <b>cleaning</b> <b>machines</b> work by collecting sand by way of a scoop or drag mechanism and then raking or sifting anything large enough to be considered foreign matter, including sticks, stones, litter and other items. Similar applications include lake beaches, sandfields for beach volleyball and kindergarten and playing field sandpits. The word [...] "sandboni" [...] is a back-formation referencing the ice-surfacing machine Zamboni.|$|R
