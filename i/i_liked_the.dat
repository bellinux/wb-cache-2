5|$|There {{were other}} folk-music records, {{commercial}} folk-music records, like those by the Kingston Trio. I never really was an elitist. Personally, <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> Kingston Trio. I {{could see the}} picture...the Kingston Trio were probably the best commercial group going, {{and they seemed to}} know what they were doing.|$|E
5|$|I {{liked them}} both {{because they were}} ironic and provocative {{at the same time}} but also unlike me. I am not a materialistic person, and I {{certainly}} wasn't a virgin, and, by the way, how can you be like a virgin? <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> play on words; I thought they were clever. They're so geeky, they're cool. I never realized they would become my signature songs, especially the second one.|$|E
5|$|As I {{was reading}} about Cope and Marsh, I ran across Knight as {{something}} of a bit player in their lives. As I got further into the Cope and Marsh story, and <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> two less and less as people—which is different from liking them as characters, of course—I wanted to have a character in the book for the readers to root for, and neither of the scientists could fill that role. When I found out that Knight had met Cope just before Cope died, I became convinced that he was the character I needed.|$|E

'Yes,' said Dick, deliberately, 'I <b>like</b> <b>the</b> power; <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> fun; <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> fuss; {{and above}} all <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> money. <b>I</b> almost <b>like</b> <b>the</b> people who make the fuss and pay the money.

500|$|Ebert and Roeper {{gave the}} film a [...] "two thumbs up" [...] rating, with Roger Ebert saying, [...] "I liked the action, <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> absurdity, <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> incongruous use and misuse of mutant powers, and I {{especially}} {{liked the way}} it introduces all of those political issues and lets them fight {{it out with the}} special effects." [...] Stephanie Zacharek of Salon.com gave it a mixed review, noting that it was [...] "only half a mess", and that Ratner [...] "could have stuck a bit more closely to the 'Dark Phoenix' narrative than he did." [...] However, Zacharek did note that that third act captured some of the original story's [...] "majesty".|$|E
500|$|The movie {{would remain}} the most financially {{successful}} {{of all the}} AIP Poe films. [...] "It's also the one <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> best {{because it was the}} scariest," [...] said Arkoff. [...] "We had a wonderful piece of artwork for the poster... as well as some great sets by Danny Haller." ...|$|E
500|$|Gibbard {{credited}} Nick Harmer's bass {{line with}} being {{integral to the}} song, noting inspiration from bassists Eric Avery and Simon Gallup. [...] Harmer said of the bass line, [...] "I immediately gravitated to the creepy, stalker-ish theme that Ben created with the lyrics and the piano chords.... <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> idea that once a stalker gets obsessed with an idea, it just keeps repeating in his head, so I wanted the bass line to have a repetitive, incessant theme." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Very much. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> {{open country}} and the fresh air. Then <b>I</b> think <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> people, and one has {{so much to do}} that there is not time to feel moody. It's bracing to find every minute {{occupied}} by something useful." ...|$|R
500|$|One {{inspiration}} for the film is Corbucci's 1966 spaghetti western Django, whose star Franco Nero has a cameo appearance in Django Unchained. Another inspiration is the 1975 film Mandingo, about a slave trained to fight other slaves. Tarantino included scenes in the snow as a homage to The Great Silence. [...] "Silenzio {{takes place in the}} snow. <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> action in the snow so much, Django Unchained has a big snow section in the middle," [...] Tarantino said in an interview.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} also well-liked by the band. Mick Avory, who noted the song {{as one of}} the songs he was most proud to be {{associated}} with, said [...] "I always liked 'Lola', <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> subject. It's not like anything else. I liked it for that. We'd always take a different path". In a 1983 interview, Ray Davies said, [...] "I'm just very pleased I recorded it and more pleased I wrote it". The band revisited the [...] "Lola" [...] character in the lyrics of their 1981 song, [...] "Destroyer", a minor chart hit in America.|$|E
500|$|A [...] "symbol of courage, strength, and wisdom", Link was {{designed}} by Miyamoto as a coming of age motif for players to identify with: he begins the game an ordinary boy but strengthens to triumph over the ultimate evil. The name of the princess was inspired by Zelda Fitzgerald: [...] "Zelda {{was the name of}} the wife of the famous novelist F. Scott Fitzgerald. She was a famous and beautiful woman from all accounts, and <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> sound of her name. So I took the liberty of using her name for the very first Zelda title," [...] Miyamoto explained.|$|E

I {{tell you}} <b>I</b> <b>like</b> it. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> life; <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> light and shade of it all. I should hate your stiff English country houses, your highly moral amusements, and your dull day-by-day life. Look at those people's faces as they bend over the table!" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Miss Wallenrod is romantic in spirit, {{rather than}} in the form of her work. Her canvases have a design that is {{generally}} clear and strong. Her color is vivid, but never garish. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> mystery in her work- <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> moody intensity." [...] -Sol Wilson, 1946 ...|$|R
500|$|While a large {{majority}} of critics praised the main trivia storyline, many reviews criticized the Dwight and Robert plot. McNutt wrote that, [...] "As the trivia storyline was building momentum, the Florida storyline was killing that same momentum, a push-and-pull that the trivia ended up winning." [...] Forcella explained that [...] "the titular storyline of the gang playing 'Trivia' in Philadelphia worked really well, but the forced trio in Florida definitely did not." [...] Jill Mader from InsidePulse.com wrote, [...] "All in all, I thought it was an inconsistent episode – <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> trivia storyline, but the Dwight stuff really fell flat for me." ...|$|E
500|$|McQueen and MacGraw {{began an}} affair during production. She would {{eventually}} leave her husband Evans and become McQueen's second wife. Foster {{was worried that}} their relationship could have a potentially {{negative impact on the}} film by causing a [...] scandal. MacGraw got her start as a model, and her inexperience as an actress was evident on the set as she struggled with the role. According to Foster, the actress and Peckinpah got along well, but she was not happy with her performance: [...] "After we had completed The Getaway and I looked at what I had done in it, I hated my own performance. <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> picture, but I despised my own work." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Billboard magazine, Beyoncé discussed how excited she was about the collaboration stating, [...] "I loved working with Alejandro on 'Amor Gitano.' When I was asked to record with him, I immediately said 'yes.' He is extremely talented." [...] Alejandro Fernández stated that as the production [...] and recording of his album was nearly over, {{he was told that}} Beyoncé wanted to record a duet with a Latino male for her next album. He stated: [...] "So when they suggested it, <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> idea. I thought it was spectacular. So we went, I gave her the song and she liked it [...] We recorded it in one day. She seemed like a fine lady to me, very humble, with a great voice." ...|$|E

"I hoped you've spared no expense. <b>I</b> should <b>like</b> <b>the</b> hearse to be {{followed}} by a long string of empty coaches, and <b>I</b> should <b>like</b> <b>the</b> horses to wear tall nodding plumes, and there should be a vast number of mutes with long streamers on their hats. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> thought of all those empty coaches." ...|$|R

500|$|In 2006, he {{made his}} Broadway debut in Herman Wouk's two-act play The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial. Schwimmer {{played the role of}} Lieutenant Barney Greenwald in the production, which was {{directed}} by Jerry Zaks. In an interview with New York magazine, he revealed that he had wanted to try Broadway, however said [...] "a couple of things came up that just never quite felt right. Either because <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> play but wasn’t hot on the director, or there was another star attached that I wasn't jazzed about working with". He further added that when showed a copy of Wouk's novel [...] "...I was shocked at how good the writing was". His next film role was in the 2006 black comedy Big Nothing, in which he played a bitter, unemployed scientist.|$|E
500|$|It was {{followed}} the same year by House of Sand and Fog, a drama {{based on the novel}} by Andre Dubus III. She portrayed Kathy Nicolo, an abandoned wife whose inherited house is sold at auction to the Iranian emigre and former colonel Massoud Amir Behrani (Ben Kingsley). After reading the script, Connelly said: [...] "(the story is) moving and beautifully written. <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> fact that there is no good guy and bad guy. I found it really compelling that both sides do things that are morally questionable, because life is often like that." [...] Producer Michael London said about Connelly's portrayal: [...] "I think she understood Kathy and knew in her bones that she could take this character and give her the kind of dimension that she had. I don't think there is another actress who could have played Kathy with such power and grace." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with MTV News, Webb revealed that the video was a sequel of the music video [...] "Ocean Avenue"; [...] "The 'Holly' video expands {{on some of the}} elements of the 'Ocean Avenue' clip. There are references to it, particularly some scenes involving a suitcase. It refers to that world, and <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> idea of paralleling the band's experiences {{over the past two years}} with some of the things [...] Ryan [...] is going through in this video." [...] Webb went on to add that the reason Key is sprinting through Los Angeles, once again, is not bad guys that are after him, it is his [...] "own personal demons". Webb concluded that before filming began for the video, he had wanted to learn the experience that Key and bassist Peter Mosely were going through in New York, as they moved there to begin working on Lights and Sounds, and about the things they saw while they were there.|$|E

500|$|In its {{original}} broadcast, [...] "The Telltale Head" [...] finished twenty-sixth in {{ratings for the}} week of February 19–25, 1990, with a Nielsen rating of 15.2, equivalent to approximately 14.0 million viewing households. It was the second highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, following Married... with Children. Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood said they enjoyed: [...] "the Simpsons [...] grossly dysfunctional in church, Homer dispensing terrible advice, and a real moral dilemma for Bart." [...] In a DVD review of the first season, David B. Grelck gave the episode a rating of 3/5 and added, [...] "This is a strange episode, touching on many bizarre aspects of the show to come." [...] Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide said, [...] "Good little moments abounded, {{and this was a}} generally solid episode. <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> objects the boys saw in the clouds, and quite a few other funny bits appeared. “Telltale” wasn’t a great episode, but it was generally entertaining and clever." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{acting in}} the episode was praised by Michael Hogan and Rachel Ward, who wrote in The Daily Telegraph that [...] "with their gift for comedy, {{vulnerability}} and pathos, Tamsin Grieg and Sophie Thompson ... deliver excellent performances". Similarly, Owen wrote that [...] "the performances were good—especially from Thompson as the mousy housewife, and <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> sour expressions from child star Hutchinson". Nonetheless, he thought it regrettable than a real-world musician had not been cast, especially as he considered it unlikely that Tamsin would admire Parsons. Awarding the episode {{three and a half}} out of five, he thought [...] "the set-up ... sublime, the central dilemma amusing, and the execution typically brilliant". In the review published in The Star, [...] "Last Gasp" [...] was described as [...] "hilarious". The title, it was suggested, is appropriate, [...] "as I caught myself gasping more than once as its foul contents unfolded". Upton called the episode [...] "a clever little piece".|$|E
500|$|... "Material Girl" [...] {{was written}} by Peter Brown and Robert Rans, while Nile Rodgers {{produced}} the track. In 1986, Madonna told Company magazine, that although she did not write or create the song, the lyrical meaning and concept did apply to her situation at that point of time. She elaborated, [...] "I'm very career-oriented. You are attracted {{to people who are}} ambitious that way, too, like in the song 'Material Girl'. You are attracted to men who have material things because that's what pays the rents and buys you furs. That's the security. That lasts longer than emotions." [...] During a 2009 interview with Rolling Stone, Madonna was asked by interviewer Austin Scaggs, regarding her first feelings, after listening to the demos of [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] and [...] "Material Girl". Madonna responded by saying, [...] "I liked them both because they were ironic and provocative at the same time but also unlike me. I am not a materialistic person, and I certainly wasn't a virgin, and, by the way, how can you be like a virgin? <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> play on words, I thought they were clever. They're so geeky, they're cool." ...|$|E
