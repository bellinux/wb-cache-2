5000|$|A {{second type}} of {{electrostatic}} converter initially proposed by Post, then developed by Barr and Moir, is the Periodic <b>Electrostatic</b> <b>Focusing</b> concept. Like the Venetian Blind concept, {{it is also a}} direct collector, but the collector plates are disposed in many stages along the longitudinal axis of an <b>electrostatic</b> <b>focusing</b> channel. As each ion is decelerated along the channel toward zero energy, the particle becomes [...] "over-focused" [...] and is deflected sideways from the beam, then collected. The Periodic <b>Electrostatic</b> <b>Focusing</b> converter typically operates with a 600 keV D-T plasma (as low as 400 keV and up to 800 keV) with efficiency of about 60% under conditions compatible with economics, and an upper technical conversion efficiency up to 90% ignoring economic limitations.|$|E

40|$|Algorithms for protein {{structure}} comparison employ diverse and effective representations of molecular shape. However, {{they do not}} generally represent {{the shape of the}} electro-static potential field, except at the molecular surface. This approach neglects the geometry of the field {{on the outside of the}} molecular surface, where <b>electrostatic</b> <b>focusing</b> can play an important role in molecular recognition: Narrow clefts and grooves can partially shield charged atoms from the high dielectric solvent, enhancing potentials inside the cavity and projecting the lines of the electric field outwards from the cavity. This interplay between molecular shape and elec-trostatic potential is an essential means of recognition in many biomolecular systems. To leverage this phenomenon for more accurate {{protein structure}} comparison algorithms, this paper presents the first comparative representation of the region where focusing occurs. We first verified our rep-resentation in a case study of superoxide dismutase, where <b>electrostatic</b> <b>focusing</b> was first observed. Our method ac-curately identified the site where <b>electrostatic</b> <b>focusing</b> was established in the past. We then applied our representa-tion to compare regions of <b>electrostatic</b> <b>focusing</b> with the positions of charged amino acids, to determine where they coincide. Over 866 protein-DNA complexes, our represen-tations correctly detected the enrichment of arginines that contact regions of <b>electrostatic</b> <b>focusing</b> in the minor grooves of DNA. These results indicate that our novel methods pre-cisely represent and accurately compare regions where elec-trostatic focusing occurs. They also describe a novel and elegant technique for seamlessly integrating molecular shape and <b>electrostatic</b> <b>focusing</b> into the same structure compari-son framework...|$|E

The scheme exploits the positively charging of the target following an intense laser interaction. Reduction in the proton beam divergence, and commensurate increase in proton flux is observed while preserving the beam laminarity. The underlying mechanism has been established by the help of particle tracing simulations.

40|$|Abstract—Electrostatic {{focusing}} is {{a general}} phenomenon that occurs in cavities and grooves on the molecular surface of biomolecules. Narrow surface features can partially shield charged atoms from the high dielectric solvent, enhancing electrostatic potentials inside the cavity and projecting electric field lines outwards into the solvent. This effect has been observed in many instances and is widely considered in the human examination of molecular structure, but it is rarely integrated into the digital representations used in protein structure comparison software. To create a computational representation of <b>electrostatic</b> <b>focusing</b> that is compatible with structure comparison algorithms, this paper presents an approach that generates three dimensional solids that approximate regions where focusing occurs. We verify the accuracy of this representation against instances of focusing in proteins and DNA. Noting that this representation also identifies thin focusing regions on the molecular surface that are unlikely to affect binding, we describe a second algorithm that conservatively isolates larger focusing regions. The resulting three dimensional solids can be compared with Boolean Set operations, permitting a new range of analyses on the regions where <b>electrostatic</b> <b>focusing</b> occurs. They also represent a novel integration of molecular shape and <b>electrostatic</b> <b>focusing</b> into the same structure comparison framework...|$|E

40|$|An {{indirect}} {{flat panel}} imager (FPI) with programmable avalanche gain and field emitter array (FEA) readout {{is being investigated}} for low-dose and high resolution x-ray imaging. It is made by optically coupling a structured x-ray scintillator, e. g., thallium (Tl) doped cesium iodide (CsI), to an amorphous selenium (a-Se) avalanche photoconductor called high-gain avalanche rushing amorphous photoconductor (HARP). The charge image created by the scintillator∕HARP (SHARP) combination is read out by the electron beams emitted from the FEA. The proposed detector is called scintillator avalanche photoconductor with high resolution emitter readout (SAPHIRE). The programmable avalanche gain of HARP can improve the low dose performance of indirect FPI while the FEA {{can be made with}} pixel sizes down to 50 μm. Because of the avalanche gain, a high resolution type of CsI (Tl), which has not been widely used in indirect FPI due to its lower light output, can be used to improve the high spatial frequency performance. The purpose of the present article is to investigate the factors affecting the spatial resolution of SAPHIRE. Since the resolution performance of the SHARP combination has been well studied, the focus of the present work is on the inherent resolution of the FEA readout method. The lateral spread of the electron beam emitted from a 50 μm× 50 μm pixel FEA was investigated with two different electron-optical designs: mesh-electrode-only and <b>electrostatic</b> <b>focusing.</b> Our results showed that <b>electrostatic</b> <b>focusing</b> can limit the lateral spread of electron beams to within the pixel size of down to 50 μm.

40|$|Low energy beam {{transport}} (LEBT) for {{a future}} heavy ion driven inertial fusion (HIDIF [1]) facility is a crucial point using a Bi+ beam of 40 mA at 156 keV. High space charge forces (generalised perveance K= 3. 6 * 10 - 3) restrict the use of <b>electrostatic</b> <b>focussing</b> systems. On the other hand magnetic lenses using space charge compensation suffer from the low particle velocity. Additionally the emittance requirements are very high {{in order to avoid}} particle losses in the linac and at ring injection [2]. urthermore source noise and rise time of space charge compensation [3] might enhance particle losses and emittance. Gabor lenses [4] using a continuous space charge cloud for focussing could be a serious alternative to conventional LEBT systems. They combine strong cylinder symmetric focussing with partly space charge compensation and low emittance growth due to lower non linear fields. A high tolerance against source noise and current fluctuations and reduced investment costs are other possible advantages. The proof of principle has already been shown [5, 6].
