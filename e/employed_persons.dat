40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a social identity perspective to job insecurity research. Worrying about becoming jobless, we argue, is detrimental because it implies an anticipated membership of a negatively evaluated group – {{the group of}} unemployed people. Job insecurity hence threatens a person’s social identity as an <b>employed</b> <b>person.</b> This in turn will affect well-being and job performance. A three-wave survey study among 377 British employees supports this perspective. Persons who felt higher levels of job insecurity {{were more likely to}} report a weaker social identity as an <b>employed</b> <b>person.</b> This effect was found to be stable over time, and also held against a test of reverse causality. Furthermore, social identity as an <b>employed</b> <b>person</b> influenced well-being and in-role job performance and mediated the effect of job insecurity on these two variables over time.

The findings deliver interesting evidence for the role of social identity as an <b>employed</b> <b>person</b> in the relationships between job insecurity and its consequences.

40|$|The {{difference}} in labor supply across countries is often decomposed into hours worked per year per <b>employed</b> <b>person</b> and {{the fraction of}} <b>persons</b> <b>employed.</b> The difference between hours worked per <b>employed</b> <b>person</b> in Europe and the United States is {{due in large part}} to more weeks of vacation, more holidays, and more sick days in Europe than in the United States. However, sizable differences in labor supply remain after adjusting for hours per year per <b>employed</b> <b>person.</b> These differences are due to Europeans starting the working life later and, more importantly, retiring earlier. We develop a framework that incorporates this feature. In equilibrium what gets determined is how much people work over their lifetime, not when they work. As a result, policies intended to induce people to work a larger fraction of their lifetime, such as retirement systems that weight the last years of employment more heavily in determining benefits, only impact on when people work and not how much. Thus, most policies are offsetting. Key words: Aggregate labor supply, labor supply elasticity, indivisible labor, extensiv...|$|R

25|$|In {{terms of}} working conditions, {{a number of}} reforms were {{introduced}} aimed at strengthening the rights of workers {{both at home and}} in the workplace. The Sickness Act of 1970 provided equal treatment of workers and employees in the event of incapacity for work, while maternity leave was increased. Legislation was introduced in 1970 which ensured continued payment of wages for workers disabled by illness. In 1970 all employees unit for work (with the exception of women in receipt of maternity benefits and temporarily and inconsiderably <b>employed</b> <b>persons)</b> were provided with an unconditional legal claim against their employer to continued payment of their gross wage for a period of 6 weeks, as also in the case of spa treatment approved by an Insurance Fund, the Fund bearing the full cost thereof. Previously, payment of employer's supplement and sick pay were only made from the day on which the doctor certified unfitness for work. In 1972, an Act on Agency Work was passed which sought to prevent works agencies from providing job placement services and aimed to provide job minimum protection for employees in agency work. A law on the hiring out of manpower, passed in October 1972, contained provisions to stipulate prior authorization for the hiring out of manpower, to draw a distinction between the system governing workers hired out and the placing of workers, to regulate and improve the rights of hired out workers pertaining to working conditions and social insurance, and provide for more severe penalties and fines to be imposed on offenders.|$|E

These two industries were selected because before 1995 they were protected in many respects, thus vulnerable to increased competition after accession. The financial ratios selected are cash-flow per <b>employed</b> <b>person,</b> mean absolute deviation of cash-flow per <b>employed</b> <b>person</b> (as a variation-based risk measure), debt per <b>employed</b> <b>person</b> and financing cost as percentage of external debt. Together these four ratios determine a firm's creditworthiness. Our study is unique in that it is based on micro data, which allows us to consider the whole distribution of the ratios as compared to only aggregates as in other studies and to examine the scale effects within idustries. The data basis are balance sheets of more than 14, 000 retail and 8, 000 wholesale trade firms of all size classes during 1989 - 1996.

By 1926 827 Armenians had settled in Valence, and 1,670 by 1931 – from Bursa, Malatya and Harput. If the Armenians were popular among their employers, they encountered the distrust of the Valence people. It was a group with a very high proportion of young adults, children and the elderly who suffered most from the genocide and from the journey into exile. They worked mainly as labourers, or founded small businesses (25% of <b>employed</b> <b>persons).</b> Very quickly, an [...] "Armenian quarter" [...] developed between Boulevard Vauban, Rue Farnerie, Rue Madier-Montjau, and the Boulevard d'Alsace, 40% populated by Armenians.

During that same year, bills were tabled to extend and increase housing allowances (passed in 1970), to extend and standardise {{the promotion of}} vocational training (passed in 1971), to automatically index pensions for war victims (passed in 1970), to increase family allowances (passed in 1970), and to reform “shop rules” (which came into force in 1972). In 1974, a bankruptcy allowance was introduced for <b>employed</b> <b>persons</b> when their employers became insolvent. Developments in accident insurance led to the inclusion of schoolchildren, students and children at kindergarten and thus to more widespread measures for accident prevention. In addition, farm and household assistance was introduced as a new service in agricultural accident insurance. A major pension reform law extended the accessibility of pension insurance by providing generous possibilities for backpayments of contributions, while adjustment of currently paid out pensions was brought forward by 6 months. The Rehabilitation and Assimilation Law of 1974 improved and standardised benefits for the disabled, while a law was passed that same year on {{the establishment of an}} additional relief fund for persons employed in agriculture and forestry. The Law on the Improvement of Works’ Old Age Schemes of 1974 brought conditional non-forfeiture of qualifying periods for works pensions as well as the prohibition of cuts in works pensions due to increases in social insurance pensions. In addition, a number of reforms in areas such as civil and consumer rights the environment, education, and urban renewal were carried out. in 1972, a pension reform act was passed which, according to one historical study, ensured that workers “would not suffer financial hardship and could maintain an adequate standard of living after retirement.” In 1973, sickness benefits became available in cases where a parent had to care for a sick child. In March 1974, Social Assistance (SA) was expanded, “concerning family supplements, means test, and certain additional payments.” ...|$|E

The hour {{has come for}} democracy in America to inaugurate itself in the two directions specified--autochthonic poems and personalities--born expressers of itself, its spirit alone, to radiate in subtle ways, not only in art, but the practical and familiar, in the transactions between employers and <b>employed</b> <b>persons,</b> in business and wages, and sternly {{in the army and}} navy, and revolutionizing them. I find nowhere a scope profound enough, and radical and objective enough, either for aggregates or individuals. The thought and identity of a poetry in America to fill, and worthily fill, the great void, and enhance these aims, electrifying all and several, involves the essence and integral facts, real and spiritual, of the whole land, the whole body. What the great sympathetic is to the congeries of bones, joints, heart, fluids, nervous system and vitality, constituting, launching forth in time and space a human being--aye, an immortal soul--such relation, and no less, holds true poetry to the single personality, or to the nation.|$|E
6000|$|But {{the same}} {{principle}} serves to keep the internal politics of the Germans quiet, and prevent Socialism being the practical hope or peril {{it has been in}} so many other countries. It operates in two ways; first, by a curious fallacy about [...] "the time not being ripe"--as if time could ever be ripe. The same savage superstition from the forests had infected Matthew Arnold pretty badly when he made a personality out of the Zeitgeist--perhaps the only ghost that was ever entirely fabulous. It is tricked by a biological parallel, by which the chicken always comes out of the egg [...] "at the right time." [...] He does not; he comes out when he comes out. The Marxian Socialist will not strike till the clock strikes; and the clock is made in Germany, and never strikes. Moreover, the theory of all history as a search for food makes the masses content with having food and physic, but not freedom. The best working model in the matter is the system of Compulsory Insurance; which was a total failure and dead letter in France but has been, in the German sense, a great success in Germany. It treats <b>employed</b> <b>persons</b> as a fixed, separate, and lower caste, who must not themselves dispose of the margin of their small wages. In 1911 it was introduced into England by Mr. Lloyd George, who had studied its operations in Germany, and, by the Prussian prestige in [...] "social reform," [...] was passed.|$|E

But an old friend and school companion who happened to see her during a brief visit to London, was inexpressibly distressed by the change that she detected in Agnes. This lady was Mrs. Westwick, the wife of that brother of Lord Montbarry who came next to him in age, and who was described in the 'Peerage' as presumptive heir to the title. He was then away, looking after his interests in some mining property which he possessed in America. Mrs. Westwick insisted on taking Agnes back with her to her home in Ireland. 'Come and keep me company while my husband is away. My three little girls will make you their playfellow, and the only stranger you will meet is the governess, whom I answer for your liking beforehand. Pack up your things, and I will call for you to-morrow {{on my way to the}} train.' In those hearty terms the invitation was given. Agnes thankfully accepted it. For three happy months she lived under the roof of her friend. The girls hung round her in tears at her departure; the youngest of them wanted to go back with Agnes to London.
