5|$|By the 19th century, {{the tower}} was {{obscured}} by the surrounding buildings, and was accessed through the brick-built office in front of it, according to the antiquarian and engraver John Smith. The tower began to become too small <b>for</b> <b>storing</b> all the House of Lords' records, and from 1827 onwards only the acts, journals and minute-books were kept in the tower.|$|E
5|$|During the 18th century, Stokesay Castle {{continued}} to be leased by the Baldwyn family, although they sublet the property {{to a range of}} tenants; after this point it ceased {{to be used as a}} domestic dwelling. Two wood and plaster buildings, built against the side of the hall, were demolished around 1800, and by the early 19th century the castle was being used <b>for</b> <b>storing</b> grain and manufacturing, including barrel-making, coining and a smithy.|$|E
5|$|In 1859, {{the castle}} was re-equipped with heavier artillery, a {{combination}} of 32-pounder (15kg) and 68-pounder (31kg) guns. A new magazine was constructed, comprising a large, brick-built building divided into three rooms <b>for</b> <b>storing</b> gunpowder, specially designed to keep the powder dry. The exterior gun emplacements were also redesigned, reusing the 1806 foundations; the two surviving emplacements, in the north-east and north-west bastions, date from 1859.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to protecting the Thames, in the 18th century Tilbury {{also began to}} be used a transit depot and <b>for</b> <b>storing</b> gunpowder. It continued to be essential for the defence of the capital and a new artillery battery was added in the south-east corner during the Napoleonic Wars. The fort became increasingly less significant as a defensive structure, however, as military technology developed in the 19th century. It was redeveloped to hold heavy artillery after 1868, providing a second-line of defence along the river, but further changes in technology meant that it had become obsolete {{by the end of}} the century. Instead Tilbury became a strategic depot, forming a logistical hub <b>for</b> <b>storing</b> and moving troops and materiel throughout the First World War. The fort had only a limited role in the Second World War and was demobilised in 1950.|$|E
5|$|November 2010 saw {{the first}} {{performances}} on the organ after an 18-month renovation by its original builders Harrison & Harrison, costing around £800,000. The organ had been disassembled {{and some of it}} taken away to the builders' workshop in Durham. The pipes were cleaned and the leather of the bellows was replaced. The manuals were also fitted with an electronic panel <b>for</b> <b>storing</b> combinations of stop settings.|$|E
5|$|Over 400 souterrains {{have been}} {{discovered}} in Scotland, {{many of them in}} the south-east, and although few have been dated those that have suggest a construction date in the 2nd or 3rd centuries. Unfortunately the purpose of these small underground structures is also obscure. They are usually found close to settlements (whose timber frames are much less well-preserved) and may have been <b>for</b> <b>storing</b> perishable agricultural products.|$|E

5|$|The {{church was}} {{originally}} constructed of flint with stone dressings, but was substantially refaced with knapped flint in the 1880s; the tower was restored {{at the same}} time. A wall was built behind the altar in 1886 to create a separate sacristy <b>for</b> <b>storing</b> vestments and other items. The west tower was restored again in 1989, and the current doors to the sacristy were added in the same year.|$|E
5|$|After the Restoration of Charles II, the pre-war {{owners of}} the {{property}} laid claim to Clifford's Tower, eventually being granted ownership. A garrison continued to be stationed there, however, which prevented the owners from actually occupying or using the property. Repairs {{were made to the}} tower, and it became a magazine <b>for</b> <b>storing</b> gunpowder and shot. Attempts were made to restore the condition of the moat, which had become badly silted. Some political prisoners continued to be held at the castle during the Restoration period, including George Fox, the founder of the Society of Friends.|$|E

5|$|Beyond {{the area}} of Roman occupation, {{in the west and}} north, there are over 60 sites {{identified}} of wheelhouses. Perhaps a development of earlier Atlantic roundhouses, these have a characteristic outer wall surrounding a circle of stone piers (bearing a resemblance to the spokes of a wheel). Over 400 souterrains, small underground constructions, have been discovered in Scotland, many of them in the south-east, and although few have been dated, those that have suggest a construction date in the second or third centuries CE. They are usually found close to settlements (whose timber frames are much less well-preserved) and may have been <b>for</b> <b>storing</b> perishable agricultural products.|$|E
5|$|By the 12th century, Southampton was an {{important}} trading port with trade routes to Normandy, the Levant and Gascony. Both the town and castle played {{an important}} role in this trade, in part forming a warehouse for the king's imports, this process being managed by a Crown Bailiff. The former castle hall was turned into a subterranean vault in the 13th century, probably <b>for</b> <b>storing</b> wine. Stone houses, often combining accommodation and storage facilities, began to be built in Southampton by the wealthiest merchants, particularly in the prosperous western and southern parts of the town, but these properties could not be easily defended against attack.|$|E

She was stricken on 18 November 1920 and sold for scrapping on 8 April 1921. She was broken up that year in Hamburg.|$|E

5|$|Females {{have two}} {{openings}} located under {{the edge of}} the mantle in the mantle cavity: the opening of the vagina and an opening for laying eggs. The vagina accepts the sperm during copulation. The vagina is connected to the bursa copulatrix and to the spermatheca (<b>for</b> <b>storing</b> sperm). The other opening is for laying eggs. Egg cells originate in the ovary. Egg cells travel through the oviduct to the fertilization chamber, where fertilization occur. Eggs then develop in the glandular uterus. A capsule is formed in the diverticulum next to the uterus. The eggs are then laid.|$|E
5|$|Further {{work was}} {{conducted}} by Otto von Guericke, Robert Boyle, Stephen Gray and C. F. du Fay. In the 18th century, Benjamin Franklin conducted extensive research in electricity, selling his possessions to fund his work. In June 1752 he is reputed to have attached a metal key {{to the bottom of}} a dampened kite string and flown the kite in a storm-threatened sky. A succession of sparks jumping from the key {{to the back of his}} hand showed that lightning was indeed electrical in nature. He also explained the apparently paradoxical behavior of the Leyden jar as a device <b>for</b> <b>storing</b> large amounts of electrical charge in terms of electricity consisting of both positive and negative charges.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the Presidential Election of 1872 two {{congressional and}} one Treasury Department {{investigations}} {{took place over}} corruption at the New York Custom House under Grant collector appointments Moses H. Grinnell and Thomas Murphy. Private warehouses were taking imported goods from the docks and charging shippers storage fees. Grant's friend, George K. Leet, was allegedly involved with exorbitant pricing <b>for</b> <b>storing</b> goods and splitting the profits. Grant's third collector appointment, Chester A. Arthur, implemented Secretary of Treasury George S. Boutwell's reform to keep the goods protected on the docks rather than private storage.|$|E
