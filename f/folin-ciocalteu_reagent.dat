30|$|A {{sophisticated}} reaction can {{be observed}} between phenolic compounds and phosphotungstic and phosphomolybdic acids in <b>Folin-Ciocalteu</b> <b>reagents</b> [108]. Phenolic compounds present in plant extracts exhibited high antioxidant and reduction activities, which are important for the synthesis of AgNPs [109]. The higher total phenolic content of Eclipta prostrata leaf extracts supports the assembly of silver ions into smaller AgNPs, because of the donation of electrons by these compounds [110].|$|R
50|$|The method {{combines}} {{the reactions of}} copper ions with the peptide bonds under alkaline conditions (the Biuret test) with the oxidation of aromatic protein residues. The Lowry method {{is based on the}} reaction of Cu+, produced by the oxidation of peptide bonds, with <b>Folin-Ciocalteu</b> <b>reagent</b> (a mixture of phosphotungstic acid and phosphomolybdic acid in the Folin-Ciocalteu reaction). The reaction mechanism is not well understood, but involves reduction of the <b>Folin-Ciocalteu</b> <b>reagent</b> and oxidation of aromatic residues (mainly tryptophan, also tyrosine). Experiments have shown that cysteine is also reactive to the reagent. Therefore, cysteine residues in protein probably also contribute to the absorbance seen in the Lowry assay. The concentration of the reduced Folin reagent is measured by absorbance at 750 nm. As a result, the total concentration of protein in the sample can be deduced from the concentration of tryptophan and tyrosine residues that reduce the <b>Folin-Ciocalteu</b> <b>reagent.</b>|$|E
