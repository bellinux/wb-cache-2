5|$|The nave and chancel {{are carried}} on five pairs of piers and the {{interior}} has a boarded wagon roof coloured in blue, crimson and gold which stretches the whole length of the church. At {{the time of the}} construction of the Bristol and Exeter Railway, William Froude – the engineer given responsibility <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>section</b> of the line by Isambard Kingdom Brunel – inserted iron stringers to prevent the walls from spreading as a result of vibrations from the trains. A screen runs across the whole width of the church.|$|E
5|$|Artist and {{inventor}} Bill Lishman created two sculptures <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>section</b> of the park, {{as well as}} {{some smaller}} works for application to the buildings. The most prominent is a dragon {{at the entrance to the}} Dragon Fire, which had originally been intended to hold a sign, but the park management decided they liked it enough for it to be a standalone sculpture. Lishman was allowed to design it from scratch, as opposed to follow preset designs established before he was hired, taking him and assistant Richard Van Heuvelan two months to complete. The other main sculpture was the wild boar at Wild Beast, both this and the dragon being built at his home in Blackstock, Ontario, for about $75,000. Signs by Lishman included Sherwood Florist, Boo Boo's Buggys, an ice cream cone, and for a popcorn counter.|$|E

25|$|The section between Humber River and Jameson Avenue was {{completed}} in 1958. The expressway, by then named the Gardiner Expressway, was officially opened by Gardiner and Ontario Premier Leslie Frost on August 8, 1958. When this section opened, it opened without guard-rails on the median dividing the different directions. Steel guard-rails and a 'glare shield' were approved <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>section</b> in 1965 {{at a cost of}} $200,000.|$|E
25|$|The short section between Junctions 27 and 29 {{was built}} between 1967 and 1969, by Devon County Council, as the A38 Cullompton Bypass, with the {{intention}} that it should {{become part of the}} M5. The termini <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>section</b> have since been removed, although part of the southern terminal roundabout is now used as an emergency access.

25|$|The three {{sections}} between Norton junction and the River Trent (collectively {{known as the}} 'Leicester line') are mixed in size. From Norton to Foxton, the route is a narrow canal. From below Foxton to Leicester it is a wide canal. From Leicester to the Trent, the route is effectively the River Soar and the locks and bridges are wide. Another Act of 1931 authorised the widening of the locks at Watford and Foxton, but with Government grants <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>section</b> not forthcoming, the work was not carried out.|$|E

Some of the contestants had not been paid their prize money. TV3 advised viewers who played the game to go to RegTel with any complaints.|$|E

25|$|There is {{a section}} {{dedicated}} to piñatas, most made with cardboard {{and covered in}} crepe paper, although more traditional ones with a clay pot in the center can still be found. Designs range from traditional stars to those based on recent figures from popular movies and television shows. The busiest time of year <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>section</b> of the market is December, before Christmas, when a tradition called “Las Posadas” often involves the breaking {{of one or more}} piñatas. While traditional to that season, the breaking of piñatas is no longer confined to December and can be found at various types of celebrations year round, which helps to support this section’s permanent presence.|$|E
25|$|At Ormskirk, it reverts from a dual {{to single}} {{carriageway}} {{on an old}} bypass. The road follows through Burscough and Rufford, despite a bypass being considered <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>section</b> in the early 1980s, before reaching the A565 at Tarleton. The road continues over the Leeds and Liverpool Canal and River Douglas through to Longton (and Hutton) bypass, where it returns to dual carriageway. Passing Lancashire Police HQ, the road continues through Penwortham across the River Ribble into Preston, by-passing the city centre via Ring Way, where the A583 from Blackpool converges. It briefly merges with the A6 before heading East and meeting the M6 at junction 31, after which the road splits into two separate carriageways until it meets the A677 for Blackburn.|$|E
25|$|The market sells occult items {{related to}} magic (white and black), pre-Hispanic {{religious}} and magical traditions, Santería, the cult of Santa Muerte, shamanism, and various others which demonstrate the syncretism of beliefs and practices {{that exist in the}} city. The market is one of the city’s centers for practices related to Santería and the worship of Santa Muerte. It is estimated that 2,000 people each weekend come to the market specifically <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>section</b> of the market. Items for sale include amulets, horseshoes, candles {{in a wide variety of}} sizes, shapes and colors, with many of the colors have very specific functions, gold dust, black salt, powders of unknown ingredients, water of Saint Ignatius-to ward off unwanted attention, aromatic lotions and soaps, many of which are related to love spells and more.|$|E

25|$|When Munich {{was awarded}} the Olympic Summer Games 1972 in 1965, the U-Bahn network concept (which was adopted only one year earlier) had to be revised {{to speed up the}} {{construction}} of a connection to the Olympic venues at Olympic grounds. The Olympic connector (now U3) was redesigned as a branch of the U6 line, because the original plan of a direct connection to the Olympic ground from Munich Central Station was not feasible in the shortness of time. This original U3 sections consists of four stations (from north to south): Olympiazentrum, Petuelring, Scheidplatz, where cross-platform interchange to the U2 (the line originally supposed to serve the Olympic venues) is possible since 1980, and Bonner Platz. After Bonner Platz the U3 reaches Münchner Freiheit, where it joins the U6 to run together through the inner city section to Implerstraße (<b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>section</b> see U6 below).|$|E
25|$|Entirely {{different}} in origin {{is the first}} part of the second section, drawn undoubtedly from an old tannaitic source. Four sentences of this section are cited in the Talmud as being taken from a Baraita (B. B. 90b; Sanh. 76b; Shab. 88b), and one in the name of Abba Arika (Sanh. l.c.), who often quoted old sentences and maxims (Er. 54a). The composition shows that this section is not taken from the Talmud, for the division into 12 good and 12 bad classes of men is not found in the latter. The other half of this section, however, is probably a later interpolation, belonging properly to the third section. <b>For</b> <b>this</b> <b>section</b> begins with a saying of Ben Azzai concerning four things the contemplation of which would keep men from sin: hence the four classes of four things each that are enumerated in the second section.|$|E
25|$|Running {{approximately}} parallel both to {{the coast}} of the Solent and to the A27, the M27 starts as an eastwards continuation of the A31 from Bournemouth and Poole, meets the A36 from Salisbury, crosses the Wessex Main Line railway, and then meets the M271 to central Southampton. After the M271, the road becomes a dual four lane motorway and passes Rownhams services, it then meets the M3, (two lanes going off, two lanes continuing {{to the other side of}} the junction) reverting to a dual three lane motorway as it passes to the north of Southampton, passes Southampton Airport, meeting Junction 7 and becoming dual four lanes again, then becoming dual three lanes after Junction 8, it then runs alongside the West Coastway Line as it heads south-east towards Fareham. It then runs alongside the northern outskirts of Fareham, briefly with a fourth climbing lane in either direction, before its junction with the M275 to Portsmouth. Very shortly after this point the motorway ends, becoming the A27, a four lane dual carriageway almost to motorway standards until the junction with the A3 (M) Motorway. The official reason <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>section</b> of road not being a continuation of the motorway is the hard shoulders being too narrow. Although the M275 which the M27 junctions with, has no official hard shoulders throughout its entire length.|$|E
