The results have shown {{that a lot of}} subgrain appears in the microstructure of the welded joint resulting in the refined grain after cryogenic treatment. The obvious increasing in content of β-phase (Mg 2 Al 3) is distributed and dispersed evenly, contributed to dispersion strengthening of the welded joint. Meanwhile, orientation phenomena is obtained for some grain after deep cryogenic treatment. As a result, the microstructure of the joint can be modified by the deep cryogenic treatment...|$|E
40|$|A {{study has}} been made of the effects of welding and {{material}} variables on the occurrence of porosity in tungsten <b>inert</b> <b>gas</b> <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> of copper. The experiments were based on a statistical design and variables included, welding current, welding speed, arc atmosphere composition, inert gas flow rate, weld preparation, and base material. The extent of weld metal porosity was assessed by density measurement and its morphology by X-ray radiography and metallography. In conjunction with this the copper-steam reaction has been investigated under conditions of controlled atmosphere arc melting. The welding experiments have shown that the extent of steam porosity is increased by increased water vapour content of the arc atmosphere, increased oxygen content of the base material and decreased welding speed. The arc melting experiments have shown that the steam reaction occurs {{in the body of the}} weld pool and proceeds to an apparent equi 1 ibrium state appropriate to to its temperature, the hydrogen and oxygen being supplied by the dissociation of water vapour in the arc atmosphere. It has been shown conclusively that nitrogen porosity can occur in the tungsten <b>inert</b> <b>gas</b> <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> of copper and that this porosity can be eliminated by using filler wires containing small amounts of aluminum and titanium. Since it has been shown to be much more difficult to produce sound butt welds than melt runs it has been concluded that the porosity associated with joint fit up is due to nitrogen entrained into tho arc atmosphere. Clearly atmospheric entrainment would also, to a much lesser extent, involve water vapour. From a practical welding point of view it has thus been postulated that use of a filler wire containing small amounts of aluminum and/or titanium would eliminate both forms of porosity since these elements are both strongJy deoxidising and denitriding...|$|E

The microhardness increases in the fusion zones (FZs) obtained with pulsed welding process {{with respect to their}} microstructural evolution. The increase of the pulse frequency contributes to the formation of a significant amount of residual ␤ phase in the FZ which is accompanied by a decrease of its microhardness. The tensile residual stresses (RSs) level in the pulsed process is lower than the one of the unpulsed one. The tensile RSs induced by both welding processes in the heat affected zone (HAZ) are found to decrease when increasing the pulse frequency.

The radioactive concentrations were 1. 11 × 10 – 2 Bq/m 3 during TIG welding of aluminum (TIG/Al), 1. 78 × 10 – 4 Bq/m 3 during TIG welding of stainless steel (TIG/SS), and 1. 93 × 10 – 1 3 Bq/m during electrode sharpening, with 5. 82 × 10 – 5 Bq/m 3 background concentration. Although the annual intake of 232 Th estimated using these values did not exceed the annual limit intake (ALI, 1. 6 × 102 Bq), we recommend reducing 232 Th exposure by substituting thoriated electrodes with a thorium-free electrodes, setting up local ventilation systems, and by using respiratory protective equipment.

40|$|AbstractThe {{influences}} of parameters of tungsten <b>inert</b> <b>gas</b> <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> on the morphology, microstructure, tensile property and fracture of welded joints of Ni-base superalloy have been studied. Results {{show that the}} increase of welding current and the decrease of welding speed bring about {{the large amount of}} heat input in the welding pool and the enlargement of width and deepness of the welding pool. The increase of impulse frequency has the same effect on the microstructure compared with the increase of welding current. The effect of welding parameters on the tensile strength and fracture was analyzed. It is found that the root of welding joint is unwelded when the welding current is lower, so that the strength and elongation of welded joint are inferior. And the more welding defects in the welding zone and the more hard and brittle phase precipitates in the overheated zone when the welding current is too high. Consequently, the strength and plasticity go up first and then go down, i. e. they have a peak value with welding current increasing. In addition, the decrease of impulse frequency is beneficial to the strength of the welded joint...|$|E
40|$|An {{approach}} to reduce manufacturing cost, weight, design and improve {{quality of a}} component is {{through the use of}} tailor welded blanks (TWBs). TWBs are welded blanks that consist of similar or dissimilar material, thicknesses, and surface properties before forming process. The purpose of the project is to evaluate the strength and fatigue behavior of the TWBs with different thickness combination and loading direction. The welding process was done by tungsten <b>inert</b> <b>gas</b> (TIG) <b>arc</b> <b>welding.</b> This study is divided into three parts. First, tensile tests were carried out. It was found that combinations were affected by the difference in thickness (2 mm/ 3 mm) and weld orientation (45 o and 90 o towards loading direction). The failure occurred {{in the middle of the}} weaker base metal parts. However, some of the joint specimens broke at the heat-affected zone. In addition, weld loading direction played a dominant role when the thickness difference was large. The second part investigates the effect of welding joint on the fatigue strength of the TWBs combination. The experimental results show that the failure occurs at welding zone as the specimens were subjected to fatigue and impact loading. In the last part of this thesis, the examination of the weld quality was carried out. Through the microstructure constituents in the weld, the strength and effects on the TWBs were discusse...|$|R

The results concerning body burdens are in excellent agreement with the dioxin exposure as characterized by dioxin air concentration in the workplace.
