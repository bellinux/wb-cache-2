40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} environmental sustainability and green schools, seeking to highlight the benefits and determine the Net Present Value (NPV) installing vegetative roofs on all schools in the Atlanta Public Schools District. This study quantifies {{the costs and benefits}} of thin-layer, or extensive, green roof systems as they compare to typical flat roofs on Atlanta Public Schools. Quantifiable benefits are detailed and suggestions are made to create the means by which other social benefits may be quantified. The purpose of this thesis is to <b>establish</b> <b>proof</b> <b>to</b> the Atlanta Public Schools District that over a 40 year period there are more benefits associated with installing vegetative roofs on all of their flat roofs than there are costs. While some may argue that greens roof are more costly than traditional roof systems, this study provides evidence that the cumulative benefits over a 40 year life cycle associated with large scale green roof installations, such as on all Atlanta Public Schools, are greater than the initial costs incurred. Factors included in the analysis of benefits were reductions to energy/utility costs, reduced emissions, and avoided best management practices (BMPs). Other considerations include social benefits resulting from the mitigation of storm water runoff, reductions to the urban heat island, productivity level increases (students and teachers), and avoided regulatory fees.

40|$|From {{the time}} when Nash {{proposed}} 8 axioms as the basic to understand the individual utility theory, many scholars such as Schmidt, Sobel, Gerber and van Damme anticipated that in understanding the same theory, the axioms were strongly influenced by the 5 axioms previously proposed by von Neumann and Morgenstern.

40|$|A {{design is}} based on knowledge, intuition and skill, which are {{embedded}} in the process, but are only partially communicated by the results for further development. This paper investigates in what manner design can perform {{as an instrument of}} research. As a case study, design work performed by the author in an academic environment, having Hanoi as the locus of investigation, illustrates how architectural questioning exceeds the process of <b>establishing</b> <b>proof</b> <b>to</b> make the case for a design approach, but moreover, can establish scientifically exchangeable knowledge. Primarily, the studio established a vision for urban development, consolidated within a number of strategic projects. In doing so, it devised an urban paradigm that was tested with design proposals. Secondly, the studio results are involved in a critical review of underlying theoretical concepts. If a design approach is not able to prove the hypothesis defined in an urban vision, the applied framework experiences a crisis as defined by Thomas S. Kuhn. Considering that a framework is established by theory, and design tools are developed and applied within practice, research by design reflects upon both aspects. This leads to an explanation of urban phenomena defined within the discipline. As a research practice, the design addresses lacunas, resulting either in an affirmation or a collapse – a crisis – of the theoretical framework. The specific case of Hanoi asked for the juxtaposition of ‘postmetropolitan’ theory focused on the city territory and theory of ‘everydayness,’ analysing small scale spatial production. Thus, {{the findings of this study}} present an approach that considers the interaction between the fragment and the overview. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Souvenirs are synonym with tourist {{and tourism}} activities. Souvenirs also plays an {{important}} role while traveling. This is because, souvenirs will make the person to recall places that have visited. The purpose of this research is to establish a study on souvenirs available in Melaka. It has become a tradition for a tourist to bring home souvenirs as a memory and token of appreciation representing that he or she has reached a particular new destination. This {{is due to the fact}} that souvenirs can be <b>established</b> as <b>proof</b> <b>to</b> indicate that a person had really gone on a vacation. The main purpose of the researcher is to identify the choices of souvenirs among international tourists in the research area of Bandar Hilir in the Historical City of Melaka. In this study, the types of souvenirs available in Bandar Hilir will be identified, as well as the purchasing factors of international tourists towards the types of souvenirs offered, and to also identify the tourists’ allocation in purchasing of these souvenirs. International tourists shall be categorised based on the world’s continents. In this study, the researcher will utilise the method of frequency in identifying the type of souvenir purchased by tourists, utilising a mean score to identify the souvenir selection or purchasing factor, and finally to utilise a crosstab to identify the selection and purchase of souvenirs based on tourist’s continent of origin. Apart from the aforementioned, the researcher utilises a schedule to identify the location of every souvenir preferred by these international tourists according to his or her continent...|$|R
40|$|The active contour/snake {{model is}} one of the most {{successful}} variational models in image segmentation. It consists of evolving a contour in images toward the boundaries of objects. Its success is based on strong mathematical properties and efficient numerical schemes based on the level set method. The only drawback of this model is the existence of local minima in the active contour energy, which makes the initial guess critical to get satisfactory results. In this paper, we propose to solve this problem by determining a global minimum of the active contour model. Our approach is based on the unification of image segmentation and image denoising tasks into a global minimization framework. More precisely, we propose to unify three well-known image variational models, namely the snake model, the Rudin– Osher–Fatemi denoising model and the Mumford–Shah segmentation model. We will <b>establish</b> theorems with <b>proofs</b> <b>to</b> determine the existence of a global minimum of the active contour model. From a numerical point of view, we propose a new practical way to solve the active contour propagation problem toward object boundaries through a dual formulation of the minimization problem.

40|$|Introduction One of {{the body}} fluids often used in {{metabolomics}} studies is urine. The concentrations of metabolites in urine are affected by hydration status of an individual, resulting in dilution differences. This requires therefore normalization of the data to correct for such differences. Two normalization techniques are commonly applied to urine samples prior to their further statistical analysis. First, AUC normalization aims to normalize a group of signals with peaks by standardizing the area under the curve (AUC) within a sample to the median, mean or any other proper representation {{of the amount of}} dilution. The second approach uses specific end-product metabolites such as creatinine and all intensities within a sample are expressed relative to the creatinine intensity. Objectives Another way of looking at urine metabolomics data is by realizing that the ratios between peak intensities are the information-carrying features. This opens up possibilities to use another class of data analysis techniques designed to deal with such ratios: compositional data analysis. The aim {{of this paper is to}} develop PARAFAC modeling of three-way urine metabolomics data in the context of compositional data analysis and compare this with standard normalization techniques. Methods In the compositional data analysis approach, special coordinate systems are defined to deal with the ratio problem. In essence, it comes down to using other distance measures than the Euclidian Distance that is used in the conventional analysis of metabolomic data. Results We illustrate using this type of approach in combination with three-way methods (i. e. PARAFAC) of a longitudinal urine metabolomics study and two simulations. In both cases, the advantage of the compositional approach is established in terms of improved interpretability of the scores and loadings of the PARAFAC model. Conclusion For urine metabolomics studies, we advocate the use of compositional data analysis approaches. They are easy to use, well <b>established</b> and <b>proof</b> <b>to</b> give reliable results...|$|R

40|$|In {{litigation}} regarding employment discrimination, {{the burden}} of <b>establishing</b> <b>proof</b> has continued <b>to</b> shift. As a result, employers and legal counsel {{need to be aware}} of the status of what they and human resources professionals should consider when an employee alleges that the employer has vio­lated federal discrimination statutes. The original standard of proof required the plaintiff to establish that the employer dis­criminated against that person. Many cases still involve that approach, giving the plaintiff {{the burden of}} creating a prima facie case. However, another line of rulings by the U. S. Supreme Court added an alternative method for addressing discrimination litigation, known as the mixed motive approach. The two-prong mixed motive case requires the employee to demonstrate that a protected character­istic (e. g., race, sex, national origin) was a substantial factor in an employer’s adverse action. If that is established, the employer then has the burden of proving that the de­cision would have been made in any event, regardless of the employee’s protected char­acteristic. As a practical matter, employers facing litigation of this type must consider whether and how to defend such a case. Even a “win” can be expensive, because in cases where there is a divided decision, the employer must pay the plaintiff’s attorney fees and court costs, as well as its own. Moreover, since the Civil Rights Act of 1991 places discrimination cases in front of a jury, a divided decision is seemingly more likely. Although that presumably gives both sides a win, it still means a large expense for the employer...|$|R
