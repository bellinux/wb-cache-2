60|$|Short as was {{the time}} since the snow had cleared off the ground, spring had come in with marvellous rapidity. The grass was already well-nigh knee-deep, and flowers of various kinds were in full bloom. Where the ground was {{comparatively}} bare of grass, it was studded with the yellow blossoms of wild heart's-ease, and amongst some stunted alder-trees Godfrey found a <b>dwarf</b> <b>rose</b> already in bud, and wild onions and wild rhubarb in flower. Then he came upon a broad expanse of a shrub that looked to him like a rhododendron, with a flower with a strong aromatic scent. Several times he heard the call of a cuckoo. On a patch of sand there were some wild anemones in blossom. Godfrey pulled a bulb of wild onion, cut off a slice and tasted it. It was similar in flavour to the cultivated plant, but very sharp and acrid. However he set to work, and pulled up several dozen bulbs. They were small, not exceeding {{the size of a}} radish, but they would be very valuable, as one of them chopped fine would be sufficient to give a savour to a whole goose.|$|E

50|$|The prairie {{is noted}} for {{exceptional}} plant diversity, with nearly 100 separate species identified {{on the tiny}} site. Forbs include the <b>dwarf</b> prairie <b>rose,</b> prairie shooting star, and spiderwort. Grasses include the prairie dropseed.

40|$|Presented {{review of}} rose diseases, {{associated}} with the plant degeneration symptoms, includes rose streak, rose colour break, rose rosette or rose witches' broom, rose dieback, rose wilt, rose stunt, rose leaf curl, rose spring <b>dwarf,</b> <b>rose</b> little leaf, rose "frisure", rose bud proliferation and rose flower proliferation. Most of these disorders are characterized by stunting or dwarfing of plants accompanied by a partial wilt and dieback of shoots. Proliferation and epinasty often occurred. Apart from detected viruses (TSV. SLRSV) parts of degeneration syndrome have been transmitted by grafting other have failed to achieve any transmission of the causal agent. It seems likely that rose degeneration disorders in spite of symptom similarities are due to a complex of interacting factors including probably viruses...|$|E
40|$|Livestock: Livestock will browse baldhip rose plants, however {{browsing}} inhibits {{the spread}} of the plant, probably due to damage to the rhizomes from trampling (Zimmerman and Neuenschwander, 1984). Pollinators and Beneficial Insects: The primary insect pollinators of roses are pollen-gathering bees (Mader et al., 2011). The open-faced flowers of native roses are more attractive to pollinators than ornamental varieties with double flowers (Mader et al., 2011). Ethnobotanical: Baldhip rose was used for a variety of purposes by native people in the Pacific Northwest. The Okanagan-Colville and Thompson used the stems and branches to construct baby carriers and arrows. They made a decoction of the branches and leaves for a body and hair wash in sweat baths, as a wash for sore eyes, to soak fishing lines and nets for good luck, for hunters to remove human scent, and as a tea for protection from bad spirits, for general disposition, and a tonic. They also used a poultice of chewed leaves for treating bee stings, and smoked dried leaves with leaves from other plants. The rose hips were a minor source of food, and children played with them as beads. (Moerman, 2012). Interior Salish people also used <b>dwarf</b> <b>rose</b> for similar purposes (Parish et al., 1996). Hips of all wild roses are high in vitamin C and are made into jams, jellies, syrups and teas...|$|E
40|$|Bill Willingham’s Fables {{comic book}} series and its {{spin-offs}} have spanned fourteen years and reinforce that fairy-tale characters are culturally meaningful, adaptable, subversive, and pervasive. Willingham uses fairy-tale pastiche and syncreticism {{based on the}} ethos of comic book crossovers in his redeployment of previous approaches to fairy-tale characters. Fables characters are richer for every perspective that Willingham deploys, from the Brothers Grimm to Disneyesque aesthetics and more erotic, violent, and horrific incarnations. Willingham’s approach to these fairy-tale narratives is synthetic, idiosyncratic, and libertarian. This tension between Willingham’s subordination of fairy-tale characters to his overarching libertarian ideological narrative and the traditional folkloric identities drives the storytelling momentum of the Fables universe. Willingham’s portrayal of Bigby (the Big Bad Wolf turned private eye), Snow White (“Fairest of Them All”, Director of Operations of Fabletown, and avenger against pedophilic <b>dwarves),</b> <b>Rose</b> Red (Snow’s divergent, wild, and jealous sister), and Jack (narcissistic trickster) challenges contemporary assumptions about gender, heroism, narrative genres, and the very conception of a fairy tale. Emerging from negotiations with tradition and innovation are fairy-tale characters who defy constraints of folk and storybook narrative, mythology, and metafiction...|$|R
60|$|The top of {{the pass}} was broad, grassy, and bushy with <b>dwarf</b> Bamboo, <b>Rose,</b> and Berberry, in great abundance, covered with mosses and lichens: it had been raining hard all the morning, and the {{vegetation}} was coated with ice: a dense fog obscured everything, and a violent south-east wind blew over the pass in our teeth. I collected some very curious and beautiful mosses, putting these frozen treasures into my box, {{in the form of}} exquisitely beautiful glass ornaments, or mosses frosted with silver.|$|R
60|$|The soldier {{seemed to}} {{comprehend}} her--he dashed into the moat without hesitation, securing himself by catching at the boughs of trees as he descended. In one moment he vanished among the underwood; and in another, availing {{himself of the}} branches of a <b>dwarf</b> oak, <b>Rose</b> saw him upon her right, and close to the window of the fatal apartment. One fear remained--the casement might be secured against entrance from without--but no! at the thrust of the Norman it yielded, and its clasps or fastenings being worn with time, fell inward with a crash which even Dame Gillian's slumbers were unable to resist.|$|R
50|$|The {{vegetative}} {{world of}} Gobustan has a character that {{is common for}} deserts and semi-deserts. It consists of ephemeris grasses and bushes, wormwood and similar long-term plants. Among heaps of stones and rocks wild <b>rose,</b> <b>dwarf</b> cherries, honeysuckle, junipers, wild pears, wild figs, wild pomegranates, grapes and some other kinds of trees and bushes are rather often met decorating the stern landscape.|$|R
6000|$|... "So am I," [...] {{said the}} doctor, and passed on rather abruptly; he {{ran down the}} stone steps between the stone urns; and they saw him in talk with the woodcutter. They {{could not see the}} woodcutter's face. He stood with his back to them, but they saw {{something}} that seemed more moving than any change of countenance. The man's hand holding the ax rose high above his head, and for a flash it seemed as if he would have cut down the doctor. But in fact he was not looking at the doctor. His face was set toward the cliff, where, sheer out of the <b>dwarf</b> forest, <b>rose,</b> gigantic and gilded by the sun, the trees of pride.|$|R

Among her house plants she listed, not only oranges and lemons, but limes, oleander, <b>dwarf</b> myttle, <b>rose</b> {{geranium}} and chrysanthemum, observing that those would [...] "live {{in the garden}} through the winter though the first frost would destroy the flower." [...] Living, as she did, far from markets and major trade routes, Lady Skipwith also listed, for example, [...] "Bulbous roots to get when in my power[...] [...] [...] Meadow saffron a bulbous root {{about the size of}} a tulip, flowers in autumn and the leaves continue green all winter.

50|$|Plants do {{not have}} as vital of {{a part in the}} {{storytelling}} as seasons have. Some plants and trees are described in the stories that are found in Alaska’s wilds: birch (regular and <b>dwarf),</b> spruce, wild <b>roses,</b> as well as different kinds of bushes. The ice pack and the mountains are often described in story-telling because a large part of Alaska’s country is covered with them, making them a large influence on the Alaska Native peoples.|$|R
50|$|In the Blue Mountains {{at about}} 1050 m altitude, P. brownii grows in an upland prairie on basalt-substrate close to conifer stands. In {{addition}} {{to a variety of}} grasses, the surrounding vegetation includes western monkshood, Hooker's and arrowleaf balsamroot, redstem ceanothus, pinkfairies, hairy clematis, dwarf larkspur, parsnipflower buckwheat, fernleaf and nineleaf biscuitroot, sulphur lupine, beardtongues species, virgate scorpion-weed, sticky and slender cinquefoil, sagebrush buttercup, <b>dwarf</b> and Nootka <b>rose,</b> common snowberry, American vetch and northern mule's ears. Brown's peony avoids drought by dying down completely in early summer, after flowering and surviving underground with stores of nutrients and energy in its thick rootstock. When parts of the plant are broken, bruised or damaged by predation it produces a pronounced bitter and unpleasant scent. Plants are rarely eaten, but caterpillars of the species Euxoa ustula, dark grey fishia and small heliothodes moth have been found to eat 1-2 mm holes in the flowers, although these species are better known from other host plants. Flowers give off the same smell more weakly and the lobes of the disc secrete a sweet nectar with a bitter aftertaste over the entire time the stigmas and anthers are fertile.|$|R
5000|$|The opera {{is set in}} {{a mental}} hospital, with the {{patients}} acting out the tales, although some subsequent revivals have altered the setting. (See Background and performance history above.) The first scene, The Gold Key, {{is not one of the}} Grimms' fairy tales, although the title is an allusion to their story, The Golden Key. In both Sexton's original book and the opera, this poem introduces the sequence of re-told fairy tales to follow. As in the original book, each of the subsequent tales also has its own introduction and coda in which the poet comments to the audience on her perception of the significance of the story. Sexton and Susa selected nine of the original sixteen re-told tales for the opera. They are presented in the order in which they appeared in the original book. The first and last tales in the book (Snow White and the Seven <b>Dwarfs</b> and Briar <b>Rose)</b> remain the first and last tales in the opera. According to Susa, [...] "the poems are arranged with the author's approval to emphasize the sub-plot which concerns a middle-aged witch who gradually transforms into a vulnerable beauty slipping into a nightmare." [...] The opera's libretto sticks very closely (usually verbatim) to the wording in the poems. The comments below relate to some of the themes which critics have highlighted in each of Sexton's [...] "transformed" [...] tales.|$|R
