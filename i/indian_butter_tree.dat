50|$|Diploknema butyracea (Nepali:चिउरी, Chiuri), the <b>Indian</b> <b>butter</b> <b>tree,</b> is a {{multi purpose}} tree. The main {{product of the}} tree is ghee (butter), {{extracted}} from the seeds and named chiuri ghee or phulwara butter. D. butyracea is useful for block planting and also to be grown in the ravines of hills. The latex yielding plant such as D. butyracea suits to different edapho climatic conditions and thus does not compete with the traditional crops. It is a large tree of family Sapotaceae, flowers during cold season and fruit ripens in June-July. It commonly occurs in the sub Himalayan tract between 300-1500m from sea level.The chiuri tree has been utilised for many uses by rural households in Nepal. Ghee is used in daily cooking, as fuel for lamps, and body lotion; the fruit is eaten fresh and use for alcohol distillation, oil-cakes are utilised as manure, and the tree itself is used as firewood, etc. It has significant cultural and livelihood associations with the Chepang community (Nepali:चेपांग) of Nepal.This is not commercially farmed though. Recently bath soap using butter of Diploknema butyracea going to be popular. The fruit has creamy sweet taste with hint of condensed milk. The seed is oval shaped and produces aromatic oils which solidifies at normal room temperature.|$|E

40|$|Madhuca latifolia Macb. {{commonly}} known as <b>Indian</b> <b>butter</b> <b>tree,</b> is an open-pollinated plant. Improvement in seed and oil yields depends on the progress in the desired characters in the base material and the genetic variability available in the collected germplasm. We evaluated 23 genotypes of M. latifolia to understand genetic variability, character association and divergence in seed traits and oil content for use in breeding programs. Variation was recorded in seed length (27. 3 – 38. 6 mm), seed breadth (15. 6 – 19. 1 mm), two dimensional (2 D) surface area (328. 3 – 495. 4 mm 2), 100 seed weight (216. 8 – 285. 3 g), acid value (13. 4 – 25. 8 mg KOH/g), iodine number (62. 4 – 78. 6) and oil content (37. 8 – 51. 0 %). High estimates of genotypic coefficient of variation, broad sense heritability and genetic gain were observed for seed oil content. Variability studies for seed traits revealed that genotype CPT- 16 had the highest 100 -seed weight (281. 5 g) and oil content (51 %). Highly significant genotypic and phenotypic correlations were observed. The 100 -seed weight was positively and significantly correlated with oil content at both phenotypic (r = 0. 57) and genotypic (r = 0. 60) levels. Cluster analysis of the scores {{of the first three}} principle components (80. 83 %) resulted in four clusters, consisting of 4, 7, 3 and 9 genotypes in the first, second, third and fourth clusters, respectively. Cluster 3 was distinguished from others based on significantly higher means for most seed traits except seed breadth, acid value, iodine number and oil content. Cluster 1 appeared more divergent as it had significantly higher means for acid value and iodine number. A comparative assessment of means of the four clusters for 100 -seed weight and oil content suggested that cluster 3 would be useful for higher 100 -seed weight and oil content. Hence these genotypes, CPT- 3, CPT- 6 and CPT- 15 in cluster 3 can be used for direct selection and utilization in breeding programs...|$|E

Upon screening antimicrobial activities of plants used in traditional medicine, we found that a leaf dichloromethane extract from the shea <b>butter</b> <b>tree</b> (Vitellaria paradoxa) had antimicrobial activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) with further evidence of synergy when combined with β-lactams. Using HPLC-MS, we identified ursolic (UA) and oleanolic acids (OA) in leaves and twigs of this species, and quantified them by HPLC-UV as the major constituents in leaf extracts (21 % and 6 % respectively). Both pure triterpenic acids showed antimicrobial activity against reference and clinical strains of MRSA, with MICs ranging from 8 – 16 mg/L for UA to 32 – 128 mg/L for OA. They were highly synergistic with β-lactams (ampicillin and oxacillin) at subMIC concentrations. Reversion of MRSA phenotype was attributed to their capacity to delocalize PBP 2 from the septal division site, as observed by fluorescence microscopy, and to disturb thereby peptidoglycan synthesis. Moreover, both compounds also inhibited β-lactamases activity of living bacteria (as assessed by inhibition of nitrocefin hydrolysis), but not in bacterial lysates, suggesting an indirect mechanism for this inhibition. In a murine model of subcutaneous MRSA infection, local administration of UA was synergistic with nafcillin to reduce lesion size and inflammatory cytokine (IL- 1 β) production. Thus, these data highlight the potential interest of triterpenic acids as resistance reversing agents in combination with β-lactams against MRSA...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the variety of}} management practices for the <b>Butter</b> <b>tree</b> (locally called Chiuri) in Makawanpur district, Nepal. Chiuri is a highly valued multipurpose species which has been customarily used and managed by local communities on state forest lands and on unregistered and registered private lands. As {{a result of their}} high value of the trees to local people, in the early 1990 s the District Forest Officer issued tree certificates for the trees on state forest lands to their ancestral users. In addition to this pseudo-legitimisation of private access to and use of Chiuri trees on state forest lands, private tree tenure rights exist for (un) registered private lands. As a result of the specific tree tenure conditions, the local pattern of management practices for Chiuri is different from the usual tree management patterns under different land tenure regimes. Often, on state and community forest lands indigenous tree management practices are restricted to socially-oriented control measures on resource extraction, whereas on private lands biologically-oriented management practices may also take place. The most intensive tree management practices usually occur on well-established private lands. In contrast, the management practices for Chiuri trees on state forest lands involve both socially-oriented and biologically-oriented management practices and the tree management itself is more intensive on the unregistered than on the registered private lands. The Chiuri management practices {{have a positive effect on}} forest conservation, and so the example of Chiuri user certificates on state forest lands provides an interesting alternative to the Nepalese strategy of stimulating community management as a means of forest protection...|$|R

As for bush <b>butter</b> <b>tree</b> (Dacryodes edulis), there is some trade between Cameroon, Gabon and Congo. Transborder trade of NTFP is based on linguistic, cultural, environmental and monetary complementarities of the countries involved. This survey shows that the quantity of NTFP sold on export markets in the wet tropical forest zone of Cameroon is quite significant, and their value is assessed at 3. 099 million French francs in 1995 and 5. 033 million in 1996. This gives {{an indication of the}} importance of transborder trade between Cameroon and its neighbour countries, and the need to better assess the role of NTFP in diversification of exports. Profit margins of traders are higher for bush butter than for other NTFP. Main markets for bush butter fruit are New-Bell (Douala) and Mfoundi (Yaounde), where traders' margins are higher than the SMIG (guaranteed minimum wage). In addition, the survey shows that the merchants selling wild mango kernels in Abang-Minko border market (Gabon border) in 1995 and 1996 and in Kye-Ossi border market (Equatorial Guinea border) in 1996 also earned margins higher than the SMIG.

30|$|The recent {{declaration}} of list of drug resistant priority pathogens by WHO urging R&D {{to develop new}} antimicrobials, highlights {{the urgent need for}} addressing the issue of antimicrobial resistance. Incidentally as per World Health Organization (WHO) list, carbapenem resistant Enterobacteriaceae viz., Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli belongs to the high priority category, which requires urgent attention by researchers to develop new antimicrobial agents or resistance modulatory agents. Pentacyclic triterpenoids such as oleanolic acid and ursolic acid and their derivatives were discovered earlier as potential alternatives to antibiotics against a broad spectrum of pathogens (Wolska et al. 2010; Wang et al. 2016). Ursolic acid was shown to display anti-Mycobacterium tuberculosis activity and immune-stimulatory activity by decreasing the microbial load in TB induced mice. Ursolic acid derivatives were also reported earlier to inhibit multidrug resistant E. coli when used in combination with kanamycin (do Nascimento et al. 2014) and were also shown to inhibit acrAB mediated efflux of nalidixic acid in E. coli. Ursolic and oleanic acids were earlier reported to synergize with beta lactam antibiotics against gram positive pathogens S. aureus, S. epidermidis and Listeria monocytogenes (Kurek et al. 2012). In a recent interesting study, ursolic and oleanic acids present in dichloromethane extract of shea <b>butter</b> <b>tree</b> were shown to synergize with ampicillin and oxacillin against MRSA and cause reversion of MRSA phenotype which was attributed to delocalization of PBP 2 from the septal division site leading to disturbance in peptidoglycan synthesis, in addition the triterpenoids also caused indirect inhibition of β-lactamases and reversed β-lactam resistance in MRSA (Catteau et al. 2017). To the best of our knowledge, ursolic acid was not reported to interact synergistically with colistin in bacteria. We are reporting {{for the first time that}} ursolic acid can reverse colistin MIC in eight non replicate clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae viz., K. pneumoniae and E. coli.|$|R
40|$|For the {{successful}} cultivation of most undomesticated fruit trees such as shea <b>butter</b> <b>tree</b> (Vitellaria paradoxa C. F. Gaertn.), {{there is a}} need to identify their nutrient requirements and optimal growth conditions. Responses of shea seedlings to combined N and P fertilization, and to inoculation with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi was investigated. Six months old shea seedlings were transplanted into pots and grown for six months using a sterile nutrient-deficient soil. The seedlings were inoculated with the AM fungus Glomus intraradices Schenk & Smith. The fertilization treatments consisted of a factorial combination of three levels of N supplied as NH 4 NO 3 -N and P supplied as Ca(H 2 PO 4) 2. Fertilization stimulated plant height, collar diameter and dry weights (DWs) compared with non-fertilized treatments. These improvements were associated with an increase in total shoot N and C uptake (33 % increase) whereas P and K contents were not affected. There was significant N x P interaction on DWs and total shoot N and C contents, suggesting that seedling N responses were influenced by P rates. Consistent N responses in DWs, and total shoot N and C uptake were significant at the lowest P rate. P increases promoted growth and total shoot nutrient contents in low N-treated seedlings, while reducing growth in higher N rates. The combined application of medium and high rates of N and P fertilizers showed relatively low impact on seedling growth presumably because of suboptimal N:P ratios. Mycorrhizal root colonization was generally low (≤ 12 %) and was not affected by any of the treatments. There was also no response to inoculation with AM fungi probably because the established mycorrhizal association was ineffective. The potential use of both mineral fertilizers and AM fungi to promote growth performance of shea seedlings are discussed...|$|R
