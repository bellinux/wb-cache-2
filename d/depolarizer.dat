5|$|The {{invention}} of the Leclanché cell in 1866 and the subsequent improvement of the batteries containing manganese dioxide as cathodic <b>depolarizer</b> increased the demand of manganese dioxide. Until the development batteries with nickel-cadmium and lithium, most batteries contained manganese. The zinc-carbon battery and the alkaline battery normally use industrially produced manganese dioxide because natural occurring manganese dioxide contains impurities. In the 20th century, manganese dioxide was widely used as the cathodic for commercial disposable dry batteries of both the standard (zinc-carbon) and alkaline types.|$|E

2500|$|Natural light, {{and most}} other common sources of visible light, are incoherent: {{radiation}} is produced independently by {{a large number of}} atoms or molecules whose emissions are uncorrelated and generally of random polarizations. In this case the light is said to be unpolarized. This term is somewhat inexact, since at any instant of time at one location there is a definite direction to the electric and magnetic fields, however it implies that the polarization changes so quickly in time that it will not be measured or relevant to the outcome of an experiment. [...] A so-called <b>depolarizer</b> acts on a polarized beam to create one which is actually fully polarized at every point, but in which the polarization varies so rapidly across the beam that it may be ignored in the intended applications.|$|E

The electrochemical conversion of cathodic <b>depolarizers</b> at the cathode lowers the cell potential necessary to achieve a desired electrochemical conversion, such as ozone evolution, at the anode. When gaseous cathodic <b>depolarizers,</b> such as oxygen, are used, a gas diffusion cathode having the cation exchange membrane bonded thereto is preferred.

50|$|As {{with the}} Cornu <b>depolarizer,</b> {{there is some}} {{separation}} of the output {{as a function of}} polarization, as well as some beam deviation due to the imperfect match in refractive index between quartz and silica. The output is periodic across the <b>depolarizer.</b> Because the wedge angle is so much smaller than in a Cornu <b>depolarizer</b> the period is larger, often around 6 mm. This <b>depolarizer</b> also has a preferred orientation because of its single defined fast axis. In commercial wedge depolarizers this is usually marked.|$|E

The second component is made of fused silica, which has a very similar refractive index to quartz, but is not birefringent. The fast axis of the quartz element is generally at 45° to the wedge. The whole device is much more compact than a Cornu <b>depolarizer</b> (for the same aperture).|$|E
40|$|The {{introduction}} of neuromuscular blocking drugs revolu-tionized {{the practice of}} anaesthesia. Before the advent of muscle relaxants, anaesthesia was induced and maintained by intravenous or inhalation agents. Tracheal intubation was uncommon, and muscle relaxation if needed was secured by deep inhalation anaesthesia with its attendant risks of respiratory or cardiac depression. After the {{introduction of}} muscle relaxants, anaesthesia underwent a conceptual change. Anaesthesia was redefined as a triad of narcosis, analgesia and muscle relaxation, specific drugs being used to produce each of these effects 1.

40|$|The {{irradiance}} and polarization {{characteristics of}} quasi-monochromatic partially coherent electromagnetic beams are analyzed when they propagate after {{passing through a}} deterministic linear optical element, i. e., an optical element that can be represented by a Jones matrix. A class of such optical elements, which includes double-wedge <b>depolarizers</b> and polarization gratings, is defined and studied in detail. Analytical expressions are obtained for the case of double-wedge <b>depolarizers</b> and examples are given for an incident Gaussian Schell-model beam. For such an input beam, the effects on the irradiance and degree of polarization of the field propagating beyond the optical element are investigated in detail. A rich variety of behaviors is obtained by varying the beam size, coherence width and polarization state of the input field. The results not only provide a mathematical extension of well-known results to the domain of partial coherence, but they also exemplify mixing between coherence and polarization, which is, of course, not possible if, for example, fully spatially coherent fields are analyzed...|$|R

The reduction is diffusion-controlled and becomes irreversible at higher temperatures.
