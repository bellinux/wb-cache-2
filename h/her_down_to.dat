5|$|In {{promoting}} the series, both Piper and Eccleston stressed Rose's heroic characteristics whilst Davies highlighted <b>her</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> earth qualities and quintessential Britishness. Critical reaction {{noted that the}} character was more developed, independent and equal to the Doctor than previous companions had been, whilst the character's overall role in the narrative {{of the first two}} series was praised. However, reaction to the character's 2008 return was more mixed. Piper won numerous awards for her portrayal of Rose—including two National Television Awards—and since her initial role in the series, the character has ranked highly in numerous 'best companion' polls. After leaving as a series regular, Piper experienced success in other high-profile roles as an actress which has been partly attributed to her performances in Doctor Who.|$|E

5|$|After escaping, Cornfoot {{made her}} way to the village of Leuchars, eight miles from Pittenweem, where she was either {{discovered}} by the minister, George Gordon, or had approached him for help. For the reward of £10, he arranged an armed guard of two men to return her to Cowper's house on 30 January 1705. Cowper was not at home when they arrived so she was taken to one of the bailies. A mob of at least ten people forcibly removed her from the house, tied her up, beat her, then hauled <b>her</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the harbour by her ankles, possibly with the intention of dunking her. A rope was run from the top of the masthead on a ship back to the shore and she was dangled from it while the crowd threw stones at her as she swung backwards and forwards. When they took her down, she was covered by a door that had heavy stones placed on top of it until she was crushed to death. A cart pulled by a horse was guided over her corpse more than once to ensure she was dead. The crowd took her body to the home of her co-accused, Nicolas Lawson, with the intention of torturing her in the same manner but decided they had sufficient sport for the day.|$|E

25|$|Based on {{what little}} has survived of the account, {{it seems that}} the legend begins with the Kur abducting the goddess, Ereshkigal, and {{dragging}} <b>her</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the Netherworld. Enki sets out in a boat to attack the Kur and avenge the abduction of Ereshkigal. The Kur is described as defending itself using a storm of hailstones of all sizes and by attacking Enki using the waters beneath the boat. The account never actually tells who the winner of the fight is, but it can probably be assumed that Enki is the ultimate victor.|$|E

25|$|Alison is {{increasingly}} worried about Ben's lack {{of responsibility and}} commitment, and has doubts about the longevity of their relationship.

500|$|After {{the player}} either finds all the in-hiding Jedi Masters {{to discuss the}} Sith threat or kills them for vengeance, Kreia will retake her mantle as a Sith Lord. If the player does not kill the Jedi, she will {{intervene}} when they attempt to cut the Exile off from the Force, draining the Jedi of the Force herself and killing them.

Either way, she will leave, and the player must hunt <b>her</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> Malachor V, a planet and a site of great atrocities and death during a previous war, causing a wound in the Force.
