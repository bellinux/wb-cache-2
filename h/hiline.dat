2500|$|As {{the highway}} enters the Great Plains, {{specifically}} the northern High Plains, the first town it encounters is Browning, the largest settlement on the Blackfeet Indian Reservation. From {{here to the}} North Dakota border, the area surrounding to the highway is known as [...] "The Hi-Line" [...] to Montanans from the early Great Northern Railway route. The Hi-Line (also spelled Highline and <b>Hiline)</b> is one of around 50 folk regions in Montana. [...] It next travels through Cut Bank and Shelby, where it meets Interstate 15 and becomes the northern border of the area known as the [...] "Golden Triangle," [...] another folk region, in Montana. This area {{is one of the}} most agriculturally productive in the country. From Shelby it hits a string of small towns before it goes on to Havre, near the geographical center of the road in the state and the other northern apex of the Golden Triangle. Just south of Havre and off the highway about fifteen miles (24km) is the Rocky Boy Indian Reservation. The highway continues east to Malta, before which it travels through the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation. From Malta, the highway continues on to Glasgow, just north of Fort Peck Dam, and then into the Fort Peck Indian Reservation. The highway stays within the reservation for much of its remaining length through Montana. On the reservation it travels through Wolf Point and Poplar, and then exits the reservation a short distance before leaving the state. The final town of Bainville is the last major town on the highway as it leaves the state, near the confluence of the Missouri and Yellowstone Rivers.|$|E

40|$|AIM:To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} the <b>Hiline</b> rigid gas permeable contact lens(Hiline RGPCL) for keratoconus in clinical practice and the predictors for RGPCL fitting. METHODS:Fifty-seven eyes in 36 patients with keratoconus fitted with <b>Hiline</b> RGPCL were divided into three groups, mild(n = 10), moderate(n = 24) and advanced(n = 23) group. After fitting evaluation, visual acuity measurements were taken to compare the best corrected visual acuity wearing spectacle lenses and <b>Hiline</b> RGPCL. The predictors for RGPCL fitting by the corneal curvature were analyzed. RESULTS:In all groups, the application of <b>Hiline</b> RGPCL obtained acceptable vision. There was statistically significant improvement in vision with the <b>Hiline</b> RGPCL than that of with spectacle lenses in mild group(t =- 2. 968, P = 0. 016), moderate group(t =- 6. 293, P t =- 12. 792, P r = 0. 715, P = 0. 02). In moderate group, the base curve of RGPCL correlated with average K as well as 0. 2 mm steeper average K(r = 0. 495, P = 0. 014). In advanced group, the base curve of RGPCL correlated with every indicator, especially the corneal curvature in central area(r = 0. 802, P CONCLUSION:Guiding by corneal topography, improvement of visual acuity is successfully achieved by fitting with <b>Hiline</b> RGPCL. Selecting different predictors in different grades can reduce the complexity and improve the usefulness of the <b>Hiline</b> RGPCL in clinical practice...|$|E

40|$|AIM: To compare high {{resolution}} colonoscopy (Olympus Lucera) with a megapixel {{high resolution}} system (Pentax <b>HiLine)</b> as an in-service evaluation. METHODS: Polyp detection rates {{and measures of}} performance were collected for 269 colonoscopy procedures. Five colonoscopists conducted the study over a three month period, {{as part of the}} United Kingdom bowel cancer screening program. RESULTS:There were no differences in procedure duration (&#x 3 C 7; 2 P = 0. 98), caecal intubation rates (&#x 3 C 7; 2 P = 0. 67), or depth of sedation (&#x 3 C 7; 2 P = 0. 64). Mild discomfort was more common in the Pentax group (&#x 3 C 7; 2 P = 0. 036). Adenoma detection rate was significantly higher in the Pentax group (&#x 3 C 7; 2 test for trend P = 0. 01). Most of the extra polyps detected were flat or sessile adenomas. CONCLUSION: Megapixel definition colonoscopes improve adenoma detection without compromising other measures of endoscope performance. Increased polyp detection rates may improve future outcomes in bowel cancer screening programs...|$|E
40|$|Background: Orthokeratology is the {{programmed}} {{application of}} rigid gas-permeable contact lenses for the temporary reduction of myopia. New reverse geometry contact lens designs and materials {{have led to}} a renewed interest in this fi eld. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate effi cacy and safety profi les of the <b>Hiline</b> orthokeratology contact lens in the temporary reduction of myopia when worn overnight. Methods: Eighty-two myopic subjects (161 eyes; 22 males and 59 females; mean age, 26. 5 years, range 12 to 47 years) were recruited from the Tri-Service General Hospital and the Mackay Memorial Hospital. Subjects received a 36 -week trial of overnight orthokeratology using reverse geometry rigid contact lenses (using Boston Equalens II (oprifocon A) lens material by DreamLens Inc.). The oxygen permeability was 85 by ISO/Fatt and each subject underwent a 4 -week follow-up period after discontinuing wearing the lenses. After com-mencing lens wear, subjects were examined on day 1, weeks 1, 2, 4, 12, 24, and 36, and days 1, 7, and 28 after a fi nal evaluation. Visual acuity was checked with the Snellen chart: autorefraction by the Nikon autokeratometer; corneal topog-raphy and corneal thickness with the Orbscan II; and slit-lamp examinations were performed to check the corneal condi...|$|E
40|$|We present 21 -cm <b>Hiline</b> and 408 MHz and 1. 4 GHz {{continuum}} {{observations of}} the Magellanic dwarf galaxy UGCA 86, made with the DRAO synthesis telescope. UGCA 86 is detected in the continuum at both frequencies, with 408 MHz flux density S 408 = 120 ± 30 mJy and 1. 4 GHz flux density S 1400 = 79 ± 3 mJy. The Hi structure of UGCA 86 is complex, with two separate components: a rotating disk and a highly elongated spur that is kinematically disjunct from the disk. The Hi disk is centered on the optical galaxy with similar axial ratio and orientation of the major axis. An area of the disk with a peculiar velocity of ∼ 25 km s − 1 relative to the regular rotation of the disk is found on the southern side, {{where most of the}} star formation is concentrated. The spur is seen along the minor axis of UGCA 86 and overlaps in part with the disk. Towards the– 2 – optical center of UGCA 86, the velocity difference between the spur and the disk is 40 km s − 1, about one third of the rotation velocity of the Hidisk at 6 kpc from the center. This implies a large radial component of the orbital velocity of th...|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{compare the}} {{performance}} characteristics of Pentax <b>HiLine</b> (PHL) (with i-scan) and Olympus Lucera (OL) systems in a screening population. METHODS: Screening colonoscopies in asymptomatic guaiac faecal occult blood test-positive patients with PHL (n = 58) and OL (n = 425) colonoscopes were analysed. All procedures were {{performed by a}} single colonoscopist. PHL used white-light endoscopy (WLE) on scope insertion and contrast/surface enhancement (i-scan 1) on withdrawal, and OL utilised WLE both on insertion and withdrawal. Patient age, sex, instrument insertion and withdrawal times, nurse assessed patient comfort scores, midazolam and fentanyl doses, procedure completion and rates of lesion detection were recorded separately for each group. Comparisons between the groups were made using either Fisher&#x 2019;s exact test (for dichotomous variables) or Mann-Whitney U test (for ordinal and continuous variables). RESULTS: Colonoscopy completion rates were similar in both groups: 413 / 425 (97. 2 %) for OL and 55 / 58 (94. 9 %) for PHL (P = 0. 24). For complete colonoscopies, {{the two groups were}} well matched for age, sex, colonoscope insertion times (mean 11. 1 min in OL vs 11. 6 min in PHL, P = 0. 93) and normal colonoscopy withdrawal times (mean 15. 6 min in OL vs 14. 7 min in PHL, P = 0. 2). Patients in the PHL group experienced a small increase in discomfort (mean patient comfort scores were 0. 49 in the OL and 0. 95 in the PHL group, P < 0. 0001). While Fentanyl doses required were similar between groups (mean 57. 5 &#x 3 BC;g in OL vs 61. 4 &#x 3 BC;g in PHL, P = 0. 13), slightly more Midazolam was required in the PHL group (mean 2. 1 mg in OL vs 2. 4 mg in PHL, P = 0. 035). There was no difference in polyp (58 % in OL vs 67 % in PHL) or adenoma (49 % in OL vs 56 % in PHL) detection rates between the groups. Neither the total number of polyps and adenomas, nor the characteristics of these (including size, location or presence of advanced features) were different between the two systems. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that there is no advantage of either colonoscope system in lesion detection...|$|E
