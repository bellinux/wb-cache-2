5|$|From late August 1869 to May the {{following}} year, Levski {{was active in}} the Romanian capital Bucharest. He was in contact with revolutionary writer and journalist Lyuben Karavelov, whose participation in the foundation of the Bulgarian Literary Society Levski approved in writing. Karavelov's publications gathered a number of followers and initiated the foundation of the Bulgarian Revolutionary Central Committee (BRCC), a centralised revolutionary <b>diasporic</b> organisation that included Levski as a founding member and statute drafter. In disagreement over planning, Levski departed from Bucharest in the spring of 1870 and began to put into action his concept of an internal revolutionary network.|$|E
5|$|Individuals {{obtained}} IRO {{membership in}} secrecy: the initiation ritual involved a formal {{oath of allegiance}} over the Gospel or a Christian cross, a gun and a knife; treason was punishable by death, and secret police monitored each member's activities. Through clandestine channels of reliable people, relations were maintained with the revolutionary <b>diasporic</b> community. The internal correspondence employed encryption, conventional signs, and fake personal and committee names. Although Levski himself headed the organisation, he shared administrative responsibilities with assistants such as monk-turned-revolutionary Matey Preobrazhenski, the adventurous Dimitar Obshti, and the young Angel Kanchev.|$|E
5|$|Apocryphal and semi-legendary anecdotal stories {{surround}} {{the creation of}} Levski's Internal Revolutionary Organisation. Persecuted by the Ottoman authorities who offered 500 Turkish liras for his death and 1000 for his capture, Levski resorted to disguises to evade arrest during his travels. For example, he {{is known to have}} dyed his hair and to have worn a variety of national costumes. In the autumn of 1871, Levski and Angel Kanchev published the Instruction of the Workers for the Liberation of the Bulgarian People, a BRCC draft statute containing ideological, organisational and penal sections. It was sent out to the local committees and to the <b>diasporic</b> community for discussion. The political and organisational experience that Levski amassed is evident in his correspondence dating from 1871 to 1872; at the time, his views on the revolution had clearly matured.|$|E

25|$|The current Iranian-Armenian {{population}} is somewhere around 500,000. They mostly live in Tehran and Jolfa district. After the Iranian Revolution, many Armenians immigrated to Armenian <b>diasporic</b> communities in North America and western Europe. Today the Armenians are Iran's largest Christian religious minority, followed by Assyrians.|$|E
25|$|Santería and Candomblé are syncretic {{religions}} {{derived from}} Yoruba <b>diasporic</b> beliefs and catholicism, most prevalent in South Americas, including Cuba and Brazil. Their mythologies have many similarities {{to that of}} Yoruba, and contains a pantheon of Oríshas (spirits), comparable to (and often identified with) the lwa of Voodoo.|$|E
25|$|<b>Diasporic</b> Africans in the Americas {{have been}} experimenting with ways to style their hair since their arrival in the Western Hemisphere well before the 19th century. During the {{approximately}} 400years of the Trans-Atlantic slave trade, which extracted over 20million people from West and Central Africa, their beauty ideals have undergone numerous changes.|$|E
25|$|As {{mostly a}} <b>diasporic</b> {{language}}, {{and as a}} language {{that is not an}} official language of any state, Western Armenian faces extinction as its native speakers lose fluency in Western Armenian amid pressures to assimilate into their host countries. Estimates place the number of fluent speakers of Western Armenian outside Armenia and Georgia at less than one million.|$|E
25|$|Many African female <b>diasporic</b> {{artists have}} criticized the {{traditional}} iconography of Baartman. According to the studies of contemporary feminists, traditional iconography and historical illustrations of Baartman are effective in revealing the ideological representation of black women in art throughout history. Such studies assess how the traditional iconography of the black female body was institutionally and scientifically defined in the nineteenth century.|$|E
25|$|The tumah and taharah {{component}} of niddah, essentially the avoiding {{of contact with}} the midras of the niddah, was encouraged - but not made mandatory - by various Rabbinic authorities as a remembrance and retention for <b>diasporic</b> Jewry as to not forget the laws of tumah and taharah. The extent of Rabbinic encouragement was only for the seven-day period of actual menstruation and not the five-day Rabbinic extension period.|$|E
25|$|The Hakkas {{are thought}} to have {{originated}} from the lands bordering the Yellow River (the modern northern Chinese provinces of Shanxi, Henan, and Hubei). In a series of migrations, the Hakkas moved and settled in their present areas in Southern China, and from there, substantial numbers migrated overseas to various countries throughout the world. As the most <b>diasporic</b> among the Chinese community groups, the worldwide population of Hakkas is about 80 million.|$|E
25|$|After {{twelve years}} abroad {{pursuing}} higher education, developing his political philosophy, and organizing with other <b>diasporic</b> pan-Africanists, Nkrumah returned to Gold Coast {{to begin his}} political career as an advocate of national independence. He formed the Convention People's Party, which achieved rapid success through its unprecedented appeal to the common voter. He became prime minister in 1952 and retained this position when Britain declared Ghana independent in 1957. In 1960, Ghanaians approved a new constitution and elected Nkrumah president.|$|E
25|$|An {{estimated}} 80% of Xinjiang's Uyghurs live in {{the southwestern}} portion of the region, the Tarim Basin. Outside Xinjiang, the largest community of Uyghurs in China is in Taoyuan County, in south-central Hunan. Outside of China, significant <b>diasporic</b> communities of Uyghurs exist in the Central Asian countries of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan, and in Turkey. Smaller communities are found in Afghanistan, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Australia, Canada, and the United States.|$|E
25|$|Religions {{with less}} {{numerous}} adherents {{can also be}} found. There is Buddhism in Chinatown, and Caribbean and African traditional religions in North and West Philadelphia. These numbers are also growing. Historically the city has strong connections to The Religious Society of Friends, Unitarian Universalism, and Ethical Culture, all of which continue to be represented in the city. The Friends General Conference is based in Philadelphia. African <b>diasporic</b> religions are popular in Hispanic and Caribbean communities in North and West Philadelphia.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time in 1994, the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), mostly made up of <b>diasporic</b> Tutsi in Uganda, {{advanced}} to Rwanda. It had experience in organized irregular warfare from the Ugandan Bush War, and got much support from the government of Uganda. The initial RPF advance was halted by the lift of French arms to the Rwandan government. Attempts at peace culminated in the Arusha Accords. The agreement broke down after the assassination of the Rwandan and Burundian Presidents. Victorious {{in the aftermath of the}} genocide, the RPF came to power in July 1994.|$|E
25|$|The {{structure}} of Rastafari groups is less {{like those of}} Christian denominations and is instead akin to the cellular {{structure of}} other African <b>diasporic</b> traditions like Haitian Vodou, Cuban Santeria, and Jamaica's Revival Zion. Since the 1970s, there have been attempts to fashion a pan-Rasta unity movement, namely through {{the establishment of the}} Rastafari Movement Association, which sought political mobilisation. In 1982, the first international assembly of Rastafari groups took place in Toronto, Canada. This and subsequent international conferences, assemblies, and workshops have helped to cement global networks and cultivate an international community of Rasta practitioners.|$|E
25|$|Alexander conquered Judah in 332BCE, {{beginning}} {{the period of}} Hellenistic domination. During the Hellenistic period Judea became independent under the Hasmoneans, but later the Romans ended their independence, making Herod the Great their governor. One Jewish revolt against the Romans led {{to the destruction of}} the Second Temple in 70CE, and the second Bar-Kochba revolt in 132–135 CE led to a large departure of the Jewish population of Judea. Biblical Hebrew after the Second Temple period evolved into Mishnaic Hebrew, which ceased being spoken and developed into a literary language around 200 CE. Hebrew remained in widespread use among <b>diasporic</b> communities as the medium of writing and liturgy, forming a vast corpus of literature which includes rabbinic, medieval, and modern literature prior to the revival of Hebrew as a spoken language.|$|E
25|$|Some Pan-Africanists also {{consider}} other peoples as <b>diasporic</b> African peoples. These groups include, among others, Negritos, {{such as in}} the case of the peoples of the Malay Peninsula (Orang Asli); New Guinea (Papuans); Andamanese; certain peoples of the Indian subcontinent, and the aboriginal peoples of Melanesia and Micronesia. Most of these claims are rejected by mainstream ethnologists as pseudoscience and pseudoanthropology, as part of ideologically motivated Afrocentrist irredentism, touted primarily among some extremist elements in the United States who do not reflect on the mainstream African-American community. Mainstream anthropologists determine that the Andamanese and others are part of a network of authothonous ethnic groups present in South Asia that trace their genetic ancestry to a migratory sequence that culminated in the Australian aboriginals rather than from Africa directly.|$|E
25|$|This {{means that}} the {{population}} living in the Lusophone official area is around 280,000,000 inhabitants. This number {{does not include the}} Lusophone diaspora, estimated at approximately 10 million people (including 4.5 million Portuguese, 3 million Brazilians, and half a million Cape Verdeans, among others), although it is hard to obtain official accurate numbers of <b>diasporic</b> Portuguese speakers because a significant portion of these citizens are naturalized citizens born outside of Lusophone territory or are children of immigrants, and may have only a basic command of the language. It is also important to note that {{a large part of the}} diaspora is a part of the already-counted population of the Portuguese-speaking countries and territories, such as the high number of Brazilian and PALOP emigrant citizens in Portugal or the high number of Portuguese emigrant citizens in the PALOP and Brazil.|$|E
25|$|Aside from Christianity, Islam, and Judaism, {{there are}} also African Americans who follow Buddhism {{and a number of}} other religions. There is a small but growing number of African Americans who {{participate}} in African traditional religions, such as West African Vodun, Santería, Ifá and <b>diasporic</b> traditions like the Rastafari movement. Many of them are immigrants or descendants of immigrants from the Caribbean and South America, where these are practiced. Because of religious practices, such as animal sacrifice, which are no longer common among the larger American religions, these groups may be viewed negatively and are sometimes the victims of harassment. It must be stated, however, that since the Supreme Court judgement that was given to the Lukumi Babaluaye church of Florida in 1993, there has been no major legal challenge to their right to function as they see fit.|$|E
25|$|More recently, Persian {{has become}} {{just one of}} many Iranian blog languages. English in {{particular}} is used. This is both because it is a relatively well known second language due to high education levels, and to expose the outside world to the goings on in Iran. Several influential bloggers made a plea to other bloggers to use this medium to increase international outrage at the Iranian regime. It also seeks to provide a lens from which to see the Iranian people as separate from their repressive government. Additionally, many blogs being read are written abroad by <b>diasporic</b> communities of Iranians throughout the globe. Many of their families left during the Brain-drain following the Islamic revolution in 1979 and after, creating a dedicated politically motivated and educated author base. These people use their native or adopted languages in addition to Persian.|$|E
25|$|The {{heterogeneous}} {{nature of}} culture in Israel is also manifested in Israeli cuisine, a diverse combination of local ingredients and dishes, with <b>diasporic</b> dishes from around the world. An Israeli fusion cuisine has developed, with the adoption and continued adaption of elements of various Jewish styles of cuisine including Mizrahi, Sephardic, Yemeni Jewish and Ashkenazi, and many foods traditionally eaten in the Middle East. Israeli cuisine is also influenced by geography, giving prominence to foods common in the Mediterranean region such as olives, chickpeas, dairy products, fish, and fresh fruits and vegetables. The main meal is usually lunch rather than dinner. Jewish holidays influence the cuisine, with many traditional foods served at holiday times. Shabbat dinner, eaten on Friday night, is a significant meal in {{a large proportion of}} Israeli homes. While not all Jews in Israel keep kosher, the observance of kashrut influences the menu in homes, public institutions and many restaurants.|$|E

500|$|Jacqueline Stefanko rationalizes Alvarez’s {{decision}} to alternate amongst the varying voices {{of all four}} García girls, wither her assertion that [...] "the amnesia produced by the <b>diasporic</b> cultures of Latinas gets negotiated within the text through polyphony". After significant observation, Stefanko has concluded that [...] "as hybrid selves who cross and recross borders of language and culture, these Latina writers create hybrid texts in order to 'survive in diaspora,' to use Donna Haraway's term, seeking to heal the fractures and ruptures resulting from exile and dispersal". Through her creation of How the García Girls Lost Their Accents Alvarez has intentionally fictionalized her own life story in a polyphonous manner which extends {{beyond the boundaries of}} traditional style and genre, thus setting herself apart from the average author both stylistically and structurally.|$|E
500|$|After {{two years}} in London, 1:54 held a pop-up show, 1:54 NY, at the Red Hook art venue Pioneer Works during the May 2015 Frieze New York. Kouoh {{returned}} to lead a forum on present and future ideas of African <b>diasporic</b> identities and practices, and RA Projects, who had previously worked with 1:54, returned to design the New York exhibit. The show used a standard gallery layout as the open, industrial space was divided into white-walled booths. Sixteen international galleries participated—most were from American and European countries, apart from five South African galleries and one each from Côte d'Ivoire, Morocco, and Nigeria. Exhibited artists were from African nations and the African diaspora, living in other Western countries. They included William Kentridge, Malick Sidibé, Seydou Keïta, Peter Clarke, Lavar Munroe, Billie Zangewa, and Omar Victor Diop. Particularly due to the New York event's smaller size, 1:54's founder said that they tried to show the most exciting artists and exhibitors rather than show {{a survey of the}} 54 countries. The expansion into New York was a [...] "natural progression" [...] for the fair, based on their existing institutional relationships. It also expanded the fair's scope into American and African American art professionals, and the American art market—the show's foremost focus was bringing new artists to New York patronage. The event was planned in six months. 1:54 held a second New York show in 2016 with 17 galleries, including five based in Africa, and a partnership with the Dakar Biennale. Dartmouth's Hood Museum of Art purchased Eric Van Hove's Testosterone installation. Compared to the London event, 1:54 NY is smaller and designed to be more intimate, with an active community and different audience, although the two shows are not significantly different.|$|E

2500|$|These two dissenting {{understandings}} of hip hop's scope and influence frame debates that revolve around hip hop's possession of {{or lack of}} authenticity. Anticipating the market arguments of Tate and others, both Gilroy and Weheliye assert that hip hop {{has always had a}} different function than Western popular music as a whole, a function that exceeds the constraints of market capitalism. Weheliye notes, [...] "Popular music, generally in the form of recordings, has and still continues to function as one of the main channels of communication between the different geographical and cultural points in the African diaspora, allowing artists to articulate and perform their <b>diasporic</b> citizenship to international audiences and establish conversations with other <b>diasporic</b> communities." [...] For Paul Gilroy, hip hop proves an outlet of articulation and a sonic space in which African Americans can exert control and influence that they often lack in other sociopolitical and economic domains.|$|E
