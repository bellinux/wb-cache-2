The input {{impedance}} of the amplifier is regarded as so high that the current drawn by the input is neglected.The capacitor is connected between the negative input terminal of the amplifier and its output terminal. With this connection it provides a negative feedback path around the amplifier. The input voltage change {{is equal to the}} output voltage change divided by the amplifier gain. With very high amplifier gain the change in input voltage can be neglected and so the input voltage is held close to the voltage on the positive input terminal which in this case is held at 0V. Because the voltage at the input terminal is 0V the voltage across R is simply Vin so that the current into the capacitor is the input voltage divided by the resistance of R.|$|E

The primary coil of a transformer {{is connected to the}} battery by a transistor switch. In the first period of operation of this voltage source, the energy is stored in the magnetic field of transformer’s inductance. In the second period, the energy is delivered to the output voltage source. Energy is delivered from the secondary transformer’s coil to the output capacitor through a diode. As a rule, one separate voltage source has a small power, that is why one <b>impulse</b> <b>voltage</b> source can have the necessary number of isolated output voltage sources, i. e., 3, 6, 9, 12, etc So, we can design an impulse DC to DC voltage source with multiple isolated output voltage sources.

Streamer inception characteristics under DC voltage have been studied by many researchers, but the inception characteristics under <b>impulse</b> <b>voltage,</b> and particularly under lightning <b>impulse</b> <b>voltage</b> with a high voltage rise rate have rarely been studied. A measurement system based on integrated optoelectronic technology has been proposed in this paper, and the streamer inception characteristics in a 1 -m-long rod-plane air gap that was energized by a positive lightning <b>impulse</b> <b>voltage</b> have been researched.
