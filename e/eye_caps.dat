25|$|Eye {{tracking}} device {{is a tool}} created to help measure eye and head movements. The first devices for tracking eye movement took two main forms: those that relied on a mechanical connection between participant and recording instrument, and those in which light or some other form of electromagnetic energy was directed at the participant's eyes and its reflection measured and recorded. In 1883, Lamare {{was the first to}} use a mechanical connection, by placing a blunt needle on the participant's upper eyelid. The needle picked up the sound produced by each saccade and transmitted it as a faint clicking to the experimenter's ear through an amplifying membrane and a rubber tube. The rationale behind this device was that saccades are easier to perceive and register aurally than visually. In 1889, Edmund B. Delabarre invented a system of recording eye movement directly onto a rotating drum by means of a stylus with a direct mechanical connection to the cornea. Other devices involving physical contact with the surface of the eyes were developed and used {{from the end of the}} 19th century until the late 1920s; these included such items as rubber balloons and <b>eye</b> <b>caps.</b>|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} study, pigeons were trained under {{binocular}} conditions in a conditional visual discrimination {{in which they}} were faced with two identical patterns arranged one above the other. In half of these stimulus pairs the animals had to peck the upper pattern, in the other half the lower one. Although only six pairs of stimuli were used, only four out of eight birds reached learning criterion. These animals needed up to 6 months of training with 3050 to 6650 trails. Then, the experiment proceeded under identical conditions using <b>eye</b> <b>caps</b> restricting vision alternatively to the left or the right eye. These monocular tests revealed that three out of four birds virtually had no knowledge of the task contingencies using their left eye (right hemisphere). Again, several thousand trials were needed to train the birds to criterion with their left eye, while they were simultaneously discriminating at a very high level with their right. These results show that memories on task contingencies are stored unihemispherically in the visually dominant left side despite extensive training with both eyes open. Additionally, it can be concluded that the subsequent read-out by the ‘naive’ hemisphere can be largely restricted, resulting in a ‘natural split-brain ’ like situation in birds. It is speculated that the absence of a corpus callosum in birds restricts interhemispheric transfer of information. # 2002 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|In the 1950 ’s in the U. S. A. and the U. K. colour filters were seldom used by {{amateur astronomers}} {{and those that}} were, were mostly war surplus that seldom fitted the eyepieces then in use. This was {{surprising}} as Zeiss sold colour filter revolvers in the 1920 ’s and 30 ’s and Zeiss was well established in both the U. S. A. and the U. K. before WWII. What filters were in use in the UK comprised sun and moon <b>eye</b> <b>caps,</b> as had been used {{for well over a}} century. All this changed in the late 50 ’s and early 60 ’s, when the late Charles Capen published a number of articles on filters. Capen was a professional astronomer who pioneered colour filter useage and who subsequently became A. L. P. O. Mars Recorder. The first firm in the U. S. A. to sell filters on a regular basis was Optica b/c in California. The company offered, in screw mounts, both dyed-in-the-mass glass or gelatine filters. In the UK the firm Hellma, in Westcliffe-on-Sea, Essex, offered sandwiched gelatine filters. Transmissions were based on the Kodak Wratten series, and included 58; 47 B; 25 A; 23 A; 21 : 15; 11; and a few others. Few manufacturers followed suit, though surplus filters were always available from firms like Edmund Scientific. Here in the UK, the Milton based company UQG (ref 7) has offered Schott series dyed-in-the-mass filters for over 30 years. By the 1970 ’s, colour filters became more popular.

50|$|The {{invention}} of the percussion cap building on the percussion powder innovations of the Rev. Alexander Forsyth's patent of 1807 (which ran until 1821), and the industrial revolution allowed pepperbox revolvers to be mass-produced, making them more affordable than the early handmade guns previously only seen {{in the hands of}} the rich. The {{invention of}} the percussion cap has been variously attributed to several Englishmen including Joseph Egg, Col. Peter Hawker, James Purdey and Joshua Shaw in the late 1810s and early 1820s. The uncertainty has been compounded because no British patent was awarded while the use of fulminating salts for priming guns was protected by Forsyth's earlier patent. Some French makers attempted to patent the idea including Prelat in 1818 and Deboubert in 1820. Examples of these early weapons are the English Budding (probably the first English percussion pepperbox), the Swedish Engholm and the American three-barrel Manhattan pistol. Most percussion pepperboxes have a circular flange around the rear of the cylinder to prevent the capped nipples being accidentally fired if the gun were to be knocked while in a pocket, or dropped, and to protect the <b>eyes</b> from <b>cap</b> fragments.|$|R

ABSTRACT: This work uses a method that enhances the performance of glassy carbon electrode (GCE) for the determination of chloramphenicol (CAP). The electrochemical properties of chloramphenicol at electrochemically pretreated glassy carbon electrode were studied using cyclic voltammeter (CV). Electrochemical pretreatment of the electrode greatly enhanced the reduction peak current (Ip) of CAP. CAP shows an irreversible reduction peak at- 0. 674 V vs. Ag/AgCl at the GCE in 0. 05 M acetate buffer of pH 5. Detailed experiments were carried out to establish the electrochemical property, the optimal buffer and its pH, electrode pretreatment potential, scan rate dependence study and effect of concentration. Following optimization pH of buffer solution, the peak current response for the reduction of CAP shows an enhanced response, 2. 0 {{times greater than the}} bare GCE.

We aimed {{to assess the}} effectiveness of infection control measures among healthcare workers (HCWs) {{who were exposed to}} a MERS patient and/or his body fluids in our institute. Methods A descriptive study was conducted among HCWs who worked with a MERS patient in Bamrasnaradura Infectious Diseases Institute, Thailand, between 18 June and 3 July 2015. Contacts were defined as HCWs who worked in the patient’s room or with the patient’s body fluids. Serum samples from all contacts were collected within 14  days of last contact and one month later. Paired sera were tested for detection of MERS‐CoV antibodies by using an indirect ELISA. Results Thirty-eight (88. 4  %) of 43 identified contacts consented to enroll. The mean (SD) age was 38. 1 (11. 1) years, and 79  % were females. The median (IQR) cumulative duration of work of HCWs in the patient’s room was 35 (20 – 165) minutes. The median (IQR) cumulative duration of work of HCWs with the patient’s blood or body fluids in laboratory was 67. 5 (43. 7 – 117. 5) minutes. All contacts reported 100  % compliance with hand hygiene, using N 95 respirator, performing respirator fit test, wearing gown, gloves, <b>eye</b> protection, and <b>cap</b> during their entire working period. All serum specimens of contacts tested for MERS-CoV antibodies were negative. Conclusions We provide evidence of effective infection control practices against MERS-CoV transmission in a healthcare facility. Strict infection control precautions can protect HCWs. The optimal infection control measures for MERS-CoV should be further evaluated...|$|R

Governor Bricker joined CAP in May 1942, as did Congressman John M. Vorys, himself a World War I naval aviator and former director of the Ohio Bureau of Aeronautics. By July 1942, the wing numbered 3,282 men and women organized in nine groups and 39 squadrons, making the Ohio Wing the third largest CAP wing in the nation; over 4,200 members served in the Ohio Wing by 31 October 1942. Ohio squadrons undertook a variety of missions on behalf of the war effort. The wing conducted statewide searches for scrap metal in response to OCD scrap drives for metal, tires, and other resources, saving countless hour of ground searches and locating well over a quarter million pounds of scrap metal. CAP squadrons also maintained constant aerial patrol over the state’s valuable timber resources. The eagle <b>eyes</b> of Ohio <b>CAP</b> members prevented large forest fires from erupting in 1942. CAP personnel provided further surveillance of coal, oil, and gas resources in the state vital to the war effort and defense industries. Ohio wing members in 1943 volunteered to patrol flood-stricken areas across the state, radioing flood information to state and local authorities on the ground to help in responding to the emergencies. Other Ohio wing members served as aerial couriers during the war. The small light aircraft of CAP could ferry supplies vital for war effort into areas and through conditions when no other options remained viable.|$|R

The dawn of day brought little change; for no other horizon became visible than the little circle of drizzling sky and water already described, in which {{it seemed as if the}} elements were rioting in a sort of chaotic confusion. During this time the crew and passengers of the cutter were of necessity passive. Jasper and the pilot remained below; but, the motion of the vessel having become easier, nearly all the rest were on deck. The morning meal had been taken in silence, and eye met eye, as if their owners asked each other, in dumb show, what was to be the end of this strife in the elements. Cap, however, was perfectly composed, and his face brightened, his step grew firmer, and his whole air more assured, as the storm increased, making larger demands on his professional skill and personal spirit. He stood on the forecastle, his arms crossed, balancing his body with a seaman's instinct, while his <b>eyes</b> watched the <b>caps</b> of the seas, as they broke and glanced past the reeling cutter, itself in such swift motion, as if they were the scud flying athwart the sky. At this sublime instant one of the hands gave the unexpected cry of [...] "A sail!" ...|$|R
40|$|Richmond Ltd. has {{recently}} undergone {{a change in}} strategy, away from the traditional commodity based meat industry, towards the modern food business. To do this, opportunities to add value to their current product range must be identified. This involves the conversion of traditionally low value commodity based products into products that demand a premium. An {{example of this is}} converting muscles that are currently used for grinding meat into a further processed convenience food (i. e. ready meals). Another method is to add further value to premium products by making them more appealing to consumers (i. e. nutritional information on labels). This work details investigations into the functional properties of selected beef forequarter muscles (low value commodity products) and the nutritional properties of selected export lamb products (premium products). The functional properties of a number of beef forequarter muscles were measured to identify which had the best potential for further processing applications with respect to ready meals. The functional properties of tenderness, cook loss and shrinkage were measured for the Latissimus Dorsi, Pectorialis Profundus (Point End Brisket), Infraspinatus (Cross Cut Blade), Triceps Brachi Longhead (Main muscle in Bolar Shoulder Clod), Supraspinatus (Chuck Tender), Serratus Ventralis and Triceps Brachi Medialhead (Muscle in Bolar Shoulder Clod. From the tests conducted the Infraspinatus and the Triceps Brachi Longhead have been identified as having the best functional properties with respect to further processing for ready meal applications. As well as conducting tests to identify the forequarter muscles with the best potential for further processing applications, investigations were carried out to identify cooking regimes that would optimise the functional properties. This work confirmed that there are three major chemical reactions, which determine the resultant functional properties of cooked meat. They are the denaturation and aggregation of the myofibrillar proteins and the denaturation and solubilisation of connective tissue (collagen). At around 50 °C myosin (45 % to 50 % of the myofibrillar proteins) denatures, which results in a substantial increase in cook loss and reduction in water holding capacity. At around 60 °C collagen (main connective tissue protein) denatures, which results in a substantial increase in tenderness and increase in cook loss. This is because as the collagen denatures it loses it mechanical strength (increase in tenderness) and can no longer support its own structure, and causes it to contract. This contraction causes fluid within the meat and cook loss caused by the denaturation of myosin to be expelled from the meat by compressive forces (squeezed out). At around 70 °C actomyosin (22 % of the myofibrillar proteins) denatures. This results in a substantial increase in the cook loss and firming of the meat. The increase in cook loss or decrease in water holding capacity that occurs with myofibrillar protein denaturation {{is due to the fact}} that when these proteins denature and aggregate their ability to bind water is greatly reduced. From the results of the cooking regime trials it is recommended that for functional property considerations that during the cooking of further processed meat products (i. e. ready meal applications) a meat temperature of 62 °C should be aimed for, for the slowest heating region during cooking (usually the centre). This is because it has been identified that a cooking temperature of 65 °C should not be exceeded otherwise detrimental effects can occur to the functional properties of the cooked meat. For health concerns a 7 D bacterial death reduction has to be achieved. This means that for a cooking temperature of 62 °C the meat has to be held at this temperature for at least 5 minutes. Therefore the total cooking time would be the time needed to heat all the meat to 62 °C plus 5 minutes to ensure a safe product. The heating or cooking system employed should also ensure that a minimal amount of the meat is heated above 65 °C. This can be easily achieved by minimising the external cooking temperature, but long cooking times will result. An industrial cooking process will be a compromise between the cost associated with longer residence time and product functionality. As mentioned earlier another way to add value is to supply nutritional information for selected cuts. Consequentially one of the objectives of this project was to provide some nutritional information for selected meat cuts. Though the primary objective of this part of the project was to develop a method for producing the needed information, so that Richmond N. Z. Ltd. can develop further information on an as needs basis. The nutritional characteristics of a number of export lamb cuts from the saddle region has also been investigated and a method devised to allow further characterisation of other cuts. The method involves breaking down a standard cut into its constituent components (e. g. Frenched rack consists of loin <b>eye,</b> fat <b>cap,</b> intercostals and fatty tissue). The constituent components are tested for their nutritional properties. The frenched rack nutritional properties are calculated from the nutritional properties of the constituents components and the yield data (percentage of each constituent component within a frenched rack) for frenched racks. This method allowed the identification of the main sources of variation for nutritional characteristics. These differences were found to be caused by the lean to fat ratio, not nutritional differences in lean tissue from the same region of lamb (i. e. loin eye and tenderloin very similar nutritionally). The difference in lean to fat ration also accounts for the variation between grades (i. e. PX grade lamb cuts have a higher fat content than YX grade lamb cuts due to PX grade cuts having a higher percentage fat tissue in their cuts). The cuts characterised were the shortloin section (whole section or chop), rack section (whole section or chop), 75 mm racks frenched 25 mm, boneless loin and tenderloin for both PX and YX grade lamb. The method will be applicable to other regions of lamb (i. e. hindquarter and forequarter) for which nutritional information already exists, but for which yielding data will have to be collected. The method would also be applicable to other species such as beef and venison, but both nutritional data for constituent components and yielding data would have to be collected...|$|R
