40|$|For {{public opinion}} {{to have an}} effect on foreign policy, it must first enter into the {{political}} debate over policy. I classify issues according to how they are presented to the public, the key variables being crisis/non-crisis, the level of media salience, and whether elites agree or disagree on policy. These three variables determine issue structure, which in turn affects the extent to which public opinion is injected into the debate on that issue. ^ Specific hypotheses are derived from the issue structure typology. The rally effect of crises is modified by whether or not elites are in agreement on how to meet the crisis. Indeed, the character of elite debate is very important in determining the role of public opinion in non-crisis situations as well. Elites, <b>especially</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>disagree</b> on a salient issue, indicate their responsiveness to public opinion by tailoring their rhetoric to match established opinion dikes within mass sentiment. Public knowledge is more likely to increase on salient issues that divide elites. ^ I present an initial test of the issue structure typology by using it to analyze four cases of the Reagan Doctrine. Relying on surveys of public opinion as well as on a content analysis of New York Times stories, I apply the typology to funding rebel groups in Afghanistan, Angola, and Nicaragua, {{as well as to the}} invasion of Grenada. The issue structure typology proves very useful, but a complete test requires considerably more data than is routinely available. ...|$|R

40|$|Disagreement is {{considered}} {{as an act}} that threatens someone's positive face. In this case, one is supposed to consider whom she talks to and in what situation. There are some factors that influence people in expressing disagreement such as ethnic background between the speaker and the interlocutor. From these factors, the writer is interested in analyzing disagreement, particularly about what kinds of linguistic choices that are used the most in expressing disagreement. The data {{of this study were}} taken from questionnaires distributed to 10 educated Chinese Indonesian and 10 educated Javanese from EF (English First). The data were categorized based on Garcia 's classification (1989) concerning confrontational and non confrontational devices. From the analysis, the writer found out that two of non confrontational devices, that is "Giving reason" is used the most by educated Chinese Indonesian <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>disagree</b> to the addressee. They tend to give reason as its functions to explain why <b>they</b> <b>disagree.</b> The second one is "Downtoned suggestions". It is frequently used by educated Javanese <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>disagree</b> to the addressee. They tend to give suggestion as its functions to help each other in solving the problem...|$|R

Reportedly pressured by Universal executives, Hitchcock wanted a score that was more jazz- and pop-influenced. Hitchcock's biographer, Patrick McGilligan, stated that Hitchcock was worried about becoming old-fashioned and felt that Herrmann's music had to change with the times as well. Herrmann initially accepted the offer, but then decided to score the film according to his own ideas.|$|R

The 1ESS switch was still in limited use as of 2012, and had a verified reliability of less than one unscheduled hour of failure in each thirty years of operation, validating its design.|$|R
