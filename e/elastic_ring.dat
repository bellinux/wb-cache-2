40|$|Introduction. The most {{frequently}} applied methods of endoscopic treatment of angiodysplasias, such as argon plasma coagulation, multipolar coagulation and heater probe, {{proved to be}} effective with certain shortcomings {{and the possibility of}} complications. There are very scarce data in the literature about the treatment of angiodysplasias with endoscopic ligature. Objective. The aim {{of the study was to}} examine the efficacy and safety of endoscopic treatment of gastric and duodenal angiodysplasias by ligation with <b>elastic</b> <b>rings.</b> Methods. In 12 patients (10 male and 2 female, mean age 65. 9 years) the endoscopic ligation of gastric and duodenal angiodysplasias was applied. Eight patients (66. 6 %) had solitary angiodysplasias in the stomach, two patients (16. 6 %) had solitary angiodysplasias in the descending part of the duodenum and two patients (16. 6 %) had multiple angiodysplasias in the stomach and duodenum. Two patients (16. 6 %) had active bleeding from angiodysplasias, while 10 patients (83. 3 %) had recent bleeding. We used the Cook Endoscopy system with 4 or 6 <b>elastic</b> <b>rings</b> for endoscopic ligation of angiodysplasias. Patients were under follow-up after 2 - 3 days, 30 days and then every 6 months following the endoscopic ligation of angiodysplasias. Results. Active bleeding from angiodysplasias was stopped in two patients (100 %) by endoscopic ligation with <b>elastic</b> <b>rings.</b> The average number of applied ligation sessions in our 12 patients was 1. 6, with an average of 1. 8 ligatures per session. There were no complications after ligation of angiodysplasias. Recurrence of bleeding occurred in one patient (8. 3 %) with multiple gastric and duodenal angiodysplasias. The average period of follow-up of patients was 22. 8 ± 17. 6 months. Conclusion. Endoscopic ligation with <b>elastic</b> <b>rings</b> can be effective and safe for treatment especially of solitary gastric and duodenal angiodysplasias...|$|R

A top-down modeling approach is followed {{to describe the}} rings undergoing all deformation modes in space by the Special Cosserat theory of curved rods. The specialization to extensional-flexural-shearing, then to extensional-flexural, and finally to purely flexural planar motions is illustrated. Free undamped extensional-flexural nonlinear motions involving the mth mode and its companion mode are investigated via a direct asymptotic approach based on the method of multiple scales applied to the geometrically exact equations of motion and it is shown that these motions are softening for linearly <b>elastic</b> <b>rings</b> while there are thresholds in the constitutive laws separating softening from hardening behaviors.

5000|$|In {{the absence}} of any flow (puD pd), an {{increase}} in pe generates a compressive stress in the tube wall causing it to buckle from a circular to an elliptic cross-section (except, of course, near its ends, where it is attached to the rigid tubes). Buckling to a shape with more than two lobes may arise in short, tethered, or inhomogeneous tubes. Once buckled, the tube becomes highly compliant so that small additional increases in pe lead to a substantial reduction in cross-sectional area ®. Further compression leads to contact of the opposite tube walls, first at a point, and then along a line (Figure 2, left); once in opposite-wall contact, the tube’s compliance falls because strong bending forces in the tube wall at the bulbous end of each lobe provide an increasing resistance to area reductions.

50|$|The {{animal is}} oval, thick, enveloped {{in a very}} {{delicate}} mantle, diaphanous upon its sides, through which is distinctly seen the branchiae and the abdominal mass. The edges are swollen, lobed, and united in almost {{the whole of the}} circumference, so that they present only three openings. The first is found at the anterior and lower third of the median line. It forms a slit for the passage of the foot. The two others are seen at the posterior part, and give passage to two distinct tubes or tracheae, cylindrical, fleshy, approaching each other towards their origin. These two tracheae can be extended far out of the shell. The lower is larger and longer, and serves to supply the branchiae with water. The upper, which is nearer to the hinge, is shorter and straighter. It serves for the excrementitious evacuations. It is furnished, at its upper and internal extremity, with two small tubercles, formed like teats, and armed with small papillae, whose use is probably to prevent the entrance of small foreign bodies. This trachea has no communication with the lower. It is prolonged, moreover, into the interior of the cavity, where it is continued by a delicate, transparent valve, which extends even to the opening of the anus. These tracheae can be drawn into the portion of the mantle which surrounds them, the covering of which is loose, and gives this part the appearance of a vulva. It is surrounded by a tendinous, solid, and <b>elastic</b> <b>ring.</b> A similar apparatus exists for the passage of the foot.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the elastic buckling of circular plates with an internal <b>elastic</b> <b>ring</b> support and elastically restrained edge against translation. The classical plate theory is used to derive the governing differential equation for circular plate with internal <b>elastic</b> <b>ring</b> support and flexible edge support system. This work presents the existence of buckling mode switching with respect to the radius of internal <b>elastic</b> <b>ring</b> support. The buckling mode may not be axisymmetric as previously assumed. The plate may buckle in an axisymmetric mode in general, but when the radius of the ring support becomes small, the plate may buckle in an asymmetric mode. The cross-over ring support radius varies from 0. 1255 to 0. 09371 times the plate radius, depending on the translational stiffness of the elastic restraint at the edges and elastic restraint of the ring support. The optimum radius of the internal <b>elastic</b> <b>ring</b> support is also determined. Extensive data is tabulated so that pertinent conclusions can be arrived at on the influence of translational restraints, Poisson’s ratio, and other boundary conditions on the buckling of uniform isotropic circular plates. The numerical results obtained are in good agreement with the previously published data...|$|E
30|$|In recent years, Zhao et al. [12] {{developed}} a novel non-pneumatic wheel called the mechanical elastic wheel (ME-Wheel). The ME-Wheel {{consists of three}} parts, the flexible tire body, hinge unit and suspension hub. In order to improve the adaptability of military vehicles in complex environment, the ME-Wheel is designed with a statically indeterminate structure. Compared with the conventional pneumatic tire, the ME-Wheel will not have potential risk factors such as flat tire or leakage. Moreover, the double buffered damping structure adopted by the ME-Wheel gives it excellent comfort. The ME-Wheel’s structure and vehicle ride comfort was analyzed by Wang et al. [13]. Wang et al. [14] analyzed the relationship among the excitation frequency, radial deformation, bending stiffness of combined <b>elastic</b> <b>rings,</b> and combined <b>elastic</b> rings’ laminated structure parameters.

40|$|In this investigation, the {{flexible}} tire model {{based on the}} absolute nodal coordinate for-mulation (ANCF) is integrated with LuGre tire friction model for evaluation of the longi-tudinal tire dynamics under severe braking scenarios. The ANCF-LuGre tire model developed allows for considering the nonlinear coupling between the dynamic structural deformation of the tire and its transient tire force distribution in the contact patch using general multibody dynamics computer algorithms. To this end, the contact patch obtained by the ANCF <b>elastic</b> <b>ring</b> tire model is discretized into small strips {{and the state of}} fric-tion at each strip is defined by the differential equation associated with the discretized LuGre friction parameters. The normal contact pressure distribution predicted by the ANCF <b>elastic</b> <b>ring</b> elements that are in contact with the road surface are mapped onto the LuGre strips in the contact patch to evaluate the tangential tire force distribution and then the tire forces evaluated at LuGre strips are fed back to the generalized tangential contact forces of the ANCF <b>elastic</b> <b>ring</b> tire model. By doing so, the structural deforma-tion of the ANCF <b>elastic</b> <b>ring</b> tire model is dynamically coupled with the LuGre tire fric-tion in the final form of the governing equations. Furthermore, the systematic and automated parameter identification procedure for the LuGre tire force model is devel-oped. It is shown that use of the proposed procedure with the modified friction curve pro-posed for wet road conditions leads to accurate prediction of the LuGre model parameters for measured tire force characteristics under various loading and speed con-ditions. Several numerical examples are presented in order to demonstrate the use of the in-plane ANCF-LuGre tire model for the longitudinal transient dynamics of tires under severe braking scenarios.
