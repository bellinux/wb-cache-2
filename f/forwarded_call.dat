50|$|<b>Call</b> <b>forwarding,</b> or <b>call</b> diversion, is a {{telephony}} {{feature of}} some telephone switching systems which redirects {{a telephone call}} to another destination, which may be, for example, a mobile telephone, voicemail box or another telephone number where the desired called party is available. <b>Call</b> <b>forwarding</b> was invented by Ernest J. Bonanno. In North America, the forwarded line usually rings once to remind the customer using <b>call</b> <b>forwarding</b> that the <b>call</b> is being redirected. More consistently, the forwarded line indicates its condition by stutter dial tone. <b>Call</b> <b>forwarding</b> typically can redirect incoming calls to any other domestic telephone number, but {{the owner of the}} forwarded line must pay any toll charges for <b>forwarded</b> <b>calls.</b> <b>Call</b> <b>forwarding</b> is often enabled by dialing *72 followed by the telephone number to which <b>calls</b> should be <b>forwarded.</b> Once someone answers, <b>call</b> <b>forwarding</b> is in effect. If no one answers or the line is busy, the dialing sequence must be repeated to effect <b>call</b> <b>forwarding.</b> <b>Call</b> <b>forwarding</b> is disabled by dialing *73. This feature requires a subscription from the telephone company. Also available in some areas is Remote Access to <b>call</b> <b>forwarding,</b> which permit the control over <b>call</b> <b>forwarding</b> from telephones other than the subscriber's telephone. VOIP and cable telephone systems also often allow <b>call</b> <b>forwarding</b> to be set up and directed via their web portals.|$|R

40|$|In today’s {{world of}} {{telecommunications}} {{there is an}} increasing problem with reaching people one wishes to speak to. People have several telephones and this makes the situation complex for the caller. Many phone calls are left unanswered. The <b>Call</b> <b>Forwarding</b> Agent is in this report presented {{as a solution to}} this reachability problem. The idea is to have an agent setting <b>call</b> <b>forwards</b> of all the users’ phones or numbers, towards the terminal where he is available. Later, when someone calls any of the users’ phones, the call will be terminated at the terminal where the user can receive it. The <b>Call</b> <b>Forwarding</b> Agent is compared to a number of similar services. The personal number service offers the same functionality as the <b>Call</b> <b>Forwarding</b> Agent, but the <b>Call</b> <b>Forwarding</b> Agent does not force the subscriber to change phone number and it also admits a simple call screening. We have implemented a prototype of the <b>Call</b> <b>Forwarding</b> Agent that can set <b>call</b> <b>forwards</b> of regular Public Service Telephony Network terminals and the Internet telephones in Ellemtel’s IP-phone system...|$|R
