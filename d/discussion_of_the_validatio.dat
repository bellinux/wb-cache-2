40|$|The lateral {{torsional}} buckling resistance of girders {{depends on the}} support conditions. In floor structures for buildings, coped girders are often used. A numerical model was developed to research <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> copes on lateral buckling resistance. The model is successfully validated with tests.

OBJECTIVES: Although published abstracts have <b>the</b> advan-tage <b>of</b> being prominent and concise, their {{quality in the}} otolaryn-gology literature has not been studied. We sought to understand <b>the</b> limitations <b>of</b> relying on abstracts as <b>the</b> sole source <b>of</b> information about published research. In addition, we sought to identify spe-cific opportunities for improving <b>the</b> quality <b>of</b> published articles and their associated abstracts. METHODS: Studies of original research published in four ma-jor otolaryngology journals from January 2008 to June 2008 were included. Each study article and abstract was reviewed separately for 12 domains relating to study design, results, and conclusions. Good inter-rater reliability was established as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>validatio...</b>|$|R
