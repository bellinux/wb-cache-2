40|$|Abstract: The {{performance}} of <b>indexing</b> <b>systems</b> {{is very important}} for a search engine. Usually, <b>indexing</b> <b>systems</b> on large-scale clusters can provide high search efficiency, but it brings expensive hardware costs. The costs would be greatly reduced if a distributed <b>indexing</b> <b>system</b> runs on small-scale clusters connected by the Internet. Two current inverted file partitioning schemes: document partitioning and term partitioning, have their merits individually. A two-tier distributed full-text <b>indexing</b> <b>system</b> is implemented, which uses document partitioning among the clusters and term partitioning inside each cluster. Our experiments show that the system performs well in search efficiency, resource consuming and load balance...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} a new <b>indexing</b> tree <b>system</b> for high dimensional codebook vectors. This <b>indexing</b> <b>system</b> uses a dynamic {{binary search tree}} with fat decision hyperplanes. The system is generic, adaptive {{and can be used}} as a software com­ ponent in any vector quantization system. The cost of this higher speed (compared to tabular indexing) is a negligible degradation of the distortion error. Neverthe­ less, a parameter allows the user to tradeo# speed for a lower distortion error. A distinctive and attractive feature of this tree <b>indexing</b> <b>system</b> is that it can follow non­stationary codebooks by performing local repairs to its indexing tree. Exper­ imental results show that this <b>indexing</b> <b>system</b> is very fast; it outperforms similar tree <b>indexing</b> <b>systems</b> like TSVQ and K­trees...|$|R
25|$|In {{the hope}} that she could {{eventually}} be identified by a DNA match with any living relatives, the body was exhumed in September 2005 to extract DNA. The University of North Texas Center for Human Identification was able to produce nuclear STR (nucDNA) and mitochondrial (mtDNA) profiles of her DNA via forensic DNA profiling. Her DNA profiles were stored in the Combined DNA <b>Index</b> <b>System</b> (CODIS), a database that allows the United States public crime laboratories to compare and exchange DNA profiles {{in order to identify}} criminal suspects and crime victims.|$|E

25|$|The FBI Laboratory, {{established}} with {{the formation of}} the BOI, did not appear in the J. Edgar Hoover Building until its completion in 1974. The lab serves as the primary lab for most DNA, biological, and physical work. Public tours of FBI headquarters ran through the FBI laboratory workspace before the move to the J. Edgar Hoover Building. The services the lab conducts include Chemistry, Combined DNA <b>Index</b> <b>System</b> (CODIS), Computer Analysis and Response, DNA Analysis, Evidence Response, Explosives, Firearms and Tool marks, Forensic Audio, Forensic Video, Image Analysis, Forensic Science Research, Forensic Science Training, Hazardous Materials Response, Investigative and Prospective Graphics, Latent Prints, Materials Analysis, Questioned Documents, Racketeering Records, Special Photographic Analysis, Structural Design, and Trace Evidence. The services of the FBI Laboratory are used by many state, local, and international agencies free of charge. The lab also maintains a second lab at the FBI Academy.|$|E

25|$|An early {{application}} of a DNA database was the compilation of a Mitochondrial DNA Concordance, prepared by Kevin W. P. Miller and John L. Dawson at the University of Cambridge from 1996 to 1998 from data collected as part of Miller's PhD thesis. There are now several DNA databases in existence around the world. Some are private, {{but most of the}} largest databases are government-controlled. The United States maintains the largest DNA database, with the Combined DNA <b>Index</b> <b>System</b> (CODIS) holding over 9 million records as of 2011. The United Kingdom maintains the National DNA Database (NDNAD), which is of similar size, despite the UK's smaller population. The size of this database, and its rate of growth, are giving concern to civil liberties groups in the UK, where police have wide-ranging powers to take samples and retain them even in the event of acquittal. The Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition partially addressed these concerns with part 1 of the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012, under which DNA samples must be deleted if suspects are acquitted or not charged, except in relation to certain (mostly serious and/or sexual) offences.|$|E
500|$|In November 1968, {{the city}} opened 38 {{monitoring}} stations, 10 outfitted with computer equipment. The 10 computerized stations {{were designed to}} send data every hour to the central computer, while the other 28 operated manually as backup. The old <b>index</b> <b>system</b> used during the 1966 smog, which produced a single number from multiple measurements, was abandoned as simplistic and unhelpful. The new <b>index</b> <b>system</b> was similar in that it used weather forecasts and measurements of pollutants {{in the air and}} had three progressive stages of severity ("alert," [...] "warning," [...] and [...] "emergency") requiring stronger actions by city, industry, and citizens.|$|E
500|$|In 1953, {{the city}} opened a {{laboratory}} {{to monitor pollution}} that would become its Department of Air Pollution Control. The department quantified pollution with an air quality index, a single number based on combined measurements of sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, and haze or smoke levels in the air. The city laboratory recorded the presence of those three pollutants, as measured by amount (concentration in parts-per-million, or ppm) and duration (time). The data for those three pollutants were combined into a single number using a formula developed by department co-founder Moe Mordecai Braverman. The index average was 12, with an [...] "emergency" [...] level if the index was higher than 50 for a 24-hour period. The average, 12, was determined from data collected between 1957 and 1964, and the [...] "emergency" [...] level of 50 was announced in 1964. The <b>index</b> <b>system</b> used by the city in 1966 is not in use anywhere today and was unique to the city even at the time; the 1966 smog itself prompted scientists to reexamine and improve the city's methodology for recording air-pollutant levels.|$|E

2500|$|Forensic DNA typing {{has been}} an {{effective}} way of identifying or exonerating criminal suspects due to analysis of evidence discovered at a crime scene. The human genome has many repetitive regions {{that can be found}} within gene sequences or in non-coding regions of the genome. Specifically, up to 40% of human DNA is repetitive. There are two distinct categories for these repetitive, non-coding regions in the genome. The first category is called variable number tandem repeats (VNTR), which are 10-100 base pairs long and the second category is called short tandem repeats (STR) and these consist of repeated 2-10 base pair sections. [...] PCR is used to amplify several well-known VNTRs and STRs using primers that flank each of the repetitive regions. The sizes of the fragments obtained from any individual for each of the STRs will indicate which alleles are present. By analyzing several STRs for an individual, a set of alleles for each person will be found that statistically is likely to be unique. [...] Researchers have identified the complete sequence of the human genome. This sequence can be easily accessed through the NCBI website and is used in many real-life applications. For example, the FBI has compiled a set of DNA marker sites used for identification, and these are called the Combined DNA <b>Index</b> <b>System</b> (CODIS) DNA database. Using this database enables statistical analysis to be used to determine the probability that a DNA sample will match. [...] PCR is a very powerful and significant analytical tool to use for forensic DNA typing because researchers only need a very small amount of the target DNA to be used for analysis. For example, a single human hair with attached hair follicle has enough DNA to conduct the analysis. Similarly, a few sperm, skin samples from under the fingernails, or a small amount of blood can provide enough DNA for conclusive analysis.|$|E
50|$|The United States {{national}} DNA database {{is called}} Combined DNA <b>Index</b> <b>System</b> (CODIS). It is maintained at three levels: national, state and local. Each level implemented its own DNA <b>index</b> <b>system.</b> The national DNA <b>index</b> <b>system</b> (NDIS) allows DNA profiles to be exchanged and compared between participated laboratories nationally. Each state DNA <b>index</b> <b>system</b> (SDIS) allows DNA profiles to be exchanged and compared between the laboratories of various {{states and the}} local DNA <b>index</b> <b>system</b> (LDIS) allows DNA profiles collected at local sites and uploaded to SDIS and NDIS.|$|E
