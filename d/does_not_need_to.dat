5|$|Designed by Tom Berg {{and created}} by Tinsley Transfers, the tattoo took around five hours {{to be applied}} onto Wentworth Miller. When the entire tattoo <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> be shown, for example, in scenes where the actor is wearing a T-shirt, only the forearm pieces of the tattoo are applied.|$|E
5|$|Since ancient times, the mallard {{has been}} eaten as food. The wild mallard was eaten in Neolithic Greece. Usually, only the breast and thigh meat is eaten. It <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> be hung before preparation, {{and is often}} braised or roasted, {{sometimes}} flavoured with bitter orange or with port.|$|E

5000|$|Thomas Mowle and David Sacko {{describe}} [...] "soft balancing" [...] as [...] "balancing that <b>does</b> <b>not</b> balance at all.” These theoretical {{efforts are}} counter-productive, since Realism and unipolarity are compatible and structural realism should rather develop {{a set of}} hypotheses for a unipolar world: “Scholars <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> desperately search for signs of balancing, they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> soften balancing beyond recognition, and they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> stand watch for the first glimmering of a new multipolar dawn.” ...|$|R

5|$|The {{eggs are}} {{incubated}} by the female for 14–15 days to hatching. Chicks are fed initially by the male, both parents sharing the duty {{after a few}} days when the female <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> brood so often, and they fledge in a further 14–15 days. There may be two broods in a year.|$|E
5|$|The {{third party}} can be {{identified}} by name or {{as a member of}} a particular group, and <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> exist when the contract was made. The Act specifically excludes certain types of contract, such as contracts for the transport of goods across national lines, as these fall under international trade laws.|$|E
5|$|An alloy of {{aluminium}} and gallium in pellet form added to {{water can be}} used to generate hydrogen. The process also produces alumina, but the expensive gallium, which prevents the formation of an oxide skin on the pellets, can be re-used. This has important potential implications for a hydrogen economy, as hydrogen can be produced on-site and <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> be transported.|$|E

I <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> use any medications; at first, I had to close my eyes. Now, I <b>do</b> <b>not</b> even have to do this.|$|R
30|$|Process {{coordination}} through tuple spaces, {{introduced by}} the programming language LINDA for parallel systems [4], supports decoupled communications in space (processes <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> know each other locations) and in time (processes <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> be active at the same time). Besides that, this model of coordination provides some synchronization power.|$|R

5|$|Beef steak can {{be cooked}} {{to a level}} of very rare (bleu, a cold raw center), rare, medium rare, medium, medium well done, or well done. Pittsburgh rare is charred on the outside. Beef, unlike certain other meats, <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> be cooked through. Food-borne human {{illnesses}} are not normally found within a beef steak, though surfaces can potentially be contaminated from handling, and thus, very rare steak (seared on the outside and raw within) is generally accepted as safe.|$|E

The miser has heard that the strange old lady <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> eat and offers to help her stay at the inn if she will teach him her secret of how to avoid wasting money on food. He offers her a golden guinea. The fairy decides that someone that miserly must be punished and compels him to {{continue}} passing out guineas to all he meets.|$|E
5|$|Finn and Jake race to Bubblegum's {{castle and}} find her {{tied to a}} chair, with Ricardio about to rip her heart out. Finn and Jake then fight Ricardio and manage to beat him up. The Ice King crawls into the castle and places Ricardio back into his chest. Later during dinner, Bubblegum tells Finn that he <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> be jealous anymore, but Finn denies that he was jealous in the first place.|$|E

5|$|She finally narrates {{the story}} of her {{abandonment}} to Jug, who tells her that she fears abandonment so much that she does not allow herself to commit in relationships, leaving before they can leave her. He convinces her that she <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> forgive her parents for abandoning her, but she can, as an adult, see them as two regular people who made a mistake. After this, Kaira makes an effort to reconcile with her parents and also works to finish her short film.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanism}} of prion replication {{has implications for}} designing drugs. Since the incubation period of prion diseases is so long, an effective drug <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> eliminate all prions, but simply needs {{to slow down the}} rate of exponential growth. Models predict that {{the most effective way to}} achieve this, using a drug with the lowest possible dose, is to find a drug that binds to fibril ends and blocks them from growing any further.|$|E
5|$|On March 31, 2009, the Hall of Fame {{announced}} new by-law additions {{which will}} be implemented on January 1, 2010. Starting in 2010, male and female players are considered for induction separately and a maximum of two women can be inducted as players per year. The by-law also clarifies that a builder <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> have been a coach, manager or executive to be inducted. Although they remain separate categories, the builders and on-ice officials are considered on the same ballot and a combined maximum of two can be inducted each year. The Board of Directors will now meet at least once every five years to consider potential changes to the limits.|$|E

5|$|The exact mass-luminosity {{relationship}} {{depends on}} how efficiently energy can be transported from the core to the surface. A higher opacity has an insulating effect that retains more energy at the core, so the star <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> produce as much energy to remain in hydrostatic equilibrium. By contrast, a lower opacity means energy escapes more rapidly and the star must burn more fuel to remain in equilibrium. Note, however, that a sufficiently high opacity can result in energy transport via convection, which changes the conditions needed to remain in equilibrium.|$|E
5|$|The game {{is played}} from an {{isometric}} perspective, and the screen, which <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> remain centered on the protagonist, can be scrolled with the mouse or the keyboard. Areas are revealed as they are explored by the player's characters. A fog of war effect hides explored areas when the player's characters move away from them. The player can also change the formation in which the party moves. Clicking an area exit, such as a doorway or staircase, causes another area to be loaded. Clicking {{on the edge of}} an outside area causes the party to travel there; the game then presents the player with the World Map, from which the player may select a destination.|$|E
5|$|With {{its form}} and {{structure}} in consideration, Rescued by Rover shows a growing understanding among directors of how stories {{can be told}} on film; that is, {{the belief that the}} audience <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> see the family return to their home, but will instead assume this occurred while the beggar woman was returning to her hovel. While the duration of the shot does not correspond with the time necessary for the father and the family dog to travel back, it also does not affect the sense of realistic on-screen representation.|$|E

5|$|Apu and his {{new wife}} Manjula invite Homer and Marge to their house for dinner. However, Apu and Manjula get in a fight, after Marge {{mentions}} to Manjula that Apu <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> work {{as much as he}} does. The week before Valentine's Day, Apu tells Homer that he is disappointed that Manjula does not love him, until Homer assures him that Manjula will not leave him before Valentine's Day, and Apu agrees. Apu decides to shower Manjula with many romantic surprises to regain her love. However, although many of Apu's surprises succeed in fixing his marriage, they ruin other people's relationships. The rest of Springfield's women become jealous from all the attention Manjula is receiving, and find their men to be cheapskates (including Maude Flanders). At Moe's Tavern, Homer encourages several of Springfield's men that they have to prevent Apu and Manjula from reconciling to save their own relationships and marriages.|$|E
5|$|As the day wears on, Michael becomes {{convinced}} {{that what happened}} to his office is a hate crime and an act of terrorism. Believing it to have been perpetrated by someone in the office, he begins to lose his faith in his employees, whom he considers his friends. Michael tries talking to his former boss Ed Truck (Ken Howard), who tells him that he <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> have his employees be his friends. But his mood changes drastically when he finds out the prank was carried out by his obnoxious friend Todd Packer (David Koechner). Michael instantly finds the joke hilarious, and his faith in his friends is restored. At the end of the day, Jim is cheered up when he finds that all seven of his voicemail messages were left by Pam throughout the day. Jim is seen driving home, and Pam's voicemails act as a voice-over, closing out the episode.|$|E
5|$|Given {{the limited}} {{resources}} of many developing nations, funding vitally effects how emergency medicine {{fits into the}} health system. Preventive care is {{a crucial part of}} healthcare in developing countries, and {{it may be difficult to}} budget for emergency medicine without cutting into those resources. This is a particular problem for poorer nations such as Zambia, which had a per capita health expenditure of 23 US dollars in 2003. Regardless of the amount of preventive care available, health problems requiring immediate attention will still occur, and emergency medical programs could increase access to care. Kobusingye et al. argue that expanding emergency medicine <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> be unreasonably expensive, particularly if developing countries focus on low-cost but effective treatments administered by first responders.|$|E
