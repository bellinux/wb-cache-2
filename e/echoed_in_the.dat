The BBC received 200complaints regarding the content of the episode, including accusations that it perpetuated stereotypes about British Asians, ridiculed Islam and disrespected the Qur'an; some of these criticisms would be <b>echoed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> furore regarding Holland's documentary.|$|E
5|$|Ten {{months before}} Conran made the movie with his actors, he shot it entirely with stand-ins in Los Angeles and then created the whole movie in {{animatics}} {{so that the}} actors had {{an idea of what}} the film would look like and where to move on the soundstage. To prepare for the film, Conran had his cast watch old movies, such as Lauren Bacall in To Have and Have Not (1944) for Paltrow's performance and The Thin Man (1934) for the relationship between Nick and Nora that was to be <b>echoed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> one between Joe and Polly. Avnet constantly pushed for room in this meticulously designed movie for the kind of freedom the actors needed, like being able to move around on the soundstage.|$|E

25|$|The final canvas differs {{markedly}} from Thomson's spring 1916 sketch. He {{made the}} tree appear larger {{by lowering the}} hills {{on the far side}} of the lake. The weather had been stormy when Thomson made the sketch and the dark, rolling clouds were <b>echoed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> heavy, swirling brushwork of the sky and the slate grey lake. In the final painting, Thomson has swapped the storm clouds for a clear twilight sky. The sky and lake are now highly stylized, painted in long horizontal brushstrokes that show, along with its nearly square format, the influence of Thomson's colleague Lawren Harris.|$|E

25|$|Bart Ehrman {{argues that}} the {{historical}} Jesus was an apocalyptic preacher, and that his apocalyptic beliefs are recorded in the earliest Christian documents: Mark and the authentic Pauline epistles.

The Gospel of Thomas proclaims that the Kingdom of God is already present for those who understand the secret message of Jesus (Saying 113), and lacks apocalyptic themes.

25|$|In 1948, the Tito-Stalin split took place. In {{the first}} years {{following}} the split, the political repression worsened, as it extended to Communists accused of Stalinism. Hundreds of Slovenes were imprisoned in the concentration camp of Goli Otok, together with thousands of people of other nationalities. Among the show trials {{that took place in}} Slovenia between 1945 and 1950, the most important were the Nagode trial against democratic intellectuals and left liberal activists (1946) and the Dachau trials (1947–1949), where former inmates of Nazi concentration camps were accused of collaboration with the Nazis. Many members of the Roman Catholic clergy suffered persecution.
