40|$|In {{this paper}} we present {{experimental}} measurements of buoyancy driven turbulent exchange flow in a vertical pipe (L/d ratios of 9 - 12).

Away from either end, a fully developed region of turbulence exists with a linear density gradient. Using a mixing length model that accounts for the end effects, we obtain the turbulent scales and flux. The Nusselt number scales like the square root of the Rayleigh number (Nu similar toRa- 1 / 2).
