25|$|Coke's {{advertising}} is pervasive, {{as one of}} Woodruff's stated goals was to ensure that everyone on Earth drank Coca-Cola as their preferred beverage. This <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>in</b> southern areas of the United States, such as Atlanta, where Coke was born.|$|E
25|$|The {{possibility}} of other causes of ulcers, notably malignancy (gastric cancer) {{needs to be}} kept in mind. This <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>in</b> ulcers of the greater (large) curvature of the stomach; most are also a consequence of chronic H. pylori infection.|$|E
25|$|The {{roles of}} women in Christianity can vary {{considerably}} today as they have varied historically since the third century New Testament church. This <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>in</b> marriage and in formal ministry positions within certain Christian denominations, churches, and parachurch organizations.|$|E
5000|$|Individual bars may be {{considered}} to be disreputable, sinister, of poor upkeep, or even a detriment to the community. This <b>was</b> <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>in</b> the past: ...|$|R
50|$|In optical instruments, {{dispersion}} {{leads to}} chromatic aberration; a color-dependent blurring that sometimes is the resolution-limiting effect. This <b>was</b> <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>in</b> refracting telescopes, before {{the invention of}} achromatic objective lenses.|$|R
50|$|In pre-industrialized times, smiths {{held high}} or special social {{standing}} since they supplied the metal tools needed for farming (especially the plough) and warfare. This <b>was</b> <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>in</b> some West African cultures.|$|R
25|$|This <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>in</b> {{the area}} of Labor and Employment law. In Canada a {{fiduciary}} has obligations to the employer even after the employment relationship is terminated, whereas in the United States the employment and fiduciary relationships terminate together.|$|E
25|$|Since most Singaporean Chinese {{trace their}} ancestral home to {{southern}} China, their culture generally has a closer affinity with southern Chinese culture (predominantly that of Fujian, Guangdong and Hainan) This <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>in</b> terms of various southern Chinese dialects, customs, cultural, and religious practices in Singapore.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the recent}} upsurge in {{the motif of}} heroic werewolves, unsympathetic portrayals of werewolves as monsters also {{continue}} to be common in popular culture. This <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>in</b> movies, which are only slowly incorporating trends in written fiction. There are very few werewolf movies outside the horror genre.|$|E
50|$|This {{situation}} <b>was</b> <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>in</b> the Central Luzon {{area of the}} Philippines. The {{sudden and}} extreme gap between the landlord and the tenant {{is seen as the}} main cause of the peasant unrest.|$|R
60|$|This <b>was</b> <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>in</b> Pope's {{day when}} {{literature}} was so closely connected with politics that an author's work was praised or blamed not upon its merits, {{but according to}} his, and the critic's, politics.|$|R
25|$|As governor, Pliny held large {{influence}} {{over all of}} the residents of his province. This <b>was</b> <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>in</b> the legal treatment of Christians. The Roman legal construct of cognitio extra ordinem afforded governors a large amount of discretion in deciding legal cases.|$|R
25|$|The total (harmful) air {{emissions}} produced by wood kilns, including their heat source, can be significant. Typically, {{the higher the}} temperature the kiln operates at, the larger amount of emissions are produced (per pound of water removed). This <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>in</b> the drying of thin veneers and high-temperature drying of softwoods.|$|E
25|$|Fear {{of the pit}} getting filled: In some places, {{people are}} scared that their toilet pits will get filled very fast if all family members use it everyday. So they {{continue}} {{to go out to}} delay the toilet pit filling up. This <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>in</b> the case of a pit latrine.|$|E
25|$|Too {{many people}} using a toilet: This <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>in</b> case of shared or public toilets. If {{too many people}} want to use a toilet at the same time, then some people may go outside to defecate instead of waiting. In some cases, people {{might not be able to}} wait due to {{diarrhea}} (or result of an Irritable Bowel Syndrome emergency).|$|E
50|$|Virtual ‘friends’ {{can provide}} {{people with a}} sense of {{security}} and self-confidence. This can pose to <b>be</b> <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>in</b> those who have difficulty communicating or interacting with others. People may look to their virtual friends for positive encouragement or just companionship.|$|R

50|$|Both {{animal and}} human {{studies suggest that}} the social {{environment}} has a strong influence on the consequences of stresses. This finding seems to <b>be</b> <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>in</b> the case of social stresses, like social defeat (Bjorkqvist, 2001; Rygula et alli, 2005; de Jong et alli, 2005).|$|R
25|$|This <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>in</b> New York City, where 28% of rent {{stabilized}} tenants {{spend more}} than half their income on rent. Among lower income families the percentage is much higher. According to an estimate by the Community Service Society, 65% of New York City families living below the federal poverty line are paying {{more than half of}} their income toward rent.|$|E
25|$|Antimicrobial copper-alloy touch {{surfaces}} {{can prevent}} frequently touched surfaces from serving as reservoirs for {{the spread of}} pathogenic microbes. This <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>in</b> healthcare facilities, where harmful viruses, bacteria, and fungi colonize and persist on doorknobs, push plates, railings, tray tables, tap (faucet) handles, IV poles, HVAC systems, and other equipment. These microbes can often survive on surfaces for surprisingly {{long periods of time}} (sometimes more than 30 days).|$|E
25|$|Although not {{particularly}} high, these mountains are rugged {{and should not}} be underestimated. Severe weather conditions in the North Shore Mountains often contrast dramatically with mild conditions in nearby Vancouver. This <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>in</b> winter, but even in summer, large precipices are hidden very close to popular hiking trails and it is very easy to get lost, despite being in sight of the city. Those who venture into the North Shore Mountains for whatever reason should be well prepared at any time of year.|$|E
5000|$|This <b>was</b> <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>in</b> American films. The {{first was}} Chuck Norris's 1978 Good Guys Wear Black, which {{postulated}} a cynical U.S. government writing off MIAs with a bogus mission. [...] 1983's Uncommon Valor, starring Gene Hackman, followed suit, as did Norris again in 1984 with Missing in Action.|$|R
5000|$|Many AI {{researchers}} {{find that}} they can procure more funding and sell more software if they avoid the tarnished name of [...] "artificial intelligence" [...] and instead pretend their work {{has nothing to do}} with intelligence at all.

25|$|The World Health Organization, {{looking at}} global public health, {{identifies}} fluoride {{as one of}} a few chemicals (along with the arsenic and nitrate, {{and to a lesser extent}} lead, selenium and uranium) that are found in excessive levels in many parts of the world and cause negative health effects; for fluoride this <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>in</b> large regions of India, China, Central Africa and South America, and locally in many parts of the world. Only for fluoride does it recommend adjusting the level in places where the chemical is low to reach a threshold; this is because there is clear evidence that low concentrations provide protection against cavities, both in children and in adults.|$|E
25|$|The {{more the}} {{internet}} is incorporated into daily life, the greater the impact it has on formal language. This <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>in</b> modern Language Arts classes {{through the use of}} smart phones, tablets, and social media. Students are exposed to the language of the internet more than ever, and as such, the grammatical structure and slang of the internet are bleeding into their formal writing. Full immersion into a language is always the best way to learn it. Mark Lester in his book Teaching Grammar and Usage states, “The biggest single problem that basic writers have in developing successful strategies for coping with errors is simply their lack of exposure to formal written English...We would think it absurd to expect a student to master a foreign language without extensive exposure to it.” Since students are immersed in internet language, that is the form and structure they are mirroring.|$|E
25|$|Most gem-quality diamond {{crystals}} are octahedra {{in their}} rough state (see material properties of diamond). These crystals are usually cut into round brilliants {{because it is}} possible to cut two such stones out of one octahedron with minimal loss of weight. If the crystal is malformed or twinned, or if inclusions are present at inopportune locations, the diamond is more likely to receive a fancy cut (a cut other than a round brilliant). This <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>in</b> the case of macle, which are flattened twin octahedron crystals. Round brilliants have certain requisite proportions that would result in high weight loss, whereas fancy cuts are typically much more flexible in this regard. Sometimes the cutters compromise and accept lesser proportions and symmetry in order to avoid inclusions or to preserve carat weight, since the per-carat price of diamond is much higher when the stone is over one carat (200 mg).|$|E
50|$|Irish {{immigrants}} to the U.S. in the 19th century faced a combination of anti-immigrant, anti-Catholic, and specifically anti-Irish bigotry which were closely intertwined. This <b>was</b> <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>in</b> Puritan-founded Boston, with its strongly Anglo-Saxon population. Generations of Bostonians celebrated Pope's Night on November 5 each year, holding anti-Catholic parades and burning the pope in effigy.|$|R
50|$|For {{the smaller}} {{organization}} with insufficient finance and/or specialist management skills, {{the joint venture}} can prove an effective method of obtaining the necessary resources to enter a new market. This can <b>be</b> <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>in</b> attractive markets, where local contacts, access to distribution, and political requirements may make a joint venture the preferred or even legally required solution.|$|R
50|$|The {{directory}} {{was always}} a bit less expensive than its later rival, Crockfords Clerical Directory, but not surprisingly it consequently offered considerably less {{in the way of}} biographical detail. This <b>was</b> <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>in</b> the earlier editions which offered little or no information as to previous appointments, universities attended, or lists of publications by the clergy.|$|R
25|$|Furthermore, many cancers {{originate}} from a viral infection; this <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>in</b> {{animals such as}} birds, but less so in humans. 12% of human cancers {{can be attributed to}} a viral infection. The mode of virally induced tumors can be divided into two, acutely transforming or slowly transforming. In acutely transforming viruses, the viral particles carry a gene that encodes for an overactive oncogene called viral-oncogene (v-onc), and the infected cell is transformed as soon as v-onc is expressed. In contrast, in slowly transforming viruses, the virus genome is inserted, especially as viral genome insertion is obligatory part of retroviruses, near a proto-oncogene in the host genome. The viral promoter or other transcription regulation elements, in turn, cause over-expression of that proto-oncogene, which, in turn, induces uncontrolled cellular proliferation. Because viral genome insertion is not specific to proto-oncogenes and the chance of insertion near that proto-oncogene is low, slowly transforming viruses have very long tumor latency compared to acutely transforming virus, which already carries the viral-oncogene.|$|E
25|$|Along {{with being}} the capital of Canada, Ottawa is {{politically}} diverse in local politics. Most of the city has traditionally supported the Liberal Party. Perhaps the safest areas for the Liberals are the ones dominated by Francophones, especially in Vanier and central Gloucester. Central Ottawa is usually more left-leaning, and the New Democratic Party have won ridings there. Some of Ottawa's suburbs are swing areas, notably central Nepean and, despite its francophone population, Orléans. The southern and western parts {{of the old city}} of Ottawa are generally moderate and swing to the Conservative Party. The farther one goes outside the city centre like to Kanata and Barrhaven and rural areas, the voters tend to be increasingly conservative, both fiscally and socially. This <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>in</b> the former Townships of West Carleton, Goulbourn, Rideau and Osgoode, which are more in line with the conservative areas in the surrounding counties. However, not all rural areas support the Conservative Party. Rural parts of the former township of Cumberland, with a large number of Francophones, traditionally support the Liberal Party, though their support has recently weakened.|$|E
25|$|In every {{surgical}} and non-surgical procedure, {{the risk}} of medical complications exists before, during, and after a procedure, and, given the sensitive biological nature of breast tissues (adipocyte, glandular), this <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>in</b> the case of fat graft breast augmentation. Despite its relative technical simplicity, the injection (grafting) technique for breast augmentation is accompanied by post-procedure complicationsfat necrosis, calcification, and sclerotic noduleswhich directly influence the technical efficacy of the procedure, and of achieving a successful outcome. The Chinese study Breast Augmentation by Autologous Fat-injection Grafting: Management and Clinical analysis of Complications (2009), reported {{that the incidence of}} medical complications is reduced with strict control of the injection-rate (cm3/min) of the breast-filler volume being administered, and by diffusing the fat-grafts in layers to allow their even distribution within the breast tissue matrix. The complications occurred to the 17-patient group were identified and located with 3-D volumetric and MRI visualizations of the breast tissues and of any sclerotic lesions and abnormal tissue masses (malignant neoplasm). According to the characteristics of the defect or abnormality, the sclerotic lesion was excised and liquefied fat was aspirated; the excised samples indicated biological changes in the intramammary fat graftsfat necrosis, calcification, hyalinization, and fibroplasia.|$|E
50|$|Some Korean {{scholars}} {{observed that}} the pure blood theory served as {{a useful tool for}} the South Korean government to make its people obedient and easy to govern when the country was embroiled in ideological turmoil. It <b>was</b> <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>in</b> the dictatorial leaderships by former presidents Syngman Rhee and Park Chung-hee when nationalism was incorporated into anti-Communism.|$|R
5000|$|In July 1541 troops {{under the}} command of Jerónimo Luis Tejelo (Deputy Marshal to Jorge Robledo) found the wide valley of Los Aburrá {{inhabited}} by indigenous farmers who had [...] "a habitat organized in groups with scattered houses, forming clusters of houses".

25|$|In {{contrast}} to ONE, Inc. studies, more conservative homophile organizations of the 1950s, {{such as the}} Daughters of Bilitis, discouraged butch-femme roles and identities. This <b>was</b> <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>in</b> relation to the butch identity, as the organization held the belief that assimilation into heterosexual society was {{the goal of the}} homophile movement. Gender expressions outside of the norm prevented assimilation.|$|R
