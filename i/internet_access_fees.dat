If someone wants to transmit a high quality service with no interruptions and ‘guaranteed this, guaranteed that’, they should be willing to pay for that [...] . They shouldn't get on and expect a free ride. ” – Ed Whitacre, AT&T CEO, 2006. The past year witnessed an extraordinary event.

In this paper we consider a model with two types of asymmetry arising from different entry timing, i. e. a larger reputation for the incumbent and lower cost of servicing for the entrant {{as a result of}} more advanced technology. As a result firms have divergent preferences over the <b>access</b> <b>fee.</b> In case of linear and non-linear prices the <b>access</b> <b>fee</b> might still act as the instrument of collusion, but only if a side-payment is permitted which is generally welfare decreasing. Moreover, in contrast with the European regulatory framework, the <b>access</b> <b>fee</b> on the basis of termination cost might not necessarily be a socially preferable solution. cost asymmetry, brand loyalty, imperfect competition, network interconnection, <b>access</b> <b>fee...</b>|$|R

Despite articulate pleas for network upgrades to accelerate <b>internet</b> <b>access,</b> there is little rigorous research quantifying benefits to individual firms that arise from upgraded internet connectivity. We use a large New Zealand micro-survey of firms linked to unit record firm financial data to determine the impact that differing types of <b>internet</b> <b>access</b> have on firm productivity. Propensity score matching is used to control for factors, including the firm’s (lagged) productivity, that determine firms’ <b>internet</b> <b>access</b> choices. Having matched firms, we examine the productivity impacts that arise when a firm adopts different types (speeds) of internet connectivity. Broadband adoption is found to boost productivity but we find no productivity differences across broadband type.

40|$|A {{variety of}} issues and public policy {{decisions}} are increasingly important to the proliferation of international electronic markets.

The Internet, an expected key information conduit for the proliferation of international electronic commerce, has been somewhat U. S. centric, in that the architects and users were a small elite male homogeneous population. Since 1995 this has changed due to: reduction of Internet funding/administration by the U. S. Government; the Internet user base has become heterogeneous, reflecting the makeup of society; regionalization of Internet architecture and telecommunication deregulation; lawyer interest in cyberspace. Although the Internet has had few rules and regulations, an ad-hoc consensual governance process grew up to address Internet standards and engineering needs. While bodies suc...|$|R
