5|$|The {{day after}} Cleave's article {{appeared}} in the Evening Standard, Beatles press officer Tony Barrow offered Datebook, a US teen magazine, rights to all four interviews. Barrow believed the pieces were important to show fans that the Beatles were progressing beyond simple pop music and producing more intellectually challenging work. As Datebook was a socially progressive magazine that addressed subjects such as interracial dating and legalization of marijuana, <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> suitable vehicle to carry this information.|$|E
5|$|Solo {{was born}} in Richland, Washington on July 30, 1981 to Judy Lynn (née Shaw) and Jeffrey Solo. Her father, an Italian-American Vietnam War veteran, who {{was in and out}} of her life as a child and teenager, taught her how to play soccer at a young age. When Solo was seven, her father picked her and her brother Marcus up to go to a {{baseball}} game in the nearby city of Yakima, but ended up driving over three hours west to Seattle, where they stayed for several days at a hotel. Solo described how <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> vacation at first, but soon realized it was not. Police later found them at a downtown bank and arrested Jeffrey for alleged kidnapping. Although her parents had divorced when she was six and she lived with her mother, Solo maintained a close relationship with her father after reconnecting with him during her college years at the University of Washington. He continued to be a major influence in her life until his death of a heart attack in June 2007.|$|E
25|$|Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode an A- grade, saying: What’s most {{striking}} about “No Sanctuary,” {{apart from its}} attempts at thematic resonance, is how quickly and brutally the question of Terminus is resolved. If you’d asked me beforehand, I would’ve guessed {{that it would take}} {{at least a couple of}} episodes before Rick and the others could free themselves. I wouldn’t have been exactly excited about that, because the longer you stay in a community full of murderous cannibals without any major character being killed, the more the tension just drips away, but <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> reasonable assumption to make, especially when taking into consideration how tricky it was going to be to build the rest of the season. Without the prison home base or an obvious major villain (goodbye, the Governor), we need something to create structure—a group of psychos who harvest human flesh seems like too good a concept to dispose of immediately.|$|E
60|$|The {{room was}} chill {{and cold and}} gray. It had only two small windows. Its doors were low. Even Mrs. Field was forced to stoop in entering. This helped to make <b>it</b> <b>seem</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> den. There were roller-towels {{in the corner and}} wash-basins, and a {{grindstone}} which made <b>it</b> <b>seem</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> barn. <b>It</b> was, in fact, more cheerless than a barn, and less wholesome.|$|R

500|$|The album's {{title is}} a {{reference}} to the binaural recording techniques that were utilized on several tracks. Binaural literally means [...] "having or relating to two ears." [...] Regarding the choice of the title, Gossard said, [...] "When we looked up the word 'binaural,' it meant to listen with both ears. So <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> fitting title for the album." ...|$|E
500|$|The Bold Bank Robbery was {{inspired}} by and created after {{the success of the}} 1903 western film The Great Train Robbery; other inspirations included American and European crime films. Lubin Manufacturing Company had been known to produce films similar to other popular ones; film historian Kemp R. Niver observed that [...] "if <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> good idea, and other film producers were making money, 'Pop' Lubin simply appropriated the title and remade or duped the motion picture." [...] Siegmund Lubin filed a copyright for the film on July 25, 1904. The finished product comprised 600 feet (182 m) of film.|$|E
500|$|Perrey Reeves, {{who played}} Kristen, was David Duchovny's real-life girlfriend at the time. Speaking of Mulder's {{possible}} sexual encounter with Kristen, series creator Chris Carter said, [...] "I thought, 'This guy's a monk. Let's {{let him be}} a human. Especially in [...] absence, <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> perfect opportunity to do it." [...] Duchovny had previously acted alongside another real-life girlfriend, Maggie Wheeler, in the first season episode [...] "Born Again". Gillian Anderson is absent from the episode as she was on leave {{to give birth to}} her daughter Piper at the time. This episode was the first in which Scully did not appear.|$|E

500|$|Though {{the match}} was {{intended}} to be a celebration of unity, the pre-match actions caused a political row. The fact that [...] "Die Stem van Suid-Afrika" [...] was played before the match and the reaction of the predominantly white crowd were perceived to be an act of white defiance. Luyt defended his decision to play the South African anthem, stating [...] "I will not be threatened by anybody, and I don't care if certain people, not having rugby at heart, feel upset about my decision." [...] In its match report the following day, The Star wrote, [...] "For that moment inside the concrete bowl, <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> besieged tribe had gathered ...|$|E
500|$|Tracy Hickman once ran the {{adventure}} as a Dungeon Master. According to him, {{the experience was}} like an old scary movie, with [...] "the obligatory castle high on the craggy cliff with the wolves howling in the woods. Sure enough, the vampire was {{up there in the}} castle. To most of the players <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> straight forward task: find the vampire and kill him." [...] One player discovered Strahd's backstory and was so affected by it that {{when it came time to}} kill the vampire at the end of {{the adventure}}, despite having a sword capable of dispatching Strahd, he refused, and his companions were forced to complete the task. Afterwards, Hickman asked him why. [...] "He deserved to die better than that," [...] his friend said, to which Hickman replied [...] "Yes [...] But that is how it is with people who fall from greatness. He chose his end when he first chose to kill his brother. How could it be any different?" ...|$|E
500|$|Charles and the Aulic Council {{were divided}} about the {{strategy}} {{with which to}} attack the French. Charles wanted a major thrust from Bohemia designed to isolate the French forces in northern Germany and lead to a rapid decision. The greater part of the Austrian army was already concentrated there, so <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> natural operation. The Aulic Council disagreed {{on account of the}} Danube River splitting the forces of Charles and his brother John. [...] They instead suggested that the main attack should be launched south of the Danube so as to maintain safer communications with Vienna. [...] In the end, they had their way, but not before precious time had been lost. The Austrian plan called for the Bohemian corps, the I under Bellegarde, consisting of 38,000 troops, and the II of 20,000 troops under Kollowrat, to attack Regensburg (Ratisbon) from the Bohemian mountains by way of Cham, the Austrian center and reserve, comprising 66,000 men of Hohenzollern's III, Rosenberg's IV, and Lichtenstein's I Reserve Corps, to advance on the same objective through Scharding, and the left wing, made up of the V of Archduke Louis, Hiller's VI, and Kienmayer's II Reserve Corps, a total of 61,000 men, to move forward toward Landshut and guard the flank.|$|E

500|$|Matsuhara, {{who came}} up with the concept of the phone trigger system, stated that he {{initially}} wanted to incorporate the player's own mobile phone into the system. However, the idea was abandoned due to concerns that it might clash with Japan's privacy laws. When asked if the phone trigger system would be used in a possible sequel to the game, Hayashi stated that he hoped this would not be the case and recalled saying [...] "who thought of this system!" [...] while writing the contents of the text messages. While Shitakura did not directly contribute to the script itself, Hayashi stated that Shitakura helped with the overall plot and provided assistance with the second half of the story. In particular, Shitakura helped a lot on the time traveling aspects of the story. Hayashi stated that while he did not want the script to repeat the same text over and over again, it was ultimately unavoidable due to the player having to travel back in time so he tried to place emphasis on the overall tempo of the plot's development and how the plot unfolded. With regards to the theme of time traveling, Hayashi had felt that <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> topic that was overdone and expressed concern over it when he first heard the idea from Shikura.|$|E
500|$|After Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask), Wilder {{began working}} on a script he called Young Frankenstein. After he wrote a two-page scenario, he called Mel Brooks, who told him that <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> [...] "cute" [...] idea, but showed little interest. A few months later, Wilder {{received}} a call from his agent, Mike Medavoy, who asked if he had anything where he could include Peter Boyle and Marty Feldman, his two new clients. Having just seen Feldman on television, Wilder was inspired to write a scene that takes place at Transylvania Station, where Igor and Frederick meet for the first time. The scene was later included in the film almost verbatim. Medavoy liked the idea and called Brooks, asking him to direct. Brooks was not convinced, but having spent four years working on two box-office failures, he decided to accept. While working on the Young Frankenstein script, Wilder was offered the part of the Fox in the musical film adaptation of Saint Exupéry's classic book, The Little Prince. When filming was about to begin in London, Wilder received an urgent call from [...] Brooks, who was filming Blazing Saddles, offering Wilder the role of the [...] "Waco Kid" [...] after Dan Dailey dropped out at the last minute, while Gig Young became too ill to continue. Wilder shot his scenes for Blazing Saddles and immediately afterwards filmed The Little Prince.|$|E
500|$|Television critics reacted mostly mixed to [...] "Excellence in Broadcasting", {{calling the}} storyline [...] "funny," [...] but [...] "toothless." [...] In a {{simultaneous}} {{review of the}} episodes of The Simpsons and The Cleveland Show that preceded the show, and the broadcast of American Dad! that followed it, The A.V. Club reviewer Rowan Kaiser noted, [...] "most of the episode was spent justifying its existence as a Rush Limbaugh episode of Family Guy," [...] and that the episode [...] "failed to do that." [...] In the conclusion of his review Kaiser praised Family Guy for its past political humor, but ultimately rated it as a D, the second worst rating, behind The Simpsons episode [...] "Loan-a Lisa" [...] and the American Dad! episode [...] "100 A.D.", beating only The Cleveland Shows F-grade episode [...] "Cleveland Live!". In a slightly more positive review, Jason Hughes of TV Squad praised Limbaugh's appearance in the episode, commenting Limbaugh [...] "certainly deserves credit for his willingness to participate and lend his own voice." [...] Hughes went on to comment positively on the episode's debut of the high-definition opening sequence, and its introduction of Joyce Kinney {{as a replacement for}} news anchor Diane Simmons, who was killed off in [...] "And Then There Were Fewer." [...] Adam Markovitz of Entertainment Weekly wrote, [...] "The show definitely skewered Brian’s hardcore conservative conversion, but overall <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> pretty fair fight." ...|$|E

2500|$|While it was {{generally}} thought that Henry Cow took their name from 20th-century American composer Henry Cowell, this has been repeatedly denied by band members.

2500|$|Moreover, [...] "Fear and Loathing", as a phrase, {{has been}} used by many writers, the first (possibly) being Friedrich Nietzsche in The Antichrist. In a Rolling Stone {{magazine}} interview, Thompson said: [...] "It came out of my own sense of fear, and [...] a perfect description of that situation to me, however, I have been accused of stealing it from Nietzsche or Kafka or something. <b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> natural thing." ...|$|E

[...] "I thought maybe Stephan and I {{could do this}} goofy collaboration and then use the result to raise some money for Parkinson's research in honor of Richard Thompson. <b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> perfect convergence", Watterson told the Washington Post.
