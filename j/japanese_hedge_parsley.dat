50|$|Torilis japonica, the erect hedgeparsley, {{upright hedge-parsley}} or <b>Japanese</b> <b>hedge</b> <b>parsley,</b> is a plant {{species in the}} genus Torilis. Japanese Hedgeparsley is {{considered}} both an annual and biennial plant in the carrot family depending on the biogeographical location. This means Japanese Hedgeparsley can complete its life cycle in either one or two growing seasons depending on habitat. Japanese Hedgeparsley is typically found in areas with disturbed soils, pastures, margins, open woodland, near waste sites, or right-of-way habitats. It can withstand a variety of habitats, thriving in partial and full shaded areas, but also withstanding habitats with full sunlight penetration. It is considered an aggressive invasive species in North America; invading {{a wide range of}} habitats due to its environmental tolerance and tendency to outcompete native vegetation. This species is considered a threat in several areas that causes problems relating to overall environmental health and stability. Aside from its environmental implications, T. japonica has potential to fight several cancers through a terpene it produces called Torilin, extracted from its fruits.|$|E

50|$|Torilis is a genus {{of plants}} which are known {{generally}} as the <b>hedge</b> <b>parsleys.</b> They are native to Eurasia and North Africa {{but have been}} introduced to other continents. T. arvensis is quite widespread in North America but is facing population decline in the UK.|$|R
50|$|The meadow areas {{support a}} range of species which include red campion, primrose, nettle-leaved bellflower, enchanter's nightshade, garlic mustard, hedge woundwort, upright <b>hedge</b> <b>parsley</b> and green alkanet. The car park areas have been {{constructed}} of 'grass pavers' and support species such as yarrow, black medick and wild strawberry.|$|R
50|$|The {{monotypic}} genus Yabea {{contains the}} single species Yabea microcarpa, {{which is known}} by the common names California <b>hedge</b> <b>parsley</b> and false carrot. It is similar in appearance to other species of wild carrot and relatives. It is native to western North America, including the western United States, British Columbia and Baja California. It grows in many types of habitat.|$|R
50|$|Torilis arvensis is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the parsley family known by the common names spreading hedgeparsley, tall sock-destroyer and common <b>hedge</b> <b>parsley.</b> It is native to parts of Europe and it is known elsewhere, such as North America, as an introduced species and a common weed. It grows in many types of habitat, especially disturbed areas. It is an annual herb producing a slender, branching, rough-haired stem up to a meter in maximum height. The alternately arranged leaves are each divided into several pairs of lance-shaped leaflets up to 6 centimeters long each. The leaflet is divided or deeply cut into segments or teeth. The inflorescence is a wide open compound umbel of flower clusters on long, slender rays. Each flower has five petals which are unequal in size and are white with a pinkish or reddish tinge. Each greenish or pinkish fruit is 3 to 5 millimeters long and is coated in straight or curving prickles.|$|R
50|$|Alternaria Leaf Blight is a foliar {{disease of}} carrots {{caused by the}} fungus Alternaria dauci. Alternaria dauci is {{included}} in the porri species group of Alternaria, which is classified for having large conidium and a long, slender filiform beak. Because many of the members of this group have similar morphology, Alternaria dauci has also been classified as formae specialis of carrots, or A. porri f. sp. dauci. It has been well established that the host range of this disease is on cultivated and wild carrot, but it has also been claimed that Alternaria dauci has the ability to infect wild parsnip, celery, and parsley. A study in 2011 by Boedo et al. evaluated the host range of Alternaria dauci in a controlled environment and concluded that several non-carrot species could constitute alternate hosts, such as Ridolfia segetum (corn parsley) and Caucalis tenet (<b>hedge</b> <b>parsley).</b> Despite their findings, reports of A. dauci colonization on non-carrot hosts continues to be debated because the use of Koch's Postulates on recovered isolates of A. dauci is challenging and is rarely reported; in addition, few reports are often made of such infections in field settings.|$|R
40|$|The bulk of Japanese {{exports and}} imports are {{denominated}} in U. S. dollars rather than Japan’s local currency, the yen. The consequences of dollar invoicing depend importantly {{on the extent to}} which <b>Japanese</b> companies <b>hedge</b> their dollar exposures. If they fully hedge their dollar exposures, then the choice of invoicing currency will not influence the yen profits of Japanese companies. This paper examines the degree to which <b>Japanese</b> companies <b>hedge</b> by estimating their exposure to movements in the dollar. Using Japanese stock market data and an international version of the CAPM model I estimate the extent to which Japanese company returns are correlated with changes in the yen–dollar exchange rate. The results suggest many Japanese companies are indeed exposed to yen–dollar movements and that dollar appreciations generally are positively correlated with firm returns. Since over the period 1984 to 1995, the dollar depreciated by 36 % relative to the yen, it follows that the values of Japanese companies fell as a consequence of thei...|$|R

40|$|Hedges are {{expressions}} used {{to communicate}} the speaker's weak commitment to information conveyed; i. e. by hedging, speakers may moderate the assertive force of their utterances. They include sentence adverbials such as probably and technically, adjectives such as regular and typical, particles such as ne and kedo in <b>Japanese</b> etc. <b>Hedges</b> crosscut parts of speech and therefore do not form a natural syntactic class. This thesis argues that existing analyses of hedging devices fall short of full adequacy and presents a Relevance-theoretic account. In Chapter 1, I argue that hedging is a pragmatic phenomenon as the effect may be derived via features of the ostensive stimulus other than encoded linguistic content; e. g. the speaker can communicate her weak commitment by using certain prosodic features, facial expressions, shoulder shrugging etc. Discussions of hedging often arise in sociolinguistic contexts. However, I argue that the moderation of social relations such as the consideration of politeness is not its intrinsic function. The inadequacy of existing analyses I point out in Chapter 1 {{is due to the}} lack of a sufficiently articulated pragmatic framework, and for this reason, I turn to Relevance theory. In Chapter 2, I outline Relevance theory which provides a cognitively based explanation of communication. The theory makes rigorous distinctions between encoded meaning and inferred meaning, between the explicit and implicit content of an utterance, between descriptive and interpretive representations, etc. which provide the concepts necessary to isolate the semantics of the hedging devices as I explain in Chapters 3 and 4. In Chapter 3 and 4, I propose Relevance-theoretic analyses of particular English and Japanese expressions, which appear regularly in the literature on hedging. I try to capture the intrinsic semantic content of these elements and show how the familiar hedging effects arise as a result of the interaction between this encoded content, the particularities of context and considerations of relevance...|$|R
