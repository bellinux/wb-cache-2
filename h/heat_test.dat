Triple H later showed a video which revealed that he had drugged Stephanie and had taken her to Las Vegas, Nevada, where he married her in a drive-through ceremony. Stephanie then turned on Test and aligned herself with Triple H, ushering in the McMahon-Helmsley Era. Test then had a short feud with DX. On the December 6 edition of Raw, Test and Kane were defeated by Triple H and X-Pac. DX would go on to break his nose and force him into matches like a handicap match against Big Boss Man and Albert.

Three kinds of Am-MOX fuel pellets containing 3, 5 and 10 wt. % Am were prepared for the examination together with MOX fuel and UO 2 fuel pellets as references. Sintered fuel pellets were heat-treated to adjust the oxygen-to-metal ratio to 2. 00 and were crushed into small pieces. The weight gain due to oxidation was monitored and the pulverization behavior of the fuel pellets was observed. The specimens were analyzed by X-ray diffraction in order to investigate the change of the phase relation. The specimens {{were subjected}} to programmed rate <b>heating</b> <b>test</b> (6 K/min) from room temperature to 1073 K. The UO 2 pellet specimen was oxidized rapidly to an O/M ratio of 2. 67 (i. e.

40|$|Objective: Heat {{exposure}} {{has been}} shown to stimulate GH release, but the specificity and the reproducibility have not been determined, and the test has not been compared with validated GH stimulation tests in adulthood. We therefore tested the specificity and the reproducibility of the heat exposure test in healthy subjects and compared the results with those obtained with the insulin-tolerance test (ITT). Design: Ten healthy non-obese men, aged 31. 3 6 4. 80 years, underwent four GH stimulation tests in random order: two ITTs and two heat exposure tests. In the <b>heat</b> <b>test,</b> subjects were placed in a hot bath with water temperature at 40. 3 6 0. 11 8 C for 45 min, resulting in an identical (P 0. 477) significant increase in tympanic temperature of 1. 26 6 0. 05 and 1. 41 6 0. 07 8 C in the two tests. Results: Peak GH response to the heat exposure test was less than the peak GH response to ITT (5. 25 6 1. 72 vs 15. 5 6 3. 17 mg/l, P 0. 006). Furthermore the specificity (arbitrary cut-off level 3 mg/l) of the <b>heat</b> <b>test</b> was lower than of the ITT (8 / 17 vs 18 / 20, P 0. 006). The coefficient of variation did not differ between the two tests (<b>heat</b> <b>test</b> 0. 31, ITT 0. 36, P 0. 77). Peak GH values in the individual tests were highly correlated (heat, r 0. 908, P 0. 002; ITT, r 0. 815, P 0. 004). Reproducible increments in the circulating levels of stress hormones were observed during ITT, but these hormones remained largely unchanged during heat exposure. Conclusions: The heat exposure test is not a reliable GH stimulation test compared with the ITT in adults. This study documents that the ITT has a high specificity and reproducibility in the diagnosis of GH deficiency in adulthood. We propose that the heat exposure test is not used in the diagnosis of this condition in adulthood. European Journal of Endocrinology 139 605 – 61...|$|E

Our aim was to adapt the heat provocation test to the human gingiva to assess vascular reactivity in periodontal inflammation. Method: GBF was recorded by Laser Doppler Flowmetry before and after heat provocation in healthy volunteers (n = 50). Heat was generated either by warm saline or a halogen lamp. The latter method was also utilized for a <b>heat</b> <b>test</b> in non-smoking and smoking patients with periodontal inflammation. The circulatory parameters were correlated to the inflammatory marker, i. e. gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) production measured by Periotron. Results: Local application of heat caused a rapid, significant and transient increase in GBF regardless of the method used. The increase in the speed {{and not in the}} concentration of moving blood cells was responsible for increased GBF. Higher GCF values were correlated with increased peak flow, flux pulse amplitude and faster restoration of GBF after the test in non-smokers, but not in smokers.

The three tests are summarily described; they encompass a broad range of test layouts and experimental conditions. Afterwards, the following topics are examined: determination of thermal conductivity, thermally-induced pore pressure generation and thermally-induced mechanical effects. The mechanisms underlying pore pressure generation and dissipation are discussed in detail and the relationship between rock damage and thermal loading is examined using an additional in situ test: SE-H. The paper concludes with an evaluation of the various thermo-hydro-mechanical (THM) interactions identified in the <b>heating</b> <b>tests.</b> Peer ReviewedPostprint (author's final draft...|$|R
