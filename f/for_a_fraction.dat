5|$|Intent {{on making}} more money, Forbes in November 1922 began selling {{valuable}} hospital supplies under his control in large warehouses at the Perryville Depot in Maryland. The government had stockpiled huge quantities of hospital supplies {{during the first}} World War, which Forbes unloaded <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>fraction</b> of their cost to the Boston firm of Thompson and Kelly {{at a time when}} the Veterans' Bureau was buying supplies for the hospitals at a much higher price.|$|E
5|$|One {{application}} of this principle arises in a film projector. In this application, {{it is necessary to}} advance the film in a jerky, stepwise motion, in which each frame of film stops <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>fraction</b> of a second in front of the projector lens, and then much more quickly the film is moved to the next frame. This can be done using a mechanism in which the rotation of a Reuleaux triangle within a square is used to create a motion pattern for an actuator that pulls the film quickly to each new frame and then pauses the film's motion while the frame is projected.|$|E

5|$|In May 2001, Bouchard's {{successor}} Bernard Landry, who had {{until then}} {{lived in a}} three-room apartment, {{announced that he would}} accept the SITQ offer of the Édifice Price apartment, and took up occupancy in November. The choice, although praised for its symbolic location, attracted criticism that the apartment, rather small and poorly lit, could not accommodate a family (Landry was widowed from his first wife at the time). Some also noted that the former Lieutenant-Governor's residence, located at 1010 Chemin Saint-Louis and sold in 1996 <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>fraction</b> of its estimated value, would have made an excellent choice. From 1997 an exclusive psychiatric clinic had occupied the Price Building's second and third floors. This was moved out in 2002; the administration strongly affirmed the timing with the Premier's installation to be a complete coincidence.|$|E
5|$|The Solar System {{will remain}} roughly {{as we know}} it today until the {{hydrogen}} in the core of the Sun has been entirely converted to helium, which will occur roughly 5 billion years from now. This will mark the end of the Sun's main-sequence life. At this time, the core of the Sun will collapse, and the energy output will be much greater than at present. The outer layers of the Sun will expand to roughly 260 times its current diameter, and the Sun will become a red giant. Because of its vastly increased surface area, the surface of the Sun will be considerably cooler (2,600 K at its coolest) than it is on the main sequence. The expanding Sun is expected to vaporize Mercury and render Earth uninhabitable. Eventually, the core will be hot enough for helium fusion; the Sun will burn helium <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>fraction</b> of the time it burned hydrogen in the core. The Sun is not massive enough to commence the fusion of heavier elements, and nuclear reactions in the core will dwindle. Its outer layers will move away into space, leaving a white dwarf, an extraordinarily dense object, half the original mass of the Sun but only the size of Earth. The ejected outer layers will form what is known as a planetary nebula, returning some of the material that formed the Sun—but now enriched with heavier elements like carbon—to the interstellar medium.|$|E

While much of Canada's oil sands are being produced using open-pit mining, approximately 90% of Canadian oil sands and all of Venezuela's oil sands are too far below the surface to use surface mining.|$|E

25|$|This {{percolation}} {{of architectural}} style was {{not confined to}} private houses, but to civic architecture too: an illustrious architect added to civic pride; and when an architect was too expensive for the civic coffers, <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>fraction</b> of the price he would judge a competition between local architects, {{for the privilege of}} designing a town hall or church. This is exactly what happened in Aylesbury. John Vanbrugh judged two sets of plans for the County Hall (now Aylesbury Crown Court). Thus for ever Vanbrugh's name was remembered in association with the building, the local architect almost forgotten, and civic pride maintained.|$|E

Sibneft was the youngest oil holding company in Russia at the time having been created hastily in early 1995 out of Rosneft. An unknown entity, Oil Finance Corporation (NFK), that had been created out of Menatep, a holding company started by Mikhail Khodorkovsky, won the auction.

25|$|The {{quality of}} the {{finished}} transcriptions is a concern. Many outsourced transcriptionists simply {{do not have the}} requisite basic education to do the job with reasonable accuracy, as well as additional, occupation-specific training in medical transcription. Many foreign MTs who can speak English are not familiar with American expressions and/or the slang doctors often use, and can be unfamiliar with American names and places. An MT editor, certainly, is then responsible for all work transcribed from these countries and under these conditions. These outsourced transcriptionists often work <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>fraction</b> of what transcriptionists are paid in the United States, even with the US MTs daily accepting lower and lower rates. However, some firms choose to employ American transcriptionists as they believe the quality of work is better.|$|E
25|$|Since German {{universities}} do {{not offer}} accommodation or meals, {{students are expected to}} organize and pay for board and lodging themselves.
