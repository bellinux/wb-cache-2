40|$|Coastal {{resources}} in Tanzania {{have come under}} increasing pressure {{over the past three}} decades, which has led to a significant decline in the biodiversity and productivity of coastal ecosystems. The livelihoods of coastal communities that directly depend on these resources are consequently under increasing threat and vulnerability. Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are one tool for managing coastal and marine resources that have been increasingly used in Tanzania. Promotion of alternative income generating activities (AIGA) is often a component of MPA management strategies to reduce fishing pressure and address poverty concerns. However, empirical evidence on whether these AIGA are successful in reducing pressure on fisheries, or their impact on poverty, is scarce and inconclusive. This paper seeks to contribute to this debate by investigating the linkages between household characteristics, MPA activities, and household choice of <b>fishing</b> <b>gear.</b> The empirical analysis is based on household survey data from a sample of villages located along the coast of mainland Tanzania and Zanzibar. We find that some aspects of poverty increase the likelihood of using destructive <b>fishing</b> <b>gear.</b> MPAs do not directly affect household choice of <b>fishing</b> <b>gear.</b> However, households participating in AIGA are less likely to use destructive <b>fishing</b> <b>gear,</b> suggesting that MPA support to these activities in Tanzania has a positive influence on household choice of <b>fishing</b> <b>gear.</b> We also find the use of destructive <b>fishing</b> <b>gear</b> is associated with higher consumption levels, whereas participation in AIGA does not significantly affect household consumption levels...|$|R

This capstone review paper examines the environmental impacts, legislation, and current investigations of marine debris, especially derelict <b>fishing</b> <b>gear,</b> and outlines recommendations to alleviate this problem. Derelict <b>fishing</b> <b>gear</b> refers to any type of net, line, rope, trap, or buoy used in commercial fishing that has become lost or intentionally discarded. This category of marine debris may contribute significantly to the mortality of marine pinnipeds, sea turtles, seabirds, and fishes, which can become entangled or ingest the debris. Damage can also occur to coral reefs, and humans are potentially threatened via fouling to vessel propulsion systems and entanglement of divers. Thus, this paper examines in particular {{the environmental impact of}} derelict <b>fishing</b> <b>gear</b> on marine species, especially endangered or threatened animals, and on reefs. Does it affect commercial vessels and divers? Has the International Convention for the Prevention of Marine Pollution from Ships, 1973, as modified by the protocol of 1978 (MARPOL 73 / 78), had any effect on the amount of derelict <b>fishing</b> <b>gear</b> and marine species entanglements since the inception in 1989 of Annex V to MARPOL 73 / 78 ?
