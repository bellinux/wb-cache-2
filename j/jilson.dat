5000|$|In 1926, Day was {{discovered}} by promoter and folklorist Jean Bell Thomas, who was fascinated that rural folk musicians like Day possessed traits that had been passed down from their Elizabethan English forebears relatively unaltered, especially in their renditions of folk ballads. Thomas decided to manage Day, creating and documenting a persona almost entirely fabricated from her. According to Thomas's story, Day, who {{changed his name to}} <b>Jilson</b> Setters per her suggestion, was blind from birth, lived in isolation in the mountains, and gained his eyesight only recently, thanks to a procedure that Thomas financed. Moreover, with his ability to see, Setters was shocked by the appearance of the civilized world. Setters recorded ten sides for RCA Records in New York City, including the [...] "The Wild Wagoner", which has become a standard in traditional folk repertoires.|$|E

Paulo {{is one of}} the two young men from the indigenous homeland of Terra Indígena do Rio Humaita who participate in the linguistic workshop held by Eliane Camargo - assisted by Sabine Reiter. The story-telling was elicited by working through an old text about the vulture and the monkey which was recorded by the Brazilian historian Capistrano de Abreu 100 years earlier. According to Capistrano, this text does not belong to the oral tradition of the Cashinahua. Paulo's story does belong to the oral tradition of his people.
