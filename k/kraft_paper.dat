5|$|With {{access to}} wood from the Quantock Hills, {{records show that}} paper making was {{established}} by 1652. In the 15th century, a flour mill was established by the Fulford and Hadley families {{near the mouth of}} the Washford River. By 1587 the Wyndham estate had established a fulling and grist mill to the south west. By 1652, the mill had started to produce paper. In 1846 business partners James Date, William Peach and John Wansbrough bought the business and introduced mechanised-production using a water wheel-powered pulley system. In the 1860s, the factory was converted to steam power and the local harbour was used to import raw materials and export finished goods. Most of the mill was destroyed by fire in 1889 but it was rebuilt and less than ten years later five paper making machines were operating. The mill became the largest manufacturer of paper bags in the UK. In 1896, the business became the Wansbrough Paper Company, a limited liability company and is now known as the Wansbrough Paper Mill. With an annual capacity of 180,000 tonnes of product and employing 100 people, it is the UK's largest manufacturer of coreboard, and also produces containerboard, recycled envelope, bag and <b>kraft</b> <b>papers.</b> In December 2015 the paper mill ceased production and closed.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. To enhance {{printing}} qualities, {{this study}} used refluxed silica (SiO 2) from rice husk by hydrochloric acid (HCl) at different molarities and reaction times as coating agent for printed paper. Characterization of the refluxed silica from 2 M HCl 120 min elucidated the purity of 98. 7 % and amorphous structure. Particle size of the silica exhibited uniform size of 3 μm and the color measurement (CIE L*a*b*) indicated 94. 79 + 0. 48 + 1. 24, whiteness and color difference (∆E) were 84. 85, 3. 28, respectively. The coating agent was prepared by water-based varnish of acrylic resin mixed with the synthesized silica at different proportions: 0. 0, 0. 5, 1. 0, and 1. 5 (%wt), and later was applied on 170 g/m 2 -white <b>kraft</b> <b>papers.</b> The {{results showed that the}} water-based coating varnish with silica exhibited an increase of viscosity as increasing the amount of the silica. Printing qualities indicated that the vanished printed paper with 1. 0 % silica elucidated the highest details in shadow tone and text (font) sharpness. The color gamut yielded a wider scope than the printed papers which were varnished with the silica at 0. 0 %, 0. 5 % and 1. 5 %. Nonetheless, the color density showed insignificant difference to 1. 5 % silica varnished paper...|$|R

Qualitative and quantitative evidence of CuxS were obtained from bulk and surface analyses of insulating paper provided by the different depth resolution of the techniques used. The influence of [DBDS], oxygen, time, and Cu-paper contact upon the formation and mobilisation of CuxS were studied. A contact-based mechanism to explain CuxS contamination on paper and its displacement was proposed. The role of O 2 in enhancing CuxS displacement was also investigated...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe role of {{anthraquinone}} (AQ) greatly {{depends on}} the nature of the cellulosic pulp during alkali refining. AQ acts in two ways; firstly penetration within the molecular chains separating them further apart leading to their decrystallisation; secondly stabilization of the polysaccharide chains. Cotton linter is known by its long macromolecular crystalline chains. The cold refining helps the swelling cotton linter and the penetration of AQ leads to decrystallisation of linter even at low AQ concentration (namely 0. 025 %). In comparison with <b>paper</b> <b>Kraft</b> pulp AQ does not reflect a considerable change on its characteristics, except on hot refining using higher AQ concentration (namely 0. 2 %). This is due to the nature opening structure of the <b>paper</b> <b>Kraft</b> pulp in addition to the hemicellulose content which preferentially stabilized by AQ giving a reasonable increase in the pentosan content. This is associated by improving in the reactivity towards xanthation...|$|R
