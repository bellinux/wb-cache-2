5|$|The Solar System's {{planets and}} officially {{recognized}} dwarf planets {{are known to}} be orbited by 184 natural satellites, or moons. 19 moons in the Solar System are large enough to be gravitationally rounded, and thus would be considered planets or dwarf planets <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> direct orbit around the Sun.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, Norberto Fontana {{claimed in}} an {{interview}} with the Argentinian newspaper Olé that a few hours before the Grand Prix the Ferrari team director Jean Todt visited the Sauber motorhome and told the Swiss team, which used Ferrari engines at the time, that the Saubers must block Jacques Villeneuve <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> a position to do so in order to help Michael Schumacher win the World Championship.|$|E

5|$|William Herschel {{discovered}} {{the first two}} moons, Titania and Oberon, in 1787, {{and the other three}} ellipsoidal moons were discovered in 1851 by William Lassell (Ariel and Umbriel) and in 1948 by Gerard Kuiper (Miranda). These five have planetary mass, and so would be considered (dwarf) planets <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> direct orbit about the Sun. The remaining moons were discovered after 1985, either during the Voyager 2 flyby mission or with the aid of advanced Earth-based telescopes.|$|E
5|$|After trying {{that for}} a while and with no land in sight, Taylor decided that it was {{impossible}} for them to fly so far west and not reach Florida. He believed that he might have been near the Key West Islands. What followed was a series of serious confusions between Taylor, his team and the control tower. Taylor was not sure whether he was near Bahama or Key West, and he was not sure which direction was which due to compass malfunction. The control tower informed Taylor that he could not be in Key West since the wind that day did not blow that way. Some of his teammates believed that their compass was working. Taylor then set a course northeast according to their compass, which should take them to Florida <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> Key West. When that failed, Taylor set a course west according to their compass, which should take them to Florida <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> Bahama. If Taylor stayed this course he would have reached land before running out of fuel. However, at some point Taylor decided that he had tried going west enough. He then once again set a course northeast, thinking they were near Key West after all. Finally, his flight ran out of fuel and may have crashed into the ocean somewhere north of Abaco Island and east of Florida.|$|E
5|$|Of Jupiter's moons, eight are regular {{satellites}} with prograde {{and nearly}} circular orbits {{that are not}} greatly inclined with respect to Jupiter's equatorial plane. The Galilean satellites are nearly spherical in shape due to their planetary mass, and so would be considered (dwarf) planets <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> direct orbit around the Sun. The other four regular satellites are much smaller and closer to Jupiter; these serve as sources of the dust that makes up Jupiter's rings. The remainder of Jupiter's moons are irregular satellites whose prograde and retrograde orbits are much farther from Jupiter and have high inclinations and eccentricities. These moons were probably captured by Jupiter from solar orbits. Eighteen of the irregular satellites {{have not yet been}} named.|$|E

25|$|Aside {{from the}} {{properties}} described in articles about electromagnetism, charge is a relativistic invariant. This means that any particle that has charge Q, {{no matter how}} fast it goes, always has charge Q. This property has been experimentally verified by showing that the charge of one helium nucleus (two protons and two neutrons bound together in a nucleus and moving around at high speeds) {{is the same as}} two deuterium nuclei (one proton and one neutron bound together, but moving much more slowly than they would <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> a helium nucleus).|$|E

25|$|In May 2012, Celtic {{were rated}} 37th in Brand Finance's annual {{valuation}} of the world's biggest football clubs. Celtic's brand was valued at $64million (£40.7million), $15million {{more than the}} previous year. It {{was the first time}} a Scottish club had been ranked in the top 50. Matt Hannagan, Sports Brand Valuation Analyst at Brand Finance, said that Celtic were constrained by the amount of money they got from the SPL and that <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> the Premiership then, due to their large fan base, they could be in the top 10 clubs in the world. Later that month David Low, the financial consultant who advised Fergus McCann on his takeover of Celtic in 1994, said that Celtic's 'enterprise value' (how much it would cost to buy the club) was £52million.|$|E
25|$|The {{continuous}} interplay (exchange or trade) done {{by economic}} actors in all markets sets the prices for all {{goods and services}} which, in turn, make the rational managing of scarce resources possible. At the same time, the decisions (choices) made by the same actors, while they are pursuing their own interest, determine the level of output (production), consumption, savings, and investment, in an economy, {{as well as the}} remuneration (distribution) paid to the owners of labour (in the form of wages), capital (in the form of profits) and land (in the form of rent). Each period, as <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> a giant feedback system, economic players influence the pricing processes and the economy, and are in turn influenced by them until a steady state (equilibrium) of all variables involved is reached or until an external shock throws the system toward a new equilibrium point. Because of the autonomous actions of rational interacting agents, the economy is a complex adaptive system.|$|E
25|$|On 25 October, at {{a meeting}} of the Commonwealth Executive Council, Hughes decided to issue another decree. The meeting was poorly attended, with mostly anti-conscription members of the cabinet present – Edward Russell (Assistant Minister), Albert Gardiner (Treasurer), Jens Jensen (Navy), and the Treasurer William Higgs. However, Hughes tabled a {{proposal}} to authorise returning officers on polling day to ask voters who were men between ages 21 and 35 whether they had evaded the call-up and <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> fact authorised to vote. If their answer was not satisfactory, their votes would be put aside for future consideration as to whether they should be counted. The proclamation of this new regulation was to be delayed until the very last possible moment before the poll. Hughes seems to have been completely unaware of how high-handed such an edict appeared to his fellow Cabinet members, and to the public in general. The Executive Council rejected the proposal on that occasion. On 27 October, Hughes reconvened the Council, with the Governor-General present, as well as Jensen and Webster, but not the three previous attendees. This time the Council approved the motion, although the Governor-General was not told about the rejection of the same proposal two days earlier. The edict was published in the Government Gazette that evening.|$|E

25|$|By 1940, {{the average}} {{production}} {{cost of an}} American feature was $400,000, a negligible increase over ten years. A number of small Hollywood companies had folded {{around the turn of}} the decade, including the ambitious Grand National, but a new firm, Producers Releasing Corporation (PRC), emerged as third in the Poverty Row hierarchy behind Republic and Monogram. The double feature, never universal, was still the prevailing exhibition model: in 1941, 50 percent of theaters were double-billing exclusively, with additional numbers screening under the policy part-time. In the early 1940s, legal pressure forced the studios to replace seasonal block booking with packages generally limited to five pictures (MGM carried on with blocks of twelve for a while). Restrictions were also placed on the majors' ability to enforce blind bidding. These were crucial factors in the progressive shift by most of the Big Five over to A-film production, making the smaller studios even more important as B-movie suppliers. In 1944, for instance, MGM, Paramount, Fox, and Warners released a total of ninety-five features: fourteen had B-level budgets of $200,000 or less; eleven were budgeted between $200,000 and $500,000, a range encompassing programmers as well as straight B movies on the lower end; and seventy were A budgeted at $0.5 million or more. In late 1946, executives at the newly merged Universal-International announced that no U-I feature would run less than seventy minutes; supposedly, all B pictures were to be discontinued, even <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> the midst of production. The studio did release three more sub-70-minute films: two Cinecolor westerns, Michigan Kid and The Vigilantes Return, in 1947; the self-explanatory Arctic Manhunt in 1949. Fox also phased out B production in 1946, releasing low-budget unit chief Bryan Foy, who had come over from Warners five years before. For its B-picture needs, the studio turned to independent producers like the now-freelance Sol Wurtzel.|$|E
