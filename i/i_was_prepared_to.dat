500|$|Dunst {{was treated}} for {{depression}} in early 2008 at the Cirque Lodge treatment center in Utah. She explained {{that she had been}} feeling low in the six months before her admission. In late March 2008, she checked out of the treatment center and began filming the mystery drama All Good Things. In May 2008, she went public with this information in order to dispel rumors of drug and alcohol abuse, stating that [...] "Now that I’m feeling stronger, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> say something … Depression is pretty serious and should not be gossiped about".|$|E
500|$|As {{a result}} of these rumours and arguments, the belief {{strengthened}} among the British establishment that Simpson could not become a royal consort. British Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin explicitly advised Edward that the majority of people would be opposed to his marrying Simpson, indicating that if he did, in direct contravention of his ministers' advice, the government would resign en masse. The King responded, according to his own account later: [...] "I intend to marry Mrs. Simpson as soon as she is free to marry... if the Government opposed the marriage, as the Prime Minister had given me reason to believe it would, then <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> go." [...] Under pressure from the King, and [...] "startled" [...] at the suggested abdication, Baldwin agreed to take further soundings on three options: ...|$|E

500|$|Sheen reprised {{the role}} of David Frost in 2008's Frost/Nixon, a film dramatisation of The Nixon Interviews of 1977. Despite {{appearing}} in the original stage production in a part written for him by Peter Morgan, Sheen was surprised to have been cast in the film: [...] "Peter said he'd only be prepared to give the rights to someone who would cast me as Frost, which was very nice, but when the studios {{get their hands on}} something... Right up until we started filming <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> be disappointed". Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times asserted that Sheen embodied his character in a [...] "compelling, intense" [...] performance while The Wall Street Journal felt he was [...] "a brilliant actor" [...] who [...] "grows his character from a bright-eyed social butterfly to a gimlet-eyed interrogator". However, The New York Times felt [...] "the likable, watchable Mr. Sheen has been pitted against a scene-stealer" [...] in Frank Langella's Nixon. Frost himself later said it was [...] "a wonderful performance". Sheen was the recipient of the Variety Award at the British Independent Film Awards 2008.|$|E
500|$|In late 1969, Genesis {{retreated to}} a cottage that Macphail's parents owned in Wotton, Surrey to write, rehearse, and develop their stage performance. They adopted a strong working ethic, playing {{together}} {{for as much}} as eleven hours a day. Their first live gig as Genesis followed in September 1969 at a teenager's birthday. It was the start of a series of live shows in small venues across the UK which included a radio appearance on BBC's Night Ride show, on 22 February 1970 and a spot at the Atomic Sunrise Festival held at the Roundhouse in Chalk Farm a month later. During this time, the band met with various record labels regarding contract offers. Initial discussions with Chris Blackwell of Island and Chris Wright of Chrysalis were unsuccessful. In March 1970, during the band's six-week Tuesday night residency at Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club in Soho, members of Rare Bird, who Genesis had supported earlier, recommended the band to producer and A man John Anthony of Charisma Records. Anthony attended one of their shows and enjoyed them enough to convince his boss, label owner Tony Stratton-Smith, to watch their next appearance. Stratton-Smith recalled, [...] "Their potential was immediately apparent ... the material was good and their performance was good ... It was a long shot, because they needed time to find their strength ... but <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> make that commitment". Stratton-Smith agreed to a record and management deal within two weeks, paying Genesis an initial sum of £10 a week (equivalent to £ in [...] )..|$|E

Fortunately, there were not many of those hours." [...] Geary stated, [...] "It just wasn't anything that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> deal with as an actor, because I was in daytime. We were international celebrities but still considered small-screen." [...] Geary continued, [...] "People didn't take it seriously and those that did took it too seriously.

2500|$|He {{became a}} regular {{member of the}} royal council in 1530. In 1535 he set up the Chambre Ardente. In 1536 he was {{entrusted}} with an embassy to Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor. [...] He met the Emperor, who was travelling north to Genoa, at Siena on 24 April 1536. [...] He spent three days with the Emperor explaining the concessions which Francis <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> make, but Charles was prepared for war, and rejected the French overtures. [...] After a quick trip to Rome to inform the Pope {{of the situation and}} to discover what the Pope's intentions were, Jean de Lorraine headed back north toward Bologna to try one last time to argue peace to the Emperor. [...] The Pope, who was trying to maintain neutrality, sent legates to both sovereigns on 29 April to argue for peace, but it was without effect. [...] The invasion of southern France by the Emperor was inevitable.|$|E
2500|$|In January 2008, it was {{announced}} that Lords had been cast in Kevin Smith's comedy Zack and Miri Make a Porno (2008). She said that at first she wanted to refuse but changed her mind after reading the script. [...] "It was really great that in taking the movie, because I didn't plan on going back to work right away, but I was dying to work with Kevin. I never thought it would be on something called Zack and Miri Make a Porno. What? So I went and I read the script at his house and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> say no. I thought I have the perfect out. I just had a kid. No one is going to blame me if I say I just can't do this right now. But it made me laugh out loud and it made me just literally cry. It was just funny." [...] Initially, Lords had a topless scene in the movie, but refused since she would breastfeed in between the takes. Katie Morgan, another former pornographic actress, also appeared in the film.|$|E

The concept of nonviolence (ahimsa) and nonresistance has a long history in Indian religious thought and has had many revivals in Hindu, Buddhist, Jain, Jewish and Christian contexts. Gandhi explains his philosophy and way of life in his autobiography The Story of My Experiments with Truth.
