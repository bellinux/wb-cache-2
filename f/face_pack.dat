Basically it is a theyyam (a popular ritual form of worship of North Malabar), {{with the image of}} a cow-face attached to mid part of the body. Usually a boy is selected to do this. Special hair work, <b>face</b> <b>pack,</b> and costumes accompany this. Paniyas also assist the main character. It is believed that, after this play, the country becomes prosperous with more yields and increased number of livestock. With drum patterns serving as the music, the speech is both socially conscious and humorous.|$|E

The study involved analyzing the axial vibration of the flexible ring for two configurations of its housing in the seal and determining the frequency characteristics and the condition of maintaining face-to-face contact between the sealing rings with considerably different elastic properties subjected to two types of external excitations. The derived analytical relationships were verified using a calculation example for real operating conditions of <b>face</b> <b>packing</b> seal in the pump...|$|R

40|$|Background: There have {{recently}} been reports suggesting that sensitization to food allergens may occur outside the intestinal tract, especially through the skin. To clarify the role of epicutaneous sensitization in food allergy, we investigated the clinical characteristics of adult patients with food allergies preceded by contact urticaria due to the same foods. Methods: We investigated clinical characteristics of 15 patients (20 – 51 years of age; 5 men and 10 women), who had food allergies preceded by contact urticaria. Results: Fourteen patients were contact urticaria due to the causative foods during occupationally cooking, whereas 1 patient during <b>face</b> <b>pack.</b> In the occupational group, causative foods included rice, wheat, fruits, vegetables, fish, shrimp and cuttlefish; in the fresh cucumber paste case the cause was cucumber. In the 15 patients, the causative foods were fresh, not processed, and were tolerated by most (9 / 15, 60 %) after heating. Regarding to symptoms after ingestion of the causative foods, the most frequently induced symptoms was oral symptoms (14 / 15, 93. 3 %), followed by urticaria (4 / 15, 26. 7 %), abdominal symptoms (3 / 15, 20 %). The duration between the start of jobs or <b>face</b> <b>pack,</b> and the onset of contact urticaria was from 1 month to 19 years (mean, 8. 7 years). The duration between the onset of contact urticaria and the onset of food allergy was from {{a few weeks to}} 6 years (mean, 11 months). One sushi cook experienced severe anaphylactic shock after ingestion of fish. In the occupational group, 13 of 15 patients (86. 7 %) had atopic dermatitis or hand eczema, indicating that the impaired skin barrier might be a risk for food allergies induced by epicutaneous sensitization. Conclusions: Epicutaneous sensitization of foods could induce food allergy under occupational cooking and skin-care treatment with foods in adults...|$|E

40|$|Six transmembrane segments, S 1 –S 6, cluster {{around the}} central pore-forming region in {{voltage-gated}} K+ channels. To investigate the structural {{characteristics of the}} S 2 segment in the Shaker K+ channel, we replaced each residue in S 2 singly with tryptophan (or with alanine for the native tryptophan). All {{but one of the}} 23 Trp mutants expressed voltage-dependent K+ currents in Xenopus oocytes. The effects of the mutations were classified as being of low or high impact on channel gating properties. The periodicity evident in the effects of these mutations supports an α-helical structure for the S 2 segment. The high- and low-impact residues cluster onto opposite faces of a helical wheel projection of the S 2 segment. The low-impact face is also tolerant of single mutations to asparagine. All results are consistent with the idea that the low-impact face projects toward membrane lipids and that changes in S 2 packing occur upon channel opening. We conclude that the S 2 segment is a transmembrane α helix and that the high-impact <b>face</b> <b>packs</b> against other transmembrane segments in the functional channel...|$|R

40|$|The {{electronic}} {{structures and}} charge transport properties of 1, 3, 5 -tripyrrolebenzene (TPB) and its substituted derivatives with –F and –CN {{groups have been}} investigated by DFT calculations {{in combination with the}} Marcus hopping model. The dimer geometry was optimized by density functional theory method with dispersion force correction being included (DFT-D). Consequently, the charge transfer integral was evaluated. The calculation results show that the introduction of electron-withdrawing substituents does not significantly change the bond lengths and molecular symmetry of TPB, but lower the coplanarity between the pyrrole and benzene rings, {{especially in the case of}} CN substitution. Meanwhile, the introduction of electron-withdrawing groups can decrease the energy of the frontier molecular orbital and enhance the air stability. Fluorination makes the λe increase obviously while cyanation dose not. Generally speaking, the λe values of the title compounds are larger than their λh. Except for compounds 6 and 9, all others keep the <b>face</b> to <b>face</b> <b>packing</b> or have a slight slip in dimers, but the center of mass distances increase after fluorination or cyanation due to the distortion of the monomer’s coplanarity. The predicted quasi-one-dimensional electron mobility of the dimers is up to 0. 433 cm 2 V - 1 s - 1 at 298. 15 K. The electron injection barriers of 2 and 7 are lower than that of TPB. The TPB derivatives of 1, 2, and 7 are potential n-channel materials with the high electron mobility. This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4. 0 International License...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to present a {{theoretical}} study of the aerosol penetration through an electret fibrous filter, using a numerical approach. The aerosol sizes considered in this study were in the submicron range, and in the numerical model, the conventional mechanical mechanisms (impaction, interception, diffusion and gravitationally settling) were taken into consideration along with the electrostatic mechanisms, including the Coulombic and dielectrophoretic effects. The aerosol penetration through an electret fibrous filter is heavily dependent on the aerosol penetration of a single fibre. The aerosol penetration through a single electret fibre under various filtration conditions was calculated. The effects of aerosol diameter, aerosol and fibre charge state, <b>face</b> velocity, <b>packing</b> density and aerosol dielectric constant on the aerosol penetration were investigated.

40|$|Linear {{peptides}} {{derived from}} the membrane proximal region of the gp 41 ectodomain are effective inhibitors of HIV type 1 (HIV- 1) -mediated fusion events. These inhibitory peptides lack structure in solution, rendering mechanistic interpretation of their activity difficult. Using structurally constrained analogs of these molecules, we demonstrate that the peptides inhibit infectivity by adopting a helical conformation. Moreover, we show that a specific face of the helix must be exposed to block viral infectivity. Recent crystal structures show that the region of gp 41 corresponding to the inhibitory peptides is helical and uses the analogous <b>face</b> to <b>pack</b> against a groove formed by an N-terminal coiled-coil trimer. Our results provide a direct link between the inhibition of HIV- 1 infectivity by these peptides and the x-ray structures, and suggest that the conformation of gp 41 observed by crystallography represents the fusogenic state. Other agents that block HIV- 1 infectivity by binding to this groove may hold promise {{for the treatment of}} AIDS...|$|R
