5|$|One {{of the few}} {{groups that}} were never thought to be piscivores are the anurognathids; these were instead thought to be nocturnal, aerial insectivores, a view still {{maintained}} today. With <b>highly</b> <b>flexible</b> joints on the wing finger, a broad, triangular wing shape, large eyes and short tail, these pterosaurs were analogous to some of today's insectivorous bats, being capable of high manoeuvrability at relatively low speeds.|$|E
5|$|A herbivore, the bohor reedbuck prefers {{grasses and}} tender reed shoots with high protein and low fiber content. This reedbuck is {{dependent}} on water, though green pastures can fulfill its water requirement. The social structure of the bohor reedbuck is <b>highly</b> <b>flexible.</b> Large aggregations are observed during the dry season, when hundreds of bohor reedbuck assemble near a river. Males become sexually mature {{at the age of}} three to four years, while females can conceive at just one year of age, reproducing every nine to fourteen months. Though there is no fixed breeding season, mating peaks in the rainy season. The gestation period is seven and a half months long, after which a single calf is born. The calves are weaned at eight to nine months of age.|$|E

5|$|All serpins share {{a common}} {{structure}} (or fold), despite their varied functions. All typically have three β-sheets (named A, B and C) and eight or nine α-helices (named hA–hI). The most significant regions to serpin function are the A-sheet and the reactive centre loop (RCL). The A-sheet includes two β-strands that are in a parallel orientation with a region between them called the 'shutter', and upper region called the 'breach'. The RCL forms the initial interaction with the target protease in inhibitory molecules. Structures have been solved showing the RCL either fully exposed or partially inserted into the A-sheet, and serpins {{are thought to be}} in dynamic equilibrium between these two states. The RCL also only makes temporary interactions {{with the rest of the}} structure, and is therefore <b>highly</b> <b>flexible</b> and exposed to the solvent.|$|E

25|$|Some {{octopuses}} can use {{muscles in}} the skin to change both the colour and texture of their mantle to achieve a greater camouflage. In some species, the mantle can take on the spiky appearance of seaweed, or the scraggly, bumpy texture of a rock, among other disguises.

25|$|Transfers between {{units were}} forbidden. The leaders on each level had {{significant}} license to execute their orders {{in the way}} they considered best. This command structure proved to be <b>highly</b> <b>flexible</b> and allowed the Mongol army to attack en masse, divide into somewhat smaller groups to encircle and lead enemies into an ambush, or divide into small groups of 10 to mop up a fleeing and broken army. Individual soldiers were responsible for their equipment, weapons, and up to five mounts, although they fought as part of a unit.

40|$|We {{report on}} <b>highly</b> {{efficient}} <b>flexible</b> inverted organic solar cells (IOSCs) fabricated by low-temperature solution process on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate. In general, IOSCs {{have been required}} to use an annealed (> 200. °C) zinc oxide (ZnO) as an electron transport layer. However, any twisting of the flexible substrate during heat treatment leads to poor device performance. To overcome this issue, we developed a novel low temperature process for flexible IOSCs using an alcohol-/water-soluble conjugated polymer, namely poly [(9, 9 -bis(3 '-(N,N-dimethylamino) propyl) - 2, 7 -fluorene) -alt- 2, 7 -(9, 9 -dioctylfluorene) ] (PFN) instead of the ZnO.

25|$|Like other Ichthyosaurs, Temnodontosaurus {{species were}} fast cruisers or swimmers. Jurassic Ichthyosaurs, like Temnodontosaurus species, swim with lateral {{oscillation}} of their caudal fluke on a flexible tail stock.

40|$|In this paper, {{we report}} a novel {{selective}} laser sintering of TiO 2 nanoparticle (Degussa P 25) film on plastic conductive substrates for <b>highly</b> efficient <b>flexible</b> dye-sensitized solar cell (DSC) applications. The so-called "selective sintering" means that the absorbed laser energy can effectively promote the electrical contacts between the TiO 2 nanoparticles, but does not cause damage to the plastic conductive substrate. The choice of the near-infrared (wavelength = 1064 nm) laser source is critical for {{the effectiveness of the}} laser sintering. The laser sintering technology can effectively decrease electron transport resistance and increase recombination resistance of the TiO 2 nanoparticle film characterized by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and transient photovoltage/photocurrent decay measurements, resulting in much improved charge collection efficiency. Thus, compared to the reference sample, the laser sintered film has achieved an improved short-circuit current density from 9. 2 to 10. 4 mA cm(- 2), fill factor from 0. 71 to 0. 77, and solar conversion efficiency from 4. 5 % to 5. 7 %. The fast and effective {{selective laser sintering}} technique has great potential to be integrated into scalable roll-to-roll manufacturing of <b>highly</b> efficient <b>flexible</b> DSCs...|$|R
