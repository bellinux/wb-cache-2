5|$|Like many working dogs, the Australian Cattle Dog {{has high}} energy levels, an active mind, and {{a level of}} independence. The breed ranks 10th in Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs, rated {{as one of the}} most {{intelligent}} dogs ranked by obedience command trainability. The Cattle Dog needs plenty of exercise, companionship and a <b>job</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> so a non-working dog might participate in dog sports, learning tricks, or other activities that engage its body and mind.|$|E
5|$|The Field Spaniel {{can be a}} {{good family}} dog while it has a <b>job</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> They are {{suitable}} for dog agility and hunting. Without some sort of purpose, the dog can often try to amuse itself and cause mischief. However, they are patient with children and like to stay close to their family. When socialised, they are good with other dogs. They are generally docile and independent, and are not as excitable as Cocker Spaniels. Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs lists the breed as being above average in working intelligence.|$|E

25|$|Duck Tollers {{are working}} animals and are happiest {{when they have}} a <b>job</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> Tollers are {{excellent}} hunting companions. They excel at many types of sporting competitions, such as agility, dock diving and obedience. Their keen sense of smell, intelligence, drive to work, and small size, make them perfect search and rescue dogs. The breed standard states that the dog should have a strong retrieving drive, intense birdiness, endurance and a love for water.|$|E
25|$|The {{activity}} {{level in the}} Greater Swiss Mountain Dog is variable. They are capable of being athletic, but usually that activity is in bursts; they are active for {{short periods of time}} followed by napping. They want to be with their owners and to participate; their {{activity level}} most often matches the activity level of the family. As a working dog, they like having a <b>job</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> and enjoy participating in hiking, carting, obedience trials, herding, weight pulling and backpacking with their owners.|$|E
25|$|After Misbah-ul-Haq {{retired from}} ODIs, The Pakistan Cricket board {{had a tough}} <b>job</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> while {{appointing}} Misbah's successor. The potential candidates were either too inconsistent or had some disciplinary issues. Sarfraz Ahmed gave the selectors a long thought but the board finally decided to go in favor of Azhar Ali who hadn't played ODI cricket for almost 2 years {{at the time of}} his appointment. While this decision was opposed by many, Azhar Ali seemed determined to take the Pakistani team right on top.|$|E

25|$|England and Australia {{drew the}} match. England were happy {{that they had}} saved the Test, but their batting was still weak with only Graveney, May and Cowdrey capable of playing Benaud's leg-spin with any confidence. Trueman had bowled well without any luck and Laker and Lock had shown their {{spinning}} skills, but the English fielding needed to be improved. Benaud was criticised for his defensive tactics, but {{said he had a}} <b>job</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> and 2â€“0 up was good for him and his team.|$|E

During another appearance by Cheney on May 19, 2006, on the Late Show with David Letterman, Letterman brought {{up some of the}} issues raised by the gay community. He asked Cheney why she had waited two years after the 2004 election to speak publicly about gay marriage and rights, and asked whether she had any input with the Bush administration regarding gay issues. Cheney responded that she did not, and that it had not been her <b>job</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so.|$|E

[...] Anti-pornography activist Phil Burress told the Associated Press that a race between Schmidt and McEwen would be tough. [...] "They are two totally different types of personalities.

500|$|According to a 2007 blue-ribbon panel, {{the cost}} overruns of the Big Dig, {{combined}} with Baker's plan for financing them, ultimately left the state transportation system underfunded by $1 billion a year. Baker defended his plan as responsible, effective, {{and based on}} previous government officials' good-faith assurances that the Big Dig would be built on time and on budget. However, as he was developing the plan, Baker had also had {{to take into account}} that Governor Cellucci was dead-set against any new taxes or fees. Former State Transportation Secretary James J. Kerasiotes, the public face of the Big Dig, praised Baker's work on the financing and said, [...] "We were caught in a confluence of events," [...] adding that [...] "Charlie had a <b>job</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> and he did his job and he did it well".|$|E
500|$|The {{desire to}} move away from random {{encounters}} was present since the beginning of development. This desire fueled the development of the Active Dimension Battle system so players could seamlessly move from battle to exploration. The gambit system was conceived early on as a way to facilitate this change. Battle system designer Hiroshi Tomomatsu states that it gradually moved away from a complex and rigid formula to the more flexible form seen in {{the final version of the}} game. Ito drew inspiration for gambits from plays in American football where each team member has a specific <b>job</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> based on the conditions and desired outcome. As for the license system, he explained that needing [...] "licenses" [...] to perform certain actions was a natural extension of the rigid structured society of Archadia, as epitomized by its Judges.|$|E
500|$|The {{theme of}} racial {{injustice}} appears symbolically {{in the novel}} as well. For example, Atticus must shoot a rabid dog, {{even though it is}} not his <b>job</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. Carolyn Jones argues that the dog represents prejudice within the town of Maycomb, and Atticus, who waits on a deserted street to shoot the dog, must fight against the town's racism without help from other white citizens. He is also alone when he faces a group intending to lynch Tom Robinson and once more in the courthouse during Tom's trial. Lee even uses dreamlike imagery from the mad dog incident to describe some of the courtroom scenes. Jones writes, [...] "he real mad dog in Maycomb is the racism that denies the humanity of Tom Robinson.... When Atticus makes his summation to the jury, he literally bares himself to the jury's and the town's anger." ...|$|E

On playing Harry as {{a figment of}} Dexter's imagination, James Remar told Vanity Fair that [...] "it's {{challenging}} to play a specter in somebodyâ€™s current existence." [...] He said: [...] "In my own life, I find myself doing some task [...] and {{having a conversation with}} my mother or father, who are both deceased. [...] I suspect lots of people do it. And when I hold that conversation, different images of my parents appear to me. And so it's my <b>job</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> my best to be that image in Dexter's mind." [...] When asked about playing the only character to join Dexter in his [...] "kill room," [...] Jimmy Smits said: [...] "The crew has a great respect for what they are doing in those scenes. They are energized because those moments are the staple of the show, {{but at the same time}} they are very somber. Michael doesn't really like to interface with a lot of people on those days, because it's such a serious subject matter." ...|$|E

The April 27, 1998, issue of Sport Illustrated published [...] "The Best Ever on the Draw", a poll of NHL experts of the top ten players of all time for skills on the faceoff, and Kennedy was ranked at #1. Lloyd Percival once called Kennedy the [...] "Billy the Kid" [...] of hockey. Derek Sanderson, considered the best at faceoffs in the late 60s and 70s, related how his father had him watch Kennedy on the TV to learn the skill. In a 1987 interview Kennedy told a reporter, [...] "I went all-out at face-offs. Your centre is your quarterback and our other guys knew exactly what I was trying to do." [...] In the 1970s, GM of the Leafs, Jim Gregory asked Kennedy if he would help the team to improve their face-off performance. Kennedy agreed but with one stipulation. [...] "This can't involve (just) the centermen. It has to involve all five guys," [...] Kennedy told Gregory and coach Roger Neilson. [...] "Everyone {{has to be in}} tune. Everybody has a <b>job</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> This is a team." ...|$|E
500|$|The lack of graphics, poor {{interface}} {{and controls}} {{were seen as}} {{the reasons for the}} game's difficulty. However, the reviewers also noted most of it having a role in gameplay and the argument that the text-based graphics forces players to use their own imagination, making it more engaging. Weiner wrote, [...] " [...] may not look real, but once you're hooked, it feels vast, enveloping, alive. A micro-manager's dream, the game gleefully blurs the distinction between painstaking labor and creative thrill." [...] Quintin Smith from Rock, Paper, Shotgun said, [...] "The interface has a tough <b>job</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> bless it, but getting it {{to do what you want}} is like teaching a beetle to cook." [...] Ars Technica's Casey Johnston highlighted the difficulty in performing basic actions and felt that tinkering or experimenting ended up being unproductive; she compared it to [...] "trying to build a skyscraper by banging two rocks together". She pointed out the lack of in-game tutorial and said how players can learn by themselves in other games, which are also open-ended or have intuitive mechanics, but in Dwarf Fortress, there is no autonomy [...] "even after hours" [...] of gameplay.|$|E

500|$|The {{following}} {{season began}} well for Birmingham, who climbed {{as high as}} fourth in the table, but the team's fortunes declined and they could only finish in tenth place {{at the end of}} the season. Despite this disappointment, Bruce signed a new contract in June 2004 designed to keep him at St Andrew's for a further five years, but just two months later Freddy Shepherd, chairman of Newcastle United, was reported to have made Bruce his main target in the search for a new manager to replace Bobby Robson. The club was reportedly prepared to pay Birmingham more than Â£3million in compensation, and Bruce himself was said to be keen to take over at St James' Park, but he ultimately remained at Birmingham. He stated that [...] "as far as I'm concerned, I've got a <b>job</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> [...] and I'm determined to get on with it", but it was also reported that Newcastle would have been required to pay a much larger compensation fee or face legal action had he been persuaded to switch clubs. [...] Initial expectations were high for the 2004â€“05 season, but the club once again finished in a mid-table position, ending the season in 12thplace.|$|E
500|$|The group's [...] "golden rule", {{according}} to Field, {{was to make}} the content of their songs and shows [...] "developmentally appropriate and fun". [...] Their music, stage shows, and television and DVD productions were developed, as The New York Times reported, [...] "from the premise that a young child has a short attention span, is curious about a limited number of objects and activities, loves having a <b>job</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> and is thrilled by mastering basic movements". [...] They also respected their audience's intelligence and insight about entertainment, information, and honesty. [...] As Field said, [...] "Young children identify with relevant concepts, and enjoy being entertained and being part of the entertainment. They are willing to commit to interacting if you are direct, inclusive, and positive". [...] The group understood that challenging young children to engage in difficult tasks is more effective than simply telling them to do it. [...] They believed that young children were egocentric, so they stared continually into the camera in their videos and TV shows, and explained every action because they believed that young children needed to be told what to expect so that they do not feel left out and in order to feel safe.|$|E
500|$|Following a {{prolific}} Ranji season in 1990â€“91, Ganguly scored three runs in his One Day International(ODI) debut for India against the West Indies in 1992. He was dropped immediately {{since he was}} perceived to be [...] "arrogant" [...] and his attitude towards the game was openly questioned. It was rumoured that Ganguly refused to carry drinks for his teammates, commenting {{that it was not}} his <b>job</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so, later denied by him. Consequently, he was removed from the team. He toiled away in domestic cricket, scoring heavily in the 1993â€“94 and 1994â€“95 Ranji seasons. Following an innings of 171 in the 1995â€“96 Duleep Trophy, he was recalled to the National team for a tour of England in 1996, in the middle of intense media scrutiny. He played in a single ODI, but was omitted from the team for the first Test. However, after teammate Navjot Singh Sidhu left the touring, citing ill-treatment by then captain Mohammad Azharuddin, Ganguly made his Test debut against England in the Second Test of a three-match series at Lord's Cricket Ground alongside Rahul Dravid. England had won the First Test of the three-match series; however, Ganguly scored a century, becoming only the third cricketer to achieve such a feat on debut at Lord's, [...] after Harry Graham and John Hampshire. Andrew Strauss and Matt Prior have since accomplished this feat, but Ganguly's 131 still remains the highest by any batsman on his debut at the ground. India was not required to bat in the second innings due to the match ending in a draw. In the next Test match at Trent Bridge he made 136, thus becoming only the third batsman to make a century in each of his first two innings (after Lawrence Rowe and Alvin Kallicharran). He shared a 255run stand with Sachin Tendulkar, which became at that time the highest partnership for India against any country for any wicket outside India. The Test again ended in a draw, handing England a 1â€“0series victory; Ganguly scored 48 in the second innings.|$|E
