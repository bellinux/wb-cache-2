40|$|This report {{describes}} {{work performed}} during a thirty month project which involves {{the production of}} dimethyl ether (DME) on-site for use as an ignition-improving additive in a compression-ignition natural gas engine. A single cylinder spark ignition engine was converted to compression ignition operation. The engine was then fully instrumented with a cylinder pressure transducer, crank shaft position sensor, airflow meter, natural gas mass flow sensor, and an <b>exhaust</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>sensor.</b> Finally, the engine was interfaced with a control system for pilot injection of DME. The engine testing is currently in progress. In addition, a one-pass process to form DME from natural gas was simulated with chemical processing software. Natural gas is reformed to synthesis gas (a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide), converted into methanol, and finally to DME in three steps. Of additional benefit to the internal combustion engine, the offgas from the pilot process can be mixed with the main natural gas charge {{and is expected to}} improve engine performance. Furthermore, a one-pass pilot facility was constructed to produce 3. 7 liters/hour (0. 98 gallons/hour) DME from methanol in order to characterize the effluent DME solution and determine suitability for engine use. Successful production of DME led to an economic estimate of completing a full natural gas-to-DME pilot process. Additional experimental work in constructing a synthesis gas to methanol reactor is in progress. The overall recommendation from this work is that natural gas to DME is not a suitable pathway to improved natural gas engine performance. The major reasons are difficulties in handling DME for pilot injection and the large capital costs associated with DME production from natural gas...|$|E

25|$|Modern EMSs read in {{data from}} various sensors about the {{crankshaft}} position, intake manifold temperature, {{intake manifold pressure}} (or intake air volume), throttle position, fuel mixture via the oxygen sensor, detonation via a knock <b>sensor,</b> and <b>exhaust</b> gas <b>temperature</b> <b>sensors.</b> The EMS then uses the collected data to precisely determine how much fuel to deliver and when and how far to advance the ignition timing. With electronic ignition systems, individual cylinders can have their own individual timing so that timing can be as aggressive as possible per cylinder without fuel detonation. As a result, sophisticated electronic ignition systems can be both more fuel efficient, and produce better performance over their counterparts.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a generalization of multi-dimensional linear regression to facilitate multi-sensor fault detection and signal reconstruction {{through the use}} of analytical optimization. The proposed methodology is founded upon the solution of an optimal signal reconstruction problem. The technique is applied to the real time monitoring of <b>exhaust</b> gas <b>temperature</b> <b>sensors</b> and burner-tip <b>temperature</b> <b>sensors,</b> of a 14 MW industrial gas turbine. Key benefits of the proposed technique are that it facilitates (i) real-time detection of sensor faults and the number of sensors that are at fault in a multi-sensor system; (ii) reconstruction of measurements that would normally be expected from the sensor at fault - thereby facilitating improved unit availability; (iii) determining the minimum number of non-faulty sensors that are required to be available to continue unit operation without unduly compromising performance. The use of an analytical formulation to determine (i-iii) means that the resulting technique incurs low computational overhead and is readily applied to real-time monitoring and subsequent remedial action. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the developed procedures to facilitate continued unit operation in the event of sensor faults. Whilst the application to industrial gas turbine machinery is used to focus the study, {{it should be noted that}} the proposed techniques are much more widely applicable to numerous industrial and commercial systems.

In this paper, we present design and electro-thermo-mechanical {{analysis}} of molybdenum microheaters suitable for high <b>temperature</b> <b>exhaust</b> gas <b>sensors.</b> Double-spiral (DS), double-meander (DM), cross-meander (CS), modified-S (MS) and modified double spiral (MDS) shape structures were considered for simulation. The geometry of the resistive structure was optimized to improve temperature uniformity over a heating area of 500 X 500 mu m(2). Simulations show that the microheater consumed 83. 65 mW power to reach a maximum temperature of 800 degrees C with a temperature gradient of 8. 2 degrees C. Structural deformation of the microheater membrane was studied to determine its stability and reliability under high thermal stresses. The maximum membrane deformation was found to be 15. 25 mu m at 800 degrees C. Platinum, tungsten and molybdenum microheaters were compared in terms of their power consumption, temperature gradient and membrane deformations...|$|R

40|$|<b>Exhaust</b> gas <b>temperatures</b> in a 1. 4 L, sparked {{ignition}} engine have been measured using fine wire thermocouples at different loads and speeds. However the thermocouples are {{not fast enough}} to resolve the rapid change in <b>exhaust</b> <b>temperature.</b> This paper discusses a new thermocouple compensation technique to resolve the cycle-by-cycle variations in <b>exhaust</b> <b>temperature</b> by segmentation. Simulation {{results show that the}} technique can find the lower time constants during blowdown, reducing the bias from 28 to 4 %. Several estimators and model structures have been compared. The best one is the difference equation-least squares technique, which has the combined error between - 4. 4 to 7. 6 % at 60 dB signal-to-noise ratio. The compensated temperatures have been compared against combustion parameters on a cycle-by-cycle basis. The results show that the cycle-by-cycle variations of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>temperatures</b> and combustion are correlated. For instance, the mass fraction burnt is positively correlated with cycle-averaged temperature. When there is a larger variability in combustion, the <b>exhaust</b> <b>temperature</b> also exhibits higher cycle-by-cycle variations. Overall, the results have confirmed that the segmentation technique has successfully resolved the cyclic variations in <b>exhaust</b> <b>temperature,</b> and that the cycle-by-cycle variations in the <b>exhaust</b> <b>temperature</b> can be used to infer the combustion variability.

40|$|Abstract—This brief {{presents}} an autocalibrated all-digital tem-perature sensor circuit {{for use with}} on-chip thermal sensing appli-cations. The proposed <b>temperature</b> <b>sensor</b> {{eliminates the need for}} two-temperature-point calibration in prior <b>temperature</b> <b>sensors.</b> Therefore, <b>temperature</b> <b>sensor</b> calibration efforts in high-volume production can be significantly reduced. The proposed design uses reference clock period information to perform self-calibration, and thus, effects of process variation can be removed. Subse-quently, the accuracy of the proposed <b>temperature</b> <b>sensor</b> can be improved with very small area cost and low power consump-tion. The <b>temperature</b> <b>sensor</b> is implemented with a standard performance 65 -nm complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor technology. The core area is 0. 01 mm 2, and the power consump-tion of the proposed circuit is 150 μW with a 1 -V supply. Since the proposed <b>temperature</b> <b>sensor</b> can be easily calibrated with a reference clock, the proposed design is very suitable for dynamic thermal management applications in a system-on-a-chip era.
