The merged club would be called Thames Valley Royals, a combination of [...] "Thames Valley", a loose term for the geographical area, and the nickname of Reading Football Club, [...] "the Royals". [...] "If we in Thames Valley are to retain a League club we've got to unite Reading and Oxford," [...] he explained.

Feeling the technology was ready for commercial use, in 1989 Ballard raised $4 million in public money from the British Columbia government to build a fuel cell powered bus, introducing it at Science World in 1993. He took the bus to energy fairs around the world, and Daimler-Chrysler and Ford invested $750 million to buy a one-third stake in the newly public Ballard Power Systems.

2500|$|On 3 March 1953, Powell spoke {{against the}} Royal Titles Bill in the House of Commons. He {{said he found}} three major changes to {{the style of the}} United Kingdom, [...] "all of which seem to me to be evil". The first one was [...] "that in this title, for the first time, will be {{recognised}} a principle hitherto never admitted in this country, namely, the divisibility of the crown". Powell said that the unity of the realm had evolved over centuries and included the British Empire: [...] "It was a unit because it had one Sovereign. There was one Sovereign: one realm". He feared that by [...] "recognising the division of the realm into separate realms, are we not opening the way for that other remaining unity-–the last unity of all—that of the person, to <b>go</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> the rest?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Returning to Germany in May 1926, {{he became}} {{increasingly}} {{worried about the}} rise of nationalism and fascism. He wrote to Nettlau in 1927: [...] "Every nationalism begins with a Mazzini, but in its shadow there lurks a Mussolini". In 1929, Rocker was a co-founder of the Gilde freiheitlicher Bücherfreunde (Guild of Libertarian Bibliophiles), a publishing house which would release works by Alexander Berkman, William Godwin, Erich Mühsam, and John Henry Mackay. In the same year he went on a lecture tour in Scandinavia and {{was impressed by the}} anarcho-syndicalists there. Upon return, he wondered whether Germans were even capable of anarchist thought. In the 1930 elections, the Nazi Party received 18.3% of all votes, a total of 6 million. Rocker was worried: [...] "Once the Nazis get to power, we'll all <b>go</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> Landauer and Eisner" [...] (who were killed by reactionaries {{in the course of the}} Munich Soviet Republic uprising).|$|E

2500|$|The writer {{changed the}} fate of another character, Krug's son Justin {{attempting}} to give the audience a better [...] "sense of hope". Craven points out that early on he suggested that Krug have a son who commits suicide, but found it interesting to see [...] "this strange Romeo and Juliet thing happening" [...] between Krug's son and Mari. He also stated that he likes the fact that John Collingwood is a doctor who actually gets to use his skills in the film, unlike in the original where the character is merely identified as being a doctor. Craven comments, [...] " [...] an extraordinary moment" [...] when John is forced to improvise a way to restore a collapsed lung; [...] "It made it real." [...] Ellsworth {{wanted to create a}} level of interest in the characters that would [...] "engage [...] ", as opposed to simply leaving the family in [...] "even worse shape [...] the end of the movie". He asserts that the film does not have a happy ending, but that there is some hope left at the end. Director Dennis Iliadis further explains that the point is to show the family from a different light. Initially the director feared that they were [...] "wussing out" [...] with the ending; he eventually decided that what you really see is a family that has physically survived this encounter, but are [...] "dead in many ways". Iliadis expressed {{that he did not want}} to <b>go</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> [...] "torture porn", which is what he sees most horror films moving toward, but instead show a sense of [...] "urgency" [...] with the parents' actions.|$|E
