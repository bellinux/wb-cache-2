5|$|The video {{begins on}} a city {{sidewalk}} where Scherzinger walks into a telephone booth as several men in black suits pass by the booth. As Scherzinger begins to undress, the men stop to stare as she begins taking off her glasses and shaking her hair back. The video then moves to Scherzinger in a dress walking past four men mopping the floor to a supply closet where she enters and reappears moments later, {{dressed in a black}} body suit with a cape. As the chorus begins, the situation rapidly switches back-and-forth from Scherzinger in her good-girl persona shown fighting escaped jail prisoners dressed in striped suits (and Beagle Boys masks) to Scherzinger in her bad-girl persona fighting with police. As the song progresses, Scherzinger is shown in a classic looking automobile and riding a BMW motorcycle, with a streaking white and black background. Several shots of her bad-girl persona alone in a room with two prisoners are then shown. As the bridge begins, she is shown in her good-girl ego standing by a podium, talking to a group of reporters while waving <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air. As the bridge ends, she brings her hands down, blowing back all of the reporters, who then begin dancing and pumping their arms to the song. The video moves to Scherzinger dancing with the police and prisoners before ending with her blowing away the two men who were in the room with her and walking away.|$|E
25|$|Clijsters {{started her}} 2010 {{campaign}} at the Brisbane International in Australia {{as the top}} seed. She defeated Tathiana Garbin and Alicia Molik {{in the first two}} rounds, without dropping a set. She then defeated Lucie Šafářová in three sets to advance to the semifinals, where she defeated Andrea Petkovic to set up a final with her compatriot Justine Henin. Clijsters led 6–3, 4–1, before Henin won eight consecutive games to take the second set and lead 3–0 in the final set. Clijsters trailed 5–3, saved two match points before breaking back and forcing a final set tie break. During the tiebreak, Clijsters struck a backhand that appeared to land on the line, sealing the championship. She raised <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air in celebration, before the call was overruled by the umpire, who claimed the ball was out. Despite being rattled by the call, Clijsters was unfazed and remained focused, going on to win the match, 6–3, 4–6, 7–6(6) after Henin double faulted to give her another match point.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} ritual {{practices}} and beliefs {{are associated with}} birth among the Tanala. In the past, after delivery of a baby the mother would wash <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> blood of a freshly sacrificed chicken, bathe herself in hot water, and then rest upright beside a fire to make her sweat out impurities. The period {{that she needed to}} stay beside the fire varied; noblewomen might stay beside the fire for as long as several months, but more commonly the duration was eight days. Immediately after this period beside the fire was concluded, a party was held, which the mother had to attend regardless of her condition; the event was marked by the slaughter of zebu. Immediately after birth, the baby would be bathed in cold water, and a sorcerer would declare certain days to be lifelong fady (taboo days); if a baby was born on a day that was fady for both the mother and father, the child would be abandoned to die. In addition, there are eight fady days per month for all Tanala, and historically if a child was born on one of these days, it would be drowned by holding its head in a water-filled winnowing pan.|$|E

500|$|Scenes showing Kristy McNichol innocently burying <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dog's fur and {{his normal}} loving {{behavior}} when {{alone with her}} provides a stark image of [...] "how hatred can be familiar, reassuringly close." [...] J. Hoberman argues that the film [...] "naturalizes racism in an unnatural way" [...] in the contrasting depictions of white characters horrified by the dog's behavior, and black characters who grimly accept it as a fact of life. The film's ending has been argued to emphasize Fuller's own view that racism {{is something that is}} learned, but that once learned is a [...] "poison" [...] that can never truly [...] "be banished from those it infects." [...] But on the other hand, the dog is actually cured of attacking blacks, but not cured of his own hatred since the last thing he does is to attack a white man, and without being provoked into doing so at that. The ending implies therefore that it is hatred (and not racism) that cannot be banished from those it infects.|$|E
500|$|Fraser and Navarro {{write that}} it was Evita's work with the {{foundation}} that played {{a large role in}} her idealization, even leading some to consider her a saint. Though it was unnecessary from a practical standpoint, Evita set aside many hours per day to meet with the poor who requested help from her foundation. During these meetings with the poor, Evita often kissed the poor and allowed them to kiss her. Evita was even witnessed placing <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> suppurated wounds of the sick and poor, touching the leprous, and kissing the syphilitic. Fraser and Navarro write that though Argentina is secular in many respects, it is essentially a Catholic country. Therefore, when Evita kissed the syphilitic and touched the leprous she [...] "...ceased to be the President's wife and acquired some of the characteristics of saints depicted in Catholicism." [...] Poet , a man from a wealthy background, reflected on the times he witnessed Evita meeting with the poor: [...] "I had had a sort of literary perception of the people and the poor and she had given me a Christian one, thus allowing me to become a Christian in the profoundest sense...." ...|$|E

500|$|It {{was also}} {{performed}} on Gaga's The Monster Ball Tour. The piano version was played by Gaga while balancing {{on the piano}} stool and holding one leg up in the air. Rapper Kid Cudi joined her then to perform his song [...] "Make Her Say" [...] which contains a sample of [...] "Poker Face". The actual version was performed at the last segment of the show. Gaga wore a dress made of guns and during the performance she pumped <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air. For the revamped Monster Ball shows in 2010-11, Gaga was dancing around the stage while whipping a chain. It was also performed at the 52nd Grammy Awards, where she opened the show with the song while standing on a pedestal. Midway through the performance, she was flung into the garbage chute of the Fame Factory set, before emerging seated at a piano, facing Elton John. In May 2011, Gaga performed the song during Radio 1's Big Weekend in Carlisle, Cumbria. The song was included on the set list of her 2012-3 Born This Way Ball Tour in which she sports {{a modified version of}} her infamous meat dress. Gaga and her dancers put themselves headfirst into enormous meat grinders during the performance. For her 2014 residency show, Lady Gaga Live at Roseland Ballroom she chose to perform the song in a piano-only rendition. In the same year, at the [...] tour, Gaga performed the song in a medley with [...] "Just Dance" [...] and [...] "Telephone" [...] while wearing knee-length white dress and heels, and a bob wig.|$|E

She continued with two songs from The Fame Monster titled [...] "So Happy I Could Die" [...] and [...] "Teeth", after which she removed the feathered dress. Gaga then started performing the song [...] "Speechless" [...] on piano, and continued with an acoustic version of [...] "Poker Face". Rapper Kid Cudi joined her then to perform his song [...] "Make Her Say" [...] which contains a sample of [...] "Poker Face". This segment {{was followed by}} the performance of [...] "Fashion" [...] and [...] "The Fame", during which Gaga wore a gold Egyptian styled crown and matching body suit, compared to the garment of a viking. Gaga crawled atop her piano during the follow-up songs [...] "The Fame" [...] and [...] "Money Honey", after which she returned to the stage, dressed in black vinyl and nearly nude in a red patent leather bikini, to perform [...] "Boys Boys Boys", backed by a squadron of skinny and shirtless leather boys. During [...] "Poker Face", she wore a bondage inspired black leather dress with guns hanging from it and a hat made of muzzles, and pumped <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air while performing the song. This was followed by Gaga sitting on a dentist's chair and spreading her legs during [...] "Paper Gangsta". Another video interlude followed, displaying arty poses of Gaga in gothic looks.|$|E
