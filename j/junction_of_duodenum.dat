40|$|Context: Superior {{mesenteric}} artery {{syndrome is}} a life- threatening upper gastrointestinal disorder due to compression <b>of</b> <b>duodenum</b> as it poses a difficult diagnostic dilemma. Third part <b>of</b> <b>duodenum</b> is in fixed compartment bounded anteriorly by {{the root of}} mesentery and superior mesentery artery and posteriorly by the aorta and lumbar spine. On barium contrast study and abdominal computerized tomography (CT) showed the dilatation of second part <b>of</b> <b>duodenum</b> and compression <b>of</b> the third part <b>of</b> <b>duodenum</b> between aorta and superior mesentery artery. Case Report: A 22 year young asthenic man admitted with the complaint of recurrent abdominal pain, epigastric fullness, and vomiting and weight loss. Abdominal examination revealed epigastric fullness and hyper peristaltic bowel sounds. Upper gastrointestinal barium study showed a dilated stomach with dilated second part <b>of</b> the <b>duodenum</b> and cut off at the third part <b>of</b> <b>duodenum</b> with no intrinsic mucosal abnormalities. There was no relief of obstruction in the left lateral decubitus or prone position. Conservative treatment was tried for one month but failed. Intra-operative findings confirmed the extrinsic obstruction of third part <b>of</b> <b>duodenum</b> with distension <b>of</b> 2 nd part. A retrocolic duodenojejunostomy, side to side anastomosis done. In post-operative follow up, patient was symptom free. Conclusion: Superior mesentery artery syndrome is a life threatening disease.

DAWSON' From St. James's Hospital, Balham, London EDITORIAL SYNOPSIS A patient with recurrent melaena over a period of four years is reported. He underwent four laparotomies. At the fourth operation a leiomyoma of the second part <b>of</b> the <b>duodenum</b> was found and successfully resected. The clinical features of leiomyomatous tumours <b>of</b> the <b>duodenum</b> are reviewed, and recurrent unexplained gastrointestinal haemorrhage is emphasized as a common manifestation. Tumours derived from the muscle coat <b>of</b> the <b>duodenum</b> are rare, and successful surgical treat-ment is even rarer (Weinstein and Roberts, 1953; Starr and Dockerty, 1955). A case of leiomyoma <b>of</b> the <b>duodenum</b> is presented because it illustrates some of the clinical features of leiomyomata, as well as an unusual pitfall which was encountered in the diagnosis of recurrent gastrointestinal haemorrhage.

Few reported cases of duodenal anomalies date back to early twentieth century. In the wake of advancement of imaging techniques and minimal access surgeries, authors report a case of a rare duodenal anomaly. The reported case assumes significance because of thepossibility of misinterpretation of radiological images which has been discussed while citing such references. The present case reports an anomaly of the position of the midgut segment <b>of</b> the <b>duodenum</b> in an adult female cadaver.

Case reportA 55 -year-old man presented {{with a history of}} upper gastrointestinal bleeding, vomiting and decreased body weight over the past 2 months. Abdominal exam showed an epigastric mass of 10 cm. An upper gastrointestinal endoscopy documented a tumor in the third part <b>of</b> <b>duodenum.</b> The histopathological examination of biopsy has concluded a MFH. Abdominal CT revealed a large and heterogeneous mass of 10 cm in the third part <b>of</b> the <b>duodenum.</b> The intervention was conducted by way of a bi-subcostal laparotomy. Exploration of the tumor revealed involvement of the third part <b>of</b> <b>duodenum.</b> This lesion adhered and invaded the inferior vena cava.

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to investigate the effect of Artemisia argyi aqueous extract (AAE) on antioxidant indexes in the small intestine. A total of 192 Arbor Acre broiler chickens (one-day-old) were randomly divided into 4 treatments with 6 replicates of 8 chickens. These 4 diets were formulated by adding 0, 500, 1, 000 and 2, 000  mg/kg AAE to the basal diet. The results showed as follows: 1) compared with the control, the total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) in ileum for the 2, 000  mg/kg treatment group was significantly increased at 21 days of age (P <  0. 05); the T-AOC levels in jejunum and ileum were significantly increased in broilers supplemented with 500  mg/kg AAE at 42 days of age (P <  0. 05), and the T-AOC levels in jejunum and ileum were significantly improved in 1, 000  mg/kg treatment group (P <  0. 01). 2) At 21 days of age, supplementation of 500  mg/kg AAE significantly increased the catalase (CAT) activity of small intestine, and the glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity of jejunum was improved (P <  0. 01), meanwhile, the GSH-Px activity <b>of</b> <b>duodenum</b> and the total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) activity <b>of</b> <b>duodenum</b> and jejunum were significantly higher than those of the control group (P <  0. 05); supplementation of 1, 000  mg/kg AAE significantly increased the CAT activity <b>of</b> <b>duodenum</b> and ileum and the GSH-Px activity <b>of</b> <b>duodenum</b> and jejunum (P <  0. 05), and the ileum GSH-Px activity was significantly increased (P <  0. 01); supplementation of 2, 000  mg/kg AAE significantly increased the CAT activity <b>of</b> <b>duodenum</b> and ileum (P <  0. 05). At 42 days of age, supplementation of 500  mg/kg AAE significantly increased the GSH-Px activity of ileum and the T-SOD activity <b>of</b> <b>duodenum</b> (P <  0. 05), meanwhile, the T-SOD activity of jejunum was significantly increased (P <  0. 01); supplementation of 1, 000  mg/kg AAE significantly increased the CAT activity of jejunum and the T-SOD activity of ileum (P <  0. 01), and the GSH-Px activity of jejunum was significantly increased (P <  0. 05); supplementation of 2, 000  mg/kg AAE significantly increased the T-SOD activity of ileum (P <  0. 05), but significantly decreased the CAT activity of ileum and the GSH-Px activity of jejunum (P <  0. 05). 3) The malondialdehyde (MDA) levels of 3 AAE supplementation groups were significantly decreased at 21 and 42 days of age (P <  0. 05).

40|$|AbstractINTRODUCTIONPrimary {{adenocarcinoma}} of the 4 th portion <b>of</b> the <b>duodenum</b> {{is reported}} less frequently than those other portions <b>of</b> the <b>duodenum.</b> Therefore, few reports discuss {{the diagnosis and}} treatment of this malignancy. PRESENTATION OF CASEA 54 -year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with a complaint of nausea and vomiting after a meal. Upper gastrointestinal examination and a duodenogram revealed a Type 2 tumor of the 4 th portion <b>of</b> the <b>duodenum,</b> which was diagnosed as well-differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma by endoscopic biopsy. Partial resection <b>of</b> the <b>duodenum</b> and jejunum was performed on the basis of intraoperative evaluation of negative lymph node metastasis around the pancreas and proximal duodenum with no macroscopic invasion toward the pancreas and proximal duodenal margin. Her postoperative course was uneventful without any sign of recurrence 5 years later. DISCUSSIONPrimary adenocarcinoma in the 4 th portion is relatively less common. It is not easy to diagnose this disease. Patients with primary duodenal adenocaricinoma, who are medically fit to undergo surgery, should be given the option of aggressive resection. Duodeno-cephalo-pancreatectomy remains the standard treatment for adenocarcinomas of the 1 st and 2 nd portion <b>of</b> the <b>duodenum.</b> Partial resection is the preferred surgical method for patients with adenocarcinoma of the 3 rd and 4 th portions <b>of</b> the <b>duodenum.</b> CONCLUSIONThis report describes a rare case of primary adenocarcinoma of the 4 th portion <b>of</b> the <b>duodenum,</b> successfully treated by partial resection <b>of</b> the <b>duodenum</b> and jejunum.
