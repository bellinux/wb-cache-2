50|$|The {{government}} also offered incentives to industrialise the Malaysian economy by promoting Malay entrepreneurship and upgrading Malay management skills for manufacturing ventures. The Federal Industrial Development Authority (FIDA), established in 1965 but only commencing operations in 1967, sought to accelerate industrial development further and co-ordinate such development. In 1968, new regulations were established that set quotas for Malay ownership of certain enterprises, and {{the employment of}} Malays in manufacturing ventures. (Such affirmative action policies were held to be in line with Article 153 of the Constitution.) New industries producing goods for the Malaysian market were required {{to have at least}} 51% of their <b>equity</b> <b>in</b> the <b>hands</b> of Malaysian citizens, but industries that would only export goods were permitted to remain entirely <b>in</b> foreign <b>hands.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1974 Klein died, {{leaving her}} <b>equity</b> {{position}} <b>in</b> the <b>hands</b> of her second husband, Chip Rubenstein. Oppenheim {{wanted to sell}} his shares in the company, and Taki bought Oppenheim out despite {{the death of the}} company's driving force. There was great contention among Taki, Oppenheim, and Rubenstein regarding Anne's successor. Taki wanted to elevate the assistant designer, but Oppenheim and Rubenstein wanted a name-brand designer to take the helm. At the time, Taki had the largest individual stake in the company so his equity position allowed him to promote the assistant Donna Karan, who a decade later became a household name. In {{a matter of a few}} years after Anne's death with Donna Karan leading the design-room, Takihyo purchased all of Rubenstein's position.|$|R

There was a point where it would be off-air for days at a time. During this dark period, some area cable systems (including Adelphia in Burlington) temporarily replaced WBVT-LP with Boston's WSBK-TV. In 2005 once the station was <b>in</b> <b>Equity's</b> <b>hands</b> and back <b>in</b> shape, it changed its call letters again to the current WGMU-CA. This was done in order to distinguish itself as a UPN station and no longer a WB affiliate. In Fall 2006, UPN ceased broadcasting and merged with The WB into a new network called The CW. Only one UPN/WB affiliate in each market could join The CW, and WGMU-CA was rejected in favor of WFFF-TV. Instead, it joined MyNetworkTV another new network created by News Corporation for former UPN/WB stations that could not affiliate with The CW. The new affiliation took effect on September 5 and WGMU-CA changed its branding to [...] "My 39".|$|R

40|$|In China, {{there is}} a general view that the <b>equity</b> <b>in</b> {{education}} has a negative effect on the quality of economic growth. Acting upon this viewpoint, China's education policy has gradually abandoned its low-gravity development strategies and would rather significantly invest more money into higher education than basic education. In this paper, an empirical study on the relationship between China’s <b>equity</b> <b>in</b> education and the quality of economic growth is implemented to try to answer the following question, i. e., which is the more important one for the equality of China's economic growth, basic education, or higher education. By adopting China's recent 27 -year macro-economic data from 1978 to 2004, the paper carries out the Granger causality test between the <b>equity</b> <b>in</b> education and the quality of economic growth and then establishes a regression model. Results of the empirical study show that the <b>equity</b> <b>in</b> education is significantly and positively related to the quality of economic growth, and the <b>equity</b> <b>in</b> education is the Granger reason of China’s quality of economic growth. That is to say, besides promoting the social harmony, <b>equity</b> <b>in</b> education also has a positive role in promoting the quality of economic growth in China, which is a very different conclusion from the current point of view. Based on the results and the analysis of the mechanism of the relationship between <b>equity</b> <b>in</b> education and the quality of economic growth, this paper proposes that China's present education policies need many adjustments...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{examines}} {{financial claims}} for lending if banks {{are permitted to}} hold <b>equity</b> <b>in</b> productive firms. We demonstrate that in situations where an oligopolistic product market has relatively high competition, e. g., quasi-competitive behavior, equity holding by banks is likely to do little damage. However, where the product market has relatively high collusion, e. g., corporative behavior, equity holding by banks are very unlikely to hold <b>equity</b> <b>in</b> firms. Our findings provide an alternative argument that lifting the Glass-Steagall Act restricting banks from holding <b>equity</b> <b>in</b> firms should give little cause for concern...|$|R

40|$|With {{the great}} impact of globalization, {{the issues of}} {{excellence}} and <b>equity</b> <b>in</b> education have been surfaced internationally. The various arguments have been existed about what equity means and how to achieve it are inextricably linked to notions of excellence. Given the debate <b>in</b> excellence and <b>equity</b> <b>in</b> education, this leaves room for discussion of how the issues of excellence and equity have been addressed. This article intends to address the issues of excellence and <b>equity</b> <b>in</b> education in a Chinese context. Starting with a brief introduction of classical examination system, Ke Ju a classical Chinese examination which was employed to select the government officials, the article suggests that the pursuit of excellence and <b>equity</b> <b>in</b> education has long been embedded in Chinese culture. It then analyzes factors that hinder the pursuit of excellence and <b>equity</b> <b>in</b> education in China and proposes strategies for addressing the issue. It is suggested that this process be followed by addressing education in China as a local response to local conditions in a global context. Finally, China’s education leadership must change {{in order to meet}} the needs of fostering a paradigm shift...|$|R
