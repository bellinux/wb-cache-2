She added that Mercedes confiding secrets in Doctor Browning [...] "served only to bring them closer.

2500|$|Neither Davies nor Hearst ever {{publicly}} {{addressed the}} rumors during their lives. Upon {{news of the}} story, a spokesman for Hearst Castle only commented that, [...] "It's a very old rumor and a rumor <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>it</b> ever was." ...|$|E
2500|$|The first {{scientific}} study of available evidence was conducted by John Napier and published in his book, Bigfoot: The Yeti and Sasquatch in Myth and Reality, in 1973. Napier wrote that if a conclusion is to be reached based on scant extant [...] "'hard' evidence," [...] science must declare [...] "Bigfoot does not exist." [...] However, he {{found it difficult to}} entirely reject thousands of alleged tracks, [...] "scattered over 125,000 square miles" [...] (325,000km²) or to dismiss all [...] "the many hundreds" [...] of eyewitness accounts. Napier concluded, [...] "I am convinced that Sasquatch exists, but whether it <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>it</b> is cracked up to be is another matter altogether. There must be something in north-west America that needs explaining, and that something leaves man-like footprints." ...|$|E

2500|$|David Fricke of Rolling Stone complimented the band's [...] "bright, wired bounce and the shell-game shuffle of funk beats, snappy Jamaican {{rhythms and}} mosh-pit, shout-it-out choruses in Nowell's writing," [...] deeming it [...] "the stuff {{of a band}} with great promise and the {{confidence}} {{to make good on}} it. If only that were still possible." [...] RJ Smith of Spin praised Nowell's songwriting craft, writing, [...] "It might seem a daring experiment if it hadn't so effortlessly sprung from a Long Beach surf scene that featured acoustic jams on the beach that naturally flowed from Wailers to Descendents classics [...] Sublime succeeds not just on vibe but on songcraft." [...] Nisid Hajari of Entertainment Weekly called the album a [...] "respectable testament" [...] to Nowell's memory, ultimately noting that the record [...] "coheres more on an intellectual rather than emotional level, its sound too diffuse to be dramatic." [...] Robert Christgau of The Village Voice gave the record an A-, commenting, [...] "Junkies who retain enough soul to create music at all are generally driven to put their brilliance and stupidity in your face. Nowell is altogether more loving, unassuming, good-humored, and down-to-earth — or so he pretends, which when you're good <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>it</b> takes." ...|$|E
