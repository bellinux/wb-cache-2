40|$|Cantilevered signal, sign, {{and light}} support {{structures}} are used nationwide on major interstates, national highways, local highways, and at local intersections for traffic control purposes. Recently, {{there have been}} a number of failures of these structures that can likely be attributed to fatigue. In light of the fact that there is considerable uncertainty in the calculation of vortex shedding loads in both the American Association of State Highway and Transportation (AASHTO) and the Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code (CAN/CSA) code provisions, the current equations used for vortex shedding fatigue design need to be reevaluated and likely re-formulated or modified.;A luminary support structure or <b>High</b> <b>Mast</b> <b>Light</b> Pole (HMLP) is generally susceptible to two primary types of wind loading induced by natural wind gusts or buffeting and vortex shedding, both of which excite the structure dynamically and can cause fatigue damage. Vortex shedding is a unique type of wind load that alternatively creates areas of negative pressures on either side of a structure normal to the wind direction. This causes the structure to oscillate transverse to the wind direction.;The primary objective of this study was to develop a procedure for predicting wind loads in the time domain for the fatigue design of slender, tapered luminary support structures. To accomplish this, monitoring of long-term response behavior of a HMLP subjected to wind-induced vibration was needed. This was accomplished by full-scale measurement of the response of a HMLP located near Mason City next to I- 35 in Iowa. Wind tunnel testing was also conducted to determine the required aerodynamic parameters of the pole cross section. Further, these aerodynamic parameters were cast into a coupled dynamic model for predicting the response of any HMLP in the time. Finally, the model was validated by comparing its results with the data collected from field monitoring.;Fatigue life of the given HMLP was estimated with further modeling of the wind speed distribution and stress amplitudes predicted by the time-domain model. The predicted fatigue life was compared with those calculated with the full-scale data...|$|R

50|$|The Hoggs Hollow Bridge has a 14-lane cross section: 6 {{collector}} lanes, 8 express lanes. The {{road surface}} and bridge decks require constant maintenance {{due to the}} wear and tear from high traffic volumes. Since 2001, an Ontario tall-wall concrete barrier has replaced the steel guide-rail in the median separating eastbound and westbound traffic. The late 1960s conventional truss lights have been replaced by high-mast lighting. Starting from 2002, the westbound collector lanes on the outer north bridge have also undergone rehabilitation (replacing road surface, guard rails and/or concrete barriers). The westbound collector traffic has been rehabilitated; the project included the north side outer bridge and the Yonge Street overpass. Additional <b>high</b> <b>mast</b> <b>lighting</b> was added in late 2009. From 2006 to 2008, the eastbound collector lanes were rebuilt and the reconstruction stretched from east of Avenue Road all the way to Bayview Avenue, encompassing the south side outer bridge and Yonge Street overpass. This did not include the on-ramp junction with Lord Seaton Road. The inner eastbound express lanes will be next on the reconstruction process. Once completed, the entire bridge will use the Ontario tall-wall barrier system.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} project {{was done to}} investigate the effects of taper on vortex shedding coherence on <b>High</b> <b>Mast</b> <b>Lighting</b> Towers (HMLTs) with models of 8 -, 12 -, and 16 -sided polygonal cross-section. The models are mounted on springs to recreate a flutter phenomenon seen on <b>high</b> <b>mast</b> <b>lighting</b> towers and left to move freely (with an extra 2 ̆ 2 clamped 2 ̆ 2 or stationary configuration) within the wind tunnel in the cross-wind direction. Later, the model was forced to oscillate at specified frequencies and amplitudes and the resulting wake and surface pressures were recorded and compared to the freemoving and clamped cases. The study aims to study {{the characteristics of a}} 2 ̆ 2 lock-in 2 ̆ 2 phenomenon, that is, a range of diameters where instead of different shedding frequencies for different diameters, there is a single shedding frequency for different diameters. This goes contrary to the standard for vortex shedding model characterized by the Strouhal relation. Results show the existence of vortex cell shedding for clamped models. Using a motor and a forcing cam to recreate the elastic movement of the HMLT in ambient conditions has yielded a specific range of diameters to determine the size of the locked in vortex cells. According to standard Department of Transportation manufacturing standards for taper, the lock in distance for small excitations (0. 1 inches) would be approximately 10 feet in size in the spanwise direction. This study yields information on vortex cells, their change with forcing excitation, the boundaries between the vortex cells, the changes with Reynolds number and cross-sectional shape, and several other parameters. ...|$|E

40|$|Drilled shafts are {{a common}} type of deep {{foundations}} used to support {{a wide array of}} infrastructure facilities such as bridges, <b>high</b> <b>mast</b> <b>lighting,</b> tanks and communication towers. The deep inaccessible subterranean nature and the construction procedures of drilled shafts result in various types of anomalies; most critical of which being necking and voids. This necking or voids translates to loss of concrete cover around the longitudinal bars and its subsequent exposure to the surrounding soil, leading to corrosion. An experimental study using large-scale drilled shaft samples is presented that evaluates the effect of different percentages of rebar corrosion on the axial load capacity of drilled shaft foundations. Results show that the presence of corrosion in the longitudinal bars affects both the strength and buckling capacity of a shaft, and that a 25 % necking or void area will result in more than 60 % of axial capacity loss of the shaft over a time period of 20 years.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{study on the}} effect of helical strakes on vortex induced vibrations and the lock-in phenomenon in <b>High</b> <b>Mast</b> <b>Lighting</b> Towers (HMLTs) is investigated. Two multi-sided tapered scaled models are clamped in place in a subsonic wind tunnel that is equipped with a hot-wire sensor and a traverse mechanism. The shedding frequency data is collected for the models with and without helically patterned strakes with the use of two different ropes. The responses of the tower models, for a Reynolds number of 44, 000, are compared and discussed under different configurations including: two directions of the model with respect to the direction of the flow, and changes in the ratio of strake height to HMLT diameter. Four major aspects of the spectrum of the hot-wire signal from the wake are studied: the vortex shedding frequency, signal strength, characteristic spectral peak area, and characteristic spectral peak width. It is observed that, for most cases, no specific method produces a decisive outcome. However, some of the results for the 12 -sided model provide supporting evidence that the vortex induced vibrations may be mitigated with the use of helical strakes. ...|$|E
40|$|High Mast Light {{gives the}} several cost {{effective}} advantages and cost {{is a major}} issue for rural area general services. This project illustrates the theoretical basis and the analytical development of the <b>high</b> <b>mast</b> <b>lighting</b> poles. In the late 1960 "s, studies were conducted to investigate the impact that high-mast lighting gives on traffic performance, driver visibility, and illumination costs. It was found that increasing {{the height of the}} lighting offered a noticeable advantage in that it provided drivers with increased uniformity of illumination and brightness while minimizing discomfort and disability glare. In this turn, it`s led to a reduced number of visibility related accidents. Also, lighting is a major requirement when we deal with working at the opencast mining. In opencast mining, the efficient lighting system is required while working during dark hours. In the present work, a new system of light mast tower is proposed & designed which increases the usability of the existing light mast towers. In this solution, each light mast is given a particular position to its vertical & horizontal axis which sets the light to focus in any particular area and direction to cover target area with minimum power and resource...|$|E

40|$|The primary {{objectives}} {{of the project was}} to design an effective lighting layout at different places of work to ensure safe visual working environment in an opencast mining project with keeping in view to meet the statutory standards. The research work was carried out with the objectives to conduct illumination survey and check whether the adequacy of lighting meet the standards set by Directorate General of Mines Safety (DGMS) as well as design of appropriate illumination systems based on illumination requirement for: ? Different places of work in the mine and ? Different Heavy Earth Moving Machineries (HEMMs). The illumination survey was performed in a mechanized opencast manganese mine project of Manganese Ore India Limited during March, 2015. It included an illumination survey of the existing lighting system in various working areas e. g. haul road, service road, dump yard, dumping road, road to stack yard followed by analysis and improvement measures. The lux meter used for the survey was a Metravi- 1332. The existing illuminance levels were found inadequate in the mine dumping yard (at dump edges). The roads though had required level of illuminance but optimization was necessary. The illumination models for various working places in the mine were developed using DIALux software and virtual Philips luminaires were used for the design. DGMS standard for opencast mine lighting was used for both assessment and design of illumination systems. The luminaires used for the design were 250 watts HPSV. For dump yard lighting arrangement model was obtained using 1000 watts HPSV lamps fitted on high mast tower and the design satisfied DGMS standards with a minimum illuminance of 3 lux at the dump edges. The following recommendations were proposed for consideration to improve the visual level in the work places ? Installation of 250 Watt lamps for the roadways so that the number of poles can be reduced resulting less cost for pole installation and more free areas for movement of vehicles. ? Truck mounted illumination system can be used instead of fixed lighting system at the places which are vulnerable to damage caused by blasting. ? The cabin lighting of HEMMs can be improved by installing proper luminaries. ? <b>High</b> <b>mast</b> <b>lighting</b> tower must be installed in the dump yard to meet the standards {{at the edges of the}} dump yard...|$|E
40|$|Passive tuned {{mass damper}} (TMD) is a {{stand-alone}} vibrating system attached to a primary structure and designed to reduce vibration of the structure at selected frequency. This study focuses on the application of single or multiple TMDs on Euler-Bernoulli beams and examines their effectiveness based on free and forced vibration characteristics of the beams, i. e., the primary structures. There is {{a gap in the}} existing literature in terms of free and forced vibration analysis of beams carrying any number of concentrated elements. There are methods developed for the free vibration analysis but they are not practical due to the complex mathematical expressions. Numerical assembly method (Wu and Chou, 1999) is used to determine free vibration characteristics of beams in order to get over the drawbacks of other approaches in the literature and forced vibration response is obtained based on modal analysis approach and orthogonality condition. ^ The free-vibration formulations for uniform, non-uniform single-span and multi-span continuous beams carrying any number of elastically mounted masses are derived for various boundary conditions. Numerical solutions for dynamic responses of these beams subjected to impulsive, harmonic, moving and moving pulsating loads are presented. A numerical eigenvalue solution is used to obtain the modal properties of the entire beam at its fundamental and lower normal modes. The modal analysis approach allows calculatin displacement, velocity, acceleration and jerk responses at any point on the beam. The resultant dynamic responses of beams with and without TMDs are compared with each other in order to observe the performance of TMDs. ^ Numerical examples are given to confirm the validity and efficiency of the proposed method. Natural frequencies and mode shapes of several structures studied in literature are calculated and compared with those in existing literature to verify the accuracy of the developed algorithm. The illustrative forcing functions are considered as human-induced dynamic loads for uniform single and multiple span beams. The results demonstrate that passive TMDs are efficient in reducing the dynamic responses of beams subjected to harmonic excitations. However, passive TMDs do not show the same level of performance under non-harmonic loads. Additionally, wind load analysis is performed for a sample <b>high</b> <b>mast</b> <b>lighting</b> tower (HMLT) represented as a cantilever non-uniform beam in this study and the efficiency of attached TMD is analyzed. Experimental wind velocity data is used to generate the wind induced dynamic load on the HMLT. Results indicate that properly tuned passive TMDs may be an option to reduce dynamic response in wind-excited HMLTs. ...|$|E
