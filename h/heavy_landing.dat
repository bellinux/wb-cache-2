5|$|First {{deliveries}} {{began in}} March 1947 and a flight test program began that month that lasted {{three years before}} the major deficiencies identified were fully corrected. Carrier landing trials revealed a structural weakness of the rear fuselage when one aircraft was severed in half during a <b>heavy</b> <b>landing.</b> Severe vibrations in the tail upon engaging the arresting wire were cured by adding a roller bearing to the tailhook to counter the sideways forces placed on the tailhook. Other necessary changes were the addition of spoiler ailerons and an elevator control boost to improve the aircraft's poor controllability at low speeds. In addition, the cockpit layout was unsatisfactory {{and had to be}} redesigned. The NATC finally deemed the Mauler acceptable for carrier landings in August 1948 even though aircraft had been issued to one squadron earlier in the year and a new batch of 50 aircraft had been ordered in May. Despite all the modifications to the aircraft over its short life, it remained a maintenance nightmare, especially the leaky hydraulic systems.|$|E

25|$|In September 1929 it {{suffered}} from a <b>heavy</b> <b>landing</b> which damaged the undercarriage.

25|$|The first prototype, officially {{designated}} MI-3 and nicknamed Mitrich {{made its}} maiden flight in August 1933. Initial testing was successful, the ANT-21 being popular with its test pilots, but when being dived at nearly 400km/h (250mph), severe flutter was {{encountered in the}} aircraft tail, with the starboard rudder breaking off and the aircraft making a <b>heavy</b> <b>landing.</b>|$|E

25|$|The 1965 Skyways Coach-Air Avro 748 crash {{occurred}} on 10 July 1965 when Avro 748-101 Series 1 G-ARMV, flown during a scheduled international passenger flight from Beauvais Airport, Oise, France, crashed on landing at its intended destination of Lympne Airport, Kent, United Kingdom. The accident {{was due to}} the grass runway being unable to support the weight of the aircraft during a <b>heavy</b> <b>landing.</b> This caused the nose wheels to dig in and the aircraft to overturn, losing both wings and the starboard tailplane in the process. All 52 people on board survived. This was the first accident involving the Avro 748/HS 748 that resulted in a write-off. A concrete runway was later installed at Lympne.|$|E
25|$|After {{the fall}} of Kos, the Italian {{garrison}} of Kalymnos surrendered, providing the Germans with a valuable base for operations against Leros. Unternehmen Leopard (Operation Leopard), was originally scheduled for 9 October but on 7 October, the Royal Navy intercepted and destroyed the German convoy headed for Kos. Several hundred men {{and most of the}} few German <b>heavy</b> <b>landing</b> craft were lost; replacements were transported by rail, and it was not until 5 November that the Germans had assembled a fleet of 24 light infantry landing craft. To avoid interception by the Allied navies, they were dispersed among several Aegean islands and camouflaged. Despite Allied efforts to locate and sink the invasion fleet, as well as repeated shelling of the ports of German-held islands, the Germans suffered few losses and were able to assemble their invasion force, under Generalleutnant Müller, for Unternehmen Taifun (Operation Typhoon) on 12 November.|$|E
50|$|Marion 6360, {{also known}} as The Captain, was a giant power shovel built by the Marion Power Shovel company. Completed in 1965, it was the <b>heaviest</b> <b>land</b> vehicle ever built.

The population is hard to estimate, but most probably between 1300 and 1700 mature birds (BirdLife International 2004), and recognisably in decline. In particular, <b>heavy</b> <b>land</b> clearance on the Jandía peninsula is isolating the local subpopulation and making it vulnerable to adverse effects of small population size.|$|R

25|$|According to Janes {{the navy}} is badly underfunded {{and much of}} its {{equipment}} {{is in need of}} maintenance; as a consequence it is scarcely able to carry out its tasks, with operations often delayed or cancelled. The navy's patrol craft are barely effective; fuel costs and maintenance problems mean that often only one boat is available for sea duty at any time, while the <b>heavy</b> <b>landing</b> craft have high upkeep costs and are nearing the end of their service life. Although the patrol boats may be at times serviceable, the task of patrolling such a large Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) is too great and they are heavily reliant for information about the presence of foreign ships on daily reports supplied by US satellite surveillance. The main concern is illegal tuna fishing by Japanese vessels. The navy would like larger vessels as the Pacific class experiences difficulties in deep ocean conditions and is exploring the possibility of procuring a 2,000 tonne multipurpose vessel, or the conversion of a merchant vessel, for patrol duties.|$|E
25|$|Promoted to wing {{commander}} on 1 July 1980, Squire was appointed Commanding Officer of No.1 (F) Squadron based at RAF Wittering flying Harriers in 1981. In 1982 Squire led {{members of his}} squadron in action in the Falklands campaign where {{he was awarded the}} Distinguished Flying Cross. He flew with his squadron to CFB Goose Bay in Canada on 13 April 1982, on a six-hour flight using air-to-air refuelling (AAR), for an exercise. He departed for the Falklands on 3 May with his squadron from RAF St Mawgan to RAF Ascension Island where a few days later they boarded the Atlantic Conveyor. Arriving in the South Atlantic, he transferred from the Atlantic Conveyor to HMS Hermes {{a few days before the}} Atlantic Conveyor was sunk by two Exocet missiles. During bombing sorties in support of ground forces, on one occasion a bullet passed through his cockpit and temporarily distracted him before he found an alternative target. On 9 June, his aircraft suffered engine failure and was damaged during a crash landing at the forward operating base ashore. On 13 June, he was the first member of the RAF to launch a laser-guided bomb (LGB), with the target being illuminated by Major Mike Howes, in combat on Mount Longdon flying a Harrier GR3 with No. 1(F) Squadron. Four Harriers from his squadron of ten were lost, three to ground fire and one after an engine failure led to a <b>heavy</b> <b>landing.</b> His squadron was also the first to operate in a combat role from a British aircraft carrier since the Second World War. Later in the year he was forced to eject on 6 November near Cape Pembroke in the Falklands due to a Harrier's engine failure.|$|E

Finucane was slow {{to come to grips}} with {{handling}} the aircraft and he suffered a series of mishaps. During his training, on 7 September, he nearly flew into an airfield boundary hedge. He struggled in landing and on another occasion just four days later, his tyre burst on landing approach. The Moth bounced up into the air and Finucane barely recovered to make a <b>heavy</b> <b>landing,</b> although this time he was praised by his instructor.

500|$|In 1956, the air force, in {{an effort}} to gain {{political}} support, planned a record flight from Córdoba to Buenos Aires to demonstrate the combat potential of the IAe 33. [...] The Pulqui II would fly 800km, strafe an air force practice range in the Buenos Aires area, and then return to Córdoba using only internal fuel. The only oxygen equipment available for such a long flight was scrounged from a FMA Meteor under repairs. Lt. Balado successfully completed the flight (including the strafing demonstration) at an average cruise speed of around 900km/h, but the oxygen system failed on the return leg. The semi-conscious pilot managed to perform an emergency landing at high speed, but the <b>heavy</b> <b>landing</b> and resulting stress broke the landing gear, with the Pulqui II overrunning the end of the runway, the aircraft being damaged beyond repair.|$|E
500|$|The first {{prototype}} {{was later}} used by Napier & Son at Luton for {{trials of the}} firm's inflight de-icing systems. It was then briefly used for ground-training purposes beginning on 30 April 1952, until scrapped shortly afterwards. The second prototype {{was used by the}} Royal Navy Carrier Trials Unit at RNAS Ford, Sussex, until it was sold for scrap on 15 September. The third prototype conducted ASV Mk.XV radar trials, but was damaged in a <b>heavy</b> <b>landing</b> on 1 September 1949 and sold for scrap on 22 August 1950 as uneconomical to repair. The fourth prototype never flew and was used as a source of spares.
