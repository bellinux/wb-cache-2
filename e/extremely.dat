5|$|Adults have <b>extremely</b> {{variable}} lifespans, from {{weeks to}} years, {{depending on the}} species. Some wood-boring beetles can have <b>extremely</b> long life-cycles. It is believed that when furniture or house timbers are infested by beetle larvae, the timber already contained the larvae {{when it was first}} sawn up. A birch bookcase 40 years old released adult Eburia quadrigeminata (Cerambycidae), while Buprestis aurulenta and other Buprestidae have been documented as emerging as much as 51 years after manufacture of wooden items.|$|E
5|$|Although not proven, {{recent data}} from the Galileo orbiter {{indicate}} that Io might have its own magnetic field. Io has an <b>extremely</b> thin atmosphere made up mostly of sulfur dioxide (SO2). If a surface data or collection vessel were to land on Io in the future, {{it would have to}} be <b>extremely</b> tough (similar to the tank-like bodies of the Soviet Venera landers) to survive the radiation and magnetic fields that originate from Jupiter.|$|E

5|$|Ji and Ji (1996) {{identified}} many {{features that}} set Sinosauropteryx {{apart from other}} birds and dinosaurs. They {{found that it was}} a small primitive bird with a relatively high skull, blunt rostrum and a slightly high premaxilla; that the antorbital fenestra was elliptical but not enlarged, the dentary was robust, the surangular was narrow and elongated, and the dentition is <b>extremely</b> well developed and acute; that there are over 50 <b>extremely</b> elongated caudals, constituting 60% of the body length, and the forelimb is <b>extremely</b> short with a short and thick humerus; the pubis was elongated and <b>extremely</b> inflated at its distal end and the ischium is broad; the hind limb was long and robust, the tibia is only slightly longer than the femur, the tarsals are separated, and the metatarsals are relatively robust with unfused proximal ends; the feathers are short, small, and uniform; many ornament the top of the skull, cervical, and dorsal regions, in addition to the dorsal and ventral caudal region.|$|E

5|$|With the {{exception}} of the Naktong delta to the south, and the valley between Taegu and P'ohang-dong, the terrain is <b>extremely</b> rough and mountainous. Northeast of P'ohang-dong along the South Korean line the terrain was especially treacherous, and movement in the region was <b>extremely</b> difficult. Thus, the UN established the Pusan Perimeter in a location outlined by the Sea of Japan to the south and east, the Naktong River to the west, and <b>extremely</b> mountainous terrain to the north, using the terrain as a natural defense. However the rough terrain also made communication difficult, particularly for the South Korean forces in the P'ohang-dong area.|$|E
5|$|With the unpopularity of the doctrine, the {{judiciary}} developed several ways around it. These were at times both complex and <b>extremely</b> artificial, {{and used the}} law relating to trusts and agencies, along with other areas and ideas such as collateral contracts.

5|$|Although corals first {{appeared}} in the Cambrian period, some , fossils are <b>extremely</b> rare until the Ordovician period, 100 million years later, when rugose and tabulate corals became widespread. Paleozoic corals often contained numerous endobiotic symbionts.|$|E
5|$|Although {{one might}} expect stylets to be fossilized since they are made of the mineral calcium phosphate, none have been found. As nemertea are {{otherwise}} completely soft-bodied, one would expect fossils {{of them to be}} <b>extremely</b> rare.|$|E
5|$|Animals {{such as the}} {{flounder}} {{have the}} ability to adapt their camouflage patterns to suit the background, and they do so <b>extremely</b> effectively, selecting patterns that match the spatial scales of the current background.|$|E
5|$|Argentina {{regularly}} receives {{cold air}} from the south that can reach low latitudes owing {{to the influence of}} the Andes. Cold waves are usually accompanied with severe snowstorms or <b>extremely</b> cold conditions that can have a devastating impact on the country's economy. These snowstorms and/or <b>extremely</b> cold conditions can partially or completely paralyze activities in large areas of Patagonia and the center of the country. In addition, cold conditions can lead to energy shortages during the winter months due to increased demand. The low temperatures brought by these cold waves can cause frosts that can damage plants, severely affecting agricultural production and devastating the local economy.|$|E
5|$|Aronofsky's {{first two}} films, Pi and Requiem for a Dream, were low-budget and used montages of <b>extremely</b> short shots, {{also known as}} hip hop montages. While an average 100-minute film has 600 to 700 cuts Requiem for a Dream {{features}} more than 2,000. Split-screen is used extensively, along with <b>extremely</b> tight closeups. Long tracking shots, including those shot with an apparatus strapping a camera to an actor, called the Snorricam, and time-lapse photography are also prominent stylistic devices. Often with his films, Aronofsky alternates between extreme closeups and extreme wide shots {{to create a sense}} of isolation.|$|E

5|$|Children of Men used several lengthy single-shot {{sequences}} {{in which}} <b>extremely</b> complex actions take place. The longest {{of these are}} a shot in which Kee gives birth (199 seconds; 3:19); an ambush on a country road (247 seconds; 4:07); and {{a scene in which}} Theo is captured by the Fishes, escapes, and runs down a street and through a building {{in the middle of a}} raging battle (378 seconds; 6:18). These sequences were <b>extremely</b> difficult to film, although the effect of continuity is sometimes an illusion, aided by CGI effects.|$|E

5|$|In 1961, Peveril Meigs divided desert regions on Earth {{into three}} {{categories}} according {{to the amount of}} precipitation they received. In this now widely accepted system, <b>extremely</b> arid lands have at least twelve consecutive months without precipitation, arid lands have less than 250mm (10in) of annual precipitation, and semiarid lands have a mean annual precipitation of between 250 and 500mm (10–20in). Both <b>extremely</b> arid and arid lands are considered to be deserts while semiarid lands are generally referred to as steppes when they are grasslands.|$|E
