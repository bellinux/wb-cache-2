Four years later, lymphadenopathy recurred and biopsy revealed {{the development of an}} <b>immunoblastic</b> <b>lymphoma.</b> Initially, this lymphoma was thought to be the malignant transformation of Waldenström's microglobulinaemia, because both tumours produced IgM (κ light chains). Sequencing of immunoglobulin heavy chain genes ofWaldenström's macroglobulinaemia and <b>immunoblastic</b> <b>lymphoma</b> cells, however, revealed different Dh and Jh usage between the two, indicating the independent nature of the two haematological malignancies.

40|$|Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), {{common among}} persons with {{acquired}} immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), is caused by KS herpesvirus (KSHV) but whether KSHV causes other malignancies is uncertain. Using linked United States AIDS and cancer registries, we measured the incidence of specific malignancies in persons with AIDS (4 – 27 months after AIDS onset). We identified associations with KSHV by calculating a relative risk: cancer incidence in persons with KS (all were KSHV-infected) divided by incidence in persons without KS. Using Poisson regression, relative risks were adjusted for human immunodeficiency virus risk group, gender, age, race, and calendar year. We included 189 159 subjects (26   972 with KS). <b>Immunoblastic</b> <b>lymphoma</b> {{was significantly associated with}} KS (506 cases; relative risks: unadjusted 2. 44, 95 %CI 2. 00 – 2. 96, adjusted 1. 58, 95 %CI 1. 29 – 1. 93). Only one <b>immunoblastic</b> <b>lymphoma</b> had pleura as primary site. None of 37 other specified malignancies (other non-Hodgkin lymphomas, haematological malignancies, solid tumours) was significantly associated with KS. In summary, the association of <b>immunoblastic</b> <b>lymphoma</b> with KS was specific among examined malignancies and remained significant after statistical adjustment. Our findings, and the previously demonstrated presence of KSHV in the histologically related primary effusion lymphoma, suggest that KSHV is involved in the pathogenesis of some immunoblastic lymphomas. © 2001 Cancer Research Campaig...|$|E

40|$|Within {{the group}} of primary {{cutaneous}} T-cell lymphomas (CTCLs), mycosis fungoides (MF), Sezary's syndrome (SS), and CD 30 -positive lymphomas have been delineated as clinicopathological entities. Primary CTCLs that {{do not belong to}} one of these entities represent a heterogeneous and ill-defined group of neoplasms. This paper describes the clinical and histological features of 35 of such cases. The object {{of this study was to}} define prognostic parameters for this group of primary CTCLs. Using a slightly modified version of the updated Kiel classification, a subdivision was made into CTCL, pleomorphic, small cell type (n= 3); pleomorphic, medium-sized cell type (n= 6); pleomorphic, large cell type (n= 18); and <b>immunoblastic</b> <b>lymphomas</b> (n= 8). Altogether, these lymphomas had a poor prognosis with estimated 2 - and 4 -year survival rates of 53 and 22 per cent, respectively. Patients with pleomorphic, small and medium-sized cell lymphomas (n= 9) proved to have a significantly better survival that those with pleomorphic, large cell lymphomas (P= 0. 032) and <b>immunoblastic</b> <b>lymphomas</b> (P= 0. 008). Primary cutaneous <b>immunoblastic</b> <b>lymphomas</b> had the worst prognosis with an estimated 2 -year survival rate of 14 per cent. Other parameters including age (P= 0. 345), sex (P= 0. 662), extent of skin lesions at presentation (P= 0. 0854), and mode of initial treatment (P= 0. 609) had no significant effect on the survival time. The results of this study suggest that primary CTCLs other than classical MF, SS, and CD 30 -positive lymphomas have a poor prognosis in most cases, and that the current classification may be a useful means of predicting the clinical behaviour in these lymphomas...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Chronic {{myeloid leukemia}} arises from a somatic {{mutation}} in a pluripotent stem cell. It generally terminates with a blastic crisis (BC). One third of BC are lymphoid, {{and most have}} a pre-B phenotype. Few cases of T-lymphoid BC have been reported. Here we describe a lymph node blast crisis mimicking T-immunoblastic lymphoma. METHODS: Bone marrow and lymph nodes were histologically examined by standard methods and by an immunoperoxidase technique. Cytogenetic studies were also performed on lymph node and blood cells. Analysis of T-cell receptor genes and BCR rearrangements were performed on DNA extracted from both frozen bone marrow and lymph-node cells. RESULTS: Lymph-node histology showed an infiltration by large lymphoid blasts, consistent with a diagnosis of <b>immunoblastic</b> <b>lymphoma.</b> Blast cells were CD 2, CD 7, TDT positive, and negative for myeloid and mature lymphoid antigens. The Ph 1 chromosome was found in both bone marrow and lymph-node cells. BCR rearrangement {{was found in the}} DNA from both bone marrow and lymph-node cells. TCR genes were not rearranged. DISCUSSION: The present study provides strong evidence that the lymph-node blast crisis of CML can assume the morphological appearance of <b>immunoblastic</b> <b>lymphoma</b> and may retain the immunological phenotype and genetic features of early T cells with BCR rearrangement...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is the causative {{agent of}} {{immunosuppression}} associated lymphoproliferations such as post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD), AIDS related <b>immunoblastic</b> <b>lymphomas</b> (ARL) and <b>immunoblastic</b> <b>lymphomas</b> in X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome (XLP). The reported overall mortality for PTLD often exceeds 50 %. Reducing the immunosuppression in recipients of solid organ transplants (SOT) or using {{highly active antiretroviral therapy}} in AIDS patients leads to complete remission in 23 – 50 % of the PTLD/ARL cases {{but will not}} suffice for recipients of bone marrow grafts. An additional therapeutic alternative is the treatment with anti-CD 20 antibodies (Rituximab) or EBV-specific cytotoxic T-cells. Chemotherapy is used for the non-responding cases only as the second or third line of treatment. The most frequently used chemotherapy regimens originate from the non-Hodgkin lymphoma protocols and there are no cytotoxic drugs that have been specifically selected against EBV induced lymphoproliferative disorders. Methods As lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) are well established in vitro models for PTLD, we have assessed 17 LCLs for cytotoxic drug sensitivity. After three days of incubation, live and dead cells were differentially stained using fluorescent dyes. The precise numbers of live and dead cells were determined using a custom designed automated laser confocal fluorescent microscope. Results Independently of their origin, LCLs showed very similar drug sensitivity patterns against 29 frequently used cytostatic drugs. LCLs were highly sensitive for vincristine, methotrexate, epirubicin and paclitaxel. Conclusion Our data shows that the inclusion of epirubicin and paclitaxel into chemotherapy protocols against PTLD may be justified. </p...|$|R

A significantly increased incidence of lymphoma has also been demonstrated in HIV infected patients and within this group the prevalence is rising. This rise reflects not only the increasing number of people infected with the HIV virus, but also their improved survival as a consequence of advances in antiretroviral therapy and the more effective management of opportunistic infections.

40|$|Background. The {{treatment}} of posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) remains empirical. We review our {{treatment of}} seven cases of PTLD consisting of five interventions: 1) reduction of immunosuppression; 2) antiviral drugs; 3) interferon-alpha; 4) gamma-globulins; and 5) anti-CD 19 monoclonal antibodies. Methods and Results. Seven consecutive {{patients who had}} undergone a simultaneous pancreas-kidney, liver, heart, or kidney transplantation were treated. One patient acquired a primary EBV infection with an oligoclonal <b>immunoblastic</b> <b>lymphoma</b> early after pancreas-kidney transplantation; all others developed a monoclonal polymorphic or <b>immunoblastic</b> <b>lymphoma</b> 2 to 123 months after transplantation. In all patients extranodal sites were involved, in three the graft was also involved. Five patients received the full quintuple approach and all rapidly obtained a complete remission (CR) with a median follow-up of 31 months (7 - 74 months). Of the two patients who did not receive interferon-alpha for fear of graft rejection one responded slowly with a CR after 7 months, and the other obtained a rapid CR followed by a relapse at 4 months, All three patients with a liver or heart transplant could keep their graft. All patients are still alive with a median follow-up of 31 months (7 - 74 months). Conclusion. This combined approach resulted in a favorable outcome in patients with high risk monoclonal PTLD after solid organ transplantation...|$|E

40|$|Non-Hodgkin {{lymphoma}} {{is associated}} with HIV infection. We investigated the epidemiology and aetiology of AIDS-related non-Hodgkin lymphoma by analysing data from cases reported to the Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, USA, up to June 30, 1989. During this period 97, 258 AIDS cases were reported, of whom 2824 (2. 9 %) had non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The condition was about 60 times more common in AIDS patients than in the general US population. 1686 cases were <b>immunoblastic</b> <b>lymphoma,</b> 548 primary lymphoma of the brain, and 590 Burkitt's lymphoma, a condition which is not normally associated with immunosuppression. The proportion of AIDS patients with <b>immunoblastic</b> <b>lymphoma</b> increased from 0 % in those under 1 year old to 3. 5 % in those aged 50 or more. Primary lymphoma of the brain was constant at 0. 6 % for all ages. The frequency of Burkitt's lymphoma increased from zero in infants to a peak at 10 - 19 years of age (1. 8 %). Each type of lymphoma was twice as common in whites as in blacks and in men as in women. Lymphoma was most common in patients with haemophilia or clotting disorders and least common in those born in the Caribbean or Africa who had acquired HIV by heterosexual contact. Epidemiological data suggested that whilst infectious agents (eg, Epstein-Barr virus) {{may be associated with}} development of non-Hodgkin lymphomas in AIDS patients there was probably no single cause for all the types of lymphoma. Perhaps the most puzzling question is why Burkitt's lymphoma is commonly associated with HIV infection but not with other types of immunosuppression...|$|E
40|$|Combined clinicopathologic and immunomorphologic {{evidence}} is presented {{that would indicate}} that a murine leukemia virus (MuLV) with the dualtropic host range is capable of producing a clinically malignant lesion composed of immunoblasts and associated plasma cells in C 57 BL/ 6 mice. This process, morphologically diagnosed as an <b>immunoblastic</b> <b>lymphoma</b> of B cells using standard histopathologic criteria, {{was found to be}} distinctly polyclonal with regard to immunoglobulin (Ig) isotype when analyzed for both surface and cytoplasmic Ig. Further studies demonstrated that this clinicopathologically malignant, dualtropic MuLV-induced, polyclonal <b>immunoblastic</b> <b>lymphoma</b> of B cells in C 57 BL/ 6 mice was normal diploid and unable to be successfully transplanted to nonimmunosuppressed syngeneic recipients. Although all serum heavy and light chain components were found to be progressively elevated as the tumor load increased, the polyclonal increase in serum immunoglobulins was most pronounced for mu heavy and kappa light chains (ie, mu greater than gamma 2 A greater than alpha greater than gamma 2 B greater than gamma 1; kappa greater than lamba). The dissociation of clinicopathologic and biologic criteria for malignancy in the presently described dualtropic (RadLV) MuLV-induced B-cell lesion is sharply contrasted with the thymotropic (RadLV), MuLV-induced T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma in C 57 BL/ 6 mice. This process is also a clinicopathologically malignant lesion but, when one uses biologic criteria, is found to be distinctly monoclonal, aneuploid, and easily transplanted to nonimmunosuppressed syngeneic recipients.

METHOD [...] Sections from paraffin wax blocks of 22 lymphoid proliferations arising in the sinonasal region or Waldeyer's ring were studied with EBV encoded RNAs (EBER- 1 and - 2) using in situ hybridisation. RESULTS [...] EBV was detected in nuclei of tumour cells {{of five of}} seven T cell lymphomas and in nuclei of two of seven diffuse, large cell <b>immunoblastic</b> <b>lymphomas</b> of B phenotype in the sinonasal region. Of tumours arising in Waldeyer's ring, two of 10 non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (both large cell) were positive, as was a single case of Hodgkin's disease.

Nevertheless the patient lapsed into a hypotonic coma. The urinary concentrations of the main tubular enzymes (gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase, N-acetyl-glucosaminidase, alpha-glucosidase) proved very high and successively decreased slowly.

As a disorder of cellular immunoregulation in which lymphoid cells may escape normal growth controls, AILD provides a natural model to dissect stages of lymphomagenesis in man...|$|E
40|$|Thirty four {{patients}} {{positive for}} {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV) who had lymphadenopathy were investigated using fine needle aspiration. Cytological analysis included immunocytochemical investigation with the alkaline phosphatase-antialkaline phosphatase (APAAP) method. All patients had confirmation of cytological diagnosis by lymph node biopsy. Fifteen aspirates with follicular hyperplasia were evaluated. Eleven patients showed B cell predominance. The B cell population did not show light chain restriction. Ten patients with B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (five with Burkitt's lymphoma and five with B cell <b>immunoblastic</b> <b>lymphoma)</b> were investigated. Nine out of 10 cases were monoclonal {{with respect to their}} light chain determinants; only one case with Burkitt's lymphoma with partial lymph node metastasis did not show light chain restriction. The cytological diagnosis included two mycobacterial infections and four cystic lesions. Histological investigation was necessary to diagnose the extent of lymph node disease caused by Kaposi's sarcoma. These findings indicate that the immunocytological investigation of lymph node aspirates is useful for evaluating lymphadenopathy in HIV positive patients...|$|E
40|$|Intermediate {{and high}} grade subtypes of non-Hodgkin's large cell (LCL) and <b>immunoblastic</b> <b>lymphomas</b> exhibit {{considerable}} variability, and histologic morphology alone may not adequately characterize those features important for prognosis. The relationship between nuclear morphology and survival was assessed {{in a series}} of 50 cases of large cell lymphomas in which ploidy, proliferation, and nuclear area (NA) were measured. Ploidy was calculated by both DNA index (DI) and DNA histogram type (DHT). Proliferation was calculated from the proportion of S phase (SPF) cells present in the DHT. These four parameters were measured using image cytometry of Feulgen-stained nuclei from fine-needle aspirations. To characterize the relationship with survival, these parameters were associated with the clinical follow-up of the patients. The results show that of the 50 LCL cases, only 5 were clearly aneuploid, whereas the remaining 45 were either diploid (29 cases), tetraploid/hypotetraploid (13 cases), or weakly aneuploid (hyperdiploid, 3 cases). Of the 34 patients who died from their disease, both smaller NA and DI correlated with longer survival in an equivalent fashion; neither conferred greater sensitivity when combined with the other. The SPF did not correlate with survival. In LCL, aneuploidy seems to be a relatively uncommon event, but when present ploidy measurement appears useful to define prognosis.

40|$|Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a {{herpesvirus}} that transforms B-cells (B-LCL) and {{has undergone}} intense scrutiny owing to {{its association with}} Burkitt's lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and <b>immunoblastic</b> <b>lymphomas.</b> B-LCL have also proven useful {{in the study of}} human immunology. We describe a novel system for inducing efficient foreign gene expression in B-LCL using biotinylated adenovirus as an endosome-disrupting agent. Plasmid DNA is coupled to the exterior of viral particles by streptavidin-polylysine chimeric proteins. Up to 67 % of B-LCL may be induced to express foreign genes in vitro in transient expression systems, and gene expression lasts for at least 17 days. We have expressed firefly luciferase, β-galactosidase (β-gal), chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, HIV gag, and env genes, as well as infectious HIV, and the EBV-specific BZLF gene in B-LCL with this system. In vivo delivery of a β-gal reporter gene to B-LCL was documented in a SCID mouse model. Potential applications include study of genetic regulation of EBV infection and transformation events, study of potential gene therapies for EBV-related B-cell tumors, and production of antigen-presenting cells for use in immunologic assays. Because of the high percentage of cells transformed and the length of foreign gene expression, the possibility of examining foreign gene expression in transient assays, without selection for clonal populations, exists. ...|$|R
40|$|Fifty-two B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, {{in which}} the {{diagnosis}} was based on immunological, cytochemical, and ultrastructural studies, were characterised by morphometry on plastic-embedded tissue sections. Parameters studied were: nuclear size, cytoplasmic area, cytoplasm to nucleus ratio, nuclear contour index, nucleolar size, location of nucleoli within the nucleus, as expressed by relative nucleolar eccentricity, and {{the mean number of}} nucleoli per nuclear cross-section. The results of the measurements and subsequent statistical analysis show that the different types of lymphoma can be distinguished from each other, even though the differences were small. Small cell lymphomas (chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, lymphoplasmacytoid and polymorphic immunocytoma, centrocytic, centroblastic/centrocytic and intermediate lymphocytic lymphomas) could be separated from each other by the standard error of mean (SEM) of nuclear area, the cytoplasm to nucleus ratio, and nuclear contour index. Large cell lymphomas (centroblastic and B <b>immunoblastic</b> <b>lymphomas)</b> could be differentiated with cytoplasm to nucleus ratio and nucleolar parameters (relative nucleolar eccentricity and number of nucleoli per nuclear cross-section). The morphometric parameters of lymphoblastic lymphomas fell in the range of the large cell lymphomas, but lower SEM indicate these lymphomas were more monomorphic. These morphometric data underline the concept of the Kiel classification and establish the usefulness of morphometry as an additional technique in diagnosis...|$|R
