However, since interactions between the cytokines and SHH during H. pylori infection are not well understood, any mechanistic understanding achieved through interpretation of the statistical analysis of experimental results {{in the context of}} currently known circuit must be carefully scrutinized. Here, we use mathematical modeling aided by restraints of experimental data to evaluate the consistency between experimental results and temporal behavior of H. pylori activated cytokine circuit model. Statistical analysis of qPCR data from uninfected and H. pylori infected wild-type and parietal cell-specific SHH knockout (PC-SHHKO) mice for day 7 and 180 indicate significant changes that suggest role of SHH in cytokine regulation. The experimentally observed changes are further investigated using a mathematical model that examines <b>dynamic</b> <b>crosstalks</b> among pro-inflammatory (IL 1 β, IL- 12, IFNγ, MIP- 2) cytokines, anti-inflammatory (IL- 10) cytokines and SHH during H. pylori infection. Response analysis of the resulting model demonstrates that circuitry, as currently known, is inadequate for explaining of the experimental observations; suggesting the need for additional specific regulatory interactions. A key advantage of a computational model is the ability to propose putative circuit models for in-silico experimentation. We use this approach to propose a parsimonious model that incorporates crosstalks between NFĸB, SHH, IL- 1 β and IL- 10, resulting in a feedback loop capable of exhibiting cyclic behavior. Separately, we show that analysis of an independent time-series GEO microarray data for IL- 1 β, IFNγ and IL- 10 in mock and H. pylori infected mice further supports the proposed hypothesis that these cytokines may follow a cyclic trend. Predictions from the in-silico model provide useful insights for generating new hypothesis and design of subsequent experimental studies...|$|R

This is achieved by wiring signalling pathways such that they can interact with each other, a phenomenon often called crosstalk. In this study, we employ mathematical modelling techniques to analyse dynamic mechanisms and measures of crosstalk. We present a dynamic mathematical model that compiles current knowledge about the wiring of the pheromone pathway and the filamentous growth pathway in yeast. We consider the main dynamic features and the interconnections between the two pathways in order to study <b>dynamic</b> <b>crosstalk</b> between these two pathways in haploid cells. We introduce two new measures of <b>dynamic</b> <b>crosstalk,</b> the intrinsic specificity and the extrinsic specificity. These two measures incorporate the combined signal of several stimuli being present simultaneously and seem to be more stable than previous measures. When both pathways are responsive and stimulated, the model predicts that (a) the filamentous growth pathway amplifies the response of the pheromone pathway, and (b) the pheromone pathway inhibits the response of filamentous growth pathway in terms of mitogen activated protein kinase activity and transcriptional activity, respectively. Among several mechanisms we identified leakage of activated Ste 11 as the most influential source of crosstalk. Moreover, we propose new experiments and predict their outcomes in order to test hypotheses about the mechanisms of crosstalk between the two pathways.

While conventional hyperspectral imaging instruments have typically used rows of linescan CCDs, CMOS image sensors (CIS) have been slowly penetrating space instrumentation for the past decade, and Earth observation (EO) is no exception. CIS provide distinct advantages over CCDs that are relevant to EO hyperspectral imaging.

Transistors are formed in active regions in FEOL while BEOL processing focuses on creation of metal interconnects and interlevel dielectrics (ILDs). These dielectrics patterned in BEOL are required to have low permittivity or k values in order to mitigate parasitic capacitance. This reduction in capacitance between metal layers diminishes <b>dynamic</b> power dissipation, <b>crosstalk</b> noise, and interconnect delay issues as IC technology nodes continue to scale down in size. Dielectric constants between 2. 0 to 2. 7 are required for sub 90 nm CMOS technology. Organosilicate glass (OSG) has been chosen as a candidate in this thesis study due to its k value being within the required range. OSG film was deposited on pilot wafers via Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition (PECVD) using a reaction between organosilane and oxygen gases. A challenge that has been identified in patterning OSG as an interlevel dielectric film occurs during the photoresist removal or ash process.

40|$|Abstract This thesis {{deals with}} the {{developing}} of fibre-optic instruments for monitoring the health of civil engineering and composite structures. A number of sensors have been tested for use with different road structures, concrete bridges, fibre reinforced polymer (FRP) containers and other composite specimens, the interrogation methods being mainly based on measuring optical power and time-of-flight (TOF). The main {{focus is on the}} development of a fibre-optic TOF measurement system and its applications, but different sensing needs and fibre-optic measurement systems are also reviewed, with the emphasis on commercial devices. Deformation in a road structure was studied with microbending sensors of gauge-length about 10 cm and a commercial optical time domain reflectometer (OTDR) in a quasi-distributed fashion. The responses of the optical fibre sensors during the one-year measurement period were similar in shape to those obtained with commercial strain gauges but the absolute measurement values typically deviated by several tens of per cent. Low <b>dynamic</b> range, <b>crosstalk</b> and poor signal-to-noise ratio proved to be the main problem when measuring several successive sensors with an OTDR. In another road investigation, microbending and speckle sensors were found useful for providing on/off-type information for traffic control applications. FRP composite containers were investigated with the focus on developing a continuous monitoring system for improving yield and quality by evaluating the state of cure during the manufacturing process and for assessing damage, e. g. delaminations, during service life. Standard multi-mode and single mode fibres with a typical length of a few hundreds of metres were embedded inside the walls of containers during the normal manufacturing process, and the measurements were carried out using an optical through-power technique and an OTDR. This largely empirical investigation revealed that the coating material and its thickness have an effect on loading sensitivity and on the applicability of the method for cure monitoring. The measurement data also indicated that the end-of-curing process and the location of external damage can be determined with a distributed optical fibre sensor and an OTDR. Several versions of a pulsed time-of-flight measurement system were developed for interrogating sensor arrays consisting of multiple long gauge-length sensors. The early versions based on commercial electronics were capable of producing relevant measurement data with a reasonable precision, but they suffered especially from poor spatial resolution, low sampling rate and long-term drift. The high precision TOF system developed in this thesis is capable of measuring time delays between a number of wideband reflectors, such as connectors or fibre Bragg gratings (FBG), along a fibre path with a precision of about 280 fs (rms-value) and a spatial resolution of about 3 ns (0. 30 m) in a measurement time of 25 milliseconds. By using a fibre loop sensor with a reference fibre, a strain precision below 1 με and a measurement frequency of 4 Hz can be achieved. The system has proved comparable in performance to a commercial FBG interrogation system in monitoring the behaviour of a bridge deck, while the fact that it allows static and dynamic measurements with a number of long gauge-length sensors, also embedded in FRP composite material, makes this TOF device unique relative to other measurement systems...|$|R
40|$|Inferring {{time-varying}} networks {{is important}} to understand the development and evolution of interactions over time. However, the vast majority of currently used models assume direct measurements of node states, which are often difficult to obtain, especially in fields like cell biology, where perturbation experiments often only provide indirect information of network structure. Here we propose hidden Markov nested effects models (HM-NEMs) to model the evolving network by a Markov chain on a state space of signalling networks, which are derived from nested effects models (NEMs) of indirect perturbation data. To infer the hidden network evolution and unknown parameter, a Gibbs sampler is developed, in which sampling network structure is facilitated by a novel structural Metropolis [...] Hastings algorithm. We demonstrate the potential of HM-NEMs by simulations on synthetic time-series perturbation data.

40|$|Multi-walled carbon {{nanotube}} (MWCNT) bundles have potentially provided attractive solutions in current nanoscale VLSI interconnects. From fabrication point of view, {{it is difficult}} to control the growth of a densely packed bundle having MWCNTs with similar diameters. A realistic bundle is combination of MWCNTs with different number of shells. Thus, this research work focuses on the analytical model of a bundle having the MWCNTs with different number of shells or in turn different diameters [mixed MWCNT bundle (MMB) ]. Based on the multi-conductor transmission line theory, an equivalent single conductor (ESC) model is employed for the proposed MMB arrangements. The ESC model of MMB is used to compare the <b>dynamic</b> <b>crosstalk</b> delay with conventionally arranged bundle containing MWCNTs with similar diameters [MWCNT bundle (MB) ] under different input transition time and spacing conditions. It is observed that a realistic MMB correctly estimates the crosstalk delay for the different transition time that overestimates the delay of a conventionally arranged MB by 1. 35 times. Moreover, the MMB arrangement reduces the overall crosstalk delay by 47. 26 % compared with the conventional MB arrangements for an inter-bundle spacing ranging from 5 to 30 nm...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTumor {{angiogenesis}} {{is regulated}} by a <b>dynamic</b> <b>crosstalk</b> between tumor cells {{and the host}} microenvironment. Because membrane vesicles shed by tumor cells are known to mediate several tumor—host interactions, we determined whether vesicles might also stimulate angiogenesis. Vesicles shed by human ovarian carcinoma cell lines CABAI and A 2780 stimulated the motility and invasiveness of endothelial cells in vitro. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot analysis revealed relevant amounts of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and the two matrix metalloproteinases MMP- 2 and MMP- 9, but not fibroblast growth factor- 2, contained in shed vesicles. An A 2780 cell—derived clone transfected to overexpress VEGF shed {{the same amount of}} vesicles as did a control clone, but contained significantly more VEGF within the vesicles. Despite a greater amount of VEGF in vesicles of the overexpressing clone, vesicles of both clones stimulated endothelial cell motility to comparable levels, suggesting that VEGF was stored within the vesicle and was unavailable. Only following vesicle burst induced by acidic pH (a characteristic of the tumormicroenvironment) was VEGF released, leading to significantly higher stimulation of cell motility. Thus, tumor-shed membrane vesicles carry VEGF and release it in a bioactive form in conditions typical of the tumor microenvironment...|$|E
40|$|The {{skeleton}} {{represents a}} common site of metastases for osteotropic cancers such as prostate and breast tumors and novel therapeutic targets and new markers for the monitoring of bone lesions are urgently needed. The formation of bone metastases {{is a complex}} process that starts {{at the level of}} the confined tumor and that is characterized by a <b>dynamic</b> <b>crosstalk</b> between the primary cancer and the future metastatic site, the bone. Factors released by the primary tumor contribute to prepare a fertile “soil”, where a “pre-metastatic niche” is established prior to future colonization by cancer cells. When the primary cancer progress from the confined disease to its invasive phase, tumor cells will acquire an invasive phenotype, enter into the circulation and colonize the previously prepared site where they will establish a “metastatic niche”. Among the variety of molecules that participate in the metastatic cascade, microRNAs are a class of small non-coding RNA that play an important role in the development of metastatic bone lesions. Many studies have addressed the role of small non-coding RNAs (miRs) in metastasis in osteotropic cancers and have highlighted the role of miRs as oncogenes (oncomiRs) or tumor suppressor miRs. In this review we present describe the role of miRs in the processing of the supportive bone microenvironment prior and after the bone colonization by cancer cells. Finally, future therapeutic strategies and perspectives are also discussed...|$|E
40|$|Cancer, {{as one of}} the non-communicable diseases, {{remains one}} of the leading causes of death around the world. Since immune cells that {{infiltrate}} tumors engage in an extensive and <b>dynamic</b> <b>crosstalk</b> with cancer cells, inflammatory responses play decisive roles at different stages of tumor development, including initiation, promotion, malignant conversion, invasion, and metastasis. Inflammation also affects immune surveillance and therapy sensitivity. Recent successes of therapeutic interventions in cancer and inflammatory diseases using epigenetic modifiers such as histone deacetylase inhibitors and inhibitors of DNA methylation suggest that epigenetic reprogramming {{plays an important role in}} the aetiology of these diseases. Epigenetic changes in DNA methylation patterns at CpG sites (epimutations) or corrupt chromatin states of tumor promoting genes and noncoding RNAs, recently emerged as major governing factors in tumor progression and cancer drug sensitivity. Epigenetic defects (epimutations) are thought to be more easily reversible (when compared with genetic defects) and, as such, have inspired efforts to identify novel compounds that correct epimutations or prevent disease progression. Given the fact that epigenetic modifications occur early in carcinogenesis and represent potentially initiating events in cancer development, they have been identified as promising new targets for chemoprevention strategies. Numerous clinical, epidemiological and laboratory studies have identified various promising nutritional anti-inflammatory compounds as chemopreventive agents, which affect carcinogenic epigenetic marks in the body and the host immune system, and protect against aggressive cancer malignancies. This has recently launched reexploration of chemopreventive phytochemicals for identification of epigenetic targets which allow epigenetic (re) programming of cancer stem cells, prevent metastasis or sensitize for drug sensitivity. This review will discuss mechanisms of epigenome plasticity by cancer-inflammation and chemopreventive phytochemicals...|$|E
40|$|<b>Dynamic</b> <b>crosstalk</b> between {{growth factor}} receptors, cell {{adhesion}} molecules and extracellular matrix {{is essential for}} cancer cell migration and invasion. Integrins are transmembrane receptors that bind extracellular matrix proteins and enable cell adhesion and cytoskeletal organization. They also mediate signal transduction to regulate cell proliferation and survival. The type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-IR) mediates tumor cell growth, adhesion and inhibition of apoptosis in several types of cancer. We have previously demonstrated that b 1 integrins regulate anchorage-independent growth of prostate cancer (PrCa) cells by regulating IGF-IR expression and androgen receptor-mediated transcriptional functions. Furthermore, we have recently reported that IGF-IR regulates the expression of b 1 integrins in PrCa cells. We have dissected the mechanism through which IGF-IR regulates b 1 integrin expression in PrCa. Here we report that IGF-IR is crucial for PrCa cell growth and that b 1 integrins contribute to the regulation of proliferation by IGF-IR. We demonstrate that b 1 integrin regulation by IGF-IR does not occur at the mRNA level. Exogenous expression of a CD 4 - b 1 integrin cytoplasmic domain chimera does not interfere with such regulation and fails to stabilize b 1 integrin expression {{in the absence of}} IGF-IR. This appears to be {{due to the lack of}} interaction between the b 1 cytoplasmic domain and IGF-IR. We demonstrate that IGF-IR stabilizes the b 1 subunit by protecting it from proteasomal degradation. The a 5 subunit, one of the binding partners of b 1, is also downregulated along with b 1 upon IGF-IR knockdown while no change is observed in the expression of the a 2, a 3, a 4, a...|$|E
