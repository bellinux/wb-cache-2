25|$|Grossular is a calcium-aluminium garnet {{with the}} formula Ca3Al2(SiO4)3, though the calcium may in part be {{replaced}} by ferrous iron and the aluminium by ferric iron. The name grossular {{is derived from the}} botanical name for the gooseberry, grossularia, in reference to the green garnet of this composition that is found in Siberia. Other shades include cinnamon brown (cinnamon stone variety), red, and yellow. Because of its inferior hardness to zircon, which the yellow crystals resemble, they have also been called <b>hessonite</b> from the Greek meaning inferior. Grossular is found in contact metamorphosed limestones with vesuvianite, diopside, wollastonite and wernerite.|$|E
2500|$|All {{species of}} garnets possess similar {{physical}} properties and crystal forms, but differ in chemical composition. [...] The different species are pyrope, almandine, spessartine, grossular (varieties {{of which are}} <b>hessonite</b> or cinnamon-stone and tsavorite), uvarovite and andradite. The garnets make up two solid solution series: pyrope-almandine-spessartine and uvarovite-grossular-andradite.|$|E
2500|$|Yahalom (יָהֳלֹם = in the masoretic text) / Onychion (in the Septuagint) - in {{some other}} places the Septuagint instead has Beryllios where the masoretic reads Yahalom. The word Yahalom appears to be {{connected}} with the Hebrew meaning strike hard, and possibly with the word hallamish meaning flint; hallamish {{is connected to the}} Assyrian word elmeshu, referring to a precious stone which was hard, and possibly white, or at least with an insignificant colour, and from which whole rings were sometimes made. A few scholars have suggested that Yahalom may refer to diamonds, owing to their hardness, though the skill of cutting diamonds had not been discovered before the classical era. Although the Septuagint's Onychion is the Greek term for Onyx, Onyx was not mined prior to the era of classical Greece. Onyx is derived from the Greek for fingernail, due to the pink-white veining. In the Syriac Peshitta of the sixth or seventh century (MS. B.21, Inferiore of the Ambrosian Library in Milan, Italy), the word used to describe this stone is ܢܩܥܬܐ = naq'atha, a word which is sometimes transliterated into Arabic as it is pronounced in Aramaic, mainly by Arabic-speaking Christians. Bar-Ali, a 9th-century Arab author, brings down two opinions about this stone, the naq'atha, saying, by one opinion, that it is [...] "honey-coloured," [...] and by the other opinion that it is [...] "turquoise, a blue-coloured stone." [...] In some versions of the Peshitta, the Aramaic word rendered for the same stone is shabzez, translated as [...] "diamond." [...] This may account for today's understanding of this word, although in ancient times yahalom may have meant something else. Of the well-known honey-coloured gemstones, we find Citrene and <b>Hessonite</b> garnet (both, from Sri Lanka), while in Africa (Tanzania) we find Imperial Zircon, a honey-coloured stone with an extreme brilliance. Spanish Jewish scholar, Abraham ibn Ezra says the yahalom was a white stone.|$|E
50|$|It has a {{characteristic}} red color, inclining to orange or yellow, {{much like that}} of zircon. It was shown many years ago, by Sir Arthur Herbert Church, that many gemstones, especially engraved gems (commonly regarded as zircon), were actually <b>hessonite.</b> The difference is readily detected by the specific gravity, that of <b>hessonite</b> being 3.64 to 3.69, while that of zircon is about 4.6. <b>Hessonite</b> has a similar hardness to that of quartz (being about 7 on the mohs scale), while the hardness of most garnet species is nearer 7.5.|$|E

50|$|<b>Hessonite</b> or Cinnamon Stone, is a {{more common}} variety of {{grossular}} with the general formula: Ca3Al2Si3O12. The name comes from the ἣσσων (hēssōn), meaning inferior; an allusion to its lower hardness and lower density than most other garnet species varieties.|$|E

A ruby (representing the Sun) is always in the center, surrounded (clockwise from the top) by a diamond, a natural pearl, red coral, <b>hessonite,</b> a blue sapphire, cat's eye, a yellow sapphire, and an emerald. This is the same placement as the Nava-graha Yantra.|$|E
5000|$|Late Thai astrologer Horacharn Thep Sarikabutr {{has given}} the meaning of these nine gems in his Parichad-Jataka (chapter 2, verse 21, page 35-36) {{translated}} as follows:"Top quality and flawless ruby is the gem for the Sun, natural pearl for the Moon, red coral for Mars, emerald for Mercury yellow sapphire for Jupiter, diamond for Venus, blue sapphire for Saturn, <b>hessonite</b> for Rahu (ascending lunar node), and cat's eye for Ketu (descending lunar node)." ...|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} {{precious}} stones are mined and polished for local {{as well as}} export purposes. The centre point of this operation is Khyber-Pakhtoonkhwa and most recently Gilgit-Baltistan. These include actinolite, <b>hessonite,</b> rodingite, agate, idocrase, rutile, aquamarine, jadeite, ruby, amazonite, kunzite, serpentine, azurite, kyanite, spessartine (garnet), beryl, marganite, spinel, emerald, moonstone, topaz, epidote, pargasite, tourmaline, garnet (alamandine), peridot, turquoise, grossular, quartz (citrine & others) and vesuvianite. The export earned from these gems is more than 200 Million dollars.|$|E
50|$|A monoclinic mineral, clinohumite is {{typically}} a dark to light brownish or orangy yellow, somewhat resembling the <b>hessonite</b> variety of grossular. Clinohumite's crystal habit is usually granular, {{but may also}} be prismatic; crystals are almost always small. Simple and multiple crystal twinning (on {001}) is common, resulting in a highly variable habit. Clinohumite is brittle with a hardness of 6 and a poor basal cleavage. Its specific gravity is 3.2 - 3.4, and its fracture is conchoidal to uneven; its streak is white.|$|E

5000|$|Gems: {{how to buy}} them?First the shape, color, defects or excellences of a gem {{should be}} {{carefully}} tested and then its price should be ascertained in consultation with a gem expert who has studied all the books dealing with the precious stones. —Garuda Purana, Purvakhanda, Chapter 68(Translator: MN Dutt) The Garuda Purana describes 14 gems, their varieties and how to test their quality. The gems discussed include Ruby, Pearl, Yellow Sapphire, <b>Hessonite,</b> Emerald, Diamond, Cats eye, Blue Sapphire, Coral, Red Garnet, Jade, colorless Quartz, and Bloodstone. The technical discussion of gems in the text is woven with its theories on the mythical creation of each gem, astrological significance and talisman benefits.|$|E
