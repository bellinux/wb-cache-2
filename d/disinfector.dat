40|$|Background: Contamination is a {{key element}} in cystic fibrosis. For this reason, {{nebulizer}} hygiene is an important, but complex and time-consuming task for cystic fibrosis patients. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare different steam disinfection and drying protocols. Methods: One hundred nebulizer parts were inoculated with cystic fibrosis-related bacteria in high concentrations (Burkholderia multivorans 3. 9 × 1010 /ml, Staphylococcus aureus 8. 9 × 108 /ml and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 2. 1 × 109 /ml). Tubes with Mycobacterium abscessus complex were additionally tested. Six steam <b>disinfectors</b> were compared. Different methods of drying were examined. Results: All tested bacteria were efficiently killed by the different steam <b>disinfectors</b> tested. The risk of contamination depended on the method of drying. Conclusions: Steam disinfection is a safe disinfection method. It is better to leave the nebulizers wet after steam disinfection than to manipulate them by active drying, which seems to be a source of recontamination...|$|R

50|$|By 1928, the Lytton Quarantine Station {{facilities}} {{had been}} extended and enhanced. Vessels were {{met at the}} river mouth by the Health Authorities who boarded each ship (two launches were kept at Lytton) and inspected all goods and personnel on board. Suspect people and goods were landed at Lytton for fumigation and isolation. Jetty facilities permitted passengers to disembark on foot and a crane was provided for conveying sick passengers, luggage and stores to shore. A tram line ran from the jetty to the reception house. A permanent staff of a foreman assistant, two engine-drivers, a coxswain and four assistants was employed to maintain the facilities and attend to non-human quarantine, which included disinfection of luggage and materials using a steam <b>disinfector</b> (autoclave) with attachments for cyanide or formaldehyde gas. A bathing block permitted 10 cabin passengers and 20 crew, third class or deck passengers to bathe simultaneously. Separate accommodation in tents or troop huts had been established for Asiatics, with separate kitchen, dining-room, shelter shed, lavatory and bath blocks. Lighting was supplied from kerosene lamps. A water carriage sewerage system discharged directly into the river, with a chlorination chamber available for disinfection of sewerage as necessary. The medical officer's and foreman assistant's quarters were connected to the city telephone service and internal telephones served most of the principal buildings. A cemetery was located within the grounds. The Lytton facility functioned as a human quarantine station until the early 1980s, by which time the decision {{had been made to}} phase out human quarantine services. Arrangements were made for Kenmore Repatriation Hospital to provide observation facilities in the event that they were required, and in 1982 the Lytton facility reverted to its earlier role as an animal quarantine station, re-designated the Lytton Quarantine Complex and Animal Detention Centre. Facilities comprised a launch jetty, workshop, inflammable store, guinea pig area, imports treatment laboratory, utility buildings area, offices, stores, and animal quarantine detention facilities. In addition to its role as an animal quarantine centre, Lytton served as a communications centre, a base for south side shipping clearance and inspection, a facility for dealing with quarantine treatment and detention of materials, a training area and a depot for stores. Many of the buildings associated with the human quarantine station at Lytton were removed after the 1982 closure, some relocated to sites in the Lytton and Wynnum districts.|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: An {{outbreak}} of gram-negative bacteremia in patients undergoing {{endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography}} (ERCP) was investigated to determine the sources of infection and to control transmission. PATIENTS, METHODS, AND RESULTS: The incidence of post-ERCP bacteremia increased from 1. 6 % (60 of 3, 696) procedures to 3. 6 % (53 of 1, 454) procedures (relative risk 2. 3, p < 0. 0001) after endoscopes were processed in a new automated <b>disinfector.</b> Bacteremia involved nine species of Pseudomonas and Enterobacteriaceae, which were also isolated from processed endoscopes. Seven epidemic strains with highly related genomic macrorestriction profiles each infected 2 or more patients, accounting for 29 (55 %) episodes of post-ERCP bacteremia. Strains recovered from endoscopes and from the <b>disinfector</b> were associated with 22 (42 %) and 5 (9 %) bacteremic episodes respectively. Effective endoscope disinfection was achieved by cleansing and disinfection of a blind channel not processed in the <b>disinfector,</b> additional isopropanol- air flush of all channels, and auto-disinfection of the <b>disinfector.</b> In the following period, the incidence of post-ERCP bacteremia returned to the pre- epidemic rate (1. 7 %, p = 0. 0001). CONCLUSION: Bacterial genome fingerprinting by macrorestriction analysis enabled delineation of a multi-strain {{outbreak of}} post-ERCP bacteremia. Cross-contamination, {{and to a lesser}} extent, common- source contamination, appeared related to inadequate disinfection of endoscopes processed in an automated <b>disinfector.</b> SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E

Suspension tests demonstrated that ‘in use’ concentrations were not always effective to provide the required disinfection efficacy within recommended exposure times and in some instances a 60 min exposure was necessary to achieve a reduction in number by a factor of 105. It appears that vegetative Gram-positive isolates can become resistant to oxidising agents in vitro, and that cross-resistance to related compounds can occur.

The {{purpose of the present}} study was to quantify the surface debris on files removed from the manufacturer’s packaging, and after cleaning using an ultrasonic bath or a thermal <b>disinfector.</b> Methods: Stainless steel and rotary nickel-titanium files were examined after removal from the manufacturer’s packaging, after instrumentation in broth-contaminated human teeth, and after various cleaning procedures. The cleaning procedures consisted of either a thermal <b>disinfector</b> cycle, ultrasonication with the files placed in a perforated container or ultrasonication with the files loosely placed in a beaker. The presence of manufacturing debris and biological debris was evaluated using scanning electron microscopy and quantified using image analysis software. Results: The effectiveness of cleaning was not affected by variation in the size or taper of the files when an effective cleaning procedure was used. Cleaning the files in a thermal <b>disinfector</b> or by ultrasonication within a container did not consistently achieve complete removal of biological debris. Placing the files loosely in the ultrasonic bath achieved the most effective cleaning, an average of 98. 33 per cent of the file surface area was freed of any biological debris.

Methodology Two sets of two hundred rotary Ni-Ti files, one previously used ex vivo and another one used clinically, were collected from the undergraduate and postgraduate clinics of the Academic Centre for Dentistry Amsterdam (ACTA). The instruments were immersed in an enzymatic solution and subsequently cleaned either by a washer <b>disinfector,</b> a regular ultrasonic bath combined with a glass beaker, the same bath combined with a beaker lined with two cavitation intensifying sheets or with two standard plastic sheets. The positive control consisted of used files that did not undergo any cleaning and the negative control included new unused files.

40|$|Background {{and study}} aims: Several endoscopy-related {{outbreaks}} of infection {{have been reported}} in recent years. For early recognition of inadequate disinfection of endoscopes we designed a microbiological surveillance system to evaluate the efficacy of the cleaning and disinfection procedure, and to trace disinfection problems to individual endoscopes or washer-disinfectors. Methods: Our surveillance protocol included anterograde and retrograde sampling, a decision algorithm, genetic fingerprinting, and scanning electron microscopy. Results: Over a period of 29 months we found an increasing number of patient-ready endoscopes testing positive for Candida species other than albicans, especially C. parapsilosis. These yeasts were also isolated from the washer-disinfectors. The number of positive tests for Candida species varied from 1 out of 21 to 14 out of 27 samples from nine frequently used endoscopes. The number of colony-forming units per milliliter ranged from 1 - 10 to 3000 for endoscopes and 0. 002 to 0. 06 for the washer <b>disinfectors.</b> DNA fingerprinting was not able to discriminate different strains within C. parapsilosis. Conclusions: Our protocol was able to detect a structural problem in the endoscope disinfection process. Retrograde sampling was crucial for this purpose, because it has much higher sensitivity than anterograde sampling.

40|$|A {{method is}} {{presented}} {{with which the}} mechanical cleaning effect of flushing <b>disinfectors</b> can be estimated independently of the thermal disinfecting effect of the hot flushing water. This {{makes it possible to}} specify the demands to be placed on the disinfecting effect of flushing with water of 85 degrees C or more. Bacillus stearothermophilus spores suspended in faeces were used as indicators because of their non-sensitivity to the hot-water temperature. Their elimination by flushing could thus be attributed to the mechanical effect of the water and not to the disinfecting effect of the temperature. A simple bacteriological technique was used, and the elimination factor (EF) was calculated as the ratio of the number of micro-organisms in the contamination before and after flushing. By using flushing water below 50 degrees C for 130 s the EF on a bedpan was about 10 (4) - 10 (6). The effect of flushing with water of the same temperature for only half that time was somewhat weaker and when the temperature was raised to 85 degrees C after half the flushing time the effect was somewhat stronger. It can be presumed that the conventional disinfecting phase with hot (85 degrees C) water for about 45 s in the commonly used flushing units could be substantially shortened and the costs of their use thereby reduced...|$|R

To investigate the ability of P. aeruginosa biofilm to survive high level PAA disinfection. The susceptibility of planktonic cells of P. aeruginosa and biofilms 24, 48, 96 and 192 h old to PAA was evaluated by estimating their viability using resazurin viability and plate count methods. The biomass of the P. aeruginosa biofilms was also quantified using crystal violet assay. Planktonic cells of P. aeruginosa were treated with 5 - 30 ppm concentration of PAA in the presence of 3. 0 g/L of Bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 5 min. Biofilms of P. aeruginosa were also treated with various PAA concentrations (100 - 3000 ppm) for 5 min. Planktonic cells of P. aeruginosa were eradicated by 20 ppm of PAA, whereas biofilms showed an age dependent tolerance to PAA, and 96 h old biofilm was only eradicated at PAA concentration of 2500 ppm. 96 h old P. aeruginosa biofilm survives 5 min treatment with 2000 ppm of PAA, which is the working concentration used in some endoscope washer <b>disinfectors.</b> This implies that disinfection failure of flexible endoscopes could occur when biofilms are allowed to build up in the lumens of endoscopes...|$|R

The antimicrobial efficacy of the two units was investigated by challenge with three bacteria (S. epidermidis, P. aeruginosa, and S. marcescens) and two fungi (C. albicans and A. fumigatus). Although the viable counts of some organisms were significantly reduced, the overall data does not support the use of either device as being clinically efficacious for disinfection...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the way intensive use and multiple cleanings of torque wrenches may interfere with accurary over time. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three different brands (one spring-style and two friction-style types) were tested at baseline and after enduring mechanical testing (1, 000 cycles) and cleaning in a thermal <b>disinfector</b> (150 cycles). Torque wrenches were tested at a predetermined value of 30 Ncm at given intervals, and true values were registered by means of a digital torque gauge. RESULTS: All measured values varied between 28. 3 Ncm and 31. 1 Ncm. Only the spring-style torque wrench revealed values that differed significantly from baseline after both mechanical testing (P <. 001) and cleaning (P <. 05). CONCLUSION: The spring-style torque wrench produced values that changed significantly after multiple mechanical and multiple cleaning cycles. However, the differences were small and the measured values from all tested specimens were close to the predetermined value of 30 Ncm...|$|E
