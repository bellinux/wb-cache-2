5|$|As one of {{the nearest}} Sun-like stars, Epsilon Eridani has {{been the target of}} many {{attempts}} to search for planetary companions. Its chromospheric activity and variability mean that finding planets with the radial velocity method <b>is</b> <b>difficult,</b> because the stellar activity may create signals that mimic the presence of planets.
