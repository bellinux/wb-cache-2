The addition of vibratory mechanism to the fluidized bed in 1984 where Geldart showed that using mechanical vibrating sieve can improve the performance of <b>fluidising</b> small size of fine particles. These experiments are difficult to process these powders by fluidisation due to the unpredictable behaviours of particles.

Mujumdar (1988) devised two methods using vibration technic of fluidization for fluidizing hot-sensitive and paste-like materials. Yoshihide et al.

Cisplatin does not <b>fluidise</b> the membrane sufficiently to cause its breakdown but creates small ion conducting defects on the membrane bilayer resulting in a marginal increase in ion conductivity.
