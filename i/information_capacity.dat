25|$|In chemistry, a hypercycle is an {{abstract}} model of organization of self-replicating molecules connected in a cyclic, autocatalytic manner. It {{was introduced in}} an ordinary differential equation (ODE) form by the Nobel Prize winner Manfred Eigen in 1971 and subsequently further extended in collaboration with Peter Schuster. It was proposed {{as a solution to}} the error threshold problem encountered during modelling of replicative molecules that hypothetically existed on the primordial Earth (see: abiogenesis). As such, it explained how life on Earth could have begun using only relatively short genetic sequences, which in theory were too short to store all essential information. The hypercycle is a special case of the replicator equation. The most important properties of hypercycles are autocatalytic growth competition between cycles, once-for-ever selective behaviour, utilization of small selective advantage, rapid evolvability, increased <b>information</b> <b>capacity,</b> and selection against parasitic branches.|$|E

The Piagetian measures of logical reasoning were positively correlated with <b>information</b> processing <b>capacity,</b> but the measures of <b>information</b> processing <b>capacity</b> failed to account for much of the variability of performance on the logical reasoning tasks.

25|$|It was {{suggested}} that the problem with building and maintaining larger, more complex, and more accurately replicated molecules can be circumvented if several information carriers, each of them storing {{a small piece of}} information, are connected such that they only control their own concentration. Studies of the mathematical model describing replicating molecules revealed that to observe a cooperative behaviour among self-replicating molecules, they have to be connected by a positive feedback loop of catalytic actions. This kind of closed network consisting of self-replicating entities connected by a catalytic positive-feedback loop was named an elementary hypercycle. Such a concept, apart from an increased <b>information</b> <b>capacity,</b> has another advantage. Linking self-replication with mutual catalysis can produce nonlinear growth of the system. This, first, makes the system resistant to so-called parasitic branches. Parasitic branches are species coupled to a cycle that do not provide any advantage to the reproduction of a cycle, which, in turn, makes them useless and decreases the selective value of the system. Secondly, it reinforces the self-organization of molecules into the hypercycle, allowing the system to evolve without losing information, which solves the error threshold problem.|$|E

5000|$|Due to this {{connection}} with algorithmic information theory, entropy {{can be said}} to be that portion of a system's <b>information</b> <b>capacity</b> which is [...] "used up," [...] that is, unavailable for storing new information (even if the existing information content were to be compressed). The rest of a system's <b>information</b> <b>capacity</b> (aside from its entropy) might be called extropy, and it represents the part of the system's <b>information</b> <b>capacity</b> which is potentially still available for storing newly derived information. The fact that physical entropy is basically [...] "used-up storage capacity" [...] is a direct concern in the engineering of computing systems; e.g., a computer must first remove the entropy from a given physical subsystem (eventually expelling it to the environment, and emitting heat) in order for that subsystem to be used to store some newly computed information.|$|E

30|$|The {{existing}} research literature about <b>information</b> hiding <b>capacity</b> has established theoretical models for information hiding and drawn different capacity expressions for different models. Moulin and O'Sullivan [2] proposed an information hiding model by abstracting {{the process of}} information hiding and using the communication model to represent information hiding. The <b>information</b> hiding <b>capacity</b> is considered as the maximum of reliable transfer rate under the communication model. However, this abstract model is not suitable for the still image information hiding model and {{cannot be applied to}} estimate the spatial domain image steganographic capacity. Supposing that the carrier information is state traverse, Cohen and Lapidoth [3] provided the estimating range for <b>information</b> hiding <b>capacity.</b> But in reality, not all the image carriers are state traversed. Though the research of Somekh-Baruch and Merhav [4] is an advance for the Moulin model, it is still limited to the communication model. Reference [5] proposed a secure steganographic method based on the payload and analyzed the correlation between image complexity and payload, but this research is confined to the DCT domain and the payload of spatial domain format is not involved. References [6, 7] made an analysis of <b>information</b> hiding <b>capacity</b> by introducing the case theory, but this research can only be made when the carriers follow the Gaussian distribution.|$|R
