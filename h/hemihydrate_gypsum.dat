40|$|International audienceHydration {{reactions}} of C 3 A with various amounts of calcium sulfate <b>hemihydrate,</b> <b>gypsum</b> or {{a mixture of}} two, were investigated by isothermal microcalorimetry, and a monitoring of the ionic concentrations of diluted suspensions. This study shows that sulfate type used modifies the early C 3 A-CaSO 4 hydration products {{and the rate of}} this hydration. The fast initial AFm formation observed before ettringite precipitation in the C 3 A-gypsum system is avoided as soon as hemihydrate is present in the suspension. This was attributed to. higher super saturation degrees and then higher nucleation frequency with regard to the ettringite obtained in the presence of hemihydrate. Moreover, replacement of gypsum by hemihydrate also leads to an increase of the ettringite formation rate during at least the five first hours under experimental conditions...|$|E

For eliminating the deficiencies in the gypsum materials and articles is proposed the application of pumice as the filler and the active mineral additive. The influence of the additives of portland cement on the properties of <b>hemihydrate</b> <b>gypsum</b> is at shown on table. Further are given the results of studies of the properties of composite in the dependence on the relationship of the components of gypsum, ashes and portland cement, and also grain composition of pumice. It is revealed, that the application of pumice together with the portland cement in the gypsumconcrete composites makes it possible to reduce the expenditure of gypsum to 50 % without considerable reduction in the strength characteristics. In this case the developed gypsum concrete composites have the increased water resistance. It is established that the influence of the granulometric composition of ashes on the strength properties of composite is ambiguous, in the compositions with the high content of ashes the use of larger fractions is expedient, and with the content it is less than 50 % ashes in the composite - small fractions.

40|$|The product {{formed from}} intergrinding {{blastfurnace}} slag and <b>hemihydrate</b> <b>gypsum</b> {{is known as}} supersulphated cement (SSC) and this was widely used in foundation engineering until the advent of sulphate-resisting cements in the mid 20 th century. The use of SSC has declined in recent decades for economic reasons, yet it remains an eminently viable engineering material. A potential new use for sulphate activated pozzolans is to make Controlled Low Strength Materials which are low strength mortars and are used for waste containment, trench-fill and other general backfill applications. These materials are rapidly gaining market share from conventional products such as foamed concretes. Concretes for sub-bases for car parks and other hard standing are other potential uses. Gypsum is already permitted in EU standard prENI 14227 - 3 for road foundations containing ash. The work in this project is based on using gypsum which contains too many impurities {{to be used in}} plasterboard or cement production and mixing it with other waste materials such as basic oxygen slag from steel production and cement kiln dust. The main source of red gypsum for the project is titanium oxide pigment production which yields 250 kt of “red” gypsum per year in the UK. Worldwide production of red gypsum is 1. 25 Mt from one producer alone. Waste gypsum also arises from plasterboard off-cuts from construction sites and spent casting cores from foundries and very many areas of chemical manufacturing produce secondary gypsum from acid neutralisation. This presentation will describe the background to the research project which is being carried out by Coventry University, Imperial College London and Birmingham University. The results from testing these materials in the laboratory and a site trial will also be presented...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of calcium sulfate state and fineness of cement on hydration of Portland cement was studied wing electrical resistivity measurement. The bulk resistivity {{curve of the}} paste from the abnormal cement mainly with hemihydrate had a characteristic abnormal peak and rapid increase in early period. The resistivity measurement technique {{can be used to}} discriminate abnormal setting. For normal cement with gypsum, the increase in fineness of the Portland cement decreases the minimum resistivity due to a higher ionic concentration and increases the 24 hour resistivity due to a reduction in matroscopic pore size. The setting time, compressive strength, pore structure of pastes made from different cements were carried out to compare the {{influence of}} water to cement ratio, calcium sulfate state and fineness. It is found that the electrical and mechanical properties are strongly affected by the initial porosity, the presence of <b>hemihydrate</b> or <b>gypsum,</b> and the fineness of cement...|$|R

40|$|The CEMHYD 3 D {{model has}} been {{extended}} at the University of Twente in last ten years 1, 2. At present the cement hydration model is extended {{for the use of}} gypsum. Although gypsum was present in the model already, the model was not suitable for high contents of gypsum and did not include the transitions between the different calcium sulphate phases (anhydrite, <b>hemihydrate</b> and <b>gypsum).</b> Besides that gypsum was seen as intermediate phase instead of a final phase. The presented model addresses these problems and has the possibility to simulate the microstructure development of gypsum, including reaction kinetics (dissolution, diffusion and precipitation) and the formation of gypsum needles. The model enables multi-time modelling which means the possibility to zoom in and out on the hydration process with respect to time. Multi-time modelling enables the user to study the hydration in more detail in both the early phase (hours) and on the long term (years). This modelling is needed, since the hydration of calcium sulphates is very short compared to that of cement...|$|R
40|$|In the {{polluted}} atmosphere, {{sulphur dioxide}} (SO 2) reacts with calcite (CaCO 3) in marble producing calcium sulphite hemihydrate (CaSO 3 · 0. 5 H 2 O) and gypsum (CaSO 4 · 2 H 2 O). Gypsum develops crust at rain-sheltered surfaces and then, being more soluble, accelerates erosion at areas exposed to rain. Eventually, all these lead to significant deformations in the appearance {{and structure of}} marble surfaces. Clearly, some precautions {{must be taken to}} stop or at least to slow down this deterioration process which destroys our cultural heritage. In this study, we have investigated the possibilities of preventing the SO 2 -marble reaction by using water-soluble surfactants: Abil Quat 3270 and Tween 20. Experiments for measuring their effects have been carried out at conditions simulating the dry deposition of SO 2. Infrared spectrometry and scanning electron microscopy were used to analyze the mineralogical composition and morphology of the reaction products. The extent of sulphation reaction was calculated by determining calcium sulphite <b>hemihydrate</b> and <b>gypsum</b> quantitatively by an IR approach and also by weight increases observed during the progress of SO 2 -marble reaction. A 10 % decrease is observed in the total sulphation with both surfactant applications.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{describes}} a new in situ thermal X-ray diffraction (XRD) method for the setting and hardening of calcium sulfate hemihydrate (bassanite), high alumina cements and Portland cements, which {{are mainly composed of}} polycrystalline anhydrous and hydrous phases. The dissolution and neo-crystallization of phases during the setting processes are commonly followed by XRD. Additional physical factors, such as temperature and/or light irradiation, which modify the kinetic {{parameters of the}} setting reactions, have been incorporated in a new method of XRD. Simultaneous optical stimulation and X-ray diffraction (SOSXRD) is a modification of the XRD powder method. It also requires a thermocouple, a temperature controller and a thyristor power regulator (PID) for the halogen lamp with which the sample can be heated to 210 °C. The automatic temperature control loop, by the proportional-integral-derivative PID control method, and the modifications of the XRD chamber are described. The resultant 3 D plot s display the phase transitions in detail. The progressive decay of the phases can no longer be detected in the 3 D plot, but only in the change of the areas under the curves. Classic examples of phase changes which can be recorded by this method are the phase changes from <b>gypsum</b> to <b>hemihydrate</b> and from <b>hemihydrate</b> to <b>gypsum</b> during setting, as well as the dissolution of alite during the hardening of Portland cement and the decay of the monocalcium aluminate and brownmillerite during the hardening of a high alumina cement.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the investigation of}} the three minerals, calcium sulfate, calcium phosphate and calcium carbonate under two bio-inspired methods, additives and confinement. The first experiment in Chapter 3 investigated the precipitation pathway of calcium sulfate above and under the solubility levels. Two metastable phases were obtained at ambient condition, hemihydrate and amorphous calcium sulfate (ACS), that first revealed hemihydrate can be found in room temperature and the existence of ACS. The transformation of ACS to the most stable phase, <b>gypsum</b> via <b>hemihydrate</b> was also proved under the titration and Cryo-TEM at undersaturated solution. Chapter 4 deals with the investigation of calcium sulfate grown in the presence of additives. These additives which have the profound inhibition effect provide another evidence of the existence of hemihydrate and ACS in the ambient conditions. Neglected before in literature, the morphology change of <b>gypsum</b> and <b>hemihydrate</b> also provide an aggregation-based transformation from <b>hemihydrate</b> to <b>gypsum.</b> Similar results were obtained growing calcium carbonate in confinement allowing formation of amorphous calcium carbonate. The results in Chapter 5 also demonstrated that confinement plays {{a significant role in the}} formation not only of the amorphous phase, but also the metastable phase, hemihydrate. Results were obtained in the absence and presence of the additives that lead to stabilize hemihydrate and ACS for more than 24 hours. Precipitation of calcium phosphate in confinement in the absence and presence of the additives used the same method as mentioned in the previous chapter. Similar results were obtained and again demonstrated that confinement and additives play a more significant role in bone formation. The last chapter investigated the crystallization pathway of calcium carbonate under UV-Vis at 2 - 10 mM concentration solutions with/without additives. The in-situ experiment in Chapter 7 provides a simple method to investigate the influence of concentrations of calcium carbonate solution and additives. Amorphous calcium carbonate nanoparticles were formed at early stage which transformed to stable calcite with tim...|$|R

The main pollutant Sulphur dioxide (SO 2) reacts with marble composed primarily of calcite (CaCO 3), the firs step of decay which called gypsum (CaSO 4. 2 H 2 O) crust is formed and this process can be accelerated when the surfaces exposed to the rain. In this study, the possibilities of slowing down the SO 2 -marble reactions were investigated by coating the surface of marble with some bio-degradable polymers: zein, chitosan, polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) and polylactic acid (PLA) as protective agents. Uncoated control marbles and biodegradable polymer coated marbles were exposed at nearly 8 ppm SO 2 concentration at 100 % relative humidity conditions in a reaction chamber for several days. The extent of reaction was determined by leaching sulphate from the marble surface into deionized water and measuring the total concentration of sulphate with ion chromatography (IC). Then, gypsum crust thickness, polymers % protection factor and average deposition velocity were calculated. Concurrently, the ratio and amount of calcium sulfite hemihydrate (CaSO 3. H 2 O) and gypsum (CaSO 4. 2 H 2 O) were determined by FT-IR analysis. The surface morphology of SO 2 exposed marble to distinguished calcium sulfite <b>hemihydrate</b> and <b>gypsum</b> crystals were determined by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). The results of the study showed that SO 2 -calcite reaction increased in the use of zein, glycerol added zein and chitosan polymers on the surface of marble. While, PHB treated marble surfaces had 5 % increases in the protection factor. The low molecular weight PLA protection factor was 45 % after 85 days exposure. Similar results were observed when the high molecular weight of PLA used. The protection was extended to more than 90 days having 60 % protection factor...|$|R
40|$|Usually {{to obtain}} {{expansive}} cements sulfoaluminate clinker or mix aluminate clinker with calcium sulfates (<b>gypsum,</b> <b>hemihydrate,</b> anhydrate) are used. For these cements ettringite {{is an important}} hydration product and kinetic reaction of this phase {{plays an important role}} in determinаting performance. The alternative aluminate phases may be ferrite containing ones. This article deals with the composition and properties of solid solution of calcium sulfoaluminate, sulfoferrite and sulfoaluminoferrite cements. It was studied an influence of calcium sulfate on structure and properties of calcium aluminate and ferrite phases, and their stability under high temperatures. Beside that the properties of cements containing these phases were studied. The investigation of hydration and properties of sulfomineral cements shows that ettringite and its analogies are formed in such way to provide expansion and compression of cement stone. Degree of expansion and self-stressing of cement stone depends not only on composition of sulfated minerals but on ratio and types of clinkers. The higher expansion is reached by the use of high alite containing Portland cement clinker together with sulfoaluminate or sulfoalumoferrite one, the lower expansion is reached by addition of sulfoalumoferrite and sulfoferrite clinkers. These cements are classified as self-stressing, expansive or shrinkage-compensating ones depend on the degree of their expansion after 28 days of curing...|$|R
