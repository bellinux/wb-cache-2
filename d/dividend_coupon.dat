5000|$|When a {{security}} is loaned, {{the title of}} the security transfers to the borrower. This means that the borrower has the advantages of holding the security, as they become the full legal and beneficial owner of it. Specifically, the borrower will receive all <b>coupon</b> and/or <b>dividend</b> payments, and any other rights such as voting rights. In most cases, these <b>dividends</b> or <b>coupons</b> must be passed back to the lender in the form of what is referred to as a [...] "manufactured dividend".|$|R
50|$|Originally, {{shareholders}} {{could be}} literally anonymous and collect <b>dividends</b> by surrendering <b>coupons</b> {{attached to their}} share certificates. Dividends were therefore paid to whoever held the certificate. Share certificates could be transferred privately, and therefore {{the management of the}} company would not necessarily know who owned its shares.|$|R
5000|$|The {{most popular}} hybrid among {{financial}} institutions (banks and insurance companies) is the Basket D security. Basket D is {{a reference to}} a point on Moody's debt-equity continuum scale that treats the hybrid as 75% equity and 25% debt. In order to qualify, the security must give the issuer the right (or even the obligation) to roll-over the security at expiry to an indefinite or long maturity bond and to suspend <b>dividends</b> (effectively <b>coupon</b> payments, but to reflect the equity nature of the security, the term [...] "dividend" [...] is used). Most Basket D issuances have been structured in a way that also preserves the tax deductible nature of their interest payments, avoiding double taxation/customs.|$|R
50|$|The {{clientele}} {{effect is}} the idea that the set of investors attracted to a particular kind of security will affect the price of the security when policies or circumstances change.For instance, some investors want a company that doesn't pay dividends but instead invests that money in growing the business, whereas other investors prefer a stock that pays a high dividend, and still others want one that balances payout and reinvestment. If a company changes its dividend policy substantially, it is said to be subject to a clientele effect as some of its investors (its established clientele) decide to sell the security due to the change. Although commonly used in reference to <b>dividend</b> or <b>coupon</b> (interest) rates, it can also be used in the context of leverage (debt levels), changes in line of business, taxes, and other aspects of the company.|$|R
40|$|The {{object of}} our study is where each Sn is a m-dimensional {{stochastic}} (real valued) vector, i. e. denned on a probability space (Ω,, P) and adapted to a filtration (n) 0 ≤n≤N with 0 being the σ-algebra consisting of all null sets and their complements. In this paper we interpret as the value of some financial asset k at time n. Remark: If the asset generates <b>dividends</b> or <b>coupon</b> payments, think of as to include these payments (cum dividend process). Think of dividends as being reinvested immediately at the ex-dividend price. Definition 1 (a) A sequence of random vectors where is called a trading strategy. Since our time horizon ends at time N we must always have ϑN ≡ 0. The interpretation is obvious: stands {{for the number of}} shares of asset k you hold in the time interval [n,n + 1). You must choose ϑn at time n. (b) The sequence of random variables where Sn stands for the payment stream generated by ϑ (set ϑ− 1 ≡ 0...|$|R
40|$|The U. S. {{government}} routinely misstates {{interest costs}} on government debt. These misstatements occur {{partly because the}} government fails to account properly for the real capital losses government creditors experience during inflationary periods. 1 In addition, the government imperfectly measures the fluctuations in returns to its creditors from changes in interest rates and the maturity composition of the debt. When investors compute the real return on an equity or debt investment, they take into account <b>dividend</b> and <b>coupon</b> payments, the change in price of the stock or bond, {{and the effect of}} inflation on the general price level. So should the government in accounting for its interest costs to the public. In this paper we update and extend calculations in Hall and Sargent (1997) that estimate the government’s true real interest costs. 2 By manipulating the government’s period-by-period budget constraint, we identify the interest cost component from the stock of outstanding government obligations for the post-World War II period. We then decompose these costs to uncover the anticipated and unanticipated interest expenses. These updates are of interest {{in part because of the}} introduction of inflation-protected Treasury securities (TIPS) in late 1990 s. While all types of debt allow the government to smooth taxes through time, debt denominated in nominal dollars We thank Francisco Barillas, Christian Grewell, and Leandro Nascimento for careful and diligent researc...|$|R
40|$|Convertible {{bonds are}} hybrid {{securities}} whose pricing {{relies on a}} set of complex inter-dependencies due to the sensitivity to interest rate risk, underlying (equity) risk, FX risk, and credit risk, and due to the convertible bond’s early exercise American feature. We present a two factor model of interest rate and equity risk that is implemented using the Crank-Nicholson technique on the discretized pricing equation with projective successive over-relaxation. This paper extends a methodology proposed in the literature (TF[98]) to deal with credit risk in a self- consistent way, and proposes a new methodology to deal with FX sensitive cross-currency convertibles. A technique for extracting the price of vanilla options struck on a synthetic asset, the foreign equity in domestic currency, is employed to obtain the implied volatility for these options. These implied volatilities are then used to obtain the local volatility for use in the numerical routine. The model is designed to deal with most of the usual contractual features such as <b>coupons,</b> <b>dividends,</b> continuous and/or Bermudan call and put clauses. We suggest that credit spread adjustments in the boundary conditions can be made, to account for the negative correlation between spreads and equity. Detailed description of the numerical methods and the discretization schemes, together with their accuracy, are provided. cross-currency convertibles, credit spread, interest rate risk, American feature, local volatility, Crank-Nicholson. ...|$|R
40|$|Mean-variance {{portfolio}} {{theory can}} apply to streams of payoffs such as dividends fol-lowing an initial investment. This description is useful when returns are not indepen-dent over time and investors have nonmarketed income. Investors hedge their outside income streams. Then, their optimal payoff is split between an indexed perpetuity— the risk-free payoff—and a long-run mean-variance efficient payoff. “Long-run ” mo-ments sum over {{time as well as}} states of nature. In equilibrium, long-run expected returns vary with long-run market betas and outside-income betas. State-variable hedges do not appear. THIS PAPER EXAMINES LONG-HORIZON portfolio problems and corresponding equi-libria. I allow asset return dynamics, dynamic trading, nonmarket wealth, such as wages, businesses, or real estate, and preference shocks. Markets are in-complete, so investors {{may not be able to}} completely hedge outside-income or state-variable shocks. I focus on the optimal stream of final payoffs, rather than on the composi-tion and dynamics of portfolio returns. I find that the stream of final payoffs obeys a classic mean-variance characterization and Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) equilibrium pricing. Let x = {xt} denote a stream of payoffs, costing p(x) at time 0. (The Appendix summarizes all notation.) These payoffs can be <b>coupons,</b> <b>dividends,</b> or pay-outs from dynamic trading strategies. I define a “long-run expectation ” E ̃ that sums over time, weighted by a number β < 1, as well as over states of nature, weighted by probabilities, Ẽ(x) ≡ 1 − β β E t=...|$|R
