50|$|Luther Henry Caldwell House is a {{historic}} home located at Lumberton, Robeson County, North Carolina. It was built between 1893 and 1903, and is a large two-story, eclectic Queen Anne style frame dwelling. It features a double tier wraparound porch with an octagonal pavilion and decorative woodwork on the porches, bayed gable <b>end</b> <b>projections,</b> and gable fronts. It was the home of Luther Henry Caldwell, an important business and social leader in Lumberton.|$|E
50|$|Laid {{out as an}} {{architectural}} counterpart of the Old Palace, the new royal residence historically supported the earlier concept of a palace complex, highlighting the need for rounding off spatially and symbolically a whole that connoted {{the very idea of}} the state. The three store building was designed in the style of academism with elements borrowed mostly from Renaissance and Baroque architecture. The most imposing facade faced the garden, and the corner took the form of a domed tower similar to the solution used for the Old Palace. The horizontal facade division showed a rusticated semi-basement, the ground floor and the first floor integrated into one central composition, and an independently and more unassumingly treated second floor.The articulation of the main facade was achieved by a central and two <b>end</b> <b>projections,</b> and a curved, centrally positioned entrance porch. In accordance with the purpose of the building, special attention in ornamenting the façades was paid to heraldic symbols. The semicircular pediment above the cornice of the central projecting bay contained the full armorial achievement of the royal house of Karadjordjević. The tallest and, consequently, dominant element of the New Palace - the tower capped with a dome tapering into a spire topped by a bronze eagle rising - provided the architectural link between the facades facing Kralja Milana and Andrićev venac streets. Another important heraldic composition was placed just beneath the dome of the corner tower: two identical, symmetrically placed shields with a cross between four fire-steels, i.e. an element of the coat-of-arms of the Kingdom of Serbia, which subsequently was incorporated into the coat-of-arms of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. The central motif of the façade facing Andrićev venac was the curved projecting bay whose attic was surmounted by a monumental ornamental composition featuring the coat-of-arms in the centre.|$|E
50|$|The irregularly shaped two-story Federal mansion {{is built}} of stuccoed brick. The facade is {{composed}} of a three-bay center section flanked by two octagonal <b>ended</b> <b>projections.</b> Construction was started in 1806, and completed in 1815. It was renovated about two decades later, with wallpaper and stucco added, and perhaps a porch which was removed during the 1977 restoration.|$|R

40|$|Relative {{impacts of}} FAD and free-school purse seine fishing on yellowfin tuna stock status Conservation and Management Measure 2013 - 01 {{requires}} that the Scientific Committee in 2014 provide advice to the Commission on the relative impact on yellowfin tuna stock status of different ratios of purse seine set types, i. e. FAD, or associated sets versus free-school or unassociated sets. To address this issue, we undertook deterministic stock projections using the 2014 yellowfin tuna assessment assuming 2010 - 2012 average purse seine effort and catch by non-purse seine gears. Separate projections were run using different percentages (0 %, 20 %, 40 %, 60 %, 80 % and 100 %) of the total purse seine effort being attributed to associated sets and the complementary percentage to unassociated sets. The equilibrium purse seine catch of yellowfin decreases with increasing percentages of associated sets in the purse seine fishery. The three stock status indicators examined – spawning biomass at the <b>end</b> of the <b>projection</b> period {{in relation to the}} average unexploited spawning biomass in 2002 - 2011; the spawning biomass at the <b>end</b> of the <b>projection</b> period in relation to the spawning biomass at MSY; and the fishing mortality at the <b>end</b> of the <b>projection</b> period in relation to the fishing mortality at MSY – were all relatively insensitive to changes in the set type composition of purse seine effort.
