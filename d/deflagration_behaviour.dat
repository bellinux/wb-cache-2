40|$|Combustion {{behaviour}} of ammonium perchlorate-potassium perchlorate pellets is studied using Crawford strand burners. At low {{concentrations of}} potassium perchlorate (up to 30 percent potassium perchlorate) the burning rate of ammonium perchlorate-potassium perchlorate condensed mixtures increases with potassium perchlorate content. Above 40 percent potassium perchlorate content, combustion sustenance becomes difficult. Decomposition products of ammonium perchlorate sensitize the melting and subsequent decomposition of potassium perchlorate. The results are {{explained in terms}} of the melt layer thickness, flame temperature and the resultant surface temperature, and heat wave penetration into the solid. The study suggests the importance of melt layer on the burning surface in the <b>deflagration</b> <b>behaviour</b> of ammonium perchlorate-potassium perchlorate condensed mixture...|$|E
40|$|To gain {{a deeper}} {{understanding}} for the influences of coal dust on methane flame deflagrations in chemical plants, a LSDT has been established at the University of Newcastle, Australia. The initial ignition source was delivered by the ignition of 50 mJ chemical ignitors. This study focuses on the influences of dilute coal dust concentrations (below 30 g m − 3) on the deflagration of methane in a hybrid form. The work addressed the characteristic of hybrid flame <b>deflagration</b> <b>behaviour</b> including the flame velocity, pressure profile, dynamic and static pressure. Two concentrations of coal dust {{were introduced to the}} methane deflagrations, which were 10 g m − 3 and 30 g m − 3. The results revealed that the presence of a diluted coal dust of 10 g m − 3 significantly enhanced the flame travelling distance of a 5 % methane concentration, from 12. 5 m to 20. 5 m. Introducing a 30 g m − 3 coal dust concentration also enhanced the flame travelling distance of a 5 % methane concentration, from 12. 5 m to the EDT (End of Detonation Tube, 28. 5 m). This enhancement was associated with boosting the flame velocity and the over pressure rise. For a higher methane concentration (i. e., a 7. 5 % methane concentration), the flame of the methane reached the EDT. Introducing 10 g m − 3 coal dust to a 7. 5 % methane explosion increased the flame intensity signal, from 1 V to the maximum reading value (10. 2 V), and enhanced the flame velocity at the EDT by about 14 m s − 1 and finally, increased the stagnation pressure {{at the end of the}} detonation tube from 1. 25 bar to 4. 6 bar...|$|E
40|$|Methane {{explosion}} hazards in pipes are of pivotal {{concern in}} chemical plants. Accurate knowledge of flame <b>deflagration</b> and its <b>behaviours</b> {{are required to}} reduce the consequences of accidental fires and explosions. Considering a lack of experimental work exists in large scale methane-air deflagration systems, a detonation tube (30 m long) was facilitated at the University of Newcastle to cover the knowledge gap {{in terms of boosting}} flame deflagration of low methane concentrations and also examining flame deflagration characteristics with different reactive lengths (3, 6, 12 and 25 m). The feature of injecting methane at varied reactive sections (RS) was achieved using a balloon isolation system, a 50 mJ chemical ignitor used to ignite the initial explosion section. The results revealed that stagnation pressure gradually increased, from 2. 03 bar to 3. 77 bar then 4. 57 bar, with increasing RS length from 3 m to 6 m then 12 m, respectively. There was no significant influence of 1. 25 % or 2. 5 % methane concentrations on dynamic or stagnation pressures, however, they extended the travelling flame distance by about 3 m for RS lengths of 12 m and 25 m. At 9. 5 % methane concentration and for a RS of 12 m a state of fast deflagration was observed, associated with 5 bar pressure rise. The pressure wave up to 6. 5 m was only a few milliseconds (about 15 ms) ahead of the flame for almost the full methane concentration range, however, after this point the gap between the pressure wave and the flame significantly varied in accordance to the methane concentration, where the data analysis at 15 m indicated that for 9 % methane concentration the flame was only 21 ms behind the pressure wave, and for 5 % and 15 % methane concentration the flame was behind the pressure wave in the range of 55 – 93 ms. Due to the limited length of the DT compared with the large volume of methane injected, there was no significant influence on the flame deflagration properties when extending the RS length from 12 m to 25 m, as the mixture initially located after 12 m pushed out through the open end...|$|R
