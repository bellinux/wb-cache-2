60|$|<b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> door-post, the big, strong fellow, {{trembling}} {{from head}} to foot.|$|E
60|$|The Tin Woodman gave {{a sigh of}} {{satisfaction}} and lowered his axe, which <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> tree.|$|E
60|$|N N. gasped for breath. <b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> heavily <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Chinaman.|$|R
5000|$|Later appraisals {{have been}} more favourable. Peter Sharkey in 2005 called it [...] "possibly the {{greatest}} dramatic portrayal of football ever seen on our screens", praising details like players arriving clutching cigarettes and the goalkeeper arguing with his girlfriend as <b>he</b> <b>leans</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> posts, {{as well as the}} atmosphere of alcohol and bad pitches.|$|R
40|$|Photograph {{of an old}} Yokut Indian man {{standing}} beside a shake house, Tule River Reservation near Porterville, California, ca. 1900. The shake shingles are applied horizontally to vertical wooden posts. The open doorway is at right. <b>He</b> <b>leans</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> wall, a long wood pole (a cane?) in his right hand, his left hand crooked in his trousers pocket. He wears a hat and has a short sparse beard and mustache...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> balustrade, nervously {{fingering}} his pipe, and Helen {{sat down}} opposite. She felt curious and disturbed.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> wall, deathly sick, put {{his arms}} out feebly, and fell fainting into the travellerâ€™s arms.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> {{balustrade}} and meditated. The {{light of}} his lantern threw a narrow ray upon the opposite wall.|$|E
5000|$|Highway Patrol stars Broderick Crawford as Dan Mathews, the gruff and {{dedicated}} {{head of a}} police force in an unidentified Western state. A signature shot of the series is fedora-wearing Mathews barking rapid-fire dialogue into a radio microphone as <b>he</b> <b>leans</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> door of his black and white patrol car. Mathews growls [...] "21-50 to headquarters" [...] and the invariable response is [...] "Headquarters by" [...] (as in, standing by).|$|R
6000|$|KIT. That's so (making cuts). All the same, I'm half {{ashamed to}} draw on a blind man; it's too much odds. (<b>He</b> <b>leans</b> {{suddenly}} <b>against</b> <b>the</b> table.) Ah! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But what sudden {{noise is}} that he hears within the house? Why do those heavy steps press so rapidly <b>against</b> <b>the</b> stairs? What feet are they which are so busy in the room above him? He opens the sitting-room door, but he can see nothing. He has been left there without a candle. He peers up the stairs, but a faint glimmer of light shining through the keyhole of his wife's door is all that meets his eye. 'Oh, my aunt! my aunt!' he says as <b>he</b> <b>leans</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> banisters. 'My aunt, my aunt, my aunt!' ...|$|R
60|$|Now {{the knees}} of Hokosa grew weak beneath him, and <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> fence of the kraal for support.|$|E
60|$|Lisle started, for he {{recognized}} the name, and it offered him a lead. Strolling toward the group, <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> table.|$|E
6000|$|... "This {{is a sad}} {{interruption}} to your wedding," [...] remarked the pastor, as <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Fort gate, {{and examined}} his weapon.|$|E
60|$|Joe {{shook his}} head mournfully, stepped back a few paces that <b>he</b> might <b>lean</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> building, and looked about him with a languid air, much {{as if there was}} no longer {{anything}} pleasing for him in life.|$|R
60|$|As for Stephen, <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> back <b>against</b> <b>the</b> {{framework}} of the conservatory, dizzy with the conflict of passions,--love, rage, and confused despair; despair at his want of self-mastery, and despair that he had offended Maggie.|$|R
60|$|A violent fit of {{coughing}} doubled Omar up, and {{he rocked}} himself to and fro, wheezing and moaning in turns, while Babalatchi {{and the girl}} {{looked at him in}} silence. Then <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> back <b>against</b> <b>the</b> tree, exhausted.|$|R
60|$|He {{left her}} {{without waiting for}} a reply, and, {{returning}} with a rug, placed her chair in a sheltered spot; then <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> railing.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> {{door with}} a quiet {{thoughtful}} face while she did so, and then the Celtic temperament revealed itself in the flash in his eyes.|$|E
60|$|He {{left her}} {{without waiting for}} a reply and, {{returning}} with a rug, placed her chair in a sheltered spot, after which <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> rails.|$|E
40|$|Photograph {{of two men}} {{listening}} to a "talking book", [s. d. ]. The men sit opposite each other with the thin, standing radio speaker at center in between them. The man on the left crosses his legs {{in a dark suit}} and glasses. The man on the right wears a lightly-colored suit as <b>he</b> <b>leans</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> near arm of his chair and follows the book in his hands. The man on the left props his left arm on to a glass table just behind them where two more books lie closed. A piano can be seen on the tile floors in the background...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> back <b>against</b> <b>the</b> logs, and chuckled so complacently {{at his own}} conceit that it {{was hard}} to believe this easy-tempered {{creature}} was draining half my neighbors' blood; but I was filled with a great loathing for him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, good merchant, perhaps I might; but I don't {{particularly}} want to know," [...] {{said the}} slave, as <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> back <b>against</b> <b>the</b> gate, leisurely striking {{with his long}} sword at the night-bugs and beetles that were buzzing about.|$|R
60|$|The dun <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> bit and slugged {{his head}} above, But the red mare {{played with the}} snaffle-bars, as a maiden plays with a glove.|$|E
60|$|Jones sighed, and {{the coins}} were produced. The prize fell to Tim, and <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> {{windlass}} and slowly poured the yellow liquid into his mug.|$|E
6000|$|The dun <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> bit and slugged {{his head}} above, [...] But the red mare {{played with the}} snaffle-bars, as a maiden plays with a glove.|$|E
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> back <b>against</b> <b>the</b> bed-rail. [...] "Well, it's in your hands," [...] {{and his own}} made a writhing movement. [...] "I've {{been through}} it. You needn't hit too hard--it isn't worth while. I've been frightened; I've been frightened, Freddie." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> back <b>against</b> <b>the</b> cushions, {{trying to}} achieve a coolness of mind and body. But {{the heat of the}} day kept him unpleasantly soluble, and dismay, that {{perspiration}} of the soul, refused to be absorbed by the pocket-handkerchief of philosophy.|$|R
60|$|Louis {{declined}} {{the chair to}} which I waved him. <b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> slightly back <b>against</b> <b>the</b> table, facing me.|$|R
60|$|It was {{his last}} effort. He could do no more. Everything seemed black to him. <b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> ropes and drank {{in the air in}} great gulps.|$|E
60|$|It was Dave who spoke, as <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> {{rocks and}} gazed sharply {{out into the}} forest, beyond the tiny stream of water flowing beside the improvised fort.|$|E
6000|$|Then aunt Dorcas and {{her family}} were ready for the ride, and Plums said, {{with an air of}} content as <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> {{wonderful}} cushions of the front seat: ...|$|E
60|$|Here Edgar Berrington, {{clothed in}} white canvas and oil, finds genial companionship. He dotes {{on the great}} crank. It is a {{sympathetic}} thing. It represents his feelings wonderfully. Returning from the deck after inhaling a little fresh air, <b>he</b> <b>leans</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> iron bulkhead in these clanking depths and gazes gloomily and for prolonged periods at the crank while it grinds {{with a sort of}} vicious energy that seems in strange harmony with his soul. Sometimes he grinds his teeth as a sort of obbligato accompaniment--especially if he has while on deck, during a wistful gaze at the distant perspective of the aft-regions, beheld, (or fancied he has beheld) a familiar and adored form.|$|R
60|$|The {{doctor had}} dragged a chair to the sidewalk. He was coatless, and <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> back <b>against</b> <b>the</b> wall and smoked, while he stroked his beard. Surprise {{came into his}} pale blue eyes when {{he caught sight of}} Smith in his unusual and {{prismatic}} clothes.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> back <b>against</b> <b>the</b> bar, and now {{his little}} yellow eyes, clear as crystal, {{flawless}} as a hawk's, fixed on the stranger. Other men crowded close, forming a circle, curious, ready to be friendly or otherwise, according to how the tall interrogator marked the new-comer.|$|R
