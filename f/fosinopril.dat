50|$|<b>Fosinopril</b> is de-esterified by {{the liver}} or {{gastrointestinal}} mucosa and {{is converted to}} its active form, fosinoprilat. Fosinoprilat competitively binds to ACE, preventing ACE from binding to and converting angiotensin I to angiotensin II. Inhibiting the production of AII lowers peripheral vascular resistance, decreases afterload, and decreases blood pressure, thus helping to alleviate {{the negative effects of}} AII on cardiac performance. In heart failure patients, <b>fosinopril</b> increases exercise tolerance and lowers the frequency of events associated with worsening heart failure, such as dyspnea, the need for supplemental diuretics, fatigue, and hospitalizations. In a study examining the effects of <b>fosinopril</b> on insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and IGF binding protein serum concentrations in high cardiovascular risk patients, a six-month treatment of <b>fosinopril</b> was associated with an elevation in IGF-1. Since a decline in IGF-1 is associated with an increased risk of ischemic heart disease, <b>fosinopril</b> may reduce ischemic risk.|$|E

All patients underwent echocardiography, metabolic testing, and a 6 -minute walk test and completed the Minnesota questionnaire on inclusion and three months later. Additionally, serum creatinine, BUN, total cholesterol and triglycerides were measured. Kaplan-Meier curve was created to assess event-free survival for cardiac death and hospitalization for heart failure. Results. There was no statistically significant difference in event-free survival between patients on <b>fosinopril</b> and enalapril (86. 7 % vs. 82. 8 %, log rank 4. 21 p= 0. 43). However, time to the event was longer in patients on <b>fosinopril</b> (77. 0 ± 25. 35 vs. 40. 2 ± 6. 8 days, p= 0. 04). At the end of the study, no difference between <b>fosinopril</b> and enalapril group existed with respect to maximal oxygen consumption (20. 90 ± 4. 47 vs. 20. 89 ± 6. 86 ml/kg/mm), ejection fraction (20. 5 ± 7. 4 vs. 2 L 4 ± 7. 8 %), distance during the 6 -minute test walk (313 ± 74 vs. 352 ± 129 meters) and quality of life (23. 8 ± 15. 8 vs. 25. 6 ± 20. 3 points), but patients on enalapril had higher creatinine (99 ± 13 vs. 113 ± 17 umol/L, p= 0. 002) and BUN (7. 28 ± 1. 7 vs. 8. 89 ± 2. 39 mmol/L, p= 0. 01) levels.

Thirty-three patients with untreated mild essential hypertension were randomised to treatment with oral <b>fosinopril</b> (10 mg- 20 mg daily) or placebo for 12 weeks. The primary outcome measure was the change in left ventricular mass index determined by echocardiography. Results. Diastolic blood pressure changed from 95. 5 ± 2. 1 mmHg at baseline to 96. 6 ± 2. 8 mmHg at the final visit in control patients and changed from 96. 6 ± 2. 3 mmHg to 91. 5 ± 3. 0 mmHg in patients treated with <b>fosinopril</b> (P = 0. 04). Systolic blood pressure changed from 147. 4 ± 3. 2 mmHg at baseline to 152. 7 ± 4. 4 mmHg at the final visit in control patients and changed from 157. 6 ± 5. 1 mmHg to 149. 1 ± 6. 1 mmHg in patients treated with <b>fosinopril</b> (P 0. 02). <b>Fosinopril</b> reduced diastolic pressure by 6. 3 (95 % CI 0. 3 - 12. 4) mmHg and systolic pressure by 13. 3 (95 % CI 2. 7 - 23. 8) mmHg compared with placebo.

40|$|Introduction. Elevated plasma matrix metalloproteinase- 9 (MMP- 9) {{levels have}} been {{suggested}} to precede the development of microalbuminuria. As angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors effectively reduce urinary albumin excretion (UAE), {{in the present study}} we have investigated the potential association of plasma MMP- 9 levels with UAE and treatment effects of ACE-inhibition. Material and methods. In a placebo-controlled randomised trial we determined plasma MMP- 9 levels at baseline and after three months of randomisation to either placebo (n= 202) or <b>fosinopril</b> (20 mg/day, n= 204) treatment. Results. Baseline plasma MMP- 9 levels were not related to baseline UAE (r=- 0. 008, p= 0. 871). Three months of <b>fosinopril</b> treatment effectively reduced UAE compared to placebo treatment (- 10. 4 +/- 2. 4 vs. 1. 8 +/- 1. 3 mg/ 24 hours, p Conclusion. The effective reduction of UAE with <b>fosinopril</b> was not related to plasma MMP- 9 levels...|$|E
40|$|Background: The aim of {{this study}} is to compare the {{long-term}} effect of amlodipine and <b>fosinopril</b> in mono-therapy or in combination on urinary albumin excretion (UAE) in hypertensive diabetic patients. Methods: We selected 453 hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria and randomized them to amlodipine (5 to 15 mg/day), <b>fosinopril</b> (10 to 30 mg/day), or amlodipine plus <b>fosinopril</b> (5 / 10 to 15 / 30 mg/day) for a 3 -month titration period. The nonresponder patients or those complaining of side effects during the titration period were discontinued (n 144); the remain-ing 309 patients were enrolled in the trial and treated with the same therapy for 4 years. Every 6 months, blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), UAE, creatinine clearance, and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA 1 c) were evaluated. Results: The combination therapy was more effective in reducing BP than either drug alone at any time of the study without affecting glucose homeostasis. All three treatments provided a significant decrease in UAE during the 48 -month study period. However, this effect was more pronounced and became evident earlier with <b>fosinopril</b> than with amlodipine monotherapy (after 3 v 18 months of therapy). In addition, the combination therapy provided a greater antialbuminuric effect than the single drugs. This could be due to the greater antihypertensive effects, al-though other drug-specific effects cannot be excluded. The cardiovascular outcomes were similar in the amlodipine and in the <b>fosinopril</b> group, but they were lower in the combination group. Conclusions: These results strengthen the rationale to use a calcium-antagonist/angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor combination in the treatment of hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes.

40|$|Vasopeptidase {{inhibition}} attenuates {{the progression}} of renal injury in subtotal nephrectomized rats. BackgroundVasopeptidase inhibitors are {{a new class of}} cardiovascular compounds that inhibit both angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and neutral endopeptidase (NEP). The aim {{of the present study was}} to explore the effects of omapatrilat, a vasopeptidase inhibitor, on renal function and pathology in subtotally nephrectomized (STNx) rats. MethodsSTNx rats were randomized to four groups and treated for 12 weeks: no treatment (N = 14); omapatrilat at a low dose of 10 mg/kg (L, N = 12) and at a high dose of 40 mg/kg (H, N = 10); or an ACE inhibitor, <b>fosinopril,</b> at a dose of 10 mg/kg (N = 12). Sham-operated rats were used as control animals (N = 12). ResultsElevated blood pressure in STNx rats (174 ± 9 mm Hg) was reduced by omapatrilat in a dose-dependent manner (L, 121 ± 3 mm Hg; H, 110 ± 3 mm Hg) and by <b>fosinopril</b> (149 ± 5 mm Hg). Proteinuria in STNx rats (246 ± 73 mg/day) was reduced by treatment with <b>fosinopril</b> (88 ± 21 mg/day) and was normalized by treatment with omapatrilat (L, 30 ± 4 mg/day; H, 20 ± 2 mg/day vs. control 25 ± 1 mg/day). Decreased glomerular filtration rates, elevated plasma urea and creatinine and glomerulosclerosis, and tubulointerstitial fibrosis were ameliorated by omapatrilat and <b>fosinopril</b> to a similar degree. Compared with <b>fosinopril,</b> omapatrilat treatment was associated with increased plasma renin activity and decreased renal ACE and NEP binding in a dose-dependent manner. ConclusionThese findings suggest that vasopeptidase inhibition may provide a useful strategy for the treatment of progressive renal disease...|$|E
40|$|Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors {{represent}} a significant group of drugs primarily {{used in the}} treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure. In this research, seven ACE inhibitors (enalapril, quinapril, <b>fosinopril,</b> lisinopril, cilazapril, ramipril, benazepril) were studied to evaluate the relationship between their protein binding and calculated (logP values) or ultra-high performance liquid chromatographytandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS) and reversed-phase thin-layer chromatography (RP-TLC) lipophilicity data (ϕ 0, CHI or C 0 parameters, respectively). Their protein binding data varied from negligible (lisinopril) to 99 % (<b>fosinopril),</b> while calculated logPKOWWINvalues ranged from - 0. 94 (lisinopril) to 6. 61 (<b>fosinopril).</b> The good correlations were established between protein binding values and logPKOWWIN data (R 2 = 0. 7520) as well as between protein binding and chromatographic hydrophobicity data, ϕ 0, CHI or C 0 parameters (R 2 were 0. 6160, 0. 6242 and 0. 6547, respectively). The possible application of hydrophobicity data in drugs protein binding evaluation can be of great importance in drug bioavailability...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{therapeutic}} effects of <b>fosinopril</b> (F) and amlodipine (A) on regulation and circadian rhythm of blood pressure, and to evaluate left ventricle mass index (LVMI) in patients over 60 years of age with isolated systolic hypertension, after three months of administration period. After one-week placebo run-in period, 60 patients were randomized into two groups, each including 30 patients, to receive either <b>fosinopril</b> or amlodipine for three months. Clinical, echocardiographic examinations and 24 h ambulatory blood pressure measurements were performed at baseline, and after 3 months of therapy. The goal blood pressure was £ 140 / 90 mmHg. It was accomplished in more than two thirds of cases (F 76. 6 %, and A 79. 9 %), with lower drug doses needed in the group treated with F. In 13 patients goal values were not accomplished, therefore the therapy was prolonged for one additional month, with combination of two drugs. In 10 of these patients (76. 9 %), adequate regulation of blood pressure was achieved. Both <b>fosinopril</b> and amlodipine efficiently control blood pressure by once-a-day administration, both significantly influencing its circadian rhythm and resulting in regression of myocardial hyperthrophy. Adequate control of blood pressure and beneficial effects on circadian rhythm of blood pressure are achieved with lower doses of <b>fosinopril...</b>|$|E
40|$|Background— Microalbuminuria is {{associated}} with increased risk of cardiovascular events. We assessed whether therapeutic intervention aimed at lowering urinary albumin excretion would reduce cardiovascular events in microalbuminuric subjects (15 to 300 mg/ 24 hours). Methods and Results— From the Prevention of Renal and Vascular Endstage Disease (PREVEND) cohort (n= 8592), 1439 subjects fulfilled the inclusion criteria of the PREVEND Intervention Trial (PREVEND IT). Of these subjects, 864 were randomized to <b>fosinopril</b> 20 mg or matching placebo and to pravastatin 40 mg or matching placebo. The mean follow-up was 46 months, and the primary end point was cardiovascular mortality and hospitalization for cardiovascular morbidity. Mean age was 51 ± 12 years; 65 % of subjects were male, and 3. 4 % had a previous cardiovascular event. Mean cholesterol level was 5. 8 ± 1. 0 mmol/L, mean systolic/diastolic blood pressure was 130 ± 18 / 76 ± 10 mm Hg, and median urinary albumin excretion was 22. 8 (15. 8 to 41. 3) mg/ 24 hours. The primary end point occurred in 45 subjects (5. 2 %). <b>Fosinopril</b> reduced urinary albumin excretion by 26 % (P< 0. 001). Subjects treated with <b>fosinopril</b> showed a 40 % lower incidence of the primary end point (hazard ratio 0. 60 [95 % CI 0. 33 to 1. 10], P= 0. 098, log-rank). Pravastatin did not reduce urinary albumin excretion, and subjects treated with pravastatin showed a 13 % lower incidence of the primary end point than subjects {{in the placebo group}} (0. 87 [0. 49 to 1. 57], P= 0. 649, log-rank). Conclusions— In microalbuminuric subjects, treatment with <b>fosinopril</b> had a significant effect on urinary albumin excretion. In addition, <b>fosinopril</b> treatment was associated with a trend in reducing cardiovascular events. Treatment with pravastatin did not result in a significant reduction in urinary albumin excretion or cardiovascular events...|$|E
