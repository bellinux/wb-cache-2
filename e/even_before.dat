5|$|<b>Even</b> <b>before</b> Adolf Hitler {{seized control}} of Germany in 1933, the {{problems}} with the Minority Treaties were evident. Various European governments continued to abuse minorities, the latter loudly protested, their complaints were exploited by interested parties with ulterior motives, and the League interfered as little as possible. The system suffered an apparent death blow with Poland's rejection of its treaty in 1934.|$|E

One early contender was the city of Charlotte, North Carolina. <b>Even</b> <b>before</b> Virginia Tech, Miami, and Boston College were chosen as the ACC's picks to expand, Carolinas Stadium Corporation, the owner and operator of Charlotte's Ericsson Stadium (as it was called then) lobbied heavily for Charlotte's selection.
