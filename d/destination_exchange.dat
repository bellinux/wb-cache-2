40|$|Over {{the past}} three decades, {{financial}} markets have experienced a tremendous increase in global linkages. Cross-Listing is one prominent example of these trends. By cross-listing firms can proactively broaden their shareholder basis, overcome limitations of their domestic markets, and link their securities to multiple capital markets at a time. Its far-reaching financial effects are associated with this internationalization of the firm’s capital structure. This thesis focuses on the valuation implications of cross-listing towards major international exchanges. Early attempts to explain these valuation effects called upon international capital market segmentation. This view has since then been highly challenged. Nevertheless, the magnitude of segmentation and its relationship with cross-listing has received much less attention. Our empirical investigations first establish that firms that are about-to-cross-list are not entirely integrated with global capital markets. Furthermore, previous cross-listings which originate from the same home country and country funds both have significant importance to assess the degree of this integration. We next disentangle between the validity of segmentation and informational improvement arguments in explaining the magnitude of cross-listing price effects. Our results suggest that firms that cross-list towards the US markets obtain benefits through the resolution of informational barriers only, while firms from emerging markets derive benefits {{as a function of}} their pre-cross-listing segmentation. Crucially, both channels appear conditional on the preceding cross-listing activity. Finally, reactions to cross-listing prove to be not as immediate as assumed by the classical event study literature. Substantial investors' anticipation of the cross-listing decision is demonstrated, as well as the variation regarding the speed and length of the reactions. Size, <b>destination</b> <b>exchange,</b> {{and the extent to which}} the firm is integrated into international capital markets appear to be the most influential factors...|$|E

30|$|Research on {{wireless}} relay networks {{became popular}} since the pioneering work [1] developed low-complexity cooperative diversity strategies. In [1], data streams flow unidirectionally {{from the source}} to the relay {{and then to the}} destination. This network structure is known as the one-way relay network (OWRN). However, since most communication systems are bidirectional, it is necessary to consider the situation when the source node and the <b>destination</b> node <b>exchange</b> their roles. Such a relay network is known as the two-way relay network (TWRN). In TWRN, the relay treats the received signals in a “network coding”-like manner [2], and the terminals can recover the signal collision since they know their own transmitted signals. As a result, the overall communication rate between two source terminals in TWRN is approximately twice that achieved in OWRN [3].|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The {{problem of}} secret sharing over the Gaussian wiretap channel is considered. A source and a {{destination}} intend to share secret information over a Gaussian channel {{in the presence}} of a wiretapper who observes the transmission through another Gaussian channel. Two constraints are imposed on the source-to-destination channel; namely, the source can transmit only binary phase-shift keyed (BPSK) symbols, and symbolby-symbol hard-decision quantization is applied to the received symbols of the destination. An error-free public channel is also available for the source and <b>destination</b> to <b>exchange</b> messages in order to help the secret-sharing process. The wiretapper can perfectly observe all messages in the public channel. It is shown that a secret-sharing scheme that employs a random ensemble of regular low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes can achieve the key capacity of the BPSK-constrained Gaussian wiretap channel asymptotically with increasing block length. To accommodate practical constraints of finite block length and limited decoding complexity, fixed irregular LDPC codes are also designed to replace the regular LDPC code ensemble in the proposed secretsharing scheme.

40|$|A {{primary goal}} of {{computer}} networks is to facilitate communication between interconnected computers. To achieve this objective, routers – the devices responsible for interconnecting computer networks and forwarding traffic to their intended <b>destination</b> – <b>exchange</b> routing information through routing protocols and then use the disseminated information to calculate routes. As such, routing information plays {{a critical role in}} Internet routing. Errors in routing information can easily result in failure conditions such as forwarding loops which cause packets to cycle through a sequence of routers without ever reaching their destinations. Consequently, much research has been devoted to making routing protocols safe, i. e., free from failure conditions. This thesis brings to light the fundamental role of a previously hidden routing design component called “connecting primitives”. These primitives are introduced by router vendors to support the essential operational requirement of merging multiple domains that run independent routing protocol instances. Despite their important and distinct role from routing protocols, the connecting primitives received little attention from the research community and were poorly understood prior to this work. This thesis provides a comprehensive and deep understanding of the connecting primitives. First...|$|R

From the tenth to sixteenth centuries, transactions occurred primarily along the borders of Amdo (Tib.

Many routes shifted to the towns of Kangding (Tib. Dartsedo) and Songpan (Tib.

40|$|Abstract — In {{cooperative}} ARQ protocols, {{data frame}} retransmissions may {{be performed by}} a neighboring node (the relay) that has successfully overheard the source’s frame transmission. One advantage is the diversity provided by the relay. The three-way (source, <b>destination,</b> relay) frame <b>exchange</b> sequence required in the cooperative ARQ protocols may however introduce extra latency when compared to non-cooperative ARQ protocols. To take advantage of cooperative ARQ protocols, it is then necessary to resort to selective repeat solutions. The focus of the paper is to derive a delay model for cooperative selective repeat ARQ protocols in slotted radio networks. The derived analytical model quantifies, with closed formulas, the queueing and transmission delay experienced by Poisson arriving data frames, whose retransmissions are performed by a single relay.
