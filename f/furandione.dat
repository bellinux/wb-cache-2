40|$|A {{system to}} study the gas and {{particle}} phase products from gas phase hydrocarbon oxidation is described. It consists of a gas phase photochemical flow reactor followed by a diffusion membrane denuder to remove gases from the reacted products, or a filter to remove the particles. Chemical analysis is performed by an atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. A diffusion membrane denuder is shown to remove trace gases to below detectable limits so the particle phase can be studied. The system was tested by examining {{the products of the}} oxidation of m-xylene initiated by HO radicals. Dimethylphenol was observed in both the gas and particle phases although individual isomers could not be identified. Two furanone isomers, 5 -methyl- 2 (3 H) furanone and 3 -methyl- 2 (5 H) furanone were identified in the particulate phase, but the isobaric product 2, 5 <b>furandione</b> was not observed. One isomer of dimethyl-nitrophenol was identified in the particle phase but not in the gas phase. NSERC, CFCAS, MO...|$|E
40|$|Dipivaloylketene (8) is {{generated}} by preparative flash vacuum pyrolysis of <b>furandione</b> 6. While dimerization of 8 in apolar and several polar solvents leads to the previously reported [2 + 4] dimer 7, dimerization {{in the presence of}} DMSO, tributylphosphine oxide, or pyridine instead surprisingly occurs across the C=O bond of the ketene function, affording dioxinone 9. This is a novel type of alpha-oxo ketene dimerization. The reversibility of both dimerizations and mechanistic pathways for the formation of 9 are discussed. Cycloaddition reactions of 8 with heterocumulenes 10 a,b and 12 a-c yield [2 + 4] cycloadducts 11 a,b and 13 a-c, respectively. Oxazinones 13 a-c can add a second molecule of 8 to generate novel spiro heterocycles 14 a-c. In contrast, oxo ketene 7 reacts with carbodiimides 12 a,b, to furnish [2 + 2] adducts 15 a,b. This is the first unequivocal example of a direct [2 + 2] cycloaddition reaction of an alpha-oxo ketene. The unexpected formation of these compounds was confirmed by X-ray crystallography (15 a). General aspects of [2 + 2] versus [2 + 4] cycloaddition in alpha-oxo ketenes are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Outdoor {{smog chamber}} photooxidations to {{determine}} the molecular composition of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) from toluene, m-xylene, p-xylene, ethylbenzene, m-ethyltoluene, p-ethyltoluene, and 1, 2, 4 -trimethylbenzene in sunlight-irradiated hydrocarbon−NO_x mixtures are reported. Gas-phase mechanisms leading to the observed products are proposed. Unsaturated anhydrides (2, 5 -furandione, 3 -methyl- 2, 5 -furandione, 3 -ethyl- 2, 5 -furandione) are predominant components of aerosol from all the aromatics, an observation {{that is consistent with}} gas-phase aromatic mechanisms involving ring fragmentation. Saturated anhydrides were also detected in significant quantities, which could result from the hydrogenation of the <b>furandiones</b> in sunlight in the particle phase...|$|R
40|$|Products of {{secondary}} organic aerosol (SOA) from aromatic {{volatile organic compounds}} (VOCs) – 2, 3 -dihydroxy- 4 -oxopentanoic acid, dicarboxylic acids, nitromonoaromatics, and <b>furandiones</b> – were evaluated for their potential to serve as anthropogenic SOA tracers {{with respect to their}} (1)  ambient concentrations and detectability in PM 2. 5 in Iowa City, IA, USA; (2)  gas–particle partitioning behaviour; and (3)  source specificity by way of correlations with primary and secondary source tracers and literature review. A widely used tracer for toluene-derived SOA, 2, 3 -dihydroxy- 4 -oxopentanoic acid was only detected in the particle phase (F p [*]=[*] 1) at low but consistently measurable ambient concentrations (averaging 0. 3  ng m − 3). Four aromatic dicarboxylic acids were detected at relatively higher concentrations (9. 1 – 34. 5  ng m − 3), of which phthalic acid was the most abundant. Phthalic acid had a low particle-phase fraction (F p [*]=[*]  0. 26) likely due to quantitation interferences from phthalic anhydride, while 4 -methylphthalic acid was predominantly in the particle phase (F p [*]=[*] 0. 82). Phthalic acid and 4 -methylphthalic acid were both highly correlated with 2, 3 -dihydroxy- 4 -oxopentanoic acid (r s [*]=[*] 0. 73, p [*]=[*] 0. 003; r s [*]=[*] 0. 80, p [*]<[*] 0. 001, respectively), suggesting that they were derived from aromatic VOCs. Isophthalic and terephthalic acids, however, were detected only in the particle phase (F p [*]=[*] 1), and correlations suggested association with primary emission sources. Nitromonoaromatics were dominated by particle-phase concentrations of 4 -nitrocatechol (1. 6  ng m − 3) and 4 -methyl- 5 -nitrocatechol (1. 6  ng m − 3) that were associated with biomass burning. Meanwhile, 4 -hydroxy- 3 -nitrobenzyl alcohol was detected in a lower concentration (0. 06  ng m − 3) in the particle phase only (F p [*]=[*] 1) and is known as a product of toluene photooxidation. <b>Furandiones</b> in the atmosphere have only been attributed to the photooxidation of aromatic hydrocarbons; however the substantial partitioning toward the gas phase (F p  [*]≤[*]  0. 16) and their water sensitivity limit their application as tracers. The outcome of this study is the demonstration that 2, 3 -dihydroxy- 4 -oxopentanoic acid, phthalic acid, 4 -methylphthalic acid, and 4 -hydroxy- 3 -nitrobenzyl alcohol are good candidates for tracing SOA from aromatic VOCs...|$|R
40|$|Outdoor {{smog chamber}} {{experiments}} {{have been performed}} to determine the secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation potential of various C 7, C 8, and C 9 aromatics in sunlight-irradiated hydrocarbon- NO[subscript x] mixtures. Measured aerosol yields from toluene,m-xylene, p -xylene, ethylbenzene, m -ethyltoluene, p-ethyltoluene, and 1, 2, 4 -trimethylbenzene were found to correlate with organic mass concentration according to semi-volatile gas/particle partitioning theory. Aerosol yields of the C 9 aromatics were greater {{than those of the}} C 8 aromatics, with m-ethyltoluene resulting in the greatest yields. Toluene and ethylbenzene demonstrated some aerosol-forming potential, but the other aromatics produced significantly more SOA. Filter samples were also collected during the experiments to determine the molecular composition of the SOA from these aromatics Gas-phase mechanisms leading to these products have been proposed. Unsaturated anhydrides (2, 5 -furandione, 3 -methyl- 2, 5 -furandione, 3 -ethyl- 2, 5 -furandione) are predominant components of aerosol from all the aromatics, an observation that is consistent with gas-phase aromatic mechanisms involving ring-fragmentation. Saturated anhydrides were also detected in significant quantities, which could result from the hydrogenation of <b>furandiones</b> in sunlight in the particle phase. A new organic aerosol extraction procedure utilizing supercritical CO 2 extraction is outlined. Outdoor smog chamber experiments were also performed to characterize aerosol from 1 -octene and 1 -decene photooxidation. The dominant aerosol species were heptanal, heptanoic acid, and dihydro- 5 -propyl- 2 (3 H) -furanone from 1 -octene, and nonanal, nonanoic acid, and dihydro- 5 -pentyl- 2 (3 H) -furanone from 1 -decene. Gas-phase oxidation mechanisms of 1 -octene and 1 -decene with OH and O 3 account for the aerosol products...|$|R
40|$|The Aerodyne Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (AMS) {{was used}} to {{characterize}} {{physical and chemical properties}} of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formed during ozonolysis of cycloalkenes and biogenic hydrocarbons and photooxidation of m-xylene. Comparison of mass and volume distributions from the AMS and Differential Mobility Analyzers yielded estimates of “effective ” density of the SOA in the range of 0. 64 - 1. 45 g/cm 3, depending on the particular system. Increased contribution of the fragment at m/z 44, CO 2 + ion fragment of oxygenated organics, and higher “delta ” values, based on ion series analysis of the mass spectra, in nucleation experiments of cycloalkenes suggest greater contribution of more oxygenated molecules to the SOA compared to those formed under seeded experiments. Dominant negative “delta ” values of SOA formed during ozonolysis of biogenics indicates presence of terpene derivative structures or cyclic or unsaturated oxygenated compounds in the SOA. Evidence of acid-catalyzed heterogeneous chemistry, characterized by greater contribution of higher molecular weight fragments to the SOA and corresponding changes in “delta ” patterns, is observed in the ozonolysis of α-pinene. Mass spectra of SOA formed during photooxidation of m-xylene exhibit features consistent with the presence of <b>furandione</b> compounds and nitro organics. This study demonstrates that mixtures of SOA compounds produced from similar precursors result in broadly similar AMS mass spectra. Thus, fragmentation patterns observed for biogenic vs. anthropogenic SOA may be useful in determining the sources of ambient SOA. 364 10. 2...|$|E
