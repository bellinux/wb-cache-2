2500|$|But {{the quest}} for {{recorded}} moving images was a more complex challenge. In the 1890s, moving pictures of any kind (whether taken with visible light or with invisible radiation) were emerging technologies. Because the word photography (literally [...] "recording/engraving with light") was long since established as connoting a still-image medium, the word cinematography (literally [...] "recording/engraving movement") was coined for the new medium of visible-light moving pictures. Soon several new words were coined for achieving moving radiographic pictures. This was often done either by filming a simple fluoroscopic screen with a movie camera (variously called <b>fluorography,</b> cinefluorography, photofluorography, or fluororadiography) or by taking serial radiographs rapidly {{to serve as the}} frames in a movie (cineradiography). Either way, the resulting film reel could be displayed by a movie projector. Another group of techniques were various kinds of kymography, whose common theme was capturing recordings in a series of moments, with a concept similar to movie film although not necessarily with movie-type playback; rather, the sequential images would be compared frame by frame (a distinction comparable to tile mode versus cine mode in today's CT terminology). Thus electrokymography and roentgenkymography were among the early ways to record images from a simple fluoroscopic screen.|$|E

Charged with photographing surgical pathology specimens, Abreu quickly developed new and better devices and methods for this. In 1916, Abreu started to work at the Hôtel-Dieu and had his first contact with medical radiography, which had been discovered by the German physicist Wilhelm Röntgen just 20 years before. He became the director of the laboratory of radiology of the hospital in substitution to the previous director, Dr. Jean Guilleminot, who was conscripted to fight in the First World War. It was in this position, by suggestion of Guilleminot, that Abreu became interest in <b>fluorography,</b> or the photographic recording of fluoroscopic x-ray images of the lungs. He soon was able to perceive the immense diagnostic value of these images for tuberculosis and other pulmonary affections, and he began his photographic studies of the lungs in 1918, now at the Laennec Hospital (also in France).|$|E

The changes in the estimated number of undetected active tuberculosis cases have been calculated, provided {{that there was no}} 100 % coverage by preventive <b>fluorography</b> screening. The obtained data were compared with the rates in the Russian Federation. Results. Nosologic structure of chest pathologies has been analyzed. It has been found out that respiratory tuberculosis patients made 4. 8 - 10. 8 % out of those screened in 2007 - 2015, non-specific pulmonary diseases made – 16. 6 - 36. 2 %, cancer cases made – 4. 9 - 7. 0 % and other disorders made – 49. 3 - 72. 0 %. Due to annual <b>fluorography</b> screening conducted in Voronezh Region from 2007 to 2015 the hidden reservoir of tuberculous infection significantly reduced and thus the number of detected patients decreased every year.

The four basic proteins with mol. wts. 21000, 18000 (large basic protein), 17000 and 14000 (small basic protein) were shown to be phosphorylated after electrophoresis in both acid-urea- and sodium dodecyl sulphate-containing gel systems followed by <b>fluorography.</b> The four basic proteins imparted bluish-green colour, after staining with Amido Black, which is characteristic of myelin basic proteins. The four basic proteins were purified to homogeneity. <b>Fluorography</b> of the purified basic proteins after re-electrophoresis revealed the presence of phosphorylated high-molecular-weight `polymers' associated with each basic protein. The amino acid compositions of the phosphorylated large basic protein and small basic proteins are compatible with the amino acid sequences. Proteins with mol. wts. 21000 and 17000 gave the expected amino acid composition of myelin basic proteins.

40|$|Euglena {{chloroplast}} polypeptides {{are resolved}} by {{an adaptation of}} the two-dimensional gel electrophoretic technique of O'Farrell (1975 J Biol Chem 250 : 4007 - 4021). The present results are compared with those obtained by our earlier two-dimensional gel analyses {{as well as those}} obtained by one-dimensional gel analyses. Up to 75 micrograms of Euglena chloroplast polypeptides are resolved on one-dimensional sodium dodecylsulfate linear gradient 7. 5 to 15 % polyacrylamide gels into 43 stained polypeptide bands compared to only 33 bands resolved on a similar gel containing only 10 % polyacrylamide. In contrast, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (isoelectric focusing for the first dimension, sodium dodecylsulfate gel electrophoresis for the second dimension) further improves the resolution of the chloroplast polypeptides and especially so when a linear gradient gel is used for the second dimension. Delipidation of Euglena chloroplasts with acetone-ether and subsequent solubilization of polypeptides with Triton X- 100 followed by sonication are all necessary for successful resolution of chloroplast polypeptides on two-dimensional gels. Up to 300 micrograms of chloroplast polypeptides can be clearly resolved into 56 to 59 stainable spots by the present two-dimensional gel technique when a linear gradient gel is used for the second dimension. Thus, about 30 % of the polypeptide bands on a one-dimensional gel are separated into multiple polypeptides on a two-dimensional gel. The use of two-dimensional gels to separate labeled polypeptides with subsequent detection of labeled spots by autoradiography or <b>fluorography</b> again improves the resolution of the chloroplast polypeptides. For example, when 35 S-labeled chloroplast polypeptides are separated by the present two-dimensional gel technique with a linear gradient polyacrylamide gel in the second dimension, autoradiography or <b>fluorography</b> detects over 80 individual polypeptide spots. This is about twice the number resolved by our previous analyses which used a 10 % polyacrylamide gel in the second dimension. Polypeptides detected range in molecular weight from about 8. 5 to about 145 kilodaltons with apparent isoelectric points from pH 4. 5 to 8. 0. <b>Fluorography</b> provides rapid detection of labeled polypeptides and is 10 times more sensitive than autoradiography...|$|E

By chest digital <b>fluorography</b> 247 patients with clinically diagnosed COPD stage I–III were examined. The average age of the patients was (55. 3  1. 7) years (16 to 88 years), forced expiration volume for the first second (FEV 1) was (59. 17  16. 28) %. It was shown that for patients with COPD stage I most characteristic radiographic symptom was emphysema of the lung in the upper regions (26 (48 %) of 54 patients); the mean values of the inspiratory lung optical density (ILOD) ranged from (703. 48  2. 15) to (807. 47  5. 61) optical density units (ODU), the expiratory lung optical density (ELOD) – from (786. 05  6. 15) to (830. 23  4. 71) ODU. For patients with COPD stage II the most common radiographic sign was the presence of amplification and deformation pulmonary pattern (95 (89 %) of 107 patients); the mean values of ILOD ranged from (646. 20  4. 94) to (791. 38  2. 81) ODU, ELOD – from (677. 34  9. 91) to (813. 91  3. 29) ODU. Patients with COPD stage III were characterized by a combination of amplification and deformation pulmonary pattern (77 (90 %) of 86 patients) with lung emphysema (51 (59 %) of 86 patients); the mean values of the inspiratory lung optical density ranged from (765. 93  16. 4) to (863. 37  15. 83) ODU, expiratory lung optical density – from (826. 80  11. 64) to (881. 37  4. 29) ODU.
