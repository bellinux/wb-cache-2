5000|$|Particularly for {{intravenous}} administration, self-injection {{in the arm}} can be awkward, {{and some}} people modify a syringe for single-handed operation by removing the plunger and affixing a bulb such as from a large dropper or baby pacifier {{to the end of}} the barrel to in effect make it a large <b>dropper</b> <b>with</b> a needle affixed. This is therefore a variant of the common method of injection <b>with</b> a <b>dropper</b> <b>with</b> the hypodermic needle affixed, using a [...] "collar" [...] made of paper or other material to create a seal between the needle and dropper. Removing part of the plunger assembly by cutting off most of the shaft and thumb rest and affixing the bulb {{to the end of the}} barrel, thereby allowing the bulb to operate the plunger by suction, also does work in many cases.|$|R

40|$|We have {{demonstrated}} that piezoelectrically driven, squeeze mode, tubular reservoir liquid drop generation, originally developed as a “drop-on-demand ” method for ejection of microdrops of pure liquid or liquid suspensions of powdered bulk materials, can successfully operate with dry powder. Spherical silver powder with maximum particle diameter of 20 µm (- 635 mesh) was loaded into and ejected from a 100 µm orifice glass <b>dropper</b> <b>with</b> flat piezoelectric disk driver. Time of flight experiments were performed to optimize the dropper operation parameters and to determine the size and velocity of the ejected particles. It was found that at certain values of the ampli-tude, duration, and repetition rate of the voltage pulses applied to the dropper piezoelectric disk, one can produce ejection of powder clots of a stable size, comparable <b>with</b> the <b>dropper</b> orifice diameter. In contrast to the <b>dropper</b> operation <b>with</b> a liquid, {{in the case of}} silver powder, a clot is not ejected at each high voltage pulse, but quasi-periodically with an interval corresponding to thousands of pulses. The application of the dry powder clot generation technique for injection of atoms into helium buffer gas at cryogenic tempera-tures is discussed...|$|R

40|$|A {{simple method}} for {{measuring}} gas production by microorganisms {{by using a}} pressure transducer to sense pressure buildup was developed and tested {{with members of the}} coliform group. The test system consisted of a 5. 0 lb/in 2 pressure transducer and a <b>pressure</b> <b>equalizer</b> valve attached to the metal cap of a test tube (20 by 150 mm); gas pressure was recorded on a strip-chart recorder. Gas pressure response curves consisted of (i) a lag period with no marked increase in pressure, (ii) a rapid pressure buildup period, and (iii) a leveling-off period. A linear relationship was established between inoculum size and length of the lag period. Cultures shaken at 200 oscillations/min showed a marked increase in rate of gas release over stationary cultures. Cell concentrations at the time of rapid buildup in pressure were 108 /ml. Mean maximum pressure recordings, lb/in 2 per 10 ml of broth, were: Enterobacter aerogenes, 3. 70; Citrobacter intermedium, 2. 70; and Escherichia coli, 2. 10. Mean CO 2 concentrations, ppm of headspace gas, for E. coli were: (i) 2, 000 at time of inoculation, (ii) 25, 000 at time of rapid buildup in pressure, and (iii) 150, 000 at maximum pressure. These results indicate the potential application of the pressure transducer method for rapidly detecting coliforms and other gas-producing microorganisms in clinical samples and in sterility testing of foods...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY The {{usefulness}} of thallium- 201 myocardial imaging in assessing right ventricular (RV) overloading was evaluated and {{compared with the}} electrocardiographic and hemodynamic measurements. Multiple unprocessed photoscans were obtained using a gamma camera in 47 patients who had chronic RV overload, including 28 subjects <b>with</b> <b>pressure</b> overload, 14 <b>with</b> volume overload and five <b>with</b> <b>pressure</b> and volume overload. <b>With</b> <b>pressure</b> overload the degree of RV visualization (RVV) was correlated with elevation of RV systolic <b>pressure.</b> <b>With</b> volume overload the RV free wall was visualized in all patients, and RVV was correlated with the increment in pulmonary-to-systemic flow ratio. Pressure and volume overload could be differentiated from the morphologic characteristics of myocardial image. <b>With</b> <b>pressure</b> overload the interventricular septum appeared straight. With volume overload the RV cavity appeared to be dilated and the interventricular septum convex to the right ventricle. Myocardial images were compared with ECG findings of RV hypertrophy in cases <b>with</b> <b>pressure</b> overload. RVV intensity correlated {{with the number of}} criteria (Sokolow and Lyon) satisfied in each tracing. The sen-sitivity of myocardial imaging for diagnosis of RV pressure overload was 93. 3 %, higher than that of ECG cri-teria for RV hypertrophy.
