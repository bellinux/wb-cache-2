The addi-tion of 0. 025 % carrageenan to intrapleural 0. 075 % Evans blue injections increased the effusive response. The amount of effusion varied from assay to assay; in 162 control groups (six rats/group) the estimated population mean volume of pleural fluid ± 5. E. at six hours was 7. 5 ± 0. 07 ml. The reduction in the volume of pleural fluid elicited by the nonsteroidal antirheumatic drugs was dose related in contrast to the lack of consistent dose dependency when the dye alone was the pleural irritant. Relative potencies of the test compounds were determined in 2 by 3 assays with half-log dose increments, and the results were analyzed by factorial analyses. Their activities relative to phenylbutazone were: indomethacin, 26. 9; flufenamic acid, 2. 1; gold sodium thiomalate, 1. 1; <b>indoxole,</b> 1. 0; and acetylsalicylic acid, 03. With the exception of gold sodium thiomalate (i. m.), all compounds were administered p. o. Chloroquine phosphate and d-penicillamine failed to influence the effusive response. The re-suits show that Evans blue-carrageenan-induced {{pleural effusion}} may be used to determine the relative potency of gold- and phenylbutazone-type antirheumatic compounds. The pleural response to various agents has been utilized for studying vascular permeabilit...|$|E
40|$|The prostaglandins produce {{elevation}} of intraocular pressure and {{breakdown of the}} blood-aqueous barrier. They act via the secondary messenger system, cyclic AMP. Although the pathogenesis of many forms of ocular inflammation, both external and internal, is unclear, {{it is evident that}} some forms of ocular inflammation are prostaglandin-mediated, at least in part. Others may be totally mediated by prostaglandin synthesis. At present the corticosteroids are the mainstay of therapy of these conditions. However, the corticosteroids are poor inhibitors of prostaglandin synthesis and have many deleterious side effects such as induction of ocular hypertension, cataract, and infection. The search for new agents that will obviate these side effects and be more specific for the disease process is crucial. The discovery that the mode of action of many nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents is via inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis places a premium on elucidating which of these agents is most effective and least toxic in the eye and by which route of administration. The arachidonic acid screening model is ideal for initially choosing which agent has the greatest potential clinically. Arachidonic acid, a PGE 2 precursor, when given topically also elevates intraocular pressure and aqueous humor protein, and these effects are blocked by the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. This occurs if the arachidonic acid is injected into the vitreous humor, too, providing evidence that this in vivo model involves intraocular mechanisms. Utilizing the arachidonic acid system, a comparative study of nonsteroidal inhibitors of prostaglandin synthesis shows that the most effective of 14 agents were flurbiprofen solution and suspensions of polysorbate-dispersed <b>indoxole,</b> meclofenamic acid, indomethacin, and clonixin. Animal uveitis is not an ideal model for the human condition. Nevertheless, proving the superior efficacy of a screened drug in this system will identify those drugs to be tested in the human disease states. Only after the very few best drugs of this nature are identified should the ultimate steps of human testing be initiated...|$|E
