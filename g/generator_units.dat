25|$|This 200 MW {{station has}} three {{hydraulic}} turbine <b>generator</b> <b>units,</b> causes {{less than one}} half square kilometre of new flooding, and has only a small reservoir. This project had the most extensive environmental review of any generating project in Manitoba. Participation of the Nisichawayasihk Cree Nation (NCN) First Nation was passed by a June 2006 referendum by NCN members. This partnership between NCN and Manitoba Hydro will allow advancement of the in-service date to 2012 and opportunities for additional export revenue. Otherwise the domestic load growth would not require this new capacity until several years later.|$|E

500|$|Salmon Creek {{reservoir}} is {{a secondary}} source {{of drinking water}} which is provided in conjunction with Alaska Electric Light and Power Company (AEL). Water is drawn from near the Salmon Creek power generation plant, which is located near sea level. Tail waters from the power station are then pumped to a water treatment plant for chlorination, and pH and alkalinity adjustment with soda ash before the water is supplied to the distribution system. This system was commissioned by the City Borough of Juneau (CBJ) in 1984, after the lower Salmon Creek Powerhouse was re-commissioned with new generating units. The reservoir is also used as chlorine contact tanks, where chlorine is added for purification and given time to react with any pathogens, before it is supplied to the city. However, this source is subject to seasonal high turbidity and also interruptions due to the annual maintenance of the <b>generator</b> <b>units.</b> This system is able to supply [...] of water, which covers about one third area of Juneau. The water resources are generally pollution-free and quality is monitored and tested every month to check for drinking-water standards set by the EPA and Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation (ADEC).|$|E

40|$|Languages {{for music}} audio {{processing}} typically offer a large assortment of <b>unit</b> <b>generators.</b> There is great duplication among different language implementations, as each language must implement {{many of the}} same (or nearly the same) <b>unit</b> <b>generators.</b> Csound has a large library of <b>unit</b> <b>generators</b> and could be a useful source of reusable <b>unit</b> <b>generators</b> for other languages or for direct use in applications. In this study, we consider how Csound <b>unit</b> <b>generators</b> can be exposed to direct access by other audio processing languages. Using Aura as an example, we modified Csound to allow efficient, dynamic allocation of individual <b>unit</b> <b>generators</b> without using the Csound compiler or writing Csound instruments. We then extended Aura using automatic code generation so that Csound <b>unit</b> <b>generators</b> can be accessed in the normal way from within Aura. In this scheme, Csound details are completely hidden from Aura users. We suggest that these techniques might eliminate most of the effort of building <b>unit</b> <b>generator</b> libraries and could help with the implementation of embedded audio systems where <b>unit</b> <b>generators</b> are needed but a full embedded Csound engine is not required.
