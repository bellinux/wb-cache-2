2500|$|I was {{not more}} than {{thirteen}} years old, when in my loneliness and destitution I longed for some one to whom I could go, as to a father and protector. The preaching of a white Methodist minister, named Hanson, was the means of causing me to feel that in God I had such a friend. He thought that all men, great and small, bond and free, were sinners {{in the sight of}} God: that they were by nature rebels against His government; and that they must repent of their sins, and be reconciled to God through Christ. I cannot say that I had a very distinct notion of what was required of me, but one thing I did know well: I was wretched and had no means of making myself otherwise.I consulted a good old colored man named Charles Lawson, and in tones of holy affection he told me to pray, and to [...] "cast all my care upon God." [...] This I sought to do; and though for weeks I was a poor, broken-hearted mourner, traveling through doubts and fears, <b>I</b> <b>finally</b> <b>found</b> my burden lightened, and my heart relieved. I loved all mankind, slaveholders not excepted, though I abhorred slavery more than ever. I saw the world in a new light, and my great concern was to have everybody converted. My desire to learn increased, and especially, did I want a thorough acquaintance with the contents of the Bible.|$|E

5000|$|The band's sound {{has changed}} since the release of this EP, and the band {{acknowledges}} this change. Many fans like the sound from Glitz better than the band's LP, Whisper War, but the band realizes they had to mature at some point. Alex DeLeon {{had this to say}} about the change in the band's sound:"(We) have definitely grown from (the Glitz songs) and our music now is much different. Since then, us and our old guitarist have also gone our separate ways. We are now more soulful and poppy, I think <b>I</b> have <b>finally</b> <b>found</b> my niche and groove in this band and with the songs. Although, the new stuff is way different from our older material, I think that our old fans will still dig it. Like I said before, we just play the music we love and feel and hopefully people like it half as much as we do. I have been listening to a lot of Brian McKnight, Maroon 5, Joss Stone, Justin Timberlake, Stevie Wonder, and Robin Thicke lately." ...|$|R

5000|$|A former NAP {{campaign}} worker, Loren Redwood, gave a {{much more}} critical account of her experiences with the New Alliance Party in a 1989 {{letter to the editor}} of Coming Up!, a lesbian and gay newspaper published in San Francisco. In the letter, Redwood describes having fallen in love with a NAP campaign worker and the difficulties she encountered after joining her lover on the road campaigning for Fulani:NAP claims to be a multi-racial, black led, woman led, pro gay, political party, an organization which recognizes and fights against racism, sexism, classism and homophobia [...] - [...] but NAP is a lie. NAP is always using the slogan: [...] "the personal is political" [...] and emphasizing the importance of enacting one's politics into daily life. But this vision and the way their politics are enacted within the organization and life of those working for them is very much in conflict. As a working class lesbian, I thought <b>I</b> had <b>finally</b> <b>found</b> a political movement which included me. What I found instead was an oppressive, disempowering, misogynistic machine. All my decisions were made for me by someone else. I was told where to go, and who to go with.|$|R
30|$|In conclusion, the {{findings}} from my regression analyses on the determinants of managers’ DVA reporting are consistent with claims from the public DVA debate that managers give specific DVA information more often on large negative DVAs than on large positive DVAs. I also find that managers seem more likely to give rather profound disclosures (i.e., directional DVA information, evaluative comments, and non-GAAP figures excluding DVAs) {{in the presence of}} strategic incentives, i.e., when DVAs cause net losses or results that compare unfavorably to last year’s results. <b>Finally,</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> weak evidence that such situations also incentivize managers to place DVAs more prominently in press releases.|$|R

5000|$|Although {{the lyrics}} {{are not exactly}} reconcilable with the {{historic}} details of {{the life and death}} of the famous Mexican revolutionary Pancho Villa, Van Zandt does not rule out the idea. In an interview, he recalled, [...] "I realize that I wrote it, but it's hard to take credit for the writing, because it came from out of the blue. It came through me and it's a real nice song, and <b>I</b> think, I've <b>finally</b> <b>found</b> out what it's about. I've always wondered what it's about. I kinda always knew it wasn't about Pancho Villa, and then somebody told me that Pancho Villa had a buddy whose name in Spanish meant 'Lefty.' But in the song, my song, Pancho gets hung.

5000|$|Theano is {{a common}} name for some fonts I have {{designed}} from historic samples. Most of these fonts were initially intended as Greek-only faces, but <b>finally</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> it interesting to supplement them with stylistically compatible Latin letters, thus reproducing the general look of old classical text editions. For this reason Theano fonts currently have no additional weights or styles and don't provide extensive Unicode coverage: just a standard set of Latin, Greek and Cyrillic characters (including the full polytonic set for Greek) and some additional characters I found interesting to design. Nevertheless I decided to make them publicly available in the hope they can be useful for other classicists or medievalists.|$|R
