On the other hand, Australia was only willing to rest KerryGlenn Patching swam the backstroke leg in his place. The hosts led the Australians from the start and extended their margin over each of the first three legs. Brooks reclaimed 1.34s on the freestyle leg, but the Australians fell 0.13s short to come second in their heat. Nevertheless, the Australians still qualified in second place overall, as they and the Soviets were more than 1.5s faster than the third-placed Hungarians. In any case, despite resting all of their first-choice quartet, the home team were still faster than the Australians, who had fielded all but one of their full-strength team.|$|E

25|$|If the {{day before}} Passover falls on Shabbat, most {{authorities}} rule that the fast is set for the previous Thursday, and this has become common practice.

In such a scenario, the ritual of Bedikas Chametz (the formal search for forbidden leaven that is conducted before Passover) is set <b>for</b> <b>Thursday</b> night. Normally, it is forbidden to eat (starting from nightfall) before conducting the Bedikas Chametz.
