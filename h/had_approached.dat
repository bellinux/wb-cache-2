On 1 November 2006, the Xinhua News Agency published the information on its military website that China planned to introduce the Su-33. China had previously obtained a manufacturing license for Su-27 production.|$|E
5|$|During {{the years}} {{preceding}} {{the siege of}} Venice, {{it was believed that}} the Ottoman Empire had preparations underway to attack Malta. This suspicion became stronger when a well-groomed man, who <b>had</b> <b>approached</b> the Order to serve as engineer and offer his wealth of knowledge about fortifications, disappeared shortly after having surveyed Malta's fortifications. Consequently, the Order began its preparations to counter any possible attack by the Ottoman army.|$|E

5|$|In a paper {{published}} in 2009, {{researchers found that}} mockingbirds were able to recall an individual human who, earlier in the study, <b>had</b> <b>approached</b> and threatened the mockingbirds' nest. Researchers had one participant stand near a mockingbird nest and touch it, while others avoided the nest. Later, the mockingbirds recognized the intruder and exhibited defensive behavior, while ignoring the other individuals.|$|E

5|$|Rumours {{circulated}} that Coulthard may {{be replaced}} by Schumacher for the 1999 season and beyond and, in a previous edition of the F1 Racing magazine, Ron Dennis revealed that he <b>had</b> <b>approached</b> Schumacher to sign a deal with McLaren. However, peripheral financial issues that tied Schumacher with Ferrari, such as sponsorship agreements and payment, could not be rectified in a move to the rival team and so no deal came to fruition.|$|E

5|$|Several {{developments}} in the 1900s improved the outcome for those with pneumonia. With the advent of penicillin and other antibiotics, modern surgical techniques, and intensive care in the 20th century, mortality from pneumonia, which <b>had</b> <b>approached</b> 30%, dropped precipitously in the developed world. Vaccination of infants against Haemophilus influenzae type B began in 1988 {{and led to a}} dramatic decline in cases shortly thereafter. Vaccination against Streptococcus pneumoniae in adults began in 1977, and in children in 2000, resulting in a similar decline.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after his}} arrival in Australia, it was {{reported}} in the British media that Fowler would be making a swift return to his homeland and sign for League One side Tranmere Rovers, who had just appointed Fowler's former Liverpool teammate John Barnes as manager. However, Fowler was quick to dismiss talk of a quick return to England. When Barnes was dismissed three months later, it was reported that Tranmere <b>had</b> <b>approached</b> Fowler about becoming player-manager, but these reports too were dismissed.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} was commissioned in 1546 after Titian {{had made a}} number of portraits of Paul. He had already depicted Pier Luigi and three of his children – Vittoria, Alessandro and Ranuccio. Ottavio was perhaps again portrayed by him in 1552, and most likely commissioned the original Naples panel in Titian's Danaë series, although Lodovico Dolce believed it was Alessandro who <b>had</b> <b>approached</b> Titian.|$|E

5|$|About {{ten minutes}} after the surrender, Pritchard heard rapid gunfire to the north. He left Davis and the {{captured}} men {{in the hands of}} his 21-year-old adjutant. Once he <b>had</b> <b>approached</b> the gunfire, he realized it was the 4th Michigan and the 1st Wisconsin shooting at each other with Spencer repeating carbines, neither realizing who they were shooting at. Pritchard immediately ordered his men to stop and shouted to the 1st Wisconsin to identify the parties. In the five-minute skirmish, the 1st Wisconsin Cavalry had suffered eight men wounded, while the 4th Michigan Cavalry had lost two men killed and one wounded.|$|E
5|$|After {{the impact}}, villagers who <b>had</b> <b>approached</b> the impact site grew sick from a then-unexplained illness, {{with a wide}} array of symptoms. Two days later, Peruvian {{scientists}} confirmed that there had indeed been a meteorite strike, quieting widespread speculation that {{it may have been a}} geophysical rather than a celestial event. At that point, no further information on the cause of the mystery illness was known. The ground water in the local area is known to contain arsenic compounds, and the illness is now believed to have been caused by arsenic poisoning incurred when residents of the area inhaled the vapor of the boiling arsenic-contaminated water.|$|E
5|$|Bartlett {{decided to}} send a team back to {{establish}} {{the exact location of}} the island that the Anderson party <b>had</b> <b>approached,</b> and to determine if Anderson had actually landed there. An injury to his knee ruled Mamen out from this mission, which was undertaken by ship's steward Ernest Chafe, with the Inuit pair, Kataktovik and Kuraluk. Chafe's group came within 2 miles (3km) of Herald Island before being stopped by open water. A careful examination through binoculars revealed no signs of the missing party, and Chafe concluded that Anderson and company had not reached the island. Chafe and his party then returned to Shipwreck Camp.|$|E

5|$|Columbia Records {{executive}} Tommy Mottola <b>had</b> <b>approached</b> Anthony to sign {{a contract}} with the company to record an album in English during the peak period of Latin artists crossing over the Anglophone market. Nonetheless, his contract with RMM denied Anthony the right to perform in Spanish for Colombia Records. This resulted in a lawsuit against Mercado because Anthony did not want to work under him anymore. As part of the settlement, RMM Records retained the rights to his earlier albums and to release a greatest hits collection from them while Anthony no longer had any obligations to RMM.|$|E
5|$|During the duel between Vengeur and Brunswick, the {{undamaged}} HMS Ramillies <b>had</b> <b>approached</b> and {{put herself}} in a favourable position to rake Vengeur, and was waiting for Brunswick to separate to open fire. When she did so, Ramillies fired two broadsides, leaving Vengeur with only her foremast standing, which fell half an hour later. Ramillies sustained some damage herself. Soon afterwards, seawater inundated the powder room of Vengeur, denying her all means of defence, and 250 of her crew were out of action. The Trente-et-un Mai closed in around 3:30, attempting to provide assistance, but the proximity of several British sails endangered her so that she eventually sailed away.|$|E
5|$|Fleming {{retained}} {{an interest}} in the subject and when Sillitoe suggested to the editor of The Sunday Times, Denis Hamilton, that the paper may want to write a story on the International Diamond Security Organisation, Hamilton offered the story to Fleming. Sillitoe also offered his deputy, retired MI5 officer John Collard, as liaison for Fleming to interview. During World War II, Collard had assisted in the planning of Operation Overlord as part of MI11 and had joined MI5 under Sillitoe at the war's end. Whilst in MI5 he {{played a major role in}} the capture and conviction of the atomic spy Klaus Fuchs, before Sillitoe <b>had</b> <b>approached</b> him in 1954 to work for the International Diamond Security Organisation.|$|E

5|$|Goldstein was {{the host}} of Gone Too Far, a drug {{intervention}} reality show for MTV. He <b>had</b> <b>approached</b> MTV in mid 2008, pitching {{the idea of a}} reality show that focused on his life to Tony DiSanto. DiSanto said that such shows were declining in popularity, and instead suggested a drug intervention show to which Goldstein agreed. The show was still in pre-production when Goldstein was injured in the plane crash. Following the crash, the show's producer Cheryl Sirulnick said she assumed the show would not go ahead, but Goldstein insisted on continuing. Eight episodes were filmed; three days before his death, Goldstein tweeted that filming had been completed.|$|E
5|$|Iberville <b>had</b> <b>approached</b> the Spanish in January 1702, {{before the}} war broke out in Europe, recommending that the Apalachee warriors be armed and sent against the English colonists and their allies. The Spanish {{organized}} an expedition under Francisco Romo de Uriza which left Pensacola in August for the trading centers of the Carolina back country. The English colonists had advance warning of the expedition and organized a defense {{at the head of}} the Flint River, where they routed the Spanish-led force, with upwards of 500 Spanish-led Indians killed or captured.|$|E
5|$|In 1912, Brinkley {{left his}} family to try to regain the thread of his education, this time in St. Louis, Missouri. He was unable to pay Bennett Medical College the tuition he owed them, so they refused to forward his {{scholastic}} records {{to any of the}} medical schools that Brinkley <b>had</b> <b>approached.</b> Instead, Brinkley bought a certificate from a shady diploma mill known as the Kansas City Eclectic Medical University and returned home. On February 11, 1913, his daughter Naomi Beryl Brinkley was born. The family of five immediately moved to New York City, and shortly thereafter to Chicago. When Brinkley refused to give up his goal of becoming a doctor, Sally Brinkley left him one final time, taking the three girls home to North Carolina.|$|E
