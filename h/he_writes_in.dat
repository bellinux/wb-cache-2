25|$|Although {{the author}} is not {{identified}} in the transmitted Life of Cyprian, Jerome is clearly writing of this work. The only other information comes from the author's own statements: <b>he</b> <b>writes</b> <b>in</b> part from what he himself witnessed or heard from older people; he accompanied Cyprian into exile at Curubis, modern Korba. From the preface, it appears that Pontius {{was not aware of}} any other account of Cyprian's martyrdom at the time he wrote.|$|E

Ginzberg first arrived in America in 1899, unsure where he belonged or what he should pursue. Almost immediately, he accepted a position at Hebrew Union College and subsequently wrote articles for the Jewish Encyclopedia. Still, he had not found his niche.|$|E
25|$|Orson Scott Card (born August 24, 1951) is an American novelist, critic, public speaker, essayist, and columnist. <b>He</b> <b>writes</b> <b>in</b> several genres but {{is known}} best for science fiction. His novel Ender's Game (1985) and its sequel Speaker for the Dead (1986) both won Hugo and Nebula Awards, making Card the only author to win both science fiction's top U.S. prizes in {{consecutive}} years.

25|$|The {{operation}} {{also made}} topics {{for those in}} the literature world with Valerie Tagwira with her book the Uncertainty of Hope, which vivified mostly the effects of Operation Murambatsvina on the ordinary female citizens of Zimbabwe and other difficulties faced by that time. The other known literature figure who hand penned the happenings of the era is a young poet and script writer, Poseidon Tsautsau who wrote his poem:The Uncaring father, who should care. In his poem it seems like Tsautsau is blasting Mugabe the Zimbabwean father for not caring for his children, by 'cleaning the mess through adding trash' as <b>he</b> <b>writes</b> <b>in</b> his piece.|$|E

He was present and gives detailed reports on many key events. He was a member of Governor Phillip's boat crew and took part in the explorations which led to the selection of Sydney as the site for settlement. He describes encounters with the Aboriginal people, including the spearing of Governor Phillip and the capture of Bennelong and Coleby. His eye witness account of events often provide a very different perspective than the more official reports and journals.|$|E
25|$|He says {{religion}} has always stopped the philosophers and scientists from gaining knowledge because the Christian religion {{is opposed to}} any knowledge that differs from Biblical knowledge. Hedgel is indifferent to what the Bible says. <b>He</b> <b>writes</b> <b>in</b> his Philosophy of Religion If at the present day philosophy be an object of enmity because it occupies itself with religion, this cannot really surprise us {{when we consider the}} general character of the time. Every one who attempts to take to do with the knowledge of God, and by the aid of thought to comprehend His nature, must be prepared to find, that either no attention will be paid to him, or that people will turn against him and combine to oppose him. The more the knowledge of finite things has increased and the increase is so great that the extension of the sciences has become almost boundless, and all regions of knowledge are enlarged to an extent which makes a comprehensive view impossible so much the more has the sphere of the knowledge of God become contracted.|$|E

500|$|Some critics {{claim that}} Balzac surpassed Scott in some respects. In his {{introduction}} to the 1901 edition, poet and critic George Saintsbury writes that the character of Montauran enjoys [...] "a freedom from the flatness which not infrequently characterizes Sir Walter's own good young men." [...] By foregrounding the affair between Montauran and Marie, Balzac indicates passion as the central theme of history. As <b>he</b> <b>writes</b> <b>in</b> the 1842 foreword to La Comédie Humaine: [...] "a passion est toute l'humanité. Sans elle religion, l'histoire, le roman, l'art seraient inutiles." [...] ("assion is all of humanity. Without it religion, history, literature, and art would be useless.") ...|$|E
500|$|One further oddity in his {{writings}} is that {{in one of his}} works, the Commentary on the Seven Catholic Epistles, <b>he</b> <b>writes</b> <b>in</b> a manner that gives the impression he was married. The section in question is the only one in that work that is written in first-person view. Bede says: [...] "Prayers are hindered by the conjugal duty because as often as I perform what is due to my wife I am not able to pray." [...] Another passage, in the Commentary on Luke, also mentions a wife in the first person: [...] "Formerly I possessed a wife in the lustful passion of desire and now I possess her in honourable sanctification and true love of Christ." [...] The historian Benedicta Ward argues that these passages are Bede employing a rhetorical device.|$|E
500|$|Christiane Schönfeld, who {{examines}} {{the connections between}} Feuchtwanger's Jud Süß play and novel and Veit Harlan's propaganda film, writes: [...] "Lion Feuchtwanger [...] considered Harlan’s film an adaptation of his novel [...] "Jud Süß" [...] that perverted and reversed the intentions of his text, as <b>he</b> <b>writes</b> <b>in</b> his open letter to seven Berlin actors after having read {{a review of the}} film in an NSDAP newspaper [...] Even without having seen the film, Lion Feuchtwanger had no doubt that Veit Harlan and his collaborators had expropriated his novel and adapted it to the purposes of Nazi propaganda. The synopsis of the film narrative provided in the review highlighted a perversion of the plot of Feuchtwanger’s text that the author instantly recognised. He identifies {{the focal point of the}} distortion when he refers to the desperate young woman and the sexual abuse she endures. She is indeed a prime example of the Nazis’ ruthless misrepresentation, and her character, her rape, and tragic death prove the Nazis’ deliberate abuse of the Jewish writer’s work." ...|$|E

500|$|As {{part of the}} {{creation}} of each character, Araki wrote down a fictional history for the character, to prevent inconsistencies; while not all information <b>he</b> <b>writes</b> <b>in</b> these are used directly in the manga, it helps him determine how the character should act and react in different situations. Jonathan and Dio, the protagonist and antagonist, were created with the duality of light and shadow in mind, with the intention to have them contrast against each other: Dio was depicted as an embodiment of evil, and Jonathan as [...] "fundamentally virtuous" [...] and just. Araki also made use of black and white in his art to further contrast the two. Jonathan was designed to be a symbol for the story and setting, something Araki would continue doing with later protagonists in the series. Because Araki wanted the series to move on with new characters in the Joestar family, Jonathan was specifically written as [...] "the first Joestar" [...] that would function as a symbol of purity and dignity, and not as a unique character. This limited what Jonathan could do; in retrospect, Araki considered him passive and [...] "a bit boring".|$|E
500|$|In general, Sullivan {{preferred}} {{to write in}} major keys. In the Savoy operas, there are only eleven substantial numbers wholly in a minor key (less than 5% of the musical numbers), and even in his serious works the major prevails. Examples of Sullivan's rare excursions into minor keys include the long E minor melody in the first movement of the Irish Symphony, [...] "Go away, madam" [...] in the Act I finale of Iolanthe (echoing Verdi and Beethoven) and the funeral march in the Act I finale of The Yeomen of the Guard. Sullivan was happy on occasion to use chords traditionally considered technically incorrect. When reproached for using consecutive fifths in Cox and Box, he replied [...] "if 5ths turn up it doesn't matter, {{so long as there}} is no offence to the ear." [...] Hughes comments that harmonic contrast in the Savoy works is enhanced by Sullivan's characteristic modulation between keys, as in [...] "Expressive glances" [...] (Princess Ida), where he smoothly negotiates E major, C sharp minor and C major, or [...] "Then one of us will be a queen" [...] (The Gondoliers), where <b>he</b> <b>writes</b> <b>in</b> F major, D flat major and D minor.|$|E
