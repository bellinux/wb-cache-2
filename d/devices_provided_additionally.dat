50|$|Magnetically {{controlled}} {{shunt reactor}} is the transformer-type <b>device</b> which <b>additionally</b> <b>provides</b> functions of semiconducting key apparatus; this is ensured {{by means of}} reactor magnetic system operation {{in the domain of}} deep saturation. The basing principle allowed optimal employment of existing designs both in transformer production industry, and in the field of power electronics.Magnetic system of MCSR single phase includes two cores with windings, vertical and horizontal yokes. Control windings with opposite connection and power windings with series (accordant) connection are arranged on CST magnetic system cores. MCSR magnetic system cores are free from nonmagnetic gaps, and owing to this effect in case of the reactor connection to the network it will be in no-load condition. Herewith, the value of reactive power consumed from the grid will not exceed 3% of nominal magnitude. To increase reactor load as for reactive power, its operating range should be offset to non-linear area of hysteresis characteristic; and this is achieved for the account of additional biasing of magnetic system. At connection of regulated dc voltage source to the control windings, increase of the bias flux is ensured.|$|R
