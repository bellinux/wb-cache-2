50|$|In {{computer}} graphics, a swap {{chain is}} a series of virtual framebuffers utilized by the graphics card and graphics API for frame rate stabilization and several other functions. The swap chain usually exists in graphics memory, but it can exist in system memory as well. The non-utilization of a swap chain may result in stuttering rendering, but its existence and utilization are required by many graphics APIs. A swap chain with two buffers is a <b>double</b> <b>buffer.</b>|$|E
5000|$|When the {{producer}} can't be paused—it is a keyboard or some hardware that doesn't support flow control—the system typically attempts to temporarily store the data until {{the consumer is}} ready for it, typically using a <b>double</b> <b>buffer</b> or a queue. Often the receiver can empty the buffer before it gets completely full. A producer that continues to produce data faster than it can be consumed, even after the buffer is full, leads to unwanted buffer overflow, packet loss, and network congestion.|$|E

50|$|The SIPO (Serial Input, Parallel Output) block {{typically}} has a {{receive clock}} output, {{a set of}} data output lines and output data latches. The receive clock may have been recovered from the data by the serial clock recovery technique. However, SerDes which do not transmit a clock use reference clock to lock the PLL to the correct Tx frequency, avoiding low harmonic frequencies present in the data stream. The SIPO block then divides the incoming clock down to the parallel rate. Implementations typically have two registers connected as a <b>double</b> <b>buffer.</b> One register is used to clock in the serial stream, {{and the other is}} used to hold the data for the slower, parallel side.|$|E
50|$|Playback of ANIMs {{will usually}} require two buffers, as {{mentioned}} above, and double-buffering between them. The frame {{data from the}} ANIM file is used to modify the hidden frame to the next frame to be shown. When using the XOR mode, the usual run-length-decoding routine can be easily modified to do the exclusive-or operation required. Note that runs of zero bytes, which will be very common, can be ignored, as an exclusive or of any byte value to a byte of zero will not alter the original byte value. The general procedure, for all compression techniques, is to first decode the initial ILBM picture into the hidden buffer and <b>double</b> <b>buffer</b> it into view. Then this picture is copied to the other (now hidden) buffer. At this point each frame is displayed with the same procedure. The next frame is formed in the hidden buffer by applying the DLTA data (or the XOR data from the BODY chunk) and the new frame is double-buffered into view. This process continues {{to the end of}} the file.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Checkpointing is an {{effective}} fault tolerant tech-nique to improve the reliability of large scale parallel comput-ing systems. However, checkpointing causes {{a large number of}} computation nodes to store a huge amount of data into file system simultaneously. It does not only require a huge storage space to store system state, but also brings a tremendous pressure on the communication network and I/O subsystem because a massive demand of accesses are concentrated {{in a short period of}} time. Data compression can reduce the size of checkpoint data to be saved in the file system and to go through the communication network. However, compression induces a huge time overhead especially in large scale parallel systems, which is the main technical barrier of its practical usability. In this paper, we propose a parallel compression checkpointing technique to reduce the time overhead in socket-level het-erogeneous architectures. It integrates a number of parallel processing techniques, including transmitting checkpoint data between CPU, GPU and file system in <b>double</b> <b>buffered</b> pipelines, aggregating file write operations, SIMD parallel compression algorithm running on GPU, etc. The paper also reports an implementation of the technique on the Tianhe- 1 supercom-puter system and the evaluation experiments with the system.

Whatever the cell configuration, {{the best results}} are obtained when a <b>double</b> cathode <b>buffer</b> layer Alq 3 /Ca is used.

On the other hand, it is shown that the organic layer surface morphology is decisive whatever the cell efficiency. While the BSTV layers are homogeneous those of BOTV are not. It follows that, {{in the case of}} classical organic photovoltaic cells, leakage currents limits the performances of the cells using BOTV, and better performances are obtained with BSTV.
