40|$|It {{is known}} that the {{germination}}, germination energy, 1000 -seed weight (TSW) and share of hard seeds alfalfa are tightly connected to the seed size. Influence of alfalfa seed size on qualitative traits is rarely tested. Seed size depends on cultivar genetic inheritance and clima conditions during the vegetation ( [...] .). The aim of the investigation was to determinate the influence of cultivar genetic variability on seed size and other above mentioned traits. Therefore in 2000 and 2001 the seed of 4 cultivars (Vuka, Os-Sz, Os- 90, Stela) was chosen after harvest and separated in 3 fractions by the sieves with different diameter circular holes (1, 50 and 1, 40 mm). TSW was determined for each fraction. Samples in 4 replications were set by standard method to <b>germinate.</b> Germination <b>energy,</b> total germination, number of hard, abnormal and diseased seeds were determined and results were analysed by statistical programming system MSTAT-C. In the two investigated years TSW showed highly significant differences due to cultivars, fractions, years of investigation and cultivar x fraction x year interactions. The largest average TSW had the cultivar Osječka 90 (2. 097 g) and the lowest cultivar Stela (1. 983 g). Average TSW of cultivars was highly significant larger {{in the first year}} of investigation.

40|$|Rapeseed is the world's {{third most}} {{important}} oil plant (the second seminal). It {{is the most}} cultivation and most important oil plant in Czech Republic. Winter rapeseed reaches about 85 % of the harvest area of oilseeds in the country. The desiccation of oilseed crop is sphere of agricultural engineering, which is still worth discussing. The main problems are {{how to use the}} product, what dose and which dates to choose to desiccate. The results of this thesis could help to partially clarify this complex issue. 	The aim of the thesis is to observe the effect of different terms oilseed rape desiccation by glyphosate on yield and seed quality. 	Small-plot experiments to investigate the influence of the term desiccation of winter rapeseed were established in the years 2013 / 2014 and 2014 / 2015 on the lands of the experimental station of the Czech Agricultural University, Faculty of Agronomy Food and Natural Resources at the Červený Újezd. 	In the first experimental year 2013 / 2014 was founded five variants in three replications (including undesiccated control). In the year 2014 / 2015 was founded seven variants in four replicates (including undesiccated controls). In the first experimental year was the first term desiccation 16. 6. 2014, the second year 8. 6. 2015. Subsequent periods of desiccation were a week apart. 	The variety of winter rapeseed used for the experiments was a hybrid variety Rohan. The desiccating agent was used Dominator active substance glyphosate. The dose of 4 l / ha + 200 l H 2 O. 	 For all samples, both experimental, years yield was determined, the weight of a thousand seeds and oiliness. For desiccated variants were carried out pre-harvest analysis for the determination of solids in pods. Further, all harvested samples taken for laboratory germination test (Determination of germination) ISTA according to the methodology. The results of the experiment sprouting were statistically analyzed using ANOVA analysis of variance. Differences between mean values were evaluated by Tukey test, the computer program SAS at a significance level of p = 0. 05. 	Effect of desiccation term influences of winter oilseed rape seed quality in terms of weight and thousands of seeds in terms of oil content. Too early desiccation (46 to 39 days before harvest) HTS reduced by 7 - 17 % and the oil content of 2 - 4 % of the overall average. Oiliness of the observed characters minimum interference term desiccation. Desiccation in the optimum date (17 days before harvest) increased oiliness of 1 - 6 %. 	Influence term desiccation oilseed rape also greatly influences seed yield. Too early desiccation (46 to 39 days before harvest) reduced the yield by 11 - 14 %. Undesiccated control in both years achieved the highest yields, increase yield by 5 - 12 %. Desiccation in the optimum date (17 days before harvest) increased the yield of attempts by 5 - 6 %. 	The term desiccation of winter rapeseed, also significantly affects the vitality of seeds, where very reduces <b>energy</b> <b>germinating</b> seedlings in the first days. The term desiccation, however, does not affect overall seed germination. Too early desiccation (46 to 39 days before harvest) EK 2 decreased by 12 - 40 %, EK 3 decreased by 4 - 24 %, 3 - 4 % EK 4 and extended MGT of 7 - 15 %. In the first experimental year was the most vital option undesiccated control (EK 2 = 50. 4 % = 91. 3 % EK 3, EK 4 = 97. 9 %). In the second experimental year was the most vital seeds of the optimal term desiccation, (Sixth term, 17 days before harvest) = 68. 9 % EK 2, EK 3 = 98. 2 %, EK 4 = 100 %. Seed samples of 2014 / 15 had a higher overall vitality of seeds, than samples from 2013 / 14, the overall vitality is probably worse given year old and transsilaged seed. 	The results of the two-year experiment that term desiccation affects the quality of seeds, the yield of seeds and vitality of seeds. Pre-analysis was determined optimum solids content in siliques desiccated samples to values of 40 - 50 %. Like most technology seems to desiccation in the optimum date (17 days before harvest) and agro technology without desiccated vegetation. As the least appropriate technology seems very early desiccation (46 to 30 days before harvest). 	The first scientific hypothesis: Premature desiccation reduces seed yield, oil content and HTS. Yes, the hypothesis was confirmed. 	The second scientific hypothesis: Desiccation made in the correct term do not affect the quality of the seeds (oiliness and HTS). Yes, the hypothesis was confirmed...|$|R

40|$|Purpose. To {{study the}} {{influence}} of fractional composition of seed material on productive properties of spring rape seeds of the ‘Magnat’ variety and ‘MVM’ (‘Gladiator’) variety sample. Methods. Field investigations, laboratory tests, statistical analysis. Results. During 2013 – 2014, {{the influence of}} sown seeds of different size fractions (up to 2, 5  g; 2, 6 – 3, 5  g; 3, 6  g and more) on the indices of productivity of spring rape varie­ties was studied. It was found {{that over the years}} of study field germination of sown fractions of seeds in ‘Magnat’ variety averaged 83. 5 %, in ‘MSM’ variety sample – 86. 7 %. During the periods of seedling emergence and harvesting, the density of spring rape crops varied depending on relevant fraction of sown seeds. In the ‘Magnat’ variety, photosynthetic potential of crops ranged from 1. 1 to 1. 3 million m 2 /ha, in ‘MSM’ variety sample – from 1. 2 to 1. 6 million m 2 /ha. Depending on the seed fractions applied, ‘Magnat’ variety crops during the gro­wing season accumulated organic biomass from 2. 05 to 2. 36 g/m 2 per day, ‘MSM’ sample variety – from 1. 83 to 2. 10 g/m 2 per day. Conclusions. It was established that different fractions of spring rape seeds sown in the Northern Forest-Steppe zone of Ukraine affected the indices of <b>germinating</b> <b>energy</b> and laboratory germination, crop density formation, leaf surface area and intensity of photosynthesis process (crop photosynthetic potential, net photosynthesis performance). The highest indices of productivity and yield in the ‘Magnat’ variety was ensured by large-seeded fraction (3, 6 g and more), in the ‘MVM’ (‘Gladia­tor’) sample variety – by small-seeded fraction (up to 2, 5 g) ...|$|E
40|$|Cereals are {{the most}} common group of grown crops in the world. Winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is the most grown cereal in the Czech republic, {{represented}} almost in all growing areas and covers more than a quarter of arable land and over half of grain surfaces. This bachelors's thesis,,Factors affecting seeds development and maturation" is a compilation based on scientific literature concerning environmental influcences on the development, maturation and germination of seeds. The thesis also describes the basic physiological processes such as germination and dormancy and knowledges about seed vitality and effects of phytohormones. The main point of this thesis was to determine whether the arrangement of grains per spikelet affect their germination and other seed parametres. The thesis practically deals mainly with the seed germination in 30 ml and 20 ml of water. The experiment was created with the variety of winter wheat named Bohemia and new genotype of winter wheat called MRS or multi row spike. Seeds were gained by manual scaling out of the spikes and categorized into fractions, according to the position of seed in a spikelet (i. e. first, seconad, third, fourth or fifth). Seed tests were performed on the folded filter paper Hahnemühle in 30 ml and 20 ml of water. Germination took place at constatnt temperature of 20 °C in air - conditionted box. Measured values were germination percent, mean time of germination and <b>germinating</b> <b>energy.</b> Gained results were statistically evaluated. Seeds were also analyse with the OmegAnalyzer G, where the point was to determine wheter the position of the grain spikelet affects the content of the seed (nitrogen, gluten, strach). Seed parametres were different not only depending on the position of the seed on the grain spikelet, but also on the variety and amount of water. Comparing the different categories of grains among themselves differences were found. Both in optimal and stress moisture conditions were registred the best results in the Bohemia breed. MRS wheat genotype fared significantly worse in both conditions. The highest average seed germination in 30 ml of water showed third grains of Bohemia breed, which also was the only one able to achieve 100 % germination. First grains had the lowest average germination (94 %). MRS in 30 ml of water reached lower values than Bohemia breed. The highest average germination reached the first grains (94 %), but neither one grain fraction MRS did not reach 100 % germination. The worst levels of seed germination reached second and fifth grains (93 %). In 20 ml of water had Bohemia breed lower average germination than average germination in 30 ml of water, even so it still achieved relatively high values. The highest average germination achieved first grains with 98 % and the second grains showed the worst germination value (95 %). The fastest average germinating had third and fourth grains, second grains had the slowest germination. In 20 ml of water fifth grains germinated the fastest, and also reached the highest germination (95 %). Grains of the first fraction were the worst and ended with very low germination (88 %). Fifth grains had the highest germination energy (90 %) fifth day in 20 ml of water. The lowest values, only 1 % were reached by the first and second grains third day. The fourth and fifth grains showed higher values of germination energy under stressful conditions than in optimal. The first and second grains conversly germinated faster in optimal conditions. In experimental part of this bachelors's thesis was found that the position of the grains, its weight and size togehter with the different amout of water affects germination. Next the influence of the position of the grains on the grains content wasn't shown...|$|E
