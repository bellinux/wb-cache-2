25|$|Watchmen, as {{guardians of}} {{the peace of the}} streets, were {{supposed}} to deal within the confines of their beat with drunkenness, soliciting, and petty tumults, and detaining suspicious characters. However, they were often willing to concede privileges to certain prostitutes, consequently provoking parishioners' complains about their inability to enforce the law. Indeed, even the prostitutes taken up by the watch were frequently released after a few hours in the watch house without seeing any magistrate. The circumstances changed when theft or some other kind of crimes were committed. Public opinion, and Moreton too, firmly believed that these women needed to be restrained in their liberties not only for their vices and immoralities but because they represented a real threat to common living. Unfortunately, most of the times this was <b>easier</b> <b>said</b> <b>than</b> <b>done.</b> Watchmen had the power to apprehend criminals within the boundaries of their parish, and they were liable to be reprimanded for leaving their beats. So they might not have been so inclined to chase a woman who crossed into another parish in order to avoid being taken.|$|E
500|$|The {{past decade}} has shown that {{harnessing}} consumer power to effect positive environmental change is far <b>easier</b> <b>said</b> <b>than</b> <b>done.</b> The so-called [...] "green consumer" [...] movements in the U.S. and other countries have struggled to reach critical mass and {{to remain in the}} forefront of shoppers' minds. While public opinion polls taken since the late 1980s have shown consistently that a significant percentage of consumers in the U.S. and elsewhere profess a strong willingness to favor environmentally conscious products and companies, consumers' efforts to do so in real life have remained sketchy at best.|$|E

Therefore, as time goes by, people develop and wanting to improve the state and quality of their house {{so that they can}} live their lives towards better meaning parallel to their up growth. But, <b>easy</b> <b>said</b> <b>than</b> <b>done,</b> renovation is some work that needs thinking about. In fact, most of houses which are dwelled by modern Malay people in Malaysia nowadays did not evolve in synchronize to the Malay people’s needs. We could see lots of houses being renovated or extended by owners after the houses get dwelled in especially of those terrace housing in Malaysia. The renovations scenario upon these terrace houses is indeed one of the serious housing issues and problems in Malaysia. This writing thus will focus its investigation towards the phenomena of renovations upon selected double-storey terrace housing within Klang Valley, Malaysia. Investigations will be carried out by questionnaires, statistic analysis of findings from site visits, and interviews with the owners of the houses. Among those things that will be investigated are about the type of renovations that have been done and the factors which influence the act of renovating. Results show that the type of renovations varies, be it on a major or minor scale. Those renovations of houses involving numerous parts or sections of houses such as the kitchen, rooms, bathrooms, and so fort...|$|R
5000|$|According to the {{environment}} act,the Government shall establish a Department, which shall be called the Department of Environment {{whose job is to}} identify the zones in the country,which are environmentally in critical condition. Being the least livable country {{in the world and the}} capital of the country, Dhaka obviously is on the top of their list. But it is <b>easier</b> <b>said</b> <b>than</b> to be <b>done.</b> One of the laws in the act includes, [...] "Restriction regarding vehicles emitting smoke injurious to health". This law is nearly impossible to establish since Dhaka alone is the home to 7 million people given the fact that the area of the city is only 1463.60 km2. Not to mention most of the people living here are in the working class of the society. Most of them cannot even feed their family properly let alone buy a car for themselves, thus mostly rely on public transportation. Due to huge amount of debt to foreign countries, the Governmentcan can only afford to give a little attention towards the public transportation system, which resulted in decades old buses emitting thick black smoke which results in further degradation of {{the environment}}.|$|R
2500|$|Sandé {{said the}} key to a {{successful}} song was simplicity. The singer pointed out that she could never have used songs which she wrote when she was 17 because she made the songs too complicated; saying there were too many words and parts to the track. She stated that the key feature to a classical song was keeping the [...] "melody simple" [...] and having big [...] "lyric effective", which was much <b>easier</b> <b>said</b> <b>than</b> actually <b>done.</b> Sandé <b>said</b> that another important key to a good song when songwriting is using [...] "honesty" [...] and [...] "raw emotion" [...] as the best way to write. She said that if she attempts to write something which is [...] "too smart" [...] the creative process will not work for her. [...] "Kill the Boy" [...] {{was one of the first}} ideas that came to Sandé's head. If she has to work on a song longer than a day, she will not go back to it because it won't work. She went on to say if it was to work, the idea for the song would be almost instant. Sandé said that all her songs are about world peace and political issues. She is the same person since gaining the record deal with Virgin Records, and they are the same songs which she planned for the album before gaining the deal. She said that a lot of people didn't see the potential in the songs or in her, but once she gained the record deal, she gained more confidence.

During the first week of July, 1942, WDAF flew 5,458 sorties against Axis forces, using the innovative tactic of leap-frogging airfields, and Erwin Rommel informed Berlin on 4 July that he was abandoning his El Alamein offensive to concentrate on defence. [...] Later, the tactic of bombing known as Tedder's carpet was developed.|$|E
40|$|Online banking {{systems have}} become more common and widely used in daily life, {{bringing}} huge changes in modern banking transaction activities and giving us a greater opportunity to access the banking system anytime and anywhere. At the same time, however, {{one of the key}} challenges that still remain is to fully resolve the security concerns associated with the online banking system. Many clients feel that online banking is not secure enough, and to increase its security levels, many banks simply add more identity-checking steps or put on more security measures to some extent to give users the impression of a secure online banking system. However, this is <b>easier</b> to be <b>said</b> <b>than</b> <b>done,</b> because we believe that more identity-checking steps could compromise the usability of the online banking system, which is an inevitable feature in design of usable and useful online banking systems. Banks can simply enhance their security level with more sophisticated technologies, but this does not seem to guarantee the online banking system is in line with its key usability concern. Therefore, the research question raised in this thesis is to establish the relationships between usability, security and trustworthiness in the online banking system. To demonstrate these relationships, three experiments were carried out using the simulation of an online banking logon procedure to provide a similar online banking experience. Post questionnaires were used to measure the three concepts, i. e. usability, security and trustworthiness. The resulting analyses revealed that simply adding more identity-checking steps in the online banking system did not improve the customers? perceived security and trustworthiness, nor the biometric security technique (i. e., fingerprints) did enhance the subjective ratings on the perceived security and trustworthiness. This showed that the systems designer needs to be aware that the customer?s perception of the online banking system {{is not the same as}} that conceived from a technical standpoint...|$|R

2500|$|By a {{handbook}} or a portolan chart, a navigator {{could see}} immediately that, for example, Pisa lay 85 miles southeast ("Scirocco" [...] {{in the traditional}} compass rose nomenclature) of Genoa, and so a ship that set out from Genoa to Pisa would simply maintain that bearing for that distance. However, most sailing courses were not nearly that neat. [...] A mariner wishing to sail from Majorca to Naples could tell the latter was due east ("Levante") by some 600 miles – but the island of Sardinia lies in the way, therefore the ship's bearing must be changed along the route. [...] This is <b>easier</b> <b>said</b> <b>than</b> <b>done,</b> as geographical coordinates did not exist during this era. [...] The only way to determine the exact position of the ship at sea would be to calculate via past bearing and distance travelled.|$|E

2500|$|In {{a review}} from Rickey.org, Nick Roman said, [...] "...while I can’t say I LOVED “The Bear King”, I {{can at least}} say I {{respected}} what it was going for: It’s clear that Merida (Amy Manson) {{is going to be}} important to the endgame of this King Arthur (Liam Garrigan) storyline, so we needed to establish why and to what degree. And this is <b>easier</b> <b>said</b> <b>than</b> <b>done,</b> considering Merida is a character who, up until this point, hasn’t even been particularly likable. I like Amy Manson in the role of Merida, but she hasn’t always been given the best material, often coming across as unnecessarily combative and standoffish. And so this episode was necessary to soften the character and illustrate why she’s as hard-nosed as she is. This episode also gave Manson the opportunity to really shine, while also bringing back some OUAT alums I didn’t realize I’d missed, such as Mulan (Jamie Chung) and Ruby (Meghan Ory). We also get to meet more of Merida’s family, such as Queen Elinor (Caroline Morahan), and — through flashbacks — the late King Fergus (Glenn Keogh). It’s a story that details how Merida is shaped into a warrior and a ruler who inspires leadership in her people, and from that standpoint, it’s one of the season’s more effective character studies." ...|$|E

2500|$|Leaving Company A {{behind to}} secure the MACV Compound, the Marine {{battalion}} commander took Company G, reinforced by the three M-48 tanks from the 3rd Tank Battalion and a few ARVN light M-24 tanks from the 7th Armored Squadron, and attempted to cross the Trường Tiền Bridge, the main bridge over the Perfume River. Gravel left the armor behind on the southern bank to provide direct fire support. As he remembered, the American M-48s were too heavy for the bridge and the ARVN tankers [...] "refused to go." [...] As the Marine infantry started across, an enemy machine gun {{on the other end}} of the bridge opened up, killing and wounding several Marines. One Marine, Lance Corporal Lester A. Tully, later awarded the Silver Star for his action, ran forward, threw a grenade, and silenced the gun. Two platoons successfully made their way to the other side. They turned left and immediately came under automatic weapons and recoilless rifle fire from the Citadel wall. The Marines decided to withdraw. This was <b>easier</b> <b>said</b> <b>than</b> <b>done.</b> The enemy was well dug-in and firing from virtually every building in Huế city north of the river. The number of wounded was rising, the Marines commandeered some abandoned Vietnamese civilian vehicles and used them as makeshift ambulances to carry out the wounded. Among the casualties on the bridge was Major Walter M. Murphy, the 1st Battalion S-3 or operations officer, who later died of his wounds.|$|E
2500|$|Sender (1999), Ingebretsen (1999), and Bhat et al. (1998) {{point out}} that there are {{advertisers}} who do use gay and lesbian models to promote directly to the gay and lesbian community, but wish to remain innocuous to heterosexuals. Gay and lesbian advertisers do not actively pursue national recognition (which is essentially to a much larger demographic of heterosexuals) mostly due to fear and criticism. However, some very notable corporations, such as [...] "Sony, Toyota, Microsoft, Levi's, Banana Republic, American Express, Miller, and Absolut now commonly use gay media. Some firms (IKEA, Calvin Klein, Benetton) have gone further into using homosexual imagery in advertising to [...] more general audiences" [...] (Bhat et al., 1998, p.10). The gay and lesbian advertisers should be creating ads that appeal to all sexual preferences, even though this may be <b>easier</b> <b>said</b> <b>than</b> <b>done.</b> The gay and lesbian advertisers must go beyond their select audience for ad campaigns targeting gays and lesbians to look at the inclusion, instead of exclusion, of heterosexuals. Sender (1999) suggests that on the heterosexual side, [...] "images which are arousing for lesbians, but which may not have originally been intended for , may actually offer greater pleasure than those which are implicitly coded to suggest a lesbian reading" [...] (p.191). If such is the case for [...] "hot lesbian" [...] advertisements, then there is nothing to say that actual lesbian advertisements might find heterosexuals left wanting something as well from them.|$|E
