40|$|Optical microbunches with a spacing of 800 nm {{have been}} {{produced}} for laser acceleration research. The microbunches are produced using a inverse Free-Electron-Laser (IFEL) followed by a dispersive chicane. The microbunched electron beam is characterized by coherent optical transition radiation (COTR) with good agreement to the analytic theory <b>for</b> <b>bunch</b> <b>formation.</b> In a second experiment the bunches are accelerated in a second stage to achieve {{for the first time}} direct net acceleration of electrons traveling in a vacuum with visible light. This dissertation presents the theory of microbunch formation and characterization of the microbunches. It also presents the design of the experimental hardware from magnetostatic and particle tracking simulations, to fabrication and measurement of the undulator and chicane magnets. Finally, the dissertation discusses three experiments aimed at demonstrating the IFEL interaction, microbunch production, and the net acceleration of the microbunched beam. At the close of the dissertation, a separate but related research effort on the tight focusing of electrons for coupling into optical scale, Photonic Bandgap, structures is presented.

40|$|During {{the last}} three years a high power rf {{generator}} design capable of providing several MW rf power at frequencies between 200 and 300 MHz has been investigated. Instead of using conventional techniques <b>for</b> <b>bunch</b> <b>formation</b> in electron beam based generators like grids or longitudinal velocity modulation it is based on an innovative scheme which was first proposed in 1986 [1]. It allows to directly drive the resonant mode of an H-type cavity by the electron beam resulting in a much simplified rf driver system. The basic concept is to use a continuous electron beam produced by a thermionic gun. The time structure of the electron beam is achieved by a rf driven chopping system using the E×B drift which deflects about 80 % of the beam to a suppressed collector where {{the main part of the}} beam energy is recovered. The remaining bunched electron beam is injected into the IH tank where the beam energy will drive the IH 110 mode. To increase the efficiency of the beam deflection a second deflector stage working on dc potential may be added [2]. The setup of the total system is shown in Fig. 1. To prove the feasibility of the proposed rf generator the individual components were simulated with the three dimensional particle in cell code TS 3 which is part of the simulation package MAFIA. It is capable of solving Maxwell´s equations including the self fields of charged particles in motion. Starting with the high perveance electron gun the simulations resulted in a reasonable geometry which delivers a 100 A, 100 keV beam with a radius of 5 mm which is injected into a confining magnetic field with a flux density of 100 mT. - 100 k...|$|R

Elements with nuclei three and more times heavier than the nucleus of the target main element are detected in the products. The isotopic composition of the produced elements significantly differs from the natural one.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Defoliation {{caused by}} Black Sigatoka in yield {{and quality of}} banana 'Nanica' was stimulated in this study. A {{completely}} randomized 2 x 8 factorial design with six repetitions was used, in which period of <b>bunch</b> <b>formation</b> and number of leaves at flowering were established as factors.

Six to to 13 leaves remained per plant by removing those with more than 50 % of blade with injury or senescence. More appropriate climatic conditions before and after flowering, promoted greater mass accumulation in the bunch in Period 2. The increased number of leaves at flowering increased {{the length of the}} fruit and the mass of 4 th hand, as well as the bunch mass and postharvest period.

In the initial scenario a single intense h= 1 bunch is formed in the Accumulator/Debuncher, with slow extraction providing the required spill.

The h= 4 variant has several advantages and a few disadvantages, and can reduce peak beam intensities, and therefore improve space charge limits.

40|$|ABSTRACT With {{the advent}} of black sigatoka in {{commercial}} banana crops in the “Vale do Ribeira” region, state of São Paulo, the monitoring the severity and chemical control of the disease in susceptible varieties have become more frequent {{in order to avoid}} leaf loss. This study simulated the effect of defoliation caused by the disease on the yield and quality of ‘Prata Comum’ banana fruits, depending on the formation period and fruit position in the bunch. The experimental design was completely randomized in a 2 x 11 factorial scheme (period of <b>bunch</b> <b>formation</b> x number of leaves at flowering), 6 - 16 leaves at flowering in two periods of <b>bunch</b> <b>formation</b> with six replicates. In Period 1, flowering occurred at 04 / 15 / 13 and in Period 2 at 01 / 07 / 14, although in Period 1, bunch mass was higher and in Period 2, higher average maximum and minimum daily temperatures, precipitation and radiation were observed. Regardless of formation period, the number of leaves at flowering affected bunch mass, which ranged from 18 to 23 kg plant- 1.

40|$|A {{major problem}} {{in the design of}} high {{intensity}} proton linacs is how to avoid particle losses. Losses cause acti-vation of accelerator components and make unconstrained maintenance difficult. In a linac, losses occur radially due to the formation of beam halo.
