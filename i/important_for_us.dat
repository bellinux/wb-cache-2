5|$|What is most <b>important</b> <b>for</b> <b>us,</b> {{out of the}} heathen fancy of a {{kidnapping}} man of the moon, which, apart from Scandinavia, was doubtless in vogue all over Teutondom, if not farther, there has evolved itself since a Christian adaptation. They say {{the man in the}} moon is a wood-stealer, who during church time on the holy sabbath committed a trespass in the wood, and was then transported to the moon as a punishment; there he may be seen with the axe on his back and the bundle of brushwood (dornwelle) in his hand. Plainly enough the water-pole of the heathen story has been transformed into the axe's shaft, and the carried pail into the thornbrush; the general idea of theft was retained, but special stress laid on the keeping of the christian holiday; the man suffers punishment not so much for cutting firewood, as because he did it on Sunday.|$|E

We do not need pity, nor {{do we need to}} be reminded we are vulnerable. We must be treated as equals – and communication is the way this can be brought about." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{show was}} {{controversial}} from its beginning. The rebellious lead character at the time, Bart, frequently received no punishment for his misbehavior, which led some parents and conservatives to characterize {{him as a}} poor role model for children. Several US public schools banned The Simpsons merchandise and T-shirts, such as one featuring Bart and the caption [...] "Underachiever ('And proud of it, man!')". In the season two opening episode [...] "Bart Gets an F", Bart fails four consecutive history exams and the school psychiatrist recommends that Bart repeat the fourth grade. Several critics thought that the episode [...] "Bart Gets an F" [...] {{was a response to}} these controversies. However, Brooks denied that it was a response and added, [...] "we're mindful of it. I do think it's <b>important</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> that Bart does badly in school. There are students like that. Besides, I'm very wary of television where everybody {{is supposed to be a}} role model. You don't run across that many role models in real life. Why should television be full of them?" ...|$|E

500|$|A Channel Seven {{spokeswoman}} {{revealed that}} the network received fewer than 30 telephone calls nationally after screening the [...] "lesbian kiss" [...] episode of the show. The calls were evenly split between those supporting the broadcast of the kiss, and those raising concerns. The show's series producer Cameron Welsh and Anderson both spoke out in defence of the storyline. Welsh said, [...] "The idea of this show {{has always been that}} we hold a mirror to society – and when society changes, we change with it. What's ahead in Home and Away is right not only for the series, but also for the times we are living in". Anderson said that she felt it was the right time to tell this story and added, [...] "It's really <b>important</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> to reflect society, and this storyline is what is going on for many people in real life". She also said that she did not think the plot would be so shocking, but was glad the show was exploring a gay relationship.|$|E
500|$|Henry {{scored two}} late goals in Arsenal’s victory over Birmingham City on 4 December 2004. Wenger {{replaced}} Lehmann in goal with Almunia, {{who made his}} league debut. Arsenal then faced league leaders Chelsea at Highbury; the match was billed as [...] "Judgement Day" [...] by Sky Sports. With Vieira suspended and Gilberto and Edu injured, Wenger picked Flamini to partner Fabregas in midfield. The first chance of the match went to Henry, who scored inside 75 seconds. John Terry levelled the score, but Henry restored Arsenal’s lead from a contentious free-kick – Graham Poll allowed the striker to take it quickly without warning the Chelsea players. Eiður Guðjohnsen equalised {{early in the second}} half for Chelsea, and late on Henry missed a chance to score a hat-trick. There were no further goals and the match ended 2–2, meaning Chelsea remained five points clear of Arsenal. Wenger said he was disappointed in the manner his team conceded to Chelsea – from two set pieces, but added, [...] "I thought we did really well, and it was <b>important</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> {{to come back to the}} level we want to be at." ...|$|E

[...] "Wikipedia needs people to edit..." [...] and [...] "pseudoscience" [...] must be well substantiated before it can be added to an article. Skeptics also have edits removed when not well cited.

2500|$|A {{spectrum}} approach generally overlays or extends a categorical approach, {{which today}} is most {{associated with the}} Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) and [...] (ICD). In these diagnostic guides, disorders are considered present {{if there is a}} certain combination and number of symptoms.

The categories are also polythetic, because a constellation of symptoms is laid out and different patterns of them can qualify for the same diagnosis.

Before the final, Heynckes said, [...] "Tymoshchuk is a great team player. He's really <b>important</b> <b>for</b> <b>us,</b> and in situation, when three players are disqualified, his experience and ability to play in different positions is really useful for us." [...] Because Tymoshchuk played a bigger role under Heynckes than under Van Gaal, he became {{an important part of the}} team. Goalkeeper Manuel Neuer said of Tymoshchuk, [...] "For me the main job – not to let goals in. As a result, I love partners who have the same job. Anatoliy – is quite an aggressive footballer, but it's a smart aggression.
