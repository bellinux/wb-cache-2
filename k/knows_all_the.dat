5|$|At {{the same}} time, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) is {{informed}} by Don Geiss's (Rip Torn) estate lawyer Thomas (Burke Moses) {{that he is in}} Don Geiss's will. Jack is excited at the idea of owning a piece of Geiss's legacy as Jack considered Geiss his mentor. At the will reading, Jack inherits Geiss's beloved pet peacock named Argus. When Argus begins acting peculiar, Jack enlists the help of NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer). Kenneth—who <b>knows</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> peafowl calls—tells Jack that Argus muttered senpai and kōhai—master and pupil—nicknames that Geiss and Jack had for each other (a ruse conceived by Liz, who knew of the nicknames). Immediately, Jack is convinced that Geiss's soul has inhabited Argus, prompting Jack to release his grief to Argus and finally accepting Geiss's death.|$|E

[...] He also compared Carlsen to Boris Spassky in his prime, and stated that [...] "Magnus can literally do almost everything."

500|$|Pitt had {{the lead}} role in 1998's fantasy romance film Meet Joe Black. He portrayed a {{personification}} of death inhabiting {{the body of a}} young man to learn {{what it is like to}} be human. The film received mixed reviews, and many were critical of Pitt's performance. According to Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle, Pitt was unable to [...] "make an audience believe that he <b>knows</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> mysteries of death and eternity." [...] Roger Ebert stated [...] "Pitt is a fine actor, but this performance is a miscalculation." ...|$|E

[...] This, however, did not occupy all his efforts: He {{was still trying to}} coax Anna Maria Franziska to Florence, where he believed her caprices would cease.

500|$|The band wasn't {{without a}} guitarist for very long. In October 1988, Kiedis and Flea found a {{replacement}} for McKnight in teenage guitarist, John Frusciante. Flea had originally directed Frusciante to audition for the band Thelonious Monster. An avid Red Hot Chili Peppers fan, Frusciante was, according to Flea, [...] "a really talented and knowledgeable musician. He [...] <b>knows</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> shit I don't know. I basically know nothing about music theory and he's studied it to death, inside and out. He's a very disciplined musician—all he cares about are his guitar and his cigarettes." [...] Frusciante was also not very familiar with the funk genre: [...] "I wasn't really a funk player before I joined the band. I learned everything I needed to know about how to sound good with Flea by studying Hillel [...] playing and I just took it sideways from there." ...|$|E

500|$|The villain in the story, Mad Wayne, {{had been}} dealt a bad hand in life. Because of his situation, he acts on his bad impulses. Carter elaborated, [...] "Is it fate that Wayne is about, the character, {{this is what}} I was {{interested}} in exploring here. As we'll see with the introduction {{in a moment of}} a character who throws all of this into question – God – we're going to see what his place is in all of this, or at least explore what Burt Reynolds, playing God here, {{has to do with the}} character Wayne." [...] The main idea behind the episode, was that God <b>knows</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> numbers, because they are his numbers and he is laying them down and is in [...] "charge of the big game". Being that God is trying to show us the game, as it was a [...] "game" [...] to be [...] "won or lost", and Wayne has lost this game.|$|E
2500|$|As in Mahāyāna traditions, the Mahāsāṃghikas {{held the}} {{doctrine}} of the existence of many contemporaneous buddhas throughout the ten directions. In the Mahāsāṃghika Lokānuvartana Sūtra, it is stated, [...] "The Buddha <b>knows</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> dharmas of the countless buddhas of the ten directions." [...] It is also stated, [...] "All buddhas have one body, the body of the Dharma." [...] The concept of many bodhisattvas simultaneously working toward buddhahood is also found among the Mahāsāṃghika tradition, and further evidence of this is given in the Samayabhedoparacanacakra, which describes the doctrines of the Mahāsāṃghikas.|$|E

[...] However, he cannot {{get her out of}} his mind, and when Phyllis shows up at his apartment, he cannot resist her any longer.

2500|$|Maimonides {{acknowledged}} {{that one might}} ask: Since God knows everything that will occur before it comes to pass, does God not know whether a person will be righteous or wicked? And if God knows that a person will be righteous, it would appear impossible for that person not to be righteous. However, if one would say that despite God's knowledge that the person would be righteous {{it is possible for}} the person to be wicked, then God's knowledge would be incomplete. Maimonides taught that just as it is beyond human potential to comprehend God's essential nature, as [...] says, [...] "No man will perceive Me and live," [...] so, too, it is beyond human potential to comprehend God's knowledge. This was what Isaiah intended when [...] says, [...] "For My thoughts are not your thoughts, nor your ways, My ways." [...] Accordingly, {{we do not have the}} potential to conceive how God <b>knows</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> creations and their deeds. But Maimonides said that it is without doubt that people's actions are in their own hands and God does not decree them. Consequently, the prophets taught that people are judged according to their deeds.|$|E
2500|$|Shortly after McKnight's firing, Peligro {{introduced}} Kiedis and Flea {{to a young}} teenage guitarist named John Frusciante. Kiedis {{actually had}} met Frusciante a year earlier outside {{of one of the}} band's shows. Frusciante was originally directed to audition for the band Thelonious Monster, but Kiedis said that he knew right away that Frusciante would be in his band. An avid Red Hot Chili Peppers fan, Frusciante was, according to Flea, [...] "a really talented and knowledgeable musician. He [...] <b>knows</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> shit I don't know. I basically know nothing about music theory and he's studied it to death, inside and out. He's a very disciplined musician—all he cares about are his guitar and his cigarettes." [...] Frusciante performed his first show with the band on September 17, 1988. The new lineup immediately began writing music for the next album and went on a short tour dubbed the Turd Town Tour, although in November, Kiedis and Flea felt the need to fire drummer Peligro due to his own drug and alcohol problems. Much like McKnight, Peligro did not take the news well. Flea stayed in bed for days after making the decision. Years later, Kiedis said firing Peligro was one of the toughest things the band ever had to do, although Kiedis became a major part of Peligro's road to sobriety, which began right after he was fired.|$|E
