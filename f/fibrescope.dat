2500|$|In 1953, Dutch {{scientist}} Bram van Heel first demonstrated {{image transmission}} through bundles of optical fibers with a transparent cladding. That same year, Harold Hopkins and Narinder Singh Kapany at Imperial College in London {{succeeded in making}} image-transmitting bundles with over 10,000 fibers, and subsequently achieved image transmission through a 75cm long bundle which combined several thousand fibers. Their article titled [...] "A flexible <b>fibrescope,</b> using static scanning" [...] {{was published in the}} journal Nature in 1954. The first practical fiber optic semi-flexible gastroscope was patented by Basil Hirschowitz, C. Wilbur Peters, and Lawrence E. Curtiss, researchers at the University of Michigan, in 1956. In the process of developing the gastroscope, Curtiss produced the first glass-clad fibers; previous optical fibers had relied on air or impractical oils and waxes as the low-index cladding material. A variety of other image transmission applications soon followed.|$|E

A total of 75 anaesthetists took part in this randomised crossover non-inferiority study. We recorded the time to task completion, tip surface collision count and participants’ impression of ease of use. For the Ambu aScope and Olympus <b>fibrescope,</b> the mean (SD) first attempt time to task completion was 63 (31) s and 53 (23) s, respectively (95 % CI of the difference 3 – 17 s), p = 0. 008. This rejected the null hypothesis of a difference of > 30 s.

30|$|The main {{strengths}} {{of our study}} are that we considered direct medical costs and that we performed sensitivity analysis to assess the robustness of the results. The main limitation is {{that we did not}} assess the effectiveness of the single-use scopes and that the choice of <b>fibrescopes</b> was appreciated by operators. A review of the literature indicates that {{further research is needed to}} assess the effectiveness of disposable scopes in daily practice [6 – 9, 16]. It is also important to measure bronchoscope failure rates and the medical consequences of failure on effectiveness and direct medical costs. We considered the limitation noted by Tvede et al. [12] in their measurement of the break-even point regarding the actual need for the device. However, we did not consider opportunity costs associated with decontamination by auxiliary nurses and automatic annual microbiological samples. Indeed, time spent for decontamination procedures can be reassigned to patient care. The costs were considered with manual decontamination procedures, but they could be determined equally in case of mechanical centralized decontamination procedures. Another limitation was that BAL was not performed with single-use fiberscope, because the two first generation have not operator channel and then use of them was not validated by the pharmacy for BAL.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Cavitating {{flows in}} the orifice of a poppet valve and a ball valve were {{investigated}} using an RNG k– 1 turbulence model and a multi-phase flow cavitation model. The cavitation region, air volume fraction distribution, velocity distribution, and pressure distribution were obtained. Experimental flow visualization {{was conducted to}} catch cavitation images near the orifice of the poppet valve and the ball valve from two perpendicular directions, using a pair of industrial <b>fibrescopes</b> and high-speed video cameras-integrated visualization system. Besides, the vibrations {{of the valve body}} and the poppet induced by the cavitating flow are detected using a vortex displacement transducer, a laser displacement meter, and a digital strain device. The cavitation inception location and the cavitation cloud shape from both exper-iment and numerical simulations are in a good agreement qualitatively. Furthermore, the effects of outlet area, inlet velocity, and outlet pressure on cavitation were numerically investigated. The reduction of the outlet area by around 50 per cent is effective in reducing the cavitation near the orifice of the valve and suppressing the generation of cavitation. The cavitation region and the air volume fraction in the poppet valve increase greatly with an increased inlet velocity by 69 per cent on a certain condition. However, the increase in the outlet pressure can effectively suppress the cavitation inception in the poppet valve...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Airway {{management}} is a core stone and remains a challenge of every anesthetist. Visual control may facilitate tracheal intubation. Rigid video-laryngoscopes are emerging among the devices suggested as alternatives to direct laryngoscopy. Among the many alternative devices to choose for tracheal intubation, semi-rigid <b>fibrescopes</b> and lighted stylets can alternate rigid laryngoscopy in endotracheal intubation. Aim of the work: The {{aim of the}} study was to clarify the efficacy and hemodynamic responses associated with tracheal intubation using trachlight technique (blind object) compared to SensaScope technique in patients subjected to elective surgery. Patients and methods: Thirty patients were randomly allocated to either the trachlight (TL) or SensaScope (SS) group, (15 patients in each group). All endotracheal intubations were performed after induction of general anesthesia. Evaluation of technique, performance, duration of intubation, number of attempts at intubation, success rate of intubation with each device, hemodynamic changes [heart rate (HR), mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) ] and oxygen saturation (SpO 2) were recorded. Results: The duration of the intubation procedures was shorter in the SS group (64. 86  ±  54. 166  s) than in the TL group (68. 53  ±  50. 89  s) but without statistical significance, while no significant difference in the numbers of intubation attempts between the two groups.

40|$|We {{studied the}} success rates for {{tracheal}} intubation in 64 healthy patients during simulated grade III laryngoscopy after induction of anaesthesia, using either the single-use bougie or oral flexible intubating <b>fibrescope,</b> both {{in conjunction with}} conventional Macintosh laryngoscopy. Patients were randomly allocated to either simulated grade IIIa or grade IIIb laryngoscopy, and also {{to one of the}} two study devices. Success rates for tracheal intubation (primary outcome measure) and times taken to achieve intubation (secondary outcome measure) were recorded. For the simulated grade IIIa laryngoscopy group, the fibreoptic scope was more successful than the bougie (16 / 16 successful intubations vs. 8 / 16; p = 0. 02). For the simulated grade IIIb laryngoscopy group, the fibreoptic scope was also more successful than the bougie (8 / 16 successful intubations vs. 1 / 16; p = 0. 02), but clearly use of the fibreoptic scope was not as successful as it had been in simulated grade IIIa laryngoscopy (p = 0. 04). With either device, median (range) total tracheal intubation times for successful attempts with either grade of laryngoscopy were less than 60 s (19 - 109) and there were no clinically important differences. We conclude that the <b>fibrescope</b> used in conjunction with Macintosh laryngoscopy is a more reliable method of tracheal intubation than the single-use bougie in both types of grade III laryngoscopy.

40|$|SUMMARY Overtubes {{are short}} sleeves {{designed}} to fit over the shaft of fibrescopes. Several home made overtubes have been described. ' 4 We have reviewed design principles and many potential applications, which are not widely appreciated. PRINCIPLE AND OVERALL DESIGN Overtubes are usually placed over the proximal part of the <b>fibrescope</b> shaft (Fig. 1). Once {{the tip of the}} endoscope has been swallowed, the overtube is slid down over the shaft, to 'splint ' the pharynx and oesophagus. The internal diameter of the overtube is determined by the size of <b>fibrescope,</b> leaving a small gap which allows smooth passage of the.; instrument, without danger of catching or pinching the mucosa. The tube wall should be soft and relatively thin so as to minimise discomfort during. X passage, but it should also be firm enough to resist J damage when sharp objects are passed through it, and to maintain its shape when the endoscope is removed. It is convenient to be able to examine the mucosa through the overtube wall, but transparent tubes are too floppy for many purposes. In order to prevent them being swallowed completely, over- Fig. 1 Short overtube incorporating mouthguardplaced tubes should incorporate a mouthguard (Fig. 1), or a overproximal shaft offibrescope before passage. loop for an assistant to hold (Fig. 2), or a flange which fits behind a standard mouthguard (Fig. 3). The length of an overtube is determined by the indications for its use. LONG OVERTUBES Overtubes designed to transgress the cardia should be about 50 cm long, and may need to incorporate a proximal valve or cuff to prevent escape of air. Extraction offoreign bodies There are hazards in using fibrescopes to extract foreign bodies. Sharp objects may damage the oesophagus and pharynx during withdrawal, and there is a danger of dropping small objects into the trachea. These risks can b...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} the incidence and site of tracheal tube impingement during nasotracheal fibreoptic intubation, and {{the efficacy of}} anticlockwise tube rotation to overcome the problem.

40|$|Background. In {{nasotracheal}} intubation, {{there are}} two main pathways in the nostril through which the endotracheal tube may pass. The lower pathway lies along the floor of the nose underneath the inferior turbinate. The upper pathway lies above the inferior turbinate, just below the middle turbinate. The lower pathway may be considered to be the safer route as it is located away from the middle turbinate and cribiform plate. Methods. We conducted a randomized controlled trial comparing the frequency with which preformed, reinforced, and thermosoftened preformed tubes pass through upper and lower pathways. Ninety-two maxillofacial patients requiring nasotracheal intubation as part of their anaesthetic management were studied. Two patients were excluded from the study at endo-scopy because of atypical nasal anatomy. After the induction of general anaesthesia, a standar-dized traditional nasal intubation was performed with a Macintosh laryngoscope, the operators endeavouring to direct the tube along the floor of the nose.

In most cases, general anaesthesia was used, and ventilation achieved with a mixture of 50 % nitrogen and oxygen, using a modification of the Sanders injector. One hundred and sixty-four cases have been treated in 317 sessions (from one to five sessions per patient).

40|$|Lightwand-guided {{intubation}} is a semi-blind {{technique that}} {{takes advantage of}} the anterior location of the trachea in relation to the oesophagus. Fibreoptic evaluation of lightwand-guided intubation has revealed a possibility of laryngeal interference and epiglottic distortion. Jaw lift, tongue traction or a combination of both have been used to assist in lightwand-guided intubation. This study fibreoptically evaluates lightwand-guided intubation using jaw lift and combined jaw and tongue traction. Eighty four patients with normal airway undergoing general anaesthesia were studied. This randomised, double blinded, cross over study was done in two phases. First phase - after achieving adequate depth of anaesthesia, a <b>fibrescope</b> was advanced nasally, and lightwand-guided intubation was carried out under direct fibreoptic visualisation with the aid of either jaw lift or combined jaw and tongue traction. Second phase - Extubation followed by reintubation using the other manoeuvre. Interference with laryngeal structures during intubation and position of the epiglottis at the end of intubation were noted. Epiglottic distortion (deviated to one side/infolded into trachea) was observed in 6 patients with jaw lift and 17 patients with combined jaw and tongue traction (P = 0. 003). Laryngeal interference was significantly higher (P = 0. 012) with combined manoeuvre (30 / 78) than with jaw lift alone (9 / 81). Although lightwand-guided intubation can be performed quickly and easily, interference with laryngeal structures and distortion of the epiglottis can occur.

Results: In Group I, there was a significant rise in systolic blood pressure and heart rate in contrast to insignificant rise in Group II. Glottis view was significantly better in Group II. Incidence of coughing, ease of placement and post-operative sore throat was identical between both groups.

40|$|Intracellular {{pressure}} {{responses were}} recorded from squid giant axons after the axoplasm was removed by the intracellular perfusion technique. A glass tube was {{inserted into the}} axon {{and the movement of}} the air-water interface formed {{on the end of the}} tube was observed with a Y-shaped <b>fibrescope.</b> The intracellular pressure increased and decreased rapidly when an action potential was induced by electrical stimulation. The amplitude of the response was about 10 mPa (or 1 X 10 (- 3) mmH 2 O), which was very large in comparison with that observed in unperfused axons. It was sensitive to extracellular Ca 2 +. The pressure response appeared in an all-or-none manner and could be suppressed by tetrodotoxin. This excluded physicochemical processes on the stimulating electrode or current-supplying electrode as sources of the response. Various other sources of artifacts were also excluded. An extensive removal of the axoplasm by intracellular perfusion with a protease-containing solution and a KCl solution did not eliminate the pressure response. The intracellular pressure was membrane potential dependent, increasing upon depolarization and decreasing upon hyperpolarization of the membrane. Under voltage clamp, the relationship between the membrane potential and the pressure response was parabolic with a maximum at + 109 mV (in reference to the resting level). The response did not depend on the membrane current. A much slower response due to electro-osmotic water flow was also detected. The pressure response induced by hyperpolarization of the membrane was suppressed by extracellular application of a lidocaine-containing solution, but not by a tetrodotoxin-containing solution. These results suggest that the pressure responses arise either from a change in electrostriction across the axolemma or from a change in charge-dependent tension along the axolemma...|$|E
