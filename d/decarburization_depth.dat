40|$|Abstract. U 71 Mn is {{the main}} steel grade for {{high-speed}} railway rails. In the production of U 71 Mn rail, its <b>decarburization</b> <b>depth</b> is the deepest, and the qualified percentage is lower than 60 % for the requirement of less than 0. 3 mm of <b>decarburization</b> <b>depth.</b> On the basis of current heating furnace, the influence of different heating processes on the <b>decarburization</b> <b>depth</b> of U 71 Mn rail was studied, and the result shows that just optimization of heat process can not decrease greatly the <b>decarburization</b> <b>depth.</b> Therefore the high temperature anti-oxidation coating protection technology {{was carried out in}} the process of heating of U 71 Mn rail. Under the condition of protection heating and optimization of heating process, the <b>decarburization</b> <b>depth</b> of U 71 Mn rail decreases significantly, and the qualified rate reaches to more than 95 % for the depth of less than 0. 30 mm, and 100 % for the depth of less than 0. 50 mm...|$|E
40|$|Due to {{economic}} significance, industry demands on mathematical models, which {{allow for the}} prediction of realistic carburization and <b>decarburization</b> <b>depth</b> profiles. Analytical solutions of Fick’s law, however, are of limited aptitude, as the concentration dependence of the diffusion coefficient of carbon in steel cannot be considered. Thus, the present paper presents a numerical simulation tool based on the finite element method (FEM). A widespread commercially available program system was used to ensure industrial applicability {{and to make a}} contribution to the standardizing of operation control...|$|E
40|$|There is a {{pressing}} need for non-destructive testing (NDT) methods for monitoring steel microstructures as they determine the mechanical properties of steel products. Magnetoacoustic emission (MAE) has potential for this application {{since it is}} sensitive to steel microstructure. The aim of this project is to study systematically the dependence of MAE upon steel microstructure, and to apply the technique to examine the industrial steel components which have complicated microstructures. Studies of MAE and Barkhausen emission (BE) were made on several systems including fully pearlitic, fully ferritic, ferritic/pearlitic and spheroidized steels. Results {{suggest that there is}} a correlation between the microstructural parameters and the MAE and BE profiles. The study of fully pearlitic steel shows that both MAE and BE are sensitive to the interlamellar spacing of pearlite. Low-carbon ferritic steel samples give different MAE and BE profiles which are dependent on ferrite grain size. Lorentz microscopy reveals that there are differences in domain structures and magnetization processes between fully ferritic and fully pearlitic samples. Study of ferritic/pearlitic samples indicates that both MAE and BE depend on the ferrite content. In the case of spheroidized steel samples MAE and BE profiles were found {{to be sensitive to the}} changes in the morphology and size of carbides. Samples of industrial steel products including pearlitic rail steel and decarburized billet were investigated. The MAE profiles obtained from the rail are consistent with those measured from the fully pearlitic rod samples. This suggests that MAE can be used for monitoring the microstructure of large steel components, provided that another technique such as BE is also used to complement the MAE measurements. In the study of the billet samples, MAE and BE were found to be dependent on the <b>decarburization</b> <b>depth.</b> The results are discussed in the context of the change in ferrite content of the surface layer of the billets and the penetration of the applied field inside the samples.

40|$|On {{decarburization}} {{mechanism of}} carbon steels and white cast irons have already studied by many investigators for varied composition. In this paper, the investigators acted decarburization treatment at 750 ℃for ten hours in air {{and studied the}} effect or relationship of carbon content, rolling direction and at right angle to rolling direction on decarburization of carbon steels with carbon 0. 105, 0. 208, 0. 49 and 0. 64 % preceded by normalizing at appropriate temperature through mean of metallography. The results obtained are as follows : (1) <b>Depth</b> of <b>decarburization</b> of low carbon steels thicken more readily than high carbon steels at 750 ℃. (2) When carbon steels decarburize at 750 ℃, ferrite band become granular crystal unconcerned in carbon content. (3) When method of decarburization is the same, i seems that pre-treatment of specimens have a great influence upon <b>depth</b> of <b>decarburization.</b> (4) <b>Depth</b> <b>decarburization</b> at right angle to rolling direction thicken more readily than rolling direction...|$|R
40|$|Introduction {{and current}} state of the problem. Common and {{undesirable}} defects in microstructures include surface decarburization which compromises the quality of HC wire rods hot-wound into coils (coil rod) and performance of products made there from. Resistance of metal to alternating loads is determined by the depth of the decarburized layer, i. e. actual difference between surface microstructure and base metal structure. As we know [1, 2], for decarburization process to occur on the metal surface when heated in a furnace, the gaseous atmosphere shall not produce a very strong oxidizing effect. If the rate of oxidation is higher than that of carbon diffusion in steel, it enhances scale build-up whereby oxygen can oxidize both carbon and iron. Although decarburized layer is mostly deemed to be detrimental, {{it has been argued that}} decarburization of wire rod surface can be advantageous to useful qualities of wire rods. Soft decarburized surface ensures improved flextural (bending) or torsional (twisting) dictility of metal resulting from low sensitivity to stress concentration factors, high resistance to crack propagation and higher corrosion resistance [3]. Compressive residual stresses occurring in a decarburized skin improve the fatigue life and increase the durability of steel-wire ropes [4]. Wire rods with more pronounced surface decarburization are less likely to form the hardened structures (martensite) in drawing operations due to surface cracking and cupping of the martensitic layer. However, in the process of cold drawing whereby metal is deformed by pulling wire rods through a serious of drawing dies (monolithic system), maximum stresses develop on the surface of rolled products[3 – 5]. Therefore uniform distribution of structure on the surface and in the boundary layers is essential. This means that minimum and uniform depth of decarburization on the metal surface is a prerequisite for the production of high-quality HC rolled stock [3 – 7]. The paper [11] acknowledges the influence of micro-additives of boron on changes in the austenite grain size and accordingly the length of borders in high-carbon steels with austenitizing temperature increase within the range of 900 … 1 100 ºС. The purpose of work is to research the effect of austenite grain size on the <b>decarburization</b> <b>depth</b> in carbon (base) steel and boron micro-alloyed steel...|$|E
