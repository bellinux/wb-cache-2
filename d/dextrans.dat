Two comb-like <b>dextran</b> surfactant polymers, which are different in their <b>dextran</b> molecular weight (MW) distribution and the presence of amine functional groups, and their characterization were synthesized. These structurally well-defined surfactant polymers include a bimodal amine <b>dextran</b> surfactant polymer and a monomodal <b>dextran</b> surfactant polymer.

50|$|These {{agents are}} used {{commonly}} by microsurgeons to decrease vascular thrombosis. The antithrombotic effect of dextran is mediated through its binding of erythrocytes, platelets, and vascular endothelium, increasing their electronegativity and thus reducing erythrocyte aggregation and platelet adhesiveness. <b>Dextrans</b> also reduce factor VIII-Ag Von Willebrand factor, thereby decreasing platelet function. Clots formed after administration of <b>dextrans</b> {{are more easily}} lysed due to an altered thrombus structure (more evenly distributed platelets with coarser fibrin). By inhibiting α-2 antiplasmin, dextran serves as a plasminogen activator, so possesses thrombolytic features.|$|E
5000|$|Outside {{from these}} features, larger <b>dextrans,</b> {{which do not}} pass out of the vessels, are potent osmotic agents, thus have been used {{urgently}} to treat hypovolemia. The hemodilution caused by volume expansion with dextran use improves blood flow, thus further improving patency of microanastomoses and reducing thrombosis. Still, no difference has been detected in antithrombotic effectiveness in comparison of intra-arterial and intravenous administration of dextran. [...] <b>Dextrans</b> are available in multiple molecular weights ranging from 3,000 Da to 2,000,000 Da. The larger <b>dextrans</b> (>60,000 Da) are excreted poorly from the kidney, so remain in the blood {{for as long as}} weeks until they are metabolized. Consequently, they have prolonged antithrombotic and colloidal effects. In this family, dextran-40 (MW: 40,000 Da), has been the most popular member for anticoagulation therapy. Close to 70% of dextran-40 is excreted in urine within the first 24 hours after intravenous infusion, while the remaining 30% are retained for several more days.|$|E

A 1 : 1 mass ratio of high-fraction <b>dextran</b> (approximately 250, 000 Da) and low-fraction <b>dextran</b> (60, 000 – 90, 000 Da) is used to represent {{a wide range of}} <b>dextran</b> contamination.

However it appears that these are secondary effects, with the partition coefficient strongly correlating with crystal growth rate alone, despite the regressed data having large variations in temperature, mother liquor <b>dextran</b> content, and supersaturation. <b>Dextran</b> incorporation into the sugar crystal results from both <b>dextran</b> adsorption onto the crystal surface and mother liquor inclusions. The explanation for the variation in the <b>dextran</b> content in sugar crystal with respect to the growth rate is due to increased adsorption due to the higher surface roughness of crystals grown at high growth rates.

Methods: In this experimental study, for bacterial growth and <b>dextran</b> production, sugarcane molasses was added to the culture medium at different concentrations. <b>Dextran</b> sedimentation was obtained by shaking and centrifugation by adding ethanol after 48 hours.

50|$|The {{research}} {{that appeared to}} spark an onslaught of modified applications was a gel permeation chromatography technique of fixing poly(isopropyl acrylate) (PIPA) strands to glass beads and separating a mixture of <b>dextrans,</b> which was developed by Gewehr et al. They found that between the temperatures of 25-32 °C, the elution time of <b>dextrans</b> at different molecular weights exhibited a dependence on the temperature. <b>Dextrans</b> of the highest molecular weight eluted first since the PIPA chains exhibit hydrophilicity at temperatures below the LCST. As {{the temperature of the}} elution increased, when the chains behave in a more hydrophobic manner, the elution times increased for each of the analytes for the given range. The trend generally applies over the entire temperature range, but there is a flattening of the curve before 25 °C and after 32 °C (the approximate LCST for this experiment). It {{is important to note that}} above the LCST, the PIPA acts as a typical nonpolar stationary phase that would be used in reverse-phased chromatography. There are also instances of the elution times increasing below 15 °C, which most likely can be attributed to the lower temperatures’ effects on mass transfer playing a more significant role on retention than the stationary phase behavior. This study showed that the resolution could essentially be tuned by adjusting the operating temperature. The scope of this study was limited to isothermal conditions and attaching polymer chains to glass beads.
