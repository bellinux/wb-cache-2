5|$|Food {{waste is}} {{generally}} considered to have a damaging effect on the environment; a reduction in food waste is considered critical if the UK is to meet obligations under the European Landfill Directive to reduce biodegradable waste going to landfill and favourable considering international targets on climate change, limiting greenhouse gas emissions. When disposed of in landfill, food waste releases methane, a relatively damaging greenhouse gas, and leachate, a toxin capable of considerable groundwater pollution. The <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> accounts for a fifth of UK carbon emissions; the production, storage and transportation of food to homes requires large amounts of energy. The effects of stopping food waste that can potentially be prevented has been likened to removing one in five cars from UK roads.|$|E

With this objective some food enterprises in UK have started to adopt ‘lean thinking’. Little academic evidence exists {{on whether or not}} this is a sustainable strategy. Sustainability can be defined through the ‘triple bottom line’ including economic, environmental and social aspects. A literature review was conducted to explore the applicability of lean thinking as a sustainable strategy in <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> <b>chains.</b> It showed that lean has potentials, but would require trade-offs where lean principles are adapted to the characteristics of <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> <b>chains</b> and where it also includes environmental and social aspects to a greater extent.

More efficient utilisation {{and management of the}} resources and values created in <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> <b>chains</b> can contribute to improving competitiveness, and environmental and social responsibility. This study uses the seven wastes approach from lean theory to classify categories of waste in fresh <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> <b>chains</b> and to identify at which stage of the <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> waste occur. A case is used to illustrate the applicability of the classification. The analysis identifies four categories of waste in the fresh <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> chain; time, distance, energy and mass.

40|$|Purpose: Packaging adds {{weight and}} volume to food products, thereby {{increasing}} {{the environmental impact}} of transport processes. This research examines the relative importance of transport efficient packaging in <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> <b>chains</b> that rely on road transport compared to other environmental requirements, such as packaging material minimization and food waste reduction. Design/methodology/approach: Screening life cycle assessment methodology was applied to analyse two different packaging systems in two <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> <b>chains.</b> Data were collected from a major Swedish food producer. Findings: The findings show that in the <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> <b>chains</b> analyzed, the transport efficiency of packaging has lower environmental importance than packaging material minimization and food waste reduction, but that the aspect is context specific. The study describes how transport distances and truck size influence the size of the potential environmental benefit of transport efficient packaging in the <b>supply</b> <b>chains</b> analysed. Research limitations/implications:The study identifies a need for future research to analyse the relevance of packaging transport efficiency in other kinds of <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> <b>chains.</b> The study was limited to two <b>supply</b> <b>chains</b> of one Swedish food producer. Practical implications: The findings can help practitioners to take more informed decisions about the transport optimization of packaging. Social implications: The findings contribute to the understanding of {{the environmental impact of}} packaging in <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> <b>chains.</b> Original/value: The results contribute to research about the trade-offs between different environmental requirements on food packaging...|$|R

40|$|The wide-ranging {{literature}} on food systems provides multiple perspectives and world views. Various stakeholders define food and food systems in non-equivalent ways. The {{perception of the}} performance of food systems is determined by these specific perspectives, and a wide variety of policies responding to different aims are proposed and implemented accordingly. This paper sets out to demonstrate that the pre-analytical adoption of different narratives about the food System leads to non-equivalent assessments {{of the performance of}} <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> <b>chains.</b> In order to do so, we (i) identify a set of relevant narratives on <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> <b>chains</b> in Spanish and Catalan contexts; (ii) identify the pertinent attributes needed to describe and represent <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> <b>chains</b> within the different perspectives or narratives; and (iii) carry out an integrated assessment of three orgànic tomato <b>supply</b> <b>chains</b> from the different perspectives. In doing so, the paper proposes an analysis of narratives to enable the analyst to characterize the performance of <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> <b>chains</b> from diferent perspectives and to identify the expected trade-offs of integrated assessment, associating them with the legitimate-but-contrasting views found among the social actors involved...|$|R

40|$|Recent price {{movements}} have put <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> <b>chains</b> under pressure. On the one side, upward price tendencies on commodity markets result in higher costs to processing firms. On the other side, these firms {{are confronted with}} a strong retail sector that is able to prevent compensation to protect consumersâ€™ and own economic interests. Regulatory impediments of European law, especially with respect to foodstuffs, can adversely be utilized as barriers to protect the interest downstream the <b>supply</b> <b>chain.</b> The problem is that legal-economic instruments which can serve to smooth price volatility in supply markets can also opportunistically be used {{at the expense of}} the middlesection in <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> <b>chains</b> (i. e., mainly small and medium sized producers). The aim of this article is to identify the legal-economic mechanisms that effect price transfers in <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> <b>chains</b> in the European Union and define policy adjustments to improve pricing mechanisms, while safeguarding the interests of the processing industry. Policy alternatives to improve the smooth functioning of notably intermediate markets in <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> <b>chains</b> are the restructuring of competition law, improved processor information management and creating transparency of value added in the <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> by means of labelling devices...|$|R
