5|$|Plymouth Argyle {{came close}} to making their opponents pay for their profligacy in front of goal with Evans lifting a volley over the crossbar. Darlington's captain Andy Crosby was {{proving to be a}} {{formidable}} figure at the heart of his team's defence, but Argyle fashioned another chance to open the scoring just before half-time. A flick on by Evans presented Adrian Littlejohn with the opportunity to redeem his earlier miss, but <b>he</b> <b>dragged</b> his shot wide.|$|E
5|$|Alcibiades {{was married}} to Hipparete, the {{daughter}} of Hipponicus, a wealthy Athenian. His bride brought with her a large dowry, which significantly increased Alcibiades' already substantial family fortune. According to Plutarch, Hipparete loved her husband, but she attempted to divorce him because he consorted with courtesans but <b>he</b> <b>dragged</b> her away from her court appearance. She lived with him until her death, which came soon after, and gave birth to two children, a daughter and a son, Alcibiades the Younger. Alcibiades was famed throughout his life for his physical attractiveness, {{of which he was}} inordinately vain.|$|E
5|$|During Euro 2008, new Dutch manager Marco van Basten {{changed the}} side's {{formation}} to 4–2–3–1, preferring the midfield trio of Rafael van der Vaart, Wesley Sneijder and Dirk Kuyt, with Robben left to battle {{for a position}} with Robin van Persie on the wing. In the group match against France, which the Netherlands won 4–1, Robben was brought on at half-time. <b>He</b> <b>dragged</b> {{the ball out of}} reach of a defender near the half-way line and paced his way ahead of three defenders, then crossed straight to Van Persie, who powered a shot into the goal past France goalkeeper Grégory Coupet. At 2–0, Thierry Henry scored a goal for France, making it 2–1, but almost directly after the restart, Robben was played through by Sneijder and he ran at the France goal and was forced into an acute angle, but despite the angle, he shot the ball into the net past Coupet.|$|E

5|$|One {{particular}} aspect {{that led}} to disagreement amongst {{the cast and crew}} was the genuine killing of animals. Kerman stormed off the set while the death of the coatimundi was filmed, and Yorke refused to participate in the killing of a pig, which he was originally scripted to execute, leaving the duty to Luca Barbareschi. When it was shot, the squeal of the pig subsequently caused Yorke to botch a long monologue, and retakes were not an option because they had no access to additional pigs. Perry Pirkanen cried after filming the butchering of a turtle, and crew members vomited off camera when a squirrel monkey was killed for the film. Actress Francesca Ciardi also objected to the film's sexual content {{and did not want to}} bare her breasts during the sex scene between her and Carl Yorke. When she refused to comply with Deodato's direction, <b>he</b> <b>dragged</b> her off the set and screamed at her in Italian. She had earlier suggested that she and Yorke actually have sex in the jungle before filming in order to relieve the tension of the upcoming scene. When Yorke declined, she grew upset with him, alienating him for the rest of the shoot.|$|E
25|$|At the {{imminent}} risk {{of his own}} life, while his regiment was falling back before a superior force of the enemy, <b>he</b> <b>dragged</b> a wounded and helpless officer to the rear, thus saving him from death or capture.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} quarter, after a UCLA missed field goal, Earl McCullouch would run 52 yards on a flanker reverse; he fumbled {{near the end}} of the play but USC recovered. He then caught another 13-yard pass. This set up O. J. Simpson for a weaving 12-yard {{touchdown}} run through most of the UCLA defensive unit in which <b>he</b> <b>dragged</b> two tacklers to the end zone. USC led at halftime 14-7.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, {{the police}} {{continued}} to fire upon the other Nationalists. Domingo Hiraldo Resto was seriously wounded, but despite his wounds <b>he</b> <b>dragged</b> himself towards the mansions entrance. He {{was able to}} reach the mansions main door and once there he was motionless {{and appeared to be}} dead. He suddenly turned and sat on the steps and with his hands held up pleaded for mercy, his pleas however, were answered with a fusillade of gunfire.|$|E
25|$|Included as a {{replacement}} for Alan Kippax, Bradman walked to the crease {{on the first day of}} the second Test at the MCG with the score at 2/67. A world record crowd of 63,993 provided a standing ovation that delayed play for several minutes. Anticipating the bouncer first ball, Bradman moved across to play the hook shot, but the ball failed to rise and <b>he</b> <b>dragged</b> it onto his stumps, making his initial first-ball duck in a Test. The crowd fell into stunned silence as he walked off.|$|E
25|$|The fire {{became so}} intense that Rose was forced to crawl from {{position}} to position in order to treat the wounded, giving words of encouragement and directing the fire of the inexperienced and terrified Vietnamese and Montagnard troops. Over the next few days, the company marched west and deeper into Laos, fending off incessant attacks from elements ranging from squad-sized to company-sized, covered by Air Force gunships. On 12 September, during an assault by a NVA company-sized element, one of the Montagnards was wounded 40 to 50 meters outside the perimeter. Dodging enemy fire, Rose ran and crawled {{his way to the}} wounded man, shielding him with his own body while he treated him. <b>He</b> <b>dragged</b> the Montagnard back to the company with one hand while firing at the enemy with his gun in his other hand.|$|E
50|$|Billy forces alcohol {{down the}} throat of the next victim (Jillian Swanson). <b>He</b> <b>drags</b> the {{incapacitated}} woman around the house, up the stairs, forcing her to swallow pills before killing her. She is later fed to the woodchipper.|$|R

25|$|In early 1996, he was {{contacted}} by Sonic Youth's Steve Shelley, who informed Van Zandt {{that he was}} interested in recording and releasing an album for him on the band's Ecstatic Peace label, funded by Geffen. Van Zandt agreed, and sessions were scheduled to begin in Memphis during late December of that year. On December 19 or 20, Van Zandt fell down the concrete stairs outside his home, badly injuring his hip. After lying outside for an hour, <b>he</b> <b>dragged</b> himself inside and called his ex-wife Jeanene, who sent friends Royann and Jim Calvin to check on him. He told the couple that he had sustained the injury while getting out of bed, and refused medical treatment. They took him back to their home, and he spent the Christmas week on their couch, unable to get up even to use the bathroom.|$|E
25|$|Achilles, maddened with grief, {{swore to}} kill Hector in revenge. He was {{reconciled}} with Agamemnon and received Briseis back, untouched by Agamemnon. He received {{a new set}} of arms, forged by the god Hephaestus, and returned to the battlefield. He slaughtered many Trojans, and nearly killed Aeneas, who was saved by Poseidon. Achilles fought with the river god Scamander, and a battle of the gods followed. The Trojan army returned to the city, except for Hector, who remained outside the walls because he was tricked by Athena. Achilles killed Hector, and afterwards <b>he</b> <b>dragged</b> Hector's body from his chariot and refused to return the body to the Trojans for burial. The Achaeans then conducted funeral games for Patroclus. Afterwards, Priam came to Achilles' tent, guided by Hermes, and asked Achilles to return Hector's body. The armies made a temporary truce to allow the burial of the dead. The Iliad ends with the funeral of Hector.|$|E
25|$|On October 17, 2017 Frank Ocean's dad, Calvin Cooksey, sued Frank {{on charges}} of {{defamation}} and other damages with restitution payments reaching up to 14.5 million dollars. The issue started when Frank Ocean wrote a post in his personal Tumblr responding to the Pulse Nightclub shooting back in June 2016 and told {{a story about how}} when he was a kid, he heard his father use a transphobic slur towards a waitress. The post stated that:'I was six years old when I heard my dad call our transgender waitress a f***** as <b>he</b> <b>dragged</b> me out a neighborhood diner saying we wouldn’t be served because she was dirty. 'That was the last afternoon I saw my father and the first time I heard that word, I think, although it wouldn’t shock me if it wasn’t. Many hate us and wish we didn’t exist.' The judge ended up ruling in favor of Frank Ocean and the case was put to an end.|$|E

25|$|The first over was bowled by Mohammad Aamer. After {{failing to}} score {{off the first}} four balls – all short – Dilshan went for his scoop and mistimed it, {{resulting}} in him being caught at short fine-leg. Soon after this, Jehan Mubarak top edged a delivery by Abdul Razzaq which went {{high in the air}} and was caught by Shahzaib Hasan, leaving Sri Lanka at 2 for 2. Sanath Jayasuriya was able to stabilise the innings for Sri Lanka hitting 17 runs off 10 balls, however, Jayasuriya soon fell as <b>he</b> <b>dragged</b> a good length ball back on to the stumps. Mahela Jayawardene followed after edging a shot into the hands of Misbah-ul-Haq, leaving Sri Lanka on 32/4. Sangakkara and Chamara Silva added further runs, before the latter was caught by Saeed Ajmal playing a pull shot off the bowling of Umar Gul. Shahid Afridi soon after, took the wicket of Isuru Udana with a googly which drifted into the right-hander, knocking the off-stump. This brought in Angelo Mathews, who along with Sangakkara took the score from 70/6 to 138/6, with 17 runs being scored off the last over bowled by Mohammad Aamer.
