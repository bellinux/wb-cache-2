40|$|Studies {{shows that}} the future {{packaging}} trends in the automotive industry are turning towards an increased usage of <b>disposable</b> <b>packaging</b> in longer distance flows. Accordingly, Volvo Group has initiated a project called Next Generation Packaging with the objective to harmonize and standardize the Volvo Group’s packaging pool. However, there are concerns that <b>disposable</b> <b>packaging</b> material (often cardboard) will {{have a negative impact}} on the material handling, scrapping or recycling, and the level of cleanliness inside production plants, thus affecting the production quality. The aim of this thesis is to study the effects of an increased usage of <b>disposable</b> <b>packaging</b> in the Volvo Group’s receiving plant from goods receiving to point of use to waste handling, and to identify potential problems that arise from replacing the returnable packaging with disposable alternatives. The total scope for the project Next Generation Packaging is global, but the master thesis is limited in terms of geographical location and the main focus is on the production plant in Tuve. The report will further be limited to the packaging alternatives that Next Generation Packaging is reviewing, which are disposable boxes and pallets in cardboard provided by Papyrus Supplies. In order to fulfil the aim and answer the research questions, an extensive part of the study was to understand and to map the current state of Volvo Group’s internal logistics processes by conducting a Material Flow Mapping. The flows decided to follow were two pallet flows and four box flows. The six flows together covered all logistics processes that the <b>disposable</b> <b>packaging</b> needed to be tested in, in order to ensure endurance and applicability before a possible implementation. To evaluate the packaging performance, the <b>disposable</b> <b>packaging</b> alternative provided by Papyrus Supplies have been analysed from four different packaging requirements: the protective perspective, the handling efficiency perspective, the ergonomic perspective, and the information perspective. The main conclusions made from analysing the <b>disposable</b> <b>packaging</b> based on these four perspectives are that the <b>disposable</b> <b>packaging</b> solutions could, in the rough, be handled in the same internal logistics processes up to the handling and collection of empty packaging. The breakdown of empty cardboard packaging does require new processes, as well as space and locations for handling of empty packaging...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Introduction Ozonization is an {{alternative}} sterilization process for heat-sensitive medical devices. However, {{the side effects of}} this process on packaging materials should be verified. Methods Four types of commercial <b>disposable</b> <b>packaging</b> for medical devices were evaluated after undergoing ozone sterilization: crepe paper sheet, non-woven fabric sheet (SMS), medical grade paper-plastic pouch and Tyvec©-plastic pouch. For each material, the gas penetration through the microbiological barrier was measured. Other packaging properties, such as chemical composition, color, tactile and mechanical resistance, were also evaluated after sterilization, by using characterization techniques, namely microbiological indicators, infrared spectroscopy, tensile test and optical microscopy. Results All commercial <b>disposable</b> <b>packaging</b> showed good ozone penetration. Crepe paper and SMS were chemically and mechanically modified by ozone, while Tyvec© only suffered mechanical modification. Paper-plastic pouch was the packaging material which just experienced an acceptable reduction in tensile resistance, showing no variations on chemical or visual properties. Conclusion The results suggest that medical grade paper-plastic pouch is the most appropriate disposable medical device packaging to be sterilized by ozone when compared to other materials...|$|E

40|$|A {{certain amount}} of {{construction}} waste comes from <b>disposable</b> <b>packaging</b> and this waste is ecologically damaging, one solution would be to reduce the disposable by using returnable packaging for non-specific construction products. To find out if this solution is feasible a study {{has been carried out}} on the economical and ecological consequences. A housing construction project was chosen to get insight into the sizes of the construction products and in the amount of packaging used in the construction products. Based on these results a transportation system has been developed. First an inventory was made of all the functions needed in the transportation system. For every function a solution is developed, and for the functions together, a principle design was chosen. This study led us to design a synthetic crate with the floor dimensions of 400 by 600 and 400 mm height, and a lid which {{can be used as a}} small pallet. The crates are transported to the building site on EURO-pallets and are manually handled into the building by a specially designed handcart. The handcart has the functions of a palletcart, wheel barrow and sack car. To manage these crates,lids and pallets a pool system was also designed. The principle of this system is that the pool organisation buys the crates and lends them to the packers with a deposit. The packer pay a fee to the pool organisation to can fill a crate. The transportation firm gets paid from the pool organisation for bringing back the empty crates to the packers. Based on this systern, calculations are made on what the fee should be. The use of the crate is economically and ecologically more interesting for construction products which use a high proportion of <b>disposable</b> <b>packaging.</b> What important is in introducing a returnable crate is an efficient pool organisation. The packers must be the owners of tbe pool organisation. The returnable crate is not only interesting for the environment, but it also has advantages for tbe working circumstances and the logistics between the producers and users of building materials...|$|E

30|$|Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) have {{received}} much attention as bio-based plastics that {{may contribute to}} future replacement of petroleum based plastics. Their performance ranges from stiff and brittle to soft and tough (Sudesh et al. 2000 and Laycock et al. 2013). The most common PHA is polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), which has similar thermal and some mechanical properties (e.g. tensile strength) compared to isotactic polypropylene (Sudesh et al. 2000). In contrast to petroleum based plastics, PHA’s biodegradability in various natural environments makes them suitable as <b>disposables</b> for <b>packaging,</b> agricultural or medical applications (Williams and Martin 2002, Bucci et al. 2005, Markets and Markets, 2013).

40|$|Packaging waste forms a {{significant}} part of municipal solid waste and as such has caused increasing environmental concerns, resulting in strengthening of EU Regulations in order to reduce amounts of packaging waste. Among other materials, a huge range of oil-based polymers is currently used in packaging applications. They are largely non-biodegradable and particularly difficult to recycle or reuse due to mixed levels of contamination and complex composites. In recent years, the development of biodegradable packaging materials from renewable natural resources (e. g. crops) has received increasing attention, particularly in EU countries. Significant progress has been made to produce biodegradable materials with similar functionality to that of the oil-based synthetic polymers. It is anticipated that, as the materials are from renewable resources and biodegradable, they would contribute to sustainable development and if properly managed would reduce their environmental impact upon disposal. This paper discusses the potential impact of biodegradable packaging materials on waste management in terms of landfill, incineration, recycle/reuse and composting. A comparison is also drawn to the oil-based polymer packaging materials. It is the view of the authors that biodegradable packaging materials are most suitable for single use <b>disposable</b> <b>packaging</b> applications where the post-consumer use packaging can be locally composted as a means of recycling the materials.
