25|$|Often {{described}} as the opposite of déjà vu, <b>jamais</b> vu involves a sense of eeriness and the observer's impression of seeing the situation for the first time, despite rationally knowing {{that he or she}} has been in the situation before. <b>Jamais</b> vu is more commonly explained as when a person momentarily does not recognize a word, person, or place that they already know. <b>Jamais</b> vu is sometimes associated with certain types of aphasia, amnesia, and epilepsy.|$|E
25|$|Similar {{phenomena}} include Déjà vu (Already seen), <b>Jamais</b> vu (Never Seen), and Déjà entendu (Already Heard).|$|E

25|$|Léonce Perret {{began his}} career as a {{relatively}} undistinguished stage actor. He was recruited to the film industry by the Gaumont Film Company. His numerous short films gained significant accolade in French cinematography. Until his emigration to the United States in 1917, he was a fixture of the Gaumont Film Company. On American soil, he produced several popular films, the most notable being Lest We Forget (N'oublions <b>jamais)</b> in 1918.|$|E

La discrétion des notables annamites est telle, que les pirates, leurs méfaits accomplis, n'ont pas même à s'éloigner du village où ils ont fixé leur résidence. Ils dissimulent simplement leurs armes et, tels des travailleurs rangés, prêts à fournir des renseignements aux Commissions d'enquête, ils assistant tranquillement aux recherches.|$|E
25|$|Count Benedetti {{spoke to}} me on the promenade, in order to demand from me, finally in a very importunate manner, that I should authorize him to {{telegraph}} at once that I bound myself for all future time never again to give my consent if the Hohenzollerns should renew their candidature. I refused at last somewhat sternly, as it is neither right nor possible to undertake engagements of this kind à tout <b>jamais.</b> Naturally I told him that I had as yet received no news, and as he was earlier informed about Paris and Madrid than myself, he could clearly see that my government once more had no hand in the matter. His Majesty has since received a letter from the Prince. His Majesty having told Count Benedetti that he was awaiting news from the Prince, has decided with reference to the above demand, upon the representation of Count Eulenburg and myself, not to receive Count Benedetti again, but only to let him be informed through an aide-de-camp that his Majesty had now received from the Prince confirmation of the news which Benedetti had already received from Paris, and had nothing further to say to the ambassador. His Majesty leaves it to your Excellency whether Benedetti's fresh demand and its rejection should not be at once communicated both to our ambassadors and to the press.|$|E

500|$|Aged 12, Georges Remi—who {{later became}} best known under the pen name Hergé—joined the Boy Scout brigade {{attached}} to Saint-Boniface School {{in his native}} Brussels, becoming troop leader of the Squirrel Patrol and earning the name [...] "Curious Fox" [...] (Renard curieux). With the Scouts, he travelled for summer camps in Italy, Switzerland, Austria and Spain, and {{in the summer of}} 1923 his troop hiked 200 miles across the Pyrenees. His experiences with Scouting would have a significant influence on the rest of his life, sparking his love of camping and the natural world, and providing him with a moral compass that stressed personal loyalty and keeping one's promise.

500|$|Also {{writing in}} The Atlantic, {{a year after}} Carr, the {{futurist}} <b>Jamais</b> Cascio argued that human cognition has always evolved to meet environmental challenges, and that those posed by the internet are no different. He described the 'skimming' referred to by Carr {{as a form of}} attention deficit caused by the immaturity of filter algorithms: [...] "The trouble isn’t that we have too much information at our fingertips, but that our tools for managing it are still in their infancy... many of the technologies that Carr worries about were developed precisely to help us get some control over a flood of data and ideas. Google isn’t the problem; it’s the beginning of a solution." [...] Cascio and Carr's articles have been discussed together in several places. Pew Research used them to form a tension-pair question survey that was distributed to noted academics. Most responded in detail; concurring with the proposition [...] "Carr was wrong: Google does not make us stupid". In The Googlisation of Everything, Vaidhyanathan tended to side with Carr. However, he thought both arguments relied too much on determinism: Carr in thinking that an over-reliance on internet tools will inevitably cause the brain to atrophy, and Cascio in thinking that getting smarter is the necessary outcome of the evolutionary pressures he describes. In From Gutenberg to Zuckerberg Naughton noted that, while many agreed Carr had hit on an important subject, his conclusions were not widely supported.|$|E

2500|$|During Guizot’s {{tenure as}} foreign minister, he and Lord Aberdeen, the foreign {{secretary}} to Sir Robert Peel, carried on well, and thus they secured France and Britain in the entente cordiale.

2500|$|The strongest {{pathological}} {{association of}} déjà vu is with temporal lobe epilepsy. This correlation {{has led some}} researchers to speculate {{that the experience of}} déjà vu is possibly a neurological anomaly related to improper electrical discharge in the brain, creating a strong sensation that an event or experience currently being experienced has already been experienced in the past. As most people suffer a mild (i.e. non-pathological) epileptic episode regularly (e.g. a hypnagogic jerk, the sudden [...] "jolt" [...] that frequently, but not always, occurs just prior to falling asleep), it is conjectured that a similar (mild) neurological aberration occurs in the experience of déjà vu, resulting in an erroneous sensation of memory. Scientists have even looked into genetics when considering déjà vu. Although there is not currently a gene associated with déjà vu, the LGII gene on chromosome 10 is being studied for a possible link. Certain forms of the gene are associated with a mild form of epilepsy and, though by no means a certainty, déjà vu, along with <b>jamais</b> vu, occurs often enough during seizures (such as simple partial seizures) that researchers have reason to suspect a link.|$|E
2500|$|Her {{debut at}} Teatro alla Scala {{took place in}} December 1842 as [...] "Neocle" [...] in the Italian version of Le siège de Corinthe, which was {{followed}} by roles in operas by Marliani, Donizetti (as [...] "Maffio Orsini" [...] and [...] "Leonora" [...] in the Scala premiere of the Italian version of La favorite), Salvi and Pacini. In the season 1844–1845 she was engaged in the Saint Petersburg Imperial Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre; later, in 1846–47, she toured the principal cities of Central Europe, finally reaching London and Paris, where she settled permanently. In London, [...] "she appeared in leading roles by Rossini and Donizetti (where she outshone Giulia Grisi and Jenny Lind) and also sang Cherubino (performing with Henriette Sontag)".
