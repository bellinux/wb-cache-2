5|$|Around {{the time}} the highway was completed, the federal {{government}} began to promote suburbanization by moving several federal agencies out of the capital {{in order to protect}} them against nuclear attack. As a result, suburban neighborhoods began to appear in Laurel, Severn, Bowie, and Greenbelt.

Realizing she could not defeat Jabou, and that he had destroyed his soulmate in the other world to avoid the possibility of being defeated through them, she chose to travel <b>into</b> <b>both</b> the future and into Oliver's world in the hopes of finding his next soulmate; after settling into this new world, she eventually gave birth to her son, Oliver, who unknowingly became Jabou's soulmate. After he is defeated, Jabou's past is shown. He was once a soldier who helped a young girl against orders, and whose hometown was destroyed to set an example. The spirit of Alicia talks to the dying Jabou, who realises that the girl he saved was the young Alicia herself. Jabou then uses his power to sever the link between himself and Oliver, in order to save Oliver from dying as well.|$|E
5|$|As Captain Picard and Commander Data (Brent Spiner) {{discuss the}} matter with the Ventaxian leader (Marcelo Tubert), a woman appears in the chamber, announcing herself as Ardra.

Ardra states that {{she has come to}} claim the planet. Picard is instantly suspicious and orders Data to examine the contract that supposedly was signed by Ardra and the leaders of the planet a thousand years ago. Picard returns to the Enterprise afterwards, and Ardra appears on the bridge sitting in the Captain's chair. Security Chief Worf (Michael Dorn) tries to remove her without success, Data returns just then and confirms the language of the contract as well as Ardra's claim to the planet, including anything in orbit, including the Enterprise.|$|E
5|$|At his 1st dan judo examination, Abbe {{had caught}} the {{attention}} of Shotaro Tobata from the Butoku Kai, who had been refereeing at the event.

With the additional help of a teacher named Nakano, Abbe now prepared for the entrance examination in Kyoto. Out of all the candidates, of which there were around 300 that year, 20 would be accepted into the judo programme and 20 into the kendo programme. Abbe performed well and was accepted <b>into</b> <b>both</b> programmes.|$|E

5|$|During the 12th century, {{new designs}} {{began to be}} {{introduced}} – in France, quatrefoil-shaped keeps were introduced, while in England polygonal towers were built. By {{the end of the}} century, French and English keep designs began to diverge: Philip II of France built a sequence of circular keeps as part of his bid to stamp his royal authority on his new territories, while in England castles were built without keeps. In Spain, keeps were increasingly incorporated <b>into</b> <b>both</b> Christian and Islamic castles, although in Germany tall towers called Bergfriede were preferred to keeps in the western fashion. In {{the second half of the}} 14th century, there was a resurgence in the building of keeps. In France, the keep at Vincennes began a fashion for tall, heavily machicolated designs, a trend adopted in Spain most prominently through the Valladolid school of Spanish castle design. Meanwhile, tower keeps in England became popular amongst the most wealthy nobles: these large keeps, each uniquely designed, formed part of the grandest castles built during the period.|$|E
5|$|In 1905, a {{gold medal}} {{competition}} {{was sponsored by the}} Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters to investigate a method for measuring the surface tension of liquids that had been proposed by Lord Rayleigh in 1879. This involved measuring the frequency of oscillation of the radius of a water jet. Bohr conducted a series of experiments using his father's laboratory in the university; the university itself had no physics laboratory. To complete his experiments, he had to make his own glassware, creating test tubes with the required elliptical cross-sections. He went beyond the original task, incorporating improvements <b>into</b> <b>both</b> Rayleigh's theory and his method, by taking into account the viscosity of the water, and by working with finite amplitudes instead of just infinitesimal ones. His essay, which he submitted at the last minute, won the prize. He later submitted an improved version of the paper to the Royal Society in London for publication in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society.|$|E
5|$|In the 1892 election, South Carolinians {{passed a}} {{non-binding}} referendum calling for prohibition.

Before the House bill could be passed by the Senate, Tillman sent a proposal {{in the form of}} an amendment, with instructions to pass the amended bill, and enact nothing else on the subject. Based on a system that had been successful in Athens, Georgia, the bill banned the private sale of alcohol, setting up a system of dispensaries that would sell alcohol in sealed containers—sale by the drink, and consumption on the premises, would not be permitted. Both houses passed Tillman's amendment, though there was opposition both within and outside the legislature. The dispensary system went into effect on July 1, 1893.|$|E
