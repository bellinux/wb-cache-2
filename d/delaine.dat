60|$|There was a sale. These sales {{contributed a}} good deal to Mrs. Houghton's nervous heart-disease. They brought {{the first signs of}} wear and tear into the face of James Houghton. At first, of course, he merely marked down, with discretion, his less-expensive stock of prints and muslins, nuns-veilings and muslin <b>delaines,</b> with a few fancy braidings and {{trimmings}} in guimp or bronze to enliven the affair. And Woodhouse bought cautiously.|$|R
5000|$|It was contended in {{this case}} that the plaintiffs in error went further than was done and that they offered to prove that in {{commerce}} [...] "Saxony dress goods" [...] were not considered as of [...] "similar description" [...] to <b>delaines.</b> It is argued that this brings the case within what should be taken as an exception reserved in the former decision. The exception claimed is drawn from the following clause in the opinion: ...|$|R

5000|$|The {{court found}} that it was {{competent}} to inquire of a witness in a suit to recover back duties paid under this clause of the act of 1862 whether the words [...] "of similar description" [...] is a commercial term, and if so what is its commercial meaning; but it was not competent to inquire whether the particular goods, alleged to have been improperly subjected to duty, were of similar description to <b>delaines.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Schmieder v.

[...] Held that the similarity required is a similarity in product, in adaptation to uses, and in uses, {{even though in}} commerce they may be classed as different articles; affirming Greenleaf v.

50|$|Upon leaving Phillips Andover, Straw {{was hired}} {{in the spring of}} 1838 as an {{assistant}} civil engineer at the Nashua & Lowell Railway, then under construction. On July 4, 1838, he arrived in Manchester, New Hampshire, sent to substitute for a civil engineer at the Amoskeag Manufacturing Company who had become ill. The position soon became permanent. One of his first duties was laying out lots and streets for the new industrial city as envisioned by Amoskeag's cultured treasurer (president), William Amory. He also assisted with the construction of the dam and canal. In 1842, he founded the community's first Unitarian Society. Straw was sent by the mills to England and Scotland in November 1844 to gather information and machinery for manufacturing and printing muslin <b>delaines,</b> which the Manchester Print Works introduced to the United States.

5000|$|Undoubtedly the {{language}} of tariff acts is to be construed according to its commercial signification, but {{it will always be}} understood to have the same meaning in commerce that it has in the community at large, unless the contrary is shown. Swan v. Arthur, 103 U. S. 598. The most that can be claimed for the alleged reservation in Greenleaf v. Goodrich is {{that it would have been}} proper to inquire whether the phrase [...] "of similar description" [...] was a commercial term, and if so what it was understood by merchants and importers to mean. That, however, is not what was attempted in this case. The witnesses were asked in effect not what the words [...] "of similar description" [...] were understood among commercial men to mean, but whether the goods of these importers were known in commerce as goods of similar description to <b>delaines.</b>|$|R

2500|$|In {{the early}} 1900s, {{a surge of}} dry-land farmers arrived in the Catlow Valley. They were drawn by the {{prospect}} of free land offered by the federal government's Homestead Act.
