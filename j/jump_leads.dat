A few moments upon reaching the bus stop, a man waiting there suddenly has a heart attack, causing Bean to panic. Seeking to help revive him, he attempts to pump air into his chest with his foot, tries mouth-to-mouth resuscitation using the man's magazine as a funnel, and then pours several of the man's pills down his throat, but these methods don't work. He eventually uses electric shock treatment by borrowing some <b>jump</b> <b>leads</b> and connecting them to a nearby lamppost. Although this initially works, Bean forgets to remove the <b>jump</b> <b>leads</b> from his hands when the man offers a handshake, thereby electrocuting him and causing him to pass out.

The upper boundary, interestingly, is also where the temperature-dependent S Doradus instability strip intersects the bistability jump at about Teff ≃ 21 000 K.

40|$|We discuss an {{interesting}} {{feature of the}} distribution of luminous blue variables (LBVs) on the H-R diagram, and we propose a connection with the bistability jump seen in the winds of early-type supergiants. There appears to be a deficiency of quiescent LBVs on the S Doradus instability strip at luminosities between log(L/Lsolar) ~= 5. 6 and 5. 8. The upper boundary, interestingly, is also where the temperature-dependent S Doradus instability strip intersects the bistability jump at about Teff~= 21, 000 K. Because of increased opacity, winds of early-type supergiants are slower and denser on the cool side of the bistability jump, and we postulate that this may trigger optically thick winds that inhibit quiescent LBVs from residing there. We conduct numerical simulations of radiation-driven winds for a range of temperatures, masses, and velocity laws at log(L/Lsolar) = 5. 7 to see what effect the bistability jump should have.

The effect is strongest for LBVs approaching 10 Msolar, where the pseudophotospheres are sufficiently extended to make an early B-type star appear as a yellow hypergiant. Thus, the proposed mechanism will be most relevant for LBVs that are post-red supergiants [curiously, the upper boundary at log(L/Lsolar) ~= 5. 8 coincides with the upper luminosity limit for red supergiants]. Further work is obviously needed, especially with regard to a possible evolutionary connection between the ``missing'' LBVs and the most luminous red supergiants and yellow hypergiants. Specifically, yellow hypergiants such as IRC + 10420 and rho Cas occupy the same luminosity range as the missing LBVs and show apparent temperature variations at constant luminosity. If these yellow hypergiants do eventually become Wolf-Rayet stars, we speculate that they may skip the normal LBV phase, {{at least as far as}} their apparent positions on the H-R diagram are concerned...|$|E

We conjecture that "intelligent" coarse-grained learning operators emerge as a consequence of a self-organization process in neural systems, as follows.

The sum of these displacements constitutes a coarsegrained learning event.
