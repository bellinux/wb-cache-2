30|$|In {{just two}} decades {{before the end}} of the last millennium, digital {{technology}} has indeed reached a critical mass. But the digital revolution is more than just a revolution of expedience. The term that has come to encompass this revolution is “convergence”, the fruit of the <b>digital</b> <b>union</b> of telecommunications, information technology, the Internet, and consumer electronics. In this article, one of the authors was asked to analyze the importance of convergence: I say fusion, you say convergence, but both mean essentially that the resulting products are greater than the sum of their parts―or, as commonly said 1  +  1 makes 3. In the analog world, one cannot combine things easily. With digitization, we can make every conceivable combination, and end up with something much greater than just a simple merger. Based on the Webster dictionary, and also by Yoffie (1996), convergence is defined as the unification of functions―the coming together of previously distinct products which employ digital technologies.|$|E
40|$|Mobile {{internet}} {{represents a}} major new trend in communication technologies use and consumption, but few evidence exists that confirms claims of novelty and social change in association with this technology use. This paper characterizes the use of mobile internet in a southern European country and associated patterns of use, focusing both on users’ profiles, forms of access, motivations to use and most popular activities undertaken via this technology, from a diffusion of innovations and social adoption of technologies perspectives, and tries to compare mobile it with fixed {{access to the internet}} in order to validate possible transformations that point to new social configurations. We seek to understand the way stakeholders perceive and characterize the European context of mobile internet. The depicted study involved a qualitative stage consisting of a set of interviews with mobile communications industry representatives and market research community in the country. These interviews were analysed in Nvivo, leading to the following eleven main categories that are explored throughout the paper: smartphones in Europe, mobile internet in Europe, users profiles, obstacles to the spread, forms of access, forms of use, motivations to use mobile internet, limitations of smartphones, apps, digital divide VS <b>digital</b> <b>union</b> and predictions for the future, as well as several subcategories forming a tree categorization. According to the data collected, mobile phones’ sales are decreasing in Europe and worldwide {{but on the other hand}} smartphones are having an exponential growth which leads to the democratization of internet access via mobile devices. As a consequence of this, it is believed that mobile internet access will soon exceed the fixed one. Mobile internet users are multiplatform, they exploit all the possibilities of mobility and they are spending less time on computers. The main obstacles to the spread of mobile internet are the high prices of price plans and there is still a lack of information and knowledge regarding the service. Mobile internet users are developing new online surfing behaviours based on apps and less in browsers and social networks represent a very high share of internet traffic through mobile phones. With mobility, “dead time” is turning into useful time and users are more likely to be available to try new services and analyze products. Innovative services concerning geolocation, consumerism, share and relationships are growing and it is necessary to highlight that mobile internet allows calling and texting, which can turn telecommunications companies into the role of Dump Pipes. This exploratory design raises questions in relation with mobile internet access and its social consequences, and provides interesting indicative research results relevant for future research in this area...|$|E

40|$|There {{has been}} much debate on the {{interface}} between protection by technological protection measures (TPM) and substantive copyright law, and particularly so following the implementation of Article 6 of Directive 2001 / 29 /EC in national laws, 1 which provides the general framework for TPM protection in the European <b>Union.</b> <b>Digital</b> rights management's (DRM's) technological protection measures afford, on a factual level, absolute protection to information, functioning as a code to distinguish exclusion and inclusion. Normative rules endorsing and, indeed, supporting their application can hardly co-exist with a normative system that allocates rights only where certain clear conditions are met. It will be argued here that regulating TPMs {{as a means of}} enforcing copyright law is misguided, shifting the debate towards topoi relating exclusively to copyright as a system protecting individual creativity against what may roughly be identified as a public domain debate.

40|$|Mobile {{telecommunications}} {{markets are}} an important part of the European Commission’s strategy for the completion of the European <b>Union</b> <b>Digital</b> Single. The use of mobile telecommunications – particularly mobile data access – is growing and becoming an increasingly important input for the economy. - The EU currently does not have a unified mobile telecommunications market. The EU compares favourably to the United States in terms of prices and connection speed, but lags behind in terms of coverage of high-speed 4 G wireless connections. -Europe’s long-term goal should be to make data access easier by increasing highspeed wireless coverage while keeping prices down for users. An increase in cross-border competition could help to achieve that goal. - The Commission has two important levers to help stimulate cross-border supply:(a) ensuring competition in intra-country mobile markets in order to provide an incentive for operators to expand into other jurisdictions, and (b) reducing mobile operators’ costs of expansion into multiple EU countries. The further development of policies on international roaming and radio spectrum management will be central to this effort...|$|R
40|$|Eight {{online study}} {{activities}} that included elements of digital competences {{identified by the}} European <b>Union</b> <b>Digital</b> Competence (DIGCOMP) framework were delivered via an institutional Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) to examine whether the participants possessed the digital skills necessary for their studies and check whether the needed skills should be offered as a separated training course or be embedded in the normal curriculum. Designed along Gilly Salmon’s ‘e-Tivity’ model the activities were offered to 102 first-year Midwifery students {{as a part of}} their first-year study module taught by a number of tutors under the co-ordination of the module leader in two different campuses; the eight sessions comprised of: a) a pre-course bespoke, self-assessment questionnaire to establish the digital-competence potential across the groups and identify areas of interest, b) six technology-enhanced e-tivities representing short problem-based tasks on midwifery-related content aimed at revealing different aspects of digital competences and c) the final activity focussed on reviewing the student experience through short reflective diaries. The majority of the participants reported that they gained or refreshed skills, characterised the tasks as ‘interesting’, ‘enjoyable and motivating their learning’, and declared their preference for the use of multimedia. Some of them liked the honing of self-directed learning skills and only a small number reported that the activities did not stretch enough to enhance the already possessed skills. A few reported distracted by non-facilitated online delivery of the activities and required clarification about the depth and the breadth of the needed detail. The same participants often expressed positive and negative experiences deriving from technology-use, appreciation for the increase of communication channels on offer, referred to self-awareness, to the impact of new technological developments, the social media, and the impact of challenging tasks; however, others thought that technological skills could be time-consuming to manage and that the availability of technology did not necessarily result in its increased use in demanding situations. It was extensively agreed that training and support for the use of technology were very important. As to the provision of feedback positive experiences summarised the need for meaningful and timely feedback, while others complained about the lack of direct communication with the tutors and requested examples to enable their better understanding {{on the nature of the}} work that had to be done. Group work was appreciated as it allowed acquaintance with the peers, the sharing of knowledge and skills, the exchanging of ideas and other. Networking and socialising with colleagues were well received, group-work tasks were seen as an ice-breaker and team-formation dynamics were identified when people were asked to work together; difficulties in participation were reported only by those who lived far from the university campus. From a pedagogic perspective comments were positive for information and research literacies, information dissemination and critical evaluation of the sources; only few stated preference for a standardised list of resources. Although the VLE was found easy to use, some problems reported when dealing with video files. The utilisation of various digital devices mainly concerned the participants’ needed technological skills and at the beginning some felt discouraged by the quality of work their more technically able peers presented. In conclusion two factors should be carefully examined: a) the lack of protected time within the curriculum delivery to undertake the activities and b) the lack of an accreditation scheme...|$|R
40|$|The {{communication}} {{of the results}} of scientific research, and in many ways, research itself have changed in recent years as digital means of information production, distribution and access have become widespread. Paper preprints have been replaced by electronic archives, mail and phone calls by e-mail, typewriters and hand drawing by text and graphics software programs, cabinet files by saved directories on hard disks. These new tools, together with multimedia presentations and conference websites, constitute the growing digital network of information that is taking over many aspects of the working place of research. It is a system in which the information flow is regulated, integrated and made available by the software and the network. This digital network of research is currently organized in three layers: - Repositories of information: open archives and databases. This first level is the analogous of library and publishers stacks. - Services over and for information: e. g. review journal, cross-citation. They are the analogous of, for instance, library desks and paper journals. - <b>Digital</b> communities: synergic <b>union</b> of services and information. Ideally, they replace your desktop environment by giving access to the tools you use in your everyday work. In this talk we will present Torii, a system that gives direct access to the digital research community. All tools and documents the user need are collected under an unified access point, organized according to his needs and ready for him everywhere he is are and at any time he may need them. An intuitive user interface helps the user to navigate. All the tools the user need are at his finger tips. Choice of archives and subjects are easily costumized to fit his interests. This platform grows as the digital community grows. New features will be added as they become available in the future. The personal folder is the hub of the system. The user can store his documents here for future reference or to be printed or sent to others. The personal folder is easy to use by means of its drag-and-drop interface. It ideally replaces the cabinet filer where paper documents used to be stored. Stored documents can be ranked according to his profiles, impact factors or evaluation tools. The user will find in his personal folder new documents suggested by the social filtering engine and he can attach to any documents comments for himself or to be shared by the community. Documents to be manipulated can be organised in a multi-layered stack. It could be an entry in a database, and as a new layer is added so is the entry column modified in the database, or it could be a collection of documents managed by a web server that keeps track of their relationships and modifications. The access to a multi-layered document is dynamical. According to who the user is at a given moment [...] -reader, author, referee, editor [...] -he has access to different layers. Dynamical access requires an appropriate interface between the multi-layered documents and the users. It also requires intelligent agents to sift through the increasingly large amount of information to shape it into some hierarchy and thus making it usable. Key features for the integration of dynamic access to the informationinto the portal are the XML language and the Open Archive Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH). The XML language is used to encapsulate in a common structure the exchanged information, originally stored in a variety of formats. This XML metadata structure represents the semantic aspects related to the data. The OAI-PMH defines a HTTP-based mechanism for harvesting XML files containing metadata from repositories. This is the basic communication protocol between Torii and the underlying services, operating in a location-transparent way. Through the use of the OAI-PMH, Torii will be easily extensible to any archive implementing the protocol. In a user-friendly information society, the information overload is limited and the information delivery is personalized: the broad-casting of information is replaced by a more effective narrow-casting and mass-media are replaced by personal media tailored to each user's needs. These aims can be reached by more effective systems for information access. Torii provides a filtering component to skim too large a set of retrieved information and thus providing the user only with the information nearest to his interests. In Torii the user defines his research interest profiles by filling in a form;from this a user profile is derived, based on a semantic network. The profile is automatically updated every time the user provides explicit relevance feedback on some new documents. Documents to be evaluated by the cognitive filtering module are processed through information extraction techniques aimed at capturing the meaning of the document content. These techniques exploit linguistic processing and statistical analysis. Every day the filtering module filters the submissions to the archives accordingly to the user profiles and the graphical user interface provides tools to rank displayed documents accordingly to the user's profiles. Out of the 30 - 50 daily submissions, the user is able to see the 3 - 4 most relevant {{at the top of the}} list. Social filtering circulates interesting documents among users who share interests. It automatically feeds in the personal folder those documents that are potentially relevant for the user. The relevance of the documents is evaluated for similarity with the selections done by other users with similar interests. The process is the digital analogous of sharing paper among colleagues. It fosters the growth of the digital community. Quality control tools memorize and exploit human evaluation of documents. They provide users with the possibility to express their evaluation of a document by filling in a predefined form and writing free textual comments. The form results are used to statistically evaluate numerical scores about the scientific quality of the document, the comments are general, each user can choose whether his comment will be public or for himself. Users can read all public comments on a document. These tools embody a first instance of open peer review in which the community as a whole participate in the review process. A search engine, Okapi, is accessed directly from Torii. It offers a sophisticated search environment where you can look and search among the more than 150, 000 documents currently stored in the archives. Okapi offers advanced retrieval mechanisms based on the probabilistic model of retrieval and relevance feedback. It runs on both the document metadata and their full text. It is fast and accurate. An assistant monitors the user search and helps him with helpful hints and terminological and contextual suggestions. It alerts the user for dead-end searches leading to hundreds of documents or no document at all. The user is made aware of strategic aspects of searching that allow him to fully exploit all information resources and services. The assistant comes fully integrated into the Okapi search engine of Torii. Torii integrates also iCite. This tool extracts all citations from all the documents submitted to the archives. These are used to rank documents in Torii so that you can order them according to their impact factors. It is a completely automatic system that creates a net of cross-references inside the archives. It is an instance of service, the second level of the three-layer structure, that can also be accessed independently at icite. sissa. it to search for citations patterns and ranking. Torii is ready to move on into the future of digital networking. As the next generation of wireless systems comes into production, Torii will be accessible from the user mobile phone. The user can connect already and use it via WAP at torii. sissa. it/wml/ia. wml but the full potentiality of the system must wait for the 3 G broad bandwidth to come into being. At that point, the user will be able to browse documents use his personal folder and any other of the features of Torii as he travel. More information about Torii can be found at: [URL]...|$|R
