500|$|The film premiered at the Lido Theater, a cinema in Newport Beach, California. It was {{released}} in the United States in June 1941. Up till at least January 1942, screenings of the film were still available at cinemas. It was re-screened in September 1957 at the Apollo Theatre. It received mixed reviews from contemporary film critics. A reviewer for Variety wrote, [...] "Saddled with sophomoric episodes and dialog, The Medico of Painted Springs will find a groove for Saturday matinees, where the <b>kids</b> <b>will</b> stand for anything as long as it's western." ...|$|E
500|$|David Calvert-Smith, for the prosecution, {{alleged that}} the detectives' {{supposedly}} contemporaneous notes of the fifth interview with Silcott had been altered after the fact to include the self-incriminating remarks. Silcott had refused to answer questions during the first four interviews. During the fifth, when told there were witness statements that he had struck Blakelock with a machete or similar, the notes show him saying: [...] "Those <b>kids</b> <b>will</b> never go to court.

500|$|In the DVD {{commentary}} for the episode, Gould says that, {{when the}} team were thinking {{of a way to}} start the show, George Meyer said, [...] "I like how <b>kids</b> <b>will</b> just dig a hole". Homer's story ends with a Chinese satellite spying on Bart. This was an attempt by Gould to write a bizarre joke in the style of fellow Simpsons writer John Swartzwelder. Moe's plot in the second act was also created by Meyer, who suggested that the bartending school that Moe attended would resemble the law school on the 1970s television series The Paper Chase, and that the school's professor would be based on the professor from the earlier series.|$|E

Cyma Zarghami, president of Nickelodeon, said [...] "One {{of the great things about}} animation is that you can play it over and over again, and <b>kids</b> <b>will</b> still watch it [...] With live action they won't."

500|$|Roy Hrab of DVD Verdict was {{positive}} on the season, but wrote [...] "I {{do not think}} that adults will be as entertained as in previous seasons. The comedy is more targeted at the kids than in the past." [...] In particular, Hrab cited the episode [...] "Rise and Shine" [...] as [...] "tiresome (for adults, anyway; <b>kids</b> <b>will</b> enjoy it)." [...] In conclusion, he said [...] "there's nothing new here and adults will be disappointed, but the latest installment of SpongeBob SquarePants delivers a lot of silly and good-natured fun for the kids and there's nothing wrong with that." [...] In the Volume 2 review also for the DVD Verdict, Dennis Prince said [...] " [...] is not the series' best work but, nevertheless, is an improvement".

[...] Mavis also praised the voice actors who contributed on the show, and wrote [...] "As funny as the stories are, and in this collection, there are some real gems, I can't stress enough the importance of those voice talents in conveying the unhinged, manic quality that is so integral to the success of SpongeBob SquarePants. In a separate review for the Volume 2 DVD, Mavis only [...] "recommended" [...] the set and wrote [...] "SpongeBob may, and I repeat, 'may,' be starting to level off."

On 18 December, the Sunday Express published a similarly glowing review, in which {{the concept of the}} Zero-X mission to Mars was described as [...] "awesome" [...] and visuals commended: [...] "Of course, the cast are all puppets, the sets, models, and the story unabashed nonsense.

500|$|Stacy Brooks, then-president of the Lisa McPherson Trust, stated: [...] "There's no {{way that}} this movie would be {{happening}} without Scientology's backing… This {{is one example of}} how Scientology insinuates itself in various aspects of the culture." [...] Mark Bunker characterized the film as a recruitment tactic for the Church of Scientology, stating, [...] "It's designed to introduce L. Ron Hubbard to a whole new generation of kids. It's there to plant a favorable seed in children's minds." [...] Bunker criticized the promotional methods of the film—instead of granting interviews about the film to the press, John Travolta went on a book tour and signed copies of L. Ron Hubbard's novel. Bunker stated, [...] "When Michael Caine goes around to promote The Cider House Rules, he doesn't tour bookstores and sign copies of John Irving's novel… Through the movie tie-in with the book, <b>kids</b> <b>will</b> send in the card to get their free poster, and eventually be introduced to Dianetics." [...] Scientologist Nancy O'Meara, at the time treasurer of the Foundation for Religious Freedom and currently treasurer of the Scientology-run New Cult Awareness Network, responded to Bunker's statement: [...] "Gimme a break… That's like saying people are going to go see Gladiator and then suddenly find themselves wanting to explore Christianity." ...|$|E

While revisiting his old haunts, he runs into his old friend Jerry Connolly, played by O'Brien, {{who is now a}} priest {{concerned}} about the Dead End Kids' futures, particularly as they idolize Rocky. After a messy shootout, Sullivan is eventually captured by the police and sentenced to death in the electric chair. Connolly pleads with Rocky to [...] "turn yellow" [...] {{on his way to the}} chair so the <b>Kids</b> <b>will</b> lose their admiration for him, and hopefully avoid turning to crime. Sullivan refuses, but on his way to his execution, he breaks down and begs for his life. It is unclear whether this cowardice is real or just feigned for the Kids' benefit. Cagney himself refused to say, insisting he liked the ambiguity. The film is regarded by many as one of Cagney's finest, and garnered him an Academy Award for Best Actor nomination for 1938. He lost to Spencer Tracy in Boys Town. Cagney had been considered for the role, but lost out on it due to his typecasting. (He also lost the role of Notre Dame football coach Knute Rockne in Knute Rockne, All American to his friend Pat O'Brien for the same reason.) Cagney did, however, win that year's New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actor.|$|E

[...] He graded the songs performed [...] "C−" [...] through to [...] "A−", commending what he deemed [...] "by far the greatest performance of [...] "Ice Ice Baby" [...] ever". The Houston Chronicle Bobby Hankinson also felt the episode was a return to form. He praised the decision not to [...] "apply meaningless rules to their musical selections", writing: [...] "The freedom to not have to use songs by one artist let the storylines take priority, and not sticking to songs that share a common lyrical theme kept those choices from feeling too forced." [...] Dave Itzkoff of the New York Times recapped the episode positively, describing it as: [...] "pack more camp into an hour's worth of television than most <b>kids</b> <b>will</b> get all summer." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club graded [...] "Bad Reputation" [...] "B+", writing that he: [...] "enjoyed the episode quite a bit, even as [...] found some of it rather messy." [...] Though VanDerWerff felt that not everything in the episode worked, he stated: [...] "the stuff that did reminded me that what I like about the show is its all-out embrace of a crazy mishmash of tones." ...|$|E
