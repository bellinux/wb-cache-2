40|$|Whether direct {{exposure}} to different concentrations (0 %, 13 %, 100 %) of oxygen may affect horse erythrocyte membrane fluidity (EMF) and fatty acid (FA) composition was studied during 1 (T 60) and 2 h (T 120) exposure. EMF was investigated {{at the head}} group level and hydrophobic core thanks to phosphorus nucleus 31 (P- 31) nuclear magnetic resonance (P- 31 NMR) and electronic paramagnetic resonance (EPR) using two spin probes: 5 -nitroxydestearic acid and 16 -doxylstearic acid. Lipid structure of the membranes was studied by gas liquid chromatography. 4 -Hydroxy- 2 E-nonenal was also analyzed as a marker of lipid peroxidation. It increased at T 120 13 % and 100 % oxygen whereas {{there were no significant}} changes in membrane dynamic or structure. Correlation was demonstrated between EMF and partial pressure of oxygen in the blood (P-O 2). In vitro <b>high</b> <b>rate</b> of <b>oxygenation</b> was efficient to induce lipid peroxidation but did not change membrane dynamics. This may be due to a low free radical production in vitro or to the high red blood cells antioxidant properties. (c) 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
30|$|Patients were {{enrolled}} in this study {{in conjunction with a}} clinical trial in mechanical ventilation, the “ARDSnet Protocol versus Open Lung Approach in ARDS” trial (NCT 00431158) [7]. The institutional review committee approved the study that included the follow-up, and informed consent was obtained from each patient or legal representative. Briefly, this was a randomized controlled trial in which patients were ventilated with a ARDSnet protocol, which uses low tidal volumes, relatively <b>high</b> respiratory <b>rates,</b> with <b>oxygenation</b> managed according to PEEP and FIO 2 relationships as defined in a table, or with an open lung approach strategy, which uses a technique to recruit collapsed lung areas and then uses the lowest PEEP level that prevents recollapse of recruited lung units, being the best PEEP level determined by a decremental PEEP trial involving a series of pressure measurements taken after the recruitment maneuver. Both the ARDSnet protocol and the open lung approach require low tidal volumes and plateau pressures. In conclusion, open lung approach improved oxygenation and driving pressure, without detrimental effects on mortality, ventilator-free days or barotrauma.|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn vitro {{microfluidic}} {{systems are}} increasingly {{used as an}} alternative to standard Petri dishes in bioengineering and metabolomic investigations, as they are expected to provide cellular environments close to the in vivo conditions. In this work, we combined the recently developed "metabolomics-on-a-chip" approach with metabolic flux analysis to model the metabolic network of the hepatoma HepG 2 /C 3 A cell line and to infer the distribution of intracellular metabolic fluxes in standard Petri dishes and microfluidic biochips. A high pyruvate reduction to lactate was observed in both systems, suggesting that the cells operate in oxygen-limited environments. Our results also indicate that HepG 2 /C 3 A cells in the biochip are characterized by a <b>higher</b> consumption <b>rate</b> of oxygen, presumably due to a <b>higher</b> <b>oxygenation</b> <b>rate</b> in the microfluidic environment. This leads to a higher entry of the ultimate glycolytic product, acetyl-CoA, into the Krebs cycle. These findings are supported by the transcriptional activity of HepG 2 /C 3 A cells in both systems since we observed that genes regulated by a HIF- 1 (hypoxia-regulated factor- 1) transcriptional factor were over expressed under the Petri conditions, but to a lesser extent in the biochip...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the expression of}} emotions while teaching {{in relation to a}} teacher’s physiological changes. We used polyvagal theory (PVT) to frame the study of teaching in a teacher education program. Donna, a teacher-researcher, experienced high levels of stress and anxiety prior to beginning to teach and throughout the lesson we used her expressed emotions as a focus for this research. We adopted event-oriented inquiry in a study of heart <b>rate,</b> <b>oxygenation</b> of the blood, and expressed emotions. Five events were identified for multilevel analysis in which we used narrative, prosodic analysis, and hermeneutic-phenomenological methods {{to learn more about the}} expression of emotions when Donna had: <b>high</b> heart <b>rate</b> (before and while teaching); low blood oxygenation (before and while teaching); and high blood oxygenation (while teaching). What we learned was consistent with the body’s monitoring system recognizing social harm and switching to the control of the unmyelinated vagus nerve, thereby shutting down organs and muscles associated with social communication – leading to irregularities in prosody and expression of emotion. In events involving <b>high</b> heart <b>rate</b> and low blood oxygenation the physiological environment was associated with less effective and sometimes confusing patterns in prosody, including intonation, pace of speaking, and pausing. In a low blood oxygenation environment there was evidence of rapid speech and shallow, irregular breathing. In contrast, during an event in which 100 % blood oxygenation occurred, prosody was perceived to be conducive to engagement and the teacher expressed positive emotions, such as satisfaction, while teaching. Becoming aware of the purposes of the research and the results we obtained provided the teacher with tools to enact changes to her teaching practice, especially prosody of the voice. We regard it as a high priority to create tools to allow teachers and students, if and as necessary, to ameliorate excess emotions, and change heart <b>rate,</b> <b>oxygenation</b> levels, and breathing patterns...|$|R
