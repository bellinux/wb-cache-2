25|$|The Re.2000 were {{assigned}} to Squadriglia di Riserva Aerea delle FF.NN.BB. (air reserve squadron for naval battleships), led by Captain Donato Tondi. This was initially based at Grottaglie, then at Capodichino and finally at La Spezia, as air defence for naval bases. The squadron disbanded on April 1943 {{and was replaced by}} the 1° Gr. Riserva Aerea delle FF.NN.BB, led by now Maj. Tondi, with three flights. <b>It</b> <b>had</b> <b>all</b> the eight Re.2000s and several old fighters. Many of them were aboard the battleships: two for Vittorio Veneto and Roma, one for Littorio (summer 1943).|$|E

25|$|The {{machine gun}} is {{typically}} {{considered to be}} a fully automatic firearm, usually designed to fire rifle cartridges in quick succession from an ammunition belt or large-capacity magazine. The Gatling gun, invented and patented in 1861 by Richard Gatling during the American Civil War, was the earliest precursor to a machine gun in the sense that <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>all</b> of the underlying features of reliable loading as well as the ability to fire sustained multiple bursts of rounds, the only drawback being, it had to be manually operated and hand-cranked unlike its 1884 successor, the Maxim gun, which was indisputably the world's first true machine gun.|$|E
25|$|Adams was {{appointed}} as West Indies captain in 2000, replacing Brian Lara. He would not last long, leading {{the team to}} a 5–0 series loss on the 2000/01 tour of Australia; after the tour he lost both the captaincy (to Carl Hooper) and {{his place in the}} national team. News of his impending termination was broken to Adams by friend and national TV reporter, Peter Furst. The ever-cool Jamaican simply responded, ¨Have you heard something I haven't?¨ He then reflected on his career, saying that whatever happened <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>all</b> been a blessing – both the good and bad. Adams´ grace {{in the face of what}} would crush many a lesser person reflects the nature of the man; a cricketer whose best attributes can never be recorded on the score sheets.|$|E
25|$|On 20 June 1989, a sack {{filled with}} {{dynamite}} sticks was discovered near a beach house Falcone had rented {{in the town}} of Addaura by policeman Nino Agostino. Although Falcone had been threatened before, this failed attempt bothered him in the extreme because <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>all</b> the signs of an inside job. At the time, he was meeting Swiss prosecutors Carla Del Ponte and Claudio Lehman from Lugano who were helping to investigate the Mafia's financial holdings in Switzerland. Falcone believed that the assassination attempt not only involved the Mafia but some people in government as well. During the investigations into the money laundering networks of the Mafia, it became clear that former Palermo police chief Bruno Contrada who had moved to the intelligence service SISDE had warned a suspect about his impending arrest so that he could escape in time.|$|E

25|$|The {{interior}} was also completely redesigned for 1992. The Taurus received a new dashboard that, like the previous generation, {{was designed to}} be user friendly. Like the previous generation, <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>all</b> of the vehicle's main controls located near {{the left side of the}} dash, to be within the easy reach of the driver. Also like the previous generation, all of the controls were designed to be recognizable by touch, and to be operated by the driver without taking their eyes off the road. The new dash also contained three buttons to the right of the gauge cluster that allowed the driver to operate the radio without taking their eyes off the road. The radio was also redesigned, while the rest of the lower dash was carried over from the previous generation, as was the steering wheel. The new dash was also designed to contain a passenger's side airbag, a first of its kind. It was optional in 1991 in 1992 models, and became standard in 1993, making the Taurus the first car of its kind to have dual front airbags.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} positive reviews. Rowan Kaiser, {{writing for}} The A.V. Club, gave a glowing review, saying that <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>all</b> the components that a season premiere should have. After praising {{many aspects of}} the episode, the reviewer wrote, [...] "What ties it all together, though, is a storytelling form that indicates complete confidence from the show about what its viewers can deal with. It's half present-day, half-flashback. But the two different halves, combined with Veronica's voiceover, combine to present the information in pleasantly deceptive fashion." ...|$|E
500|$|SFX Magazine Jordan Farley {{gave the}} episode 3 {{and a half}} out of 5 stars, saying the {{direction}} [...] "never quite [...] the right balance between absurdist humour and sinister nightmare" [...] and the camera was [...] "a little flat" [...] with a strange angle. He was displeased with the discovery that <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>all</b> been a hallucination and stated that Rory's death and other instances of horror [...] "never shock {{in the way you}} might expect". However, he praised Smith for being [...] "on blindingly good form" [...] while portraying the Doctor's quirkier traits, considered that Gillan and Darvill were [...] "fast becoming the most likeable companion couple in Doctor Who history", and said Jones was [...] "a lot of fun to watch" [...] despite not seeming to be completely the Doctor's dark side.|$|E

500|$|George Avaros and Michael Liedtke {{from the}} Contra Costa Times were overall {{positive}} towards the episode, saying <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>all</b> the features which created a [...] "superb X-Files episode". They further {{stated that it}} had an [...] "eerie, almost surreal quality sprinkled with pithy dialogue, comic relief and cryptic insights into key characters that left us wondering what sort of trouble might be around the bend". Avaros and Liedtke also reacted positively to the numerous references to Fox Mulder. Finally, the episode was compared {{to the work of}} David Lynch in his series, Twin Peaks. Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a moderately positive review and awarded it two-and-a-half stars out of four. She noted that, [...] "'Via Negativa' is short on plot but makes up for it by being [...] long on atmosphere and mood, conjuring up a number of disgusting, eerie images".|$|E
500|$|Reviewing {{the first}} single [...] "Identity", CDJournal reviewers gave the single their star of approval, calling it the [...] "highest [...] pop music" [...] and a future anthem for Sakanaction. They praised the [...] "radical but {{considered}} electro sound" [...] and the [...] "danceable" [...] four on the floor beat. They praised Yamaguchi's [...] "unique" [...] lyrical sense, as well as Yamaguchi's vocals {{at the start of}} the chorus as he sang the word dōshite, feeling it was [...] "intense". Sumire Hanatsuka of Skream! felt that the song blended a Latin rhythm with the [...] "spirits of a Japanese festival". For the song's B-side, featured as a bonus track on the album, reviewer Yuichi Hirayama described the song as [...] "an electro tune demanding an escape from anguish", feeling that <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>all</b> of the [...] "power" [...] of [...] "Identity" [...] and the other band's singles. Reviewing the [...] "Like a Live" [...] remix found as the bonus track on Documentaly, CDJournal reviewers praised the song's [...] "rhyme-like wordplay and exhilarating sound".|$|E
500|$|Matters {{came to a}} head in London in May in {{what became}} known as the [...] "Victoria Station incident". Arriving in an open-top Mercedes convertible, Bowie waved to the crowd in a gesture that some alleged was a Nazi salute, which was {{captured}} on camera and published in NME. Bowie said the photographer simply caught him in mid-wave. He later blamed his pro-fascism comments and his behaviour during the period on his addictions and the character of the Thin White Duke. [...] "I was out of my mind, totally crazed. The main thing I was functioning on was mythology... that whole thing about Hitler and Rightism... I'd discovered King Arthur". According to playwright Alan Franks, writing later in The Times, [...] "he was indeed 'deranged'. He had some very bad experiences with hard drugs." [...] Bowie's cocaine addiction, which had caused these controversies, had much to do with his time living in Los Angeles, a city which alienated him hugely. Discussing his flirtations with fascism in a 1980 interview with NME, Bowie explained that Los Angeles was [...] "where <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>all</b> happened. The fucking place should be wiped off the face of the Earth. To be anything to do with rock and roll and go and live in Los Angeles is, I think, just heading for disaster. It really is." ...|$|E
