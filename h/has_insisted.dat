5|$|Chase's {{decision}} {{to end the}} last episode abruptly with just a black screen was controversial. While Chase <b>has</b> <b>insisted</b> {{that it was not}} his intention to stir controversy, the ambiguity over the ending and question of whether Tony was murdered has continued for years after the finale's original broadcast and has spawned numerous websites devoted to finding out his true intention.|$|E
5|$|One vocalist whose {{status is}} disputed, {{both inside and}} outside Black Sabbath, is Christian evangelist and former Joshua frontman, Jeff Fenholt. Fenholt <b>has</b> <b>insisted</b> that he was a singer in Black Sabbath between January and May 1985. Tony Iommi has never {{confirmed}} this. Fenholt gives a detailed account of his time with Iommi and Sabbath in Garry Sharpe-Young's book Sabbath Bloody Sabbath: The Battle for Black Sabbath.|$|E
5|$|Larry tells Darrin that Mr. Brockway <b>has</b> <b>insisted</b> that Darrin {{be removed}} from the account. Darrin and Samantha host a Christmas party which Larry, Keith, and Dorothy attend. When Mr. Brockway arrives, he sees Darrin and Dorothy {{standing}} next to each other and assumes they are married to each other. When Mr. Brockway realizes his mistake, and that Darrin is instead married to Samantha, Mr. Brockway tells Larry that he is willing to allow Darrin back on the account. After discovering that Mr. Brockway initially was unwilling because he thought Darrin was married to an African-American woman, Larry rejects Mr. Brockway's offer. Mr. Brockway expresses disbelief that anyone would reject such a lucrative account. Through witchcraft, Samantha causes Mr. Brockway to see everyone in the room, including himself, as having black skin. On Christmas Day, while the Wilsons are visiting the Stephens, Mr. Brockway arrives, apologizes for his previous actions, and repents of his racism. Samantha invites Mr. Brockway to join them for Christmas dinner, and he accepts.|$|E

5|$|Neuner's {{shooting}} performances {{have been}} a regular topic in the German media. At times she {{has been reluctant to}} discuss her shooting in interviews and has said the public's fixation on it contributes to the problem. She <b>has</b> <b>insisted</b> her difficulties in the standing position are not due to technical weaknesses but psychological, and her training results are just as good as the results of her team mates. She explained in interviews that she had developed a fear of the standing shooting over time, knowing she had to justify herself after the race if she missed. In 2008, Neuner trained with Bundeswehr shooting coach and former large calibre world champion, Rudi Krenn, and subsequently changed her stance slightly. Since 2009, she has worked with a psychologist, primarily focusing on mental techniques to build her confidence on the shooting range. Her standing position average has improved from 60% to 75% from 2008 to 2011. Neuner has been wearing ear plugs during some of the races in order to better concentrate while shooting. The individual race, which places a high emphasis on shooting, has traditionally been her worst discipline (each shooting error results in a one-minute time penalty, instead of a penalty loop).|$|E
25|$|Most Republicans support {{school choice}} through charter schools and school {{vouchers}} for private schools; denounce {{the performance of}} the urban public school system and the teachers' unions. The party <b>has</b> <b>insisted</b> on a system of greater accountability for public schools, most prominently in recent years with the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001. Many Republicans, including Ronald Reagan, opposed the creation of the United States Department of Education when it was initially created in 1979.|$|E
25|$|The EU {{has been}} more {{critical}} of Israel and more supportive of the Palestinians than the US. The general position of the EU is that a Palestinian state {{should be based on}} the 1967 borders with land swaps, Jerusalem should be divided and become the capital of both states, and a negotiated settlement be found for the Palestinian refugee issue, although member states have sometimes been divided on these issues. However, all EU states universally consider Israeli settlements illegal under international law. The EU <b>has</b> <b>insisted</b> that it will not recognize any changes to the 1967 borders other than those agreed between the parties. Israel's settlement program has, thus, led to tensions. The most difficult of these issues, however, is Jerusalem. Israel <b>has</b> <b>insisted</b> that the city will remain its undivided capital, and is fiercely opposed to its re-division. Israel does not regard Jewish neighborhoods in East Jerusalem as settlements, while the EU does. East Jerusalem has been a de facto part of Israel following Israel's unilateral annexation of the area, while the EU, {{along with the rest of}} the international community, regards it as occupied territory subject to negotiations. The EU has frequently criticized Jewish construction in East Jerusalem.|$|E

25|$|The {{authorities}} {{have refused to}} grant a permit to Bersih to hold the rally at Padang Merdeka in Kuching and advised Bersih to seek alternative venues. Bersih <b>has</b> <b>insisted</b> that the rally in Padang Merdeka will go ahead despite the government's refusal {{to give them a}} permit, otherwise they have suggested the rally would be Song Kheng Hai recreational ground or Jubilee Ground Stadium. Bersih has been given the approval by the authorities to hold the Kuching rally at Song Kheng Hai field at Song Kheng Hai Food and Recreational Centre.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time this was happening, Gilani resumed work as a DEA {{informant}} in New York City and participated in an undercover operation that reportedly led to the seizure of one kilo of heroin. Yet despite working for a U.S. government agency, Gilani actively raised money and recruited new members for LeT, a group that swore allegiance with Al-Qaeda. Gilani would later testify that he discussed his views regarding Kashmir—the focus of LeT's militant activities —with his DEA handlers. The DEA <b>has</b> <b>insisted</b> that it was unaware of Gilani's political and religious radicalization.|$|E
25|$|The {{most recent}} {{expansion}} {{occurred in the}} summer of 2017, with Las Vegas, Nevada, gaining the league's 31st team, the Vegas Golden Knights. Bettman later explained that the NHL's new divisional alignment precluded the adding of more franchises in the Eastern Time Zone {{at least for the time}} being. As of 2017, Bettman is widely believed to be waiting for a viable franchise proposal to emerge from Seattle or some other market outside the Eastern Time Zone to balance the divisions, although the commissioner <b>has</b> <b>insisted</b> that further expansion is not on the League's short-term agenda.|$|E

25|$|Gilani {{managed to}} beat his {{addiction}} to heroin, {{but was still}} involved in the drug trade. In early 1997, Gilani was arrested with another man in a DEA sting operation {{when he tried to}} smuggle heroin into the country from Pakistan. Gilani quickly offered his services as a confidential informant to the DEA. In January 1998, the agency sent him to Pakistan to dispel suspicions amongst his partners about his prior absence, and to gain intelligence on the country's heroin trafficking networks. According to the DEA, Gilani's participation led to five arrests and the seizure of 2½ kilos of heroin. The DEA <b>has</b> <b>insisted</b> that Gilani's 1998 trip to Pakistan was the only one paid for by the agency.|$|E
25|$|Gorbachev's {{policies}} of glasnost ("openness") and perestroika ("restructuring") and his reorientation of Soviet strategic aims {{contributed to the}} end of the Cold War. Under this program, the role of the Communist Party in governing the state was removed from the constitution, which inadvertently led to crisis-level political instability with a surge of regional nationalist and anti-communist activism culminating in the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Gorbachev later expressed regret for his failure to save the USSR, though he <b>has</b> <b>insisted</b> that his policies were not failures but rather were vitally necessary reforms which were sabotaged and exploited by opportunists. He was awarded the Otto Hahn Peace Medal in 1989, the Nobel Peace Prize in 1990 and the Harvey Prize in 1992, as well as honorary doctorates from various universities.|$|E
25|$|To address {{concerns}} that its enrichment program may be diverted to non-peaceful uses, Iran {{has offered to}} place additional restrictions on its enrichment program including, for example, ratifying the Additional Protocol to allow more stringent inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency, operating the uranium enrichment facility at Natanz as a multinational fuel center with the participation of foreign representatives, renouncing plutonium reprocessing and immediately fabricating all enriched uranium into reactor fuel rods. Iran's offer to open its uranium enrichment program to foreign private and public participation mirrors suggestions of an IAEA expert committee which was formed to investigate the methods {{to reduce the risk}} that sensitive fuel cycle activities could contribute to national nuclear weapons capabilities. Some non-governmental U.S. experts have endorsed this approach. The United States <b>has</b> <b>insisted</b> that Iran must meet the demands of the UN Security Council to suspend its enrichment program.|$|E

25|$|Poirot {{is asked}} for {{assistance}} {{by a young}} lady, Diana Maberly. She was engaged to marry Hugh Chandler {{for over a year}} but he has broken it off as he thinks he is going mad. There is a history of insanity in the family, with his grandfather and a great aunt being afflicted, and his father, Admiral Chandler, <b>has</b> <b>insisted</b> his son leave the Navy before his condition gets worse but the reason was hidden under the pretext of having to manage the family country estate – a reason no one believed, including Colonel Frobisher, a family friend and Hugh's godfather. At Poirot's prompting, Diana admits that there have been some unusual occurrences on nearby farms with the throats of sheep cut and the like but insists {{it has nothing to do}} with the situation. The Admiral refuses to let a doctor see his son.|$|E
25|$|The United States {{is being}} asked by the European Union (EU) and the {{developing}} countries, led by Brazil and India, to make a more generous offer for reducing trade-distorting domestic support for agriculture. The United States is insisting that the EU and the developing countries agree to make more substantial reductions in tariffs and {{to limit the number}} of import-sensitive and special products that would be exempt from cuts. Import-sensitive products are of most concern to developed countries like the European Union, while developing countries are concerned with special products – those exempt from both tariff cuts and subsidy reductions because of development, food security, or livelihood considerations. Brazil has emphasized reductions in trade-distorting domestic subsidies, especially by the United States (some of which it successfully challenged in the WTO U.S.-Brazil cotton dispute), while India <b>has</b> <b>insisted</b> on a large number of special products that would not be exposed to wider market opening.|$|E
25|$|In late 2013, it was {{reported}} that Outkast would reunite at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in 2014. This was later confirmed on January 8, 2014, when it was officially announced that the duo would headline the festival on April 11 and 18. It was later announced on January 13, 2014 that Outkast would be performing at more than 40 festivals around the world throughout {{the spring and summer of}} 2014 to celebrate their 20th anniversary, including one of the largest festivals in the UK, Bestival. Despite rumors, Big Boi <b>has</b> <b>insisted</b> that the duo are not currently working on a new album together. Outkast returned to Atlanta for their #ATLast homecoming shows over the weekend of September 26, 2014, selling out within minutes of tickets going on sale. The shows had a large variety of openers, ranging from R singer Janelle Monáe and rapper/rock artist Kid Cudi to rappers 2 Chainz, Future, Bun B, and Childish Gambino. Outkast's Dungeon Family associates Sleepy Brown and Big Gipp also appeared onstage with the duo, rapping and singing on their respective songs.|$|E

25|$|A 13-year-old {{junior high}} school student from Niigata, Megumi Yokota, was kidnapped by North Korea on November 15, 1977. In {{addition}} to her, many other Japanese citizens were kidnapped by North Korean agents. In 2002, North Korea admitted to kidnapping 13 Japanese citizens during the 1970s and 1980s, {{in order to train}} spies to infiltrate U.S. military installations in Japan. Five people have been released, but the North Korean government claimed that there were eight dead. Japan has pressed for the return of the bodies. However, the Japanese government believes that there are still kidnapped Japanese citizens being held captive in North Korea. North Korea's official statement is that the issue has been settled. Because of the overwhelming number of South Koreans also kidnapped by North Korea, there have been some joint efforts by South Korea and Japan to retrieve their citizens. The issue remains unresolved, however Japan <b>has</b> <b>insisted</b> on an explanation of what happened to their citizens as a precondition for normalizing relations with North Korea.|$|E
25|$|A {{referendum}} held in Catalonia in 2014 {{indicated that}} 92% of the 2.3 million voters supported Catalonia's transformation into a state. 80% of the 2.3 million voters expressed their preference that this {{state would be}} independent. Estimates for the turnout as published by the news media ranged from 37.0%, as given in The Economist and El País among others, to 41.6% as per the Catalan government's preliminary data. On 9 November 2015, Catalan lawmakers approved a plan for secession from Spain by 2017 with a majority vote 72 to 63. The plan was suspended by the Spanish Constitutional Court, but the Catalan government <b>has</b> <b>insisted</b> that it will complete the plan despite the suspension. On 9 June 2017, the Catalan government announced that an independence referendum would be held 1 October 2017. However, Spanish courts had declared the referendum to be illegal, and the Public Prosecutor's Office of Catalonia ordered the seizure of paraphernalia related to the referendum, including ballots, ballot boxes, promotional materials, and websites. On 20 September 2017, eleven days prior to the referendum, the Civil Guard mounted Operation Anubis to raid the offices of government ministries and detain officials involved in the referendum, which resulted in large protests by independence supporters.|$|E
25|$|On November 8, 1997, one {{day before}} Survivor Series, McMahon met with Pat Patterson and Michaels {{in a hotel room}} in Montreal and planned the screwjob. It is unclear how many people knew of the {{impending}} screwjob, but McMahon's close aides Gerald Brisco and Sgt. Slaughter had been involved in the planning. Jim Ross <b>has</b> <b>insisted</b> {{that he did not know}} the screwjob would take place, although many, including various members of Hart's family, thought he was involved. In a radio interview, Ross also confirmed that Jerry Lawler also did not know that the screwjob would take place. Hart and Michaels had met with Pat Patterson to discuss the match setup and plan, during which Hart agreed to allow Michaels to put him into the Sharpshooter hold at a time when the referee would be unconscious, as Patterson suggested. The rest of the match was planned to proceed thus: Hart would grab Michaels' foot and reverse the hold, putting him in the Sharpshooter. Michaels would submit to the hold, but the referee would still be unconscious. Hart would let go of the hold to try to revive the referee, but Michaels would hit Hart with his finisher, Sweet Chin Music, and make the pin. A second referee would then run to the ring with Owen Hart, Jim Neidhart, and Davey Boy Smith following close behind. The second referee would start the count, but Owen and Davey Boy would break the pin. The original referee would then recover and start to make the count, but Hart would kick out, setting up about five more minutes of brawling that would result in a disqualification.|$|E
