40|$|Although, {{elevated}} {{risk for}} lung cancer {{has been associated}} with certain <b>industries</b> <b>and</b> <b>occupations</b> in previous studies, the lack of cigarette smoking information in many of these investigations resulted in estimates that could not be adjusted for the effects of smoking. To determine lung cancer risk due to <b>occupation</b> <b>and</b> smoking, for New Mexico 2 ̆ 7 s Anglos and Hispanics, a population-based case-control study was conducted.

Significantly elevated risks were found for welders (RR = 3. 5) and underground miners (RR = 2. 0) with adjustment for smoking. Because shipbuilding was the industry of employment for only five of the 18 cases who were welders, exposures other than asbestos could be causal agents.

40|$|In PPIC’s California 2025 report, a {{potential}} mismatch was highlighted between {{the level of}} education the future population is likely to possess {{and the level of}} education that will be demanded by the future economy. This study provides further evidence of the future workforce skills gap and discusses the causes, magnitude, and likely consequences of the gap. The workforce skills gap is already a reality in California. In recent decades, the demand for workers with a bachelor’s degree has grown. The share of workers with a college degree increased from 28 percent in 1990 to 34 percent in 2006. Over the same period, the wages of college-educated workers grew substantially, whereas the wages of less-educated workers were relatively stagnant. These conditions characterize an increase in demand for collegeeducated workers for which growth in supply has not kept pace. Since 1990, there have been relatively small shifts in employment toward <b>industries</b> <b>and</b> <b>occupations</b> that employ higher shares of workers with bachelor’s degrees. More important, the employment of college-educated workers has increased within most <b>industries</b> <b>and</b> <b>occupations.</b> Our analysis shows that if past trends in worker education within <b>and</b> across <b>industries</b> <b>and</b> <b>occupations</b> were to continue, the demand for college-educated workers i...|$|R

5000|$|Defensive {{structures}} {{dating from}} this time are often impressive, for example the brochs of Northern Scotland and the hill forts that dotted {{the rest of the}} islands. Some of the most well-known hill forts include Maiden Castle, Dorset, Cadbury Castle, Somerset and Danebury, Hampshire. Hill forts first appeared in Wessex in the Late Bronze Age, but only become common in the period between 550 and 400 BC. The earliest were of a simple univallate form, and often connected with earlier enclosures attached to the long ditch systems. Few hill forts have been substantially excavated in the modern era, Danebury being a notable exception, with 49% of its total surface area studied. However, it appears that these [...] "forts" [...] were also used for domestic purposes, with examples of food storage, <b>industry</b> <b>and</b> <b>occupation</b> being found within their earthworks. On the other hand, they may have been only occupied intermittently as it is difficult to reconcile permanently occupied hill forts with the lowland farmsteads and their roundhouses found during the 20th century, such as at Little Woodbury and Rispain Camp. Many hill forts are not in fact [...] "forts" [...] at all, and demonstrate little or no evidence of occupation.|$|E

The findings suggest that regional mismatch did not {{play an important role}} in explaining movements of aggregate unemployment. Across <b>industries</b> <b>and</b> <b>occupations,</b> there was a decrease in mismatch unemployment from over 5 percent to below 4 percent (on the highest disaggregation level), whereas the share of mismatch unemployment (across <b>industries</b> <b>and</b> <b>occupations)</b> within total unemployment remains almost unchanged between 2000 and 2010. Concluding, mismatch unemployment fell but the Hartz reforms did not reduce mismatch overproportionally compared with search frictions, in line with the fact that reallocation across occupations appears not to have been eased.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: An {{updated version}} of a {{national}} surveillance system of traumatic occupational fatalities was used to explore adjusted and unadjusted trends in rates of fatal injury. METHODS: Data from the national traumatic occupational fatalities surveillance system were combined with data on employment from the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics. Poisson regression was then used to examine trends in rates of occupational fatality injuries while controlling for demographic and workplace characteristics. RESULTS: Adjusted annual changes in rates of fatal injuries ranged from a decline of 6. 2 % for workers in technical <b>and</b> administrative support <b>occupations</b> [...] for example, health, science, and engineering technicians, pilots, computer programmers [...] to an increase of 1. 6 % in machine operators, assemblers, <b>and</b> inspectors. For <b>industries,</b> annual changes ranged from a decline of 5. 3 % for workers in public administration [...] for example, justice, public order, and safety workers [...] to an increase of 2. 6 % for workers in the wholesale trade. By comparison, the annual decline over all <b>industries</b> <b>and</b> <b>occupations</b> was 3. 1 %. In many <b>industries</b> <b>and</b> <b>occupations,</b> an effect modification of annual trends {{by the age of}} the worker was also found with the oldest workers experiencing either no decline or a significant increase in rates of fatal injuries. CONCLUSIONS: This general pattern of decline, adjusted for the effects of demographic characteristics of the worker population, is encouraging; however, increases in rates of fatal injuries found in particular <b>industries</b> <b>and</b> <b>occupations,</b> suggest appropriate targets for increased injury prevention efforts...|$|R
