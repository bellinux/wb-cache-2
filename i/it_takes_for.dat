5|$|A {{benzodiazepine}} can {{be placed}} into one of three groups by its elimination half-life, or time <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>for</b> the body to eliminate half of the dose. Some benzodiazepines have long-acting active metabolites, such as diazepam and chlordiazepoxide, which are metabolised into desmethyldiazepam. Desmethyldiazepam has a half-life of 36–200 hours, and flurazepam, with the main active metabolite of desalkylflurazepam, with a half-life of 40–250 hours. These long-acting metabolites are partial agonists.|$|E

5|$|Eclipses {{can occur}} {{only when the}} Sun is within about 15 to 18 degrees of a node, (10 to 12 degrees for central eclipses). This is {{referred}} to as an eclipse limit. In the time <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>for</b> the Moon to return to a node (draconic month), the apparent position of the Sun has moved about 29 degrees, relative to the nodes. Since the eclipse limit creates a window of opportunity of up to 36 degrees (24 degrees for central eclipses), it is possible for partial eclipses (or rarely a partial and a central eclipse) to occur in consecutive months.|$|E
5|$|The work {{assumes that}} the royal legal system would still address some issues that later would have been dealt with by ecclesiastical courts.

It also addresses the administration of forest law under Henry I. Another new concern in the Leges is law covering the roadways and highways.|$|E

5|$|A {{white dwarf}} is very hot when it forms, {{but because it}} has no source of energy, it will {{gradually}} radiate its energy and cool. This means that its radiation, which initially has a high color temperature, will lessen and redden with time. Over a very long time, a white dwarf will cool and its material will begin to crystallize (starting with the core). The star's low temperature means it will no longer emit significant heat or light, and {{it will become a}} cold black dwarf. Because the length of time <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>for</b> a white dwarf to reach this state is calculated to be longer than the current age of the universe (approximately 13.8 billion years), it is thought that no black dwarfs yet exist. The oldest white dwarfs still radiate at temperatures of a few thousand kelvins.|$|E
5|$|The two-colored bolete is an edible mushroom, {{although}} some {{may have an}} allergic reaction after ingestion that results in stomach upset. The mushroom has a very mild to no taste although {{it is said to}} have a very distinctive taste like that of the king bolete. It can be cooked several ways, and the varying color of the cap can be used to determine if the mushroom is ready to be eaten. If the cap is a lighter red, then it is less mature and is in a stage where it is often larva infested or it can be soft fleshed, in some cases both. The cap should have a dark brick red color when safe to eat. Drying the two-colored bolete is a good method for storage. It is important to note the time <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>for</b> the two-colored bolete to bruise when identifying it for consumption; the mushroom should take several minutes to bruise compared to the instant bruising of Boletus sensibilis, which is poisonous and has many of the same visual characteristics of the two-colored bolete.|$|E
5|$|The {{ancestors}} of the genus Crocuta diverged from Hyaena (the genus of striped and brown hyenas) 10 million years ago. The {{ancestors of}} the spotted hyena probably developed social behaviours in response to increased pressure from other predators on carcasses, which forced them to operate in teams. At one point in their evolution, spotted hyenas developed sharp carnassials behind their crushing premolars; this rendered waiting for their prey to die no longer a necessity, {{as is the case}} for brown and striped hyenas, and thus became pack hunters as well as scavengers. They began forming increasingly larger territories, necessitated by the fact that their prey was often migratory, and long chases in a small territory would have caused them to encroach into another clan's land. It has been theorised that female dominance in spotted hyena clans could be an adaptation in order to successfully compete with males on kills, and thus ensure that enough milk is produced for their cubs. Another theory is that it is an adaptation to the length of time <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>for</b> cubs to develop their massive skulls and jaws, thus necessitating greater attention and dominating behaviours from females. Its appearance in Europe and China during the Cromerian period coincided with the decline and eventual extinction of Pachycrocuta brevirostris, the giant short-faced hyena. As {{there is no evidence of}} environmental change being responsible, it is likely that the giant short-faced hyena became extinct due to competition with the spotted hyena.|$|E

25|$|Since some processes, such as gene transcription, involve many {{reactions}} {{and could not}} be correctly modeled as an instantaneous reaction in a single step, it was proposed to model these reactions as single step multiple delayed reactions in order to account for the time <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>for</b> the entire process to be complete.|$|E
25|$|The {{amount of}} time <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>for</b> a brood to fully develop is highly {{variable}} and is complicated by occurrences of nest cannibalism, which is often undetected as replacement eggs appear.

25|$|Distance {{may also}} be {{measured}} {{as a function of}} time. The radar mile is the amount of time <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>for</b> a radar pulse to travel one nautical mile, reflect off a target, and return to the radar antenna. Since a nautical mile is defined as 1,852m, then dividing this distance by the speed of light (299,792,458m/s), and then multiplying the result by 2 yields a result of 12.36μs in duration.|$|E

25|$|Some {{of the key}} metrics to be {{measured}} in a disaster recovery environment are the Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO). RTO is a metric that measures the time that <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>for</b> a system to be completely up and running {{in the event of}} a disaster. RPO measures the ability to recover files by specifying a point in time restore of the backup copy.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, the dye {{molecule}} has lost an electron and the molecule will decompose if another electron is not provided. The dye strips one from iodide in electrolyte below the TiO2, oxidizing it into triiodide. This reaction occurs quite quickly {{compared to the}} time that <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>for</b> the injected electron to recombine with the oxidized {{dye molecule}}, preventing this recombination reaction that would effectively short-circuit the solar cell.|$|E
25|$|Quasi-adiabatic switching, however, {{requires}} that the tunneling barriers of a cell be switched relatively slowly compared to the intrinsic switching speed of a QCA. This prevents ringing and metastable states observed when cells are switched abruptly. Therefore, the switching speed of a QCA is limited not by the time <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>for</b> a cell to change polarization, but by the appropriate quasi-adiabatic switching time of the clocks being used.|$|E
