50|$|In short, the {{political}} system will change, {{and as long as}} there remain competent women judge applicants, competent women judges will follow. An <b>additional</b> <b>suggestion</b> includes focusing on 'manifest offices' or jobs from which judges have traditionally been appointed; essentially, to work within the system currently relied on in the appointment process.|$|R
5000|$|The {{intention}} {{initially was}} to find out [...] "Who are the greatest Germans?" [...] (Wer sind die größten Deutschen?), with more rankings to follow later.

Continued records of tides and meteorological conditions were also required. An <b>additional</b> <b>suggestion</b> was for a geological survey of a circular coral atoll in the Pacific Ocean including its profile and of tidal flows, to investigate the formation of such coral reefs.|$|R
40|$|Building on the {{commentaries on}} our work, we make <b>additional</b> <b>suggestions</b> for future {{research}} on social contagion and new product diffusion. In particular, we note that social contagion may occur for many reasons and that investigating how various personal or group characteristics moderate the amount of influence some customers exert or {{the extent to which}} others are sensitive to potential influence can provide insights into the social mechanism(s) at work. diffusion of innovations, opinion leadership, social contagion, social networks...|$|R

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{determining}} the premium scale when a Bonus-Malus system is superimposed on the a priori ratemaking is {{dealt with in the}} actuarial literature according to different approaches. In this paper, we compare two of these approaches with the aim of enlightening that they meet two conceptually different criteria: a financial equilibrium criterion and a minimization criterion. An <b>additional</b> <b>suggestion,</b> still based on a minimization criterion, is proposed. Analytical and numerical results are developed and discussed...|$|R
40|$|Medicine 1 made {{my heart}} sing. His words and ideas {{make sense to}} me. I agree with him that the time, money, and energy spent on taking the ABFM Maintenance of Certifi-cation Exam is unfortunate. As Dr Loxterkamp mentioned, there is little {{evidence}} that this kind of test-ing helps us be better physicians. Besides what Dr Loxterkamp mentioned as ideas for next year’s ABFM cognitive exams, I have some <b>additional</b> <b>suggestions.</b> Physi-cians could spend two sessions with a spiritual counselor, one sessio...|$|R

40|$|A direct {{simulation}} of turbulent flow in a channel is analyzed by {{the method of}} empirical eigenfunctions (Karhunen-Loeve procedure, proper orthogonal decomposition). This analysis reveals the presence of propagating plane waves in the turbulent flow. The velocity of propagation {{is determined by the}} flow velocity at the location of maximal Reynolds stress. The analysis further suggests that the interaction of these waves appears to be essential to the local production of turbulence via bursting or sweeping events in the turbulent boundary layer, with the <b>additional</b> <b>suggestion</b> that the fast acting plane waves act as triggers...|$|R
3000|$|Several survey {{participants}} (3.6 %) made <b>additional</b> <b>suggestions,</b> many {{of which}} show that these participants well understood the matter, such as the following: ‘In general, all products might contain dangerous substances.’ ‘Minor amounts of substances harmful for human health are present everywhere.’ ‘The dose makes the poison.’ ‘Organic does not mean free from….’ ‘There is no 100 % safety.’ ‘Natural substances can be dangerous for human health.’ There were again persons who feel very well informed: ‘I can assess this very well myself due to my profession.’ [...]...|$|R
40|$|This {{commentary}} {{argues that}} the quality and usefulness of student-recruited data can be evaluated by examining the external validity and generalization issues related to this sampling method. Therefore, we discuss how the sampling methods of student- and non-student-recruited samples can enhance or diminish external validity and generalization. Next, we present {{the advantages of the}} student-recruited sampling method (heterogeneity of the sample, student learning, cost reduction, and elaborate research designs) and conclude with making <b>additional</b> <b>suggestions</b> on how {{to improve the quality of}} these data.

50|$|Concerning {{the exact}} date of {{composition}} and authorship {{there is only}} unresolved speculation. The identity of the nameless, idealised central character is unclear, though it is suggested to be Ariwara no Narihira (825-880). Thirty of the poems from The Tales of Ise appear in the Kokin Wakashū (905), with similar headnotes, all attributed to Narihira. The combination of these poems, and the similarity of some events in the tales to Narihira's life, {{have led to the}} <b>additional</b> <b>suggestion</b> that Narihira actually composed the work; however, the inclusion of material and events dating after 880 suggests otherwise.|$|R
30|$|A {{number of}} <b>additional</b> <b>suggestions</b> {{for how to}} {{describe}} individual criteria were also made. These suggestions were all intended to clarify the meaning of individual criteria and did not concern issues of consistency with DRM procedures. One respondent suggested changing “handling” to “management” {{in the definition of}} criteria B, C, and J. Another respondent suggested changing the term “ideological orientation” to “perspective” (criterion G). Another suggestion was to divide the criterion of uncertainty (C) into two or more criteria that would identify different kinds of uncertainties. None of these suggestions, however, had broad support from the succeeding respondents.|$|R
40|$|Financial {{theory and}} econometric {{methodology}} both struggle in formulating models that are logically sound in reconciling short-run martingale behavior for financial assets with predictable long-run behavior, leaving {{much of the}} research to be empirically driven. The present article overviews recent contributions to this subject, focusing on the main pitfalls in conducting predictive regression and on some of the possibilities offered by modern econometric methods. The latter options include indirect inference and techniques of endogenous instrumentation that use convenient temporal transforms of persistent regressors. Some <b>additional</b> <b>suggestions</b> are made for bias elimination, quantile crossing amelioration, and control of predictive model misspecification...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2005 Literature {{has often}} {{misrepresented}} Natives and women. I involved Native Women in researching and editing my novel to fairly and accurately represent them. in open-ended interviews they described their experiences of nature, enjoyment, and discrimination {{as well as}} their critiques of the novel itself. Descriptions were of discrimination as perceived difference, originating from their own people, originating from inequality, and of language as both cultural understanding and a stage for discrimination. Critiques varied about representation of estrangement and language, but consistently clarified and corroborated material in addition to supporting my methodology. I ultimately recommend this methodology with <b>additional</b> <b>suggestions...</b>|$|R
40|$|This article {{considers}} {{the work of}} Thomas Piketty on inequality, with special emphasis on the reception of his ideas in the social sciences. First, a quantitative analysis of the works that cite Piketty’s most important publications examines the reception of Piketty in academic debates. Next, the critiques of Piketty from economics and sociology, two often opposed disciplines that have devoted the most attention to discussing Piketty, are considered. This article supplements existing critiques with <b>additional</b> <b>suggestions</b> {{that are relevant to}} both the scientific analysis of inequality and the process of imaging various reforms that could cope with the problem of inequality...|$|R
