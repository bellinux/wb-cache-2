500|$|Jonah Lomu is {{generally}} regarded as the first true global superstar of rugby union. He was the youngest player ever to appear in a test as an All Black, making his debut at age 19 years, 45 days in 1994. Lomu, a wing, had unique physical gifts; even though he stood 1.96m (6ft 5in) and weighed 119kg (262lb), making him both the tallest and heaviest back ever to play for New Zealand, he could run 100 metres in under 11 seconds. He burst on the international scene in the 1995 Rugby World Cup, scoring seven tries in the competition. Four of those tries came in New Zealand' semifinal win over England, including an iconic try in which he bulldozed England's Mike Catt {{on his way to}} the try line. He added eight more tries in the 1999 Rugby World Cup. Perhaps most remarkably, Lomu played virtually his entire top-level career <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shadow</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> serious kidney disorder which ended his test career in 2002 and ultimately led to a transplant in 2004. Even with his career hampered and eventually shortened by his health issues, he scored 37 tries in 63 tests. Lomu was inducted into the World Rugby Hall in October 2011, and was specifically recognised as one of four new inductees [...] "who had left an indelible mark on Rugby World Cup for their moments of magic, inspiration or feats".|$|E
500|$|Prior to the November 15, 2013 {{season opener}} against Southern Vermont College, Williams {{was the number}} one ranked Division III {{basketball}} program in the nation according to the preseason The Sporting News poll, but Williams lost <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shadow</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> home court scheduling conflict despite 5–6 shooting by Robinson. Robinson became the only freshman starter in Maker's six-year tenure as head coach at Williams. In his 2013–14 freshman season at Williams, Robinson was twice named New England Small College Athletic Conference (NESCAC) Player of the Week during the regular season. Williams reached the 2014 NCAA Men's Division III Basketball Tournament championship game, but fell 75–73 to University of Wisconsin–Whitewater as Robinson scored 17 points. After Williams took a one-point lead with 4.9 seconds left, Wisconsin pushed the ball upcourt without calling time-out to score the winning basket in what Chris Strauss of USA Today described as the best NCAA basketball tournament game of the weekend. Robinson had posted 30 points in the tournament semifinal against bitter rival Amherst College who had defeated Williams in the season's three previous meetings. Williams finished {{the season with a}} 28–5 record. That season, he led Williams in minutes played (a school record 1,110), points scored (548), three-point shots made (81–179), three-point % (45.3), free throw percentage (87.8%), blocks (36) and steals (36). He averaged 17.1 points, 6.5 rebounds and 34.7 minutes per game. Following the season, he was the NESCAC Rookie of the Year and a Second Team All-NESCAC selection. Robinson became Williams' first freshman to be named All-American (4th team, D3Hoops.com), first D3Hoops.com National Rookie of the Year, first freshman NCAA All-Tournament Team selection and first freshman 500-point scorer. His season was described as [...] "one of the best freshman seasons in Division III men's basketball history" [...] by Jeremy Leveille of WGAM in a story for NHNotebook.com.|$|E

He retired from the European Grand Prix from a collision with Williams driver Ralf Schumacher after spinning from being overtaken by Arrows driver Jos Verstappen.
