The objective of this project was to develop entrustable professional activities for pathology <b>graduate</b> medical <b>education</b> encompassing primary anatomic and clinical pathology residency training. The <b>Graduate</b> Medical <b>Education</b> Committee of the College of American Pathologists met over the course of 2 years to identify and define entrustable professional activities for pathology <b>graduate</b> medical <b>education.</b> Nineteen entrustable professional activities were developed, including 7 for anatomic pathology, 4 for clinical pathology, and 8 that apply to both disciplines with 5 of these concerning laboratory management. The content defined for each entrustable professional activity includes the entrustable professional activity title, a description of the knowledge and skills required for competent performance, mapping to relevant Accreditation Council for <b>Graduate</b> Medical <b>Education</b> Milestone subcompetencies, and general assessment methods. Many critical activities that define the practice of pathology fit well within the entrustable professional activity model.
