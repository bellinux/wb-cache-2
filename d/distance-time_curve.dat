That is, it is possible for a runner to run further than the race distance if he or she runs wide on bends in track races.

40|$|Background: The highest {{velocity}} that {{a runner}} can sustain during middle distance races {{is defined by}} the intersection of the runner’s individual velocity-time curve and the <b>distance-time</b> <b>curve.</b> The velocitytime curve is presumably fixed at the onset of a race; however, whereas the race distance is ostensibly fixed, the actual <b>distance-time</b> <b>curve</b> is not. That is, it is possible for a runner to run further than the race distance if he or she runs wide on bends in track races. In this instance, the point of intersection of the individual velocity-time curve and the <b>distance-time</b> <b>curve</b> will move downwards and to the right, reducing the best average velocity that can be sustained for the distance. Methods: To illustrate this point, the race tactics used by the gold and silver medallists at 800 m and 5000 m in the Sydney Olympics were analysed. The paths taken by the runners were carefully tracked and the total distance they covered during the races and the average velocity they sustained over the distances they actually covered were calculated. Results: In both the Olympic 800 m and 5000 m finals, for example, the winner was not the runner who ran at the highest average velocity in the race. Rather, the winners of these races were able to husband their metabolic resources to better effect by running closer to the actual race distance. Conclusions: Race results in middle distance running events are dependent not just on the energetic potential of the runners {{at the start of the}} race and their strategy for pace allocation, but also on the effect of their tactical approach to positioning on the total distance covered in the race. Middle distance runners should be conscious of minimising the distance covered in races if they wish to optimise their performance. ...|$|E
40|$|In general, the distance-time {{history of}} a shock front moving through a {{transparent}} medium is obtained by the aquarium technique. Differentiation of the <b>distance-time</b> <b>curve</b> yields shock velocity information, and given the Hugoniot of the transparent medium, a pressure-time history may be calculated. Distilled water typically comprises the transparent medium for the aquarium technique, hence, desirable properties of the fluid to be selected were patterned after those of water. The aquarium technique has been extended to encompass the temperature range from {minus} 45 to + 165 F by selection and calibration of a dimethyl polysiloxane fluid suitable for the referenced range. Results are given for the Hugoniots, and techniques used in selection and calibration are discussed...|$|E

A total of 100 <b>distance-time</b> <b>curves</b> (50 women and 50 men) were computed from international 100 -m finals, to determine the acceleration and deceleration phases of each race: (a) mechanical variables describing the velocity, force, and power output; and (b) F-P-v relationships and associated maximal power output, theoretical force and velocity produced by each athlete (Pmax, F 0, and V 0). The {{results showed that the}} maximal sprint velocity (Vmax) and mean power output (W/kg) developed over the entire 100 ~m strongly influenced 100 -m performance (r>- 0. 80; P≤q 0. 001). With the exception of mean force (N/kg) developed during the acceleration phase or during the entire 100 ~m, all of the mechanicals variables observed over the race were greater in men. Shorter acceleration and longer deceleration in women may explain both their lower Vmax and their greater decrease in velocity, and in turn their lower performance level, which can be explained by their higher V 0 and its correlation with performance. This highlights the importance of the capability to keep applying horizontal force to the ground at high velocities...|$|R
40|$|The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) conducts {{research}} into the effect of underwater explosions on maritime structures and equipment. One of the parameters that are required to be measured {{to a large degree}} of accuracy is the shock wave velocity in close proximity (10 - 120 charge radii) of the explosion, without having to revert to the streak photography method. This distance is in the region where the near field crosses over to the far field, and it would be expected that the <b>distance-time</b> <b>curve</b> would not be linear. The streak photography method produces accuracy in the very near field of the explosion, but is not recommended for accurate measurements at distances beyond 20 charge radii. We investigated the response of an optical sensor constructed to measure the light flash of an underwater blast to determine the moment of explosion. By measurement of the time taken between this moment and the time when the shock wave reaches the pressure sensors, accurate measurements of the distance-time history (and hence shock wave velocity) could be calculated. Twelve general purpose phototransistors were used in a parallel configuration to enhance the sensitivity of the sensor. These transistors were connected directly to a conditioning amplifier which formed the interface between the transistors and the data acquisition equipment. The results that were obtained confirmed that the light intensity of the flash of the explosion increased to a maximum within several microseconds. Measurements of the average velocity of the shock wave propagation, based on the flash measurement as a marker, correlated to within 0. 1 %, meaning that this method of marking the moment of explosion to within several microseconds had been successful. This method can therefore be used in similar underwater blast measurement applications when a measurement marker of the moment of explosion is required...|$|E
