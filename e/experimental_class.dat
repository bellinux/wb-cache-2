5|$|On September 2009, Glickenhaus {{announced}} {{his intention to}} race {{a new version of}} the P4/5 in the 2010 24 Hours Nürburgring. The car, called the P4/5 Competizione, would not be a conversion of his road car but instead an entirely new car with a Ferrari chassis, VIN and drivetrain. On May 2010 however, it was revealed that the Competizione would in fact be raced in 2011, based on a 430 Scuderia. It would be built to FIA GT2 standards and raced by Scuderia Cameron Glickenhaus in an <b>Experimental</b> <b>Class</b> under the direction of Paolo Garella, former Head of Special Projects at Pininfarina. Ferrari completely distanced themselves from the P4/5 Competizione project in 2011, refusing to sell the team parts for vital engine rebuilds between races. The car finished 39th in the 2011 24 Hours Nürburgring (after bursting into flames) and in 2012 won its class and finished 12th overall.|$|E

Seven of the Ramblers finished the grueling race, taking three {{of the top five}} places in the passenger-car class. One of the four-wheel-drive cars came in fourth in its class. The AIR team included a car with Bob Bondurant and Tony Murphy that took first place. For one of the winning Rambler drivers, this was his first ever race and the experience launched the career of Walker Evans.|$|E

In 1957, he began drag racing the car on a {{dragstrip}} at an airport near Calgary. It took him five attempts to make a [...] pass; he took out non-essential pieces of the car such as the back seat to lighten the load. His reputation for repairing cars quickly grew and soon there were cars lined up for repairs behind his family's garage.

In January 1965, he moved to Southern California and began campaigning a Chevrolet II at local tracks since he could compete up to five nights per week. He converted the car into a Funny Car and began running the car in early 1966 using the nickname [...] "The Canuck". The car appeared {{on the cover of}} Hot Rod Magazine in December 1966; the article in the magazine said [...] "Even a diehard Chevy lover would have trouble telling just what had been the original vehicle". The supercharged engine achieved runs in the 8-second bracket with a top elapsed time (e.t.) of 8.89 seconds. In 1969 he drove a Chevrolet Camaro in the Super Stock class and he followed it up with making passes in Funny Cars [...] "Travelin' Javelin" [...] and Tom Strum's Swapper.|$|E

The teaching elements are intended to promote interactive engagement of first year undergraduate students in an introductory physics course. The conceptual understanding of students in the <b>experimental</b> <b>classes</b> is better than that in the control classes which received traditional style lecturing. The ability in problem solving cannot be conclusively shown by the exam scores due to inconsistencies in grading the exam. The students in the <b>experimental</b> <b>classes</b> express positive responses towards the activities conducted to involve them actively in the learning process. It is also revealed that students still possess a traditional paradigm of teaching-learning. Several suggestions are presented to improve the implementation of this teaching method...|$|R
