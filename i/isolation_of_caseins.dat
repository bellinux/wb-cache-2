40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{introduce}} a reference method for the detection of cow milk in ewe and goat cheeses (EC 273 / 08) in order to protect manufacturers and consumers from adulterations and imitations, and to ensure alignment with the demands of domestic and EU markets. The method includes <b>isolation</b> <b>of</b> <b>casein</b> from cheese, isoelectric focusing of γ 2 - and γ 3 -casein originating from the hydrolysis of β-casein by plasmin, the detection and quantitative determination of γ-casein in cow, ewe and goat cheese by densitometry. Ewe or goat cheese products with a minimum of 1 % of cow milk are considered to be adulterated. For the quantitative determination of cow, ewe and goat milk in cheeses, standard mixtures of cow-ewe and cow-goat milk were made by adding 0; 0. 5; 1; 2; 5; 10; 25; 50; 75 and 100 % (v/v) of cow milk. The quantification was performed by determining the peak area ratio of cow γ-casein in comparison to ewe/goat casein in prepared standard cheeses. The calibration curves were calculated based on the relation of the peak area ratio of cow γ-caseins (calculated as the percentage of total γ-caseins) in contrast to the relative content (%) of cow milk in the mixture. The method proved to be adequate for the detection of raw and heat-treated cow milk in fresh and ripened cheeses made from ewe or goat milk, or a mixture of ewe and goat milk...|$|R

40|$|The {{manufacture}} of casein/caseinates containing whey protein is immediately attractive {{due to its}} potential to enhance product yield. However, some technologies capable of producing these products are ineligible for manufacturing subsidy because of restrictions pertaining to relevant EU regulations. Other emerging technologies require refinement and process design before implementation at industrial level. Furthermore, the implications of incorporating virtually the entire complement of whey protein in what is essentially a caseinate ingredient needs to be investigated carefully {{in terms of the}} versatility of use {{in a wide range of}} food formulations. The development is significant in the context of U. S. market changes - traditionally, an important outlet for Irish casein exports amounting to 20, 000 - 27, 000 t per annum. Ireland accounts for ~ 30 % of EU casein/caseinate production with the greater proportion in Rennet form (27, 000 t) and the remainder (18, 000 t) as Acid casein. In recent years, a new market for a related casein ingredient - milk protein concentrate (MPC) opened up in the US, and accounted for total imports of 40, 000 t in 1998, 10, 000 t of which were exported from Ireland. However, this market is more restricted due to regulatory changes introduced in response to the perceived threat of MPC imports to the US dairy industry. Since casein, or its derivative products such as milk proteinate (EU Annex III compliant), are not perceived to be in competition with local milk supplies and dairy ingredients, it is now hoped that Irish casein manufacturers may be able to reclaim recently lost markets through the introduction of an innovative proteinate ingredient which is expected to command a premium in nutrition applications e. g. in sports, infant formula and nutraceutical products. With a choice of emerging new technologies for the production of novel casein-related ingredients, the dairy industry has an opportunity to decide on what is appropriate for the defence of its market share and at the same time benefit from simultaneous compliance with relevant regulatory supports (EU) and market access rules (USA). Hence the main aims of this project were: * To investigate new technologies for the <b>isolation</b> <b>of</b> <b>casein</b> and casein/whey protein combinations in the course of developing new milk protein ingredients, and * To compare the performance in selected food formulations of novel milk protein ingredients namely milk proteinates, milk protein concentrates, native phosphocasein and classical Annex III <b>casein</b> products.

The sample preparation for transmission electron microscopy involved physical methods of fixation and flash freeing to preserve the structure <b>of</b> <b>caseins</b> in the sample. The structure <b>of</b> <b>caseins</b> in sodium and calcium caseinate varied with sodium caseinate not exhibiting any spherical structure as opposed to the spherical structure seen in calcium caseinate, non-fat dried milk and native milk.

The rheological properties <b>of</b> <b>casein</b> products, casein gels and adsorbed layers <b>of</b> <b>casein,</b> have been widely investigated. However, the micellar properties <b>of</b> <b>casein</b> could, until recently, only be studied by ensemble methods such as dynamic light scattering and microscopic techniques, using dried or frozen samples. Nano-techniques, such as atomic force microscopy (AFM) have now made it possible to make complementary nanorheological measurements in a liquid environment. In this thesis, the observed nanorheological properties <b>of</b> single <b>casein</b> micelles, adsorbed thin casein layers and rennet-induced casein-retentate gels, are presented and discussed. The ultimate objective of these studies was to investigate the relationship between the local and the macroscopic rheological properties of cheese. The renneted casein gels were produced from casein retentate from ultrafiltration (UF), as another objective of the work was to increase our knowledge on cheese production from concentrated milk. Natural rennet-induced cheese is essentially a particulate calcium phosphate-para-casein matrix, composed of interconnected and overlapping strands of partially fused para-casein aggregates, which are in turn made up of para-casein micelles. To increase our knowledge on the nanorheological behaviour of the building blocks <b>of</b> the <b>casein</b> matrix, the first step was to investigate single adsorbed casein micelles. In the AFM measurements, the nanorheological properties <b>of</b> adsorbed <b>casein</b> micelles could not be explained by any model describing an elastic material (Paper I). Preliminary results led to investigations of the possibility that surface tension phenomena could explain the rheological behaviour.

40|$|Members <b>of</b> the <b>casein</b> kinase- 1 {{family of}} protein ki-nases play an {{essential}} role in cell regulation and dis-ease pathogenesis. Unlike most protein kinases, they appear to function as constitutively active enzymes. As a result, selective pharmacological inhibitors can {{play an important role in}} dissection <b>of</b> <b>casein</b> kinase- 1 -depend-ent processes. To address this need, new small molecule inhibitors <b>of</b> <b>casein</b> kinase- 1 acting through ATP-com-petitive and ATP-noncompetitive mechanisms were iso-lated on the basis of in vitro screening. Here we report the crystal structure of 3 -[(2, 4, 6 -trimethoxyphenyl) methylidenyl]-indolin- 2 -one (IC 261), an ATP-competi-tive inhibitor with differential activity among casein kinase- 1 isoforms, in complex with the catalytic domain <b>of</b> fission yeast <b>casein</b> kinase- 1 refined to a crystallo...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe content <b>of</b> <b>casein</b> kinase 2 is {{considerably}} decreased in ribosome-free extracts of the frontal cortex of schizophrenic and Alzheimer's disease patients {{in comparison to}} normal brains as has been demonstrated by means of immunoblotting. The activity <b>of</b> <b>casein</b> kinase 2 towards endogenous substrates and casein is also diminished {{in the cases of}} mental pathologies examined. This phenomenon may explain the well-known aberrations in the phosphorylation of structural proteins of human brain which are intrinsic for the mental diseases...|$|R
40|$|The {{structure}} of a truncated variant <b>of</b> <b>casein</b> kinase- 1 from Schizosaccharomyces pombe, has been determined in complex with MgATP at 2. 0 A resolution. The model resembles the 'closed', ATP-bound conformations of the cyclin-dependent kinase 2 and the cAMP-dependent protein kinase, with clear differences in the {{structure of}} surface loops that impart unique features to casein kinase- 1. The structure is of unphosphorylated, active conformation <b>of</b> <b>casein</b> kinase- 1 and the peptide-binding site is fully accessible to substrate...|$|R
