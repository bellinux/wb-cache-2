5|$|Roddy Piper was Special Guest Referee for a bout between Jeff Hardy and Scott Hall, {{which was}} the {{following}} contest. After the two fought for a few minutes, Hardy gained the pinfall victory after he jumped off the top rope and performed a Swanton Bomb, a high-angle front flip from the top rope, onto Hall who was laying <b>flat</b> <b>against</b> the mat. Abyss attacked Hardy after the match finished, and lifted Hardy up onto his shoulders and then dropped to a seated position, a move which Abyss dubbed the Shock Treatment.|$|E

Goldammer based his bike [...] "Experimental" [...] on a Honda CR 250 dirtbike frame which was severely modified and fitted with dual KRC supercart motors. The bike achieved a topspeed of 128.774 mph which was enough to take the trophy.|$|R

25|$|African Americans have {{developed}} a large variety of ways to wear dreadlocked hair. Specific elements of these styles include the flat-twist, in which a section of locks are rolled together <b>flat</b> <b>against</b> the scalp to create an effect similar to the cornrows, and braided dreadlocks. Examples include flat-twisted half-back styles, flat-twisted mohawk styles, braided buns and braid-outs (or lock crinkles).|$|E

25|$|In a {{game with}} {{a trip to the}} conference {{championship}} game on the line, the Cavaliers fell <b>flat</b> <b>against</b> their in-state rivals Virginia Tech. Poor clock management and poor defense (along with a missed holding call on a VPI offensive lineman attempting to block Chris Long {{at the end of the}} first half on a Sean Glennon touchdown pass) allowed Virginia Tech to exploit Virginia en route to an easy 33–21 win.|$|E
25|$|All Folds {{are born}} with straight, {{unfolded}} ears, and those with the Fold gene will begin to show the fold usually within about 21 days. The kittens that do not develop folded ears are known as Straights. The original cats only had one fold in their ears, but due to selective breeding, breeders have increased the fold to a double or triple crease that causes the ear to lie totally <b>flat</b> <b>against</b> the head.|$|E
25|$|While {{initially}} {{only the}} players on the field could see the extent of the damage to Theismann's leg, the reverse-angle instant replay (shown multiple times) provided a clearer view of what had actually happened—Theismann's lower leg bones were broken midway between his knee and his ankle, such that his leg from his foot to his mid-shin was lying <b>flat</b> <b>against</b> the ground while the upper part of his shin up to his knee was at a 45-degree angle to the lower part of his leg.|$|E

25|$|At 15.00 on 16 September 2009 a Red Line Luas tram and a {{double-decker}} number 16 Dublin Bus collided at {{the crossroads}} of Abbey Street and O'Connell Street in Dublin city centre. The front section of the tram was derailed in the incident and the driver's cabin was crushed <b>flat</b> <b>against</b> the left hand side of the bus. At least 21 people were injured and three were seriously hurt, including the driver of the tram who had to be cut out from the wreckage.|$|E
25|$|The outer part of {{the double}} coat should be {{straight}} and wiry in texture, never soft, silky, curly, wavy, or woolly {{as might be expected}} in the Kerry Blue Terrier. The coat should lie <b>flat</b> <b>against</b> the skin, and, though having some length, should never be so long as to hide the true shape of the dog. There are longer hairs on the legs, but never so much as a Wire Fox Terrier or Schnauzer. That means {{you have to have the}} coat trimmed often which can be expensive.|$|E
25|$|They usually roost {{with their}} ventral side <b>flat</b> <b>against</b> a surface. The Mauritian tomb bat is nocturnal and rests during the day; however, {{it does not}} sleep much and remains watchful while {{roosting}}. If disturbed, they will fly off to another site or move quickly up under the eaves of the building. Very rarely do they travel far from their day roosting site, and roosts are often recolonized. Over time these sites become stained with gular sack secretions and urine. The stains are typically a rectangular brown shape roughly 150mm long and 100mm wide.|$|E

50|$|Birds lacking {{binocular}} vision have poor depth perception, {{and can find}} a bird bath off-putting if they're unable to judge the water's depth. Leaning a stick or <b>flat</b> rock <b>against</b> the bird bath rim as a ramp to allow them gradual access into the water may allay their fear.|$|R
5000|$|In linguistics, a denti-alveolar {{consonant}} or dento-alveolar consonant is a consonant that is articulated with a <b>flat</b> tongue <b>against</b> the alveolar {{ridge and}} upper teeth, such as [...] and [...] in languages such as Spanish and French. That is, a denti-alveolar consonant {{is one that}} is alveolar and laminal.|$|R
25|$|As {{indicated}} by their name, their coats occur in light golden to dark golden colours. The topcoat is water-resistant and slightly wavy, and sheds {{in small amounts}} throughout the year. The undercoat is soft and keeps the retriever cool in summer and warm in winter; it sheds {{in the spring and}} fall. It usually lies <b>flat</b> <b>against</b> the belly. The Golden's coat should never be too long, as this may prove to be a disservice to it in the field, especially when retrieving game. Golden Retrievers have mild feathering on the backs of their fore legs and heavier feathering on the fronts of their necks, backs of their thighs and the bottoms of their tails.|$|E
25|$|The Golden Retriever is a large-sized {{breed of}} dog bred as gun dogs to {{retrieve}} shot waterfowl such as ducks and upland game birds during hunting and shooting parties, and were named 'retriever' {{because of their}} ability to retrieve shot game undamaged. Golden Retrievers have an instinctive love of water, and are easy to train to basic or advanced obedience standards. They are a long-coated breed, with a dense inner coat that provides them with adequate warmth in the outdoors, and an outer coat that lies <b>flat</b> <b>against</b> their bodies and repels water. Golden Retrievers are well suited to residency in suburban or country environments. Although they need substantial outdoor exercise, they should be housed in a fenced area because of their instinctual tendency to roam. They shed copiously, particularly at the change of seasons, and require fairly regular grooming.|$|E
25|$|Porous bass trap {{absorbers}} {{need to be}} {{very thick}} to be effective at lower frequencies so they tend to be allocated either as diagonal wedges in the corners or as thick rectangular bulk behind false walls where they are {{out of the way and}} less likely to disrupt higher frequencies or room function. Air gap behind a porous panel absorber e.g. straddling a corner also helps to ensure it protrudes more into the room where there is more air velocity, improving its velocity-based absorption and extending its bandwidth while inducing some ripple in its absorption spectrum. Resonant bass trap absorbers need to be at a pressure maximum and tend to be thinner, so they are more conveniently and effectively positioned <b>flat</b> <b>against</b> a wall in a corner where the pressure is maximum, rather than straddling a corner where there is more velocity.|$|E

25|$|The {{minimum height}} {{requirement}} for Mission: Space is 44inches (112cm). Spiels and warnings throughout the attraction caution {{that people who}} do not like enclosed dark spaces, simulators, spinning, or are prone to motion sickness should not ride. Signs also warn that the ride may cause nausea, headache, dizziness, or disorientation, and that people prone to motion sickness, or who have a headache or an inner ear problem, or who have a history of migraines, vertigo, or elevated anxiety also should not ride. These signs are similar to those present at considerably less-intense rides in the same park, such as Soarin'. There are also signs which instruct the rider to keep their head <b>flat</b> <b>against</b> the headrest, stating that if one ignores this, the centrifugal motion acting on one's head can cause undesirable effects such as dizziness and/or headaches, or possibly even more serious effects.|$|E
25|$|On 13 November 2001, Charlotte {{visited her}} family where they watched a film together. Her father later stated {{that she had}} been in great spirits, because of her new flat in Holloway, north London, which she had decorated, and there was a {{possibility}} of a career upturn after a few years of a career stall. Later that evening, she complained of feeling unwell, but went home to her <b>flat</b> <b>against</b> her parents' advice. The next morning, Wednesday, 14 November 2001, her parents telephoned her to see if she was feeling better; but there was no reply. Concerned, her mother went to Charlotte's flat, to find her lying unconscious on the floor; her asthma inhaler was in a different room. She was taken by ambulance to Whittington Hospital in north London, where she was pronounced dead on arrival, from a massive attack of bronchial asthma.|$|E
25|$|Dholes produce {{whistles}} {{resembling the}} calls of red foxes, sometimes rendered as coo-coo. How this sound is produced is unknown, {{though it is}} thought to help in coordinating the pack when travelling through thick brush. When attacking prey, they emit screaming KaKaKaKAA sounds. Other sounds include whines (food soliciting), growls (warning), screams, chatterings (both of which are alarm calls) and yapping cries. In contrast to wolves, dholes do not howl or bark. Dholes have a complex body language. Friendly or submissive greetings are accompanied by horizontal lip retraction and the lowering of the tail, as well as licking. Playful dholes open their mouths with their lips retracted and their tails held in a vertical position whilst assuming a play bow. Aggressive or threatening dholes pucker their lips forward in a snarl and raise the hairs on their backs, as well as keep their tails horizontal or vertical. When afraid, they pull their lips back horizontally with their tails tucked and their ears <b>flat</b> <b>against</b> the skull.|$|E
