25|$|During the campaign, Nixon {{also used}} as a theme his {{opposition}} to the decisions of Chief Justice Earl Warren. Many conservatives were critical of Chief Justice Warren for using the Supreme Court to promote liberal policies in the fields of civil rights, civil liberties, and {{the separation of church and}} state. Nixon promised that if he were elected president, he would appoint justices who would take a less-active role in creating social policy. In another campaign promise, he pledged to end the draft. During the 1960s, Nixon had been impressed by a paper he had read by Professor Martin Anderson of Columbia University. Anderson had argued in the paper for an end to the draft and the creation of an all-volunteer army. Nixon also saw ending the draft as an effective way to undermine the anti-Vietnam war movement, since he believed affluent college-age youths would stop protesting the war once their own possibility of having to fight in <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>gone.</b>|$|E
25|$|In Europe, moose are {{currently}} found {{in large numbers}} throughout Norway, Sweden, Finland, Latvia, Estonia, Poland, with more modest numbers in the southern Czech Republic, Belarus and northern Ukraine. They are also widespread through Russia on up through the borders with Finland south towards the border with Estonia, Belarus and Ukraine and stretching far away eastwards to the Yenisei River in Siberia. The European moose was native to most temperate areas with suitable habitat on the continent and even Scotland {{from the end of}} the last Ice Age, as Europe had a mix of temperate boreal and deciduous forest. Up through Classical times, the species was certainly thriving in both Gaul and Magna Germania, as it appears in military and hunting accounts of the age. However, as the Roman era faded into medieval times, the beast slowly disappeared: soon after the reign of Charlemagne, the moose disappeared from France, where its range extended from Normandy in the north to the Pyrenees in the south. Farther east, it survived in Alsace and the Netherlands until the 9th century as the marshlands in the latter were drained and the forests were cleared away for feudal lands in the former. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>gone</b> from Switzerland by the year 1000, gone from the western Czech Republic by 1300, gone from Mecklenburg in Germany by c. 1600, and has been gone from Hungary and the Caucasus since the 18th and 19th century, respectively.|$|E

[...] Like them, Butcher recognized that an era in Plains history was passing, and tried to document it visually before <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>gone.</b> [...] Even during his short career, the face of Nebraska changed; the sod houses of his earlier photographs are increasingly supplanted by frame buildings in his later ones.|$|E

The scar symbolized Todd's [...] "second rape of Marty", and was considered [...] "a poetic nod" [...] to Todd's history. The scar was significantly smaller than the original but placed in the same spot; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>gone</b> by January 2009. St. John stated, [...] "I know. It's too bad.

500|$|In 1677, a {{particularly}} brutal German General Kops leading {{the forces of}} Holy Roman Emperor Leopold I designed to keep Hungary dominated by the Germans, rather than to become dominated by the Turks, began impaling and quartering his Hungarian subjects/opponents. An opposing general for the Hungarians, , responded in kind, by flaying alive Imperial troops, and fixing sharp iron hooks in fortress walls, upon which he threw captured Germans to be impaled. Finally, Emperor Leopold I {{had had enough of}} the mutual bloodshed, and banished Kops in order to establish a needed cessation of hostilities. After the Treaty of The Hague (1720), Sicily fell under Habsburg rule, but the locals deeply resented the German overlords. One parish priest (who exhorted his parishioners to kill the Germans) is said to have broken into joy when a German soldier arrived at his village, exclaiming <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>gone</b> a whole eight days since last he killed a German, and shot the soldier off his horse. The priest was later impaled. [...] In the short-lived 1784 Horea Revolt against the Austrians and Hungarians, the rebels gained hold of two officers they promptly impaled. On their side, the imperial troops got hold of Horea's 13-year-old son, and impaled him. That seems to have merely inflamed the rebel leader's determination, although the revolt was quashed shortly afterwards.|$|E

Bookstore managers told reporters that after the 1987 re-release of Buckskin Brigades by Bridge Publications, the book [...] "just sat there". Sheldon McArthur, former manager of B. Dalton Booksellers on Hollywood Boulevard in Los Angeles, told the Los Angeles Times: [...] "Then, in one week, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>gone...</b> We started getting calls asking, 'You got Buckskin Brigades?

2500|$|According to Margot Badran, {{the editor}} and {{translator}} of Hoda Shaarawi's memoir, Harem Years, this act signaled {{the end of the}} harem system in Egypt and the start of the elite women entering the public sphere. This would start a movement among upper-class women to abandon the burqu' and move around the city without the cover. Not only would women like Shaarawi [...] remove themselves from the seclusion of their harem worlds, but fully joined their nationalist husbands in the male-led Egyptian Revolution of 1919 against British occupation.In 1925, the EFU founded a French-language magazine L'Egyptienne, which discussed unveiling in the Middle East. Eventually, face covering waned in Egypt, and by the late 1930s <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>gone.</b> Instead, middle and upper-class women wore versions of Western dress both on the streets and at home. It was not until the Islamic revival of the 1970s and an introduction of more modest dress that the hijab and less commonly, the niqab, reasserted themselves.|$|E
2500|$|The Freemasonry of the Moderns Grand Lodge and its {{daughter}} lodges in Pennsylvania was eclipsed {{during the}} latter half of the 18th century by the rise of the Ancients Grand Lodge and its subordinate lodges. The American Revolutionary War took a great toll on Pennsylvania Freemasonry, and especially the Moderns' lodges. Beginning before the War some of the Modern Lodges had switched allegiance to the Ancients, e.g. Lodge No. 4 of the Moderns. By the end of the Revolution nearly all the lodges in Pennsylvania owed allegiance to the Ancients. It is impossible to determine precisely when the Moderns' Provincial Grand Lodge folded, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>gone</b> by 1785. The Masonic Hall, built by the Moderns in 1755 was sold, and the proceeds were placed in a charitable trust and became the [...] "Freemason's Fuel Fund." [...] Thus, we can say that the [...] "Modern" [...] line was grafted onto the [...] "Ancient." ...|$|E

2500|$|Cézanne, {{progressively}} {{leading up}} to 1906, moved away from classic pictorial arrangements, single view perspectives, and outlines that enclosed color. His attempt was {{to arrive at a}} [...] "lived perspective" [...] by capturing all the complexities that could be observed with the eye and captured by the senses, where both [...] "sight" [...] and [...] "touch" [...] became one. Cèzanne believed his paintings could capture a moment in time, that once passed <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>gone,</b> that art and nature are the same. Cèzanne claimed: [...] "Art is a personal apperception, which I embody in sensations and which I ask the understanding to organize into a painting." [...] The true meaning of painting grew closer as the distance from tradition increased. Just as the Cubists he would inspire, Cèzanne had little interest in the rational naturalistic painting and classical geometrical perspective inherited from the Renaissance. [...] "Nor was he satisfied," [...] writes Merleau-Ponty, [...] "with the attempts of the Impressionists to dissolve this objective order into its original elements of light and atmosphere".|$|E
