40|$|The genetic {{variability}} of ant species determined as Messor structor (Latreille, 1798) {{or close to}} it (“M. cf. structor”) from Bulgaria has been studied using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of five soluble protein systems (Sp- 1, Sp- 2, Sp- 3, Sp- 4 and Sp- 5) corresponding to 5 loci. Four of the studied loci {{were found to be}} polymorphic. Two alleles were detected at Sp- 1 and Sp- 2 loci and three – at Sp- 3 and Sp- 5. The observed and expected heterozygosities (Ho and He) ranged from 0. 0 (Yambol) to 0. 140 (Topolovo) and from 0. 170 (<b>Nova</b> <b>Zagora)</b> to 0. 401 (Tvarditsa), respectively. The calculated mean value of inbreeding coefficient (FIS) was 0. 8263 and demonstrated high level of inbreeding within populations, which correlated with a low level of observed heterozygosity compared to the expected one. The estimated mean fixation index (FST) value was 0. 2746. Allele frequencies of soluble protein loci were used to estimate Nei’s (1972) genetic distance and to obtain the Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean (UPGMA) and Neighbor-Joining (NJ) dendrograms, where Topolovo and <b>Nova</b> <b>Zagora</b> populations were grouped separately than other populations...|$|R

40|$|This {{article focuses}} on {{beginnings}} of the urban planning and first organized planning activities of Bulgarian cities {{at the turn of}} 19 th and 20 th centuries when many Czech engineers and architects participated in significantly. A common feature of all Bulgarian cities was irregular structure and build-up area. The main task of the Czech engineers was to cope with this situation and to design modern cities. In general, the original structure did not make planning easy and unambiguous. Planning of the cities destroyed in the Russian-Turkish war in 1877 - 78 was easier. A possibility to apply a new city structure freely existed in Stara Zagora and partially in <b>Nova</b> <b>Zagora.</b> A usual principle was straightening of the streets where the engineers used original street network and the new modern streets were built according to it, e. g. the centre of Kystendil and the old part of <b>Nova</b> <b>Zagora.</b> These principles were used also in some central parts of Sofia and Plovdiv. The city of Sofia itself is a distinctive example. Although the original structure was preserved during the war and in the first steps the principle of straightening of the streets in the centre was applied, the other parts of Sofia were designed with a new structure and the old city disappeared. Plovdiv is in contrary to Sofia and its original structure was preserved as an old city and the new one was joined to it in neighbourhoods...|$|R
50|$|Tüfekçi's older {{name was}} Arsela. Perhaps coincidentally, a village named Arşela existed {{on the east}} coast of the Black Sea. Arsela is a place that was {{mentioned}} in a panegyric text written for the Thracian god Sabazius. It takes the form of Arselenos on another epitaph, which was found in <b>Nova</b> <b>Zagora.</b> Ivan Duridanov has claimed that the river names Arsio, Arse in Old Prussia, Arsen and Arsia in Latvia and Arsina in Germany are derivation of the root ors-, ers “(for water) flow, damp” in the Indo-European language family (Hindi arşati) and ars- in the Thracian language. He connected these words to place names such as Arsa, Arsaza, Arsena, Arsila in Dacia (an ancient region in Romania covering territories north and west of Arsela) (Duridanov, 1976).|$|R
