40|$|There is an {{implicit}} assumption in cited literature on precision agriculture (PA) that spreading of fertiliser is performed perfectly {{in the field}} leading to uniform application, this is not true. Variation can be large and often the actual performance of spreading equipment used has never been measured or verified. In various {{countries around the world}} there are quality assurance (QA) systems designed to achieve a prescribed level of performance. Even within these QA schemes limited testing is undertaken and always under perfect or near perfect conditions. The test methods are designed to establish an acceptable bout width which meets an acceptable <b>evenness</b> <b>of</b> <b>spread</b> if driven accurately. The test {{does not take into account}} wind conditions (except for requiring less than 15 kmhr- 1 for testing), humidity, slope, terrain or the instrumentation to maintain the desired bout width. This paper examines the effect of the farm environment and the physical characteristics of fertilisers on the spread patterns of fertilisers in the field. Fertilisers with heterogeneous particle size distributions proved to have more robust spread patterns under field conditions than those with homogeneous particle size distributions...|$|E
30|$|Pellet {{manufacturing}} is {{an energy}} intensive process. Inside the pelleting machine, the pressure between the roller and the dye, forcing {{the raw material}} through the perforations, causes frictional heating (Battacharya et al. 1989). Tumuluru et al. (2011), reviewed that power consumption of commercial pellet mills falls {{within the range of}} 48.9 – 130.7  kJ t− 1 the 37 – 40  % of which is required to compress the material while the remaining energy is required to overcome friction during compression (Tumuluru et al. 2011). With reference to pellet specific energy consumption, Tabil and Sokhansanj (1996) assessed ranges of 19 – 90  kJ kg− 1 partly confirmed by Tumuluru et al. (2011), who reviewed specific energy consumption ranging 59 – 268.2  kJ t− 1 for pellet mills. At a given densification system, moisture content and other biomass properties (e.g. particle size distribution, biochemical composition) can significantly affect the specific energy requirements of the process (Nielsen et al. 2009; Tumuluru et al. 2011; Gadernejad et al. 2012): anyway, the high energy input required makes it uneconomical and not practical for farmers to directly purchase and operate a pellet mill. Commonly, pellet distribution is carried out with rotating spreaders, designed for granular formulations, whose performance and hence <b>evenness</b> <b>of</b> <b>spread</b> pattern depends both on machine engineering (Hofstee 1994, 1995; Kweon and Grift 2006; Parish 2006) and on fertilizer physical properties (Hofstee and Huisman 1990; Aphale et al. 2003; Grift et al. 2006; Suppadit and Panomsri 2010), which are also important to calculate the volume needed to store, transport, handle and calibrate fertilizer spreaders (Agnew and Leonard 2003; Campbell et al. 2010).|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Coral reefs are {{globally}} in {{a vulnerable}} state, because of both human impacts and environmental alterations. An understanding of coral reef ecosystems {{and the ability}} to detect changes in the reef environment early on are necessary to apply effective conservation. The co-evolution of coral and coral feeding fishes means that some species may exhibit interactions useful for indicating reef health, acting as an early warning system. Chaetodontidae (Perciformes) are one such family, containing coral dependent (obligate corallivore) species. This concept is known as the Butterflyfish Indicator Hypothesis (BIH). Through the collection of baseline data for butterflyfish abundance, diversity and species composition, the possible applicability of the BIH was investigated within Marine Protected Areas (MPA¡¯s) of iSimangaliso Wetland Park, on the north-eastern coast of South Africa. Other factors possibly impacting butterflyfish distribution were also investigated in this region. These factors were level of MPA protection (sanctuary or partially protected), reef rugosity and site effects. 78 transects across 13 dive sites were swum using Underwater Video Census (UVC) for data capture. Reef rugosity displayed no impact on any of the sampled factors, whilst site and protection level did. Protection was the factor with the greatest influence on butterflyfish species richness (df = 77, t = 2. 85, p < 0. 005), <b>evenness</b> <b>of</b> <b>spread</b> (df = 77, t = 1. 79, p < 0. 05) and total abundance, as revealed by the General Linear Model (GLM) with the lowest Aikake¡¯s Information Criterion (AIC) (y = ¥â&# 8338; + ¥â©û (protection)). None of the factors altered Chaetodon meyeri distribution significantly, the only observed obligate corallivore, for which low abundances were observed. Differences in total butterflyfish abundance and species diversity appear to be particularly useful in revealing human impacts on coral health. The lack of C. meyeri, likely accounted to low abundances of its preferred coral Acropora (Scleractinia: Acroporidae), suggest that the BIH is not useful in this region...|$|E

40|$|Swedish {{agricultural}} soils {{are reported to}} receive an annual application of plant nutrients as fertilizer amounting to a value almost as large the total new-investment made during one year. Poor precision in nutrient supply results in yield decreases and environmental loading. The purpose of this work is to summarize the knowledge available today on factors that influence fertilizer distribution achieved by pneumatic fertilizer spreaders. The work is mainly concentrated on technical design parameters that influences the spreading uniformity parallel to and {{at right angles to}} the direction of travel. The average coefficient of variation for the <b>evenness</b> <b>of</b> <b>spreading</b> <b>of</b> today’s fertilizer spreaders is 25 % in the field. In practise, there is no significant difference between centrifugal spreaders and pneumatic spreaders. During the work of which this report accounts for, 87 Swedish and international references have been studied in order to find factors influencing the result <b>of</b> fertilizer <b>spreading.</b> Factors influencing the spreading result can be divided into: the fertilizer, the machine, the field the weather and the operator. The flow properties of the fertilizer and its tendency to deposit on working mechanism are affected by its physical properties. The particle size distribution influences length of throw, flow properties and tendency of separation. The durability of the fertilizer will affect the particle size distribution. Particle shape and surface texture affect the flow properties. Density influences throw properties. Hygroscopicity influences water uptake and thereby flow properties and tendency to deposit within the machine. Thixotropic fertilizers lead to hard deposits being placed on working mechanisms and transport ducts against which the fertilizer glides. The machine can be divided into fertilizer hopper, feeder mechanism, fan, piping, spreader boom and spreader mechanism. When filling a hopper separation generally occurs. Severe separation influences the resulting distribution. When emptying the hopper the slope of the floor will influence the amount of fertilizer remaining in the hopper. 60 — 65 ° slope of the bottom of the hopper will ensure complete emptying. Metering mechanisms can be divided into active and passive mechanisms. The function of passive mechanisms depend on the flow properties of the fertilizer. The studded roller is a semi-active metering mechanism. Cyclic variations in out-flow may occur in metering devices that measure out the fertilizer in portions, e. g. cell wheels, star wheels and augers. Shaking and slope of hopper influences the mass flow from passive metering mechanisms. The fan is used to transport the fertilizer within the machine. The flow of air can be used to reduce drift caused by wind if both the flow of fertilizer and the flow of air are directed downwards at the spreading mechanism. At high fertilizer application rates the fan-pipe system in modern fertilizer spreaders tend to overload, with pulsating flows as a result. These pulsating flows are reflected in a severe deterioration <b>of</b> the <b>spreading</b> uniformity. The piping functions as a way of transport of the fertilizer. Piping with a high coefficient of friction leads to a rapidly attained even radial distribution of granules in the pipe. Curves induces pressure losses and deteriorated radial distribution in the pipe. Bends immediately before the spreading mechanism should be avoided. Movements of the spreader boom influences the final result <b>of</b> fertilizer <b>spreading.</b> Boom movements occur {{largely as a result of}} the torque of the fertilizer vehicle along its respective longitudinal and vertical axles. The response of a boom suspension to the rolling motion of the vehicle to which it is attached should be such that the boom is insulated from the high frequency random rolling movements but is able to follow the low frequency undulations of the ground. An example of such a boom suspension is found in the literature. In the literature, spreader mechanisms are found in many different shapes. Significant for the majority of them is that their <b>evenness</b> <b>of</b> distribution is sensitive to the radial distribution of granules in the pipe immediately before entering the spreader mechanism. The <b>evenness</b> <b>of</b> distribution is also sensitive to the working height above the ground. The field will through its geometry (shape, slope and bumpiness) affect the working result in form of unevennesses in the spreading pattern, gaps and overlapping. Soil type variations and varying cultivation capacity demand variable application rates. The weather factors that mainly influence the spreading accuracy are wind speed, air temperature and relative humidity. The wind speed influences the length and direction of throw. Air temperature and moisture are together with the temperature of the fertilizer decisive for the water uptake of the fertilizer. Large water uptake will change the flow properties of the fertilizer in a negative direction. The operator is the overall regulator in the "granule spreading system". The operator adjusts and maintain the machine. It is the operator who choses driving technique and the way the work is done. A technically very good fertilizer spreader cannot compensate fully for a bad operator. The operator should have assistance in steering the tractor and information of and possibility to adjust the application rate. What requirements can be placed on the future fertilizer spreader? The requirements placed on the fertilizer spreader of the future involve large control ability, i. e. high spreading accuracy and possibility to continuously vary the application rate. Furthermore, some kind of control over the mass flow of fertilizer will be needed. This review of the literature is concluded with a presentation of a new type of fertilizer spreader. The concept gives precedence to low manufacturing cost, active metering mechanism, variable mass flow and even distribution of fertilizer to the spreader mechanisms...|$|R

Short of extinction, one can determine the integrated losses experienced by the ecosystem. These losses are aggregated into system level indicators, such as entropy, average gain/loss, average time to extinction, etc. The methodology is applied to 18 ecological flow networks available in the literature. We calculate the correlations between various indicators and determine high positive correlation between: number of nodes & maximal trophic level; connectedness & average entropy losses; number of nodes & average number of extinct nodes; and, maximum trophic level & <b>evenness</b> <b>of</b> links. A high negative correlation was found between: number of nodes & connectedness; connectedness & maximal trophic level; maximum tropic level & average entropy loss; and, connectedness & <b>evenness</b> <b>of</b> flows.

40|$|Indicator inks, {{previously}} {{shown to}} be capable of rapidly assessing photocatalytic activity via a novel photo-reductive mechanism, were simply applied via an aerosol spray onto commercially available pieces of ActivTM self-cleaning glass. Ink layers could be applied with high <b>evenness</b> <b>of</b> <b>spread,</b> with as little deviation as 5 % upon UV-visible spectroscopic assessment of 25 equally distributed positions over a 10 cm× 10 cm glass cut. The inks were comprised of either a resazurin (Rz) or dichloroindophenol (DCIP) redox dye with a glycerol sacrificial electron donor in an aqueous hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC) polymer media. The photo-reduction reaction under UVA light of a single spot was monitored by UV-vis spectroscopy and digital images attained from a flat-bed scanner in tandem for both inks. The photo-reduction of Rz ink underwent a two-step kinetic process, whereby the blue redox dye was initially reduced to a pink intermediate resorufin (Rf) and subsequently reduced to a bleached form of the dye. In contrast, a simple one-step kinetic process was observed for the reduction of the light blue redox dye DCIP to its bleached intermediates. Changes in red-green-blue colour extracted from digital images of the inks were inversely proportional to the changes seen at corresponding wavelengths via UV-visible absorption spectroscopy and wholly indicative of the reaction kinetics. The photocatalytic activity areas of cuts of ActivTM glass, 10 cm× 10 cm in size, were assessed using both Rz and DCIP indicator inks evenly sprayed over the films; firstly using UVA lamp light to activate the underlying ActivTM film (1. 75 mWcm− 2) and secondly under solar conditions (2. 06 ± 0. 14 mWcm− 2). The photo-reduction reactions were monitored solely by flatbed digital scanning. Red-green-blue values of a generated 14 × 14 grid (196 positions) that covered the entire area of each film image were extracted using a custom-built program entitled RGB Extractor(C). A homogenous degradation over the 196 positions analysed for both Rz (Red colour deviation = 19 % UVA, 8 % Solar; Green colour deviation = 17 % UVA, 12 % Solar) and DCIP (Red colour deviation = 22 % UVA, 16 % Solar) inks was seen in both UVA and solar experiments, demonstrating the consistency of the selfcleaning titania layer on ActivTM. The method presented provides a good solution for the high-throughput photocatalytic screening of a number of homogenous photocatalytically active materials simultaneously or numerous positions on a single film; both useful in assessing the homogeneity of a film or determining the best combination of reaction components to produce the optimum performance photocatalytic film...|$|E

40|$|The Juvenile Hormone {{analogue}} s-methoprene is used {{to protect}} stored grain from pests such as the lesser grain borer, Rhyzopertha dominica (F.). The possibility that uneven application influences s-methoprene efficacy against this species was investigated in the laboratory. Adults of methoprene-susceptible strains were exposed for 14 days to wheat treated at doses of up to 0. 6 mg kg- 1, or to mixtures of treated and untreated wheat giving equivalent average doses. Adult mortality after exposure to treated wheat was negligible in all cases (3. 3 %) {{and there was no}} significant effect of either average dose or <b>evenness</b> <b>of</b> application. In contrast, the number of adult progeny depended on both the average dose and <b>evenness</b> <b>of</b> application. Average doses of 0. 3 and 0. 6 mg kg- 1 reduced the number of live F 1 adults by 99 - 100 % relative to the untreated wheat and no effect <b>of</b> <b>evenness</b> <b>of</b> application was detected. At lower doses, however, efficacy tended to decrease with increasing unevenness of application. When adults from the parental generation were transferred to untreated wheat for another 14 days neither the average dose nor <b>evenness</b> <b>of</b> application in the wheat from which they came had any significant effect on reproduction of these adults. This study demonstrates that uneven application can reduce the efficacy of s-methoprene against R. dominica, but that this is unlikely to influence the performance of s-methoprene against susceptible populations at target doses likely to be used in practice (e. g. 0. 6 mg kg- 1 in Australia). However, the possibility that uneven application leads to underdosing and selects for resistance should be investigated...|$|R
