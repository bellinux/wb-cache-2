In many places, the IDL follows the 180° meridian exactly. In other places, however, the IDL deviates east or west away from that meridian. These various deviations generally accommodate the political and/or economic affiliations of the affected areas.|$|E

25|$|By 1924 many {{additional}} specially licensed amateurs {{were routinely}} making transoceanic contacts at distances of 6000 miles (~9600km) and more. On 21 September several amateurs in California completed two way contacts with an amateur in New Zealand. On 19 October amateurs in New Zealand and England completed a 90-minute two-way contact nearly <b>halfway</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> On October 10, the Third National Radio Conference made three shortwave bands available to U.S. amateurs at 80 meters (3.75MHz), 40 meters (7MHz) and 20 meters (14MHz). These were allocated worldwide, while the 10-meter band (28MHz) {{was created by}} the Washington International Radiotelegraph Conference on 25 November 1927. The 15-meter band (21MHz) was opened to amateurs in the United States on 1 May 1952.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, the Russians were {{preparing}} to reinforce their Far East Fleet by sending the Baltic Fleet, {{under the command of}} Admiral Zinovy Rozhestvensky. After a false start caused by engine problems and other mishaps, the squadron finally departed on 15 October 1904, and sailed <b>halfway</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> from the Baltic Sea to the Pacific via the Cape Route around the Cape of Good Hope {{in the course of a}} seven-month odyssey that was to attract worldwide attention. The fleet was forced to take this longer route after the Dogger Bank incident on 21 October 1904, where the Russian fleet fired on British fishing boats that they mistook for enemy torpedo boats. This caused the British to deny them access to the Suez Canal, thus forcing them around Africa, and nearly sparking a war with the United Kingdom (an ally of Japan, but neutral, unless provoked).|$|E

The location was suggested by Godrich, who had used the studio to produce records by Travis and Beck and {{thought it would be}} a [...] "good change of scenery" [...] for Radiohead. Yorke said: [...] "We were like, 'Do we want to fly <b>halfway</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> to do this?' But it was terrific, because we worked really hard. We did a track a day.

2500|$|The 1883 Krakatoa {{eruption}} darkened the sky worldwide {{for years}} afterwards, and produced spectacular sunsets {{throughout the world}} for many months. British artist William Ashcroft made thousands of colour sketches of the red sunsets <b>halfway</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> from Krakatoa {{in the years after}} the eruption. The ash caused [...] "such vivid red sunsets that fire engines were called out in New York, Poughkeepsie, and New Haven to quench the apparent conflagration."

5000|$|While Stearns {{believes}} that individual Christians and churches {{have a responsibility}} to take action to alleviate global poverty, he has discouraged unilateral action in which churches launch their own programs <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> Stearns has argued that churches [...] "think we can somehow tackle poverty using only amateurs and volunteers." [...] Churches hire expert consultants to assist them in managing their local congregations like successful businesses: music, accounting, audiovisual support, counseling, and building construction. Shouldn't Christians do the same to assist with realizing their global mission, which involves them in [...] "tackling complicated problems <b>halfway</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> world?" [...] Stearns says that solving poverty is incredibly complex, that it is more like rocket science in its difficulty than people realize.|$|R

2500|$|In {{a review}} in the Sunday Herald Sun Bryan Patterson gave Like It Like That a 4 out of 5 star rating and said, [...] "Happily, Sebastian's big soul songs have more of an upbeat New York sound than the slick and imposed LA {{production}} {{that seems to be}} the fate of most Idol winners. It is now time to forgive and forget that Sebastian had his start in a sometimes exploitative and often tacky TV talent show. When you're good – really good – inauspicious starts don't really matter Sebastian has paid his dues and finally found his sound. And it's good music, all written or co-written by the young man." [...] The Daily Telegraph music editor Kathy McCabe also gave the album 4 out of 5 stars saying, [...] "Sebastian steps up in songwriting and performance on the soul tracks which were no doubt inspired by his Memphis sessions detour. [...] "All to Myself" [...] is a knock-out song, and book-end song [...] "Attention" [...] is a sexy, hip-swinging soul number which perfectly showcases Sebastian's vocal range." [...] American radio announcer and music journalist Tony Peters wrote, [...] "Great soul music is still out there, you just gotta hunt for it. In this case, that means going <b>halfway</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> [...] "All to Myself" [...] and [...] "Attention" [...] both have that classic Motown stompin' feel that makes you move your feet, while [...] "Bring Yourself" [...] has conversational lyrics akin to Stevie Wonder's best work. Sebastian had a hand in composing the entire album, and he doesn't just re-write classic soul songs. He's obviously immersed himself in the genre and can truly add to it." ...|$|E
