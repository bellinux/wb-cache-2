40|$|Abstract—The {{modelling}} {{of military}} systems of systems invariably involves {{the incorporation of}} existing, often shared, models into larger and more complex simulations. The sharing of models between simulations {{has long been the}} goal of the simulation community and although the resulting simulations expand the application domain of the models it comes at a cost. In this paper the authors highlight one of the issues faced, namely the use of different coordinate frameworks on performance and quantifies the errors that could be introduced into the simulation. It starts by providing an overview of the most commonly used coordinate frameworks and then elaborates on some of the experiences gained through its application in the Virtual Ground Based Air Defence System (GBADS) simulator. The focus is on the mixing of flat earth convention and spherical earth convention. The authors conclude with further motivation why a common earth reference model should be used for all simulation entities and, more importantly, why it should be a “real world” earth reference model.

40|$|The International GNSS Service (IGS) is an {{international}} activity involving more than 200 participating organisations in over 80 countries with {{a track record of}} one and a half decades of successful operations. The IGS is a service of the International Association of Geodesy (IAG). It primarily supports scientific research based on highly precise and accurate Earth observations using the technologies of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), primarily the U. S. Global Positioning System (GPS). The mission of the IGS is “to provide the highestquality GNSS data and products in support of the terrestrial reference <b>frame,</b> <b>Earth</b> rotation, Earth observation and research, positioning, navigation and timing and other applications that benefit society”. The IGS will continue to support the IAG’s initiative to coordinate cross-technique global geodesy for the next decade, via the development of the Global Geodetic Observing System (GGOS), which focuses on the needs of global geodesy at the mm-level. IGS activities are fundamental to scientific disciplines related to climate, weather, sea level change, and space weather. The IGS also supports many other applications, including precise navigation, machine automation, and surveying and mapping.

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{processing}} steps of evaluating remote sensing data is the production of ortho images from the acquired raw scanner data. Since in most applications of thematic analysis, a rectified data set is required, {{there is a need}} for an effective – regarding time and accuracy- and generic – regarding different sensor systems – processor for performing this rectification for any desired sensor imagery. This is especially true when using the image data in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and for data fusion and analysis with data from different sources or seasons. The accuracy of this rectification result is crucial for overlaying the data with existing data sets or maps and using them for evaluations like change detection, map updating a. o [...] Triggered by the demand of an automatic processor embedded in the Data Information and Management System DIMS of DLR a generic ortho image tool was developed. The generic ortho image processor supports the production of ortho images from airborne and spaceborne digital line scanner images, as well as images from frame cameras.

40|$|The Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) is a {{joint mission}} between the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the Deutsches Zentrum für Luft und Raumfahrt (DLR e. V.). Principle Investigator is the University of Texas Center for Space Research (UTCSR). Responsibility for {{operational}} activities, like satellite safety, telemetry and telecommanding, maneuver planning and execution and formation keeping, belongs to the German Space Operations Center (GSOC), where this work was conducted during the first phases of the mission (LEOP). The twin GRACE satellites were launched on-board the Eurockot Rockot launcher on March 17, 2002, form Plesetsk, Russia. The current mission phase is the transition from commissioning into the science validation phase. GRACE mission goals include the generation of models for the time-variable gravity field of the Earth, to produce a long-term mean estimate of the Earth´s gravity field and to provide radio occulation profiles over the predicted five-year lifetime of the mission. From a scientific point of view, GRACE improves, upon the conventional methods, the gravity field determination by using differential, range-change measurements between twin, co-orbiting satellites and improved accelerometers. This formation-flying scenario ensures global, homogenious and high accuracy gravity measurements. The fundamental requirement for normal science activities of each satellite is to point at the predicted position of the other satellite, keeping the bore sight of the microwave link within a dead band as small as +- 0, 5 mrad (pitch and yaw) and +- 10 mrad in roll. The AOCS incorporates a trajectory generation algorithm, taking inputs from an on board SGP 4 (Simplified General Perturbations) orbit propagator, such that the relative position between the two satellites is computed to be within 50 m. This work was motivated by the necessity of verifying the correct behavior of the satellite during science operations and the attempt to improve AOCS pointing performance, especially after {{the failure of the}} inertial measurement unit on GRACE- 1, resulting in a higher gas consumption and and more thruster activations.

Furthermore the correlation between the attitude behavior and the mission environment (I. e. orbital position) is analyzed by the assesment of a GRACE science mode simulator including main disturbance torques (gravity gradient, aerodynamic drag, solar pressure and magnetic field) and validated using space telemetry data.

40|$|Scientific {{need and}} {{technological}} opportunity require that we move toward implementing a global network of geodetic fiducial stations which feature co-located SLR, VLBI, GNSS, and DORIS instrumentation. Earth {{science of the}} next decade will require more accurate global change measurements of sea level topography, sea level change, polar ice mass balance, hydrological and atmospheric mass flux. and topographic deformation, real time mm scale navigation and precision time transfer on a global scale. These scientific requirements have been translated into a goal of mm scale annual stability for the terrestrial reference <b>frame,</b> <b>earth</b> orientation parameters, {{as well as the}} orbit and clock determinations tbr the GNSS systems. To meet these challenges, the four geodetic observing systems must be more tightly integrated in technology, location, and analysis. NASA strongly supports the objectives of the IGGOS initiative vis NASA's National Geodetic Observatory and INDIGO programs. The Global networks of GNSS, SLR. and VLBI observatories are for the most part poorly suited for these new demands. These important geodetic networks have evolved with little planning yet these systems are providing essential measurements to a wide swath of society. New signal structures in the GPS and the developing Galileo GNSS will soon require replacement of the GNSS receivers. The SLR network is poorly distributed globally, requires labor intensive observations and analysis, {{and for the most part}} relies upon antiquated technology. The VLBI observatories utilize large radio telescopes in remote regions that are poorly distributed globally. Co-location of these networks is sparse and co-location errors contribute significantly to the observing error spectrum. Increasing use of the S and X band by commercial and other government services will also contribute to increased observational errors. The time is upon us for an international effort to develop an optimized global geodetic fiducial network of twelve or more integrated automated geodetic observatories that will provide in near real time high density mea. surements of Earth orientation, geodetic positioning, and GNSS system monitoring. The strategic goal for the optimized global fiducial network should be efficient autonomous operation, real time data streaming to analysis centers with an integrated near real time analysis capability for all four observing systems. These goals are achievable in the next decade given the dramatic technological improvements in all geodetic systems. For VLBI, the BKG TIGO might be viewed as a preliminary prototype of technology for fundamental stations. Mark 5, PC-VSI. e-VLBI broadband development efforts are laying the groundwork to reduce the aperture of the VLBI antennas and to allow for precision mm level co-location of observing systems. Operating costs and enhanced accuracy would accrue from the elimination of hydrogen maser clocks using double differencing, GNSS time transfer technology, GHz broadband recording, real time analysis, and mm wavelength VLBI observations. A global geodetic fiducial network will not be realizable without international efforts and the support of the four services...|$|E
