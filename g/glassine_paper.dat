50|$|<b>Glassine</b> (<b>paper)</b> is used {{by artists}} to protect artwork which is being stored or transported. Some good quality books of pastel papers also include {{glassine}} to separate pages.|$|E
50|$|Acid-free <b>glassine</b> <b>paper</b> is {{typically}} {{used to cover}} friable materials or objects with oily/tacky surfaces, as it is smooth and does not create static electricity, though it is only used for {{short periods of time}} because it deteriorates quickly.|$|E
50|$|Tyvek is a textile-like {{material}} {{created from}} high-density polyethylene, and {{works as an}} alternative to <b>glassine</b> <b>paper,</b> but its fabric-like quality also allows it to be draped over objects and utilized in numerous ways where paper products are not ideal.|$|E
5000|$|Sulfur-free {{weighing}} paper: Sulfur-free weighing {{paper is}} usually used for weighing food materials. It {{is made up}} bleached <b>glassine</b> pulp and <b>paper.</b> As a result, it prevents the reaction of sample with other organic solvents such as alcohol, or acetone.|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{relative}} humidity (RH) on formaldehyde penetration of <b>paper,</b> <b>glassine,</b> and cotton {{was determined by}} the death rate of bacterial spores in glass tubes covered with these materials. The data show that paper is readily penetrated regardless of RH, but the RH greatly affects the penetration rate of glassine and cotton. A comparison was also made of the effect of RH on the penetrability of formaldehyde generated from Formalin and paraformaldehyde. At low RH, all three closures were penetrated more readily by formaldehyde from paraformaldehyde than from Formalin, but no difference in the two was observed at high RH. It is felt that the difference at low RH is primarily due to the condensation of the vaporized Formalin...|$|R
40|$|Three bag types, i. e., PBS International (duraweb?), a Paper-&-Plastic bag, and Glassine were {{compared}} for their relative efficiency in producing a successful cross in Miscanthus under two environments of glasshouse and isolation chamber conditions. Crosses were attempted in 2013 at the Institute of Biological Environmental and Rural Sciences (IBERS), Aberystwyth University. ANOVA: The effect of two climatic conditions (glasshouse and isolation chambers) was non-significant on seed set {{and success of}} crosses. Bag type and Type of cross, however, had significant effect on seed setting upon pollination. None of the interactions were significant. Bag type effect: While the Glassine and Paper-&-Plastic types did not differ significantly, the PBS International bags were superior to the combined effect of other two types of bags with 12 % higher rate of success of crosses. The success rate of crosses with PBS? duraweb? bags was the highest at 45 %, which exceeded Glassine by 15 % and Paper-&-Plastic over 7 %. The Z-test revealed highly significant higher mean rate of success for the duraweb? bags than the combined mean success rate of Glassine and Paper-&-Plastic type of bags. Cross type effect: The success rate of crosses was significantly higher when crosses involved genotypes of the same Miscanthus species than when they represented different species. The mean success of crosses was 47 % from intraspecific crosses which was 13 % higher than the interspecific crosses. Seed traits: Seeds produced within PBS bags were significantly bolder (heavier) and presumably healthier for better seedling establishment under stress environments. Economic analysis: Average cost of a cross using different bags was computed from the actual spend. The most economical bags are those of PBS International duraweb? type which are cheaper by ? 55 pounds than glassine and ? 19 than Paper-&-Plastic type for a cross. The duraweb? bags give relative gain of 33 % over glassine and 15 % over Paper-&-Plastic type. Considering many crosses attempted in a breeding programme our simulations showed that for 1000 crosses, the duraweb? bags result in saving of ? 55, 000 over Glassine and ? 19, 000 over the Paper-&-Plastic type of bags. Even when 500 crosses are attempted the saving still remains very significant. Reuse: The PBS International bags stood up well to the different climatic conditions and were easy to re-use with an autoclave cycle in between. The Paper-&-Plastic bags were unable to withstand an autoclave cycle and so for single use bags were too costly. They were also a bit too short for use with Miscanthus species. The glassine bags became brittle under the different climatic conditions and as such were only usable once. Both of the <b>glassine</b> and the <b>paper</b> and plastic bags were damaged by slugs and were broken by the continued growth of the Miscanthus stems. These problems were not observed in the PBS bags...|$|R
5000|$|Stockbooks {{consist of}} a number of stiff pages, made up with {{horizontal}} pockets of manilla paper, <b>glassine</b> <b>paper</b> or clear film, into which stamps are placed. Collectors can insert stamps side by side in a row or can overlap stamps when individual viewing is not necessary. The pages, usually double-sided, are bound into book form. The most popular sizes comprise between 4 and 32 double-sided pages with each page interleaved with a glassine, or clear, sheet to prevent stamps on adjacent pages from touching.|$|E
5000|$|Until the mid-1980s, firecracker {{production}} was low-tech. They were handmade, beginning with rolling tubes. Once the firecracker tubes were rolled by hand (commonly from newspaper) and labelled, and then filled with powder, their ends were crimped and fuses inserted, all by hand. These finished firecrackers were usually braided into [...] "strings" [...] {{and sold in}} packs which came in many sizes, from the very small ("penny packs" [...] containing as few as four to six firecrackers) to the most common size packs (containing 16 and 20 crackers per pack), to larger packs (containing 24, 30, 32, 40, 50, 60, 72, 90, 100, and 120 firecrackers), to huge [...] "belts" [...] and [...] "rolls" [...] (packages containing strings of several hundred to several thousand crackers—Phantom Fireworks sells rolls as large as 16,000 firecrackers). Firecracker packages were wrapped in colourful and translucent <b>glassine</b> <b>paper,</b> as well as clear cellophane, with glassine the most popular.|$|E
30|$|Fabric soiling {{was done}} {{according}} to AATCC test method 130. On a bloating paper fabric specimen sized 4 ″×[*] 4 ″ was kept and approximately 0.2  ml of soil (mustard oil or hot coffee) {{was placed on}} it. On top of the soil pool, <b>glassine</b> <b>paper</b> was placed and a 2.3  kg weight with 2.5 ″ diameter cylinder covering the soil and rested for one minute to force the soil into the fabric. Weight and <b>glassine</b> <b>paper</b> were removed and soiled fabrics were aged in open air for two hours before laundering.|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} find the various {{developmental}} stages of the megagametophyte ten non-pollinated flower buds of different sizes from 50 inflorescences of plants, which were randomly selected, collected and fixed. The rest of the buds remained attached to the inflorescence so that they continued their growth. At the time of anthesis the flowers were emasculated and covered with <b>glassine</b> <b>paper</b> to prevent uncontrolled pollination. Once the stigmas were receptive two non-pollinated flowers per inflorescence were selected and fixed. The remaining flowers were emasculated and hand pollinated with pollen from P. tuberosa var. Double and unripe fruits with different days after pollination (1 DAP- 19 DAP) were collected in order to study the processes from fertilization to embryo development.|$|E
40|$|When {{considering}} what packaging material is optimal {{for a piece}} of biological evidence there are two vital things to consider: degradation and contamination (1). Biological evidence collected from a crime scene is brought to the laboratory, however, immediate testing upon arrival is highly unlikely (2). Therefore, the packaging must be suitable for transportation as well as storage. During the storage phase, if improper packaging is utilized, degradation and/or contamination could occur. General forensic practice is to dry biological samples before packaging, then package the evidence in a paper (breathable) container. This study investigated the use of kraft stock envelopes, plastic bags, glassine envelopes, Tyvek envelopes, evidence/syringe tubes, knife pouches, and Cap-Shure® plastic swab caps to package wet blood and semen samples. The packaging materials were evaluated in a humidity study, degradation study, and transfer study to determine if the biological specimen would remain intact and contained within the packaging. In the humidity study, it was determined that the kraft paper, <b>glassine</b> <b>paper,</b> and Tyvek® allowed for the passage of moisture, enabling the enclosed sample to readily dry. The plastic bag, evidence tube, and knife pouch created a difference in relative humidity above 20 %, thus increasing the ambient moisture concentration the samples were exposed to. In the degradation study, all samples were positive for their respective biological substance when tested with screening, presumptive, and confirmatory methods, however, bacteria were observed on samples that were packaged in plastic bags evidence tubes, and plastic caps. Additionally, only one sample, packaged in an evidence tube, yielded a DNA degradation index that implied degradation had occurred. The packaging materials were also tested to determine if the biological fluid would transfer through them, permitting cross-contamination. The kraft paper and one <b>glassine</b> <b>paper</b> did not provide a true barrier, as blood transferred through the envelopes onto a surrounding surface. The Tyvek®, knife pouch, and plastic bag all kept the wet blood contained within the package and no transfer to the surrounding surfaces occurred, although bloodstains on the interior of the Tyvek® and knife pouch could be visualized from the exterior. Overall, Tyvek® envelopes were determined to be an optimal packaging material for wet biological samples when compared to the other packaging materials used in this limited study due to their relative strength, ability to allow fluids to air dry and the lack of penetration of wet blood to the exterior surface...|$|E
40|$|Polylactic acid (PLA) and {{montmorillonite}} (CB) as filler {{were studied}} as coatings for cellulose based packages. Amorphous (AM) and semi crystalline (SC) PLA were used at different concentrations {{according to a}} 2 × 6 × 3 full factorial experimental design. CB loading was three concentrations and coating was performed by casting. Contact angle (CA), water vapor (WVP) and grease permeabilities were measured for each resultant package and were compared to commercial materials (<b>Glassine</b> <b>Paper,</b> Grease Proof Papers 1 and 2 produced commercially). Significant differences were found and the main factors were the type and concentration of PLA. The best values were: for grease penetration, + 1800 s; WVP from 161. 36 to 237. 8 g·µm·kPa− 1 ·m− 2 ·d− 1 and CA from 69 ° to 73 ° for PLA–AM 0. 5 % and CB variable. These parameters are comparable to commercial packages used in the food industry. DSC revealed three different thermal events for PLA–SC and just Tg for PLA–AM. Crystallinity was also verified, obtaining a ΔHcrys of 3. 7 J·g− 1 for PLA–SC and 14 J·g− 1 for PLA–SC–BC, evidencing clay interaction as a crystal nucleating agent. Differences found were explained on terms of the properties measured, where structural and chemical arrays of the coatings play a fundamental role for the barrier properties...|$|E
