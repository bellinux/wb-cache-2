5|$|Exposure to lead {{may also}} {{decrease}} lifespan and have health {{effects in the}} long term. <b>Death</b> <b>rates</b> {{from a variety of}} causes {{have been found to be}} higher in people with elevated blood lead levels; these include cancer, stroke, and heart disease, and general <b>death</b> <b>rates</b> from all causes. Lead is considered a possible human carcinogen based on evidence from animal studies. Evidence also suggests that age-related mental decline and psychiatric symptoms are correlated with lead exposure. Cumulative exposure over a prolonged period may have a more important effect on some aspects of health than recent exposure. Some health effects, such as high blood pressure, are only significant risks when lead exposure is prolonged (over about one year).|$|E

5|$|It is also widely {{believed}} that birth rates fell {{during the period}} too, meaning that {{the growth rate of}} the population fell relative to the natural death rate. Vansina, however, notes that precolonial societies had high birth and <b>death</b> <b>rates,</b> leading to a great deal of natural population fluctuation over time. Among the Kuba, the period 1880 to 1900 was actually one of population expansion.|$|E

5|$|Although fantasy {{comes from}} an imaginative realm, Martin sees an honest {{necessity}} to reflect the real world where people die sometimes ugly deaths, even beloved people. Main characters are killed off so that the reader will not expect the supposed hero to survive, and instead will feel the same tension and fear that the characters might. The novels also reflect the substantial <b>death</b> <b>rates</b> in war. The deaths of supernumerary extras or orcs have no major effect on readers, whereas a friend's death has much more emotional impact. Martin prefers a hero's sacrifice to say something profound about human nature.|$|E
5|$|Ecosystems are {{regularly}} confronted with natural environmental variations and disturbances {{over time and}} geographic space. A disturbance is any process that removes biomass from a community, such as a fire, flood, drought, or predation. Disturbances occur over vastly different ranges in terms of magnitudes as well as distances and time periods, and are both the cause and product of natural fluctuations in <b>death</b> <b>rates,</b> species assemblages, and biomass densities within an ecological community. These disturbances create places of renewal where new directions emerge from the patchwork of natural experimentation and opportunity. Ecological resilience is a cornerstone theory in ecosystem management. Biodiversity fuels the resilience of ecosystems acting {{as a kind of}} regenerative insurance.|$|E

5|$|Larvae pupate 5 to 10cm {{below the}} soil surface. Pupae are brown in color; they measure 5.5mm wide and 17 to 22mm long. The biggest {{environmental}} factor {{that affects the}} pupal developmental rate is temperature, primarily soil temperature. This is because proper insulation facilitates development, and soil temperatures below 0 degrees Celsius correlate to higher pupal mortality. Another factor that influences pupal development is soil moisture. Pupal mortality is high in wet soil, where the moisture level is between 18 and 25 percent. Dehydration {{can also lead to}} high <b>death</b> <b>rates</b> among pupae, if soil moisture is as low as 1 to 2 percent.|$|E

5|$|There {{were two}} {{clinical}} forms of smallpox. Variola major was the severe and most common form, {{with a more}} extensive rash and higher fever. Variola minor was a less common presentation, and a much less severe disease, with historical <b>death</b> <b>rates</b> of 1 percent or less. Subclinical (asymptomatic) infections with variola virus were noted but were not common. In addition, a form called variola sine eruptione (smallpox without rash) was seen generally in vaccinated persons. This form was marked by a fever that occurred after the usual incubation period and could be confirmed only by antibody studies or, rarely, by virus isolation.|$|E
5|$|With the British {{colonization}} of Georgia in 1732, the 13 colonies {{that would become}} the United States of America were established.

With extremely high birth rates, low <b>death</b> <b>rates,</b> and steady settlement, the colonial population grew rapidly. Relatively small Native American populations were eclipsed. The Christian revivalist movement of the 1730s and 1740s known as the Great Awakening fueled interest in both religion and religious liberty.|$|E

40|$|A {{modified}} Gompertz equation {{was used}} to model the effects of temperature (55, 60, and 65 C), sodium lactate (0, 2. 4, and 4. 8 %), and sodium diacetate (0, 0. 125, and 0. 25 %) on inactivation of Listeria monocytogenes strain MFS 102 (serotype 4 b) in frankfurter slurry. The effects of these factors were determined on the shouldering region (parameter A), maximum <b>death</b> <b>rate</b> (parameter B), and tailing region (parameter C) of microbial inactivation curves. Increased temperature or sodium diacetate concentrations increased the <b>death</b> <b>rate,</b> whereas increased sodium lactate concentrations decreased heat resistance. Complex two-way interactive effects were also observed. As both temperature and sodium lactate increased, the <b>death</b> <b>rate</b> decreased; however, as temperature and sodium diacetate increased, the <b>death</b> <b>rate</b> increased. The effect {{of the interaction between}} sodium lactate and sodium diacetate on the maximum <b>death</b> <b>rate</b> varied with temperature. Increases in both acidulants at temperatures above 56. 7 C decreased the <b>death</b> <b>rate,</b> whereas at temperatures below 56. 7 C, increases in both acidulants increased the <b>death</b> <b>rate.</b> To test for significant differences between treatments, D-values were calculated and compared. This comparison revealed that, in general, sodium lactate increased heat resistance and sodium diacetate decreased heat resistance of L. monocytogenes.

5|$|About half {{of those}} {{who lost their lives}} on the Wall were killed in the first five years after it was {{originally}} installed. <b>Death</b> <b>rates</b> fell from then on, and took a particularly dramatic downturn after 1976. Nearly 86% of the Wall's victims, 120 people, died between 1961 and 1975; between 1976 and 1989 only 19 died. Several factors account for this reduction. The Wall became even more impregnable owing to technical improvements carried out in the mid-1970s and more restrictions were put on the area adjoining the Wall, making it more difficult to reach in the first place. The signing of the Helsinki Accords in 1975 led to new opportunities to cross the border legally, resulting in a rise in emigration applications and a corresponding fall in escape attempts.|$|E

Slow lorises are also stress-sensitive and do not do well in captivity. Common health problems seen in pet slow lorises include undernourishment, tooth decay, diabetes, obesity, and kidney failure. Infection, stress, pneumonia, and poor nutrition lead to high <b>death</b> <b>rates</b> among pet lorises.

5|$|Bulgaria is in a {{state of}} {{demographic}} crisis. It has had negative population growth since the early 1990s, when the economic collapse caused a long-lasting emigration wave.

The total fertility rate (TFR) was estimated in 2013 at 1.43 children born/woman, which is below the replacement rate of 2.1.
