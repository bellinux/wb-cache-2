40|$|The {{nature of}} the auditor-client {{relationship}} is a complex aggregate involving a number of groups and individuals between both parties. Although auditor-client relationship is an important subject in the accounting and auditing literature, what has not been extensively studied is the complex relationship between the clients accounting staff and the external audit group at subordinate organization level. Thus, {{the purpose of this}} study is to dig deeper into the relationship between clients accounting staff and external audit team consisting of <b>junior</b> and senior <b>auditors</b> and to find out what characterizes this relationship. We also aim to look it from knowledge management and trust perspectives since these are special characteristics of both professions. In order to find empirical results we conducted a qualitative research with a case study by interviewing three accountants and one controller in the same mother company who do financial work for four subsidiaries. They all work together with several auditor groups and therefore could provide us a good comparison to our results. Our study reveals that the relationship is maintained on the subordinate level by the senior auditor who works not only as an auditor but also as a relationship manager. Furthermore, we identify the fact that lower competence of <b>junior</b> <b>auditors</b> creates problems in relationship with client’s accountants. Therefore, our accountant respondents are more likely to allocate low trust to inexperienced <b>junior</b> <b>auditors,</b> specially due to the fact that accountants are the ones teaching the <b>junior</b> <b>auditors</b> in specific accounting issues which is time consuming and often leads to irritation on the accountants side. However, accountants’ trust towards the senior auditors turns out to be high due to recognized expertise knowledge of senior auditors based on our interviews. ...|$|R

40|$|Recent audit {{research}} has indicated that <b>junior</b> <b>auditors</b> tend to use e-mail for client inquiries. Additionally, audit firms have expressed concerns regarding the ability of <b>junior</b> <b>auditors</b> to communicate professionally. In this study, I investigate whether receiving an auditor inquiry via e-mail differentially affects client responses as compared to more traditional modes of inquiry and whether those responses are affected by the auditor’s professional tone. In an experiment, experienced business professionals respond to a request for information from an auditor regarding a potential accounting adjustment. I varied the communication mode of the request (e-mail, audio, or visual) and the professional tone of the communication (more vs. less professional tone) and then measured the extent to which participants revealed information that either supported or did not support the client’s accounting position. I find that an auditor e-mail inquiry results in client responses that are more biased towards items that support the client’s position as compared to audio or visual inquiries. In addition, I find that clients respond in a more biased manner when the inquiry is worded in a less professional tone as compared to a more professional tone and that this tendency may be exacerbated when they receive the request via e-mail. Further underscoring the implications of these findings for audit outcomes, I find that clients are less likely to agree with an auditor’s proposed income-decreasing adjustment if the client did not personally reveal applicable information to the auditor...|$|R
40|$|Employee {{turnover}} {{has long}} been an issue within the audit profession and is generally considered to {{have a negative impact on}} auditing firms. As auditing firms rely on the skills and knowledge of their employees, the recruitment process is crucial in order to appoint candidates who will benefit the firm. Previous research has studied the turnover within audit firms, where the majority of the studies have focused on why employees choose to leave. While previous research mainly focuses on the individual’s perspective, the purpose of this thesis will be to explore how audit firms’ HR-departments work with the recruitment of <b>junior</b> <b>auditors</b> from a turnover perspective.  A model that illustrates the recruitment process has been created through researching theories and literature regarding turnover. In order to collect information, semi-structured interviews were used. The questions were based on the created model and the literature presented throughout the thesis. Interviews were held with HR-respondents in order to explore their view on the recruitment process. <b>Junior</b> <b>auditors</b> were also interviewed in order to explore their perception of the recruitment process, and to identify if there were any differences from the HR-respondents’ views.  Our findings indicate that the participating firms’ recruitment process is both extensive and well developed in order to make sure that they hire a suitable candidate. It did not become apparent that the firms focused on tenure during the employment selection, although the well-established structure of the recruitment process might indirectly impact the turnover situation. Our results also indicate that firms invest much time and resource into their marketing activities and that they value the personal competence of their candidates greatly...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is motivated}} by recent changes in financial reporting regulation effected by the adoption of IFRS in Europe, Australia, and Canada, and SFAS 142 (FASB 2001) and SFAS 157 (FASB 2007 and 2011) in the U. S., that significantly increased users’ exposure to fair values. The implementation of the fair value hierarchy, {{as well as the}} switch from amortization to impairment testing of goodwill, highlighted problems with auditing highly complex, judgment-dependent and inherently uncertain fair values. There is a concern that such fair values may not always be auditable, and that requiring auditors to provide positive assurance on them may necessitate changes to the financial reporting model. The dissertation consists of two parts, the process study and the elicitation study. The process study, using the audit of goodwill/cash generating unit (CGU) impairment under IFRS as a specific example, provides quasi-experimental evidence about the fair value auditing process which can help to better understand and improve the auditing of complex fair values. The study relies on an analysis of verbal protocols to develop an understanding of how auditors and valuation specialists deal with the task. The study finds that for all of the participants who developed an auditor’s range, the width of the range is many times the audit materiality, and intervals for the experienced auditors are narrower on average than those for <b>junior</b> <b>auditors.</b> There are signs of possible issues with both interpretation and application of fair value auditing and accounting standards across all groups of the participants. At least some of the issues with application of the standards appear to be related to judgmental shortcuts (heuristics) which have not been researched in a valuation task context in prior auditing literature. Some of the experienced and <b>junior</b> <b>auditors</b> do not appear to have a complete grasp of the applicable valuation methodology. Finally, the results shed light on the division of responsibilities between assurance and valuation groups and the use of third party experts when auditing fair value impairments. The process study contributes to the literature by obtaining direct quasi-experimental evidence on auditors’ and valuation specialists’ process when they perform a fair value auditing task, and investigating the process differences among auditors with different levels of experience and experts. The objective of the elicitation study is to develop techniques that can be used by auditors and valuation specialists when auditing complex fair values, by experimentally testing elicitation methods for fair value models’ parameters. The study tests two probability distribution elicitation methods - the cumulative distribution function (CDF) method and the credible interval (CI) method. Quantitative analysis performed in this study indicates that the CDF method has a potential to improve the participants’ unaided judgment regarding fair value intervals, at least for <b>junior</b> <b>auditors,</b> while the CI method does not yield similar improvement. When the two methods are compared to each other, the CDF method proves to be more effective for experienced and <b>junior</b> <b>auditors,</b> while the opposite is true for valuation specialists. The distributions developed {{with the help of the}} CDF method are subjected to the effects of anchoring heuristic to a lesser degree than those built using the CI method. Qualitative analysis based on verbal protocols in the elicitation study indicates that the CDF distribution elicitation method surpasses the CI method for the purposes of quantification of uncertainty inherent in complex fair value estimates. The study contributes to the literature by combining auditing and elicitation research in fair value auditing settings, and has a potential to improve the practice of auditing of goodwill and possibly other complex fair values, by providing information for the development of relevant decision aids...|$|R

40|$|An {{inherent}} {{aspect of}} an audit {{is the level}} of task complexity that <b>junior</b> <b>auditors</b> (staff and senior level associates) endure on a daily basis. This complexity directly impacts an auditor’s ability to form an appropriate problem representation, which in turn impacts judgment performance. One of the key components of this process is having sufficient knowledge for purposes of problem representation; without it, the auditor’s problem representation and ultimately judgment performance are negatively impacted. Conversely, audit teams can positively influence the conciseness of problem representation and performance by way of effective task-specific knowledge transfer. Knowledge transfer in the audit field occurs during three distinct phases: when an auditor reviews prior and/or current year workpapers; when an auditor requests help; and/or during the workpaper review process. For purposes of efficiency and increasing (i. e. improving) problem representation, prior to any deleterious effects, it’s critical that the audit profession understand how to maximize the knowledge transfer as soon as possible after the auditor’s initial assignment of the task. Because auditors commonly will immediately refer to audit programs in the current year documentation in the electronic audit file to gain an understanding of the task, maximizing the knowledge transfer within the electronic audit file is critical to increasing auditor judgment performance. I propose utilizing media richness theory to establish an increased media rich transfer of knowledge via the electronic audit file from the audit managers (expert) to <b>junior</b> <b>auditors</b> (novice). Procedure screens within the electronic audit file would likely be categorized as “written, formal” mediums within the media richness theory, because the source of information is impersonal. However, if audit firms can successfully transform the transfer of information within the audit files from being solely formal document screens to also incorporate personal source characteristics, they will successfully increase the information richness, which will allow for a more successful transfer of knowledge and subsequently the ability for the auditor to more effectively form a problem representation...|$|R
