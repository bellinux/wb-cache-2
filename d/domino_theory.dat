To combat the NLF and {{to shore up the}} government in the south, the U.S. initially delivered monetary aid, military advisors, and supplies. Between 1957 and 1963, the U.S. found itself committed, through its acceptance of the policy of containment and belief in the <b>domino</b> <b>theory,</b> to defending South Vietnam from what it saw as expansive communist aggression.|$|E

However, compared with China's rise today, it is interesting to observe the theory's failed prediction and misinterpretation of empirical evidences. This article aims to close the gulf between theory and reality and improve on models that attempt to forecast China's future. <b>Domino</b> <b>theories</b> and pessimistic predictions about communist states fail {{to take into account the}} CCP's ability to react and respond to changes and challenges from the outside world. This article tackles the issue from the approach of state capacity theory. 天安門事件後的中國崩潰論，直到九○年代的中後期，仍在國際間不絕於耳。但若對照當今的中國崛起，則這都屬理論預測或經驗判斷對事實的落差或預測失準，這是值得研究的。至於，如何解釋與調適崩潰論與現實中國的落差，並嘗試改善對中國預測的模型，則是本文之研究目的。共產國家國際結構骨牌分析以及政治保守、經濟改革的崩潰預測，其推論過程都忽略中共因素的反應與抵制，以及中共回應外界變遷與挑戰的能力。本文擬從國家能力觀點對上述議題作分析...|$|R

Following the establishment of relations, Malaysia expanded its relations to other Soviet influence countries such as Poland, Romania, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic and Yugoslavia. During the time, the Soviets were also keen to develop the relations by promoting Russian culture with cooperations such as the exchanging of radio and television programmes, artists and in educational field.

25|$|The U.S. became {{polarized}} {{over the}} war. Many supporters of U.S. involvement argued {{for what was}} known as the <b>domino</b> <b>theory,</b> a theory that believed if one country fell to communism, then the bordering countries would be sure to fall as well, much like falling dominoes. This theory was largely held due to the fall of eastern Europe to communism and the Soviet sphere of influence following World War II. However, military critics of the war pointed out that the Vietnam War was political and that the military mission lacked any clear idea of how to achieve its objectives. Civilian critics of the war argued that the government of South Vietnam lacked political legitimacy, or that support for the war was completely immoral.|$|E
500|$|The {{relationship}} between the First World and the Third World {{is characterized by the}} very definition of the Third World. Because countries of the Third World were noncommittal and non-aligned with both the First World and the Second World, they were targets for recruitment. In the quest for expanding their sphere of influence, the United States [...] (core of the First World) tried to establish pro US regimes in the Third World. In addition, because the Soviet Union [...] (core of the Second World) also wanted to expand, the Third World often became a site for conflict. Some examples include Vietnam and Korea. Success lay with the First World if {{at the end of the}} war, the country became capitalistic and democratic, and with the Second World, if the country became communist. While Vietnam as a whole was eventually communized, only the northern half of Korea remained communist. The <b>Domino</b> <b>Theory</b> largely governed United States policy regarding the Third World and their rivalry with the Second World. In light of the <b>Domino</b> <b>Theory,</b> the U.S. saw winning the proxy wars in the Third World as a measure of the [...] "credibility of U.S. commitments all over the world".|$|E

500|$|According to his biographer Anne Blair, Serong {{believed}} in the need {{to prevent the spread}} of communism throughout South East Asia, conceiving his mission in South Vietnam in terms of the <b>Domino</b> <b>Theory.</b> In August 1964, Sir Walter Cawthorn, then head of the Australian Secret Intelligence Service (ASIS), had instructed Serong to [...] "...Get me ten years...", time that had to be bought to strengthen the other nations of the region against insurgency, as well as to destroy the Soviet Union economically. After handing over command of the AATTV to Colonel David Jackson in 1965, Serong remained in Vietnam as an advisor, seconded to the US Department of State. In 1965 he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) for [...] "outstanding courage and devotion to duty" [...] while commanding the AATTV. During the two-and-half years he led the team he had worked hard to remain in personal contact with its members despite their geographic dispersion, and on occasion while visiting advisors in outstations he had become involved with clashes with the enemy during which his courage and leadership [...] "contributed to the success of operations". Serong declined a formal presentation of the award. From 1965 to 1967 he was senior advisor to the South Vietnamese Police Field Force. Serong left the Australian Army in August 1968, at which time he was granted the honorary rank of brigadier.|$|E
500|$|The Philippines and Thailand {{were the}} only Southeast Asian {{countries}} that actually participated in the organization. Both shared close ties with the United States, particularly the Philippines, and both faced incipient communist insurgencies against their own governments. Thailand became a member upon {{the discovery of the}} newly founded [...] "Thai Autonomous Region" [...] (the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture) in Yunnan (in South West China) – apparently feeling threatened by potential Chinese communist subversion on its land. Other regional countries like Burma and Indonesia were far more mindful of domestic internal stability rather than any communist threat, and thus rejected joining it. Malaya (including Singapore) also chose to not participate formally, though it was kept updated with key developments due to its close relationship with the United Kingdom. The rest of Southeast Asian countries: Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos were prevented from taking part in any international military alliance {{as a result of the}} Geneva Agreements signed 20 July of the same year concluding the end of the First Indochina War. However, with the lingering threat coming from communist North Vietnam and the possibility of the <b>domino</b> <b>theory</b> with Indochina turning into a communist frontier, SEATO got these countries under its protection – an act that would be considered to be one of the main justifications for the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War. Cambodia, however rejected the protection in 1956.|$|E
500|$|Wilton {{accepted}} the <b>domino</b> <b>theory</b> and never wavered in {{his commitment to}} Vietnam, but as early as mid-1967 he doubted that the war could be won unless the US was prepared to go all out and invade the North. Cautious about expanding Australia's involvement, he advocated deploying a Centurion tank squadron rather than a third infantry battalion when calls came to increase {{the strength of the}} task force in Vietnam, but in the end the Federal government announced both commitments in October 1967. Wilton also advised the government to reject any requests from the US command in Vietnam to rotate the Australian task force out of Phuoc Tuy and display its capabilities in a wider operational arena, reasoning that it was more important for the troops to remain in the countryside they knew and continue to build relations with the local people. He nevertheless strongly backed the Australian task force commander, Brigadier Ronald Hughes, when the latter was criticised at home for conducting [...] "American style operations" [...] outside the immediate vicinity of Phuoc Tuy, such as the set-piece battles of Fire Support Bases Coral and Balmoral in mid-1968. Conflict continued to simmer between the Army and the RAAF regarding air support, and Wilton oversaw discussions between Daly and Murdoch that secured a separate Army air organisation, leading to the formation of the Australian Army Aviation Corps in July 1968. On 22August, the Federal government announced that Wilton would be promoted to general, effective 1September, in recognition of his [...] "outstanding contribution to the Commonwealth in his present appointment". He was the first Australian officer to attain the rank since Blamey, twenty-seven years before.|$|E

Eisenhower explained the escalation risk, introducing what he {{referred to as the}} [...] "domino principle", which eventually became the concept of <b>domino</b> <b>theory.</b> During the Korean War, the conflict in Vietnam was also seen {{as part of a broader}} proxy war with China and the USSR in Asia.|$|E
2500|$|Podhoretz {{suggests}} that the struggle against Communism {{is linked to the}} struggle against Nazism, because each represents totalitarianism. The <b>Domino</b> <b>Theory</b> was, in Podhoretz's eyes, vindicated by the U.S. withdrawal from Vietnam, rather than being discredited. Of Podhoretz's Why We Were in Vietnam, one critic asserted that [...] "Time and again the footnote for a crucial argument directs the reader to Guenter Lewy's America in Vietnam, a book whose historical objectivity, to put it mildly, is not accepted by all sides." ...|$|E
2500|$|The U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff wrote Secretary of Defense Johnson that French Indochina Vietnam was [...] "a vital segment in {{the line}} of {{containment}} of communism stretching from Japan southward and around to the Indian peninsula." [...] The Chiefs said that the fall of Indochina to communism would result in the fall of Burma and Thailand and probably the fall of the Philippines, Malaya, and Indonesia. [...] This {{was one of the first}} expressions of the so-called <b>Domino</b> <b>Theory</b> which would become a prominent determinant in U.S. policy.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{element of}} the American {{opposition}} to the war was the perception that U.S intervention in Vietnam, which had been argued as acceptable due to the <b>Domino</b> <b>Theory</b> and the threat of Communism, was not legally justifiable. Some Americans believed that the Communist threat was used as a scapegoat to hide imperialistic intentions, while others argued that the American intervention in South Vietnam interfered with the [...] "self-determination" [...] of the country. They felt that the war in Vietnam was a civil war that ought to have determined the fate of the country and, therefore, America was not right to intervene.|$|E
2500|$|Despite the {{increasingly}} depressing {{news of the}} war, many Americans continued to support President Johnson's endeavors. Aside from the <b>domino</b> <b>theory</b> mentioned above, {{there was a feeling}} that the goal of preventing a communist takeover of a pro-Western government in South Vietnam was a noble objective. Many Americans were also concerned about saving face in the event of disengaging from the war or, as President Richard M. Nixon later put it, [...] "achieving Peace with Honor." [...] In addition, instances of Viet Cong atrocities were widely reported, most notably in an article that appeared in Reader's Digest in 1968 entitled The Blood-Red Hands of Ho Chi Minh.|$|E

2500|$|At Kennedy's death, {{there were}} 16,000 American {{military}} personnel stationed in Vietnam; these personnel supported South Vietnam in the Vietnam War against North Vietnam. Vietnam had been partitioned at the 1954 Geneva Conference into two countries, with North Vietnam {{led by a}} Communist government. Johnson subscribed to the <b>Domino</b> <b>Theory</b> in Vietnam and to a containment policy that required America to make a serious effort to stop all Communist expansion. On taking office, Johnson immediately reversed Kennedy's order to withdraw 1,000 military personnel {{by the end of}} 1963. In late summer 1964, Johnson seriously questioned the value of staying in Vietnam but, after meeting with Secretary of State Dean Rusk and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Maxwell D. Taylor, declared his readiness [...] "to do more when we had a base" [...] or when Saigon was politically more stable. He expanded the numbers and roles of the American military following the Gulf of Tonkin Incident.|$|E
2500|$|Pius XII {{was rather}} distrustful of Alcide de Gasperi and Italy's Christian Democrats, {{considering}} the party indecisive and fractious– reformist currents within it particularly, which tended to the moderate Left– {{represented by the}} Sicilian priest Luigi Sturzo for example– he considered too accommodating to the Left. On {{the eve of the}} 1952 local elections in Rome, in which again the Communist and Socialist parties threatened to win out, he used informal connections to make his views known. Pius XII stated that the war against communism was a holy war and excommunicated members of the Communist Party. Having decided to encourage the Christian Democrats to consider a political alliance with the Rightist parties as part of an anti-left coalition, he asked the Jesuit, Father Riccardo Lombardi, to speak with de Gasperi to consider such an alliance– an electoral alliance with those even of monarchist and neo-fascist tendencies -including the Italian Social Movement. Adopting a <b>domino</b> <b>theory</b> he warned that, if [...] "the Communists win in Rome, in Italy, it will cast a shadow on the entire world: France would become Communist, and then Spain and then all of Europe'. de Gasperi rejected the idea as politically dangerous to the long term fortunes of a centrist Catholic party.|$|E
2500|$|As for {{the armed}} forces of the North Vietnamese and National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam (NLF), American readers rarely {{encountered}} the argument that the communists were waging a war of reunification rather than [...] "a campaign to further the interests of a communist conspiracy masterminded by the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union." [...] The <b>domino</b> <b>theory</b> was utilized to justify the American intervention in order to prevent regional domination by China, overlooking centuries of hostility between the Vietnamese and the Chinese. Throughout the war communist troops were continuously portrayed as [...] "brutal, cruel, fanatic, sinister, untrustworthy, and warlike". Most depictions of [...] employed hateful imagery or reinforced racial stereotypes of the era associated with Asians." [...] Asian stereotypes extended to the American soldiers' view of their South Vietnamese allies too; most effectively never met a South Vietnamese soldier or really knew the farmer and peasant in the field. The media {{went so far as to}} follow the lead of the American military by refusing to refer to communist forces by their correct titles. NLF forces were referred to by the term Viet Cong (despite its wide usage, [...] "Viet Cong", which means [...] "Vietnamese Communist", is considered pejorative [...] ) and northern troops of the People's Army of Vietnam as the North Vietnamese Army, or NVA.|$|E
2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1884, Gordon {{had no interest in}} the Sudan and had just been hired to work as an officer with the newly established Congo Free State. Gordon [...] despite or rather because of his war hero status [...] disliked publicity and tried to avoid the press when he was in Britain. While staying with his sister in Southampton, Gordon received an unexpected visitor, namely William Thomas Stead, the editor of the Pall Mall Gazette, whom Gordon reluctantly agreed to do an interview with. Gordon wanted to talk about the Congo, but Stead kept on pressing him to talk about the Sudan; finally after much prompting on Stead's part Gordon opened up and attacked Gladstone's Sudan policy, coming out for an intervention to crush the Mahdi. Gordon offered up a 19th-century version of the <b>domino</b> <b>theory,</b> claiming: The danger arises from the influence which the spectacle of a conquering Mahometan [...] Power established close to your frontiers will exercise upon the population which you govern. In all the cities of Egypt it will be felt that what the Mahdi has done they may do; and, as he has driven out the intruder, they may do the same. Stead published his interview on 9 January 1884 {{on the front page of}} the Pall Mall Gazette alongside the leader (editorial) he had written entitled [...] "Chinese Gordon for the Sudan". Urban wrote: [...] "With this leader, William Stead's real motive in going to Southampton revealed itself at last.
