5|$|Sugar {{had been}} a major export <b>from</b> <b>Hawaii</b> since Captain James Cook's arrival in 1778. During the 1850s, the U.S. import tariff on sugar <b>from</b> <b>Hawaii</b> was {{much higher than the}} import tariffs Hawaiians were {{charging}} the U.S., and Kamehameha III sought reciprocity.|$|E
5|$|When Iowan began sailing for American-Hawaiian, {{the company}} shipped cargo from East Coast ports via the Straits of Magellan to West Coast ports and Hawaii, and vice versa. Eastbound {{shipments}} were primarily sugar and pineapple <b>from</b> <b>Hawaii,</b> while westbound cargoes were more general in nature. With {{the opening of}} the Panama Canal on 15 August 1914, American-Hawaiian ships switched to taking that route.|$|E
5|$|Carter and Frank Spotnitz wrote major {{parts of}} the script in Hawaii over Christmas 1996. They used the same method that they had used when writing episodes and {{sketching}} out scenes for the series on 3x5 index cards. By the time the Christmas break had ended, the whole narrative for the film had been written. Upon his return <b>from</b> <b>Hawaii,</b> Carter looked for spare time to write the script. He returned to Hawaii and in ten days wrote {{about half of the}} 124-page screenplay for the film.|$|E

5|$|Drosera anglica {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely {{distributed}} sundews in the world. It is generally circumboreal, meaning that it is found at high latitudes around the globe. In a few areas, however, it is found farther south, particularly in Japan, southern Europe, the Hawaiian island of Kauai, and California. Plants <b>from</b> <b>Hawaii,</b> where it is known as mikinalo, are generally smaller than normal and do not experience a winter dormancy period. Its natural habitat includes 12 U.S. states, including Alaska, and 11 Canadian provinces and territories. The altitudinal range is from 5m to at least 2000m.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{establishment}} of the Territory of Hawaii in 1900, White {{became a member of the}} Home Rule Party, which was formed by the former leaders of Hui Aloha ʻĀina and Hui Kālaiʻāina. The party consisted of Native Hawaiians who had been leaders during the monarchy and other former royalists and loyalists such as Robert William Wilcox, who was elected the first congressional delegate <b>from</b> <b>Hawaii</b> under the Home Rule ticket. During this period, the party would share the political stage and contend with the Republicans and Democrats.|$|E
5|$|In May 1905, {{after two}} years of negotiations, American-Hawaiian signed a {{contract}} with the Tehuantepec National Railway of Mexico, abandoning the Straits of Magellan route in favor of the Tehuantepec Route. Shipments on the Tehuantepec Route would arrive at Mexican ports—Salina Cruz, Oaxaca, for eastbound cargo, and Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz, for westbound cargo—and would traverse the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, Mexico's narrowest point, on the railroad. Eastbound shipments were primarily sugar and pineapple <b>from</b> <b>Hawaii,</b> while westbound cargoes were more general in nature.|$|E

5|$|Kīlauea {{is one of}} five subaerial volcanoes {{that make}} up the island of Hawaii, created by the Hawaii hotspot. The oldest volcano on the island, Kohala, is more than a million years old, and Kīlauea, the youngest, is {{believed}} to be between 300,000 and 600,000 years of age; Lōʻihi Seamount on the island's flank is even younger, but has yet to breach the surface. Thus it is the second youngest volcano in the Hawaiian – Emperor seamount chain, a chain of shield volcanoes and seamounts extending <b>from</b> <b>Hawaii</b> to the Kuril–Kamchatka Trench in Russia.|$|E

5|$|Throughout Guillermo's track, {{the storm}} never {{threatened}} any major landmass, resulting in {{little impact on}} land. However, because of its extreme intensity, it produced large swells across the Pacific Ocean, affecting areas <b>from</b> <b>Hawaii</b> to coastal Mexico. Along the American Pacific coast, three people drowned amid high waves, two in Baja California and one in California. At its peak, Guillermo was the second strongest known Pacific hurricane on record; however, it has since been surpassed by seven other storms, including Linda later that year. The effects of Guillermo were not deemed severe enough to justify retirement of its name.|$|E

The hurricane crossed the International Dateline on September8 and was reclassified as typhoon. Remaining well away from land, the cyclone steadily weakened to a tropical storm by September12. Gradually turning north and later east, the degrading cyclone transitioned into an extratropical cyclone four days later and ultimately dissipated on September17 near the International Dateline.|$|E

In the general election of 1904, he unsuccessfully challenged Prince Jonah Kūhiō Kalanianaʻole, a Republican, for the position of congressional delegate <b>from</b> <b>Hawaii</b> on the Democratic ticket. In the 1906 election, he was elected as the second sheriff of the County of Honolulu, succeeding Arthur M. Brown. He served in this position from 1907 to 1909. He was a trustee of the Queen's Medical Center from 1905 to 1909.|$|E
5|$|With Finney's help, Mau {{was awarded}} a special {{fellowship}} at the East-West Center. Mau returned to Honolulu in April 1975 to begin work with the Hawaii-based Polynesian Voyaging Society, eventually navigating the double-hulled canoe, Hōkūle‘a, <b>from</b> <b>Hawaii</b> to Tahiti on its maiden voyage in 1976. Mau trained and mentored Native Hawaiian navigator Nainoa Thompson, who would later become a master navigator. David Henry Lewis, a scholar of Polynesian navigation, documented Mau's work.|$|E

5|$|After 1886 Purvis {{became a}} {{resident}} of Hanamaulu, {{on the island of}} Kauai. He was appointed Animal Inspector for Kauai on November14, 1887. In May 1888 he left the Hawaiian Islands for the United States for his health. Settling in Colorado Springs, Colorado, he initially wrote home stating that he was improving, but his condition worsened. His brother Theodore traveled all the way <b>from</b> <b>Hawaii</b> to see him for the last time before he died on August16, 1888. He was 31 {{years old at the time}} of his death. His brother-in-law Edmund William Holdsworth was chosen as administrator of his estate; Purvis' will, written on April22, left everything to his brother Theodore Purvis. His remains were interred in the Evergreen Cemetery in Colorado Springs.|$|E
5|$|Despite stating {{during the}} press tour {{that there would}} be no live album from the tour, the {{performances}} at Sydney Entertainment Centre – Sydney on 7 and 9 November 1987 were filmed and released on video as Glass Spider in 1988. An edit of this show was subsequently aired in the US in an ABC TV concert special, ABC's first concert special since airing Elvis Presley's Aloha <b>from</b> <b>Hawaii</b> in 1973. A 2007 DVD re-release of the show included an audio recording of the performance at the Olympic Stadium, Montreal on 30 August 1987. The 6 June 1987 Platz der Republik (Reichstag – City Of Berlin Festival) performance was broadcast live on FM Radio.|$|E
5|$|Finney {{disagreed}} with the accidental voyaging portion of Sharp's hypothesis. To investigate the problem, he founded the Polynesian Voyaging Society with Herb Kane and Tommy Holmes in 1973, intent on building a voyaging canoe to sail <b>from</b> <b>Hawaii</b> to Tahiti to test whether intentional two-way voyaging throughout Oceania could be replicated. With the help of Mau's navigational knowledge guiding Hōkūle‘a, the Polynesian Voyaging Society demonstrated that intentional voyaging was not only possible, but also the ancestors of the Polynesians could have settled the Pacific on similar voyages using non-instrument wayfinding techniques such as Mau's. Finally, linguistic and archaeological {{evidence suggests that the}} history of the Polynesian people does not originate in the East Pacific but in the West. Recent developments in the field of DNA analysis have unequivocally settled the debate of Polynesian origin. They prove Polynesians share common ancestry with indigenous Taiwanese and East Asians.|$|E
