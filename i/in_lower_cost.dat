25|$|Note {{that the}} above income {{thresholds}} may vary greatly based on region due to {{significant differences in}} average income based on region and urban, suburban, or rural development. In more expensive suburbs, the threshold for the top 15% of income earners may be much higher. For example, in 2006 the ten highest income counties had median household incomes of $85,000 compared to a national average of about $50,000. The top 15% of all US income earners nationally {{tend to be more}} concentrated in these richer suburban counties where the cost of living is also higher. If middle-class households earning between the 50th percentile ($46,000) and the 85th percentile ($62,500) tend to live <b>in</b> <b>lower</b> <b>cost</b> of living areas, then their difference in real income may be smaller than what the differences in nominal income suggest.|$|E

5000|$|Application {{rates of}} [...] {{appear to be}} {{required}} to produce significant improvements in plant yields. Biochar costs in developed countries vary from $300-7000/tonne, generally too high for the farmer/horticulturalist and prohibitive for low-input field crops. In developing countries, constraints on agricultural biochar relate more to biomass availability and production time. An alternative is to use small amounts of biochar <b>in</b> <b>lower</b> <b>cost</b> biochar-fertilizer complexes.|$|E
50|$|A side-effect of high urban housing valuations was a {{drift into}} rural hinterlands to live <b>in</b> <b>lower</b> <b>cost</b> housing. This {{happened}} on a substantial {{scale in the}} Greater Dublin area in counties Wicklow, Kildare, Meath, Louth, and Carlow. This resulted in infrastructural pressure being placed on rural villages and provincial towns as residential developments exceeded the pace of both infrastructural development and provision of services for the growing population.|$|E

50|$|The Magnus Harmonica Corporation (originally the International Plastic Harmonica Corporation) {{was founded}} in 1944 in New Jersey by Danish {{immigrant}} Finn Magnus (1905-1976). First supplying American troops in World War II, and later marketed to children and other beginners, the company's harmonicas (as well as its accordions, bagpipes, and mechanical reed organs) used a then-unique molded-plastic reed comb. The styrene-based plastic construction resulted <b>in</b> <b>lower</b> <b>cost,</b> greater durability, and a distinct sound compared to other free reed aerophones with metal reeds.|$|E
50|$|Computer techniques, in {{particular}} {{digital signal processing}} (DSP), make possible a higher precision crossover. By using finite impulse response (FIR) and other digital techniques, the crossovers for a bi-amped or tri-amped system can be accomplished with a precision not possible with analog filters, whether passive or active. Furthermore, many driver peculiarities (down to and including individual variances) can be remedied {{at the same time}} such as in Klein and Hummel's recent designs. This approach is complex and thus not likely to be used <b>in</b> <b>lower</b> <b>cost</b> equipment.|$|E
50|$|The dam {{is owned}} and {{operated}} by Manitoba Hydro. It has ten generating units with a capacity of 1,330 megawatts and annual generation around 8.5 terawatt-hours. Although work at the site began in 1976 with a cofferdam completed in 1978, construction was suspended owing to a slowing of demand for electric power. The project resumed in 1985, with the first generating unit delivering power in 1990 and completion in 1992. Construction cost was $CDN 1.43 billion; favorable economic conditions at the time resulted <b>in</b> <b>lower</b> <b>cost</b> than budget.|$|E

50|$|As Chairman of ET&T, Sandell {{developed}} {{the concept of}} using low power terrestrial transmission technology by using S-Band transmission satellite transducers and large parabolic dishes at reception centers in cities spread throughout India. This proposal resulted <b>in</b> <b>lower</b> <b>cost</b> (about Rupees 25 lacs per system) compared to the alternative solution of using high power systems proposed by Doordarshan, the government’s official TV authority. This was operational across 20 cities within 9 months as against 2 years required by Doordarshan engineers. Sandell {{was also the first}} to drive the indigenous manufacturing of O.B. color TV vans for outdoor coverage of TV events. He also facilitated the training of local manufacturers of color TV sets and other peripherals such as antennae. As a result of these efforts, all these methods and designs for color TV manufacturing and transmission were standardized by the government of India.|$|E

50|$|Some of {{the product}} {{solutions}} that could be sold {{under the banner of}} Global Supply Chain Financing include, but are not limited to: 1.) Global asset-based lending (GABL) - Enables middle market companies to monetize off-shore or in-transit inventory. This results in increased liquidity to this class of borrower, 2.) Inventory finance - Enables companies that supply to large buyers to secure financing on inventory that they are required by buyers to hold. This results in an improvement in the net cash conversion cycle for the buyer while providing the supplier with capital at a reduced rate. 3.) Receivables management services - Provides third-party outsourcing of receivables management and collections process. It also provides financing of those receivables and guarantees on the payment of those receivables. 4.) Payables discounting -Provides third-party outsourcing of the payables process and leverages a buyer’s credit quality to obtain favorable financing rates for suppliers. This results <b>in</b> <b>lower</b> <b>cost</b> of capital for the supplier, a portion of which can be passed on to the buyer. 5) Insurance- Further mitigates trade risk through cargo, credit, and transaction dispute insurance.|$|E

40|$|The {{rising cost}} of health care has become the focus of a {{national}} conversation. Although costs associated with prevention, therapy, and surveillance in patients with cancer after completion of treat-ment are a relatively small fraction of the total cost of the entire US health care system, the increasing incidence of cancer in the pop-ulation and greater expense associated with new therapies pose a direct challenge. The impact of physicians ’ decisions is demon-strated by the substantial regional variations in health care costs that have been documented; {{there is good reason to}} believe that physicians <b>in</b> <b>lower</b> <b>cost</b> regions order and provide evidence-based tests and treatments just as often as their colleagues in higher cost regions, but they tend to avoid providing care whose usefulness is not well supported by existing data.
