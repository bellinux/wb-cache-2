As a liquid, {{it can be}} supplied in small insulated containers called dewars which hold as much as 1,000 liters of helium, or in large <b>ISO</b> <b>containers</b> which have nominal capacities as large as 42m3 (around 11,000 U.S. gallons). In gaseous form, small quantities of helium are supplied in high-pressure cylinders holding as much as 8m3 (approx. 282 standard cubic feet), while large quantities of high-pressure gas are supplied in tube trailers which have capacities {{of as much as}} 4,860m3 (approx. 172,000 standard cubic feet).|$|E

25|$|The {{widespread}} use of ISO standard containers has driven modifications in other freight-moving standards, gradually forcing removable truck bodies or swap bodies into standard sizes and shapes (though without the strength needed to be stacked), and changing completely the worldwide use of freight pallets that fit into <b>ISO</b> <b>containers</b> or into commercial vehicles.|$|E
25|$|Swap body units {{usually have}} the same bottom corner {{fixtures}} as intermodal containers, and often have folding legs under their frame {{so that they can}} be moved between trucks without using a crane. However they frequently don't have the upper corner fittings of <b>ISO</b> <b>containers,</b> and are not stackable, nor can they be lifted and handled by the usual equipment like reach-stackers or straddle-carriers. They are generally more expensive to procure.|$|E
25|$|In {{recent years}} the amount of freight moved by rail has {{increased}} substantially, and started to gain market share in non-bulk areas as well. Freight on the North Island Main Trunk line between Auckland and Palmerston North saw an increase of 39% in freight volumes between 2006 and 2007. The five daily trains on the 667km line reduced truck volumes on the route by around 120 per day. In 2008, the government proposed to spend $150m to enlarge tunnels for the bigger <b>ISO</b> <b>containers</b> now operating.|$|E

She has two abeam RAS rigs and a stern reel, and a 25-tonne deck crane. A side ramp allows easy access for vehicles and for the support of submarines and other small vessels. The flight deck can accommodate helicopters up to CH-53 Super Stallion size, and the hangar can operate one NH90 with level 2 maintenance or stow a second. The core crew will be 40-50, with accommodation for 100 more if needed; facilities include a gym and sauna. Four Sea PROTECTOR remote weapon stations are planned.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{extended}} usage of pallet-wide containers in Europe the EU started the Intermodal Loading Unit (ILU) initiative. This showed advantages for intermodal transport of containers and swap bodies. This {{led to the}} introduction of ILU-Codes defined by the standard EN 13044 which has the same format as the earlier BIC-Codes. The International Container Office BIC agreed to only issue ownership codes ending with U, J or Z. The new allocation office of the UIRR (International Union of Combined Road-Rail Transport Companies) agreed to only issue ownership reporting marks for swap bodies ending with A, B, C, D or K – companies having a BIC-Code ending with U can allocate an ILU-Code ending with K having the same preceding letters. Since July 2011 the new ILU codes can be registered, beginning with July 2014 all intermodal <b>ISO</b> <b>containers</b> and intermodal swap bodies must have an ownership code and by July 2019 all of them must bear a standard-conforming placard.|$|E

40|$|Large {{technical}} {{systems are}} difficult to change. This paper explores whether gateway technologies may enhance system flexibility. It analyses the gateway characteristics of the freight container in the system of cargo transportation between 1965 and 1995. A conceptual framework for standardised gateways is developed that focuses on compatibility within and between the political, operational and technical domains ('POT domains'). The International Standardisation Organization (<b>ISO)</b> Series 1 <b>container</b> standard caused a revolution in international intermodal transportation during the 1970 s. But the standard had a modal and a geographical bias. Competitive standardised gateways developed in parallel (e. g. pallet and swap body). Efforts to align the dimensional characteristics of these gateways failed. The <b>ISO</b> <b>container</b> had become- foremost politically- entrenched. The study concludes that both {{the impact of the}} <b>ISO</b> <b>container</b> and the development of competing modes of transportation indicate that standardised gateways can enhance system flexibility. 1...|$|R

2500|$|Containerization is {{a system}} of {{intermodal}} freight transport using intermodal containers (also called shipping containers and <b>ISO</b> <b>containers).</b> The containers have standardized dimensions.
