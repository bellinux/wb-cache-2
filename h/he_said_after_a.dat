We'd almost finished making the film, and this fun bit arrived that we'd not known about before, which was naming the film. So we were sitting around at Twickenham studios having a little brain-storming session ... and we said, 'Well, there was something Ringo said the other day.' Ringo would do these little malapropisms, he would say things slightly wrong, like people do, but his were always wonderful, very lyrical ... they were sort of magic even though he was just getting it wrong. And <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> concert, 'Phew, it's been a hard day's night.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Another {{story told}} of Dirac {{is that when}} he first met the young Richard Feynman at a conference, <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> long silence, [...] "I have an equation. Do you have one too?".|$|E
2500|$|Loyalty to the Resistance bloc MP Nawwaf Musawi {{said he was}} {{optimistic about}} Trump’s isolationist foreign policy. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> weekly meeting with Speaker Nabih Berri: [...] "The more the U.S. policy turn towards isolationism, the more {{relieved}} {{the world would be}} from its evil." ...|$|E
6000|$|The idea {{struck him}} as novel. [...] "Of course I'm manager for this expedition," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>after</b> <b>an</b> {{interval}} of self-examination.|$|R
6000|$|... "The matter can be {{arranged}} without <b>a</b> scandal," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>after</b> <b>an</b> instant. [...] "Can you tell me something of the circumstances?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But we'll keep on the shop," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>after</b> <b>an</b> {{interval}} {{for further}} reflection, [...] "all the same.... I 'aven't much trust in money after the things we've seen." ...|$|R
2500|$|On 16 September 1989, Yeltsin toured a {{medium-sized}} grocery store (Randall's) in Texas Leon Aron, quoting a Yeltsin associate, {{wrote in his}} 2000 biography, Yeltsin, A Revolutionary Life (St. Martin's Press): [...] "For a long time, on the plane to Miami, he sat motionless, {{his head in his}} hands. 'What have they done to our poor people?' <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> long silence."

2500|$|In a 1994 {{interview}} for The Beatles Anthology, however, McCartney disagreed with Lennon's recollections, basically stating {{that it was}} the Beatles, and not Lester, who had come {{up with the idea of}} using Starr's verbal misstep: [...] "The title was Ringo's.

6000|$|... 'Yes,' <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> moment's reflection. 'That's a fine {{idea in the}} abstract; but I {{doubt of}} its {{happiness}} in the long-run.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{do believe}} I'm growing young again, {{for the old}} dulness is quite gone, and all this work and play {{does not seem to}} tire me <b>a</b> bit," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>after</b> <b>an</b> unusually lively evening with the congenial guests Portia took care to bring about him.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{did not do}} well, O King of the Rain, last night," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>after</b> <b>an</b> {{interchange}} of civilities, as becomes great gods. [...] "You {{have put}} out even the sacred flame on the holy hearth of the King of Fire. You have a bad heart. Why do you use us so?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Even the solidly-founded self-possession of Bishopriggs {{himself was}} {{shaken by the}} startling {{directness}} of that attack on it. His glib tongue was paralyzed for the moment. [...] "I dinna ken what ye're drivin' at," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>after</b> <b>an</b> interval, with a sullen consciousness {{that he had been}} all but tricked into betraying himself.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{are slow}} in conversation, widow,' <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> time, pausing in his draught. 'We {{shall have to}} talk before your son.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I knew not," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> pause, [...] "that {{there was}} an Israelite who still adhered to the {{religion}} of their ancestors." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "No, I cannot," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>after</b> <b>an</b> almost {{imperceptible}} moment of hesitancy; [...] "but {{we shall see}} him to-morrow. I {{have no doubt that}} Mademoiselle Lange will know where to find him; and now that we know where she is, all our anxiety about him, at any rate, should soon be at an end." ...|$|R
6000|$|He joined them, and {{she made}} {{a desperate attempt to}} {{entangle}} Mr. Wintersloan in a three-cornered talk in vain. He turned away at the first possible opportunity, and left her to an embarrassed and eloquently silent tête-à-tête. Mr. Magnet's professional wit had deserted him. [...] "It's nice to see you again," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>after</b> <b>an</b> immense interval. [...] "Shall we go and look at the aviary?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{will come}} to me again, Hodder? some other day," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>after</b> <b>an</b> interval, [...] "that we may talk over the new problems. They are constructive, creative, and I am anxious to hear how you propose to meet them. For one thing, {{to find a new}} basis for the support of such a parish. I {{understand}} they have deprived you of your salary." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{thought so}}," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> cursory examination. [...] "I thought {{so at the}} time. Did you hear that sort of {{crunching}} snap?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was very}} intolerant, wasn't I?" [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> pause. [...] "You thought so--you were right. You have been happier since you--left me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "However," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> moment's consideration, [...] "why don't {{you take}} a holiday? Some of the other ladies might look after her a while." ...|$|E
6000|$|Darius {{was not of}} {{the same}} opinion, as was shown when <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>after</b> waiting <b>a</b> moment to learn if any other had an opinion to express: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{are going}} to have our own {{troubles}} finding our camp," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>after</b> about <b>a</b> quarter of the distance across Lake Narsac had been covered.|$|R
6000|$|... "This is {{just the}} weather for a {{pleasant}} cruise," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> amiably, <b>after</b> <b>a</b> few whiffs. [...] "You’ve chose a nice time for it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{could not}} be {{expected}} to give her up," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> moment's hesitation: it was not a case for any pretence of generosity.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Well, to {{tell the}} truth, I was {{watching}} Mr. Man,' <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> while, {{and that made me}} more surprised than ever, so I asked: ...|$|E
6000|$|Lord Cadurcis smiled. 'I wish,' <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> little hesitation, 'if {{only for}} [...] "Auld lang syne," [...] I might include Lady Annabel Herbert among them.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Rowland {{listened to}} all this {{with a sort of}} feeling that fortune had played him an elaborately-devised trick. It had lured him out into mid-ocean and {{smoothed}} the sea and stilled the winds and given him a singularly sympathetic comrade, and then it had turned and delivered him a thumping blow in mid-chest. [...] "Yes," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>after</b> <b>an</b> attempt at the usual formal congratulation, [...] "you certainly ought to do better--with Miss Garland waiting for you at Northampton." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And I'm a {{baby who}} can't," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> angrily. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> pause <b>he</b> burst out abruptly: [...] "Miss Trotter, will you answer me one question?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{would not}} have {{occurred}} to me if I had not seen something like it done elsewhere--at Middleton lately," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> thoughtfully, <b>after</b> <b>a</b> while.|$|R
6000|$|Tredgold looked again. [...] "I fancy it’s a {{bit higher}} towards the middle," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> {{prolonged}} inspection; [...] "and, besides, it’s ’mount,’ not ’mountain.’" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'They've {{found the}} second will,' <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> moment, with a rather husky voice, 'and they're {{taking steps to}} get it confirmed, {{whatever}} that may be.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{what may}} that need be?" [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> moment's pause. In his heart he was tempted by the hinted {{opportunity}} of applying his invention.|$|E
6000|$|... "What--what did {{she come}} here for? Do {{you mean to}} tell me she thinks I took the money?" [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> huskily, <b>after</b> <b>a</b> long pause.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I'll {{tell you}} what,' <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>after</b> {{thinking}} <b>a</b> little. 'Don't throw the club at all. I will throw {{it a second}} time, and that will do just as well.' ...|$|R
6000|$|The Vicar returned, after {{accompanying}} Gotch out, {{and for a}} {{long time}} he remained sitting before the desk in his study, plunged in thought. [...] "A week!" [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>after</b> <b>an</b> immense silence. [...] "Here is an Angel, a glorious Angel, who has quickened my soul to beauty and delight, who has opened my eyes to Wonderland, and something more than Wonderland, ... and I have promised to get rid of him in a week! What are we men made of?... How can I tell him?" ...|$|R
