The {{rate at which}} clothing microclimate air is exchanged for ambient air influences the sensible and <b>insensible</b> <b>heat</b> <b>loss</b> from the microclimate. Factors which influence this air exchange are clothing permeability, wind speed, body movements, clothing design, and fabric properties. The influence of the first four factors has been studied using a trace gas technique for measuring {{the rate at which}} microclimate air is exchanged for ambient air. The trace gas technique and the mathematical model describing the loss of the trace gas from the microclimate are described. The technique is shown to have a high resolving power, enabling small changes in the four factors studied to be identified, and as the method is also very quick detailed studies of garment design can be made...|$|E
40|$|A {{model to}} predict {{voluntary}} water intake (WI) of a pig fed a known diet in a known environment is described. The daily retentions of protein, lipid, water and ash were estimated over time using a published pig growth model. Food intakes were estimated using published methods. WI was {{estimated by adding}} the amounts required for digestion (WD), faecal excretion (W(fec)), growth (WG), evaporation (WE), urinary excretion (WU) and by then subtracting the water arising from feed (WF), from nutrient oxidation (WO) and synthesis of body constituents (WS). WD was predicted assuming an absorption of water of 0. 10, 0. 16 and 0. 07 kg/kg digestible carbohydrate, crude protein and lipid respectively. W(fec) was estimated {{taking into account the}} water associated with the undigested protein (0. 86 kg/kg), diethyl ether extract (- 12. 11 kg/kg), crude fibre (1. 86 kg/kg), ash (- 0. 42 kg/kg) and N-free extract (4. 4 kg/kg). The basal level of WE was estimated from the heat production of the pig fed ad libitum (MJ/d) as: 0. 25 x (metabolizable energy - energy retained as protein and lipid) x 0. 4, where 0. 25 is the assumed proportion of the <b>insensible</b> <b>heat</b> <b>loss</b> at the comfort temperature and 0. 4 is the water lost per MJ dissipated heat. WE in a hot environment was predicted by assuming that evaporation increased up to three times the basal level to offset the decreased sensible heat loss. To predict WU a water requirement for renal excretion of 2. 05 and 3. 40 kg/osmol excreted N as urea and minerals respectively was assumed. The urinary load of N and minerals was predicted from the intake of digestible nutrients and their retention. From the oxidation of 1 kg carbohydrate, protein, and fat it was assumed that 0. 6, 0. 42 and 1. 07 kg water (WO) were released respectively. WS was predicted by assuming a release of 0. 16, 0. 07 and 0. 57 kg water per kg retained protein, retained lipid coming from digestible lipid, and retained lipid coming from digestible carbohydrate respectively. The model is strongly rooted in a theoretical structure. When its predictions were compared with data from suitable experiments, the results were not significantly different. Both the pattern and the magnitude of responses of the model to changes in body weight, feed intake and environmental temperature are sensible and it allows a fuller prediction of voluntary water intake than the methods currently availabl...|$|E

A brief review of the results for a flame without volumetric <b>heat</b> <b>loss</b> is presented. The results are compared to those obtained recently for a flame suffering combined upstream/ downstream volumetric <b>heat</b> <b>loss.</b> For the structure, the analysis predicts that the expressions for the burning rate and the specific <b>heat</b> <b>loss</b> rate to the burner are not identical, unlike that shown for the freely propagating flame with volumetric <b>heat</b> <b>loss.</b> This is in agreement with earlier investigations of a flame suffering the three separate <b>heat</b> <b>loss</b> modes studied using thin-flame theory. Also in agreement with these earlier studies, the analysis predicts that the downstream <b>heat</b> <b>loss</b> mode is larger in magnitude than the upstream <b>heat</b> <b>loss</b> mode. For the diffusional-thermal instability, the analysis demonstrates that for the linear stability model considered, the effects of upstream and downstream <b>heat</b> <b>loss</b> appear in additive form.

30|$|Dealing {{with the}} <b>heat</b> <b>losses</b> {{associated}} with steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) experiments {{has been an}} issue for which different <b>heat</b> <b>loss</b> prevention techniques have been developed and utilized in the literature. The aim is to minimize the amount of <b>heat</b> <b>losses</b> from the porous medium to the surrounding environment. Excessive <b>heat</b> <b>losses</b> negatively affect quantifying the energy requirements of the SAGD experiments. In this study, an inverted-bell vacuum chamber was employed to minimize the excessive <b>heat</b> <b>losses</b> while steam was injected under different superheating levels. Local temperatures along the glass micromodels’ height and width were recorded on a real time basis. Details of the <b>heat</b> <b>losses</b> associated with our pore-scale SAGD visualization experiments are described in this paper.

Minimizing <b>heat</b> <b>loss</b> in cavity receivers {{is seen as an}} effective way to enhance the thermal performance and the use of plate fins has been proposed as a low cost means to minimize <b>heat</b> <b>loss.</b> Firstly, the influence of operating temperature, emissivity of the surface, orientation and the geometric parameters on the total <b>heat</b> <b>loss</b> from the receiver was investigated. It was observed that convective <b>heat</b> <b>loss</b> is largely affected by the angle of inclination of the receiver, the presence of fins and the number of fins in the receiver. As for the radiation <b>heat</b> <b>loss</b> it was observed that it is mainly influenced by the properties of the cavity receiver surface. The radiation <b>heat</b> <b>loss</b> was found to be constant at all the angles of the receiver. Significant reduction in natural convection <b>heat</b> <b>loss</b> from the cavity receiver was accomplished by using the plate fins whereas radiation <b>heat</b> <b>loss</b> was marginally reduced by about 5 %. Secondly, the optimization was conducted to obtain the optimal fin geometry and lastly, the overall thermal efficiency of the receiver was presented at different operating temperatures.

The numerical analysis is carried out by using CFD software and the results are compared with the experimental results and found good agreement. The result shows that the convective loss increases with decrease in cavity inclination angle and decreases with decrease in mean cavity receiver temperature. The maximum losses are obtained at 0 ° inclination angle and the minimum losses are obtained at 90 ° inclination angle of cavity due to increase in stagnation zone in to the cavity from 0 ° to 90 ° inclination. The Nusselt number correlation is developed for the low temperature range 55 - 75 °C based on the experimental data. The analysis is also carried out to study the effect of wind speed and wind direction on convective <b>heat</b> <b>losses.</b> The convective <b>heat</b> <b>losses</b> are studied for two wind speeds (3 m/s and 5 m/s) and four wind directions [α is 0 ° (Side-on wind), 30 °, 60 °, and 90 ° (head-on wind) ]. It is found that the convective <b>heat</b> <b>losses</b> for both wind speed are higher than the losses obtained by no wind test. The highest <b>heat</b> <b>losses</b> are found for wind direction α is 60 ° with respect to receiver stand and lowest <b>heat</b> <b>losses</b> are found for wind direction α is 0 ° (side-on wind). The <b>heat</b> <b>losses</b> obtained for wind direction, α, is 30 ° condition are higher than the <b>heat</b> <b>losses</b> obtained for wind direction α is 0 ° (side-on wind) condition, while the <b>heat</b> <b>losses</b> obtained by wind direction α is 90 ° (head-on wind) condition are less than the <b>heat</b> <b>losses</b> obtained for wind direction, α, is 60 ° condition...|$|R

40|$|The present paper {{argues that}} the {{prediction}} of turbulent premixed flames under non-adiabatic conditions can be improved by considering the combined effects of strain and <b>heat</b> <b>loss</b> on reaction rates. The effect of strain {{in the presence of}} <b>heat</b> <b>loss</b> on the consumption speed of laminar premixed flames was quantified by calculations of asymmetric counterflow configurations (“fresh-to-burnt”) with detailed chemistry. <b>Heat</b> <b>losses</b> were introduced by setting the temperature of the incoming stream of products on the “burnt” side to values below those corresponding to adiabatic conditions. The consumption speed decreased in a roughly exponential manner with increasing strain rate, and this tendency became more pronounced in the presence of <b>heat</b> <b>losses.</b> An empirical relation in terms of Markstein number, Karlovitz Number and a non-dimensional <b>heat</b> <b>loss</b> parameter was proposed for the combined influence of strain and <b>heat</b> <b>losses</b> on the consumption speed. Combining this empirical relation with a presumed probability density function for strain in turbulent flows, an attenuation factor that accounts for the effect of strain and <b>heat</b> <b>loss</b> on the reaction rate in turbulent flows was deduced and implemented into a turbulent combustion model. URANS simulations of a premixed swirl burner were carried out and validated against flow field and OH chemiluminescence measurements. Introducing the effects of strain and <b>heat</b> <b>loss</b> into the combustion model, the flame topology observed experimentally was correctly reproduced, with good agreement between experiment and simulation for flow field and flame length...|$|R
