Project Treble separates the vendor implementation (device-specific, lower-level software written by silicon manufacturers) from the Android OS framework via a new [...] "vendor interface". In Android 7.0 and earlier, no formal vendor interface exists, so device makers must update large portions of the Android code to move a device to a newer version of the operating system. With Treble, the new stable vendor interface provides access to the hardware-specific parts of Android, <b>enabling</b> <b>device</b> makers to deliver new Android releases simply by updating the Android OS framework, [...] "without any additional work required from the silicon manufacturers." ...|$|E

Abstract: We have developed a SOI/SOI wafer bonding process {{to design and fabricate}} two-axis scanning mirrors with excellent performance.

Pressure dependent structural measurements on monodispersed nanoscale SrTiO 3 samples with average diameters of 10 to ~ 80 nm were conducted.

40|$|The {{growth of}} self-assembled, {{vertically}} oriented and uniform nanowires (NWs) {{has remained a}} challenge for efficient light-emitting devices. Here, we demonstrate dislocation-free AlGaN NWs with spontaneous coalescence, which are grown by plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy on an n-type doped silicon (100) substrate. A high density of NWs (filling factor > 95 %) was achieved under optimized growth conditions, <b>enabling</b> <b>device</b> fabrication without planarization using ultraviolet (UV) -absorbing polymer materials. UV-B (280 - 320 nm) light-emitting diodes (LEDs), which emit at ~ 303 nm with a narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) (~ 20 nm) of the emission spectrum, are demonstrated using a large active region (“active region/NW length-ratio” ~ 50 %) embedded with 15 stacks of AlxGa 1 -xN/AlyGa 1 -yN quantum-disks (Qdisks). To improve the carrier injection, a graded layer is introduced at the AlGaN/GaN interfaces on both p- and n-type regions.

40|$|The {{last decade}} of {{empirical}} research on the added value of human resource management (HRM), {{also known as the}} HRM and Performance debate, demonstrates evidence that ‘HRM does matter’ (Huselid, 1995; Guest, Michie, Conway and Sheehan, 2003; Wright, Gardner and Moynihan, 2003). Unfortunately, the relationships are often (statistically) weak and the results ambiguous. This paper reviews and attempts to extend the theoretical and methodological issues in the HRM and performance debate. Our aim is to build an agenda for future research in this area. After a brief overview of achievements to date, we proceed with the theoretical and methodological issues related to what constitutes HRM, what is meant by the concept of performance and {{what is the nature of}} the link between these two. In the final section, we make a plea for research designs starting from a multidimensional concept of performance, including the perceptions of employees, and building on the premise of HRM systems as an <b>enabling</b> <b>device</b> for a whole range of strategic options. This implies a reversal of the Strategy-HRM linkage...|$|E

40|$|The {{tightly bound}} biexcitons found in atomically thin {{semiconductors}} have very promising applications for optoelectronic and quantum devices. However, {{there is a}} discrepancy between theory and experiment regarding the fundamental structure of these biexcitons. Therefore, the exploration of a biexciton formation mechanism by further experiments is of great importance. Here, we successfully triggered the emission of biexcitons in atomically thin MoSe 2, via the engineering of three critical parameters: dielectric screening, density of trions, and excitation power. The observed binding energy and formation dynamics of these biexcitons strongly support the model that the biexciton consists of a charge attached to a trion (excited state biexciton) instead of four spatially symmetric particles (ground state biexciton). More importantly, {{we found that the}} excited state biexcitons not only can exist at cryogenic temperatures but also can be triggered at room temperature in a freestanding bilayer MoSe 2. The demonstrated capability of biexciton engineering in atomically thin MoSe 2 provides a route for exploring fundamental many-body interactions and <b>enabling</b> <b>device</b> applications, such as bright entangled photon sources operating at room temperature...|$|E
