In the strong-coupling M-theory dual of the heterotic string this poses a paradox: Since the E 8 _ 1 and E 8 _ 2 live {{at opposite ends}} of the x^ 10 dimension, where could a massless particle with both types of charges possible live? To <b>key</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>question</b> are the 5 D SCFTs living at the orbifold fixed planes going through the bulk of the M theory. We use dimensional deconstruction to understand how such a 5 D SCFT (specifically, the E_ 0 SCFT at the Z_ 3 fixed point) works at the superconformal point (rather that at the Coulomb branch) and how it interacts with the boundaries of the x^ 10. We find that the massless twisted states are not localized in the x^ 10. Instead, they are non-local meson-like composite particles comprised of a quark living at one boundary of the x^ 10, and antiquark living at the other boundary, and the string of strongly-interacting 5 D gluons connecting the quark to the antiquark.

As a result, large, poor and marginalized fractions of urban populations joined their civic society and formal economies, and gradually raised their socioeconomic status and that of their communities.

40|$|How do we {{quantify}} patterns (such as {{responses to}} local selection) sampled across multiple populations {{within a single}} species? <b>Key</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>question</b> {{is the extent to}} which populations within species represent statistically independent data points in our analysis. Comparative analyses across species and higher taxa have long recognized the need to control for the non-independence of species data that arises through patterns of shared common ancestry among them (phylogenetic non-independence), as have quantitative genetic studies of individuals linked by a pedigree. Analyses across populations lacking pedigree information fall in the middle, and not only have to deal with shared common ancestry, but also the impact of exchange of migrants between populations (gene flow). As a result, phenotypes measured in one population are influenced by processes acting on others, and may not be a good guide to either the strength or direction of local selection. Although many studies examine patterns across populations within species, few consider such non-independence. Here, we discuss the sources of non-independence in comparative analysis, and show why the phylogeny-based approaches widely used in cross-species analyses are unlikely to be useful in analyses across populations within species. We outline the approaches (intraspecific contrasts, generalized least squares, generalized linear mixed models and autoregression) that have been used in this context, and explain their specific assumptions. We highlight the power of ‘mixed models’ in many contexts where problems of non-independence arise, and show that these allow incorporation of both shared common ancestry and gene flow. We suggest what can be done when ideal solutions are inaccessible, highlight the need for incorporation of a wider range of population models in intraspecific comparative methods and call for simulation studies of the error rates associated with alternative approaches...|$|E

50|$|The <b>key</b> <b>to</b> {{answering}} <b>this</b> <b>question</b> lies {{in going}} back to Quine and his attack on logical positivism.The logical positivists, who dominated the philosophical scene for almost the entire {{first half of the}} twentieth century, maintained that genuine knowledge consisted in all and only such knowledge as was capable of manifesting a strict relationship with empirical experience. Therefore, they believed, the only linguistic expressions (manifestations of knowledge) that had meaning were those that either directly referred to observable entities, or that could be reduced to a vocabulary that directly referred to such entities. A sentence S contained knowledge only if it possessed a meaning, and it possessed a meaning only if it was possible to refer to a set of experiences that could, at least potentially, verify it and to another set that could potentially falsify it.

40|$|In this paper, I examine Adorno’s {{controversial}} {{claim that}} human rationality is inherently mimetic. To do so, I break this claim down into three puzzles (the natural historical puzzle, the metaphysical puzzle, and the epistemic puzzle) and consider each in turn. The first puzzle originates in Adorno’s assertion {{that in the}} course of human history the mimetic moment of human thought “is melted together with the rational moment”. So whereas, on his narrative, mimesis has become an intrinsic component of human rationality, it appears that we are oblivious to this state of affair and unable to recognize the workings of mimesis in what we otherwise refer to as rationality. The second puzzle concerns the traditional metaphysical question regarding the possibility of knowledge. Adorno holds that the <b>key</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>question</b> lies in the “mimetic moment of knowledge”, which he characterizes as the “moment of the elective affinity between the knower and the known. ” The third puzzle concerns his views on how the mimetic moment of thought plays out in our epistemic practices. As he puts it, “consciousness knows of its other as much as it resembles that other,” which seems to entail that our very efforts to conceptualize objects somehow rely on imitative processes. I work out what I take to be the basics of Adorno’s understanding of mimesis and use them to make sense of each puzzle. I argue that Adorno’s insistence on the mimetic component of human rationality isn’t meant to promote more mimetic modes of comportment, but a reflexive awareness {{of the extent to which}} our rational activities already rely on imitative (or immersive) processes, even those we view as embodying the strongest claims to the contrary...|$|E
40|$|The {{canonical}} {{model in}} economics considers {{people to be}} rational and selfregarding. However, much evidence challenges this view, raising the question of when "Economic Man " dominates the outcome of social interactions, and when bounded rationality or other-regarding preferences dominate. Here we show that strategic incentives are the <b>key</b> <b>to</b> answering <b>this</b> <b>question.</b> A minority of selfregarding individuals can trigger a "noncooperative " aggregate outcome if their behavior generates incentives {{for the majority of}} other-regarding individuals to mimic the minority's behavior. Likewise, a minority of other-regarding individuals can generate a "cooperative " aggregate outcome if their behavior generates incentives for a majority of self-regarding people to behave cooperatively. Similarly, in strategic games, aggregate outcomes can be either far from or close to Nash equilibrium if players with high degrees of strategic thinking mimic or erase the effects of others who do very little strategic thinking. Recently developed theories of other-regarding preferences and bounded rationality explain these findings and provide better predictions of actual aggregate behavior than does traditional economic theory...|$|R
40|$|Multiple {{sequence}} alignment (MSA) {{has been}} one of the most important problems in bioinformatics for more decades and it is still heavily examined by many mathematicians and biologists. However, mostly because of the practical motivation of this problem, the research on this topic is focused on aligning long sequences. It is understandable, since the sequences that need to be aligned (usually DNA or protein sequences) are generally quite long (e. g., at least 30 - 40 characters). Nevertheless, it is a challenging question that exactly where MSA starts to become a real hard problem (since it is known that MSA is NP-complete [2]), and the <b>key</b> <b>to</b> answer <b>this</b> <b>question</b> is <b>to</b> examine short sequences.

The <b>key</b> <b>to</b> answer <b>this</b> <b>question</b> is <b>to</b> identify if there is deep-seated subsidence in this area.

Four of the GPS antennas are mounted on the deep-anchored inner pipes of borehole extensometers. We conclude that recent subsidence (1993 – 2012) in the Houston-Galveston area was dominated by the compaction of sediments within 600 [*]m below the land surface. Depending on the location of specific sites, the compaction occurred within the Chicot aquifer and part or all of the Evangeline aquifer.

This lower bound depends on the problem only in the dimension of the expectation being estimated, and not on the underlying stochastic process. This result is obtained by drawing a connection between terminating simulation via effective sample size and terminating simulation using a relative standard deviation fixed-volume sequential stopping rule; which we demonstrate is an asymptotically valid procedure.

Drawing on research in Northern Uganda, this article suggests that the <b>key</b> <b>to</b> addressing <b>this</b> <b>question</b> is in recognition of churches’ unique historical, social and religious embeddedness in local societies. From {{the point of view}} of donor organisations, this embeddedness is paradoxical: the same things that enable churches to ‘deliver development’ in an unusually effective and meaningful way, make churches appear as challenging grassroots partners for development. This is because the spiritual, historical and political embeddedness of churches makes the effects of their activities greater than of organisations lacking such embeddedness – whether those effects be ‘positive’ or ‘negative’. The notion of embeddedness draws attention to the need for donors to cease to think of churches in negative terms, as foreign impositions. The history of missionary churches is inseparably embroiled in the history of colonisation. However, the religious faiths and practices initially brought by missionaries to many parts of Africa are now an integral part of the life of many local adherents.

Turbott Wolfe at one level represents Plomer's complex responses to and interpretation of the South African milieu during the early 1920 s. During this decade, the foundations of modem Apartheid were being consolidated, and African Nationalism emerged as a powerful challenge to the South African state. Turbott Wolfe is informed by these political developments, and the milieu and events portrayed in the novel vividly express the author's feelings about and attitudes towards the society he finds himself in. Since its publication, ZiZ&stsJBal&a has suffered considerable critical neglect The superficiality {{of much of the}} existing criticism about the novel must be challenged, since Turbott Wolfe is not only of tremendous intrinsic literary merit, but also provides valuable insights into the socio-political environment and historical moment in which Plotter wrote.

The <b>key</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> crucial <b>question,</b> however, lies in a detailed exploration of the author's personal history.

Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) {{is a sampling}} method used to estimate expectations {{with respect to a}} target distribution. An important question is when should sampling stop so that we have good estimates of these expectations? The <b>key</b> <b>to</b> answering <b>this</b> <b>question</b> lies in assessing the Monte Carlo error through a multivariate Markov chain central limit theorem (CLT). The multivariate nature of this Monte Carlo error largely has been ignored in the MCMC literature. This dissertation discusses the drawbacks of the current univariate methods of terminating simulation and introduces a multivariate framework for terminating simulation. Theoretical properties of the procedures are established. A multivariate effective sample size is defined and estimated using strongly consistent estimators of the covariance matrix in the Markov chain CLT, a property that is shown for the multivariate batch means estimator and the multivariate spectral variance estimator. A critical aspect of this procedure is that a lower bound on the number of effective samples required for a pre-specified level of precision can be determined a priori. This lower bound depends on the problem only in the dimension of the expectation being estimated, and not on the underlying stochastic process. This result is obtained by drawing a connection between terminating the simulation via effective sample size and terminating it using a relative standard deviation fixed-volume sequential stopping rule. The finite sample properties of the proposed methods are demonstrated in a variety of examples. The proposed method requires the existence of a Markov chain CLT, establishing which requires bounding the rate of convergence of the Markov chains. We establish a geometric rate of convergence for a class of Bayesian penalized regression models. We also present examples showing how it may be easier to establish rates of convergence for linchpin variable samplers than for its competitors...|$|R

An outstanding question {{of importance to}} many fields within geology is how and why did the Tibetan plateau form? Models attribute {{the growth of the}} plateau to a consequence of the ongoing India-Asia continental collision, but differ in the details of how the crustal thickening was accommodated: was it by underplating of Indian lower crust or by homogeneous shortening? High-grade metamorphic rocks sampled from the region potentially hold the <b>key</b> <b>to</b> answering <b>this</b> <b>question,</b> as they contain a record of past tectonic events that can discriminate between the various proposed models. This record can be decoded by integrating field, thermobarometric and geochronological techniques, to elucidate a detailed thermotectonic understanding of a region. This methodology was applied to three case studies, each of which targeted rare tectonic windows into the mid-crust of the plateau. These regions comprise Danba in eastern Tibet, Basong Tso in south-eastern Tibet and the Western Nyainqentanglha in southern Tibet. Each case study documents previously unreported metamorphic events that have allowed original interpretations to be made regarding tectonic evolution: in Danba, all metamorphism is shown to be early Jurassic; in Basong Tso, two metamorphic belts are documented that reveal a late Triassic [...] early Jurassic orogenic event; and in the Western Nyainqengtanglha, Cretaceous [...] Neogene magmatism is shown to overprint late Triassic metamorphism. Integration of the results has enabled commentary on the large scale evolution of the Tibetan plateau from the Permian until the present day, and even hinted at its future. The results indicate that the closure of the Paleotethys {{played an important role in}} the construction of the Tibetan plateau, and suggest that homogeneous crustal thickening is not a viable model for the documented exposure levels.

These studies revealed that ultraviolet radiation is the near-term lethal agent, while hard radiation is the long-term lethal agent when the organism is shielded from ultraviolet radiation. In fact, bacterial spores, halophilic cyanobacteria and Archaea as well as some lichens survive very well if protected from ultraviolet radiation [1]. Some microbes, then, may be able to survive the trip in outer space to Mars on a spacecraft or in a meteorite. Once on Mars can a terrestrial microbe survive? Although the conditions on Mars are not as harsh as those in space, they are not hospitable for a terrestrial microbe. Studies, however, have shown that certain microbes that can survive in space for several years may also be able to survive on Mars if protected from ultraviolet radiation [1]. Laboratory simulation experiments using a mock-up of the Phoenix lander have shown that microbes transported to the surface of Mars on a spacecraft come off the spacecraft and mix into the Martian regolith [2]. Additionally, studies simulating Martian dust storms demonstrate that microbes can survive in the Martian wind blown dust and be scattered across the Martian surface away from the spacecraft. Would these microbes that may survive on Mars metabolize and propagate? Growth requires liquid water, a carbon source and an energy source. Survival on Mars also requires protection from ultraviolet radiation. In the cold, dry environment of Mars the probability of microbial metabolism and growth at or just beneath the surface is extremely low. Although the probability is low, Mars may be contaminated with potentially live terrestrial organisms. In light of that statistic we must be extremely diligent and cautious in our search for Martian life. If we are not cautious we may find life on Mars and it may be a contaminant from Earth...|$|R
