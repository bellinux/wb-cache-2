40|$|In this {{retrospective}} survey we investigated {{the recall of}} breast cancer patients (n= 105) 6 months after the operation concerning postoperative instructions on exercises for shoulder mobility, and instructions <b>for</b> <b>oedema</b> <b>prevention</b> and treatment, upper limb strength training {{and the use of}} the upper limb in daily activities. Patients also described the content in their own words and ranked the instructors who had mostly given this education. Operation type and length of hospital stay did not have any effect on the education recalled, but the age of the respondent had some effect (r=− 0. 23, p< 0. 05). The Wilcoxon signed ranks test showed that the most commonly reported item was instructions on shoulder movements (P< 0. 001). Patients reported that they had more instructions for using the upper limb in daily activities than instructions for strength training (P= 0. 002) and <b>oedema</b> <b>prevention</b> and treatment (P= 0. 001). Patients own comments were sometimes conflicting: “Use the upper limb as before and you can even lift weights” and “You cannot drive a car or lift a weight over 3 kg for 6 weeks”. Over half of the respondents named the physiotherapist or physiotherapy assistant as the person who had given them most of the instructions. A medical doctor was ranked in first place by 19 % of the patients. Only half of the patients reported that they had some education after hospitalization. This study suggests that postoperative education of breast cancer patients is inconsistent and insufficient to provide knowledge for independent rehabilitation for future...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{investigate}} {{the efficacy of}} A-V impulse technology (A-V) <b>for</b> <b>oedema</b> <b>prevention</b> and treatment following PTFE femoropopliteal surgery. DesignProspective randomized clinical trial. Materials 36 patients undergoing PTFE femoropopliteal bypass reconstructions, either being treated postoperatively with a compression stocking (CS) (Group- 1, n =  19) or with A-V (Group- 2, n =  17). MethodsPatients in treatment group- 1 used a CS postoperatively during 1 week day and night, patients in group- 2 were treated with A-V postoperatively at night during one week. The lower leg circumference was measured preoperatively and at five postoperative time points. ResultsLimb circumference has increased postoperatively on day 1 (CS 1. 5 %/A-V 1. 4 %), on day 4 (5. 7 %/ 6. 3 %), on day 7 (6. 6 %/ 6. 1 %), on day 14 (7. 9 %/ 7. 7 %) and on day 90 (5. 8 %/ 5. 2 %). Differences between treatment groups were not significant. A re-operation gives a significant 3. 9 % increase in circumference as compared to a first operation (95 % CI: 1. 5 – 6. 4 %; p =  0. 002). ConclusionNo {{significant differences were found}} in the extent of developed edema between the groups following PTFE femoropopliteal bypass surgery.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Electrical bioimpedance {{spectroscopy}} (BIS) {{allows the}} evaluation of limb extracellular fluid (R 0) and total fluid (Rinf). BIS could facilitate post-surgical oedema evaluation after total knee arthroplasty (TKA), as it is easily performed and is non-invasive. However, neither its applicability in this context nor the influence of metallic implants on measurement has been evaluated. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the influence of TKA implants on the BIS R 0 and Rinf variables used <b>for</b> <b>oedema</b> evaluation. METHOD: This was a prospective non-randomized comparative clinical trial. One oedema-free group of patients with TKA was compared with a group presenting similar characteristics except for the arthroplasty, to assess the influence of the implant on BIS measurement in the absence of oedema. The TKA group included 15 patients who had undergone surgery more than a year previously, and the control group included 19 patients awaiting TKA surgery. Volume and perimeter measurements served as reference criterions. The lower limb percentage differences for BIS, knee perimeter and volume were calculated. The significance of differences between groups was calculated for all measurement methods, using the Mann-Whitney test. The setting was a Department of Orthopedic Surgery and Traumatology in a university hospital. RESULTS: The differences between groups were not significant for R 0, Rinf, volume and perimeter. R 0 showed the smallest mean difference in limb percentage difference between groups [means (SD) : TKA 3. 98 (8. 09), controls 3. 97 (5. 16) ]. CONCLUSIONS: The lower-leg percentage difference in the TKA group is comparable with that of healthy subjects. R 0 can be used <b>for</b> <b>oedema</b> evaluation following TKA surgery, as there was no sign of alteration from the metallic implant. These findings indicate the potential <b>for</b> early <b>oedema</b> evaluation after TKA. More research is warranted to extensively validate the application of BIS <b>for</b> <b>oedema</b> evaluation after TKA. Copyright Â© 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R

40|$|A {{total of}} 148 {{patients}} presenting within 48 hours of subarachnoid haemorrhage were assigned at random to receive standard management only or standard management and treatment with the adrenergic-blocking agents propranolol and phentolamine (or propranolol alone) for three weeks. One hundred and thirty-four patients completed the study. Assessment at four weeks showed a strong trend for less neurological {{deficit in the}} treated group, almost statistically significant (p= 0. 053) in the women. During the first month the treated group suffered fewer episodes of clinical deterioration consistent with cerebral arterial spasm: thus more treated patients underwent operation {{and those who did}} had a better outcome (p= 0. 030). At one year fewer were dead or disabled (unable to work) in the treated group; a significant difference for women (p= 0. 030). Possible mechanisms for these actions may include a reduction in pulmonary <b>oedema,</b> <b>prevention</b> of myocardial infarcts, a reduction in plasma renin activity, nd a reduction in cerebral oxygen requirements. It is concluded that early adrenergic blockade benefits patients (particularly women) with subarachnoid haemorrhage for up to one year in terms of lesser neurological deficit. Beta-blocker rather than alpha-blockade appears to be the useful component. A randomised, blind extension of the present study using long-acting propranolol and placebo has shown a significant (p= 0. 026) decrease in deaths and significantly (p= 0. 003) fewer poor results in the treatment group...|$|R

Following IAI, radiographic exam was performed in all joints for further analysis by two blinded radiologists. the -statistic, chi-square and analysis of variance tests were performed to determine potential differences between time-points of evaluation. Significance level was set as P 0. 05. Results. A total of 232 injections were performed. Accuracy observed for the shoulder, elbow, wrist, MCP joints, knee and ankle were 82, 100, 97, 97, 100 and 77, respectively. A statistically significant improvement was observed for all variables at both T(1) and T(4) when compared with T(0). Conclusions.

Design A cohort study based on pharmacy records of women giving birth to a child between 1994 and 2003. Setting The study was performed with data from the InterAction database, containing prescription-drug-dispensing data from community pharmacies. Population The study population included 5412 women for whom complete pharmacy records were available. Methods Drugs were classified into three categories: (1) <b>drugs</b> <b>for</b> chronic conditions, (2) <b>drugs</b> <b>for</b> occasional use and (3) <b>drugs</b> <b>for</b> pregnancy-related symptoms and also classified according to the Australian classification system. Main outcome measures The prescription rate was calculated {{as the number of}} women per 100 women who received one or more prescriptions <b>for</b> a given <b>drug</b> within a specified time period. Results About 79. 1 % of the women received at least one prescription during pregnancy. The prescription rate <b>for</b> most <b>drugs</b> <b>for</b> chronic diseases and for occasional use decreased during pregnancy, whereas, as expected, the prescription rate <b>for</b> pregnancy-related <b>drugs</b> increased. During the first trimester of pregnancy, 1. 7 % of all <b>drugs</b> prescribed <b>for</b> chronic conditions and 2. 3 % of the occasional drugs were classified as harmful.

MethodsThis study used data from the 2008 Korea Health Panel Survey. The respondents were classified according to the purpose of the OTC drug use. The first group (n = 364) included respondents who had purchased OTC <b>drugs</b> <b>for</b> self-medication, and the second group (n = 955) included respondents who had taken OTC <b>drugs</b> <b>for</b> nutrition for more than 3 months. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify the factors contributing to the purchase of OTC drugs. ResultsThe self-medication group was more likely to be older and to have a chronic disease. In addition, the purchase of OTC drugs was related to the utilization of other health care services. The more outpatient services at clinics were used, the more the respondents tended to purchase OTC <b>drugs</b> <b>for</b> self-medication and nutrition. As hospital outpatient visits increased, however, the purchase of OTC <b>drugs</b> <b>for</b> self-medication decreased and the purchase of OTC <b>drugs</b> <b>for</b> nutrition increased. ConclusionsThis study shows that age and chronic disease are the major factors related to using OTC <b>drugs</b> <b>for</b> self-medication for long-term periods. Furthermore, this study suggests that the use of outpatient services is one of the factors associated with purchasing OTC drugs.
