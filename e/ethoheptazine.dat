50|$|<b>Ethoheptazine</b> (trade name Zactane) is an opioid {{analgesic}} from the phenazepane family. It {{was invented in}} the 1950s and is related to other drugs such as proheptazine and pethidine.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Ethoheptazine</b> {{produces}} similar {{effects to}} other opioids, including analgesia, sedation, dizziness and nausea. It was sold by itself as Zactane, {{and is still}} available as a combination product with acetylsalicylic acid and meprobamate as Equagesic, which {{is used for the}} treatment of conditions where both pain and anxiety are present. [...] It was also investigated for use as an antitussive.|$|E
50|$|The {{structure}} and properties of several related a- and ÃŸ-azabicyclane opioids was explored. Anazocine's chemical and structural relatives include opioid partial agonists, mixed agonist-antagonists, pure agonists, antagonists, and atypical non-opioid analgesics. It was tested in pigeons {{and in other}} experiments which contrasted and compared its analgesic effects {{to those of the}} phenazepine opioid <b>ethoheptazine</b> and the phenalkoxam open chain opioid propoxyphene, and pethidine as well.|$|E
5000|$|Its {{no longer}} {{sold in the}} United States however it may be sold again if the law is changed to remove the drug from the CSD. <b>Ethoheptazine</b> is not listed as a {{controlled}} substance under the Controlled Substances Act 1970 in the United States. The controlled status (Schedule IV) of Equagesic {{was due to the}} meprobamate content. [...] Regulation elsewhere varies. The Canadian Controlled Drugs & Substances act specifically excludes the phenazepine opioids, including proheptazine, from control.|$|E
