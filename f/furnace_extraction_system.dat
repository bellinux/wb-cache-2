40|$|We present initial {{results of}} in situ 14 C system blank and {{calibration}} sample measurements obtained using the in situ 14 C extraction scheme {{developed at the}} University of Cologne. The 14 C extraction scheme specifically exploits the phase transformation of quartz to cristobalite in order to quantitatively extract the carbon as CO 2 and follows a scheme that is different to that of existing <b>extraction</b> <b>systems.</b> Features are offline <b>furnace</b> <b>extraction,</b> single pass catalytic oxidation using mixed copper (I,II) oxide as catalyst, the use of UHV-compatible components and of vacuum annealed copper tubing. The design allows a relatively rapid sample throughput - two samples per day {{as opposed to the}} current 2 days per sample that can be done on other lines - and can accommodate samples ranging between 0. 5 and 4 g of clean quartz. Following extraction and cleaning, the CO 2 gas is measured using the gas ion source of the MICADAS AMS facility at ETH Zurich. The <b>extraction</b> <b>system</b> yields low systems blanks (10 + 16 /− 10 x 103 atoms 14 C, ± 1 σ) and the initial results indicate that further improvements are achievable. Measurements of the CRONUS-A standard sample show a good reproducibility and results are consistent with published values.

40|$|Information {{extraction}} {{is initially}} applied for identification of desired information from natural language documents and {{conversion of the}} extracted text into a self-defined presentation. With the rapidly increasing amount of available information sources and electronic documents on the World Wide Web, information extraction is extended for identification from structured and semi-structured web pages. In the past years, a lot of solutions are described and various information <b>extraction</b> <b>systems</b> are implemented. In this thesis, we present a theoretical analysis and comparison of several information <b>extraction</b> <b>systems</b> in two sub-areas: on the one hand, the systems distinguish {{from each other in}} the features used for identification. Thereby, we compare several aspects of different information <b>extraction</b> <b>systems,</b> such as pre-processing for generation of features, various constraints for characterization of target information, and different representations of extraction patterns, namely, how constraints are utilized. On the other hand, in order to reduce human efforts and improve the portability of information <b>extraction</b> <b>systems,</b> diverse machine learning techniques are applied for building information <b>extraction</b> <b>systems.</b> In this thesis, we represent various types of training data and introduce the active learning technique, the boosting algorithm and different rule learning algorithms used in information <b>extraction</b> <b>systems.</b> Most of the information <b>extraction</b> <b>systems</b> mentioned in this thesis employ rule learning techniques.

The conditions at the wall panels correspond to solids concentration between 0. 35 and 18 kg/m 3 and temperatures between 1054 and 1168 K. The heat transfer coefficient to the wall panels is similar in oxy-fuel and air-firing due to that the solids flow, which plays the main role in CFB furnace heat transfer, was kept similar in air and oxyfuel conditions. The modeled <b>furnace</b> heat <b>extraction</b> and in-furnace vertical profiles of temperature and solids concentration show generally good agreement with the corresponding measured values.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effect of <b>extraction</b> <b>systems</b> on the anthocyanin index, antioxidant kinetics (DPPH-radical scavenging capacity) and color of purple corn (Zea mays) seeds.

The anthocyanins index in different <b>extraction</b> <b>systems</b> was between 1. 09 to 2. 87 mg/g.
