500|$|According to Taylor's recollection, he {{was visiting}} McCartney {{at his home}} in St John's Wood, London, and asked the Beatle how he went about writing a song. In response, McCartney took Taylor into the dining room, where they both sat at a harmonium; McCartney then began playing the {{instrument}} and asked Taylor to call out the opposite to each word he happened to sing. Author Steve Turner writes of the result: [...] "And so it went – black and white, yes and no, stop and go, hello and goodbye." [...] Taylor later reflected: [...] "I've no memory at all of the tune... <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>whether</b> Paul really made up [...] that song as he went along or whether it was running through his head already." ...|$|E
500|$|Phelix D'Souza, a {{resident}} of Permannur, alleged that the police took him into custody and tortured him and opened a baseless case against him, sending him to jail for 11 days. Lance Rego, a Mangalore resident, claimed that [...] "many of the police personnel who entered the premises of Holy Cross Church at Kulshekar were wearing helmets usually worn by two-wheeler drivers and not the ones meant for police personnel. Hence, <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>whether</b> they were police personnel or cadres of the Bajrang Dal." [...] Another resident, Marcel Henry Ferao, alleged that [...] "prohibitory orders were imposed on those who were inside the church compound {{and not on the}} Bajrang Dal cadres who were outside the church compound and were pelting stones". Dinal Saldanha of Kulshekar alleged that the police used tear-gas shells which were past their expiry date on the premises, and that exposure to the gas resulted in problems with her eyesight. Many Catholic women reported incidents of police violence to the Deputy Commissioner M. Maheshwar Rao and other government officials, revealing their bruises, and demanding that action be taken against them.|$|E
2500|$|I {{wonder if}} Bill Lawry and Ray Illingworth {{knew of the}} {{tremendous}} effort that had been put {{by the people of}} Western Australia into the staging of this 205th Test between England and Australia? <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>whether</b> their teams were aware of it? If the answer to both of these questions is in the affirmative, their reaction was lamentable – by and large...they muffed it – [...] massacred it.|$|E

I wondered,' said Little Dorrit, looking at him in a suppliant way, and {{gradually}} withdrawing her eyes {{as he looked at}} her, 'whether you would advise me what I ought to do.' ...|$|R
2500|$|In 2005, Cornyn gained notice by {{connecting}} the Supreme Court's reluctance to hear arguments for sustaining Terri Schiavo's {{life with the}} recent murders of Judge Joan Lefkow's husband and mother {{as well as the}} courtroom murder of Judge Rowland Barnes. Cornyn said: [...] "I don't know if there is a cause-and-effect connection, but we have seen some recent episodes of courthouse violence in this country. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>whether</b> there may be some connection between the perception in some quarters on some occasions where judges are making political decisions yet are unaccountable to the public, that it builds up and builds up and building up to the point where some people engage in violence". His statement and a similar one by House Majority Leader Tom DeLay were widely denounced, including by The New York Times. Cornyn later said that he regretted the statement.|$|E
