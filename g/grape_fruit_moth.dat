40|$|Abstract The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to understand the residue and persistence behavior of Penconazole fungicide in <b>grape</b> <b>fruit</b> samples. The residues were analyzed by GC. The average initial deposit of in <b>grape</b> <b>fruit</b> was observed to be 1. 04 mg kg- 1 at single application rate. The recoveries of Penconazole on <b>grape</b> <b>fruit</b> were observed from 91. 04 % to 92. 13 % at fortification levels of 0. 1, 0. 5 and 1. 0 mg kg- 1. The reported limit of quantification (LOQ) was found to be 0. 02 mg kg- 1. The dissipation experiments showed the half-lives (T 1 / 2) of Penconazole were around 1. 56 days. According to the maximum residue limit (MRL) the pre-harvest interval (PHI) of Penconazole on grape was 14 days after the treatment...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Malaria {{is one of}} {{the most}} serious health {{challenges}} facing the world today. It is a disease caused by plasmodium, which could be cured by the use of drugs called anti-malaria drugs. This study shows the effects of some supplements (<b>Grape</b> <b>fruit</b> juice, orange fruit juice, Supermalt and vitamin C) on the efficacy and potency of some selected anti-malaria drugs (Camoquine and Artesunate). A total of 80 patients (adults) with malaria parasites were used. After which the anti-malaria drugs and the supplements were co-administered appropriately for 3 days. The result shows that the concomitant administration of the drugs with the multivitamin (Supermalt) did not alter the efficacy and potency of the drugs, while <b>grape</b> <b>fruit</b> juice, Orange Fruit Juice and vitamin C altered the efficacy and potency of the drugs. Therefore, the concomitant administration of these anti-malaria drugs with such supplements like <b>grape</b> <b>fruit</b> juice, Orange Fruit Juice and vitamin C should be avoided during the period of malaria treatment for the effectiveness of such drugs...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT — The granulovirus of {{codling moth}}, Cydia pomonella L., CpGV, is now com-mercialized for codling moth control in pome fruit in the USA and Canada. It is highly spe-cific for codling moth and related species. Comparative assays of CpGV against neonate larvae of another {{introduced}} tortricid pest, the oriental <b>fruit</b> <b>moth,</b> Grapholita molesta Busck, revealed a 557 and 589 fold lower susceptibility of neonate larvae {{compared with the}} LC 50 and LC 95 values derived for C. pomonella. Since its introduction into North America, the oriental <b>fruit</b> <b>moth,</b> Grapholita molesta Busck, has become a widely established pest of peach, nectarine, apricot, and apple (Rothschild and Vickers 1991). There is little information regarding naturally occurring disease of the oriental <b>fruit</b> <b>moth,</b> {{with the exception of}} mi-crosporidia in adults (Simchuk and Komarova 1983) and Bacillus thuringiensis in larva...|$|R
