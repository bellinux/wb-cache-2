Due to the massiveness {{of the structure}} and pedestal considerations, an octagonal foundation is designed {{in place of a}} simple rectangular footing. The design includes analyzing of loads from superstructure, design of base plate and <b>foundation</b> <b>bolt,</b> design of pedestal and footing. The design of pile is not considered in the present study. The main objective of the study is to evaluate the manual method of design procedure. The same footing is modeled in different commercial finite element software. Performance of the designed foundation as obtained from the finite element analysis is then compared with that obtained from manual calculations. Maximum moment obtained from the software for the given support forces are found to be higher than those calculated manually according to Process Industry Practices guideline. Therefore, the design process outlined in PIP underestimates the bending moment demand as per the present study. However the present study is based on one typical case study. There is a provision for repeating this study taking into consideration a large number of foundations with varying parameters to arrive at a more comprehensive conclusion...|$|E

40|$|There {{has been}} {{presented}} a new procedure of the seating of a combustion engines at the marine power plant with steel chocks cemented by a thixotropic polymer composition between the engine’s spot footing and the foundation ledge. A combustion engine is seated on foundation at the marine power plant by steel chocks or the chocks that are cast from polymer composition at the marine power plant. The arrangement, number and dimensions of foundation chocks, as well as arrangement, number and dimensions of the lateral and frontal stoppers that secure chocks work, are established by an engine manufacturer and are approved by Classification Society that supervises the vessel’s construction and operation. The author’s intention was to develop such chocks that combine the good resistance of steel chocks with the easiness of adjustment the bearing surfaces of polymer compositions chocks. Combination of these features was obtained for steel chocks which are glued by the relatively thin layers of polymer compositions between the engine spot footing and the foundation ledges. Such a method of making the chocks and seating with them the engines on foundation was claimed with the Patent RP No. 192120 on 24 th July 2000 for the Polish Naval Academy. In order to receive {{the approval of the}} Polish Register of Shipping to use new chocks at the marine power plants, the author carried out appropriate research, results of which are presented below.

25|$|Good {{practices}} in modern, earthquake-resistant structures dictate {{that there be}} good vertical connections throughout every component of the building, from undisturbed or engineered earth to foundation to sill plate to vertical studs to plate cap through each floor and continuing to the roof structure. Above the foundation and sill plate the connections are typically made using steel strap or sheet stampings, nailed to wood members using special hardened high-shear strength nails, and heavy angle stampings secured with through bolts, using large washers to prevent pull-through. Where inadequate bolts are provided between the sill plates and a foundation in existing construction (or are not trusted due to possible corrosion), special clamp plates may be added, {{each of which is}} secured to the <b>foundation</b> using expansion <b>bolts</b> inserted into holes drilled in an exposed face of concrete. Other members must then be secured to the sill plates with additional fittings.|$|R
50|$|The tornado briefly {{weakened}} {{and caused}} EF3 damage {{to some other}} businesses near Interstate 35, before crossing and mangling several vehicles in the process. The tornado regained EF4 intensity {{on the other side}} of the Interstate as it tore through several neighborhoods and destroyed numerous additional homes (though the EF4 damage swath was narrower at this point). A large grassy field between two subdivisions in this area was scoured to bare soil, with wind-rowed structural debris and several mangled vehicles strewn to the east. One brick home on Hunters Glen Court sustained EF5 damage, with only the slab <b>foundation</b> and anchor <b>bolts</b> remaining. Very little structural debris or house contents was recovered from that residence, and the small amount of debris that remained was wind-rowed well away from the site. Two vehicles were also lofted from the residence, one of which was thrown over 100 yd.|$|R
40|$|Circular {{base plates}} are {{commonly}} used for cylindrical columns, such as pylons in cabled-stayed bridges, lighting poles, electric power line posts, and even buildings. In some structures and conditions, a little gap is considered between the base plate and foundation. In this case, the whole forces are transmitted to the <b>foundation</b> via <b>bolts.</b> There are several explicit methods for design of rectangular base plates, {{which can be found}} in the AISC steel design guide series and in many other books, but an explicit method has not yet been presented for design of circular base plates. Therefore, in this study, we propose a procedure for designing circular base plates with large eccentric loads in which there is a little gap between base plate and foundation through analytical and numerical methods. It is assumed that the utmost compressive anchor bolt reaches to the allowable compressive stress and also critical section for calculation of base plate thickness to be the edge of the column. Comparison of theoretical and finite element analysis confirms the assumptions. Considered parameters in this study are the axial load and its eccentricity, thickness of base plate, and diameter of anchor bolts. It is concluded that the mentioned status is very useful for columns with large eccentric axial forces, because it causes the thickness of the base plate to be less in comparison with the other cases in which a gap is not considered.

40|$|Although {{two-dimensional}} methods provide accurate {{predictions of}} contact stresses and bolt load distribution in bolted composite joints with multiple bolts, {{they fail to}} capture the effect of thickness on the strength prediction. Typically, the plies close to the interface of laminates {{are expected to be}} the most highly loaded, due to bolt deformation, and they are usually the first to fail. This study presents an analysis method to account for the variation of stresses in the thickness direction by augmenting a two-dimensional analysis with a one-dimensional through the thickness analysis. The two-dimensional in-plane solution method based on the combined complex potential and variational formulation satisfies the equilibrium equations exactly, and satisfies the boundary conditions and constraints by minimizing the total potential. Under general loading conditions, this method addresses multiple bolt configurations without requiring symmetry conditions while accounting for the contact phenomenon and the interaction among the bolts explicitly. The through-the-thickness analysis is based on the model utilizing a beam on an elastic <b>foundation.</b> The <b>bolt,</b> represented as a short beam while accounting for bending and shear deformations, rests on springs, where the spring coefficients represent the resistance of the composite laminate to bolt deformation. The combined in-plane and through-the-thickness analysis produces the bolt/hole displacement in the thickness direction, as well as the stress state in each ply. The initial ply failure predicted by applying the average stress criterion is followed by a simple progressive failure. Application of the model is demonstrated by considering single- and double-lap joints of metal plates bolted to composite laminates...|$|R
40|$|Källsner and Girhammar have {{developed}} a new plastic design method for wood-frame shear walls at ultimate limit state. The method is capable of calculating the load-carrying capacity of partially anchored shear walls, where the leading stud is not necessarily anchored against uplift. In fully anchored shear walls, the leading stud needs to be anchored using some kind of hold-downs to resist uplift and the bottom rail needs to be fixed by anchor bolts to resist horizontal shear forces. In partially anchored shear walls, where hold-downs are not provided, the uplifting force is resisted by the sheathing-to-framing joints along the bottom rail. Hence, {{it is important that}} the bottom rail is anchored to the floor structure or <b>foundation</b> by anchor <b>bolts</b> and, therefore, able to transmit the forces to the structure below. Because of the eccentric load transfer, transverse bending is developed in the bottom rail and splitting of the bottom rail can occur. In order to use the plastic design method, a ductile behaviour of the sheathing-to-framing joints must be ensured. In this paper, results of tests on the splitting capacity of the bottom rail due to uplift in partially anchored shear walls are presented. Specimens with single-sided sheathing were tested, varying the size of washer, pith orientation of the bottom rails and anchor bolt position along the width of the bottom rail. The aim of the tests was to evaluate the influence of these parameters in order to avoid splitting failure of the bottom rail. Two types of brittle failure modes occurred during testing: (1) a crack opening from the bottom surface of the bottom rail and (2) a crack opening from the edge surface of the bottom rail along the line of sheathing-to-framing joints. These failure modes were mainly dependent on the washer size and the location of the anchor bolt. The results show that the distance between the edge of the washer and the loaded edge of the bottom rail has a decisive influence on the maximum load and the failure modes of the bottom rail.

50|$|The tornado {{touched down}} in the Lakeview community, {{initially}} causing structural damage to small buildings and snapping trees. The tornado grew in intensity as it struck Fyffe, where more significant damage occurred. Past Fyffe, the tornado became violent, and its width increased from around 50 yd to 0.5 mi as it entered eastern Rainsville, reaching EF5 strength and destroying numerous homes and businesses. A Huddle House restaurant, the Rainsville Civic Center, and a credit union were destroyed. Multiple vehicles were also thrown, including a school bus that was completely stripped down to its chassis. Numerous homes in the Rainsville area were swept completely away, with debris strewn up to {{a mile from the}} foundations. Some of these homes were connected to their <b>foundations</b> with anchor <b>bolts</b> and <b>foundation</b> straps. Trees were debarked and mobile homes were completely destroyed as well. Damage was particularly intense just northeast of Rainsville, and one well-built stone house in this area was completely obliterated, with the debris strewn well away from the structure. A large supporting cement and stone pillar was ripped completely out of the ground at this residence, pulling up a section of concrete foundation in the process. Scouring and pock-marking of the ground was noted in this area. Numerous homes were swept away along Lingerfelt Rd as well. At one house that was swept away in this area, supporting concrete anchors were ripped out of the ground, a concrete porch was ripped off with pieces strewn up to 150 yd away, a pick-up truck from the home was found mangled in pieces over 250 yd away, and a safe weighing 800 lb was pulled off its anchorage and thrown into a wooded area 600 ft away. When found, the safe's door had been ripped open and completely off. An underground storm shelter in this area had much of its dirt covering scoured away, the occupants of which reported that structure heaved upwards slightly as the tornado passed overhead. Pavement was scoured from several roads in the area, and a concrete porch was torn away and broken in half at another residence that was swept away.|$|R
