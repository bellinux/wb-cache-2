40|$|In this study, {{we measure}} {{the effect of}} {{perceived}} stereotypes on self-efficacy and academic performance specific to the Native American/Alaska Native population at Fort Lewis College. Stereotype threat is common within minorities and we seek the origin of stereotype threat in an academic setting. A survey was used to see how Native American student participants rated the following population’s perception of themselves: Non-Native American professors, Native American professors, Non-Native American students, and Native American students, along the measures of intelligence, motivation, and by preparedness (perceived stereotypes). We also measured self-efficacy on common academic success scales (e. g., <b>how</b> <b>well</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> concentrate on school subjects, <b>how</b> <b>well</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> complete homework by deadlines). Results suggested that stereotype threat does not exist from an out-group at Fort Lewis College, but from an in-group. Native American participants were not concerned with how Non-Native American professors and Non-Native American students perceived them on the perceived stereotype axis, but were more concerned with how Native American professors and Native American students perceived them on the perceived stereotype axis. Motivation {{was one of the}} key perceived stereotypes seen from Native American/Alaska Native participants that correlated with the participants’ self-efficacy. Despite the lack of perception from Native American participants’ perceived stereotypes and its effect on self-efficacy and academic performance, they still thought that Non-Native American professors and students thought of them as less intelligent, motivated, and prepared...|$|E

Global model analysis by land-scaping is an approach that sketches out the per-formance of a model at all of its parameter val-ues, creating a landscape of how the relative per-formance abilities of the model and a competing model. We demonstrate the usefulness of landscap-ing by comparing two models of information inte-gration (Fuzzy Logic Model of Perception and the Linear Integration Model). The results show that model distinguishability is akin to power, and may be improved by increasing the sample size, using better statistics, or redesigning the experiment.

40|$|<b>How</b> <b>well</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> {{know the}} {{dependencies}} within your system? Dependencies between methods, classes, interfaces, libraries and even different projects {{play an important}} role in today’s Java projects. Our solution, called How I KnOw My SYStem (HIKOMSYS), is essen-tially a platform for developers to improve their knowledge. HIKOMSYS provides a way to learn more about a project. With the help of gamification, HIKOMSYS engages developers to learn about their projects, in particular about its dependencies, while having fun. After uploading a project hosted on Github, users are able to select the modules within this project and draw the dependencies between those. As soon as they complete a quiz, HIKOMSYS gives the users helpful feedback, by showing them the dependencies they ignored, those wrongly assumed and of course those they knew about. Furthermore, users working on the same projects are able to compare their knowledge about their system wit...|$|E

Many people, {{including}} {{a large proportion}} of those who live close to the Great Lakes, do not have a basic understanding of the individual characteristics of and the differences between the lakes. Since it is difficult to understand many of the Great Lakes issues such as global warming, pollution, and water use without a basic understanding of the lakes, this activity is designed to help visualize the differences in the volume, length of shoreline, human population distribution, and fish populations of the Great Lakes. These categories are visually represented so that students can put the lakes in perspective with each other. This activity could be used as an introductory activity to the study of other Great Lakes issues. OBJECTIVES In this activity, students will develop a perception {{of the differences between the}} Great Lakes regarding their water volumes, length of shoreline, human population distribution, and the amount of fish harvested from each lake...|$|E

25|$|The first ostensive {{goal of a}} BMX racer is {{to become}} the number one amateur racer in your district. The racer's home state/province maybe divided up into several Districts {{depending}} how many participants and how spread out they are over the state/province. A balance is sought. Too many people in a single district could discourage new, inexperienced riders from having {{a sense of accomplishment}} if they are <b>doing</b> reasonably <b>well</b> but not advancing his point score up the list of total points in relation to other racers. Too small a district would cheapen any sense of accomplishment due to paucity of racers, producing an artificially high ranking for the following season for the racer(s) in the points race. Points determine <b>how</b> <b>well</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> in the district rankings. How high you go in the rankings depends on what skill level category you are in as <b>well</b> as <b>how</b> <b>well</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> in your particular races since it affects how many points you win, which adds to your total for your district ranking.
