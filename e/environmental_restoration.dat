5|$|People {{have lived}} in the Everglades region for {{thousands}} of years. Within the past 100years however, they have changed the natural landscape dramatically. Settlement of urban areas in South Florida was facilitated by large drainage projects intended to create more land. The drainage was often implemented without a full understanding of the intricacies of ecosystems and shaping processes of the Everglades. The South Florida metropolitan area grew exponentially, causing problems in ecosystems throughout the Everglades. By the 1990s, the diminishing quality of life in many of these urban areas was linked to the degraded local environment. The State of Florida and the U.S. government devised and passed a plan in 2000 to restore as much of the Everglades to pre-drainage conditions as possible. It is the costliest and most comprehensive <b>environmental</b> <b>restoration</b> project in history.|$|E

It was a controversial plan; detractors worried that it [...] "relies on uncertain technologies, overlooks water quality, subsidizes damaging growth and delays its environmental benefits".

500|$|Following {{this period}} of rapid {{development}} and environmental degradation, the ecosystem began to receive notable attention from conservation groups in the 1970s. Internationally, UNESCO and the Ramsar Convention designated the Everglades a Wetland Area of Global Importance. The construction of a large airport [...] north of Everglades National Park was blocked when an environmental study found that it would severely damage the South Florida ecosystem. [...] With heightened awareness and appreciation of the region, restoration began in the 1980s with the removal of a canal that had straightened the Kissimmee River. However, development and sustainability concerns have remained pertinent in the region. The deterioration of the Everglades, including poor water quality in Lake Okeechobee, {{was linked to the}} diminishing quality of life in South Florida's urban areas.

The downside to the book's impact, according to one writer addressing restoration of the Everglades, is that her metaphor is so prevailingly dominant that it is inaccurate in describing the complex web of ecosystems within the Everglades: [...] "River of Grass" [...] describes one. David McCally wrote that despite Douglas' [...] "appreciation of the complexity of the environmental system" [...] she described, popular conception of the Everglades shared by people who have not read the book overshadows her detailed explanations.|$|E
