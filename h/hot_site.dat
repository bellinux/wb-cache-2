2500|$|A hot/cold {{site is a}} {{location}} that an organization can move to after a disaster if the current facility is unusable. [...] The {{difference between the two}} is that a <b>hot</b> <b>site</b> is fully equipped to resume operations while a cold site does not have that capability. [...] There is also what is referred to as a warm site which has the capability to resume some, but not all operations. [...] The decision a company makes when determining what type of site to establish often hinges on the results of a cost-benefit analysis as well as the needs of the organization. [...] A disaster recovery plan spells out how relocation to a new facility is to be conducted. [...] Companies perform occasional tests and conduct trials to verify the viability and effectiveness of the plan and to determine if any deficiencies exist and how they can be dealt with. [...] An audit of a company's Disaster Recovery Plan primarily looks into the probability that operations of the organization can be sustained at the level that is assumed in the plan, as well as the ability of the entity to actually establish operations at the site. [...] A review of the disaster recovery plan generally involves examining and testing the procedures included, conducting outside research relating to Disaster recovery, determining reasonable standards relating to implementation, and touring, examining, and researching the outside facility.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>hot</b> <b>site</b> is a {{duplicate}} {{of the original}} site of the organization, with full computer systems as well as near-complete backups of user data. Real time synchronization between the two sites {{may be used to}} completely mirror the data environment of the original site using wide area network links and specialized software. Following a disruption to the original site, the <b>hot</b> <b>site</b> exists so that the organization can relocate with minimal losses to normal operations in the shortest recovery time. Ideally, a <b>hot</b> <b>site</b> will be up and running within a matter of hours. Personnel may have to be moved to the <b>hot</b> <b>site,</b> but {{it is possible that the}} <b>hot</b> <b>site</b> may be operational from a data processing perspective before staff has relocated. The capacity of the <b>hot</b> <b>site</b> may or may not match the capacity of the original site depending on the organization's requirements. This type of backup site is the most expensive to operate. Hot sites are popular with organizations that operate real time processes such as financial institutions, government agencies and eCommerce providers.The most important feature offered from a <b>hot</b> <b>site</b> is that the production environment(s) is running concurrently with the main datacenter. This syncing allows for minimal impact and downtime to business operations. In the event of a significant outage event, the <b>hot</b> <b>site</b> can take the place of the impacted site immediately. However, this level of redundancy does not come cheap, and businesses will have to weigh the cost-benefit-analysis (CBA) of <b>hot</b> <b>site</b> utilization.Nowadays if the backup site is down and misses the [...] "proactive" [...] approach it may not be considered a <b>hot</b> <b>site</b> depending on the level of maturity of the organization regarding the ISO 22301 approach (international standard for Business Continuity Management).|$|E

5000|$|In the UK, the Zone of Influence was {{historically}} {{measured as}} anywhere within 100m {{of the boundary}} of the high voltage compound at a <b>Hot</b> <b>Site.</b> Since 2007, it is allowable to use the Energy Networks Association (ENA) Recommendation S34 [...] ('A Guide for Assessing the Rise of Earth Potential at Substation Sites') to calculate Hot Zone. This is now defined as a contour line marking where the Rise Of Earth Potential (ROEP) exceeds 430V for normal reliability power lines or 650V for high reliability lines. The Zone extends in a radius from any bonded metalwork such as the site earth electrode system and boundary fence. This may effectively reduce the overall size of the Hot Zone.

50|$|Recovery as {{a service}} (RaaS), {{sometimes}} referred to as disaster recovery {{as a service}} (DRaaS), is a category of cloud computing used for protecting an application or data from a natural or human disaster or service disruption at one location by enabling a full recovery in the cloud. RaaS differs from cloud-based backup services by protecting data and providing standby computing capacity on demand to facilitate more rapid application recovery. RaaS capacity is delivered in a cloud-computing model so recovery resources are only paid for when they are used, making it more efficient than a traditional disaster recovery warm site or <b>hot</b> <b>site</b> where the recovery resources must be running at all times.|$|E
50|$|It {{was founded}} in 1995 by an early Internet pioneer Frank Addante as a search engine and a {{directory}}.

The site rose in popularity and in 1997 was the seventh most popular Internet site. The site was then sold to a CMGI company, Yesmail, only to be acquired later by Techlabs, Inc. in 1999. The directory was not a priority while under Techlabs ownership and was not actively edited or maintained.|$|E
50|$|Choosing {{the type}} of backup site to be used is decided by an {{organizations}} based on a cost vs. benefit analysis. Hot sites are traditionally more expensive than cold sites, since much of the equipment the company needs must be purchased and thus people are needed to maintain it, making the operational costs higher. However, if the same organization loses {{a substantial amount of}} revenue for each day they are inactive, then it may be worth the cost. Another advantage of a <b>hot</b> <b>site</b> is that it can be used for operations prior to a disaster happening. This load balanced production processing method can be cost effective, and will provide the users with the security of minimal downtime during an event that affects one of the data centers.|$|E
40|$|In this article, we have {{compared}} the metal-amino acid interactions in Tyr-Ag and Phe-Ag complexes through pH dependent SERS measurements. By analyzing {{the variation in}} relative intensities of SERS bands with the pH of the amino acid solution, we have obtained the orientation and conformation of the amino acid molecules on the Ag surface. The results obtained from our experimental studies are supported by the the energy minimized strucutres and the observed charge distributions in different terminals of the molecules. This, in a way, shows that SERS measurements not only exhibit {{the interaction of the}} amino acid molecules with Ag clusters but also demonstrate their orientation around it. We have addressed a long standing query on whether the amine group is directly attached with Ag surface along with the carboxylate group and π-electrons in these systems. In addition, pH dependent optical absorption and transmission electron microscopy measurements have been performed to understand the required conditions for the appearance of the SERS spectra {{in the light of the}} aggregation of metal particles and the number of <b>hot</b> <b>sites</b> in the sol. Our results confirm that the formation of <b>hot</b> <b>sites</b> in the sol plays a direct role to form a stable Ag-ligand complex.

40|$|Abstract. Objective maps of M 2 internal-tide {{variability}} {{are derived}} from TOPEX/POSEIDON altimeter data obtained near the Hawaiian Ridge. An estimate of the wavenumber spectrum shows that the radiation is dominated by a few spectral peaks at wavenumbers consistent with the theoretically expected value for mode- 1 internal tides. The data are not always consistent with the traveling wave model. Because the spacing of the altimeter tracks {{is larger than the}} internal-tide wavelength, the objective map underestimates the energy between the altimeter tracks. With this caveat, the maps are used to determine that 2. 6 GW of power is radiated from a 1700 km section of the Hawaiian Ridge. Time series of hydrographic data obtained at the <b>HOT</b> <b>site</b> north of Oahu, Hawaii show that changes in mode- 1 phase speed, caused by variations in stratification, have only a small effect on the propagation of the mode- 1 internal tides...|$|E
40|$|We have {{investigated}} the target choice of the related transposable elements Tc 1 and Tc 3 of the nematode C. elegans. The exact locations of 204 independent Tc 1 insertions and 166 Tc 3 insertions in an 1 kbp {{region of the genome}} were determined. There was no phenotypic selection for the insertions. All insertions were into the sequence TA. Both elements have a strong preference for certain positions in the 1 kbp region. <b>Hot</b> <b>sites</b> for integration are not clustered or regularly spaced. The orientation of the integrated transposon has no effect on the distribution pattern. We tested several explanations for the target site preference. If simple structural features of the DNA (e. g. bends) would mark <b>hot</b> <b>sites,</b> we would expect the patterns of the two related transposons Tc 1 and Tc 3 to be similar; however we found them to be completely different. Furthermore we found that the sequence at the donor site has no effect on the choice of the new insertion site, because the insertion pattern of a transposon that jumps from a transgenic donor site is identical to the insertion pattern of transposons jumping from endogenous genomic donor sites. The most likely explanation for the target choice is therefore that the primary sequence of the target site is recognized by the transposase. However, alignment of the Tc 1 and Tc 3 integration sites does not reveal a strong consensus sequence for either transposon...|$|R
