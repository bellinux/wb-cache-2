5|$|While {{the book}} focused on ancient civilizations, the {{majority}} of the film addresses environmental impacts of our current 'global civilization', including the impact of concentrating wealth {{in the hands of the}} 'financial class'. It is filmed as a mixture of interviews with individuals, from Wright himself to <b>Jane</b> <b>Goodall</b> and Margaret Atwood, interspersed with striking footage from all over the world. Mathieu Roy and Harold Crooks gave an interview in early 2012 on the challenges of adapting Ronald Wright's book into a succinct film.|$|E
5|$|Five {{years later}} in 1950, he became {{prosector}} for the Zoological Society of London and remained there for twelve years. When he left the London Zoo in 1962, the old prosectorium that has been his office was closed, many preserved biological specimens were discarded, and the era of anatomists working at the London Zoo—starting {{from the time of}} Richard Owen—came to a close. Between 1957 and 1958, Osman Hill also acted as a visiting scholar at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. Later in 1958, primatologist <b>Jane</b> <b>Goodall</b> studied primate behaviour under him in preparation for her studies of wild chimpanzees. In 1962, he was hired as the assistant director of the Yerkes National Primate Research Center (YNPRC) in Atlanta after being turned down for the position of director.|$|E
5|$|Spotted hyenas {{have also}} been found to catch fish, tortoises, humans, black rhino, hippo calves, young African elephants, {{pangolins}} and pythons. There {{is at least one}} record of four hyenas killing an adult or subadult hippopotamus in Kruger National Park. The fossil record indicates that the now extinct European spotted hyenas primarily fed on Przewalski's horses, Irish elk, reindeer, red deer, roe deer, fallow deer, wild boar, ibex, steppe wisent, aurochs, and woolly rhinoceros. Spotted hyenas are thought to be responsible for the dis-articulation and destruction of some cave bear skeletons. Such large carcasses were an optimal food resource for hyenas, especially at the end of winter, when food was scarce. Spotted hyenas may consume leather articles such as boots and belts around campsites. <b>Jane</b> <b>Goodall</b> recorded spotted hyenas attacking or savagely playing with the exterior and interior fittings of cars, and the species is thought to be responsible for eating car tyres.|$|E

5|$|The {{nominate}} population, {{especially in}} Africa, {{is known for}} its use of stones as tools. When a large egg, such as that of an ostrich or bustard, is located, the bird walks up to it with a large pebble held in its bill and tosses the pebble by swinging the neck down over the egg. The operation is repeated until the egg cracks from the blows. They prefer using rounded pebbles to jagged rocks. This behaviour, although it was believed that it was first reported by <b>Jane</b> <b>Goodall</b> in 1966, it was actually already known to Africans and was first reported by J. G. Wood in 1877. However, this has only been reported in Africa and has not been recorded in N. p. ginginianus. Tests with both hand-reared and wild birds suggest that the behaviour is innate, not learnt by observing other birds, and displayed once they associate eggs with food and have access to pebbles. Another case of tool-use described from Bulgaria involves the use of a twig as a tool to roll up and gather strands of wool to use for lining the nest.|$|E

25|$|Due to an {{overflow}} of handwritten notes, photographs, {{and data}} piling up at Jane's home in Dar es Salaam in the mid-1990s, the <b>Jane</b> <b>Goodall</b> Institute's Center for Primate Studies was created at the University of Minnesota to house and organise this data. Currently {{all of the}} original <b>Jane</b> <b>Goodall</b> archives reside there and have been digitised and analysed and placed in an online database. On 17 March 2011, Duke University spokesman Karl Bates announced that the archives will move to Duke, with Anne E. Pusey, Duke's chairman of evolutionary anthropology, overseeing the collection. Pusey, who managed the archives in Minnesota and worked with Goodall in Tanzania, had worked at Duke for a year.|$|E

25|$|Just as <b>Jane</b> <b>Goodall</b> studied {{chimpanzee}} {{social and}} family life by careful observation of chimpanzee behavior in the field, psychologists conduct naturalistic observation of ongoing human social, professional, {{and family life}}.

25|$|Tarzan's primitivist {{philosophy}} was absorbed by countless fans, amongst whom was <b>Jane</b> <b>Goodall,</b> who describes the Tarzan series {{as having a}} major influence on her childhood. She states that she felt she would be a much better spouse for Tarzan than his fictional wife, Jane, and that when she first began to live among and study the chimpanzees she was fulfilling her childhood dream of living among the great apes just as Tarzan did.|$|E
25|$|More recently, Sir Ian Wilmut, {{the man who}} was {{responsible}} for the first cloning of a mammal with Dolly the Sheep in 1996, was a graduate student at Darwin College. Famous naturalist and broadcaster David Attenborough graduated from the university, while the ethologist <b>Jane</b> <b>Goodall,</b> the world's foremost expert on chimpanzees did a PhD in Ethology at Darwin College. Anthropologist Dame Alison Richard, former vice-chancellor of the university, is also a Newnham College graduate.|$|E
25|$|When Leakey made an {{appearance}} in Louisville {{while on a}} nationwide lecture tour, Fossey took the color supplements that had appeared about her African trip in The Courier-Journal to show to Leakey, who remembered her and her interest in mountain gorillas. Three years after the original safari, Leakey suggested that Fossey could undertake a long-term study of the gorillas {{in the same manner}} as <b>Jane</b> <b>Goodall</b> had with chimpanzees in Tanzania. Leakey lined up funding for Fossey to research mountain gorillas, and Fossey left her job to relocate to Africa.|$|E

50|$|Through his still {{photographs}} and films, Van Lawick helped popularize {{the study of}} chimpanzees during his then-wife <b>Jane</b> <b>Goodall's</b> studies at Gombe Stream National Park during the 1960s and 1970s. His films drew {{the attention of the}} viewing public to the dramatic life cycles of several wild animals of the Serengeti, such as wild dogs, elephants, and lions.|$|R
25|$|Fossey {{strongly}} opposed wildlife tourism, as gorillas are very susceptible to human anthroponotic diseases like influenza {{for which they}} have no immunity. Fossey reported several cases in which gorillas died because of diseases spread by tourists. She also viewed tourism as an interference into their natural wild behavior. Fossey also criticized tourist programs, often paid for by international conservation organizations, for interfering with both her research and {{the peace of the}} mountain gorillas' habitat, and was concerned <b>Jane</b> <b>Goodall,</b> who actually joined a chimpanzee society as a member, was inappropriately changing her study subjects' behavior.|$|E
25|$|When a baby {{chimpanzee}} or gorilla dies, {{the mother}} {{will carry the}} body around for several days before it may finally {{be able to move}} on without it; this behavior has been observed in other primates, as well. <b>Jane</b> <b>Goodall</b> has described chimpanzees as exhibiting mournful behavior toward the loss of a group member with silence and by showing more attention to it. And they will often continue grooming it and stay close to the carcass until the group must move on without it. Another notable example is Koko, a gorilla that uses sign language, who expressed sadness and even described sadness about the death of her pet cat, All Ball.|$|E
25|$|Gerald Weiss {{noted that}} {{although}} Tylor's classic definition of culture {{was restricted to}} humans, many anthropologists take this for granted and thus elide that important qualification from later definitions, merely equating culture with any learned behavior. This slippage is a problem because during the formative years of modern primatology, some primatologists were trained in anthropology (and understood that culture refers to learned behavior among humans), and others were not. Notable non-anthropologists, like Robert Yerkes and <b>Jane</b> <b>Goodall</b> thus argued that since chimpanzees have learned behaviors, they have culture. Today, anthropological primatologists are divided, several arguing that non-human primates have culture, others arguing that they do not.|$|E

50|$|Also {{covered in}} this episode were {{molecular}} genetics, and DNA fingerprinting, which was first developed at Leicester University (where {{his father was}} principal in earlier years).

Attenborough showed the books containing {{the whole of the}} decoded human genome.|$|R
