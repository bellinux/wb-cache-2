2500|$|With the {{question}} of the common rule directly raised, Griffith CJ considered the constitutional power for the prevention of disputes, maintaining his view that both dispute and arbitration connotes the existence of parties taking opposite sides. Both the employer and employees may be happy with their current arrangements such that there was no dispute to be prevented and that the making of a common rule award was the exercise of legislative power. Barton J reiterated that arbitration for the settlement of a dispute confines the award to the ambit of the dispute and to binding only the disputants. Barton J similarly rejected the notion that there could be arbitration to prevent a dispute [...] and that arbitration connotes the settlement of a dispute between parties. O'Connor J held that arbitration involved [...] "a <b>judicial</b> <b>settlement</b> of matters in difference between parties to a dispute" [...] and that the effect of a common rule [...] "is to confer a law making power, and not an arbitral power".

40|$|The role of {{arbitration}} in settling disputes {{which involves}} national and transnational commercial transactions is steadily growing {{in this era}} of globalisation. International and national rules governing various aspects of commercial arbitration have contributed to the effectiveness of arbitration as an alternative to litigation. The involvement of national courts is crucial to the overall efficacy of arbitration, both domestic and international. Instances calling for court intervention may appear at all stages of the arbitral proceedings. There is, however, a need to maintain a balance between the level of court involvement and the smooth functioning of arbitration - which is a contractual alternative to <b>judicial</b> dispute <b>settlement.</b> This article deals with the legal and practical role of Ethiopian courts during the three stages of arbitral proceeding, i. e., at the beginning of arbitration, during the arbitral proceedings, and {{after the end of the}} arbitration.

We draw on a novel dataset on the duration of commercial disputes in Slovenia to study how the timing of settlement is shaped by the stages and features of the litigation process. Using competing risk regression analysis, we find that events such as court-annexed mediation and the first court session, which enable the disputing parties to refine their respective expectations about the case outcome, in general reduce case duration to settlement. The magnitude of the respective effects, however, varies with time. Completion of subsequent court sessions, in contrast, {{does not affect the}} time to <b>settlement.</b> <b>Judicial</b> workload affects the timing of settlement indirectly, via the effect on the timing of the first court session.

40|$|International law {{prohibits the}} {{acquisition}} of territory by force. Even so, states have struggled to identify a judicial or arbitral procedure to protect their rights following an unlawful attempted acquisition. With reference to the annexation of Crimea, but {{with a view to}} the wider possibilities for <b>judicial</b> or arbitral <b>settlement</b> of territorial questions, the present Article considers three mechanisms [...] the European Convention on Human Rights (European Convention), the Statute of the International Court of Justice (ICJ Statute), and bilateral investment treaties. Recent decisions of the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) suggest that its inter-state procedure holds some promise in such a situation. By comparison, attempts by a state to protect its territorial rights before the ICJ [...] for example, by Georgia against Russia [...] have encountered serious obstacles. This Article starts by considering the ECHR. It then turns to the ICJ, the jurisdiction of which has extended to territorial questions in some of its best-known cases but, in others, may be of limited use to a state seeking to defend its territorial rights directly. The Article then turns to investment treaties and asks, though they have not been used to address territorial disputes so far, what role they might play...|$|R
40|$|Analysing {{disputes}} between the US and the EU under GATT and the WTO respectively, the paper {{demonstrates that the}} judicialization (or legalization) of international dispute settlement procedures can contribute to states’ compliance with these dispute settlement mechanisms. The paper compares four sets of pairwise similar disputes with US had with the EU: the socalled Domestic International Sales Corporations (DISC) case (which arose under GATT) and the Foreign Sales Corporations case (which was settled through WTO procedures), the Steel case (GATT) and the Patents case (WTO), the two Hormones cases under GATT and the WTO respectively, and the Citrus case (GATT) and the Bananas case (WTO). In {{each of the four}} comparisons the US acted more in accordance with the <b>judicial</b> WTO dispute <b>settlement</b> procedures than with the diplomatic GATT procedures. We can therefore say that contrary to realist assumptions, the judicialization of dispute settlement procedures can contribute to their effectiveness. However, contrary to idealist assumptions the effectiveness of international dispute settlement procedures does not automatically follow from their judicialization. Yet, as assumed by institutionalists, judicialized dispute settlement procedures are better than diplomatic dispute settlement mechanisms in sustaining states’ compliance with these procedures precisely because of their normative and strategic effects...|$|R
