40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{study was}} performed on the effects of adding sulfate-rich wash tower effluent from the Athens <b>hospital</b> <b>waste</b> <b>incinerator</b> to the Ano Liossia landfill of Athens. The method of mass balance was used to examine the production of leachate, the generation of methane, and the reduction of sulfates into sulfides. The water mass balance was performed using the method of Thornthwaite and the result indicated that the leachate collection facility at Ano Liossia landfill would be able to handle the additional leachate. The hydrocarbon-methane mass balance was performed using the EPA's LandGEM model which is based on first-order decomposition of the waste. A 26 % difference between the generation of methane in a conventional landfill and a bioreactor landfill was predicted. Finally, a first-order model was developed by analogy to the LandGEM model to study the reduction reaction of sulfates into sulfides. The amount of hydrogen sulfide produced from solid waste disposed in the landfill dominated the amount of hydrogen sulfide produced from the additional wastewater. Thesis (M. Eng.)

40|$|Nitrogen {{containing}} compounds such as ammonia, urea and amines {{can effectively}} inhibit {{the formation of}} polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs). Sewage sludge accumulates both sulfur and nitrogen during wastewater treatment {{so it could be}} used to reduce PCDD/Fs formation. Indeed, it is observed in this study that the gas evolving from the sludge drying process can significantly suppress chlorobenzene (CBz) and PCDD/Fs formation from fly ash collected from a <b>hospital</b> <b>waste</b> <b>incinerator.</b> For instance, the reduction of hexachlorobenzene (HxCBz) and PCDD/Fs amount was 92. 1 % and 78. 7 %, respectively, when the drying gas evolving from 2 g sludge flew through 2 g fly ash. These tests were conducted in the frame of projects devoted to hospital waste incineration. The disposal technology for hospital waste (HW), developed in this institute, features rotary kiln pyrolysis combined with post-combustion followed by flue gas cleaning. Hence, some preliminary tests were devoted to investigate dioxins suppression by co-pyrolysis and co-combustion of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and sludge in lab scale. More experimental research will be conducted to appropriately assess these effects of sludge on PCDD/Fs emissions during co-pyrolysis/combustion of HW and sludge...|$|E

40|$|Medical establishments play {{important}} roles in different activities by using of modern technology to serve the humans and the environment through different departments in the establishment and its firms. Medical wastes are considered as a hazardous waste because they contain toxic materials, infectious, or non-infectious wastes and they are considered as a hazard to millions of patients, health care workers, and visitors. Treatment processes for medical wastes comprise autoclaving, microwaving, chemical disinfection, irradiation, plasma system, and incineration. Incineration is a thermal process, which destroys most of the waste including microorganisms. Combustion process must be under controlled conditions to convert wastes containing hazardous materials into mineral residues and gases. <b>Hospital</b> <b>waste</b> <b>incinerators</b> may emit a number of pollutants depending on the waste being incinerated. These pollutants include particulate matter, acid gases, toxic metals, and toxic organic compounds products of incomplete combustion, e. g., dioxins, furans, and carbon monoxide, as well as sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides. So, {{there should be a}} reduction of emissions of most of these pollutants by air pollution control devices. This study was conducted in 51 medical establishments (ME) in Alexandria. To evaluate its incinerators. It was found that only 31. 4 % of total ME have their own incinerators to treat their medical <b>waste.</b> Also, the <b>incinerators</b> conditions were poor with incomplete combustion.

40|$|Background and purpose: <b>Hospital</b> <b>wastes</b> pose {{a serious}} public health problem. This is {{primarily}} {{caused by the}} way individual components of the waste is handled. One acceptable method for managing the medical waste is incineration but uncontrolled incinerators can cause emission of pollutants to atmosphere. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate pollutants emission from <b>hospital</b> <b>waste</b> <b>incinerators</b> in Hamadan. Materials and methods: In this investigation, samples were collected from Emam, Syna, Fatemieh, Mobasher Kashani hospital incinerators to determine the level of lead, mercury, cadmium, benzene, toluene. Xylene, carbon monoxide, sulphour dioxide and particulate. Collected samples were analysed using gas chromatograph, atomic absorbtion, spectrometer and smoke meter in the laboratory or by SO 2 and CO meter as a direct method in the field. Results: Results show that Mobasher hospital has maximum concentration of metals fume such as lead, mercury, cadmium (1113, 540, 3340 mg/m 3, respectively). Mean concentration of sulphour dioxide was 127 ppm and for suspended particulate concentration was 639 mg/m 3. In Syna hospital, the concentration of aromatic hydrocarbons including benzene, toluene, xylene and carbon monoxide were maximum (77. 46, 108. 64, 33. 6 mg/m 3 and 1041 ppm respectively). Conclusion: It can be concluded that hospital atmospheric pollutants are higher than EPA standards, at least with P< 0. 05 which can be due to inopportune opening door of combustion chamber, input of excess air mass, low temperature, unmixed solid waste and unsuitable design of the incinerator, and leak or unsuitable pollution control device...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this investigation was}} to achieve a clear pattern of solid waste collection and disposal in selected hospital and health care establishments in certain cities of Tehran province. This study was done in more than 82 percent of all hospitals with 3017 beds during the year 1996. Solid waste produced per bed was evaluated to be 2. 87 kg per day which was 8670 kg per day, for all beds, comprising less than 1 % of the total solid waste generated in the same cities during the same period. According to the information gathered in the 84. 2 % hospitals and health care centres, solid wastes were collected manually by labourers from various sections. Detention time of the waste in 89. 5 % of the cases was nearly 24 h. Densities of this type of waste were estimated to be 193. 18 kg/m 3 with plastic bag and 247. 72 kg/m 3 without bag.

The efficiency of these industries is very much dependent upon boiler’s efficiency. Hence, it is necessary to carry out the maintenance of boiler at regular intervals so as to avoid any unwanted shutdown. However, operation of boiler leads to number of problems such as agglomeration, slagging, fouling, caustic embrittlement, fatigue failure and hot corrosion which are responsible for their unwanted shutdown [3]. Moreover, fireside of boilers suffers maximum damage. Hence, it is necessary to find the solutions either to avoid or to remove such type of problems in the boiler. Therefore, in the present paper effort has been made to discuss the problems as well as their possible solutions according to the available literature.|$|R

Based on the fact that bottom ashes from waste incineration are classified as non-hazardous wastes according to the European Waste Catalogue, the aim of the present work was to investigate the feasibility of addressing the potential use of such residues in cement-based mixtures. This issue was suggested by the analysis of the properties of different bottom ashes coming from Italian municipal and <b>hospital</b> solid <b>waste</b> <b>incinerators,</b> which showed a chemical composition potentially suitable for such applications. Different mixes were prepared by blending bottom ash with ordinary Portland cement in different proportions and at different water dosages.

40|$|I Data {{from large}} {{incinerators}} shows the potential release of dioxins, heavy metals, and acid gases as air pollutants. Hospital incinerators can present similar problems {{to a much}} greater degree, especially,sinc-e,most of these smaller incinerators do not have effective c'ijmbustion or emission controls and their emissions are poorly dispersed. Hospital incinerators are particularly troublesome {{because of the high}} content of plastics in the waste.

Bottom ashes were dominated by low molecular weight PAHs (LM-PAH; containing two- to three-ringed PAHs) and medium molecular weight PAHs (MM-PAH; containing four-ringed PAHs), while fly ashes were abundantin MM-PAH and high molecular weight PAHs (HM-PAH, containing five- to six-ringed PAHs). Statistical analysis indicated that there was a positive relationship (R- 2 = 0. 88) between organic matter and total PAHs thus {{it has the potential to}} be used as an indicator for PAHs in HW ashes. Moreover, it was found that PAHs in the ashes correlated highly with some metallic elements either positively (e. g.
