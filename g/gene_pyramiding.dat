High similarity in agro-morphologic traits and absence of antagonistic effects for yield and other characters were observed in the best pyramided lines.|$|R
30|$|Bph 17 was cloned from Sri Lankan indica variety Rathu Heenati. Initially, Bph 17 was fine-mapped to a 79  kb region {{containing}} four clustered genes on chromosome 4 S. Transgenic {{tests showed}} that three genes independently confer resistance to BPH, and <b>gene</b> <b>pyramided</b> transgenic lines showed enhanced resistance. Bph 17 is actually a cluster of three genes encoding plasma membrane-localized lectin receptor kinases (OsLecRK 1 —OsLecRK 3), which collectively function to confer broad-spectrum, durable resistance and provide an important gene source for MAS and transgenic breeding for BPH resistance (Liu et al. 2015).|$|R
30|$|It is {{generally}} assumed that when such R <b>genes</b> are <b>pyramided</b> {{in a single}} plant, these act together to provide protection against all the target pests. However, some reports indicate antagonistic interactions among the R genes leading to compromise in resistance (Sundaram et al. 2009). To note such interactions among the R genes present studies were undertaken by us with 10 R <b>gene</b> <b>pyramided</b> rice lines in the genetic background of the popular elite cultivar Samba Mahsuri (BPT 5204). In a parallel study we performed a microarray experiment to understand the cross talk between R genes under combined infection/infestation by BB, BL and GM (Maku et al. unpublished). This study identified a set of key genes which were observed to be induced under such combined challenge. In this paper, we have attempted to validate the expression of these genes at different time points and in different tissues under combined and individual challenges {{in order to gain}} better insights into the molecular crosstalk between the defense genes. Results revealed no distinct antagonism among gene expression leading to compromised resistance under combined threat.|$|R
40|$|<b>Gene</b> <b>pyramiding</b> aims {{to design}} {{superior}} trait through selecting and combining favorite target alleles {{into a single}} genotype, thus it was advocated for designing breeding programs via selecting and pyramiding optimal combinations of alleles. In this study, we investigated selection for <b>gene</b> <b>pyramiding</b> design given the animal segregating population and the target trait was controlled by major genes. The admixed population {{was used as the}} base population. The mating parents were selected via detecting the favorite genes or linked markers and offspring were produced by the discrete recombination of parents. The phenotypic values were predicted by the genotype-phenotype model. Three selection strategies-genotypic selection, simple phenotypic selection and phenotypic selection integrating molecular information were developed. In genotypic selection, we only considered the favorite allele frequencies and base population sizes in admixed population and in phenotypic selection, we used genotype-phenotype model including trait heritability, gene effect and gene interaction effects to predicate phenotypic values. In each generation, we calculated population hamming distance, average superior genotype frequency and average phenotypic value to comprehensively measure the progress of <b>gene</b> <b>pyramiding.</b> The strategy requires minimum generations to gain <b>gene</b> <b>pyramiding</b> were defined as the optimization strategy. Examples were given for four target genes in order to compare the progress of <b>gene</b> <b>pyramiding.</b> The results indicate that <b>gene</b> <b>pyramiding</b> breeding process was greatly affected by the selection strategy. The gene effect and gene interaction effects information affect the selection of optimal genotype combinations and more precise molecular information was needed to guide the design of effective <b>gene</b> <b>pyramiding</b> breeding programs...|$|E
40|$|Marker-assisted <b>gene</b> <b>pyramiding</b> aims {{to produce}} {{individuals}} with superior economic traits {{according to the}} optimal breeding scheme which involves selecting a series of favorite target alleles after cross of base populations and pyramiding them into a single genotype. Inspired by the science of evolutionary computation, we used the metaphor of hill-climbing to model the dynamic behavior of <b>gene</b> <b>pyramiding.</b> In consideration of the traditional cross program of animals along with the features of animal segregating populations, four types of cross programs and two types of selection strategies for <b>gene</b> <b>pyramiding</b> are performed from a practical perspective. Two population cross for pyramiding two genes (denoted II), three population cascading cross for pyramiding three genes(denoted III), four population symmetry (denoted IIII-S) and cascading cross for pyramiding four genes (denoted IIII-C), and various schemes (denoted cross program-A–E) are designed for each cross program given different levels of initial favorite allele frequencies, base population sizes and trait heritabilities. The process of <b>gene</b> <b>pyramiding</b> breeding for various schemes are simulated and compared based on the population hamming distance, average superior genotype frequencies and average phenotypic values. By simulation, {{the results show that}} the larger base population size and the higher the initial favorite allele frequency the higher the efficiency of <b>gene</b> <b>pyramiding.</b> Parents cross order is shown {{to be the most important}} factor in a cascading cross, but has no significant influence on the symmetric cross. The results also show that genotypic selection strategy is superior to phenotypic selection in accelerating <b>gene</b> <b>pyramiding.</b> Moreover, the method and corresponding software was used to compare different cross schemes and selection strategies...|$|E
30|$|MAS {{also allow}} us to combine {{beneficial}} QTL alleles in one plant {{in a relatively short}} time (Ashikari and Matsuoka 2006). This concept, <b>gene</b> <b>pyramiding,</b> was successfully used to develop a new high-yield line with lodging resistance in an elite genetic background. This was done by crossing an NIL containing a gene for semi-dwarfism with one containing a gene/QTL encoding increased grain number (Ashikari et al. 2005). <b>Gene</b> <b>pyramiding</b> is also useful to improve traits controlled by multiple QTLs.|$|E
30|$|Pyramiding of {{multiple}} R genes is often suggested {{as a strategy}} for durable and multiple pest resistance in crop plants. Tagging, mapping and cloning {{of several of the}} R genes conferring resistance against bacterial blight (BB), blast (BL) and gall midge (GM) in rice has led to identification of reliable molecular markers linked to the gene and gave a fillip to marker assisted selection and breeding for multiple pest resistance. Most often, Xa 21, xa 13, xa 5 conferring resistance to BB; Pi 1, Pi 2, Pi 9 and Pi 54 against blast and Gm 1, Gm 4 and gm 3 against gall midge are involved in such breeding projects (Sundaram et al. 2008; Sundaram et al. 2009; Basavaraj et al. 2010; Das and Rao 2015; Arunakumari et al. 2016; Balachiranjeevi et al. 2015; Kumar et al. 2017; Ramalingam et al. 2017; Das et al. 2018). Specific gene based or closely linked PCR markers are available for these genes. Several popular elite rice lines have been ‘improved’ by incorporating some of these genes through Marker Assisted Backcross Breeding (MABB) involving both foreground and background selection (Kumar et al. 2017). Some of these studies have shown combined resistance to target pests like BB and BL or BB and GM (Kumar et al. 2017) in the <b>gene</b> <b>pyramided</b> lines under greenhouse controlled infection studies. It is assumed that <b>pyramided</b> <b>genes</b> act in unison and express combined resistance. Here we have examined this issue with greater clarity and with combination {{of multiple}} R genes against BB, BL and GM in ten <b>gene</b> <b>pyramided</b> lines developed in a common genetic background covering 14 defense related genes. We did not observe instances of distinct antagonism but recorded synergism among resistance pathways against these target pests.|$|R
30|$|Marker-assisted {{selection}} (MAS) is {{an indirect}} selection process in molecular breeding. A trait {{of interest is}} selected based on DNA-based molecular markers co-segregated with or derived from portions of the gene that controls the trait rather than the trait itself. MAS is a precise and efficient selection system that allows for recessive allele selection, early stage selection and multiple <b>genes</b> <b>pyramiding</b> without traditional phenotypic evaluation for each trait. The development of molecular markers for the selection of genes is a goal for many rice breeding programs (Blair and McCouch 1997). The gene sequences and the whole rice genome sequence provide a powerful platform for developing simple and precise molecular markers for MAS.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are many}} {{classical}} and modern breeding techniques {{that can be}} utilized for crop improvement in organic agriculture despite the ban on genetically modified organisms. For instance, controlled crosses between individuals allow desirable genetic variation to be recombined and transferred to seed progeny via natural processes. Marker assisted selection can also be employed as a diagnostics tool to facilitate selection of progeny who possess the desired trait(s), greatly speeding up the breeding process. [...] This technique has proven particularly useful for the introgression of resistance genes into new backgrounds, {{as well as the}} efficient selection of many resistance <b>genes</b> <b>pyramided</b> into a single individual. Unfortunately, molecular markers are not currently available for many important traits, especially complex ones controlled by many genes.|$|R
30|$|Three popular {{breeding}} {{methods used}} for <b>gene</b> <b>pyramiding</b> are pedigree, backcrossing and recurrent selection. In cross-pollinating crops, <b>gene</b> <b>pyramiding</b> is accomplished through recurrent selection. Successful {{quantitative trait locus}} (QTL) introgression depends on the optimized expression of newly introgressed QTLs in the recipient genome background, {{with the aim of}} maximizing productivity. A general framework for addressing these considerations through the pyramiding of multiple QTLs into a single favorable genetic background has been proposed, although such techniques are time-consuming (Servin et al. 2004).|$|E
30|$|The {{saturation}} of SNP markers in our {{linkage map}} increased {{the resolution of}} QTL mapping. Our study offers new insights on salinity tolerance and presents useful candidate genes that will help in marker-assisted <b>gene</b> <b>pyramiding</b> to develop salt tolerant rice varieties.|$|E
30|$|The {{validated}} markers for genes/QTLs {{with major}} effects could be directly used in breeding for grain quality via marker-assisted selection.

30|$|OsBAK 1, as a BRI 1 -associated {{receptor}} kinase (BAK 1), {{has been proven}} to participate in BR signal transduction and regulate plant architecture in rice (Li et al. 2009; Shimin et al. 2014), but no mutants have been identified so far, {{and there was no}} comprehensive investigation of OsBAK 1 function on yield-related traits. In this study, we identified a mutant of OsBAK 1 in the indica background, named 08 sg 2, which exhibited a decreased plant height, grain size, grain number and panicle length. Loss of function of OsBAK 1 in the japonica background exhibited significantly decreased grain size and number, but less so than in the indica background. Our results show that the reduced grain length of 08 sg 2 was due to decreased cell proliferation. 08 sg 2 was insensitive to BR, and 08 SG 2 affected the expression of BR-related <b>genes.</b> <b>Pyramiding</b> analysis indicated that 08 SG 2 /OsBAK 1 regulate grain length independently of GS 3.|$|R
30|$|The {{brown planthopper}} (BPH) {{has become the}} most {{destructive}} and a serious threat to the rice production in Asia. Breeding the resistant varieties with improved host resistance is the most effective and ecosystem-friendly strategy of BPH biological management. As host resistance was always broken down by the presence of the upgrading BPH biotype, the more resistant varieties with novel resistance <b>genes</b> or <b>pyramiding</b> known identified BPH resistance genes would be needed urgently for higher resistant level and more durability of resistance.|$|R
30|$|Host-plant {{resistance}} is a cost-effective and environmentally safe approach to reduce yield loss caused by BB disease of rice. Several BB resistance genes identified to date are either race specific or express susceptibility {{to the emerging}} races of the pathogen. Our study provides some clues to a successful pyramiding of three BB resistance genes into an elite japonica cultivar to control BB disease caused by a new race, K 3 a. We used a dual- selection strategy of phenotypic and genotypic selection along with background genotyping to isolate improved breeding lines with three <b>pyramided</b> <b>genes</b> conferring strong resistance to BB. Furthermore, our study on the evaluation of agronomic traits revealed that the accumulation of three-gene pyramids did not show a yield penalty. Future studies on the transfer of these <b>pyramided</b> <b>genes</b> into other genetic backgrounds may help in controlling BB disease caused by different races of the pathogen.|$|R
30|$|These {{different}} {{examples of}} <b>gene</b> <b>pyramiding</b> clearly demonstrate {{that it is}} a good strategy to quantitatively improve resistance. From the quantitative point of view, it is noteworthy that all categories of genes (except R genes) provide, on average, the same levels of resistance.|$|E
30|$|If {{examples}} of <b>gene</b> <b>pyramiding</b> (Table  4) are excluded, this represents the individual {{examination of the}} potential of 56 genes (Tables  1, 2, and 3). When excluding genes for which detrimental side effects were observed, only half (28) of the genes remain.|$|E
40|$|The {{threat posed}} by soybean rust (Phakopsora pachyrhizi) on soybean {{production}} is worsened by resistance breakdown associated with single gene resistance present in most cultivars. Few studies have however been undertaken to use mapped simple sequence markers for <b>gene</b> <b>pyramiding</b> to enhance rust resistance. This study validated use of identified simple sequence repeat markers for <b>gene</b> <b>pyramiding,</b> and determined the most effective pairwise gene combination for three independent soybean rust resistance genes, Rpp 2, Rpp 3 and Rpp 4. Markers Satt 460 and AF 162283 were polymorphic for the three resistance genes among the parents and were therefore used in selections made in the F 2 and F 3 families. In the F 2 generation, soybean plants (homozygous dominant or heterozygous at both loci) with two gene combinations had relatively lower disease severity and sporulation than the parents, suggesting complementary epistatic gene action for resistance. Similarly, homozygous F 3 families showed lower severity, lesion density and sporulation. Gene Rpp 3 contributed positively to resistance with various genetic backgrounds for most parameters measured, compared to Rpp 2 and Rpp 4 resistance genes. Overall, {{the results suggest that}} marker <b>gene</b> <b>pyramiding</b> is feasible and can substantially increase resistance to soybean rust through reduced severity and reduced sporulating lesions...|$|E
30|$|Under {{the present}} {{predicted}} scenario {{of a food}} and fuel crisis, coupled with global warming, cellulosic bioethanol shows promise {{as an alternative to}} petroleum. Filamentous fungi such as F. oxysporum could be commercially competitive CBP agents, or components of their enzymatic arsenal could {{contribute to the development of}} a ‘designer’ CBP agent. CBP needs much robust microbial agents in order to bring this process to the level of industrial expectations. The most efficient CBP of lignocellulose will most likely be achieved using a consortium of enzymes contributed by several microbes that are either working in unison or as donors of <b>genes</b> <b>pyramided</b> into one or more ‘designer’ organisms. Approach for such a designer agent should include (i) increasing the ethanol yield, (ii) eliminating by-products, (iii) improving the tolerance to ethanol, and (iv) introduction of new metabolic pathways for assimilating lignocellulose sugars. Understanding all these components and the complexity of the networks involved will be important in selecting such a consortia or designing such an organism. A functional genomic or proteomic approach could help unfold the networks involved and would open up many more avenues for the improvement of CBP agents. Then synthetic biology can provide new tools to rewire the cell components (promoters, regulators, terminators, enzymes, operons, transporters, etc.) in order to reach the desired features for the production of economically viable biofuels. Although some successful examples were already reported in bacteria and yeast, a crucial remaining challenge is to apply these approaches in fungi, which have a tremendous potential since they are the effective producers of critical cellulases.|$|R
40|$|The {{transition}} from {{hunting and gathering}} to farming happened about 10, 000 years ago, independently and diffusely in several places in the world. Plant breeders were responsible for genetic progress {{in a number of}} crop species. It included hybrids, the introgression of wild species genes and also the Green Revolution, which started in the 1960 's with the cereals. The varieties developed by breeding, along with the use of new crop technology (fertilization, soil tillage, etc.) changed the status of some countries from importers to exporters of food. In the turn of the millennium,, plant breeding, faces new challenges in a globalized world, but it has new tools to deal with them. Notwithstanding the present contributions of plant breeding and crop management, its future contributions may be even greater. The partnership being developed between plant breeding and biotechnology will assure a more consistent and predictable genetic progress. Current contributions of biotechnology have arrived for many crops in different places of the world. Varieties developed by transformation are grown in large acreage in some countries. Some concerns have also arisen from the use of GMOs. For example, the introgression of a gene for insect resistance 4 into many different species could result in an undesirable endemic risk, here called interespecific biotechnological vulnerability. Another concern is that biotechnology race may create yield plateaus in programs using <b>genes</b> <b>pyramiding</b> for all new traits made available by biotechnology, resulting in what is called genetic gridlock.

However, the improved cultivars carrying single resistance gene lose effectiveness due to the evolution of new biotypes (Jena and Kim 2010).

Because BS, BSR and BGR are common diseases that have been increased by global warming, the final goal is to pyramid QTLs for resistance into elite germplasm as a means of developing cultivars with resistance to all of these important diseases.|$|E
