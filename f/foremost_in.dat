5|$|In architecture, Filippo Brunelleschi was <b>foremost</b> <b>in</b> {{studying}} {{the remains of}} ancient classical buildings. With rediscovered knowledge from the 1st-century writer Vitruvius and the flourishing discipline of mathematics, Brunelleschi formulated the Renaissance style that emulated and improved on classical forms. His major feat of engineering was building {{the dome of the}} Florence Cathedral. Another building demonstrating this style is the church of St. Andrew in Mantua, built by Alberti. The outstanding architectural work of the High Renaissance was the rebuilding of St. Peter's Basilica, combining the skills of Bramante, Michelangelo, Raphael, Sangallo and Maderno.|$|E
5|$|Despite the warlike {{customs of}} the Vikings, {{there was an}} element of fear {{surrounding}} death and what belonged to it. If the deceased was a revenant or draugr, such a sight was frightful and ominous and usually it was interpreted {{as a sign that}} additional family members would die. It was first and <b>foremost</b> <b>in</b> times of starvation, when communities were struck with a series of misfortunes, that rumours about revenants began to flourish. The sagas tell of drastic precautions being taken after a revenant had appeared. The dead person had to die anew; a stake could be put through the corpse, or its head might be cut off in order to stop the deceased from finding its way back to the living.|$|E

5|$|As {{a direct}} result of {{watching}} his fellow martial artists train with a fixed-blade fighting knife in class, yet carry some type of a folding knife when they left the training area, Emerson decided there was a need for a sturdy folding knife designed primarily for combat. Although Emerson had always maintained that the knives he made were built as fighting knives first and <b>foremost,</b> <b>in</b> October 1985 he stripped down five of these designs to simpler materials. He continued his use of linen or canvas micarta because of its high tensile strength and superior gripping surface when wet; he decided on black or dark grey for the color instead of the brighter colors used previously. He retained the titanium for the liners and bolsters but chose to bead-blast them a flat grey matte color as opposed to the colorful anodizing which used to appear on his knives. The reasons for using titanium were its exceptional strength-to-weight ratio and corrosion resistance.|$|E
5|$|Jardine {{played a}} full season of cricket in 1931. In June, he was {{appointed}} as captain for the Test against New Zealand (two more Tests were later added). The English selectors were searching for possible captains for the 1932–33 tour of Australia, with Bradman and Australia's strong batting line up <b>foremost</b> <b>in</b> their minds. Christopher Douglas believes that, as Jardine was not a regular county captain, the selectors wanted to assess his leadership ability but had probably not settled on him as a final choice. He was also chosen as a dependable, proven batsman. While Percy Fender approved of his appointment, The Times correspondent believed that he was unproven and others were more deserving of the leadership. Ian Peebles, writing 40 years later, claimed that Jardine's appointment was popular but cricket administrators had misgivings. Alan Gibson believed that Jardine was chosen because the other candidates were either not worth {{their place in the}} side, too old or had controversy attached to them. Furthermore, Jardine impressed the chairman of selectors, Pelham Warner, who stated that he was very effective in selection meetings through his knowledge of cricket history and went into great detail to choose the correct players; it seems that Warner was the driving force behind Jardine's appointment.|$|E

25|$|The apostolic {{succession}} of the Church {{is considered to}} have remained intact through the proper ordination of bishop Mikael Agricola, but it was broken in 1884 when all the Finnish Lutheran bishops died within a year. The succession remained valid in the Church of Sweden from where it was returned in the 1930s by the ordination of the bishop of Tampere.

25|$|In {{any given}} All-Age Stake, {{it may be}} very {{difficult}} to place a dog which totally meets the exalted standard; therefore, out of necessity, there will frequently be a need to accept a dog whose qualities and character can only begin to approximate the standard.

Range is the “sine qua non” of an all-age dog and it should take precedence over and not be compromised for a short, practical, methodical, unexhilarated, uninspiring performance, no matter how immaculate the bird work of the latter.|$|E
25|$|Later, {{from the}} 9th to 13th centuries, the Mahayana Buddhist and Hindu Khmer Empire {{dominated}} vast {{parts of the}} Southeast Asian peninsula, and its influence was <b>foremost</b> <b>in</b> the development of Buddhist art in the region.

The royal patronage for Khmer Buddhist art reached its new height with the patronage of Jayavarman VII, a Buddhist king that built Angkor Thom walled city, adorned with the smiling face of Lokeshvara in Angkor Thom dvaras (gates) and prasat towers Bayon. Angkor {{was at the center}} of this development, with a Buddhist temple complex and urban organization able to support around 1million urban dwellers. A great deal of Cambodian Buddhist sculpture is preserved at Angkor; however, organized looting has had a heavy impact on many sites around the country.|$|E
