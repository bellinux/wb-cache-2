500|$|Reviewers {{also noted}} upon the album's versatility, {{specifically}} that of Taylor's vocal range and abilities. Jeff Modzelewski praised the opening track [...] "Get Inside" [...] explaining, [...] "the scorching speed-metal verse and screaming chorus are played off pretty well against the melodic pre-chorus". Jason D. Taylor cited [...] "Orchids" [...] and [...] "Take a Number" [...] as songs which stand {{out because they}} [...] "strike with surprising force for an alternative rock group". On a similar note, Don Kaye said the album includes some [...] "sinister, groove-oriented metal gems that refreshingly stay away from nu metal cliches". The most melodic track on the album, [...] "Bother", received specific attention from most reviewers. Modzelewski said that the track [...] "seems to be the song that the album <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>preparing</b> everyone for", further adding that Taylor proves [...] "that he is a legitimate vocalist who doesn't need to rely on destroying his vocal chords {{to make a good}} song". In his review, Rowan Shaeffer stated the track was a specific highlight, but said that the change in style was [...] "at odds {{with the rest of the}} material" [...] on the album.|$|E

When Khan discovers the British regiment knows of his plan, he orders his beautiful slave to seduce and then kidnap Lieutenant Stone, {{in an attempt to}} extract sensitive information about the ammunition caravan from him. When the colonel refuses to attempt his rescue, McGregor and Forsythe, appalled by the [...] "lack of concern" [...] the colonel has for his own son, leave the camp at night without orders. Disguised as common natives trying to sell blankets, they are recognized by the beautiful slave, who has met the two men before at a civil event, and are captured. During a seemingly friendly interrogation, Khan says [...] "we have ways of making men talk" [...] and proceeds to have the prisoners tortured; their nails are ripped off and the sensitive skin underneath is burned. While McGregor and Forsythe, despite the agonizing pain, refuse to speak, Stone cracks and reveals what he knows. As a result, the ammunition is captured.|$|E

Centuries of the most degrading and foreign priestcraft--enervating rites brought in by Hellogabalus and the Syrian emperors--have failed to destroy her. Dynasties! Why, even in our dark servitude we have seen Merovingian and Carlovingian kings, and Capets, and Valois, and Bourbons, and now Bonapartes. They have disappeared, and will disappear like Orgetorix and the dynasties of the time of Caesar. What we want is Rome free. Do not you see that everything <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>preparing</b> for that event? This monstrous masquerade of United Italy--what is it but an initiatory ceremony, to prove that Italy without Rome is a series of provinces? Establish the Roman republic, and the Roman race will, as before, conquer them in detail. And, when the Italians are thus really united, what will become of the Gauls? Why, the first Bonaparte said that if Italy were really united the Gauls would have no chance. And he was a good judge of such things." ...|$|E
60|$|Ay, if {{the worst}} should come; if neither {{the laws of}} your country nor the benevolence of the righteous were strong enough to defend you; if one {{charitable}} plan after another were to fail; if the labour-market were getting fuller and fuller, and poverty were spreading wider and wider, and crime and misery were breeding faster and still faster every year than education and religion; all hope for the poor seemed gone and lost, and {{they were ready to}} believe the men who tell them that the land is over-peopled--that there are too many of us, too many industrious hands, too many cunning brains, too many immortal souls, too many of God's children upon God's earth, which God the Father made, and God the Son redeemed, and God the Holy Spirit teaches: then the Lord, the Prince of sufferers, He who knows your every grief, and weeps with you tear for tear, He would come out of His place to smite the haughty ones, and confound the cunning ones, and silence the loud ones, and empty the full ones; to judge with righteousness for the meek of the earth, to hearken to the prayer of the poor, whose heart he <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>preparing,</b> and to help the fatherless and needy to their right, that the man of the world may be no more exalted against them.|$|E

6000|$|For centuries {{the world}} <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>preparing</b> {{for the coming}} of the common man. And the period of {{preparation}} virtually past, labor, conscious of itself and its desires, has begun a definite movement toward solidarity. It believes the time is not far distant when the historian will speak not only of the dark ages of feudalism, but of the dark ages of capitalism. And labor sincerely believes itself justified in this by the terrible indictment it brings against capitalistic society. In the face of its enormous wealth, capitalistic society forfeits its right to existence when it permits widespread, bestial poverty. The philosophy of the survival of the fittest does not soothe the class-conscious worker when he learns through his class literature that among the Italian pants-finishers of Chicago {9} the average weekly wage is $1.31, and the average number of weeks employed in the year is 27.85. Likewise when he reads: {10} [...] "Every room in these reeking tenements houses a family or two. In one room a missionary found a man ill with small-pox, his wife just recovering from her confinement, and the children running about half naked and covered with dirt. Here are seven people living in one underground kitchen, and a little dead child lying in the same room. Here live a widow and her six children, two of whom are ill with scarlet fever. In another, nine brothers and sisters, from twenty-nine years of age downward, live, eat, and sleep together." [...] And likewise, when he reads: {11} [...] "When one man, fifty years old, who has worked all his life, is compelled to beg a little money to bury his dead baby, and another man, fifty years old, can give ten million dollars to enable his daughter to live in luxury and bolster up a decaying foreign aristocracy, do you see nothing amiss?" ...|$|E
6000|$|I shall now {{mention a}} {{particular}} wherein {{your whole body}} will be certainly against me, and the laity almost to a man on my side. However it came about, I cannot get over the prejudice of taking some little offence at the clergy for perpetually reading their sermons[6]; perhaps my frequent hearing of foreigners, who never made use of notes, may have added to my disgust. And I cannot but think, that whatever is read, differs as much from what is repeated without book, as a copy does from an original. At the same time, I am highly sensible what an extreme difficulty it would be upon you to alter this method, and that, in such a case, your sermons would be much less valuable than they are, for want of time to improve and correct them. I would therefore gladly come to a compromise with you in this matter. I knew a clergyman of some distinction, who appeared to deliver his sermon without looking into his notes, which when I complimented him upon, he assured me he could not repeat six lines; but his method was to write the whole sermon in a large plain hand, with all the forms of margin, paragraph, marked page, and the like; then on Sunday morning he took care to run it over five or six times, which he could do in an hour; and when he deliver'd it, by pretending to turn his face {{from one side to}} the other, he would (in his own expression) pick up the lines, and cheat his people by making them believe he had it all by heart. He farther added, that whenever he happened by neglect to omit any of these circumstances, the vogue of the parish was, [...] "Our doctor gave us but an indifferent sermon to-day." [...] Now among us, many clergymen act too directly contrary to this method, that from a habit of saving time and paper, which they acquired at the University, they write in so diminutive a manner, with such frequent blots and interlineations, that they are hardly able to go on without perpetual hesitations or extemporary expletives: And I desire to know what can be more inexcusable, than to see a divine and a scholar, at a loss in reading his own compositions, which it is supposed he <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>preparing</b> with much pains and thought for the instruction of his people? The want of a little more care in this article, is the cause of much ungraceful behaviour. You will observe some clergymen with their heads held down from the beginning to the end, within an inch of the cushion, to read what is hardly legible; which, besides the untoward manner, hinders them from making the best advantage of their voice: others again have a trick of popping up and down every moment from their paper to the audience, like an idle school-boy on a repetition day.|$|E
