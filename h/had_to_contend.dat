5|$|The Ottomans faced {{numerous}} opponents between 1424 and 1453. Tied down by {{the siege}} of Thessalonika, the Ottomans <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>contend</b> with the Serbs under George Brankovic, the Hungarians under John Hunyadi and the Albanians under George Kastrioti Skanderbeg. This resistance culminated into the Crusade of Varna of 1444, which, despite much local support and deception - a peace treaty was unilaterally revoked by the Hungarians - was defeated.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{also pointed}} out that the index could allow the city to reach lethally high levels of carbon {{monoxide}} without any alert if the levels of other pollutants remained low. However, the department <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>contend</b> with the fact that no universally accepted standards for recording smog existed at that time, and many of the flaws existed {{for lack of a better}} alternative. During the 1966 smog, one of the former commissioners said he would have readily adopted a better system, if one existed.|$|E

5|$|In September 1944, Nowotny {{was made}} {{commander}} of a specialist unit dubbed Kommando Nowotny, flying the newly developed Messerschmitt Me 262 out of airfields near Osnabrück. The unit not only <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>contend</b> with the enemy, {{but also with}} working through the 'teething' phase of the Me 262and developing the tactics appropriate for a jet unit. On 7 October, Nowotny downed a B-24 Liberator bomber, his first aerial victory on the Western Front.|$|E

In addition, he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>contend</b> with a number of obstacles: he had no {{administrative}} experience or training, local Orthodox rabbis (particularly Joshua Seigel) and Jews outside his congregation did not accept his authority, and non-Orthodox Jews and groups criticized him. These problems were exacerbated by a stroke suffered in 1895, which partially incapacitated him, followed by a relapse in 1900 which left him bedridden.|$|E

5|$|The canal <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>contend</b> with initial {{opposition}} from the carters, who used force to prevent coal being taken from the pits to the loading points. However, the canal provided a greatly superior method of transporting coal and was an immediate success. In 1782 it earned 114,000 livres. The Compagnie du canal de Givors was established in December 1788 to take over operations. In letters-patent of December 1788, registered on 5 September 1789, the concession was declared to be permanent.|$|E
5|$|After the Battle of Fort Sumter, Lincoln {{realized}} {{the importance of}} taking immediate executive control {{of the war and}} making an overall Union military strategy to put down the rebellion. Lincoln encountered an unprecedented political and military crisis, and he responded as commander-in-chief, using unprecedented powers. He expanded his war powers, and imposed a blockade on all the Confederate shipping ports, disbursed funds before appropriation by Congress, and after suspending habeas corpus, arrested and imprisoned thousands of suspected Confederate sympathizers. Lincoln was supported by Congress and the northern public for these actions. In addition, Lincoln <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>contend</b> with reinforcing strong Union sympathies in the border slave states and keeping the war from becoming an international conflict.|$|E
5|$|As CAS, Williams <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>contend</b> {{with serious}} {{challenges}} to the RAAF's continued existence from the Army and Navy in 1929 and 1932, arising from the competing demands for defence funding during the Great Depression. According to Williams, only after 1932 was {{the independence of the}} Air Force assured. Williams again handed over the reins of CAS to Goble in 1933 to attend the Imperial Defence College in London, resuming his position in June 1934. His promotion to air vice marshal on 1January 1935 belatedly raised him to the equivalent rank of his fellow Chiefs of Staff in the Army and Navy. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in June that year.|$|E

5|$|In {{earliest}} recorded history, Norway {{was divided}} {{into a number of}} small and sometimes warring petty kingdoms with weak central authority. In traditional historiography the rise of Harald Fairhair in the 9th century started the process of unification of the country and the consolidation of royal power. Harald's descendants, and other claimants to the throne, <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>contend</b> with strong regional leaders such as the Jarls of Lade in the north and the rulers of Vingulmark in the east, while the kings of Denmark claimed regions in the south and were eager to acquire Norwegian vassals to increase their influence. The spread of Christianity also became an increasingly important political issue in the late 10th century.|$|E
5|$|New {{economic}} forces also changed the Commonwealth. Virginian James Albert Bonsack invented the tobacco cigarette rolling machine in 1880 leading to new {{industrial scale production}} centered on Richmond. In 1886, railroad magnate Collis Potter Huntington founded Newport News Shipbuilding, which was responsible for building six major World War I-era battleships for the U.S. Navy from 1907 to 1923. During the war, German submarines like U-151 attacked ships outside the port. In 1926, Dr. W.A.R. Goodwin, rector of Williamsburg's Bruton Parish Church, began restoration of colonial-era buildings in the historic district with financial backing of John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Though their project, like others in the state, <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>contend</b> with the Great Depression and World War II, work continued as Colonial Williamsburg became a major tourist attraction.|$|E

The duo was led by long-time Jim Cornette nemesis Paul E. Dangerously, in a storyline that saw them trying to prove the originals were better than the new version. The surprise appearance of the Original Midnight Express gave Dangerously's team the initial momentum in the feud, but soon after, Condrey left the promotion once more. This forced the bookers to bring in Jack Victory as a replacement as Condrey's disappearance cut the promising feud short.|$|E

The first shows were riddled with difficulty, starting {{with the collapse of the}} big top after the increased weight of rainwater caused the central mast to snap. Working with a borrowed tent, Laliberté then <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>contend</b> with difficulties with the European performers.

5|$|The Kaiserliche Marine {{considered}} {{sending the}} two ships to attack convoys in the Atlantic Ocean, but the difficulties associated with refueling at sea convinced the Germans {{to abandon the}} plan. Bremse {{was one of the}} ships interned at Scapa Flow {{under the terms of the}} armistice in November 1918. On 21 June 1919, the commander of the interned fleet, Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, ordered the scuttling of the fleet. She was salvaged in 1929 by teams working for Ernest Cox, though they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>contend</b> with large quantities of oil and the risks of fires and explosions. Having been brought back to the surface after a decade underwater, she was then scrapped.|$|E
5|$|The men at {{the front}} had to {{struggle}} with supply problems–there was a shortage of food; and disease was rife in the damp, rat-infested conditions. Along with enemy action, many soldiers <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>contend</b> with new diseases: trench foot, trench fever and trench nephritis. When the war ended in November 1918, British Army casualties, {{as the result of}} enemy action and disease, were recorded as 673,375 killed and missing, with another 1,643,469 wounded. The rush to demobilise {{at the end of the}} conflict substantially decreased the strength of the British Army, from its peak strength of 4,000,000 men in 1918 to 370,000 men by 1920.|$|E

5|$|Cranor spent $42 million {{restructuring}} the company's operations worldwide. He invested an additional $50 million to refurbish outlets and $20 {{million on a}} new computer system to link outlet cash registers to the kitchen, drive-through window, manager's office and company headquarters. Cranor also expanded the chain into non-traditional locations, beginning with a 150 sq ft limited menu kiosk at a General Motors assembly plant in Dayton, Ohio. Between 1986 and 1991, the chain built a further 2,000 outlets to bring its total number to 8,500, and sales grew from $3.5 to $6.2 billion. The chain <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>contend</b> {{with the rise of}} grilled chicken as Americans became increasingly health conscious. KFC found itself competing against the growing El Pollo Loco restaurant chain, as well as with Burger King, which had just introduced the BK Broiler, a grilled chicken burger. Delays in product development, cramped kitchens and the ongoing franchisee contract dispute prevented the chain from rolling out a grilled product of its own.|$|E
5|$|Lodge later {{claimed the}} South Vietnamese {{prosecutors}} {{failed to make}} any case against Cẩn. The Vietnamese leader also <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>contend</b> with {{the other side of}} the arguments, from those who considered themselves to be victims of the Diệm regime. During the trial, Thích Trí Quang, along with other opponents of the old regime, lobbied for a death sentence for Cẩn. He argued that if Cẩn lived, he could regain power along with his late brothers' supporters. He told Lodge that if the Americans did not support a tough sentence, then the Vietnamese Buddhist community's opinion of Washington would fall. Lodge was initially critical of Quang's campaigning against Cẩn. Cẩn was sentenced to death. He appealed to the head of state for clemency; his lawyers used a provision in the legal code to make the appeal. This placed Minh — who was still the titular head of state — in the position of approving a third death in the Ngô family, having already ordered his bodyguard Nguyễn Văn Nhung to execute Diệm and Nhu during the coup.|$|E

The 1st Battalion, Royal Ulster Rifles, unable to outflank the position, were ordered to dig in. The next day, the battalion was relieved by the Belgians {{and moved to a}} brigade concentration point, first at Le Plein and then at Troan, which they reached by the morning of 21August. The 6th Airlanding Brigade advance continued from here with the 12th Battalion, Devonshire Regiment in the lead. The battalion was unopposed until that afternoon, when they had several casualties from German mortar and machine-gun fire. With night approaching the battalion had to dig in, and prepared to continue the advance the next day. At 03:00 on 22August, the battalion started an outflanking attack on Branville, which they occupied by 08:00, and later the same day they liberated Vauville and Deauville, where they secured the high ground {{to the north of the}} town.|$|E
