40|$|This article {{critically}} {{examines the}} functioning of <b>European</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>networks</b> as one modality of transnational dialogues between judges. In order to provide a conceptual framework, we first explore {{the meaning of the}} concepts of 'network', 'dialogue' and 'constitutional pluralism' and find that existing channels of communication between national courts and the CJEU hardly qualify as real dialogues. Then follows an in-depth examination of the practical workings of a number of well-established and active <b>European</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>networks,</b> which bring together judges who are more or less at the same level in their domestic judicial hierarchy and have similar functions in their respective legal systems. This involves determining who participates in judicial networks; how and to what end dialogues are conducted within these forums; and why judges may be motivated to participate in such networks. Using these insights, we argue that networks require a change in legal thinking, which is facilitated in the EU context by the constitutionalism pluralism discourse. Further, <b>judicial</b> <b>networks</b> have the potential to increase the dialogic qualities {{of the relationship between the}} CJEU and national courts, while they may at the same time affect the balance within that relationship in favour of the national courts...|$|R

40|$|While {{scholarly}} {{writing has}} dealt {{with the role of}} law in the process of European integration, so far it has shed little light on the lawyers and communities of lawyers involved in that process. Law {{has been one of the}} most thoroughly investigated aspects of the European integration process, and EU law has become a well-established academic discipline, with the emergence more recently of an impressive body of legal and political science literature on 'European law in context'. Yet, this field has been dominated by an essentially judicial narrative, focused on the role of the European courts, underestimating in the process the multifaceted roles lawyers and law play in the EU polity, notably the roles they play beyond the litigation arena. This book promotes a deeper understanding of European law as a social and political phenomenon, presenting a more complete view of the European legal field by looking beyond the courts, and at the same time broadening the scholarly horizon by exploring the ways in which European law is actually made. To do this, the book describes the roles of the great variety of actors who stand behind legal norms and decisions, bringing together perspectives from various disciplines - law, political science, political sociology, and history - to offer a global multi-disciplinary reassessment of the role of 'law' and 'lawyers' in the European integration process.

40|$|This project uses a mixed methods {{approach}} {{to analyze the}} communication of metaphors about educational equity and adequacy, between co-equal state supreme courts in education finance litigation (1971 -present). Evidence demonstrates {{that a number of}} pervasive metaphors about students and educational opportunities (“sound basic education,” “marketplace of ideas,” students as “competitors in the global economy”) have been shared and conventionalized within <b>judicial</b> <b>networks,</b> with significant implications for how courts interpret educational rights under state constitutions. The project first conducts a qualitative discourse analysis of education finance litigation in New York State (four cases) using Pragglejaz Group’s (2007) Metaphor Identification Procedure, to identify micro-level examples of metaphor usage in actual judicial discourse. Then, it performs quantitative and qualitative social network analysis of the entire education finance <b>judicial</b> <b>network</b> for state supreme courts (65 cases), to analyze two different “relations” between this set of actors: shared citation (formal relation) and shared metaphor (informal relation). Data analysis shows that there exist both formal and informal channels of judicial communication—communication we can “see,” and communication we can’t—and commonalities in discursive strategies (informal ties) are, in some ways, potentially more cohesive than direct, formal ties. The project also finds that courts looking to break with existing state precedent are more likely to turn to inter-court metaphors to validate their holdings. This project seeks to describe how metaphors become diffuse within <b>judicial</b> <b>networks,</b> and more generally seeks to enhance understanding {{of the ways in which}} political viewpoints on public benefits and rights are communicated through elite channels...|$|R
