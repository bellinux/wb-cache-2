Using this idea, we develop a Contextual Multi-Level Access Control Model based on Description Logic with Default and Exception named DL−CMLACδ. To give a formal {{representation}} of this model, we define a non monotonic description logic based system by which we can deal with default and exceptional language called JClassic+δ. It is an extension of JClassicδ in order to introduce disjunction of concepts. JClassic+δ is expressive enough to be of pratical use, it can handle a ”weakened kind of disjunction ” with the connective lcs allowing a tractable subsumption computation. The connective lcs has the same properties as the LCS external operation to compute the least common subsumer of two concepts.

Not only are spaces more and more equipped with stationary computers or notebooks, {{but more and more}} users carry mobile devices with them (smart-phones, personal digital assistants, etc.). Ubiquitous computing aims at creating smart environments where devices are dynamically linked in order to provide new services to users and new human-machine interaction possibilities. The most profound technologies are those that disappear. They weave themselves into the fabric of everyday life until they are indistinguishable from it (Weiser, 1991). This network of devices must perceive the context in order to understand and anticipate the user's needs. Devices should be able to execute actions that help the user to fulfill his goal or that simply accommodate him. Actions depend on the user's context and, in particular, on the situation within the context. The objective of this work is to construct automatically a context model by applying reinforcement learning techniques. Rewards are given by the user when expressing his degree of satisfaction towards actions proposed by the system. A <b>default</b> <b>context</b> model is used from the beginning {{in order to have a}} consistent initial behavior.

40|$|Artists {{who work}} in {{two-dimensional}} visual media regularly face {{the problem of how}} to compose their subjects in aesthetically pleasing ways within a surrounding rectangular frame. We performed psychophysical investigations of viewers' aesthetic preferences for the position and facing direction of single, directed objects (e. g., people, cars, animals, teapots, and flowers) within such rectangular frames and examined the role that meaning and context play in some of these preferences. 	For the horizontal placement of objects, preferences were measured using two-alternative forced-choice preference judgments, the method of adjustment, free choice in taking photographs, and an analysis of stock photography. In front-facing conditions, preference was greatest for pictures whose subject was located at or near the center of the frame and decreased monotonically and symmetrically with distance from the center (the center bias). In the left- or right-facing conditions, there was an additional bias toward preferring objects that face into rather than out of the frame (the inward bias). Similar biases were evident using a method of adjustment, in which participants positioned objects along a horizontal axis, and in free choice photographs, in which participants were asked to take "the most aesthetically pleasing picture" they could of everyday objects. The results are discussed as affirming the power of the center and facing direction in the aesthetic biases viewers bring to their appreciation of framed works of visual art (e. g., Arnheim, 1988; Alexander, 2002). 	Next, aesthetic preference for the vertical composition of single-object pictures was studied through a series of four two-alternative forced-choice experiments. The results reveal the influence of several factors, including spatial asymmetries in the affordances of the object and the typical position of the object relative to the observer. With asymmetric side views of objects, people generally prefer objects typically below the observer's viewpoint (e. g., a bowl and a swimming stingray) to be located below the center of the frame and objects located above the observer's viewpoint (e. g., a light fixture and a flying eagle) to be located above the center of the frame. In addition, people generally prefer symmetric views of those same objects from directly above or directly below to be closer to the center of the frame. We suggest that these results can be unified by the hypothesis that observers prefer the object's "affordance space" to be centered within the frame. 	Finally, four experiments examined the role of contextual meaning (through titles) on preference for images with objects at different positions and perspectives. As predicted by a theoretical account in terms of "representational fit," people prefer standard (default) compositions with a neutral title that merely describes the content of the picture, but prefer non-standard compositions when they "fit" a title that has corresponding spatial implications. Thus, there is greater aesthetic value in novel compositions that violate expectations if the outcome is meaningful and coherent. These results support representational fit as an aesthetic theory that unifies fluency accounts, in which the <b>default</b> <b>context</b> prevails (e. g., Reber, Schwarz, & Winkielman, 2004), with classic aesthetic accounts in terms of novelty and expectation violation, in which a nonstandard meaning is intended or inferred...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Representation {{of context}} {{dependent}} {{knowledge in the}} Semantic Web has been recognized as a relevant issue: as a consequence, a number of logic based formalisms have been proposed in this regard. In response to this need, in previous works, we presented the description logic-based Contextualized Knowl-edge Repository (CKR) framework. Starting from this point, the first contribution of the paper {{is an extension of}} CKR with the possibility to represent <b>defaults</b> in <b>context</b> dependent axioms and a translation of extended CKRs to datalog pro-grams with negation under answer sets semantics. The translation generates dat-alog programs which are sound and complete w. r. t. instance checking in CKRs. Exploiting this result, we have developed as a second contribution a prototype implementation that compiles a CKR based on OWL 2 RL to a datalog program. Finally, we compare our approach with major non-monotonic formalisms for de-scription logics and contextual knowledge representation. ...|$|R

40|$|A key {{component}} of effective multi-agent systems (MAS) software development {{is a set of}} models, technologies and tools that efficiently support flexible and precise specification and implementation of agent-to-agent conversations, standardized conversation protocols, and corresponding agent behaviors. This motivated a substantial extension to the JADE agent behavior model, which we call &quot;HP SmartAgent. &quot; Previous experience with the ZEUS and JADE agent toolkits highlighted the need for more flexibility and precision in programming agent behavior and managing conversations. For example, the JADE infrastructure routes ACL messages in round-robin fashion to interested behavior “threads, ” making it hard to control ordering; reuse of behavior subclasses is difficult; and, support for default and exceptional behavior is inadequate. SmartAgent extends JADE behaviors with uniform message and system events, a multi-level tree of dispatchers that match and route events, and a hierarchical state machine that is based on the UML statechart model. Adherence to the UML helps bridge object-oriented to agent-oriented programming using an industry familiar modeling language and tools. Combining events, dispatcher tree and hierarchical state machines simplifies programming of <b>default</b> and <b>context</b> dependent behavior. This hypothesis was confirmed in a meeting scheduler prototype where code previously written using pure JADE was refactored using SmartAgent...|$|R
40|$|Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 s disease (AD), {{the most}} common cause of dementia, is thought to be a {{progressive}} neurodegenerative disease that is clinically characterised by a decline of memory and other cognitive functions. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is considered to be the prodromal stage of AD. However, the relationship between AD and MCI and the development process remains unclear. The amygdala is one of the most vulnerable structures in the early stages of AD. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the alteration of the functional connectivity of the amygdala in AD and MCI subjects. We hypothesised that the amygdala-cortical loop is impaired in AD and that these alterations relate to the disease severity. In our study, we used resting-state functional MRIs to investigate the altered amygdala connectivity patterns in 35 AD patients, 27 MCI patients and 27 age- and gender-matched normal controls (NC). Compared with the NC, the decreased functional connectivity found in the AD patients was mainly located between the amygdala and the regions that are included in the <b>default</b> mode, <b>context</b> conditioning and extinction networks.

40|$|Abstract. Assertion {{checking}} is {{the restriction}} of program verification to validity of program assertions. It encompasses safety checking, which is program verification of safety properties, like memory safety {{or absence of}} overflows. In this paper, we consider assertion checking of program parts instead of whole programs, which we call modular assertion checking. Classically, modular assertion checking is possible only if {{the context in which}} a program part is executed is known. By <b>default,</b> the worst-case <b>context</b> must be assumed, which may impair the verification task. It usually takes user effort to detail enough the execution context for the verification task to succeed, by providing strong enough preconditions. We propose a method to automatically infer sufficient preconditions in the context of interpretation, weakest precondition calculus and quantifier elimination. We instantiate this method to prove memory safety for C and Java programs, under some memory separation conditions. ...|$|R

From the solution of the household optimization problem, we derive an augmented Euler equation for consumption, which is a function inter alia of an expected default factor. We use this equation to calculate in a static equilibrium the optimal value of the percentage of debt repaid.
