40|$|We analyze how Proposition 209 {{changed the}} {{percentage}} of matriculating students who are African American or Latino at each public, private non-profit and proprietary <b>four-year</b> and two-year <b>college</b> {{in the state of}} California.

The Detroit Pistons won the coin flip and were awarded the first overall pick, while the San Diego Rockets were awarded the second pick. The remaining first-round picks and the subsequent rounds were assigned to teams in reverse order of their win–loss record in the previous season. Three expansion franchises, the Buffalo Braves, the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Portland Trail Blazers, took part in the NBA Draft {{for the first time and}} were assigned the seventh, the eighth and the ninth pick in each round.
