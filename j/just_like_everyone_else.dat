5|$|Aoyama collapses {{from the}} drug. Asami injects {{him with a}} paralytic agent that leaves his nerves alert, and tortures him with needles. She tells him that <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>else</b> in her life, he has failed to love only her. She cannot {{tolerate}} his feelings for anyone else, even his own son. She inserts needles into his eyes, giggling as she does so. She then cuts off his left foot with piano wire. Shigehiko returns home as Asami begins to cut off Aoyama's other foot, and she chases him upstairs. As she attacks the boy, Aoyama appears to suddenly wake up back in the hotel after he and Asami had sex, and his current ordeal seems {{to be only a}} nightmare; Aoyama proposes marriage and Asami accepts. As he falls back asleep in the hotel, he returns to find his son fighting back Asami, who is brandishing mace. Shigehiko kicks her downstairs, breaking her neck. Aoyama tells his son to call the police and stares at the dying Asami, who repeats what she said on one of their dates about her excitement on seeing him again.|$|E

500|$|Ryan White {{was seen}} by some as an [...] "innocent victim" [...] of the AIDS epidemic. Ryan White and his family {{strongly}} rejected the language of [...] "innocent victim" [...] because the phrase was often used to imply that gays with AIDS were [...] "guilty". Ryan's mother told The New York Times, Ryan always said, 'I'm <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>else</b> with AIDS, no matter how I got it.' And {{he would never have}} lived as long as he did without the gay community. The people we knew in New York made sure we knew about the latest treatments way before we would have known in Indiana. I hear mothers today say they're not gonna work with no gay community on anything. Well, if it comes to your son's life, you better start changing your heart and your attitude around.|$|E

500|$|At 4:30pm Pacific Time, Nixon, Chotiner, and Rogers were {{discussing}} where {{the public should}} be told to send their responses to the speech, when a Dewey aide telephoned for Nixon. Reluctantly, suspecting {{the reason for the}} call, Chotiner brought Nixon to the phone to speak with the New York governor. Dewey told Nixon that Eisenhower's aides were unanimous that Nixon must resign, though Dewey did not agree, and that Nixon was to so state {{at the end of his}} telecast. Nixon asked what the general wanted him to do. Dewey hedged, stating that he had not spoken with the presidential candidate himself, but that the word had come from such close aides to Eisenhower that the demand had to represent the general's view. The candidate replied that it was very late for him to change his remarks; Dewey assured him he need not do so, but simply add at the end his resignation from the ticket and his insistence that Eisenhower accept it. The governor suggested he even announce his resignation from the Senate and his intent to run in the special election which would follow—the two-time losing presidential candidate was sure Nixon would be returned with a huge majority, thus vindicating him. Nixon remained silent for some time, and when Dewey asked him what he would do, the senator told him that he did not know, and if Eisenhower's aides wanted to find out, they could watch <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>else.</b> Before slamming down the receiver, Nixon added, [...] "And tell them I know something about politics, too!" ...|$|E
500|$|According to {{a survey}} {{conducted}} in June 2013 by the All-Russian Center for the Study of Public Opinion (also known as VTsIOM), at least 90 percent of Russians surveyed were in favour of the law. Over 100 conservative groups worldwide signed a petition in support for the law, with Larry Jacobs, manager of the World Congress of Families, supporting its aim to [...] "prohibit advocacy aimed at involving minors in a lifestyle that would imperil their physical and moral health." [...] President of Russia Vladimir Putin answered to early objections to the then-proposed bill in April 2013 by stating that [...] "I want everyone to understand that in Russia there are no infringements on sexual minorities' rights. They're people, <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>else,</b> and they enjoy full rights and freedoms". He {{went on to say}} that he fully intended to sign the bill because the Russian people demanded it. As he put it, [...] "Can you imagine an organization promoting pedophilia in Russia? I think people in many Russian regions would have started to take up arms.... The same is true for sexual minorities: I can hardly imagine same-sex marriages being allowed in Chechnya. Can you imagine it? It would have resulted in human casualties." [...] Putin also mentioned that he was concerned about Russia's low birth rate, as same-sex relationships do not produce children. In August 2013, Russian Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko also defended the law, equating it to protecting children from content that glorifies alcohol abuse or drug addiction. He also argued that the controversy over the law and its effects was [...] "invented" [...] by the Western media.|$|E

5000|$|The {{episode was}} {{generally}} well received among television critics. Steve Marsi of TV Fanatic called Yang being on pediatrics [...] "an epic fail", but praised the humor given by Oh. He also called Lexie's storyline [...] "endearing and sad to watch", writing that overall, the episode was [...] "classic Grey's Anatomy". PopSugar gave a positive {{review of the}} episode, writing: [...] "Derek and Mark {{seem to be the}} only ones who are keeping their cool." [...] However, they also felt that Meredith was [...] "out of chararacter", commenting: [...] "Though Meredith also kept it together, her optimism is so out of character that it can only be chalked up to the crisis, and even she recognizes it." [...] While Yang was on pediatric service, she impersonated a bear, and PopSugar called her voice [...] "priceless". They were also positive about Stevens' storyline, saying: [...] "At first it seemed super annoying but was pretty sweet {{by the end of the}} episode." [...] PopSugar also enjoyed Lexie's storyline, commenting that [...] "she proves her worth in the end". [...] "Watching her get attacked by the schizophrenic patient, going crazy around the hospital, and dealing with the repercussions were humorous and emotionally connective. She knew exactly how to deal with the patients' Alien-thoughts with the scans and solved the mother's hesitation, as well. She shouldn't be worried about the merger because she's a good doctor.

40|$|Purpose: To {{discuss the}} most {{fundamental}} Japanese value, Wa (harmony), {{and its implications for}} nursing ethics in Japan. Background: Much {{has been written about the}} confusion of value orientations among Japanese nurses whose professional socialization is heavily influenced by Western culture and whose personal and clinical life depends on traditional Japanese culture. This literature also urges clarification of the values that constitute the deep structure of Japan's ethnic collective unconscious in order to clarify the differences between Western and Japanese cultures. Methods: The concept Wa was analyzed from a literature review. The authors' research data were then used to explore the Japanese nurses' perceptions of this concept as reflected in their everyday practice. Results & Discussion: The concept Wa, originating from Confucianism, means people working in harmony and politeness in a group, with full appreciation of the uniqueness of its members, to reach the goal: goodness, peace and growth of all the members involved. Confucianism emphasizes not to confuse Wa and Doh (conformity with superficial agreement). Doh means you conform and do not express ideas but <b>just</b> act <b>like</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>else</b> so as not to rock the boat. Some Japanese nurses confused Wa and Doh and replaced Wa with Doh in their work lives. In this meaning the slogan 'workplace harmony' threatened those nurses' professional decision making. Some other nurses used Wa in its original Confucian meaning in discussions with the physician whose order had been perceived by the nurse as harmful for the patient, or with the mother who had refused to tell the truth to her terminally ill daughter. The outcome was the patient's benefit while at the same time keeping peaceful and harmonious relationship among the people involved. Those nurses' characteristics included calmness, modesty, warmth, politeness and assertiveness. Their actions were better explained by the concept Wa rather than the Western notion of nursing advocacy where courage is emphasized as the virtue of the nurse. It is important to have a culturally clear definition of Wa and an understanding of how it can be used for teaching nursing ethics in Japan. The need for further research was suggested to clarify other values residing in the Japanese nurses' conduct. School of Nursin...|$|R

[...] Even though they took the military oath and were among the lower ranks it did not mean they would be fighting among the masses. [...] These doctors were not always professionals or career physicians. [...] Oftentimes they were slaves who were forced into that career. [...] The Medici was also a group that treated wounded soldiers on the battlefield. [...] These men were not trained physicians even though they played the role of one. [...] Typically they were soldiers who demonstrated they had knowledge in wound treatment and even simple surgical techniques. [...] These men were used before the actual trained doctors were largely implemented. [...] Physicians got their knowledge from experience and information being passed down from person to person. [...] Likely they never used medical texts, as it was not common place even in the civilian field. [...] Generals and Emperors were exceptions, as they would typically have their own personal physician with them. [...] This was a common occurrence as Emperors such as Julian employed famous physicians such as Galen. [...] There were also physicians among the ranks of the Roman soldiers.|$|E
