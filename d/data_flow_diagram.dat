40|$|It {{has been}} shown in [SB 96] that a {{particular}} subclass of Formalized <b>Data</b> <b>Flow</b> <b>Diagrams</b> (FDFD's) is Turing equivalent. We call this Turing equivalent subclass of FDFD's persistent flow [...] free Reduced <b>Data</b> <b>Flow</b> <b>Diagrams</b> (PFF [...] RDFD's). PFF [...] RDFD's do not contain persistent flows, reference only values whose types have finite domains, and have enabling conditions that contain no tests for empty flows. In addition, FDFD's do not contain (direct) representations of stores. This raises the question whether any of these common features of traditional <b>Data</b> <b>Flow</b> <b>Diagrams</b> elevates the expressive power of FDFD's, or whether the various subclasses have the same expressive power as FDFD's with these features. This paper addresses this issue of whether persistent flows, arbitrary domains, tests for empty flows or stores are essential features with respect to the expressive power of Formalized <b>Data</b> <b>Flow</b> <b>Diagrams.</b> 2 1. 1 Introduction Traditional <b>Data</b> <b>Flow</b> <b>Diagrams</b> (DFD's) are probably the most widely [...] ...|$|R

We discuss how to extend the transformation to also cover dynamic <b>data</b> <b>flow</b> <b>diagrams</b> where the number of tokens produced and consumed by blocks is variable. Our method allows widespread tools such as Simulink {{which are based on}} the synchronous block diagram model to be used for <b>data</b> <b>flow</b> <b>diagrams</b> as well. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—System {{development}} {{life cycle}} (SDLC) {{is a process}} uses during the development of any system. SDLC consists of four main phases: analysis, design, implement and testing. During analysis phase, context <b>diagram</b> and <b>data</b> <b>flow</b> <b>diagrams</b> are used to produce the process model of a system. A consistency of the context <b>diagram</b> to lower-level <b>data</b> <b>flow</b> <b>diagrams</b> {{is very important in}} smoothing up developing process of a system. However, manual consistency check from context <b>diagram</b> to lower-level <b>data</b> <b>flow</b> <b>diagrams</b> by using a checklist is time-consuming process. At the same time, the limitation of human ability to validate the errors is one of the factors that influence the correctness and balancing of the diagrams. This paper presents a tool that automates the consistency check between <b>Data</b> <b>Flow</b> <b>Diagrams</b> (DFDs) based on the rules of DFDs. The tool serves two purposes: as an editor to draw the diagrams and as a checker to check the correctness of the diagrams drawn. The consistency check from context <b>diagram</b> to lower-level <b>data</b> <b>flow</b> <b>diagrams</b> is embedded inside the tool to overcome the manual checking problem...|$|R
5000|$|A <b>data</b> <b>flow</b> <b>diagram</b> (DFD) is a {{graphical}} {{representation of the}} [...] "flow" [...] of data through an information system.
