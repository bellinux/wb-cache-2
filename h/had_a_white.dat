5|$|In 1955, the {{inhabitants}} of the French-administered Saar Protectorate voted to join West Germany. Since its establishment as a separate French protectorate in 1947, the Saar <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> Nordic cross on a blue and red background as its flag. To demonstrate the commitment of the Saar {{to be a part of}} West Germany, a new flag was selected on 9 July 1956: the black-red-gold tricolour defaced with the new coat of arms, also proposed on this day. This flag came into force on 1 January 1957, upon the establishment of the Saarland as a state of West Germany.|$|E
5|$|It <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>White</b> 160AX 147horsepower (110kW), 386cubic inch (6,330cc), 6-cylinder engine with a {{compression}} ratio of 6.44:1. It had a 150-mile (240km) range, 60US gal (230l) fuel tank, {{a speed of}} 47mph (75km/h), and a {{power to weight ratio}} of 14.7hp per ton. It was armed with one 75mm M1897A5 with 59 rounds, had 0.25–0.625in (6.4–15.9mm) of armor, and a crew of five consisting of a commander, gunner, two loaders, and a driver. The M3 (with the M2A3 mount) could traverse 19° left and 21° right, elevate 29° and depress −10°. The M3A1 (using the M5 mount) could traverse 21° in both directions, but could only depress −6.5°.|$|E
5|$|Modesty, Tubman's {{maternal}} grandmother, {{arrived in}} the United States on a slave ship from Africa; no information is available about her other ancestors. As a child, Tubman was told that she was of Ashanti lineage (from what is now Ghana), though no evidence exists to confirm or deny this assertion. Her mother Rit (who may have <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> father) was a cook for the Brodess family. Her father Ben was a skilled woodsman who managed the timber work on Thompson's plantation. They married around 1808 and, according to court records, they had nine children together: Linah, Mariah Ritty, Soph, Robert, Minty (Harriet), Ben, Rachel, Henry, and Moses.|$|E

5|$|The central nave is groin-vaulted, each bay being {{separated}} {{from one another}} by pointed transverse arches with rectangular profiles. The nave arcades are carried on cruciform piers with an engaged column on each face, sitting on a raised plinth. The two aisles of the mosque are also groin-vaulted. Ibn Battuta noted that the Great Mosque <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> marble minbar ("pulpit"); it still exists today. There is a small mihrab in the mosque with an inscription dating from 1663, containing the name of Musa Pasha, a governor of Gaza during Ottoman rule.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} {{confusion}} about which characteristics that were sexually dimorphic in the species. Only three specimens were sexed (all males), {{with age and}} individual variation not considered. The male {{is thought to have}} been largest with a longer, curvier beak. In 1911, Réunion resident Eugène Jacob de Cordemoy recalled his observations of the bird about 50years before, suggesting that only males <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> crest, but this is thought to be incorrect. A presumed female (MNHN 2000-756) in the Paris museum appears to have a smaller crest, a smaller and less-curved beak, and smaller primary coverts. A juvenile specimen has a smaller crest and primary coverts, with a brown wash instead of ash grey on the crest, lore, and superciliary stripe, and a light-brown (instead of ash-brown) back. The juveniles of some southeast Asian starlings are also browner than adults.|$|E
25|$|The kingdom {{was formed}} through the {{unification}} of Kartli and Kakheti. The flag <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> cross against a black background. The country lost its independence in 1801 to annexation by the Russian Empire.|$|E

The underparts are pale buff-grey with a yellow central belly patch. The male <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> forehead, red crown, and yellow nape. The female <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> crown and forehead and reduced yellow nape. Young birds are duller, have less white above and less yellow on the belly.|$|R
5|$|The {{white-eyes}} {{are small}} birds of rather drab appearance, the plumage above being typically greenish-olive, but some species <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> or bright yellow throat, breast or lower parts, and several <b>have</b> buff flanks. <b>As</b> the name suggests, many species <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> ring around each eyes.|$|R

25|$|The ancestral form {{may have}} <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> chin, white throat, {{and a light}} grey breast {{as well as a}} greyish-brown head and back.

In original Home Lines livery she <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> hull and superstructure, with a blue decorative riband separating them. Her funnel and radar mast, the structures immediately below them and the cranes on her forward deck were painted yellow. The ship's name was painted in tall letters {{on the side of}} the superstructure below the radar mast.|$|E
25|$|In the 1966 Major League Baseball draft on June 7, Jackson was {{selected}} by the Kansas City Athletics. He was the second overall pick, behind 17-year-old catcher Steve Chilcott, who {{was taken by the}} New York Mets. According to Jackson, Winkles told him that the Mets did not select him because he <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> girlfriend. Winkles later denied the story, stating {{that he did not know}} the reason why Jackson was not drafted by the Mets. It was later confirmed by Joe McDonald that the Mets drafted Chilcott because of need, the person running the Mets at the time was George Weiss, so the true motive may never be known.|$|E
25|$|Early in the 20th century, South Carolina {{developed}} a thriving textile industry. The state also converted its agricultural base from cotton to more profitable crops; attracted large military bases through its powerful Democratic congressional delegation, {{part of the}} one-party South following disfranchisement of blacks {{at the turn of}} the century; and created tourism industries. During the early part of the 20th century, thousands of African Americans left South Carolina and other southern states for jobs and better opportunities in northern, Midwestern and western cities. In total from 1910 to 1970, 6.5 million blacks left the South in the Great Migration. By 1930 South Carolina <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> majority for the first time since 1708.|$|E

25|$|Eston {{was born}} into slavery as the {{youngest}} son of the slave Sally Hemings. As {{she was one of}} the six mixed-race children of Betty Hemings and John Wayles (Jefferson's father-in-law), she and her siblings were half-siblings to Jefferson's wife Martha Wayles and were three-quarters European in ancestry, as their mother <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> father. The historians Philip D. Morgan and Joshua D. Rothman have written about the numerous interracial relationships in the Wayles-Hemings-Jefferson families and the region, often with multiple generations repeating the pattern. The large Hemings family, with Betty Hemings as matriarch, was at the top of the slave hierarchy at Monticello; its members working as domestic servants, chefs, craftsmen and artisans.|$|E
25|$|Of {{the more}} than twenty HISD high schools that, as of 2007, had a {{standardized}} dress code or uniforms, Lamar {{was the only one}} that <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>White</b> plurality. The principal, James McSwain, cited safety concerns with a world after the Columbine High School massacre and the September 11, 2001 attacks as the reason for the school's adoption of uniforms. The newly created policy received opposition from some students and parents; the policy was criticized in the May 16, 2006 Houston Chronicle by Davidson in her column. The Houston Chronicle printed a feature about the Lamar uniform policy in the August 22, 2006 edition of the Yo! section; the feature was written by Jessica Silverman, a student at Lamar as of 2006.|$|E
25|$|The first Brazilian vexillological symbols were private {{maritime}} flags used by Portuguese merchant {{ships that}} sailed to Brazil. A flag with {{green and white}} stripes was used until 1692. The green and white colors represented the House of Braganza and the national colours of Portugal. In 1692, that flag was no longer used by ships that sailed to Brazil and became {{the flag of the}} merchant vessels in coastal Portugal. In 1692, a new flag was introduced for merchant vessels sailing to Brazil. The new flag <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> field with a golden armillary sphere. The armillary sphere had served as the personal emblem of King Manuel I of Portugal (reigned 1494-1521). During his reign Portuguese ships used it widely, and eventually it became a national emblem of Portugal and, more specifically, of the Portuguese empire. A similar flag was introduced for the Portuguese ships that sailed to India, but with a red armillary sphere. Despite representing the entire Portuguese empire, the armillary sphere began to be used more extensively in Brazil — the largest and most developed colony at the time — not only in maritime flags, but also on coins and other media. It eventually became the unofficial ensign of Brazil.|$|E

500|$|The biracial {{children}} of Betty Hemings by Wayles were three-quarters European in ancestry and very fair-skinned. They <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> maternal grandfather and two white paternal grandparents. Since 1662 in Virginia slave law, {{children born to}} enslaved mothers were considered slaves under the principle of partus sequitur ventrem: the slave status of a child followed that {{of his or her}} mother. [...] Elizabeth ("Betty") and her children, including Sally Hemings, and all their children, were legally slaves, although the fathers were the white masters and the children were majority-white in ancestry.|$|E
500|$|A [...] "painted vulture" [...] ("Sarcoramphus sacra" [...] or [...] "S. papa sacra") is {{described}} in William Bartram's notes of his travels in Florida during the 1770s. This bird's description matches {{the appearance of the}} king vulture except that it <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>white,</b> not black, tail. Bartram describes the bird as being relatively common and even claimed to have collected one. However, no other naturalists record the painted vulture in Florida and sixty years after the sighting its validity began to be questioned, leading to what John Cassin described as the most inviting problem in North American ornithology. An independent account and painting was made of a similar bird by Eleazar Albin in 1734.|$|E
