40|$|Abstract. The primary {{consumables}} {{in chemical}} mechanical polishing (CMP) are the polishing pad and the slurry. The polishing pad significantly influences {{the stability of}} the polishing process and the cost of consumables (CoC). During the polishing process, a <b>diamond</b> <b>dresser</b> must be frequently employed to remove the debris to prevent accumulation, a process known as pad conditioning. In this paper, we investigated the physical properties of the CMP pad such as compressibility, thickness, and surface roughness. The difference between new and used pads has been studied. Conclusively, conditioning via a <b>diamond</b> <b>dresser</b> will extend pad life and reduce CoC...|$|E

Chemical {{mechanical}} polishing / planarization (CMP) {{is a key}} technology for fabricating high-efficient semiconductor devices, and the CMP characteristics (removal rate and accuracy, etc.) is depended on the various consumables represented by slurry, polishing pad and dresser used in the CMP process. Currently, in the pad, there are many studies that have pointed the evaluation methodology and {{the correlation between the}} pad surface asperity and the CMP characteristics. On the other hand, the dresser {{is one of the most}} important consumables because the dresser can control the pad surface asperity, and the diamond grains electrodeposited dresser (<b>diamond</b> <b>dresser)</b> is frequently used. One drawback point of the <b>diamond</b> <b>dresser</b> is that the dressing performance declines owing to the deterioration of the diamond grains. Previously, we have developed a novel flexible fiber dresser that would ensure high performance and longer life of tools, and we have reported the fundamental characteristics by the flexible fiber dresser compared with that of the <b>diamond</b> <b>dresser.</b> In this paper, we will show the results of tool life evaluation of the flexible fiber dresser using a contact image analysis method. As a result, the flexible fiber dresser can be continuously used over 35 hours. Furthermore, the result of having examined the stability of the removal rate of a silicon wafer is reported. Therefore, we found that the flexible fiber dresser is one of the most effective dressing methods for the polishing pad...|$|E

Because of its good dressing effect, a new dressing method assisted by ultrasonic vibration attracted researchers ’ attention. In this paper, {{on the basis}} of the researches on dressing with single-point <b>diamond</b> <b>dresser,</b> physical model of ultrasonic dressing of grinding wheel were established. According to the physical model and the SEM photos of grinding wheel’s surface topography, the mechanism of ultrasonic dressing was brought to light. Through contrast experiments, based on roughness and micro-feature of the ground surface, the influence of ultrasonic dressing on grinding quality was researched...|$|E

40|$|All {{conventional}} pad conditioners are dressing the CMP pad with discrete diamond grits with random {{orientation of}} unleveled tips. As a result, the pad asperities are chaotic with polishing of delicate wafers with brutal force that may disrupt the IC layer. Worse still, as diamond grits are monocrystalline that must penetrate the pad after compression. As plastic deformation region is greatly extended under compression, the pad asperities are severely deformed with original polymers ruptured. Moreover, the transformed polymer is heated and mixed with polishing debris {{to form a}} work hardened glazing layer. Hence, the expensive wafer is pressed against compactized garbage dumps during the CMP process that cannot be fine-tuned. With the advent of polycrystalline <b>diamond</b> (PCD) <b>dressers,</b> the pad conditioning can be performed with an unprecedented regularity. The result is a total elimination of "killer asperities" that may scratch the soft copper layer or porous dielectric layer. Moreover, the PCD dressers may be constructed to form a blade shaver so pad disruption during conditioning can be minimized. As a result, the original pad polymers can be preserved for polishing wafers. This ultimate diamond disk (UDD) has transformed stick slipping pad destruction to smooth shaving pad construction. UDD is particularly suitable for dressing CMP pads for polishing 22 nm interconnects, in particularly, with the anticipated debut of 450 mm pancake wafers scheduled for 2012...|$|R
40|$|Shaping of {{the surface}} {{roughness}} in traverse grinding is much more complex compared to plunge grinding. What significantly influences the roughness of the machined surfaces in traverse grinding is the dressing of the grinding wheel, grinding parameters, and {{the form of the}} grinding wheel wear in this proc-ess. The occurrence of wear steps on the active grinding wheel surface (AGWS) causes that the set-up depth of cut is split into the wheel’s different steps, which in turn is a reason of a varying roughness shaped by those steps. The surface-roughness model presented, which includes parameters of the grinding wheel dressing with the single point <b>diamond</b> <b>dresser</b> and grinding parameters, allows us to estimate the size of surface roughness in the process of traverse grinding...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{experiment}} of resin-bonded CBN {{wheel dressing}} using a <b>diamond</b> <b>dresser</b> assisted with longitudinal ultrasonic vibration along {{the direction of}} depth of cut was carried out and the dressing characteristics and grinding performance were discussed in the present paper. The influence of acoustic parameters on the topography of CBN wheel was studied to check the effectiveness of dressing for this method. The experimental {{results showed that the}} higher the ultrasonic frequency is, the better the wheel topography. The grinding on K 9 optical glass and high speed steel has achieved higher G-ratio than that of traditionally mechanical dressed CBN grinding wheel. The ground surface of high speed steel is better than that of K 9 optical glass. According to the interferometer images, it was concluded that the grinding of high speed steel was in ductile cutting regime, while removal of K 9 optical glass was in brittle fracture regime...|$|E
40|$|AbstractGrinding causes {{progressive}} dulling and glazing of {{the grinding}} wheel grains and clogging of the voids on the wheel's surface with ground metal dust particles, which gradually increases the grinding forces. The {{condition of the}} grains at the periphery of a grinding wheel strongly influences the damage induced in a ground workpiece. Therefore, truing and dressing {{must be carried out}} frequently. Dressing is the process of conditioning the grinding wheel surface to reshape the wheel when it has lost its original shape through wear, giving the tool its original condition of efficiency. Despite the very broad range of dressing tools available today, the single-point <b>diamond</b> <b>dresser</b> is still the most widely used dressing tool due to its great versatility. The aim of this work is to predict the wear level of the single-point dresser based on acoustic emission and vibration signals used as input variables for fuzzy models. Experimental tests were performed with synthetic diamond dressers on a surface-grinding machine equipped with an aluminum oxide grinding wheel. Acoustic emission and vibration sensors were attached to the tool holder and the signals were captured at 2 MHz. During the tests, the wear of the diamond tip was measured every 20 passes using a microscope with 10 to 100 X magnification. A study was conducted of the frequency content of the signals, choosing the frequency bands that best correlate with the diamond's wear. Digital band-pass filters were applied to the raw signals, after which two statistics were calculated to serve as the inputs for the fuzzy models. The results indicate that the fuzzy models using the aforementioned signal statistics are highly effective for predicting the wear level of the dresser...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A <b>diamond</b> {{conditioner}} or <b>dresser</b> {{is needed}} to regenerate the asperity structure of the pad and recover its designed ability in chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) process. In this paper a new design of diamond conditioner is made by shaping a sintered matrix of polycrystalline diamond (PCD) to form teethed blades. These blades are arranged and embedded in epoxy resin to make a designed penetration angle, called the blade diamond disk. The dressing characteristics of pad surface textures are studied by comparison with conventional diamond conditioner. It is found that the height variation of the diamond tip of blade diamond disk is significantly smaller than the conventional diamond disk. The dressing rate of blade diamond disk is {{lower than that of}} the conventional diamond disk, and hence the pad life is prolonged. As a result, reduction of the cost CMP is expected. In addition the pad surface roughness Ra of about 3. 79 μm is less than Ra of about 4. 15 μm obtained after dressing using a conventional diamond disk...|$|R
