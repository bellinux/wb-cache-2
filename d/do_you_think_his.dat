6000|$|... 161. I {{closed my}} last lecture at the {{question}} respecting Nicholas's masonry. His mouldings may be careless, but <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>his</b> joints will be? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Probably. A very {{worrying}} {{time our}} headmaster is having, {{taking it all}} round, {{in connection with this}} painful affair. What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>his</b> move will be?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'My good woman,' said Gashford, 'how can you!--Dear me!--What do {{you mean}} by tempting, and by danger? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>his</b> lordship is a roaring lion, going about and seeking whom he may devour? God bless me!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, what <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of <b>his</b> urging {{us to go}} to the race? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> {{he meant}} it? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> he {{intended}} it for an invitation?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm HANGED if he ain't," [...] says Tug. [...] "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of <b>his</b> {{giving me}} eighteenpence yesterday, {{and a bottle}} of lavender-water for Mimarann?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Then if {{you have}} not, I can tell you who has. What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of <b>his</b> {{beginning}} {{to give me a}} lecture how to behave to you?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What difference?" [...] inquired Caroline, {{accompanying}} {{her to the}} door. [...] "James Helstone--that is, my father--is {{generally considered}} the best-looking of the two. Strangers, I remark, always exclaim, 'What a handsome man!' <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>his</b> picture handsome, Mrs. Pryor?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing, {{except that}} he seems to have gone mad," [...] Borrowdean said, bitterly. [...] "I went to him to-day to get him to fix the dates for his {{meetings}} at Glasgow and Leeds. What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>his</b> answer was?" ...|$|E
6000|$|But Sir Joshua's sketched leaves {{would indeed}} imply some unworkmanlike haste. We must not yet assume the Pisan master to have allowed himself in any such. His {{mouldings}} may be hastily cut, for they are, as I have just said, unnecessary to his structure, and disadvantageous to his decoration; {{but he is}} not likely to be careless about arrangements necessary for strength. His mouldings may be cut hastily, but <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>his</b> joints will be? ...|$|E
6000|$|GIACOMO [LIGHTING THE LAMP]: And yet once {{quenched}} I cannot thus relume My father's life: <b>do</b> <b>you</b> not <b>think</b> <b>his</b> ghost Might plead {{that argument}} with God? ...|$|R
6000|$|Fuller nodded. [...] "That's what I like. The man {{who puts}} his job before what he gets for it {{naturally}} {{makes the best}} work. What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of <b>his</b> manner?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, {{and so did}} I, {{from what}} little I saw of him,' replied Lowten, 'it only shows how one may be deceived. What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of <b>his</b> going to Demerara, too?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{you must}} say, {{if you are}} weak enough {{to wait for him}} here. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>his</b> mother will {{consider}} his feelings, when he comes back to marry you? I tell you again I am not talking at random. I have thought it all out: I know how you can make your escape, and defy pursuit. You have plenty of money; you have Teresa to take care of you. Go! For your own sake, for his sake, go!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It's {{always as}} well to talk that way,' {{returned}} old Arthur, with a chuckle, 'whether there's anybody to hear us or not. Practice makes perfect, you know. Now, if I offer myself to Bray as his son-in-law, upon one simple condition that the moment I am fast married he shall be quietly released, and have an allowance to live just t'other side the water like a gentleman (he can't live long, for I have asked his doctor, and he declares that his complaint {{is one of the}} Heart and it is impossible), and if all the advantages of this condition are properly stated and dwelt upon to him, do you think he could resist me? And if he could not resist ME, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>his</b> daughter could resist HIM? Shouldn't I have her Mrs Arthur Gride--pretty Mrs Arthur Gride--a tit-bit--a dainty chick--shouldn't I have her Mrs Arthur Gride in a week, a month, a day--any time I chose to name?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Leave that to me," [...] said she; [...] "I {{know how}} to {{pleasure}} his Majesty better than you can teach me. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>his</b> Majesty is booby enough to cry like a schoolboy because his sparrow has flown away? His Majesty has better taste. I am surprised at you, Chiffinch," [...] she added, drawing herself up, [...] "who were once thought to know the points of a fine woman, {{that you should have}} made such a roaring about this country wench. Why, she has not even the country quality of being plump as a barn-door fowl, but is more like a Dunstable lark, that one must crack bones and all if you would make a mouthful of it. What signifies whence she came, or where she goes? There will be those behind that are much more worthy of his Majesty's condescending attention, even when the Duchess of Portsmouth takes the frumps." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Quite so," [...] she admitted. [...] "Go on. The {{young man}} rather puzzles me myself. I {{should like to}} hear what you make of him. What <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of <b>his</b> face?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of <b>his</b> {{going to}} Wuthering Heights?' I inquired. 'He is {{reformed}} in every respect, apparently: quite a Christian: offering {{the right hand}} of fellowship to his enemies all around!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of <b>his</b> condition?" [...] {{she asked}} me, {{after the second}} day was over. I could see by her own grave face that she had already formed her own conclusions.|$|R
6000|$|... "Robert Oakshott is gone {{in search}} of him. He had set off to beat up the country, good old man, to obtain {{signatures}} to the petition in favour of our prisoner, and Robert expected to find him with Mr. Chute at the Vine. It is much to that young man's credit, niece, he was so eager to see his brother that he longed {{to come with me}} himself; but he thought that the shock to his father would be so great that he ought to bear the tidings himself. And what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>his</b> good wife is about? Perhaps you did not know that Sedley Archfield brought away jail fever with him, and Mrs. Oakshott, feeling that she was the cause by her hasty action, has taken lodgings for him in Winchester, and is nursing him like a sister. No. You need not fear for your colonel, my dear maid. Sedley caught the infection because he neither was, nor wished to be, secluded {{from the rest of the}} prisoners, some of whom were, I fear, only too congenial society to him. But now tell me the story of your own deliverance, which seems to me nothing short of miraculous." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I {{think he}} was right, and I am very, very {{grateful}} to you for telling me about my father." [...] After a while she continued: [...] "But, Mr. Travers, I hardly {{know what to say}} about the dream. I have heard and read of such things, and--I was just what he imagined--just like the girl he saw in his dream. And when my life was so miserable, if I had known where to find him--if mother could have told me--I should have gone to him to ask him to save me. But--how can I say it? Don't you think, Mr. Travers, that if dreams and warnings were sent to us--if good spirits could let us know things in that way and tell us what to do, that it would happen oftener? ... There are always so many in distress and danger, and sometimes so little is needed to save one--a few pence, a few kind words --and yet how many fall, how many die! Even in the Regent's Canal how many poor women throw their lives away--and nothing saves them.... I am not glad to hear that it was a dream that first made my father wish to find mother--and me. I should have preferred to hear that he thought of her-- of us, before he fell into such bad health, and when he was strong and happy.... <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>his</b> dream was sent from heaven, Mr. Travers?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 3. I have {{a desire}} to be with Christ; there the spirits of the just are perfected; there the spirits of the righteous are as full as they can hold (Heb 12:23). A sight of Jesus in the Word, some know how it will change them from glory to glory (2 Cor 3:18), but how then shall we be changed and filled, when we shall see him as he is? 'When he shall appear, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is' (1 John 3:2). Moses and Elias {{appeared}} to Peter, and James, and John, at the transfiguration of Christ, in glory. How so? Why, they had been in the heavens, and came thence with some of the glories of heaven upon them. Gild a bit of wood, yea, gild it seven times over, and it must not compare in difference to wood not gilt, to the soul that but a little while has been dipped in glory! Glory is a strange thing to men that are {{on this side of the}} heavens; it is that which eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, nor entered into the heart of man to conceive of; only the Christian has a Word and Spirit that at times doth give a little of the glimmering thereof unto him. But O! when he is in the Spirit, and sees in the Spirit, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>his</b> tongue can tell? But, I say, if the sight of heaven, at so vast a distance, is so excellent a prospect, what will it look like when one is in it? No marvel, then, if the desires of the righteous are to be with Christ.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Foley {{is quite}} {{satisfied}} with that--in fact he <b>thinks</b> it's best. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> know, {{he seems to}} have gained a new lease of life during the last few weeks. What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of <b>his</b> commission on your Manchester strike?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of <b>his</b> Latin and Greek?" [...] {{asks the}} Colonel. Before {{going out to}} his party, Newcome had laid a deep scheme with Binnie, {{and it had been}} agreed that the latter should examine the young fellow in his humanities.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, {{but he is}} though," [...] {{said the}} judge. [...] "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of <b>his</b> wounds? And if all that I hear be true, he has other battles on hand. But we must not speak about that till this poor lady's trial is over." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Here's the Stop,' said Pancks, 'that {{sets the}} tune to be ground. And there {{is but one}} tune, and its name is Grind, Grind, Grind! Here's the Proprietor, and here's his Grubber. Why, good people, when he comes {{smoothly}} spinning through the Yard to-night, like a slow-going benevolent Humming-Top, and when you come about him with your complaints of the Grubber, you don't know what a cheat the Proprietor is! What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of <b>his</b> showing himself to-night, that I may have all the blame on Monday? What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of <b>his</b> having had me over the coals this very evening, because I don't squeeze <b>you</b> enough? What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of my being, at the present moment, under special orders to squeeze you dry on Monday?' ...|$|R
6000|$|Montgomery gave an ugly {{twist to}} his {{dropping}} lip. [...] "He's always drunk. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that excuses <b>his</b> assaulting his passengers?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The savage has his virtues {{as well as}} his failings," [...] said Maxwell, {{looking after}} him. [...] "That man, however, is neither French nor negro, and such as he usually combine the vices of both sides of their ancestry. What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of <b>his</b> proposal, Hilton?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That old captain is a {{wonderful}} old fellow," [...] he said. [...] "What a life he has led! Why, the man had more adventures in one week of his life {{than most of us}} have in a lifetime. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> really <b>think</b> <b>his</b> tales are all true?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{what about}} Baxter, father? If he has those papers, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> he or <b>his</b> confederate {{will go up}} the Larkspur to locate the Eclipse Mine?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of <b>his</b> {{having the}} impudence to tell Cunliffe"--Cunliffe {{was the head}} keeper--"before my face, that he didn't know {{anything}} about pheasants! 'Well, my lord, I think we've got a few about the place,' said Cunliffe. 'Very few,' said Ongar, with a sneer. Now, if I haven't a better head of game here than he has at Courton, I'll eat him. But the impudence of his saying that before me!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes;--what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of <b>his</b> condition;--of his happiness, his health, his {{capacity}} of endurance? Will {{he be able}} to go on much longer? Now, my dear Duke, don't stare at me like that. You know, and I know, that you haven't spoken a word to me for the last two months. And you know, and I know, how many things there are of which we are both thinking in common. You haven't quarrelled with Plantagenet?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'In vain, dear Miss King! I can't bear {{handsome}} men. I see his frivolity and shallowness; and for amiability, what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> {{of keeping}} <b>his</b> cousin all the morning from shooting {{for such a}} mere nothing, and then sending him off for a ten miles' walk? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The sea alone knows," [...] he said. [...] "For {{the first}} time, though, Robert, I feel {{inclined}} {{to agree with}} the newspapers, who speak of the strange disappearance of the Honourable Antimony Palliser. Could any man go backwards over that palisading, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think,</b> and save <b>his</b> life?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{presently}} George came in. He {{put away}} his cap, walked in softly, {{and put his}} face down in his mother's lap, and said, with tears and sobs, 'Mother, I have been doing something very wrong.' Now, which of these <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> came to <b>his</b> mother right?'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Jackoway ditchen hula," [...] echoed Rea. [...] "The damned Indian says 'wife sticks none.' He's goin' to quit us. What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of thet? <b>His</b> wife's out of wood. Jackoway out of wood, an' {{here we are}} {{two days}} from the Arctic Ocean. Jones, the damned heathen don't go back!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll send then {{my usual}} messenger," [...] said Mitchy, [...] "a person I keep for such jobs, {{thoroughly}} seasoned, {{as you may}} imagine, and of a discretion--what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> call it?--a toute epreuve. Only you must {{let me say that}} I like your terror about Harold! <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> he spends <b>his</b> time over Dr. Watts's hymns?" ...|$|R
