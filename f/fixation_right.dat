Without a central task, left visual field superiority has generally been obtained. It has been suggested to attribute the difference to control of eye fixation by the central task. An alternative interpretation, that the central task modifies the order of attentional scanning was put to the test in Experiment I. With two normally printed words, right visual field superiority was obtained with a central task and left visual field superiority without it. It was predicted that with mirrored words, the opposite pattern would be obtained, yet here right visual field superiority was obtained both without and with a central task. Experiment II shows that the latter result is nevertheless dependent on scanning order, for it can be completely inverted through recall order instructions. It is concluded that lateral differences observed with bilateral presentation cannot be explained without taking account of optional processing priorities, but that the factors on which the latter depend are not yet fully understood. © 1975.

The examination was unremarkable, and inflammatory markers were normal. An anteroposterior (AP) pelvic radiograph was arranged (figure 1), and the child was referred to fracture clinic. No lateral radiographs were obtained. Due to a slight irregularity in the articular surface, an MRI scan was organised to investigate the possibility of Legg–Calvé– Perthes disease. The child’s symptoms settled; his parents missed his MRI scan appointment. Two years later, the child presented with pain on the opposite side.

It is possible to encourage alternation through the use of occlusion or patching of the 'dominant' or 'fixating' eye to promote the use of the other.

CASE REPORT: Patients A.

We perform reposition and fixation of supra and transcondyar femoral fracture with “cobra” plate. Also we perform reposition and <b>fixation</b> of <b>right</b> cruris with external fixation. After the operation we found fistula in the place of operation of the right crural regia. During the time the infection goes worse and the patient develop osteomyelittis on the right crural regia. After 5 months with therapy the situation become calm. We remove the external fixation. The patient develops severe “pes equinus” on the right leg and he cannot walk. We try to reduce this equines situation with elongation of the Achilles tendonin the first step, and because we didn’t solve the problem we continue with complete section of the Achilles tendon and after that we perform osteotomy of the right talocrural joint simultaneous to tibia plafond and talus and resection of fibula 2 sm. above the syndesmosae tibiofibularis and we fixed the talocrural joint with two screws according the technique of Ulrich Holz.

40|$|This article aims to {{investigate}} whether auditory stimuli in the horizontal plane, particularly originating from behind the participant, affect audiovisual integration by using behavioral and event-related potential (ERP) measurements. In this study, visual stimuli were presented {{directly in front of}} the participants, auditory stimuli were presented at one location in an equidistant horizontal plane at the front (0 °, the <b>fixation</b> point), <b>right</b> (90 °), back (180 °), or left (270 °) of the participants, and audiovisual stimuli that include both visual stimuli and auditory stimuli originating from one of the four locations were simultaneously presented. These stimuli were presented randomly with equal probability; during this time, participants were asked to attend to the visual stimulus and respond promptly only to visual target stimuli (a unimodal visual target stimulus and the visual target of the audiovisual stimulus). A significant facilitation of reaction times and hit rates was obtained following audiovisual stimulation, irrespective of whether the auditory stimuli were presented in the front or back of the participant. However, no significant interactions were found between visual stimuli and auditory stimuli from the right or left. Two main ERP components related to audiovisual integration were found: first, auditory stimuli from the front location produced an ERP reaction over the right temporal area and right occipital area at approximately 160 - 200 milliseconds; second, auditory stimuli from the back produced a reaction over the parietal and occipital areas at approximately 360 - 400 milliseconds. Our results confirmed that audiovisual integration was also elicited, even though auditory stimuli were presented behind the participant, but no integration occurred when auditory stimuli were presented in the right or left spaces, suggesting that the human brain might be particularly sensitive to information received from behind than both sides...|$|R

40|$|Short-lasting, {{transient}} head displacements {{and near}} target fixation {{were used to}} measure the latency and early response gain of vestibularly evoked eye movements during lateral and fore-aft translations in rhesus monkeys. The latency of the horizontal eye movements elicited during lateral motion was 11. 9 +/- 5. 4 ms. Viewing distance-dependent behavior was seen as early as the beginning of the response profile. For fore-aft motion, latencies were different for forward and backward displacements. Latency averaged 7. 1 +/- 9. 3 ms during forward motion (same for both eyes) and 12. 5 +/- 6. 3 ms for the adducting eye (e. g., left eye during <b>right</b> <b>fixation)</b> during backward motion. Latencies during backward motion were significantly longer for the abducting eye (18. 9 +/- 9. 8 ms). Initial acceleration gains of the two eyes were generally larger than unity but asymmetric. Specifically, gains were consistently larger for abducting than adducting eye movements. The large initial acceleration gains tended to compensate for the response latencies such that the early eye movement response approached, albeit consistently incompletely, that required for maintaining visual acuity during the movement. These short-latency vestibuloocular responses could complement the visually generated optic flow responses that have been shown to exhibit much longer latencies...|$|R
