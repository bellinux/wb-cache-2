Their accuracy is therefore questionable. Some of these methods also need expensive pilot testing. A new ball mill scale-up procedure is developed which does not have these limitations. This procedure uses data from two laboratory tests to determine the parameters of a ball mill model. A set of scale-up criteria then scales-up these parameters. The procedure uses the scaled-up parameters to simulate the steady state performance of full-scale mill circuits. At the end of the simulation, the scale-up procedure gives the size distribution, the volumetric flowrate and the mass flowrate of all the streams in the circuit, and the mill power draw...|$|R

40|$|In {{the last}} decade {{there has been an}} {{increase}} in demand for <b>fine</b> <b>grinding</b> due to the depletion of coarse-grained orebodies and an increase of processing fine disseminated minerals and complex orebodies. These ores have provided new challenges in concentrator design because <b>fine</b> and ultra-fine <b>grinding</b> is required to achieve acceptable recovery rates. Therefore, the correct design of a grinding circuit is important for minimizing unit costs and increasing product quality. The use of ball <b>mills</b> for <b>grinding</b> in <b>fine</b> size ranges is inefficient and, therefore, vertical stirred <b>grinding</b> <b>mills</b> are becoming increasingly popular in the mineral processing industry due to its already known high energy efficiency. This work presents a hypothesis of a methodology to predict the product size distribution of a vertical stirred mill using a Bond ball mill. The Population Balance Model (PBM) was used to empirically analyze the performance of a vertical mill and a Bond ball mill. The breakage parameters obtained for both <b>grinding</b> <b>mills</b> are compared to determine the possibility of predicting the product size distribution of a vertical mill based on the results obtained from the Bond ball mill. The biggest advantage of this methodology {{is that most of the}} minerals processing laboratories already have a Bond ball mill to perform the tests suggested in this study. Preliminary results show the possibility of predicting the performance of a laboratory vertical stirred mill using a Bond ball mill...|$|R

40|$|<b>Grinding</b> <b>mills</b> {{are used}} {{extensively}} in the mining, cement and minerals processing industries. Numerous failures of drivetrain components of <b>grinding</b> <b>mills</b> have occurred in recent years. The components are not meeting their required design lives leaving mill owners concerned about the expensive repair costs and lost profits associated with the mill downtime during repairs. There {{is a need to}} research the design methodology of the drivetrain components of <b>grinding</b> <b>mills</b> and the analysis of fatigue failures in mills and similar equipment e. g. kilns in order to develop a comprehensive and improved picture of how to design and operate these mills. As with numerous other engineered items, the critical issue is that a thorough understanding of the type, magnitude, direction, and duration of all loads that the components will experience while in operation is required in order to design them correctly. A literature survey was performed to research advanced design methods and identify sources of loading data for <b>grinding</b> <b>mills.</b> Many interesting references were identified but no specific examples were found where strain gauge measurements were used to quantify the loads experienced by the drivetrain components of <b>grinding</b> <b>mills.</b> Strain gauge measurements were conducted on the drivetrains of 30 <b>grinding</b> <b>mills.</b> The measured data was processed and analysed to determine the key operating loads experienced by the <b>grinding</b> <b>mill</b> drivetrain components.

Finally, comprehensive fatigue analysis was conducted using the measured data to understand the major contributors to poor service life of the drivetrain components.

50|$|A typical type of fine grinder is {{the ball}} mill. A {{slightly}} inclined or horizontal rotating cylinder is partially filled with balls, usually stone or metal, which grind {{material to the}} necessary fineness by friction and impact with the tumbling balls. Ball mills normally operate with an approximate ball charge of 30%. Ball mills are characterized by their smaller (comparatively) diameter and longer length, and often have a length 1.5 to 2.5 times the diameter. The feed is {{at one end of}} the cylinder and the discharge is at the other.

40|$|A <b>grinding</b> <b>mill</b> circuit forms {{a crucial}} part in the {{energy-intensive}} comminution process of extracting valuable metals and minerals from mined ore. The ability to control the <b>grinding</b> <b>mill</b> circuit is of primary importance to achieve the desired product specification with regards to quality and production rate. In order to achieve control objectives an accurate dynamic model of the milling circuit is required. Phenomenological models are preferred over linear-time-invariant models since the latter cannot describe the non-linear behaviour of the process. However, the available phenomenological models of <b>grinding</b> <b>mill</b> circuits are usually complex, use large parameter sets and are mostly aimed towards steady-state design of <b>grinding</b> <b>mill</b> circuits. This study investigates simplified non-linear dynamic models of <b>grinding</b> <b>mill</b> circuits suitable for process controller design. In {{the first part of}} this study, the number of size classes in a cumulative rates model of a <b>grinding</b> <b>mill</b> circuit is reduced to determine the minimum number required to provide a reasonably accurate model of the circuit for process control. Each reduced size class set is used to create a non-linear cumulative rates model which is linearized to design a linear model predictive controller. The accuracy of a model is determined by the ability of the corresponding model predictive controller to control important process variables in the <b>grinding</b> <b>mill</b> circuit as represented by the full non-linear cumulative rates model. The second part of the study validates a simple and novel non-linear model of a run-of-mine <b>grinding</b> <b>mill</b> circuit developed for process control and estimation purposes. This model is named the Hulbert-model and makes use of the minimum number of states and parameters necessary to produce responses that are qualitatively accurate. It consists of separate feeder, mill, sump and hydrocyclone modules that can be connected to model different circuit configurations. The model uses five states: rocks, solids, fines, water and steel balls. Rocks are defined as too large to be discharged from the mill, whereas solids, defined as particles small enough to leave the mill, consist of out-of-specification coarse ore and in-specification fine ore fractions. The model incorporates a unique prediction of the rheology of the slurry within the mill. A new hydrocyclone model is also presented. The Hulbert-model parameters are fitted to an existing plant’s sampling campaign data and a step-wise procedure is given to fit the model to steady-state data. Simulation test results of the model are compared to sampling campaign data of the same plant at different steady-state conditions. Dissertation (MEng) [...] University of Pretoria, 2012.

40|$|Polishing {{is applied}} to {{manufacture}} steel surfaces with a low roughness and glossy shine up to a highly reflective mirror finish. As moulds and dies are mostly freeformed, no automated process is capable of polishing the surfaces so that the process is realised manually. Investigations are made to develop a robot polishing system and to elaborate robust process strategies. In this paper, the progress is shown {{by means of a}} mirror finish on a free-formed steel surface realised by automated polishing. The investigations of machining parameters (e. g. pressure, revolutions, feed rate) as well as path related parameters (e. g. trochoid radii, offsets) lead to an optimal process strategy.

40|$|The {{problem of}} <b>fine</b> <b>grinding</b> is that problem {{connected}} with the reduction of a rock material to a size such that the valuable mineral it contains may be satisfactorily extracted. <b>Fine</b> <b>grinding</b> {{is perhaps the most}} significant process in any milling operation, and forms a commensurate percentage of the unit milling cost.
