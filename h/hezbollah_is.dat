5|$|Back in the 1980s, the {{ideology}} of Hezbollah was described as radical. It {{is presented in the}} 1985 manifesto. The first objective was fighting against American and Israeli imperialism, freedom of the occupied Southern Lebanon and all other occupied territories. The second objective was to gather all Muslims in the concept of ummah; then Lebanon would continue the 1979 Revolution of Iran. It also declared it would protect all Lebanese communities except the ones which collaborated with Israel, and supported all national movements—Muslim or non-Muslim—throughout the world. The Ideology has been changed, and today <b>Hezbollah</b> <b>is</b> a left-wing political entity focused on social injustice.|$|E

25|$|Daher {{was born}} in 1967 in the {{predominantly}} Christian south Lebanese town of Marjayoun and began working as a civil defense volunteer {{at the age of}} 12. In 1986, during the 1982-2000 South Lebanon conflict and Lebanese civil war of 1975-1990, he joined the civil defense service of the Lebanese interior ministry as an apprentice and worked his way up the ranks. His home town was at the centre of the 1982-2000 conflict, being the headquarters of the pro-Israeli South Lebanon Army militia, and was repeatedly attacked by Palestinian militias during the civil war and subsequently by the Hezbollah militia during Israel's occupation of southern Lebanon. He moved to the coastal city of Tyre in 1996, where the influence of <b>Hezbollah</b> <b>is</b> far weaker (the city is run by Hezbollah's secular rival Amal. By the time of the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict, he was working as the head of civil defense operations for Tyre and the surrounding region, including Qana.|$|E
500|$|Academics {{specializing in}} a wide variety of the social {{sciences}} believe that <b>Hezbollah</b> <b>is</b> an example of an Islamic terrorist organization. Such scholars and research institutes include the following: ...|$|E
5000|$|Israeli {{military}} historian Martin van Creveld {{stated that}} Israel's war against <b>Hezbollah</b> <b>was</b> indeed [...] "marked {{by a long}} series of failures" [...] but he criticized the Winograd Commission for its failure {{to take into account the}} substantial achievements of the war. He noted that hundreds of <b>Hezbollah</b> fighters <b>were</b> killed in the war, and that the organization had [...] "the fight knocked out of it", since following the war, Israel experienced a level of calm on its Lebanon border not seen since the mid-1960s. He also noted that <b>Hezbollah</b> <b>was</b> [...] "thrown out of South Lebanon", and was replaced by [...] "a fairly robust United Nations peacekeeping force" [...] to prevent its return.|$|R

5000|$|Ansar-e <b>Hezbollah</b> <b>was</b> {{formed in}} 1995, A 1997 Amnesty International report {{describes}} Ansar-e Hezbollah as an [...] "offshoot" [...] of Hezbollah. and Middle East International {{describes it as}} the [...] "vigilante associate" [...] of Hezbollah. Journalist Afshin Molavi describes them as [...] "a small fringe group" [...] with [...] "perhaps 100 Tehran members at most," [...] but with influence disproportionate to its numbers thanks to [...] "links with police and security services and high-level conservative clerics." [...] Ansar-e <b>Hezbollah</b> <b>was</b> known for its attacks against [...] "popular Islamic philosopher" [...] Abdol Karim Soroush.|$|R
500|$|There is a [...] "wide difference" [...] between American and Arab {{perception}} of Hezbollah. Several Western countries officially classify Hezbollah or its external security wing {{as a terrorist}} organization, {{and some of their}} violent acts have been described as terrorist attacks. However, throughout most of the Arab and Muslim worlds, <b>Hezbollah</b> <b>is</b> referred to as a resistance movement, engaged in national defense. Even within Lebanon, sometimes Hezbollah's status as either a [...] "militia" [...] or [...] "national resistance" [...] has been contentious. In Lebanon, although not universally well-liked, <b>Hezbollah</b> <b>is</b> widely seen as a legitimate national resistance organization defending Lebanon, and actually described by Lebanese information minister as an important ally in fighting terrorist groups. In Arab world, <b>Hezbollah</b> <b>is</b> generally seen either as a destabilizing force that functions as Iran's pawn by rentier states like Egypt and Saudi Arabia, or as a popular sociopolitical guerilla movement that exemplifies strong leadership, meaningful political action, and a commitment to social justice.|$|E
500|$|An {{official}} of the Future Movement, part of the March 14 Alliance, warned that Hezbollah [...] "has all {{the characteristics of a}} terrorist party", and that <b>Hezbollah</b> <b>is</b> moving Lebanon toward the Iranian Islamic system of government.|$|E

5000|$|The {{ideology}} of <b>Hezbollah</b> has <b>been</b> summarized as Shiite radicalism. <b>Hezbollah</b> <b>was</b> largely formed {{with the aid}} of the Ayatollah Khomeini's followers in the early 1980s in order to spread Islamic revolution and follows a distinct version of Islamic Shi'a ideology (Valiyat al-faqih or Guardianship of the Islamic Jurists) developed by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, leader of the [...] "Islamic Revolution" [...] in Iran.|$|R

Fajr-3 missiles have a range of [...] and a 45-kg (99-lb) warhead, and Fajr-5 missiles, which extend to , also hold 45-kg (99-lb) warheads. It was reported that <b>Hezbollah</b> <b>is</b> in possession of Scud missiles that were provided to them by Syria. Syria denied the reports.|$|E
500|$|Hezbollah waged an {{asymmetric}} war using suicide {{attacks against the}} Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and Israeli targets outside of Lebanon. <b>Hezbollah</b> <b>is</b> reputed to {{have been among the}} first Islamic resistance groups in the Middle East to use the tactics of suicide bombing, assassination, and capturing foreign soldiers, as well as murders and hijackings. Hezbollah also employed more conventional military tactics and weaponry, notably Katyusha rockets and other missiles. At the end of the Lebanese Civil War in 1990, despite the Taif Agreement asking for the [...] "disbanding of all Lebanese and non-Lebanese militias," [...] Syria, which controlled Lebanon at that time, allowed Hezbollah to maintain their arsenal and control Shia areas along the border with Israel.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to Israel, advanced weapons systems used by Egypt, Turkey, Iran, Syria, and <b>Hezbollah</b> <b>were</b> also hacked into. In particular, the operation managed to obtain footage of Iranian-made drones {{operated by the}} Syrian government.|$|R
50|$|The {{group which}} {{became known as}} Hizbollah took this name in 1993, after {{emerging}} victorious from a bloody factional war between two wings of the Union Movement (Vahdet Hareketi) which had been established following the 1980 Turkish coup d'état's crushing of Islamist hopes for democratic success. Hüseyin Velioğlu's group had previously been known as İlim, named for his bookshop. According to Turkish security officials, <b>Hezbollah</b> <b>was</b> financed by and trained in post-revolutionary Iran, with Iran allegedly using terror groups to establish Islamic governments throughout the Middle East. However, there is substantial evidence that Turkish <b>Hezbollah</b> <b>was</b> in fact supported, if not actually established, by elements of the Turkish state and military.|$|R
