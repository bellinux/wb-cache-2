5|$|However, some job {{still had}} to be found for Chotiner, who had wound up his California {{practice}} and sold his home. Haldeman refused to <b>have</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> the White House, and Nixon's aides deemed that the Democratic-controlled Senate was unlikely to confirm Chotiner for any post requiring its approval. On April 10, 1969, acting Special Representative for Trade Negotiations Theodore R. Gates appointed Chotiner as General Counsel to his office, as almost simultaneously, the White House announced Gates' replacement, Carl J. Gilbert. On April 1, Nixon had issued Executive Order 11463, making the position of general counsel in that office a Schedule C, or political appointment, and significantly raising the salary of the position. Nixon press secretary Ron Ziegler stated that the salary had been raised because the new incumbent was expected to play {{a more active role}} than had previous holders of the position.|$|E
500|$|In 2002, Morse starred as Mike Olshansky, an ex-Philadelphia {{police officer}} turned cab driver, in the {{television}} film Hack. The film was so well received that a television series with the same name was created. For {{his role in the}} 2002 crime-drama film Shuang Tong, Morse was nominated as Best Supporting Actor in the Golden Horse Awards, the first ever nomination for an English-speaking actor. He appeared as questionable neighbor Mr. Turner in the 2007 release Disturbia. Film critic and commentator John Podhoretz wrote that Morse is a [...] "largely unsung character actor who enlivens and deepens every movie fortunate enough to <b>have</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> the cast".|$|E

500|$|Newspaper {{reaction}} to the result was generally along partisan lines. [...] The Cincinnati Commercial Tribune, a Republican paper, stated of Hanna, [...] "And {{this is the man}} against whom has been waged a war than which political history furnishes none more venomous, vicious, and relentlessly vituperative. It is a disgraceful story, known of all men." [...] The Blade, another Republican paper, agreed, writing, [...] "The fight against Mr. Hanna was the most malignantly traitorous contest ever waged in the political annals of Ohio." [...] The Cincinnati Enquirer, a Silver Democratic paper, argued, [...] "The Republican contingent which stuck to the last against Hanna has made a record which the victorious faction might well envy... Their fight was... against the chairman of the national committee and all its forces and resources; against the president of the United States, with his tremendous party influence and more influential patronage. Against all this they have cut down the man who a year ago was, next to the president, the leading Republican of the United States, to a pitiful majority of one in his ambition to be elected to the Senate, and that obtained under circumstances not creditable to him. They chased him so hard that he dare not stop to have the gravest charges investigated." [...] Hearst's New York Journal noted, [...] "And so it is to be 'Senator Hanna' for seven years. Well, the senatorship can add nothing to its holder's power for evil. As long as Hanna has his money he can control senatorships, whether he occupies them or not. Perhaps it is best to <b>have</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> the open." ...|$|E
500|$|During the 1935 season Yorkshire {{regained the}} County Championship, and Verity passed 200wickets {{for the first}} time in his career, taking 211 at an average of 14.36 to finish third in the {{national}} averages. He took five wickets in an innings 22times and had 10 or more wickets in seven matches. South Africa played England in a five-Test series that year and won the series 1–0. Verity was selected in the first four games. In the first, his figures were three for 52 in 41overs on a pitch which assisted spin bowlers. England were in a position of dominance when rain ruined the game. Shortly afterwards, the tourists defeated Yorkshire; in the second innings, Jock Cameron hit 30runs from a single over bowled by Verity. Arthur Wood, the Yorkshire wicket-keeper, commented during the over: [...] "Go on, Hedley, you <b>have</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> two minds. He doesn't know whether to hit you for four or six!" [...] South Africa won the second Test match, their first Test win in England, although Verity took six wickets in the match. In the third game, Verity had bowling figures of two wickets for nine runs from 25overs in the match and in the fourth, he took one for 72 from 40overs. These two games were drawn, leaving England needing a victory in the final match. By now, Verity had acquired a reputation for being unable to take wickets on good batting pitches. In the report on the fourth Test, Wisden's correspondent observed: [...] "Verity again failed to worry South Africa's batsmen". With victory essential, Verity was dropped for the last match. He was replaced by off-spinner Johnnie Clay, regarded by critics as effective at flighting the ball.|$|E

2500|$|While Ornea {{himself is}} {{described}} by his various peers as a modest man who would not seek or discuss honors, one of the controversies surrounding his work involves its lack of acceptance by {{some areas of the}} cultural establishment. Several of his colleagues, including essayists Mircea Iorgulescu and Andrei Pleșu and cultural historian Andrei Oișteanu, publicly expressed indignation that he has never been considered for membership in the Romanian Academy. According to Pleșu, the institution was thus reconfirming the earlier rejection of Jewish scholars such as Moses Gaster, Lazăr Șăineanu or Heimann Hariton Tiktin, and instead kept itself open to [...] "demagogues of tradition". Iorgulescu also commented: [...] "When [...] turned 50 I wrote that he alone values as much as an Academy institute. [...] But the Ceaușist Academy had other preoccupations [...] As did the 'liberated' one following '89. Having died without previous notice, and even rudely so, Z.

2500|$|While Shakespeare closely {{followed}} Cinthio's tale in composing Othello, he departed {{from it in}} some details, particularly in the tale's depiction of Desdemona's death. [...] In Cinthio, the Moor commissions his ensign to bludgeon Desdemona {{to death with a}} sand-filled stocking. In gruesome detail, Cinthio follows each blow, and, when the lady is dead, the Moor and his ensign place her lifeless body upon her bed, smash her skull, and then cause the cracked ceiling above the bed to collapse upon her, giving the impression the falling rafters caused her death. The two murderers escape detection. [...] The Moor then misses his wife greatly, and comes to loathe the sight of his ensign.

2500|$|With the Viceroy of Naples, Lannoy, {{trapped in}} Siena (and the Prince of Orange unwilling to <b>have</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> Rome), the Cardinal assumed {{control of the}} city of Rome, as much as anyone could, while his {{personal}} enemy, pope Clement VII, was a prisoner in Castel Sant'Angelo. The victorious Imperial party made La Motte the Governor of the City of Rome and Philibert of Orange the head of the army. [...] A council was appointed, including Bemelberg (Frundberg's successor), the Abbot of Nagera (Fernando Marin, Commissary General of the Imperial Armies in Italy), Giovanni Battista Lodron, Juan de Urbina, Cardinal Pompeo Colonna, Vespasiano Colonna (Prospero's son), Girolamo Morone (the Sforza agent), Mercurino Gattinara (the Emperor's Grand Chancellor), and others. On 11 May 1527 it was reported to the Marchese of Mantua that Cardinal Colonna was going to be restored to all of his dignities and benefices, as soon as the Pope could arrange a Consistory. [...] This was an explicit part of the treaty which was being worked out between the Emperor and the Pope [...] Early in June it was reported that Cardinal Colonna was ill with 'the flux' (dysentery? typhoid fever?) or the peste, and even that he was dead. [...] More accurately, the Secretary Perez wrote to the Emperor on 30 May that Colonna had been ill for four or five days with a fever, but that he was recovering. [...] On 5 June it was reported by Cardinal Francesco Pisani that Cardinal Colonna had come to the Castel S. Angelo to kiss the hand of the Pope, {{despite the fact that the}} Pope was unwilling.|$|E
