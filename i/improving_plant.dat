5000|$|Silicon is a {{naturally}} occurring mineral {{and the second}} most abundant element in the earth's crust. In the soil, silicon attaches to soil colloids, helping to reduce compaction and making tied-up nutrients more available.

In the plant, silicon stengthens cell walls; <b>improving</b> <b>plant</b> strength, health, and productivity.

40|$|Abstract Root {{colonisation}} by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) can <b>improve</b> <b>plant</b> resistance/tolerance to biotic stresses. Although this bioprotection {{has been}} amply described in different plant systems, {{the underlying mechanisms}} remain largely unknown. Besides mechanisms such as <b>improved</b> <b>plant</b> nutrition and competition, experimental evidence supports the involvement of plant defence mechanisms in the observed protection. During mycorrhiza establishment, modu-lation of plant defence responses occurs upon recognition of the AMF {{in order to achieve}} a functional symbiosis. As a consequence of this modulation, a mild, but effective activation of the plant immune responses may occur, not only locally but also systemically. This activation leads to a primed state of the plant that allows a more efficient activation of defence mechanisms in response to attack by potential enemies. Mutually beneficial interactions between plants and microbes are frequent in nature. Common benefits for the <b>plant</b> are <b>improved</b> <b>plant</b> nutrition and/or increase...|$|R

50|$|The fungal genus, Trichoderma {{produces}} enzymes such as chitinases which {{degrade the}} cell walls of other fungi. They {{are able to}} detect other fungi and grow towards them, they then bind to the hyphae of other fungi using lectins on the host fungi as a receptor, forming an appressorium. Once this is formed, Trichoderma inject toxic enzymes into the host and probably peptaibol antibiotics, which create holes in the cell wall, allowing Trichoderma to grow inside of the host and feed. Trichoderma are able to digest sclerotia, durable structures which contain food reserves, which is important {{if they are to}} control pathogenic fungi in the long term. Trichoderma species have been recorded as protecting crops from Botrytis cinerea, Rhizoctonia solani, Alternaria solani, Glomerella graminicola, Phytophthora capsici, Magnaporthe grisea and Colletotrichum lindemuthianum; although this protection may not be entirely due to Trichoderma digesting these fungi, but by them <b>improving</b> <b>plant</b> disease resistance indirectly.|$|E
40|$|Nitrogen (N) {{limitation}} {{is one of}} the major constrain factors for biochar in <b>improving</b> <b>plant</b> growth, the same for elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2). Hence, we hypothesized that (1) biochar would induce the same plant responses as elevated CO 2 under N-poor conditions; (2) elevated CO 2 would decrease the potential of biochar application in <b>improving</b> <b>plant</b> growth. To test these hypotheses, we assessed the effects of pinewood biochar, produced at three pyrolytic temperatures (650, 750 and 850 °C), on C and N allocation at the whole-plant level of three plant species (Austrostipa ramossissima, Dichelachne micrantha and Isolepis nodosa) grown in the N poor mine spoil under both ambient (400 μL L− 1) and elevated (700 μL L− 1) CO 2 concentrations. Our data showed that biochar addition (1) significantly decreased leaf total N and δ 15 N (P < 0. 05); (2) decreased leaf total N and δ 15 N more pronouncedly than those of root; and (3) showed more pronounced effects on <b>improving</b> <b>plant</b> biomass under ambient CO 2 than under elevated CO 2 concentration. Hence, it remained a strong possibility that biochar addition induced the same plant physiological responses as elevated CO 2 in the N-deficient mine spoil.
