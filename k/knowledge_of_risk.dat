Sociodemographic and clinical data were obtained and <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> stroke <b>risk</b> factors (defined as the ability to mention at least one correct risk factor) was assessed using open-ended questionnaire. Data were treated with descriptive statistics and logistic regression analysis. Results. Sixty-nine stroke survivors (male = 72. 5 %; mean ± SD age = 49. 7 ± 10. 6 years) participated in the study. Thirty-four (49. 4 %) participants had <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> stroke <b>risk</b> factors.

50|$|In the retrial of {{the first}} case under the new conditions, Edell {{was not allowed to}} enter {{evidence}} claiming that Liggett & Myers had worked on the creation of a safer cigarette, as well as evidence regarding the tobacco industry’s “duty to warn” of the dangers of cigarette smoking, as the point became moot by the appellate court. Regardless of these setbacks, Edell strengthened his case with his access to 300,000 pages of internal documents of the tobacco companies. These documents included compelling and damaging evidence that the tobacco companies had proof, backed by research dating back to the 1940s, that nicotine was addictive and potentially carcinogenic. The tobacco industry unsuccessfully struggled to suppress the evidence {{on the grounds that it}} would divulge trade secrets; the trial court judge, Sarokin, ruled that the people and the court had the Constitutional right to know what the companies know. Though the tobacco industry appealed this ruling to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, which upheld the ruling, as well as the Supreme Court, which refused to hear the case, it was established that the evidence would be used in trial. Alongside the confidential tobacco industry documents, Edell argued that the powerful advertising for the brands Cipollone smoked was an unscrupulous strategy utilized by the tobacco industry to not only overshadow the warning labels mandated by the federal government, but also to promote cigarette use and nicotine addiction as a marketing strategy for company profit. Edell claimed that Cipollone’s tobacco use stemmed from her nicotine addiction, which was encouraged by the advertising of Liggett and Myers, Philip Morris, and Lorillard by the use of both health claims and deviously appealing advertising. Cipollone was portrayed as a woman who was disparaged by her powerful addiction to the tobacco industry’s product; expert testimony showed that she even displayed withdrawal symptoms, sometimes digging through “the trash for butts when she ran out of cigarettes”. After presenting his case that the tobacco industry’s advertising of cigarettes and <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> related to Cipollone’s claims, the defense moved for dismissal. The motion was denied.|$|E

Aim: To investigate if <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> factors for CHD, measured by a questionnaire, would show any relation to advice to compliance to lifestyle changes to attain treatment goals and adherence to drug therapy. Method: Men and women < 71 years who had had a cardiac event were screened consecutively (509) from the medical records. Responders (392) were interviewed, examined and received a questionnaire. Three hundred and forty-seven patients answered the questionnaire regarding their general <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> factors for CHD, compliance to lifestyle changes to attain treatment goals and adherence to drug therapy.

40|$|Background: As {{with many}} Indigenous peoples, smoking rates among Aboriginal Australians are {{considerably}} {{higher than those}} of the non-Indigenous population. Approximately 50 % of Indigenous women smoke during pregnancy, a time when women are more motivated to quit. Antenatal care providers are potentially important change agents for reducing the harms associated with smoking, yet little is known about their knowledge, attitudes or skills, or the factors associated with providing smoking cessation advice. Methods: This paper aimed to explore the <b>knowledge</b> and attitudes <b>of</b> health care providers caring for pregnant Australian Aboriginal women with regard to smoking risks and cessation; and to identify factors associated with self-reported assessment of smoking. A cross-sectional survey was undertaken with 127 staff providing antenatal care to Aboriginal women from two jurisdictions: the Northern Territory and New South Wales, Australia. Measures included respondents' estimate of the prevalence of smoking among pregnant women; optimal and actual assessment <b>of</b> smoking status; <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>risks</b> associated with antenatal smoking; <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> smoking cessation; attitudes to providing cessation advice to pregnant women; and perceived barriers and motivators for cessation for pregnant women. Results: The median provider estimate of the smoking prevalence was 69 % (95 %CI: 60, 70). The majority of respondents considered assessment of smoking status to be integral to antenatal care and a professional responsibility. Most (79 %) indicated that they assess smoking status in 100 % <b>of</b> clients. <b>Knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>risks</b> was generally good, but <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> cessation was poor. Factors independently associated with assessing smoking status among all women were: employer service type (p = 0. 025); cessation knowledge score (p = 0. 011); and disagreeing with the statement that giving advice is not worth it given the low level of success (p = 0. 011). Conclusions: Addressing <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> smoking <b>risks</b> and cessation counselling is a priority and should improve both confidence and ability, and increase the frequency and effectiveness of counselling.
