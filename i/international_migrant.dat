There are reports of undocumented Emiratis who, because of their inability to be recognized as full citizens, receive no government benefits and have no labour rights.

50|$|Treatment of {{migrants}} in host countries, both by governments, employers, and original population, {{is a topic}} of continual debate and criticism, and the violation of migrant human rights is an ongoing crisis.

40|$|<b>International</b> <b>migrants</b> {{sometimes}} {{decide to}} live in rural instead of in urban areas. These migrants can be clustered into different groups, e. g. amenity migrants, cross-border migrants, asylum seekers, training migrants and working migrants (seasonal and permanent). In rural areas in Germany, for example, in 2010 11. 1 per cent of the population had a migratory background (Statistisches Bundesamt 2011).

50|$|According to International Labour Organization, {{there exist}} {{frequent}} irregularities concerning these intermediaries (i.e., recruiters and agents in sending and receiving countries). Therefore, the inconsistencies, between regulations in source and destination countries, {{as well as}} loopholes in existing laws and regulations create opportunities for unscrupulous agencies to exploit the system. Intermediaries who provide services to facilitate the migration process have been indicated to be important perpetrators of exploitation of women migrant workers. Taking advantage of migrants’ desperation to find work, agents and employers {{have been accused of}} shifting the burden of recruitment fees, including airfare, visas, and administrative fees, on to the workers themselves, while employers pay a nominal fee. This creates a heavy debt burden on <b>international</b> <b>migrant</b> domestic workers. Many Indonesian domestic workers migrating to Persian Gulf countries take out loans from local moneylenders with interest rates as high as 100 percent to pay these fees, while those traveling to Asia typically use a “fly now, pay later” scheme. For example, in Singapore and Hong Kong, Indonesian migrant domestic workers often spend up to 10 months out of a two-year contract without a salary, since they must turn over these wages to repay their recruitment fees. The resulting financial pressure makes it difficult for workers to report abuse for fear of losing their jobs and having no way to pay off their debts. Experience has shown that bans on the recruitment and deployment of migrant workers, which often affect domestic workers disproportionally, are difficult to enforce and drive the recruitment process further underground. In addition, the extravagant fees charged by recruiting agencies and the weak legal system in the countries in question establish the path for non-registered recruiters and brokers to engage in trafficking of migrants for domestic work.|$|E

[...] One problem that this focus on agriculture causes in the Central Valley, especially the San Joaquin valley is the migratory patterns of its people both {{into and out of the}} valley. According to 2000 census data, the San Joaquin Valley saw a large in flux of roughly 20,000 immigrants with a high school diploma or less, and an out flux of approximately 3,000 persons with a college degree.

40|$|In {{order to}} provide an {{empirical}} insight {{into the role of}} <b>international</b> <b>migrant</b> remittance inflows in low-income countries, this paper examines at the macro level, the long-run impact of <b>international</b> <b>migrant</b> remittance inflows on overall human development in Sub-Saharan Africa which has been well-known as a perennial net exporter of labour to the industrialized world since the colonial era. The fixed-effects balanced annual panel data estimation procedure for the period, 1987 to 2007, on 18 Sub-Saharan African countries was used for the empirical analysis. The paper finds that, contrary to the apprehension of the remittance-pessimistic developmental school, <b>international</b> <b>migrant</b> remittance inflows have a significant positive long-run impact on overall human development in low-income Sub-Saharan African countries. This evidence suggests that the essential role of <b>international</b> <b>migrant</b> remittance inflows on the socioeconomic development of Sub-Saharan Africa should not be undervalued in formulating any contemporary economic development strategy for the sub-region. It is, therefore, recommended that governments of the sub-region should pursue remittance-attracting policy as one of the macroeconomic policies to stimulate human development in the long run. ...|$|E
