60|$|Roughly speaking, I {{should say}} that in England he who bothers about his hs is a fool, and he who ridicules a dropped h a snob. As to the {{interpolated}} <b>h,</b> <b>my</b> experience as a London vestryman has convinced {{me that it is}} often effective as a means of emphasis, and that the London language would be poorer without it. The objection to it is no more respectable than the objection of a street boy to a black man or to a lady in knickerbockers.|$|E
60|$|My Dear Augusta,--My Rochdale affairs are {{understood}} to be settled {{as far as the}} Law can settle them, and indeed I am told that the most valuable part is that which was never disputed; but I have never reaped any advantage from them, and God knows if I ever shall. Mr. <b>H.,</b> <b>my</b> agent, is a good man and able, but the most dilatory in the world. I expect him down on the 14th to accompany me to Rochdale, where something will be decided as to selling or working the Collieries. I am Lord of the Manor (a most extensive one), and they want to enclose, which cannot be done without me; but I go there in the worst humour possible and am afraid I shall do or say something not very conciliatory. In short all my affairs are going on as badly as possible, and I have no hopes or plans to better them as I long ago pledged myself never to sell Newstead, which I mean to hold in defiance of the Devil and Man.|$|E
