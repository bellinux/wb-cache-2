30|$|The data {{published}} by Althaus and Frischknecht (Table 5) {{seem to be}} in compliance with the Smart numbers. However, Althaus and Frischknecht modeled BEV twice the Smart's weight and even heavier. On the other hand, they based their life cycle <b>emissions</b> <b>evaluation</b> on Swiss electricity consumption. Swiss electricity GHG intensity is around 140 g CO 2 -eq/kWh (number for 2005 [37]), while in Germany, 563 g CO 2 /kWh (number for 2010, see above) must be taken into account. Lambrecht, Held as well as Held and Baumann [42] published larger climate change impacts. This is evident particularly for data extracted from Held and Baumann [42] based on a mini-class car quite comparable to the Smart. Since the carbon footprint we calculated for the Smart and Held and Baumann [42] calculated for a mini-class car (around 3 t CO 2) for the platform (glider) is nearly the same, the deviation is due to a higher electricity consumption of 18.7 kWh/ 100 km assumed by Held and Baumann [42].

The results indicate that liquid fuels derived from petroleum have Well-to-Tank efficiencies in the range of 75 - 85 % with liquefied petroleum gas being the most efficient fuel in the Well-to-Tank stage with 85 % efficiency. Electricity has the lowest efficiency of 20 % which is mainly attributed due to its dependence on coal and 25. 4 % losses during transmission and distribution. The complete Well-to-Wheels results show diesel vehicles to be the most efficient among all configurations, specifically the diesel-powered split hybrid electric vehicle. Hydrogen engine configurations are the least efficient due to low efficiency of production of hydrogen from natural gas. Hybridizing electric vehicles reduces the Well-to-Wheels greenhouse gas emissions substantially with split hybrid configuration being the most efficient. Electric vehicles do not offer any significant improvement over gasoline-powered configurations; however a shift towards renewable sources for power generation and reduction in losses during transmission and distribution can make it a feasible option in the future.

40|$|Personal {{transportation}} {{accounts for}} the majority of greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector, in particular, when international aviation is included, yet relatively {{little is known about the}} composition and socioeconomic makeup of travel emissions at the household and individual levels. Do they vary by choice of transportation mode, geographical location, socioeconomic factors, vehicle technology choice, and other personal characteristics and if so, by how much? This paper aims to shed some light on the profile of greenhouse gas emissions at the disaggregate level. It presents the results of a substantive case study, performed in the United Kingdom, based on a newly developed greenhouse gas <b>emissions</b> <b>evaluation</b> tool. When all known climate effects are accounted for, however uncertain they may be, air travel dominates overall as the source of greenhouse gas emissions from personal travel. There is a huge range in emissions, with the highest 20 % of emitters producing 61 % of emissions. This 61 % to 20 % emission rule is mirrored in the "hockey-stick" shape of the curves ranking respondents by their emissions levels, which is surprisingly similar when transportation modes, location, and unit of analysis (individual, household) are compared. Although income, working status, age, and car ownership are significantly related to overall emissions, factors related to accessibility, household location, and gender are not.

30|$|Consideration {{should be}} given to the time-dependency of GHG {{emissions}} factors used for the evaluation of operational GHG emissions resulting from the operation of pumps. As discussed in Greenhouse gas emissions factors, current research predominantly treats emissions factors used to calculate GHG emissions as a single, average value. The sources of electricity (see recommendation 1) need to be considered if the time-dependency of emissions factors is also to be considered. However, as discussed in Sources of electrical energy generation, {{there is a lack of}} consideration of the source(s) of electricity used for pumping. Both of these gaps mean that the GHG emissions associated with electricity usage are not being accurately evaluated, with little consideration being given to both the time and place of electricity usage. In reality, emissions factors fluctuate with time and location according to the contribution of different generation types supplying to the electricity grid. As discussed previously, the time-variability of electricity tariffs has been successfully used to reduce the cost of WDS operations. Similar to this, the modeling of time-variability of emissions factors could not only increase the accuracy of operational GHG <b>emissions</b> <b>evaluation,</b> but could allow pump operational strategies to be explored, using potential times of low emissions energy as a way to reduce GHG emissions without the necessity of reduced energy consumption. While emissions factors may be difficult to accurately model due to the complex nature of the electricity generation industry, they may be modeled using similar ideas to those employed for water demands. These could include diurnal curves for hourly fluctuations through the day; multipliers used to adjust the peaks for different times of the year; and predictions for future increases/decreases over the coming years and decades.|$|E

In the framework of the JRC scientific support to the Danube Strategy, the EDGAR modal shift initiative focuses on the <b>emissions</b> <b>evaluation</b> for ex-post modal shift scenarios, as a contribution to the Danube Air Nexus. Given the complexity of this topic, a methodology for the best use of the available information and expertise in the Danube Region has been developed and is presented in this report. This work is the outcome of the joint efforts of the JRC/EDGAR team, country emission experts and relevant institutions in the Danube Region. It shows that, in addition to the EDGAR data and gridding tool, the participation by and contributions of experts from the Danube Region is essential in compiling emissions from the transport sector and enriching knowledge of variations in national circumstances, on inland domestic and international shipping and by bringing details of ship and truck freight transport. Considering the transboundary characteristics of the transport sector, the EDGAR team developed a Web-based emissions gridding tool (EDGAR. ms) to be used by experts, institutions and authorities in the region to distribute emissions from road transport sector in a consistent manner. Emission experts from four countries (Hungary, Romania, Serbia and Croatia) tested the EDGAR. ms tool with their national data and this user friendly application is now available to all country emission experts in the Danube Region (upon request).

40|$|As {{part of the}} Diesel <b>Emissions</b> <b>Evaluation</b> Program (DEEP) consortium, Noranda Inc. has {{undertaken}} a field project to evaluate the overall performance of the latest diesel particulate filter technology (DPF) at its Brunswick Mine in Bathurst, New Brunswick. Performance of the filtration systems is evaluated {{with respect to their}} ability to reduce tailpipe emissions and concentrations of diesel particulate matter (DPM) and noxious gases in mine air, efficiency of filter regeneration process, maintenance requirements, reliability, and acceptance. Four different particulate filter systems deployed on heavy production vehicles are subjected to an 18 -month field evaluation. Over the evaluation period the vehicles will have accumulated approximately 4000 operating hours in production. This paper presents the results of testing conducted mid way through the 18 -month field trials. The 400 - meter section of the mine drift at 525 - 5 sub level, hereinafter referred to as the "isolated zone" was isolated between intake and exhaust fan systems and sealed with bulkheads against leakage. The isolated zone was ventilated at the rate required per CSA Standards and issued by CANMET for the engines tested. Four vehicles, two load-haul-dumps (LHDs) and two trucks, retrofitted with particulate filter systems were tested along with a new identical model LHD and truck equipped with exhaust systems consisting of a catalytic converter (DOC) and muffler. The test vehicles were operated individually inside the isolated zone for approximately 4 hours over simulated production duty cycles. Measurements of ambient concentrations of particulate matter, tailpipe emissions, and engine parameters were performed for each of the tested vehicles. The DPM samples for carbon were collected at the most up- stream end of the isolated zone, at the vehicle next to the operator, and at the most downstream or exhaust end of the isolated zone. The DPM samples were analyzed for total (organic and elemental) carbon using NIOSH Analytical Method 5040. Ambient concentrations of particulate matter at the exhaust end of the zone were also measured using Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer (SMPS), and real time PAH monitor (PAS 2000). Efficiency of the filters was also evaluated on a basis of tailpipe measurements performed using raw exhaust instruments the NanoMet and the UGAS. In addition, relevant engine parameters were obtained using Detroit Diesel Diagnostic Link (DDDL) and from exhaust backpressure and temperature measurements. Results from the tests proved conclusively that diesel particulate filters can significantly reduce the concentrations of air- borne DPM, but not without careful monitoring of both ambient and tailpipe emissions and not without careful attention with respect to maintaining the integrity of the DPF systems...|$|E
