5|$|Albert {{promoted}} {{many public}} educational institutions. Chiefly at meetings {{in connection with}} these <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>of</b> the need for better schooling. A collection of his speeches was published in 1857. Recognised as a supporter of education and technological progress, {{he was invited to}} speak at scientific meetings, such as the memorable address he delivered as president of the British Association for the Advancement of Science when it met at Aberdeen in 1859. His espousal of science met with clerical opposition; he and Palmerston unsuccessfully recommended a knighthood for Charles Darwin, after the publication of On the Origin of Species, which was opposed by the Bishop of Oxford.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{having been}} a public intellectual, Edward Said was an {{accomplished}} pianist, worked as the music critic for The Nation magazine, and wrote four books about music: Musical Elaborations (1991); Parallels and Paradoxes: Explorations in Music and Society (2002), with Daniel Barenboim as co-author; On Late Style: Music and Literature Against the Grain (2006); and Music at the Limits (2007) in which final tome <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>of</b> finding musical reflections of his literary and historical ideas in bold compositions and strong performances.|$|E
5|$|Flanders had {{a strict}} Congregationalist {{religious}} beginning, which evolved with his experience into {{a belief in}} “moral law.” He felt that “recognition of moral law {{is as much a}} necessary requirement of social achievement as physical law is of material advancement.” In Flanders’s view, moral law required honesty, compassion, responsibility, cooperation, humility, and wisdom—values that all cultures hold in common. For him it was an absolute standard. <b>He</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>of</b> a “Presence” or “daimon” that “renewed his courage” and “indicated direction” in everything he did.|$|E

5|$|In April 1858, Tubman was {{introduced}} to the abolitionist John Brown, an insurgent who advocated the use of violence to destroy slavery in the United States. Although she never advocated violence against whites, she agreed with his course of direct action and supported his goals. Like Tubman, <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>of</b> being called by God, and trusted the divine to protect him from the wrath of slaveholders. She, meanwhile, claimed to have had a prophetic vision of meeting Brown before their encounter.|$|E
5|$|Returning to the United States in 1970, Schwarzkopf {{was awarded}} a third Silver Star and a second Purple Heart for risking his life to protect the soldiers, as well as three Bronze Star Medals and a Legion of Merit for his command performance. Still, his {{experiences}} in Vietnam embittered him to U.S. foreign policy. Upon returning to the United States, <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>of</b> a wariness of future conflicts to author C. D. B. Bryan in 1971: He related these experiences under the assumed name of Lieutenant Colonel Byron Schindler.|$|E
5|$|Rosenberg left Hawaii on June 7, 1887, booking {{steerage}} class {{passage on}} the steamer Australia. Some reports state {{that he left}} owing to health issues, although others suggest that Rosenberg departed the island because {{he was concerned about}} political unrest. He left three weeks before the king signed the June Constitution. Rosenberg returned to San Francisco, but was hospitalized within a month of his return, and died on July 10, 1887. <b>He</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>of</b> King Kalākaua on his deathbed, whispering the king's name with his dying breath. He was buried at the cemetery of Congregation Sherith Israel in the San Francisco Peninsula; brief death notices were published in Hawaii- and San Francisco-based newspapers.|$|E

5|$|When he auditioned, Hertzberg had no {{idea what}} Adam would look like in full costume and make-up. Buffy used a company named Optic Nerve to build the {{materials}} to make Hertzberg look like a demonoid. Almost immediately after Hertzberg got the part, Optic Nerve sketched and sculpted Adam's appearance. They had Hertzberg come in to have molds made for prosthetic parts to fit his head and face, arms, chest, and legs, then he was fitted for contact lenses. They also created separate hands and a chest to film for close-up shots. Adam has a floppy disk drive mounted on his chest which, when used, had to be filmed without Hertzberg behind it. The entire construction of Adam's appearance took about two weeks. Hertzberg's voice was also modified post-production. When he saw the full Adam prosthetic and costume, his biggest concern was being able to show nuanced facial expressions under so much latex. It took hours to get Hertzberg into his full costume, but even after it was fully applied on set, often he would have to wait even longer before he went in front of the cameras. <b>He</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>of</b> the need to stay focused during all the waiting while sweating underneath everything he wore for the part.|$|E
5|$|Willkie {{spent much}} of 1943 {{preparing}} for a second presidential run, addressing Republican and nonpartisan groups. He did not meet with Roosevelt; with the presidential election approaching and with both men likely to run in it as candidates, their continued association would have been awkward. Although they differed with him on many issues, Republican leaders recognized Willkie's appeal and they had wanted him to campaign for the party in the 1942 midterm elections, but he went around the world instead. The huge publicity received by the titular head of the Republican Party as an emissary for a Democratic president frustrated leading Republicans. In spite of this, the Republicans gained seats in both the House and the Senate, though they still remained in the minority. Few Republican members of Congress were by then willing to support Willkie, and he dropped to second place behind General Douglas MacArthur in polls of likely voters in the party's 1944 presidential primaries. By 1943, even liberal Democrats did not doubt Willkie's progressive credentials. <b>He</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>of</b> appointing an African American to either the cabinet or the Supreme Court, and he warned California's Republican committee that the New Deal was irreversible and he stated that all they would get by opposing it was oblivion.|$|E
25|$|In 2017 <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>of</b> authorising now {{forbidden}} deep-Interrogation techniques {{during his}} time in Northern Ireland.|$|E

50|$|While Tai's art is {{seemingly}} {{filled with}} symbolic imagery, bearing social or political commentary, {{he claims he}} never consciously approaches a drawing {{with the intent of}} asserting his beliefs or opinions on viewers. <b>He's</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>of</b> his creative process spawning from an organic and authentic subconscious journey and that his creations manifest more by virtue of his own self-evaluation and less of propagating his ideology.|$|R

25|$|Within Japan, Koizumi {{pushed for}} new ways to {{revitalise}} the moribund economy, aiming to act against bad debts with commercial banks, privatize the postal savings system, and reorganize the factional structure of the LDP. <b>He</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>of</b> the need for a period of painful restructuring in order to improve the future.|$|E
25|$|During the 2015 general {{election}} campaign, David Cameron, then {{leader of the}} Conservative Party and Prime Minister, {{announced that he would}} not seek a third term; he was therefore expected to stand down before the following {{general election}}—at that time, expected to occur in 2020—although <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>of</b> serving a full term.|$|E
25|$|Al-Mas'udi {{was also}} very well {{informed}} about Byzantine affairs, even internal political events and the unfolding of palace coups. He recorded {{the effect of the}} westward migration of various tribes upon the Byzantines, especially the invading Bulgars. <b>He</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>of</b> Byzantine relations with western Europe. And, of course, he was attentively interested in Byzantine-Islamic relations.|$|E

25|$|But {{the police}} found that Petiot had no friends {{in any of}} the major Resistance groups. Some of the Resistance groups <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>of</b> had never existed, and there was no proof of any of his claimed exploits. Prosecutors {{eventually}} charged him with at least 27 murders for profit. Their estimate of his gains ran to 200 million francs.|$|E
25|$|Although sharia is {{not part}} of the British legal system, several British {{establishment}} figures have supported its use in areas of dispute resolution in Islamic communities. For example, in February 2008 Rowan Williams the Archbishop of Canterbury (the head of the Church of England) lectured at the Royal Courts of Justice on Islam and English Law. In this lecture <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>of</b> the possibility of using sharia in some circumstances.|$|E
25|$|Turner won the byelection, {{increasing}} the Conservative majority from 3,606 to 7,198. In his maiden speech, <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>of</b> {{the need for}} better supply of metals to the factories of his constituency. Later that year, Turner spoke on behalf of fellow former prisoners of war {{in support of a}} motion calling for compensation. He declared that he was lucky to survive, had never seen a bandage issued by the Japanese, and that prisoners had never received any Red Cross supplies.|$|E
