25|$|Indirect {{evidence}} for endothermy {{is provided by}} the body shape of derived ichthyosaurs, which with its short tail and vertical tail fin seems optimised for a high cruising speed that can only be sustained by a high metabolism: all extant animals swimming this way are either fully warm-blooded or, like sharks and tuna, maintain a high temperature in their body core. This argument does not cover basal forms with a more eel-like body and undulating swimming movement. In 1996, Richard Cowen, while accepting endothermy for the group, presumed that ichthyosaurs would have been subject to Carrier's constraint, a limitation to reptilian respiration pointed out in 1987 by David Carrier: their undulated locomotion forces the air out of the lungs and thus prevents them from taking breath while moving. Cowen hypothesised that ichthyosaurs would have overcome this problem by porpoising: constantly jumping out of the water would have allowed them to take a <b>gulp</b> <b>of</b> fresh air during each jump. Other researchers have tended to assume that for at least derived ichthyosaurs Carrier's constraint did not apply, because of their stiff bodies, which seems to be confirmed by their good diving capacity, implying an effective respiration and oxygen storage system. For these species porpoising was not a necessity. Nevertheless, ichthyosaurs would have often surfaced to breathe, probably tilting their heads slightly to take in air, because of the lower position of the nostrils compared to that of dolphins.|$|E

60|$|Charlotte gave a great <b>gulp</b> <b>of</b> disappointment, but the Pretty Lady {{suddenly}} wheeled {{around to}} face the Tall Lady, with quivering lips and tearful eyes.|$|E
60|$|She sniffed, {{and turned}} scornfully to her glass. George grinned and looked conscious; as he {{swallowed}} a <b>gulp</b> <b>of</b> whiskey it crackled in his throat. The sound annoyed the old lady.|$|E

60|$|Over on the {{embankment}} {{a child was}} crying; and the passionate screaming sound, broken by the <b>gulping</b> <b>of</b> tears, made her cover her lips, {{as though she had}} heard her own escaped soul wailing out there.|$|R
60|$|From a short {{distance}} up the trail came the unmistakable noises of the greedy feeding of a lion. The crunching <b>of</b> bones, the <b>gulping</b> <b>of</b> great pieces, the contented growling, all attested the nearness of the king at table.|$|R

60|$|For {{a single}} moment the new-comer stood as though turned to stone. There was a silence which was not without its curious {{dramatic}} significance. Then a light broke across the Professor's face. He gave a great <b>gulp</b> <b>of</b> relief.|$|E

5000|$|Mimagoniates is a genus of characid {{fish from}} {{rivers and streams}} in {{southern}} and eastern Brazil, northeastern Argentina and Paraguay. Commonly known as croaking tetra or chirping tetra because they can produce sounds, some of these fish were formerly included in Glandulocauda. They have a supplementary breathing organ located above the gills which makes a faint chirping sound when these fish come to the surface to gulp air. It also {{plays a role in}} courtship as the male chases and hovers near the female while taking <b>gulps</b> <b>of</b> air and expelling it to make a rhythmic noise. Croaking behavior may have evolved from a behavior called [...] "surface nipping", which occurs when the fish is searching for food. This <b>gulping</b> <b>of</b> air has no useful respiratory function.|$|R

60|$|The cook {{grinned at}} my {{exhibition}} of nerves, and thrust {{into my hand}} a steaming mug with an “’Ere, this’ll do yer good.” It was a nauseous mess,—ship’s coffee,—but the heat of it was revivifying.

60|$|He walked aimlessly {{backward}} and forward, chafing against the restraint {{of the narrow}} walls and the low ceiling. A sudden desire had seized him to fly back to the hills, wreathed in mist though they might be; to struggle on {{his way through the}} blinding rain, to drink down long <b>gulps</b> <b>of</b> his own purer, less civilized atmosphere.|$|R
60|$|His first {{overwhelming}} desire {{had been}} simply {{to escape from}} that enervating and perfervid atmosphere, to feel the morning air cool upon his forehead, to drink in great <b>gulps</b> <b>of</b> the fresh, windy sweetness.

60|$|Fresh water, as {{most people}} are aware, is {{composed}} of two gases--oxygen and hydrogen.

Let bathers think of it next time they swallow a <b>gulp</b> <b>of</b> sea water.|$|E
6000|$|This time {{he opened}} his eyes sharply, and looked up in my face. He {{swallowed}} a great <b>gulp</b> <b>of</b> surprise. His breath came and went.

60|$|So {{they made}} fire and boiled the moss till {{it was a}} horrible, sticky substance, which they {{swallowed}} as best they could, washing it down with <b>gulps</b> <b>of</b> water.

60|$|I lay {{that night}} at a little French town, and was kept awake by a man, somewhere in the hot, still darkness, howling aloud from the pain of his wounds. I was glad that he was alone, for when one man gives way the others {{sometimes}} follow. Yet the single note of misery was worse than the baying and <b>gulping</b> <b>of</b> a whole ward. I wished that a delegation of strikers could have heard it.|$|R

A coin gleams on her forehead. On her feet are jewelled toerings. Her ankles are linked by a slender fetterchain. Beside her a camel, hooded with a turreting turban, waits. A silk ladder of innumerable rungs climbs to his bobbing howdah. He ambles near with disgruntled hindquarters.

60|$|He did it, {{but he was}} not a very prepossessing looking object when he {{staggered}} out on deck twelve hours later, into the noon sunshine. The chair towards which he looked so eagerly was occupied. He scarcely knew himself whether that little <b>gulp</b> <b>of</b> acute feeling, which shot through his veins, was of relief or disappointment. While he hesitated, Wingrave raised his head.|$|E
6000|$|This flattered Verrian, but {{he would}} not allow its reasonableness. He took a <b>gulp</b> <b>of</b> coffee before saying, uncandidly, [...] "I can't make out what you're driving at, mother.

60|$|As he {{said nothing}} more, the jailer went away, and Bumpus, after heaving two or three very deep sighs, {{attempted}} to partake of his meagre breakfast. The effort was a vain one.

50|$|Earl Sylvester (Claude Akins), who {{considers}} himself Johnny's only friend, is devastated {{to learn of}} his death.

Johnny fell in love and planned to propose marriage after winning his next big race. However, Johnny's late nights with Sheila had left him disoriented from lack of sleep. His racing career ended with a fiery crash.|$|R
40|$|The acute {{toxicity}} of copper cyanide to the juveniles of Indian major carp Catla catla (2 ± 0. 5 cm) was evaluated under static renewal conditions. The concentrations of copper cyanide that killed 50 % of the carp fingerlings within 96 -h (96 -h LC 50) {{was found to}} be 0. 76 ± 0. 04 mg/L. Fishes exhibited abnormal swimming activity, followed by frequent gill flapping, loss <b>of</b> equilibrium, <b>gulping</b> <b>of</b> air, hyperactivity, convolutions. The respiratory rate of the fish got severely affected (- 63. 41 %± 0. 002) when exposed to copper cyanide. ...|$|R
40|$|Static bioassays {{were made}} to {{determine}} acute toxicity of premium motor spirit on poecilia reticulata.

The 96 LC 50 value of the oil for guppy was estimated as 1. 69 (1. 13 - 2. 43) mg L - 1. The fish exhibited behavioural changes in the form <b>of</b> aggression, rapid <b>gulping</b> <b>of</b> water, increased opercular movement and abnormal swimming movements.
