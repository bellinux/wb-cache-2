50|$|The LA 2 (ЛА-2) is a Carbine. The {{sample was}} {{designed}} by Izhevsk Machine-Building Plant A. I. Nesterovym in 1961 {{under the influence of}} plant competition for the AKM. The sample frame limited progress in its rearmost position of the cutting <b>insert</b> <b>receiver.</b> This allowed the elasticity of its walls to reduce the impact of hitting the moving parts in an extreme position on the tip-off weapon. Automatic mode shows improved shooting accuracy. Location of the return spring {{on the left side of}} the bolt allowed its height to be reduced along with the height of the arms in general. Shoe flies combine with the gas chamber, with a diopter sight fully posted on the cover of the receiver. A cleaning gas vent at the top of the gas chamber in the firing position is covered by a crane. Weight is reduced to 2.15 kg. Its prototype 1961 magazine capacity was 30 rounds with an effective range of 1,000 meters.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Recent {{studies showed}} the posibility of {{vestibular}} disorder in congenital hearing-impaired children. Our study {{was carried out}} to compare saccular function between children with congenital sensory-neural hearing loss and children with normal hearing. Materials and Methods: Thirty children with congenital profound sensory-neural hearing loss (mean age of 6. 93 yrs) and 30 ones with normal hearing (mean age 7. 18 yrs) were studied. Vestibular evoked myogenic potential (VEMP) test was recorded monaurally by 500 Hz tone burst stimululi via air conduction and <b>insert</b> <b>receiver.</b> Results: VEMP was recorded with mean threshold intensity level of 83. 60 dB in 53. 3 % of hearing-impaired children and 76. 64 dB {{in all of the}} children in control group. Regarding amplitude and latancy of response, {{there was a significant difference}} just in P 1 N 1 amplitude (P= 0. 015). In four cochlear implanted children, VEMP was not recorded. Motor delay and developmental disorderas were reported in neonatal history of 8 children that six of them had no VEMP. Conclusion: About the fifty percent of our children had no VEMP resulting from succular disorder and impairment of postural control and static balanc...|$|E
40|$|Background: Aging {{can cause}} loss of balance, which {{may lead to}} {{physical}} and psychological problems. As {{the role of the}} otolith organs in maintaining postural stability has been emphasized in recent years, the present study investigated the effect of aging on saccular function using cervical vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (cVEMP). Methods: The participants were assigned into two groups; group one included 31 young adults {{with a mean age of}} 22. 15 (range: 19 - 26 yr) and group two consisted of 31 old adults with a mean age of 69. 76 years (range: 61 - 79 yr). All participants hearing sensitivity was normal with no history of balance problems. VEMP was rec-orded for all subjects using tone burst 500 Hz stimuli at the threshold level and 95 dB nHL intensity level through air-conduction stimulation via an <b>insert</b> <b>receiver.</b> Results: There was a significant difference in the cVEMP response threshold (p< 0. 001), P 1 wave latency (p< 0. 001), P 1 /N 1 amplitude (p< 0. 001), and asymmetry ratio of P 1 /N 1 amplitude (p< 0. 05) between the two groups. No significant difference was found between the left and right ears or in N 1 wave latency between the two groups. Conclusion: VEMP abnormalities observed in healthy older adults showed the sensitivity of this test in identi...|$|E

40|$|Abstract [456], {{this paper}} {{summarizes}} the ongoing project of DAAD {{which stands for}} Dokuz Eylul Architectural Acoustic Design software. The demand {{for the use of}} computers in acoustic design has led to the rapid growth of the theory in this area and the increase of room acoustic software. DAAD, dealing with the exact calculation of the impulse response, aims to design an amendable acoustic simulation program by using basic modeling methods. The project focuses on to calculate acoustic parameters of large scale spaces like concert halls and auditorium that are given by ISO as well as 3 D modeling and visualization of the building. The project currently uses ray tracing method to achieve impulse response of the volume for the receiver and source points chosen by the user, and wave signals with room effects can also be heard. Moreover, DAAD is also capable to obtain impulse responses for the entire space by dividing the space into small cubes. This new method also helps to visualize the entire space respect to any acoustic parameters. DAAD calculates receiver’s size, which can be a spherical or cube shape, according to space volume and quantity of rays. Consequently, the program features the main characteristics of an acoustic simulation program that makes possible to calculate parameters by <b>inserting</b> <b>receivers</b> and sources or, dividing the space in to cubes. The results obtained from simulation experimentation using DAAD has been compared to some benchmarks of well-known concert halls such as Elmia, and has been found very close to real measurements. All the details of method used in DAAD end experimentation result is presented in detail...|$|R

Its slide and serial numbered frame <b>receiver</b> <b>inserts</b> are made from MIM (Metal Injection Molding) cast zinc alloy, its barrel consists of a rifled steel insert within a steel barrel sleeve, and its internal lockwork and fire-control parts are a combination of MIM cast steel and steel stampings.|$|R
5000|$|PPS wz. 43/52, a {{modified}} version of the PPS-43, known as the that replaced the folding metal stock with a fixed wooden buttstock. This was mounted to the receiver end plate using two <b>inserts</b> and the <b>receiver</b> take-down hook was bent downwards to accommodate the change. The buttstock has a compartment carved inside of it that contains a standard cleaning kit; the side of the butt has a sling loop. This modification was meant to increase the accuracy of the PPS submachine gun, but minimal gains in accuracy were offset by the increase in weight and size of the PPS wz. 43/52 in comparison to the original PPS-43.|$|R
50|$|The barrels can be {{exchanged}} rapidly, {{thanks to a}} barrel release button located {{on the left side}} of the weapon. The weapon is cleared first and then the button is held down, while the barrel's carrying handle is moved from the right side of the weapon to the center, unlocking it from the receiver. At this point, the button is released and the barrel is then pulled free of the receiver and placed to the side. The new barrel is <b>inserted</b> into the <b>receiver</b> and then the carrying handle is shifted to the right, locking it into place. Headspace is set by counting the clicks as the barrel is locked down and should be between two and seven clicks.|$|R

30|$|Directional OW links {{also have}} a low {{probability}} of intercept and detection compared to broadcast or less-directional RF wireless links. These are desirable attributes for certain applications, especially military communications, where the communicating parties need to remain undetectable by an adversary. In contrast to RF transmissions, where the adversary needs only a low complexity receiver to detect broadcast transmissions or the side-lobes of directional RF antennas, implementation of an OW link in a completely covert fashion requires fully optical pointing, acquisition and tracking without any adjunct RF technology from the third party. Thus, it is essentially impossible for the third party to detect {{the existence of the}} link, unless they <b>insert</b> their own <b>receiver</b> into the beam path. The security provided by the optical link is enhanced by means of encryption, which ultimately prevents interception of the actual data being transmitted.|$|R
50|$|The quick-change barrel {{used in the}} AUG is cold hammer-forged by GFM-GmbH of Steyr Austria for {{increased}} precision and durability, its bore, chamber and certain components of the gas system are chrome-plated. The standard rifle-length barrel features 6 right-hand grooves and a rifling twist rate of 228 mm (1:9 in). An external sleeve is shrunk on to the barrel and carries the gas port and cylinder, gas valve and forward grip hinge jaw. There is a short cylinder which contains a piston and its associated return spring. The barrel locks into a steel <b>insert</b> inside the <b>receiver</b> through a system of eight lugs arranged around the chamber end and {{is equipped with a}} folding, vertical grip that helps to pivot and withdraw the barrel during barrel changes.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) {{broadband}} wireless communication systems, employing orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) with cyclic prefix (CP) {{in combination with}} space-time-frequency block coding (STFBC). In order to exploit the benefits of OFDM and STFBC in highly frequency-selective channels, without incurring in a significant increase of receiver complexity, a channel shortening prefilter is <b>inserted</b> at the <b>receiver,</b> aimed at reducing {{the length of the}} MIMO channel impulse response before CP removal. Two MIMO channel shorteners are proposed, both relying on linearly-constrained minimization of the mean-output-energy of the signal at the output of the channel shortener, where the linear constraints are optimally chosen so as to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio either at the output of the channel shortener or at the input of the STFBC maximum-likelihood decoder. Unlike other solutions proposed in the literature, these shortening designs are blind ones, i. e., a priori knowledge of the MIMO channel impulse response to be shortened is not required, and can be carried out in closed-form, i. e., iterative computation of the prefilter weights is not necessary. Numerical simulations show that, without a substantial increase in computational complexity, receivers equipped with the proposed blind channel shorteners pay only a negligible performance penalty with respect to non-blind channel shorteners, while being significantly more robust to finite sample-size effects...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} design and build a low cost rotary {{regenerative}} adsorption air conditioning system using. monolithic carbon-ammonia in a multiple bed design; three single module configurations have been tested [...] The basic single module named MODULAR 1 - 0. 0 consists of stainless steel tube 12. 7 mm in diameter, wall thickness 0. 25 mm and 600 mm long and contains about 2. 6 mm layer of monolithic carbon (about 40 g). from WaterLink Sutcliffe Carbons Ltd. The {{far end of the}} module (about 230 mm long) is the evaporator-condenser (receiver).

50|$|The RPD is hammer {{fired from}} an open bolt, the hammer forming part of {{the rear of the}} bolt carrier (which is {{connected}} to the gas piston), which continues moving forward for a short distance after the round is chambered and the bolt locked, the hammer face then striking the rear of the free floating firing pin which passes through the length of the bolt. Locking occurs by means of lateral flaps located along the sides of the bolt, which are forced outwards (by the angled sides of the hammer) into recesses cut into the receiver body, after which firing occurs when the face of the hammer strikes the rear of the firing pin; the mechanism is simple, rugged and reliable, It features a trigger mechanism that is limited to fully automatic fire only. The bolt is equipped with a spring-loaded casing extraction system and a fixed <b>insert</b> inside the <b>receiver</b> housing which passes between the feed horns of the bolt serves as the ejector. Spent cartridge casings are ejected downward through an opening in the bolt carrier and receiver. The RPD has a manually operated lever-type safety mechanism that secures the weapon against accidental firing by blocking the bolt catch when engaged. Unlike Degtyarov's earlier firearm patents, the RPD's return spring is located inside the butt. Like many other rugged Russian-made firearms, the chamber and bore are chrome-lined, greatly decreasing the risk of corrosion and jamming.The weapon has a non-removable barrel with a 3-position gas adjustment valve used to control the performance of the gas system. It is also equipped with a folding integral bipod, wooden shoulder stock, foregrip and pistol grip. The firearm strips down into the following major groups: the receiver and barrel, bolt, bolt carrier, feed tray and feed cover, the recoil mechanism and the trigger group and stock.|$|R
