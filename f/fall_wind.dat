50|$|Mount Chortiatis or Hortiatis (Όρος Χορτιάτη, Χορτιάτης), {{known in}} Antiquity as Cissus or Kissos, is a {{mountain}} in Central Macedonia, Greece. It rises southeast of Thessaloniki, peaking at 1,201 metres. Besides {{the city of}} Thessaloniki, there are several suburbs and villages located on the foothills of Chortiatis, most notably Chortiatis and the affluent suburb of Panorama, both of them belonging in the Pylaia-Chortiatis municipality. The mountain's landscape is wooded, with part of these woods making up Thessaloniki's Seich Sou Forest National Park. A <b>fall</b> <b>wind</b> that occurs on the Thermaic Gulf was named after the mountain as well.|$|E
5000|$|A spore is {{the first}} growth stage of a {{developing}} gametophyte. When the spore capsule matures, ribbed bog moss's calyptra splits along the side, exposing spores. Release of the exposed spores requires dry weather and is governed by a row of [...] "teeth" [...] that ring the capsule's top. The capsule teeth are hygroscopic, bending outward when air is dry and permitting spores to <b>fall.</b> <b>Wind</b> disperses ribbed bog moss spores long distances by shaking the capsule. When air is moist, the teeth bend inward, holding the spores within the capsule. The spores require a moist substrate to germinate. A germinated spore develops into a protonema (a branched, threadlike structure). Rhizoids grow down from the protonema and penetrate the substrate. Stems arise from buds that develop on the protonema surface. As stems grow, they develop their own rhizoids and become independent of the protonema. Mature male and female stems develop antheridia and archegonia, which produce sperm and eggs, respectively. Ribbed bog moss antheridia do not develop synchronously on the same stem. Mature and immature antheridia are intermixed on individual male shoots; therefore, sperm cells on the same stem do not all develop at the same time. However, sperm cells within a single antheridium have synchronous development. Fertilization requires a moist or saturated environment. Before fertilization, the antheridium absorbs water and swells, forcing the spore cap off. Rain may splash sperm into the archegonium, or sperm may swim to the archegonium.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- Weather {{prediction}} is an ever challenging {{area of investigation}} for scientists. The Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) has been widely used for modeling different kinds of nonlinear systems including rainfall forecasting. Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS) combines the capabilities of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Fuzzy Inference Systems (FIS) to solve different kinds of problems, especially efficient in rainfall prediction. In this paper the application of artificial neural networks to predict the Weather of Delhi city has been proposed using knowledge base in the Neuro-Fuzzy Inference system. The weather parameters like minimum temperature, maximum temperature, relative humidity, sea level pressure, rain <b>fall,</b> <b>wind</b> speed, wind direction and sun shine etc. {{has been used for}} prediction. When performing weather predictive model the key criteria is always accuracy. We are trying to predict future weather condition based upon above parameters by Artificial Neural Network.

40|$|Snow {{damage to}} forests in Southern Finland in November 1991 is {{examined}} {{in relation to}} meteorological conditions. The combined effect of different factors proved to be necessary for severe damage. First, the snow load, in terms of precipitation, should exceed a certain limit. The limit can be set for weak or moderate damage at about 40 mm and for very severe damage at about 60 mm. Secondly, temperature {{at the time of}} precipitation should be above 0 °C, so that snow on twigs becomes slightly wet in order that it should attach to twigs during the subsequent period with temperature below 0 °C. On the other hand, temperatures exceeding 0. 6 °C prohibit damage by permitting the snow load to <b>fall.</b> <b>Wind</b> speeds exceeding 9 ms– 1, as observed 15 m above ground, were strong enough to dislodge the snow which is not attached, and thus reduce the damage. There are few statistics either of snow damage or of the relation between the snow damage and precipitation. However, there is a causal connection between snow damage and heavy snowfalls. Therefore, the regions with a high frequency of heavy snowfalls, as indicated by orographical features and occurrence of thick snow cover, were investigated...|$|E
40|$|Roofs are {{construction}} elements {{which form}} {{the upper part}} of a building and protect it from the all kinds of <b>fall</b> <b>wind</b> and sun lights. They are made as inclined or terrace shaped according to the climatic characteristics of the area they are located and their intended use. Inclined type roofs are preferred for aesthetic and or functionality. It is in interest of mechanical engineering that falling snow on long and effective regions of winter conditions accumulate on the roof surfaces with low inclination due to adhesion force between snowflakes and the roof covering. The mass of snow that turns into ice due to cold weather and wind creates stalactites in the eaves due to gravity. This snow mass leavesbreaks off from inclined surfaces due to the effect of the sun or any vibration and can damage to people or other objects around the building. Falling snow and ice masses from rooftops in urban areas where winter months are intense are also a matter for engineering applications of landscape architecture. In order to prevent snow and icing on the roofs of the buildings located especially in busy human and vehicle traffic routes the use of heating cables is a practical method. The icing can be prevented by means of the heating cables selected according to the installed power to be calculated based on the type of roof and the current country. The {{purpose of this study is}} to introduce heating systems to be mounted on the roofs with a lesser workmanship in a short period instead of difficulties and costs that would occur by increasing the roof inclination in present buildings as well as explaining their working principles...|$|E

40|$|Heterotrophic {{bacterial}} {{abundance and}} production, dissolved {{free amino acid}} (DFAA) and dissolved combined amino acid (DCAA) concentrations, and other microbial parameters were determined for seawater samples collected at a fixed station (maximum water depth, 56 m) deployed on the Chukchi Sea Shelf, in the western Arctic Ocean, during a 16 -day period in September 2013. During the investigation period, the sampling station experienced strong winds and a subsequent phytoplankton bloom, which {{was thought to be}} triggered by enhanced vertical mixing and upward nutrient fluxes. In this study, we investigated whether bacterial and dissolved amino acid parameters changed in response to these physical and biogeochemical events. Bacterial abundance and production in the upper layer increased with increasing chlorophyll a concentration, despite a concomitant decrease in seawater temperature from 3. 2 °C to 1. 5 °C. The percentage of bacteria with high nucleic acid content during the bloom was significantly higher than that during the prebloom period. The ratio of the depth-integrated (0 – 20 m) bacterial production to primary production differed little between the prebloom and bloom period, with an overall average value of 0. 14 ± 0. 03 (± standard deviation, n = 8). DFAA and DCAA concentrations varied over a limited range throughout the investigation, indicating that the supply and consumption of labile dissolved amino acids were balanced. These results indicate that there was a tightly coupled, large flow of organic carbon from primary producers to heterotrophic bacteria during the fall bloom. Our data also revealed that bacterial production and abundance were high in the bottom nepheloid (low transmittance) layer during strong wind events, which was associated with sediment resuspension due to turbulence near the seafloor. The impacts of <b>fall</b> <b>wind</b> events, which are predicted to become more prominent with the extension of the ice-free period, on bacterial processes and the dynamics of organic matter in the Chukchi Sea Shelf could have far-reaching influences on biogeochemical cycles and ecosystem dynamics in broader regions of the Arctic Ocean...|$|E
40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Electrical and Computer EngineeringSanjoy Das and Anil PahwaBecause a {{majority}} of day-to-day activities rely on electricity, it {{plays an important role}} in daily life. In this digital world, most of the people’s life depends on electricity. Without electricity, the flip of a switch would no longer produce instant light, television or refrigerators would be nonexistent, and hundreds of conveniences often taken for granted would be impossible. Electricity has become a basic necessity, and so any interruption in service due to disturbances in power lines causes a great inconvenience to customers. Customers and utility commissions expect a high level of reliability. Power distribution systems are geographically dispersed and exposure to environment makes them highly vulnerable part of power systems with respect to failures and interruption of service to customers. Following the restructuring and increased competition in the electric utility industry, distribution system reliability has acquired larger significance. 	Better understanding of causes and consequences of distribution interruptions is helpful in maintaining distribution systems, designing reliable systems, installing protection devices, and environmental issues. Various events, such as equipment failure, animal activity, tree <b>fall,</b> <b>wind,</b> and lightning, can negatively affect power distribution systems. Weather is one of the primary causes affecting distribution system reliability. Unfortunately, as weather-related outages are highly random, predicting their occurrence is an arduous task. To study the impact of weather on overhead distribution system several models, such as linear and exponential regression models, neural network model, and ensemble methods are presented in this dissertation. The models were extended to study the impact of animal activity on outages in overhead distribution system. Outage, lightning, and weather data for four different cities in Kansas of various sizes from 2005 to 2011 were provided by Westar Energy, Topeka, and state climate office at Kansas State University weather services. Models developed are applied to estimate daily outages. Performance tests shows that regression and neural network models are able to estimate outages well but failed to estimate well in lower and upper range of observed values. The introduction of committee machines inspired by the ‘divide & conquer” principle overcomes this problem. Simulation results shows that mixture of experts model is more effective followed by AdaBoost model in estimating daily outages. Similar results on performance of these models were found for animal-caused outages...|$|E
40|$|Air {{bubbling}} systems prevent {{ice formation}} {{on the surface}} of a body of water because the warm water at depth can be brought to the surface by rising air bubbles. The amount of heat available in the water must be known to calculate the thermal reserve. Lake temperatures are largely controlled by convection overturning, but fresh water has a maximum density at 39. 2 degrees F which affects circulation and the resulting temperature. Canada's lakes are mostly of the temperate type and therefore have two turnover periods, in spring and in <b>fall.</b> <b>Wind</b> action is also very important. River water temperatures are nearly the same throughout because of mixing. Although sea water air bubbling systems have been used, careful studies must be made to ensure ice can be melted by this method. Maximum density does not occur at 39. 2 degrees F, hence convection mixing may occur until ice forms at the surface. To design an air bubbling system to prevent ice formation the thermal regime of the fresh water body and its surroundings must be known. The area of influence of each jet {{and the size of the}} hole must also be known. Design studies so far have been mostly empirical. No engineering procedure has been developed. Some experimental studies have been reported and details are given of the flow patterns of various orifices for use in ice prevention at the Grand Coulee Dam. Work needs to be carried out on how the heat stored at depth under an ice surface can be used efficiently to prevent further ice growth.
