The invention further relates to a method for deep drawing a workpiece (4) with a deep drawing die (1), wherein a workpiece (4) is inserted between a top die and a bottom die (2, 3) and deep drawn by closing the top and bottom dies (2, 3), and wherein at least one actuator (8) is controlled to generate a holding force during deep drawing. Essentially, the invention presented controls the flange feed of a workpiece (4) in the tool (1) by pressure distributions which are adjustable in the forming process. By selectively increasing forces in the flange feed at selected locations between holding down clamp (2 a) and <b>die</b> <b>plate</b> (3 a) it is possible to control the flow of material into the <b>die</b> <b>plate</b> (3 a) during deep drawing. Using this control, it is possible to relieve the load on regions with high deforming work, so that tears or cracks at these points in the finished component can be prevented. This involves increasing the friction between <b>die</b> <b>plate</b> (3 a) and plate (4) or between plate (4) and holding down clamp (2 a) by generating holding forces, as a result of which the material is held fast and prevented from flowing at this location...|$|E

The Collaborative Research Centre SFB/TR 39 PT-PIESA is {{developing}} mass production technologies and process chains for the fabrication of aluminium piezo composites, {{which can be}} used as raw material for "smart sheet metal " [1]. Microstructuring by forming is a challenging task con-cerning material flow, tool and process design [2].

The formed microstructure consists of ten parallel primary cavities with cross sections of 0. 3 0. 3 mm 2 and four larger secondary cavities which are surrounding the primary cavities. High demands are made concerning precision and reproducibility of the cavities ' geometry according to the function of the cavities, which is to serve as collets for sensitive piezo rods.

40|$|The {{demand of}} joining {{dissimilar}} materials is increasing in several industries with growing need for lightweight design solutions. The increasing environmental concerns, cost reduction and low fuel consumption requirement in transport industries {{are pushing the}} need for optimized structural components integrating multiple materials, where polymer-based components and aluminium alloys play an important role. With the limitations that exist, with the currently available joining processes, to join polymers and composite to metals, the work presented here aims at introducing the development and evaluation of a new efficient solution for joining these materials. Two new dissimilar material joining process, Through Hole Extruded – Friction Spot Welding (THE-FSpW) and Through Hole Extruded – Friction Stir Spot Welding (THE-FSSpW), are implemented and tested in joining polymer to aluminium alloy. These two processes share the same concept. The concept is the utilization of a rigid thin extrusion <b>die</b> <b>plate</b> positioned in the middle an overlapped joint formed by aluminium alloy plate over the polymer. This extrusion <b>die</b> <b>plate</b> {{has at least one}} through-hole (or slot). The metallic component will be pushed through the hole in THE-FSpW (or slot, in THE-FSSpW) into the polymer component, by a non-consumable, rigid rotating tool. The stirred visco plasticized aluminium that is forced to pass {{through the hole in the}} extrusion <b>die</b> <b>plate</b> will flow into the polymer forming a hook. Mechanical locking and adhesive bonding mechanism are achieved in between these dissimilar materials forming the joint. This new solution has distinct benefits in comparison with the existent alternatives and arrives in a moment when the perceived need, and market, for these metal-to-polymer joints is growing. The tested metals are AA 5754 -H 111 and AA 2024 -T 351 with 6 mm thick. The polymers are plates with a thickness of 10 mm, made of PEEK and Polyamide 6. The rigid thin extrusion <b>die</b> <b>plate</b> is AISI 316 with 1 mm thick. The implementation of these two solid-state joining process involved: tool design, development of experimental setup and process parameters. Tool design and development of experimental setup have a critical role in the application of any solid-state joining process. The influence of process parameters on joint hook geometry is studied, and a set of optimal parameters is established for the tested base materials. To analyze the joint, mechanical, microstructural and geometrical tests are conducted. For both processes, the joint formation was repeatable and controllable. From the analysis of both joining processes the THE-FSSpW process shown better joint hook geometry with an average thickness of 1. 9 mm, delivering a tensile shear load bearing capacity of 7. 3 kN. The hook from THE-FSpW process presented an average thickness of 1. 4 mm, and the joint reached a tensile shear load bearing capacity of 2. 3 kN...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Thermoplastic {{composite}} manufacturing {{is often}} difficult due to high viscosity of the matrix materials. Coupling {{a high level of}} mechanical properties with simple, low-cost processing technique is a difficult subject, but an important task for any state-of-the-art impregnation processes. In this paper, Thermoplastic Prepreg Fabrication Technology is utilized to prepare thermoplastic tapes and the technology's effect on strain energy absorption was investigated. The tape was prepared under three categories: first, with induced vibration and no fiber preheat (NV), second, without vibration and fiber preheat (HN) and last, with both fiber preheat and vibration (HV). For the purpose of comparison, all other variables such as pulling speed, fiber tension, fiber preheat and processing temperature were kept constant. The HV category showed improvement in the strain energy absorption by 10 and 23 % when compared to HN and NV, respectively. In addition, HV had better wetting, fiber spread and dispersion. Fiber preheating is important as it worked well with vibration possibly due to good fiber spread on the HV category (widest tape). Also, HV had the least fiber volume fraction as it takes more matrix volume when exiting the <b>die</b> <b>plate...</b>|$|E

If the design is not accurate then defects will occur in the manufactured product; small mistakes in designing a product makes the manufactured product useless so more amount time is allotted for designing a new product (or) for modifying the existed design. In this work {{the use of a}} software namely Pro/E for designing a progressive die to manufacture washer for the M 12 bolt has been incorporated. A progressive die is a multiple station die. In this work authors have designed a progressive die which has two stages of operation. The former operation is piercing and is followed by blanking. In both operations a finite volume of metal is removed from the sheet metal. If the final product happens to be removed portion then the operation is blanking, on other hand if pierced sheet metal is the final product then the operation is piercing. Both the operations are performed simultaneously in a single stroke of press, thus enabling the user to obtain the final product in a single stroke. This design procedure can also be extended for manufacturing washers for M-series bolts by modifying the punch and <b>die</b> <b>plate</b> dimensions.

40|$|Abstract. As {{customer}} requirements are continuously growing {{in connection with}} up-to-date castings, {{it is essential for}} firms interested in the international market to use modern fittings and instruments, which serve for high quality controls, even for manufacture control within each manufacturing process. For example, the thermo camera is such a measuring instrument we can use for measuring the thermo loss of the furnace, concluding to the inadequately insulating parts, or can even make the thermo profile of the surface of the die. In our work, we were analysing the temperature distribution of the die surface by using a thermo camera, during the manufacture of aluminium casting of automotive industry made by high pressure die casting technology. In pressure die casting, spraying the surface of the casting die with detaching material is a really important technological step, and spraying time – as a part of cycle time influencing productivity – is a very significant parameter. The main functions of spraying include cooling the hot surfaces of die halves, lubrication of the moving parts and helping the ejection of the casting. During our analyses we changed the spraying time of the die, and we took temperature distribution photographs of the stationary <b>die</b> <b>plate</b> by a thermo camera.

Jiaxing belongs to the delta {{with a population of}} 4.5 million, where heavy metal is one of the potentially important environmental issues. Many industrialized processes including <b>dying,</b> <b>plating,</b> and tanning give rise to the contamination by heavy metals, such as cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg) and lead (Pb) in soil, water and air (Huang et al. 2013). Busy land and water transportation in the Great Canal are also an important input source for the stream network. Urban runoff caused by rainfall on city dusts is one of the primary pathways of heavy metal into the stream network, and the narrow land/water boundaries, absence of buffer zones, and ineffective street cleaning methods contribute to the heavy metal inputs to the stream network (Zhao et al. 2009). Jiaxing has no mountain reservoir for water source and has to take drinking water from river network. Although considerable efforts have been made to control the pollution in the city’s stream network, some of the drinking water in the network remains polluted owing to the complex conditions in the study area, thus threatening water safety in the region (Yin et al. 2010).|$|R
