40|$|Abstract Background Coronary artery bypass <b>graft</b> (CABG) {{surgery is}} the {{standard}} of care {{in the treatment of}} advanced coronary artery disease, and its long-term results are affected by the failure of bypass <b>grafts.</b> The aim {{of the present study was}} to evaluate the early patency rate in coronary bypass <b>grafts.</b> Methods A total of 107 consecutive patients who underwent CABG were included in this study. Early <b>graft</b> patency was evaluated via computed tomography (CT) angiography in the first week after surgery. Results There were a total of 366 <b>grafts,</b> comprised of 250 venous <b>grafts</b> and 116 arterial <b>grafts.</b> Multi-slice CT detected acute <b>graft</b> occlusions in 32 (8. 7 %) of all the <b>grafts,</b> including 26 (10 %) of the 250 venous <b>grafts</b> and 6 (5 %) of the 116 arterial <b>grafts.</b> The patency rates obtained were 97. 3 % for the left internal mammary (IMA) <b>grafts,</b> 50 % for the radial artery <b>grafts,</b> and 50 % for the right IMA <b>grafts.</b> Additionally, 107 (96. 4 %) <b>grafts</b> to the left anterior descending artery (LAD) were classified as patent, whereas 1 (30 %) of the 3 <b>grafts</b> in the left circumflex (LCX) region and 1 (50 %) of the 2 <b>grafts</b> in the right coronary artery (RCA) territory were found to be occluded. In the venous category, 8 (13. 7 %) of the 58 <b>grafts</b> to LAD were found to be occluded. In the LCX region, 9 (8. 5 %) of the 106 <b>grafts</b> were classified as occluded, while the remaining 97 (91. 5 %) <b>grafts</b> were patent. The venous <b>grafts</b> to RCA were occluded in 9 (10. 4 %) of the 86 <b>grafts.</b> Amongst the multiple preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative factors, pump time was significantly longer in the patients with occluded <b>grafts</b> than in those with patent <b>grafts</b> (P = 0. 04).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether the type of <b>graft</b> material and bacteria involved in an infrainguinal arterial anastomotic infection can be used as guidelines for <b>graft</b> preservation. Between 1972 and 1990, the authors treated 35 anastomotic infections involving a common femoral or distal artery. The <b>graft</b> material was Dacron in 14 patients, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) in 14, and vein in 7. Of the 14 Dacron <b>grafts,</b> immediate <b>graft</b> excision was required for overwhelming infection in eight patients (bleeding in five, sepsis in three) and for an occluded <b>graft</b> in one patient. Three of five patients failed attempted <b>graft</b> preservation because of nonhealing wounds. Thus, 12 of the 14 Dacron <b>grafts</b> ultimately required <b>graft</b> excision. Of the 21 "smooth-walled" vein and PTFE <b>grafts,</b> 10 required immediate <b>graft</b> excision for occluded <b>grafts</b> (five PTFE, one vein) or bleeding (three PTFE, one vein). Ten of the remaining 11 (91 %) patients with patent "smooth-walled" <b>grafts,</b> intact anastomoses, and absence of sepsis managed by <b>graft</b> preservation healed their wounds and maintained distal arterial perfusion. Wound cultures grew pure gram-positive cocci in 17 of 21 "smooth-walled" <b>graft</b> infections versus 8 of 14 Dacron <b>graft</b> infections. In the absence of systemic sepsis, <b>graft</b> preservation is the treatment of choice for gram-positive infections involving an intact anastomosis of patent PTFE and vein <b>grafts.</b> Regardless of the bacterial cause, the authors recommend that any infrainguinal anastomotic infection of a Dacron <b>graft</b> be treated by immediate excision of all infected <b>graft</b> material...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Cylindrical <b>grafts</b> are {{currently}} {{used to cover}} defected area in mosaicplasty. However, there are some difficulties with cylindrical <b>grafts,</b> such as potential dead space between <b>grafts</b> and insufficient coverage. Hexagonal <b>graft</b> (honeycomb model) was created and evaluated in this biomechanical study. Hypothesis was that harvesting <b>grafts</b> with hexagonal shape, which has the best volume geometry characteristics in nature, would be biomechanically advantageous and provide superior pull-out strength. Methods: Total of 24 fresh calf femurs were divided into 3 equal groups. In the first group, 1 cylindrical and 1 hexagonal <b>graft</b> were compared. Second group consisted of 3 cylindrical and 3 hexagonal <b>grafts.</b> Third group was designed to evaluate effect of <b>graft</b> depth; hexagonal <b>graft</b> implanted at 5  mm depth was compared with 20 -mm-deep hexagonal <b>graft.</b> All specimens were subjected to pull-out test. Friction field and <b>graft</b> surface area were also evaluated. Results: Pull-out strength comparison of 15 -mm-deep triple cylindrical <b>grafts</b> and 15 -mm-deep triple hexagonal <b>grafts</b> in second group revealed statistically significant difference in favor of hexagonal <b>grafts</b> (p <  0. 05). Surface area of cylindrical <b>graft</b> with 9 -mm diameter was calculated to be 50. 27  mm 2, while hexagonal <b>graft</b> surface area was 55. 425  mm 2. Volume ratio of cylindrical and hexagonal <b>grafts</b> was 753. 98  mm 3 and 831. 375  mm 3, respectively. Conclusion: This biomechanical study demonstrated that <b>graft</b> geometry, especially in multiple <b>graft</b> applications, is a factor that influences stability. Hexagonal <b>grafts</b> {{appear to be more}} stable than cylindrical <b>grafts</b> in multiple applications, and they may be used to cover a larger defected area...|$|R

40|$|Background. Small-for-size liver <b>grafts</b> have {{decreased}} survival compared to full-size <b>grafts.</b> This study investigated mechanisms of suppression of liver regeneration in small-for-size <b>grafts.</b> Methods. Rat liver explants were reduced {{in size to}} 50 % and implanted into recipients of different body weights, resulting in <b>graft</b> weight/standard liver weights of 50 % (half-size) and 25 % (quarter-size). Results. Hepatic cellular 5 -bromo- 2 -deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation increased from 0. 2 %after shamoperation to 2 %, 18 %, and 1. 2 % in full-size, half-size, and quarter-size <b>grafts,</b> respectively. <b>Graft</b> weight did not increase in full- and quarter-size <b>grafts</b> but increased 40 % in half-size <b>grafts.</b> By contrast, apoptosis remained low (0. 7 %) and stem cells did not increase in all conditions. Phospho-c-Jun increased 27 -fold in half-size <b>grafts</b> but only sevenfold in quarter-size <b>grafts.</b> Activating protein- 1 activation increased 14 -fold in half-size <b>grafts</b> but only fivefold in quarter-size <b>grafts.</b> Cyclin D 1 (CyD 1), which was barely detectable in full- and quarter-size <b>grafts,</b> increased 8. 3 -fold in half-size <b>grafts.</b> Adenosine 5 -triphosphate (ATP) per gram tissue decreased 70 % in quarter-size <b>grafts.</b> Treatment of quarter-size <b>grafts</b> with radical scavenging C. sinenesis polyphenols (20 g/ml) increased BrdU labeling and weight gain to 35 % and 56 %, respectively, reversed inhibition of CyD 1 expression, c-Jun phosphorylation, and AP- 1 activation in quarter-size <b>grafts</b> compared to half-size <b>grafts,</b> and restored ATP levels to 75 %. Conclusions. Liver regeneration is stimulated in half-size <b>grafts</b> but suppressed in quarter-size <b>grafts.</b> Defective liver regeneration in small <b>grafts</b> is associated with an inhibition of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase/c-Jun and CyD 1 pathways and compromised energy production...|$|R

Material and methodSilyl-heparin–bonded carbon-coated expanded polytetrafluoroethylene vascular <b>grafts</b> (Bard Peripheral Vascular, Tempe, Ariz), were evaluated for patency and platelet deposition 2 hours, 7 days, and 30 days after <b>graft</b> implantation in a canine bilateral aortoiliac artery model. Platelet deposition was determined by injection of autologous, 111 Indium-radiolabeled platelets, followed by a 2 -hour circulation period prior to <b>graft</b> explantation. Histologic studies were performed on a 2 -mm longitudinal strip of each <b>graft</b> (7 -day and 30 -day groups). Heparin activity of the explanted silyl-heparin <b>grafts</b> was determined by using an antithrombin-III based thrombin binding assay. ResultsOverall chronic <b>graft</b> patency (7 -day and 30 -day groups) was 100 % for the silyl-heparin bonded (16 / 16) <b>grafts</b> versus 68. 75 % for control (11 / 16) <b>grafts</b> (P =. 043). Acute 2 -hour <b>graft</b> patency was 100 % for the silyl-heparin bonded (6 / 6) <b>grafts</b> versus 83. 3 % for control (5 / 6) <b>grafts.</b> Radiolabeled platelet deposition studies revealed a significantly lower amount of platelets deposited on the silyl-heparin <b>grafts</b> as compared with control <b>grafts</b> in the 30 -day group (13. 8 ± 7. 18 vs 28. 4 ± 9. 73, CPM per cm 2 per million platelets, mean ± SD, P =. 0451, Wilcoxon rank sum test). In the 2 -hour group of dogs, a trend towards a lower deposition of platelets on the silyl-heparin <b>grafts</b> was observed. There {{was no significant difference}} in platelet deposition between the two <b>grafts</b> in the 7 -day group. Histologic studies revealed a significant reduction in intraluminal <b>graft</b> thrombus present on the silyl-heparin <b>grafts</b> as compared with control <b>grafts</b> in the 30 -day group of animals. In contrast, there was no difference in amount of <b>graft</b> thrombus present on both <b>graft</b> types in the 7 -day group of dogs. Pre-implant heparin activity on the silyl-heparin bonded <b>grafts</b> was 2. 0 IU/cm 2 (international units[IU]/cm 2). Heparin activity remained present on the silyl-heparin <b>grafts</b> after explantation at all 3 time points (2 hours: above upper limit of assay, upper limit = 0. 57, n = 6; 7 days: 0. 106 ± 0. 015, n = 5; 30 days: 0. 007 ± 0. 001, n = 5; mean ± SD, IU/cm 2). ConclusionSilyl-heparin bonding onto carbon-coated expanded polytetrafluoroethylene vascular <b>grafts</b> resulted in (1) improved <b>graft</b> patency, (2) increased in vivo <b>graft</b> thromboresistance, and (3) a significant reduction in intraluminal <b>graft</b> thrombus. This <b>graft</b> may prove to be useful in the clinical setting. AbstractClinical relevanceExpanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) remains the most commonly used prosthetic <b>graft</b> material in infrainguinal arterial reconstructions. Reported long-term patency rates of ePTFE bypass <b>grafts</b> are inferior to those observed with autogenous vein. Modification of the luminal surface of ePTFE bypass <b>grafts</b> may prevent early <b>graft</b> failure and ultimately improve long-term <b>graft</b> performance. Silyl-heparin is a biologically active heparin analog that is readily adsorbed onto hydrophobic surfaces while retaining its anticoagulant properties.

Variations in surgical procedure that could potentially affect the <b>graft</b> force patterns were quantified. <b>Graft</b> force {{as a function of}} knee-flexion angle was measured with the <b>graft</b> in the neutral, untwisted position and repeated with the tibial bone block rotated externally or internally by 180 degrees. In eight of the 15 knees, external twisting of the <b>graft</b> reduced the maximal <b>graft</b> force to 50 %. However, in five knees the forces in extension increased by twisting to a maximum of 300 %. Of the surgical variables, only the femoral tunnel position appeared to have a consistent effect on the <b>graft</b> force pattern. Due to the unpredictable effect of <b>graft</b> twisting, a general recommendation on whether the <b>graft</b> should be twisted, and if so, in which direction, cannot be given. Intraoperatively, <b>graft</b> twisting may however be considered in every individual knee to modulate the <b>graft</b> force as a function of flexion angle. (C) 2004 Orthopaedic Research Society.

40|$|A novel {{technique}} for saphenous vein (SV) <b>graft</b> harvesting, the No-touch technique (NT), {{has been developed}} at the Dept. of Cardiovascular surgery, Örebro University hospital. With NT the SV is harvested with a pedicle of surrounding tissue. This avoids <b>graft</b> spasm and {{eliminates the need for}} distension. The surrounding tissue acts as a structural support and is a rich source of vaso-dilating agents. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) has shown a significantly higher patency rate for NT SV <b>grafts</b> compared to SV <b>grafts</b> harvested with conventional technique (CT). This thesis evaluates some of the properties of the surrounding tissue and compares patency rates between NT SV and radial artery (RA) <b>grafts</b> and patency rates for internal thoracic artery (ITA) <b>grafts</b> harvested with and without surrounding tissue. Paper I investigated vasa vasorum (VV) in SV <b>grafts</b> and showed that the NT preserves an intact VV whereas CT does not. This {{could be one of the}} mechanisms underlying the improved patency for NT SV <b>grafts.</b> Paper II evaluated VV and associated nitric oxide (NO) in SV and arterial <b>grafts.</b> SV <b>grafts</b> showed a higher number and larger VV, which correlated with NO production, compared to arterial <b>grafts.</b> NT SV <b>grafts</b> showed higher activity for e-NOS compared to CT SV <b>grafts.</b> Paper III is a RCT comparing patency rates between NT SV and RA <b>grafts,</b> three years after surgery, showing a significantly higher patency rate for NT SV <b>grafts.</b> Paper IV is a RCT comparing patency rates for ITA <b>graft</b> harvested with and without surrounding tissue and did not show any difference between <b>graft</b> preparations. In conclusion, the NT for SV <b>graft</b> harvesting preserves an intact vasa vasorum and associated NO production. NT SV <b>grafts</b> show a higher patency rate than RA <b>grafts.</b> Harvesting of ITA with or without surrounding tissue does not affect patency rate. ...|$|R
