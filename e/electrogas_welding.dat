5|$|Submerged {{arc welding}} (SAW) is a {{high-productivity}} welding method {{in which the}} arc is struck beneath a covering layer of flux. This increases arc quality, since contaminants in the atmosphere are blocked by the flux. The slag that forms on the weld generally comes off by itself, and combined {{with the use of}} a continuous wire feed, the weld deposition rate is high. Working conditions are much improved over other arc welding processes, since the flux hides the arc and almost no smoke is produced. The process is commonly used in industry, especially for large products and in the manufacture of welded pressure vessels.

5|$|During {{the middle}} of the century, many new welding methods were invented.

Gas tungsten arc welding, after decades of development, was finally perfected in 1941, and gas metal arc welding followed in 1948, allowing for fast welding of non-ferrous materials but requiring expensive shielding gases. Shielded metal arc welding was developed during the 1950s, using a flux-coated consumable electrode, and it quickly became the most popular metal arc welding process.

50|$|<b>Electrogas</b> <b>welding</b> (EGW) is a {{continuous}} vertical position arc welding process developed in 1961, {{in which an}} arc is struck between a consumable electrode and the workpiece. A shielding gas is sometimes used, but pressure is not applied. A major difference between EGW and its cousin electroslag welding is that the arc in EGW is not extinguished, instead remains struck throughout the welding process. It is used to make square-groove welds for butt and t-joints, especially in the shipbuilding industry and {{in the construction of}} storage tanks.|$|E
50|$|<b>Electrogas</b> <b>welding</b> can {{be applied}} to most steels, {{including}} low and medium carbon steels, low alloy high strength steels, and some stainless steels. Quenched and tempered steels may also be welded by the process, provided that the proper amount of heat is applied. Welds must be vertical, varying to either side by a maximum of 15 degrees. In general, the workpiece must be at least 10 mm (0.4 in) thick, while the maximum thickness for one electrode is approximately 20 mm (0.8 in). Additional electrodes make it possible to weld thicker workpieces. The height of the weld is limited only by the mechanism used to lift the welding head—in general, it ranges from 100 mm (4 in) to 20 m (50 ft).|$|E

5000|$|Electroslag welding (ESW) is {{a highly}} productive, single pass welding process for thick (greater than 25 mm up to about 300 mm) {{materials}} in a vertical or close to vertical position. (ESW) is similar to <b>electrogas</b> <b>welding,</b> but the main difference is the arc starts in a different location. An electric arc is initially struck by wire that is fed into the desired weld location and then flux is added. Additional flux is added until the molten slag, reaching {{the tip of the}} electrode, extinguishes the arc. The wire is then continually fed through a consumable guide tube (can oscillate if desired) into the surfaces of the metal workpieces and the filler metal are then melted using the electrical resistance of the molten slag to cause [...] The wire and tube then move up along the workpiece while a copper retaining shoe that was put into place before starting (can be water-cooled if desired) is used to keep the weld between the plates that are being welded. Electroslag welding is used mainly to join low carbon steel plates and/or sections that are very thick. It can also be used on structural steel if certain precautions are observed. This process uses a direct current (DC) voltage usually ranging from about 600 A and 40-50 V, higher currents are needed for thicker materials. Because the arc is extinguished, this is not an arc process.|$|E

40|$|Gas Metal Arc (GMA) welding {{is one of}} {{the most}} common methods in welding technology. It was invented at the {{beginning}} of the XXth century and is applied in many fields of industry until now. For almost every alloy used in industry, the GMA welding can be applied thanks to its variations (MIG/MAG including cored wire electrode welding, <b>electrogas</b> <b>welding,</b> plasma gas metal arc welding), inexpensive consumables and equipment. Despite the long-standing and widely spread application of this process, it still has not been completely understood due to the complex physical phenomena involved and their interaction with each other. As a consequence of this, its potential is not completely revealed and the research topic “physical phenomena in GMA welding” is still relevant. The goal of this work is the attainment of new knowledge about the GMA welding process in relation to the physical phenomena of the droplet formation, detachment and its transfer. For this, the effect of different welding process parameters on these physical phenomena is studied. Finally, it is studied how the droplet detachment and droplet transfer can be controlled by these process parameters. These studies are performed with the help of modern theoretical and experimental methods. The obtained results can be used not only for a better understanding of the welding process, but also for helping to apply in the industry, for example, low-spatter, more stable and energy-saving welding processes. One of the most important physical phenomena in GMA welding include the droplet formation and its transfer to the weld pool. The process stability, the weld seam geometry, the chemical composition and mechanical properties of weld seam, as well as the safety of welding construction depend on these processes. Therefore, the mentioned phenomena are very important for the quality and profitability of the welding process. The droplet transfer serves the GMA welding as an energy and mass transporter between the welding power source and electrode and the weld pool. With it, the GMA welding process can be purposefully controlled, even though the physical phenomena are in a complex interaction with each another. Both methodical approaches, the theoretical and the experimental, are applied for different, partially overlapping parameter ranges. The theoretical approach is applied mainly for non-measurable properties, like properties of the anode boundary layer, arc plasma and evaporation processes. The experimental approach makes it possible to observe the general process pattern and is used for measurable properties like droplet diameter, droplet velocity and arc length. The theoretical approach incorporates both, the physical-mathematical modelling and the numerical simulation of the metal transfer in GMA welding. The knowledge acquired with the help of numerical studies can be used to optimize the chemical composition for welding materials or to calculate and optimize the chemical composition of the weld seam. For the numerical analysis, different approaches are applied whereby the models implemented in ANSYS CFX software were validated by the simplified numerical experiments and were afterwards complemented with models based on the current process knowledge. In the experimental approach, modern measuring techniques are used in order to observe and analyse the welding process. For this, visual recordings of the welding process were made with a high-speed camera, synchronized with recordings of the welding current and voltage. Finally, the dependencies of the welding process parameters in relation to the droplet formation and droplet transfer are determined. For this, the process parameters are widely varied. In this work, new knowledge in the topic concerning the droplet formation and droplet transfer was obtained which leads to a better understanding of GMA welding process and makes it possible to benefit more from its potential which finally saves resources and costs. The models used in this work for the droplet formation and droplet transfer consider physical phenomena that for the first time, have been formulated, presented and summarized in the form of such models. The experimental approach has both complemented the theoretical approach and extended the understanding of the process...|$|E
