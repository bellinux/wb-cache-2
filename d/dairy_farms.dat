By 1875 the line was carrying around 40,000gallons (180,000l; 48,000USgal) of milk each year. Delivery of linseed cake to the <b>dairy</b> <b>farms</b> and of coal to the area's buildings were also important uses of the line. The line also began to carry large quantities of manure from London to the area's farms, carrying 3,200tons (3,300t) in 1872. As {{it was the only}} physical link between the Tramway and the national railway network, almost all of this traffic passed through Quainton Road station.|$|E

5|$|After World War II, {{industrial}} development quickened. New technology increased farm productivity through automation of feedlots for hogs and cattle, machine milking at <b>dairy</b> <b>farms,</b> and raising chickens in large buildings. Planting became more specialized with hybridization {{of corn and}} wheat, {{and the use of}} farm machinery such as tractors and combines became the norm. University of Minnesota professor Norman Borlaug contributed to these developments as part of the Green Revolution. Suburban development accelerated due to increased postwar housing demand and convenient transportation. Increased mobility, in turn, enabled more specialized jobs.|$|E

40|$|The Dutch <b>dairy</b> <b>farming</b> {{sector is}} subject to several {{sustainability}} problems. This study investigates how these societal concerns, {{in the form of}} normative pressure, influence the transition of the <b>dairy</b> <b>farming</b> regime towards sustainability. Insights from the multi level perspective are used to describe the transition of the Dutch <b>dairy</b> <b>farming</b> regime. To study normative pressure, social movement theory is incorporated. The main research question is: How does normative pressure influence the transition towards sustainability of the Dutch <b>dairy</b> <b>farming</b> regime from 1990 until now? It can be concluded that normative pressure on <b>dairy</b> <b>farming</b> to produce more sustainable increased over the past decades. The topic of concern, however, changed over time. In some cases societal organizations directly influence sustainable <b>dairy</b> <b>farming.</b> However, more often societal organizations influence market parties, via normative pressure, who in turn influence sustainable <b>dairy</b> <b>farming.</b> Sometimes, societal organizations also try to have an impact via the political/regulatory stream. Nonetheless, in the dairy sector, international policy makes it very hard to take actual measures, as the Netherlands have to commit to EU regulation. Therefore, Dutch policy makers have mainly an impact by stimulating market parties. All in all it seems in <b>dairy</b> <b>farming</b> normative pressure plays an important role to stimulate sustainable innovation...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} in two parts. In the first part, {{nitrogen}} (N) losses {{per unit of}} milk and meat in Danish conventional and organic pig and <b>dairy</b> <b>farming</b> were compared {{on the basis of}} farm data. In the second part, organic and conventional <b>dairy</b> <b>farming</b> were compared in detail, using modelling. N-surpluses at different livestock densities, fodder intensities, and soil types were simulated. Finally, simulated N-surpluses were used in national scenarios for conversion to organic <b>dairy</b> <b>farming</b> in Denmark. In Part one, pig farming was found to have a higher N-efficiency than <b>dairy</b> <b>farming.</b> Organic pig production had a lower N-efficiency and a higher N-surplus per kg meat than conventional pig production. The possibilities to reduce N-loss by conversion to organic pig production therefore appear to be poor. Organic <b>dairy</b> <b>farming</b> had a higher N-efficiency and a lower N-surplus per kg milk than conventional <b>dairy</b> <b>farming.</b> Conversion from conventional to organic <b>dairy</b> <b>farming</b> may therefore reduce N-losses. In Part two, a positive correlation between livestock density and N-surplus ha− 1 was found for <b>dairy</b> <b>farming.</b> For all simulated livestock densities, fodder feeding intensities and soil types, organic systems showed a lower N-surplus per unit of milk produced than conventional systems. National scenarios for <b>dairy</b> <b>farming</b> showed that the present Danish milk production could be achieved with a 24 % lower total N-surplus if converted from intensive conventional farming to extensive organic farming.

40|$|The {{integration}} of agriculture {{into the curriculum}} can be difficult for educators when materials and resources are not aligned with state learning standards. However, online educational tools, such as virtual field trips that are aligned with state learning standards, can allow for educators to bring {{the experience of a}} field trip to the classroom, as well as complement curriculum in the classroom. Virtual field trips also assist with removing many barriers that prevent educators from taking their students on an on-site field trip. ^ This study sought to describe the effectiveness of a virtual and on-site <b>dairy</b> <b>farm</b> field trip in teaching Science, Social Studies, and Health and Wellness standards to study participants. Additionally, this study sought to describe associations between enjoyment of a virtual and on-site <b>dairy</b> <b>farm</b> field trip and knowledge gained in specific Science, Social Studies, and Health and Wellness standards. A virtual <b>dairy</b> <b>farm</b> field trip was developed by the researcher to teach specific Science, Social Studies, and Health and Wellness standards {{in the context of a}} <b>dairy</b> <b>farm.</b> This study took place during the spring and there were seventy-two on-site <b>dairy</b> <b>farm</b> field trip study participants and one hundred and twenty-five virtual <b>dairy</b> <b>farm</b> field trip study participants.

5|$|Dairying is only {{economic}} in Wales with {{a sufficiently}} large herd in a productive lowland area. Hand-milking a few cows in a byre {{is a thing}} of the past and nowadays herds are milked by machine in modern parlours, two or three times a day. The milk passes by pipeline to the cooler and is stored in a refrigerated bulk tank and collected by milk tanker daily. In general, the cows graze outdoors in summer and spend their winter under cover, often in cubicles, the bulk of their feed being silage. Milk prices barely cover the costs of production, margins are tight, and there are fewer family-run <b>dairy</b> <b>farms</b> each year.

Production systems are mostly traditional, although there are a few intensive <b>dairy</b> <b>farms</b> around Kigali. Shortages of land and water, insufficient and poor-quality feed, and regular disease epidemics with insufficient veterinary services are major constraints that restrict output.

5|$|Farm incomes {{have fallen}} {{over the years}} as a result of cheap food {{policies}} in the United Kingdom, the lowering of world commodity prices and the removal of production-based subsidies. Particularly hard hit have been the incomes of hill farms in Wales which averaged £15,000 in 2014, as against £23,000 for lowland livestock farms and £59,000 for <b>dairy</b> <b>farms.</b> The labour force has been dwindling for many years as a result of increased mechanisation and changes in farming practices. Fewer farmers are needed today because they are able to produce more food from their land. Hay is no longer the main source of winter feed for livestock and has largely been replaced by silage, particularly baled silage wrapped in film that can be handled mechanically. This has reduced the manpower needed on farms, and there has been an increase of use by farmers of specialised contractors who provide services in silage making, harvesting and fencing. Another problem facing Welsh farmers is their distance from the main distribution centres used by supermarkets which are mostly located near centres of population in England.|$|E
