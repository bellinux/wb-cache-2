In 1858, French pediatrician Eugène Bouchut (1818–1891) developed a new technique for non-surgical orotracheal intubation to bypass laryngeal obstruction resulting from a diphtheria-related pseudomembrane. In 1880, Scottish surgeon William Macewen (1848–1924) reported on his use of orotracheal intubation as an alternative to tracheotomy to allow a patient with glottic edema to breathe, {{as well as in the}} setting of general anesthesia with chloroform. In 1895, Alfred Kirstein (1863–1922) of Berlin first described direct visualization of the vocal cords, using an esophagoscope he had modified for this purpose; he called this device an autoscope.|$|E

25|$|Molecular cloning {{is similar}} to {{polymerase}} chain reaction (PCR) in that it permits the replication of DNA sequence. The fundamental {{difference between the two}} methods is that molecular cloning involves replication of the DNA <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>living</b> microorganism, while PCR replicates DNA in an in vitro solution, free of living cells.|$|E

These components may alter the effective signalling capability of the modeling module.

In the design of synthetic ultrasensitive modules these effects {{should be taken into}} account.|$|E
25|$|In 1854, a Spanish vocal pedagogist named Manuel García (1805–1906) {{became the}} first man to view the {{functioning}} glottis <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>living</b> human. García developed a tool that used two mirrors for which the Sun served as an external light source. Using this device, he was able to observe the function of his own glottic apparatus and the uppermost portion of his trachea. He presented his observations at the Royal Society of London in 1855.|$|E
25|$|Depending on the {{specific}} tissue, auxin may promote axial elongation (as in shoots), lateral expansion (as in root swelling), or isodiametric expansion (as in fruit growth). In some cases (coleoptile growth), auxin-promoted cellular expansion occurs {{in the absence of}} cell division. In other cases, auxin-promoted cell division and cell expansion may be closely sequenced within the same tissue (root initiation, fruit growth). <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>living</b> plant, auxins and other plant hormones nearly always appear to interact to determine patterns of plant development.|$|E

The technical characteristics of many Heathkits were good. The ordinary consumer would, of course, buy a factory-built phonograph from the likes of RCA; but an audiophile, who was serious enough to assemble a system from individual components, frequently gave serious consideration to Heathkit products (for example, the AR15 and AR1500 receivers).|$|E
25|$|The genetic {{instructions}} {{of every}} replicating cell <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>living</b> organism are contained within its DNA.

25|$|As a rule {{it is not}} {{difficult}} to guess which eyes are which <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>living</b> or preserved specimen, but sometimes it can be. Apart from the fact that in some species one or more pairs may be missing, sometimes eyes from the posterior and anterior rows may be very close to each other, or even fused. Also, either one row or both might be so grossly curved that some of the notionally anterior eyes actually may lie posterior to some of the eyes in the posterior row. In some species the curve is so gross that the eyes apparently are arranged into two anteroposterior parallel rows of eyes.|$|E
25|$|In 2001, archaeologists {{studying}} {{the remains of}} two men from Mehrgarh, Pakistan, discovered {{that the people of}} the Indus Valley Civilisation, from the early Harappan periods, had knowledge of proto-dentistry. Later, in April 2006, it was announced in the scientific journal Nature that the oldest (and first early Neolithic) evidence for the drilling of human teeth in vivo (i.e., <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>living</b> person) was found in Mehrgarh. Eleven drilled molar crowns from nine adults were discovered in a Neolithic graveyard in Mehrgarh that dates from 7,500–9,000 years ago. According to the authors, their discoveries point to a tradition of proto-dentistry in the early farming cultures of that region.|$|E
25|$|Myiasis is the {{infestation}} {{of living}} or necrotic tissue <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>living</b> host by fly larvae. Some flies may just {{lay their eggs}} in a festering wound, while other may infest unwounded tissue. C. cadaverina has occasionally been found in cases of myiasis but is not a fly that is regularly found. Myiasis is fairly uncommon in the United States, but tends to be very common {{in third world countries}} and can create a major problem with livestock, causing severe economic losses. Myiasis is different from maggot therapy in which physicians purposely use larvae of flies that feed on necrotic tissue in order to clean up a wound and aid healing. Maggot therapy can clean up a wound that has been festering for months very quickly.|$|E

25|$|Biofluorescence is the {{absorption}} of electromagnetic wavelengths from the visible light spectrum by fluorescent proteins <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>living</b> organism, and the reemission of that light at a lower energy level. This causes the light that is re-emitted {{to be a different}} color than the light that is absorbed. Stimulating light excites an electron, raising energy to an unstable level. This instability is unfavorable, so the energized electron is returned to a stable state almost as immediately as it becomes unstable. This return to stability corresponds with the release of excess energy in the form of fluorescent light. This emission of light is only observable when the stimulant light is still providing light to the organism/object and is typically yellow, pink, orange, red, green, or purple. Biofluorescence is often confused with the following forms of biotic light, bioluminescence and biophosphorescence.|$|E
25|$|In 1908, aged 16, Tsvetaeva studied {{literary}} {{history at the}} Sorbonne. During this time, a major revolutionary change was occurring within Russian poetry: the flowering of the Russian Symbolist movement, and this movement was to colour most of her later work. It was not the theory which was to attract her, but the poetry and the gravity which writers such as Andrey Bely and Aleksandr Blok were capable of generating. Her own first collection of poems, Vecherny Albom (Evening Album), self-published in 1910, promoted her considerable reputation as a poet. It was well received, although her early poetry was held to be insipid compared to her later work. It {{attracted the attention of}} the poet and critic Maximilian Voloshin, whom Tsvetaeva described after his death <b>in</b> <b>A</b> <b>Living</b> Word About a Living Man. Voloshin came to see Tsvetaeva and soon became her friend and mentor.|$|E
25|$|Some {{proteins}} perform largely structural roles. For instance, {{movements of}} the proteins actin and myosin ultimately {{are responsible for the}} contraction of skeletal muscle. One property many proteins have is that they specifically bind to a certain molecule or class of moleculesthey may be extremely selective in what they bind. Antibodies are an example of proteins that attach to one specific type of molecule. In fact, the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), which uses antibodies, {{is one of the most}} sensitive tests modern medicine uses to detect various biomolecules. Probably the most important proteins, however, are the enzymes. Virtually every reaction <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>living</b> cell requires an enzyme to lower the activation energy of the reaction. These molecules recognize specific reactant molecules called substrates; they then catalyze the reaction between them. By lowering the activation energy, the enzyme speeds up that reaction by a rate of 1011 or more; a reaction that would normally take over 3,000 years to complete spontaneously might take less than a second with an enzyme. The enzyme itself is not used up in the process, and is free to catalyze the same reaction with a new set of substrates. Using various modifiers, the activity of the enzyme can be regulated, enabling control of the biochemistry of the cell as a whole.|$|E
