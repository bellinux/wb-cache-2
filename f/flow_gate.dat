40|$|This article {{describes}} the hydraulic behavior of a mixed water level control hydromechanical gate present in several irrigation canals. The automatic gate is termed "mixed" because it can hold either the upstream water level or the downstream water level constant according to the flow conditions. Such a complex behavior is obtained {{through a series of}} side tanks linked by orifices and weirs. No energy supply is needed in this regulation process. The mixed <b>flow</b> <b>gate</b> is analyzed and a mathematical model for its function is proposed, assuming the system is at equilibrium. The goal of the modeling was to better understand the mixed gate function and to help adjust their characteristics in the field or in a design process. The proposed model is analyzed and evaluated using real data collected on a canal in the south of France. The results show the ability of the model to reproduce the function of this complex hydromechanical system. The mathematical model is also implemented in software dedicated to hydraulic modeling of irrigation canals, which can be used to design and evaluate management strategies...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—We {{present an}} {{innovative}} microfluidic system that accomplishes specific capture, enrichment, and isocratic elu-tion of biomolecular analytes with coupling to label-free mass spectrometric detection. Analytes in a liquid phase are specif-ically captured and enriched via their affinity binding to ap-tamers, which are immobilized on microbeads packed inside a microchamber. Exploiting thermally induced reversible disrup-tion of aptamer–analyte binding via on-chip temperature control with an integrated heater and temperature sensor, the captured analytes are {{released into the}} liquid phase and then isocratically eluted and transferred via a microfluidic <b>flow</b> <b>gate</b> for detection by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS). The utility of the device is demonstrated using adenosine monophosphate (AMP) as a model analyte. Experi-mental {{results indicate that the}} device is capable of purifying and enriching the analyte from a sample mixed with nonspe-cific analytes and contaminated with salts. In addition, thermally induced analyte release is performed at modest temperatures (45 ◦C), and mass spectra obtained from MALDI-MS demon-strate successful detection of AMP at concentrations as low as 10 nM following enrichment by consecutive infusion of a diluted sample.

Research {{completed}} at Department of Chemistry, Fairmount College of Liberal Arts and SciencesCapillary electrophoresis (CE) is an analytical tool which has gained great interests during the past decade. The main attractions of CE are its fast, high-throughput and highly efficient separations. However, conventional single branch CE system has faced the challenge when samples lack of appropriate internal standards. Thus, a double branch CE configuration is introduced here to solve this problem. We successfully fabricated the two branch microfluidic switch by using standard photolithography and PDMS prototyping. This two-branch switch was placed between the two sample supplies and an injection <b>flow</b> <b>gate.</b> Two samples were alternately injected and then separated by the CE system. The concentration of one sample was maintained constant as the standard while the other contained to-be-determined analyses. This method was able to compensate the effects due to potential drifting of the excitation light source, variation of light focusing, and/or fluctuation of sample injections, {{which was based on}} the assumption that the variation of experimental conditions between two successive injections was negligible. The results showed high reproducibility and stability achieved by the two-branch switch. This strategy would be especially valuable at situations when there are no appropriate internal standards for specific analyses.

Integrated {{microfluidic}} systems coupled with electrophoretic separations have broad application in biologic and chemical analysis. Interfaces for the connection of various functional parts {{play a major role}} in the performance of a system. Here, we developed a rapid prototyping method to fabricate monolithic poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) interfaces for flow-gated injection, online reagent mixing, and tube-to-tube connection in an integrated capillary electrophoresis (CE) system. The basic idea was based on the properties of PDMS: elasticity, transparency, and suitability for prototyping. The molds for these interfaces were prepared by using commercially available stainless steel wires and nylon lines or silica capillaries. A steel wire was inserted through the diameter of a nylon line and a cross format was obtained as the mold for PDMS casting of flow gates and 4 -way mixers. These interfaces accommodated tubing connection through PDMS elasticity and provided easy visual trouble shooting. The <b>flow</b> <b>gate</b> used smaller channel diameters, thus reducing flow rate by 25 -fold for effective gating compared with mechanically machined counterparts. Both PDMS mixers and the tube-to-tube connectors could minimize the sample dead volume by using an appropriate capillary configuration. As a whole, the prototyped PDMS interfaces are reusable, inexpensive, convenient for connection, and robust when integrated with the CE detection system. Therefore, these interfaces could see potential applications in CE and CE-coupled systems.

40|$|Introduction: Determination the {{hydraulic}} performance of an irrigation network requires adequate {{knowledge about the}} sensitivities of the network structures. Hydraulic sensitivity concept of structures and channel reaches aid network operators in identifying structures with higher sensitivities which will attract more attention both during network operation and maintenance program. Sluice gates are frequently used as regulator and delivery structures in irrigation networks. Usually discharge coefficient of sluice gate is considered constant {{in the design and}} operation stage. Investigation of sensitivity of offtakes and cross-regulators has carried out by various researchers and some hydraulic sensitivity indicators have been developed. In the previous researches, these indexes were developed based on constant coefficient of discharge for free <b>flow</b> sluice <b>gates.</b> However, the coefficient of discharge for free <b>flow</b> sluice <b>gates</b> depend on gate opening and the upstream water depth. So, in this research, some hydraulic sensitivity indicators at structure based on variable coefficient of discharge for free <b>flow</b> sluice <b>gates</b> were developed and they were validated by using observed data. Materials and Methods: An experimental setup was constructed to analyses the performance of the some hydraulic sensitivity. The flume was provided with storage reservoir, pumps, electromagnetic flowmeter, entrance tank, feeder canal, delivery canals, offtakes, cross-regulators, collector reservoir, piezometric boards. The flume is 60. 5 m long and the depth of that is 0. 25 m, of which only a small part close to offtake and Cross-regulators was needed for these tests. Offtakes and Cross-regulators are free-flowing sluice gates type. Offtakes were located at distances 20 m and 42. 5 m downstream from the entrance tank, respectively. and, Cross-regulators were located 2 m downstream from each offtakes. The offtakes are 0. 21 m and Cross-regulators are 0. 29 m wide. The upstream and downstream water levels at gates were measured with piezometer taps. There is a collector reservoir downstream of each delivery canal that was equipped with a 135 V-notch weir as a measuring device.
