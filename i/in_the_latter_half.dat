50|$|The episodes largely {{fall into}} two parts. The {{first half of the}} series {{revolves}} around Atsuhime's life <b>in</b> Satsuma. <b>The</b> <b>latter</b> <b>half</b> mainly proceeds with the politics around the Tokugawa Shogunate after she moved to Edo to marry Tokugawa Iesada.|$|R
50|$|The view of ensoulment at {{conception}} harmonizes {{with general}} lore among rabbis about conscious activity before birth. However, {{most of them}} did not apply the word nefesh, meaning soul or person, to a fetus still <b>in</b> <b>the</b> womb. <b>The</b> <b>latter</b> <b>half</b> of <b>the</b> Second Temple period saw increasing acceptance {{of the idea of}} the soul as joining the body at birth and leaving it again at death.|$|R

5|$|A {{possible}} {{issue with}} the causeway's identification as a Roman structure <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> <b>half</b> {{of the twentieth century}} was its incorporation of many small bends along its course. Roman military roads are usually straight in both their overall course, and also typically from one vantage point to the next. Both the Foss Way and the Stanegate, roads of established Roman provenance, have sinuous courses similar to Wade's causeway, so the objection is not conclusive.|$|E
50|$|A {{significant}} aspect <b>in</b> translations from <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> <b>half</b> of <b>the</b> 20th {{century was}} much {{greater use of}} the principles of dynamic equivalence.|$|R

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> <b>half</b> of 1929, {{the highway}} was rerouted between Saginaw and Reese, using {{a set of}} {{parallel}} roadways {{to the south of}} the previous routing; this change was reversed in 1933. M-81 was fully paved when the last section between Ellington and Elmwood in Tuscola County was finished in late 1946 or early 1947.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> <b>half</b> of 1934, Himmler {{oversaw the}} {{creation}} of SS-Junkerschule (Junker schools), institutions where SS officer candidates received leadership training, political and ideological indoctrination, and military instruction. The training stressed ruthlessness and toughness {{as part of the}} SS value system, which helped foster a sense of superiority among the men and taught them self-confidence. The first schools were established at Bad Tölz and Braunschweig, with additional schools opening at Klagenfurt and Prague during the war.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> <b>half</b> of 1998, {{the team}} {{produced}} a polished and integrated interface, wrote the game manual and foreign language translations, painted the faction leader portraits and terrain, built the 3D vehicles and vehicle parts, {{and created the}} music. Michael Ely directed the Secret Project movies and cast the faction leaders. 25 volunteers participated in Firaxis' first public beta test. The beta testers suggested the Diplomatic and Economic victories and the Random Events.|$|E
50|$|Over {{the next}} several decades, as the law school grew in size, it moved to larger accommodations. The 1930s saw a move to the Chemistry Building just to the {{southeast}} of Old Main, and then into Waterman Hall, the first dedicated law school construction project, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1950s. <b>The</b> <b>latter</b> <b>half</b> of <b>the</b> 20th century saw additions added to Waterman Hall to form the Robert A.

50|$|When he was {{relegated to}} second {{features}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1950s {{he concentrated on}} his stage career, maturing into an accomplished character actor <b>in</b> <b>the</b> process. <b>The</b> <b>latter</b> <b>half</b> of his career was mostly spent on television in such programmes as Softly, Softly; Out of the Unknown; Dixon of Dock Green; Doomwatch; Z-Cars; and perhaps most memorably as 'The Master of the Land of Fiction' <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Doctor Who serial, The Mind Robber.|$|R
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> <b>half</b> of 2002, CIA reports {{contained}} {{assertions of}} Saddam Hussein's intent of reconstituting nuclear weapons programs, not properly accounting for Iraqi {{biological and chemical}} weapons, and that some Iraqi missiles had a range greater than allowed by the UN sanctions. Contentions that the Bush Administration manipulated or exaggerated the threat and evidence of Iraq's {{weapons of mass destruction}} capabilities would eventually become a major point of criticism for the president.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> <b>half</b> of {{the twentieth}} century, the World Peace Bell Association {{was set up in}} Japan, with the purpose of funding and casting temple bells to be placed around the world as symbols of peace.

Simak, Piers Anthony, David Brin, K. A. Applegate, Philip Pullman, and Ian Stewart and Jack Cohen. Some of these works address the developmental and biomechanical constraints on wheeled creatures: Brin's creatures suffer from arthritic axles, and Pullman's Mulefa are not born with wheels, but roll on seed pods with which they coevolved.|$|E
5000|$|The Canadian Speckle Park is a {{breed of}} cattle {{native to the}} Canadian {{province}} of Saskatchewan. It {{is one of only}} a few beef cattle breeds developed <b>in</b> Canada. <b>The</b> <b>latter</b> <b>half</b> of <b>the</b> breed's name derives from the characteristic white, black and grey spots and patches of color that it's known for.|$|R
50|$|Ormers are {{considered}} a great delicacy <b>in</b> <b>the</b> British Channel Islands. Overfishing {{has led to a}} dramatic depletion <b>in</b> numbers since <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> <b>half</b> of <b>the</b> 19th century.|$|R

5|$|Industrial metal {{developed}} in the late 1980s, as industrial and metal began to fuse into a common genre. In {{the early years of}} the 21st century, groups from the black metal scene began to incorporate elements of industrial music. Industrial metal did well in the early 1990s, particularly in North America, with the success of groups such as Nine Inch Nails. The industrial metal movement began to fade <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> <b>half</b> of the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Joseph {{moved to}} the Detroit Red Wings, who had just won the Stanley Cup. Joseph {{initially}} was not popular with Red Wings fans but eventually found his form <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> <b>half</b> of the 2002–03 season to backstop his team to the division title. Detroit was upset {{in the first round}} of the playoffs in 2003 by the eventual conference champions, the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim in a four straight game sweep.|$|E

60|$|The {{literary}} period included <b>in</b> <b>the</b> above term is, <b>in</b> general, <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> <b>half</b> of <b>the</b> eighteenth century; {{more particularly}} it {{extends from the}} Stamp Act (1765), which united <b>the</b> colonies <b>in</b> opposition to Britain's policy of taxation, {{to the adoption of}} the Constitution (1787) and the inauguration of Washington as first president of the new nation.|$|R
50|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> book's <b>latter</b> <b>half,</b> {{a strong}} empiricist {{tendency}} evidences itself in Mao's thought.

Please note that the summaries represent what Mao is claiming or writing in each chapter.|$|R
5|$|When Captain Scarlet was {{repeated}} by Central Television <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> <b>half</b> of the decade, {{changes were made}} to the episode's opening sequence to remove dialogue in which the Mysterons allude to surveillance equipment that is being rotated to facilitate inspection of the Martian Exploration Vehicle. Since the imaging device resembles a missile battery (as the Zero X astronauts mistake it for), this re-edited version inadvertently gives an impression of stronger hostility {{on the part of the}} Mysterons.|$|E
5|$|According to Eusebius of Caesarea, Pamphilus of Caesarea {{was born}} into a rich family in Beirut <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> <b>half</b> of the 3rd century and {{attended}} its law school. Pamphilus later became the presbyter of Caesarea Maritima and the founder of its extensive Christian library. He is celebrated as a martyr by both the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church. Eusebius also tells of martyred brothers Aphian and Aedesius, born to a noble Lycian family. They converted to Christianity while studying law in Beirut and were persecuted and executed for their beliefs.|$|E
5|$|Although Strauss was {{the most}} sought-after {{composer}} of dance music <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> <b>half</b> of the 19th century, stiff competition was present {{in the form of}} Karl Michael Ziehrer and Émile Waldteufel; the latter held a commanding position in Paris. Phillip Fahrbach also denied the younger Strauss the commanding position of the KK Hofballmusikdirektor when the latter first applied for the post. The German operetta composer Jacques Offenbach, who made his name in Paris, also posed a challenge to Strauss in the operetta field.|$|E
