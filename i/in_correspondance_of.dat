This section run across the "Bobbio window" where the deeper structural levels of this belt are cropping out. In the western area the Antola and Internal Ligurid Units are present.

As basal medium in calli formation and plant regeneration the salts Murashige and Skoog were used (MS). In the first case, plant growth regulators as 2, 4 - Dichlorophenoxyacetic (2, 4 -D) and 6 - Bencilaminopurine (BAP) were added to culture mediun, meanwhile for the second, 6 - Bencilaminopurine and Kinetin (Kin). In both, different concentrations of stressing agent were used, (0, 5. 0, 7. 5 and 10 %), being determined their effect on osmotic potential, induction and growth of calli, as well as, plant regeneration.

40|$|We {{calculate}} the type Ia supernova rate for different star formation histories in galaxies by adopting {{the most popular}} and recent progenitor models. We show that the timescale for the maximum in the type Ia supernova rate, which corresponds also to time of the maximum enrichment, is not unique but is a strong function of the adopted stellar lifetimes, initial mass function and star formation rate. This timescale varies from ∼ 40 - 50 Myr for an instantaneous starburst to ∼ 0. 3 Gyr for a typical elliptical galaxy to ∼ 4. 0 - 5. 0 Gyr for a disk of a spiral Galaxy like the Milky Way. We also show that the typical timescale of 1 Gyr, often quoted as the typical timescale for the type Ia supernovae, is just the time at which, in the solar neighbourhood, the Fe production from supernovae Ia starts to become important and not the time at which SNe Ia start to explode. As a cosequence of this, a change in slope in the [O/Fe] ratio is expected <b>in</b> <b>correspondance</b> <b>of</b> this timescale. We conclude that the suggested lack of supernovae Ia at low metallicities produces results at variance with the observed [O/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] relation in the solar region. We also compute the supernova Ia rates for different galaxies as a function of redshift and predict an extended maximum between redshift z ∼ 3. 6 and z ∼ 1. 6 for elliptical galaxies, and two maxima, one at z ∼ 3 and the other at z ∼ 1, for spiral galaxies, under the assumption that galaxies start forming stars at z_f ∼ 5 and Ω_M = 0. 3, Ω_Λ = 0. 7.

Here, we investigate the related notion of infinite divisiblity, {{which happens to}} be closely related to the classical infinite divisibility: there exists a bijection between the set of classical symmetric infinitely divisible distributions and the set of distributions infinitely divisible with respect to this convolution, which preserves limit theorems. We give an interpretation <b>of</b> this <b>correspondance</b> <b>in</b> term <b>of</b> random matrices: we construct distributions on sets of complex rectangular matrices which give rise to random matrices with singular laws (i. e. uniform distributions on their singular values) going from the symmetric classical infinitely divisible distributions to their images by the previously mentioned bijection when the dimensions go from one to infinity in a ratio λ.
