40|$|AbstractThe <b>drop</b> <b>punt</b> {{delivered}} with a backspin {{is more common}} in Australian football, whereas the torpedo punt {{delivered with}} a rifle spin is the standard kick in rugby. The spin rate and the kick precision were measured with a smart Australian rules football, instrumented with three high speed gyros. The kick precision is defined by the elevation angle of the spin axis, with 0 ° and 90 ° being the perfect <b>drop</b> and torpedo <b>punts,</b> respectively. The data were recorded from participants of various skill levels in Australian football and rugby, kicking the ball with rifle spins and backspins. Torpedo punts were kicked at higher spin rates than <b>drop</b> <b>punts</b> (8. 2 vs. 4. 8 revolutions per second). The average kick precision in torpedo and <b>drop</b> <b>punts</b> was similar (80 %, if the perfect kick equals 100 %). There was no evidence from the recorded data that spin rate influences the kick precision...|$|R
50|$|The {{technique}} was once used in Australian rules football when kicking for goal, but {{fell out of}} favour in the mid-20th Century in favour of the <b>Drop</b> <b>punt.</b>|$|R
50|$|Jack Dyer is {{generally}} credited with inventing the <b>drop</b> <b>punt</b> during his playing {{days with the}} Richmond Football Club. Horrie Clover and the Collier brothers, Albert and Harry, are also attributed with being {{the first to use}} the kick regularly.|$|R
5000|$|Keenan {{played as}} a 197 cm ruckman {{and was a}} solid marker of the ball as well as having a good <b>drop</b> <b>punt.</b> He was {{recruited}} from Assumption College by Melbourne for whom he made his VFL debut in 1970.|$|R
2500|$|Hawke quit Port {{at the end}} of 1957 to try {{his hand}} in Western Australia and made his West Australian National Football League (WANFL) debut in 1958 for East Perth Football Club, playing 42 matches and kicking 157 goals in two seasons with the Royals, {{including}} East Perth's 1958 and 1959 premierships. Hawke topped the WANFL's goalkicking list in 1959 with 114 goals, represented Western Australia against South Australia and gained local fame for apparently being the first footballer to perfect the <b>drop</b> <b>punt</b> over a long distance. [...] Previously, the <b>drop</b> <b>punt</b> was only used over short distances on wet days but Hawke's innovation was said to have revolutionised the game in Western Australia.|$|R
50|$|Once the {{preferred}} method of conveying {{the ball over}} long distances, the drop-kick has been superseded by the <b>drop</b> <b>punt</b> as a more accurate means of delivering the ball to a fellow player. It is, therefore, no longer used in the game as it is considered too unpredictable.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{variation}} is the [...] "No Torps" [...] rule where kickers are requested to only kick <b>drop</b> <b>punts</b> {{so that the}} pack {{has a better chance}} to mark the football. This rule is usually instigated soon after a few torpedo kicks have been attempted unsuccessfully by one or two kickers.|$|R
50|$|Australian rules uses an oval ball (a prolate spheroid), {{similar to}} a rugby ball. This makes a {{difference}} in the variety and style of kicking. Australian rules is capable of producing a diverse range of kicking styles, the <b>drop</b> <b>punt</b> is most commonly used in the modern game, more so at professional levels.|$|R
50|$|Cockroft {{served as}} the Browns' primary punter and placekicker {{for the first nine}} seasons of his career. In 1977, he <b>dropped</b> <b>punting</b> from his duties and became solely a placekicker. He and Tampa Bay Buccaneers kicker/punter Dave Green were two of the last NFL players to lead their teams in both punting and kicking in the same season (1976).|$|R
50|$|Arthur Esmonde Martelli (16 June 1878 - 1926) was an Irish {{international}} rugby union fullback back {{who played}} club rugby for Dublin University. Martelli played international rugby for the British Isles team on its 1899 tour of Australia. He {{was described by}} British Isles tour manager, Matthew Mullineux, as having 'an excellent <b>drop,</b> <b>punt</b> and place kick'.|$|R
50|$|Gaelic {{football}} uses a {{round ball}} {{similar to a}} soccer or volleyball. The round ball can be kicked anyway you like, inside, outside and middle of your boot. The instep {{is the most popular}} style based on culture, the <b>drop</b> <b>punt</b> used in Gaelic is a far superior kick in terms of distance and accuracy, but is rarely taught.|$|R
50|$|Alex Moffat {{invented the}} spiral punt. It {{is the longest}} type of punt kick. In flight, the ball spins about its long axis, instead of end over end (like a <b>drop</b> <b>punt)</b> {{or not at all}} (like a regular punt kick). This makes the flight of the ball more aerodynamic, and the pointy ends of {{gridiron}} footballs mitigate the difficulty to catch.|$|R
50|$|The torpedo punt (also {{known as}} screw punt or spiral punt) {{is the longest}} type of punt kick. In flight, the ball spins about its long axis, instead of end over end (like a <b>drop</b> <b>punt)</b> {{or not at all}} (like a regular punt kick). This makes the flight of the ball more aerodynamic, but more {{difficult}} to catch (or mark in some football codes).|$|R
50|$|In Australian rules football, {{the kick}} {{has become less}} common since the 1980s, as modern tactics have meant that {{accuracy}} has become typically more important than distance in field kicking; as such, coaches now prefer {{the use of the}} <b>drop</b> <b>punt,</b> and discouraging the use of the torpedo in general field play as a comparatively low percentage kick. The kick may still be seen when a player needs additional distance.|$|R
50|$|In {{his debut}} season {{he played in}} a losing Grand Final and the {{following}} year, 1931, {{was a member of}} Geelong's premiership side. Mostly a support ruckman, Metherell also rested a lot in defence and was joined by his younger brother Jack in 1932. He liked to crash through packs and was a regular exponent of the <b>drop</b> <b>punt.</b> Metherell polled well in the 1935 Brownlow Medal, finishing equal ninth.|$|R
25|$|He was {{selected}} as an interchange player in the AFL's 1996 Team of the Century"). He gradually played less as a ruckman and more as a forward later in his career. He invented the <b>drop</b> <b>punt,</b> a kicking style that gradually gained popularity over the intervening decades and is now almost universal, and has now spread to Rugby union, rugby league and American Football. He kicked 443 goals, fifth on Richmond's list of all-time goalkickers.|$|R
50|$|Farmer's great goal scoring {{came from}} many attributes. His goals came readily, from superb {{concentration}} {{and the ability}} to read the play and be in position. Not only was he a brilliant fast lead, but Farmer was described as having a very powerful grip and hence a strong mark. He was unnervingly accurate shooting for goals with the screw and flat <b>punts</b> (<b>drop</b> <b>punts</b> not being part of the game at that time).|$|R

50|$|The game {{supports}} 3 controller types; The standard Wii remote, the Wii remote {{with the}} Nunchuck and the Game Cube Controller. Wicked Witch {{stated that the}} controls are intuitive but can take time to learn. Wii remote shaking is used to successfully tackle or break a tackle. There are 4 types of kicks including <b>Drop</b> <b>Punts,</b> Torpedoes, Snaps (Check Sides) and Grubbers but only 1 type of handball which increases in elevation depending on power.|$|R

Previously, the <b>drop</b> <b>punt</b> was only used over short distances on wet days but Hawke's innovation was said to have revolutionised the game in Western Australia. Fresh from his success on the football field, Hawke also made an impact on the cricket field as a medium-fast swing bowler with an unusual [...] "crab-like'" [...] action, a capable lower-order batsman and a sound fieldsman. He made his first-class cricket debut for Western Australia in November 1959, scoring 89 and returning the figures of 0/49. However, Hawke failed to capitalise on this initial success and returned to South Australia {{at the end of}} the 1959/60 cricket season.|$|R
5000|$|In a <b>drop</b> <b>punt</b> {{the ball}} is held vertically, and dropped and kicked before it hits the ground, {{resulting}} in the ball spinning backwards end over end. It is the primary method of disposing the ball by foot in Australian rules football. It is considered more accurate and easier to mark than a regular punt kick, which is held flat and does not spin in the air.In gridiron football it {{is referred to as}} a pooch punt or quick kick, a kick used by punters when the team is too far out for a field goal and too close to kick a normal punt because the ball will probably go into the end zone, losing field position in the resulting touchback. The kick has gradually replaced the less effective [...] "coffin-corner kick", which was similar to rugby football's [...] "kicking for touch" [...] where the object was to put the ball out of bounds near the opposition goal. Like Australian rules football <b>drop</b> <b>punts,</b> the pooch punt requires the punter to control the distance and former Australian footballers like Darren Bennett and Ben Graham are generally credited with increasing the popularity of this kick in the National Football League.|$|R
50|$|Wheatley {{is known}} for his prodigious kicking, with his ability to {{pinpoint}} 60 metre passes using the <b>drop</b> <b>punt.</b> He is also known to be able to kick long distance torpedo punts, which led to speculation that he might try out as an American football punter. Paul polled two votes in the 2007 Brownlow Medal, his first votes, and five votes in 2008, a career high. He has the record in the NAB Cup with the most goals scored outside of 50 m.|$|R
40|$|The {{types of}} kick that are {{performed}} in the football codes fall into two broad categories: punt kick and place kick. One type of punt kick is the major means of ball movement in Australian Rules football – the <b>drop</b> <b>punt</b> kick. Past studies have investigated the biomechanics of kicking. The pattern of segmental interaction during the kicking motion – known as the proximal to distal sequence (PDS) – is the most consistent finding that is reported in the biomechanics of kicking literature. In this sequence the proximal segment (thigh) initiates the forward swing of the kicking limb towards the ball and the forward rotation of the distal segment (shank) follows. PDS motions are also typified by a higher angular velocity of the distal segment (shank). Studies that have compared the difference between skilled and less skilled kickers in Australian Rules football {{have found that the}} difference in performance is the result of 1) the position of the shank {{at the end of the}} backswing is higher above horizontal (further in the clockwise direction) for the skilled than it is for the less skilled, 2) the maximum angular velocity of the thigh during the forward swing is greater for the skilled than it is for the less skilled and 3) the skilled kickers demonstrate greater mean maximum angular velocity of the shank at foot – ball contact. Apart from these findings there is inadequate information about the mechanical features of a skillful <b>drop</b> <b>punt</b> kick. The objective of this study was to quantify and compare the kinematics of skilled and less skilled kicking. A general profile of the <b>drop</b> <b>punt</b> kick and the reliability of the kinematic variables were also reported. The reliability study was conducted first. Six subjects were tested on two occasions to establish the reliability of the equipment and methods. Variables were deemed to be reliable if they demonstrated an ICC equal or greater than r = 0. 80. Of the 95 variables that were analysed 42...|$|R
40|$|Athletic {{profiling}} provides {{valuable information}} to sport scientists, assisting in the optimal design {{of strength and}} conditioning programmes. Understanding the influence these physical characteristics may have on the generation of kicking accuracy is advantageous. The {{aim of this study}} was to profile and compare the lower limb mass characteristics of accurate and inaccurate Australian footballers. Thirty-one players were recruited from the Western Australian Football League to perform ten <b>drop</b> <b>punt</b> kicks over 20 metres to a player target. Players were separated into accurate (n = 15) and inaccurate (n = 16) groups, with leg mass characteristics assessed using whole body dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans. Accurate kickers demonstrated significantly greater relative lean mass (P ≤ 0. 004) and significantly lower relative fat mass (P ≤ 0. 024) across all segments of the kicking and support limbs, while also exhibiting significantly higher intra-limb lean-to-fat mass ratios for all segments across both limbs (P ≤ 0. 009). Inaccurate kickers also produced significantly larger asymmetries between limbs than accurate kickers (P ≤ 0. 028), showing considerably lower lean mass in their support leg. These results illustrate a difference in leg mass characteristics between accurate and inaccurate kickers, highlighting the potential influence these may have on technical proficiency of the <b>drop</b> <b>punt...</b>|$|R
50|$|Many full {{forwards}} {{are quick}} on the lead, but the truly great ones {{seem to know}} instinctively {{how to get the}} maximum advantage from their leads by timing them to perfection. In this particular skill, McKenna has had few peers, and once he had gained possession of the ball, usually from a bullet stab pass from Barry Price or Wayne Richardson, he almost invariably finished things off with consummate precision, typically using a kick on which the jury, at the time, was still out - the <b>drop</b> <b>punt.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The modern handpass technique, {{known as}} the rocket handball, was pioneered by Kevin Sheedy. [...] It is {{executed}} so that the ball rotates backwards in an end-to-end fashion, similar to the <b>drop</b> <b>punt</b> kick. The ball is held on a slight angle with the fist ending up in or close to the other open hand. This enables a handpass to achieve distance and speed comparable to a short kick and is easier for teammates to catch. Professional Australian footballers are typically competent at handballing using either punching arm.|$|R
50|$|The {{two players}} will space {{themselves}} about 15 metres or more apart and alternate kicking whilst the other marks. Sometimes players will run and/or bounce when returning a long ball and experiment with different kicking styles, {{such as the}} <b>drop</b> <b>punt,</b> torpedo punt or checkside punt. If goal posts are present, participants will often position themselves in front and behind the posts to practice scoring. Kick-to-kick is often a family pastime and many footballers learned their skills in games of backyard kick-to-kick. It {{has been suggested that}} informal kick-to-kick can assist in battling obesity in children.|$|R
5000|$|In flight, {{the ball}} spins about its long axis, instead of {{end over end}} (as the <b>drop</b> <b>punt</b> does) {{or not at all}} (as a typical punt kick does), making the flight of the ball more aerodynamic, but more {{difficult}} to catch (or mark in some football codes). The pointier ends make the ball easier to catch in American Football. With extra distance, this type of kick is also more difficult to accurately judge depth. If kicked correctly, an Australian football can travel up to 80 metres, while a normal punt will travel slightly less far.|$|R

Five AF players performed kicks pre and post fatigue protocol. Three dimensional data of the pelvis and kick leg was obtained using a three tower optotrak Certus system (200 Hz) and joint torques and moments were calculated in Visual 3 D from kick foot toe off until ball contact. Sprint time indicated the protocol induced fatigue. Hip flexion torque significantly increased following fatigue indicating a change in movement strategy similar to that found for jump landing. This greater hip reliant post-fatigue kicking strategy has implications for both skill enhancement and injury prevention...|$|R
