40|$|When {{using the}} well known {{handbooks}} for reliability predicting (MIL, CNET) some problems occur in quality assessment of components {{which are not}} produced {{according to the requirements}} of the US military or the French standards. The results obtained from tests of Test Pattern Circuits may be used successfully for reliability estimating during the design period of new thick film <b>Hybrid</b> <b>Integrated</b> <b>Circuits.</b> Six types of Test Pattern Circuits were designed and tested and a model for estimating thick film <b>Hybrid</b> <b>Integrated</b> <b>Circuits</b> failure rate is proposed.

50|$|A {{common problem}} {{nowadays}} are 'dead' voice chips, {{in which one}} or more of the 6 available notes fail and sound silent, quiet, or crackly. The Juno-106 contains a custom <b>hybrid</b> <b>integrated</b> <b>circuit</b> for each of its six voices, the Roland 80017A VCF/VCA IC. Over time, these ICs tend to become intermittent or fail outright. Because they are no longer manufactured, third-party substitutes have become available. In recent years, some people have successfully repaired these hybrid ICs by removing the conformal coating of resin that is sometimes implicated in their failure. Numerous videos demonstrating this can be found on the internet.|$|E

Within one week 100 gold watches had been sold, at a retail price of 450,000 yen (US$1,250) each (at the time, equivalent to the price of a medium-sized car). Essential elements included a Y-type quartz oscillator of 8192 cps, a <b>hybrid</b> <b>integrated</b> <b>circuit,</b> and a phase locked ultra-small stepping motor to turn its hands. The Astron was accurate to ±0.2 seconds per day, ±5 seconds per month, or one minute per year.|$|E
50|$|The MIL-PRF-38534 {{specification}} {{establishes the}} general performance requirements for hybrid microcircuits (<b>hybrid</b> <b>integrated</b> <b>circuit),</b> multi-chip modules (MCM) and, similar devices and the verification and validation requirements for ensuring that these devices meet the applicable performance requirements.

The main body of this specification describes the performance requirements and the requirements for obtaining a Qualified Manufacturers List (QML) listing. The appendices of this specification are intended for guidance to aid a manufacturer in developing their verification program. Detail requirements, specific characteristics, and other provisions that are sensitive to the particular intended use should be specified in the applicable device acquisition specification.|$|E
5000|$|The modules {{were called}} Flip-Chips because early {{versions}} {{of some of}} these modules, for example, the R107 module shown, used <b>hybrid</b> <b>integrated</b> <b>circuits</b> built using flip chip mounting of individual diode chips on a ceramic substrate. Some boards containing flip chip modules were etched and drilled to allow those modules to be replaced by discrete components.

5000|$|A <b>hybrid</b> <b>integrated</b> <b>circuit,</b> HIC, hybrid microcircuit, {{or simply}} hybrid is a {{miniaturized}} electronic circuit constructed of individual devices, such as semiconductor devices (e.g. transistors and diodes) and passive components (e.g. resistors, inductors, transformers, and capacitors), bonded to a substrate or {{printed circuit board}} (PCB). If the components are on Printed Wiring Board (PWB) then, according {{to the definition of}} MIL-PRF-38534, it is not considered hybrid. A PCB can be called PWB if does not contain embedded components. Hybrid circuits are often encapsulated in epoxy, as shown in the photo. A hybrid circuit serves as a component on a PCB {{in the same way as}} a monolithic integrated circuit; the difference between the two types of devices is in how they are constructed and manufactured. The advantage of hybrid circuits is that components which cannot be included in a monolithic IC can be used, e.g., capacitors of large value, wound components, crystals, inductors.|$|E
