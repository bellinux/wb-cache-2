Based on this fact, this paper presents a series of experiments to compare performance of several technologies of dynamic content over the NT platform.

Based on experimental results, the authors show that traditional typical dynamic applications (virtual pages of small size or page <b>hit</b> <b>counters)</b> do not degrade performance of Web servers and operating systems.

50|$|During {{the use of}} {{the break}} laser, the vessel becomes invincible and all enemy {{projectiles}} can be destroyed. Each enemy projectile destroyed by the break laser increases the <b>hit</b> <b>counter</b> by one. At the end of a level, this <b>hit</b> <b>counter</b> is multiplied by 5000 and added on to the score as a bonus. This scoring system is unique to Border Down and encourages the player to take risks. In most games, the player is usually motivated to eliminate bosses as quickly as possible, whereas the goal here is to utilize the time given to attain a higher hit count. If the player exceeds a certain score defined by levels, it can go up to a different border before the beginning of the following level.|$|E

The data collected by these monitors serves as input to an analytical model of cache and memory behavior, which produces an accurate overall miss-rate for the collection of processes time-sharing or space-sharing a cache.

50|$|Unlike its Time Crisis counterparts, Razing Storm puts {{a unique}} {{emphasis}} on the player's score and performance, with frequent checkpoints, score reports, and commentary for hit chains to let the player know how he's doing, and how he compares to other players before him. As the player scores continuous hits on enemies in short periods of time, his <b>hit</b> <b>counter</b> increases, giving score bonuses and compliments from other characters at certain milestones (Scoring a 50, 100, 150 hit chain, etc.). The hit counter/chain is also added to and extended by destroying the surrounding environment, such as shooting out windows, railings, fruit stands, and concrete barriers. Large score bonuses are also given for quick completion of areas, as a time bonus, and for destroying environmental hazards that harm enemies. This scoring system gives players incentive to attack and shoot continuously and recklessly, taking risks for a high score, rather than playing defensively to simply complete the game.|$|E

40|$|One-counter MDPs (OC-MDPs) and one-counter simple {{stochastic}} games (OC-SSGs) are 1 -player, and 2 -player turn-based zero-sum, stochastic {{games played}} on the transition graph of classic one-counter automata (equivalently, pushdown automata with a 1 -letter stack alphabet). A key objective for the analysis and verification of these games is the termination objective, where the players aim to maximize (minimize, respectively) the probability of <b>hitting</b> <b>counter</b> value 0, starting at a given control state and given counter value. Recently, we studied qualitative decision problems ("is the optimal termination value = 1 ?") for OC-MDPs (and OC-SSGs) and showed them to be decidable in P-time (in NP and coNP, respectively). However, quantitative decision and approximation problems ("is the optimal termination value ? p", or "approximate the termination value within epsilon") are far more challenging. This is so in part because optimal strategies may not exist, and because {{even when they do}} exist they can have a highly non-trivial structure. It thus remained open even whether any of these quantitative termination problems are computable. In this paper we show that all quantitative approximation problems for the termination value for OC-MDPs and OC-SSGs are computable. Specifically, given a OC-SSG, and given epsilon > 0, we can compute a value v that approximates the value of the OC-SSG termination game within additive error epsilon, and furthermore we can compute epsilon-optimal strategies for both players in the game. A key ingredient in our proofs is a subtle martingale, derived from solving certain LPs that we can associate with a maximizing OC-MDP. An application of Azuma's inequality on these martingales yields a computable bound for the "wealth" at which a "rich person's strategy" becomes epsilon-optimal for OC-MDPs.
