5|$|Nowadays, the National Curriculum Guidelines have {{provisions}} for those learning Icelandic whose mother tongue is {{a foreign language}} and deaf and hearing-impaired pupils.

The press has over 2,800 books in print. The publishing house was known as the McGill University Press in 1963 prior to it amalgamating with Queen's in 1969.|$|E

5|$|The {{gameplay}} of Snake Eater {{is similar}} to that of previous games in the Metal Gear Solid series. Snake, controlled by the player, must move undetected through a hostile, enemy-filled environment. Although Snake acquires various weapons (ranging from handguns to rocket propelled grenades), the <b>emphasis</b> <b>is</b> on using stealth to avoid confrontations. A number of objects and gadgets can be found along the way to aid in this, including motion detectors to track hostile soldiers, and the Metal Gear series' trademark cardboard box, which Snake can hide under to avoid visual detection.|$|E
5|$|The infrageneric {{classification}} of the fungus is unclear, and {{depends on what}} taxonomic characters are deemed most important. According to Takahashi, the mushroom's violet pigment, the inamyloid (not staining when treated with Melzer's reagent) hymenophoral tissue (hymenium-bearing tissue), and the smooth hyphae of the outer layer of stem suggest a placement in the section Adonideae (Fr.) Quel., {{as defined by the}} Dutch Mycena specialist Maas Geesteranus. However, if greater taxonomic <b>emphasis</b> <b>is</b> placed on the weakly amyloid basidiospores, it would be more appropriate in the section Fragilipedes (Fr.) Quél.|$|E
40|$|This study {{deals with}} the {{relevance}} of spectral emphasis for accent detection. Spectral <b>emphasis</b> may <b>be</b> described as an acoustic feature reflecting the relative intensity in the higher frequency bands. In an experiment using a rudimentary accent detector, spectral <b>emphasis</b> <b>was</b> shown to be more useful {{for the detection of}} accents than overall intensity. Furthermore, spectral <b>emphasis</b> <b>was</b> found to outperform f 0 in certain conditions. It is argued here, therefore, that it might be worthwhile to include spectral emphasis in systems using a combination of acoustic features for automatic classification of prosodic categories. 1...|$|R
