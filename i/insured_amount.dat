50|$|To {{address these}} issues, Congress {{introduced}} the Price-Anderson Act in 1957.

40|$|Abstract This {{study is}} to {{investigate}} the determinants of the demand for life insurance policies in Taiwan. Specifically, the regression analysis is implemented in this thesis. The dependent variables considered in this thesis include insured amounts and premiums for overall and five individual insurances including while life, term life, endowment, health and accidental insurances. The dependent variables considered for the regression analysis are the personal characteristics including age, sex, marriage status, and the components of insurance policy, such as the way of pay, claim experience, etc. The empirical {{results show that the}} significances of determinants in the <b>insured</b> <b>amount</b> and premium regressions are different. Besides, the empirical results are also different for individual life insurances. The most interesting finding is that the coefficient of determinant (R-squares) in the regression for overall insurance is much less than the ones in the regressions for individual insurances. The independent variables, the way of pay, claim experience, and martial status are always insignificant in all regressions. The variable, condition, is significant in all regressions for individual insurance but not in the regression for overall insurance. The other variables are commonly significant in regressions for overall and individual insurances. Keywords: Life insurance, <b>Insured</b> <b>amount,</b> Premium, Regression analysis摘要 本研究旨在探討保額及保費，在所有商品及個別險種間的決定因素為何？為了達成此研究的目的，我們從實際的樣本保單及保戶的資料中，參考其他文獻資料，篩選出包含要被保人性別、年齡、理賠、婚姻狀況等變數，透過線性迴歸的方法來探討，利用敘述統計迴歸分析及共變異係數等方式來說明分析保額及保費對於各險種之間的決定因素。 實證結果發現，在保費的部分，不同險種間對於同樣的變數，有著不同的解釋，有些顯著，有些則不然。同樣是性別的這個變數，在終身壽險看來就較不顯著，而養老保險對於性別來說就比較明顯，情況可能是大多數的女性保戶較男性保戶更在意退休規劃的議題，其他如定期壽險也有相似的情形，男性投保的比率整體看來較女性為高，對於保障的需求，單身和已婚者在保障的部分，有明顯的差別。但在保額的變動部分，實證結果發現，無論是婚姻狀況或者年齡等變數，在解釋保額變化的部分，都沒有顯著的表現，可見我們無法用年齡的多寡或者婚姻的狀況來提供增加保額的理由，這和我們一般的想法並不吻合。可見在保額的規劃部分，還有許多我們沒有找到的變數。 關鍵字：壽險、保額、保費、迴歸分析目錄 第一章	 緒論…………………………………………………………………… [...] 1 第一節	 研究背景…………………………………………………………… 1 第二節	 研究動機…………………………………………………………… 1 第三節	 研究目的…………………………………………………………… 2 第四節	 研究流程…………………………………………………………… 2 第二章	 台灣地區人壽保險產業概況與文獻回顧…………………………… [...] 4 第一節	 人身保險之定義……………………………………………. ……… 4 第二節	 台灣地區人壽保險產業概況……………………………. ………… 5. 第三節 文獻回顧孤兒保單的定義與形成…………………………………… 16 第三章	 研究方法……………………………………………………………… 20 第一節	 研究資料與限制…………………………………………………… 20 第二節	 變數說明…………………………………………………………… 20 第四章	 研究結果與分析………………………………………………………. 23 第一節以保費為應變數所做的迴歸結果………………. …………… [...] ……… 23 第二節以保額為應變數所做的迴歸結果………………………… [...] …… [...] … [...] 32 第五章	 結論與建議 [...] . ………………………………………………………… [...] . 36 文獻參考 [...] . ………………………………………………………… [...] 37 											 表目次 表一、保險業家數及其分支機構……………………………………………… 6 表二、國情統計資料表 ……………………………………………………………………. 6 表三、壽險業占金融機構資產比率表………………………………………… 7 表四、保險密度、滲透度、人壽及年金保險投保率表……………………………. 7 表五、保險業保費收入統計表………………………………………………… [...] 8 表六、人身保險業保費收入統計表…………………………………………… [...] 8 表七、 98 年第一季保費收入一覽表……………………………………………. 9 表八、各險種 98 年第一季保費收入表…………………………… [...] …………. 10 表九、保險業重大事件一覽表…………………………………………………. 12 表十、壽險業務員登錄一覽表…………………………………………………. 18 表十一保費為應變數所做的迴歸結果表……………………. ………………… 34 表十二 保額為應變數所做的迴歸結果表……………………………………… 3...|$|E

Thus it is necessary to show behavior of this new equation by numerical methods.

50|$|Involves {{accepting}} the loss, or benefit of gain, from a risk when it occurs. True self insurance falls in this category. Risk retention {{is a viable}} strategy for small risks where the cost of insuring against the risk would be greater over time than the total losses sustained. All risks that are not avoided or transferred are retained by default. This includes risks that are so large or catastrophic that either they cannot be insured against or the premiums would be infeasible. War is an example since most property and risks are not insured against war, so the loss attributed by war is retained by the <b>insured.</b> Also any <b>amounts</b> of potential loss (risk) over the <b>amount</b> <b>insured</b> is retained risk.

In both cases we also provide the optimal life insurance strategies in the case where risky-asset investments are not allowed (or not taken into consideration), as in basic life insurance mathematics. The optimal constrained strategies are somewhat more complex than the unconstrained ones, but the latter can serve to ease the understanding and implementation of the former. ...|$|R
40|$|Cereal {{production}} {{accounts for}} about seventy percent of all agricultural land in Morocco. Cereal producer prices, influenced by the government, are higher than world prices. Production is divided into six broad agro-climatic zones. About half of cereal production is concentrated in the favorable, and intermediate zones; the rest occurs mostly in less favorable (arid and semi-arid) zones, with average annual rainfall below 450 millimeters. The authors assess the feasibility of rainfall-based index insurance, to provide effective, low-cost drought insurance for Moroccan farmers, and rural dwellers. Their analysis focuses on Morocco's three main cereal crops - hard wheat, soft wheat, and barley - using data on annual production, and planting from 1978 - 99. Maize is included {{in some of the}} analysis. The benefits of this program over the traditional insurance scheme are that it minimizes the risk of moral hazard, and adverse selection, and promotes a streamlined pay-out-process. These features make the program more attractive to international re-insurers, and investors in capital markets. A rainfall-indexed insurance product is feasible in Morocco, where the statistical correlation between rainfall, and cereal revenues is rather strong in seventeen provinces in the more favorable agro-climatic zones. Proportional rainfall insurance contracts, would pay the <b>insured</b> an <b>amount</b> based on the shortfall in actual rainfall, during a set period, compared with the trigger rainfall. The contracts could be purchased in any amount, allowing farmers to <b>insure</b> the full <b>amount</b> of their expected revenue, if they wish.
