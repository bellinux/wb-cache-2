5|$|The synagogue {{occupied}} {{the greater part}} of the plot, facing west. It receded <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> regulation-line in accordance with the rule then still enforced in Austria–Hungary, prohibiting non-Catholic places of worship from having a public entrance <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>street.</b> The synagogue had a wider and slightly higher central nave and two narrower naves; unlike Förster's synagogue in Vienna, it did not have a basilical plan.|$|E
5|$|At the {{southern}} end of the Western Wall, Robinson's Arch along with a row of vaults once supported stairs ascending <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> to the Temple Mount. Because it does not come under the direct control of the Rabbi of the Wall or the Ministry of Religious Affairs, the site has been opened to religious groups that hold worship services that would not be approved by the Rabbi or the Ministry in the major men's and women's prayer areas against the Wall.|$|E
5|$|It {{will also}} have glass walls, which {{according}} to DITIB spokesman Alboga will give visitors a feeling of openness. According to the architect, openness is further enhanced by an inviting staircase <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>street.</b> The developers have required that the secular areas of the mosque (e.g. the restaurant, event halls and stores) be open to people of all religions.|$|E

50|$|The synagogue {{is located}} in an urban landscape, {{concealed}} within the block behind a fence and wall, recessed in an oblique building <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets.</b> <b>The</b> main facade of the synagogue faces an inner courtyard, since Portuguese law in the 19th century forbade non-Catholic religious temples <b>from</b> facing <b>the</b> <b>street.</b>|$|R

5|$|Dominating the {{appearance}} of the house <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> is a large verandah-style porch, supported by large stone columns, on the southern-facing front of the house; an enclosed porch, smaller but two stories high and supported by wooden pillars, is located on the rear portion of the house's east side. Projecting {{from the front of the}} house, above the porch, is a small wing with a gable, semicircular window, and elaborate cornice. The house is built in a combination of styles; it includes many Italianate details, but its design appears to have been influenced by the architecture of the Sears Modern Homes.|$|E
5|$|Hugh Corbett, an {{entrepreneur}} {{with a background}} in the hotel industry, opened The Slug and Lettuce pub on Islington Green, North London in 1984. At the time, Islington was becoming increasingly gentrified due to its proximity to the City of London financial district. Corbett owned {{a small number of}} pubs, which he rechristened with humorous or nonsensical names, with the effect of differentiating them from competitors. His pubs had the then notable differential of stripped out carpets and enlarged windows so that people could see inside <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>street.</b> Corbett listed his business in 1989 as Fast Forward, by which time it was a nine-strong chain. In 1990 Roger Protz identified the group as an imitation of David Bruce's Firkin chain pubs.|$|E
5|$|It {{stands on}} a granite {{pedestal}} also designed by Marochetti and made by Freeman & Co. of Penryn, Cornwall. Bas-relief panels showing Crusaders fighting the Saracens at the Battle of Ascalon and Richard on his deathbed pardoning Bertran de Born, the archer who fatally shot him in 1199, {{were added to the}} east and west sides of the pedestal in 1866–67. As the statue cannot be accessed by the general public – the area around it is used as the House of Lords car park – the west-side scene showing Richard and Bertran is the only one visible <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>street.</b> According to Marochetti, the two bas-reliefs were designed in the style of Lorenzo Ghiberti's doors at the Florence Baptistry. Bronze letters {{on the front of the}} pedestal bear the inscription RICHARD I CŒUR DE LION / 1189–1199.|$|E

5|$|Maloney cast John Franklyn-Robbins as the Time Lord {{because he}} had worked with him before and {{intended}} his character to resemble Death in The Seventh Seal. Hilary Minster, who played a Thal soldier, had also played a Thal in Planet of the Daleks (1973). Minster had been considered {{for the role of}} Mogran. Peter Miles previously played Dr. Lawrence in Doctor Who and the Silurians (1970) and Professor Whitaker in Invasion of the Dinosaurs (1974). Stephen Yardley, who played the Muto Sevrin, later appeared in Vengeance on Varos (1985). During filming of Genesis, Yardley walked into the casting department on his lunch break in costume and asked for a job; because of his costume, they assumed he was a tramp <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>street.</b> Dennis Chinnery, who played Gharman, had previously been seen in The Chase (1965) and would later appear in The Twin Dilemma (1984).|$|E
5|$|Mauve took Van Gogh on as {{a student}} and {{introduced}} him to watercolour, which he worked on for the next month before returning home for Christmas. He quarrelled with his father, refusing to attend church, and left for The Hague. Within a month Van Gogh and Mauve fell out, possibly over the viability of drawing from plaster casts. Van Gogh could afford to hire only people <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> as models, a practice of which Mauve seems to have disapproved. In June Van Gogh suffered a bout of gonorrhoea and spent three weeks in hospital. Soon after, he first painted in oils, bought with money borrowed from Theo. He liked the medium, and spread the paint liberally, scraping from the canvas and working back with the brush. He wrote that he {{was surprised at how}} good the results were.|$|E
5|$|On the 42nd Street {{side of the}} Chrysler Building, a {{staircase}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> leads directly under the building to the New York City Subway station at Grand Central–42nd Street. It {{is part of the}} structure's original design. The Interborough Rapid Transit Company, which at the time was the operator of all the routes serving the 42nd Street station, originally sued to block construction of the new entrance because it would cause crowding, but the New York City Board of Transportation pushed to allow the corridor anyway. Chrysler eventually built and paid for the building's subway entrance. Work on the new entrance started in March 1930 and it opened along with the Chrysler Building two months later.|$|E

5|$|Starting from George M. Ewing's {{original}} design {{of an office}} tower, Pietro Belluschi and George M. Ewing Co. turned the Rohm and Haas Corporate Headquarters into a , nine-story low horizontal block. At the corner of 6th Street and Market Street, two blocks away from Independence Hall, the Rohm and Haas Corporate Headquarters front facade runs parallel along 6th Street looking towards the Independence Mall. The reinforced concrete framed building sits on flaring concrete columns and is set back <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> by a raised plaza. The landscaped plaza cuts {{through the middle of}} the ground level of the building, opening up to a larger plaza with a fountain and small pool. The plaza behind the building allows public access to an alley that leads to Seventh Street.|$|E
5|$|The Federal Reserve Bank Building {{is located}} on a half-block {{on the west side}} of 2nd Avenue between Madison Street and Spring Street. The Modernist {{building}} consists of six stories, four above street level and two below, and is composed of structural steel and reinforced concrete. The main facade, facing 2nd Avenue, is clad partially in light gray Indiana limestone; the basement's exterior walls are clad in reddish-brown granite. A small plaza on 2nd Avenue in front of the building's main entrance, setback <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> by , features terraced planters finished with polished granite and serve as a plinth.|$|E
5|$|The McCanns' {{children}} {{slept in}} a bedroom next to the front door, which the McCanns kept locked. The bedroom had one waist-high window with curtains and a metal exterior shutter, the latter controlled by a cord inside the window; the McCanns kept the curtains and shutter closed throughout the holiday. The window overlooked a narrow walkway and residents' car park, which was separated by a low wall <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>street.</b> Madeleine {{slept in a}} single bed next to the bedroom door, {{on the opposite side}} of the room from the window, while the twins were in travel cots in the middle of the room.

5|$|The Pulaski {{station was}} {{designed}} by the City of Chicago. The station house is at ground level and is set back <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>street.</b> It has a glass and steel façade, and most features within the station house are either made of stainless steel or painted white. The station's island platform is accessible from the station house via stairs, escalators, and an elevator. The platform serves the Orange Line's two tracks; the track to the Loop is located to the south, and the track to Midway located to the north. A canopy covers the entire platform. A bus terminal is located {{to the north of}} the station. To the west of the bus terminal and north of the railroad tracks is the Pulaski park and ride lot. The park and ride lot has 390 spaces which cost $4 for 12 hours and is operated by Standard Parking.|$|E
5|$|The {{buildings}} along Alrov Mamilla Avenue are spaced irregularly {{rather than}} {{placed in a}} continuous line. The open areas between the buildings accommodate different types of public areas, while the spaces themselves afford views of the historic landmarks beyond the avenue, such as the Tower of David and Jaffa Gate. The buildings lining the avenue range in height from three to six stories, with the higher stories set back <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> line. There is also a two-story, domed atrium housing shops and restaurants.|$|E
