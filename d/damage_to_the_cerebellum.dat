5|$|Further {{significant}} developments did {{not come}} until the Renaissance. Vesalius discussed the cerebellum briefly, and the anatomy was described more thoroughly by Thomas Willis in 1664. More anatomical work was done during the 18th century, {{but it was not}} until early in the 19th century that the first insights into the function of the cerebellum were obtained. Luigi Rolando in 1809 established the key finding that <b>damage</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cerebellum</b> results in motor disturbances. Jean Pierre Flourens in the first half of the 19th century carried out detailed experimental work, which revealed that animals with cerebellar damage can still move, but with a loss of coordination (strange movements, awkward gait, and muscular weakness), and that recovery after the lesion can be nearly complete unless the lesion is very extensive. By the beginning of the 20th century, it was widely accepted that the primary function of the cerebellum relates to motor control; the first half of the 20th century produced several detailed descriptions of the clinical symptoms associated with cerebellar disease in humans.|$|E
25|$|Because of the <b>damage</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cerebellum,</b> {{which is}} {{essential}} for coordinating muscle movements and balance, patients with ataxic cerebral palsy experience problems in coordination, specifically in their arms, legs, and trunk. Ataxic cerebral palsy is known to decrease muscle tone.|$|E
500|$|<b>Damage</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>{{cerebellum}}</b> often causes motor-related symptoms, {{the details}} of which depend {{on the part of}} the cerebellum involved and how it is damaged. Damage to the [...] flocculonodular lobe may show up as a loss of equilibrium and in particular an altered, irregular walking gait, with a wide stance caused by difficulty in balancing. Damage to the lateral zone typically causes problems in skilled voluntary and planned movements which can cause errors in the force, direction, speed and amplitude of movements. Other manifestations include hypotonia (decreased muscle tone), dysarthria (problems with speech articulation), dysmetria (problems judging distances or ranges of movement), dysdiadochokinesia (inability to perform rapid alternating movements such as walking), impaired check reflex or rebound phenomenon, and intention tremor (involuntary movement caused by alternating contractions of opposing muscle groups). Damage to the midline portion may disrupt whole-body movements, whereas damage localized more laterally is more likely to disrupt fine movements of the hands or limbs. Damage to the upper part of the cerebellum tends to cause gait impairments and other problems with leg coordination; damage to the lower part is more likely to cause uncoordinated or poorly aimed movements of the arms and hands, as well as difficulties in speed. This complex of motor symptoms is called ataxia.|$|E
50|$|Ataxic {{dysarthria}} is {{an acquired}} neurological and sensorimotor speech deficit. It {{is a common}} diagnosis among the clinical spectrum of ataxic disorders. Since regulation of skilled movements is a primary function of <b>the</b> <b>cerebellum,</b> <b>damage</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> superior <b>cerebellum</b> and <b>the</b> superior cerebellar peduncle is believed to produce this form of dysarthria in ataxic patients. Growing evidence supports the likelihood of cerebellar involvement specifically affecting speech motor programming and execution pathways, producing the characteristic features associated with ataxic dysarthria. This link to speech motor control can explain the abnormalities in articulation and prosody, which are hallmarks of this disorder. Some of the most consistent abnormalities observed in patients with ataxia dysarthria are alterations of the normal timing pattern, with prolongation of certain segments and a tendency <b>to</b> equalize <b>the</b> duration of syllables when speaking. As {{the severity of the}} dysarthria increases, the patient may also lengthen more segments as well as increase the degree of lengthening of each individual segment.|$|R
40|$|Cerebellar lesions {{can cause}} motor deficits and/or the {{cerebellar}} cognitive affective syndrome (CCAS; Schmahmann's syndrome). We used voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping <b>to</b> test <b>the</b> {{hypothesis that the}} cerebellar motor syndrome results from anterior lobe damage whereas lesions in <b>the</b> posterolateral <b>cerebellum</b> produce <b>the</b> CCAS. Eighteen patients with isolated cerebellar stroke (13 males, 5 females; 20 – 66  years old) were evaluated using measures of ataxia and neurocognitive ability. Patients showed {{a wide range of}} motor and cognitive performance, from normal to severely impaired; individual deficits varied according to lesion location within <b>the</b> <b>cerebellum.</b> Patients with <b>damage</b> <b>to</b> cerebellar lobules III–VI had worse ataxia scores: as predicted, the cerebellar motor syndrome resulted from lesions involving <b>the</b> anterior <b>cerebellum.</b> Poorer performance on fine motor tasks was associated primarily with strokes affecting the anterior lobe extending into lobule VI, with right-handed finger tapping and peg-placement associated with <b>damage</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> right <b>cerebellum,</b> and left-handed finger tapping associated with left cerebellar damage. Patients with the CCAS in the absence of cerebellar motor syndrome had <b>damage</b> <b>to</b> posterior lobe regions, with lesions leading to significantly poorer scores on language (e. g. right Crus I and II extending through IX), spatial (bilateral Crus I, Crus II, and right lobule VIII), and executive function measures (lobules VII–VIII). These data reveal clinically significant functional regions underpinning movement and cognition in <b>the</b> <b>cerebellum,</b> with a broad anterior-posterior distinction. Motor and cognitive outcomes following cerebellar <b>damage</b> appear <b>to</b> reflect <b>the</b> disruption of different cerebro-cerebellar motor and cognitive loops...|$|R
40|$|Research {{suggests}} that <b>the</b> <b>cerebellum</b> {{is involved in}} cognition, but its exact role is unclear. The efficiency theory posits that <b>the</b> <b>cerebellum</b> supports processing speed. Other researchers argue that <b>the</b> <b>cerebellum</b> is functionally heterogeneous, and <b>damage</b> <b>to</b> lobes of <b>the</b> <b>cerebellum</b> causes selective loss of cognitive functions. This study sought to determine whether selective impairment in motor, verbal fluency, or processing speed occurred depending on the lobe of <b>the</b> <b>cerebellum</b> that was lesioned. Lesion mapping {{was used to measure}} lesion size and volumetric methods were used to measure atrophy in 25 adult survivors of cerebellar tumors. Participants had too a high degree of heterogeneous cerebellar lesions and accompanying atrophy to explore specialization. However, total cerebellar atrophy negatively impacted written and oral processing speed to a greater degree than total cerebellar lesion size. Younger ages at diagnosis and radiation therapy were associated with greater cerebellar atrophy...|$|R
2500|$|Cerebellar abiotrophy (CA), also {{referred}} to as [...] the cerebellar cortical abiotrophy (CCA), is a genetic [...] neurological disease in animals best known to affect certain breeds of horses, dogs and cats. It can also develop in humans. It develops when the neurons known as Purkinje cells, located in the cerebellum of the brain, begin to die off. [...] These cells affect balance and coordination. They have a critical role to play in the brain. [...] The Purkinje layer allows communication between the granular and molecular cortical layers in the cerebellum. Put simply, without Purkinje cells, an animal loses its sense of space and distance, making balance and coordination difficult. [...] People with <b>damage</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cerebellum</b> can experience symptoms like unsteady gait, poor muscle control, and trouble speaking or swallowing.|$|E
2500|$|Ataxic {{cerebral}} palsy is observed in approximately 5-10% {{of all cases}} of {{cerebral palsy}}, making it the least frequent form of cerebral palsy. Ataxic cerebral palsy is caused by damage to cerebellar structures. [...] Because of the <b>damage</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cerebellum,</b> which is essential for coordinating muscle movements and balance, patients with ataxic cerebral palsy experience problems in coordination, specifically in their arms, legs, and trunk. Ataxic cerebral palsy is known to decrease muscle tone. [...] The most common manifestation of ataxic cerebral palsy is intention (action) tremor, which is especially apparent when carrying out precise movements, such as tying shoe laces or writing with a pencil. This symptom gets progressively worse as the movement persists, causing the hand to shake. As the hand gets closer to accomplishing the intended task, the trembling intensifies which {{makes it even more}} difficult to complete.|$|E
2500|$|Cerebellar tremor (also {{known as}} {{intention}} tremor) is a slow, broad tremor of the extremities that {{occurs at the}} end of a purposeful movement, such as trying to press a button or touching a finger to the tip of one’s nose. Cerebellar tremor is caused by lesions in or <b>damage</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cerebellum</b> resulting from stroke, tumor, or disease such as multiple sclerosis or some inherited degenerative disorder. [...] It can also result from chronic alcoholism or overuse of some medicines. In classic cerebellar tremor, a lesion on one side of the brain produces a tremor in that same side of the body that worsens with directed movement. Cerebellar damage can also produce a “wing-beating” type of tremor called rubral or Holmes’ tremor— a combination of rest, action, and postural tremors. The tremor is often most prominent when the affected person is active or is maintaining a particular posture. Cerebellar tremor may be accompanied by other manifestations of ataxia, including dysarthria (speech problems), nystagmus (rapid, involuntary rolling of the eyes), gait problems and postural tremor of the trunk and neck. [...] Titubation is tremor of the head and is of cerebellar origin.|$|E
40|$|<b>Damage</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{vestibular}} <b>cerebellum</b> {{results in}} dysfunctional standing posture control. Patients with cerebellum dysfunction {{have a larger}} sway {{in the center of}} gravity while standing compared with healthy subjects. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a noninvasive technique for selectively exciting or inhibiting specific neural structures with potential applications in functional assessment and treatment of neural disorders. However, the specific stimulation parameters for influencing postural control have not been assessed. In this study, we investigated the influence of tDCS when applied over <b>the</b> <b>cerebellum</b> on standing posture control. Sixteen healthy subjects received tDCS (20 min, 2 mA) over the scalp 2 cm below the inion. In experiment 1, all 16 subjects received tDCS under three stimulus conditions, Sham, Cathodal, and Anodal, in a random order with the second electrode placed on the forehead. In experiment 2, five subjects received cathodal stimulation only with the second electrode placed over the right buccinator muscle. Center of gravity sway was measured twice for 60 s before and after tDCS in a standing posture with eyes open and legs closed, and average total locus length, locus length per second, rectangular area, and enveloped area were calculated. In experiment 1, total locus length and locus length per second decreased significantly after cathodal stimulation but not after anodal or sham stimulation, while no tDCS condition influenced rectangular or enveloped areas. In experiment 2, cathodal tDCS again significantly reduced total locus length and locus length per second but not rectangular and enveloped areas. The effects of tDCS on postural control are polarity-dependent, likely reflecting the selective excitation or inhibition of cerebellar Purkinje cells. Cathodal tDCS <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cerebellum</b> of healthy subjects can alter body sway (velocity) ...|$|R
50|$|Scientists have {{attributed}} major {{control of}} the temporal aspects of prosody, including rhythm and timing, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left hemisphere of the brain. On the other hand, pitch perception, such as singing and linguistics related to emotion, {{are believed to be}} organized in the right hemisphere. This belief led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> development of the “Functional Lateralization” hypothesis, stating that dysprosody can be caused by lesions in either the right or left hemispheres. It further states that the left is responsible for acoustic and temporal aspects of prosody, while the right is responsible for pitch and emotion. This hypothesis, however, has also been a cause for concern as studies have shown that people with left hemispheric damage exhibit prosodic deficiencies associated with the right hemisphere as defined by the functional lateralization hypothesis and vice versa. It has also been found that <b>damage</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> medulla, <b>cerebellum,</b> and basal ganglia may cause dysprosody. These conclusions have led scientists to believe that prosodic organization in the brain is extremely complex and cannot be attributed to hemispheric divisions alone. Although not well understood yet, studies to identify prosodic organization in the brain continue, primarily through the examination of damaged brain areas in patients suffering from dysprosody and their resulting vocal deficiencies. In addition, dysprosody has been associated with several other diseases, including Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, gelastic epilepsy (gelastic seizure), and behavioral disorders such as apathy, akinesia and aboulia. Understanding these disorders and the areas of the brain affected in each case is key in conducting further studies of dysprosody. Scientists are continuing to study these patients in the hope of creating more concrete connections between areas of brain damage and prosodic abnormalities, which will hopefully someday lead to a full understanding of prosodic organization in the brain.|$|R
40|$|Sex steroids assist adult {{neural tissue}} in the {{protection}} from and repair of damage resulting from neural injury; some steroids may be synthesized in the brain. Songbirds are especially useful models to explore steroidal neuroprotection and repair. First, the full suite of cholesterol transporters and steroidogenic enzymes are expressed in the zebra finch (ZF) brain. Second, estrogens promote recovery of behavioral function after <b>damage</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> adult ZF <b>cerebellum.</b> Third, <b>the</b> estrogen synthetic enzyme aromatase is rapidly upregulated in reactive glia following neural injury, including in <b>the</b> ZF <b>cerebellum.</b> We hypothesized that cerebellar injury would locally upregulate steroidogenic factors upstream of aromatase, providing the requisite substrate for neuroestrogen synthesis. We tested this hypothesis by lesioning <b>the</b> <b>cerebellum</b> of adult songbirds using {{both males and females}} that peripherally synthesize steroids in different amounts. We then used quantitative PCR to examine expression of mRNAs for the neurosteroidogenic factors TSPO, StAR, SCC, 3 β-HSD, CYP 17, and aromatase, at 2 and 8 days post-lesion. Compared to sham lesions, cerebellar lesions significantly upregulated mRNA levels of TSPO and aromatase. Sex differences in response <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lesions were detected for TSPO, StAR, and aromatase. All birds responded to experimental conditions by showing time-dependent changes in the expression of TSPO, SCC, and aromatase, suggesting that acute trauma or stress may impact neurosteroidogensis for many days. These data suggest that <b>the</b> <b>cerebellum</b> is an active site of steroid synthesis in the brain, and each steroidogenic factor likely provides neuroprotection and promotes repair...|$|R
2500|$|Peek {{was born}} in Salt Lake City, Utah with macrocephaly, <b>damage</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cerebellum,</b> and {{agenesis}} of the corpus callosum, {{a condition in which}} the bundle of nerves that connects the two hemispheres of the brain is missing; in Peek's case, secondary connectors such as the anterior commissure were also missing. There is speculation that his neurons made unusual connections due to the absence of a corpus callosum, which resulted in an increased memory capacity. According to Peek's father, Fran (Francis) Peek, Kim was able to memorize things from the age of 16–20 months. He read books, memorized them, and then placed them upside down on the shelf to show that he had finished reading them, a practice he maintained all his life. He could speed through a book in about an hour and remember almost everything he had read, memorizing vast amounts of information in subjects ranging from history and literature, geography and numbers to sports, music and dates. Peek read by scanning the left page with his left eye, then the right page with his right eye.

40|$|Post-stroke {{depression}} (PSD) is {{the most}} common neuropsychological sequela of stroke and occurs in approximately one-third of all stroke survivors. However, there are no well-established predictors of PSD. Depression in stroke patients is correlated with unfavorable outcomes. Meta-analyses of the relationship between PSD and lesion location have yielded contradictory results and have not adequately addressed the impact of cerebellar lesions. Furthermore, other brain regions associated with depression in patients with cerebellar stroke remain a matter of debate. For these reasons, this cross-sectional study investigated the relationship between PSD and lesion location in patients with isolated cerebellar stroke. Twenty-four patients in the subacute rehabilitative period following a first-ever isolated cerebellar stroke were enrolled in the study. Depressive mood were evaluated using the Geriatric Depression Scale. Regions of interest were drawn manually on T 1 -weighted magnetic resonance images using MRIcron software, and data were normalized to a standard brain template in order <b>to</b> examine <b>the</b> neural correlates of depression using voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping analysis. Voxel-wise subtraction and χ (Ayerbe et al., 2014) analyses indicated that <b>damage</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left posterior cerebellar hemisphere was associated with depression. Significant correlations were also found between the severity of depressive symptoms and lesions in lobules VI, VIIb, VIII, Crus I, and Crus II of the left cerebellar hemisphere (Pcorrected =  0. 045). Our results suggest that <b>damage</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left posterior <b>cerebellum</b> is associated with increased depressive mood severity in patients with isolated cerebellar stroke...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} soybean extract (Glycine max) on NR 2 B expression, {{cognitive}} vitality and neurotoxicity {{have not been}} exclusively reported. Here, we examined the correlation between Glycine max concentration and the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor NR 2 B. We observed the brain weight, bodyweight and body movement in animals that recieved soybean extract in their food. Brain tissues from five groups of rats treated with five different concentrations of soybean extract (5 - 50 % of total diet calories) were collected. Rats without treatment served as the control group. NR 2 B expression was determined using RT-PCR. Average values of escape latency (EL) on day four in the control, 5 %, 10 % and 20 % groups were 34. 5, 29. 67, 27. 2 and 33. 83 seconds, respectively. The EL of the 10 % group was significantly shorter {{than that of the}} control. The low (5 - 10 %) and moderate (20 %) extract concentrations were not found to induce any abnormality in body movements, whereas the high concentration (40 - 50 %) groups were found to have some movement disorders after four weeks of administration. <b>The</b> <b>cerebellum</b> weight of <b>the</b> high concentration group (50 %) was decreased 18 % from the pre-treatment weight, and this decrease might be related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> movement abnormality, which was possibly due to a defect of the CNS in this group. Specifically, we speculated that this abnormality might be due <b>to</b> <b>damage</b> in <b>the</b> <b>cerebellum.</b> These events might be initiated by an increase of NR 2 B as an adaptive process in the low and high soybean extract groups (5 - 40 %), followed by a sudden decrease in NR 2 B in the 50 % group due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> possibility of brain injury. The low percentage Glycine max extract diet (< 5 %) is recommended, and 5 - 10 % can be tolerated, but more than 20 % is not recommended.
