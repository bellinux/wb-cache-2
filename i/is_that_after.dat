5|$|The move 6.Nf3 {{controls}} the e5-square {{in order to}} prepare the push f4–f5. Unlike after 5...Nec6, White {{does not have to}} fear 6...Bc5?!, which encounters difficulties after 7.f5! Nh4 8.Ng5!, when the black knight is already in danger of being lost to Qd1–g4 or Qd1–h5. Instead Black must react quickly with 6...Bb4+ 7.Nc3 when he can adopt a normal setup with d6/0-0/Nc6/b6 or act boldly with 7...Qf6 threatening both the Nc3 and the f4-pawn. One point in favour of 7...Qf6 <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>after</b> 8.e5 Qb6 the black queen prevents White from castling short and is well placed if White castles long.|$|E
5|$|The really curious part of {{this story}} <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> <b>after</b> {{everything}} had been explained, and all had been restored to their normal courses of action, none of the personages involved in it married each other. They were all so annoyed at having made such fools of themselves that they {{walked out of the}} inn in different directions, and were never seen or heard of again.|$|E
5|$|There are oft-repeated {{historical}} {{claims that}} Joshua Norton arrived in San Francisco {{on a specific}} vessel, the Franzeska, on 23 November 1849; that he arrived with $40,000, {{in whole or in}} part a bequest from his father's estate; and that he parlayed this into a fortune of $250,000. None of this is substantiated by contemporaneous documentation. What is known <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> <b>after</b> Norton arrived in San Francisco, he enjoyed a good deal of success in commodities markets and in real estate speculation, and that by late 1852, he was one of the more prosperous, respected citizens of the city.|$|E

50|$|A key {{missing fact}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> when <b>after</b> being helped {{the first time}} (before the police arrived) <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>after</b> the initial help, Nizah {{was found in the}} street after a taxi refused her service. The taxi took off with the door open and with such force that this initial fall could have caused damage.|$|R
50|$|Another {{effect of}} rapid {{technological}} change <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>after</b> 1910 {{the rate of}} capital investment slowed, primarily due to reduced investment in business structures.|$|R
5|$|Beauchamp {{probably}} {{held the}} office of royal forester for Worcestershire as well as sheriff. The evidence for this <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>after</b> Beauchamp's death, his son William was granted the revenues from the royal forests of Worcestershire {{at the same rate}} as his father had held them; this strongly implies that the elder held {{the office of}} forester. The historian Judith Green felt that Walter de Beauchamp might possibly have held the office of constable, which had been held by his father-in-law, although the historian C. Warren Hollister felt that Beauchamp definitely did hold the office. He also a held the royal office of dispenser, an office which later became known as a butler. He acquired this because his wife inherited the office from her father. The date when he acquired the office is unknown. While a member of the royal household, Beauchamp witnessed a number of royal charters, mainly when the king was in England.|$|E
5|$|The use of wool in {{the uniform}} {{meant that the}} uniforms were not suited to the warm climates that were common in the South. This contributed to many Confederate {{soldiers}} suffering from heatstroke on long marches. However, one understanding of the heavy woolen garments <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>after</b> the marching during the day time, when the soldiers would rest at night and cool themselves down, the thermal-shock could render some men unable to function the next day. As such, the woolen garments would protect the soldiers from this, and keep them able to keep marching {{the next day to}} fulfill their duties. This was also the case with the better equipped U.S. Army. Many Confederate soldiers started the war with frock coats. However, cloth shortages and wartime wear insured that, by 1863, waist-length cadet gray or butternut shell jackets were generally worn by Confederates in the Eastern and Western Theater. Examples of frock coats being worn by enlisted men can be seen in photographs taken after the battles of Gettysburg, (1863), and Spotsylvania, (1864).|$|E
25|$|The {{key to the}} {{multiple}} drafts model <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> <b>after</b> removing qualia, explaining consciousness boils down to explaining the behaviour we recognise as conscious. Consciousness is as consciousness does.|$|E

25|$|The idea <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>after</b> {{this they}} created Prentiss McCabe, {{which is the}} subject of Absolute Power. The tone and style of Absolute Power is so {{different}} from the In the... series that it can be regarded as a totally different programme. It was produced, like so much of Tavener's work, by Dawn Ellis.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} analysts have {{suggested}} that WASP dominance of the institutional order has become {{a thing of the}} past. The accepted wisdom <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>after</b> World War II, the selection of individuals for leadership positions was increasingly based on factors such as motivation and training rather than ethnicity and social lineage.|$|E
25|$|Another {{theory on}} the {{introduction}} of Buddhism to the Malay peninsula <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>after</b> Kalinga conquered lower Burma in the 8th century their influence gradually spread down the peninsula. The Malayu language contains many words derived from the Odia language. In modern Malaysia, Indians are commonly called Keling, a name showing the original influence of Kalinga.|$|E

25|$|The {{alternate}} {{version of}} this myth <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>after</b> cutting off one head he then dipped his sword in its neck and used its venom to burn each head so it could not grow back. Hera, upset that Heracles had slain the beast she raised to kill him, placed it in the dark blue vault of the sky as the constellation Hydra. She then turned the crab into the constellation Cancer.|$|E
25|$|The common {{explanation}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>after</b> the Reformation in 1520, Basel continued {{celebrating its}} Fasnacht, {{while the other}} regions officially stopped. It is said, {{that in order to}} differ from the Catholic customs, Fasnacht was scheduled one week later starting in 1529. There are no documents from this era supporting this theory, and the resolutions from 1529 were not quoted until 200 years later.|$|E
25|$|The point <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>after</b> 4.d4 g5 5.h4 g4 White cannot {{continue}} with 6.Ne5 {{as in the}} Kieseritzky Gambit, 6.Ng5 is unsound because of 6...f6! trapping the knight, and 6.Nfd2 blocks the bishop on c1. This leaves the move 6.Ng1 as the only option, when after six moves neither side has developed a piece. The resulting slightly odd position (diagram) offers White good attacking chances.|$|E
50|$|Another thing <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>after</b> a {{long period}} like 15 years later RAVAN DAHAN has been started with {{cooperation}} of villagers although whole village not interested for <b>that</b> but it <b>was</b> new initiative for village.|$|R

25|$|Special binders {{are used}} in air-set sands to produce core at room temperature. These sands do not require a gas {{catalyst}} because organic binders and a curing catalyst are mixed together in the sand which initiates the curing process. The only disadvantage with this <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>after</b> the catalyst is mixed in there is a short time to use the sand. A third way to produce room temperature cores is by shell molding.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} EastEnders {{popularity}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>after</b> episodes, electricity {{use in the}} United Kingdom rises significantly as viewers who have waited for the show to end begin boiling water for tea, a phenomenon known as TV pickup. Over five minutes, power demand rises by three GW, the equivalent of 1.5 to 1.75 million teakettles. National Grid personnel watch the show to know when closing credits begin so they can prepare for the surge, asking for additional power from France if necessary.|$|E
25|$|In Ralph Bakshi's 1978 {{animated}} {{film version of}} The Lord of the Rings, the Nazgûl hack and slash the Hobbits' beds at The Prancing Pony inn themselves. In the book, the assailants are not precisely identified, but Tolkien implies that the attack {{was carried out by}} agents of the Nazgûl, possibly including one Bill Ferny, rather than the Nazgûl themselves (though they were present in the town). Another thing to note <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>after</b> the beds are destroyed, the Ringwraths remove their hoods, revealing hideous black masks and the armour they wear beneath their cloaks. They remain unhooded, but masked, throughout the remainder of the film.|$|E
5000|$|On 28 July 1943, Cunningham-Reid was {{involved}} in an exchange of blows {{in the lobby of}} the House of Commons with fellow Conservative MP Oliver Locker-Lampson. Cunningham-Reid's description of the incident <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>after</b> a verbal dispute, ...|$|R

25|$|According to polls, most {{computer}} {{scientists believe that}} P≠NP. A key reason for this belief <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>after</b> decades of studying these problems {{no one has been}} able to find a polynomial-time algorithm for any of more than 3000 important known NP-complete problems (see List of NP-complete problems). These algorithms were sought long before the concept of NP-completeness was even defined (Karp's 21 NP-complete problems, among the first found, were all well-known existing problems at the time they were shown to be NP-complete). Furthermore, the result P = NP would imply many other startling results that are currently believed to be false, such as NP = co-NP and P = PH.|$|E
25|$|The APG-70 {{radar system}} allows air crews to detect ground targets from longer ranges. One {{feature of this}} system <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>after</b> a sweep of a target area, the crew freezes the {{air-to-ground}} map then goes back into air-to-air mode to clear for air threats. During the air-to-surface weapon delivery, the pilot is capable of detecting, targeting and engaging air-to-air targets while the WSO designates the ground target. The APG-70 is {{to be replaced by}} the AN/APG-82(v)1 active electronically scanned array Radar (AESA) radar, which will begin flight tests in January 2010 with initial operational capability expected in 2014.|$|E
25|$|There {{are three}} reasons Zhongshan is often {{considered}} {{a continuation of}} Xianyu: Both had similar relationships with Qi and Jin, the two states were located in {{almost exactly the same}} place, and there is no historical record of Xianyu being conquered. It is considered possible that the name change marks a transition from a loosely-controlled confederation of Di tribes, to a more centralized state. One challenge to this theory of continuation <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>after</b> Zhongshan was conquered in 407-406, by the state of Wei, Marquess Wen of Wei gave the land to his eldest son Ji, and the state was based upon this. However this theory is contradicted by a line of the Shiji, in which it states that the new state of Zhongshan came some time after this. Some theories postulate that this new state was a continuation of the earlier Xianyu, and others saying the ruling family of the new Zhongshan came from a line of the Zhou. Because of this, there is no definitive answer as to the ethnicity of Zhongshan, or even to the ethnicity of the royal family; however, it is known that the country's population was mixed.|$|E
2500|$|Stańczyk {{speculates that}} one of the reasons <b>that</b> the group <b>was</b> and still is {{relatively}} unknown <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>after</b> the communist takeover of Poland in the aftermath of World War II, research on [...] "terrorist" [...] communism was strongly discouraged.|$|R
