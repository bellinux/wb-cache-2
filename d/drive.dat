5|$|A park {{entrance}} fee is charged {{at the four}} access points to the <b>drive.</b> Skyline <b>Drive</b> is a two-lane road that has 75 overlooks providing views of the Shenandoah Valley {{to the west and}} the Piedmont to the east. The <b>drive</b> provides access to numerous trails, including the Appalachian Trail, and it is also used for biking and horseback riding. Skyline <b>Drive</b> is the main road through Shenandoah National Park and has access to campgrounds, visitor centers, and resorts such as Skyland Resort and Big Meadows. The scenic <b>drive</b> is particularly popular in the fall for leaf peeping when the leaves are changing colors. Skyline <b>Drive</b> is designated a National Scenic Byway and a National Historic Landmark and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E

5|$|Four-wheel <b>drive</b> {{was decided}} against {{early in the}} {{development}} process, {{for a number of}} reasons. It was thought rear-wheel <b>drive</b> would be adequate in the majority of situations, that the additional complexity of the four-wheel <b>drive</b> system would hinder the development process and potentially be problematic for the customer. FF Developments were contracted to provide the gearbox/transaxle assembly, modifying their four-wheel <b>drive</b> transaxle assembly from the XJ220 concept into a pure rear-wheel <b>drive</b> design for the production car. A five-speed gearbox is fitted; a six-speed gearbox was considered but deemed unnecessary, as the torque characteristics of the engine made a sixth gear redundant. The transaxle featured a viscous coupling limited slip differential to improve traction.|$|E
5|$|Kent State went three-and-out {{on their}} first <b>drive</b> of the second quarter.

Kent State committed another miscue on their next <b>drive,</b> throwing an interception to Dechane Durante. Northern Illinois again capitalized, {{this time with a}} 12-play, 58-yard <b>drive</b> culminating with a 1-yard rush by Akeem Daniels.

5|$|Needing {{to score}} quickly, Virginia Tech's {{subsequent}} <b>drive</b> consisted primarily of pass plays.

5|$|Northern Illinois got {{the ball}} to start the game and, after three plays totaling three yards, were forced to punt, going three-and-out. Kent State's first <b>drive</b> also {{resulted}} in a three-and-out. The Huskies took over at their own 14 on the ensuing <b>drive</b> and managed to achieve one first down prior to having to punt. The first scoring <b>drive</b> occurred for the Golden Flashes on their second <b>drive,</b> but they were aided by Huskies' punt returner Angelo Sebastiano fumbling a Kent State punt. They {{took advantage of the}} mistake and ultimately scored on a 15-yard touchdown run by Dri Archer. After the Huskies failed to score on their next <b>drive,</b> Kent State capitalized again on a 37-yard field goal by Freddy Cortez. The final <b>drive</b> of the first quarter lasted 14 plays for 65 yards and ended in a Mathew Sims 27-yard field goal.|$|E
5|$|Oklahoma's first second-half <b>drive</b> {{resulted}} in a quick three-and-out. After a 58-yard punt by Tress Way which was downed at the Texas A 9-yard line. Despite the poor field position, the Aggies put together a 7-play, 91-yard <b>drive</b> highlighted by a 35-yard pass from Manziel to Uzoma Nwachukwu and finished with a 7-yard touchdown run by Malena. Oklahoma had another three-and-out on their next <b>drive.</b> Texas A subsequently established a 7-play, 89-yard <b>drive</b> that featured three consecutive completed passes from Manziel to Malcome Kennedy and concluded with a 30-yard rushing touchdown by Trey Williams. Oklahoma's next <b>drive</b> was their third consecutive three-and-out. Texas A then scored their third consecutive touchdown, this time on a 33-yard pass from Manziel to Ryan Swope making the score 34–13. Oklahoma then ran a 7-play, 31-yard <b>drive</b> before punting to end the quarter.|$|E

5|$|The mid-engine {{complicated}} {{the design of}} the four-wheel <b>drive</b> system, and an innovative solution was needed to get <b>drive</b> {{from the rear of the}} engine to the front wheels. The chosen design took the front-wheel <b>drive</b> from the central differential on the rear transaxle and sent it through the V in the centre of the engine using a quill <b>drive,</b> before joining an inverted differential. The clutch was a twin-plate unit designed by AP Racing.|$|E

5|$|After {{kicking off}} {{to start the}} game, Arizona got the ball first in the second half. Their first <b>drive</b> went three-and-out. After a 51-yard punt, Nevada took over at their own 11-yard line. They put {{together}} an 11-play, 89-yard <b>drive</b> that culminated with a 33-yard touchdown pass from Cody Fajardo to Richy Turner. During the course of throwing the touchdown pass, Fajardo hurt his hand and was seen shaking it {{on his way to}} the end zone to celebrate the score. He returned for Nevada's next offensive <b>drive.</b> Arizona's next <b>drive</b> got them into Nevada territory, but an interception thrown by Matt Scott ended any hopes of scoring. Nevada took the field and drove 84 yards down the field on 15 plays. Near the end of the <b>drive</b> once Nevada was inside the 10-yard line, Fajardo ran the ball for a gain of three yards. During the course of the play, he took a hit to the head from an Arizona defender. He exited the game for one play, but subsequently returned on that <b>drive</b> and scored a one-yard rushing touchdown. Arizona was held scoreless in the quarter, and heading into the final quarter of regulation, Nevada possessed a 45-28 lead.|$|E

5|$|After {{receiving}} the opening kickoff, Ball State's first <b>drive</b> stalled, and it ultimately went three-and-out. Their punter, Kyle Schmidt, managed only 24 {{yards on the}} punt, and gave Arkansas State the ball at Ball State's 36-yard line. Arkansas State failed {{to capitalize on the}} good field position, however, missing a 34-yard field goal attempt. Subsequently, the teams exchanged punts. After being pinned at their own 11-yard line, the Cardinals embarked on a 14-play, 89-yard <b>drive</b> that featured six rushes by Jahwan Edwards for a total of 44 yards, including one 22-yard rush. Also on the <b>drive,</b> Keith Wenning completed four of five passes, three of which were to Willie Snead, including a 9-yard touchdown pass that was the first score of the game. At the end of the quarter, the Red Wolves had just concluded a <b>drive,</b> that had crossed into Ball State's territory before a punt that was downed inside the 5-yard line. On that <b>drive,</b> Fredi Knighten replaced Adam Kennedy at quarterback.|$|E
5|$|After {{the ball}} {{rolled into the}} end zone for a touchback, Virginia Tech began its final <b>drive</b> at its 20-yard line. On the first play of the <b>drive,</b> Bryan Randall {{completed}} an 80-yard touchdown pass to Josh Morgan. The score plus the extra point cut Auburn's lead to 16–13. With time in the game almost exhausted, Virginia Tech was forced to attempt an onside kick {{in order to have a}} chance to get another offensive <b>drive.</b> Because the Hokies had used their final timeouts to stop the clock on Auburn's previous <b>drive,</b> Auburn would be free to run out the game's final minutes. Despite the hopes of Virginia Tech for a last-second miracle, the Auburn Tigers recovered the kick, allowing them to run out the clock and clinch a 16–13 victory.|$|E

40|$|Whereas age effects {{commonly}} {{occur in}} tests of explicit memory, tests of implicit memory often show age invariance. In two experiments, the traditional confound between test type (implicit vs explicit) and retrieval process (conceptually <b>driven</b> vs perceptually <b>driven)</b> was removed by using conceptually <b>driven</b> and perceptually <b>driven</b> tests of both implicit and explicit memory. Experiment 1 {{revealed a significant}} age effect for conceptually <b>driven</b> retrieval and no age effect for perceptually <b>driven</b> retrieval, regardless {{of the type of}} memory being measured. Experiment 2 highlighted a difference between the two age groups in their ability to utilise semantic encoding in a nominally perceptually <b>driven</b> explicit memory test.
