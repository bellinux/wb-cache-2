5|$|Naming and {{classifying}} our surroundings {{has probably}} been taking place as long as mankind {{has been able to}} communicate.

Medicinal plant illustrations show up in Egyptian wall paintings from c. 1500 BC, indicating that the uses of different species were understood and that a basic taxonomy was in place.|$|E

5|$|The {{performance}} of Sarvapitri amavasya rites can also compensate a forgotten or neglected annual Shraddha ceremony, which should ideally {{coincide with the}} death anniversary of the deceased. According to Sharma, the ceremony {{is central to the}} concept of lineages. Shraddha involves oblations to three preceding generationsby reciting their namesas well as to the mythical lineage ancestor (gotra). A person thus gets to <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>names</b> of six generations (three preceding generation, his own and two succeeding generationshis sons and grandsons) in his life, reaffirming lineage ties. Anthropologist Usha Menon of Drexel University presents a similar ideathat Pitru Paksha emphasises the fact that the ancestors and the current generation and their next unborn generation are connected by blood ties. The current generation repays their debt to the ancestors in the Pitru Paksha. This debt is considered of utmost importance along with a person's debt to his gurus and his parents.|$|E
5|$|Cosmas Indicopleustes, a 6th-century Eastern Roman monk {{and former}} {{merchant}} {{who wrote the}} Christian Topography (describing the Indian Ocean trade leading {{all the way to}} China), visited the Aksumite port city of Adulis and included eyewitness accounts of it in his book. He copied a Greek inscription detailing the reign of an early 3rd-century polytheistic ruler of Aksum who sent a naval fleet across the Red Sea to conquer the Sabaeans in what is now Yemen, along with other parts of western Arabia. Ancient Sabaean texts from Yemen confirm that this was the Aksumite ruler Gadara, who made alliances with Sabaean kings, leading to eventual Axumite control over western Yemen that would last until the Himyarite ruler Shammar Yahri'sh (r. c. 265 – c. 287) expelled the Aksumites from southwestern Arabia. It is only from Sabaean and Himyarite inscriptions that we <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>names</b> of several Aksumite kings and princes after Gadara, including the monarchs `DBH and DTWNS. Inscriptions of king Ezana mention stone-carved thrones near the Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion in Axum (the platforms of which still exist), and Cosmas described a white-marble throne and stele in Adulis that were both covered in Greek inscriptions.|$|E

25|$|The {{dramatic}} {{performances were}} important to the Athenians – this is made clear by {{the creation of a}} tragedy competition and festival in the City Dionysia.

While no drama texts exist from the sixth century BC, we do <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>names</b> of three competitors besides Thespis: Choerilus, Pratinas, and Phrynichus. Each is credited with different innovations in the field.|$|E

25|$|Objects in {{precious}} {{materials such}} as ivory and metal had a very high status in the period, {{much more so than}} monumental sculpture — we <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>names</b> of more makers of these than painters, illuminators or architect-masons. Metalwork, including decoration in enamel, became very sophisticated, and many spectacular shrines made to hold relics have survived, of which the best known is the Shrine of the Three Kings at Cologne Cathedral by Nicholas of Verdun. The bronze Gloucester candlestick and the brass font of 1108–17 now in Liège are superb examples, very different in style, of metal casting, the former highly intricate and energetic, drawing on manuscript painting, while the font shows the Mosan style at its most classical and majestic. The bronze doors, a triumphal column and other fittings at Hildesheim Cathedral, the Gniezno Doors, and the doors of the Basilica di San Zeno in Verona are other substantial survivals. The aquamanile, a container for water to wash with, appears to have been introduced to Europe in the 11th century, and often took fantastic zoomorphic forms; surviving examples are mostly in brass. Many wax impressions from impressive seals survive on charters and documents, although Romanesque coins are generally not of great aesthetic interest.|$|E
500|$|The authorship of most Upanishads is {{uncertain}} and unknown. Radhakrishnan states, [...] "almost all the early literature of India was anonymous, {{we do not}} <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>names</b> {{of the authors of}} the Upanishads". The ancient Upanishads are embedded in the Vedas, the oldest of Hinduism's religious scriptures, which some traditionally consider to be apauruṣeya, which means [...] "not of a man, superhuman" [...] and [...] "impersonal, authorless". The Vedic texts assert that they were skillfully created by Rishis (sages), after inspired creativity, just as a carpenter builds a chariot.|$|E
500|$|Janáček {{was deeply}} {{influenced}} by folklore, and by Moravian folk music in particular, {{but not by}} the pervasive, idealized 19th century romantic folklore variant. He took a realistic, descriptive and analytic approach to the material. [...] Moravian folk songs, compared with their Bohemian counterparts, are much freer and more irregular in their metrical and rhythmic structure, and more varied in their melodic intervals. [...] In his study of Moravian modes, Janáček found that the peasant musicians did not <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>names</b> of the modes and had their own ways of referring to them. [...] He considered their Moravian modulation, as he called it, a general characteristic of this region's folk music.|$|E

500|$|The charioteer {{was usually}} either {{a family member}} of {{the owner of the}} chariot or, in most cases, a slave or a hired professional.

Yet, we <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>names</b> of very few charioteers, and victory songs and statues regularly contrive to leave them out of account. Unlike the other Olympic events, charioteers did not perform in the nude, probably for safety reasons because of the dust kicked up by the horses and chariots, and the likelihood of bloody crashes. Racers wore a sleeved garment called a xystis. It fell to the ankles and was fastened high at the waist with a plain belt. Two straps that crossed high at the upper back prevented the xystis from [...] "ballooning" [...] during the race.|$|E
