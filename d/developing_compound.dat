Here, we describe a mechanism that links them in a sequential fashion, in the <b>developing</b> <b>compound</b> eye of Drosophila. EGFR activation induces photoreceptor (R cell) differentiation and promotes their expression of Delta. This Notch ligand then induces neighboring cells to become nonneuronal cone cells. ebi and strawberry notch (sno) regulate EGFR-dependent Delta transcription by antagonizing a repressor function of Suppressor of Hairless (Su(H)). Sno binds to Su(H), and Ebi, an F-box/WD 40 protein, forms a complex with Su(H) and the corepressor SMRTER. EGFR-activated transcriptional derepression requires ebi and sno, is proteasome-dependent, and correlates with the translocation of SMRTER to the cytoplasm...|$|E

40|$|AbstractBy {{screening}} retinal cDNA libraries for photoreceptor-specifically expressed genes we have {{isolated and}} sequenced a cDNA clone encoding the rhodopsin (Rh 6) of {{a subset of}} R 8 photoreceptor cells of the Drosophila compound eye. Compared to the other visual pigments of Drosophila, this rhodopsin is equally homologous to Rh 1 and Rh 2 (51 % amino acid identity) but shows only 32 % and 33 % amino acid identity with Rh 3 and Rh 4, respectively. The open reading frame codes for a protein of 369 amino acids (MW= 41   691). The primary structure of Rh 6 displays sites typical for rhodopsin molecules in general, for example, a chromophore binding site in transmembrane domain VII, sequence motifs in the intracellular loops 2 and 3 required for the binding of a heterotrimeric G-protein, and a glycosylation site near the N-terminus {{which seems to be}} important for protein transport and maturation.

Ubiquitin, a 76 -amino-acid polypeptide, {{serves as a}} tag to direct proteins to the proteasome, a protein degradation complex.

Fat facets belongs to a class of deubiquitinating enzymes called Ubps that share a conserved catalytic domain. Fat facets is unique among them in its large size and also because Fat facets is thought to deubiquitinate a specific substrate thereby preventing its proteolysis. Here we asked which portions of the Fat facets protein are essential for its function. P-element constructs that express partial Fat facets proteins were tested for function. In addition, the DNA sequences of 12 mutant fat facets alleles were determined. Finally, regions of amino acid sequence similarity in 18 Drosophila Ubps revealed by the Genome Project were identified. The results indicate functions for specific conserved amino acids in the catalytic region of Fat facets and also indicate that regions of the protein both N- and C-terminal to the catalytic region are required for Fat facets function...|$|E

40|$|Gene {{regulation}} {{is fundamental to}} the execution of developmental programs, the generation of cellular and evolutionary diversity. Recent advances in regulatory genomics have provided insight into some aspects of transcriptional regulation, but the overall knowledge of the genomic cis-regulatory code and the emerging transcriptional networks, remains sparse. Here we aim to unravel transcriptional networks and to elucidate novel aspects of the syntax and semantics of cis-regulatory logic through an integrated computational and experimental approach. Using Drosophila eye development as a model system, and taking advantage of recent progress both in next-generation sequencing and in Drosophila genetics, we have performed 72 RNA-seq experiments for transcriptome perturbations including various wild type strains, transcription factor (TF) mutants, over-expression of TFs, knockdown of TFs, and specific cell types obtained by FACS cell sorting throughout the <b>developing</b> <b>compound</b> eye. Then we dissected the resulting data in silico to infer direct regulatory interactions between transcription factors and target enhancers and constructed a large network.

40|$|The Drosophila genome encodes 18 {{canonical}} nuclear receptors. All of the Drosophila nuclear receptors {{are here}} {{shown to be}} present in the genome of the honey bee (Apis mellifera). Given that the time since divergence of the Drosophila and Apis lineages is measured in hundreds of millions of years, the identification of matched orthologous nuclear receptors in the two genomes reveals the fundamental set of nuclear receptors required to ‘make ’ an endopterygote insect. The single novelty is the presence in the A. mellifera genome of a third insect gene similar to vertebrate photoreceptor-specific nuclear receptor (PNR).

40|$|Differences in knotted 1 -like (knox) gene {{expression}} {{may account for}} some of the diversity of leaf forms seen in nature. Class 1 knox genes are expressed in the compound leaf primordia of tomato but not in the simple leaf primordia of a range of species examined so far. In order to test the hypothesis that all compound leaves differ from simple leaves in this way, we isolated a class 1 knox cDNA from pea, Pskn 1 (Pisum sativum knotted 1) and examined its expression pattern. The encoded homeodomain of Pskn 1 shares 88 % identical residues with KNOTTED 1 from maize and an adjacent ELK domain is present. The protein sequence of PSKN 1 is 69 % identical to TKN 2, its nearest related sequence in tomato. Unlike TKn 2, Pskn 1 was not expressed in newly initiated compound leaves. The expression pattern of Pskn 1 resembled those of other class 1 knox genes described in maize and Arabidopsis. Transcripts were detected in the shoot apical meristem and developing vasculature of the vegetative shoot, but expression was not detected in newly initiated and <b>developing</b> <b>compound</b> leaf primordia. The same pattern of expression was observed in the afila mutant, which is characterised by highly ramified compound leaves.

40|$|During the larval stages, {{the visual}} {{system of the}} {{mosquito}} Aedes aegypti contains five stemmata, {{often referred to as}} larval ocelli, positioned laterally {{on each side of the}} larval head. Herewe show that stemmata contain two photoreceptor types, distinguished by the expression of different rhodopsins. The rhodopsin Aaop 3 (GPROP 3) is expressed in the majority of the larval photoreceptors. There are two small clusters of photoreceptors located within the satellite and central stemmata that express the rhodopsin Aaop 7 (GPROP 7) instead of Aaop 3. Electroretinogram analysis of transgenic Aaop 7 Drosophila indicates that Aaop 3 and Aaop 7, both classified as long-wavelength rhodopsins, possess similar but not identical spectral properties. Light triggers an extensive translocation of Aaop 3 from the photosensitive rhabdoms to the cytoplasmic compartment, whereas light-driven translocation of Aaop 7 is limited. The results suggest that these photoreceptor cell types play distinct roles in larval vision. An additional component of the larval visual system is the adult compound eye, which starts to develop at the anterior face of the larval stemmata during the 1 st instar stage. The photoreceptors of the <b>developing</b> <b>compound</b> eye show rhodopsin expression during the 4 th larval instar stage, consistent with indications from previous reports that the adult compound eye contributes to larval and pupal visual capabilities...|$|E
40|$|Across {{vascular}} plants, Class 1 KNOTTED 1 -like (KNOX 1) genes {{appear to}} {{play a critical role}} in the development of compound leaves. An exception to this trend is found in the Fabaceae, where pea (Pisum sativum) uses UNIFOLIATA, an ortholog of the floral regulators FLORICAULA (FLO) and LEAFY (LFY), in place of KNOX 1 genes to regulate compound leaf development. To assess the phylogenetic distribution of KNOX 1 -independent compound leaf development, a survey of KNOX 1 protein expression across the Fabaceae was undertaken. The majority of compound-leafed Fabaceae have expression of KNOX 1 proteins associated with <b>developing</b> <b>compound</b> leaves. However, in a large subclade of the Fabaceae, the inverted repeat–lacking clade (IRLC), of which pea is a member, KNOX 1 expression is not associated with compound leaves. These data suggest that the FLO/LFY gene may function in place of KNOX 1 genes in generating compound leaves throughout the IRLC. The contribution of FLO/LFY to leaf complexity in a member of the Fabaceae outside of the IRLC was examined by reducing expression of FLO/LFY orthologs in transgenic soybean (Glycine max). Transgenic plants with reduced FLO/LFY expression showed only slight reductions in leaflet number. Overexpression of a KNOX 1 gene in alfalfa (Medicago sativa), a member of the IRLC, resulted in an increase in leaflet number. This implies that KNOX 1 targets, which promote compound leaf development, are present in alfalfa and are still sensitive to KNOX 1 regulation. These data suggest that KNOX 1 genes and the FLO/LFY gene may have played partially overlapping roles in compound leaf development in ancestral Fabaceae but that the FLO/LFY gene took over this role in the IRLC...|$|E

The lead compound (compound 1) was identified with similar efficacy as that of NVP-BEZ 235 in a tumor xenograft model, but the exposure of compound 1 was much {{lower than that of}} NVP-BEZ 235. After reanalysis of the blood sample, a major metabolite (compound 2) was identified. Compound 2 exerted similar in vitro activity as compound 1, which indicated that compound 2 was an active metabolite and that the in vivo efficacy in the animal model came from compound 2 instead of compound 1. However, compound 1 was metabolized into compound 2 predominantly in the liver microsomes of mouse, but not in the liver microsomes of rat, dog, or human. In order to translate the efficacy in the animal model into clinical development or predict the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameters in the clinical study using a preclinical model, we developed the metabolite (compound 2) instead of compound 1. Due to the low bioavailability of compound 2, its prodrug (compound 3) was designed and synthesized to improve the solubility. The prodrug was quickly converted to compound 2 through both intravenous and oral administrations.

40|$|Co-planar grid {{detectors}} utilizing {{single carrier}} sensing techniques, offer {{a practical solution}} for <b>developing</b> <b>compound</b> semiconductor gamma-ray detectors with high resolving power [1]. We present a fully analytical model for describing the response of co-planar grid geometries. We discuss {{the results of an}} analysis of the spatial dependence of carrier collection. and show that the topology of electron drift trajectories is governed by the parameter α=(δV/V) (L/c), where δV/V is the relative variation of grid potential and L/c is an aspect ratio, with L being the detector thickness and c the cell width (i. e., the sum of the widths of the individual strips of both grids). This parameter describes the ratio of the characteristic electrostatic field in the near-field region of the individual strip and the mean field in the bulk. For α> 2, all electrons are collected by the high potential grid, whereas for α< 2 the electrons which were created beneath the central area of a lower potential strips are collected by the lower potential grid. Because of this, the co-planar grid detection techniques is shown to possess an intrinsic lateral inhomogeneity in its response, which is inherent to the design. Decreasing the dependence of the collected electron charge on the photon absorption depth (by cancelling the difference weighting potential outside the near field region), simultaneously brings about the dependence of the collected charge on the lateral coordinate. Thus, the inhomogenous component is due to both a lateral and bulk contributions. As a result, the resolution of a co-planar grid detector is dominated largely by the inhomogeneous broadening of the signal and not by Fano or electronic noise. We evaluate the inhomogeneous broadening due to depth dependence of the signal, which is as expected, of the same order of magnitude as for a small pixel detector. Lateral contributions are evaluated for full-area illumination, where they become important...|$|E
40|$|Background Organisms, {{tissues and}} cells are genetically {{programmed}} {{to grow to}} a specific largely pre-set size and shape within the appropriate developmental timing. In the event of mutation, cell death, or tissue damage, the remaining cells may increase their rate of growth to compensate and generate an intact, potentially smaller, tissue or organism {{in order to achieve}} the desired size. A delay in the developmental timing could aid in this process. The insulin receptor signalling pathway with its central component, the Akt 1 kinase, and endpoint regulator, the transcription factor foxo, plays {{a significant role in the}} control of growth. Drosophila melanogaster is an excellent model organism with a well-studied life cycle and a consistently <b>developing</b> <b>compound</b> eye that can undergo analysis to compare changes in the properties of adult ommatidia as an indicator of growth. Findings Imprecise excision of a PZ P-element inserted in the upstream region of Akt 1 generated several novel hypomorphic alleles with internally deleted regions of the Pelement. These mutations lead to small, viable Drosophila that present with delays in development. Suppression of this phenotype by the directed expression of Akt 1 + indicates that the phenotypes observed are Akt 1 dependent. Somatic clones of the eyes, consisting of homozygous tissue in otherwise heterozygous organisms that develop within a standard timeframe, signify that more severe phenotypes are masked by an extension in the time of development of homozygous mutants. Generation of Drosophila having the hypomorphic Akt 1 alleles and a null allele of the downstream target foxo result in a phenotype very similar to that of the foxo mutant and do not resemble the Akt 1 mutants. Conclusion The developmental delay of these novel Akt 1 hypomorphs results in a latent phenotype uncovered by generation of somatic clones. The compensatory growth occurring during the extended time of development appears to be implemented through alteration of foxo activity. Production of clones is an effective and informative way to observe the effects of mutations that result in small, viable, developmentally delayed flies...|$|E

40|$|Malaria is an {{infectious}} tropical disease responsible {{for hundreds of}} thousands of deaths every year. It is caused by a parasite from genus Plasmodium of which falciparum is the most deadly and the focus of this study. The limited number of currently available drugs are further threatened by the rising frequency of resistance. This has greatly emphasised the need for new drugs with novel modes of action. The current drug development pipelines rely on large scale compound library screens for antimalarial effect. Computational chemometric methods are then used for selecting promising hits for further investigation. Such analyses however rely on indirect characterisation of compound effects. In this project we investigated three approaches aimed at <b>developing</b> <b>compound</b> screening assays based on compound effects on live cells. The first two approaches relied on metabolomics techniques. Based on the assumption that the drug-induced metabolic changes in the malaria parasite could be uniquely assigned to the drug mode of action we hypothesised that if such metabolic states could be measured they could be used to cluster the compounds into groups based on their modes of action. By comparison to well-established antimalarials the clusters of novel compounds could then be characterised and novel compound clusters identified. The third method relied on the phenotypic information for drug exposed malaria parasites derived from the analysis of fluorescent microscopy images. This assay aimed at characterising the modes of action of the compounds as well as the speed of kill. The first method investigated was based on metabolic fingerprinting using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The sample preparation and data acquisition protocols were developed and tested. The results suggested that the sensitivity of the technique was insufficient for the detection of drug induced effects in P. falciparum. Next a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy-based method was developed. While the method was promising in terms of high throughput capabilities, consistency and the breadth of information posed a series of issues, mainly associated with sensitivity. In the absence of a suitable automated data processing solution a custom software “ProcNMR" was developed and used to process the data collected in the experiments. A full experimental procedure was developed and tested, however the NMR sensitivity issues, exacerbated by the complex intraerythrocytic nature of P. falciparum resulted in suboptimal outputs. Lastly a high content imaging-based technique was investigated. Data processing and predictive analysis methods were developed and implemented. A pilot experiment was used to demonstrate the potential of the technique to discriminate between fast and slow acting drugs.
