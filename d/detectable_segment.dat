40|$|Nine male beagle dogs, {{housed in}} either a {{conventional}} or locked environment for 2. 5 years, were killed, and the bacterial flora present in various regions of each gastrointestinal tract was assessed by culture techniques, light microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. All dogs possessed a complex microflora in their colons; in almost every dog anaerobes predominated. The highest number of bacteria cultured was 1010 /g (dry weight) of tissue and contents; highest counts obtained with a Petroff-Hauser counting chamber were 1010 /ml (wet weight). Although there was a consistency in the detectable genera, there were also noticeable differences in the flora of dogs housed under different environmental conditions. These differences included qualitative and quantitative changes in the flora as well as alterations in the distribution and localization of microorganisms along the gastrointestinal tract and in the crypts of Lieberkuhn. No bacterial layers were detected on the surfaces of stomach or proximal bowel {{in any of the}} dogs. Dogs housed in a conventional, open, environment had bacteria that occurred in layers on their ceca and colons and in their crypts of Lieberkuhn; however, dogs housed under “locked” environmental conditions did not possess them or had them less frequently. Dogs removed from the locked environment and kept (30 days) in conventional housing conditions were the only ones with <b>detectable</b> <b>segmented</b> filamentous microbes in their ilea. This study shows that the microbial flora does not simplify when dogs are housed in a locked environment. Indeed, it may increase in complexity and cause alterations in the bacterial flora that is associated closely with gastrointestinal epithelial cells and crypts of Lieberkuhn...|$|R

Polar transport was still <b>detectable</b> in <b>segments</b> treated with 1. 2 M sorbitol. The effects of osmotic {{stress on the}} polar transport of auxin were reversible, but treatment with sorbital solutions more concentrated than 0. 5 M reduced the subsequent ability of mesocotyl segments to grow in response to IAA.

The velocity of transport declined with higher concentrations of osmoticum. The reasons for the enhancement of auxin transport by osmotic stress are not known...|$|R
40|$|Three families, {{in which}} several male {{individuals}} {{suffer from a}} hereditary neuromuscular disease, were examined by analysis of naturally occurring restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) and by screening for deletions.

Since deletions were not <b>detectable,</b> an X-chromosomal <b>segment,</b> carrying DNA markers for the dystrophin gene and its flanking regions was reconstructed; this demonstrated Becker muscular dystrophy is the most probable primary cause of illness in these families.

40|$|The endothelium-derived {{relaxing}} factors {{nitric oxide}} (NO) and prostacyclin (PGI 2) are important antithrombotic, relaxant, and antiproliferative {{agents of the}} blood vessel wall that exert their intracellular effects primarily via cGMP- and cAMP-dependent protein kinases (cGK, cAK). However, no biochemical marker for their activity in the intact blood vessel is available except for transient increases in the concentration of cGMP and cAMP. Using Western blot analysis and specific antibodies, we show here that phosphorylation of the vasodilator-stimulated phos-phoprotein (VASP) at Ser 239 (PSer 239 -VASP) in rabbit aorta was <b>detectable</b> only in <b>segments</b> with an intact endothelium, al-though at least one third of VASP is contained in the remaining vascular wall.

40|$|Pretreatment of etiolated pea {{plants with}} red light and with red {{combined}} with far-red light produced morphologically similar plants having 4 -fold differences in spectrophotometrically <b>detectable</b> phytochrome. Stem <b>segments</b> from the variously pretreated plants respond {{in the same}} way to different percentage conversions of phytochrome to PFR. These results suggest that the PFR. /PR ratio, rather than the concentration of PFR, governs pea stem segment elongation. However, the ratio hypothesis does not explain contradictions between spectrophotometric and physiological assays previously obtained with this tissue, nor does it explain similar contradictions obtained in other systems. The only hypothesis consistent with the data to date is that of the existence of bulk and active phytochrome fractions, with the latter present in insufficient quantities to be spectrophotometrically detectable...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A novel ATP-dependent export pump for amphiphi-lie anionic conjugates, {{which has}} been cloned {{recently}} from liver, was identified in rat kidney and localized to the apical membrane domain of proximal tubule epithelia. This 190 -kD membrane glycoprotein (Mrp 2) has been described previously as the hepatocyte canalicular isoform of the multidrug resis-tance protein and as the canalicular multispecific organic anion transporter. Mrp 2 was identified in kidney by reverse transcrip-tion PCR followed by sequencing of the amplified 786 -bp fragment and by immunoblotting, using an antibody specifi-cally reacting with the carboxy terminus of rat Mrp 2. Double immunofluorescence and confocal laser-scanning microscopy showed the presence of Mrp 2 in the brush-border membrane domain of segments, S 2. and S 3 of proximal tubule epithelia. Mrp 2 was not <b>detectable</b> in other <b>segments</b> of the nephron. Th...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAmong a {{panel of}} 788 {{clinical}} influenza H 3 N 2 isolates, two isolates were characterized by an oseltamivir-resistant phenotype linked {{to the absence of}} any detectable NA activity. Here, we established that the two H 3 NA- isolates lack any <b>detectable</b> full-length NA <b>segment,</b> and one of these could be rescued by reverse genetics {{in the absence of any}} NA segment sequence. We found that the absence of NA segment induced a moderate growth defect of the H 3 NA- viruses as on cultured cells. The glycoproteins density at the surface of H 3 NA- virions was unchanged as compared to H 3 N 2 virions. The HA protein as well as residues 188 and 617 of the PB 1 protein were shown to be strong determinants of the ability of H 3 NA- viruses to grow in the absence of the NA segment. The significance of these findings about naturally occurring seven-segment influenza A viruses is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Most {{state-of-the-art}} text {{detection methods}} {{are specific to}} horizontal Latin text and are not fast enough for real-time applications. We introduce Segment Linking (SegLink), an oriented text detection method. The main idea is to decompose text into two locally <b>detectable</b> elements, namely <b>segments</b> and links. A segment is an oriented box covering {{a part of a}} word or text line; A link connects two adjacent segments, indicating that they belong to the same word or text line. Both elements are detected densely at multiple scales by an end-to-end trained, fully-convolutional neural network. Final detections are produced by combining segments connected by links. Compared with previous methods, SegLink improves along the dimensions of accuracy, speed, and ease of training. It achieves an f-measure of 75. 0 % on the standard ICDAR 2015 Incidental (Challenge 4) benchmark, outperforming the previous best by a large margin. It runs at over 20 FPS on 512 x 512 images. Moreover, without modification, SegLink is able to detect long lines of non-Latin text, such as Chinese. Comment: To Appear in CVPR 201...|$|R

We tested the hypothesis that nocturnal myocardial ischemia is <b>detectable</b> by ST <b>segment</b> depression and elevation of high sensitive troponin T (hsTrop T) and B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) in patients with OSA and coexisting coronary artery disease (CAD). Twenty-one patients with OSA and CAD and 20 patients with OSA alone underwent in-hospital polysomnography. Blood samples for hsTrop T and NT-proBNP measurements were drawn before and after sleep.

No significant ST depression was found at the time of oxygen saturation nadir in either group.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} why identifiable reassortants between subgroup 1 and subgroup 2 rotaviruses have been so rarely isolated from human specimens. Cultured cells were coinfected with pairs of subgroup 1 and 2 human rotaviruses and passaged multiple times to simulate natural reassortant formation and selection in vivo. After coinfection of MA- 104 cells with subgroup 1 (DS- 1) and subgroup 2 (either Wa or P) strains, approximately 14 ~ of the plaque-picked progeny were shown to be reassortants. During multiple passages of these coinfected cultures, however, complete (Wa virus coinfection) or nearly complete (P virus coinfection) loss of <b>detectable</b> DS- 1 <b>segments</b> from progeny was observed. Thus, when all segments of the subgroup 2 viruses were present in coinfected cultures, these segments dominated in the selected progeny. Coinfection with subgroup 1 -subgroup 2 rotavirus reassortants and the DS- 1 strain followed by multiple passages, however, resulted in complete loss of some segments from the subgroup 2 strains originally present in the reassortants. Therefore, segments from the parental subgroup 2 viruses appeared to be selected in toto during multiple passages because th y were dominant as a group, not because individual segments of these viruses were consistently favoured over their subgroup 1 virus counterparts...|$|R

40|$|Changes in {{the levels}} of cytosolic {{glutamine}} synthetase (GS 1) and chloroplastic glutamine synthetase (GS 2) polypeptides and of their corresponding mRNAs have been investigated in segments of the 13 th leaf of hydroponically grown rice (Oryza sativa L.) plants during natural senescence. The leaf blade on the main stem at early (0 day), middle (15 days), and late (25 days) stages of senescence was harvested and cut into 18 or 19 segments, 2 centimeters in length from the base to the tip. The amount of GS 1 polypeptide, detected with specific antibody for the GS 1, was greatest near {{the middle of the}} leaf blade (segments 11 - 13). There was little difference in the GS 1 content between corresponding leaf segments obtained at the early and middle stages of senescence. At the late senescence stage, all segments had lost some GS 1 polypeptide, but more than 50 % of GS 1 detected at both the early and middle stages was still <b>detectable</b> in <b>segments.</b> The relative content of mRNA for GS 1 in the total RNA in all segments was very low during early senescence but increased in all leaf segments during later senescence. At the late stage of senescence, GS 1 mRNA in the total RNA increased about 4. 2 - to 4. 6 -fold in segments 12 to 16 in the day- 25 samples compared with those in the early stage. The content of the GS 2 polypeptide, as well as ribulose- 1, 5 -bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) protein, was highest in segment 17 in the 0 -day samples. During senescence, this peak became lower and broader, and finally disappeared, i. e. approximately 80 % of GS 2 polypeptide and Rubisco protein in segment 17 were lost by day 25. In contrast with GS 2 polypeptide, the relative level of GS 2 mRNA increased 1. 8 - to 2. 9 -fold in individual segments at the middle stage of senescence. Even at the late stage, the transcript signals remained slightly higher than those at the early stage in all segments. Thus, GS 1 and GS 2 polypeptides and corresponding mRNAs responded in a different manner within an attached rice leaf during natural senescence. The contents of GS 1 and GS 2 polypeptides were not simply determined by the abundance of their corresponding mRNAs in the rice leaf blades during natural senescence...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Brain death induces {{myocardial}} dysfunction and multifocal microscopic myocardial necrosis in dogs; however, the pathogenetic pathways between brain death and cardiac damage remain incompletely understood. We hypothesized that brain death might induce a propensity toward coronary vasospasms, possibly by endothelial dysfunction. We therefore studied {{the effect of}} serotonin and acetylcholine on tension generated by isolated coronary artery segments from control and brain dead dogs. METHODS: Coronary segments were isolated 1 hour after brain death that was induced by the inflation (15 ml saline) of an extradurally placed balloon or from sham-operated time-matched controls. Studied were the effect of serotonin on isometric tension, with and without pre-constriction with prostaglandin F(2 alpha) (PGF(2 alpha)), {{and the effect of}} acetylcholine after pre-constriction. RESULTS: Coronary segments from brain dead dogs exhibited severe vasoconstriction when serotonin (10 (- 7), 10 (- 6), and 10 (- 5) mol/liter) was administered, a reaction that was barely <b>detectable</b> in control <b>segments.</b> After pre-construction with PGF(2 alpha), serotonin caused only significant vasodilation in a concentration of 10 (- 5) mol/liter, unlike in control segments where 10 (- 6) mol/liter had already induced a highly significant vasodilation. The reaction on acetylcholine was identical in both groups. CONCLUSION: Brain death induces changes in coronary vasoreactivity in dogs, with a highly increased sensitivity for the vasospastic effects of serotonin. It is, however, not merely caused by aspecific endothelial dysfunction, as evidenced by the normal reaction on acetylcholine. These alterations in coronary artery properties might contribute to the myocardial damage seen after brain death. status: publishe...|$|R
30|$|RSA-analyses: RSA-analyses were {{performed}} in our department at workstation using a validated [11] RSA-software program (WinRSA ver. 4.0, Tilly Medical Products, Sweden). The method {{for determining the}} position of the tibial implant in the global coordinate system arises from the kinematic model where the tantalum markers in the tibial implant and the proximal tibia bone define two rigid bodies (segments). The tantalum markers in the calibration knee cage define the global coordinate system. The proximal tibia bone acted as a reference segment for the tibial implant segment. The tantalum markers in both segments and the calibration knee cage were detected manually on the X-ray images in the two planes. It is of crucial importance that the corresponding marker is detected in the two planes and that a minimum of three corresponding markers are <b>detectable</b> in each <b>segment.</b> By mathematical transformation (interpolation of marker coordinates in the two planes) into the 3 D laboratory coordinate system the RSA-software calculated the 3 D position of the segments. Subsequently the migration of the tibial implant over time (according to follow-up schedule) was calculated with the postoperative examination as reference. Manual detection of markers is time consuming, and the mean time spent on one RSA examination and subsequent analysis of the RSA-image pair was 120  min. The unit for translations was millimeters (mm) and for rotations it was degrees (°). In our study the tibial implant was defined stable if the translation between two examinations were less than 0.2  mm. In RSA examinations and analyses several factors influence the reliability of the results [10, 11, 13]. Two important parameters that affect the results of RSA analysis are the condition number and rigid body error.|$|R
40|$|AbstractPurpose: Endothelin- 1 (ET- 1) {{has been}} implicated {{in a variety of}} {{vascular}} pathologic conditions, although there is considerable controversy as to whether such effects are mediated by the ET-A or ET-B receptor. This study investigated whether inhibition of big ET- 1 processing by inhibition of endothelin-converting enzyme (ECE) could, therefore, offer an alternative therapeutic strategy in the prevention of vein graft intimal hyperplasia. Methods: Human saphenous vein (3 equal segments from 10 patients) were maintained in organ culture for 14 days with either 50 μmol/L CGS 26303 (a dual ECE/neutral endopeptidase [NEP] inhibitor), 50 μmol/L CGS 24592 (a selective NEP inhibitor), or vehicle (control). They were then processed for immunostaining and neointimal thickness measurements, and conditioned media was collected for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analysis. Results: Neointimal thickness in the ECE/NEP-inhibited veins did not differ significantly from that of control segments. However, there was a highly significant augmentation in the NEP-inhibited segments, consistent with an inhibition of ET- 1 degradation (median difference, 16. 8; 95 % CI, – 23. 5, – 10. 4; P =. 002, Wilcoxon). ECE immunostaining was reduced in the ECE/NEP-inhibited veins, although ET- 1 staining was also present. ET- 1 expression was intense in the thickened neointimas of NEP-inhibited veins, which also showed significant ECE staining. Elevated levels of big ET- 1 were measured in the ECE/NEP-inhibited veins, consistent with reduced ECE activity. However, mature ET- 1 was still <b>detectable</b> in these <b>segments.</b> Conclusion: There is a requirement for potent and selective inhibitors of ECE to evaluate fully the potential therapeutic benefits of blocking ET- 1 biosynthesis. The use of dual inhibitors complicates the interpretation of results, because the observed response {{is likely to be a}} combination of both ECE and NEP inhibition.  (J Vasc Surg 2001; 34 : 548 - 54. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to test for the {{occurrence}} of changes in the organization, modification, or selective amplification of six developmentally regulated regions of genomic DNA during Drosophila development. Five of the regions contain structural genes, each of which maps at a single chromosomal site; the sixth region contains a dispersed segment that maps at about 30 different sites and appears to be transposable. The RNA transcripts and encoded proteins of the structural genes are major components of the fat body tissue in late third-instar larvae, in contrast to other larval tissues and young embryos in which the transcripts and proteins are hardly <b>detectable.</b> The dispersed <b>segment</b> shows the reverse developmental regulation: the amount of transcript is relatively high in young embryos and low in larval fat bodies. The test for changes in genomic DNA associated with the regulated expression of the six regions was based on comparative restriction mapping of the DNA from these sources. Genomic clones containing the transcribed and also flanking regions of DNA were used as probes to determine the positions of the complementary restriction fragments after electrophoresis in agarose gels. Each test, which involved digesting the genomic DNA samples with one of the endonucleases and probing with one of the clones, produced identical restriction maps for the different samples. The tests are capable of detecting changes in the organization of the cloned regions resulting from addition or removal either of endonuclease cleavage sites or of segments of DNA located between cleavage sites. Because the activities of several of the endonucleases, and probably all, are sensitive to methylation of one of the bases in the DNA recognition sequence, certain modifications of the cloned regions by methylation could also be detected. Although it is not certain that genomic reorganization or modification would have been detected by these tests, the number of endonucleases used was sufficient to provide persuasive evidence that such changes did not occur. Furthermore, the quantitative as well as qualitative similarities of the restriction maps in each test indicated that there was no significant selective amplification of the DNA within the cloned regions...|$|R
