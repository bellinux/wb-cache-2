A keen all-round sportsman he coached not only rugby but also hockey, was {{vice-president}} of the Sydney Swimming Club, and training senior military cadets for surf life-saving examinations. He also joined the Australian Militia, and by 1914 had reached the rank of captain and <b>had</b> <b>passed</b> <b>the</b> promotion exams for the rank of major.|$|E

The 12th Cavalry Brigade proceeded straight on to Jelame, while the 10th and 11th Cavalry Brigades crossed {{the edge of the}} Iskanderune marches at Shellalif. By 13:00 {{the division}} was approaching El Mugheir before crossing the Iskanderune River, where they rested before advancing to Liktera.|$|E

In March 2008, the program cost had risen and was projected to cost a total $11.2billion, or about $400million per helicopter.|$|E
5|$|Following the match, {{the referee}} {{admitted}} {{that at one}} point during the game the ball <b>had</b> <b>passed</b> <b>the</b> Blackburn goal line, but as Queen's Park did not attempt to claim the goal, it was not awarded.

5|$|In the 1941 {{legislative}} session, Johnson vetoed {{a measure}} allowing {{the sale of}} alcoholic beverages to surrounding states, even those with laws forbidding alcohol sales.

It <b>had</b> <b>passed</b> <b>the</b> Kentucky House of Representatives by a vote of 84–0 and the Kentucky Senate by a vote of 31–3. After Johnson's veto, the House reversed itself, voting 86–3 to sustain the veto.|$|E

5|$|It was {{confirmed}} on December 13, 2010 that Voyager 1 <b>had</b> <b>passed</b> <b>the</b> {{reach of the}} radial outward flow of the solar wind, {{as measured by the}} Low Energy Charged Particle device. It is suspected that solar wind at this distance turns sideways because of interstellar wind pushing against the heliosphere. Since June 2010, detection of solar wind had been consistently at zero, providing conclusive evidence of the event. On this date, the spacecraft was approximately 116 AU or 10.8billion miles (17.3billion kilometers) from the Sun.|$|E
5|$|The match saw Lindwall at his best. English skipper Yardley won the toss {{and elected}} to bat on a rain-affected pitch. Precipitation {{in the week}} {{leading up to the}} match meant that the Test could not start until midday <b>had</b> <b>passed.</b> <b>The</b> damp {{conditions}} meant that sawdust had to be added in large amounts to allow the players to keep their grip. The humid conditions, along with the rain, assisted the bowlers, with Lindwall in particular managing to make the ball bounce at variable heights.|$|E
5|$|Blamey was {{involved}} in discussions with the government over {{the size of the}} Army to be maintained. Now that the danger of invasion of Australia <b>had</b> <b>passed,</b> <b>the</b> government reconsidered how the nation's resources, particularly of manpower, should be distributed. Blamey pressed for a commitment to maintain three AIF divisions, as only they could legally be sent north of the equator where the final campaigns would be fought. He urged that the Empire Air Training Scheme be curtailed, and opposed MacArthur's proposal to use the Australian Army primarily for logistic support and leave combat roles principally to American troops.|$|E

5|$|By 10:00 {{the rest}} of the {{division}} <b>had</b> <b>passed</b> <b>the</b> Nahr el Falik. Although the division had been ordered to avoid conflict until they reached the entrenched line near Liktera, leading squadrons attacked 200 Ottoman infantry in a large orchard east of Basse el Hindi. Here they captured about 60 prisoners, two guns and many wagons at the cost of one man killed and two wounded. Another isolated machine gun was captured further north. Near Mukhalid, the 9th Hodson's Horse outflanked another Ottoman position, and another at Nahr Iskanderun at 10:15. A total of 110 prisoners, 2 artillery pieces and 12 wagons were captured.|$|E
5|$|By {{the first}} decade of the 20th century, a number of {{business}} entities had formed themselves into trusts, which dominated their industries. Trusts often sought to purchase or otherwise neutralize their competitors, allowing the conglomerates to raise prices to high levels. In 1890, Congress <b>had</b> <b>passed</b> <b>the</b> Sherman Anti-Trust Act, but it was not until the Theodore Roosevelt administration (1901–09) that serious efforts were made to break up or control the trusts. The dominant force in the oil industry was Standard Oil, controlled by John D. Rockefeller. Modern-day Exxon, Mobil, Atlantic Richfield, Chevron, Sohio, Amoco and Continental Oil all trace their ancestry to various parts of Standard Oil.|$|E
5|$|Hayward did {{his initial}} naval {{training}} at the Naval Station Newport at Newport, Rhode Island. He was encouraged by the Chaplain, Father John J. Brady, to try for admission to United States Naval Academy at Annapolis. Brady arranged for Hayward {{to be sent to}} the Naval Academy Preparatory School in Norfolk, Virginia, to study for the entrance exams. During World War I, some one-hundred presidential appointments to Annapolis had been set aside for enlisted sailors, but few had applied, and fewer still <b>had</b> <b>passed</b> <b>the</b> entrance exams. Of the 119 sailors who sat the exams in 1926, only 19 passed, one of whom was Hayward. He entered Annapolis in August 1926, and was commissioned as an ensign on graduation in June 1930, ranking 51st in his class of 406.|$|E

5|$|Over the {{following}} year, Japan also proceeded with its expansion plans. The Invasion of French Indochina on 22 September 1940 (which by then {{was controlled by}} the collaborating government of Vichy France), and Japan's ongoing bloody conflict with China, put a severe strain on American-Japanese relations. On 26 July 1940, the United States <b>had</b> <b>passed</b> <b>the</b> Export Control Act, cutting oil, iron and steel exports to Japan. This containment policy was Washington's warning to Japan that any further military expansion would result in further sanctions. However, such US moves were interpreted by Japan's militaristic leaders as signals {{that they needed to}} take radical measures to improve the Empire's situation, thereby driving Japan closer to Germany.|$|E
5|$|Simpson {{participated in}} the Battle of Passchendale where he was gassed and wounded. He was {{evacuated}} to England on 22 October 1917. While in hospital he applied for nine months' leave to return to Australia and complete his pharmaceutical studies. He <b>had</b> <b>passed</b> <b>the</b> Intermediate Examination before leaving Australia but not the Final Examination. This was granted, and he embarked for home on the transport HMAT Persic on 21 December 1917. He passed the Final Examination, and was registered as a pharmacist on 10 July 1918. He never returned to the front, and his AIF appointment was terminated on 9 August 1918.|$|E
5|$|The {{center field}} fence at Cleveland's Dunn Field was 460 feet from home plate {{until it was}} {{shortened}} to 420 feet in 1920. Even so, Speaker played so shallow in the outfield {{that he was able}} to execute six career unassisted double plays at second base, catching low line drives on the run and then beating baserunners to the bag. At least once he was credited as the pivot man in a routine double play. He was often shallow enough to catch pickoff throws at second base. At one point, Speaker's signature move was to come in behind second base on a bunt and make a tag play on a baserunner who <b>had</b> <b>passed</b> <b>the</b> bag.|$|E

5|$|The {{experiment}} resumed at 14:00. Weil {{worked the}} final control rod while Fermi carefully monitored the neutron activity. Fermi {{announced that the}} pile had gone critical (reached a self-sustaining reaction) at 15:25. Fermi switched the scale on the recorder to accommodate the rapidly increasing electrical current from the boron trifluoride detector. He wanted to test the control circuits, but after 28 minutes, the alarm bells went off to notify everyone that the neutron flux <b>had</b> <b>passed</b> <b>the</b> preset safety level, and he ordered Zinn to release the zip. The reaction rapidly halted. The pile had run for about 4.5 minutes at about 0.5 watts. Wigner opened a bottle of Chianti, which they drank from paper cups.|$|E
5|$|The {{refurbishment}} and recommissioning of the New Orleans Mint was due {{partly to}} the fact that in 1878 the Federal government in Washington, D.C. <b>had</b> <b>passed</b> <b>the</b> Bland–Allison Act, which mandated the purchase and coining of a large quantity of silver yearly. The Treasury Department needed additional facilities to do so. It reopened the New Orleans facility primarily to coin large quantities of silver dollars, most of which were simply stored in the building instead of circulated. President Rutherford B. Hayes appointed former Mississippi Senator and governor Henry S. Foote the new superintendent of the mint.|$|E
5|$|The tunnel {{construction}} became unintentionally {{involved in}} the women's rights movement when Janet Bonnema was accepted for an engineering technician position {{in the construction of}} the Straight Creek Tunnel in 1970. Bonnema was restricted from entering the tunnel itself, however, due to the miners' superstition that women who entered underground mines and tunnels would bring bad luck. In 1972 Bonnema filed a $100,000 class action suit against the Colorado Department of Transportation, citing Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. As Colorado voters <b>had</b> <b>passed</b> <b>the</b> Equal Rights Amendment that year, the state settled Bonnema's case out of court for $6,730. Bonnema entered the tunnel for the first time on November 9, 1972, prompting 66 workers to temporarily walk off the job; most returned the next day. She continued with the project until the tunnel opened.|$|E
