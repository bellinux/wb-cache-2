40|$|Long slender {{structures}} such as textile yarns {{and ocean}} cables show localised buckling behaviour under torsional loading. In a 1 D elastic theory these localised solutions are described by homoclinic orbits in a dynamical system in which arclength along the structure is the independent variable. Upon continued loading after localisation a snap into self-contact and looping may occur. We discuss the intricate bifurcation behaviour that unfolds after the initial jump and also consider the problem of loop pop-out. We also briefly consider {{the mechanics of the}} plied structure that forms and show that the problem is governed by the equations for an elastic rod constrained to lie on a cylinder.

40|$|<b>Staple</b> <b>fibre</b> <b>yarns</b> vary quite {{markedly}} in {{linear density}} (tex) along their length {{and the degree}} to which twist redistributes from thick to thin places will affect the strength, torque and extension behaviour of the yarn. Theory suggests that twist along worsted yarns should vary as 1 /(tex) 2 if fibres were locked in the structure, whereas themean torque of worsted yarns reported in the literature implies that twist should be proportional to 1 /tex. This article examines twist distribution in ring-spun marl yarns, down to 5 mm resolution, as a function of linear density measured using a high-resolution capacitive sensor. It is found for moderate twist-level worsted yarns that twist is approximately proportional to 1 /(tex) 1. 6. The results and theory provide a guide as to the effect the observed large variations in linear density will have on yarn properties such as tenacity and torque. <br /...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} fibre volume {{fraction}} {{on the physical}} and tensile properties of aligned plant fibre composites (PFCs) produced via vacuum infusion has been investigated. There is no clear correlation between fibre volume fraction and porosity. However, low fibre content PFCs are prone to intra-yarn voids, while high fibre content PFCs are prone to inter-yarn voids. This is due to changing resin flow dynamics with increasing fibre content. The tensile behaviour of PFCs with increasing fibre content {{is similar to that}} of conventional fibre reinforced plastics (FRPs). Interestingly, the non-linear stress–strain response of plant fibres has been transferred to the composites. Fibre content and tensile properties are found to be linearly related, as per the rule of mixtures. A void content of up to 4 % is found to have minimal effect on the tensile properties of PFCs. The minimum and critical (vf,crit) fibre volume fractions for aligned flax and jute–polyester composites are found to be substantially higher than conventional aligned FRPs; vf,crit for jute–polyester and carbon–polyester is 8. 1 % and 2. 4 %, respectively. A simple model has also been developed to approximate the theoretical maximum obtainable fibre volume fraction of PFCs reinforced with <b>staple</b> <b>fibre</b> <b>yarns.</b> The absolute theoretical maximum fibre content is found to be 58. 9 %, which agrees with experimental values in literature. A high vf,crit (∼ 10 %) and low vf,max (∼ 45 %) implies that the range of useful fibre volume fractions for PFCs containing <b>staple</b> <b>fibre</b> twisted <b>yarns</b> is only 35 %...|$|R
40|$|The ring {{spinning}} {{process has been}} used to produce fine and high quality <b>staple</b> <b>fibre</b> <b>yarns.</b> The stability of the rotating yarn loop (i. e. balloon) between the yarn-guide and the traveller-ring is crucial to the success and economics of this process. Balloon control rings are used to contain the yarn-loop, by reducing the yarn tension and decreasing the balloon flutter instability. Flutter instability here refers to the uncontrolled changes in a ballooning yarn under dynamic forces, including the air drag. Due to the significant variation in the length and radius of the balloon during the bobbin filling process, the optimal location for the balloon control ring is not easily determined. In order to address this difficulty, this study investigates the variation in the radius of a free balloon and examines the effect of balloon control rings of various diameters at different locations on yarn tension and balloon flutter stability. The results indicate that the maximum radius of a free balloon and its corresponding position depend not only on the yarn-length to balloon-height ratio, but also on yarn type and count. A control ring of suitable radius and position can significantly reduce yarn tension and decrease flutter instability of free single-loop balloons. While the balloon control rings are usually fixed to, and move in sinc with, the ring frame, results reported in this study suggest that theoretically, a balloon control ring that always remains approximately half way between the yarn-guide and the ring rail du{{ring spinning}} can lead to significant reduction in yarn tension. <br /...|$|R
40|$|Coir is a ligno-cellulosic fibre, {{cheap and}} abundantly {{available}} in Sri Lanka as {{a byproduct of}} the coconut industry. Coir-geotextiles, which are manufactured from coir, {{have been identified as}} good geotextile material to be used for soil reinforcement in soil erosion problems until sustainable vegetation is established. Because of this reason coir based geotextiles have the potential to be an exportable product. It has become necessary to scientifically study the properties of coir fibres and coir-geotextiles in great detail to meet the suitability requirements of the export market as well as the local market. Mechanical and physical properties including tensile properties, initial modulus, length, mass and diameter of brown and white coir fibre obtained from Kurunegala District have been used in the evaluation. Moisture absorption characteristics of coir fibres were also evaluated. Results show that there is a direct relationship between the length and tenacity as well as extension at break of retted brown coir fibre. This relationship is not significant in unretted white coir fibre, which is a longer fibre with a higher in tenacity and extension at break. Wet tensile strength and wet extension at break of coir fibres were found to be greater than the tensile strength in the conditioned state. In seawater immersion, coir fibres did not lose strength after 24 hours at room temperature. During a 24 hours period coir fibres did not lose strength significantly in the pH 5 - 9 range at ambient temperature. At different NaOH concentrations and different time periods at 25 °C, coir fibres were immersed in alkaline medium to find out whether the strength was affected. After 30 min in 10 % NaOH brown coir showed highest strength but white coir fibre showed highest strength in 25 % NaOH concentration after 30 min immersion. It was attempted to apply the idealized <b>staple</b> <b>fibre</b> <b>yarn</b> model to coir yarns. For this purpose coir-yarn initial modulus was calculated using results of strength tests for coir <b>fibres</b> and coir <b>yarns.</b> Calculated initial modulus is greater than experimentally obtain results but deviate considerably from the actual situvation. The durability of coir fibres was investigated by immersing in distilled water, acid medium, alkaline medium and saline solution at ambient temperature {{over a period of time}} and the results showed that brown coir fibre and white coir fibre had similar losses in strength in acidic medium after 3 months. White coir fibre lost strength significantly after 3 months in distilled water (pH= 5. 89) treatment. But both coir fibres do not lose strength significantly during 3 months time in alkaline medium or saline water. Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) analysis of selected treated coir fibres was carried out to investigate the effect on surface structure of fibres. This analysis explained the results of tensile strength tests between brown and white coir fibres and untreated and treated conditions...|$|R

The most widely used blends are cotton-polyester and wool-acrylic fibre blends. Blends of different natural fibres are common too, especially with more expensive fibres such as alpaca, angora and cashmere.|$|R

40|$|The {{influence}} of <b>fibre,</b> <b>yarn,</b> and fabric properties on the bagging behaviour of woven fabrics is studied by developing rheological models and comparing {{them with the}} results of statistical analysis on experimental measurements. Three rheological models are developed to describe the bagging-deformation features at different stages of bagging processes, from which three types of deformation energy are identified: elastic and viscoelastic energies of the fibres, and the frictional-deformation energy resulting from the frictional slippage between <b>fibres</b> and <b>yarns.</b> To evaluate the theoretical analysis, 24 fabrics were tested to determine their bagging behaviour, the mechanical properties of constituent <b>fibres</b> and <b>yarns,</b> and fabric structural features. Statistical regression analysis is applied to derive the parameters describing bagging fatigue and their relationships with the <b>fibre</b> and <b>yarn</b> mechanical properties and fabric structural features. A comparison of the experimental results with the theoretical analysis indicates that a decrease in the work of loading with repeated bagging deformation resulted from two basic causes: the stress relaxation of the fibres due to the fibres' viscoelastic behaviour and the friction between <b>fibres</b> and between <b>yarns</b> due to frictional restraints inherent in the fabric structures. The three parameters (Q o, U σ) describing the fabric-fatigue process are shown to be dependent on <b>fibre</b> and <b>yarn</b> mechanical properties and fabric structural parameters, such as fabric thickness, weight, cover factor, and interlacing points. Using the regression equations for the three parameters (Q o, U σ), we show that the bagging-fatigue behaviour and fabric-residual-bagging height are predictable from the fundamental <b>fibre</b> and <b>yarn</b> mechanical properties and fabric structural parameters, indicating that a subjective perception of fabric-bagging is also predictable from the parameters.
