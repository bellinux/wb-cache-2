50|$|The term {{dot matrix}} printer is used for <b>impact</b> <b>printers</b> that use a matrix of small pins to {{transfer}} ink to the page. The advantage of dot matrix over other <b>impact</b> <b>printers</b> {{is that they can}} produce graphical images in addition to text; however the text is generally of poorer quality than <b>impact</b> <b>printers</b> that use letterforms (type).|$|R
50|$|Like {{all other}} <b>impact</b> <b>{{printers}},</b> daisy wheel printers are noisy.|$|R

50|$|IBM 5219 - A {{daisywheel}} <b>impact</b> <b>printer</b> not {{far removed}} from the IBM typewriters. It was good for about 40 characters per second (CPS).|$|E
50|$|Compared to {{the older}} 9-pin models, a new 24-pin <b>impact</b> <b>printer</b> not only {{produced}} better-looking NLQ text, it printed the page more quickly (largely due to the 24-pin's ability to print NLQ with a single pass). 24-pin printers repeated this feat in bitmap graphics mode, producing higher-quality graphics in reduced time. While the text-quality of a 24-pin was still visibly inferior to a true letter-quality printer - the daisy wheel or laser-printer, the typical 24-pin <b>impact</b> <b>printer</b> printed more quickly than most daisy-wheel models.|$|E
50|$|A {{letter-quality printer}} {{was a form}} of {{computer}} <b>impact</b> <b>printer</b> that was able to print with the quality typically expected from a business typewriter such as an IBM Selectric.|$|E
50|$|During {{the declining}} {{years of the}} mimeograph, some people made stencils with early {{computers}} and dot-matrix <b>impact</b> <b>printers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Most of {{the modern}} {{acoustic}} cryptanalysis focuses on the sounds produced by computer keyboards and internal computer components, but historically {{it has also been}} applied to <b>impact</b> <b>printers,</b> and electromechanical deciphering machines.|$|R
5000|$|... {{dot matrix}} impact {{technology}} remains {{in use in}} devices such as cash registers, ATMs, fire alarm systems, and many point-of-sales terminals. Thermal printing is gradually supplanting them {{in some of these}} applications, but full-size dot-matrix <b>impact</b> <b>printers</b> are still used to print multi-part stationery. For example, dot matrix <b>impact</b> <b>printers</b> are still used at bank tellers and auto repair shops, and other applications where use of tractor feed paper is desirable such as data logging and aviation. Some of these printers are even fitted with USB interfaces as standard to aid connection to modern computers without legacy ports.|$|R
50|$|A braille {{embosser}} is an <b>impact</b> <b>printer</b> that renders text as tactile braille cells. Using braille translation software, {{a document}} can be embossed with relative ease, making braille production efficient and cost-effective.|$|E
50|$|The Centronics Model 101 was {{introduced}} at the 1970 National Computer Conference. The print head used an innovative seven-wire solenoid impact system. Based on this design, Centronics later made the (incorrect) {{claim to have}} developed the first dot matrix <b>impact</b> <b>printer</b> (while the first such printer was the OKI Wiredot in 1968).|$|E
5000|$|As an <b>impact</b> <b>printer,</b> {{the term}} mainly refers to low-resolution impact printers, with {{a column of}} 8, 9 or 24 [...] "pins" [...] hitting an ink-impregnated fabric ribbon, like a {{typewriter}} ribbon, onto the paper. It was originally contrasted with both daisy wheel printers and line printers that used fixed-shape embossed metal or plastic stamps to mark paper.|$|E
50|$|Energy consumption, noise, etc. Some page {{printers}} are {{too noisy}} {{to stay in}} the near vicinity of the users, even if page printers are quieter than the old line <b>printers</b> and other <b>impact</b> <b>printers.</b>|$|R
50|$|In the 1970s and 1980s, {{dot matrix}} <b>impact</b> <b>printers</b> were {{generally}} {{considered the best}} combination of expense and versatility, and until the 1990s they were {{by far the most}} common form of printer used with personal and home computers.|$|R
50|$|Many <b>impact</b> <b>printers,</b> {{such as the}} {{daisywheel}} printer and dot matrix printer, used a print head that printed a character then moved on until an entire line was printed. Line printers were much faster, as each impact printed an entire line.|$|R
50|$|An {{aspect of}} hack value is {{performing}} feats {{for the sake}} of showing that they can be done, even if others think it is difficult. Using things in a unique way outside their intended purpose is often perceived as having hack value. Examples are using a dot matrix <b>impact</b> <b>printer</b> to produce musical notes, using a flatbed scanner to take ultra-high-resolution photographs or using an optical mouse as barcode reader.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{method of}} amplifying the piezo stroke {{is to use}} a lever arm, which can be a primary or a {{secondary}} amplification mechanism, and can be used to generate displacements with more than 10 times magnification, like 40 times. The lever arm amplification method were used as amplified piezoelectric actuator in 1980s as a piezoelectric <b>impact</b> <b>printer</b> element by T.Yano et al. from EM Precicison Technologies Ltd.(later renamed Mechano Transformer Corporation).|$|E
50|$|Early 1980s impact {{printers}} used {{a simple}} form of internal raster image processing, using low-resolution built-in bitmap fonts to render raw character data sent from the computer, and only capable of storing enough dot matrix data for one printed line {{at a time}}. External raster image processing was possible such as to print a graphical image, but was commonly extremely slow and data was sent one line {{at a time to}} the <b>impact</b> <b>printer.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Letter-quality <b>impact</b> <b>printers,</b> however, were slow, noisy, {{incapable}} of printing graphics or images (unless the programmable microspacing and over-use of the dot were employed), sometimes limited to monochrome, and {{limited to a}} fixed set (usually one) of typefaces without operator intervention, though certain font effects like underlining and boldface could be achieved by overstriking. Soon, dot-matrix printers (such as the Oki Microline 84) would offer [...] "Near Letter Quality" [...] (NLQ) modes which were much faster than daisy-wheel printers, could produce graphics well, but were still very noticeably lower than [...] "letter quality". Nowadays, printers using non-impact printing (for example laser printers, inkjet printers, and other similar means) have replaced traditional letter-quality printers in most applications. The quality of inkjet printers can approach the old letter-quality <b>impact</b> <b>printers</b> (but can be limited by factors such as paper type).|$|R
50|$|Character matrix {{printers}} are {{a category}} of computer <b>printers</b> (typically <b>impact</b> <b>printers)</b> that place characters from a fixed character set anywhere onto a fixed grid of possible locations on the page. Examples of these are daisy wheel printers, golf ball printers, teleprinters, chain printers, and band printers. A character printer prints one character at a time.|$|R
50|$|However, {{almost all}} modern {{computer}} printers also create their output as matrices of dots, but {{use a different}} technology like laser printing or inkjet printing, and are not called dot matrix <b>printers.</b> <b>Impact</b> <b>printers</b> survive where multi-part forms are needed, as the pins can impress dots through multiple layers of paper to make a carbonless copy, for security purposes.|$|R
50|$|Continuous form {{paper of}} all types remains in production, {{although}} largely supplanted {{with the introduction of}} fast laser printers with single-sheet feed. Continuous stationery printed on a suitable printer is typically cheaper than laser printing although the output is of lower quality. If an <b>impact</b> <b>printer</b> is used multiple simultaneous copies can be printed on multipart forms. Many laser printers can print {{on both sides of the}} paper (duplex printing), not possible with continuous stationery.|$|E
5000|$|Kaypro 2X - The Kaypro 2X {{was similar}} to the Kaypro 4, but it lacked the {{built-in}} 300 baud modem that was available in the Kaypro 4. Kaypro 2X's were often sold in a bundle with the Wordstar word processing software suite, spreadsheet and database software. The <b>impact</b> <b>printer</b> that was also included in the bundle was labeled as the [...] "Kaypro Printer," [...] but was actually a re-branded Juki 6100 daisywheel printer.|$|E
50|$|The desktop <b>impact</b> <b>printer</b> was {{gradually}} {{replaced by the}} inkjet printer. When Hewlett-Packard's patents expired on steam-propelled photolithographically produced ink-jet heads, the inkjet mechanism became available to the printer industry. For applications that did not require impact (e.g. carbon-copy printing), the inkjet was superior in nearly all respects: comparatively quiet operation, faster print speed, and output quality {{almost as good as}} a laser printer. By the mid-1990s, inkjet technology had surpassed dot-matrix in the mainstream market.|$|E
5000|$|In June 1978, the Epson TX-80/TP-80, an 8-pin {{dot-matrix printer}} mainly {{used for the}} Commodore PET computer, was released. This and its successor, the 9-pin Epson MX-80/MP-80 (introduced in 1979/1980), were the {{groundbreaking}} models that sparked the initial popularity of <b>impact</b> <b>printers</b> in the personal computer market. The MX-80 combined affordability with good-quality text output (for its time). Early <b>impact</b> <b>printers</b> (including the MX) were notoriously loud during operation, {{a result of the}} hammer-like mechanism in the print head. The MX-80 even inspired the name of a noise rock band. The MX-80's low dot density (60 dpi horizontal, 72 dpi vertical) produced printouts of a distinctive [...] "computerized" [...] quality. When compared to the crisp typewriter quality of a daisy-wheel printer, the dot-matrix printer's legibility appeared especially bad. In office applications, output quality was a serious issue, as the dot-matrix text's readability would rapidly degrade with each photocopy generation. IBM sold the MX-80 as IBM 5152.|$|R
50|$|PCL 3 was {{introduced}} in 1984 with the original HP LaserJet. This added support for bitmap fonts and increased the maximum resolution to 300 dpi. Other products with PCL 3 support were the HP DeskJet ink jet printer, HP 2932 series matrix printers and HP RuggedWriter 2235 matrix printers. PCL 3 is still in use on several <b>impact</b> <b>printers</b> which replaced the obsolete HP models.|$|R
50|$|Line matrix {{printers}} {{can print}} text, bar codes and graphics. Line matrix printers were originally popularized by the mini-computer craze and continued its growth as {{a bar code}} printer. Today they are sold in virtually {{every corner of the}} world and while they print as rapidly as line printers, they can print bar codes and other graphics as well. When implemented as <b>impact</b> <b>printers,</b> they can be the least expensive to operate per page.|$|R
50|$|A {{sheet of}} carbon paper is placed between {{two or more}} sheets of paper. The {{pressure}} applied by the writing implement (pen, pencil, typewriter or <b>impact</b> <b>printer)</b> to the top sheet causes pigment from the carbon paper to make a similar mark on the copy sheet(s). More than one copy {{can be made by}} stacking several sheets with carbon paper between each pair. Four or five copies is a practical limit. The top sheet is the original and each of the additional sheets is called a carbon copy.|$|E
50|$|As the {{technology}} matured, most large printer installations were drum printers, {{a type of}} <b>impact</b> <b>printer</b> which could print an entire line of text at once {{through the use of}} a high speed rotary printing drum. It was thought that in the event of a severe jam, the friction of paper against the drum could ignite either the paper itself, or, in a dirty machine, the accumulated paper and ink dust in the mechanism. Whether this ever happened is not known; there are no reports of friction-related printer fires.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{mechanisms}} {{have been}} adopted for marking paper. In the telegraphic siphon recorder of 1858 a fine capillary tube is connected to an ink reservoir and is deflected by the process signal. In modern strip chart recorders, a disposable cartridge combining both a fiber-tipped pen and ink reservoir has been used. Other types of recorder use a heated stylus and thermally sensitive paper, an <b>impact</b> <b>printer</b> using a ribbon and an electrically operated hammer, an electric signal acting through a stylus onto electro-sensitive paper, or an electric spark that makes a visible spot on aluminized paper. One form of sensitive and high-speed recorder used beams of ultraviolet light reflected off mirror galvanometers, directed at light-sensitive paper.|$|E
50|$|The first LaserJet was a {{high-speed}} replacement for text-only daisy wheel <b>impact</b> <b>printers</b> and dot matrix printers. By using control codes {{it was possible}} to change the printed text style using font patterns stored in permanent ROM in the printer. Although unsupported by HP, because the Laserjet used the same basic PCL language (PCL Level III) spoken by HP's other printers {{it was possible to}} use the Laserjet on HP 3000 multiuser systems.|$|R
5000|$|Often {{considered}} the [...] "backbone" [...] of many industrial and back-office systems, {{there are several}} types of line matrix printers used today across diverse enterprise production environments including: manufacturing, supply chain, distribution & logistics, transportation, finance and banking. Dot matrix printers, also known also as <b>impact</b> <b>printers,</b> represent the oldest printing technology, are still widely used today, due to its lowest 'cost per page' ratio. Dot matrix printers are divided on two main groups: serial dot matrix printers and line matrix [...] printers.|$|R
5000|$|In 1985, Commodore adopted ECMA-94 {{for its new}} AmigaOS {{operating}} system. The Seikosha MP-1300AI <b>impact</b> dot-matrix <b>printer,</b> {{used with}} the Amiga 1000, included this encoding.|$|R
