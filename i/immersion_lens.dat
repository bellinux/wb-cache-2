5|$|In 1848, German anatomist Johann Heinrich Meckel {{recorded}} black-brown pigment granules in {{the blood}} and spleen of a patient {{who had died in}} a mental hospital. Meckel was thought to have been looking at malaria parasites without realizing it; he did not mention malaria in his report. He hypothesized that the pigment was melanin. The causal relationship of pigment to the parasite was established in 1880, when French physician Charles Louis Alphonse Laveran, working in the military hospital of Constantine, Algeria, observed pigmented parasites inside the red blood cells of malaria sufferers. He witnessed the events of exflagellation and became convinced that the moving flagella were parasitic microorganisms. He noted that quinine removed the parasites from the blood. Laveran called this microscopic organism Oscillaria malariae and proposed that malaria was caused by this protozoan. This discovery remained controversial until the development of the oil <b>immersion</b> <b>lens</b> in 1884 and of superior staining methods in 1890–1891.|$|E

40|$|We have {{demonstrated}} a simple method for characterization of objective lens performance at longer wavelengths for 3 PLSM and THG imaging. We investigated {{a range of}} air and oil-immersion objective lenses across a wavelength range of 1, 400 - 1, 650 nm using a synchronously pumped optical parametric oscillator laser source. In the first instance, we investigated the percentage light transmission across this spectral range. Second, we used a simple second harmonic autocorrelation pulse measurement technique to study the dispersion properties of these lenses at the range of input wavelengths. For the objective lenses investigated, we observed pulse broadening {{on the order of}} around 4 %- 7 % for air <b>immersion</b> <b>lenses</b> and 9 %- 12 % for oil <b>immersion</b> <b>lenses.</b> Even for the greater dispersion incurred by the application of the oil <b>immersion</b> <b>lenses,</b> these objectives are suitable for longer wavelength application in conjunction with a suitable light source. The same techniques could easily be applied for a larger range of objective lenses and adapted for alternative spectral windows and pulse durations. Microsc. Res.

40|$|The {{femtosecond}} laser-induced multi-photon polymerization of a zirconium–silicon based sol–gel photopolymer {{was employed}} for the fabrication {{of a series}} of micro-optical elements with single and combined optical functions: convex and Fresnel <b>lenses,</b> gratings, solid <b>immersion</b> <b>lenses</b> on a glass slide and on the tip of an optical fiber. The microlenses were produced as polymer caps of varying radii from 10 to 90 µm. The matching of refractive indices between the polymer and substrate was exploited for the creation of composite glass-resist structures which functioned as single lenses. Using this principle, solid <b>immersion</b> <b>lenses</b> were fabricated and their performance demonstrated. The magnification of the composite solid <b>immersion</b> <b>lenses</b> corresponded to the calculated values. The surface roughness of the lenses was below ~ 30 nm, acceptable for optical applications in the visible range. In addition, the integration of micro-optical elements onto the tip of an optical fiber was demonstrated. To increase the efficiency of the 3 D laser polymerization, the lenses were formed by scanning only the outer shell and polymerizing the interior by exposure to UV light...|$|R

40|$|We {{show here}} a {{technique}} of soft lithography to microfabricate efficient solid <b>immersion</b> <b>lenses</b> (SIL) out of rubber elastomers. The light collection efficiency of a lens system {{is described by}} its numerical aperture (NA), and is critical for applications as epifluorescence microscopy [B. Herman, Fluorescence Microscopy (BIOS Scientific, Oxford/Springer, United Kingdom, 1998). While most simple lens systems have numerical apertures less than 1, the lenses described here have NA= 1. 25. Better performance can be engineered though the use of compound designs; we used this principle to make compound solid <b>immersion</b> <b>lenses</b> (NA= 1. 32). An important application of these lenses will be as integrated optics for microfluidic devices. We incorporated them into a handheld rubber microscope for microfluidic flow cytometry and imaged single E. Coli cells by fluorescence...|$|R
40|$|Adapting {{the concept}} of solid <b>immersion</b> <b>lenses,</b> we numerically study a micro-optical scheme for {{conventional}} high-index and photonic-crystal waveguide coupling by {{using a combination of}} different numerical methods such as ray tracing, angular-spectrum propagation, finite-difference time-domain simulations, and finite-element-method simulations. The numerical findings are discussed by means of impedance, group- or energy-velocity, spot-size, and phase-matching criteria. When fabrication constraints for high-index <b>immersion</b> <b>lenses</b> made of silicon are taken into account, a coupling efficiency of about 80 % can be reached for monomode silicon-on-insulator waveguides with a quadratic cross section of the core and rectangular cross sections of moderate aspect ratio. Similar coupling efficiencies of ? 80 % can be obtained for silicon-on-insulator photonic-crystal waveguides. Tolerances that are due to misalignments and variations of the substrate thickness of the silicon lens are discussed...|$|R
50|$|Because {{the system}} must address {{different}} depths in the medium, and at different depths the spherical aberration induced in the wavefront is different, a method {{is required to}} dynamically account for these differences. Many possible methods exist that include optical elements that swap {{in and out of}} the optical path, moving elements, adaptive optics, and <b>immersion</b> <b>lenses.</b>|$|R
50|$|Low-energy {{electron}} microscopy (LEEM) and mirror {{electron microscopy}} (MEM):These two electron emission microscopy use electron gun supply beams which are {{directed toward the}} specimen, decelerated and backscattered from the specimen or reflected just before reaching the specimen.

40|$|High-resolution light {{microscopy}} of glycerol-mounted biological specimens is performed almost exclusively with oil <b>immersion</b> <b>lenses.</b> The {{reason is that}} the index of refraction of the oil and the cover slip of similar to 1. 51 is close to that of similar to 1. 45 of the glycerol mountant, so that refractive index mismatch-induced spherical aberrations are tolerable to some extent. Here we report the application of novel cover glass-corrected glycerol <b>immersion</b> <b>lenses</b> of high numerical aperture (NA) and the avoidance of these aberrations. The new lenses feature a semi-aperture angle of 68. 5 degrees, which is slightly larger than that of the diffraction-limited 1. 4 NA oil <b>immersion</b> <b>lenses.</b> The glycerol lenses are corrected for a quartz cover glass of 220 mum thickness and for a 80 % glycerol- water immersion solution. Featuring an aberration correction collar, the lens can adapt to glycerol concentrations ranging between 72 % and 88 %, to slight variations of the temperature, and to the cover glass thickness. As the refractive index mismatch-induced aberrations are particularly important to quantitative confocal fluorescence microscopy, we investigated the axial sectioning ability and the axial chromatic aberrations in such a microscope as well as the image brightness {{as a function of the}} penetration depth. Whereas there is a significant decrease in image brightness associated with oil immersion, this decrease is absent with the glycerol immersion system. In addition, we show directly the compression of the optic axis in the case of oil immersion and its absence in the glycerol system. The unique advantages of these new lenses in high-resolution microscopy with two coherently used opposing lenses, such as 4 Pi-microscopy, are discuss...|$|R

50|$|IR {{near-field}} scanning {{optical microscopy}} (IR-NSOM) {{is a powerful}} spectroscopic tool because it allows subwavelength resolution in IR spectroscopy. Previously, IR-NSOM was realized by applying a solid <b>immersion</b> <b>lens</b> with a refractive index of n, which shortens wavelength (λ) to (λ/n), compared to FTIR-based IR microscopy. In 2004, an IR-SNOM achieved a spatial resolution ~λ/7 that is less than 1 μm. This resolution was further improved to about λ/60 that is 50-150 nm for a boron nitride thin film sample.|$|E

50|$|The {{refractive}} {{indices of}} the oil and of the glass in the first lens element are nearly the same, {{which means that the}} refraction of light will be small upon entering the lens (the oil and glass are optically very similar). The correct immersion oil for an objective lens has to be used to ensure that the refractive indices are correctly matched. Use of an oil <b>immersion</b> <b>lens</b> with the incorrect immersion oil, or without immersion oil altogether, will suffer from spherical aberration. The strength of this effect depends {{on the size of the}} refractive index mismatch.|$|E

50|$|Some microscopes {{make use}} of oil-immersion {{objectives}} or water-immersion objectives for greater resolution at high magnification. These are used with index-matching material such as immersion oil or water and a matched cover slip between the objective lens and the sample. The refractive index of the index-matching material is higher than air allowing the objective lens to have a larger numerical aperture (greater than 1) so that the light is transmitted from the specimen to the outer face of the objective lens with minimal refraction. Numerical apertures as high as 1.6 can be achieved. The larger numerical aperture allows collection of more light making detailed observation of smaller details possible. An oil <b>immersion</b> <b>lens</b> usually has a magnification of 40 to 100×.|$|E

If the beam is incident from the optically denser medium, the image generated by the reflected light is strongly aberrated. This situation is encountered in high-resolution confocal microscopy and data sampling based on solid <b>immersion</b> <b>lenses</b> and oil <b>immersion</b> objectives. The origin of the observed aberrations lies {{in the nature of}} total internal reflection, for which there is a phase shift between incident and ref lected waves.

As such, a 57 % reduction in the focal area compared with the diffraction-limited case of an objective with numerical aperture of 0. 95 has been numerically achieved at a normalized frequency of 0. 3 in a photonic crystal <b>immersion</b> <b>lens,</b> corresponding to a lateral resolution of 0. 32 &# 0955; {{as well as an}} axial resolution of 0. 70 &# 0955;...|$|E

40|$|The {{luminescence}} from single {{quantum dots}} has been studied. Single dot photoluminescence was studied under continuous {{as well as}} under pulsed excitation. Time-resolved studies revealed fast relaxations in quantum dots. The time resolved measurements were fitted {{with a set of}} rate equations. Blinking in the luminescence was observed on a few quantum dots. The polarization of the emission from single quantum dots was also measured. The emission correlation was measured on a single dot and revealed the antibunched nature of the emission from single quantum dots. Single photon generation on demand was demonstrated with a single quantum dot under pulsed excitation. Attempts to generate entangled photon pairs with a single quantum dot were also made. Devices containing single quantum dots as the active region were fabricated. Light Emitting diodes were fabricated and studied, the electroluminescence from single quantum dots has been observed. Two types of microcavities containing single dots were also fabricated, planar microcavities where the light is confined between two planar mirrors and microdisks, where the light is confined in a high refractive index disk-shaped cavity in whispering modes. A processing technique was developed to position selected single quantum dots in microdisks with submicron resolution to achieve maximum coupling with the whispering modes. The problem of the very limited light extraction efficiency from high refractive index materials was studied and solid <b>immersion</b> <b>lenses</b> were used to increase the light extraction efficiency from single quantum dots.

In addition, when imaging high refractive index samples, such as semiconductors, the light collection efficiency can be increased drastically. We investigate the collection efficiency {{as a function of}} the SILs geometry and refractive index, using an analytical expression for the light dispersion through an arbitrarily truncated sphere.
