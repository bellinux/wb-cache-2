5|$|The next {{significant}} role {{is played by}} the charity trustees, defined in Section 97 of the 1993 Act as those persons having the general control {{and management of the}} administration of charities. As mentioned, charitable trustees have significantly more <b>freedom</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> than normal trustees, but the 1993 Act has put restrictions on who may be a charitable trustee. Section 72 excludes people convicted of a crime involving dishonesty, bankrupts, people previously removed from charity trusteeship, and people struck off as directors of companies. Those trustees appointed have many duties when administering the trust, including informing the Commission of changes to the charity or its dissolution, registering the charity and keeping proper accounts and records, to be submitted annually to the Commission.|$|E
25|$|For instance, {{courts of}} law make {{judgments}} about whether individuals are acting {{under their own}} free will under certain circumstances without bringing in metaphysics. Similarly, political liberty is a non-metaphysical concept. Likewise, some compatibilists define free will as <b>freedom</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> according to one's determined motives without hindrance from other individuals. So for example Aristotle in his Nicomachean Ethics, and the Stoic Chrysippus.|$|E

White taught the {{students}} about photographic style and interpretation; Weber taught design, composition and art theory; and Anderson taught the technical aspects of cameras and equipment. Jane White took on the roles of administrator, bookkeeper, social director and facilitator for her husband's daily tasks.|$|E

500|$|Den Shewman of Creative Screenwriting {{says the}} film asks how far one {{would go to}} devote oneself to an art. The {{character}} of Chung Ling Soo, according to Shewman, {{is a metaphor for}} this theme. Film critic Alex Manugian refers to this theme as the [...] "meaning of commitment." [...] For example, Soo's pretense of being slow and feeble misdirects his audience from noticing the physical strength required to perform the goldfish bowl trick, but the cost of maintaining this illusion is the sacrifice of individuality: Soo's true appearance and <b>freedom</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> naturally are consciously suppressed in his ceaseless dedication to the art of magic.|$|E
500|$|... "Freedom of {{religion}} means freedom {{to hold an}} opinion or belief, but not to take action in violation of social duties or subversive to good order." [...] In Reynolds v. United States (1878), the Supreme Court found that while laws cannot interfere with religious belief and opinions, laws {{can be made to}} regulate some religious practices (e.g., human sacrifices, and the Hindu practice of suttee). The Court stated that to rule otherwise, [...] "would be to make the professed doctrines of religious belief superior to the law of the land, and in effect permit every citizen to become a law unto himself. Government would exist only in name under such circumstances." [...] In Cantwell v. Connecticut (1940), the Court held that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment applied the Free Exercise Clause to the states. While the right to have religious beliefs is absolute, the <b>freedom</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> on such beliefs is not absolute.|$|E

2500|$|There exists no dogmatic {{moral or}} ethical code {{followed}} universally by Wiccans of all traditions, however a majority follow a code {{known as the}} Wiccan Rede, which states [...] "an it harm none, do what ye will".

2500|$|Furthermore, they {{ruled that}} the DSS {{could not be found}} liable, as a matter of {{constitutional}} law, for failure to protect Joshua DeShaney from a private actor. [...] Although there exist conditions in which the state (or a subsidiary agency, like a county department of social services) is obligated to provide protection against private actors, and failure to do so is a violation of Fourteenth Amendment rights, the court reasoned, [...] "The affirmative duty to protect arises not from the State's knowledge of the individual's predicament or from its expressions of intent to help him, but from the limitation which it has imposed on his <b>freedom</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> on his own behalf... it is the State's affirmative act of restraining the individual's <b>freedom</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> on his own behalf - through incarceration, institutionalization, or other similar restraint of personal liberty - which is the [...] "deprivation of liberty" [...] triggering the protections of the Due Process Clause, not its failure to act to protect his liberty interests against harms inflicted by other means.". [...] Since Joshua DeShaney was not in the custody of the DSS, the DSS was not required to protect him from harm. [...] In reaching this conclusion, the court opinion relied heavily on its precedents in Estelle v. Gamble and Youngberg v. Romeo.|$|E

2500|$|Secondly, {{there is}} the right to liberty, which protects an individual's <b>freedom</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> without {{physical}} restraint (i.e., imprisonment would be inconsistent with liberty unless it is consistent with fundamental justice). [...] However, the right has been extended to include the power to make important personal choices. The court described it as [...] " [...] the core {{of what it means to}} be an autonomous human being blessed with dignity and independence in matters that can be characterized as fundamentally or inherently personal." [...] (R. v. Clay, 2003) [...] That is, the concept extends beyond physical restraint by the government as it goes to the core of the human experience.|$|E
2500|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 19th century, however, a new {{conception}} of liberty entered the liberal intellectual arena. This new kind of liberty became known as positive liberty to distinguish it from the prior negative version, and it was first developed by British philosopher Thomas Hill Green. Green rejected the idea that humans were driven solely by self-interest, emphasising instead the complex circumstances {{that are involved in}} the evolution of our moral character. In a very profound step for the future of modern liberalism, he also tasked society and political institutions with the enhancement of individual freedom and identity and the development of moral character, will and reason. And the state to create the conditions that allow for the above, giving the opportunity for genuine choice. Foreshadowing the new liberty as the <b>freedom</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> rather than to avoid suffering from the acts of others, Green wrote the following: ...|$|E
2500|$|Compatibilist {{models of}} free will often {{consider}} deterministic relationships as discoverable {{in the physical world}} (including the brain). Cognitive naturalism is a physicalist approach to studying human consciousness in which mind is simply part of nature, perhaps merely a feature of many very complex self-programming feedback systems (for example, neural networks and cognitive robots), and so must be studied by the methods of empirical science, for example, behavioral science and the cognitive sciences like neuroscience and cognitive psychology. Cognitive naturalism stresses the role of neurological sciences. Overall brain health, substance dependence, depression, and various personality disorders clearly influence mental activity, and their impact upon volition also is important. For example, an addict may experience a conscious desire to escape addiction, but be unable to do so. The [...] "will" [...] is disconnected from the <b>freedom</b> <b>to</b> <b>act.</b> This situation is related to an abnormal production and distribution of dopamine in the brain.|$|E

2500|$|With {{the best}} of intentions, a unit may take on more than is allowed in the current mandate and mission. [...] "An example would be if a {{commander}} directed execution of civil action projects that fall outside his authority.

At the same time, FID and HN commanders need to recognize when they lack critical resources, or if their rules of engagement are inadequate for a rapidly developing situation. When the on-scene UN commander in Rwanda, Gen. Romeo Dallaire asked UN headquarters for <b>freedom</b> <b>to</b> <b>act,</b> it was denied due to the interpretation of UN resolutions. Hindsight is always easy, but the catastrophe that took place might have been averted had Dallaire been able to carry out certain actions, including disabling or destroying of broadcast facilities used for inflammatory propaganda, as was done early in Bosnia.|$|E
2500|$|By late January the {{strategic}} situation was hopeless and the 6th Army was starving. Strecker's positions {{had been largely}} isolated {{from the rest of}} the 6th Army, in the northern sector of Stalingrad. Strecker was determined to hold on as long as possible in order to provide any assistance he could to Erich von Manstein's other forces, although he refused to continue to fight exclusively for propaganda purposes and forbade his staff from committing suicide. In the final days of the battle Strecker worked to evacuate as many wounded as he could while trying to maintain a fighting formation. He issued an order to his officers in the final days of that month that any soldier seen breaking away from their unit and moving toward Soviet positions was to be shot and that any soldier caught taking airdropped supplies for himself or who disobeyed orders was to be immediately court-martialed. As a last-ditch effort to find a point where his corps could attempt a breakout, he authorized final reconnaissance of the Volga on 29 December but the entire west bank of the river was occupied by entrenched Soviet forces. On 1 February, having confirmed that Paulus and all other combat formations had surrendered, Strecker gathered his staff and told them that the military situation was hopeless and that all troops under his command had the <b>freedom</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> as their conscious saw fit. The next morning Strecker surrendered his 11th Corps to Soviet troops. When he and his Chief of Staff, Helmuth Groscurth, drafted the final transmission sent by the 6th Army at Stalingrad, telling the OKW that the XI Corps [...] "had done its duty", they omitted the customary [...] "Heil Hitler" [...] and instead used [...] "Long live Germany". This omission was noticed and likely changed before reaching Hitler. Paulus later said that he received a radio transmission just prior to his surrender that promoted Strecker to Generaloberst and conferred this promotion on Strecker after the surrender but the transmission was not able to be substantiated after the war.|$|E
