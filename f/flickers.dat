40|$|Industries {{that produce}} <b>flicker</b> are often placed {{close to each}} other and {{connected}} to the same power grid system. This implies that the measured <b>flicker</b> level at the point of common coupling (PCC) is a result of contribution from a number of different <b>flicker</b> sources. In a mitigation process it is essential to know which one of the <b>flicker</b> sources is the dominant one. We propose a method to determine the <b>flicker</b> propagations and trace the <b>flicker</b> sources by using <b>flicker</b> power measurements. <b>Flicker</b> power is considered as a quantity containing both sign and magnitude. The sign determines if a <b>flicker</b> source is placed downstream or upstream with respect to a given monitoring point and the magnitude is used to determine the propagation of <b>flicker</b> power throughout the power network and to trace the dominant <b>flicker</b> source. This paper covers the theoretical background of <b>flicker</b> power and describes a novel method for calculation of <b>flicker</b> power that can be implemented in a power network analyzer. Also conducted simulations and a field test based on the proposed method will be described in the paper...|$|R

Every scene in the film includes computer-generated imagery (CGI)—even the flashback scenes, where the backdrops were digitally altered. Studio scenes, helicopter shots, and CGI were forged together in the hovering sequences with the intention that the viewer should be unable to determine which is which. For shots from high altitudes, the team started with helicopter footage from video, and then created computer models of the neighbourhoods with textures from photographs. Neon lights, reflections, and dark areas were consistently accentuated. <b>Flickers</b> were created through a mixture of motion blur, chromatic aberration, and focus effects. For scenes seen as through a fisheye lens, the team recreated the sets digitally and progressively increased the environments' reflection values along with the lens effect.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>Flicker</b> {{envelope}} tracking {{is the key}} {{of analyzing}} voltage <b>flicker</b> signal. A novel method, i. e., cubic spline interpolation method is applied in the detection of the voltage <b>flicker</b> envelope. The typical <b>flicker</b> signals, such as one or multi-frequencies and frequency time-varying <b>flicker</b> signal are selected and analyzed by this method. Simulation results indicate that this method is effective in the detection of the envelope of voltage <b>flicker</b> signal. Results of one or multi-frequencies <b>flicker</b> signal simulation show that, when <b>flicker</b> frequency is less than 15 Hz, the error of this method is quite tiny. The detection precision of this method is higher, especially in the scope of low frequencies of <b>flicker</b> and this method makes up for the disadvantage of square demodulation. Furthermore, results of frequency time-varying <b>flicker</b> signal simulation show that, the occurrence and recover time of voltage <b>flicker</b> signal can be accurately detected by cubic spline interpolation method...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a new and}} highly efficient measurement method (algorithm) that determines how <b>flicker</b> propagates throughout the network and also traces the dominant <b>flicker</b> source. The fundamental principle of the method {{is to use the}} fact that a <b>flicker</b> source produces an amplitude modulation in the voltage and current waveforms. The low frequency variations in voltage and current that cause <b>flicker</b> are retrieved in a demodulation and filtering process. By first multiplying the low frequency variations in voltage and current and then integrate, a new quantity, <b>flicker</b> power, is achieved. The sign and the magnitude of <b>flicker</b> power give the direction to the <b>flicker</b> source as well as tracing the dominating <b>flicker</b> source. Godkänd; 2005; 20081020 (ysko...|$|R

Overall, fewer insects were captured in traps illuminated with a <b>flickering</b> light source, independent of the <b>flicker</b> setting used. Furthermore, the difference observed was statistically significant for specific combinations of <b>flickering</b> conditions and insect orders, thus suggesting that <b>flickering</b> reduces the number of nocturnal insects attracted to light sources. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{quality of}} {{electric}} power is of supreme importance to electrical utilities and their customers. Modern equipments {{are more sensitive}} to power system anomalies than in the past. Microprocessor based controls and power electronics devices are sensitive to many types of disturbances. Minor power disruptions, which once would have been noticed only as a momentary <b>flickering</b> of the lights, may now completely interrupt whole automated factories because of sensitive electronic controllers or make all the computer screens at an office go blank at once. In order to restart the whole production, computers, etc, a considerable time might be necessary, implying on significant financial losses to an industry. Hence voltage <b>flicker</b> caused by loads that exhibit continuous, rapid variations in load current is considered as a major power quality issue. In order to quantify the scale of <b>flickering</b> phenomenon, {{research has been conducted}} with the aims of developing measurement equipment, containment techniques and methods of mitigation. Accurate tracking and estimation of the voltage <b>flicker</b> levels are important for effective design and implementations of voltage <b>flicker</b> mitigation devices.

40|$|Voltage <b>flicker</b> is an irritating problem {{especially}} for the low voltage (LV) customers. It is mainly caused by the loads having repetitive cycle of operation. During the past years, the network operators {{around the world have}} registered many complaints from the customers about <b>flicker</b> related problems. Presently, there is no common standard value for the <b>flicker</b> planning level available globally. Moreover, in some countries (for example, in the Netherlands), the existing networks are not even based on a specific planning level value for <b>flicker.</b> Therefore, it is necessary to discuss the <b>flicker</b> planning level values in different voltage levels to overcome <b>flicker</b> related problems. In this paper a typical LV network is simulated to analyze the <b>flicker</b> propagation behavior in the network. The effects of switching LV disturbing loads (such as elevator, welding machine, etc.) on <b>flicker</b> generation at different customer's installations are studied by using synchronized measurement technique. Also, the impacts of the background <b>flicker</b> pollution transferred from the upstream to the downstream networks are analyzed. The simulation results give an overview of the <b>flicker</b> pollution levels at the LV customer's installations in the presence of background <b>flicker.</b> This paper estimates the maximum value of <b>flicker</b> emission share at different customer's point of connections (POC), considering the impact of background <b>flicker</b> pollution. Finally, planning level values of <b>flicker</b> in different voltage levels are suggested that can be useful for the network operators in designing their future networks...|$|R
40|$|Human {{ability to}} resolve {{temporal}} variation, or <b>flicker,</b> in the luminance (brightness) or chromaticity (color) {{of an image}} declines with increasing frequency and is limited, within the central visual field, to a critical <b>flicker</b> frequency of ≈ 50 and 25 Hz, respectively. Much remains unknown about the neural filtering that underlies this frequency-dependent attenuation of <b>flicker</b> sensitivity, most notably the number of filtering stages involved and their neural loci. Here we use the process of <b>flicker</b> adaptation, by which an observer's <b>flicker</b> sensitivity is attenuated after prolonged exposure to <b>flickering</b> lights, as a functional landmark. We show that <b>flicker</b> adaptation is more sensitive to high temporal frequencies than is conscious perception and that prolonged exposure to invisible <b>flicker</b> of either luminance or chromaticity, at frequencies above the respective critical <b>flicker</b> frequency, can compromise our visual sensitivity. This suggests that multiple filtering stages, distributed across retinal and cortical loci that straddle the locus for <b>flicker</b> adaptation, {{are involved in the}} neural filtering of high temporal frequencies by the human visual system...|$|R

40|$|AbstractProlonged {{viewing of}} a <b>flickering</b> region reduces {{sensitivity}} to a subsequently <b>flickered</b> test patch of identical extent, but the spatial properties of this adaptation are unknown. What {{happens to the}} sensitivity to a smaller <b>flickered</b> test patch completely contained in, but inset from, the adapted region? We show that sensitivity to the inset test patch is only slightly affected by adaptation of the larger region. This suggests that neurons that respond {{to the edges of}} the smaller test patch are not adapted by the larger <b>flickering</b> region. We then show that an annulus adapter designed specifically to adapt only those edges only slightly reduces sensitivity, demonstrating that neurons that do not adapt to the <b>flickered</b> edges are also involved in detecting <b>flicker.</b> This gives further evidence that <b>flicker</b> detection depends on at least two mechanisms – one sensitive to <b>flickering</b> edges and one sensitive to local <b>flicker,</b> and shows that these mechanisms can operate in isolation...|$|R
