500|$|According to a {{story by}} Procopius, {{it was not until}} 552 CE that the Byzantine emperor Justinian {{obtained}} the first silkworm eggs. He had sent two Nestorian monks to Central Asia, {{and they were able to}} smuggle silkworm eggs to him hidden <b>in</b> <b>rods</b> of bamboo. While under the monks' care, the eggs hatched, though they did not cocoon before arrival. The church manufacture in the Byzantine Empire was thus able to make fabrics for the emperor, with the intention of developing a large silk industry in the Eastern Roman Empire, using techniques learned from the Sassanids. These gynecia had a legal monopoly on the fabric, but the empire continued to import silk from other major urban centres on the Mediterranean. The magnificence of the Byzantine techniques was not a result of the manufacturing process, but instead of the meticulous attention paid to the execution and decorations. The weaving techniques they used were taken from Egypt. The first diagrams of semple looms appeared [...] in the 5th century.|$|E

2500|$|Evgeny Fesenko, Stanislav Kolesnikov, and Arkady Lyubarsky {{discovered}} in 1985 that {{cyclic guanosine monophosphate}} (cGMP) can initiate the photoresponse <b>in</b> <b>rods.</b> Soon after, the role of cNMP in gated ion channels of chemosensitive cilia of olfactory sensory neurons was reported by Tadashi Nakamura and Geoffrey Gold. In 1992 Lawrence Haynes and King-Wai Yau uncovered cNMP’s role in the light-dependent cyclic-nucleotide-gated channel of cone photoreceptors. By {{the end of the}} decade, the presence of two types of intramembrane receptors was understood: Rs (which stimulates cyclase) and Ri (which inhibits cyclase). [...] Wei-Jen Tang and James Hurley reported in 1998 that adenylyl cyclase, which synthesizes cAMP, is regulated not only by hormones and neurotransmitters, but also by phosphorylation, calcium, forskolin, and guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins).|$|E

40|$|Insulin {{receptor}} (IR) signaling {{provides a}} trophic signal for transformed retinal neurons in culture, but {{the role of}} IR activity in vivo is unknown. We previously reported that light causes increased tyrosine phosphorylation of the IR in vivo, {{which leads to the}} downstream activation of the phosphoinositide 3 -kinase and Akt pathway <b>in</b> <b>rod</b> photoreceptor cells. The functional role of IR <b>in</b> <b>rod</b> photoreceptor cells is not known. We observed that light stress induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the IR <b>in</b> <b>rod</b> photoreceptor cells, and we hypothesized that IR activation is neuroprotective. To determine whether IR has a neuroprotective role on rod photoreceptor cells, we used the Cre/lox system to specifically inactivate the IR gene <b>in</b> <b>rod</b> photoreceptors. Rod-specific IR knock-out mice have reduced the phosphoinositide 3 -kinase and Akt survival signal <b>in</b> <b>rod</b> photoreceptors. The resultant mice exhibited no detectable phenotype when they were raised in dim cyclic light. However, reduced IR expression <b>in</b> <b>rod</b> photoreceptors significantly decreased retinal function and caused the loss of photoreceptors in mice exposed to bright light stress. These results indicate that reduced expression of IR <b>in</b> <b>rod</b> photoreceptor cells increases their susceptibility to light-induced photoreceptor degeneration. These data suggest that the IR pathway is important for photoreceptor survival and that activation of the IR may be an essential element of photoreceptor neuroprotection...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the assessment of}} CATHARE 3 against PWR subchannel and rod bundle tests of the PSBT benchmark. Noticeable measurements were the following: void fraction in single subchannel and rod bundle, multiple liquid temperatures at subchannel exit <b>in</b> <b>rod</b> bundle, and DNB power and location <b>in</b> <b>rod</b> bundle. All these results were obtained both in steady and transient conditions. Void fraction values are satisfactory predicted by CATHARE 3 in single subchannels with the pipe module. More dispersed predictions of void values are obtained <b>in</b> <b>rod</b> bundles with the CATHARE 3 3 D module at subchannel scale. Single-phase liquid mixing tests and DNB tests <b>in</b> <b>rod</b> bundle are also analyzed. After calibrating the mixing in liquid single phase with specific tests, DNB tests using void mixing give mitigated results, perhaps linked to inappropriate use of CHF lookup tables <b>in</b> such <b>rod</b> bundles with many spacers...|$|R
2500|$|The role {{of vitamin}} A {{in the visual}} cycle is {{specifically}} related to the retinal form. Within the eye, 11-cis-retinal is bound to the protein [...] "opsin" [...] to form rhodopsin <b>in</b> <b>rods</b> and iodopsin (cones) at conserved lysine residues. As light enters the eye, the 11-cis-retinal is isomerized to the all-"trans" [...] form. The all-"trans" [...] retinal dissociates from the opsin {{in a series of}} steps called photo-bleaching. This isomerization induces a nervous signal along the optic nerve to the visual center of the brain. After separating from opsin, the all-"trans"-retinal is recycled and converted back to the 11-"cis"-retinal form by a series of enzymatic reactions. In addition, some of the all-"trans" [...] retinal may be converted to all-"trans" [...] retinol form and then transported with an interphotoreceptor retinol-binding protein (IRBP) to the pigment epithelial cells. Further esterification into all-"trans" [...] retinyl esters allow for storage of all-trans-retinol within the pigment epithelial cells to be reused when needed. The final stage is conversion of 11-cis-retinal will rebind to opsin to reform rhodopsin (visual purple) in the retina. Rhodopsin is needed to see in low light (contrast) as well as for night vision. Kühne showed that rhodopsin in the retina is only regenerated when the retina is attached to retinal pigmented epithelium, which provides retinal. It {{is for this reason that}} a deficiency in vitamin A will inhibit the reformation of rhodopsin and lead to one of the first symptoms, night blindness.|$|E
60|$|Tom {{made for}} the ladder, and Austin, who went with him, {{carrying}} the book, was drenched before he reached the skipper's room. The air was filled with falling water that came down <b>in</b> <b>rods,</b> and blotted out the mangroves a dozen yards away. Steam rose from the sluicing deck, the creek boiled beneath the deluge, {{but there was no}} longer any trace of the insufferable tension, and he stood a moment or two relaxing under the rush of lukewarm water that beat his thin clothing flat against his skin. Then he splashed forward to the forecastle, where Tom had little difficulty in rousing the men. They crawled out, gaunt and haggard, in filthy rags, some of them apparently scarcely fit to stand, for the rain had come, and every inch the water rose would bring them so much nearer home. There was no need to urge them when they floundered into the engine room, and hour after hour they strained and sweated on big spanner and chain-tackle willingly, while the big cylinder-heads and pistons were hauled up to the beams. The one thought which animated them was that the engines would be wanted soon.|$|E

Nearer hand, she saw where the tender springs welled up in silence, or oozed in green moss; or in the more favoured hollows a whole family of infant rivers would combine, and tinkle in the stones, and lie in pools to be a bathing-place for sparrows, or fall from the sheer rock <b>in</b> <b>rods</b> of crystal. Upon all these things, as she still sped along in the bright air, she looked with a rapture of surprise and a joyful fainting of the heart; they seemed so novel, they touched so strangely home, they were so hued and scented, they were so beset and canopied by the dome of the blue air of heaven.|$|E

5000|$|Guanylate cyclase {{is found}} in the retina (RETGC) and modulates phototransduction <b>in</b> <b>rods</b> and cones. It is part of the calcium {{negative}} feedback system that is activated in response to the hyperpolarization of the photoreceptors by light. This causes less intracellular calcium, which stimulates guanylate cyclase-activating proteins (GCAPs).
