40|$|OBJECTIVE: Besides its {{predictive}} role {{in determining}} cardiovascular risk, C-reactive protein (CRP) may exert direct proatherogenic effects through proinflammatory properties. CRP is mainly produced by hepatocytes in response to interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) and is then released into the systemic circulation. 3 -hydroxy- 3 -methylglutaryl (<b>HMG)</b> -coenzyme A (<b>CoA)</b> <b>reductase</b> inhibitors, or statins, significantly reduce cardiovascular events and mortality in patients with or without coronary artery disease and reduce plasma CRP levels in humans. However, the mechanism by which statins reduce plasma CRP levels remains unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this study, we report that statins limit both protein and RNA levels of IL- 6 -induced CRP in human hepatocytes. These effects are reversed by l-mevalonate and mimicked by an inhibitor of the geranylgeranyltransferase. IL- 6 -induced CRP production requires the binding of IL- 6 to its cognate receptors, which results in activation and phosphorylation of the transcription factor STAT 3. We provide evidence that statins reduce this IL- 6 -induced phosphorylation of STAT 3 in hepatocytes. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that statins reduce IL- 6 -induced CRP production directly in hepatocytes via inhibition of protein geranylgeranylation. We further show that statins act via inhibition of STAT 3 phosphorylation. These findings furnish new evidence for direct antiinflammatory properties of statins and provide new mechanistic insight into their clinical benefits...|$|R

Here, we investigated the effect of lovastatin on protein prenylation and cell signaling. We show that high concentrations (50 M) of lovastatin inhibit Ras, Rho, and Rap prenylation but that therapeutic levels of lovastatin (50 nM to 500 nM) do not. In contrast, depletion of cellular cholesterol by therapeutic levels of lovastatin increased Ras GTP loading and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells and rodent fibroblasts. Elevated Ras signaling was not seen in statin-treated cells if cholesterol levels were maintained by supplementation. Activation of Ras-MAPK signaling was a consequence of, and dependent on, activation of phospholipase D 2 (PLD 2). Expression of dominant interfering PLD 2 or biochemical inhibition of PLD 2 abrogated Ras and MAPK activation induced by lovastatin. In contrast, ectopic expression of wild-type PLD 2 enhanced Ras and MAPK activation in response to therapeutic levels of lovastatin. Statin-induced cholesterol depletion also modestly activated the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), resulting in downregulation of EGFR expression. These results suggest that statins modulate key cell signaling pathways as a direct consequence of cholesterol depletion and identify the EGFR-PLD 2 -Ras-MAPK axis as an important statin target...|$|R

Methods and Results—In a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify genetic variants influencing LDL-C in an isolated population from Kosrae, we observed associations for SNPs in the gene encoding 3 hydroxy– 3 –methylglutaryl (<b>HMG)</b> -coenzyme A (<b>CoA)</b> <b>reductase</b> (HMGCR). Three of these SNPs (rs 7703051, rs 12654264, and rs 3846663) met the statistical threshold of genome-wide significance when combined with data from the Diabetes Genetics Initiative GWAS. We followed up the association results and identified a functional SNP in intron 13 (rs 3846662), which was in linkage disequilibrium with the SNPs of genome-wide significance and affected alternative splicing of HMGCR mRNA. In vitro studies in human lymphoblastoid cells demonstrated that homozygosity for the rs 3846662 minor allele was associated with up to 2. 2 -fold lower expression of alternatively spliced HMGCR mRNA lacking exon 13, and minigene transfection assays confirmed that allele status at rs 3846662 directly modulated alternative splicing of HMGCR exon 13 (42. 93. 9 versus 63. 71. 0 %exon 13 /total HMGCR mRNA, P 0. 02).

We have characterized a murine disease model in which coronary arteritis is induced by a novel superantigen found in Lactobacillus casei cell wall extract (LCWE). Using this animal model of KD, we have identified three pathogenic steps leading to coronary artery aneurysm formation. These steps include T cell activation and proliferation, production of the proinflammatory cytokine tumour necrosis factor (TNF) -α and up-regulation of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP- 9), an elastolytic protease. In addition to their cholesterol-lowering effects, 3 -hydroxy- 3 -methylglutaryl (<b>HMG)</b> coenzyme A (<b>CoA)</b> <b>reductase</b> inhibitors (statins) have pleotropic immunomodulatory properties. Thus, we examined the effect of atorvastatin in modulating each of these three critical pathogenic processes leading to aneurysm formation in the disease model. Atorvastatin inhibited lymphocyte proliferation in response to superantigen stimulation in a dose-dependent manner. This inhibition was also observed for production of soluble mediators of inflammation including interleukin (IL) - 2 and TNF-α. The inhibitory effect on proliferation was rescued completely by mevalonic acid, confirming that the mechanism responsible for this inhibitory activity on immune activation was inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase. Similarly, TNF-α-induced MMP- 9 production was reduced in a dose-dependent manner in response to atorvastatin. Inhibition of extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation appears to be the mechanism responsible for inhibition of MMP- 9 production. In conclusion, atorvastatin is able to inhibit critical steps known to be important in the development of coronary aneurysms, suggesting that statins may have therapeutic benefit in patients with KD...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectivesThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether atorvastatin, a 3 -hydroxy- 3 -methylglutaryl (<b>HMG)</b> -co-enzyme A (<b>CoA)</b> <b>reductase</b> inhibitor, limits myocardial necrosis when administered as an adjunct to reperfusion. BackgroundStatins inhibit HMG-CoA reductase to reduce the synthesis of cholesterol. However, it is proposed that statins have cardiovascular effects beyond their ability to lower cholesterol, possibly via recruitment of phosphatidyl inositol 3 -kinase (PI 3 K) and the serine/threonine kinase, Akt. This signaling pathway has recently been linked to growth factor–mediated reperfusion salvage. MethodsIsolated perfused mouse hearts were subjected to 35 min of global ischemia and reperfused for 30 min in the presence of incremental concentrations of atorvastatin. Infarct size was determined by triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining, and the activity of the PI 3 K signaling cascade was determined by Western blot analysis. ResultsWe found that there was a profound dose-dependent reduction of infarct size with atorvastatin in the range of 25 to 100 μmol/l (optimal protection was seen at 50 μmol/l with infarct size of 16 ± 2 % vs. control, 33 ± 2 %, p < 0. 01). Moreover, this protection was sensitive to inhibition with the PI 3 kinase inhibitor, wortmannin, and was absent in endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) knockout mice. Western blot analysis revealed that atorvastatin resulted in rapid activation of the PI 3 K/Akt signaling cascade (within 5 min) and that both Akt and eNOS phosphorylation were significantly increased by 4. 1 -fold and 2. 9 -fold, respectively (p < 0. 01). Moreover, phosphorylation of the PI 3 K substrates was abrogated by the administration of wortmannin. ConclusionsAtorvastatin attenuates lethal reperfusion-induced injury in a manner that is reliant on PI 3 K and Akt activity and the presence and activity of eNOS...|$|R
