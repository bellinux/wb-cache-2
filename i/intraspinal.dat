50|$|Cobb {{syndrome}} {{is a rare}} congenital disorder characterized by visible skin lesions with underlying spinal angiomas or arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). The skin lesions of Cobb syndrome typically are present as port wine stains or angiomas, but reports exist of angiokeratomas, angiolipomas, and lymphangioma circumscriptum. The <b>intraspinal</b> lesions may be angiomas or AVMs and occur at levels of the spinal cord corresponding to the affected skin dermatomes.

5000|$|Spondylitis, {{a typical}} sign {{ascribed}} to spirocercosis, {{is thought to}} arise from aberrant migration {{of some of the}} larvae leaving the aorta. Spondylitis is highly specific for spirocercosis. It has even observed that the <b>intraspinal</b> migration of worms can cause a typical “acute intervertebral disc” syndrome. It has been described that some dogs develop salivary gland necrosis as a result of presumptive vagal afferent dysfunction (similar to the pathogenesis of hypertrophic osteopathy), , [...] They may also develop pyothorax, and S. lupi should be considered a potential cause for this syndrome.|$|E
50|$|The tumors' {{appearance}} on CT and MRI are nonspecific, tending towards large size, calcifications, necrosis (tissue death), and hemorrhage (bleeding). Radiological studies alone cannot identify AT/RT; a pathologist almost {{always has to}} evaluate a brain tissue sample. The increased cellularity of the tumor may make the {{appearance on}} an uncontrasted CT to have increased attenuation. Solid parts of the tumor often enhance with contrast MRI finding on T1 and T2 weighted images are variable. Pre-contrast T2 weighted images may show an iso-signal or slightly hyper-signal. Solid components of the tumor may enhance with contrast but do not always.

5000|$|The Valsalva {{maneuver}} {{is used to}} aid in {{the clinical}} diagnosis of problems or injury in the nerves of the cervical spine. [...] Upon performing the Valsalva maneuver, <b>intraspinal</b> pressure slightly increases. Thus, neuropathies or radicular pain may be felt or exacerbated, and this may indicate impingement on a nerve by an intervertebral disc or other part of the anatomy. Headache and pain upon performing the Valsalva maneuver {{is also one of the}} main symptoms in Arnold-Chiari malformation.The Valsalva maneuver may be of use in checking for a dural tear following certain spinal operations such as a microdiscectomy. An increase in intra-spinal pressure will cause CSF to leak out of the dura causing a headache.|$|E
50|$|Laminotomies {{are also}} {{performed}} {{to create a}} window into the spinal canal in order to fix a problem that is within the spinal canal. Laminotomies are frequently used as a way to surgically repair a spinal disc herniation at any level of the vertebral column (cervical, thoracic, lumbar). A herniated disc can compress spinal nerves and cause intense pain and impaired sensation. Removing a portion of the lamina allows physicians to be able to access and repair the herniated disc. Laminotomies may also be used to treat <b>intraspinal</b> lesions such as spinal tumor or problems with the blood vessels supplying the spinal cord. In any scenario where the inside of the spinal canal must be accessed or there is an increase in pressure in the spinal canal, laminotomy may be used to treat the disorder or alleviate symptoms.|$|E
50|$|Two more {{conductive}} {{materials that}} have notable characteristics are tungsten and indium tin oxide. Tungsten is electrically conductive {{and can be}} manufactured down to a very fine point, {{and for this reason}} has been used in <b>intraspinal</b> microstimulation (ISMS) for mapping out spinal cords during terminal surgeries. Tungsten electrodes, however, can corrode and form tungstic ions in the presence of H2O2 and/or O2. Tungstic acid has been seen to be highly toxic to cat motorneurons, and for this reason, does not currently make a suitable material for chronic implants. Indium tin oxide (ITO) has been used as electrode material for in vitro studies. ITO electrodes are very precise when stimulating and recording and when placed amongst plasma proteins, develop and maintain the thinnest protein layer compared to the other materials so far mentioned. It may have potential for acute in vivo usage, but over time, it has been observed to let go of particles producing highly toxic effects.|$|E
50|$|Traumatic pneumorrhachis is {{very rare}} phenomenon. Only eight cases with pneumorrhachis {{extending}} {{to more than one}} spinal region had been reported in the literature. Gordon had initially described the phenomenon of <b>intraspinal</b> air. The term pneumorrhachis was used for the first time by Newbold et al. The two subtypes of pneumorrhachis, which includes epidural or subarachnoid, are difficult to distinguish even with CT scanning. However, the presence of pneumocephalus goes more in favor of subarachnoid subtype. Goh and Yeo in their study have reported that the epidural pneumorrhachis is self-limited, whereas the more common subarachnoid pneumorrhachis type may be complicated by tension pneumocephalus and meningitis. Traumatic subarachnoid pneumorrhachis is almost always secondary to major trauma and is a marker of a severe injury. The pathophysiology described for it states that the penetrated air, which had {{led to the formation of}} pneumocephalus might have been forced caudally due to the raised intracranial pressure as a consequence of severe brain injury and patient's horizontal position allowing the entrapped air to pass through the foramen magnum into the spinal canal. Due to its rareness, asymptomatic presentation and myriad etiologies, no guidelines for its treatment or care has been described. Pneumorrhachis typically resolves spontaneously but occasionally it can have serious complications. Patient with subarachnoid pneumorrhachis should be treated meticulously and a temporary lumbar drainage may be required if they have concomitant cerebro-spinal fluid leak.|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY: We report 2 {{cases of}} <b>intraspinal</b> germinoma {{associated}} with Klinefelter syndrome. In one patient, spinal cord atrophy {{was observed at}} {{the upper and lower}} ends of the <b>intraspinal</b> tumor. Brain atrophy was observed in both cases. Germinoma {{should be included in the}} differential diagnosis if an <b>intraspinal</b> tumor is observed in a patient with Klinefelter syndrome. Klinefelter syndrome is a variation of sex chromosome dis-order characterized by hypogonadism, gynecomastia, and azoospermia, and the most frequent karyotype is XXY. 1 A pa-tient with Klinefelter syndrome has an increased risk of devel-opingmalignant tumors such as a breast cancer, leukemia, and extragonadal germinoma. 2, 3 Most of the extragonadal germi-nomas, including those associated with Klinefelter syndrome, are located within the mediastinum. 4, 5 Germinomas in the central nervous system (CNS) associated with Klinefelter syn-drome, especially in the spinal cord, are extremely rare disor-ders. 2, 6 We report 2 cases of <b>intraspinal</b> germinoma associated with Klinefelter syndrome. In addition, we reviewed the liter-ature with reference to the radiologic features of <b>intraspinal</b> germinoma and clinical features of germinoma in the CNS associated with Klinefelter syndrome...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To report {{clinical}} and diagnostic imaging features, and outcome after surgical treatment of ventral <b>intraspinal</b> cysts in dogs. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study. ANIMALS: Dogs (n= 7) with ventral <b>intraspinal</b> cysts. METHODS: Clinical signs, {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) findings and surgical findings of 7 dogs and histologic findings (1 dog) with <b>intraspinal</b> cysts associated with the intervertebral disc were reviewed. RESULTS: Ventral <b>intraspinal</b> cyst is characterized by: (1) clinical signs indistinguishable from those of typical disc herniation; (2) an extradural, round to oval, mass lesion with low T 1 and high T 2 signal intensity on MRI, compatible with a liquid-containing cyst; (3) cyst is {{in close proximity to}} the intervertebral disc; and (4) MRI signs of disc degeneration. Although the exact cause is unknown, underlying minor disc injury may predispose to cyst formation. CONCLUSION: <b>Intraspinal</b> cysts have clinical signs identical to those of disc herniation. Given the close proximity of the cyst to the corresponding disc and the similarity of MRI findings to discal cysts in humans, we propose the term "canine discal cyst" to describe this observation. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Discal cysts should be considered in the differential choices for cystic extradural compressing lesions...|$|E
40|$|<b>Intraspinal</b> rib head {{dislocation}} is {{an important}} but under-recognized consequence of dystrophic scoliosis in patients with neurofibromatosis 1 (NF 1). To present clinical and imaging findings of <b>intraspinal</b> rib head dislocation in NF 1.

40|$|Hydrocephalus may rarely be the {{revealing}} {{symptom of}} <b>intraspinal</b> tumours. This form of presentation {{is more common}} in malignant spinal cord tumours due to subarachnoid dissemination and meningeal tumoural infiltration up to the intracranial basal cisterns. In contrast, in benign <b>intraspinal</b> tumours the mechanism of hydrocephalus has been a subject of controversy and various explanations have been proposed. We discuss different pathophysiological hypotheses and propose a mechanical explanation based on current knowledge of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) dynamics. We hypothesize that hydrocephalus in benign <b>intraspinal</b> tumours is the result of alteration of craniospinal compliance distribution. <b>Intraspinal</b> tumours may decrease the compliance of the caudal spinal portion, thereby reducing overall CSF space compliance. In this condition, minimal changes to other implicated factors such as CSF protein concentration, intracranial CSF flow resistance due to arachnoiditis or intracranial vascular compliance may have a greater effect on CSF dynamics. After tumour removal, hydrocephalus disappears rapidly due to spinal compliance recovery...|$|E
