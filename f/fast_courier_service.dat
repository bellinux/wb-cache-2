40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} systematic, seven-step {{development}} method for control systems. The first five steps are dedicated to correctly capturing {{the requirements of the}} control system into one, single specification. The last two steps focus on identifying a control system-specific structure from this specification. A central point in our method is the modeling of system components on two different levels: informally as UML diagrams and formally as action system-based specifications. The diagrams contribute to capturing requirements, defining the control structure, and documenting the final system. The formal specifications ensure the robustness of the method. We develop the formal specifications (using refinement and decomposition techniques) in parallel with the UML diagrams. Since the UML diagrams mirror the formal part of the development, we remark an informal refinement of such diagrams. The proposed method is demonstrated with a detailed case study on the sorting hub of a <b>fast</b> <b>courier</b> <b>service...</b>|$|E
2500|$|Commentators {{have claimed}} that {{technological}} innovation will significantly reduce the demand for same-day parcel delivery, predicting that the fax machine, and then the internet, would render the messenger business obsolete. There is still a demand for <b>fast</b> <b>courier</b> <b>services</b> but there is certainly some truth in the predictions. Reliable data specifically relating to bicycle messenger occupational statistics is hard to find: the U.S. Department of Labor statistics does not track bicycle messengers specifically, and does not include [...] "independent contractors" [...] in statistics referenced for this industry occupation, but reports indicate the business is shrinking.|$|R

2500|$|To {{cross the}} Alps, the caravans of pack mules {{made their way}} over the Mont Cenis Pass, a journey that {{took more than a}} month from Genoa to the fair cities, along one of the varied options of the Via Francigena. Professional freight-handlers might make the trek, under {{contract}} to merchants. P. Huvelin documented the existence, by {{the second half of the}} thirteenth century, of a <b>faster</b> <b>courier</b> <b>service</b> facilitated the transfer of letters and market information between north and south, one organised for the particular advantage of the Arte di Calimala, the cloth-merchants' guild of Florence, others organised by cities of Siena and Genoa and by the mercantile houses. In early February, 1290, it took a courier no more than twenty days to make the journey from Lagny to Florence, R. D. Face noted. [...] Alternatively, north Italian goods were shipped to Aigues-Mortes then up or along the Rhone, Saône and Seine.|$|R
2500|$|Hawks {{used the}} media {{attention}} that was garnered by his record flights to promote aviation, especially demonstrating that <b>fast</b> <b>courier</b> air <b>service</b> was feasible. On October 7, 1930, with {{the completion of the}} final World Series game at Philadelphia, Hawks flew [...] to North Beach, Queens, delivering the game photographs exactly 20 minutes later, faster than wire service at the time. Each of his highly publicized flights served to illustrate the speed and safety of modern air travel. His autobiography Speed was also published in 1930 documenting his life and aviation career. The book was well written and became a highly popular title (still sought-after to this day). During his [...] goodwill tour of Europe in 1931, Hawks established 55 intercity records in 12 countries and after returning from Europe in late 1931, continuing to set over 130 U.S. point-to-point records in the [...] "Texaco 13" [...] until April 16, 1932, when the aircraft was heavily damaged in a crash.|$|R
40|$|Transportation {{of blood}} samples is {{unavoidable}} for assessment of specific parameters in blood {{of patients with}} rare anemias, blood doping testing or for research purposes. Despite the awareness that shipment may substantially alter multiple parameters, no study of that extend has been performed to assess these changes and optimize shipment conditions to reduce transportation-related artifacts. Here we investigate the changes in multiple parameters in blood of healthy donors over 72 hours of simulated shipment conditions. Three different anticoagulants (K 3 EDTA, Sodium Heparin and citrate-based CPDA) for two temperatures (4 oC and room temperature) were tested to define the optimal transportation conditions. Parameters measured cover common cytology and biochemistry parameters (complete blood count, hematocrit, morphological examination), red blood cell (RBC) volume, ion content and density, membrane properties and stability (hemolysis, osmotic fragility, membrane heat stability, patch-clamp investigations and formation of micro vesicles), Ca 2 + handling, RBC metabolism, activity of numerous enzymes and O 2 transport capacity. Our findings indicate that individual sets of parameter may require different shipment settings (anticoagulants, temperature). Most of the parameters except for ion (Na+, K+, Ca 2 +) handling and, possibly, reticulocytes counts, tend to favor transportation at 4 oC. Whereas plasma and intraerythrocytic Ca 2 + cannot be accurately measured {{in the presence of}} chelators such as citrate and EDTA, majority of Ca 2 +-dependent parameters are stabilized in CPDA samples. Even in blood samples from healthy donors transported using optimized shipment protocol the majority of parameters were stable within 24 hours, the condition that may not hold for the samples of patients with rare anemias. This implies for the as short as possible shipping using <b>fast</b> <b>courier</b> <b>services</b> to the closest expert laboratory at reach. Mobile laboratories or the travel of the patients to the specialized laboratories may be the only option for some groups of patients with highly unstable RBCs...|$|R
