40|$|Countries in Eastern and Central Europe {{that are}} likely to join the European Union will {{eventually}} also join the European Monetary Union. The process of accession will entail a transition period {{at the end of which}} it is certain that the domestic currency will be replaced by the <b>Euro.</b> This <b>paper</b> argues that this programmed demise of the domestic currency may bring about significant spontaneous euroization already during the transition period. If the euro is adopted by the private sector in anticipation of the official changeover, the country incurs a resource cost in the form of lost seignorage. Compared to the initial members of the EMU that could print Euros equal to the outstanding monetary base, a country where euroization takes place before the entry into the EMU will use real resources to obtain the <b>Euros.</b> The <b>paper</b> proposes ways to deal with this difference in treatment.

The split between the tradable and non-tradable sectors of the economy is highlighted. The model is used to examine a specific exchange rate shock. The results of this calibration suggest that a sustained increase of 15 per cent {{in the value of the}} euro would reduce employment by 1. 5 per cent and the domestic price level by about 7. 3 per cent. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{begins by}} {{reviewing}} {{the debate about}} exchange rate regimes in the transition countries of Eastern and Central Europe (CEECs), and suggests that prototypically such countries move through three stages: from fixed rates to flexible rates or, typically, managed floats, {{and then back to}} fixed rates again in preparation for adopting the <b>euro.</b> The <b>paper</b> then analyzes dilemmas associated with managed floats, or, more generally, “intermediate ” regimes. It then looks at de facto adoption of foreign currencies in CEECs (i. e. dollarization and euroization), and analyzes the incentives for unilateral adoption of the euro: that is, without endorsement by the EU. Finally, it explores some implications for the embryonic debate about “currency cooperation ” in East Asia...|$|R

For international externalities of deposit insurance policies to exist, {{there has to be}} international ownership of either bank deposits or bank shares. On both counts, EU banking markets are currently highly integrated. The minimum coverage of 20, 000 euros imposes costs if it forces some countries to 'overinsure' deposits. From a national perspective, the deposit insurance directive does not appear to result in overinsurance in the EU- 15, but there may be overinsurance in several of the new member states. deposit insurance; international coordination...|$|R

40|$|For a year {{following}} {{the launch of}} the euro, the European Central Bank (ECB) seemed indifferent to the currency’s depreciation. Then the ECB changed to a policy position of trying to bolster the external value of the <b>euro.</b> This <b>paper</b> seeks to explain these patterns of positions on the ECB’s external monetary policy. I argue that the ECB’s policy on the exchange rate is a function of its commitment to domes-tic price stability in the euro zone. In other words, the ECB’s concern with the euro’s exchange rate centers solely on what that exchange rate can do to inflation. This focus on price stability {{is a function of the}} interests of the ECB in main-taining its own image of competence in European society...|$|R

The split between the tradable and non-tradable sectors of the economy is highlighted. A small, calibrated model adapted from Barry (1997) is used in the paper. The equations in this paper are derived under less restrictive assumptions making the results more widely applicable. The parameters of the model can be changed easily to reflect the structure of the economy and to conduct scenario analyses. A practical application is provided using a specific calibration and set of assumptions and the sensitivity of the results to the calibrated parameters and assumptions is discussed. ...|$|R

Bearing in mind that the imminent enlargement of the EU will radically change the political economy of the EU's efforts to assure ‘cohesion’, policy issues are then discussed. Looking forward to the next renegotiation of the Structural Funds, it is argued that difficult decisions have to be taken about the extent and character of EU policy.

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{strategies}} {{announced by the}} ten countries joining the European Union in May 2004 {{with regard to their}} intentions for participation in ERM II and the adoption of the <b>euro.</b> The <b>paper</b> examines the economic rationale of the monetary integration strategies declared by most acceding countries with a view to identifying also their potential risks. It does so by making use of several different approaches, including a short review of nominal convergence and a more extensive discussion from an optimum currency area perspective. An important part of the analysis is devoted to the implications of real convergence – i. e. catching-up growth in income and adjustment of the real economic structures towards those prevailing in the euro area – on the patterns of economic dynamics in acceding countries. Other aspects covered are the risks for external competitiveness in the convergence process and the appropriate pace of fiscal consolidation. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the exchange rate}} policies in the three stages of the euro adoption process. In the first stage, i. e., after EU accession but before ERM II entry, the exchange rate becomes a matter of “common concern” according to the Treaty. The paper argues that in the modern conditions, this has no real meaning besides mutual consultations on macroeconomic policy issues. In the second stage, common concern becomes institutionalized under the ERM II mechanism. Its main advantages and risks are discussed, and the arguments for minimizing the length of this stage are presented. In the third step, the exchange rate stability criterion is assessed before the country is allowed to adopt the <b>euro.</b> The <b>paper</b> {{discusses the}} open issues {{in the interpretation of}} this criterion. Finally, {{the current state of the}} Czech euro adoption strategy is described. monetary integration, euro adoption, convergence criteria, ERM II...|$|R

40|$|Money {{is used as}} a {{store of}} value, a medium of {{exchange}} and a unit of account. Most recent analyses of currency choice in an international setting have focused on the denomination of reserves - the store of value role. However, public data are only aggregate and exclude several countries. This paper focuses on currency choice for the unit of account role, employing a detailed database on security issuance across countries, time and currencies. The paper finds a stable relation between currency choice and specific real and financial variables with different specifications for developed and developing countries, as well as evidence for persistence and network externalities. Exploiting the creation of the <b>Euro,</b> the <b>paper</b> finds a large and significant Euro liquidity effect at the cost of the dollar, especially {{in the early years of}} the life of the new currency.

40|$|Assuming the {{eventual}} {{adoption of the}} <b>Euro,</b> the <b>paper</b> reviews the run-up and the medium run issues and policy options on the path towards the Euro. In {{the run-up to the}} Euro, giving the markets a conversion rate to target is shown to be desirable. This can prevent an initial misalignment, and can take into account the expectation-driven increase in money demand and convergence in interest rates. In the medium run preparation, a fixed exchange rate brings high real interest rates and losses of output, unless fiscal policy is tight and wage settlements are market-based or kept under control. Floating exchange rates do not necessarily lower interest rates but enable monetary policy to regain some of its effectiveness. Eventually, a sound fiscal and income policy opens the way to a scenario of accommodating monetary policy and convergence towards the Euro. A political reading of the Maastricht conditions suggests that early adoption of the Euro is unlikely to be supported by the incumbents. It would then only make sense as a way out of a crisis...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The European Union project {{initially}} {{started as}} a peaceful solution for war reconstruction in Europe. European countries decided to cooperate rather than compete in an aggressive way. At the beginning, this project supposed (involved) market liberalization, trade barriers removals, market access improvement (initially for coal, steel, energy and, later, for all goods, services, workforce and capital). Unfortunately, in the last decades, all these Single Market facilities have been backed by redistributive schemes, protectionist mechanisms, social engineering, subsidies and facilities packed in so-called ”EU policies”. New ”European ” institutions have been created, more and more funds have been involved to financially support this very complex redistributive intervention. The political dimension of the European Union project enhanced the economic dimension and constantly suffocated private markets and the economy. The “incomes ” of the European Union that fuel its financial support are coming from taxes and/or inflation (better administered after {{the introduction of a}} Single Currency – the <b>Euro).</b> This <b>paper</b> will discuss the relevance of European Funds for economic development, especially for new members in this project...|$|R
40|$|In the {{comparative}} capitalism literature, the European Central Bank’s (ECB’s) ‘one-size-fits-none’ monetary policy {{plays a key}} role in the widening of trade imbalances in the euro area (EA) by being overly restrictive for the region’s coordinated market economies (CMEs) and overly expansionary for the region’s mixed market economies. According to this literature, diverging wage setting institutions mediated how the ECB’s monetary policy re-distributed resources between traded and non-traded sectors in these varieties of capitalism. By examining three separate transmission channels of the ECB’s monetary policies (wage and price setting in labor and product markets; capital costs; and the nominal exchange rate of the <b>euro),</b> this <b>paper</b> goes beyond the traditional emphasis on wage setting institutions and draws attention to those institutions that underpin the non-price competitiveness of traded sectors. Overall, the paper explains how the institutionally infrastructure of the CMEs bolstered the adaptability of their traded sectors to the ECB’s single monetary policy and its three transmission mechanisms – both during the pre-crisis era of widening imbalances and the period of asymmetrical trade rebalancing since the outbreak of the euro crisis...|$|R
