50|$|In general, {{energetics}} {{is concerned}} with defining relationships to describe the tendencies of energy <b>flows</b> and <b>storages</b> under transformation, defined here as phenomena which behave like historical invariants under repeated observations. When some critical {{number of people have}} observed such invariance, such a principle is usually then given the status of a 'fundamental law' of science. As in all scientific inquiry, whether a theorem or principle is considered a fundamental law appears to depend on how many people agree to the proposition. The ultimate aim of energetics therefore is the description of fundamental laws. Philosophers of science have held that the fundamental laws of thermodynamics can be treated as laws of energetics, (Reiser 1926, p. 432).

30|$|With {{respect to}} microstructure, {{we have shown}} that the {{porosity}} is very closely linked to crack surface area (Figure  8 D) and, thus, that increasing crack density corresponds to a sample with a higher permeability. The three samples that lie slightly outside the trend of the dataset display distinct mesofractures (black stars in Figure  11 E,F) and that these mesofractures greatly enhance the permeability of the samples without significantly increasing their porosity. These specimens show higher than average permeability for their porosity, which supports the conclusions of Stimac et al. ([2008]) that meso- and macrofractures are critical in controlling the permeability of geothermal reservoir systems. On the large scale, macrofractures are necessary for fluid production from geothermal reservoirs, but the microstructural characteristics of the host rocks cannot be neglected when considering fluid <b>flow,</b> <b>storage</b> capacity, and total permeability of the reservoir (Jafari and Babadagli [2011]).|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn {{this study}} we {{determined}} the microclimatic drivers of storage water use in Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) growing in a temperate climate. The storage water use was modeled using the ANAFORE model, integrating a dynamic water <b>flow</b> and ? <b>storage</b> model with a process-based transpiration model. The model was calibrated and validated with sap flow measurements for the growing season of 2000 (26 May? 18 October). Because there was no severe soil drought during the study period, {{we were able to}} study atmospheric effects. Incoming radiation was the main driver of storage water use. The general trends of sap <b>flow</b> and <b>storage</b> water use are similar, and follow more or less the pattern of incoming radiation. Nevertheless, considerable differences in the day-to-day pattern of sap <b>flow</b> and <b>storage</b> water use were observed, mainly driven by vapour pressure deficit (VPD). During dry atmospheric conditions (high VPD) storage water use was reduced. This reduction was disproportionally higher than the reduction in measured sap flow. Our results suggest that the trees did not rely more on storage water during periods of atmospheric drought, without severe soil drought. A third important factor was the tree water deficit. When storage compartments were depleted beyond a threshold, storage water use was limited due to the low water potential in the storage compartments. The maximum relative contribution of storage water to daily transpiration was also constrained by an increasing tree water deficit...|$|R

40|$|A major {{proportion}} of {{flow in the}} Indus River is contributed by its snow and glacier-fed river catchments situated in the Karakoram Range. It is therefore essential to estimate the snowmelt runoff from these catchments (with no or scarce precipitation records) for water resources management. The snowmelt runoff model (SRM) integrated with MODIS remote-sensing snow cover products was selected to simulate the daily discharges and to study the climate change impact on these discharges in the Hunza River basin (the snow- and glacier-fed sub-catchment of the Indus River). The results obtained suggest that the SRM can be used efficiently in the snow- and glacier-fed sub-catchments of the Upper Indus River Basin (UIB).
