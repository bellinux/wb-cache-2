Norwegians did not <b>favor</b> <b>the</b> letter N (for Norge) more than people from other countries did, neither did the Hungarians <b>favor</b> <b>the</b> letter M (for Magyarország). This led Nuttin to conclude that individual ownership has affective consequences that are not observed for collective ownership.|$|E

During this time Pilecki’s group was itself infiltrated by , a former TAP member and double agent for Poland's Stalinist government.|$|E
5|$|Annual {{variations}} in climatic temperatures can affect sex ratios, since loggerheads have temperature-dependent sex determination. High sand temperatures may skew gender ratios {{in favor of}} females. Nesting sites exposed to unseasonably warm temperatures {{over a three-year period}} produced 87–99% females. This raises concern over the connection between rapid global temperature changes and the possibility of population extinction. A more localized effect on gender skewing comes from the construction of tall buildings, which reduce sun exposure, lowering the average sand temperature, which results in a shift in gender ratios to <b>favor</b> <b>the</b> emergence of male turtles.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of heavy {{immigration}} from New England and New York—regions where most major towns had originated as trading centers rather than political or manufacturing centers—many new settlements in Minnesota were laid out so as to heavily <b>favor</b> <b>the</b> business districts rather than the city halls or courthouses.

5|$|Being {{the most}} {{abundant}} carnivores, feral and free-ranging dogs have the greatest potential to compete with wolves. A review of the studies in the competitive effects of dogs on sympatric carnivores did not mention any research on competition between dogs and wolves. Competition would <b>favor</b> <b>the</b> wolf, which is known to kill dogs, however wolves tend to live in pairs or in small packs in areas where they are highly persecuted, giving them a disadvantage facing large groups of dogs.|$|E
5|$|In 1913, a huge {{general strike}} took place {{across the country}} at the {{instigation}} of the Belgian Workers' Party on the issue of voting rights. The system of plural voting, in force since 1893, was extremely unpopular because of its perceived unfairness, but also because the system tended to <b>favor</b> <b>the</b> Catholic Party. Although between 300,000 and 450,000 workers were involved, the strike was ultimately unsuccessful. The party voted in favor ending the strike and taking future action by parliamentary means, on 22 April 1913.|$|E

5|$|In May 1970, the Spanish {{government}} decided {{to sign a}} contract with the French company GIAT to begin production of the AMX-30. However, it was not the advantages of the French vehicle itself that influenced the decision.

5|$|On 25 July 2007, the BBVA Foundation {{published}} {{their report}} Social portrait of Spanish people, which reported that 60% of Spain's population support same-sex marriage.
