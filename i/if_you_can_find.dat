The best groove {{so far this}} year is from Scotland and it shows London and New York exactly how it should be done, a one-sided, one-track 12inch (it doesn't need any dub or instrumentals). 'All You Need Is Love' by The Jamms is more than rife with a bit of The Beatles (with a dash of MC5 and Samantha Fox). It seems to be anti-AIDS, but as I know nothing about the band it could easily be a piss take. Either way this is a superb jam, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>find</b> it, buy it (it's so dodgily constructed in legal terms that no distributor info is given)." ...|$|E

Scott of The New York Times said, in his review of The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie, that Squidward {{is one of his}} favorite secondary characters on the show, along with Sandy Cheeks and Mrs. Puff. He wrote, [...] "I was sorry to see [...] pushed to the margins". Also from the same publication, television critic Joyce Millman said that Squidward has [...] "the nasal bitchiness of Paul Lynde and the artistic pretensions of Felix Unger." [...] Millman further wrote, [...] "Hmmm, Squidward is one gay squid, I think." ...|$|E

[...] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle enjoyed the film, asking his readers [...] "... <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>find</b> a better time at the movies this year than this wild comic thriller, let me in on it." [...] Boston Globe reviewer Ty Burr reacted to Samuel L. Jackson's performance by saying he [...] "... bestrides this film with the authority of someone who knows the value of honest bilge. He's as much the auteur of this baby as the director and screenwriters, and that fierce glimmer in his eye is partly joy." ...|$|E

[...] IGN gave the game a 9.1 out of 10, as being [...] "beautiful, charismatic, engaging and one of the most original games you'll play anytime soon." [...] Electronic Gaming Monthly's three reviewers gave it a 9, 9.5, and 9 out of ten, one saying: [...] "I'll be surprised <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>find</b> a better game on any system this fall." [...] Newtype USA named Ōkami its Game of the Month for October 2006, heralded the pacing as [...] "nearly flawless" [...] and proclaimed [...] "Ōkami is that rarest of beasts: a game without any obvious flaws. Clover's creativity and attention to detail are on full display here. Shame on any gamer who passes up this divine adventure." [...] Eurogamer scored the game 10/10 saying [...] "Right from the start it conjures an atmosphere of being something special, but to keep that level of quality up consistently over 60 hours ensures that this will be a game that will be talked about for years to come". In 2007, Ōkami was named eighteenth best PlayStation 2 game of all time in IGN's feature reflecting on the PlayStation 2's long lifespan. Famitsu gave the game a near perfect score of 39 out of 40, the 15th game to date to receive this score from the publication.|$|E

2500|$|Non video-game {{publications}} {{praised the}} quality of the game as well. CiN Weekly gave it a score of 92 out of 100 and stated that [...] "The improved single-player games are worthwhile enough on their own, but <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>find</b> well connected online matches, multiplayer games will keep you addicted for months." [...] The Sydney Morning Herald gave it a score of four stars out of five, saying, [...] "Space conflict complements ground-based action beautifully and jumping into the cockpit of an X-wing or TIE fighter is thrilling." [...] Detroit Free Press gave the Xbox version a score of three stars out of four and said that [...] "The graphics are pretty, the score divine, the story-driven single-player game is actually cinematic and engaging and the lag, while annoying at times online, has been greatly reduced from the original." ...|$|E

2500|$|Reading Abraham's request in [...] "What if ten {{shall be}} found there?" [...] a Midrash asked, why ten (and not fewer)? The Midrash answered, {{so that there}} might be enough for a minyan of righteous people to pray on behalf of all of the people of Sodom. Alternatively, the Midrash said, because at the {{generation}} of the Flood, eight righteous people remained (in Noah and his family) and God did not give the world respite for their sake. Alternatively, the Midrash said, because Lot thought that there were ten righteous people in Sodom — namely Lot, his wife, his four daughters, and his four sons-in-law (but Lot was apparently mistaken in thinking them righteous). Rabbi Judah the son of Rabbi Simon and Rabbi Hanin in Rabbi Johanan's name said that ten were required for Sodom, but for Jerusalem even one would have sufficed, as [...] says, [...] "Run to and fro in the streets of Jerusalem... and seek... <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>find</b> a man, if there be any who does justly... and I will pardon her."

5000|$|Though the Marine Corps {{continued}} its tradition of intimate air-ground {{cooperation in the}} Korean War, the newly created United States Air Force (USAF) again moved away from CAS, now to strategic bombers and jet interceptors. Though eventually the Air Force supplied sufficient pilots and forward air controllers to provide battlefield support, coordination was still lacking. Since pilots operated under centralized control, ground controllers {{were never able to}} familiarize themselves with pilots, and requests were not processed quickly. Harold K.
