In 2009, he played to three sold-out concerts at the newly built Citi Field—a venue constructed to replace Shea Stadium in Queens, New York.

This show toured Australia in 1972 before transferring to New York City in 1973, re-titled as <b>Good</b> <b>Evening.</b> Cook frequently appeared {{on and off}} stage the worse for drink. Nonetheless, the show proved very popular and it won Tony and Grammy Awards. When it finished, Moore stayed in the United States to pursue his film acting ambitions in Hollywood. Cook returned to Britain and in 1973 married the actress and model Judy Huxtable.|$|E

25|$|In the past, WFAA {{has also}} chosen to {{pre-empt}} certain ABC programs because of content deemed inappropriate by station management, {{in some cases}} due to concerns over possible FCC-imposed fines. Under the stewardship of general manager Mike Shapiro during the 1960s and 1970s, WFAA pre-empted certain theatrical and made-for-television films aired by ABC which management deemed too risque for broadcast. WFAA was the largest ABC affiliate to pre-empt NYPD Blue (which had its first two seasons air on independent station-turned-UPN affiliate KTXA instead) due to concerns over its violent content, and occasional strong profanity and partial nudity. Channel 8 substituted the police procedural in its Tuesday night timeslot with alternate programming, before launching <b>Good</b> <b>Evening</b> Texas—a weekly talk show serving {{as an extension of}} Good Morning Texas—in September 1994; WFAA began clearing NYPD Blue at the start of its third season in September 1995. It was also among the more than 20 ABC-affiliated stations that declined to air the network's telecast of Saving Private Ryan in November 2004, due to concerns over possible fines over the intense war violence and strong profanity in the film that ABC opted against editing out of the broadcast amid the FCC's crackdown on indecent material following the wardrobe malfunction incident that occurred during Justin Timberlake and Janet Jackson's Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show performance that February; the FCC declared the film's telecast as not being in violation of the agency's broadcast decency regulations after it aired.|$|E
500|$|Truman {{continues}} to sail until – {{to his surprise}} – his boat punctures {{the wall of the}} dome. He finds an exit door, but Christof, speaking directly to Truman through a speaker system, tries to convince him to stay, stating there is [...] "no more truth" [...] in the real world and [...] "I know you better than you know yourself", that he brings comfort to his audience and that by staying in his artificial world, he would have nothing to fear. Truman considers this, then states: [...] "You never had a camera in my head!" [...] and [...] "In case I don't see you... good afternoon, <b>good</b> <b>evening,</b> and good night," [...] previously his unwitting catch-phrase, takes a bow, and leaves. Watching the show at home, Sylvia races to meet Truman, while Christof's supervisors end the show for the last time and the audience starts looking for something else to watch.|$|E
500|$|In honour of Harrison's {{fondness for}} the instrument, Paul McCartney played a ukulele {{rendition}} of [...] "Something" [...] throughout his 2002–03 world tour and included the track on his Back in the U.S. live album. At the Concert for George, held at London's Royal Albert Hall on 29 November 2002, he and Eric Clapton performed a version {{that begins with}} McCartney alone, on ukulele, and then reverts to the familiar, rock arrangement, with Clapton taking over as lead singer and backing from Starr, Preston and others. Following its appearance in David Leland's film Concert for George (2003) and on the accompanying live album, this performance of [...] "Something" [...] was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals. Bob Dylan also played the song live during his November 2002 concerts, {{as a tribute to}} Harrison. McCartney has continued to perform [...] "Something", adopting the Concert for George mix of ukulele and rock backing; a version with this musical arrangement was included on his 2009 album <b>Good</b> <b>Evening</b> New York City.|$|E

500|$|Full albums {{were also}} made {{available}} as downloadable content; the remaining songs from Abbey Road, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, and Rubber Soul {{have since been}} released on the consoles' respective store services. While there is potential for the entire Beatles catalogue to be made available, this will be unlikely, according to John Drake of Harmonix. Drake identified the costly development process as a potentially prohibitive factor: [...] "Every time we do one song, it's not like Rock Band where {{we wait for the}} masters to come in and just author them... its like, send people to Abbey Road, use the original tape, separate them out... it costs thousands of dollars." [...] Drake asserted that Harmonix would take sales of the currently announced albums into consideration before continuing development of downloadable content. Harmonix's Foster stated that solo acts from the Beatles' members will not be included as downloadable content for The Beatles: Rock Band; however, he did not rule out the possibility of these acts appearing in other Rock Band games. A three pack of songs from Paul McCartney's 2009 live album, <b>Good</b> <b>Evening</b> New York City, was made available for the main Rock Band series on 5 January 2010. John Lennon's [...] "Imagine" [...] {{is a part of the}} Rock Band 3 soundtrack, with the full Imagine album arriving later as downloadable content in celebration of Lennon's 70th birthday. A pack featuring Paul McCartney's band Wings was also released as DLC for Rock Band 3 on 28 December 2010.|$|E

2500|$|As the bedraggled George recounts his story, {{his friends}} are again skeptical.

2500|$|Later, {{the more}} risqué humour of Pete and Dud went farther on long-playing records as [...] "Derek and Clive". The first {{recording}} was initiated by Cook to alleviate boredom during the Broadway run of <b>Good</b> <b>Evening</b> and used material conceived years before {{for the two}} characters but considered too outrageous. One of these audio recordings was also filmed and tensions between the duo are seen to rise. Chris Blackwell circulated bootleg copies to friends in the music business. The popularity of the recording convinced Cook to release it commercially, although Moore was initially reluctant, fearing that his rising fame as a Hollywood star would be undermined. Two further Derek and Clive albums were released, the last accompanied by a film.|$|E
2500|$|Since 2004 McCartney has {{performed}} the song with his band on every tour, starting on 24 May 2004, {{while on the}} '04 Summer Tour, through The 'US' Tour (2005), the Summer Live '09 (2009), the <b>Good</b> <b>Evening</b> Europe Tour (2009), the Up and Coming Tour (2010/2011), the On the Run Tour (2011/2012) and the Out There Tour, which started on 4 May 2013. In the last tours, the song has been generally inserted on the third encore, which {{is the last time}} the band enters the stage. It is usually the last but one song, performed after [...] "Yesterday" [...] and before the final medley including [...] "The End". Paul played the song on his One on One Tour at Fenway Park on 17 July, 2016 accompanied by the Grateful Dead's Bob Weir and New England Patriots football player Rob Gronkowski.|$|E
2500|$|George bids {{his guests}} a <b>good</b> <b>evening,</b> then heads downstairs where his {{full-size}} time machine awaits. He presses a lever and moves forward through time 17 {{years into the}} future to the year 1917. He meets Filby's son, James, who tells him of Filby's death in the Great War. Saddened, he resumes his journey, stopping in 1940 during The Blitz, finding himself in the midst of [...] "a new war"; George resumes his journey and stops in 1966, finding his neighbourhood now part of a futuristic metropolis. People are hurrying into a nearby fallout shelter amid the blare of air raid sirens. An elderly James Filby urges George to immediately take cover. Moments later, a nuclear explosion causes a sudden volcanic eruption around him. George narrowly makes it back to his machine and continues his journey forward as the lava rapidly cools and hardens, trapping him inside. He travels much farther into the future until the rock eventually erodes away, revealing a lush, green, unspoiled landscape.|$|E
