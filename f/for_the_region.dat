5|$|Cyclone Alibera was {{the second}} longest-lasting {{tropical}} cyclone on record in the south-west Indian Ocean, {{with a duration of}} 22days. It formed on December16, 1989, well to the northeast of Madagascar. For several days, it meandered southwestward while gradually intensifying. On December20, Alibera intensified to tropical cyclone status with 10‑minute maximum sustained winds of 120km/h (75mph), or the equivalent of a minimal hurricane. That day, the Météo-France office in Réunion (MFR) estimated 10‑minute winds of 140km/h (85mph), while the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC), an unofficial warning agency <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>region,</b> estimated peak 1‑minute winds of 250km/h (150mph). After drifting erratically for several days, the storm began a steady southwest motion on December29 as a greatly weakened system. On January1, Alibera struck southeastern Madagascar near Mananjary, having re-intensified to just below tropical cyclone status. It weakened over land but again restrengthened upon reaching open waters on January3. The storm turned to the southeast, then to the southwest, and finally back to the southeast, dissipating on January5.|$|E
