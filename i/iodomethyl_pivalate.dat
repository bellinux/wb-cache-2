40|$|Available online 27 November 2014 A {{reaction}} of N-tosyl cycloalkanecarbaldimines with <b>iodomethyl</b> <b>pivalate</b> was initiated by triethylborane to give pivaloyloxymethylated products bearing 3 -iodocycloalkyl groups. Radical addition of pivaloyloxymethyl to imines generates aminyl radicals, which then regioselectively cleave Csingle bondH bonds at the 3 -position of the cycloalkane moieties. The resulting carbon-centered radicals are trapped with iodine. DFT calculations rationalized stereo- and regioselectivity...|$|E
