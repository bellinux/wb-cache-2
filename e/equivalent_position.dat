5|$|Poyntz {{was born}} on 27 October 1883 in Chelmsford, Essex. He was the {{youngest}} of seven children born to Major William Henry Poyntz and Henrietta Laycock. His father had achieved the rank of Major in the Royal Marines, and having served as the Chief Constable of Nottingham from 1872 until 1881, held the <b>equivalent</b> <b>position</b> in Essex {{at the time of his}} youngest son's birth. Poyntz senior was a cricket enthusiast, and during his time in Nottingham, he ran the police team, and wrote effusively in his reminiscences about watching Nottinghamshire face Yorkshire and Surrey. Educated at Haileybury College, Massey made the school's cricket team in 1901. The family had moved to Gotham House in Tiverton, north Devon, and after leaving school, Poyntz followed his older brother Hugh into the Somerset side.|$|E

25|$|In the United States, {{the overall}} manager or chief {{executive}} of the newspaper is the publisher. In small newspapers, the owner of the publication (or the largest shareholder in the corporation that owns the publication) is usually the publisher. Although he or she rarely or perhaps never writes stories, the publisher is legally responsible for the contents of the entire newspaper and also runs the business, including hiring editors, reporters, and other staff members. This title is less common outside the U.S. The <b>equivalent</b> <b>position</b> in the film industry and television news shows is the executive producer. Most newspapers have four main departments devoted to publishing the newspaper itself—editorial, production/printing, circulation, and advertising, although they are frequently referred to by a variety of other names—as well as the non-newspaper-specific departments also found in other businesses of comparable size, such as accounting, marketing, human resources, and IT.|$|E

The state governors continue to serve as the direct representatives of the Queen, in no way subordinate to the Governor-General, and they carry out on her behalf all of the Queen's constitutional and ceremonial duties in respect of their respective state. The Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory resemble states in many respects, but are administered directly by the Commonwealth of Australia; an administrator, appointed by the Governor-General upon the advice of the Commonwealth government, takes the place of a state governor in the Northern Territory.

2500|$|Long {{baseline}} systems {{get their}} {{name from the}} fact that the spacing of the baseline transponders is long or similar to the distance between the diver or vehicle and the transponders. [...] That is, the baseline transponders are typically mounted in the corners of an underwater work site within which the vehicle or diver operates. This method yields an ideal geometry for positioning, in which any given error in acoustic range measurements produce only about an <b>equivalent</b> <b>position</b> error. [...] This compares to SBL and USBL systems with shorter baselines where ranging disturbances of a given amount can result in much larger position errors. Further, the mounting of the baseline transponders on the sea floor eliminates the need for converting between reference frames, as is the case for USBL or SBL positioning systems mounted on moving vessels. Finally, sea floor mounting makes the positioning accuracy independent of water depth. [...] For these reasons LBL systems are generally applied to tasks where the required standard of positioning accuracy or reliability exceeds the capabilities of USBL and SBL systems.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, Walter Begley and Bertram G. Theobald claimed that Elizabethan satirists Joseph Hall and John Marston alluded to Francis Bacon {{as the true}} author of Venus and Adonis and The Rape of Lucrece by using the sobriquet [...] "Labeo" [...] {{in a series of}} poems {{published}} in 1597-8. They take this to be a coded reference to Bacon {{on the grounds that the}} name derives from Rome's most famous legal scholar, Marcus Labeo, with Bacon holding an <b>equivalent</b> <b>position</b> in Elizabethan England. Hall denigrates several poems by Labeo and states that he passes off criticism to [...] "shift it to another's name". This is taken to imply that he published under a pseudonym. In the following year Marston used Bacon's Latin motto in a poem and seems to quote from Venus and Adonis, which he attributes to Labeo. Theobald argued that this confirmed that Hall's Labeo was known to be Bacon and that he wrote Venus and Adonis. Critics of this view argue that the name Labeo derives from Attius Labeo, a notoriously bad Roman poet, and that Hall's Labeo could refer to one of many poets of the time, or even be a composite figure, standing for the triumph of bad verse. Also, Marston's use of the Latin motto is a different poem from the one which alludes to Venus and Adonis. Only the latter uses the name Labeo, so there is no link between Labeo and Bacon.|$|E

60|$|Section 37. But as {{certainly}} {{as we have}} no such metameric segmentation, as this older view implies, in the brain-case of the frog, so quite as certainly is metameric segmentation evident in its branchial arches. We have the four gill slits of the tadpole and their bars repeating one another; the hyoid bar in front of these is evidently of a similar nature; and that the ear drum is derived from an imperforate gill slit is enforced {{by the presence of}} an open slit (the spiracle) in the rays and dog-fish in an entirely <b>equivalent</b> <b>position.</b> Does the mouth answer to a further pair of gill slits, and is the jaw arch (palato-pterygoid + Meckel's cartilage) equivalent to the arches that come behind it? This question has been asked, and answered in the affirmative, by many morphologists, but not by any means by all. The cranial nerves have a curious similarity of arrangement with regard to the gill slits and the mouth; the fifth nerve forks over the mouth, the seventh forks over the ear drum, the ninth, in the tadpole and fish, forks over the first branchial slit, and the tenth is, as it were, a leash of nerves, each forking over one of the remaining gill slits. But this matter will be more intelligible when the student has worked over a fish type, and need not detain us any further now.|$|E
