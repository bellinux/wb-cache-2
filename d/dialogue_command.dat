40|$|International audienceFlexible and {{reactive}} {{control of}} interaction between humans and robots will allow a closer cooperation in all service and industrial tasks, that require the adaptability skills of humans to be merged with the high performance of robots in terms of precision, speed and payload [2]. For this reason, recent research strives for intuitive human-robot cooperation, avoiding explicit clarification <b>dialogue</b> and <b>commands.</b> We believe that sensor-based methods, such as visual servoing, provide better solutions, for intuitive HRI, than planning techniques requiring a priori models {{of the environment and}} agents. To our knowledge, few works [2 - 4] have explicitly dealt with HRI using sensor-based control approaches. Our objective is similar: we aim at enabling intuitive interaction between human and robot, {{in the context of an}} industrial scenario, where the two must collaborate to realize a task. The robot must be able to infer the human intentions during the task, using only sensed data. The objective of this work is to enable a robot to aid a human operator in a screwing operation...|$|R
5000|$|Another kind of TUI was {{the primary}} {{interface}} of the Oberon operating system as released in 1988. In contrast to the so far mentioned uses of text user interfaces, the Oberon system did not use a console or terminal based mode but required a large bit-mapped display on which text was used as primary target for mouse clicks. Commands of the form Module.Procedure parameters ~ were activated by a middle-mouse click on Module.Procedure. Any text displayed on the screen could be edited and every command displayed in a text, which complied to the required syntax, could be clicked and executed. Any text {{with a bunch of}} commands {{could be used as a}} so-called tool text serving as a user-configurable menu. Even the output of a previous command could be edited and used as a command. This approach is radically different from the <b>dialogue</b> oriented <b>command</b> prompt and console menus described so far. Since it did not use graphical elements, but text elements, it was termed a text user interface. For a short introduction see the 2nd paragraph on p.4 of the first published report on the Oberon System.|$|R

40|$|International audienceAn unified {{language}} for the communicative acts between agents {{is essential for}} the design of multi-agents architectures. Whatever the type of interaction (linguistic, multimodal, including particular aspects such as force feedback), whatever the type of application (<b>command</b> <b>dialogue,</b> request dialogue, database querying), the concepts are common and we need a generic meta-model. In order to tend towards task-independent systems, we need to clarify the modules parameterization procedures. In this paper, we focus on the characteristics of a meta-model designed to represent meaning in linguistic and multimodal applications. This meta-model is called MMIL for MultiModal Interface Language, and has first been specified in the framework of the IST MIAMM European project. What we want to test here is how relevant is MMIL for a completely different context (a different task, a different interaction type, a different linguistic domain). We detail the exploitation of MMIL in the framework of the IST OZONE European project, and we draw the conclusions on the role of MMIL in the parameterization of task-independent dialogue managers...|$|R

However, when developing such an interface, one has to remember that just like other systems, spoken interfaces require a proper design, implying an adequate analysis of the user's needs throughout the dialogue. The VODIS project {{has led to the}} design and development of a spoken interface for the control of car equipment. Due to the workload caused by the task of driving the vehicle, spoken communication provides a potentially safe and efficient mode of controlling the car equipment. Here we report the main characteristics of the central module of the system, the Dialogue Manager, designed and implemented by IPO, which comprises the necessary components aimed at achieving the goal of a robust and efficient dialogue system. We mainly concentrate on two important activities carried out in the project: the integration of the various modules into a task model taking into account the characteristics of a spoken <b>command</b> <b>dialogue,</b> and the necessity of customizing parts of the system to spoken communication...|$|R

40|$|In this study, {{the author}} {{argues that the}} {{solvation}} of the Korean Questions is a core condition of {{the establishment of a}} peace-framework in East Asia. The authors main thesis is about multilateral security and the dramatic developments on the Korean peninsula as two non-divorcable issues. A theoretical implication of the study is found in the neo-institutionalism which is extended by elements of the interdependence-analysis and other constructions in modern social science. The author relates this argumentation with the evaluation of the theoretical discurs of the causes and implications of the European peace process. The close look on the possibilities of a structural transformation includes issues like the Asian identity, unsolved territorial conflicts and the lack of linkage between political elites and many societies in the region. A unique discussion links questions of historical burdens with todays conflicts within the divorced Korean society and lines of confrontation on and around the peninsula. A central element is the precise analysis of the ideological questions and limitations of the inner-Korean <b>dialogue,</b> structures of <b>command,</b> the strong political and military dependencies and the race of arms in the region.

40|$|The {{issue of}} how users can {{navigate}} their way through large information spaces {{is one that is}} crucial to the ever expanding and interlinking of computer systems. There are many ways of dealing with the issue of navigation one of which is to provide different dialogue styles to suit individual capabilities. The performance of users was compared on a menu style interface to a database system, which minimised navigation and constrained the <b>dialogue,</b> and a <b>command</b> style interface, which allowed an open and flexible dialogue. The results showed that some users did perform better on the interface which minimised navigational issues, and some better on the more open interface; and that users' performance related to their levels of spatial ability and experience with using command style interfaces. The menu interface proved suitable for users with both a low spatial ability and low experience of using command style interfaces. The command interface proved suitable for all users with a high spatial ability, whatever their previous experience, and for users with a low spatial ability but high experience of using command style interfaces. The results of this small scale experiment have potentially important ramifications for designers of interfaces to large information spaces...|$|R

5000|$|The simuland for {{adaptive}} collaborative control {{centers on}} robotics. As such, adaptive collaborative control follows {{the tenets of}} control theory applied to robotics at its basest level. That means {{the states of the}} robot are observed at a given instant and noted if it is within some accepted bound. If it is not, the estimated states of the robot are calculated using equations of dynamics and kinematics at some future time. The process of entering observation data into the model to generate initial conditions is called initialization. The process of initialization for adaptive collaborative control occurs differently depending on the environment: robotics only and human-robotic interaction. [...] Under a robotics only environment, initialization occurs very similarly to the description above. The robotics, systems, subsystems, non-human entities observe some state it finds not in accordance with the higher-level strategy. The entities that are aware of this error use the appropriate equations to present a revised value for a future time step to its peers. For human-robotic interactions, initialization can occur at two different levels. The first level is what was previously described. In this instance, the robot notices some anomaly in its states that is not wholly consistent or is problematic with its higher-level strategy. It queries the human seeking advice to regulate its dilemma. In the other case, the human feels cause to either query some aspect of the robot’s state (e.g. health, trajectory, speed) [...] or present advice to the robot that is challenged against the robot's existing tactical approach to the higher-level strategy. The main inputs for adaptive collaborative control are a human-initiated <b>dialogue</b> based <b>command</b> or value presented by either a human or robotic element. The inputs used in the system models serve as the starting point for the collaboration.A number of ways are available to gather observational data for use in functional models. The easiest method to gather observational data is simple human observation of the robotic system. Self-monitoring attributes such as built-in test (BIT) can provide regular reports on important system characteristics. A common approach to gather observations is to employ sensors throughout the robotic system. Vehicles operating in teleoperations have speedometers to indicate how fast they travel. Robotic systems with either stochastic or cyclic motion often employ accelerometers to note the forces exerted. GPS sensors provide a standardized data type that is used nearly universally for depicting location. Multi-sensor systems have been used to gather heterogeneous observational data for applications in path planning.|$|R

English Department: Faculty of Letters and Fine Arts. Sebelas Maret University. This {{research}} was conducted to describe the types of strategies employed by {{the characters in the}} film “The Ghost Writer” for issuing indirect commands, the factors influencing the use of strategies and the responses given by the hearers. The research used pragmatic approach with the indirect commands as the scope of the analysis. This {{research was}} a descriptive qualitative research with purposive sampling technique. The <b>dialogues</b> containing indirect <b>command</b> were taken as the data. There were 20 data representing the criteria. The data were analyzed with Brown and Levinson’s theory of politeness. Holmes’ theory of social dimension, Hymes’ ethnography and Fishman’s domain were also used in the analysis. From the analysis, the researcher finds the following results: First, there are three politeness strategies employed by the characters in film “The Ghost Writer” for issuing indirect commands. They are negative politeness, positive politeness and off record. Second, some factors influence the use of the strategies. Those factors are the social status between the speaker and the hearer, the domain of the conversation, degree of imposition and the situation when the conversation happens. Third, {{there are two kinds of}} responses given by the hearers to the indirect commands, compliance and refusal. However, most of the indirect commands are responded by compliance. It is expected that this research can be a reference for other researchers. They may focus on the form of indirect commands. Analyzing another indirect act by using the same approach is also possible...|$|R

Furthermore, the story of Mary concretizes soteriological, anthropological, and ecclesiological doctrines. All of these factors point toward her relevance to many aspects of ecumenical dialogue.

It is time to move forward. Certain trends within Protestant circles and the progress made by Marian dialogues in recent decades indicate that Christians have now come to a point in history when ecumenists may step beyond a mindset that seeks to overcome Marian 2 ̆ 2 obstacles 2 ̆ 2 to investigate the many ways in which mariological reflection might benefit dialogues focusing on 2 ̆ 2 extra-Marian 2 ̆ 2 topics.
