5|$|Since the 17th century, peat {{has been}} cut for fuel for {{domestic}} heating and cooking and it is called turf when so used. The process accelerated as commercial exploitation of bogs grew. In the 1940s, machines for cutting turf were introduced and larger-scale exploitation became possible. In the Republic, this became the responsibility of a semi-state company called Bord na Móna. In addition to domestic uses, commercially extracted turf is used {{in a number of}} industries, especially <b>electricity</b> <b>generation</b> though peat is being combined with biomass for dual-firing <b>electricity</b> <b>generation.</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} Turkey's net <b>electricity</b> energy <b>generation</b> {{and demand}} based on economic indicators. Forecasting model for <b>electricity</b> energy <b>generation</b> and demand is first {{proposed by the}} ant colony optimization (ACO) approach. It is multi-agent {{system in which the}} behavior of each ant is inspired by the foraging behavior of real ants to solve optimization problem. Ant colony optimization electricity energy estimation (ACOEEE) model is developed using population, gross domestic product (GDP), import and export. All equations proposed here are linear <b>electricity</b> energy <b>generation</b> and demand (linear_ACOEEGE and linear ACOEEDE) and quadratic energy generation and demand (quadratic_ACOEEGE and quadratic ACOEEDE). Quadratic models for both generation and demand provided better fit solution due to the fluctuations of the economic indicators.

40|$|The <b>electricity</b> <b>generations</b> of photo voltaic (PV) {{panels are}} {{strongly}} related with insolation and temperature. The insolation and temperature are not stable, since the <b>electricity</b> <b>generations</b> of the PV panels are not stable. In PV systems, insolation and temperature continuous vary. Therefore, the {{maximum power point}} tracking (MPPT) techniques are used to give the highest power to the loads/batteries. The MPPT process is performed with a power electronic circuit and it overcomes the problem of voltage mismatch between the PV panels and the batteries/loads. In this study, a microcontroller is employed to develop battery charge control system for PV panels. The system is composed of a microcontroller (Microchip PIC 18 F 2550), a buck-boost type DC-DC converter, a resistive load, and lead acid battery. In the system, MPPT, charge control, and discharge algorithms are executed by a program embedded within the microcontroller. The program also has ability to perform some data acquisition process and acquired data are sent to the personal computer (PC) through the USB communication port. In addition the system has able to be followed and controlled by the graphical user interface (GUI) ...|$|R

5|$|A {{geothermal}} heat pump can extract enough heat from shallow ground {{anywhere in the}} world to provide home heating, but industrial applications need the higher temperatures of deep resources. The thermal efficiency and profitability of <b>electricity</b> <b>generation</b> is particularly sensitive to temperature. The most demanding applications receive the greatest benefit from a high natural heat flux, ideally from using a hot spring. The next best option is to drill a well into a hot aquifer. If no adequate aquifer is available, an artificial one may be built by injecting water to hydraulically fracture the bedrock. This last approach is called hot dry rock geothermal energy in Europe, or enhanced geothermal systems in North America. Much greater potential may be available from this approach than from conventional tapping of natural aquifers.|$|E
