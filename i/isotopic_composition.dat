40|$|This {{study was}} based on the {{analysis}} of <b>isotopic</b> <b>compositions</b> of hydrogen and oxygen in samples from precipitation, groundwater and stream water. In addition, parts of groundwater samples were dated by carbon- 14 and tritium. These data are integrated to provide other views of the hydrologic cycle in the Hsinchu-Miaoli groundwater district. The groundwater district is principally composed of Pleistocene and Holocene aquifers. The Pleistocene aquifers are highly deformed by folding and faults into small sub-districts with areas of only tens of square kilometers. These aquifers are exclusively recharged by local precipitation. The Holocene aquifers cover narrow creek valleys, only tens of meters in thickness. The local meteoric water line (LMWL), constructed from rainfall samples in the Hsinchu Science Park, is described by the equation delta D= 8. 02 delta O- 18 + 10. 16, which agrees with the global meteoric water line. In addition, the precipitation <b>isotopic</b> <b>compositions</b> can be categorized into two distinct end members: typhoon type and monsoon type. The groundwater <b>isotopic</b> <b>compositions</b> are perfectly located on an LMWL and can be considered a mixture of precipitations. Based on the mass balance of <b>isotopic</b> <b>compositions</b> of oxygen and hydrogen, infiltration is more active in the rainy season with depleted <b>isotopic</b> <b>compositions.</b> The amount of infiltration during May-September is roughly estimated to comprise at least 55 % of the whole year's recharge. The <b>isotopic</b> <b>compositions</b> of stream water are expressed by a regression equation: delta D= 7. 61 delta O- 18 + 9. 62, which is similar to the LMWL. Although precipitation <b>isotopic</b> <b>compositions</b> are depleted during summer time, the <b>isotopic</b> <b>compositions</b> contrarily show an enriched trend in the upstream area. This is explained by the opposite altitude effect on <b>isotopic</b> <b>compositions</b> for typhoon-related precipitations...|$|R

The development in the early nineties of a new instrument (amass spectrometer with an ICP source) capable of measuring Hf <b>isotopic</b> <b>compositions</b> on ng quantities of Hf opened up new perspectives and led us to measure MORB samples from the three major ocean basins, the Atlantic, the Pacific, and the Indian Oceans.

5|$|All but two {{elements}} up to bismuth (element 83) have an isotope that is practically stable for all purposes ("classically stable"), with the exceptions being technetium and promethium (elements 43 and 61). All elements from polonium (element 84) onward are measurably radioactive. 232Th {{is one of}} the three nuclides beyond bismuth (the other two being 235U and 238U) that have half-lives measured in billions of years; its half-life is 14.05billionyears, about three times the age of the earth, and slightly longer than the age of the universe. Four-fifths of the thorium present at Earth's formation has survived to the present. 232Th is the only isotope of thorium occurring in quantity in nature, and thorium is usually considered to be a mononuclidic element. Its stability is attributed to its closed nuclear shell with 142 neutrons. Thorium has a characteristic terrestrial <b>isotopic</b> <b>composition,</b> with atomic weight 232.0377(4).

5|$|Manganese {{is part of}} {{the iron}} group of elements, which are thought to be {{synthesized}} in large stars shortly before the supernova explosion. 53Mn decays to 53Cr with a half-life of 3.7 million years. Because of its relatively short half-life, 53Mn is relatively rare, produced by cosmic rays impact on iron. Manganese isotopic contents are typically combined with chromium isotopic contents and have found application in isotope geology and radiometric dating. Mn–Cr isotopic ratios reinforce the evidence from 26Al and 107Pd for the early history of the solar system. Variations in 53Cr/52Cr and Mn/Cr ratios from several meteorites suggest an initial 53Mn/55Mn ratio, which indicates that Mn–Cr <b>isotopic</b> <b>composition</b> must result from in situ decay of 53Mn in differentiated planetary bodies. Hence, 53Mn provides additional evidence for nucleosynthetic processes immediately before coalescence of the solar system.|$|E
5|$|This {{model has}} Siletzia forming on the {{continental}} margin along {{what is now}} the Olympic-Wallowa Lineament (OWL; a zone of topographical features of unknown age and tectonic significance), with the southern end of Siletzia and the Klamath Mountains (joined to Siletzia) near the Idaho Batholith in central Idaho. Further evidence for this comes from the sand of the Tyee Formation that overlie the Roseburg Formation. Not only does this sand have the same <b>isotopic</b> <b>composition</b> of rock in the Idaho Batholith (and of sand now coursing down the Snake and Columbia Rivers), but it appears to have not been transported very far from its source. This implies that the Tyee Formation was much closer to the Idaho Batholith when it was deposited, and subsequently rotated away. Geodetic surveys show that the region continues to rotate, likely as a result of extension of the Basin and Range Province and asthenospheric flow around the southern edge of the subducting Juan de Fuca plate.|$|E
40|$|Patterns of isotopic {{fractionation}} in biogeochemical {{processes are}} reviewed {{and it is}} suggested that isotopic fractionations will be small when substrates are large. If so, <b>isotopic</b> <b>compositions</b> of biomarkers will reflect those of their biosynthetic precursors. This prediction is tested by consideration of results of analyses of geoporphyrins and geolipids from the Greenhorn Formation (Cretaceous, Western Interior Seaway of North America) and the Messel Shale (Eocene, lacustrine, southern Germany). It is shown (i) that <b>isotopic</b> <b>compositions</b> of porphyrins that are related to a common source, but which have been altered structurally, cluster tightly and (ii) that isotopic differences between geolipids and porphyrins related to a common source are equal to those observed in modern biosynthetic products. Both of these observations are consistent with preservation of biologically controlled <b>isotopic</b> <b>compositions</b> during diagenesis. <b>Isotopic</b> <b>compositions</b> of individual compounds can thus be interpreted in terms of biogeochemical processes in ancient depositional environments. In the Cretaceous samples, <b>isotopic</b> <b>compositions</b> of n-alkanes are covariant with those of total organic carbon, while delta values for pristane and phytane are covariant with those of porphyrins. In this unit representing an open marine environment, the preserved acyclic polyisoprenoids apparently derive mainly from primary material, while the extractable, n-alkanes derive mainly from lower levels of the food chain.

5|$|Another Avogadro constant-based approach, {{known as}} the International Avogadro Coordination's Avogadro project, would define and {{delineate}} the kilogram as a 93.6mm diameter sphere of silicon atoms. Silicon was chosen because a commercial infrastructure with mature processes for creating defect-free, ultra-pure monocrystalline silicon already exists to service the semiconductor industry. To make a practical realization of the kilogram, a silicon boule (a rod-like, single-crystal ingot) would be produced. Its <b>isotopic</b> <b>composition</b> would be measured with a mass spectrometer to determine its average relative atomic mass. The boule would be cut, ground, and polished into spheres. The size of a select sphere would be measured using optical interferometry to an uncertainty of about 0.3nm on the radius—roughly a single atomic layer. The precise lattice spacing between the atoms in its crystal structure (≈192pm) would be measured using a scanning X-ray interferometer. This permits its atomic spacing to be determined with an uncertainty of only three parts per billion. With {{the size of the}} sphere, its average atomic mass, and its atomic spacing known, the required sphere diameter can be calculated with sufficient precision and low uncertainty to enable it to be finish-polished to a target mass of one kilogram.|$|E

The wehrlites and pyroxenites from Bullenmerri have Sr, Nd and Pb <b>isotopic</b> <b>compositions</b> that are generally {{similar to those}} found for alkali basalts in the region. The spinel lherzolites, in contrast, have higher 87 Sr/ 86 Sr and 206 Pb/ 204 Pb and lower 143 Nd/ 144 Nd ratios. Whereas the <b>isotopic</b> <b>compositions</b> of He are generally within the range of mid-ocean-ridge basalts (MORB) and do not covary with those of other trace elements, there is an apparent correlation between the 13 C/ 12 C and 143 Nd/ 144 Nd ratios for each of the two petrologic groups. These relationships, if substantiated for other xenolith suites, greatly limit the possible mechanisms for generating lithophile and volatile isotopic variations in the continental lithosphere. The helium <b>isotopic</b> <b>compositions</b> for all of the xenoliths fall within the range for MORB. This includes those from Ichinomegata, suggesting that the lower 3 He/ 4 He ratios found for He sampled at the surface at subduction zones result from mixing mantle He with near-surface crustal He rather than with subducted radiogenic He. Measured C <b>isotopic</b> <b>compositions</b> (relative to Peedee belemnite) for the Ichinomegata xenoliths {Mathematical expression} include values that are both lighter and heavier than those in MORB, and are compatible with contributions from subducted carbon.

40|$|The {{distribution}} of apolar and polar lipids and their stable carbon <b>isotopic</b> <b>compositions</b> were determined {{for a number}} of sediment samples from different sites in the Arabian Sea.

Specifically, we find that lycopane is probably derived from phytoplankton and that diploptene {{is derived from the}} lipids of chemoautotrophs living above the oxic/anoxic boundary. Three acyclic isoprenoids that have been considered markers for methanogens, pentamethyleicosane and two hydrogenated squalenes, have different delta values and apparently do not derive from a common source.

25|$|Hydrogen {{and oxygen}} {{isotopes}} also work as tracers for water budget in terrestrial reservoirs, including lakes, rivers, groundwater and soil water. For a lake, both {{the amount of}} water in the lake and the <b>isotopic</b> <b>composition</b> of the water are determined by a balance between inputs (precipitation, stream and ground water inflow) and outputs (evaporation, stream and ground water outflow). The <b>isotopic</b> <b>composition</b> of lake water can often be used to track evaporation, which causes isotope enrichment in the lake water, as well as a δD-δ18O slope that is shallower than the meteoric water line. The <b>isotopic</b> <b>composition</b> of river water is highly variable and have complicated sources over different timescales, but can generally be treated as a two-endmember mixing problem, a base-flow endmember (mainly ground water recharge) and an overland-flow endmember (mainly storm events). The isotope data suggest that the long-term integrated base-flow endmember is more important in most rivers, even during peak flows in summer. Systematic river isotope data were collected across the world by the Global Network of Isotopes in Rivers (GNIR).The <b>isotopic</b> <b>composition</b> of groundwater {{can also be used to}} trace its sources and flow paths. An example is a groundwater isotope mapping study in Sacramento, California, which showed lateral flow of river water with a distinct isotope composition into the groundwater that developed a significant water table depression due to pumping for human use. The same study also showed an isotopic signal of agricultural water being recharged into the giant alluvial aquifer in California's Central Valley. Finally, the <b>isotopic</b> <b>composition</b> of soil water is important for the study of plants. Below the water table, the soil has a relatively constant source of water with a certain <b>isotopic</b> <b>composition.</b> Above the water table, the <b>isotopic</b> <b>composition</b> of soil water is enriched by evaporation until a maximum at the surface. The vertical profile of <b>isotopic</b> <b>composition</b> of soil water is maintained by the diffusion of both liquid and vapor water.

Isotopic imaging with the NanoSIMS shows the presence of numerous discrete hotspots that are strongly enriched in {sup 15 }N, including the largest {sup 15 }N enrichments ({approx} 1300 {per_thousand}) observed in IDPs to date. A number of the IDPs also contain larger regions with more modest enrichments in {sup 15 }N, leading to average bulk N <b>isotopic</b> <b>compositions</b> that are {sup 15 }N-enriched in these IDPs. Although C <b>isotopic</b> <b>compositions</b> are normal {{in most of the}} IDPs, two {sup 15 }N-rich N-hotspots have correlated {sup 13 }C anomalies. CN{sup -}/C{sup -} ratios suggest that most of the {sup 15 }N-rich hotspots are associated with relatively N-poor carbonaceous matter, although specific carriers have not been determined. H isotopic distributions {{are similar to those of}} N: D anomalies are present both as distinct very D-rich hotspots and as larger regions with more modest enrichments. Nevertheless, H and N isotopic anomalies are not directly correlated, consistent with results from previous studies. Oxygen isotopic imaging shows the presence of abundant presolar silicate grains in the IDPs. The O <b>isotopic</b> <b>compositions</b> of the grains are similar to those found in presolar oxide and silicate grains from primitive meteorites. Most of the silicate grains in the IDPs have isotopic ratios consistent with meteoritic Group 1 oxide grains, indicating origins in oxygen-rich red giant and asymptotic giant branch stars, but several presolar silicates exhibit the {sup 17 }O and {sup 18 }O enrichments of Group 4 oxide grains, whose origin is less well understood. Based on their N <b>isotopic</b> <b>compositions,</b> the IDPs studied here can be divided into two groups. One group is characterized as being ''isotopically primitive'' and consists of those IDPs that have anomalous bulk N <b>isotopic</b> <b>compositions.</b> These particles typically also contain numerous {sup 15 }N-rich N-hotspots, occasional C isotopic anomalies, and abundant presolar silicate grains. In contrast, the other ''isotopically normal'' IDPs have normal bulk N <b>isotopic</b> <b>compositions</b> and, although some contain {sup 15 }N-rich hotspots, none exhibit C isotopic anomalies and none contain presolar silicate or oxide grains. Thus, isotopically interesting IDPs can be identified and selected on the basis of their N <b>isotopic</b> <b>compositions</b> for further study. However, this distinction does not extend to H <b>isotopic</b> <b>compositions.</b> Although both H and N anomalies are frequently attributed to the survival of molecular cloud material in IDPs and, thus, should be more common in IDPs with anomalous bulk N compositions, D anomalies are as common in normal IDPs as they are in those characterized as isotopically primitive, based on their N isotopes. This may be due to different effects of secondary processing on the isotopic systems involved...|$|R
