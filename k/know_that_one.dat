25|$|In Time After Time, H.G. Wells invents a {{time machine}} and shows it to some friends {{in a manner similar}} to the first part of the novella. He does not <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> of his friends is Jack The Ripper. The Ripper, fleeing police, escapes to the future (1979), but without a key which {{prevents}} the machine from remaining in the future. When it does return home, Wells follows him in order to protect the future (which he imagines to be a utopia) from the Ripper. In turn, the film inspired a 2017 TV series of the same name.|$|E
25|$|To {{return to}} the Original Imitation Game, he states only that player A is to be {{replaced}} with a machine, not that player C is to {{be made aware of}} this replacement. When Colby, FD Hilf, S Weber and AD Kramer tested PARRY, they did so by assuming that the interrogators did not need to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> or more of those being interviewed was a computer during the interrogation. As Ayse Saygin, Peter Swirski, and others have highlighted, this makes a big difference to the implementation and outcome of the test. An experimental study looking at Gricean maxim violations using transcripts of Loebner's one-to-one (interrogator-hidden interlocutor) Prize for AI contests between 1994–1999, Ayse Saygin found significant differences between the responses of participants who knew and did not know about computers being involved.|$|E
25|$|I {{suspect that}} I know {{more of the}} English class than any man in Britain. I never kept any reckoning: but I <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> year with another? — and less of late years than in earlier time? — I have talked to more than five in each year, giving {{more than a hundred}} and fifty specimens. Of this I am sure, that it is my own fault if they have not been a thousand. Nobody knows how they swarm, except those to whom they {{naturally}} resort. They are in all ranks and occupations, of all ages and characters. They are very earnest people, and their purpose is bona fide, the dissemination of their paradoxes. A great many — the mass, indeed — are illiterate, and a great many waste their means, and are in or approaching penury. These discoverers despise one another.|$|E

500|$|Hannah Arendt, a {{political}} theorist who reported on Eichmann's trial for The New Yorker, described Eichmann {{in her book}} Eichmann in Jerusalem {{as the embodiment of}} the [...] "banality of evil", as she thought he appeared to have an ordinary personality, displaying neither guilt nor hatred. Arendt also wrote that [...] "this case was built on what the Jews had suffered, not on what Eichmann had done." [...] In his 1988 book Justice, Not Vengeance, Wiesenthal said: [...] "The world now understands the concept of 'desk murderer'. We <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> doesn't need to be fanatical, sadistic, or mentally ill to murder millions; that it is enough to be a loyal follower eager to do one's duty." [...] The term [...] "" [...] became a pejorative term for bureaucrats charged with indirectly and systematically harming others.|$|E

Beyoncé sings a meandering melody as she alternately references the pleasures of love and sex. Using simple arithmetic to describe her undying love for her partner, she begins the first verse as she affirms to her romantic interest {{that the only thing}} she is sure about is her feelings for him, [...] "I don't know much about algebra, but I <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> plus one equals two ... If I ain't got something, I don't give a damn / 'Cause I got it with you". In the pre-chorus lines, Beyoncé expresses her reliance on her man without whom she believes to be incomplete as she sings, [...] "And it's me and you, that's all we'll have when the world is through / Because baby we ain't got nothing without love / Darling, you got enough love for the both of us".|$|E

2500|$|Mirror Ball captures a loose rock sound.

[...] Young wrote all of the tracks for the album except for [...] "Peace and Love", which was co-written by Young and Vedder.

2500|$|Armstrong {{presents}} {{a response to}} Colin Radford's {{modified version of the}} [...] "unconfident examinee" [...] example. A student is asked when Queen Elizabeth I died, and he hesitatingly answers [...] "1603" [...] and exhibits no confidence in his answer. He has forgotten that at some point previously, he studied English history. Radford presents this as an example of knowledge without belief. But Armstrong differs on this: the unconfident examinee has a belief that Queen Elizabeth I died in 1603, he knows that she died in 1603, but he does not know that he knows. Armstrong rejects the KK Principle—that to know some thing p, one must <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> knows p. Armstrong's rejection of the KK Principle is consistent with his wider externalist project.|$|E
2500|$|In 638, {{there was}} yet another {{incident}} where Wang, by then the minister of ceremonies, suggested that high-level officials {{should not have to}} yield to imperial princes when their processions meet. [...] Emperor Taizong initially saw this as an insult to the imperial princes—particularly Li Tai, whom he was secretly considering replacing Li Chengqian with—and he made the statement, [...] "Life is uncertain. [...] If the Crown Prince should die early, how do you <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> of the princes would not be your lord in the future. [...] How can you disrespect them?" [...] Wei, seeing what was happening, spoke bluntly, [...] "Ever since Zhou Dynasty, succession is always from father to son, not to brothers, to prevent plotting by younger sons and stop infighting at their origin. [...] This is what the rulers need to be careful about." [...] Emperor Taizong thereafter approved Wang's proposal.|$|E

2500|$|The leap {{of faith}} is his {{conception}} of how an individual would believe in God or how a person would act in love. Faith is not a decision based on evidence that, say, certain beliefs about God are true or a certain person is worthy of love. No such evidence could ever be enough to completely justify the kind of total commitment involved in true religious faith or romantic love. Faith involves making that commitment anyway. Kierkegaard thought that to have faith {{is at the same}} time to have doubt. So, for example, for one to truly have faith in God, one would also have to doubt one's beliefs about God; the doubt is the rational part of a person's thought involved in weighing evidence, without which the faith would have no real substance. Someone who does not realize that Christian doctrine is inherently doubtful and that there can be no objective certainty about its truth does not have faith but is merely credulous. For example, it takes no faith to believe that a pencil or a table exists, when one is looking at it and touching it. In the same way, to believe or have faith in God is to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> has no perceptual or any other access to God, and yet still has faith in God. Kierkegaard writes, [...] "doubt is conquered by faith, just as it is faith which has brought doubt into the world".|$|E
2500|$|In 1858, James M. Osborn (1811–1868), a 47 {{year old}} daguerreian, native of New York, living in Charleston, S.C., {{joined forces with}} 22 year old Charleston native, Frederick Eugene Durbec (1836–1894). Both were soon to become among the war's first photographers. By 1860, from their state-of-the-art, {{high-volume}} studio, they had reached a national audience with their advertised [...] "largest and most varied assortment of steroscopic instruments and pictures ever offered in this country." [...] By then, both had joined the Lafayette Artillery, Durbec having risen {{to the rank of}} colonel. It was also at this time that O produced documentary photographs of the city and its vicinity, including their singularly historic, antebellum scenes of plantations and slave life. Following the Federal surrender of Fort Sumter on April 14, 1861, Osborn would visit the fort and its surrounds on at least two occasions, taking at least 43 stereo images of the battle's aftermath, in what is the largest known group of Confederate images of the war, and which is considered the most comprehensive photographic record of a Civil War engagement ever made. Today, thirty-nine are known to exist. Their friendship would outlast their Charleston business however, which the war and damaging fires had brought to an end by February 1862. Then, in September 1863, in response to Gen. Thomas Jordan's desire to document what [...] "Southern troops could endure", Osborn and fellow artist George S. Cook volunteered to photograph the interior of Fort Sumter, which had been shelled by Union batteries into a shapeless mass. Little did the enterprising partners <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> result of this visit would be the first combat photographs in history.|$|E
