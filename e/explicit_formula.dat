25|$|Green's {{functions}} for linear partial differential equations {{can often be}} found by using the Fourier transform to convert this into an algebraic problem. Atiyah used a non-linear version of this idea. He used the Penrose transform to convert the Green's function for the conformally invariant Laplacian into a complex analytic object, {{which turned out to}} be essentially the diagonal embedding of the Penrose twistor space into its square. This allowed him to find an <b>explicit</b> <b>formula</b> for the conformally invariant Green's function on a 4-manifold.|$|E
25|$|Verlinde's PhD thesis {{was titled}} “Conformal Field Theory Applied to Strings”. In it he {{investigated}} conformal field theories in two dimensions and {{their relation to}} {{the description of the}} world sheet of fundamental strings. As part of the project he extended fusion or Verlinde algebras, describing conformal field theories with a finite number of fields. A main result was an <b>explicit</b> <b>formula</b> for the fusion rules of these algebras, now known as the Verlinde formula. This {{has proven to be a}} highly non-trivial mathematical result. In Verlinde's original work, the formula followed from mainly physical arguments, but since its introduction many formal mathematical proofs have been provided.|$|E
25|$|When {{analyzing}} {{an inverse}} problem, obtaining a maximum likelihood model {{is usually not}} sufficient, as we normally also wish to have information on the resolution power of the data. In the general case {{we may have a}} large number of model parameters, and an inspection of the marginal probability densities of interest may be impractical, or even useless. But it is possible to pseudorandomly generate a large collection of models according to the posterior probability distribution and to analyze and display the models {{in such a way that}} information on the relative likelihoods of model properties is conveyed to the spectator. This can be accomplished by means of an efficient Monte Carlo method, even in cases where no <b>explicit</b> <b>formula</b> for the a priori distribution is available.|$|E
