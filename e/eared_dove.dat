5|$|The {{mourning}} dove {{is closely related}} to the <b>eared</b> <b>dove</b> (Zenaida auriculata) and the Socorro dove (Zenaida graysoni). Some authorities describe them as forming a superspecies and these three birds are sometimes classified in the separate genus Zenaidura, but the current classification has them as separate species in the genus Zenaida. In addition, the Socorro dove has at times been considered conspecific with the {{mourning dove}}, although several differences in behavior, call, and appearance justify separation as two different species. While the three species do form a subgroup of Zenaida, using a separate genus would interfere with the monophyly of Zenaida by making it paraphyletic.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species have}} large natural ranges. The <b>eared</b> <b>dove</b> ranges across the {{entirety}} of South America from Colombia to Tierra del Fuego, the Eurasian collared dove has a massive (if discontinuous) distribution from Britain across Europe, the Middle East, India, Pakistan and China, and the laughing dove across most of sub-Saharan Africa, as well as India, Pakistan, and the Middle East. Other species have tiny, restricted distributions; this is most common in island endemics. The whistling dove is endemic to the tiny Kadavu Island in Fiji, the Caroline ground dove is restricted to two islands, Truk and Pohnpei in the Caroline Islands, and the Grenada dove is restricted to Grenada in the Caribbean. Some continental species also have tiny distributions; for example, the black-banded fruit dove is restricted to a small area of the Arnhem Land of Australia, the Somali pigeon is restricted to a tiny area of northern Somalia, and Moreno's ground dove is restricted to the area around Salta and Tucuman in northern Argentina.|$|E
25|$|The islands {{have two}} endemic birds — the Noronha elaenia (Elaenia ridleyana) and the Noronha vireo (Vireo gracilirostris). Both are {{present on the}} main island; Noronha vireo is also present on Ilha Rata. In {{addition}} there is an endemic subspecie of <b>eared</b> <b>dove</b> Zenaida auriculata noronha. Subfossil remains of an extinct endemic rail have also been found. The archipelago {{is also an important}} site for breeding seabirds. An endemic sigmodontine rodent, Noronhomys vespuccii, mentioned by Amerigo Vespucci, is now extinct. The islands have two endemic reptiles, the Noronha wormlizard Amphisbaena ridleyi and the Noronha skink Trachylepis atlantica.|$|E
50|$|The <b>eared</b> <b>doves</b> around Córdoba do not migrate, and the {{enormous}} flocks are described as flying constantly between their roosting woods and the open fields. In the Córdoba region in Argentina the <b>eared</b> <b>doves</b> are known as palomas doradas because of the shining feathers sometimes present in their plumage.|$|R
25|$|Rodent prey {{is usually}} {{dominated}} by locally superabundant species, like the delicate vesper mouse (Calomys tener) in southern Brazil. Among squamates and amphibians, small lizards like the {{tropical house gecko}} (Hemidactylus mabouia), and frogs and toads predominate. Generally, most vertebrate prey is in the weight class of several grams per individual. The largest prey are usually birds, such as <b>eared</b> <b>doves</b> (Zenaida auriculata) which may weigh {{almost as much as}} a burrowing owl.|$|R
25|$|It {{is a close}} {{relative}} of the mourning and <b>eared</b> <b>doves,</b> particularly the former and was at one time considered a subspecies.

These are excluded from the reintroduction program as there is evidence of unique adaptations in the Socorro species. The scientific name commemorates Zénaïde Laetitia Julie Bonaparte and the American ornithologist and artist Andrew Jackson Grayson.|$|R
50|$|Scaly-naped pigeons {{are usually}} found {{alone or in}} small groups. They feed in trees an {{on the ground and}} often mix with the rock dove, <b>eared</b> <b>dove</b> and the zenaida dove. Like most doves they are wary and will flee if the feel in danger.|$|E
5000|$|The {{scale of}} this wing-shooting recalls {{the numbers of}} {{passenger}} pigeons taken by North American gunners in the 1800s. That hunting pressure brought the passenger pigeon to rapid extinction, but the <b>eared</b> <b>dove</b> {{seems to be more}} resilient. Indeed, as with the passenger pigeons, <b>eared</b> <b>dove</b> populations in Argentina and Bolivia sometimes [...] "darken the skies". Thus, it seems that populations on the sporting estates of Argentina are holding their own, with the birds breeding four times a year and thriving on the vast areas of grain, some grown for their benefit, most of it on commercial farms which are happy to support the dove shooting. There are dozens of luxury lodges which specialize in dove hunting, and the season extends all year long.|$|E

Fauna includes rabbits, opossums, pocket gophers, <b>eared</b> <b>dove,</b> white-winged dove, and the endemic species of white owl and pájaro tho.|$|E
50|$|Further north, in Bolivia, around de Gran Chaco region, {{near the}} immense soy and sorghum {{plantations}} around Santa Cruz de la Sierra, the dove shooting is more seasonal, going from May to September with large flocks arriving from Argentina to raid the grain crops. Locals attest that <b>eared</b> <b>doves,</b> which they call by the Guaraní name of totaky were quite {{rare in the}} region {{just a couple of}} decades ago, a testimony not only to the resilience of the species but to the huge impact that the newly created large feeding grounds have on dove populations.|$|R

50|$|The <b>eared</b> <b>dove</b> (Zenaida auriculata) is a New World dove. It is a {{resident}} breeder throughout South America from Colombia to southern Argentina and Chile, {{and on the}} offshore islands from the Grenadines southwards. It may be a relatively recent colonist of Tobago and Trinidad. It appears to be partially migratory, its movements driven by food supplies.|$|E
50|$|The {{phenomenon}} {{has been studied}} in most detail in an island system with lizards and raptors that prey on them. In the Canary Islands, frugivorous Atlantic lizards (Gallotia atlantica) consume Lycium intricatum fruit, and thus seeds from the fruit are found in their feces. The lizards are eaten by southern grey shrikes (Lanius meridionalis), and the shrike feces contained seeds from the fruit consumed by the lizards along with lizard remains. On these same islands, common kestrels (Falco tinnunculus) and invasive domestic cats (Felis catus) may also consume these lizards and dispersing the seeds from the lizards’ guts. These lizards also consume other plant species whose seeds may be dispersed by the lizards’ predators, such as Rubia fruticosa, Plocama pendula, and Asparagus nesiotes. Another example of diploendozoochory is that cougars (Puma concolor) eat <b>eared</b> <b>doves</b> (Zenaida auriculata), {{and as a result}} disperse seeds from lamb's-quarters (Chenopodium album), panic grass (Panicum bergii), and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor).|$|R

40|$|For birds, plumage color {{perception}} {{is critical in}} social interactions such as courtship, in both monochromatic and dichromatic species. In the <b>Eared</b> <b>Dove</b> (Zenaida auriculata), perhaps the most abundant South American Columbiforme, the plumage {{of males and females}} looks alike and both sexes share the same melanistic coloration with gray and pink tones. The aim of this study was therefore to determine whether evident sexual dichromatism exists in the plumage of the <b>Eared</b> <b>Dove</b> using a spectrophotometry technique in the avian-visible range (300 - 700 nm). The results of the classic colorimetric variables analysis (hue, chroma and brightness) show that males are in general brighter and have higher UV chroma values than females. The avian visual model points to differences in achromatic and chromatic levels between males and females in body regions possibly involved in sexual selection (e. g. the crown). The model also indicates chromatic or achromatic differences in body regions not subject to sexual selection such as the black spots on the wing coverts and white tail bands, both of which may be involved in intra- or inter-gender-specific communication...|$|E

We surveyed 35 transects located along secondary roads. Bird pest abundance was significantly higher at those sites with presence of woodlots (p< 0. 0001). Species-specific analyses revealed that abundance of both monk parakeet and picazuro pigeon was sensitive to the frequency of woodlots of tall and perennial tree species (Eucalyptus spp.; p< 0. 001), whereas <b>eared</b> <b>dove</b> abundance increased significantly with the frequency of woodlots composed by short and perennial tree species (Pinus spp., Casuarina spp.; p= 0. 002).

Spot-winged pigeons and individuals foraging alone spent more time scanning, with longer scanning bout duration, than eared doves and individuals foraging in groups, respectively. Spot-winged pigeons showed greater alert distances (observed detection probabilities) than eared doves, and so did solitary individuals as compared to individuals foraging in groups. Greater scanning time may have increased predicted and observed detection probabilities of spot-winged pigeons.

The avifauna of the Pampa del Tamarugal in the desert of Atacama, Chile, is highly depauperate, with two species accounting for the greatest numbers: the widespread Rufous-collared Sparrow (Zonotrichia capensis) and the endemic Tamarugo Conebill (Conirostrum tamarugense). We used molecular and microscopic methods to estimate the prevalence of haemoparasites in birds inhabiting the Pampa del Tamarugal. The molecular screening of the samples from the most common species indicated that the Tamarugo Conebill was only infected by parasites of the genus Leucocytozoon (prevalence 3. 5 %) and the Rufous-collared Sparrow was uninfected. Only two other bird species (of a total of seven) were infected, the House Sparrow (Passer domesticus), by Plasmodium relictum (prevalence 30 %), and the <b>Eared</b> <b>Dove</b> (Zenaida auriculata), by Haemoproteus multipigmentatus (prevalence 100 %).

40|$|Abstract Changes at the {{landscape}} scale associated with expansion in {{agricultural land use}} and changes in agricultural practices are common causes of alteration in patterns of abundance and composition of avian communities. <b>Eared</b> <b>Dove</b> (Zenaida auriculata - Des Murs, 1847) {{is among the most}} common species in the Neotropics, considered both as game and pest in some countries. Here we characterized the regional and seasonal patterns of Eared Doves abundance in Southwestern Brazil and examined the relationship between landscape features and these abundance patterns. We counted Eared Doves using the point count system along routes in summer and winter and recorded land use at two scales. We used linear regressions to model the effect of landscape matrix and land use at local scale with Doves abundance in two seasons. At {{the landscape}} scale, in winter, the abundance was greater in routes crossing landscapes dominated by plantations. In summer, it was lower in routes with large tracts of forests and mixed farming. While in winter, at the local scale, the Doves abundance was greater in routes with higher frequency of maize plantations, in summer higher abundances were observed in routes with higher frequency of sugar cane and soybean plantations.
