Using PACS onboard Herschel, we observed six PDRs spanning a wide range of FUV radiation fields (G_ 0 = 100 - 10 ^ 5). To measure the photoelectric <b>heating</b> <b>efficiency,</b> we obtained the intensities of the main cooling lines, i. e., the [OI] 63 um, 145 um, and [CII] 158 um, as well as the FIR continuum intensity. We used Spitzer/IRS spectroscopic mapping observations to {{investigate the}} MIR PAH features in the same regions. We decomposed the MIR PAH emission into that of neutral (PAH^ 0) and positively ionized (PAH^+) species to derive the fraction of the positively charged PAHs, and compare it to the photoelectric <b>heating</b> <b>efficiency.</b> The <b>heating</b> <b>efficiency</b> traced by ([OI] 63 um+[OI] 145 um+[CII] 158 um) / TIR, ranges between 0. 1 % and 0. 9 % in different sources, and the fraction of PAH^+ relative to (PAH^ 0 + PAH^+) spans from 0 (+ 11) % to 87 (+/- 10) %. All positions with a high PAH^+ fraction show a low <b>heating</b> <b>efficiency,</b> and all positions with a high <b>heating</b> <b>efficiency</b> have a low PAH^+ fraction, supporting the scenario in which a positive grain charge results in a decreased <b>heating</b> <b>efficiency.</b> Theoretical estimates of the photoelectric <b>heating</b> <b>efficiency</b> show a stronger dependence on the charging parameter gamma=G_ 0 T^{ 1 / 2 }/n_e than the observed efficiency reported in this study, and the discrepancy is significant at low gamma. The photoelectric <b>heating</b> <b>efficiency</b> on PAHs, traced by ([OI] 63 um+[OI] 145 um+[CII] 158 um) / (PAH+[OI] 63 um+[OI] 145 um+[CII] 158 um), shows a much better match between the observations and the theoretical estimates. The good agreement of the photoelectric <b>heating</b> <b>efficiency</b> on PAHs with a theoretical model indicates the dominant contribution of PAHs to the photoelectric heating.

40|$|A novel <b>heating</b> <b>efficiency</b> {{analysis}} of the microwave heated stop-flow (i. e. stagnant liquid) and continuous-flow reactors has been presented. The thermal losses to the surrounding air by natural convection have been taken into account for <b>heating</b> <b>efficiency</b> calculation of the microwave heating process. The effect of the load diameter {{in the range of}} 4 – 29 mm on the <b>heating</b> <b>efficiency</b> of ethylene glycol was studied in a single mode microwave cavity under continuous flow and stop-flow conditions. The variation of the microwave absorbing properties of the load with temperature was estimated. Under stop-flow conditions, the <b>heating</b> <b>efficiency</b> depends on the load diameter. The highest <b>heating</b> <b>efficiency</b> has been observed at the load diameter close to the half wavelength of the electromagnetic field in the corresponding medium. Under continuous-flow conditions, the <b>heating</b> <b>efficiency</b> increased linearly. However, microwave leakage above the propagation diameter restricted further experimentation at higher load diameters. Contrary to the stop-flow conditions, the load temperature did not raise monotonously from the inlet to outlet under continuous-flow conditions. This was due to the combined effect of lagging convective heat fluxes in comparison to volumetric heating. This severely disturbs the uniformity of the electromagnetic field in the axial direction and creates areas of high and low field intensity along the load length decreasing the <b>heating</b> <b>efficiency</b> as compared to stop-flow conditions...|$|R

5000|$|Passive solar {{building}} design allows buildings {{to harness the}} energy of the sun efficiently without the use of any active solar mechanisms such as photovoltaic cells or solar hot water panels. Typically passive {{solar building}} designs incorporate materials with high thermal mass that retain heat effectively and strong insulation that works to prevent heat escape. Low energy designs also requires the use of solar shading, by means of awnings, blinds or shutters, to relieve the solar heat gain in summer and to reduce the need for artificial cooling.

All the samples have been synthesized, structurally/magnetically characterized, and tested for magnetic hyperthermia treatment at the Functional Materials Laboratory of the University South Florida. This work includes studies on four different systems: (i) Core/shell Fe/γ-Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles; (ii) Spherical and cubic exchange coupled FeO/Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles; (iii) Fe 3 O 4 nano-octopods with different sizes; (iv) High aspect ratio FeCo nanowires and Fe 3 O 4 nanorods. In particular, we demonstrated the enhancement of the <b>heating</b> <b>efficiency</b> of these nanostructures by creating monodisperse and highly crystalline nanoparticles, and tuning their magnetic properties, mainly their saturation magnetization (MS) and effective anisotropy, in controlled ways. In addition, we studied the influence of other parameters, such as the size and concentration of the nanoparticles, the magnitude of the applied AC magnetic field, or different media (agar vs. water), on the final <b>heating</b> <b>efficiency</b> of these nanoparticles. For the core/shell Fe/γ-Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles, a modest <b>heating</b> <b>efficiency</b> has been obtained, resulting mainly from the strong reduction in MS caused by the shrinkage of the core with time. However, for sizes above 14 nm, the shrinkage process is much slower and the obtained <b>heating</b> <b>efficiency</b> is better than the one exhibited by conventional solid nanoparticles of the same size. In the case of the exchange-coupled FeO/Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles, we successfully created two sets of comparable particles: spheres with 1. 5 times larger MS than the cubes, and cubes with 1. 5 times larger effective anisotropy than the spheres, while keeping the other parameters the same. Our results show that increasing the effective anisotropy of the nanoparticles gives rise to a greater <b>heating</b> <b>efficiency</b> than increasing their MS. The Fe 3 O 4 nano-octopods, with enhanced surface anisotropy, present better <b>heating</b> <b>efficiency</b> than their spherical and cubic nanoparticles, especially in the high field region, and we have shown that by tuning their size and the effective anisotropy, we can optimize their heating response to the applied AC magnetic field. For magnetic fields, smaller than 300 − 400 Oe we found that the smallest nano-octopods give the best <b>heating</b> <b>efficiency.</b> Yet if we increase the AC field value, the bigger octopods show an increased <b>heating</b> <b>efficiency</b> and become more effective. Finally, the FeCo nanowires and Fe 3 O 4 nanorods exhibit enhanced <b>heating</b> <b>efficiency</b> with increasing aspect ratio when aligned {{in the direction of the}} applied AC magnetic field, due to the combined effect of shape anisotropy and dipolar interactions. Of all the studied systems, these 1 D high aspect ratio nanostructures have displayed the highest heating rates. All of these findings point toward an important fact that tuning the structural and magnetic parameters in general, and the effective anisotropy in particular, of the nanoparticles is a very promising approach for improving the <b>heating</b> <b>efficiency</b> of magnetic nanostructures for enhanced hyperthermia...|$|R
