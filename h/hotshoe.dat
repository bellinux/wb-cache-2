50|$|On 12 September 2012, Sony {{introduced}} a new 21+3-pin metal-based <b>hotshoe</b> with mechanical quick locking mechanism, called Multi Interface Shoe. At first sight it resembles a standard ISO 518 <b>hotshoe</b> with just the middle contact and chassis and without any vendor-specific extra contacts, but additional contacts are hidden under {{the front of the}} <b>hotshoe.</b> The new <b>hotshoe</b> is mechanically incompatible with the iISO <b>hotshoe,</b> but electrically backwards compatible. The first cameras to use the new <b>hotshoe</b> are the SLT-A99, NEX-6, NEX-VG900, NEX-VG30 and DSC-RX1. An ADP-MAA adapter to the iISO flash shoe is however provided with the Sony SLT-A99, and the newest flash Sony HVL-F60M, which uses the new <b>hotshoe</b> comes with a reverse adapter ADP-AMA for older Sony and Minolta cameras.|$|E

50|$|At first sight, the Multi Interface Shoe {{resembles a}} {{standard}} ISO 518 <b>hotshoe</b> with middle contact and frame ground {{and without any}} vendor-specific extra contacts, but additional electrical contacts are hidden under {{the front of the}} <b>hotshoe.</b> Therefore, the <b>hotshoe</b> is mechanically compatible with any ISO 518-based equipment, and while it does not allow to control third-party flashes, ISO-based flashes can be triggered at least. The <b>hotshoe</b> also features three holes in its metal base in order to support an optional locking mechanism in the flash or other <b>hotshoe</b> device. It does not, however, provide an auto-locking mechanism as on the Auto-lock Accessory Shoe.|$|E
50|$|He is {{owner of}} VIP Dance Events which tours major cities {{throughout}} Canada. He also {{appeared on the}} magazine cover of <b>Hotshoes</b> and appeared in Dance Spirit Magazine December 2006 issue.Lastly, he appeared on the 9/10/13 episode of Dance Moms as a guest choreographer.|$|R
5000|$|Since 1988, Minolta {{switched}} {{to use a}} 4-pin proprietary slide-on auto-lock [...] "iISO" [...] connector. A compatible 7-pin variant, which allows battery-less accessories to be powered off the camera's battery existed as well, but was not widely used. Konica Minolta and Sony Alpha digital SLR cameras are based on Minolta designs and therefore used the same connector, officially named Auto-lock Accessory Shoe, as well up to 2012. Since the electrical protocol remained mostly compatible, TTL and non-TTL adapters exist to adapt ISO-based flashes to iISO <b>hotshoes</b> and vice versa.|$|R
5000|$|Electrically, the Multi Interface Shoe {{includes}} all signals {{of both the}} Auto-lock Accessory Shoe and the Smart Accessory Terminal 2, thereby allowing passive electromechanical adapters to be used.For this purpose, Sony provides ADP-MAA (top: Auto-lock, bottom: MIS) and ADP-AMA (top: MIS, bottom: Auto-lock) adapters. Both adapters route through the [...] "F2" [...] and [...] "F3" [...] signals; the Auto-lock <b>hotshoe's</b> [...] "F1" [...] signal {{is connected to the}} middle contact of the Multi Interface shoe, not pin 20 ("F1#"), which is left open. MIS pins 7 and 15 ("REG_GND") are internally connected to both sides of the frame {{as well as to the}} GND signal of the Auto-lock shoe's side. [...] "MIC_GND" [...] pin 4 is left open.|$|R
5000|$|Built-in pop up {{electronic}} flash has {{a working}} range {{of up to}} 13 feet, with standard external <b>hotshoe</b> and PC-sync connector for studio strobes. Dedicated Kodak P20 <b>hotshoe</b> flash works with TTL exposure metering. External flash units should not exceed 500v contact requirement.|$|E
5000|$|The ADP-AMA's Auto-lock <b>hotshoe</b> {{features}} a switch, which shorts MIS pin 21 ("PGND") to [...] "GND" [...] when the adapter {{is mounted on}} a <b>hotshoe</b> without hole (as on a camera, or with ADP-MAA or FS-1200). Otherwise pin 21 is left open in the adapter (indicating wired or remote use). Assuming that pin 21 is tied to PGND in a camera's <b>hotshoe,</b> this allows flashes compatible with the Multi Interface Shoe to detect if they are mounted on the camera or not as {{it is necessary for}} ADI to work.|$|E
50|$|Older cameras still {{equipped}} with an electro-mechanical trigger contact may exhibit yet another problem. If they provide both, an ISO <b>hotshoe</b> and a PC terminal, both are typically wired to the same trigger contact in the camera rather than triggered independently as in cameras with electronic triggering circuits. When only the PC terminal is used and the <b>hotshoe</b> remains un-populated, a flash with high trigger circuit voltages connected to the PC terminal delivers this voltage on the normally unprotected middle contact of the camera's ISO <b>hotshoe.</b> If the photographer's eyebrows accidentally get {{into contact with the}} middle contact, the electrical shock can cause pain or even injuries. One way camera manufacturers have used to avoid this problem was to use two independent trigger contacts, which, however, could cause flash synchronization problems. Another, as utilized by Minolta in all such cameras supporting a PC terminal, was to add a small hidden contact {{on the side of the}} ISO <b>hotshoe,</b> which would disable the middle contact until some equipment was mounted in the <b>hotshoe,</b> thereby avoiding any possible contact with the operator's eyebrows as well.|$|E
2500|$|Simple point-and-shoot cameras rely almost {{exclusively}} on their built-in automation and machine intelligence for capturing images {{under a variety of}} situations and offer no manual control over their functions, a trait which makes them unsuitable for use by professionals, enthusiasts and proficient consumers (aka [...] "prosumers"). Bridge cameras provide some degree of manual control over the camera's shooting modes, and some even have <b>hotshoes</b> and the option to attach lens accessories such as filters and secondary converters. DSLRs typically provide the photographer with full control over all the important parameters of photography and have the option to attach additional accessories including hot shoe-mounted flash units, battery grips for additional power and hand positions, external light meters, and remote controls. DSLRs typically also have fully automatic shooting modes.|$|R

50|$|Sony {{also used}} a variety of other {{proprietary}} hotshoes for other digital cameras and camcorders, including the ISO-based 6-pin Cyber-shot <b>hotshoe,</b> the 16-pin Active Interface Shoe (AIS) and the ISO-based 16-pin Intelligent Accessory Shoe (IAS). Some of their NEX cameras used a proprietary Smart Accessory Terminal (versions 1 and 2). In September 2012, Sony announced a new ISO-based 21+3 pin Multi Interface Shoe for use with their future digital cameras and camcorders of the Alpha, NEX, Handycam, NXCAM and Cyber-shot series. This quick-lock <b>hotshoe</b> is mechanically and electrically compatible with a standard 2-pin ISO-518 <b>hotshoe,</b> but electrically compatible with the previous Auto-lock Accessory Shoe with extensions, so that passive adapters ADP-AMA and ADP-MAA allow to use digital-ready iISO flashes on new cameras and some new Multi Interface Shoe equipment on older cameras, while providing compatibility with standard ISO-based equipment as well.|$|E
50|$|In 2013, Sony {{released}} a third <b>hotshoe</b> adapter, named ADP-MAC. It allows to mount equipment with Active Interface Shoe onto cameras with Multi Interface Shoe.|$|E
50|$|Receivers {{specifically}} {{for use with}} video cameras are often mounted in a bodypack configuration, typically with a <b>hotshoe</b> mount to be fitted onto the <b>hotshoe</b> of the camcorder. Small true diversity receivers which slot into a special housing on many professional broadcast standard video cameras are produced by manufacturers including Sennheiser, Lectrosonics and Sony. For less demanding or more budget conscious video applications small non-diversity receivers are common. When used at relatively short operating distances from the transmitter this arrangement gives adequate and reliable performance.|$|E
5000|$|Panasonic {{claims the}} camera is the {{smallest}} among interchangeable lens cameras. It lacks some features found in competitors including a viewfinder, in-body image stabilization, a <b>hotshoe,</b> and NFC.|$|E
5000|$|The Multi Interface Shoe is a {{proprietary}} camera <b>hotshoe</b> introduced by Sony on 12 September 2012, replacing {{an assortment of}} other proprietary hotshoes used by Sony in various types of cameras in the past, including the Auto-lock Accessory Shoe (aka AAS or [...] "iISO" [...] shoe) introduced by Minolta in 1988 and used on Sony α DSLRs, SLTs and some NEX cameras, and the Smart Accessory Terminals types 1 (SAT) and 2 (SAT2) used on {{the majority of the}} Sony α NEX-line. It also replaces Sony's former Cyber-shot <b>hotshoe,</b> Intelligent Accessory Shoe (IAS) and Active Interface Shoe (AIS).|$|E
