25|$|Furniture factory sawdust {{incinerators}} {{need much}} attention as these have to handle resin powder and many <b>flammable</b> <b>substances.</b> Controlled combustion, burn back prevention systems are essential as dust when suspended resembles the fire catch phenomenon of any liquid petroleum gas.|$|E
50|$|A BLEVE {{need not}} be a {{chemical}} explosion—nor does there need to be a fire—however if a <b>flammable</b> <b>substance</b> is subject to a BLEVE it may also be subject to intense heating, either from an external source of heat which may have caused the vessel to rupture in the first place or from an internal source of localized heating such as skin friction. This heating can cause a <b>flammable</b> <b>substance</b> to ignite, adding a secondary explosion caused by the primary BLEVE. While blast effects of any BLEVE can be devastating, a <b>flammable</b> <b>substance</b> such as propane can add significantly to the danger.|$|R

25|$|Chloroform is a {{chemical}} compound in the trihalomethane family {{that does not}} undergo combustion in air, although it will burn when mixed with more <b>flammable</b> <b>substances.</b> Chloroform was first discovered in July 1831 by American physician Samuel Guthrie, independently {{a few months later}} by French chemist Eugène Soubeiran and then by German chemist Justus von Liebig.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{drinking}} bird's appearance and classification as a toy {{there is a}} potential danger of thin shards of glass should the bulb break. Early models were often filled with highly <b>flammable</b> <b>substances,</b> though the fluid in later versions is nonflammable. Dichloromethane can irritate the skin on contact and the lungs if inhaled. It may be dangerous to people with pre-existing heart, liver, or nervous system conditions and is a suspected carcinogen.|$|E
25|$|When {{different}} {{materials are}} brought {{together and then}} separated, an accumulation of electric charge can occur which leaves one material positively charged while the other becomes negatively charged. The mild shock that you receive when touching a grounded object after walking on carpet {{is an example of}} excess electrical charge accumulating in your body from frictional charging between your shoes and the carpet. The resulting charge build-up upon your body can generate a strong electrical discharge. Although experimenting with static electricity may be fun, similar sparks create severe hazards in those industries dealing with <b>flammable</b> <b>substances,</b> where a small electrical spark may ignite explosive mixtures with devastating consequences.|$|E

25|$|At the inquest into Voss's {{death at}} least one witness, his estranged brother, {{accused him of being}} culpable, {{claiming}} that Voss's business trips to the continent to buy anaesthetics masked a lucrative sideline in drug smuggling. This rumour had followed Voss for some time before his death and was alleged to {{have been the subject of}} investigations by the Metropolitan Police. Voss, according to his brother, was travelling aboard the aircraft together with his niece, and they were aware that the authorities were on to them. Voss sought to escape from the authorities by destroying the aircraft using various <b>flammable</b> <b>substances</b> to which his work gave him easy access and then bailing out in the confused circumstances, hoping that in the aftermath no one would notice one less body than there should be. An autopsy showed that, other than some minor burns, Voss was unharmed before he exited the aircraft. The inquest jury eventually returned an open verdict – indicating that they believed his death may not have been accidental, but that they were unable, on the evidence before them, to come to a definite conclusion – rather than the verdict of accidental death the coroner attempted to direct them towards.|$|E
