25|$|Zimbabwe had a {{good morning}} session on the third day, by their standards, as Laxman was run out for 140 and Yuvraj Singh and Dinesh Karthik were {{dismissed}} in successive overs. Captain Ganguly, however, held together well with the lower order, and he notched up the half-century along with his 5000th Test run before lunch, and India battled out the morning session with no further loss. And in the afternoon session, India's spinners took some beating. Dabengwa and Ewing bowled all but one over of the 37-over long session, despite Irfan Pathan defying the bowlers for 52 and Ganguly nurdling his way to 97 before tea, as Taibu seemed content with Ewing tying down the runs. He did not <b>even</b> <b>do</b> that very efficiently – by tea, his bowling analysis read 38–5–111–0, but he got a breakthrough three overs into the evening as the Indian captain smashed the ball straight to Dabengwa for 101. By the time, however, the Indian score had soared past 500, and in a frantic 40-ball feast at the end Harbhajan Singh, Zaheer Khan and Anil Kumble combined to add 52 {{for the last two}} wickets.|$|E

500|$|Coach McKay had {{won four}} {{national}} championships while coaching at USC, {{and he never}} hesitated to express his lack of awe at the NFL. He earned enemies in the league with his dismissive comments and nonchalant attitude. The league liked to promote the games as having life-or-death significance, and were undercut by a coach who would make statements such as, “You draw Xs and Os on a blackboard and that’s not so difficult. I can <b>even</b> <b>do</b> it with my left hand”. Such statements made the Buccaneers’ road more difficult, as a feeling grew around the league that McKay was a newcomer who needed to be taught a lesson. Linebacker Richard “Batman” Wood echoed those sentiments: “It was a brand-new organization. Who cared about us? They wanted to devastate us, beat us in the ground. And with coach McKay coming from college, they wanted to maybe even play us a little harder." [...] Examples given of opponents using McKay’s comments {{as an excuse to}} run up the score included the reverse that Denver ran late in a 48–10 victory, and the timeout that Chuck Fairbanks called {{at the end of the}} Patriots game to enable Steve Grogan to break the NFL record of season rushing touchdowns by a quarterback. One sports analyst had predicted that McKay’s lucrative contract would encourage opposing coaches to run up the score on the Buccaneers, to be able to demonstrate to their team owners that they were deserving of similar money.|$|E

2500|$|Following the {{large-scale}} movement of Chinese rural population {{to the cities}} the children of these migrant workers either stay as [...] left-behind children in the villages or they migrate with their parents to the cities. Although regulations by the central government stipulate that all migrant children {{have the right to}} attend a public school in the cities public schools nevertheless effectively reject these children by setting high thresholds such as school fees and exams or by requesting an urban registration (Hukou). Providing an alternative, private entrepreneurs established since the 1990s semi-official private schools that offered schooling to migrant children for lower fees. However, this system contributed to the segregation between urban and migrant children. Furthermore, these schools often have a poor teaching quality, provide only school certificates of limited value and sometimes <b>even</b> <b>do</b> not comply with safety regulations. Since the beginning of the 2000s, some local governments thus started campaigns to close these private schools but nevertheless in many cities these schools still exist. Although Chinese scholars have conducted case-study research on migrant children and their schools [...] there is a lack in studies with a nationwide scope.|$|E

Much on Lusitania centers around the Ribeira family, including Ender's wife Novinha and her children. [...] Novinha and Elanora, the mother-daughter team {{responsible for most of}} the biological advances countering the complex Descolada virus, are unsure if they can manufacture a harmless replacement virus. Conflicts arise on whether they should <b>even</b> <b>do</b> so, since the Descolada is intrinsically tied in with the life cycles of all Lusitanian organisms and may even be sentient itself. In addition, to try to devise methods to escape the planet, Lusitania's leading, troublemaking physicist Grego is persuaded by Ender to research faster-than-light travel, despite Grego scoffing at the idea. The third biologista of the family, Quara, is convinced that the Descolada is an intelligent, self-aware species, and deserves attempts from the humans for communication and preservation. [...] An additional sibling and Catholic priest, Quim (Father Estevão), is determined to use faith and theology to head off another form of xenocide: a group of warmongering Pequenino wish to wipe out all Earthborn life via starship, carrying the deadly Descolada within them.|$|E
2500|$|Jerry Pournelle of BYTE {{wrote in}} February 1984 that Turbo Pascal [...] "comes {{close to what}} I think the {{computer}} industry is headed for: well documented, standard, plenty of good features, and a reasonable price". Pournelle disliked the requirement to buy another license to distribute binaries, but noted that [...] "it turns {{out not to be}} a lot more. Borland only wants another $100" [...] more than the $49.95 base price, and that [...] "my first impression of Turbo is that it's probably worth $149.95. It looks to do everything MT+ with the Speed Programming Package does, and maybe <b>even</b> <b>do</b> it faster and better". He reported in July that, according to Kahn, IBM had refused to resell Turbo Pascal unless the price was at least $200; Pournelle noted that [...] "Turbo is much better than the Pascal IBM sells", and unlike the latter was compatible with the IBM PCjr. Three BYTE reviewers praised Turbo Pascal in the same issue. One called the DOS version [...] "without doubt, the best software value I have ever purchased", and another called the CP/M version [...] "an excellent product ... deserves praise for this high-value product". The third stated that it was [...] "not a good compiler for developing massive applications", but added that it was greatly superior to BASIC, the programming language usually associated with home computers at the time. He concluded that Turbo Pascal was [...] "a bargain that shouldn't be passed up".|$|E
2500|$|Some basic conventions, such as (1) that animal/human homolog (ortholog) pairs {{differ in}} letter case (title case and all caps, respectively) and (2) that the symbol is {{italicized}} {{when referring to}} the gene but nonitalic when referring to the protein, are often not followed by contributors to public health journals. Many journals have the copyeditors restyle the casing and formatting to the extent feasible, although in complex genetics discussions only subject-matter experts (SMEs) can effortlessly parse them all. One example that illustrates the potential for ambiguity among non-SMEs is that some official gene names have the word [...] "protein" [...] within them, so the phrase [...] "brain protein I3 (BRI3)" [...] (referring to the gene) and [...] "brain protein I3 (BRI3)" [...] (referring to the protein) are both valid. The AMA Manual gives another example: both [...] "the TH gene" [...] and [...] "the TH gene" [...] can validly be parsed as correct ("the gene for tyrosine hydroxylase"), because the first mentions the alias (description) and the latter mentions the symbol. This seems confusing on the surface, although {{it is easier to}} understand when explained as follows: in this gene's case, as in many others, the alias (description) [...] "happens to use the same letter string" [...] that the symbol uses. (The matching of the letters is of course acronymic in origin and thus the phrase [...] "happens to" [...] implies more coincidence than is actually present; but phrasing it that way helps to make the explanation clearer.) There is no way for a non-SME to know this is the case for any particular letter string without looking up every gene from the manuscript in a database such as NCBI Gene, reviewing its symbol, name, and alias list, and doing some mental cross-referencing and double-checking (plus it helps to have biochemical knowledge). Most medical journals do not (in some cases cannot) pay for that level of fact-checking as part of their copyediting service level; therefore, it remains the author's responsibility. However, as pointed out earlier, many authors make little attempt to follow the letter case or italic guidelines; and regarding protein symbols, they often won't use the official symbol at all. For example, although the guidelines would call p53 protein [...] "TP53" [...] in humans or [...] "Tp53" [...] in rats, most authors call it [...] "p53" [...] in both (and even refuse to call it [...] "TP53" [...] if edits or queries try to), not least because of the biologic principle that many proteins are essentially or exactly the same molecules regardless of mammalian species. Regarding the gene, authors are usually willing to call it by its human-specific symbol and capitalization, TP53, and may <b>even</b> <b>do</b> so without being prompted by a query. But the end result of all these factors is that the published literature often does not follow the nomenclature guidelines completely.|$|E
