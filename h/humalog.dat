The first biosynthetic insulin analog was developed for clinical use at mealtime (prandial insulin), <b>Humalog</b> (insulin lispro), it is more rapidly absorbed after subcutaneous injection than regular insulin, with an effect 15minutes after injection. Other rapid-acting analogues are NovoRapid and Apidra, with similar profiles. All are rapidly absorbed due to amino acid sequences that will reduce formation of dimers and hexamers (monomeric insulins are more rapidly absorbed). Fast acting insulins do not require the injection-to-meal interval previously recommended for human insulin and animal insulins. The other type is long acting insulin; the first of these was Lantus (insulin glargine). These have a steady effect for an extended period from 18 to 24hours. Likewise, another protracted insulin analogue (Levemir) is based on a fatty acid acylation approach. A myristyric acid molecule is attached to this analogue, which associates the insulin molecule to the abundant serum albumin, which in turn extends the effect and reduces the risk of hypoglycemia. Both protracted analogues need to be taken only once daily, and are used for type 1 diabetics as the basal insulin. A combination of a rapid acting and a protracted insulin is also available, making it more likely for patients to achieve an insulin profile that mimics that of the body´s own insulin release.|$|E

The purpose of this 12 -week, parallel-group, randomized, treat-to-target study was to evaluate the difference in clinical efficacy, safety, and outcome of treatment between <b>Humalog</b> Mix 50 / 50 and <b>Humalog</b> Mix 75 / 25 analogs in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. In total, 146 insulin-naïve patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and aged 18 – 75 years were randomized and treated twice a day with either <b>Humalog</b> Mix 50 / 50 (group A) or <b>Humalog</b> Mix 75 / 25 (group B). We monitored levels of fasting blood glucose, 2 -hour postprandial blood glucose, and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA 1 c) in patients in both groups prior to and 3 months post treatment, the average time to achieve target blood glucose level, and frequency of hypoglycemic episodes during treatment. We found that group A showed better glycemic control as per fasting blood glucose and 2 -hour postprandial blood glucose than group B. Moreover, HbA 1 c levels in group A (5. 5 %± 1. 4 %) were lower by 1. 0 %± 0. 1 % (P< 0. 05) compared with those in group B (6. 5 %± 1. 5 %). The time to achieve glucose control was shorter (P< 0. 05) in group A (12. 6 ± 3. 6 days) than in group B (22. 3 ± 4. 7 days). Regarding safety, no significant adverse events or severe hypoglycemia on treatment was observed in either group. Additionally, the 1 : 1 ratio of <b>Humalog</b> Mix 50 / 50 showed a trend towards fewer episodes of nocturnal hypoglycemia.

40|$|Abstract Introduction Circumscript, {{progressing}} lipoatrophy at the insulin injection {{sites is}} an unexplained, however rare condition in diabetes mellitus. Case presentation We report {{a case of}} severe localised lipoatrophy developing during insulin pump-treatment (continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion) with the insulin analogue lispro (<b>Humalog</b> ®) in a woman with type- 1 diabetes mellitus. After 11 months of progressing lipoatrophy at two spots on the abdomen, low-dose prednisone (5 - 10 mg) p. o. was given at breakfast for 8 months, whereby the atrophic lesions centripetally re-filled with subcutaneous fat tissue (confirmed by MRI) despite ongoing use of insulin lispro. However, 4 weeks after cessation of prednisone, lipoatrophy relapsed, but resolved after another 2 months of low-dose prednisone. No further relapse was noted during 12 months of follow-up on insulin-pump therapy with <b>Humalog</b> ®. Conclusion Consistent with an assumed inflammatory nature of the condition, low-dose oral prednisone appeared to have cured the lipoatrophic reaction in our patient. Our observation suggests a temporary intolerance of the subcutaneous fat tissue to insulin lispro (<b>Humalog</b> ®), triggered by an unknown endogenous mechanism. </p...|$|E
40|$|Aims: To compare {{hypoglycaemic}} events, {{glycated haemoglobin}} (HbA 1 c) {{and changes in}} body weight in Muslim patients with Type 2 diabetes receiving <b>Humalog</b> Mix 50 and human Mixtard 30 twice daily during Ramadan fasting. Methods: Data were collected from Muslim patients with Type 2 diabetes attending primary care practices in North-West London, who were on Mixtard 30 insulin twice daily before Ramadan. Group 1 had their evening insulin changed to <b>Humalog</b> Mix 50 (n = 26) 2 weeks before Ramadan, i. e. taking Mixtard 30 at predawn meal and <b>Humalog</b> Mix 50 at the sunset meal during Ramadan. As the major proportion of the daily caloric intake was consumed at the sunset meal, the rationale of switching the evening dose from human Mixtard 30 to <b>Humalog</b> Mix 50 was to provide more rapid-acting insulin that has shorter time of onset and peak time for the large evening meal to improve the postprandial glucose control without increasing the risk of hypoglycaemia. Group 2 continued on Mixtard 30 twice daily (n = 26). All patients received structured education about how to identify and manage hypoglycaemia during Ramadan. Results: Group 1 had a mean HbA 1 c reduction of 0. 48 % (p = 0. 0001) before and after Ramadan, whereas group 2 had a mean HbA 1 c increase of 0. 28 % (p = 0. 007). Group 1 {{was associated with a}} small reduction of 0. 04 (p = 0. 81) in the mean number of hypoglycaemic events during Ramadan compared with before Ramadan, whereas group 2 was associated with an increase of 0. 15 (p = 0. 43), although these differences between the groups were not statistically significant following adjustment for baseline factors [LSM difference between groups = 0. 135, p = 0. 36, 95 % confidence limits (- 0. 16, 0. 43) ].

Differences among five European countries were investigated. MethodsTwo hundred and ninety patients with type 2 diabetes were recruited from five European countries. Of these, 235 were suitable for inclusion in the analysis. Their mean age was 51. 3 years and, on average, patients had had diabetes for 11 years. A discrete-choice conjoint analysis was conducted using face-to-face interviews. Treatment attributes, such as timing of injections around meals, 2 -hour postprandial control, effect of prandial dosing, frequency of nocturnal hypoglycemia, and cost, and levels were derived after a systematic review of all published comparative clinical trial data. Meta-analyses were undertaken where appropriate. ResultsNinety percent (95 % CI 86 – 93 %) of patients would choose <b>Humalog</b> Mix 25 over Humulin 30 / 70, at the same cost. On average, European subjects were willing to pay € 111 per month more for <b>Humalog</b> Mix 25 (95 % CI € 86. 71 – 156. 91). The primary driver was the reduced risk of nocturnal hypoglycemic events, contributing 49 % of WTP. The convenience of dosing immediately before the meal contributed 37 %.

40|$|Background: Attaining optimal glucose {{control in}} type 2 {{diabetes}} (T 2 DM) is essential to minimise complications, but difficult to achieve in practice with declining β-cell function in patients. Aim: To evaluate the efficacy and feasibility of a protocol-led, treat-to-target approach emphasising earlier oral hypoglycaemic agent (OHA) combination and insulin use to target basal and prandial glucose in primary care. Methods: T 2 DM patients aged 40 - 75 years, with glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA 1 C) 6. 4 - 10. 0 % on diet or oral monotherapy in 7 practices were asked {{to participate in a}} protocol-led, target-driven programme of care using early OHA and insulin therapy combinations to target basal and prandial glucose. Recruited patients were randomised to pre-specified algorithms with monthly therapy adjustment aiming for fasting plasma glucose values (FPG) < 6 mmol/L and 2 -hour post-prandial (PPG) < 8 mmol/L. Isophane or <b>humalog</b> insulin was added where glucose targets were not attained. All patients were reviewed at one year. Glucose, weight and cardiovascular (CVS) risk factor outcomes were measured and the feasibility, acceptability and safety of the programme evaluated with validated questionnaires. Results: 345 patients were studied. 60 participated in the glucose study and 285 received standard care. 65 % of recruited patients were male, with mean (SD) age 61. 0 (8. 2) years, BMI 29. 8 (5. 3) kg/m 2, HbA 1 C 7. 5 (0. 9) % and median (IQR) T 2 DM duration 3 (1 - 5) years. 41 completed the study. Glucose control was significantly improved in recruited compared to non-recruited patients with a mean overall 0. 8 % HbA 1 C reduction and 72 % patients achieving HbA 1 C < 7 % and 64 % < 6. 5 % at 1 year. Therapy use was also significantly increased with 50 % requiring 3 therapies, 30 % 2 and 10 % monotherapy. 24 (59 %) of recruited patients received isophane and 16 (39 %) <b>humalog</b> to achieve targets. Glucose optimisation was achieved without significant hypoglycaemia or adverse events and patient quality of life (QoL) and therapy satisfaction remained high.

40|$|The {{engineering}} {{of insulin}} analogues illustrates {{the application of}} structure-based protein design to clinical medicine. Such design has traditionally been based on structures of wild-type insulin hexamers {{in an effort to}} optimize the pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic properties of the hormone. Rapid-acting insulin analogues (in chronological order of their clinical introduction, <b>Humalog</b> ® [Eli Lilly & Co. ], Novolog ® [Novo-Nordisk], and Apidra ® [Sanofi-Aventis]) exploit the targeted destabilization of subunit interfaces to facilitate capillary absorption. Conversely, long-acting insulin analogues exploit the stability of the insulin hexamer and its higher-order self-assembly within the subcutaneous depot to enhance basal glycemic control. Current products either operate through isoelectric precipitation (insulin glargine, the active component of Lantus ®; Sanofi-Aventis) or employ an albumin-binding acyl tether (insulin detemir, the active component of Levemir ®; Novo-Nordisk). Such molecular engineering has often encountered a trade-off between PK goals and product stability. Given the global dimensions of the diabetes pandemic and complexity of an associated cold chain of insulin distribution, we envisage that concurrent engineering of ultra-stable protein analogue formulations would benefit the developing world, especially for patients exposed to high temperatures with inconsistent access to refrigeration. We review the principal mechanisms of insulin degradation above room temperature and novel molecular approaches toward the design of ultra-stable rapid-acting and basal formulations...|$|E

40|$|Aims. To {{study the}} {{dynamics}} of body weight, waist circumference, blood lipid and insulin demand in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T 2 DM) during first year of combined treatment with metformin and insulin analogues, compared with insulin analogue monotherapy. Materials and Methods. We examined 78 patients with T 2 DM on newly initiated insulin therapy, including 54 females and 24 males. Median age was 56 [51. 0; 64. 0] years, median disease duration – 9 [6. 8; 14. 0] years. Participants were subdivided in two groups. First group was comprised of 48 subjects (33 females and 15 males), who received monotherapy with insulin analogues (glargine, de- temir, biphasic Aspart 30 and <b>Humalog</b> Mix 25 or rapid-acting lispro and aspart). Second group included 30 patients (18 females and 12 males), who were treated with combined therapy (insulin analogues plus metformin). We measured HbA 1 c, plasma lipid composition, BMI, waist circumference and insulin demand initially and after one year of follow-up. Results. We showed that combined therapy vs. insulin monotherapy allows better glycemic compensation while reducing insulin demand and lowering risks for weight gain. Conclusions. Combined insulin analogue plus metformin treatment delivers better metabolic control in patients with T 2 DM and is as- sociated with lower risks for body weight gain and increase in insulin demand against monotherapy with insulin analogues...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} whether insulin treatment-induced weight gain had an adverse impact on cardiovascular risk factors in insulin-treated type 2 diabetic patients during the first year after initiating insulin therapy when insulin analogues or human insulins are used. A total of 157 patients with newly insulinized type 2 diabetes were included in the study. The patients were divided in two groups. First group consisted of subjects (mean age 57 [45; 73], duration of diabetes of 10 years [4; 16]) who had received long-acting basal (glargine, detemir), premixed (biphasic insulin aspart 30, <b>Humalog</b> Mix 25) or short-acting (aspart, lispro) insulin analogues. Patients from second group (mean age 59 [46; 75], duration of diabetes of 10 years [5; 15]) were treated with intermediate-acting basal (Protophane, Humulin NPH insulin), premixed (biphasic human insulin 30, Humulin M 3) and regular (Actrapid, Humulin R) human insulins. Our study has shown that insulin-induced weight gain may not adversely affect cardiovascular risk factors, particularly, lipid profile, in insulin-treated type 2 diabetic patients during the first year after initiating insulin therapy. Use of insulin analogues for treatment of type 2 diabetes patients results in better glycaemic control, significant declines in blood lipid concentrations, less increase in waist circumference compared with human insulins during the first year after initiating insulin therapy...|$|E
40|$|With {{the help}} of {{advances}} in nanotechnology, metal nanostructures have attracted much interest in various areas. Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy is gaining high interest with new fabrication techniques and may find potential applications in biology and medicine. A possibility of SERS to see the difference between proteins with small structural changes, such as difference between human insulin (Humulin) and its artificial substitute <b>Humalog</b> or phosphorylation detection of 13 -mer peptides, is demonstrated using semicontinuous silver film as an active substrate. A good quality spectrum could be obtained for as low as 25 amol of proteins, which makes it more suitable for applications in biology. The detection limit can be further improved by using a mixture of protein and polymer. The high sensitivity is mostly due to the high local fields, which are created in the gaps between particles. An investigation of nonlinear optical properties of colloids of silver nanoparticles using self-rotation of ellipse, Optical Kerr Effect (OKE), and Inverse Faraday Effect (IFE) also suggests that the biggest contribution to the enhancement of local field is coming from small clusters of particles, which are brought {{close to each other}} rather then big aggregates (100 – 1000 particles). A model of a Spherical Quantum Well have been implemented for describing two-photon excited luminescence from metal nanoparticles and shows a good agreement in experiment with colloid of silver nanoparticles. The results suggest that SERS is a powerful tool for numerous biological applications such as protein secondary structure and phosphorylation detection. ...|$|E
40|$|Objective: We {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the basal rate and bolus doses {{in children and adolescents}} at the start of insulin pump therapy and after 1 year of use. Patients and Methods: Case records from 29 children and adolescents were examined. All pumps were started with rapid-acting insulin (<b>Humalog).</b> Patients were aged 13. 1 ± 3. 9 years, with a diabetes duration of 5. 4 ± 4. 1 years at pump start. Sixteen pumps were started for high hemoglobin A 1 c (HbA 1 c;> 8. 8 %, 73 mmol/mol) and 13 for other reasons. Results: Basal rates declined in both groups by 20 % at 3 days after pump start. The bolus doses were reduced by 25 – 30 % when the indication was high HbA 1 c and by 15 % in the others. After 1 year, {{there was a significant difference}} in the basal rate between age groups. The 3 – 9 -year-old age group had higher basal rates during the late evening (10 : 00 PM– 12 : 00 AM), while the 15 – 21 -year-old age group had higher basal rates in the early morning (3 : 00 AM– 7 : 00 AM). Conclusions: Insulin doses are reduced considerably when starting with a pump in pediatric practice. Younger children needed higher basal rates late in the evening (reversed dawn phenomenon), while older teenagers seem to need an increase in the morning, which may correspond to a true dawn phenomenon...|$|E
40|$|Aim of the study. To assess {{dynamics}} of glycated hemoglobin levels and insulin doses per kg bw {{in children and}} adolescents with poorly controlled type 1 diabetes mellitus using insulin pumps. Materials and methods. Retrospective analysis of HbA 1 c levels and insulin doses per kg bw in children aged 2 - 17 years with DM 1 (mean duration 5. 3 ± 3. 1) before and 18 months after onset of insulin pump therapy (Medtronic Minimed 712 and 722) with a short-acting insulin analog Novopramid (Novo Nordisk) or <b>Humalog</b> (Ely Lilly) given to 55 (52, 4 %) and 50 (47, 6 %) of the patients respectively. НbА 1 с level and mean daily insulin dose per kg bw were determined when a patient visited the doctors office every 3 months. Results. Insulin pump therapy in patients with initially poorly controlled DM 1 resulted in a decrease of HbA 1 c from 9. 8 ± 0. 8 to 7, 8 ± 0, 5 % within 18 months after its beginning (p< 0, 05) in the absence of severe hypoglycemia and ketoacidosis requiring hospitalization. Simultaneously, mean daily insulin requirement reduced especially in patients aged 15 - 18 yr (p< 0, 05). None of the patients wished to discontinue insulin pump therapy during the study and after its completion. Conclusion. Insulin pump therapy is an efficacious tool for the improvement of metabolic control {{in children and adolescents}} with poorly compensated CD 1 regardless of age and duration of the disease...|$|E
