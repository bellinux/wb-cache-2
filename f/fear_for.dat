50|$|The direct {{psychological}} {{effects of}} IPV may contribute {{directly to the}} development of these disorders. In Humphreys’ and Thiara’s study, 60% of the women interviewed <b>feared</b> <b>for</b> their life, 69% <b>feared</b> <b>for</b> their emotional wellbeing, and 60% <b>feared</b> <b>for</b> their mental health. Some of the women discussed an undermining of their self-esteem, as well as an “overwhelming fear and erosion of their sense of safety.” Johnson and Ferraro (2000) refer to this overwhelming fear as “intimate terrorism,” decimating a women’s sense of security and contributing to a worsening psychological state.|$|R
5|$|More than 1,000schools {{and churches}} were {{converted}} to emergency shelters, but residents only occupied 47 of them before the storm's arrival.

UNICEF prepared 4emergency health kits and 1,000water containers and Copa Airlines agreed to fly the supplies to Jamaica on its scheduled August 22 flight, if possible. The World Food Program prepared food stock in nearby Haiti, ready to move them to Jamaica if they were needed, although damage to their airport ultimately prevented their distribution.|$|E
5|$|The final {{steps in}} the shift to empire may have been {{triggered}} by Athens' defeat in Egypt, which challenged the city's dominance in the Aegean {{and led to the}} revolt of several allies, such as Miletus and Erythrae. Either because of a genuine <b>fear</b> <b>for</b> its safety after the defeat in Egypt and the revolts of the allies, or as a pretext to gain control of the League's finances, Athens transferred the treasury of the alliance from Delos to Athens in 454–453BC.|$|E
5|$|The summit {{was held}} in the Olympic Sports Centre, Riga. Roads in the center of Riga were closed down and parking was not allowed at the airport or at several roads, out of <b>fear</b> <b>for</b> car bombs. About 9000 Latvian police {{officers}} and soldiers took care of the Summit's security, while more than 450 other airmen from seven European NATO countries were called upon to ensure a no-fly zone above the summit in an operation called Operation Peaceful Summit. This enhanced ongoing Baltic Air Policing activities with additional aircraft, communications and maintenance support.|$|E

5|$|A {{tattoo on}} his arm {{identifies}} Tom Nero, and the rope still around his neck shows his method of execution. The dissectors, their hearts hardened after years of working with cadavers, are shown {{to have as much}} feeling for the body as Nero had for his victims; his eye is put out just as his horse's was, and a dog feeds on his heart, taking a poetic revenge for the torture inflicted on one {{of its kind in the}} first plate. Nero's face appears contorted in agony and although this depiction is not realistic, Hogarth meant it to heighten the <b>fear</b> <b>for</b> the audience. Just as his murdered mistress's finger pointed to Nero's destiny in Cruelty in Perfection, in this print Nero's finger points to the boiled bones being prepared for display, indicating his ultimate fate.|$|E

When he was elected the state's governor, Margaret became First Lady of the state of Texas and was pregnant with their last child. Her brief tenure came on the cusp of the Civil War, {{at a time when the}} state was torn apart over the debate of whether or not to secede from the United States, while her husband worked in vain to defeat the Texas Ordinance of Secession. There had been an attempt on his life, and angry mobs gathered in the streets near the governor's mansion.

He assures Darth Vader that they will {{together}} turn Luke, now revealed to be Vader's son, to the dark side. Unknown to Vader, the Emperor plans to replace his apprentice with Luke. When Vader brings Luke before his master, the Emperor tempts Luke to join the dark side by appealing to the young Jedi's <b>fear</b> <b>for</b> his friends, whom he has lured into a trap. This leads to a lightsaber duel in which Luke defeats and nearly kills Vader. The Emperor tells Luke to kill Vader and take his place, but Luke refuses and declares himself a Jedi. Enraged, the Emperor attacks Luke with Force lightning. Moved by his son's cries for help, Vader throws the Emperor into the Death Star's reactor shaft, killing him.|$|E

5|$|Macrinus' {{predecessor}} Caracalla {{was murdered}} on April 8, 217, {{during a period}} of war with the Parthians, near Carrhae while traveling en-route to visit a temple. His murderer was Justin Martialus, a soldier who was incensed after being declined the rank of centurion. Martialus was himself cut down by Caracalla's German Guards immediately afterwards, a convenient fact for Macrinus, at the time a Praetorian prefect, who was involved in the assassination. One reason for Macrinus to have intrigued against Caracalla was out of <b>fear</b> <b>for</b> the security of his own life. A story documented by Roman writer Herodian and supported by some later historians details the events leading to Caracalla's death. The story goes that Macrinus, {{in the course of his}} employment, was often tasked with reading dispatches sent to Caracalla for him. One such dispatch detailed a prophecy, perhaps fabricated, from the oracle at Delphi suggesting that Macrinus was destined to kill Caracalla and succeed him as the next emperor.|$|E
5|$|SS-Untersturmführer (second lieutenant) Amon Göth {{arrives in}} Kraków to oversee {{construction}} of Płaszów concentration camp. When {{the camp is}} completed, he orders the ghetto liquidated. Many people are shot and killed {{in the process of}} emptying the ghetto. Schindler witnesses the massacre and is profoundly affected. He particularly notices a tiny girl in a red coat – one of the few splashes of color in the black-and-white film – as she hides from the Nazis, and later sees her body (identifiable by the red coat) among those on a wagon load of corpses. Schindler is careful to maintain his friendship with Göth and, through bribery and lavish gifts, continues to enjoy SS support. Göth brutally mistreats his Jewish maid Helen Hirsch and randomly shoots people from the balcony of his villa, and the prisoners are in constant <b>fear</b> <b>for</b> their lives. As time passes, Schindler's focus shifts from making money to trying to save as many lives as possible. To better protect his workers, Schindler bribes Göth into allowing him to build a sub-camp.|$|E
5|$|The Presbyterian {{majority}} {{was quickly}} {{demonstrated by the}} election of their candidate the Duke of Hamilton as President of the Convention. On 12th March, James landed in Ireland and on 16th March, his Letter to the Convention was read out, demanding obedience and threatening punishment {{for those who did}} not comply. Public anger at the Letter's uncompromising tone meant some Episcopalians stopped attending the Convention, claiming to <b>fear</b> <b>for</b> their safety while others changed sides. Tensions were high, with Edinburgh Castle held by the Duke of Gordon, Dundee recruiting Highland levies for James and fears of an Irish invasion. These factors exaggerated the Presbyterian majority in the Convention which now met behind closed doors guarded by its own troops.|$|E

5|$|The camp housed about 2,000 inmates when it opened. At {{its peak}} of {{operations}} in 1944, {{a staff of}} 636 guards oversaw 25,000 permanent inmates, and an additional 150,000 people passed through the camp in {{its role as a}} transit camp. Göth personally murdered prisoners on a daily basis. His two dogs, Rolf and Ralf, were trained to tear inmates to death. He shot people from the window of his office if they appeared to be moving too slowly or resting in the yard. He shot to death a Jewish cook because the soup was too hot. He brutally mistreated his two maids, Helen Jonas-Rosenzweig and Helen Hirsch, who were in constant <b>fear</b> <b>for</b> their lives, as were all the inmates.|$|E
5|$|The {{novel was}} adapted as the 1993 movie Schindler's List by Steven Spielberg. After {{acquiring}} the rights in 1983, Spielberg {{felt he was}} not ready emotionally or professionally to tackle the project, and he offered the rights to several other directors. After he read a script for the project prepared by Steven Zaillian for Martin Scorsese, he decided to trade him Cape <b>Fear</b> <b>for</b> {{the opportunity to do}} the Schindler biography. In the film, the character of Itzhak Stern (played by Ben Kingsley) is a composite of Stern, Bankier, and Pemper. Liam Neeson was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of Schindler in the film, which won seven Oscars, including Best Picture.|$|E

Amongst them is the scheming Duke of Weselton, and the dashing Prince Hans of the Southern Isles, with whom Anna falls head-over-heels in love.

The Duke brands her a monster. Elsa flees the kingdom, but her suppressed magic engulfs Arendelle in an eternal winter. Reaching the North Mountain, Elsa discards her crown and creates a palace of ice in which to live a solitary life.|$|E

5|$|Jamaica, {{which was}} {{forecast}} {{to bear the}} brunt of Hurricane Dean, underwent the most extensive preparations. The Jamaican government executed long-standing evacuation plans, including converting the country's national arena into a shelter and relocating inmates from two maximum security prisons. Political parties in the island suspended their campaigning for the August 27 national elections, to allow residents to prepare for the storm. Curfews were put in place for parts of the island, while off-duty essential personnel were called back to work. More than 1,000 schools and churches were converted to emergency shelters, but residents only occupied 47 of them before the storm's arrival. Evidently the country's high crime rate led islanders to <b>fear</b> <b>for</b> their belongings should they abandon their homes. UNICEF prepared 4 emergency health kits and 1,000 water containers and Copa Airlines agreed to fly the supplies to Jamaica on its scheduled August 22 flight, if possible. The World Food Program prepared food stocks in nearby Haiti, ready to move them to Jamaica if they were needed. The United Nations Disaster Assessment and Coordination (UNDAC) team tried to reach Jamaica, but only one member arrived before all incoming flights were canceled. The United States confirmed that it would offer aid if it was needed, and the North-West Caribbean Donor Group met to decide what actions would need to be taken.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{significant}} events of Darius's early reign was the slaying of Intaphernes, {{one of the seven}} noblemen who had deposed the previous ruler and installed Darius as the new monarch. The seven had made an agreement that they could all visit the new king whenever they pleased, except when he was with his wife. One evening, Intaphernes went to the palace to meet Darius, but was stopped by two officers who stated that Darius had retired for the night. Becoming enraged and insulted, Intaphernes drew his sword and cut off the ears and noses of the two officers. While leaving the palace, he took the bridle from his horse, and tied the two officers together. The officers went to the king and showed him what Intaphernes had done to them. Darius began to <b>fear</b> <b>for</b> his own safety; he thought that all seven noblemen had banded together to rebel against him and that the attack against his officers was the first sign of revolt. He sent a messenger to each of the noblemen, asking them if they approved of Intaphernes's actions. They denied and disavowed any connection with Intaphernes's actions, stating that they stood by their decision to appoint Darius as King of Kings.|$|E
5|$|Williams {{had wanted}} to make a horror game for eight years prior to Phantasmagoria, and had started to design one on several occasions, but none came to fruition. She felt the {{computer}} game industry and software technology had not yet reached the point where an effective and frightening computer game could be made. As a result, she decided to wait until CD-ROMs were faster and could handle real actors, which she believed was crucial for a horror game because she felt the player {{had to be able to}} empathize with the character to <b>fear</b> <b>for</b> them. Williams had been considering several horror story ideas for years before making the game. In one, the heroine answers a magician's advertisement for an assistant and gets the job, but the magician turns out to be insane. Another was set in the past, with the female protagonist getting involved in the supernatural life of a magician character. That idea evolved into a woman being married to a man who is drawn to a bizarre house that previously belonged to illusionists and is haunted by ghosts. The final story as it appears in the game has a contemporary setting, but combines elements from modern fiction, 19th century literature, and classic horror films of the 1950s.|$|E
