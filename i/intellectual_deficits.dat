50|$|Intellectual {{disability}} (ID), {{also known}} as general learning disability, and mental retardation (MR), is a generalized neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by significantly impaired intellectual and adaptive functioning. It is defined by an IQ score under 70 in addition to deficits in two or more adaptive behaviors that affect everyday, general living. Once focused almost entirely on cognition, the definition now includes both a component relating to mental functioning and one relating to individuals' functional skills in their environments. As {{a result of this}} focus on the person's abilities in practice, a person with an unusually low IQ may not be considered to have intellectually disability. Intellectual disability is subdivided into syndromic intellectual disability, in which <b>intellectual</b> <b>deficits</b> associated with other medical and behavioral signs and symptoms are present, and non-syndromic intellectual disability, in which <b>intellectual</b> <b>deficits</b> appear without other abnormalities. Down syndrome and fragile X syndrome are examples of syndromic intellectual disabilities.|$|E

However, after a few weeks the infant sometimes becomes irritable and has increased muscle tone (hypertonia).

50|$|Children {{with autism}} have an {{impaired}} capability to solve problems, engage in thoughtful and appropriate behaviours, sustain relevant tasks and self-monitor. They lack mentalization or Theory of Mind (ToM) and have sensory, perceptual, cognitive, and <b>intellectual</b> <b>deficits.</b> This suggests {{that children with}} autism have general deficits in the high-order planning and regulatory systems, known as executive functions. Autistic individuals have an enlarged cortex characterized by irregular neuronal growth, a reduced volume of corpus callosum (impairing communication between hemispheres), abnormal structure and function of the frontal lobe, cerebellum, medial temporal lobe, related limbic systems (amygdala and hippocampus), and elevated levels of serotonin.

40|$|An <b>intellectual</b> <b>deficit</b> {{is known}} to exist in populations where extreme poverty is rife and is thus seen {{extensively}} in the lower socio-economic strata of underdeveloped nations. Poverty is a complex entity whose sociological and economic indicators often bear little relevance to the biological agents which can affect the central nervous system. An attempt is made to express poverty in terms of identifiable defects, physiological in nature. Thus adverse socio-economic factors are converted into specific biological entities which, though necessary for adequate development of the brain, are restricted where there is poverty. A number of causative deficiencies, including nutritional, visual, auditory, tactile, vestibular, affective, and other stimuli are postulated. These interact and potentiate one another. Each is capable of an independent action on the brain and examples are given of some sensory deprivations as well as malnutrition and their possible mechanism of action. If the various deficiencies can independently harm the brain, then a number of separate specific functions should be affected; examples are offered. The nature of this <b>intellectual</b> <b>deficit</b> is probably a non-fulfillment of genetic potential of certain specific functions of the brain, which may exhibit limited variations between one community and another, depending on cultural differences. The deleterious effect of this intellectual impairment is seen most clearly in figures of school desertion, for example in Latin America. Analogous data for adults is scarce. ...|$|R

5000|$|There is also {{evidence}} that birth complications {{and other factors}} {{around the time of}} birth (perinatal) can have serious implications on intellectual development. For example, a prolonged period of time without access to oxygen during the delivery can lead to brain damage and mental retardation. Also, low birth weights have been linked to lower intelligence scores later in lives of the children. There are two reasons for low birth weight, either premature delivery or the infant's size is just lower than average for its gestational age; both contribute to <b>intellectual</b> <b>deficits</b> later in life. A meta analysis of low birth weight babies found that there is a significant relationship between low birth weight and impaired cognitive abilities; however, the relationship is small, and they concluded that, although it may not be relevant at an individual level, it may instead be relevant at a population level. [...] Other studies have also found that the correlations are relatively small unless the weight is extremely low (less than 1,500 g) - in which case the effects on intellectual development are more severe and often result in mental retardation.|$|E
50|$|The {{amino acids}} {{phenylalanine}} and tyrosine areprecursors for catecholamines. Both amino acids arefound in high {{concentrations in the}} plasma and brain.In mammals, tyrosine can be formed from dietary phenylalanineby the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase, found in large amounts in the liver. Insufficientamounts of phenylalanine hydroxylase result inphenylketonuria, a metabolic disorder that leadsto <b>intellectual</b> <b>deficits</b> unless treated by dietarymanipulation.Catecholamine synthesis usually is considered, tobegin with tyrosine. The enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase(TH) converts the amino acid l-tyrosine into 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-DOPA). The hydroxylationof l-tyrosine by TH results in the formation ofthe DA precursor l-DOPA, which is metabolized byl-aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AADC; seeCooper et al., 2002) to the transmitter dopamine. Thisstep occurs so rapidly {{that it is difficult}} to measure l-DOPA in the brain without first inhibiting AADC. Inneurons that use DA as the transmitter, the decarboxylationof l-DOPA to DA is the final step in transmitter,However, in those neurons using norepinephrine(also known as noradrenaline) or epinephrine(adrenaline) as transmitters, the enzyme dopamineb-hydroxylase (DBH), which converts DA to yield NE,is also present. In still other neurons in which epinephrineis the transmitter, a third enzyme (phenylethanolamineN-methyltransferase, PNMT) converts NE into Epi. Thus, a cell that uses Epi as its transmitter containsfour enzymes (TH, AADC, DBH, and PNMT), whereasNE neurons contain only three enzymes (lackingPNMT) and DA cells only two (TH and AADC).|$|E

40|$|An <b>intellectual</b> <b>deficit</b> in low {{socio-economic}} strata (S-E) of underdeveloped {{countries is}} widespread. A similar phenomenon is observed in industrialized countries {{and is known}} as socio-cultural retardation (S-CR); one theory holds that it is due to psychosensory deprivation whilst another denies that there {{is in fact a}} deficit, there being only middle class-oriented testing applied to subjects whose skills lie in another direction. Whichever theory is true, in underdeveloped countries the problem is compounded by malnutrition and perennial infection so that the <b>intellectual</b> <b>deficit</b> in these societies may be qualitatively different. This paper sets out {{the point of view of}} a clinical neurologist who believe it likely that the technological Western mode of life entails an organization of the brain which is lacking in subjects in low S-E strata of less sophisticated cultures. These will therefore evince multiple mild deficiencies in specific functions of the brain. The core is thought to be incomplete maturation of neural mechanisms. Examples are given: (1) facial dyspraxia; (2) permanence of primitive reflexes; (3) poor body image and sensory integration: and (4) tactile-perceptual functioning (which in fact showed no deficiency but is given as the type of neuropsychological factor which may show delay). Middle class life in Western society is held to be more complex in absolute terms. This is an important cause of the large number of dropouts from primary education in Latin America, whose school systems are based on middle class values, themselves tailored to the technological age. ...|$|R
