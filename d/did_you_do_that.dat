500|$|Vernon was sampled {{on another}} {{song from the}} album, [...] "Lost in the World" [...] and appears on vocals on [...] "Monster". While there during {{recording}} sessions, he had reportedly recorded 10 tracks. He watched Minaj record her verse, and he too, expressed admiration for Minaj's performance on the song, however he noted that initially {{he had no idea}} who she was. Vernon described the process as highly artistic, stating that the fourteen-hour day recording schedule allowed for a lot of fun and creativity. West, talking about recording the song with Vernon, stated that he was [...] "similar to me, where he just does shit just so people would be like, 'Oh shit, how <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>that?</b> How did that happen?' He's just a really cool guy to be around." ...|$|E
500|$|Andrić felt he {{was destined}} to become a writer. He began writing in {{secondary}} school, but received little encouragement from his mother. He recalled that when he showed her {{one of his first}} works, she replied: [...] "Did you write this? What <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> for?" [...] Andrić published his first two poems in 1911 in a journal called Bosanska vila (Bosnian Fairy), which promoted Serbo-Croat unity. At the time, he was still a secondary school student. Prior to World War I, his poems, essays, reviews, and translations appeared in journals such as Vihor (Whirlwind), Savremenik (The Contemporary), Hrvatski pokret (The Croatian Movement), and Književne novine (Literary News). One of Andrić’s favorite literary forms was lyrical reflective prose, and many of his essays and shorter pieces are prose poems. The historian Wayne S. Vucinich describes Andrić’s poetry from this period as [...] "subjective and mostly melancholic". Andrić’s translations of August Strindberg, Walt Whitman, and a number of Slovene authors also appeared around this time.|$|E

2500|$|Remarkably, Bore {{found the}} middle of the bat time and again, and when the last over started, another 14 runs were needed. Stephen Booth bowled the first ball of the season's last over and Bore scored a boundary. [...] The second ball went to the ropes again, and the third went for two runs. [...] Nottinghamshire needed four more runs from three balls to {{complete}} a remarkable win. Bore blocked the fourth ball and Andy Pick, Nottinghamshire's number 11, walked down the pitch to ask [...] "What <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> for?" [...] "It wasn't in the right place." [...] Bore replied. The next delivery saw Bore launch a blow towards the stands. [...] The crowd and the entire Nottingham team were on their feet and Bore thought, as soon as he'd hit it, [...] "That's it, we've won". However Somerset's Richard Ollis ran in and caught the ball above his head, just ten feet from the boundary. [...] Nottinghamshire had lost by three runs and Bore's innings had been in vain. [...] As Bore related in an interview with Simon Lister [...] "We were stunned. We got in the car and I don't think we spoke a word until we were well past Gloucester. No matter how many times I lie in bed and replay that ball I never score those four runs".|$|E

[...] Being out on the right flank one day, just {{out of sight of}} the troops, I came upon a beautiful covey of grouse. [...] They were so tame I could almost knock them over with rocks, but while the contact thus established made me increasingly anxious for grouse for dinner that night, I could not hit them. [...] So finally, in spite of those orders and with growing appetite, I shot two of them and quickly secreted the evidence of my disobedience by rolling them up in the rain coat I carried on my saddle. [...] The right wing of the command was wildly excited by the shots. [...] The skirmishers thrown out on that side soon discovered my lonely presence and hustled me to Colonel Chambers with the news that no Indians were visible. [...] He very sternly asked. [...] ‘Mr. Strahorn, <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> firing?" [...] Upon my answering, [...] "Yes sir," [...] he still more gruffly asked, [...] "At Indians, or what?" [...] "Not at Indians, Colonel, but at grouse," [...] I answered. [...] "I was so hungry for grouse that I just couldn’t help it, so I’m ready to pay the penalty. [...] What is it?’ [...] Be it remembered that I was in the Colonel’s mess, and he replied quietly on the side, ‘Well, it will make a damn sight of difference whether you got a grouse.’" ...|$|E

5000|$|Erika Brooks Adickman of Idolator {{gave the}} song a {{positive}} review stating that, [...] "The Harajuku Barbie doll reveals a more vulnerable side {{to her in}} this borderline romantic tune—that is until Nicki busts out the repetitive chorus 'How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> shit?'. Musically, 'Right Through Me' is quite a departure from her drum-thumping 'Massive Attack', but it lacks the record-breaking rapper’s signature lyrical playfulness heard in 'Your Love'. Treat your ears to Nicki’s latest and judge for yourself. Every time we hear Nicki sing, “How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> shit?”, we can’t help but think of the Insane Clown Posse’s hilarious lyric in 'Miracles'." [...] Chris Ryan of MTV Buzzworthy gave the song a positive review accepting the change of style by stating [...] "Make no mistake, Nicki's solo singles--'Massive Attack,' 'Check It Out' and 'Your Love'--all have distinct qualities, {{but none of them}} has truly captured Nicki's blinding charisma the way some of her guest verses have. Maybe that's all going to change with 'Right Thru Me.'" [...] Paul Cantor of MTV News commented on the change in pace for Minaj, stating [...] "One thing that's noticeably absent from the song is the different character voices Nicki's become known for. In the cover story of Complex magazine's October issue, she says the voices are something she's pulling back on." ...|$|R
