Thus, subwoofers may be part of a package that includes satellite speakers, may be purchased separately, or may be built into the same cabinet as a conventional speaker system. For instance, some <b>floor</b> <b>standing</b> tower speakers include a subwoofer driver in the lower portion of the same cabinet. Physical separation of subwoofer and [...] "satellite" [...] speakers not only allows placement in an inconspicuous location, but since sub-bass frequencies are particularly sensitive to room location (due to room resonances and reverberation 'modes'), the best position for the subwoofer is not likely to be where the [...] "satellite" [...] speakers are located.|$|E
