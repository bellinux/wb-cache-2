5|$|Nobody {{has ever}} cut {{anything}} from Andrei Rublev. Nobody except me. I made some cuts myself. In {{the first version}} the film was 3 hours 20 minutes long. In the second — 3 hours 15 minutes. I shortened the final version to 3 hours 6 minutes. I am convinced the latest version is the best, the most successful. And I only cut certain overly long scenes. The viewer doesn't even notice their absence. The cuts have in no way changed neither the subject matter nor what was for us important in the film. In other words, we removed overly long scenes which had no significance. We shortened certain scenes of brutality in order to induce psychological shock in viewers, {{as opposed to a}} mere unpleasant impression which would only destroy our intent. All my friends and colleagues who during long discussions were advising me to make those cuts turned out right in the end. It took me some time to understand it. At first I got the impression they were attempting to pressure my creative individuality. Later I understood that this final version of the film more than fulfils my requirements for <b>it.</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not regret at all that the film has been shortened to its present length.|$|E
500|$|In 1931, Heyer {{released}} The Conqueror, {{her first}} novel of historical fiction to give a fictionalized account of real historical events. She researched the life of William the Conqueror thoroughly, even travelling the route that William took when crossing into England. The following year, Heyer's writing took an even more drastic departure from her early historical romances when she released her first thriller, Footsteps in the Dark. The novel's publication coincided {{with the birth of}} her only child, Richard George Rougier, whom she called her [...] "most notable (indeed peerless) work". Later in her life, Heyer requested that her publishers refrain from reprinting Footsteps in the Dark, saying [...] "This work, published simultaneously with my son... was the first of my thrillers and was perpetuated while I was, as any Regency character would have said, increasing. One husband and two ribald brothers all had fingers in <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not claim it as a Major Work." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bernhardt had a {{remarkable}} ability to memorize a role quickly. She recounted in L'Art du Théâtre that [...] "I {{only have to}} read a role {{two or three times}} and I know it completely; but the day that I stop playing the piece the role escapes me entirely... My memory can't contain several parts at the same time, and it's impossible for me to recite off-hand a tirade from Phèdre or Hamlet. And yet I can remember the smallest events from my childhood." [...] She also suffered, particularly early in her career, bouts of memory loss and stage fright. Once, she was seriously ill before a performance of L'Etrangére at the Gaiety Theater in London, and the doctor gave her a dose of painkiller, either opium or morphine. During the performance, she went on stage, but could not remember what she was supposed to say. She turned to another actress, and announced, [...] "If I made you come here, Madame, it is because I wanted to instruct you in what I want done... I have thought about <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not want to tell you today", then walked offstage. The other actors, astonished, quickly improvised an ending to the scene. After a brief rest, her memory came back, and Bernhardt went back on stage, and completed the play.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. It {{was terrible}} {{she seemed to}} feel so. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> was sorry for her. I thought I ought to answer <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> <b>I</b> told her I was sorry, too. I tried not to blame Richard. I don't believe <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> tried not to blame him. She was feeling badly enough without that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, don't tell me {{you have}} had any sorrows," [...] Felix rejoined. [...] "I <b>did</b> n't suppose <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> n't mean to allude to them. I simply meant that you all don't amuse yourselves." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, sir, {{of course}} you will do as you please," [...] Jonas said; [...] "but please to {{remember}} if any harm comes of it, that I strongly advised you not {{to have anything to}} <b>do</b> with <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> my best to dissuade you from trying." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I know {{something}} about it. You see I've never lived very far from <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{a good deal of}} my aunt's business." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{choose to}} name any one. You {{ought to know}} all about <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not doubt but you do. Lady Laura Kennedy is your own cousin." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{suppose it}} is quite sure yet. Indeed, Mr Slow {{said it was not}} quite sure. But I have not allowed myself to doubt <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not doubt it." ...|$|E
5000|$|On {{a hunting}} trip to Zimbabwe he is {{reported}} to have culled several elephants under the Government sanctioned management program. He said of the Zimbabwe hunt: [...] "The fact is <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> hunt <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> legally <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> as part of licensed conservation programs. The tusks belong to the Zimbabwean Government." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "In 1977 we had {{a strong}} public complaint. The people wanted {{something}} <b>done</b> about <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>it.</b> <b>I</b> guaranteed it would be sustained {{for as long as}} necessary and the public supported it. I set the standard <b>and</b> <b>it</b> has been maintained. It is so easy to abandon standards" ...|$|R
60|$|Fyne was {{not willing}} to talk; but as I had been already let into the secret, the {{fair-minded}} little man recognised that I had some right to information if <b>I</b> insisted on <b>it.</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> insist, after the third game. We were yet some way from the end of our journey.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Mr President, pray do {{not make}} a speech here," [...] said my wife. [...] "I shall never {{understand}} <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not think that Jack is much wiser than I am." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We are {{averse to}} the {{purchase}} of negroes from Africa," [...] said the young gentleman, coldly. [...] "My grandfather and my mother have always objected to <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not {{like to think of}} selling or buying the poor wretches." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Hush!' said Theodora; 'I was unbearable. No man {{of sense}} or spirit could be {{expected}} to endure such treatment. But, Percy, I have been very unhappy about <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> hope I am tamer at last, if you will try me again.' ...|$|E
6000|$|After a {{few minutes}} he broke forth again--"Yes, I know that <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not intend to disobey; {{nevertheless}} <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>it.</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not think such awful things would follow--but that does not mend the matter. What shall <b>I</b> <b>do?</b> Snorrie, <b>I</b> think I could gladly lay down my life, if I could give you back once more to your mother." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "If {{you like}} the way it looks, go with <b>it!</b> <b>I</b> liked <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>it!</b> Of course, {{it takes a lot of}} {{experience}} to develop good taste. When one is just starting out it's easy to like something without knowing if it's really good or not. That works some of the time, but an educated opinion usually works better." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I felt that. But you see, Bertha, {{until you}} <b>did</b> accept him, <b>I</b> {{had no right}} to assume that you would do so. At least so <b>I</b> {{understood}} <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not feel that in my position I was called upon to interfere until I learned that you were really in danger of what I considered wrecking your life's happiness." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because I {{had thought}} about <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not think that you have. I am {{prepared}} to resign my office to-morrow; and directly that I can see Mr. Gresham and explain to him what I have done, I shall offer to do so." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think I {{know why}} you did <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not blame you," [...] said Dane. [...] "I shall most clearly {{remember}} that, when I was sick, you saved my life for me, as I think you did again when you helped my comrade to forestall Rideau." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nevertheless {{you must}} say it," [...] she {{answered}} brightly; [...] "you must say it {{and leave me}} to think <b>it.</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> think it. I believe that Elspeth, despite her timidity and her dependence on you, is like other girls at heart, and not more difficult to win.|$|E
25|$|It {{became a}} burden. Some {{people say it}} helped me invent {{the kind of music}} I play, but I don’t know whether it did. It’s just {{something}} I’ve had to learn to live with. It affects your playing style; you can’t feel the strings, and there are certain chords I can’t play. Right at the beginning I was told by doctors: “You won’t be playing guitar.” But I believed <b>I</b> could <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In her {{resignation}} letter, Ussher {{said that}} she had done nothing wrong, but four years later in an article on her blog she said she had nevertheless voluntarily paid the £3,420 in question to HM Revenue and Customs, stating that [...] "Public servants should always be at pains to ensure that they are not only compliant with {{the letter of the law}} but also with the spirit of <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not focus on that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think I {{can suggest}} a better plan," [...] he said gently and tenderly. [...] "Suppose you stay here--as my wife. I've {{always wanted to}} ask you that but I feared it was no use because I knew Louisa would oppose <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not think you would consent if she <b>did</b> not. <b>I</b> think," [...] the doctor leaned forward and took Mary Isabel's {{fluttering}} hand in his, [...] "I think we can be very happy here, dear." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He gave me that. Take it {{with you}} and put some on his hair. He likes <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> so want to help a little," [...] she said, {{slipping}} the pretty flagon into his pocket with such a wistful look Mac never thought of smiling at this very feminine request.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am going}} to pipe for my own pleasure," [...] said her son. [...] "I am used to <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not wish to give it up. It does not matter now whether the cattle hear me or not, and I am sure that my piping will injure no one." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is one thing, {{and that}} is that there is like to be, as he said, plenty of fighting, for I should say that he is just the sort of fellow to give us the chance of <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> think that these Portuguese fellows really mean to fight." ...|$|E
30|$|Well, <b>I</b> {{became aware}} <b>and</b> {{concerned}} about environmental issues {{fifteen years ago}} (…) I was working in a bank that the current financial economic system, if you like, is clearly incompatible with environmental protection or, you know, preventing environmental harm <b>and,</b> so <b>I</b> became interested in <b>it.</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> for the Master’s degree in the balances of economics on the environmental policy in the economics (…) So I just, you know, got more interested in it (Interviewee 6).|$|R
25|$|I'm just shocked. It's unbelievable. I {{feel like}} my dream has come true, the dream I've been dreaming since a little girl has come true. There were points I thought, 'You know what, I don't {{know if this is}} going to happen'. But with the help from my friends and my family, they all kept telling me to believe in myself and keep on <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>and</b> now I'm here and thank you so much to them.|$|R
6000|$|... "I cannot think, Hilda. It did {{not strike}} me {{particularly}} when <b>I</b> heard of <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not give <b>it</b> a thought afterwards. You see, <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not mention it, either {{to you or}} Dr. Leeds, until it flashed across my mind when we were talking. Of course <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not see the advertisement itself, but Miss Simcoe {{told me that there}} had been a good deal of discussion before she answered it, as some of them had thought that it might be a trick." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I have {{contrived}} for you a {{very difficult}} sum. It {{is the most difficult}} one that can be made, with the number of figures contained in <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not think that any of you can do it, but you may try. I shall not be surprised if every answer should contain mistakes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘I mean only this,’ he resumed, ‘that I {{understand}} all, and do {{not blame}} you. I understand how the brave woman must {{look down on the}} weak man. I think you were wrong in some things; but I have tried to understand <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> I do not need to forget or to forgive, Seraphina, for I have understood.’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have no {{ambition}} of that sort," [...] said Nigel, [...] "and if I had, I {{must tell you}} plainly, Lord Dalgarno, I have not the means to do so. I can scarce as yet call the suit I wear my own; I owe <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> riot blush to say so, to the friendship of yonder good man." ...|$|E
60|$|Now I pricked up my ears, for though I {{believed}} {{nothing of}} Zikali's {{story of a}} wonderful Queen, I was always intensely interested in past civilisations and their relics. Also I knew that the old wizard's knowledge was extensive and peculiar, however he came by <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not {{think that he would}} lie to me in this matter. Indeed to tell the truth, then <b>and</b> there <b>I</b> made up my mind that if it were in any way possible, I would attempt this journey.|$|R
6000|$|... 'It is my business, sir, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> am {{paid for}} <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> must <b>do</b> <b>it</b> thoroughly;--and abide in the calling wherein I am called,' he added, in a sadder tone.|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{was just}} <b>it,</b> Doctor, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> feel so ashamed of myself. They thought I looked tired, when <b>I</b> came in, <b>and</b> were silly {{enough not to}} wake me this morning." ...|$|R
