5|$|Both the Bengal slow loris and pygmy slow loris {{are found}} in more than 20 {{protected}} areas, although their populations are either low or insufficiently recorded. The pygmy slow loris is protected in most of its range states: in Cambodia, China, and Vietnam. This makes hunting and capture illegal, and in China and Vietnam, possession and storage are also illegal. Under Vietnamese law it has had {{the highest level of}} wildlife protection since 1992, all exploitation and use of the pygmy slow loris is illegal. However, enforcement is poor while minor penalties have little deterring effect. In terms of <b>international</b> <b>protection,</b> the species was elevated to Appendix I of CITES in 2007. In addition, since October 2001, the European Union prohibits imports for all wild specimens of pygmy slow loris from Laos and Cambodia for conservation reasons.|$|E
5|$|Commercial whaling was {{historically}} {{important for}} the world economy. All species were exploited, and as one type's stock depleted, another type was targeted. The scale of whale harvesting decreased substantially through the 1960s as all whale stocks had been depleted, and practically stopped in 1988 after the International Whaling Commission placed a moratorium which banned whaling for commercial use. Several species that were commercially exploited have rebounded in numbers; for example, gray whales may be as numerous as they were prior to whaling, making it the first marine mammal to {{be taken off the}} Endangered species list. The Southern right whale was hunted to near extinction in the mid-to-late 20th century, with only a small (unknown) population around Antarctica. Because of <b>international</b> <b>protection,</b> the Southern right whale's population has been growing 7% annually since 1970. Conversely, the eastern stock of North Atlantic right whale was extirpated from much of its former range, which stretched from the coast of North Africa to the North Sea and Iceland; it is thought that the entire stock consists of only ten individuals, making the eastern stock functionally extinct.|$|E

25|$|Asylum seekers who request <b>international</b> <b>protection</b> {{under the}} Geneva Convention from a Schengen member state are not issued a {{residence}} permit, but are instead issued, {{within three days}} of the application being lodged, an authorisation {{to remain on the}} territory of the member state while the application is pending or being examined. This means that, whilst their application for refugee status is being processed, asylum seekers are only permitted to remain in the Schengen member state where they have claimed asylum and are not entitled to move freely within other states which compose the Schengen Area. Successful applicants who have been granted <b>international</b> <b>protection</b> by a Schengen member state are issued residence permits which are valid {{for at least three years}} and renewable, whilst applicants granted subsidiary protection by a Schengen member state are issued residence permits valid for at least 1-year and renewable, unless there are compelling reasons relating to national security or public order. Family members of beneficiaries of international or subsidiary protection from a Schengen member state are issued residence permits as well, but their validity can be shorter. Applicants who have been granted temporary protection by a Schengen member state (as well as their reunited family members) are issued residence permits valid for the entire period of temporary protection.|$|E
25|$|In Europe, Porpolomopsis calyptriformis {{is typical}} of waxcap grasslands, a declining habitat due to {{changing}} agricultural practices. As a result, the species is of regional conservation concern {{and is one of}} 33 larger fungi proposed for <b>international</b> <b>protection</b> under the Bern Convention. Porpolomopsis calyptriformis also appears on the official or provisional national red lists of threatened fungi in several European countries, including Austria, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany (Bavaria), Hungary, Italy, Poland, Slovakia, Spain, and Switzerland. In 2008, the Pink Waxcap was featured on a postage stamp issued by the Republic of Ireland.|$|E

25|$|As {{native plants}} of Australia, all Byblis species are protected. Until the year 2000, {{they were also}} given <b>international</b> <b>protection</b> under CITES {{appendix}} II, but {{were removed from the}} list when Australia entered the CITES agreement. Since then trade of the genus has been unregulated outside of Australia. However, due to the sensitivity of the plant, interest in the genus has been restricted to {{a small portion of the}} carnivorous plant hobbyist community. The majority of plant material sold today is produced in cultivation, with the annual B. filifolia and B. liniflora being the most common. Most of the other species must be grown from seed, which is often collected from the wild for this purpose.|$|E
25|$|According to Armenian officials, {{residents}} of Talysh and Madagiz had been evacuated and provided with shelter {{in other parts}} of the region. Armenian and international reporters announced that after Talysh was retaken by Armenian troops, an elderly Armenian couple had been found shot in their home and their corpses had been mutilated. According to these reports, Azerbaijani soldiers also killed another elderly woman. Photographs of corpses with ears cut off revived memories of the atrocities of the 1988–1994 war observed a Le Monde reporter. According to the Russia's leading human rights lawyer, the head of the <b>International</b> <b>Protection</b> Centre Karinna Moskalenko, complaints about these facts of violence against the civilian population are already prepared to be sent to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR). Azerbaijan's Ministry of Defense denied these reports.|$|E

On 27 June 2006, two of Saddam Hussein's lawyers, Ramsey Clark, a former US Attorney-General, and Curtis Doebbler, held a press conference at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., to call for immediate security for all the Iraqi defense lawyers and to complain in a written statement that the trial was unfair, and was being conducted by the American authorities using Iraqis as a front. The two lawyers claimed that the United States had refused to provide adequate protection for the defense lawyers despite repeated requests that were made and that the United States was intentionally ensuring an unfair trial.|$|E

500|$|Along the North American coast {{south of}} Alaska, the sea otter's range is discontinuous. A remnant {{population}} survived off Vancouver Island into the 20th century, but it died out despite the 1911 <b>international</b> <b>protection</b> treaty, {{with the last}} sea otter taken near Kyuquot in 1929. From 1969 to 1972, 89 sea otters were flown or shipped from Alaska {{to the west coast}} of Vancouver Island. [...] This population expanded to over 3,200 in 2004, and their range on the island's west coast expanded from Cape Scott in the north to Barkley Sound to the south. In 1989, a separate colony was discovered in the central British Columbia coast. It is not known if this colony, which numbered about 300 animals in 2004, was founded by transplanted otters or by survivors of the fur trade.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{protective}} legislation exists. Several southeastern states, such as Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina have conservation {{laws which}} protect Sarracenia. However, {{most of the}} remaining wetlands in the southeastern U.S. are privately owned. Plants on this land are not protected by state legislation. The key states of Alabama and Mississippi have no such legislation at all, so that even plants on public land have no protection. Three Sarracenia have been listed as [...] "Federally Endangered" [...] under the USA Endangered Species Act (1973) — S.rubra subsp. alabamensis (S.alabamensis) in Alabama, S.rubra subsp. jonesii (S.jonesii) in North and South Carolina, and S.oreophila in Alabama, Georgia, and North Carolina. These taxa are also on CITES Appendix I, giving them <b>international</b> <b>protection</b> by making export of wild-collected plants illegal.
