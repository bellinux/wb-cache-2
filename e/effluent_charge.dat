40|$|Two decades ago, a “command-and-control approach” {{dominated}} {{environmental policy}} and regulations. Individual decision makers were told how {{to comply with}} an input or output standard, rather than being allowed to respond to market signals in the most economical way. Until well into the 1970 s, few market-based instruments for environmental policy existed. Even then, examples were limited to an <b>effluent</b> <b>charge</b> program in Germany, some deposit-refund systems, and— depending on one’s definition of a market-based instrument—performance bonds, which require potential polluters to demonstrate that they can compensate those damaged by their activities. In addition, a few markets were created to protect natural resources, such as transferable quotas for fishing in Canada and Iceland, and transferable development rights for land in the New Jersey Pine Barrens {{and a few other}} locations in the United States. Created markets to protect the environment from pollution were conspicuously absent until 1975 when the U. S. EPA introduced “bubbles ” and other approaches to relaxing economic growth restrictions for areas violating air quality standards under the Clean Air Act (CAA). This “bubble policy ” allows a plan with multiple stacks to meet its emissions limits over all stacks at once rather than each stack separately. Everything changed in 1990 when Congress broke the logjam over legislation to limit acid rain by reducing sulfur dioxide (SO 2) emissions from power plants. Industry opposed the estimated huge cost of a command-andcontrol program, while environmentalists adamantly fought to bring plant emissions under tight control. To end the controversy, Congress and the first Bush administration turned to tradable pollution permits. In the late 1960 s, economists Crocker (1) and Dales (2) first introduced the idea of capping total emissions and allowing polluters to trade them. The idea had gained currency among economists because trading would be far less expensive than a command-and-control regulatory policy and could guarantee environmental improvements if a hard cap on total SO 2 emissions were set and backed up by continuous emissions monitoring. Further, the initial allocation of trad...|$|E

40|$|The {{past few}} years have seen the {{development}} of considerable interest in activities involving the recovery of materials and byproducts from the waste streams of industrial firms and their utilisation, by either the waste-producing firms themselves or other firms, as raw material inputs into production processes. This interest derives, of course, from community concern in the developed nations regarding the problem of environmental pollution. The use of waste recovery and re-use techniques actually reduces the volume of industrial wastes requiring discharge, {{in one form or}} another, into the environment and thus avoids the environmental pollution problems which tend to accompany the waste disposal activities of industrial firms. It would appear however, that waste recovery and re-use techniques have not yet received wide application, with economic considerations apparently playing an important role. This study focusses on the Illawarra region {{as an example of a}} region in which waste recovery and re-use activities have not yet received wide application and investigates the treatment given in the economics literature to these activities, with this investigation being carried out with a view to assessing the contribution that has been made by economists to both the understanding of the particular nature of waste recovery and re-use activities and the stock of policy prescriptions appropriate as a means of inducing an increase in the level and extent of those activities and thus achieving a significant and sustained improvement in environmental quality. A subsidiary aim involved in carrying out this literature review is that of outlining and assessing the current state-of-theart in respect of the treatment of recovery and re-use activities by economists. The thesis is divided into six chapters. Chapter I introduces the study by briefly outlining some of the background of, and justification for, the literature review carried out. Chapter II expands on this brief introduction by considering, and explaining, both the interest which has been expressed in waste recovery and re-use activities in the Illawarra region in recent years and the observation that these activities appear to be 2 ̆ 7 restricted and fragmented 2 ̆ 7. Chapters III and IV present a detailed examination of the economics literature concerned with the analysis of waste recovery and re-use activities. The first of these chapters considers the literature concerned with the inclusion of these activities in analyses relating to the problem of environmental pollution. These analyses have been carried out within the theoretical framework provided by modern welfare economics. The economy-wide perspective of the static and dynamic general equilibrium analysis carried out within this framework reveals that the factors underlying the restricted and fragmented nature of waste recovery and re-use activities basically relate to the existence of a defective system of economic incentives arising out of deficiencies in the operation of market processes. The second chapter referred to above examines the work of those economists who have analysed waste recovery activities by including them within a framework which deals explicitly with that entity known as 2 ̆ 7 the firm 2 ̆ 7. The theoretical and quantitative analysis carried out within this framework indicates that economic factors are seen by economists as playing an extremely important role in the behaviour of firms in relation to waste generation, abatement and discharge activities. The emphasis placed on economic factors in the literature is accompanied by the prescription of policies, particularly the <b>effluent</b> <b>charge</b> strategy, which seek to induce an increase in the amount of materials and by-product recovery carried on through market related means. In view of this Chapter V considers, and evaluates the importance of, problems and difficulties likely to be encountered in any practical implementation of the <b>effluent</b> <b>charge</b> strategy. It is concluded (Chapter VI) that the economics literature has made an important contribution to the understanding of waste recovery and re-use activities as they are carried on in the Illawarra region. The factors making for the particular nature of these activities, however, operate on an economy-wide scale, so that the policies advanced by the literature represent an approach that might be taken by governments at a state or national, rather than regional, level...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1991 Changes in the {{structure}} of the U. S. agricultural industry since World War II have transformed it into a highly productive component of the domestic economy. But these changes have not occurred without indirect costs. For example, the reliance on agricultural chemicals has produced environmental effects causing growing concern. In addition, renewed awareness of and demand for environmental amenities by the general public are changing attitudes towards the agricultural industry and its implicit property rights. This public concern is prompting a growing use of regulatory controls for pollution problems, at a time of greater demands on water resources and declining farm sector population. In this dissertation an examination was made of economic incentives and other mechanisms available to farmers to offset pollution, with particular application to the Willamette Valley of Oregon. A two-part simulation was used, involving a biophysical model designed to simulate crop growth and nutrient flow, and separate economic optimization linear programming models of five representative farms. The output of each of the farm models is an optimal crop rotation mix and an associated set of nutrient outflows. Environmental restrictions and regulations were imposed when conducting policy tests, and changes in profit, crop mix, and physical outputs were recorded to provide a measure of policy effectiveness and cost. Policies tested included <b>effluent</b> <b>charges,</b> an input tax, per-acre standards, a required use of no-tillage, and a fall fertilizer ban. The results indicate that the availability of production options on each farm influences policy effectiveness and the cost of achieving pollution abatement. Nevertheless, some abatement is possible on all farms for relatively little cost. Of the policy measures, <b>effluent</b> <b>charges</b> provide abatement at least cost, although specific levels of abatement may not be attainable. When a farm is subject to multiple pollution problems, control of one type of pollutant may exacerbate other problems.

Materials balances were then drawn up for major polluting activities to determine the residuals that would be produced and discharged to the environment if there were not controls. An environmental impact and management model, structured as al inear programming model, was used to evaluate environmental management strategies. The model incorporated various production processes and residuals treatment methods. Air and water quality simulation models were applied to assess environmental impacts and generate model constraints. Several dimesnsions of environmental management strategies were analyzed including alternative production processes, waste treatment methods, and various implementation incentives such as <b>effluent</b> <b>charges,</b> <b>effluent</b> standards and effects of legal restructions. This report was submitted in fulfillment of Contract No. R- 803203 by the Utah Water Research Laboratory, Utah State University under the sponsorship of the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency. This report covers the period July 22, 1974 to january 31, 1977, and was completed as of February 21, 1977...|$|R
40|$|Environmental {{policies}} typically {{combine the}} identification of a goal with some means to achieve that goal. This chapter focuses exclusively on the second component, the means [...] the "instruments" [...] of environmental policy, and considers, in particular, experience {{around the world with}} the relatively new breed of economic-incentive or market-based policy instruments. I define these instruments broadly, and consider them within four categories: charge systems; tradable permits; market friction reductions; and government subsidy reductions. Within charge systems, I consider <b>effluent</b> <b>charges,</b> deposit-refund systems, user charges, insurance premium taxes, sales taxes, administrative charges, and tax differentiation. Within tradeable permit systems, I consider both credit programs and cap-and-trade systems. Under the heading of reducing market frictions, I examine market creation, liability rules, and information programs. Finally, under reducing government subsidies, I review a number of specific examples from around the world. By defining market-based instruments broadly, I cast a large net for this review of applications. As a consequence, the review is extensive. But this should not leave the impression that market-based instruments have replaced, or have come anywhere close to replacing, the conventional, command-and-control approach to environmental protection. Further, even where these approaches have been used in their purest form and with some success, such {{as in the case of}} tradeable-permit systems in the United States, they have not always performed as anticipated. In the final part of the chapter, I ask what lessons can be learned from our experiences. In particular, I consider normative lessons for design and implementation, analysis of prospective and adopted systems, and identification of new applications. ...|$|R
40|$|The German meat {{industry}} produces 140, 000 tonnes of raw salted products {{annually from}} 120 companies. This production yields 14, 000 m 3 of highly laden organic and anorganic brine solutions which, by and large, is disposed of down the sewerage system. Municipalities levy surcharges for highly polluted waste streams {{and the introduction}} of brine into the sewerage system incurs <b>effluent</b> <b>charges</b> of 180 DM/m 3 on average. In the medium term, charges of 300 to 900 DM/m 3 can be predicted. The reason for these costs are the two variants for the utilisation of brine solutions which are being proposed and discussed. Variant I involves the drying of the brine with usage the residue as landfill in mines. This first variant is standard for liquid effluent and incurs costs of ca. 280 DM/m 3. Variant II is directed at material utilisation of common salt contained in the brine. The necessary method for this variant was developed in our laboratory experiments. The estimated costs here are ca. 210 DM/m 3. P ossible utilisation routes for the solid materials and the purified common salt were proposed. For both variants, the costs of treating the brine-specific effluent were compared. According to the comparisation, the treatment of brine from business having high pollution surcharges is to an increasing degree becoming economical. Whether a company producing brine waste can reduce effluent costs by using one of the proposed variants depending on many industrial factors and must be proven for each individual case...|$|R
40|$|As an {{alternative}} to the “command-and-control” approach, increasing enthusiasm for market-based instruments (MBI) in environmental management arose in the early 80 s. It was hoped that MBI, including packaging taxes, <b>effluent</b> taxes and <b>charges,</b> capital or operation subsidies, tradable permits, deposit-refund schemes, performance bonds, liability instruments, and many others, would reduce the cost of achieving environmental goals and distribute resources in more efficient ways. The 1992 Rio Declaration on Environment and Development endorsed the use of MBIs as an important [...] ...|$|R
