30|$|Based on {{the motivations}} stated previously, we {{concentrate}} on {{a solution to}} the incomplete <b>educational</b> data <b>clustering</b> task in an academic credit system. In particular, we define a kernel-based vector quantization approach to effectively <b>clustering</b> incomplete <b>educational</b> data where incompleteness can be present in any data record at any dimension. Indeed, this work is an extended version of the work previously proposed in [24] where we focused on an effective algorithmic framework for incomplete <b>educational</b> data <b>clustering</b> and illustrated the applicability of the framework with the two proposed algorithms: K_nps and S_nps. K_nps followed the partitioning approach while S_nps did the neural network-based approach. Both of them utilized the nearest prototype strategy for incomplete data updates while do clustering within our proposed algorithmic framework. Like K_nps and S_nps, this work is also based on the proposed framework in [24]; however, defines a new approach using kernel-based vector quantization proposed in [10] and the nearest prototype strategy to handle the ubiquity of incomplete data. The resulting algorithm, named VQ_fk_nps, is our novel incomplete <b>educational</b> data <b>clustering</b> approach as compared to the algorithms K_nps and S_nps which have been achieved in [24]. As compared to K_nps and S_nps, VQ_fk_nps is capable of forming the groups of the similar students which are the clusters with non-spherical shapes in the data space corresponding to the spherical clusters in the feature space. Via the experimental results on real educational data sets with internal clustering validation measures, VQ_fk_nps is confirmed to outperform several existing approaches and thus, be effective for incomplete <b>educational</b> data <b>clustering.</b> Besides, the incomplete data sets that become completed after the data clustering task can be utilized in other mining tasks such as classification and association analysis.|$|R

The cluster approach can be used is in different areas, but most attention in thie article has been paid to the problems of industrial clusters. At the same time, educational clusters remain to be poorly implemented in practice and, consequently, they are less studied theoretically. The aim of the article is to study the features of formation of educational clusters, to determine the theoretical foundations of the process and to prove the necessity to use the cluster approach in the process of the Ukrainian educational system’s management improvement in modern conditions. The aim of the article has led to the solution of such problems as: to give the definition of “education cluster”; to find out the specifics of the application of the cluster approach in education; to analyze main global trends of the educational sector’s clustering, to determine the classification of <b>educational</b> <b>cluster</b> in the world; to offer functional model of the <b>educational</b> <b>cluster,</b> based on socio-economic interaction of the cluster. The <b>educational</b> <b>cluster</b> is a union of closely related and geographically closely placed educational institutions, which promote joint development and growth of competitiveness of each separate ones. This is aimed at the improvement of innovation and quality of manpower’s training both on the regional and national labor market. It has been proven that the cluster approach of the organization of regional educational institutions transforms the situational contacts between enterprises, institutions and organizations into the system sustainable partnerships, stimulates {{the implementation}} of joint projects, and helps to reduce the total cost of the educational development, science and innovation development. It increases the efficiency of such structure, optimizes the available resources. As a result, the innovation activity of cluster membersis developing. However, there are the important factors such as the improvement of education and training systems of future teachers, its readiness to implement innovations in the region, to support the innovation and methodological sides of the educational process, to create opportunities for innovation and to improve the institutional framework and distribution system of knowledge and technologies. Due to this, the innovative <b>educational</b> <b>cluster</b> has been determined as a voluntary association of geographically close interacting entities, educational institutions, government, banking and private sector, innovative enterprises/organizations infrastructure. Such interaction is characterized by the production of competitive educational, cultural, social services, the availability of the agreed development strategy aimed at the interests of each participant and the region being a territory of cluster’s localization...|$|E
30|$|Nowadays, {{knowledge}} discovered from educational {{data sets}} {{plays an important}} role in educational decision making support. One kind of such knowledge that enables us to get insights into our students’ characteristics is cluster models generated by a clustering task. Each cluster model presents the groups of similar students by several aspects such as study performance, behavior, skill, etc. Many recent <b>educational</b> data <b>clustering</b> works used the existing algorithms like k-means, expectation–maximization, spectral clustering, etc. Nevertheless, none of them considered the incompleteness of the educational data gathered in an academic credit system although incomplete data handling was figured out well with several different general-purpose solutions. Unfortunately, early in-trouble student detection normally faces data incompleteness as we have collected and processed the study results of the second-, third-, and fourth-year students who have not yet accomplished the program as of that moment. In this situation, the clustering task becomes an inevitable incomplete <b>educational</b> data <b>clustering</b> task. Hence, our work focuses on an incomplete <b>educational</b> data <b>clustering</b> approach to the aforementioned task. Following kernel-based vector quantization, we define a robust effective simple solution, named VQ_fk_nps, which is able to not only handle ubiquitous data incompleteness in an iterative manner using the nearest prototype strategy but also optimize the clusters in the feature space to reach the resulting clusters with arbitrary shapes in the data space. As shown through the experimental results on real educational data sets, the clusters from our solution have better cluster quality as compared to some existing approaches.|$|R

30|$|To analyse {{the second}} {{hypothesis}} (the linkage between education and employment is stronger in Switzerland compared to Bulgaria), a measure for the association between school-leaving credentials and subsequent labour market position is required (this {{is referred to as}} linkage strength in the following). Based on a recent analysis of school-to-work linkages in the United States, Germany, and France by DiPrete et al. (2017), a strong linkage is assumed when individuals with the same <b>educational</b> credentials <b>cluster</b> in {{a relatively small number of}} occupations. On the other hand, if individuals with a given educational credential are located in many different occupations, we observe a weak linkage. This theoretical consideration can be measured using entropy-based segregation measurements (Mora and Ruiz-Castillo 2011). Entropy measures are based on the amount of additional information gained by knowing a particular attribute of an individual. For example, entropy-based measures of the education–occupation linkage reflect gains in the ability to predict an occupation if one knows the individual’s educational category. That is, if individuals with a given <b>educational</b> credential <b>cluster</b> in a relatively small number of occupations, the ability to predict one’s occupation by knowing his or her educational category increases significantly. In contrast, if individuals with a given educational credential transition into a wide range of different occupational categories, the ability to predict an individual’s occupation by knowing his or her educational category hardly improves.|$|R

An existing <b>educational</b> <b>cluster</b> is identified at {{the eastern edge of the}} inner city, defined by Church, Du Toit and Pretorius Streets, and Nelson Mandela Drive. This city block and the ones surrounding it contain numerous primary, secondary and tertiary educational institutions in a predominant industrial/automotive precinct. An urban design framework is proposed for the precinct. It is envisioned that the precinct may be developed as a mixed-use urban educational campus. Within the existing city block and the urban framework proposal, the Apollo Centre, located on the corner of Church-and Du Toit Street, is selected for an adaptive re-use intervention. The proposed use is an urban primary school. The Apollo project investigates current pedagogical trends, which informed a concept that is largely defined by the idea of contextual learning within a vertical structure. Transparency and integration of education with the urban environment is at the core of the proposal. The traditional notion of horizontal education is explored in a vertical manner. The existing structure is analyzed and a position taken regarding the adaptive re-use process that informs the design. Precedent Studies include existing schools with{{in the inner city}} of Pretoria as well as local and international schools.
