5|$|Thayer {{observed}} and painted {{a number of}} examples, including the Luna moth caterpillar Actias luna, both in its habitual upside-down feeding position, where its countershading makes <b>it</b> <b>appear</b> flat, and artificially inverted from that position, where sunlight and its inverted countershading combine to make <b>it</b> <b>appear</b> heavily shaded and therefore solid. Thayer obtained a patent in 1902 to paint warships, both submarines and surface ships, using countershading, but failed to convince the US Navy to adopt his ideas.|$|E
5|$|The book {{introduced}} {{the concepts of}} disruptive coloration to break up an object's outlines, of masquerade, as when a butterfly mimics a leaf, and especially of countershading, where an animal's tones make <b>it</b> <b>appear</b> flat by concealing its self-shadowing.|$|E

5000|$|The marks meaning may be {{affected}} when <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> {{in conjunction with other}} articulations. When <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> with a staccato dot, it means non legato or detached. When <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> with an accent mark, because the accent indicates dynamics, the tenuto means full or extra duration.|$|R

5|$|In {{line with}} Müller's advice, Jovanović avoided {{creating}} a sentimental work and focused instead on depicting characters and situations he observed {{during his time}} in the Balkans. This differentiates the painting from other Orientalist paintings of the day, which were based on travel accounts rather than first-hand experience. The art historian Lilien Filipovitch-Robinson notes that the grouping of the figures and their interactions with one another are reminiscent of images of the lamentation over the body of Christ. The right half of the scene recedes into shadow while the brightly illuminated left, where the principal figures are located, appears to expand towards the viewer. Jovanović thus directs the viewer's eye from left to right, foreground to background, through the circular pattern of the groupings as well as the diagonal lines of the peasants' swords. In line with Müller's teachings regarding light and colour, Jovanović adds touches of bright red to give warmth and movement to the scene, making <b>it</b> <b>appear</b> as though it is unfolding before the viewer. The brushwork is varied, ranging from the smooth broad strokes that define the solidity of the walls to quick short ones that make <b>it</b> <b>appear</b> like the figures are in motion.|$|E

5|$|Although bottle pool's origins remain obscure, tournament {{records and}} {{newspaper}} articles {{confirm that the}} game has been played {{since at least the}} late 19th century. A mention appears in an 1894 New York Times newspaper article announcing a 64 player tournament to be played at a certain Hanover Clubhouse in Brooklyn, New York. The game was more well known in the early-to-mid-20th century, during which references to <b>it</b> <b>appear</b> in numerous books and publications including Sinclair Lewis's Main Street. It is also known to have been played by some notable individuals, such as world-renowned quantum chemist and biochemist Linus Pauling.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of {{appearing}} in the series mostly in his armor, Arakawa {{has been focused on}} searching ways to make <b>it</b> <b>appear</b> as Alphonse is expressing emotions despite not having a body. Alphonse has also appeared in materials related to the manga, including video games and light novels that follow his journey. His character has been well received by readers of the series; he has consistently appeared in the top ten series' popularity polls. The character has received positive remarks from critics, with some commending his design and his relationship with Edward.|$|E

5|$|As {{they hide}} {{in a parking}} lot, Kyle {{explains}} to Sarah that an artificial intelligence defense network, known as Skynet, will become self-aware {{in the near future}} and initiate a nuclear holocaust. Sarah's future son John will rally the survivors and lead a resistance movement against Skynet and its army of machines. With the Resistance on the verge of victory, Skynet sent a Terminator back in time to kill Sarah before John is born, to prevent the formation of the Resistance. The Terminator is an efficient killing machine with a powerful metal endoskeleton and an external layer of living tissue that makes <b>it</b> <b>appear</b> human.|$|E
5|$|Bamber and Mugford {{had started}} dating in 1983, {{when she was}} 19 and {{studying}} for a degree in education at Goldsmith's College in London. She had taken a holiday job in Sloppy Joe's, a pizzeria in Colchester, where Jeremy had a bar job in the evenings. Mugford admitted to a brief background of dishonesty. She had been cautioned in 1985 for using a friend's chequebook to obtain goods worth around £700, after it had been reported stolen; she said she and the friend had repaid {{the money to the}} bank. She also acknowledged having helped Bamber, in March or April 1985, steal just under £1,000 from the office of the Osea Road caravan site his family owned; she said he had staged a break-in to make <b>it</b> <b>appear</b> that strangers were responsible.|$|E
5|$|Ben starts {{drinking}} {{and plans to}} commit suicide, but Vivien appears to stop him. He then reconciles with Vivien and Violet's ghosts, who encourage {{him to take the}} child and start a new life away from the house. Before he can leave, Hayden (Kate Mara), with the help of Dallas and Fiona, hangs him from a chandelier, killing him and making <b>it</b> <b>appear</b> like a suicide. Hayden takes the baby, but Constance reclaims the baby with Travis' (Michael Graziadei) assistance. Later, she tells the police that she found Ben after he hanged himself and that Violet must have run off with the baby.|$|E

50|$|The place-name 'Goring' {{is first}} attested in the Domesday Book of 1086, where <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> as Garinges. <b>It</b> <b>appears</b> as Garingies in a charter {{formerly}} {{held in the}} British Museum. The name means 'Gara's people'.|$|R

5|$|Charles I, {{who ruled}} from 1331 to 1357, {{and was the}} son of François Grimaldi's cousin Rainier I, {{significantly}} enlarged the fortress by adding two large buildings: one against the eastern ramparts and the second looking out over the sea. This changed the appearance of the fortress, making <b>it</b> <b>appear</b> more of a fortified house than a fortress. The fortifications remained very necessary, for during the next three decades the fortress was alternately lost and regained by the Grimaldi to the Genoese. In 1341 the Grimaldi took Menton and then Roquebrune, thus consolidating their power and strength in the area. Subsequently they strengthened not only the defences of the harbour but also their fortress on the Rocher. The Grimaldi's stronghold was now a power base from which the family ruled a large but very vulnerable area of land.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth Henstridge portrays Simmons, and {{is joined}} by guest star Dillon Casey as another {{survivor}} stranded on the planet. Series regulars Clark Gregg, Ming-Na Wen, Chloe Bennet, and Iain De Caestecker also briefly appear. The episode was {{a departure from the}} norm for the series, focusing on a single character rather than the usual ensemble, and taking place on an alien planet. The episode was filmed in the Californian desert, with a filtering effect used to make <b>it</b> <b>appear</b> to be night on the planet, as its sun rarely rises. The episode took inspiration from multiple science fiction films, and bears similarity to The Martian, which was released close to the episode's airing.|$|E
5|$|In 1929 {{the company}} asked HM Treasury for an {{extension}} of the period in which government loans to the company could be paid. The Treasury first demanded an audit of the company accounts, and sent Sir William McClintock to write a report on the financial state of the company. McClintock's report revealed that the company had not earned any trading profits since 1925, but was still paying dividends by taking money from the reserves. The company had reported £439,000 profits for 1926, but had drawn £750,000 out of the reserves and falsified accounts to make <b>it</b> <b>appear</b> that the money came from trading. In 1927 the company made a trading loss of £507,000, but money was again drawn from the reserves to make <b>it</b> <b>appear</b> that the company had made a profit of £478,000. As a result of this, and a report that in 1928 the company had issued a fraudulent prospectus inviting customers to buy shares in the company and saying that it had earned an average £500,000 a year in the last decade, arrest warrants were issued for Lord Kylsant and John Moreland, the company auditor. At the time the ruse was discovered the company had a trading deficit of £300,000 a year, the reserves were completely exhausted, and the company owed £10 million.|$|E
50|$|Chatanika first {{appeared}} on the 1910 U.S. Census as an unincorporated village. <b>It</b> did not <b>appear</b> on the 1920 census. <b>It</b> <b>appeared</b> again in 1930 as Chatanika River, but the name was restored to Chatanika in 1940. That {{was the last time}} <b>it</b> <b>appeared</b> on the census to date.|$|R
50|$|The place-name 'Peopleton' {{is first}} attested in a Saxon charter of 972, where <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> as Piplincgtun. <b>It</b> <b>appears</b> as Piplintune in the Domesday Book of 1086. The name means 'the town or {{settlement}} of Pyppel's people'.|$|R
40|$|Sound {{velocity}} in {{each type}} of seafloor sediment from the South China Sea varies {{with the development of}} strain in the controlled stress-strain course. Experiments show that there may exist three cases for the maximum sound velocity: (1) <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> at the stress peak; (2) <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> in the phase of no load; and (3) <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> {{at the end of the}} strain course. These results are related to physical-mechanical properties and structure of sediments...|$|R
5|$|On 17 December, {{orders for}} the {{complete}} evacuation of the peninsula were issued. The regiment started leaving the next day, when six officers and 155 other ranks left for Lemnos before dawn. Those left behind had to make <b>it</b> <b>appear</b> that the trenches were fully occupied. At 21:30 {{two thirds of the}} remainder were evacuated. Other smaller parties left the trenches between 01:40 and 02:05, when the last officer and eleven other ranks moved down to the beach and were evacuated. The surviving 375 men of the regiment camped on Lemnos until transport was available to take them back to Egypt. Their involvement in the Gallipoli Campaign had cost the regiment a total of 640 casualties.|$|E
5|$|Stephen Stickler {{acted as}} the band's photographer, and Jay Papke and Dante Ariola {{directed}} the album's cover art and booklet. The cover depicts {{a little girl}} in a purple dress with a matching bow in her blonde hair, bringing her swing to a stop to squint in the sun at the man standing before her. The man is only seen as a dark shadow on the ground, and is holding {{what appears to be a}} horse shoe or, more presumably, blades. The band's logo, a childlike drawing of the band's name created by lead singer Jonathan Davis, is seen on the sandy ground by Dark Shadow; the way it's positioned next to the girls' shadow makes <b>it</b> <b>appear</b> the latter is being hanged.|$|E
5|$|The Chronicles {{version of}} events makes <b>it</b> <b>appear</b> that Baldred was driven out shortly after the battle, but this was {{probably}} not the case. A document from Kent survives which gives the date, March 826, as being {{in the third year}} of the reign of Beornwulf. This makes it likely that Beornwulf still had authority in Kent at this date, as Baldred's overlord; hence Baldred was apparently still in power. In Essex, Ecgberht expelled King Sigered, though the date is unknown. It may have been delayed until 829, since a later chronicler associates the expulsion with a campaign of Ecgberht's in that year against the Mercians.|$|E

50|$|The place-name 'Whitgift' {{is first}} attested in a Yorkshire charter of circa 1080, where <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> as Witegift, {{and in a}} charter of 1232 where <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> as Whitegift. The name is thought to mean 'Hviti's or Hwita's gift'.|$|R
