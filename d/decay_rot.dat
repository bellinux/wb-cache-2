Every week after the inoculation, the moisture content, the weight loss and the impact bending strength were investigated. Samples with the same incubation time were ground up, and their solubility in 1 % NaOH was calculated. During the course of decay, the moisture content increased more rapidly in samples <b>decayed</b> by brown <b>rot</b> fungi than in samples <b>decayed</b> by white <b>rot</b> fungi. After an incubation time of seven days when, in many cases, the weight loss was negligible, there was already a substantial loss in strength. For high weight losses, the samples <b>decayed</b> by brown <b>rot</b> fungi had lost more of their strength than those <b>decayed</b> by white <b>rot</b> fungi.

Fruit of three maturity stages such as mature green (mature but green in color), half ripen (breaker stage when fruit turns to yellow) and full ripen (yellow and soft, edible stage) were kept under three different conditions; open condition (control), covering with white polythene and finally treatment by CaC 2 + polythene. High and significant variation was observed in quality characteristics under different harvesting stages, storage conditions and their combinations. The highest value for rotting and total sugar content was distinguished in full ripens tomato. The highest weight loss and shelf life was measured in mature green.
