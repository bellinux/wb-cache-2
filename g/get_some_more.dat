On 18 May, Rommel made the French give up Cambrai by merely feinting an armoured attack.|$|E
25|$|In 1983 The Faith {{released}} an eight-song twelve inch EP called Subject to Change. It {{was produced by}} Ian MacKaye and showed the band progressing into more melodic territory {{with the addition of}} a second guitarist. Eddie Janney, formerly of the Untouchables and Ian MacKaye's short-lived Skewbald/Grand Union, joined The Faith at the end of 1982 to play second guitar and made his recorded debut. The addition was made because they wanted to <b>get</b> <b>some</b> <b>more</b> complex guitar ideas into the songs and soften the impact of guitar malfunctions, which were a constant threat during good shows. Not to mention, they just wanted a fuller sound and liked the way Eddie played.|$|E
25|$|It {{was a year}} of fire tiger in Jinki (the year 726). A monk {{from the}} Kii Province, Tōkōbō Yūkei was journeying in Adachigahara when the sun was about to set, and {{requested}} {{to be allowed to}} stay in a cave for lodging. An old lady lived in that cave. The old lady who seemed to have kindly let in Yūkei then left the cave telling Yūkei that there was not enough firewood and she needed go outside to <b>get</b> <b>some</b> <b>more</b> but that during this time Yūkei must not look in the room further in. However, Yūkei opened the shutter out of curiosity, and when he peeked inside, there was a mountain of human bones piled up inside. Dumbfounded by this sight, Yūkei recalled a rumor of an onibaba at Adachigahara who would kill travelers and devour their blood and meat, and he got the feeling that this old lady was the rumored onibaba, so he fled the cave.|$|E

Also around this time, Brown's back catalogue was re-released by Sanctuary Records.|$|R

25|$|Much of the {{evidence}} entered against her was from events that had happened {{five or ten years}} previous. Phillip and Sarah Nelson testified that Robert Shilleto (by then deceased, so he could not affirm or deny the story) had repeatedly complained that Margaret was a witch, afflicting him until he died. Jonathan Burbank, Captain Daniel Wycomb and Frances Wycomb testified that Margaret had come to Burbank's house, asking for corn from his field. (By this time, she had long been widowed.) Burbank initially asked her to wait until he retrieved it from his field, but when she persisted, his wife gave her some. Later, when he went to <b>get</b> <b>some</b> <b>more</b> corn out of the field, his oxen refused to move, which he attributed to Margaret's bewitching of them. Similarly, Thomas Nelson testified that Margaret repeatedly came to him for wood, for payment of a debt he owed to her. After he denied her, two of his cows died, which he and his neighbors considered unnatural, causing him to conclude Margaret was a witch.|$|E

UGO Networks' Alex Zalben wrote [...] "Two weeks in, Fringe {{is still the best}} damn show currently on TV". Zalben loved the serial aspects of the plot, praised Anna Torv's performance, but disliked how no one has realized Fauxlivia's true identity. Josh Wigler from MTV enjoyed the episode particularly because although he found the parallel universe a [...] "compelling world, sometimes it's nice to just kick your feet up on the table and know that you're home... Two episodes down, and it's safe to say that the third season of [...] "Fringe" [...] is off to a very strong start". Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly thought it was a terrific episode, with [...] "a tremendously clever game-changer of an ending...This Fringe was {{a good example of how}} far the series has come since its first season, dominated by pre-credits scare-scenarios for Fringe Division to investigate, some of which spilled over into the show's mythology. Now, Fringe is a seamless whole".|$|E
2500|$|By {{the end of}} the 18th century a new room in the pub was established: the saloon. Beer establishments {{had always}} {{provided}} entertainment of some sort—singing, gaming or sport. Balls Pond Road in Islington was named after an establishment run by a Mr Ball that had a duck pond at the rear, where drinkers could, for a fee, go out and take a potshot at the ducks. More common, however, was a card room or a billiard room. The saloon was a room where for an admission fee or a higher price of drinks, singing, dancing, drama or comedy was performed and drinks would be served at the table. From this came the popular music hall form of entertainment—a show consisting of a variety of acts. A most famous London saloon was the Grecian Saloon in The Eagle, City Road, which is still famous because of a nursery rhyme: [...] "Up and down the City Road / In and out The Eagle / That's the way the money goes / Pop goes the weasel." [...] This meant that the customer had spent all his money at The Eagle, and needed to pawn his [...] "weasel" [...] to <b>get</b> <b>some</b> <b>more.</b> The meaning of the [...] "weasel" [...] is unclear but the two most likely definitions are: a flat iron used for finishing clothing; or rhyming slang for a coat (weasel and stoat).|$|E

They consist of a long {{electric}} line or are made of discrete inductors and capacitors, which are arranged in a chain.
