This paper proposes a systematic and visual <b>dependency</b> analysis method based on VHDL. The <b>dependency</b> relationships including control <b>dependency,</b> data <b>dependency,</b> signal control <b>dependency</b> and signal data <b>dependency</b> are defined. The entity <b>dependency</b> graph is presented and its generation algorithm, which searches the <b>dependency</b> relationships in hardware processes and between hardware processes, are developed. The experiment of a typical keyboard demonstrates {{that it is a}} visual and efficient method to analyze <b>dependency</b> relationships of VHDL for formal verification...|$|R

A revision <b>dependency</b> parser may learn {{a set of}} transformation rules that may be applied to <b>dependency</b> parse trees generated by a base parser for revising the <b>dependency</b> parse trees. A corpus of natural language sentences {{and a set of}} correct <b>dependency</b> parse trees may be used to train a revision <b>dependency</b> parser to correct <b>dependency</b> parse trees generated by the base parser. A revision engine may compare the <b>dependency</b> parse trees produced by the base parser with the correct ones present in the training data to produce an observation-rule pair for each <b>dependency.</b> A rule may specify a transformation on the predicted <b>dependency</b> parse tree generated by the base parser to replace an incorrect <b>dependency</b> with a corrected <b>dependency</b> or may change the type of <b>dependency</b> expressed for the grammatical function of the dependent word...|$|R
40|$|<b>Dependency</b> {{occurs when}} the {{probability}} of success or failure on one action changes the probability of success or failure on a subsequent action. <b>Dependency</b> {{may serve as a}} modifier on the human error probabilities (HEPs) for successive actions in human reliability analysis (HRA) models. Discretion should be employed when determining whether or not a <b>dependency</b> calculation is warranted: <b>dependency</b> should not be assigned without strongly grounded reasons. Human reliability analysts may sometimes assign <b>dependency</b> in cases where it is unwarranted. This inappropriate assignment is attributed to a lack of clear guidance to encompass the range of scenarios human reliability analysts are addressing. Inappropriate assignment of <b>dependency</b> produces inappropriately elevated HEP values. Lessons learned about <b>dependency</b> usage in the Human Event Repository and Analysis (HERA) system may provide clarification and guidance for analysts using first-generation HRA methods. This paper presents the HERA approach to <b>dependency</b> assessment and discusses considerations for <b>dependency</b> usage in HRA, including the cognitive basis for <b>dependency,</b> direction for determining when <b>dependency</b> should be assessed, considerations for determining the <b>dependency</b> level, temporal issues to consider when assessing <b>dependency,</b> (e. g., considering task sequence versus overall event sequence, and <b>dependency</b> over long periods of time), and diagnosis and action influences on <b>dependency...</b>|$|R

40|$|To {{solve the}} data sparseness problem in <b>dependency</b> parsing, most {{previous}} studies used features extracted from large-scale auto-parsed data. Unlike previous work, we propose {{a novel approach}} to improve <b>dependency</b> parsing with <b>dependency</b> triples (DT) extracted by self-disambiguating patterns (SDP). The use of SDP {{makes it possible to}} avoid the <b>dependency</b> on a baseline parser and explore the influence of different types of DTs one by one. Experiments show that, when DT features are integrated into a maximum spanning tree (MST) <b>dependency</b> parser, the new parser improves significantly over the baseline MST parser. Comparative results also show that DTs with <b>dependency</b> relation labels perform much better than DTs without <b>dependency</b> relation label.

40|$|In real networks, the <b>dependency</b> between nodes is ubiquitous; {{however, the}} <b>dependency</b> {{is not always}} {{complete}} and homogeneous. In this paper, we propose a percolation model with weak and heterogeneous dependency; i. e., <b>dependency</b> strengths could be different between different nodes. We find that the heterogeneous <b>dependency</b> strength will make the system more robust, and for various distributions of <b>dependency</b> strengths both continuous and discontinuous percolation transitions can be found. For Erdős-Rényi networks, we prove that the crossing point of the continuous and discontinuous percolation transitions {{is dependent on the}} first five moments of the <b>dependency</b> strength distribution. This indicates that the discontinuous percolation transition on networks with <b>dependency</b> is determined not only by the <b>dependency</b> strength but also by its distribution. Furthermore, {{in the area of the}} continuous percolation transition, we also find that the critical point depends on the first and second moments of the <b>dependency</b> strength distribution. To validate the theoretical analysis, cases with two different <b>dependency</b> strengths and Gaussian distribution of <b>dependency</b> strengths are presented as examples.
