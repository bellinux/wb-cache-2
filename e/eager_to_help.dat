5|$|The {{narrative}} is episodic and usually focuses on one character at a time. Each {{of the first}} four episodes focuses {{on one of the}} four main characters, depicting social interaction and growth. The anime's use of time travel allows focus on the older versions or children of previously-featured characters, and contrasts their experiences with the protagonists' agelessness. Reviewers have experienced difficulty categorizing the Popotan anime, though it does feature an overall comedic tone. The characters are very lighthearted and <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> new acquaintances. Nudity appears in many episodes, though no sexually explicit scenes occur. Geneon rated the series for ages 16+; Section23 Films gave its re-release a TV-MA rating.|$|E

His father {{died of cancer}} on 11 December 1961, {{less than a month}} before Barrett's 16th birthday. Also on this day, Barrett had left the entry in his diary blank. By this time, his brothers and sisters had left home and his mother decided to rent out rooms to lodgers. <b>Eager</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> her son recover from his grief, Barrett's mother encouraged the band in which he played, Geoff Mott and The Mottoes, a band which Barrett formed, to perform in their front room. Roger Waters and Syd Barrett were childhood friends, and Waters often visited such gigs. At one point, Waters even organised a gig, a CND benefit at Friends Meeting House on 11 March 1962, but shortly afterwards Geoff Mott joined the Boston Crabs, and the Mottoes broke up.|$|E

25|$|Throughout {{the rest}} of the war, {{relations}} between Kennedy and the Roosevelt Administration remained tense, especially when Joe Jr. vocally opposed President Roosevelt's unprecedented nomination for a third term, which began in 1941. Kennedy may have wanted to run for president himself in 1940 or later. Having effectively removed himself from the national stage, Joe Sr. sat out World War II on the sidelines. Kennedy stayed active in the smaller venues of rallying Irish-American and Roman Catholic Democrats to vote for Roosevelt's re-election for a fourth term in 1944. Former Ambassador Kennedy claimed to be <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> the war effort, but {{as a result of his}} previous gaffes, he was neither trusted nor invited to do so.|$|E

25|$|In 209 BCE, {{during the}} reign of Qin Er Shi, peasant rebellions erupted {{throughout}} China to overthrow the Qin dynasty, plunging China into a state of anarchy. Yin Tong, the Administrator of Kuaiji (then centered on present-day Suzhou), wanted to start a rebellion as well, so he invited Xiang Liang to meet him and discuss their plans. However, the Xiangs lured Yin Tong into a trap and killed him instead, with Xiang Yu personally striking down hundreds of Yin's men. Xiang Liang initiated the rebellion himself and rallied about 8,000 men to support him. Xiang Liang proclaimed himself Administrator of Kuaiji while appointing Xiang Yu as a general. Xiang Liang's revolution force grew in size until it was between 60,000 and 70,000. In 208 BCE, Xiang Liang installed Mi Xin as King Huai II of Chu to rally support from those <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> him overthrow the Qin Dynasty and restore the former Chu state. Xiang Yu distinguished himself as a competent marshal and mighty warrior on the battlefield while participating in the battles against Qin forces.|$|E

500|$|Grant had {{continued}} studying Crowley's work, {{and a year}} after Crowley's death was acknowledged as a Ninth Degree member of the O.T.O. by Karl Germer, Crowley's successor as Head of the O.T.O. Grant then successfully applied to Germer for a charter to operate the first three O.T.O. degrees and run his own lodge, which was granted in March 1951. As this would mean that his lodge {{would be the only}} chartered O.T.O. body in England at the time, Grant believed that it meant that he was now head of the O.T.O. in Britain. Germer put Grant in contact with Wilfred Talbot Smith, an English Thelemite based in California who had founded the Agape Lodge, knowing that Smith was the only man who had practical knowledge of the O.T.O. degree work.

Perhaps we may be permitted to sing his own hymn along with him some day before the throne. No wonder that we love the words of Ramanisa. They called him Josiah when he was baptized, but he was Ramanisa when the Lord called him, and I think that is the name that is written in the Book of Life." ...|$|R

40|$|Cross-national {{comparative}} {{research on the}} impact of stigma beliefs on actual mental health service use in the general population is limited. This article separates dominant cultural stigma beliefs from personal stigma beliefs and estimates the effects of both on different types of service use in a large set of European countries, net of the effect of need. Data are derived from the Eurobarometer 64. 4 on mental well-being. Logistic multilevel regression techniques are used. The results reveal that personal stigma beliefs are associated with reduced service use. Moreover, in countries with more cultural stigma beliefs people are less <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> seek professional <b>help</b> for mental health problems in general, and from mental health specialists in particular, irrespective of their personal beliefs. Finally, persons with higher needs are using fewer services from general practitioners and psychiatric nurses/social workers in countries with more cultural stigma beliefs...|$|R

2500|$|Venizelos' {{greatest}} {{achievement in}} foreign policy during this period was the reconciliation with Turkey. Venizelos had expressed his will to improve the bilateral Greek–Turkish relations even before his electoral victory, {{in a speech in}} Thessaloniki (July 23, 1928). Eleven days after the formation of his government, he sent letters to both the prime minister and the minister of foreign affairs of Turkey (İsmet İnönü and Tevfik Rüştü respectively), declaring that Greece had no territorial aspirations to the detriment of their country. İnönü's response was positive and Italy was <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> the two countries reach an agreement. Negotiations however stalled because of the complicated issue of the properties of the exchanged populations. Finally, the two sides reached an agreement on April 30, 1930; on October 25, Venizelos visited Turkey and signed a treaty of friendship. Venizelos even forwarded Atatürk's name for the 1934 Nobel Peace Prize, highlighting the mutual respect between the two leaders. The German Chancellor Hermann Müller described the Greek-Turkish rapprochement as the [...] "greatest achievement seen in Europe {{since the end of the}} Great War". Nevertheless, Venizelos' initiative was criticized domestically not only by the opposition but also by members of his own party that represented the Greek refugees from Turkey. Venizelos was accused of making too many concessions on the issues of naval armaments and of the properties of the Greeks who were expelled from Turkey according to the Treaty of Lausanne.|$|E
