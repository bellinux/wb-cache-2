40|$|A Search for Extraterrestrial Life (SETI), {{based on}} the {{possibility}} of interstellar communication via laser signals, is being designed to extend the search into the near-infrared spectral region (Wright et al, this conference). The dedicated near-infrared (900 to 1700 nm) instrument takes advantage {{of a new generation of}} avalanche photodiodes (APD), based on internal discrete amplification. These discrete APD (DAPD) detectors have a high speed response ($>$ 1 GHz) and gain comparable to photomultiplier tubes, while also achieving significantly lower noise than previous APDs. We are investigating the use of DAPD detectors in this new astronomical instrument for a SETI search and transient source observations. We investigated experimentally the advantages of using a multiple detector device operating in parallel to remove spurious signals. We present the detector characterization and performance of the instrument in terms of false positive detection rates both theoretically and empirically through lab measurements. We discuss the required criteria that will be needed for laser light pulse detection in our experiment. These criteria are defined to optimize the trade between high detection efficiency and low false positive coincident signals, which can be produced by detector dark noise, background light, cosmic rays, and astronomical sources. We investigate experimentally how <b>false</b> <b>coincidence</b> rates depend on the number of detectors in parallel, and on the signal pulse height and width. We also look into the corresponding threshold to each of the signals to optimize the sensitivity while also reducing the <b>false</b> <b>coincidence</b> rates. Lastly, we discuss the analytical solution used to predict the probability of laser pulse detection with multiple detectors. Comment: Proceedings of SPIE, 9147 - 17...|$|E
40|$|Coalescing compact binary systems {{consisting}} of neutron stars and/or black holes should be detectable with upcoming advanced gravitational-wave detectors such as LIGO, Virgo, GEO and KAGRA. Gravitational-wave experiments {{to date have}} been riddled with non-Gaussian, non-stationary noise that makes it challenging to ascertain the significance of an event. A popular method to estimate significance is to time shift the events collected between detectors {{in order to establish}} a <b>false</b> <b>coincidence</b> rate. Here we propose a method for estimating the false alarm probability of events using variables commonly available to search candidates that does not rely on explicitly time shifting the events while still capturing the non-Gaussianity of the data. We present a method for establishing a statistical detection of events in the case where several silver-plated (3 [...] 5 σ) events exist but not necessarily any gold-plated (> 5 σ) events.

40|$|We are {{designing}} and constructing a new SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) instrument {{to search for}} direct evidence of interstellar communications via pulsed laser signals at near-infrared wavelengths. The new instrument design builds upon our past optical SETI experiences, and {{is the first step}} toward a new, more versatile and sophisticated generation of very fast optical and near-infrared pulse search devices. We present our instrumental design by giving an overview of the opto-mechanical design, detector selection and characterization, signal processing, and integration procedure. This project makes use of near-infrared (950 - 1650 nm) discrete amplification Avalanche Photodiodes (APD) that have greater than 1 GHz bandwidths with low noise characteristics and moderate gain (~ 10 ^ 4). We have investigated the use of single versus multiple detectors in our instrument (see Maire et al., this conference), and have optimized the system to have both high sensitivity and low <b>false</b> <b>coincidence</b> rates.

40|$|The CODIF {{instrument}} on the Cluster spacecraft is a time-of-flight (TOF) ion mass spectrometer. Although TOF spectrometers {{are relatively}} immune to background contamination {{due to the}} inherent double coincidence requirement, high background rates can still result in <b>false</b> <b>coincidences.</b> Along the Cluster orbit, <b>false</b> <b>coincidences</b> are commonly observed due to the penetrating radiation of relativistic electrons during the encounters with the Earth's radiation belts. A second type of background in these instruments occurs when events of one species fall into the time-of-flight range defined for another species. Although the fraction of the H + events that spill into the He + measurement is small, when the actual He + fluxes are low this can result in significant contamination. In this paper we present two techniques that allow the subtraction of the <b>false</b> <b>coincidences</b> and the H + "spill" from the CODIF measurements...|$|R
40|$|We use an {{analytical}} theory of noisy Poisson processes, {{developed in the}} preceding companion publication, to compare coincidence and covariance measurement approaches in photoelectron and -ion spectroscopy. For non-unit detection efficiencies, coincidence data acquisition (DAQ) suffers from <b>false</b> <b>coincidences.</b> The rate of <b>false</b> <b>coincidences</b> grows quadratically with the rate of elementary ionization events. To minimize <b>false</b> <b>coincidences</b> for rare event outcomes, very low event rates may hence be required.

Covariance DAQ {{on the other hand}} is free of systematic errors as long as stable experimental conditions are maintained. In the presence of noise, all channels in a covariance measurement become correlated. Under favourable conditions, covariance DAQ may allow orders of magnitude reduction in measurement times.

Background signals provoked by pump and/or probe pulses alone often obscure these excited state signals. Simple subtraction of pump-only and/or probe-only measurements from the pump-probe measurement, as commonly applied, results in a degradation of the signal-to-noise ratio and, {{in the case of}} coincidence detection, the danger of overrated background subtraction. Coincidence measurements additionally suffer from <b>false</b> <b>coincidences.</b> Here we present a probabilistic approach based on Bayesian probability theory that overcomes these problems. For a pump-probe experiment with photoelectron-photoion coincidence detection we reconstruct the interesting excited state spectrum from pump-probe and pump-only measurements. This approach allows to treat background and <b>false</b> <b>coincidences</b> consistently and on the same footing. We demonstrate that the Bayesian formalism has the following advantages over simple signal subtraction: (i) the signal-to-noise ratio is significantly increased, (ii) the pump-only contribution is not overestimated, (iii) <b>false</b> <b>coincidences</b> are excluded, (iv) prior knowledge, such as positivity, is consistently incorporated, (v) confidence intervals are provided for the reconstructed spectrum, and (vi) it is applicable to any experimental situation and noise statistics. Most importantly, by accounting for <b>false</b> <b>coincidences,</b> the Bayesian approach allows to run experiments at higher ionization rates, resulting in a significant reduction of data acquisition times.

40|$|Introduction The goal of {{this work}} is to advance the {{production}} and use of 52 Mn (t½ = 5. 6 d, β+: 242 keV, 29. 6 %) as a radioisotope for in vivo preclinical nuclear imaging. More specifically, the aims of this study were: (1) to measure the excitation function for the natCr(p,n) 52 Mn reaction at low energies to verify past results [1 – 4]; (2) to measure binding constants of Mn(II) to aid {{the design of a}} method for isolation of Mn from an irradiated Cr target via ion-exchange chromatography, building upon previously published methods [1, 2, 5 – 7]; and (3) to perform phantom imaging by positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance (PET/MR) imaging with 52 Mn and non-radioactive Mn(II), since Mn has potential dual-modality benefits that are beginning to be investigated [8]. Material and Methods Thin foils of Cr metal are not available commercially, so we fabricated these {{in a manner similar to}} that reported by Tanaka and Furukawa [9]. natCr was electroplated onto Cu discs in an industrial-scale electroplating bath, and then the Cu backing was digested by nitric acid (HNO 3). The remaining thin Cr discs (~ 1 cm diameter) were weighed to determine their thickness (~ 75 – 85 μm) and arranged into stacked foil targets, along with ~ 25 μm thick Cu monitor foils. These targets were bombarded with ~ 15 MeV protons for 1 – 2 min at ~ 1 – 2 μA from a CS- 15 cyclotron (The Cyclotron Corporation, Berkeley, CA, USA). The beamline was perpendicular to the foils, which were held in a machined 6061 -T 6 aluminum alloy target holder. The target holder was mounted in a solid target station with front cooling by a jet of He gas and rear cooling by circulating chilled water (T ≈ 2 – 5 °C). Following bombardment, these targets were disassembled and the radioisotope products in each foil were counted using a high-purity Ge (HPGe) detector. Cross-sections were calculated for the natCr(p,n) 52 Mn reaction. Binding constants of Mn(II) were measured by incubating 54 Mn(II) (t½ = 312 d) dichloride with anion- or cation-exchange resin (AG 1 -X 8 (Cl− form) or AG 50 W-X 8 (H+ form), respectively; both: 200 – 400 mesh; Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) in hydrochloric acid (HCl) ranging from 10 mM- 8 M (anion-exchange) and from 1 mM- 1 M (cation-exchange) or in sulfuric acid (H 2 SO 4) ranging from 10 mM- 8 M on cation-exchange resin only. The amount of unbound 54 Mn(II) was measured using a gamma counter, and binding constants (KD) were calculated for the various concentrations on both types of ion-exchange resin. We have used the unseparated product for preliminary PET and PET/MR imaging. natCr metal was bombarded and then digested in HCl, resulting in a solution of Cr(III) Cl 3 and 52 Mn(II) Cl 2. This solution was diluted and imaged in a glass scintillation vial using a microPET (Siemens, Munich, Germany) small animal PET scanner. The signal was corrected for abundant cascade gamma-radiation from 52 Mn that could cause random <b>false</b> <b>coincidence</b> events to be detected, and then the image was reconstructed by filtered back-projection. Additionally, we have used the digested target to spike non-radioactive Mn(II) Cl 2 solutions for simultaneous PET/MR phantom imaging using a Biograph mMR (Siemens) clinical scanner. The phantom consisted of a 4 × 4 matrix of 15 mL conical tubes containing 10 mL each of 0, 0. 5, 1. 0, and 2. 0 mM concentrations of non-radioactive Mn(II) Cl 2 with 0, 7, 14, and 27 μCi (at start of PET acquisition) of 52 Mn(II) Cl 2 from the digested target added. The concentrations were based on previous MR studies that measured spin-lattice relaxation time (T 1) versus concentration of Mn(II), and the activities were based on calculations for predicted count rate in the scanner. The PET/MR imaging consisted of a series of two-dimensional inversion-recovery turbo spin echo (2 D-IR-TSE) MR sequences (TE = 12 ms; TR = 3, 000 ms) with a wide range of inversion times (TI) from 23 – 2, 930 ms with real-component acquisition, as well as a 30 min. list-mode PET acquisition that was reconstructed as one static frame by 3 -D ordered subset expectation maximization (3 D-OSEM). Attenuation correction was performed based on a two-point Dixon (2 PD) MR sequence. The DICOM image files were loaded, co-registered, and windowed using the Inveon Research Workplace software (Siemens) ...|$|E
40|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the nuclear age, there has been a strong demand for the development of efficient technologies for the detection of ionizing radiation. According to the United States 2 ̆ 7 Department of Energy, the accurate assessment of fissile materials is essential in achieving the nonproliferation goals of enhancing safety and security of nuclear fuel cycle and nuclear energy facilities [1]. Nuclear materials can be characterized by the measurement of prompt and delayed neutrons and gamma rays emitted in spontaneous or induced fission reactions [2] and neutrons emitted in fission reactions are the distinctive signatures of nuclear materials. Today, the most widely used neutron detection technologies rely on thermal neutron capture reactions using a moderating material to cause the neutron to lose its energy prior to the detection event. This is necessary because as the fission event occurs, neutrons are emitted carrying high amounts of energy, typically on the order of mega electron volts (MeV). These energetic particles are classified as 2 ̆ 2 fast 2 ̆ 2 neutrons. For detecting the thermal neutrons, the Helium- 3 (3 He) gas-filled counters are arguably the most widely used technology of neutron detection. 3 He counters have been the scientific standard for the nuclear engineering community for several decades, and have earned their place as a reliable technique for the detection of neutrons. However, 3 He gas-filled counters have several disadvantages. First, gas-filled counters are not rigid and are sensitive to vibrations. Secondly, gas-filled counters are prone to the count rate limitations due to the physical processes of charge multiplication and transport in the gas medium in the electric field. Lastly, 3 He gas-filled counters suffer from a supply shortage of the 3 He isotope. As it is stated in [3], this shortage is created by the new demand for Helium- 3 due to the deployment of neutron detectors at the borders after the 9 / 11 attack to help secure the nation against smuggled nuclear and radiological material. Moreover, the production of 3 He isotope as a byproduct of security programs was drastically decreased. This isotope shortage coupled with the disadvantages of relying on a detector that requires neutron moderation before the detection of fission neutrons, poses a significant challenge in supporting the existing detection systems and the development of future technologies [4]. To address this problem, a reliable and accurate alternative technology to detect neutrons emitted in fissions must be developed. One such alternative technology that shows promise in this application is the use of scintillators based on solid state materials (plastics) which are sensitive to fast neutrons. However, plastic scintillators are also sensitive to photons. Hence, it is necessary to separate the neutron signals from the photon signals, using the pulse shape discrimination (PSD) analysis. The PSD is based on the comparison of the pulse shapes of digitized signal waveforms. This approach allows for the measurement of fast neutrons without the necessity of their moderation. Because the fission spectrum neutrons are mainly fast, methods employing fast neutron detection are applicable for the assay of fissile materials. In addition, the average time of scintillation of the plastic medium is much shorter than those of the gaseous counters, thus allowing scintillation detectors to be used in high count rate environments. Furthermore, the temporal information of the fast neutron detection using multiple sensors enables the time correlation analysis of the fission neutron multiplicity. The study of time correlation measurements of fast neutrons using the array of plastic scintillators is the basis of this work. The array of four plastic scintillator detectors equipped with the digital data acquisition and analysis system was developed. The digital PSD analysis of detector signals 2 ̆ 2 on-the-fly 2 ̆ 2 was implemented for the array. The time coincidence measurement technique using the list mode was employed for two detectors operating on the single time scale. This was necessary as no fission source was available {{to be used as a}} fast neutron multiplicity source. The detection technology was tested using isotopic photon sources and a plutonium-beryllium neutron source. It was shown that the system can be effectively used for fast-neutron multiplicity measurements, through a 2 ̆ 2 proof-of-concept 2 ̆ 2 model, enabling a shorter width of the time coincidence window compared to the 3 He counters. This result opens prospects to reduce the <b>false</b> <b>coincidence</b> rates in the neutron multiplicity measurements, thus increasing the sensitivity of nuclear material detection...|$|E

Here, we present a solid-state source of on-demand single-photons yielding a raw multi-photon emission probability of g^(2) (0) =(7. 5 ± 1. 6) · 10 ^- 5 without any background subtraction nor data processing. To this date, this is the lowest value of g^(2) (0) reported for any single-photon source even compared to the previously best background subtracted values.

Lithium-gadolinium-borate, 6 Li 6 Gd(11 B 03) 3 :Ce, dispersed as microcrystals within the plastic scintillator BC- 490 is a promising material for accurate dosimetry in mixed n-gamma fields. Spectral information above ~ 1 MeV is obtained by capture gating proton recoil events in the plastic scintillator to subsequent capture in 6 Li. Below ~ 1 MeV, isolated capture events in either gadolinium or 6 Li give energy information in this region. Discrimination based on capture gating is used to reject <b>false</b> <b>coincidences</b> due to gamma rays or incorrectly gated neutron events. A detailed Monte Carlo model has been created in MCNPX that predicts the energy response of the LGB spectrometer in the capture-gated mode of operation.

Results of simulations and measurements show that unfolding methods are necessary to determine the incident neutron spectra.

The system will detect the Compton interactions of the gamma photons in silicon and will be based on several stacks of Double Sided Silicon strip Detectors (DSSD) with an active area of 3 times 3 cm 2, a thickness of 1. 5 mm and 128 micro strips on each side. Considering that the application is the PET, the front end electronic should minimize the time jitter as possible, in order to reduce the number of <b>false</b> <b>coincidences</b> and improve the image quality. A typical filtering, in presence of a wide range of signal amplitudes as in the case of Compton interactions, is the bipolar semi Gaussian filtering, which is insensitive to the amplitude walk. However it is necessary to take into account that this filtering is quite sensitive to the jitter in the charge collection time inside the detector, which is of the order of 10 ns. Basing on simulations, we considered a fast unipolar filter, based on the CRRC shaping, consisting of a fast rise time and of a slower decay time.

40|$|Water (H 2 O) is {{the most}} studied {{molecule}} {{in the history of}} science. Yet many things remain unknown about its nuclear motion and decay. In recent years some studies have been made on the behavior of core-excited water molecules and its subsequent Auger decay and dissociation. Particular attention has been drawn to the ultra-fast dissociation channel H 2 O ∗→H+O∗H, which occurs on a femtosecond time-scale in the H 2 O ∗(O 1 s− 14 a 11) core-excited state. This study concerns the outcome of an electron energy resolved electron–ion co-incidence (PEPICO) measurement on core-excited H 2 O. The experiments were car-ried out at the I 411 beamline at the MAX II synchrotron in Lund. A setup consisting of a time-of-flight ion spectrometer and an electron energy analyser was used to mea-sure the energy of Auger electrons in coincidence with the resulting ion fragments from the decay.

40|$|Positron {{emission}} tomography (PET) imaging of non-standard positron emitters {{is influenced by}} gamma-coincidences, i. e. <b>false</b> <b>coincidences</b> produced by the coincident detection of an annihilation photon and a gamma-ray simultaneously emitted with the positron. The {{extent to which the}} PET study is disturbed by this effect is dependent on the kind of the positron emitter used, the kind and position of the object, the acquisition mode, i. e. the optional use of septa, and the reconstruction program. In order to demonstrate and study imaging problems with non-standard positron emitters, a phantom was scanned containing non-radioactive rods with different absorption materials and filled with either I- 124 or Y- 86 in the bidimensional (2 D) as well as tridimensional (3 D) acquisition mode. Methods. For reconstruction, the PET manufacturer's standard software without any modification was used. To reduce errors caused by the gamma -coincidences, a simple linear background subtraction, estimated from the counts at the scanner's external radius, was applied. Results. Without background subtraction, apparent positive and negative "radioactivity concentrations" were found in regions of interest positioned over the nonradioactive rods with values higher for Y- 86 compared to I- 124 and also higher for 3 D compared to 2 D. A complete subtraction of the background led to erroneous results. The errors in the phantom's non-radioactive rods and the difference between measured and true radioactivity became minimum, when about 75 % of the background was subtracted. This refers to both the 2 D and 3 D mode. Conclusion. Quantitation problems with the non-standard positron emitters I- 124 and Y- 86 could be minimized in the phantom study examined here by using a simple background subtraction together with the manufacturer's standard correction and reconstruction procedures...|$|R

40|$|Proton beam usage {{to treat}} cancer has {{recently}} experienced rapid growth, as {{it offers the}} ability to target dose delivery in a patient more precisely than traditional x-ray treatment methods. Protons stop within the patient, delivering the maximum dose {{at the end of}} their track—a phenomenon described as the Bragg peak. However, because a large dose is delivered to a small volume, proton therapy is very sensitive to errors in patient setup and treatment planning calculations. Additionally, because all primary beam particles stop in the patient, there is no direct information available to verify dose delivery. These factors contribute to the range uncertainty in proton therapy, which ultimately hinders its clinical usefulness. A reliable method of proton range verification would allow the clinician to fully utilize the precise dose delivery of the Bragg peak. Several methods to verify proton range detect secondary emissions, especially prompt gamma ray (PG) emissions. However, detection of PGs is challenging due to their high energy (2 – 10 MeV) and low attenuation coefficients, which limit PG interactions in materials. Therefore, detection and collimation methods must be specifically designed for prompt gamma ray imaging (PGI) applications. In addition, production of PGs relies on delivering a dose of radiation to the patient. Ideally, verification of the Bragg peak location exposes patients to a minimal dose, thus limiting the PG counts available to the imaging system. An additional challenge for PGI is the lack of accurate simulation models, which limit the study of PG production characteristics and the relationship between PG distribution and dose delivery. Specific limitations include incorrect modeling of the reaction cross sections, gamma emission yields, and angular distribution of emission for specific photon energies. While simulations can still be valuable assets in designing a system to detect and image PGs, until new models are developed and incorporated into Monte Carlo simulation packages, simulations cannot be used to study the production and location of PG emissions during proton therapy. This work presents a novel system to image PGs emitted during proton therapy to verify proton beam range. The imaging system consists of a multi-slit collimator paired with a position-sensitive LSO scintillation detector. This innovative design is the first collimated imaging system to implement two-dimensional (2 -D) imaging for PG proton beam range verification, while also providing a larger field of view than compared to single-slit collimator systems. Other, uncollimated imaging systems have been explored for PGI applications, such as Compton cameras. However, Compton camera designs are severely limited by counting rate capabilities. A recent Compton camera study reported count rate capability of about 5 kHz. However, at a typical clinical beam current of 1. 0 nA, the estimated PG emission rate would be 6 x 108 per second. After accounting for distance to the detector and interaction efficiencies, the detection system will still be overwhelmed with counts in the MHz range, causing <b>false</b> <b>coincidences</b> and hindering the operation of the imaging system. Initial measurements using 50 MeV protons demonstrated the ability of our system to reconstruct 2 -D PG distributions at clinical beam currents. A Bragg peak localization precision of 1 mm (2 σ) was achieved with delivery of (1. 7 ± 0. 8) x 108 protons into a PMMA target, suggesting the ability of the system to detect relative shifts in proton range while delivering fewer protons than used in a typical treatment fraction. This is key, as the ideal system allows the clinician to verify proton range when delivering only a small portion of the prescribed dose, preventing the mistreatment of the patient. Additionally, the absolute position of the Bragg peak was identified to within 1. 6 mm (2 σ) with 5. 6 x 1010 protons delivered. These promising results warrant further investigation and system optimization for clinical implementation. While further measurements at clinical beam energy levels will be required to verify system performance, these preliminary results provide evidence that 2 -D image reconstruction, with 1 – 2 mm accuracy, is possible with this design. Implementing such a system in the clinical setting would greatly improve proton therapy cancer treatment outcomes...|$|R
