5|$|The inner chamber {{measures}} 4.5 metres (13 feet) in length, and 1.7 metres (5 feet, 6 <b>inches)</b> <b>in</b> <b>width,</b> {{although it}} was potentially much larger when originally constructed. The chamber's internal height {{would have been at}} least 2 metres (6 feet, 6 inches). In its current state, the northern side of the chamber is made up of two slabs. One is 2.44 metres (8 feet) long, 2.29 metres (7 feet, 6 inches) deep, and 53 centimetres (1 foot, 9 inches) thick; the other is 1.52 centimetres (5 feet) long, 1.83 (6 feet) deep, and 61 centimetres (2 feet) thick. Conversely, the chamber's southern side consists of a single slab, measuring 3.45 metres (11 feet, 4 inches) in length, 2.21 metres (7 feet, 3 inches) in depth, and 53 centimetres (1 foot, 9 inches) in thickness at its eastern end.|$|E
25|$|The GT-R Nismo GT3 {{is powered}} by the VR38DETT, a twin-turbocharged V6 engine that {{displaces}} 3,799 cc. It measures 80.15 <b>inches</b> <b>in</b> <b>width,</b> 188.19 inches in length, and has a wheelbase of 109.45 inches.|$|E
25|$|These {{widespread}} and north-trending cracks were very narrow, {{from one to}} three <b>inches</b> <b>in</b> <b>width.</b> Despite these surface cracks and other offset drainages and other lineaments, no surface faulting occurred. This was confirmed by trench excavations where these features were found. Other ground effects occurred though. Reports of rockslides and dislodged boulders made their into the newspapers, but {{the most common type}} of damage were the many chimneys that were thrown down.|$|E
5000|$|... 1710-1730 CE: The first boomkins were {{generally}} 6 ft to 8 ft long, usually square in cross section, untapered, at one <b>inch</b> <b>in</b> <b>width</b> per foot of length.|$|R
50|$|The {{pinstripe}} {{is often}} {{compared to the}} similar chalk stripe. Pinstripes are very thin, often 1/30th of an <b>inch</b> <b>in</b> <b>width,</b> and are created with one single warp yarn.|$|R

In another experiment, a platina spatula, five <b>inches</b> <b>in</b> {{length and}} seven eighths of an <b>inch</b> <b>in</b> <b>width,</b> had four <b>inches</b> fixed <b>in</b> the ice, {{and the latter}} was only three sixteenths of an inch thick between one {{metallic}} surface and the other; yet this arrangement insulated as perfectly as the former.|$|R
25|$|Designed and {{produced}} specifically {{to compete in}} the FIA GT1 World Championship, the GT-R NISMO GT1 is based on the road-going version of the Nissan GT-R and was the only car to have ever been constructed implicitly to the GT1 technical regulations. The GT-R NISMO GT1 is powered by a NISMO race-prepped VK56DE, a naturally aspirated V8 engine that displaces 5,552 cc. It measures 80.3 <b>inches</b> <b>in</b> <b>width,</b> 186.2 inches in length, and has a wheelbase of 109.4 inches.|$|E
25|$|The Countach was {{styled by}} Marcello Gandini of the Bertone design studio, the same {{designer}} and studio that designed the Miura. Gandini {{was then a}} young, inexperienced designer— not very experienced in the practical, ergonomic aspects of automobile design, {{but at the same}} time unhindered by them. Gandini again produced another striking design. The Countach shape was wide and low (74.28 <b>inches</b> <b>in</b> <b>width</b> and 42.05 inches in height), but not very long (162.7 in length). Its angular and wedge-shaped body was made almost entirely of flat, trapezoidal panels.|$|E
25|$|Because {{they were}} unable to be used by orchestras, music makers began to build smaller gong drums that would not carry a {{definite}} pitch. This smaller version of the gong drum is today called orchestral bass drum, and it is the prototype with which people are most familiar today. The modern bass drum is used primarily in orchestras. The drum, similar to the davul and long drum, is double-headed, rod tensioned, and measures roughly 40 inches in diameter and 20 <b>inches</b> <b>in</b> <b>width.</b> Most orchestral bass drums are situated within a frame, which allows them to be positioned at any angle.|$|E

25|$|Carthage's economy {{began as}} an {{extension}} of that of its parent city, Tyre. Its massive merchant fleet traversed the trade routes mapped out by Tyre, and Carthage inherited from Tyre the trade in the extremely valuable dye Tyrian purple. No evidence of purple dye manufacture has been found at Carthage, but mounds of shells of the murex marine snails from which it derived have been found in excavations of the Punic town which archaeologists call Kerkouane, at Dar Essafi on Cap Bon. Similar mounds of murex have also been found at Djerba on the Gulf of Gabes in Tunisia. Strabo mentions the purple dye-works of Djerba {{as well as those of}} the ancient city of Zouchis. The purple dye became one of the most highly valued commodities in the ancient Mediterranean, being worth fifteen to twenty times its weight in gold. In Roman society, where adult males wore the toga as a national garment, the use of the toga praetexta, decorated with a stripe of Tyrian purple about two to three <b>inches</b> <b>in</b> <b>width</b> along its border, was reserved for magistrates and high priests. Broad purple stripes (latus clavus) were reserved for the togas of the senatorial class, while the equestrian class had the right to wear narrow stripes (angustus clavus).|$|E
2500|$|... "The civilizing process {{began at}} Carlisle began with clothes. Whites {{believed}} the Indian children {{could not be}} civilized while wearing moccasins and blankets. Their hair was cut because in some mysterious way long hair stood {{in the path of}} our development. They were issued the clothes of white men. High collar stiff-bosomed shirts and suspenders fully three <b>inches</b> <b>in</b> <b>width</b> were uncomfortable. White leather boots caused actual suffering." [...] Standing Bear later wrote that red flannel underwear caused [...] "actual torture." [...] He remembered the red flannel underwear as [...] "the worst thing about life at Carlisle." ...|$|E
2500|$|The match {{takes place}} on a thick rubber mat that is {{shock-absorbing}} to ensure safety. [...] A large outer circle between 32 and 42 feet in diameter that designates the wrestling area is marked on the mat. The circumference line of that circle is called the boundary line. The wrestling area {{is surrounded by a}} mat area or apron (or protection area) that is at least five <b>inches</b> <b>in</b> <b>width</b> that helps prevent serious injury. The mat area is designated by the use of contrasting colors or a [...] line, {{which is part of the}} wrestling area and included in bounds. The wrestlers are within bounds when any part of either wrestler is on or inside this boundary line.|$|E
5000|$|The {{edges of}} the gums {{attached}} to the necks {{of two or more}} teeth of either jaw, were distinctly bordered by a narrow leaden-blue line, about the one-twentieth part of an <b>inch</b> <b>in</b> <b>width,</b> whilst the substance of the gum apparently retained its ordinary colour and condition.|$|R
5000|$|Malinta: The name [...] "Malinta" [...] {{originated}} from the root word [...] "Linta" [...] which means leech - a small (about one <b>inch</b> <b>in</b> length and ¼ <b>inch</b> <b>in</b> <b>width)</b> blood-sucking worm that inhabit the dark but warm forest corridor. When engorged with blood, the worm swells to about two <b>inches</b> <b>in</b> length {{and a half}} <b>inch</b> <b>in</b> <b>width.</b> [...] "Malinta" [...] literally means the place where linta/leeches are plentiful. This must have started in the later part of the 1800s when Malinta was still forested. A highland barangay, Malinta is a growing community with 500 households {{according to the latest}} Census. During saudan or tiangge (marketdays) Malinta is a center of trade for various goods such as farm products, livestock, fish and assorted commercial commodities. It is a meeting place for minor entrepreneurs and farmers. Juan Villamor was the first Teniente del Barrio of Malinta.|$|R

2500|$|Among Murphy's first acts was to {{call for}} the {{formation}} of a loyal state militia, as bushwhackers were running rampant in the state. On May 31, 1864, the legislature adopted Act Number Nineteen, which provided for the creation of [...] "a loyal State militia." [...] This legislation stipulated that [...] "none but loyal and trustworthy men shall be permitted to bear arms in said organization." [...] So that the legal militia could be easily separated from the guerrilla forces, the act required each militiaman to [...] "wear, as a mark of distinction, and for the purpose of being recognized at a distance, a band of red cloth [...] <b>inches</b> <b>in</b> <b>width,</b> to be worn on their hats, or in the most [...] manner...." [...] Governor Murphy was authorized by the legislature to solicit 10,000 stands of arms from the Federal authorities to supply the militia force. Albert W. Bishop, a lieutenant colonel in the 1st Arkansas (Union) Cavalry, became Murphy's adjutant general.|$|E

60|$|There are forty and odd {{vertebrae}} in all, {{which in}} the skeleton are not locked together. They mostly lie like the great knobbed blocks on a Gothic spire, forming solid courses of heavy masonry. The largest, a middle one, is in width something less than three feet, and in depth more than four. The smallest, where the spine tapers away into the tail, is only two <b>inches</b> <b>in</b> <b>width,</b> and looks something like a white billiard-ball. I was told that there were still smaller ones, but they had been lost by some little cannibal urchins, the priest's children, who had stolen them to play marbles with. Thus we see how that the spine of even the hugest of living things tapers off at last into simple child's play.|$|E
5000|$|The {{fruit of}} Pachypodium ambongense {{consists}} of two mericaps, a carpel with one seed or one of a pair split apart at maturity.

60|$|The hail of Carthaginian {{missiles}} {{continued until}} the Roman light infantry {{were forced to}} fall back; and the slingers were then recalled, and the heavy infantry of the two armies stood facing each other. The Carthaginians took up close order, and, shoulder to shoulder, their bodies covered with their shields, they advanced to meet the legions of Rome. As they moved, their music--flute, harp, and lyre--rose {{on the air in}} a military march, and keeping step the long line advanced with perfect order and regularity. In the centre were the Carthaginian foot soldiers and their African allies, clothed alike in a red tunic, with helmet of bronze, steel cuirass and circular shield, and carrying, besides their swords, pikes of twenty feet in length. On the left were the Spaniards, in white tunics bordered with purple, with semicircular shields four feet in length and thirty-two <b>inches</b> <b>in</b> <b>width,</b> armed with long swords used either for cutting or thrusting.|$|E
60|$|Meanwhile an {{extensive}} traffic in valuable furs was commenced with the natives, {{who were more}} than satisfied with the scraps of bright cloth, beads, and other trifling ornaments they received in exchange for them. Some of the natives wanted to purchase weapons with their furs, but Karlsefin would not allow this. At first the Norsemen gave their cloth and other wares in exchange with liberal hand, cutting the bright cloth into stripes {{of three or four}} inches in breadth; but they soon found that at this rate their supplies would become exhausted too early in the year. They therefore reduced their prices, and began to give stripes of cloth only two <b>inches</b> <b>in</b> <b>width,</b> and at last reduced the measure to one inch, for furs that had previously fetched four. But the unsophisticated natives were quite content with the change, and appeared to enjoy nothing so much as to twist these stripes of cloth into their long black hair.|$|E
50|$|Simple recipes {{only use}} rye flour and {{water for the}} dough, but many recipes include mashed potatoes, wheat flour and egg. The dough is kneaded and then rolled into a long, thin cylinder. This roll is cut into pieces about half an <b>inch</b> <b>in</b> <b>width.</b> These are rolled the typical shape of Schupfnudeln. Afterwards they are either cooked in salty water for about ten minutes or deep-fried. Many recipes include frying them in a pan {{afterwards}} as well.|$|R
