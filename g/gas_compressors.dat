25|$|In {{addition}} {{for use as}} {{an internal}} combustion engine, the basic Wankel design has also been used for <b>gas</b> <b>compressors,</b> and superchargers for internal combustion engines, but in these cases, although the design still offers advantages in reliability, the basic advantages of the Wankel in size and weight over the four-stroke internal combustion engine are irrelevant. In a design using a Wankel supercharger on a Wankel engine, the supercharger is {{twice the size of}} the engine.|$|E
25|$|Often mid-stream {{and well}} head gases require removal {{of many of}} the various {{hydrocarbon}} species contained within the natural gas. Some of these gases include heptane, pentane, propane and other hydrocarbons with molecular weights above Methane (CH4) to produce a natural gas fuel which is used to operate the natural gas engines for further pressurized transmission. Typically, natural <b>gas</b> <b>compressors</b> require 950 to 1050BTU per cubic foot to operate at the natural gas engines rotational name plate specifications.|$|E

50|$|In some cases, a {{so-called}} bypass valve {{acts as a}} relief valve by being used to return {{all or part of}} the fluid discharged by a pump or <b>gas</b> <b>compressor</b> back to either a storage reservoir or the inlet of the pump or <b>gas</b> <b>compressor.</b> This is done to protect the pump or <b>gas</b> <b>compressor</b> and any associated equipment from excessive pressure. The bypass valve and bypass path can be internal (an integral part of the pump or compressor) or external (installed as a component in the fluid path). Many fire engines have such relief valves to prevent the overpressurization of fire hoses.|$|R
25|$|Most {{high-pressure}} breathing <b>gas</b> <b>compressors</b> {{are designed}} to accept intake gas at normal atmospheric pressure. {{and one of the}} usual components for breathing gas mixtures for diving is atmospheric air, so it is convenient to blend the gases at atmospheric pressure in an accessory to the compressor called a mixing tube or blending stick. The mixing tube may be constructed in a variety of ways, providing that it does not unduly restrict flow, and adequately mixes the gases before analysis and before intake into the compressor. A large range of commercially produced and home made blending tubes have been successfully used.|$|E

5000|$|The gas {{condensate}} {{from the high}} pressure separator flows through a throttling control valve to a low pressure separator. The reduction in pressure across the control valve causes the condensate to undergo a partial vaporization referred to as flash vaporization. The raw natural gas from the low pressure separator is sent to a [...] "booster" [...] compressor which raises the gas pressure and sends it through a cooler, {{and then to the}} main <b>gas</b> <b>compressor.</b> The main <b>gas</b> <b>compressor</b> raises the pressure of the gases from the high and low pressure separators to whatever pressure is required for the pipeline transportation of the gas to the raw natural gas processing plant. The main <b>gas</b> <b>compressor</b> discharge pressure will depend upon the distance to the raw natural gas processing plant and may require a multi-stage compressor.|$|R
