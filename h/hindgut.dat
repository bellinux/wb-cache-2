5|$|In the <b>hindgut</b> (element 16 in {{numbered}} diagram), or proctodaeum, undigested food {{particles are}} joined by uric acid to form fecal pellets. The rectum absorbs 90% {{of the water in}} these fecal pellets, and the dry pellet is then eliminated through the anus (element 17), completing the process of digestion. The uric acid is formed using hemolymph waste products diffused from the Malpighian tubules (element 20). It is then emptied directly into the alimentary canal, at the junction between the midgut and <b>hindgut.</b> The number of Malpighian tubules possessed by a given insect varies between species, ranging from only two tubules in some insects to over 100 tubules in others.|$|E
5|$|At the tapered {{rear end}} of the stomach and {{projecting}} slightly into the <b>hindgut</b> is the prostyle, a backward-pointing cone of feces and mucus, which is rotated by further cilia so it acts as a bobbin, winding the mucus string onto itself. Before the mucus string reaches the prostyle, the acidity of the stomach makes the mucus less sticky and frees particles from it.|$|E
5|$|The termite gut has {{inspired}} various research efforts aimed at replacing fossil fuels with cleaner, renewable energy sources. Termites are efficient bioreactors, {{capable of producing}} two litres of hydrogen from a single sheet of paper. Approximately 200 species of microbes live inside the termite <b>hindgut,</b> releasing the hydrogen that was trapped inside wood and plants that they digest. Through the action of unidentified enzymes in the termite gut, lignocellulose polymers are broken down into sugars and are transformed into hydrogen. The bacteria within the gut turns the sugar and hydrogen into cellulose acetate, an acetate ester of cellulose on which termites rely for energy. Community DNA sequencing of the microbes in the termite <b>hindgut</b> has been employed to provide {{a better understanding of}} the metabolic pathway. Genetic engineering may enable hydrogen to be generated in bioreactors from woody biomass.|$|E

Unexposed beetles of both sexes did not contain detectable amounts of any volatile compound. This indicates that myrcene induces or is a precursor for sex-specific pheromone biospthesis...|$|R
50|$|Bifidobacterium asteroides is a gram-positive, {{rod-shaped}} {{species of}} bacteria. Various strains {{of this species}} have been isolated from the <b>hindguts</b> of honey bees. Prior to 1969, this species {{was referred to as}} strains of Bacillus constellatus.|$|R
5|$|While poorly documented, {{chemical}} communication {{is believed to}} be important to the group. Anal secretions are produced in the <b>hindgut,</b> and released along the posterior setae as predator deterrents In Australia, aggregations of male common blossom thrips have been observed on the petals of Hibiscus rosa-sinensis and Gossypium hirsutum; females were attracted to these groups so {{it seems likely that the}} males were producing pheromones.|$|E
5|$|A {{specimen}} of Pinacosaurus preserves large paraglossalia (triangular bones or cartilages {{located in the}} tongue) which show signs of muscular stress, and it is {{thought this was a}} common feature of ankylosaurs. The researchers who examined the specimen suggested that ankylosaurs relied heavily on muscular tongues and hyobranchia (tongue bones) when feeding, since their teeth were fairly small and were replaced at a relatively slow rate. Some modern salamanders have similar tongue bones, and use prehensile tongues to pick up food. Based on the broadness of the ribcage, Ankylosaurus may have digested through a <b>hindgut</b> fermentation system like modern herbivorous lizards, which have several chambers in their enlarged colon.|$|E
5|$|Horseshoe crabs convert {{nitrogenous}} wastes to ammonia {{and dump}} it via their gills, and excrete other wastes as feces via the anus. They also have nephridia ("little kidneys"), which extract other wastes for excretion as urine. Ammonia is so toxic {{that it must}} be diluted rapidly with large quantities of water. Most terrestrial chelicerates cannot afford to use so much water and therefore convert nitrogenous wastes to other chemicals, which they excrete as dry matter. Extraction is by various combinations of nephridia and Malpighian tubules. The tubules filter wastes out of the blood and dump them into the <b>hindgut</b> as solids, a system that has evolved independently in insects and several groups of arachnids.|$|E
500|$|Periodically, {{circular}} muscles at the <b>hindgut's</b> entrance {{pinch off}} and excrete {{a piece of}} the prostyle, preventing the prostyle from growing too large. The anus, in the part of the mantle cavity, is swept by the outgoing [...] "lane" [...] of the current created by the gills. Carnivorous molluscs usually have simpler digestive systems.|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{dynamics}} of symbiotic protist communities of Reticulitermes lucifugus ‘‘Sicily’’ were investigated {{to assess the}} effects of seasonal environmental conditions and the termite’s feeding activity. In worker and soldier castes, the total protist population (total abundance), individual species abundances, and species proportions in their <b>hindguts</b> were examined monthly from December 2012 to February 2014. The main protist species taken into account were Dinenympha fimbriata Kirby, D. gracilis Leidy, Pyrsonympha flagellata Gras., Spirotrichonympha flagellata Grassi u. Fo` a, Holomastigotes elongatum Grassi u. Fo`a, and Trichonympha agilis Leidy, while others were not specifically identified, but were counted together. Seasonal comparisons between worker and soldier castes were made. Further, monthly data of workers were examined. We always found the presence of symbiontic protists in worker and soldier <b>hindguts,</b> therefore we hypothesize that termites fed without periods of interruption. In both castes the total protist population and species abundance showed variable trends with the highest values in summer. Workers {{were found to have}} significantly larger populations of protists and abundances of individual species than soldiers. Similar protist species were observed in both castes and in all periods, except for H. elongatum which was sometimes absent in soldiers. In <b>hindguts</b> of workers and soldiers the proportions of the protist species often showed a significant variation across seasons except for S. flagellata and T. agilis. In both castes we always detected the highest percentage of Dinenympha spp. with respect to the other species. Elements that might influence these aspects are discussed...|$|R
25|$|In some insect groups, these endosymbionts live in {{specialized}} insect cells called bacteriocytes (also called mycetocytes), and are maternally-transmitted, i.e. {{the mother}} transmits her endosymbionts to her offspring. In some cases, the bacteria are transmitted in the egg, as in Buchnera; in others like Wigglesworthia, they are transmitted via milk {{to the developing}} insect embryo. In termites, the endosymbionts reside within the <b>hindguts</b> and are transmitted through trophallaxis among colony members.|$|R
5|$|Isopods have {{a simple}} gut which lacks a midgut section; instead there are caeca {{connected}} {{to the back of}} the stomach in which absorption takes place. Food is sucked into the esophagus, a process enhanced in the blood-sucking parasitic species, and passed by peristalsis into the stomach, where the material is processed and filtered. The structure of the stomach varies, but in many species there is a dorsal groove into which indigestible material is channelled and a ventral part connected to the caeca where intracellular digestion and absorption take place. Indigestible material passes on through the <b>hindgut</b> and is eliminated through the anus, which is on the pleotelson.|$|E
5|$|The {{digestive}} system of beetles is primarily adapted for a herbivorous diet. Digestion takes place {{mostly in the}} anterior midgut, although in predatory groups like the Carabidae, most digestion occurs in the crop by means of midgut enzymes. In the Elateridae, the larvae are liquid feeders that extraorally digest their food by secreting enzymes. The alimentary canal basically consists of a short, narrow pharynx, a widened expansion, the crop, and a poorly developed gizzard. This {{is followed by the}} midgut, that varies in dimensions between species, with a large amount of cecum, and the <b>hindgut,</b> with varying lengths. There are typically four to six Malpighian tubules.|$|E
5|$|The neuroendocrine {{system is}} typical of insects. There is a brain, a subesophageal ganglion, three {{thoracic}} ganglia, and six abdominal ganglia. Strong neuron connections connect the neurohemal corpora cardiaca to the brain and frontal ganglion, where the closely related median corpus allatum produces juvenile hormone III {{in close proximity to}} the neurohemal dorsal arota. The digestive system of earwigs is like all other insects, consisting of a fore-, mid-, and <b>hindgut,</b> but earwigs lack gastric caecae which are specialized for digestion in many species of insect. Long, slender (extratory) malpighian tubules can be found between the junction of the mid- and hind gut.|$|E
40|$|A peptide from <b>hindguts</b> of the Triatoma hematophagous Chagas {{insect vector}} {{activates}} adenylyl cyclase activity in Trypanosoma cruzi epimastigote membranes and stimulates the in vitro differentiation of epimastigotes to metacyclic trypomastigotes. <b>Hindguts</b> {{were obtained from}} insects fed 2 days earlier with chicken blood. Purification was performed by gel filtration and HPLC on C 18 and C 4 columns. SDS/PAGE of the purified peptide showed a single band of about 10 kDa. The following sequence was determined for the 20 amino-terminal residues of this peptide: H 2 N-Met-Leu-Thr-Ala-Glu-Asp-Lys-Lys-Leu-Ile-Gln- Gln-Ala-Trp-Glu-Lys-Ala-Ala-Ser-His. This sequence {{is identical to the}} amino terminus of chicken alpha D-globin. On a Western blot, the peptide immunoreacted with a polyclonal antibody against chicken globin D. A synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 1 - 40 of the alpha D-globin amino terminus also stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity and promoted differentiation. This 125 I-labeled synthetic peptide bound specifically to T. cruzi epimastigote cells. Activation of epimastigote adenylyl cyclase by the hemoglobin-derived peptide may {{play an important role in}} T. cruzi differentiation and consequently in the transmission of Chagas disease...|$|R
40|$|The {{amounts of}} {{carboxymethyl}} cellulase {{present in the}} midguts and <b>hindguts</b> of two species of cockroaches were determined. Numbers of colonies from the guts which digested carboxymethyl cellulose, visualized by flooding plates with cetyltrimethylammonium bromide after incubation, were counted. The numbers indicated {{the presence of a}} resident, multiplying population of predominantly anaerobic carboxymethyl cellulose-digesting bacteria in both species of cockroaches. Anaerobic and facultatively anaerobic species of bacteria were isolated, and their carboxymethylcellulase activities were assayed...|$|R
40|$|Longitudinally aligned microtubules, about 220 {{angstrom}} in diameter, {{have been}} seen in the protoplasmic cylinders of the following spirochetes (symbiotic in the <b>hindguts</b> of dry-wood and subterranean termites) : Pillotina sp., Diplocalyx sp., Hollandina sp. They are also present in a gliding bacterium from Pterotermes occidentis. These microtubules are probably composed of tubulin, as determined by staining with fluorescent antibodies to tubulin and comigration with authentic tubulin on acrylamide gels. Treponema reiteri lack tubulin by these same criteria. These observations support the hypothesis of the symbiotic origin of cilia and flagella from certain spirochetes...|$|R
5|$|The simple, low-crowned teeth {{indicate}} that Paraceratherium was a browser with a diet consisting of relatively soft leaves and shrubs. Later rhinoceroses were grazers, with high-crowned teeth because their diets contained grit that quickly wore down their teeth. Studies of mesowear on Paraceratherium teeth confirm the creatures {{had a soft}} diet of leaves; microwear studies {{have yet to be}} conducted. Isotope analysis shows that Paraceratherium fed chiefly on C3 plants, which are mainly leaves. Like its perissodactyl relatives, the horses, tapirs, and other rhinoceroses, Paraceratherium would have been a <b>hindgut</b> fermenter; it would extract relatively little nutrition from its food and would have to eat large volumes to survive. Like other large herbivores, Paraceratherium would have had a large digestive tract.|$|E
5|$|Equines are {{monogastric}} <b>hindgut</b> fermenters. They {{prefer to}} eat grasses and sedges, {{but may also}} consume bark, leaves, buds, fruits and roots if their favored foods are scarce, particularly asses. Compared to ruminants, equines have a simpler and less efficient digestive system. Nevertheless, they can subsist on lower quality vegetation. After food is passed though the stomach, it enters the sac-like cecum. where cellulose is broken down by micro-organisms. Fermentation is quicker in equines than in ruminants; 30–45 hours for a horse compared to 70–100 hours for a cow. Equines may spend 60-80 {{percent of their time}} feeding, depending on the availability and quality of vegetation. In the African savannas, the plains zebra is a pioneer grazer; mowing down the upper, less nutritious grass canopy and preparing the way for more specialized grazers like blue wildebeests and Thomson's gazelles which depend on shorter and more nutritious grasses below.|$|E
5|$|Isopods are detritivores, browsers, {{carnivores}} (including {{predators and}} scavengers), parasites, and filter feeders, and may occupy {{one or more}} of these feeding niches. Only aquatic and marine species are known to be parasites or filter feeders. Some exhibit coprophagia and will also consume their own fecal pellets. Terrestrial species are in general herbivorous, with woodlice feeding on moss, bark, algae, fungi and decaying material. In marine isopods that feed on wood, cellulose is digested by enzymes secreted in the caeca. Limnoria lignorum, for example, bores into wood and additionally feeds on the mycelia of fungi attacking the timber, thus increasing the nitrogen in its diet. Land-based wood-borers mostly house symbiotic bacteria in the <b>hindgut</b> which aid in digesting cellulose. There are numerous adaptations to this simple gut, but these are mostly correlated with diet rather than by taxonomic group.|$|E
5000|$|The Termite-leu RNA motif is a conserved RNA {{structure}} {{discovered by}} bioinformatics. [...] It is {{found only in}} DNA sequences extracted from uncultivated bacteria living in termite <b>hindguts,</b> and {{has not yet been}} detected in any known cultivated organism. In many cases, Termite-leu RNAs are found in the likely 5 untranslated regions of multive genes related to the synthesis of the amino acid leucine. However, in several cases it is not found in this type of location. Therefore, it was considered ambiguous as to whether Termite-leu RNAs constitute cis-regulatory elements.|$|R
40|$|Spirochetes from termite <b>hindguts</b> and {{freshwater}} sediments possessed homologs of a nitrogenase gene (nifH) {{and exhibited}} nitrogenase activity, a previously unrecognized metabolic capability in spirochetes. Fixation of 15 -dinitrogen was demonstrated with termite gut Treponema ZAS- 9 and free-living Spirochaeta aurantia. Homologs of nifH were {{also present in}} human oral and bovine ruminal treponemes. Results implicate spirochetes in the nitrogen nutrition of termites, whose food is typically low in nitrogen, and in global nitrogen cycling. These results also proffer spirochetes as a likely origin of certain nifHs observed in termite guts and other environments that were not previously attributable to known microbes...|$|R
50|$|Molecular {{evidence}} {{based on}} the amplification of 16rRNA genes from various environments suggest that the phylum is much more widespread than previously thought. Most of the clones from mammalian environments group along with the known isolates {{in what has been}} called Fibrobacteres subphylum 1. Members of Fibrobacteres subphylum 2 however, have so far been found only in the gut of termites. and in some litter-feeding cockroaches. The predominance of Fibrobacteres subphylum 2 in cellulolytic fibre-associated bacterial communities in <b>hindguts</b> of wood-feeding Nasutitermes corniger suggests that they {{play an important role in}} the breakdown of plant material in higher termites.|$|R
5|$|The {{salivary glands}} (element 30 in {{numbered}} diagram) in an insect's mouth produce saliva. The salivary ducts {{lead from the}} glands to the reservoirs and then forward through the head to an opening called the salivarium, located behind the hypopharynx. By moving its mouthparts (element 32 in numbered diagram) the insect can mix its food with saliva. The mixture of saliva and food then travels through the salivary tubes into the mouth, where it begins to break down. Some insects, like flies, have extra-oral digestion. Insects using extra-oral digestion expel digestive enzymes onto their food to break it down. This strategy allows insects to extract {{a significant proportion of}} the available nutrients from the food source. The gut is where almost all of insects' digestion takes place. It can be divided into the foregut, midgut and <b>hindgut.</b>|$|E
25|$|Blood meal {{digestion}} in ticks {{is similar}} in all species. The digestive system in both Ixodid and argasid ticks is histologically divided into foregut, midgut and <b>hindgut.</b> The foregut comprises the sucking pharynx and the oesophagus. The midgut contains a ventriculus with a valve, a variable number of blind diverticula (caeca), and a rectal tube. The <b>hindgut</b> is divided into a rectal bulb and the rectum itself.|$|E

40|$|The {{bacterial}} candidate phylum Termite Group I (TG- 1) presently consists {{mostly of}} “Endomicrobia,” which are endosymbionts of flagellate protists occurring {{exclusively in the}} <b>hindguts</b> of termites and wood-feeding cockroaches. Here, we show that public databases contain many, mostly undocumented 16 S rRNA gene sequences from other habitats that are affiliated with the TG- 1 phylum but are only distantly related to “Endomicrobia. ” Phylogenetic analysis of the expanded data set revealed several diverse and deeply branching lineages comprising clones from many different habitats. In addition, we designed specific primers to explore the diversity and environmental distribution of bacteria in the TG- 1 phylum...|$|R
40|$|Pure {{cultures}} of termite gut spirochetes were obtained and {{were shown to}} catalyze the synthesis of acetate from H_ 2 plus CO_ 2. The 16 S ribosomal DNA sequences of two strains were 98 percent similar and were affiliated {{with those of the}} genus Treponema. However, neither was closely related to any known treponeme. These findings imply an important role for spirochetes in termite nutrition, help to reconcile the dominance of acetogenesis over methanogenesis as an H_ 2 sink in termite <b>hindguts,</b> suggest that the motility of termite gut protozoa by means of attached spirochetes may be based on interspecies H_ 2 transfer, and underscore the importance of termites as a rich reservoir of novel microbial diversity...|$|R
40|$|Comparisons of 16 S rDNA {{sequences}} {{were used}} to determine the phylogeny of not-yet-cultured spirochetes from <b>hindguts</b> of the African higher termite, Nasutitermes lujae (Wasmann). The 16 S rRNA genes were amplified directly from spirochete-rich <b>hindguts</b> by using universal primers, and the amplified products were cloned into Escherichia coli. Clones were screened with a spirochete-specific DNA probe. Analysis of 1, 410 base positions of the 16 S rDNA insert from one spirochete clone, designated NL 1, supported its assignment to the genus Treponema, with average interspecies similarities of ca. 85 %. The sequence of NL 1 was most closely related (ca. 87 to 88 % similarity) to sequences of Spirochaeta stenostrepta and Spirochaeta caldaria and to a previously published sequence (ca. 87 % similarity) of spirochetal clone MDS 1 from the Australian lower termite, Mastotermes darwiniensis (Froggatt). On the basis of 16 S rRNA sequence comparisons and individual base signatures, clones NL 1 and MDS 1 clearly represent two novel species of Treponema, although specific epithets have not yet been proposed. The gross morphology of NL 1 was determined from in situ hybridization experiments with an NL 1 -specific, fluorescently labeled oligonucleotide probe. Cells were approximately 0. 3 to 0. 4 by 30 microns in size, with a wavelength and amplitude of about 10 microns and 0. 8 to 1. 6 micron, respectively. Moreover, electron microscopy of various undulate cells present in gut contents confirmed that they possessed ultrastructural features typical of spirochetes, i. e., a wavy protoplasmic cylinder, periplasmic flagella, and an outer sheath. The sequence data suggest that termite gut spirochetes may represent a separate line of descent from other treponemes and that they constitute a significant reservoir of previously unrecognized spirochetal biodiversity...|$|R

40|$|A {{new species}} of Pseudotrypanosoma, P. elphinstonae sp. n., is {{described}} which is symbiotic within the <b>hindguts</b> of the rhinotermitid termites Schedorhinotermes secundus and S. intermedius. P. elphinstonae possesses most {{of the features of}} the genus: 4 anterior flagella, prominent costa and recurrent flagellum forming an undulating membrane and simple bean-shaped parabasal body. The mastigont complex is of similar composition and arrangement to other trichomonads but the pelto-axostylar complex is greatly simplified being composed of a single layer of microtubules which do not over lap and cannot be distinguished into separate structures. The undulating membrane is much smaller than in related species; the costa is smaller and simpler and there are no microtubular bundles connecting it to the recurrent flagellum. Comparison of the ultrastructure of P. elphinstonae sp. n. with that of P. giganteum demonstrated that P. elphinstonae sp. n. in addition to being much smaller in size had a correspondingly simper ultrastructural organisation lacking several organelles which characterise the latter species...|$|R
40|$|Abstract-The {{quantities}} of trans-verbenol, myrtenol, and the pheromone, cis-verbenol, in the <b>hindguts</b> {{of males and}} females were found to increase in linear proportion following exposure to increasing concentrations of vapour of the host plant precursor, (-) -a-pinene. Males produced significantly more of these compounds than females. Differences between males and females in the ratios of compound production were indicated. The concentrations of myrcene, a-pinene, and other monoterpenes volatilized in male nuptial chambers in ponderosa pine were quantified as well as the amounts in phloem. Males do not appear to ingest sufficient phloem to obtain enough of the host plant precursor, myrcene, to account for production of the pheromones, ipsenol and ipsdienol, but they may consume additional amounts of myrcene in oleoresin/xylem. Comparisons of ipsenol, ipsdienol and cis-verbenol production in males when feeding or exposed to precursor vapours at various concentrations indicate that under natural conditions myrcene used in pheromone biosynthesis primarily enters the beetle via the digestive tract...|$|R

Some groups, like the genus Vetulicola, were more streamlined (complete with ventral keels) than other groups, such as the tadpole-like Didazoonidae. Because all vetulicolians had mouths which had no features for chewing or grasping, it is automatically assumed that they were not predators. Because of their gill slits, many researchers regard the vetulicolians as being planktivores. The sediment infills in the guts of their fossils have led some to suggest that they were deposit feeders. This idea has been contested, as deposit feeders tend to have straight guts, whereas the <b>hindguts</b> of vetulicolians were spiral-shaped.
