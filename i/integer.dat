5|$|In {{computer}} science, <b>integer</b> sorting is the algorithmic {{problem of}} sorting {{a collection of}} data values by numeric keys, {{each of which is}} an <b>integer.</b> Algorithms designed for <b>integer</b> sorting may also often be applied to sorting problems in which the keys are floating point numbers, rational numbers, or text strings. The ability to perform <b>integer</b> arithmetic on the keys allows <b>integer</b> sorting algorithms to be faster than comparison sorting algorithms in many cases, depending on the details of which operations are allowed in the model of computing and how large the integers to be sorted are.|$|E
5|$|<b>Integer</b> {{powers of}} 2 are {{important}} in computer science. The positive <b>integer</b> powers 2n give the number of possible values for an n-bit <b>integer</b> binary number, e.g. 28 = 256 different values for 1byte. For a given number the binary number system denotes {{on one side of}} the binary point all the positive <b>integer</b> powers of 2, that are contained in the <b>integer</b> part of this number, and the negative powers to the other side of the binary point represent the fractional part. This system is consistently used to represent numbers in computers for hardware reasons.|$|E
5|$|<b>Integer</b> {{powers of}} nonzero complex numbers {{are defined by}} {{repeated}} multiplication or division as above. If i is the imaginary unit and n is an <b>integer,</b> then i'n equals 1, i, −1, or −i, according to whether the <b>integer</b> n is congruent to 0, 1, 2, or 3 modulo 4. Because of this, the powers of i are useful for expressing sequences of period 4.|$|E

Moreover, {{in the sense of}} cardinality, almost all functions from the <b>integers</b> to <b>integers</b> are not computable. The number of computable functions from <b>integers</b> to <b>integers</b> is countable, because the number of possible algorithms is. The number of all functions from <b>integers</b> to <b>integers</b> is higher: the same as the cardinality of the real numbers. Thus most functions from <b>integers</b> to <b>integers</b> are not computable. Specific examples of uncomputable functions are known, including the busy beaver function and functions related to the halting problem and other undecidable problems.|$|R
