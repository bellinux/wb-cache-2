5|$|I {{wanted to}} speak a little about people who {{impressed}} the most, and somehow I kept on ignoring his performances in my previous two banters during this Olympiad, which is ridiculous, but I think pride of place goes to Eugenio Torre. You probably know who he is, and you probably have read about his results by now, but what he achieved during this Olympiad is absolutely tremendous. He <b>is</b> <b>by</b> <b>no</b> <b>means</b> <b>a</b> young man by now and he... played a tremendous level of opposition. The Philippines are a decently strong team and they played very, very decent opposition almost throughout the tournament. The result Eugenio showed in this event is absolutely fantastic.|$|E

As of 2011, heroin addiction and homelessness are huge problems across the inner city of Dublin.|$|E
25|$|In the Lagrangian description, fluid parcels may drift {{far from}} their initial positions.

However, such an unambiguous description is provided by the Generalized Lagrangian Mean (GLM) theory of Andrews and McIntyre in 1978.|$|E
25|$|Chaos {{theory was}} born from observing weather patterns, {{but it has}} become {{applicable}} {{to a variety of}} other situations. Some areas benefiting from chaos theory today are geology, mathematics, microbiology, biology, computer science, economics, engineering, finance, algorithmic trading, meteorology, philosophy, anthropology, physics, politics, population dynamics, psychology, and robotics.

25|$|The {{traditional}} gait of a Rottweiler is a trot. Therefore, the Rottweiler is a trotter. Trotting in this breed <b>is</b> <b>by</b> <b>no</b> <b>means</b> <b>a</b> {{fault and}} is required. This movement comes naturally to the Rottweiler and should appear as such; any deviation {{may lead to}} a disqualification in the show ring. While walking, the Rottweiler's legs, both front and hind, should move in a straight forward and backward manner. As with the straight movement of the legs, the path the Rottweiler moves in should also be straight. The Rottweiler's gait is all about balance and effectiveness as the breed is still used as a herder today.|$|E

25|$|Since a batsman {{is free to}} {{play any}} shot to any type of {{delivery}} as he wishes, the above list <b>is</b> <b>by</b> <b>no</b> <b>means</b> <b>a</b> complete list of the strokes that batsmen choose to play. Many unorthodox, typically high-risk, shots have been used {{throughout the history of}} the game. The advent of limited overs cricket has seen the increased use of unorthodox shots to hit the ball into gaps where there are no fielders placed. Unorthodox shots are rarely used in first-class cricket as the pace of the game is slower and it is relatively more important to keep one's wicket than to try to score runs off every ball.|$|E
25|$|One non-trivial {{example is}} the fractal {{dimension}} of a Koch snowflake. It has a topological dimension of 1, but it <b>is</b> <b>by</b> <b>no</b> <b>means</b> <b>a</b> rectifiable curve: {{the length of the}} curve between any two points on the Koch snowflake is infinite. No small piece of it is line-like, but rather it is composed of an infinite number of segments joined at different angles. The fractal dimension of a curve can be explained intuitively thinking of a fractal line as an object too detailed to be one-dimensional, but too simple to be two-dimensional. Therefore its dimension might best be described not by its usual topological dimension of 1 but by its fractal dimension, which in this case is a number between one and two.|$|E
25|$|Even {{though the}} Swiss Plateau forms a basin, it <b>is</b> <b>by</b> <b>no</b> <b>means</b> <b>a</b> flat territory, but {{depending}} on the region, it has a manifold structure. Important elements are the two big lakes, Lake Geneva and Lake Constance that delimit the Swiss Plateau in the southwest and the northeast. The western plateau is stamped by the Gros-de-Vaud plateau (up to 600 meters AMSL) and the Jorat molasse hills (up to 900 meters AMSL) but sometimes intersected by deep valleys. Only near the Jura there is an almost continuous dip consisting of the Venoge and the Orbe valleys which are separated by the Mormont hill, the main watershed between Rhône and Rhine, at only 500 m AMSL. The Seeland ('lake land'), characterized by the Murten, Neuchâtel and Biel lakes, represents the biggest plain of the Swiss Plateau, though it is also interrupted by isolated molasse ranges. In the east, it is neighboured by various hill countries the height of which decreases to the north. Another major plain is the Wasseramt where the Emme runs. In a broad valley alongside the Jura, the Aare collects all the rivers that {{come down from the}} Alps.|$|E

500|$|There {{are fewer}} reviews from {{newspapers}} outside the United Kingdom and United States, but those available are generally positive. Writing for Australia's The Sydney Morning Herald Alexander Downer, {{who served as}} Foreign Minister in the Government of John Howard gave A Journey a favourable review: [...] "His [...] commitment to humanity is sincere and convincing, and his personality infectiously amiable with a delightful sense of self-deprecating humour." [...] Konrad Yakabuski, a senior political writer for Canada's The Globe and Mail was also positive: [...] "If Tony Blair has not continued to agonize over the tough decisions of his prime ministership, he does {{a pretty good job}} of persuading otherwise in A Journey." [...] India's English language daily The Hindu said of the book, [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>by</b> <b>no</b> <b>means</b> <b>a</b> confessional memoir but a brave attempt with only patchy success at self-justification." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Luxurious" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. Bill Lamb of About.com commented, [...] "If Madonna is wishing {{to pass on}} her 'Material Girl' title, Gwen Stefani is happy to wear it proudly", but noted that [...] "hings are wearing a little thin, and this song doesn't have the striking impact of 'Rich Girl' or 'Hollaback Girl'." [...] Sam Shepherd of musicOMH agreed, writing that [...] "'Luxurious' <b>is</b> <b>by</b> <b>no</b> <b>means</b> <b>a</b> bad song, but it is pretty ordinary {{when compared to the}} songs that have preceded it." [...] PopMatters' Jason Damas found the track uninteresting and stated that Rossdale's appearance [...] "sounds like a blinged-out Saint Etienne". Alex Lai from Contactmusic.com called Stefani's performance [...] "as seductive as ever, and the production extremely polished, but it lacks the infectiousness of her other releases"; he found Slim Thug's remix unnecessary and viewed the single's release as [...] "a money-spinning exercise".|$|E
500|$|Many early dubstep tracks {{incorporate}} {{one or more}} [...] "bass drops", {{a characteristic}} inherited from drum and bass. Typically, the percussion will pause, often reducing the track to silence, and then resume with more intensity, accompanied by a dominant sub-bass (often passing portamento through an entire octave or more, as in the audio example). It is very common for the bass to drop at or very close to 55seconds into the song, because 55seconds is just over 32measures at the common tempo of 140bpm. However, this (or {{the existence of a}} bass drop in general) <b>is</b> <b>by</b> <b>no</b> <b>means</b> <b>a</b> completely rigid characteristic, rather a trope; a large portion of seminal tunes from producers like Kode9 and Horsepower Productions have more experimental song structures which do not rely on a drop for a dynamic peak – and in some instances do not feature a bass drop at all.|$|E

500|$|The film {{attracted}} 236,189 viewers at the French box office. Time Out gave a favourable review, {{calling the}} film a [...] "welcome {{addition to the}} post-holocaust barbarism [...] boom." [...] Steve Macfarlane from Not Coming to a Theater Near You gave a moderately positive review, stating [...] "While the film’s heart is syrupy-sentimental (who’s shocked?), its surfaces are clean, incremental, reverently silent—appropriate, given that ... humankind has lost its ability to speak." [...] Janet Maslin from The New York Times called it [...] "a bravura first film, using the simplest means, yet managing to incorporate humor, pathos, suspense and even a well-articulated definition of basic human needs." [...] Dave Kehr from the Chicago Reader also gave a positive review, stating: [...] "The absence of dialogue ... is a cleverly executed stunt, {{but it is also}} an effective alibi for a technically proficient filmmaker who really has nothing to say. Another John Carpenter is born, which <b>is</b> <b>by</b> <b>no</b> <b>means</b> <b>a</b> bad thing." ...|$|E
500|$|Once Denmark's {{principal}} fishing port, the Port of Esbjerg {{is still}} a driving force for the town's economy. While it {{has a long history}} of ferry services to England, the town <b>is</b> <b>by</b> <b>no</b> <b>means</b> <b>a</b> tourist destination. Lonely Planet remarked that [...] "nobody comes to Esbjerg for a holiday, in fact, as with many industrial ports, most visitors rush through as quickly as possible". Esbjerg is the main town for Denmark's oil and offshore activities, with companies like Maersk, Ramboll, Stimwell Services, ABB, Schlumberger, COWI and Atkins all having offshore-related activities in the town. Halliburton has an office in Esbjerg. The port has served the Danish offshore industry since oil and gas were first extracted from the North Sea in the early 1970s. More recently, it has become a centre for shipping offshore wind turbines. In addition to handling 65 percent of all Danish wind turbines, which supply [...] of offshore wind power, components have been shipped to various British wind farms. In order to cope with enormous future increases in Danish offshore wind power, 12 companies, including DONG Energy and Bluewater Energy Services are already planning the establishment of a Green Offshore Centre in Esbjerg. In connection with this, in June 2013, the port was significantly expanded with the opening of the Østhavn (East Harbour), covering an area of [...]|$|E
