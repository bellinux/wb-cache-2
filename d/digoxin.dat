5|$|Digitalis purpurea2.jpg|The foxglove, Digitalis purpurea, {{contains}} <b>digoxin,</b> {{a cardiac}} glycoside. The plant was used on heart conditions {{long before the}} glycoside was identified.|$|E
5|$|The {{cardiac glycosides}} are {{powerful}} drugs from medicinal plants including foxglove and lily of the valley. They include <b>digoxin</b> and digitoxin which support {{the beating of}} the heart, and act as diuretics.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{historical records}} of herbs are found from the Sumerian civilisation, {{where hundreds of}} medicinal plants including opium are listed on clay tablets. The Ebers Papyrus from ancient Egypt describes over 850 plant medicines, while Dioscorides documented over 1000 recipes for medicines using over 600 medicinal plants in De materia medica, forming the basis of pharmacopoeias for some 1500 years. Drug research makes use of ethnobotany to search for pharmacologically active substances in nature, and has in this way discovered hundreds of useful compounds. These include the common drugs aspirin, <b>digoxin,</b> quinine, and opium. The compounds found in plants are of many kinds, but most are in four major biochemical classes, the alkaloids, glycosides, polyphenols, and terpenes.|$|E
5|$|For {{diseases}} of the heart rate or rhythm, {{a number of different}} antiarrhythmic agents are used. These may interfere with electrolyte channels and thus the cardiac action potential (such as calcium channel blockers, sodium channel blockers), interfere with stimulation of the heart by the sympathetic nervous system (beta blockers), or interfere with the movement of sodium and potassium across the cell membrane, such as <b>digoxin.</b> Other examples include atropine for slow rhythms, and amiodarone for irregular rhythms. Such medications are not the only way of treating {{diseases of}} heart rate or rhythm. In the context of a new-onset irregular heart rhythm (atrial fibrillation), immediate electrical cardioversion may be attempted. For a slow heartbeat or heart block, a pacemaker or defibrillator may be inserted. The acuity of onset often affects how a rhythm disturbance is managed, as does whether a rhythm causes hemodynamic instability, such as low blood pressure or symptoms. An instigating cause is investigated for, such as a heart attack, medication, or metabolic problem.|$|E
5|$|Medical student Georges Garoyan {{published}} a thesis on Calment {{when she was}} 114 years old in January 1990. The first part records her daily routine (see above), and the second presents her medical history. According to this, she had been vaccinated as a child but could not remember the vaccine. Apart from aspirin against migraines she had never taken medicines, not even herbal teas, and had never had German measles, chickenpox, hypertension, diabetes or urinary infections. Concerning her heart, she presented with a moderate left ventricular dysfunction. In April 1986 at age 111 she was admitted to hospital for heart failure and treated with <b>digoxin.</b> More recently she had presented with athropathies in the ankles, elbows and wrists which were successfully treated with anti-inflammatory medication. Clinical examination revealed arterial blood pressures of 140mm/70mm, a temperature of 37 Celsius, a pulse of 84/min, a height of 150cm and a weight of 45 kilogrammes which had varied little in previous years. She scored well on mental tests except on numeric tasks and recall of recent events. Her blood values were normal between ages 111–114, with no signs of dehydration, anaemia, chronic infection or renal impairment. Genetic analysis of the HLA system revealed {{the presence of the}} DR1 allele, common among centenarians. The electrocardiogramme revealed left ventricular hypertrophy with a mild left atrial dilatation and extrasystolic arrhythmia. Radiology revealed diffuse osteoporosis and in the right hip, incipient osteoarthritis. Ultrasound revealed no anomalies of internal organs.|$|E
25|$|The {{inhibition}} of the sodium pump may also improve baroreceptor sensitivity in HF and may {{explain some of}} the neurohormonal effects of <b>digoxin.</b> <b>Digoxin</b> also has important parasympathetic effects, particularly on the atrioventricular node.|$|E
25|$|Some {{textbooks}} {{suggest that}} calcium {{should not be}} given in <b>digoxin</b> toxicity {{as it has been}} linked to cardiovascular collapse in humans and increased <b>digoxin</b> toxicity in animal models. Recent literature questions the validity of this concern.|$|E
25|$|<b>Digoxin</b> {{has fallen}} out of favor in people with heart failure because it may {{increase}} the risk of death. Because other therapies have shown a mortality benefit in congestive heart failure, maximizing other therapies (e.g., beta blockers) first is recommended before using <b>digoxin.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Digoxin,</b> {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} Lanoxin among others, is a {{medication}} used to treat various heart conditions. Most frequently it is used for atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, and heart failure. <b>Digoxin</b> is taken by mouth or by injection into a vein.|$|E
25|$|Diazepam may alter <b>digoxin</b> serum concentrations.|$|E
25|$|Summary of Product Characteristics, <b>Digoxin</b> 0,125mg, Zentiva a.s.|$|E
25|$|A 2008 study {{suggested}} <b>digoxin</b> has {{beneficial effects}} {{not only for}} the heart, but also in reducing the risk of certain kinds of cancer. However, comments on this study suggested that <b>digoxin</b> is not effective at reducing cancer risk at therapeutic concentrations of the drug, so the results need further investigation.|$|E
25|$|Furosemide may {{increase}} the risk of <b>digoxin</b> toxicity due to hypokalemia.|$|E
25|$|Diltiazem {{has been}} shown to be more {{effective}} than either <b>digoxin</b> or amiodarone.|$|E
25|$|<b>Digoxin</b> is {{also used}} as a {{standard}} control substance to test for P-glycoprotein inhibition.|$|E
25|$|<b>Digoxin</b> (a mildly {{positive}} inotrope {{and negative}} chronotrope), once used as first-line therapy, is now reserved {{for control of}} ventricular rhythm in patients with atrial fibrillation; or where adequate control is not achieved with an ACEI, a beta blocker and a loop diuretic. There {{is no evidence that}} <b>digoxin</b> reduces mortality in CHF, although some studies suggest a decreased rate in hospital admissions. It is contraindicated in cardiac tamponade and restrictive cardiomyopathy.|$|E
25|$|There is {{tentative}} {{evidence that}} <b>digoxin</b> {{may increase the}} risk of death, though another meta-analysis in 2015 reported no change in mortality.|$|E
25|$|<b>Digoxin</b> {{also affects}} the kidney by {{increased}} {{renal blood flow}} and increased glomerular filtration rate. A mild diuretic effect is seen only in heart failure.|$|E
25|$|Statins {{may also}} alter the {{concentrations}} of other drugs, such as warfarin or <b>digoxin,</b> leading to alterations in effect or a requirement for clinical monitoring.|$|E
25|$|<b>Digoxin</b> is {{no longer}} the first choice for heart failure, but can still be useful in people who remain {{symptomatic}} despite proper diuretic and ACE inhibitor treatment.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} {{indications}} for <b>digoxin</b> are atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response, though beta blockers and/or calcium channel blockers are often preferred.|$|E
25|$|Cardiac glycosides (e.g., <b>digoxin)</b> – {{have less}} use, apart from in {{older people who}} are sedentary. They are not as {{effective}} as either beta blockers or calcium channel blockers.|$|E
25|$|The main {{pharmacological}} {{effects of}} <b>digoxin</b> {{are on the}} heart. Extracardiac effects are responsible {{for some of the}} therapeutic and many of the adverse effects (see above). It exerts a mechanical effect as it increases myocardial contractility; however, the duration of the contractile response is only slightly increased. High ventricular rate leads to insufficient diastolic filling time. By slowing down the conduction in the AV node and increasing its refractory period, <b>digoxin</b> can reduce the ventricular rate. The arrhythmia itself is not affected, but the pumping function of the heart improves, owing to improved filling.|$|E
25|$|<b>Digoxin</b> is {{also used}} intrafetally or amniotically during abortions in the late second {{trimester}} and third trimester of pregnancy. It typically causes fetal demise (measured by cessation of cardiac activity) within hours of administration.|$|E
25|$|Some {{patients}} develop significant carditis which manifests as {{congestive heart}} failure. This requires the usual treatment for heart failure: ACE inhibitors, diuretics, beta blockers, and <b>digoxin.</b> Unlike normal heart failure, rheumatic heart failure responds well to corticosteroids.|$|E
25|$|In overdose, {{the usual}} {{supportive}} measures are needed. If arrhythmias prove troublesome, or malignant hyperkalaemia occurs (inexorably rising potassium level due to paralysis {{of the cell}} membrane-bound, ATPase-dependent Na/K pumps), the specific antidote is antidigoxin (antibody fragments against <b>digoxin,</b> trade names Digibind and Digifab).|$|E
25|$|Slight {{vasodilation}} is seen {{in heart}} failure. This effect is contrary to effects that {{should be seen as}} a result of increased intracellular calcium levels, but this occurs since <b>digoxin</b> improves hemodynamics, which leads to restored angiotensin levels and decreased sympathetic discharge, causing indirect vasodilation.|$|E
25|$|<b>Digoxin</b> {{preparations}} are marketed {{under the}} trade names Cardigox; Cardiogoxin; Cardioxin; Cardoxin; Coragoxine; Digacin; Digicor; Digomal; Digon; Digosin; Digoxine Navtivelle; Digoxina-Sandoz; Digoxin-Sandoz; Digoxin-Zori; Dilanacin; Eudigox; Fargoxin; Grexin; Lanacordin; Lanacrist; Lanicor; Lanikor; Lanorale; Lanoxicaps; Lanoxin; Lanoxin PG; Lenoxicaps; Lenoxin; Lifusin; Mapluxin; Natigoxin; Novodigal; Purgoxin; Sigmaxin; Sigmaxin-PG; Toloxin.|$|E
25|$|<b>Digoxin,</b> which {{decreases}} conduction {{of electrical}} impulses through the AV node and increases vagal activity via its central {{action on the}} central nervous system, via indirect action, leads {{to an increase in}} acetylcholine production, stimulating M2 receptors on AV node leading to an overall decrease in speed of conduction.|$|E
25|$|On December 22, 2011, Covis Pharma, a {{specialty}} pharmaceutical company owned by affiliates of Cerberus, {{announced that it}} had agreed to acquire full commercial rights for Fortaz (ceftazidime), Zinacef (cefuroxime), Lanoxin (<b>digoxin),</b> Parnate (tranylcypromine sulfate), and Zantac Injection (ranitidine hydrochloride) in the United States and Puerto Rico from GlaxoSmithKline.|$|E
25|$|ECG changes seen in {{a patient}} taking <b>digoxin</b> include {{increased}} PR interval (due to decreased AV conduction) and a shortened QT interval. Also, the T wave may be inverted and accompanied by ST depression. It may cause AV junctional rhythm and ectopic beats (bigeminy) resulting in ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation.|$|E
25|$|Cardiovascular {{features}} {{may include}} hypertension, {{and heart rate}} that may be rapid or irregular in character; these {{may be perceived as}} palpitations. Less common findings include left ventricular hypertrophy, premature atrial and ventricular contractions, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, angina, myocardial infarction, systemic embolization, death from cardiovascular collapse and resistance to some drug effects (<b>digoxin,</b> coumadin).|$|E
25|$|In February 1998, Cullen {{was hired}} by the Liberty Nursing and Rehabilitation Center in Allentown, Pennsylvania, where he staffed a ward of respirator-dependent {{patients}}. While at Liberty Hospital, Cullen was accused of giving patients drugs at unscheduled times, and was eventually fired after he was seen entering a patient's room with syringes in his hand. The patient ended up with a broken arm, but apparently received no injections. Cullen caused a patient's death at Liberty which was blamed on another nurse. After leaving Liberty Nursing and Rehab Center, Cullen was employed at Easton Hospital in Easton, Pennsylvania, from November 1998 to March 1999. On December 30, 1998, he murdered yet another patient with <b>digoxin.</b> A coroner's blood test showed lethal amounts of <b>digoxin</b> in the patient's blood, but an internal investigation within Easton Hospital was inconclusive; nothing pointed definitively to Cullen as the murderer.|$|E
25|$|The {{occurrence}} of adverse drug reactions is common, owing to its narrow therapeutic index (the margin between effectiveness and toxicity). Gynaecomastia (enlargement of breast tissue) is mentioned in many textbooks {{as a side}} effect, thought {{to be due to}} the estrogen-like steroid moiety of the <b>digoxin</b> molecule, but when systematically sought, the evidence for this is equivocal.|$|E
25|$|More than 10,000 {{cases of}} {{potential}} {{calcium channel blocker}} toxicity occurred in the United States in 2010. When death occurs in medicine overdose, heart medications are the cause more than 10% of time. The three most common types of heart medications that result in this outcome are calcium channel blockers along with beta blockers and <b>digoxin.</b>|$|E
25|$|Sertraline had {{no effect}} on the actions of <b>digoxin</b> and atenolol, which are not metabolized in the liver. Case reports suggest that taking {{sertraline}} with phenytoin or zolpidem may induce sertraline metabolism and decrease its efficacy, and that taking sertraline with lamotrigine may increase the blood level of lamotrigine, possibly by inhibition of glucuronidation.|$|E
