[...] In <b>Iso's</b> translated <b>words,</b> it conveys how [...] "there will always be a distance between people, and even between things that seem within ones' reach.

25|$|Terminology that {{is viewed}} by some as being more neutral and {{inclusive}} of non-Christian people is to call this the Current or Common Era (abbreviated as CE), with the preceding years referred to as Before the Common or Current Era (BCE).

5000|$|The {{name of the}} {{organization}} in French is Organisation internationale de normalisation, and in Russian, Международная организация по стандартизации (Mezhdunarodnaya organizatsiya po standartizatsii). ISO is not an acronym. The organization adopted ISO as its abbreviated name {{in reference to the}} Greek <b>word</b> <b>isos</b> ( [...] , meaning equal), as its name in the three official languages would have different acronyms. During the founding meetings of the new organization, the Greek word explanation was not invoked, so this meaning may have been made public later.|$|R
5000|$|Verification and {{validation}} are independent procedures {{that are used}} together for checking that a product, service, or system meets requirements and specifications and that it fulfills its intended purpose. These are critical components of a quality management system such as <b>ISO</b> 9000. The <b>words</b> [...] "verification" [...] and [...] "validation" [...] are sometimes preceded with [...] "independent", indicating that the verification {{and validation}} is to be performed by a disinterested third party.

500|$|The infraorder name Isoptera {{is derived}} from the Greek <b>words</b> <b>iso</b> (equal) and ptera (winged), which refers to the nearly equal size of the fore and hind wings.

5000|$|Isophysis is a genus of herbaceous, {{perennial}} and rhizomatous {{plants in}} the Iris family (Iridaceae). A monotypic genus formerly known as Hewardia, it contains a single species, Isophysis tasmanica, endemic to the mountains of Western Tasmania growing in heathland on sandy soils. It has grass-like foliage and star-like dark red-purple or yellow flowers with reflexed tepals. A characteristic feature of this species is its superior ovary, which distinguishes it from any other member of Iridaceae. The genus name {{is derived from the}} Greek <b>words</b> <b>iso,</b> meaning [...] "equal", and physis, meaning [...] "bladder".|$|R

40|$|This writing will be {{discussing}} about quality standard management implementation system of ISO 9001 : 2000 in library institution. The <b>word</b> <b>ISO</b> {{is taken from}} greek which means ‘same’ and 9001 is a standard related to quality management. The implementation of ISO in library is a sustainable process which needs all supports. To apply it, needs fourth steps; 1) planning. 2) document compiling and validating. 3) certification. The advantages of the implementation of ISO are: first, promoting the trust and library user satisfactory by means of organized and systematic quality insurance. Second, promoting, image and competitive strength in the global market. Third, promoting the awareness of library quality. Fourth, triggering and creating positive changes in terms of quality culture at the institution of library...|$|R
5000|$|An {{isoquant}} (derived from {{quantity and}} the Greek <b>word</b> <b>iso,</b> meaning equal) is a contour line drawn through {{the set of}} points at which the same quantity of output is produced while changing the quantities {{of two or more}} inputs. [...] While an indifference curve mapping helps to solve the utility-maximizing problem of consumers, the isoquant mapping deals with the cost-minimization problem of producers. Isoquants are typically drawn along with isocostcurves in capital-labor graphs, showing the technological tradeoff between capital and labor in the production function, and the decreasing marginal returns of both inputs. Adding one input while holding the other constant eventually leads to decreasing marginal output, and this is reflected {{in the shape of the}} isoquant. A family of isoquants can be represented by an isoquant map, a graph combining a number of isoquants, each representing a different quantity of output. Isoquants are also called equal product curves.|$|R

In my view, i summarize all ways how dog can help a person, therapeutically or by assistance. I was first introduced to the topic with the book:"Pes lékařem lídské duše", written by MUDr. Lenka Galajdová. More scientific title for me was the book, written by Prof. MUDr. Miloš Veleminský CSc., "Zooterapie ve světle objektivních poznatků". The book that i used third most frequently was " Animoterapie aneb Jak nás zvířata umí léčit", by Prof MUDr. Zoran Nerandžič. Also valuable resource for my work were the websites of organizations (SVVP, Helppes, Pomocné tlapky), where can be found general and specific informations. I choosed these organizations, because in my opinion, these organizations are the most famous and largest. As {{a part of my}} work, i had a opportunity to see canistherapy in practice at different target groups of clients. I also had the honor of having an interview with Misa Holasova, who is the owner of two guide dogs and a staff member for the "Středisko výcviku vodících psů".

5000|$|At {{the other}} end of the scale, the Kartvelian {{languages}} of Georgia are drastically more permissive of consonant clustering. Clusters in Georgian of four, five or six consonants are not unusual—for instance, [...] (flat), [...] (trainer) and [...] (peeling)—and if grammatical affixes are used, it allows an eight-consonant cluster: [...] (he's plucking us). Consonants cannot appear as syllable nuclei in Georgian, so this syllable is analysed as CCCCCCCCVC. The neighboring, but unrelated, Armenian language also allows for long consonant strings. For example, the classic transliterations k̕rt̕mndzhal and khghchmtank̕ of քրթմնջալ [...] ("to grumble") and խղճմտանք [...] ("conscience") start with eight consonants, though in the Armenian alphabet and the modern <b>ISO</b> 9985 transliteration <b>words</b> starting with more than six consonants are rare. Many Slavic languages may manifest almost as formidable numbers of consecutive consonants, such as in the Slovak words štvrť [...] ("quarter"), and žblnknutie [...] ("clunk"; [...] "flop") and the Slovene word skrbstvo [...] ("welfare"). However, the liquid consonants /r/ and /l/ can form syllable nuclei in West and South Slavic languages and behave phonologically as vowels in this case. An example of a true initial cluster is the Polish word wszczniesz ( [...] ("you will initiate"). In the Serbo-Croatian word opskrbljivanje [...] ("victualling") the [...] and [...] are digraphs representing single consonants: [...] and , respectively. Some Salishan languages exhibit long words with no vowels at all, such as the Nuxálk word : he had had in his possession a bunchberry plant. It is extremely difficult to accurately classify which of these consonants may be acting as the syllable nucleus, and these languages challenge classical notions of exactly what constitutes a syllable. The same problem is encountered in the Northern Berber languages.|$|R
