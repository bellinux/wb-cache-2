5|$|It's not literal {{about the}} drug for me, I've never taken lithium before. It's sort of a metaphor about {{numbness}} and happiness... it's me looking at happiness {{in a negative way}} because I've always been... kind of afraid to be happy. Like with the band and the art and everything else, it's always like I'm never letting myself break through into the happiness it seems like, because it's not cool or something. And describing happiness is lithium, it's like saying 'that's numbness, I won't be able to be an artist anymore if I'm happy', which is hilarious because that's just not true, I'm happy. So it's... this fight within the song of... 'do I do this and get out of here and get happy or do I wallow in it like I always do?' and it's cool because {{at the end of the}} song I say 'I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> go', like I am going to be happy.|$|E

500|$|The {{decision}} was not close, it was 7–2 on the principal {{issue of whether}} {{there had been a}} constitutional violation... But what if it was unconstitutional to have that recount? You're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> continue and come to a conclusion? And then overturn it? The reason to stop it sooner was not, [...] "Ooh, we're worried that it's going to come out the wrong way"... you forget what was going on at the time. We were the laughingstock of the world. The world's greatest democracy that couldn't conduct an election. We didn't know who our next president was going to be. The lengthy transition that has become standard when you change from one president to another could not begin because you didn't know who the new president was going to be. It was becoming a very serious problem. The issue before the United States Supreme Court is: having decided the case, having decided this is unconstitutional, should we nonetheless let the election go on? Or is it time cut it off and let's move on? ...|$|E

2500|$|Lamar's major-label debut, good kid, m.A.A.d city, was {{released}} on October 22, 2012. The album was met with critical acclaim and debuted at number two in the US, selling 242,100 copies in its first week. Later that year, Fuse TV listed Lamar's single, [...] "Backseat Freestyle" [...] among the top 40 songs of 2012. In a few months' time, the album was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). HipHopDX named Lamar [...] "Emcee of the Year" [...] for their 2012 Year-End honors. In November, after Cole posted pictures of himself and Lamar working in the studio, the latter revealed that the two are still working on a project, but an exact release date was not given for the joint album: [...] "We are going to drop that out the sky though. I don't want to give dates. I'm just <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> fall" [...] {{in an interview with}} the LA Leakers.|$|E
2500|$|Lind said of {{assuming}} the role, [...] "The audition for Bianca {{felt like an}} amusement park ride. It was such a thrill {{to go to an}} audition by plane rather than subway! I can only hope I do half of what [...] did with the part. She played it with amazing grace and dignity. Now I need to breathe my own life into it." [...] Regarding Bianca being the [...] "moral center of Pine Valley" [...] and the pressure of being a recast, Lind said she did feel pressure in the beginning. [...] "I did look at some of [...] footage online to prep for it. She, for obvious reasons, was so beautiful, real, and honest in her portrayal of Bianca." [...] Lind stated that it ultimately came down to her not wanting to mimic Riegel: Part of me feels very strongly that [...] created a character that was so well-written, detailed, and complicated, and the element of being gay was part of who she was, but it did not define her. I sort of wanted to take that and breathe my own life into it and do something else by using myself rather than using someone else’s interpretation. I understand these emotions and all humans do, of wanting to support your family and be equal and be in love. Ultimately, I said, [...] "I can feel the pressure, but I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> go." [...] The role is so full and rich that I thought, Well, now I am just going to throw myself into it.|$|E

[...] The state of Colorado banned picketing, but miners voted in mass meetings to ignore the state's ban.

Because of this, Matisse eventually abandoned the work after roughly 20 years of maintenance. He later stated, “I just kept it going, and then at one point I decided that I was just <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> go out on its own... Sort of like one’s kids.

5000|$|Paul Tinelli of Allmusic gave Mommy's Little Monster {{four out}} of five stars and called it [...] "the epitome of early-'80s {{suburban}} California punk and provided inspiration for many future Californians, including the Offspring and Rancid" [...] and said that it [...] "finds the band supplying plenty of attitude and aggression as they rip through nine tracks worth of hard, fast, power chord-filled tracks loaded with snarling anti-establishment lyrics and themes." [...] Tinelli also stated that [...] "The Creeps" [...] and [...] "Telling Them" [...] "show a young punk group that is very angry, and they were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> society know <b>it</b> whether they wanted to hear it or not", and adds that the title track [...] "Mommy's Little Monster" [...] "gives you a good idea of the characters Social Distortion was surrounded by in the scene of the day." ...|$|R

So this big thing just came up, and I ended up getting to do this. I'm happier that I got off the soap though. I mean I give all my credit to them, because I have learned so much from being on soap operas and working with amazing actors who've been on there for like thirty, forty years. It was an honor to work with them. It's definitely given me all my background. But getting off the soap opera helped me a lot too, because I can move on to bigger and better things. So I am definitely thankful I got to be on a soap opera though.|$|R

50|$|At Hasbro, Zacherle had the {{responsibility}} {{to come up with}} ideas for kids’ products.

The idea did not excite management in R&D at Hasbro, but Zacherle kept presenting it. She always wanted a horse and she knew other kids did too.
