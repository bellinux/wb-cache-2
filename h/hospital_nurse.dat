5|$|With the drama's setting being a hospital, {{numerous}} {{medical personnel}} appear regularly on the show, {{as well as}} several other recurring characters. Joe (Steven W. Bailey), is first shown as the owner of the Emerald City Bar and Grill, {{across the street from the}} hospital, which is a common relaxation area for the physicians. Also introduced in the pilot, is the legendary former surgeon, Dr. Ellis Grey (Kate Burton), Meredith's Alzheimer's-stricken mother, who appeared on the show until her death in season three. In the first season, Olivia Harper (Sarah Utterback), a nurse who appeared on the show occasionally until getting laid off in the merger with Mercy West, engages in sexual activity with O'Malley, giving him syphilis. Serving as an assistant and secretary to the Chief of Surgery, former nurse Patricia (Robin Pearson Rose), has appeared on the show since its debut. Tyler Christian (Moe Irvin), a <b>hospital</b> <b>nurse,</b> makes occasional appearances throughout the series. Within the second season, Bailey becomes pregnant by her husband, Tucker Jones (Cress Williams), who makes frequent appearances on Grey's Anatomy, until their divorce in season five. While Bailey takes a sabbatical, due to her pregnancy, the cheerful Dr. Sydney Heron (Kali Rocha), fills her position as the resident supervising Grey, Yang, Karev, O'Malley, and Stevens, and makes occasional appearances until the fifth season.|$|E

25|$|Brady's first {{witnesses}} {{during the}} trial included Betty Campbell, a model, who attended the September 5 party and testified that she saw Arbuckle {{with a smile on}} his face hours after the alleged rape occurred; Grace Hultson, a local <b>hospital</b> <b>nurse</b> who testified it was very likely that Arbuckle raped Rappe and bruised her body in the process; and Dr. Edward Heinrich, a local criminologist who claimed he found Arbuckle's fingerprints smeared with Rappe's blood on room 1219's bathroom door. Dr. Arthur Beardslee, the hotel doctor who had examined Rappe, testified that an external force seemed to have damaged the bladder. During cross-examination, Betty Campbell, however, revealed that Brady threatened to charge her with perjury if she did not testify against Arbuckle. Dr. Heinrich's claim to have found fingerprints was cast into doubt after McNab produced the St. Francis hotel maid, who testified that she had cleaned the room before the investigation even took place and did not find any blood on the bathroom door. Dr. Beardslee admitted that Rappe had never mentioned being assaulted while he was treating her. McNab was furthermore able to get Nurse Hultson to admit that the rupture of Rappe's bladder could very well have been a result of cancer, and that the bruises on her body could also have been a result of the heavy jewelry she was wearing that evening. During the defense stage of the trial, McNab called various pathology experts who testified that although Rappe's bladder had ruptured, there was evidence of chronic inflammation and no evidence of any pathological changes preceding the rupture; in other words, there was no external cause for the rupture.|$|E

40|$|Study objectives: To {{determine}} {{the relationship between}} consciousness of <b>hospital</b> <b>nurses</b> toward demented elderly 	 patients with critical illness and care toward delirium, and to examine caring for the protecting delirium. 	Design: Grounded theory approach. 	Setting: An acute ward in the geriatrics hospital and acute wards including ICU in the general hospital in A city. 	Participants: The study population consisted of 11 nurses working for acute wards in the hospitals. 	Results: Consciousness of <b>hospital</b> <b>nurses</b> related to delirium of demented geriatric patients with critical illness was 	 discovered in 3 categories and 10 subcategories, and 3 categories were mutually related. In this study, 	 communication formed acceptance process of <b>hospital</b> <b>nurses</b> were found. The demented elderly patients have 	 increased risks {{for the development of}} delirium and outcomes related to communication and circumstance which is 	 prevalent to ICU. While outcomes suggest that communication and circumstance are not merely risk factors for 	 adjusting for severity of illness, <b>hospital</b> <b>nurses</b> should notice patients' needs when providing critical care. 	 Additionally, acceptant process of <b>hospital</b> <b>nurses</b> showed emotional response. 	Conclusions: In this study, <b>hospital</b> <b>nurses</b> made therapy prior to any others. Delirium of demented old patients are 	 associated with complications and increased less likelihood of family support after recovery. Caring of critically ill elderly demented patients involved understanding of changing sign or cues. <b>Hospital</b> <b>nurses</b> should focus on how 	 to best care for protecting delirium, not see the illness, but watch on the human who has illness...|$|R
25|$|Himani Singh {{is played}} by Gurdeep Punj. She is Avatar's wife {{and the mother of}} Rohan, Dolly, Sunny, Nikki, and Bobby. She works as a <b>hospital</b> <b>nurse</b> and is often portrayed as dutiful, protective, and comedic. She loves her family and does {{everything}} to care for and protect them. She appears out of her element when she isn't nurturing them, especially Nikki, but as the series progresses, she begins to feel assured that her youngest children are in good hands and trusts that her husband and three elder children can look after Nikki and Bobby. She is notoriously conceited and enjoys bragging about her accomplishments, be they admirable, real, or otherwise. Himani used to work on the local news team and was also a poet in her high-school days. A running gag on the show is that she was involved in virtually every extracurricular activity at Arya College of Arts and Science, but still earned a nursing degree. She lets special opportunities go to her head, such as being on TV or singing in front of a group. She has a habit of taking any chance at publicity that may shine on her family to focus on her, but this never works out well; usually she ends up being cut from the project or tossed out of certain groups. Himani seldom accepts her children's misbehavior. It is revealed in the third special that she is pregnant again with her fifth child. In the middle of the third season, Himani quit her nursing job to be a stay-at-home mother to Nikki and Bobby. Himani is the equivalent of Amy Duncan in Good Luck Charlie, who {{is played by}} Leigh-Allyn Baker.|$|E

500|$|In October 1961 Jacques {{appeared}} on Desert Island Discs, {{and said that}} she would be too lonely on such a quiet island for someone of her temperament. By this time Carry On had become a leading film franchise, with the author Robert Ross describing it as a [...] "phenomenon". That year's film, Carry On Regardless, was the fifth in the series; Jacques received a fee of £100 for the small role of a disgruntled <b>hospital</b> <b>nurse,</b> who appeared briefly on screen alongside the English character actor Kynaston Reeves who played her cantankerous boss. Jacques was initially intended for a major part in the film, but she was unable to commit to a longer role because of ill health. She appeared in her sixth Carry On, Carry On Cabby, in 1963, as [...] "Peggy Hawkins", the emotionally neglected wife of taxi-firm boss [...] "Charlie", played by Sid James. Jacques later named the film as her favourite of the series, as she was allowed to drop her [...] "battleaxe" [...] persona and play the romantic lead opposite James.|$|E
500|$|The {{final version}} of the episode {{differed}} from the original concept. It was initially intended for Dean to be a [...] "huge loser" [...] in his new life; being a hunter is what gives him structure and purpose. Without hunting, he would be a jobless barfly. Kripke compared the new reality to a Charles Bukowski novel, but noted that the selfless Dean still preferred the new universe, with Sam happy and living a good life. However, executive producer Robert Singer and others convinced him to change this, because they did not think Dean would be happy suddenly waking up in such a reality. Another variation stemmed from Dean's lack of someone to confide innormally Sam is his confidant. Because the writers found it difficult to communicate Dean's feelings, early drafts of the script included a number of internal monologues. These were ultimately replaced by a scene in which he discusses the djinn with a professor. The studio wanted the scene of Dean and his girlfriend Carmen kissing on the sofa to include sex. However, Kripke could not work it into the script, because he found it unrealistic that she would deliberately be late for her job as a <b>hospital</b> <b>nurse.</b>|$|E

Upon arrival at Sharpstown General, Robinson Hill's blood pressure was 60/40; the <b>hospital</b> <b>nurse</b> promptly took a second reading, as she believed {{that she had made}} some sort of error. After determining that the reading was correct, the nurse believed Joan was in shock and placed a call to Dr. Walter Bertinot, who was named as his wife's attending physician by John Hill. [...] Bertinot, who knew Joan only socially, had no reason to believe she was seriously ill until the call from the <b>hospital</b> <b>nurse.</b> [...] Hill had described his wife's symptoms as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea; Bertinot initially thought she was suffering from influenza. When Bertinot arrived in Joan's hospital room, she recognized him and made reference to a party which they had both attended.

One yuan in the 1960s was equivalent to about 40 cents USD. Li recalled in a 1995 interview that: [...] "I found Pu Yi a honest man, a man who desperately needed my love {{and was ready to}} give me as much love as he could. When I was having even a slight case of flu, he was so worried I would die, that he refused to sleep at night and sat by my bedside until dawn so he could attend to my needs". Li also noted like everybody else who knew him that Puyi was an incredibly clumsy man, leading her to say: [...] "Once in a boiling rage at his clumsiness, I threatened to divorce him. On hearing this, he got down on his knees and, with tears in his eyes, he begged me to forgive him. I shall never forget what he said to me: 'I have nothing in this world except you, and you are my life. If you go, I will die'. But apart from him, what did I ever have in the world?".|$|E
