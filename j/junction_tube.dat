50|$|Tube flies are {{threaded}} on a tippet {{instead of}} the traditional method of tying the fly to the tippet. The angler threads a tippet through the tube and attaches the tippet to a hook. Hooks used for tube flies are typically short shank, wide gap hooks. Once tied to the tippet, the hook is pulled into a <b>junction</b> <b>tube</b> attached {{to the rear of}} the tube fly. When a fish is hooked, the fly is typically dislodged from the hook and slides up the tippet. This protects the fly from damage by the fishes teeth. The use of wide gap, short shank hooks with tube flies provides less leverage for fish and results in higher hookup rates over traditional style flies. An additional advantage results from the ability to replace dulled or damaged hooks without replacing the fly. Tube fly hooks can be oriented with hook point down or up depending on conditions.|$|E

40|$|Properties of {{partially}} molten rocks depend strongly on the grain-scale melt distribution. Experimental samples show {{a variety}} of microstructures, such as melt lenses, layers, and multigrain melt pools, which are not readily explained using the theory for melt distribution based on isotropic interface energies. These microstructures affect the melt distribution and the porosity-permeability relation. It is still unclear how the melt distribution changes with increasing melt fraction. In this study, electrical conductivity measurements and microstructural investigation with scanning electron microscopy and electron backscatter diffraction are combined to analyze the melt distribution in synthetic, partially molten, iron-free olivine rocks with 0. 01 – 0. 1 melt fraction. The electrical conductivity data are compared with the predictions of geometric models for melt distribution. Both the conductivity data and the microstructural data indicate {{that there is a}} gradual change in the melt distribution with melt fraction (Xm) between 0. 01 and 0. 1. At a melt fraction of 0. 01, the melt is situated in a network of triple <b>junction</b> <b>tubes,</b> and almost all grain boundaries are free from melt layers. At 0. 1, the melt is situated in a network of grain boundary melt layers, as well as occupying the triple junctions.

These developments make the prospect of using CNT as molecular wires and possibly as electronic devices an even more interesting one. We have been modeling various electronic properties such as the density of states and the transmission coefficient of CNT wires and junctions. These studies involve first calculating the stability of junctions using molecular dynamics simulations and then calculating the electronic properties using a pi-electron tight binding Hamiltonian. We have developed the expertise to calculate the electronic properties of both finite-sized CNT and CNT systems with semi-infinite boundary conditions. In this poster, we will present an overview {{of some of our}} results. The electronic application of CNT that is most promising at this time is their use as molecular wires. The conductance can however be greatly reduced because of reflection due to defects and contacts. We have modeled the transmission through CNT in the presence of two types of defects: weak uniform disorder and strong isolated scatterers. We find that the conductance is affected in significantly different manners due to these defects Junctions of CNT have also been imaged using STM. This makes it essential to derive rules for the formation of <b>junctions</b> between <b>tubes</b> of different chirality, study their relative energies and electronic properties.

In the original technique, several measurements are taken of a system—a 2 -meter long cylindrical tube with a speaker and co-located microphone at one end and incrementally varying termination conditions at the other. Each measured impulse response yields a sequence of multiple evenly spaced arrivals from which estimates of waveguide element transfer functions, including the bell reflection and transmission, may be formed. Use of this technique to measure a complete saxophone presents a number of difficulties stemming {{from the fact that the}} bell is not easily separated from the bore for an isolated measurement.

C 57 BL 6 /J mice were randomized into four groups and injected with PBS or OX-LDL, together with Sal A for one week.
