5|$|The {{original}} church {{within this}} movement, founded in April 1830 in New York by Joseph Smith, was the Church of Christ, which was later named the Church of the Latter Day Saints.

This organization subsequently splintered into several different denominations, {{each of which}} {{claims to be the}} legitimate continuation of this original church, and most of which dispute the right of other denominations within the movement to claim this distinction.|$|E

5|$|The two strongest {{succession}} {{candidates were}} Brigham Young, senior member {{and president of}} the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, and Sidney Rigdon, the senior member of the First Presidency. In a church-wide conference on August 8, most of the Latter Day Saints elected Young, who led them to the Utah Territory as The Church of <b>Jesus</b> <b>Christ</b> <b>of</b> Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Membership in Young's denomination surpassed 14 million members in 2010. Smaller groups followed Sidney Rigdon and James J. Strang, who had based his claim on an allegedly-forged letter of appointment. Others followed Lyman Wight and Alpheus Cutler. Many members of these smaller groups, including most of Smith's family, eventually coalesced in 1860 under the leadership of Joseph Smith III and formed what was known {{for more than a century}} as the Reorganized Church of <b>Jesus</b> <b>Christ</b> <b>of</b> Latter Day Saints (now Community of Christ), which now has about 250,000 members. , members of the denominations originating from Smith's teachings number approximately 15 million.|$|E
