Previous studies using tertiary amines to extract water from reagent-grade carboxylate salts (calcium acetate, propionate, and butyrate) have shown selectivity for water and not for the carboxylate salts. These results allow the design of an extraction system to concentrate fermentation broth from a mixed culture of acid-forming microorganisms. To design the extraction system, equilibrium data from amine and actual fermentation broth systems were obtained. These data are similar to the data found previously for reagent-grade pure components. The data were manipulated to obtain graphs for the Ponchon-Savarit procedure used to design multi-stage extractors. Different cases were studied in which the feed was varied. A 3. 8 wt% solution could be concentrated to 17. 5 wt% using five countercurrent stripping stages; however, the recovery of carboxylate salts was poor (68 wt%) with this design. To overcome this, a reflux stream and an <b>enriching</b> <b>section</b> were employed. The Janecke procedure was followed to determine the member of equilibrium stages for the skipping and the enriching sections and their operating conditions. For this case, eight stages (two enriching and six stripping) were required to concentrate the carboxylate salts from an initial concentration of 3. 8 up to 20 wt%. The salt recovery was 91 %, the amine:water ratio was 2. 5 : 1 and the reflux:feed ratio was 2. 4 : 1. This design gives good results and will be implemented in a pilot plant. To study the separation of the organic and aqueous phases, a bench-scale mixer/settler extraction tank was designed and constructed. This apparatus had three sections: a mixing section to blend the two phases, a coalescence section in which the amine and water phases coalesce, and a decanting section in which the liquids completely separate. Several experiments were made to determine the hydrodynamic properties of the mixer/settler. The experiments showed that the apparatus is suitable to perform liquid-liquid extraction. Independent experiments were made using a coalesced apparatus to better analyze what occurs in the coalescing section. A model to describe the hydrodynamic of the liquid mixture in the coalesced apparatus was applied to the system giving good agreement with the experimental data...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1969 Comparative {{ecological}} {{studies of}} Sialis californica Banks and Sialis rotunda Banks {{were made in}} Western Oregon from 1966 to 1968. Field collections for S. rotunda were made in fish holding pond at the Oak Creek laboratories, 5 miles west of Corvallis, Benton County, and for S. californica in <b>enriched</b> <b>sections</b> of Berry Creek experimental stream, 13 miles north of Corvallis. Life histories were determined in aquaria, in laboratory streams and the natural habitats. S. rotunda, predominantly a pond species, completed its life cycle in one year in all situations. S. californica, commonly a stream species, took {{one or two years}} depending on oviposition time and food availability. Both species were reared successfully in the laboratory through all stages of their life cycle. There are ten larval instars. The larvae are carnivorous and feed on insects and other small benthic organisms. Biweekly or monthly samples were collected from the two locations for density, biomass, growth rate and production studies. Density and biomass of S. rotunda in the pond were much higher than for S. californica in the stream. Enrichment with sucrose and urea resulted in differences in density and biomass of S. californica between the four experimental sections at Berry Creek. The unenriched section usually had a high density but low or similar biomass compared with the <b>enriched</b> <b>sections</b> which had few individuals. The lower density in the <b>enriched</b> <b>sections</b> was associated with unfavorable substrate conditions for early-instar larvae because of dense mats of the filamentous bacterium, Sphaerotilus natans. Larger larvae were not hindered by the S. natans filaments and had rapid growth because food was abundant. Production of both species was calculated by two methods: (1) Ricker's (1946) method, the product of growth rate and mean biomass; and (2) Allen's (1951) graphical method, using numbers per m² and mean individual weight at each sampling date, The results from both methods were comparable, with the graphical method usually providing a slightly higher estimate of production. Annual production of S. rotunda in the pond was 13. 18 Kilocalories/ m². This was more than double the production of S. californica in any of the sections of Berry Creek. In Berry Creek, the population in the unenriched section had low growth rate but the density of larvae resulted in high biomass and a comparable production to that in the <b>enriched</b> <b>sections.</b> The accumulated annual production was: unenriched, 4. 94 Kilocalories; enriched, 6, 34 Kilocalories. The relationship between larval growth and food consumption rate was established by experiments in laboratory streams during summer and winter. These data were used to estimate food consumption by field populations. In the pond, S. rotunda larvae consumed 137 gms/m²/year. In Berry Creek, individuals in <b>enriched</b> <b>sections</b> consumed one and half to two times more food than did individuals in the unenriched section...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1966 This thesis {{reports a}} portion of a general {{ecological}} study of a stream under conditions of controlled flow and low levels of organic enrichment. It is concerned with the effects of experimental variations of light intensity and concentration of soluble organic enrichment imposed on seasonal variations of temperature and total light energy received upon the periphyton and benthic plants. Suitable enrichment was predicated on establishment and maintenance of an abundant growth of Sphaerotilus and involved the isolation and study of this organism in pure cultures, in laboratory streams {{as well as in the}} experimental stream. Abundant growth of Sphaerotilus was obtained in cultures at temperatures of 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 °C while in the laboratory streams and the experimental stream, the organism produced abundant growths at a range of temperatures from 2 to 12 °C. A variety of carbon and nitrogen sources was investigated for maintenance of growth of Sphaerotilus. Abundant growth was produced when the enrichment included a specific nitrogen source combined with a specific carbon source. A carbon-nitrogen ratio of 8 to 1 proved satisfactory for maintaining Sphaerotilus in the stream. An investigation of the cropping effect of stream snails indicated that the presence of large numbers of snails decreased the standing crop of Sphaerotilus both in the laboratory streams and the experimental stream. A method was devised for determining the daily mean percentages of full sunlight reaching the four experimental sections of Berry Creek. Approximately 4 percent reached the shaded sections and 50 percent reached the light sections during the summer months. The range of mean saturating light intensities on the four experimental sections was from 250 to 950 footcandles. Methods designed to sample the plant communities in the experimental sections of the stream included: artificial substrates (microscope slides) used to observe the density and diversity of micro-algae; a system of grids used to record distribution of the plant biomass; and the removal of {{a portion of}} the stream substrate for the detailed examination of the benthic community. Both microscopic and macroscopic observations indicated that twice as many species and greater numbers of autotrophic organisms were present in the unenriched than in the <b>enriched</b> <b>sections.</b> Sub-samples of the harvested and homogenized materials scoured from the stream substrate, were used to determine biomass, organic matter, caloric content and pigment content. The biomasses from the <b>enriched</b> <b>sections</b> were greater than those from the unenriched sections, but contained large amounts of silt and were lower in organic matter and caloric content. The mean percentages of organic matter for the sections were: shaded, unenriched- 33; light, unenriched- 42; shaded, enriched- 19 and light, enriched- 19. The range of chlorophyll a from the four experimental sections was 0. 03 to 0. 28 g/m². The concentration of chlorophyll, when representing spatial and seasonal variations, is an acceptable measure of the productive ability of communities in shallow, rapidly flowing streams. A photosynthesis-respiration chamber was used to determine primary production and community respiration for each of the experimental sections. The range of rates of gross primary production expressed as mean O₂,g /m²/day for the unenriched sections was 0. 62 - 2. 47 and 0. 53 - 0. 59 for the <b>enriched</b> <b>sections.</b> Annual rates of gross primary production in glucose equivalents ranged from 0. 07 kg/m² for the <b>enriched</b> <b>sections</b> to 0. 30 for the unenriched. The stream communities were characterized as heterotrophic communities with production-respiration ratios ranging from 0. 47 - 0. 65 for the unenriched and 0. 16 - 0. 20 for the <b>enriched</b> <b>sections.</b> The efficiency of the fixation of light energy as organic matter was 1. 90 - 2. 23 for the unenriched and 0. 37 - 2. 70 for the <b>enriched</b> <b>sections.</b> The photosynthetic efficiencies of the communities on the experimental sections of Berry Creek were much lower than those reported for most laboratory communities, but were comparable to other natural aquatic communities...|$|R

40|$|The {{concentrations}} {{and chemical}} partitioning of heavy metals in the sediment cores of the Pearl River Estuary were studied. Based on Pearson correlation coefficients and {{principal component analysis}} results, Al {{was selected as the}} concentration normalizer for Pb, while Fe was used as the normalizing element for Co, Cu, Ni and Zn. In each profile, sections with metal concentrations exceeding the upper 95 % prediction interval of the linear regression model were regarded as metal enrichment layers. The heavy metal accumulation mainly occurred at sites in the western shallow water areas and east channel, which reflected the hydraulic conditions and influence from riparian anthropogenic activities. Heavy metals in the enrichment sections were evaluated by a sequential extraction method for possible chemical forms in sediments. Since the residual, Fe/Mn oxides and organic/sulfide fractions were dominant geochemical phases in the <b>enriched</b> <b>sections,</b> the bioavailability of heavy metals in sediments was generally low. The 206 Pb/ 207 Pb ratios in the metal-enriched sediment sections also revealed the influence of anthropogenic sources. The spatial distribution of cumulative heavy metals in the sediments suggested that the Zn and Cu mainly originated from point sources, while the Pb probably came from non-point sources in the estuary.

40|$|Graduation date: 1970 Most {{studies of}} {{bacteria}} in water have concerned public health; {{little attention has}} been given to organisms which are indigenous to the aquatic environment. Myxobacteria are known to occur in soil, in the marine environment, and several have been studied in relation to diseases of salmonid fishes. However, little information is available regarding the role of myxobacteria in the freshwater environment. The major purpose of this research was to obtain data on the occurrence, distribution, and activities of aquatic myxobacteria in a woodland stream. As a preliminary step for studying the ecology of myxobacteria in the freshwater stream, a culture medium and procedure were developed to provide a means for isolation and enumeration of these organisms. Enumeration of myxobacteria was based on the morphology of the colonies growing on the dilute nutrient medium, cytophaga peptonized milk agar (CPM). The low nutrient concentration of this medium favored spreading of the myxobacterial colony and the production of rhizoid edge patterns which are typical of myxobacteria and distinguishable from eubacterial colonies. The enumeration method was used to obtain data on the occurrence and distribution of myxobacteria as compared to the total bacteria population in Berry Creek. Results of the ecological study conducted over a two and a half year period indicate that myxobacteria are present in this aquatic environment all during the year with highest levels obtained in the fall (October and November) and lowest levels during the summer (July and August). Seasonal variations also occurred in the types of myxobacteria comprising the population of the stream. It {{is interesting to note that}} peaks in the myxobacterial and the total bacterial populations occurred in advance of the peak in flow rate. Water temperature and flow rate did not seem to influence the population levels as might be expected if the myxobacteria were transient members of the microbial flora. Additional surveys have shown that the myxobacteria are widespread in fresh water; they have been found in abundance in bottom sediments and surface films as well as in the flowing waters. Myxobacteria also appear to be well adapted to the aquatic environment. It was shown that they are able to utilize the dilute nutrients present in water for their growth. In an attempt to determine the possible role myxobacteria play in the aquatic environment, the predominant myxobacterial types were isolated and studied morphologically and biochemically. All the organisms studied corresponded to the classical definition of myxobacterial cells: gram negative, slender, weakly refractile rodshaped bacteria which exhibit gliding motility. Colony morphology of these myxobacteria plated on CPM has been studied in detail and found to be a constant characteristic of the particular type of myxobacteria isolate. Photographs of several of the predominant forms present in the stream samples illustrate the distinguishable morphology of the myxobacterial colonies. Six morphological groups have been arbitrarily designated on the basis of colony morphology; these morphological groups also show similarities in their biochemical capabilities. Biochemical studies on the myxobacterial isolates indicated that most of the strains were able to utilize simple carbohydrates. All of the isolates were capable of degrading various macromolecules, such as chitin, starch, aesculin, caesin, gelatin, and carboxy methyl cellulose. One of the isolates obtained was strictly proteolytic. The ability to hydrolyze macromolecules appears to be characteristic of aquatic isolates as well as of other myxobacteria. One myxobacterium isolated was believed to be intimately associated with the sheathed bacterium, Sphaerotilus natans. The latter organism was abundant in the sucrose and urea <b>enriched</b> <b>section</b> of Berry Creek. This myxobacterium could not utilize sucrose or urea and occurred only in the <b>enriched</b> <b>section</b> of the stream when Sphaerotilus was present. The fish pathogen, Chondrococcus columnaris was also isolated from Berry Creek water. This myxobacterium can be distinguished from the other aquatic myxobacteria on the basis of its unique colony morphology. This strain of C. columnaris proved to be one of the common serological types found in the Pacific Northwest. Based on the results obtained thus far, it is possible to speculate on the role of myxobacteria in the freshwater environment. All of the myxobacteria isolated in this study are capable of decomposing complex materials, it seems likely therefore, that these organisms may be active in the decomposition of such complex organic compounds, including the remains of other bacterial cells, which are present in the aquatic habitat. Since the isolates studied are also able to utilize the nutrients present at low levels in the stream water, these myxobacteria are not dependent on macromolecular substrates. Myxobacteria with these abilities are apparently well adapted to the aquatic environment...|$|R

40|$|We {{undertake}} a regularity {{analysis of the}} solutions to initial/boundary value problems for the (third-order in time) Moore-Gibson-Thompson (MGT) equation. The key to the present investigation is that the MGT equation falls within a large class of systems with memory, with affine term depending on a parameter. For this model equation a regularity theory is provided, which is of also independent interest; it is shown in particular {{that the effect of}} boundary data that are square integrable (in time and space) is the same displayed by wave equations. Then, a general picture of the (interior) regularity of solutions corresponding to homogeneous boundary conditions is specifically derived for the MGT equation in various functional settings. This confirms the gain of one unity in space regularity for the time derivative of the unknown, a feature that sets the MGT equation apart from other PDE models for wave propagation. The adopted perspective and method of proof enables us to attain as well the (sharp) regularity of boundary traces.

The numerical solution of the partial differential equations of the mathematical model, obtained using a digital computer, was found to be fast, accurate and stable. The advantages obtained by using this approach, compared With previous analytical solutions, included: no restriction on the equilibrium relationship which could be used, variable coefficients could he used in the partial differential equations, and the method allowed any desired boundary conditions to be used, The model was first solved for an <b>enriching</b> column <b>section,</b> and was later extended to the cases of batch and continuous columns.

However, the predicted time scale of the response was from 0. 6 to 2. 2 times faster than the measured time scale.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyse the interplay between the EU’s {{external}} (pre-accession) and internal (post-accession) governance model in the field of competition law and to reach a deeper understanding of the EU’s Europeanization strategy at the intersection of these two governance models. The paper will critically examine the effectiveness of the internal governance mechanisms of Regulation 1 / 2003 with regard to the goals of the decentralized enforcement system, as well as with regard to their effectiveness in steering post-accession compliance and Europeanization among the Member States. Following the Introduction, section II of the paper maps out the EU’s external law and governance model that applies vis-à-vis third countries that wish to join the EU. In section III, the paper examines the extent and the manner in which this external model has shaped the EU’s internal governance model vis-à-vis its Member States. Section IV analyses Regulation 1 / 2003 as the main driver behind the effective implementation of EU competition law in the Member States as well as its governance mechanisms as they framed the Europeanization process. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of post-accession compliance, section IV examines the compound procedural framework, composed of EU and national administrative rules, which underlies and challenges the enforcement of EU competition law. Also specifically investigated here is how the administrative capacity of national competition authorities affects competition law enforcement. This inquiry is <b>enriched</b> in <b>section</b> V with a detailed assessment of the European Competition Network as the EU’s main mechanism for the monitoring of Member States’ postaccession compliance with EU law...|$|R

It is explained that although such a move would make a representa- tional analysis of Poznań-Cracow Voicing straightforward, the presence of the element {L} on non-obstruents is against the tenets of the phonological model. The article is organised as follows. Section 1 presents a selection of voice phenomena in Pol- ish. Section 2 introduces the basic concepts of Government Phonology relevant to the analysis. Section 3 summarises Gussmann’s (2007) analysis of voice phenomena in Polish. Section 4 dis- cusses the differences between Warsaw Polish and Poznań-Cracow Polish in terms of voice as- similation. Section 5 briefly summarises two earlier analyses of voice phenomena in Polish that account for Poznań-Cracow Voicing, namely Gussmann’s (1992) SPE-type analysis of SEGMENT- TO-CONSONANT SPREADING, and Rubach’s (1996) Lexical Phonology (LP) analysis of CRACOW SPREAD.

The set of data is being significantly <b>enriched</b> for cross <b>section</b> and spin observables in the elastic nucleon-deuteron scattering and the break-up process at proton energies lower than 200 MeV [1, 2, 3, 4]. Theoretical formulation of 3 N scattering based on modern nucleon-nucleon (NN) forces has matured in recent years, and computationally accurate solutions of the 3 N Faddeev equation can be achieved [5].

In fact, everything concerning the discovery of the great underground lakes of petroleum, and subterranean spaces of natural gas, which suddenly <b>enriched</b> certain <b>sections</b> of the state, and then with their exhaustion left them to lapse into ruin, is picturesque and dramatic. Many tales are told of poor farmers who struck oil on their lands, and sold them for sums greater than they had ever dreamed of, and then went out into the world to waste their wealth in a few years of wild riot, or sank down and led idle and useless lives in sight of the fields they had once tilled. Similar stories are told of the regions where natural gas has been found, and some day, when the chronicles of Findlay, in Hancock County are fully written we shall know all these romantic episodes in their grotesqueness and their pathos. It had been known from the earliest settlement of the country that the natural gas underlay the town, and fifty years ago two small wells were sunk. But it was not until after the discovery of the natural gas at Pittsburg that the people of Findlay began to think of turning their treasure to account. Then, in the year 1884, the first great well was bored, and sent into the startled air a shaft of flame sixty feet high. Other wells were sunk, and the greatest of all, the famous Karg well, shook its flag of fire against the sky with a roar like that of Niagara, and made its voice heard fifteen miles away. It was winter when it was first lighted, but it made summer for two hundred yards around. The snow melted, the grass and wild flowers sprang up, and the crickets came and trilled in the grateful warmth. By a sad irony this source of future wealth became the refuge of homeless men, and within its genial circuit many tramps slept sweetly, secure from the winter beyond.|$|R
40|$|SOCE (store-operated calcium entry) is a {{ubiquitous}} cellular mechanism {{linking the}} calcium {{depletion of the}} ER (endoplasmic reticulum) to the activation of PM (plasma membrane) Ca 2 +-permeable channels. The activation of SOCE channels favours the entry of extracellular Ca 2 + into the cytosol, thereby promoting the refilling of the depleted ER Ca 2 + stores {{as well as the}} generation of long-lasting calcium signals. The molecules that govern SOCE activation comprise ER Ca 2 + sensors [STIM 1 (stromal interaction molecule 1) and STIM 2], PM Ca 2 +-permeable channels {Orai and TRPC [TRP (transient receptor potential) canonical]} and regulatory Ca 2 +-sensitive cytosolic proteins {CRACR 2 [CRAC (Ca 2 + release-activated Ca 2 + current) regulator 2]}. Upon Ca 2 + depletion of the ER, STIM molecules move towards the PM to bind and activate Orai or TRPC channels, initiating calcium entry and store refilling. This molecular rearrangement is accompanied by the formation of specialized compartments derived from the ER, the pre-cER (cortical ER) and cER. The pre-cER appears on the electron microscope as thin ER tubules enriched in STIM 1 that extend along microtubules and that are devoid of contacts with the PM. The cER is located in immediate proximity to the PM and comprises thinner <b>sections</b> <b>enriched</b> in STIM 1 and devoid of chaperones that might be dedicated to calcium signalling. Here, we review the molecular interactions and the morphological changes in ER structure that occur during the SOCE process...|$|R
40|$|Emerging from a joint AHRC/ESRC-funded project, The Experience of Worship in {{late medieval}} Cathedral and Parish Church (2009 – 13), this {{doctoral}} thesis offers a chronological {{trajectory of the}} liturgical development of the Mass and Office of the Holy Name of Jesus, and in so doing, seeks to provide fresh perspectives on {{the significance of the}} name ‘Jesus’. Jesus Mass was {{one of a number of}} liturgies chosen by the project research team to enact as worship, with the texts, chants, spaces, ritual artefacts, vestments and furniture appropriate for the 1530 s. My brief was to collaborate with other members of the research team in preparing the Jesus Mass texts and other textual resources for enactments in two different spaces, to participate as a singer in the enactment itself, and to reflect upon the experience after its last iteration. As a result of this high degree of involvement, a possible direction for research presented itself, as summarised below. Section I addresses the wider contextual issues of the devotion to the Holy Name, beginning with a study of the origins and occurrences of the Holy Name in the New Testament. It then traces the later development of the Name as the object of devotion in the West and more specifically in England during the Middle Ages, until it attains an officially recognised liturgical expression in the late fifteenth century. Section II of the thesis then focuses on the emerging Sarum Feast of the Holy Name (7 August) more specifically, with reference to the associated Mass and Office. It offers a survey of the evolvement of the observance through manuscript and printed liturgical sources of Sarum and other Uses, and of the extent of guild activity and musical provision during the period 1480 – 1530, both indicative of the extent of its practice nationwide. Section III provides an analysis of the emerging themes in both Mass and Office Propers, drawn from a variety of associated sources – scriptural, devotional and theological, which help construct an understanding of the significance of the Name. This is further <b>enriched</b> in <b>Section</b> IV by an exploration of the Feast of the Transfiguration (6 August), celebrated the day before the Holy Name, according to the Sarum Kalendar. In the final section the focus returns to the enactment, and explains the process whereby the Mass texts were transformed into a working edition with text, notation and rubrics, ready to be animated into an act of worship taking place as if in the late Middle Ages, but in 2011...|$|R
40|$|Gamma-emitting {{radionuclides}} are {{a natural}} {{source of radiation}} {{that can be a}} concern for human health, therefore {{it is important to know}} the radionuclide backgrounds in soils and to assess their mobility and transfer in ecosystems. Concentrations of natural radionuclides were determined in soils from a small catchment in the middle mountain environment of the Central Spanish Pyrenees. Radioisotope activities were well within the natural ranges for soil, averaging 27, 26, 32 and 500 Bq kg- 1 for 238 U, 226 Ra, 208 Tl and 40 K, respectively. Their distributions in the soil profile were analysed along three transects of contrasting physiography and soil type. Uranium was depleted in upper layers of the soil and slightly <b>enriched</b> in deeper <b>sections,</b> while 226 Ra, 40 K and 208 Tl were more uniformly distributed. Radionuclide activities in the Calcaric Regosols on the shrub slope were less than those in the deeper and better developed Haplic Kastanozems under forest and in Calcaric Fluvisols in the valley bottom. These spatial patterns seem to be affected by the soil type; other landscape features, such as slope orientation and vegetation cover, appeared to have an indirect effect. The results indicate that the depth distribution of the radionuclides is affected by some soil properties, including pH, carbonates, organic matter and particle size, and soil processes, such as leaching and adsorption.

40|$|The {{diagenesis}} and geochemical {{evolution of}} deep-sea sediments {{are controlled by}} the interaction between sediments and their associated pore waters. With increasing depth, the pore water of Hole 149 (DSDP) exhibits a strong depletion in Mg and a corresponding enrichment in Ca, while the alkalinity remains relatively constant. Dissolved SiO 2 is nearly constant in the upper 100 m of sediment, but is highly enriched in the deepest pore waters. The pore waters exhibit a depletion in K with increasing depth, and O 18 /O 16 pore water ratios also decrease. The sediment section has three zones of sedimentary regimes with increasing depth in the drill hole: an upper 100 m section of detrital clays, a middle <b>section</b> <b>enriched</b> in calc-akalic volcanics which have undergone submarine weathering to a smectite phase, and a lower section of siliceous ooze which still has a diagenetic smectite phase. The quartz-feldspar ratios and O 18 /O 16 composition of the silicate phases are in agreement with these interpretations. The submarine weathering of volcanics to a smectite can account for the observed pore water gradients. Volcanics release Ca and Mg to the pore waters causing the alkalinity values to increase. Smectite is formed, depletes the pore waters in Mg and O 18 and causes the alkalinity to decrease. The net reaction allows for the observed relationship between pore water Ca and Mg gradients with little net change in alkalinity. Given the abundance of volcanics in many deep-sea sediments, especially in lower sections which often form near ridge crests, the submarine formation of smectite may be an additional oceanic Mg sink which {{has not yet been}} fully considered...|$|R

40|$|Model-based {{optimisation}} {{is demonstrated}} {{for the design}} and analysis of two generalised membrane systems: a single stage permeator {{in which there is}} the recycle of both retentate and permeate gases, and a continuous membrane column in which there is the additional recycle of the retentate stream to the feed line. Multitubular shell-and-tube arrangements are considered with the counter-current flow of tube and shell-side gases; attention is given to the separation of air over several commercial polymeric membranes. A finite element technique is used for the solution of the model equations, and optimisation achieved through standard successive reduced quadratic programming methods. In specific, the maximisation of the Rony separation index is considered at various user-specified product oxygen purities. On this basis, a membrane column is shown to out-perform a single-stage permeator. Optimisation of the Rony index also leads to favourable composition profiles in the <b>enricher</b> and stripper <b>sections</b> of the membrane column, in which, for example, reverse permeation is avoided, and the extent of mixing (dilution) of feed minimised. Furthermore, the optimisation strategy is found to be approximately analogous to the maximisation of the equivalent pure oxygen and nitrogen production rates. Optimisation results for the membrane column indicate the benefits of a relatively small degree of retentate reflux, but negligible benefit of any retentate recycle to the feed line. For a given membrane column size and feed processing rate, membranes of low selectivity (but high permeability) are also shown to yield more favourable molar splits of oxygen and nitrogen than membranes of high selectivity, but at the expense of compressor power requirements. Issues of membrane column scale-up and intensification are also addressed by application of scaling ratio theory to the optimal designs. The theory indicates that for a membrane column designed for the maximum molar split of oxygen and nitrogen, a reduction in compressor power, whilst maintaining this split, can only be achieved at the expense of reduced feed throughput.

40|$|Development of {{colorectal}} cancer (CRC) can occur both via gene mutations in tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes, {{as well as}} via epigenetic changes, including DNA methylation. Site-specific methylation in CRC regulates expression of tumor-associated genes. Right-sided colon tumors more frequently have BRAF (p. V 600 E) mutations and have higher methylation grades when compared to left-sided malignancies. The {{aim of this study}} was to identify DNA methylation changes associated with BRAF (p. V 600 E) mutation status. We performed methylation profiling of colon tumor DNA, isolated from frozen <b>sections</b> <b>enriched</b> for epithelial cells by macro-dissection, and from paired healthy tissue. Single gene analyses comparing BRAF (p. V 600 E) with BRAF wild type revealed MEIS 1 as the most significant differentially methylated gene (log 2 fold change: 0. 89, false discovery rate-adjusted P-value 2. 8 * 10 (- 9)). This finding was validated by methylation-specific PCR that was concordant with the microarray data. Additionally, validation in an independent cohort (n= 228) showed a significant association between BRAF (p. V 600 E) and MEIS 1 methylation (OR: 13. 0, 95 % CI: 5. 2 - 33. 0, P< 0. 0001). MEIS 1 methylation was associated with decreased MEIS 1 gene expression in both patient samples and CRC cell lines. The same was true for gene expression of a truncated form of MEIS 1, MEIS 1 D 27, which misses exon 8 and has a proposed tumor suppression function. To trace the origin of MEIS 1 promoter methylation, 14 colorectal tumors were flow-sorted. Four out of eight BRAF (p. V 600 E) tumor epithelial fractions (50 %) showed MEIS 1 promoter methylation, as well as three out of eight BRAF (p. V 600 E) stromal fractions (38 %). Only one out of six BRAF wild type showed MEIS 1 promoter methylation in both the epithelial tumor and stromal fractions (17 %). In conclusion, BRAF (p.

40|$|Mass {{dependent}} {{isotope fractionation}} of stable isotopes between meteorites and planetary materials {{has been used}} to assess processes that occurred during formation of Earth and its core. However, thus far {{little is known about the}} mass dependent isotope fractionation of Mo in the solar system, and at high temperatures in the Earth, in particular during mantle processes. Molybdenum is a refractory and moderately siderophile element. The processes that might have fractionated Mo in the early solar system include condensation and evaporation of dust grains, metal-silicate segregation, core crystallization, silicate and sulphide melting and aqueous alteration. In order to investigate the processes fractionating Mo isotopes, it is first necessary to assess how much fractionation takes place during mantle melting, estimate the isotopic composition of the bulk silicate Earth, and then make comparisons with primitive and differentiated meteorites. I present double spike Mo isotope data for forty-two mafic and seven ultramafic samples from diverse locations, and nineteen extra-terrestrial samples. The delta 98 / 95 Mo values of all the terrestrial samples (normalized to NIST SRM 3134) exhibit a significant range from + 0. 53 ± 0. 21 to - 0. 56 ± 0. 09 ‰. The compositions of mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORBs) (+ 0. 03 ± 0. 07 ‰, 2 s. d.) and ultramafic rocks (+ 0. 38 ± 0. 15 ‰, 2 s. d.) are relatively uniform and well resolved, providing evidence of fractionation associated with partial melting. In contrast intraplate and ocean island basalts (OIBs) display significant variability within a single locality from MORB-like to strongly negative (- 0. 56 ‰). The most extreme values measured are for nephelinites from the Cameroon Line and Trinidade, which also have anomalously high Ce/Pb and low Mo/Ce relative to normal oceanic basalts. The observed relationships between delta 98 / 95 Mo and Ce/Pb, U/Pb and Mo/Ce provide evidence that sulphide plays a critical role in retaining Mo in the mantle and fractionating its isotopic composition in basaltic magmas. If residual sulphides are responsible the Mo isotopic composition, Mo budget of the bulk silicate Earth will be misrepresented by values estimated from basalts. On this basis a revised best estimate of the Mo content in the bulk silicate Earth (BSE) ranging between 251 to 268 ppb is derived, approximately 6 times higher than previously assumed, and similar to the levels of depletion in refractory siderophile elements such as W, Ni and Co. This significantly ameliorates the argument for Mo removal via late stage sulphide extraction to the core. The Mo isotopic composition of the BSE (0. 35 ‰) is distinct from the delta 98 / 95 Mo values found in primitive and iron meteorites. Although Mo isotopic fractionation varies between different phases within a single iron meteorite, and occurs during fractional crystallization in asteroidal cores, most iron meteorites have ddelta 98 / 95 MoSRM 3134 (- 0. 14 to - 0. 06 ‰) that are similar to ordinary and CI carbonaceous chondrite (- 0. 12 to - 0. 09 ‰). This range of delta 98 / 95 Moo is not only significantly lighter than the BSE, but also enstatite chondrites, which have delta 98 / 95 Mo values of 0. 04 to 0. 13 ‰. Several possible explanations are proposed. (A) Core-mantle differentiation fractionates Mo isotopes. The recently proposed Mo effect of sulphide liquid removal is likely to be minor because this should have generated a light Mo isotope composition for the BSE. However, isotopic fractionation associated with metal-silicate partitioning may be responsible for the heavy Mo in the BSE. (B) A distinct isotopic composition for the late material that contributed Mo to the BSE. Enstatite chondrites (or other putative groups of chondrites with a heavy Mo isotope composition) and sulphur-rich components form the cores of impacting bodies are the most likely candidates that could deliver heavy Mo to Earth. (C) The Mo isotopic composition of the Solar System is heterogeneous in a mass dependent fashion such that heavier Mo isotopes are <b>enriched</b> in the <b>section</b> of the disk from which Earth accreted. There are some difficulties behind each of these models and further work is needed to determine which is correct. This thesis is not currently available in ORA...|$|R
40|$|ODP Expedition 345 {{aimed to}} drill lower crust gabbros at Hess deep rift (East Pacific Rise, 2 ° 14 ’N- 101 ° 30 ’W), {{which is located}} near the {{junction}} between EPR and the Cocos, Nazca and Ridge. Lower crust oceanic gabbros were sampled on a about 200 m wide bench located on the intrarift southern slope between 4675 and 4850 m below sea level, and total of 11 holes (1415 A to P) were drilled, among which two reached a depth over 110 m below seafloor (Holes 1415 J and 1415 P; see IODP Expedition 345 Scientific Report, 2013). Primitive troctolites and olivine-rich gabbros were the main lithologies recovered from these two holes. Shipboard data showed a whole rock chemistry with a high Mg# in concordance with their primitive nature. In a MOR system, olivine is a typical primitive mineral and orthoyroxene (Opx) usually appear late in the crystallization sequence, when the magma already reached a significant degree of differentiation. In spite Opx is not expected in any primitive lithology, this mineral is commonly present in Hole 1415 P gabbros and associated with olivine. This curious association of cumulate Opx with olivine and other primitive minerals was also observed at a lower extent in some gabbros from IODP Hole 1256 D, in the upper Hess Deep crustal section (ODP Hole 894 G) We studied about 70 samples from Holes J and P, and 15 samples from the upper crust (ODP Hole 894 G and rubbles from IODP site 1415) for their petrography and mineral chemistry. All samples are olivine gabbros and show an overall cumulate texture with ophitic to subophitic domain consisting of large clinopyroxenes enclosing plagioclase and olivine chadacrysts. Olivine is subhedral to sub-rounded and plagioclase appear as subhedral laths. Beside the main constituent phases in Olivine gabbros, a relatively high content of orthopyroxenes may be observed (≥ 5 %). Three types of Opx textures may be distinguished in Opx-bearing olivine gabbros (1) recrystallized corona around olivine, (2) exsolution within clinopyroxene and (3) large prismatic or poikilitic grains. The third type {{is the most common}} and overall texture points to a crystallization order starting with olivine and plagioclase, and finishing with clinopyroxene and then orthopyroxene. In the upper crust, samples are less rich in olivine and mineral chemistry points to relatively differentiated characteristics compatible with a formation by fractional crystallization from a magma a MORB melt having undergone a certain degree of differentiation. In the lower crust, mineral chemistry show systematically primitive characteristics with high olivine forsterite content, clinopyroxene and orthopyroxene Mg# for all samples. Hole J gabbros show a clear evolution from the bottom to the top, with decreasing Mg# and increasing minor and trace elements contents in mafic minerals. Processes dominated by fractional crystallization can explain the genesis of the Hole 1415 J gabbroic column. On the other hand, the narrow down hole variation ranges for Mg# in Opx (84 - 86 %), Cpx (86 - 92 %) and olivine (85 - 90 %) in Hole 1415 P, together with a a large scatter in minor and trace elements (Ti, Al, Cr, Ni, Mn, Yb, Cs, Zr, etc.), in Cpx and Opx suggests that, at a global scale, the gabbro column were only affected by a moderate degree of differentiation and melt/rock reaction leading to Mg/Fe ratio buffering {{played a major role in}} the formation process. However the relatively low Mg# (below 88 %) values show that the reactant was rich in relatively differentiated mafic minerals with a general Mg# lower than in mantle rocks. Chemical zoning observed in the ophitic clinopyroxenes show that the crystallization process might be locally dominated by small-scale differentiation. Calculated compositions for liquids in equilibrium with Cpx and plagioclase, using both minor and trace elements are consistently between the EPR MORB and the Galapagos basalts chemical domains. In contrast, the melt in equilibrium with Opx in Hole P plot out of the MORB and OIB domain and is significantly richer in Ti. Mg# calculations on all the ferro-magnesian minerals show that Opx and olivine are in equilibrium while Cpx has a higher Mg# than the calculated Cpx in equilibrium with Opx These demonstrate that a two phases magmatic process occurred, in association with the melting of a enriched mantle source (similar to that producing enriched basalts at the Galapagos hotspot) to generate EPR lower gabbros: 1) Crystallization of a Mg/Fe ration buffered mush. The melt in this mush originated from an enriched mantle source, melts injected in the mush got buffered by a probable melt-rock reaction process occurring in the underlying troctolites. A certain degree of differentiation may occur in the mantle and troctolites, leading to stronger enrichment but the buffering event erased any chemical evidence of differentiation. The appearances of Opx at an early stage in the crystallization sequence suggest a Si-rich source compatible with pyroxenite melting. 2) Local differentiation leading to the crystallization of zoned Cpx in concurrence with Opx precipitation. MORB melts crystallizing in Hole 1415 J are expelled out from the lower crust to the melt lens located at the top of the gabbro <b>section.</b> <b>Enriched</b> melts crystallizing in Hole 1415 P are not observed in the basalts formed at the top of the section, this show that some melts produced in the mantle were not extracted from the basaltic mush to the melt lens.

Our study showed the limitation of the basaltic glasses method, sued up to now in order to calculate a general MORB or enriched mantle source...|$|R
