5|$|Archaeological {{evidence}} from eastern Africa {{extending from the}} Rift Valley from Ethiopia to northern Tanzania represents the largest archaeological evidence of the shift from the Late Acheulian to the Middle Stone Age tool technologies. This transition is characterized by stratigraphic layering of Acheulian stone tools, a bifacial handaxe technology, underneath and even contemporaneous with MSA technologies, such as Levallois tools, <b>flakes,</b> flaked tools, pointed <b>flakes,</b> smaller bifaces that are projectile in form, and, on rare occasions, hafted tools. Evidence of the gradual displacement of Acheulian by MSA technologies is further supported by this layering and contemporaneous placement, {{as well as by}} the earliest appearance of MSA technologies at Gademotta and the latest Acheulian technologies at the Bouri Formation of Ethiopia, dated to 154 to 160 kya. This suggests a possible overlap of 100-150 thousand years.|$|E

40|$|We {{evaluated}} tempering moisture concentration, {{addition of}} a surfactant to improve moisture uptake, steam conditioning time, and <b>flake</b> density to determine their impact on characteristics of steam-flaked corn. Increasing steam conditioning time from 20 to 40 minutes or adding a surfactant during tempering did not increase final <b>flake</b> moisture concentration, but moisture content of <b>flaked</b> corn was linearly increased by increasing tempering moisture concentration. Addition of Grain Prep® surfactant during tempering decreased (P< 0. 05) the amount of moisture lost during <b>flaking.</b> <b>Flake</b> durability was increased by increasing tempering moisture concentration, but only if corn was steamed for 40 minutes (tempering moisture × steam time interaction; P< 0. 10). Decreasing <b>flake</b> density linearly increased both starch availability (P< 0. 01) and <b>flake</b> durability (P< 0. 05). In this experiment, tempering moisture concentration had the largest impact on <b>flake</b> moisture content, and <b>flake</b> density was the most influential variable altering <b>flake</b> durability and starch availability...|$|R

40|$|<b>Flake</b> tool {{is one of}} {{the stone}} tools used by Paleolithic society which used stone as their technology. It is {{produced}} by <b>flaking</b> the core to get the <b>flake.</b> The <b>flake</b> that been used is known as <b>flake</b> tools. <b>Flake</b> tools found in Southeast Asia is said to be amorphous, which does not have a specific shape that can describe its function. So, this made it difficult for the typology classification of <b>flake</b> tool. However, many Paleolithic open sites have been classified based on <b>flake</b> tool morphology and technology, but {{the extent to which it}} represents the function has an issue. Therefore, usewear analysis was made using a <b>flake</b> tool from Bukit Bunuh’s site, which is Bukit Bunuh 2010. Bukit Bunuh was a meteorite impact area then it has been the source rocks suitable to be used as a tool by the Paleolithic society. In advance, the study was conducted by classifying <b>flake</b> tool typology according to morphological and technological. The results of this classification showed that there are four typologies identified as serrated, notched, pointed and retouched. Serrated can be divided into concave, convex and straight. While the notched been divided according to the number of notches. Retouched typology can be divided based on their edge trimming that is, alternate, alternating, direct, bifacial and inverse. Only pointed typology does not have subdivision. After the classification, the observation of the usewear of the <b>flake</b> tools had been done. As a result of these observations, there are several functions of the <b>flake</b> tools such as sawing, slicing, whittling, drilling, scratch and multiple functions. Almost all the <b>flake</b> tools were used for whittle except pointed and retouched type bifacial. Meanwhile, the serrated <b>flake</b> tools with type edge of convex, straight and retouched <b>flake</b> tools with type edge of direct has been widely used for a variety of activities compared with the other types of <b>flake</b> tools. So, this analysis indicated that most of <b>flake</b> tool used for various activities and also for specific functions. This shows that Paleolithic societies produced economic and multifunctional <b>flake</b> tools...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{the rolling}} bearing, the <b>flaking</b> caused by rolling contact fatigue is {{classified}} into two types: surface originated <b>flaking</b> and subsurface originated <b>flaking.</b> It {{has been recognized}} that marked microstructural change can occur in subsurface originated <b>flaking</b> due to rolling contact fatigue. But there are few reports in surface originated <b>flaking</b> about microstructural change. In this study, surface originated <b>flaking</b> caused by rolling contact fatigue was investigated based on microstructural change. Thrust ball bearing and radial ball bearing was used for fatigue test. Simulation of dent originated <b>flaking</b> was carried out using the bearing with artificial dent. Another fatigue test subjected to surface originated <b>flaking</b> was done under shortage of oil film thickness lubrication condition. Microstructural change was measured by X-ray Diffractmetry (XRD) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) during fatigue testing. Microstructure of bearing steel used for fatigue test is consisted of martensite with small amount of retained austenite. XRD measurement reveals that the half peak width of martensite and volume fraction of retained austenite decreasing with increasing testing time, {{and the amount of}} decrease in these parameter were small in the surface originated <b>flaking</b> compared with subsurface originated <b>flaking</b> when the specimens were <b>flaking.</b> This suggests that surface originated <b>flaking</b> occurs in spite of mild microstructural change. TEM observation about the surface originated <b>flaking</b> shows plastic flow in the surface layer. Especially, it was confirmed that partial recrystallization occurs in the fatigue test under shortage of oil film thickness lubrication condition. But it was also confirmed that degree of recrystallization is lower in the surface originated <b>flaking</b> than subsurface one, and this reasonably explains XRD result. From these results, it was cleared that recrystallizaiton of martensite is differ in degree but not in kind between surface originated <b>flaking</b> and subsurface originated <b>flaking...</b>|$|R

50|$|<b>Flake</b> tools {{can teach}} us much about human history. Residue {{analysis}} {{can be done}} to learn what was processed by the <b>flake</b> tools. Use-wear analysis can give archaeologists an idea of what the <b>flake</b> tool was used for. Archaeologists also use a process called re-fitting. This is the technological process of putting rock shards back together in their original shape {{in order to get a}} good idea of how the tool was created. All of these processes can help us to understand our human ancestors and how, why and when they created <b>flake</b> tools. These <b>flake</b> tools also have characteristics that show that these tools were made as a result of human work instead of natural processes. Each <b>flake</b> has 5 different parts: the first of which is a bulb of percussion which can also be known as the bulb of force. The next being an eraillure which is a <b>flake</b> that has been taken off of the lithic bulb of percussion. The third part of the <b>flake</b> is the radial fissures. The next part of the <b>flake</b> is the ripple marks followed by the negative <b>flake</b> scars which are located on the dorsal side from earlier <b>flake</b> markings.|$|R
