40|$|This work {{is based}} on a {{comparative}} study of different school <b>food</b> <b>programmes</b> {{in various parts of the}} world. One of the authors’ aims is to provide a basis to conduct what they call a “school food revolution” to make “good food on a child’s plate [be] the norm, not the exception” (p. xxi). The question the authors raise is to what extent can school food reforms involve the three dimensions – economic, social and environmental – of sustainable development? The book is divided into eight chapters. The first two chapters introduce what sustainable development means and involves in public policies. The following five chapters deal with several school <b>food</b> <b>programmes</b> implemented in various places (London, New York, Rome, Ghana, etc.). The authors explore each place in great detail, closely examining the history of school <b>food</b> <b>programmes,</b> showing how it has evolved over time and demonstrating the scope and limitations of each programme. The final chapter acts as a conclusion, with a more theoretical approach to the current food challenges of obesity and hunger...|$|E
40|$|How is it {{possible}} for a food programme to give me a sensory experience of taste, when the two most important senses – the actual smell and taste – are not in play? This is a sensory paradox that this article will examine. The argumentation is apparent in descriptions about the sensory phenomenon synaesthesia, which basically suggests that we can think about the senses as co-dependent. I will argue that <b>food</b> <b>programmes</b> use sensory strategies – that is synaesthetic strategies – in order to mediate a specific and sensory experience of taste. In light of this, I will analyse two Danish produced <b>food</b> <b>programmes,</b> “Spise med Price” (2008 - 2009) and “Du er hvad du spiser” (2005 - 2007), in order to establish a profound understanding of the food programmes’ sensory dramaturgical tools...|$|E
