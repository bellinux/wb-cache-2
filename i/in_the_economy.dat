40|$|Abstract: Does {{fiscal policy}} have qualitatively {{different}} effects on <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>in</b> a liquidity trap? We analyze a nonlinear stochastic New Keynesian model {{and compare the}} true and loglinearized equilibria. Using the loglinearized equilibrium conditions, {{the answer to the}} above question is yes. However, for the true nonlinear model, the answer is no. For a broad range of empirically relevant parameterizations, labor falls in response to a tax cut <b>in</b> <b>the</b> loglinearized <b>economy</b> but rises <b>in</b> <b>the</b> true <b>economy.</b> While <b>the</b> government purchase multiplier is above two <b>in</b> <b>the</b> loglinearized <b>economy</b> it is about one <b>in</b> <b>the</b> true <b>economy...</b>|$|R
5|$|New Zealand {{is heavily}} {{dependent}} on international trade, particularly in agricultural products. Exports account for 24% of its output, making New Zealand vulnerable to international commodity prices and global economic slowdowns. Food products made up 55% {{of the value of}} all the country's exports in 2014; wood was the second largest earner (7%). Its major export partners are Australia, United States, Japan, China, and the United Kingdom. On 7 April 2008, New Zealand and China signed the New Zealand–China Free Trade Agreement, the first such agreement China has signed with a developed country. The service sector is the largest sector <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy,</b> followed by manufacturing and construction and then farming and raw material extraction. Tourism plays a significant role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy,</b> contributing $12.9 billion (or 5.6%) to New Zealand's total GDP and supporting 7.5% of the total workforce in 2016. International visitor arrivals are expected to increase at a rate of 5.4% annually up to 2022.|$|E
5|$|Nurkse {{stressed}} productivity as {{the primary}} determinant {{of the size of}} the market.

It was found that on average, a shadow economy worker earned AUS$ 2135. 31 during the year 2000, and households spent AUS$ 2, 293. 00 for these services.

5|$|Beginning in 1558, {{with the}} {{invention}} of the patio process to extract silver from ore using mercury, mercury became an essential resource <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> of Spain and its American colonies. Mercury was used to extract silver from the lucrative mines in New Spain and Peru. Initially, the Spanish Crown's mines in Almadén in Southern Spain supplied all the mercury for the colonies. Mercury deposits were discovered in the New World, and more than 100,000 tons of mercury were mined from the region of Huancavelica, Peru, over the course of three centuries following the discovery of deposits there in 1563. The patio process and later pan amalgamation process continued to create great demand for mercury to treat silver ores until the late 19th century.|$|E

As oil revenues fueled the rise of federal subsidies to states, the federal government became the centre of political struggle and the threshold of power in the country.

40|$|Capital {{mobility}} {{leads to}} a speed of convergence smaller in an open economy than in a closed economy.
