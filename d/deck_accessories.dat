40|$|The deck {{building}} industry {{is going through}} a period of rapid growth and dramatic change with respect to the types of materials available to build decks. A 2001 study by the Freedonia Group estimates that the demand for decking materials will increase by almost 20 % between 2000 and 2010. To better understand material use and contractor preferences within the deck {{building industry}}, CINTRAFOR, with funding support from the USDA Forest Service Wood Utilization Lab in Sitka, AK) recently completed a survey of 205 deck builders and 213 home builders across the US. In particular, this research project was interested in documenting the current usage of Alaska Yellow Cedar (AYC) in residential decking, evaluating builders perceptions of AYC lumber as a decking material, assessing the potential for expanding the use of AYC in deck building and developing a set of strategic marketing recommendations to promote the expanded use of AYC in deck building. Refinement of the marketing recommendations should be considered once an accurate supply projection for AYC logs is available. Survey Results The deck building industry is dominated by small to medium-sized firms with over 63 % of survey respondents indicating that their sales revenue was less than $ 1 million in 2003. In contrast, over 11 % of deck builders generated sales revenue in excess of $ 5 million. The average deck builder constructed 93 decks with an average deck size of 456 square feet. Since the average construction cost for a new deck was $ 6, 161, the average construction cost for a deck in the US was $ 13. 51 per square foot. Approximately 45 % of the construction cost was attributed to the deck surface while 33 % was for the substructure and 21 % was for accessories. Just over 40 % of deck builder projects were new (first time) decks built on existing homes while 25 % were new decks built on new homes and almost a third were replacement decks built on existing homes. However, the survey data clearly shows substantial differences in deck characteristics based on geographic location. For example, deck builders in the eastern US built {{more than twice as many}} decks per year as companies in the western US (126 decks vs. 52) although the average deck size was significantly higher in the west (530 square feet vs. 395 square feet). Despite this, the average construction cost was relatively similar between the regions ($ 15. 04 per square foot in the west vs. $ 15. 90) Material use in the substructure was dominated by treated lumber with a market share of over 90 %. Material use in deck surface applications was dominated by wood-plastic composite products followed by treated lumber and western red cedar. Finally, approximately 30 % of <b>deck</b> <b>accessories</b> were built using wood-plastic composites and treated lumber while an additional 18 % were built from western red cedar. Deck builders were also asked to indicate the relative importance of a variety of product attributes in their material specification decision. The most important attributes in the material specification process were long life, visual appearance, consistent material quality and product availability. In contrast, the lowest rated attribute was low price. In other words, deck builders base their material purchase decisions less on price, preferring to focus on material quality. This suggests that home owners are less price-sensitive in the purchase of a deck, preferring high quality, durability and ease of maintenance over low price. Strategic Marketing Recommendations Target Market The results of the market research suggest that the target market for Alaska yellow cedar should be deck builders located on the US west coast, comprised of California, Oregon and Washington. The survey results show that decks built in this market are larger, more expensive and more likely to use naturally durable woods. The focus on deck builders is based on the fact that the demand for decking lumber in the repair and remodel market is expected to total 4. 4 billion board feet in 2005 as compared to a demand of just 700 million board feet in the new construction market. In addition, our research results indicate that approximately 46 % of the decks built on new homes are subcontracted out to deck builders. It is important to note that the survey results suggest that homeowners play a very important role in specifying decking material. For example, home builders indicated that home owners were responsible for specifying the decking material 30 % of the time while deck contractors indicated that the homeowners specified the decking materials almost 50 % of the time. Product The product offering should reflect a premium product strategy. Based on the survey results we recommend that lumber manufacturers in Alaska supply a family of products that includes decking lumber, deck joists and accessory products. This recommendation is based on the survey results showing that the use of naturally decay resistant wood is substantially higher in deck surface and deck accessory applications as opposed to deck substructures. Distribution Developing an efficient distribution channel for AYC decking products will be critical to the market development strategy. Our market research clearly shows that many deck builders cited the lack of availability as a primary reason why they have not been willing to use AYC or why they have not increased their use of AYC. Consequently, it will be important to match the expected supply of products with the size of the target market. Uncertainty over the short-term supply would argue for a more conservative strategy that constrains the size of the target market during the initial phase of the marketing campaign, allowing it to increase only as an increased supply of AYC products become available. Further, given the distance of Alaska suppliers from the target market, we would recommend that Alaska lumber producers consider establishing a relationship with stocking wholesalers that would allow for substantial volumes of product to be inventoried within a target market to reduce the logistical constraints of providing a reliable supply of products within a short timeframe. Pricing The survey results suggest that deck builders using naturally durable wood species have a relatively low price sensitivity which supports our recommendation for implementing a premium pricing strategy. In contrast, deck builders placed the highest importance on lumber attributes such as durability, beauty, consistent material quality and reliability of supply. Emphasizing these lumber attributes will further support the premium pricing strategy. We recommend initially pricing AYC slightly lower than similar WRC and redwood products. Promotion The promotional message must support the effort of positioning AYC as a high quality decking material. This means that the promotional message should emphasize the beauty, natural decay resistance, durability and consistent material quality of AYC. This can be effectively done by a direct comparison of AYC, WRC and RW across the major product attributes. As part of this strategy it may be useful to distinguish AYC from WRC and RW in terms of color, contrasting its light color to the darker colors of WRC and RW. This strategy will appeal to deck builders and home owners who are looking for a decking material that has beauty, durability and natural decay resistance but which provides a unique light colored appearance. The promotional strategy must address the fact that many deck builders (and home owners) are unfamiliar with the properties and appearance of AYC. This can be accomplished through a variety of strategies, including working with stocking wholesalers to build sample decks in their show rooms and establishing a website to educate potential users on the properties, end-uses and benefits of using AYC. The survey data further indicated that deck builders utilized a broad range of information sources to learn about new decking materials. As a result, we recommend that AYC producers consider a low-cost strategy to provide information on AYC across a broad range of media including the internet (through use of a website on AYC), attendance at trade shows (for example, the annual Deck Expo conference), material spec sheets for distribution through stocking wholesalers, advertising in industry magazines and advertising in consumer lifestyle magazines that emphasize the outdoor living. Finally, it may be useful to consider the possibility of offering promotional incentives for stocking wholesalers who install sample AYC decking exhibits in their sales showroom area and who meet specified sales goal...|$|E

40|$|Alaska {{exports to}} Japan {{decreased}} dramatically during the 1990 ’s. This decline {{was caused by}} a variety of factors including the Japanese recession, a reduced Alaska timber supply, exchange rates, a market shift from green lumber to kiln dried lumber, and increased global competition. However, in 2005 Japan’s GDP, stock market, real estate, and consumer price index were up from the previous year indicating a strong economic recovery. Furthermore, the U. S. Dollar has weakened against the Japanese yen and many economists predict that the U. S. Dollar will continue to decline against the yen due to historically high U. S. fiscal and trade deficits. This will give Japanese companies more purchasing power for U. S. forest products. In addition to economic changes, Japan’s demographics are changing rapidly. In the first half of 2005, Japan’s net population decreased and the population will continue to decline to the 1960 ’s level of 100 million by 2050. While Japan’s general population is decreasing, the percentage of population over 65 is growing rapidly as the baby boomers reach retirement age. According to a survey published in the Nikkei Weekly Newspaper, one area baby boomers expect to spend money on when they retire is their house. The total size of Japan’s remodel market was 7. 0 trillion yen (US$ 60. 3 billion) in 2003. The remodel market increased in 2003 and is predicted to increase as more baby boomers retire. As explained above, the Japanese market has shifted from green lumber to kiln dried lumber. Alaska has more than doubled their kiln dry capacity since the late 1990 ’s and this opens up Japan’s kiln dried lumber market. Additionally, the Ketchikan Wood Technology Center has established Alaska-specific lumber grade marks to differentiate Alaska timber species’ unique characteristics. The Japanese market has always valued quality and there is now an opportunity to communicate Alaska lumber quality by promoting these new grade marks in Japan. The results of this research suggest that many niche markets exist for Alaska forest products: 1. Tract housing power builders Tract housing developments built by a new category of builder called “power builders” have increased in Japan’s urban areas. This is a growing market segment in Japan and these power builders are large enough to import Alaska forest products in large quantities. 2. Kiln dried lumber Alaska has substantially increased its kiln dried lumber capacity recently. Japan’s ten year warranty building requirement has increased demand for kiln dried lumber. There is ample demand for kiln dried lumber in both the 2 x 4 and post and beam housing markets. 3. Lamstock market There has been an increase in demand for engineered wood and the number of Japanese glulam manufacturers. The results of the Ketchikan Wood Technology Center Alaska species testing program have shown Alaska lumber has superior strength properties compared with many other species making it suitable for lamstock. 4. Pre-cut lumber market Almost 75 percent of Japanese post and beam starts used pre-cut lumber. Japan’s pre-cut lumber mills are a strong market to target with lumber sizes that could be used with their pre-cut lumber machines. The lumber sizes vary based on the application. 5. Alaska yellow-cedar for sill plate (dodai) Due to its natural decay resistant properties, Alaska yellow-cedar is very popular for sill plates and other structural lumber used in ground contact applications in Japan. 6. Alaska yellow-cedar for garden accessories and tubs Alaska yellow-cedar’s decay resistant properties make it an excellent species for outdoor garden <b>accessories</b> such as <b>decking</b> and <b>decking</b> <b>accessories,</b> benches, gazebos, and lattice. As explained earlier, {{there are a lot of}} retirees in Japan and this number will be increasing. Many retirees spend more time in their gardens and the demand for garden accessories is expected to increase. Also, Alaska yellow-cedar is considered a substitute for hinoki, (Japanese falsecypress). Japanese people traditionally take a bath daily. Soaking tubs are especially popular in Japan and most detached houses have one. An Alaska yellow-cedar tub could be developed and positioned as an upscale alternative to a hinoki tub. 7. Home improvement market for retirees Japan’s baby boomers are approaching retirement age. Many Japanese retiring workers receive a large lump sum payment, which they often use to improve their house. The senior home improvement market is expected to grow substantially as baby boomers start to retire. 8. Remodel market The remodeling market is expanding. There is an opportunity for lumber producers to collaborate with builders specializing in remodels, architects, and designers to develop higher quality products to sell to Japan. 9. Wood Chips It has been estimated that over 2. 3 million acres of timber have been affected in the Kenai Peninsula by the spruce bark beetle. One potential application for beetled killed spruce is wood chips. Japan has one of the largest pulp and paper markets in the world. 10. Gift Market Japan’s gift market has strong potential for smaller wood products and craft items. This market offers tremendous opportunity for smaller wood products that can be packaged and shipped easily. It would also make the gift more attractive if wood items are bundled with other “made in Alaska” items, such as smoked salmon. 11. Brand Strategy As described above, the Ketchikan Wood Technology Center has registered proprietary grade marks for Alaska species. These grade marks are “Alaska Hem”, “Alaska Yellow Cedar”, and “Alaska Spruce”. These three grade marks should be developed into a brand that communicates the quality of Alaska forest products to forest products manufacturers, pre-cutters, and homebuilders...|$|R
40|$|Overview The {{demand for}} decking and fencing {{materials}} {{is driven by}} several factors, including the macroeconomic environment, demographics, construction expenditures, and the repair and remodel sector. In addition, competition within the decking and fencing markets has recently been significantly altered by regulatory constraints on the forest products industry that have restricted harvest levels, by increasing imports of softwood lumber and by expanding competition from non-wood substitute materials. These last two factors {{are likely to have}} the greatest impact on the specification and use of decking and fencing materials in the mid to long term as the markets adjust to the changing regulatory environment and changing consumer perceptions and preferences. This report will explore the extant literature related to the demand for decking and fencing materials in the residential, non-residential, public and non-building segments of the construction industry. US Decking Market The demand for decking products is projected to increase from 4. 7 billion board feet (bbf) in 2000 to 5. 6 bbf in 2010, a 19. 3 % increase over the ten year period. This market expansion will not be distributed evenly across the three major types of deck materials, however. Whereas wood-plastic composite decking (WPC) is expected to increase by an astronomical 491 % and plastic decking by a healthy 152 %, the demand for wood decking is expected to decline by 8. 5 %. Further, the demand for redwood is projected to decline by over 15 % between 2000 - 2010, although the decline in the demand for redwood lumber is attributed to supply constraints rather than declining demand. These demand outlooks are driven by two fundamental end-user attributes: durability (long-deck life) and low maintenance. Very little consideration was paid to price and price sensitivity of either new home builders or home owners. As a result, these demand estimates are more heavily weighted towards the higher priced substitute materials than the actual market situation might otherwise justify, particularly in the 2005 - 2010 period. The primary construction application for decking is repair and remodel (approximately 86 %) followed by new home construction (approximately 14 %). While the demand for decking products in new construction is expected to experience strong growth between 2000 and 2010, the sheer size of the repair and remodel market make it a much more attractive market segment for producers. In addition, new home builders are a much more price sensitive set of buyers compared to home owners given the nature of the project expenditures. In addition, decks on new homes tend to be smaller than repair and replacement deck projects. Residential construction is the primary market for decking materials, followed by non-building projects (docks, marinas, park structures, etc.) and non-residential construction. The demand for decking materials in the residential market is expected to grow by 24. 3 % between 2000 and 2010 while demand is expected to grow by just 6. 9 % in the non-building market. Again, contractors in the non-building segment are much more price sensitive given the nature of the bidding process in these types of projects. Almost 80 % of decking material is installed by professionals as opposed to homeowners (DIY). While demand is expected to grow substantially in both segments, the highest growth is projected to occur within the DIY segment (27. 7 %) rather than the professional segment (15. 9 %). Given the profit constraints facing most professional installers, this segment of the market tends to be more price sensitive than the DIY segment. Finally, the deck market can be segmented into deck platforms versus rails and accessories (benches, stairs, planters, etc). It {{is important to note that}} only 59 % of the total demand for decking materials is derived from the construction of deck platforms. The remaining demand can be attributed to <b>deck</b> rails and <b>accessories,</b> suggesting that overall demand for a specific product may be influenced to a substantial degree by the availability of rails and accessory products manufactured from the same material. Growth in both of these market segments is expected to be strong. The projections indicate that the largest demand region for decking products is the US south while the US west is the smallest demand region. Interestingly, the largest growth in demand for decking materials is expected to come from these two regions...|$|R
40|$|Overview The {{demand for}} decking {{materials}} {{is driven by}} several factors, including the macroeconomic environment, demographics, construction expenditures, and the repair and remodel sector. In addition, competition within the decking market has recently been significantly altered by regulatory constraints on the forest products industry that have restricted harvest levels, by increasing imports of softwood lumber and by expanding competition from non-wood substitute materials. These last two factors {{are likely to have}} the greatest impact on the specification and use of decking materials in the mid to long term as the markets adjust to the changing regulatory environment and changing consumer perceptions and preferences. CINTRAFOR has been collecting market information on the material usage trend in the U. S. deck building industry since 1995. This report will present an analysis of the material usage trends and practices in the decking materials market. Further this report will provide a comprehensive product positioning and marketing analysis of the major decking materials in the US. An interactive web-based survey was used to collect the data and information presented in the report. Sufficient care was given to ensure that the respondents of the survey had significant deck building experience, hence, only those deck builders who had built more that 5 decks {{over the past two years}} were allowed to take the survey. A total of 372 qualified respondents completed the survey, representing 44 states and providing representation across all regions of the US. The number of residential decks built by the respondents in 2008 ranged from 1 to 250, with more than 60 % of the respondents building between 3 to 8 decks. A substantial number of respondents (12 % of the respondents) indicated that they built more than 20 decks in 2008. US Decking Market With the decline in US housing starts in 2007 and 2008 the focus of the deck building industry has shifted away from new decks for new houses. This study shows that the primary revenue generator for the US decking industry in 2008 was repair and remodel (approximately 44 %) closely followed by building new decks on existing houses (approximately 42 %). Under the present scenario, constructing new decks in new homes only marginally contributes (approximately 14 %) to the overall revenue of the US decking industry. This trend is more or less consistent across all the regions of the country with the repair and remodeling projects and deck construction in existing houses strongly dominating the industry’s revenue generation. This result confirms that when homeowners live in their houses longer they tend to invest in remodeling their houses; remodeling existing decks or installing new decks has traditionally been important aspects of renovating and remodeling houses. Moreover, such a trend also indicates that the deck building industry is at least partially insulated from the housing downturn. The survey results reveal that the size of the decks built in the US have not changed significantly since a previous survey conducted by CINTRAFOR in 2003, averaging 438 square feet. However, the average unit construction cost of decks built in the US has increased substantially from $ 13. 50 per square feet in 2003 to $ 18. 62 in 2008. Regional differences in the unit construction cost were also observed in the study. The average unit construction costs of decks built in the Northeastern and Western regions were approximately $ 20 per square feet, whereas, the average unit construction costs of decks built in the Southern region of the country were approximately $ 16 per square feet. Finally, the average cost of decks built in the Western region (approximately $ 9, 533) was significantly higher than the national average ($ 7, 319). Decking Material Usage Trends The market for residential decking materials in North America has become increasingly competitive over the past decade. Past studies have indicated that wood plastic composite decking (WPC) and plastic lumber (PVC) are increasingly replacing treated softwood lumber and naturally durable timber species (i. e., redwood, western red cedar and tropical hardwoods) in deck building applications. Our 2009 survey results indicate that this trend of gradual market displacement of naturally durable timber species and treated softwood lumber decking materials has continued. Over 66 % of the respondents surveyed indicated that they have increased their usage of WPC and 37 % of the respondents increased their usage of PVC between 2006 and 2008, with less than 10 % reporting that they had decreased their use of WPC and PVC. In contrast, a high percentage of respondents indicated that they have decreased their usage of pressure treated lumber (31 %), western red cedar (36 %) and redwood (35 %) while less than 20 % reported increasing their use of these materials. The deck market can be segmented into the three main end-use applications; deck substructure, deck surface, and rails/accessories (benches, stairs, planters, etc). It is important to note that only 59 % of the total demand for decking materials (based on value) is derived from the construction of the primary substructure and deck surface. The remaining demand can be attributed to <b>deck</b> rails and <b>accessories,</b> suggesting that overall demand for a specific decking material may be influenced to a substantial degree by the availability of rails and accessory products manufactured from the same material. Growth in both of these market segments is expected to be strong. While pressure treated lumber (PTL) remains the dominant material used in substructure applications, with a market share over 80 %, PTL only has a 30 % share of the national deck surface market. WPC is now the market leader in deck surface applications across all regions of the US, with the exception of the South where almost 40 % of deck surfaces were still built using PTL. In contrast, only about 10 % of the deck surfaces built in the western US used PTL and WPC has emerged as the market leader with a 34 % market share. The western US is also the region with the greatest use of naturally durable wood decking, perhaps reflecting the greater availability of these products. Plastic decking made its greatest inroad in the northeast where almost 18 % of deck builders reported using this product...|$|R
