5|$|A last {{option was}} to attack fighter <b>factories,</b> {{which was not}} {{attempted}} on 18 August. Only the Spitfire factory at Southampton and the Hawker factory in Surrey were within range of escorted bombers.

Still, {{the attacks on the}} southern <b>factories</b> would require large concentrations of bombers and fighters which would be powerful enough to destroy them without sustaining heavy losses.|$|E

The furnaces would be staffed by a couple of the factory's glassblowers, who would perform their craft for tourists. His meeting with Sala and his Murano experiences stimulated his interest in making glass art in a private studio.|$|E
