After teaching briefly in a Berlin girls' school, Cantor {{took up a}} position at the University of Halle, where he spent his entire career.

5|$|In 1597, King James wrote a <b>dissertation</b> <b>on</b> {{witchcraft}} titled Daemonologie {{in which}} he wrote the belief that demons could possess both {{the living and the}} dead. Within his classification of demons, he explained the concept through the notion that incubi and succubae could possess the corpse of the deceased and walk the earth. As a devil borrows a dead body, it would seem so visibly and naturally to any man who converses with them and that any substance within the body would remain intolerably cold to others which they abuse.|$|E

5|$|Innis did his {{postgraduate}} {{work at the}} University of Chicago and {{was awarded}} his PhD, with a <b>dissertation</b> <b>on</b> the history of Canadian Pacific Railway, in August 1920. His two years at Chicago had a profound influence on his later work. His interest in economics deepened {{and he decided to}} become a professional economist. The economics faculty at Chicago questioned abstract and universalist neoclassical theories, then in vogue, arguing that general rules for economic policy should be derived from specific case studies.|$|E
5|$|Keyes {{earned his}} Ph.D. in {{government}} affairs from Harvard University in 1979, having written a <b>dissertation</b> <b>on</b> Alexander Hamilton and constitutional theory, under Harvey C. Mansfield. Due to student deferments {{and a high}} draft number, Keyes was not drafted {{to serve in the}} Vietnam War. Keyes and his family were staunch supporters of the war, in which his father served two tours of duty. Keyes was criticized by opponents of the war in Vietnam, but he says he was supporting his father and his brothers, who were also fighting in the war.|$|E

5|$|A {{precocious}} student, Durkheim {{entered the}} École Normale Supérieure (ENS) in 1879, at his third attempt. The entering class that year {{was one of}} the most brilliant of the nineteenth century and many of his classmates, such as Jean Jaurès and Henri Bergson, would go on to become major figures in France's intellectual history. At the ENS, Durkheim studied under the direction of Numa Denis Fustel de Coulanges, a classicist with a social scientific outlook, and wrote his Latin <b>dissertation</b> <b>on</b> Montesquieu. At the same time, he read Auguste Comte and Herbert Spencer. Thus Durkheim became interested in a scientific approach to society very early on in his career. This meant the first of many conflicts with the French academic system, which had no social science curriculum at the time. Durkheim found humanistic studies uninteresting, turning his attention from psychology and philosophy to ethics and eventually, sociology. He obtained his agrégation in philosophy in 1882, though finishing next to last in his graduating class owing to serious illness the year before.|$|E
5|$|In 1835, Elizabeth Lummis {{published}} {{her first}} book, entitled Poems, Translated and Original, which included her tragedy, Teresa Contarini, {{based on the}} history of Venice, that was successfully performed in New York and other cities. Around this time she married William Henry Ellet (1806–1859), a chemist from New York City. He graduated from Columbia College in New York and earned a gold medal for a <b>dissertation</b> <b>on</b> the compounds of cyanogen. The couple moved to Columbia, South Carolina, when he was made professor of chemistry, mineralogy and geology at South Carolina College in 1836. He also discovered a new and inexpensive method of preparing guncotton, for which the state of South Carolina presented him a service of silver plate.|$|E
5|$|Stokvis {{was born}} to Rachel Wittering and Joseph Barend Stokvis, Jr., a Jewish {{physician}} and obstetrician in Amsterdam. He studied medicine in Amsterdam and at the University of Utrecht under Franciscus Donders and Jacobus Schroeder van der Kolk, obtaining a doctorate on a <b>dissertation</b> <b>on</b> hepatic glucose production in diabetes in 1856. His thesis appeared shortly {{after the publication of}} related work by the French physiologist Claude Bernard. Stokvis may also have been influenced by the chemist Gerardus Mulder in Amsterdam. Subsequently, he travelled to Paris and Vienna (and possibly Prague), before establishing himself in medical practice in Amsterdam. He continued his medical research under the physiologists Adriaan Heynsius, Wilhelm Kühne and Thomas Place. In 1867, the Brussels Academy awarded a gold medal to Stokvis for an essay on the development of albuminuria, a kidney disorder in which the protein albumin can be detected in the urine.|$|E

5|$|Van Hoëvell {{was born}} in Deventer {{to one of the}} last of the old noble {{families}} in the Netherlands. His parents were Gerrit Willem Wolter Carel, Baron van Höevell (born Deventer, 21 April 1778), and Emerentia Luthera Isabella, Baroness van der Capellen (born Haarlem, 31 August 1787); he grew up with six brothers and sisters. While van Hoëvell was still young, the family moved to Groningen where he attended Latin school. Van Hoëvell enrolled in the University of Groningen in 1829 and studied theology. In 1830, he saw military action in Belgium during the abortive attempt by the North-Netherlands to maintain the unity of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands. He returned from the war gravely ill, but recovered and then returned to the university. He graduated summa cum laude with a <b>dissertation</b> <b>on</b> Irenaeus in 1836, and in that same year married Abrahamina Johanna Trip, with whom he would have two daughters and four sons; one daughter and one son died young.|$|E
5|$|A {{native of}} Johnstown, Pennsylvania, Zahorchak {{received}} a bachelor's degree master in 1980 from Saint Francis University in Loretto, Pennsylvania, {{and a master}} of education degree from Indiana University of Pennsylvania in 1986. In 1994, Zahorchak received his doctorate in education from Pennsylvania State University, where he wrote his doctoral <b>dissertation</b> <b>on</b> state policy-making. Zahorchak began his educational career in 1980 at the Greater Johnstown School District in Cambria County, Pennsylvania, where he spent two years an elementary school teacher. In 1985, he became a middle school reading and language arts in the North Star School District in Somerset County, where he also coached varsity high school football. Zahorchak taught at North Star until 1989, when he started working at the Shanksville-Stonycreek School District, also in Somerset County. During his {{three years in the}} district, he worked as an elementary and secondary principal, as well as a federal programs director. In 1992, he returned to the North Star School District as a principal and strategic planning coordinator. Zahorchak also previously served as an elected member of the Greater Johnstown School Board, and was a Johnstown city councilman, the Johnston deputy major and president of the Johnstown Rotary in 2003.|$|E
5|$|In 1667 Nicholas Steno wrote a {{paper about}} a shark head he had dissected. He {{compared}} {{the teeth of}} the shark with the common fossil objects known as tongue stones. He concluded that the fossils must have been shark teeth. Steno then took an interest in the question of fossils, and to address some of the objections to their organic origin he began studying rock strata. The result of this work was published in 1669 as Forerunner to a <b>Dissertation</b> <b>on</b> a solid naturally enclosed in a solid. In this book, Steno drew a clear distinction between objects such as rock crystals that really were formed within rocks and those such as fossil shells and shark teeth that were formed outside of those rocks. Steno realized that certain kinds of rock had been formed by the successive deposition of horizontal layers of sediment and that fossils were the remains of living organisms that had become buried in that sediment. Steno who, like almost all 17th century natural philosophers, believed that the earth was only a few thousand years old, resorted to the Biblical flood as a possible explanation for fossils of marine organisms that were far from the sea.|$|E
