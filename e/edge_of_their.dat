5|$|Females {{grow faster}} than males overall, {{and must be}} larger to mature sexually. In most populations males reach sexual {{maturity}} at 2–4years old, and females at 6–10. Size and age at maturity increase with latitude; at the northern <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> range, males reach sexual maturity at 7–9years of age and females at 11–16.|$|E
5|$|The Celtic peoples {{established}} {{a number of}} settlement centers, {{beginning in the early}} 4th century BC, mostly in southern Poland, which was at the outer <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> expansion. Through their highly developed economy and crafts, they exerted lasting cultural influence disproportional to their small numbers in the region.|$|E
5|$|Adrastea is {{the largest}} {{contributor}} to material in Jupiter's rings. This appears to consist primarily of material that is ejected from the surfaces of Jupiter's four small inner satellites by meteorite impacts. It is easy for the impact ejecta to be lost from these satellites into space. This {{is due to the}} satellites' low density and their surfaces lying close to the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> Roche spheres.|$|E
50|$|Among {{females of}} the species, the most similar {{member of the}} genus is Parcoblatta uhleriana; females of both species have wings, but {{significantly}} reduced tegmina. Distinguishing characteristics are that female P. desertae are generally pale-colored, have elongate subtriangular tegmina, and the <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> supra-anal plates form a broad, weak triangular shape at the base <b>of</b> <b>their</b> cerci, while female P. uhleriana are rust-colored to very dark, have roundly subtriangular tegmina, and the <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> supra-anal plates converge in a weakly concave fashion.|$|R

50|$|Columnea consanguinea closely {{resemble}} Columnea florida. The latter also has red heart-shaped markings on their leaves {{but can be}} distinguished by the teeth-like (pectinate) <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> flower calyces.|$|R
5|$|Bats also {{possess a}} system of {{sphincter}} valves on the arterial side of the vascular network that runs along the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> wings. In the fully open state, these allow oxygenated blood to flow through the capillary network across the wing membrane, but when contracted, they shunt flow directly to the veins, bypassing the wing capillaries. This allows bats to control the amount of heat exchanged through the thin flight membrane, allowing them to release heat during flight. Many other mammals use the capillary network in oversized ears for the same purpose.|$|E
5|$|From the {{opposite}} end of Europe (the Iberian Peninsula) came the few people who formed during the 2500-1900 BCE period the Bell-Beaker culture. It was named after the shape of their typical, carefully finished and precisely ornamented pottery. Southwestern Poland was at the eastern <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> range. Because of their mobility, the Bell-Beaker people helped spread new inventions, including developing metallurgy, over large areas of Europe.|$|E
5|$|Scotland's {{populations of}} Alpine Woodsia and Oblong Woodsia {{are on the}} <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> natural ranges. The UK {{distribution}} of the former is confined to Angus, Perthshire, Argyll and north Wales, and of the latter to Angus, the Moffat Hills, north Wales and two locations in England. The plants were first identified as separate species by John Bolton in 1785 and came under severe threat from Victorian fern collectors in the mid 19th century. Cystopteris dickieana, first discovered in a sea cave in Kincardineshire, is a rare fern in a UK context whose distribution is confined to Scotland, although recent research suggests {{that it may be}} a variant of C. fragilis rather than a species in its own right.|$|E

5|$|Six {{vascular}} {{plants are}} {{unique in that}} they are at the extreme <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> range or are disjunct from the main range of their species. They are the Maidenhair spleenwort (Asplenium trichomanes L.), in Minnesota six small populations of 20 to 40 plants have been found in the Rove area; Ross's (or Short) sedge (Carex rossii), only three populations are known to exist in the Rove area; Large-leaved sandwort (Moehringia macrophylla or Arenaria macrophylla), evidence indicates {{that this is a very}} rare species with limited distribution and restrictive environmental needs; Sticky locoweed (Oxytropis borealis var. viscida), is restricted to a single cliff in Cook County; Encrusted saxifrage (Saxifraga paniculata ssp. neogaea), 11 populations are known to exist in the Rove formation; and Smooth Woodsia (Woodsia glabella), there are small, isolated populations in the Rove Formation.|$|E
5|$|The rufous-crowned sparrow breeds in sparsely vegetated scrubland. Males {{attract a}} mate by singing from regular {{positions}} at the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> territories throughout the breeding season. These birds are monogamous, taking only one mate at a time, and pairs often remain together for several years. If singing males come within contact of each other, they may initially raise their crowns and face the ground to display this feature; if that fails to make the other bird leave, they stiffen their body, droop their wings, raise their tails, and stick their head straight out. Males guard their territories year-round.|$|E
5|$|Wake lows form due to {{adiabatic}} warming {{in the wake}} of mature squall lines at the back <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> rain shields, where evaporative cooling is unable to offset warming due to atmospheric subsidence, or downward motion. They can be caused by gravity waves which duct through boundary layers which are deep and cold to the north of a weather front. As with mesoscale high-pressure areas behind a squall line, when new thunderstorm development stops along the squall line, the wake low will weaken as well. Clearing conditions will accompany the wake low, due to the descending warm air mass associated with the feature. Within the United States, these systems have been observed to form in the Mississippi river valley, Southeast, Florida, and Great Plains.|$|E

5|$|General Douglas MacArthur, the {{commander}} of Allied forces in the SWPA, decided on 6June to postpone the Selaru operation until after Allied forces landed in the Philippines. This was not communicated to No.80 Wing, however, and Caldwell continued to develop plans for its involvement in the Selaru operation until late August. The effective cancellation of the operation left No.80 Wing without a clear mission, and its pilots were left {{with nothing to do}} other than train. In September Air Commodore Alan Charlesworth, {{the commander}} of North-Western Area, reported to Bostock that the wing's morale could drop if it was not either given an active role or transferred to southern Australia. During the same period No.80 Wing's pilots observed that No.1 Wing's Spitfires were making occasional strafing attacks on Japanese positions in the NEI and sought approval to conduct similar operations. Caldwell did not agree to this, however, as be believed that the risks associated with flying Spitfires to the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> range to attack unimportant targets outweighed any benefits to morale.|$|E

25|$|The Flatheads lived {{between the}} Cascade Range and Rocky Mountains. The Salish (Flatheads) {{initially}} lived entirely {{east of the}} Continental Divide but established their headquarters near the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains. Occasionally, hunting parties went west of the Continental Divide but not west of the Bitterroot Range. The easternmost <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> ancestral hunting forays were the Gallatin Range, Crazy Mountain, and Little Belt Ranges.|$|E
25|$|Cape St. Vincent {{was already}} sacred ground in Neolithic times, as {{standing}} menhirs {{in the neighborhood}} attest. The ancient Greeks called it Ophiussa (Land of Serpents), inhabited by the Oestriminis and dedicated here a temple to Heracles. The Romans called it Promontorium Sacrum (or Holy Promontory). They considered it a magical place where the sunset was much larger than anywhere else. They believed the sun sank here hissing into the ocean, marking the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> world.|$|E

25|$|In contrast, later palaeontinids {{like the}} Upper Jurassic Eocicada and Early Cretaceous Ilerdocossus had {{triangular}} forewings with the flexion line {{closer to the}} base. They had smaller and narrower hindwings that did not overlap with the forewing. These indicate that they were highly versatile fliers, able to fly {{with a wide range}} of speeds and agility like modern wasps and sphinx moths. They also possessed changes to the leading <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> forewings, suggesting an overall gain in lift.|$|E

When he observed the second MiG, which he also passed headon, he reversed hard left to engage. The Mig turned to its right to evade the attack, an unusual maneuver, and Ritchie used a vertical separation move to gain position on its rear quarter. DeBellevue obtained a solid boresight (dogfighting radar lock) on it while at the MiG's 5 o'clock; although fired from the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> flight envelopes, both AIM-7s struck home.|$|E
25|$|Ashalaho (‘Many Lodges’, today called Mountain Crow), Awaxaawaxammilaxpáake (‘Mountain People’), or Ashkúale (‘The Center Camp’).
