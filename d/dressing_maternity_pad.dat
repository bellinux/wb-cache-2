The definitive version is available at [URL] To evaluate the effectiveness of standard regimes (ice packs and Epifoam) at relieving perineal trauma and compare these with a new cooling device (<b>maternity</b> gel <b>pad).</b> DESIGN: A randomised controlled trial involving three treatment groups. The women were free to choose the time of initial application (within four hours after delivery) in all treatment groups and the number of subsequent treatments up to 48 hours after suturing. SETTING: A midwifery unit in the north of England and then continued in the women's own homes. PARTICIPANTS: 120 women who had undergone an instrumental delivery and had a 48 hours post-delivery stay in a postnatal ward. MEASUREMENTS AND FINDINGS: The ordinal scale of none, mild, moderate and severe was used to determine the levels of perineal oedema and bruising at initial assessment (less than 4 hours), 24 hours and at 48 hours, by use of a newly developed visual evaluating tool. Self-assessed pain was recorded using a 10 -point visual analogue scale within four hours, at 24 hours, 48 hours, and finally at five days after suturing. Women's opinions as to the effectiveness of their treatment was rated by use of a 5 -point scale describing the categories; poor, fair, good, very good and excellent. A high proportion of women had some perineal oedema at initial assessment. A statistically significant difference in the proportion of women with oedema was found between treatment groups at 48 hours (p = 0. 01), which was in favour of the <b>maternity</b> gel <b>pad</b> group. This was particularly noticeable for women with initial levels of mild oedema (p = 0. 017). Localised treatment with the gel pad caused a significant decrease in reported pain at 48 hours in women who initially demonstrated moderate or severe pain (p = 0. 048). A significant increase in the proportion of women with some bruising was seen across all treatment groups from initial assessment, through 24 hours to 48 hours (p < 0. 0005). The bruising was significantly less in the gel-pad group in women who initially had no bruising (p = 0. 021). There was no statistically significant effect of treatment at other initial levels of severity for oedema, bruising or pain at 24 hours, 48 hours and five days (for pain). Women in the gel-pad group rated the effectiveness of their localised treatment to be significantly higher than women in the other two treatment groups (p < 0. 0005). KEY CONCLUSIONS: This trial demonstrated that a high proportion of women experience perineal oedema, bruising and pain following an instrumental delivery, which continues for at least five days for perineal pain, despite oral analgesia. <b>Maternity</b> gel <b>pads,</b> which were specially designed to cool the perineal region, were more effective in alleviating perineal trauma when compared with hospital standard regimens and were more highly rated by women...|$|R
40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. The transport of solids in "horizontal" above ground drainage pipes {{was the subject of}} an investigation aimed at establishing a method for the design of deposit free drainage systems. Tests were based on the measurement of solid velocity in a discharge pipe of variable gradient, the solid being a <b>maternity</b> <b>pad</b> either with or without three paper towels. A test rig capable of supporting discharge pipes of various materials, enabling the incorporation of bends and junctions, was employed and an instrumentation method for measuring solid velocity, depth of flow and rate of flow was developed. Results showed that solid velocity in straight discharge pipes can be characterized by three separate zones of flow, the second zone being the most fundamental, with solid velocity defined by an equation of the form V = (C 1 -C 2) *Sqrt(L/G), where C 1 and C 2 are empirical coefficients, L is the distance travelled from the w. c. discharge and G is the pipe gradient. The limits of the flow zones can be defined by values of Sqrt(L/G), the larger limit defining the maximum length of deposit free discharge pipe at any gradient. The effect of pipe fittings on the velocity of the solid can be represented by a sharp velocity reduction followed by a gradual velocity regain and may be ignored as long as the pipe fitting is positioned approximately 5 metres {{before the end of the}} second flow zone conditions, as defined by a value of Sqrt(L/G), thus allowing sufficient length for the velocity to regain its straight pipe characteristic value. A design method is presented, based on the experimental data collected, which in its present form can be applied to check for the possible deposition of Solids within the "horizontal" discharge pipe system, either due to traversing excessive lengths of horizontal pipework or as a result of bend or junction positioning.

(2013) utilized Guy and Banim’s (2000) views of self to explore how consumption of <b>maternity</b> <b>dress</b> might shape the self during a liminal life stage (i.e., pregnancy). Interviews with women expecting their first child revealed concerns that available <b>maternity</b> <b>dress</b> limited their ability to express their true selves. Some {{expressed concern that the}} maternity clothing that was available to them in the marketplace symbolized someone that {{they did not want to}} associate with (i.e., the woman I fear I could be). Several women noted they borrowed or purchased used clothing from a variety of sources for this time in their life. This decision resulted in dissatisfaction because the items were not reflective of their selves and if worn resulted in their projecting a self that they also did not want to be. In addition, the women shared that they used dress to confirm their selves as pregnant and as NOT overweight. While some of the participants did experience a disrupted sense of self during pregnancy, others shared that they were able to locate items of dress that symbolized a self-consistent with “the woman I am most of the time”.|$|R

5000|$|Dresses did {{not follow}} a wearer's body shape until the Middle Ages. When western European dresses began to have seams, {{affluent}} pregnant women opened the seams to allow for growth.

This clothing had laced vents in the back that allowed the wearer to adjust {{the size of the}} coat as she needed. The <b>maternity</b> <b>dressed</b> changed during the Georgian period and became practical. “The billowing fabric found in the Adrienne dress was again used in this era to accommodate changing bodies, but bibs were added at the bust line to permit breast feeding.” [...] Aprons were also worn, to close the opening left by jackets. 19th century maternity clothing was tailored to hide pregnancy.|$|R

The chain around the waist had hooks for length adjustments, the leftover chain was hung on a chain-link in a loop. The links of this chain-belt could be round, figure-8 shaped, with cross-shaped or flat intermediate links, doubled, tripled, or more with enamel inlays (see Blood enamel). The so-called Norican-Pannonian belt of Roman times was decorated with open-worked fittings. A pouch was often hung from the belt on the right side.|$|R
5000|$|During her {{graduate}} studies at Rutgers, Mimi Smith began making sculpture that utilized clothing as both content and form. Smith’s early works were prescient of feminist and clothing art and predicted the feminist artists fascination with clothing {{as an extension}} of the body. [...] Using the autobiographical as a point of departure, her work often parallels everyday moments. In 1965, she produced Recycle Coat, Model Dress and Bikini. These works were made of plastic, an important material for Smith. In 1966, she produced a room-size installation called The Wedding for her thesis show at Rutgers University. Designed as a plastic box that viewers were not permitted to enter, it contained a plastic wedding gown with a thirty-foot train. Within the next year she was to create her signature piece Steel Wool Peignoir. About the piece Smith said, “Growing up in the 1950’s, I associated peignoirs with storybook romance… steel wool, however, was the stuff of everyday life… I felt that materials combined the reality of my life with the romance of what I thought it would be”. That same year she made <b>Maternity</b> <b>Dress</b> and Girdle. These pieces were also prescient in their acknowledgment that fashion is part of what helps to construct women’s individual and social identities. In 1968 Smith made a conceptual piece about her own pregnancy that played on the idea of knitting baby clothes. Knit Baby was conceived as a knit-your-own-baby kit, with instructions to enable any woman, or man, to knit themselves a baby.|$|R

Bette takes on the thoughts of Clara and expresses her concerns about dying from blood loss in childbirth, as her mother had. She was supposed to be an angel to the family, but she did not bring her family peace. Clara's Mother comes into the picture and explains the difference of living between the blacks and whites in their town. Whites had sidewalks with paved roads, nice bathrooms and water fountains. Blacks had dirt roads, they weren't allowed to sit in restaurants and they had to sit on a separate train. Bette dreams of talking to Jesus; she writes about God often. Clara's father left the family to be with a girl who talks to willow trees. She talks about her forced relationship with her ex-husband, Eddie. The pregnant Clara enters and talks to Eddie about jealousy. She wants to do something with her life like he does.

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} costume {{as a source}} of information. By making a case study of an 1880 's dress it aims to explore the conservators {{potential}} as an investigator and conveyor of the information contained in a costume. Further explanation of this role is made by reference to several statements made by well known textile conservators. The paper also explores the different words used to make a new version of a preserved or inexistant garment, gives an extensive presentation of taking patterns and an insight to the other methods used for analysing costumes. The case study consists of an investigation of the dress construction, during which a pattern is taken, and a literature study of the contemporary fashion, the owner of the dress and the maker of the dress. The pattern from the analysed dress will also serve as source for the Hallwyl Museum in the making of a pattern to sell in the museum shop. Further investigation includes analysing of fibres from the 24 different fabrics and trimmings in the dress, using an optical microscope, which shows that only wool, silk and cotton is present in the original material. The complete analysis of the dress, including pattern, construction description, close-up photos of the fabrics and photos of their fibres, is presented in inserts {{at the end of the}} paper. During the investigation of the dress a discovery is made that the dress has been enlarged with 7, 5 cm in each side and under the arms.

The interviews focused on women 2 ̆ 7 s experiences with appearance management, career development, and gender relations at work.

The data was analyzed through grounded theory and interpretive methods;A dynamic, multi-dimensional conceptual model of the meaning components women communicate in order to approach what they perceive as the 2 ̆ 2 ideal 2 ̆ 2 image was proposed. The six meaning components identified were Conservatism, Fashion, Masculinity, Femininity/Sexuality, Creativity, and Conformity. Each of the meanings must be consciously balanced by business women.

The state of balance of meaning components is mediated by several contextual factors [...] the particular field in which a woman is employed, the position she holds, and her personal values.

When Dr. Sarah Hackett Stevenson found out that medical women were to be allowed no part in that greatest of all fairs, she gathered her forces together and succeeded in getting a state appropriation for a Woman's Hospital exhibit. A building was erected in which the women doctors gave first aid and treated thousands of patients ... Forty years later, when arrangements for the Century of Progress were completed, the medical women were again excluded. In protestation, Dr. Lena Sadler and I appealed to the management for representation and space for some exhibit in the Hall of Science. We were told that, as there had been no arrangements for an exhibit on Maternal Hygiene, we might make an application for such an exhibit. However, there were a dozen applicants for the space, and if we wanted it, we would have to compete by presenting a perfect model of a maternal hygiene exhibit with all specifications. With the help of a hastily organized group of the medical, dental, and allied science women, we presented such a fascinating model that we were given the space... "The financing was more difficult — so difficult that Dr. Lena Sadler and I found ourselves almost alone on the project. My democratic program was to collect one dollar from every medical, dental, and allied science woman in the United States, but Dr. Sadler said, 'No, no. That's too long and hard a job. Go to Lane Bryant and ask them to allow you to exhibit their <b>maternity</b> <b>dresses.</b> I will go to Vanta, and then there's the Camp maternity corset. These firms ought to pay $500 for the privilege of exhibiting their products ... To my amazement, Dr. Sadler's plan brought us $6,000 in a few weeks so that the Medical, Dental, and Allied Science Women's Association for the Century of Progress was able to sponsor and furnish a booth on Maternal Hygiene in the Hall of Science, a booth on History of Women in Medicine in the Hall of Social Science, and a booth devoted to Child Welfare on the Enchanted Island." ...|$|R
