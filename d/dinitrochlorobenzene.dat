40|$|An {{investigation}} of immunological parameters {{was conducted in}} 38 patients with Crohn's disease. The immunological tests employed included skin tests with <b>dinitrochlorobenzene</b> and a battery of common skin test antigens, lymphocyte transformation with phytohaemagglutinin and pokeweed mitogen, serum immunoglobulins, and absolute lymphocyte counts. Crohn's disease patients {{were divided into two}} groups, those treated with immunosuppressive drugs and those not receiving immunosuppressive medications. The latter group was subdivided into patients with active and inactive disease. Immunosuppressed patients with Crohn's disease did not develop sensitivity to <b>dinitrochlorobenzene</b> and had mildly depressed skin test reactivity to common skin test procedures. Non-immunosuppressed patients with active Crohn's disease also reacted less frequently to common skin test antigens, but 16 of 17 such patients developed sensitivity to <b>dinitrochlorobenzene.</b> Lymphocyte transformation with phytohaemagglutinin and pokeweed mitogen was normal in all groups of patients with Crohn's disease. However, when suboptimal incubation periods were used with phytohaemagglutinin stimulation, {{there was a significant difference}} between Crohn's disease patients and controls.

40|$|Our goal is {{to develop}} an in vitro system for priming naïve, hapten-specific human T cells similar to the {{effector}} cells that mediate contact hypersensitivity in vivo. Using strategies based on results of experiments conducted with murine cells, we stimulated peripheral blood T cells from normal human beings in vitro with {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} that had been pretreated with granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor and then derivatized with <b>dinitrochlorobenzene.</b> T cells activated in this manner in vitro were compared functionally with immune T cells from individuals sensitized to <b>dinitrochlorobenzene.</b> We found that dinitrochlorobenzene-derivatized fresh peripheral blood mononuclear cells induced significant proliferation among immune T cells. Large amounts of interferon-γ, but no interleukin- 4, were detected in supernatant of these cultures. More interestingly, a significant number of T cells were activated when naïve, hapten-specific T cells were stimulated with dinitrochlorobenzene-modified, cultured autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Again, copious amounts of interferon-γ were detected in the culture supernatants. Furthermore, this subset of T cells proliferated and secreted interferon-γ, but not interleukin- 4, when restimulated in vitro with dinitrochlorobenzene-derivatized fresh peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In these regards, in vitro activated T cells functionally resembled T cells that were harvested from the blood of individuals previously sensitized with <b>dinitrochlorobenzene.</b> This in vitro system for activation of naïve, hapten-specific T cells offers opportunities on the one hand to study the earliest T cell and antigen-presenting cell events in the induction of human contact hypersensitivity, {{and on the other hand}} to simulate in vitro therapies with molecules designed to abort or prevent contact hypersensitivity when it causes disease...|$|E

40|$|Allergic contact {{dermatitis}} to strong, {{low molecular weight}} contact allergens can regularly be induced in the hamster. By its clinical course, histopathology and susceptibility to intensification with complete Freund's adjuvant, this hypersensitivity appears congruent with the allergic {{contact dermatitis}} observed in other experimental animals and the allergic contact dermatitis seen in humans. Further, in the hamster, we find that pretreatment with cyclophosphamide intensifies the acquisition of allergic contact dermatitis to <b>dinitrochlorobenzene</b> and to oxazolone; the target of cyclophosphamide immunopotentiation {{has been shown in}} the mouse and guinea pig to be a regulator suppressor cell. In addition, we have induced in the hamster specific immune tolerance to <b>dinitrochlorobenzene</b> with dinitrobenzene sulfonate; in the mouse and guinea pig it has been demonstrated that the induction of specific immune tolerance to contact allergens by parenteral hapten involves the elaboration of specific suppressor cells. These findings, then, imply the existence of regulatory suppressor cells for T-cell phenomena in the hamster. This contrasts with reports that suppressor cell function in hamsters, as against other rodents, is defective {{as it relates to the}} regulation of, for instance, allogeneic reactions, antibody formation and tolerance to contact allergens...|$|E

40|$|Ultraviolet-radiation {{suppresses}} {{cell-mediated immunity}} in healthy humans. It has been postulated that, {{in the short}} term, this immunosuppression prevents autoimmune responses to ultraviolet-radiation damaged skin. Patients with polymorphic light eruption (PLE) demonstrate abnormal responses to ultraviolet-radiation suggestive of an immune response to an ultraviolet-radiation-induced antigen. We investigated whether PLE patients (n= 22) were resistant to ultraviolet-radiation-induced immunosuppression compared to skin-type, aged-matched controls (n= 23). Groups of patients and controls (six subjects per group) received a single dose of solar-simulated ultraviolet-radiation of either 0, 0. 6, 1 or 2 minimal erythema doses (MED). Erythema was quantified using a reflectance meter and all volunteers were sensitised on the irradiated site with <b>dinitrochlorobenzene.</b> Contact hypersensitivity responses (CHS) to <b>dinitrochlorobenzene</b> were quantified after challenge using ultrasound. Ultraviolet-radiation-induced erythema was comparable in patients and controls. CHS was comparable in unirradiated patients and controls. UVR-induced a dose-dependent suppression of CHS in all volunteers but patients were more resistant to immunosuppression after 1 MED. Exposure to 1 MED suppressed CHS by 78 % in controls but induced less suppression in patients (44 %, p < 0. 01).

40|$|Inflammation of the {{guinea-pig}} colon {{was produced}} by skin sensitization and subsequent intracolonic challenge with the chemical hapten, <b>dinitrochlorobenzene.</b> Metabolism of [14 C]-arachidonic acid by homogenates of control colon was very low, although metabolites co-migrating on thin layer chromatography (t. l. c.) with prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2), PGF 2 alpha, PGD 2, 6 -keto-PGF 1 alpha, thromboxane B 2 (TXB 2), HHT and 11 -, 12 -, 15 -HETE were formed. There was an overall 3 fold increase in metabolism of [14 C]-arachidonic acid by homogenates of inflamed mucosa. The greatest increase in metabolite formation was of PGE 2, with smaller increases in HHT, 11 -, 12 -, 15 -HETE, PGD 2, TXB 2, PGF 2 alpha and 6 -keto-PGF 1 alpha. The formation of these metabolites was inhibited both by indomethacin and the dual pathway inhibitor, BW 755 C. The formation of immunoreactive PGE 2, TXB 2 and 6 -keto-PGF 1 alpha was also increased in homogenates of inflamed guinea-pig colon.

40|$|Abstract Background Offspring of {{asthmatic}} {{mothers have}} {{increased risk of}} developing asthma, based on human epidemiologic data and experimental animal models. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine whether maternal allergy at non-pulmonary sites can increase asthma risk in offspring. Methods BALB/c female mice received 2 topical applications of vehicle, <b>dinitrochlorobenzene,</b> or toluene diisocyanate before mating with untreated males. <b>Dinitrochlorobenzene</b> is a skin-sensitizer only and known to induce a Th 1 response, while toluene diisocyanate is both a skin and respiratory sensitizer that causes a Th 2 response. Both cause allergic contact dermatitis. Offspring underwent an intentionally suboptimal protocol of allergen sensitization and aerosol challenge, followed by evaluation of airway hyperresponsiveness, allergic airway inflammation, and cytokine production. Mothers were tested for allergic airway disease, evidence of dermatitis, cellularity of the draining lymph nodes, and systemic cytokine levels. The role of interleukin- 4 was also explored using interleukin- 4 deficient mice. Results Offspring of toluene diisocyanate but not dinitrochlorobenzene-treated mothers developed an asthmatic phenotype following allergen sensitization and challenge, seen as increased Penh values, airway inflammation, bronchoalveolar lavage total cell counts and eosinophilia, and Th 2 cytokine imbalance in the lung. Toluene diisocyanate treated interleukin- 4 deficient mothers were able to transfer asthma risk to offspring. Mothers in both experimental groups developed allergic contact dermatitis, but not allergic airway disease. Conclusion Maternal non-respiratory allergy (Th 2 -skewed dermatitis caused by toluene diisocyanate) can result in the maternal transmission of asthma risk in mice. </p...|$|E
