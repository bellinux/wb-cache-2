5|$|The bark beetle, <b>elm</b> leaf beetle and the Asian longhorned beetle (Anoplophora glabripennis) {{are among}} the species that attack <b>elm</b> trees. Bark beetles (Scolytidae) carry Dutch <b>elm</b> disease as they move from {{infected}} breeding sites to healthy trees. The disease has devastated <b>elm</b> trees across Europe and North America.|$|E
5|$|After a 1990 Dutch <b>elm</b> disease {{outbreak}} in Portland, including one diseased tree at Park and Market in the South Park Blocks, the <b>elm</b> trees have been immunized with Tiabendazole. Portland's first outbreak of Dutch <b>elm</b> disease occurred in 1976 at Overlook Park, and the peak infections were in 2003.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the bark}} {{functions}} as a protective barrier, it is itself attacked by boring insects such as beetles. These lay their eggs in crevices and the larvae chew {{their way through the}} cellulose tissues leaving a gallery of tunnels. This may allow fungal spores to gain admittance and attack the tree. Dutch <b>elm</b> disease is caused by a fungus (Ophiostoma species) carried from one <b>elm</b> tree to another by various beetles. The tree reacts to the growth of the fungus by blocking off the xylem tissue carrying sap upwards and the branch above, and eventually the whole tree, is deprived of nourishment and dies. In Britain in the 1990s, 25 million <b>elm</b> trees were killed by this disease.|$|E
