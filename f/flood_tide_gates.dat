40|$|Because of overusing water {{resources}} in the upper and middle reaches of the Haihe Basin, less and less water flows to the river mouth. The Haihe River flow is cut off in most time of the seasons, sediment deposited in the river mouth channel is rarely scoured away, {{and many of the}} river mouth channels have been shrinking quickly. The discharge capacity of the channel is consequently reduced greatly, which results in more and more serious <b>flood</b> hazard. Many <b>tide</b> <b>gates</b> have been built for storing fresh water and preventing the salty and turbid water. The channel downstream of the gate is silting up and people have to dredge the channel every year before the flood season. This paper studies the laws of the siltation and strategies controlling channel shrinkage. The strategies are digger dredging, trailer dredging, scouring with pumping water or storing tidal water, building double guiding dikes and building a new gate. Comparison of various strategies is performed, suggesting the most effective strategy controlling estuarine channel shrinkage. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
50|$|Construction of the {{wading pool}} began in 1932 {{at a spot}} {{where there was a}} small {{indentation}} known as the saltpan. The parkland was reclaimed from the sea, a revetment wall was built and backfilled, and an area left empty to create the tidal pool. The pool was created by the construction of a concrete sea wall beyond the high water mark, with little excavation required. This wall creates a barrier between the pool and Moreton Bay and also provides a promenade along the foreshore of the Bay. Three pipes are located {{along the length of the}} wall, through which water flows at high <b>tide.</b> <b>Flood</b> <b>gates</b> are then closed to prevent the water from receding at low tide.

Their impact on downstream adult migration of the critically endangered European eel, Anguilla anguilla, is unknown. The River Stiffkey, UK, has three top-hung <b>tide</b> <b>gates</b> (one counterbalanced, two not) through which it discharges into the North Sea. Adult eels of silver appearance (n?=? 118) were caught between 0. 5 and 6. 0 km upstream from the <b>tide</b> <b>gates</b> in Autumn 2011 and implanted with 23 mm half-duplex passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags.

Escapement past the gates was 98. 3 %. Speed of migration was slower near the gates than for an unimpeded upstream reach and was positively and negatively related to mean degree of gate opening and mean light intensity, respectively. When the largest gate was modified through installation of an orifice intended to improve upstream passage of sea trout and juvenile eels, downstream migration was more rapid when it was operating. However, video analysis revealed that eels did not pass through the orifice, meaning that faster migration {{may have been a}} result of the gates being open on more occasions when eels initially approached them, or the lower tides and upstream saline intrusion that occurred during these periods.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Tide</b> <b>gates</b> are {{frequently}} placed at confluences of streams with tidal waters. These gates prevent tidal waters from inundating low-lying lands while allowing stream flows to drain during lower tidal stages. Traditional <b>tide</b> <b>gates</b> effectively preclude an estuarine environment upstream {{of the gate}} and often block native fish from entering these tributary streams. In recent years, {{a new generation of}} <b>tide</b> <b>gates</b> has been installed with the intent of improving fish passage and allowing a limited amount of tidal inflow into the stream to create a longitudinal transition from the marine to freshwater environment. This new generation of <b>tide</b> <b>gate</b> uses side-hinged doors that open wider to permit efficient outflow and produce slower water velocities to accommodate fish passage. These gates also allow a limited amount of tidal water to flow upstream. Inflow of tidal water is regulated to mute the peak tidal stage and preventing upstream tidal <b>flooding.</b> The muted <b>tide</b> is regulated by either: 1. a small adjustable opening that functions as an orifice and sized to prevent excessive tidal inflow, or 2. a mechanical float system that holds the gate open until the upstream stage reaches a predetermined threshold. Design of these muted tidal systems involves extensive hydraulic analysis to evaluate fish passage, prevent upstream tidal flooding, and create the desired estuarine conditions, including vegetation zonation. This presentation will illustrate the types of analysis and considerations employed with this new generation of <b>tide</b> <b>gates.</b> Two recently constructed <b>tide</b> <b>gate</b> replacements designed for passage of all life stages of Pacific anadromous salmonids will be used as case examples to highlight the design proces...|$|R
40|$|<b>Tide</b> <b>gates,</b> used to {{regulate}} tidal flow {{as part of}} land reclamation programmes, temporally block fish movement by closing during the <b>flood</b> <b>tide.</b> Their impact on the upstream movement of brown trout, Salmo trutta, and other fish species has received little consideration. The River Stiffkey, UK, discharges into the North Sea via three top-hung <b>tide</b> <b>gates,</b> one counterbalanced (Gate 1), and two not (collectively referred to as Gate 2). Three-hundred adult trout were caught between 0. 5 and 6. 0 km upstream from the gates on 20 separate days between July and December 2011 (n = 15 per day) and implanted with 23 mm half-duplex Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) tags before being released 15 m downstream from Gate 1 where PIT antennas were located on either side. Overall, gate attraction (percentage of fish released that were detected {{by at least one}} antenna) and passage efficiencies (number of fish that passed Gate 1 reported as a proportion of those that approached) were 96. 7 % and 92. 4 %, respectively. The operation of an orifice, installed to improve connectivity for adult trout and juvenile eels, did not influence passage efficiency or delay. Of the fish that passed Gate 1 when the orifice was operational, 42. 6 – 55. 7 % approached the orifice entrance and 70. 6 – 92. 3 % of these passed through. Individuals that passed through the orifice were larger than those that did not. Movement past the <b>tide</b> <b>gates</b> (median duration = 6. 04 h) took 6 times longer than passage through two unimpeded reaches upstream. Duration of passage through the gates was predominately related to the mean angle of gate opening during the time prior to passage, followed by water temperature.

40|$|Dramatic {{declines in}} salmon {{populations in the}} Pacific Northwest have brought new {{attention}} {{to the importance of}} estuarine rearing habitats. Levees and <b>tide</b> <b>gates</b> used to convert estuarine wetlands into farmland have reduced available habitat by more than half of historical levels. Recent efforts to restore estuarine habitats include <b>tide</b> <b>gate</b> replacement, though this method has been poorly studied. As a key indicator of salmon habitat suitability, temperature was used to evaluate the effects of <b>tide</b> <b>gate</b> replacement in a tidally influenced freshwater slough in the Lower Columbia River estuary. Three <b>tide</b> <b>gates</b> in the largest slough on Tenasillahe Island were replaced in 2007 with side-hinged aluminum gates. As managed during the data collection periods, the new <b>tide</b> <b>gates</b> did not allow tidal inflow into the slough. The study employed a Before-After, Control-Impact (BACI) approach, collecting data seasonally two years before and after replacement at the impact site and at the control site, a relatively unaltered slough on nearby Welch Island. Randomized Intervention Analysis and Monte Carlo tests revealed no significant difference in slough water temperatures after <b>tide</b> <b>gate</b> replacement, although minimum temperatures dropped up and downstream of the <b>tide</b> <b>gates.</b> Although the new <b>tide</b> <b>gates</b> did not {{have a significant effect on}} water temperature, the lower minimum temperatures may have been caused by a slight increase in tidal circulation.

40|$|Anthropogenic {{structures}} fragment river connectivity, impeding {{the migration}} of diadromous fish between essential habitats. <b>Tide</b> <b>gates</b> are used worldwide primarily for flood protection and land reclamation by closing under hydraulic pressure during the <b>flood</b> <b>tide</b> and opening when head differential is sufficient during the ebb. Although <b>tide</b> <b>gates</b> are known to decrease fish species richness, abundance, and movement, their impacts on {{the migration of}} ecologically and socioeconomically important diadromous fish in terms of passage efficiency and delay have not been reported elsewhere. Acoustic and passive integrated transponder telemetry revealed that passage efficiencies of upstream migrating adult brown trout, Salmo trutta (92 %), and downstream migrating juvenile sea trout smolts (96 - 100 %) and adult European eel, Anguilla anguilla (98 %), were high at top-hung <b>tide</b> <b>gates</b> in two small English streams. However, these fish experienced delay at the gates (adult brown trout, median = 6. 0 h; sea trout smolts, mean = 6. 5 and 23. 7 h; eels, mean = 66. 2 h) when compared to migration through unimpeded reaches. The percentage of time the gates were closed and mean angle of opening were positively related to delay in both species and life stages. Diel periodicity also influenced delay for smolts and eels, which were more active at night. For adult trout, water temperature was positively associated with delay. Upstream and downstream water temperature and salinity were influenced by the temporal operation of the gates. Orifices installed in the gates did not mitigate delay for adult or juvenile trout. For adult eels, delay was decreased when an orifice was operational, although this coincided with more eels first approaching the gates when open, higher tides and greater saline intrusion upstream of the gates. When gates were open, fish would not pass immediately through, indicating the potential influence of a behavioural avoidance component. To {{examine the effect of}} hydrodynamics created by top-hung <b>tide</b> <b>gates</b> with different aperture sizes, wild sea trout smolt behaviour was observed by video cameras in an experimental flume at night. Avoidance responses occurred within an average of 1. 4 fish body lengths upstream of the gate. Fish were more likely to exhibit avoidance (switch in orientation from negative to positive rheotaxis, increased tail beat frequency and/or retreat upstream) in the vicinity of a model gate with a smaller angle of opening and passage aperture. Overall, top-hung <b>tide</b> <b>gates</b> delayed the migration of diadromous fish, potentially increasing energy expenditure and predation risk. Delay was not decreased by orifices. Modifying or replacing top-hung <b>tide</b> <b>gates</b> with designs that allow them to open wider and for longer could reduce migratory delay and improve the environmental conditions that cause behavioural avoidance. <br/...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2011 Tidal marshlands in {{the upper}} estuary ecotone provide {{essential}} habitat for juvenile salmonids. In this environment, salmonids grow rapidly and acclimate to saltwater. Worldwide, tidal marshes have been diked and drained to provide agricultural and residential land. <b>Tide</b> <b>gates</b> are one-way doors integrated into dike systems that prevent saltwater flooding and allow upland drainage to the estuary during low tide. By preventing tidal exchange, <b>tide</b> <b>gates</b> have significant upstream effects on water temperature and chemistry, plant and animal community structure, and geomorphology.

They may also affect juvenile salmon migration timing by altering environmental variables that influence emigration rate in upstream habitats. We conducted our research in Coos Bay, one of the many Oregon estuaries with extensive use of <b>tide</b> <b>gates.</b> We studied three streams, one with a top-hinged <b>tide</b> <b>gate,</b> one with a side-hinged gate, and one without any <b>tide</b> <b>gates</b> that acted as our reference site.

We installed stationary passive integrated transponder (PIT) antennae around a top-hinged gate, a side-hinged gate and in a non-gated reference system to track the movement of PIT tagged juvenile coho salmon. Our results indicate that coho salmon smolt passed upstream most frequently at the non-gated channel (48 % of all smolts detected), than the side-hinge gated site (28 %) or the top-hinge gated site (3 %). Subyearling coho salmon passed more frequently at a specific range of gate angles and tailwater depths at both top hinged and side-hinged <b>tide</b> <b>gates.</b> Smolts preferred greater gate angles and tailwater depths than average to pass downstream at both <b>tide</b> <b>gates.</b> Subyearlings passed upstream more frequently during small gate angles and a narrow range of tailwater depths at the top-hinged gate but did not display preference for a particular condition at the side-hinged gate.

40|$|Stream {{connectivity}} {{and habitat}} diversity are {{key components of}} healthy river ecosystems. Human modification of natural flow regimes disrupts natural connectivity, and results in physical, chemical, and biological changes that impair natural river function. Such changes can be detrimental to freshwater species, particularly those which have evolved to be reliant {{on a variety of}} different habitats throughout their life cycles. Consequently, restoring connectivity has become a major restoration goal in freshwater ecology. <b>Tide</b> <b>gates,</b> a man-made coastal structure designed to protect low-land infrastructure from flooding, can negatively impact freshwater ecosystems. Through disrupting connectivity, <b>tide</b> <b>gates</b> impede the movement of aquatic biota and degrade upstream habitats. It is thought {{that the vast majority of}} <b>tide</b> <b>gates</b> in New Zealand and worldwide could be modified to enhance connectivity and fauna passage through the installation of Fish Friendly Gates (FFG's). This study is the first to investigate these claims. FFG's increased both the duration and distance that <b>tide</b> <b>gates</b> were held open over a tide cycle. These operational changes reintroduced some tidal fluctuation to upstream habitats but water levels remained within safe levels for infrastructure. FFG influence enabled upstream passage for giant bully and adult inanga, for which <b>tide</b> <b>gates</b> were otherwise impassable. Furthermore, upstream passage of whitebait (migratory galaxiid juveniles) and common bully were significantly increased when aided by FFG's. Although rapid and sustained increases in migratory species richness of resident populations were observed following FFG installation, due to small sample sizes these changes could not be regarded as statistically significant. Additionally, evidence of rehabilitation of degraded sites was limited and suggests care should be taken when restoring connectivity to poor quality habitat. Overall, this study demonstrated that FFG's can enhance upstream fish passage at <b>tide</b> <b>gates</b> while maintaining adequate flood protection. Whether FFG's can provide ecological benefits to degraded habitats requires supplementary research.
