Dynamics is carried out stressing on the two critical points, commencing status and terminating situation, for the greatest grabbing and cutting force; and so is done on kinematics concentrating the three representative points, A, B, and C, with position, velocity, and acceleration, respectively, with which almost all of the points on the bucket may be obtained for the three kinematic parameters. Optimal desgin have been done with objective of the proper momentum and thrust force and constraint of weight, width, ratio of weight and capacity, quotiety of the rope, ascent and descent velocity of the bucket...|$|R

Over the past 10 years, the use of iron-based PRBs has evolved from innovative to accepted standard practice for the treatment of a variety of groundwater contaminants (ITRC in: Permeable reactive barriers: lessons learned/new directions. The Interstate Technology and Regulatory Council, Permeable Reactive Barriers Team 2005). Although, a variety of excavation methods have been developed, backhoe excavators are often used for the construction of PRBs. The aim of this study is to describe the emplacement of a full-scale PRB and the benefits deriving from the use of a crawler crane equipped with a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>grab</b> (also known as clamshell excavator) in the excavation phases.

40|$|Bryozoans {{are one of}} {{the major}} macrofaunal groups of the high polar regions. Here we present data on the nature of bryozoan assemblages in the Svalbard Archipelago sampled over 6 years between 1997 and 2002. Samples were {{collected}} with use of Van Veen <b>grab,</b> <b>dredge</b> and Scuba diving at depths ranging from 0 to 268 m. Among examined material (5026 items) bryozoans were present on one type of abiotic (stones) and 40 types of biotic substrata. The biotic substrata we investigated included algae (12 taxa) and invertebrates (28 taxa: Hydrozoa, Gastropoda, Bivalvia, Polychaeta, Crustacea, Ascidiacea, other Bryozoa). Both a priori ANOSIM (Global R = 0. 512, P = 0. 001) and cluster analyses reveal differences between the assemblages on different types of substrata. Cluster analyses distinguish two distinct groups of substrata. The first (stable) included stones, molluscs and Balanus balanus whilst the second (flexible) consisted of algae, hydrozoans and bryozoans. Bryozoan assemblages which colonized different substrata, varied in terms of species composition and their dominance. Bryozoan species were categorized as generalists, low-specificity epibiotic species or locally abundant background species. No species were found to be substratum-specific to any type. Among substrata with the richest bryozoan fauna were stones (156 taxa), Chlamys islandica (68) and Balanus balanus (62). There were clear patterns in the distribution of substrata colonized by bryozoans within the fjord system: those shallow near the mouth were rich whilst those in deeper water were depauperate.

At five mud volcanoes (Al Idrissi mv, Mercator mv, Gemini mv, Aveiro mv, and Captain Arutnyov mv) biodiversity was studied in relation to environmental factors. This study illustrated that the occurrence of mud volcanoes on the continental slope create new habitats and add to biodiversity. The study yielded the following results: The thickness of hemipelagic drape overlying mud breccias showed that all mud volcanoes have {{been active in the}} last 1600 years. Video imagery observations indicate an eastbound current over the Al Arraiche mud volcano field. At greater water depths this current becomes more variable. Faunal assemblages change with the sedimentary facies of the sea floor at each mud volcano Currents influence the distribution of trophic groups over the mud volcanoes. Populations of filter feeders are more dense on the upcurrent slope. On the downcurrent slope they are replaced by deposit feeders and scavengers. Faunal diversity and bioturbation increases at seep sites Abundances of megafauna decreases with increasing water depth. The disturbance of the fauna by mud eruptions is small as periods inactivity are much larger than the time needed for recolonization. Seepage of fluids has a longer-lasting influence, resulting in a decrease of sessile filter feeders and burrows towards the summit of most mud volcanoes.

Additionally, 16 samples {{were obtained from the}} cooling water intake screens of a thermal power plant in 2003. A total of 133 species and higher taxa were identified from approximately 140, 000 organisms. A total of 33 neozoa (alien) species were identified, including the first record of Chelicorophium robustum in the Rhine River. Neozoa contributed approximately 74 % to the total number of organisms collected from the ship-based samples and 85 % to those from the power plant cooling water. Almost 64 % of all individuals from the cooling water intake belonged to the Ponto-Caspian amphipod Dikerogammarus villosus. Similarly, only 13 taxa, four native and nine alien species, numerically dominated in the ship-based samples, representing 95 % and 98 % of all organisms in 2003 and 2004, respectively. The nine alien species contributed 74. 7 % and 72. 1 %, respectively, to the number of organisms. Only six species occurred abundantly in the main channel of the Rhine River, five of which were neozoa: Jaera istri, Dikerogammarus villosus, Dreissena polymorpha, Chelicorophium curvispinum, and Hypania invalida.

40|$|Continental South Africa has a {{coastline}} of some 3, 650 km and an Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of {{just over}} 1 million km 2. Waters in the EEZ extend {{to a depth of}} 5, 700 m, with more than 65 % deeper than 2, 000 m. Despite its status as a developing nation, South Africa has a relatively strong history of marine taxonomic research and maintains comprehensive and well-curated museum collections totaling over 291, 000 records. Over 3 million locality records from more than 23, 000 species have been lodged in the regional AfrOBIS (African Ocean Biogeographic Information System) data center (which stores data from a wider African region). A large number of regional guides to the marine fauna and flora are also available and are listed. The currently recorded marine biota of South Africa numbers at least 12, 914 species, although many taxa, particularly those of small body size, remain poorly documented. The coastal zone is relatively well sampled with some 2, 500 samples of benthic invertebrate communities have been taken by <b>grab,</b> <b>dredge,</b> or trawl. Almost none of these samples, however, were collected after 1980, and over 99 % of existing samples are from depths shallower than 1, 000 m [...] indeed 83 % are from less than 100 m. The abyssal zone thus remains almost completely unexplored. South Africa has a fairly large industrial fishing industry, of which the largest fisheries are the pelagic (pilchard and anchovy) and demersal (hake) sectors, both focused on the west and south coasts. The east coast has fewer, smaller commercial fisheries, but a high coastal population density, resulting in intense exploitation of inshore resources by recreational and subsistence fishers, and this has resulted in the overexploitation of many coastal fish and invertebrate stocks. South Africa has a small aquaculture industry rearing mussels, oysters, prawns, and abalone [...] the latter two in land-based facilities. Compared with many other developing countries, South Africa has a well-conserved coastline, 23 % of which is under formal protection, however deeper waters are almost entirely excluded from conservation areas. Marine pollution is confined mainly to the densely populated KwaZulu-Natal coast and the urban centers of Cape Town and Port Elizabeth.

40|$|Otter {{trawling}} {{has been}} the prevalent method of ground fishing in Atlantic Canada. Despite this, {{little is known about}} associated impacts to benthic habitat and communities. This thesis examines the impacts of otter trawling on bivalves living in sand, a bottom type occurring widely over the Grand Banks. Bivalves are dominant members of sandy bottoms on continental shelves and are good indicators of physical disturbance. Two broad categories of impacts to benthos from mobile fishing gear are direct harvest and incidental damage. Bivalves have low susceptibility to capture by groundfish otter trawls; trawl capture efficiency is on the order of 10 ⁻⁵. In order to investigate incidental impacts, a three-year otter trawling experiment was conducted on a fine to medium sand bottom on the northeastern Grand Bank. Each year a total of 12 trawl passes were made along the centre line of two 13 km by 200 m experimental corridors. Sampling was conducted inside experimental and adjacent reference corridors with a 0. 5 m² <b>hydraulic</b> <b>grab.</b> No significant effects of trawling were detected on bivalve populations in any year. Shallow burrowing species showed no significant changes in density or biomass and recruitment of juveniles ≤ 3 mm was apparent inside trawled corridors. The size structure of populations from trawled and reference areas were similar. Mean (± sd) percent major shell damage immediately after trawling was low, ranging from 2. 8 ± 6. 1 % to 13. 5 + 9. 4 %. Trawl doors are the most destructive gear component of otter trawls. A physical trawl door model was towed through an artificial sand testbed, constructed to resemble an offshore seabed. Although bivalves within the scour path were displaced, levels of damage were low (c. 5 %), similar to levels of damage from the combined effects of all gear components recorded in the field experiment. The anomaly of displacement, accompanied by few instances of damage, is explained by sediment mechanics associated with scouring and size and life position of infaunal bivalves. Compared to natural sediment-mediated disturbances, otter trawling can be manipulated over a wide range of frequencies. Individual and population-level adaptive traits probably confer considerable stability to sandy bottom bivalve populations exposed to typical patterns of trawling activity on the Grand Banks...|$|R

An adequate sampling tool of individuals in the sand is needed to quantify the acoustic availability and understand the dynamic of the sandeel behavioural. The grab has high catch efficiency, but the operation is time consuming and even small stones may prevent the mouth to close properly. Therefore, a modified scallop dredge is preferred in Norwegian and Danish sandeel surveys, but {{little is known about the}} catching properties and catch efficiency of the dredge. In this study, the efficiency of the dredge was estimated by comparing it with the catch rates of a Van Veen grab. Moreover, the precision of the dredge was examined in a parallel towing experiment. <b>Grab</b> and <b>dredge</b> samples carried out at the same positions showed no difference in size distributions of sandeels in the catches, but the average catch of individuals per m 2 was considerably higher in the grab. Assuming a 100 % catch efficiency of the grab, the catch efficiency in the dredge was estimated to be 5. 7 % (SD = 6. 3 %). The low efficiency may question the sampling reliability of the dredge, but the catch rates of the parallel dredge hauls were strongly correlated (r 2 = 0. 90) and suggest that the dredge provides a relatively precise measure of the density of sandeel at a location. Thus, as all lesser sandeels probably are in the seabed at night, the difference in catch rates at night and the subsequent day at a given location will presumably reflect the acoustic availability. However, the low catch efficiency calls for the development of a more efficient sampling dredge. Keywords: acoustics, lesser sandeel, dredge, catch efficiency, availability, North Se...|$|R
40|$|The El Arraiche {{field is}} a new mud volcano field {{discovered}} near the Moroccan shelf edge in the Gulf of Cadiz that consists of 8 mud volcanoes in water depths from 200 to 700 m. The largest mud volcano in the field (Al Idrissi mud volcano) is 255 m high and 5. 4 km wide. The cluster was discovered during a survey with the RV Belgica and studied further during Leg 2 of the TTR 12 survey onboard the R/V Prof Logachev. The 2002 surveys yielded detailed multibeam bathymetry over a 700 km 2 study area, dense grids of high-resolution seismic data, deep-tow sub bottom profiles, sidescan sonar mosaics over the major structures. Selected video imagery lines, video guided <b>grab</b> samples, <b>dredge</b> samples, gravity cores, and box cores were collected for groundtruthing purposes. Eight mud volcanoes in water depths from 200 to 700 m cluster around two, sub-parallel anticlines and associated active extensional faults. Rock clasts and regional seismic data locate the El Arraiche field over a Late Miocene–Pliocene extensional basin. The onset of mud volcanic activity is estimated at about 2. 4 Ma and probably roots in the Cretaceous–Miocene accretionary wedge. Stacked outflows are visible up {{to a depth of}} about 500 m below the sea floor. The occurrence of long-lived mud volcanoes bear witness to continued overpressure generation at depth, either by in situ oil and gas generation or by focussed flow and accumulation in the area. Geochemical analyses of pore water from cores demonstrate the presence of thermogenic hydrocarbon processes. The activity of the mud volcanoes is indicated by the thickness of hemi-pelagic sediments covering extruded mud breccia, the occurrence of seep-typical fauna, the degree of mixing between thermogenic and biogenic hydrocarbon processes, or the depth {{to the base of the}} sulphate reduction zone. Given its structural setting and the evidence of thermogenic and biogenic hydrocarbons, the area has promising hydrocarbon potential but remains untested...|$|R
40|$|Chatham Rise is a broad, {{elongated}} submarine {{platform that}} extends 1100 km {{out into the}} Southwest Pacific off eastern South Island. The surficial sediments on the central portion of the Rise at depths of 200 - 500 m include significant concentrations of the mineral glauconite (10 - 80 wt%) associated with skeletal carbonate, fine terrigenous material and locally abundant phosphatic nodules. This is the first study to fully analyse the nature, origin and economic potential of the glauconite component. Sub-bottom 3. 5 kHz profiles have established the distribution, geometry and thickness (10 - 200 cm) of the surficial deposits, which overlie partially indurated Oligocene chalk of probable Whaingaroan age (~ 34 - 27 Ma). 137 <b>grab,</b> <b>dredge</b> or piston core samples have been analysed for their texture, mineralogy and geochemistry, which has produced a new surficial sediment map for the central Chatham Rise. Glauconite most commonly occurs as dark green to black, very fine to fine sand-sized (0. 2 mm), polished ovoidal and lobate pellets, and less commonly as infills within foraminiferal tests or as variably replaced rock fragments and phosphatic clasts. Full physical analysis reveals seven morphological types of glauconite including, in order of decreasing abundance, ovoidal, lobate, composite, internal molds, fossil casts, pigmentary, tabular and pellets within rock fragments. Their internal fabrics are dominated by random microcrystalline varieties with some oriented fibroradiating rim and skeletal infill types. Other notable features of some glauconite pellets include their expansion cracks, opaque inclusions and variable degrees of limonitisation. XRF/XRD analyses reveal mainly diagenetically mature varieties having elevated K 2 O (7 - 9 wt%) and Fe 2 O 3 (19 - 23 wt%) values, and a dominant 10 Å glauconitic mica structure involving from 10 - 20 % expandable smectite layers. K-Ar dates on pellets indicate a Late Miocene age (av. 5. 75 Ma). This “old” age, {{as well as the}} clear evidence of reworking shown by the dominance of smooth polished ovoidal grains, mean that the central Chatham Rise glauconites are predominantly allogenic (i. e. derived/reworked), and neither strictly authigenic nor in situ, despite occurring in “modern” seafloor deposits. The formation of glauconite is linked to prominent upwelling within the Subtropical Front (STF) zone over the Rise in the Late Miocene, and the attendant heightened primary productivity, bacterial activity and nutrients associated with widespread biogenic blooms at that time. The source of the smectite required for glauconite formation could have been from the devitrification of volcanic ash from diverse eruptive centres, or through “neoformation”/authigenic precipitation within pore water solutions of carbonate-rich waters in the Oligocene/Miocene chalk substrate. Glauconite formation largely ceased after the Late Miocene due to an increase in terrigenous input, a reduced smectite source, and a major period of lowered sea level associated with Antarctic ice sheet growth. The “modern” Chatham glauconite pellets were sourced from submarine erosion of the former Late Miocene sediments and have been dispersed by intensified bottom current circulation at times of lowered sea level within the complex STF over Chatham Rise, and possibly ice scouring. Effectively there exists a widespread “Chatham unconformity” (mid-Oligocene to Recent) which cuts out most of the last 30 myr of the sedimentary record on central Chatham Rise, except for the highly condensed surficial deposits whose glauconite grains formed 5 - 6 Ma, in the Late Miocene. This long-lasting “Chatham unconformity” is a greatly extended version of the well documented Oligocene Marshall Paraconformity. The thickness of the surficial sediment cover on central Chatham Rise ranges from 0. 06 - 1. 35 m. By using a conservative estimate of 0. 5 m thick, and the wt% of glauconite within the sediment cover, a resource estimate of the glauconite has been made for various areas. In the most glauconite-rich area (> 50 wt% glauconite) in the vicinity of Reserve Bank in 200 - 300 m water depths, which has an aerial extend of 4, 500 km 2, the glauconite resource amounts to about 2 Bt. The Chatham Rise glauconites have substantial economic potential as a potash fertiliser in support of the strong agricultural-based economy of New Zealand. Glauconite is widespread in many Late Cretaceous-Cenozoic sedimentary deposits in the New Zealand rock record and the Chatham Rise occurrences provide a useful uniformitarian analogue for at least some of these...|$|R
40|$|Comprehensive {{information}} on Antarctic macrobenthic community structure has been publicly available since the 1960 s. It stems from trawl, <b>dredge,</b> <b>grab,</b> and corer samples {{as well as}} from direct and camera observations (Table 1 – 2). The quality of this information varies considerably; it consists of pure descriptions, figures for presence (absence) and abundance of some key taxa or proxies for such parameters, e. g. sea-floor cover. Some data sets even cover a defined and complete proportion of the macrobenthos with further analyses on diversity and zoogeography. As a consequence the acquisition of data from approximately 90 different campaigns assembled here was not standardised. Nevertheless, it was possible to classify this broad variety of known macrobenthic assemblages to the best of expert knowledge (Gutt 2007; Fig. 1). This overview does not replace statistically sound community and diversity analyses. However, it shows from where which kind of information is available and it acts {{as an example of the}} feasibility and power of such data collections. The data set provides unique georeferenced biological basic information for the planning of future coordinated research activities, e. g. under the umbrella of the biology program “Antarctic Thresholds - Ecosystem Resilience and Adaptation” (AnT-ERA) of the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) and especially for actual conservation issues, e. g. the planning of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) by the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) ...|$|R
40|$|Detailed {{investigations}} of the submarine portions of Pantelleria were carried out in 2006 and 2008 (aboard R Urania) using a 50 kHz multibeam bathymetric system and through collecting seafloor samples by <b>dredging,</b> <b>grabbing</b> and coring. The high resolution bathymetric data, acquired from – 20 m down to - 1300 m, furnished a digital terrain model allowing a detailed morphological reconstruction of the seafloor geological features. The main focus of this work is the characterization of the submarine flanks of Pantelleria. This was accomplished through observations and geo-morphometric analysis particularly of the volcanic morphologies. For the first time, numerous volcanic cones were identified on the NW offshore of Pantelleria and have been investigated based on morphological and morphometric parameters, {{with the aim of}} summarizing the most significant volcano-morphological parameters of these edifices. Moreover, marine surveys used high resolution bathymetry and sampling to locate and characterize the 1891 submarine eruption that occurred offshore Pantelleria Island. During the 1891 eruption, the observed activity lasted for 8 -days with the presence of steam plumes and floating lava basaltic bombs (“lava balloons”), rising buoyantly to the sea surface 5 km W-NW from Pantelleria village (Riccò, 1892). The study of the products recovered in the area nearby the eruption allowed for a rigorous characterization of this eruption in term of vent location and eruptive style. Finally, the morphological mapping of the area offshore Pantelleria volcano was made with the aim to assess potential marine geohazards. This work provides a detailed overview of the area and a valuable road map for designing further studies. The characterization and study of the collected samples is still ongoing and offer a great opportunity not only for geology but also for other natural science disciplines (e. g., biology, palaeontology) ...|$|R

A survey involving REMOTS® sediment-profile imaging in conjunction with benthic grab sampling and taxonomic analysis subsequently was conducted to assess the physical characteristics of the disposed material on the seafloor and the degree, if any, to which it had become colonized by benthic macroinvertebrates. The REMOTS® images showed that a poorly-sorted mixture of cobbles, pebbles, sand, silt-clay and shell fragments comprised the dredged material deposit, while homogenous silt-clay characterized the seafloor at three nearby reference areas unaffected by disposal. A higher total number of individuals in each of several major taxonomic groups (polychaetes, crustaceans, echinoderms, molluscs, and nemerteans) was found in <b>grab</b> samples from <b>dredged</b> material stations compared to the reference stations. Two multivariate statistical techniques (clustering and non-metric multidimensional scaling) and the ANOSIM significance test confirmed that the benthic community at the disposal site was significantly different from that at the reference areas, due to higher numbers of taxa and higher organism abundance on the dredged material deposit. Higher sand content, greater sediment stability and increased habitat variety were seen as the main factors accounting for the apparent stimulation of the benthic community at the disposal location. It was concluded that benthic organisms had successfully colonized the dredged material following the cessation of disposal activities in 1993. The results are of ecological interest in showing the type of recolonization that may occur in a subtropical soft-bottom environment and also from a management standpoint, by demonstrating that disposal of uncontaminated dredged material may create new habitat that increases benthic community abundance and diversity.
