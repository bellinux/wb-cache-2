5|$|The first {{screening}} test in someone {{suspected of having}} HIT is aimed at detecting antibodies against heparin-PF4 complexes. This may be with a laboratory test of the ELISA (<b>enzyme-linked</b> <b>immunosorbent</b> <b>assay)</b> type. The ELISA test, however, detects all circulating antibodies that bind heparin-PF4 complexes, and may also falsely identify antibodies that do not cause HIT. Therefore, those with a positive ELISA are tested further with a functional assay. This test uses platelets and serum from the patient; the platelets are washed and mixed with serum and heparin. The sample is then tested {{for the release of}} serotonin, a marker of platelet activation. If this serotonin release assay (SRA) shows high serotonin release, the diagnosis of HIT is confirmed. The SRA test is difficult to perform and is usually only done in regional laboratories.|$|E
5|$|HIV-1 {{testing is}} {{initially}} by an <b>enzyme-linked</b> <b>immunosorbent</b> <b>assay</b> (ELISA) to detect antibodies to HIV-1. Specimens with a nonreactive {{result from the}} initial ELISA are considered HIV-negative unless new exposure to an infected partner or partner of unknown HIV status has occurred. Specimens with a reactive ELISA result are retested in duplicate. If the result of either duplicate test is reactive, the specimen is reported as repeatedly reactive and undergoes confirmatory testing with a more specific supplemental test (e.g., western blot or, less commonly, an immunofluorescence assay (IFA)). Only specimens that are repeatedly reactive by ELISA and positive by IFA or reactive by western blot are considered HIV-positive and indicative of HIV infection. Specimens that are repeatedly ELISA-reactive occasionally provide an indeterminate western blot result, which may be either an incomplete antibody response to HIV in an infected person or nonspecific reactions in an uninfected person.|$|E

25|$|The {{presence}} of ANAs in blood {{can be confirmed}} by a screening test. Although there are many tests {{for the detection of}} ANAs, the most common tests used for screening are indirect immunofluorescence and <b>enzyme-linked</b> <b>immunosorbent</b> <b>assay</b> (ELISA). Following detection of ANAs, various subtypes are determined.|$|E
25|$|<b>Enzyme-linked</b> <b>immunosorbent</b> <b>assay</b> (ELISA) {{is used in}} {{diagnostic}} laboratories to detect ANCAs.

Variations in binding between lots, batches, and types of plastic were found. Well-to-well variation {{was found to be}} of greater statistical significance than edge effect and should be a consideration in selection of a plate lot for <b>enzyme-linked</b> <b>immunosorbent</b> <b>assays.</b> Lots of plates should be pretested by the investigator to determine whether there is good binding of the antigen to be used and whether there is low plate-to-plate and well-to-well variation...|$|R
40|$|Five commercially {{available}} <b>enzyme-linked</b> <b>immunosorbent</b> <b>assays</b> for {{the measurement of}} anti-tetanus toxoid immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies were evaluated for performance.

40|$|A {{chemically}} synthesized copy (S-CB 7) of {{a fragment}} (35 amino acid residues) of type 24 streptococcal M protein was covalently linked to polylysine with carbodiimide and injected subcutaneously into rabbits without adjuvant. Although the primary immune responses {{as measured by}} <b>enzyme-linked</b> <b>immunosorbent</b> <b>assays</b> at biweekly intervals were weak, the secondary responses as measured by both <b>enzyme-linked</b> <b>immunosorbent</b> <b>assays</b> and opsonophagocytic assays were as high as those obtained previously in rabbits immunized with the peptide conjugate emulsified in complete Freund adjuvant. Injection of murabutide, a synthetic muramyl dipeptide derivative of bacterial peptidoglycan, with the initial immunizing dose of peptide conjugate had no apparent effect on the secondary immune responses. These results indicate that protective immune responses may be raised against polylysine conjugates of chemically synthesized peptide copies of streptococcal M protein without adjuvant...|$|R
25|$|The <b>enzyme-linked</b> <b>immunosorbent</b> <b>assay</b> (ELISA) or Western {{blotting}} are {{two different}} ways that the purified antigen (or multiple antigens) can be obtained and analyzed. This method involves purifying an antigen through the aid of an attached antibody on a solid (beaded) support, such as agarose resin. The immobilized protein complex can be accomplished either in a single step or successively.|$|E
25|$|Diagnosis of {{infection}} {{is confirmed by}} the identification of eggs in stools. Eggs of S. mansoni are approximately 140 by 60µm in size, and have a lateral spine.

Other methods that can be used are <b>enzyme-linked</b> <b>immunosorbent</b> <b>assay</b> (ELISA), circumoval precipitation test, and alkaline phosphatase immunoassay.|$|E
25|$|The <b>enzyme-linked</b> <b>immunosorbent</b> <b>assay</b> {{works by}} using {{antibodies}} immobilised on a microtiter plate to capture proteins of interest from samples {{added to the}} well. Using a detection antibody conjugated to an enzyme or fluorophore the quantity of bound protein can be accurately measured by fluorometric or colourimetric detection.

25|$|IgG {{antibody}} precipitin testing from serum is useful, {{as positive}} results {{are found in}} between 69–90% of patients, though also in 10% of asthmatics with and without SAFS. Therefore, it must be {{used in conjunction with}} other tests. Various forms exist, including <b>enzyme-linked</b> <b>immunosorbent</b> <b>assay</b> (ELISA) and fluorescent enzyme immunoassay (FEIA). Both are more sensitive than conventional counterimmunoelectrophoresis. IgG may not be entirely specific for ABPA, as high levels are also found in chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA) alongside more severe radiological findings.|$|E
25|$|The <b>enzyme-linked</b> <b>immunosorbent</b> <b>assay</b> or ELISA is a {{diagnostic}} method for quantitatively or semi-quantitatively determining protein concentrations from blood plasma, serum or cell/tissue extracts in a multi-well plate format (usually 96-wells per plate). Broadly, proteins in solution are adsorbed to ELISA plates. Antibodies specific for the protein of interest {{are used to}} probe the plate. Background is minimised by optimising blocking and washing methods (as for IHC), and specificity is ensured via the presence {{of positive and negative}} controls. Detection methods are usually colorimetric or chemiluminescence based.|$|E
25|$|The ANA test detects the autoantibodies {{present in}} an individual's blood serum. The common tests used for {{detecting}} and quantifying ANAs are indirect immunofluorescence and <b>enzyme-linked</b> <b>immunosorbent</b> <b>assay</b> (ELISA). In immunofluorescence, {{the level of}} autoantibodies is reported as a titre. This is the highest dilution of the serum at which autoantibodies are still detectable. Positive autoantibody titres at a dilution {{equal to or greater}} than 1:160 are usually considered as clinically significant. Positive titres of less than 1:160 are present in up to 20% of the healthy population, especially the elderly. Although positive titres of 1:160 or higher are strongly associated with autoimmune disorders, they are also found in 5% of healthy individuals. Autoantibody screening is useful in the diagnosis of autoimmune disorders and monitoring levels helps to predict the progression of disease. A positive ANA test is seldom useful if other clinical or laboratory data supporting a diagnosis are not present.|$|E

Examples include <b>enzyme-linked</b> <b>immunosorbent</b> <b>assays.</b>|$|R
25|$|Leishmaniasis is {{diagnosed}} in the hematology laboratory by direct visualization of the amastigotes (Leishman-Donovan bodies). Buffy-coat preparations of peripheral blood or aspirates from marrow, spleen, lymph nodes, or skin lesions should be spread on a slide {{to make a}} thin smear and stained with Leishman stain or Giemsa stain (pH 7.2) for 20 minutes. Amastigotes are seen within blood and spleen monocytes or, less commonly, in circulating neutrophils and in aspirated tissue macrophages. They are small, round bodies 2–4 μm in diameter with indistinct cytoplasm, a nucleus, and a small, rod-shaped kinetoplast. Occasionally, amastigotes may be seen lying free between cells. However, the retrieval of tissue samples is often painful for the patient and identification of the infected cells can be difficult. So, other indirect immunological methods of diagnosis are developed, including <b>enzyme-linked</b> <b>immunosorbent</b> <b>assay,</b> antigen-coated dipsticks, and direct agglutination test. Although these tests are readily available, {{they are not the}} standard diagnostic tests due to their insufficient sensitivity and specificity.|$|E
25|$|<b>Enzyme-linked</b> <b>immunosorbent</b> <b>assay</b> (ELISA) uses antigen-coated microtitre plates for the {{detection}} of ANAs. Each well of a microtitre plate is coated with either a single antigen or multiple antigens to detect specific antibodies or to screen for ANAs, respectively. The antigens are either from cell extracts or recombinant. Blood serum is incubated in the wells of the plate and is washed out. If antibodies that bind to antigen are present then they will remain after washing. A secondary anti-human antibody conjugated to an enzyme such as horseradish peroxidase. The enzyme reaction will produce a change in colour of the solution that is proportional to the amount of antibody bound to the antigen. There are significant differences in {{the detection}} of ANA by immunofluorescence and different ELISA kits and there is only a marginal agreement between these. A clinician must be familiar with the differences in order to evaluate the outcomes of the various assays.|$|E
25|$|The {{specific}} {{diagnosis of}} EVD {{is confirmed by}} isolating the virus, detecting its RNA or proteins, or detecting antibodies against the virus in a person's blood. Isolating the virus by cell culture, detecting the viral RNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and detecting proteins by <b>enzyme-linked</b> <b>immunosorbent</b> <b>assay</b> (ELISA) are methods best used {{in the early stages}} of the disease and also for detecting the virus in human remains. Detecting antibodies against the virus is most reliable in the later stages of the disease and in those who recover. IgM antibodies are detectable two days after symptom onset and IgG antibodies can be detected 6 to 18 days after symptom onset. During an outbreak, isolation of the virus via cell culture methods is often not feasible. In field or mobile hospitals, the most common and sensitive diagnostic methods are real-time PCR and ELISA. In 2014, with new mobile testing facilities deployed in parts of Liberia, test results were obtained 3–5 hours after sample submission. In 2015 a rapid antigen test which gives results in 15 minutes was approved for use by WHO. It is able to confirm Ebola in 92% of those affected and rule it out in 85% of those not affected.|$|E
