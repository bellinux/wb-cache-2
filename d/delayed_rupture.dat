30|$|The {{mechanism}} of <b>delayed</b> splenic <b>rupture</b> {{in our case}} {{was considered to be}} the result of a tear in the subcapsular hematoma caused by stretching of the splenocolic ligament. The patient started complaining about abdominal and shoulder pain suddenly after defecation, which led us to suspect that the bowel movement had caused the splenocolic ligament to stretch at the splenic flexure. Also, defecation might cause rising of intra-abdominal pressure that could induce a rupture of the hematoma. There have also been a few reports of splenic rupture as a complication of colonoscopy [11]. One of the reported mechanisms underlying such complications is stretching of the splenocolic ligament during colonoscopy, which can lead to avulsion or tearing of the spleen. This {{mechanism of}} <b>delayed</b> splenic <b>rupture</b> is considered to be rare and unpredictable. However, other reports describe cases of <b>delayed</b> splenic <b>rupture</b> caused by laceration of a perisplenic hematoma stretched by distending the stomach after eating a heavy meal [12].|$|R

30|$|The EPL tendon has {{a tenuous}} blood supply. <b>Delayed</b> <b>rupture</b> has been {{reported}} after both displaced and undisplaced fractures of the distal radius, in adults and in children [6, 7, 8]. <b>Delayed</b> <b>rupture</b> has also been reported after closed treatment and after internal fixation with various devices, including volar locking plates [9, 10]. However, rupture of the EPL tendon in children is rare and, as a complication of flexible nail insertion, has been only occasionally reported [11]. To our knowledge, there are only nine cases in the English literature, five of which were not reported in detail [2, 11, 12]. We report our experience of this complication, make recommendations regarding the choice of nail entry point and highlight the importance of early recognition of EPL dysfunction after radial ESIN.|$|E

40|$|PurposeDelayed {{abdominal}} {{aortic aneurysm}} (AAA) rupture {{is a well}} recognized complication of endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). We wanted to evaluate the frequency, etiology, and outcomes of <b>delayed</b> AAA <b>rupture</b> following EVAR, and identify treatment options that facilitate improved survival. MethodsFrom 2002 to 2009, 1768 patients underwent elective and emergent EVAR. At a mean follow-up of 29 months, 27 (1. 5 %) patients presented with <b>delayed</b> AAA <b>rupture</b> and required repair by either open surgical conversion or endovascular means. All data were prospectively collected in a vascular registry, and outcomes analyzed. ResultsOver a mean follow-up of 29 months, the incidence of <b>delayed</b> AAA <b>rupture</b> after elective EVAR was 1. 4 % (24 of 1615 patients), and after emergent EVAR for ruptured AAA was 2. 8 % (3 of 106 patients). Of the 27 <b>delayed</b> AAA <b>rupture</b> patients, 20 (74 %) were considered “lost to follow-up,” and, at presentation, 17 (63 %) patients had Type 1 endoleak with stent graft migration, three (11 %) had Type 1 endoleak without stent graft migration, five (19 %) had Type 2 endoleak, and two (7 %) had undetermined etiology for aneurysm rupture. Fifteen (55 %) patients underwent open surgical repair via retroperitoneal approach with partial (n = 8; 53 %) or complete (n = 7; 47 %) stent graft explants and aortoiliac reconstruction, 11 (41 %) patients underwent a second EVAR, and one (4 %) patient refused treatment and died. Supraceliac aortic clamp was required in three (20 %) patients with open surgical conversion, and supraceliac occlusion balloon was required in two (18 %) patients with EVAR. There were three (11 %) postoperative deaths; two following open surgical conversion and one following EVAR. One additional redo-EVAR patient has undergone successful elective conversion to open surgical repair for persistent type II endoleak and increase in AAA size. ConclusionsDelayed AAA rupture following EVAR can be successfully managed in most patients by open surgical conversion or secondary EVAR. The approach to each patient should be individualized; complete stent graft explant is not necessary in most patients; a secondary EVAR for <b>delayed</b> AAA <b>rupture</b> with or without an elective conversion to open surgical repair remains a viable option. Vigilant routine follow-up is needed for all patients after EVAR...|$|R

30|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} <b>delayed</b> <b>rupture</b> of great earthquakes along the Nankai trough on tsunami heights on the Japanese coast. As the tsunami source, we used {{a model of the}} 1707 Hoei earthquake, which consists of four segments: Tokai, Tonankai, and two Nankai segments. We first searched for the worst case, in terms of coastal tsunami heights, of rupture delay time on each segment, on the basis of superposition principle for the linear long wave theory. When the rupture starts on the Tonankai segment, followed by rupture on the Tokai segment 21 min later, as well as the eastern and western Nankai segments 15 and 28 min later, respectively, the average coastal tsunami height becomes the largest. To quantify the tsunami amplification, we compared the coastal tsunami heights from the <b>delayed</b> <b>rupture</b> with those from the simultaneous rupture model. Along the coasts of the sea of Hyu’uga and in the Bungo Channel, the tsunami heights become significantly amplified (> 1.4 times larger) relative to the simultaneous rupture. Along the coasts of Tosa Bay and in the Kii Channel, the tsunami heights become amplified about 1.2 times. Along the coasts of the sea of Kumano and Ise Bay, and the western Enshu coast, the tsunami heights become slightly smaller for the <b>delayed</b> <b>rupture.</b> Along the eastern Enshu coast, the coast of Suruga Bay, and the west coast of Sagami Bay, the tsunami heights become amplified about 1.1 times.|$|E

40|$|The {{diagnosis}} of <b>delayed</b> splenic <b>rupture</b> can put most astute clinician into dilemma. The case presented below outlines {{the difficulty in}} diagnosing splenic rupture when acute history is unavailable, and symptoms misleading diagnosis. Splenic rupture is usually reported in a pathologic spleen secondary to diseases such as infection, neoplasia and infiltrative processes. <b>Delayed</b> splenic <b>rupture</b> {{is not a new}} phenomenon and was described in the literature by Perasalo in 1949. The reason behind this case report is to emphasize the fact that the patient with blunt splenic trauma can present in many ways. The clinical signs and symptoms can vary widely where some patients being asymptomatic and others present in extremis. Massive haemorrhage commonly occurs from injuries to this friable vascular organ. Usually diagnosis is easy in these cases. History of abdominal pain with left upper quadrant tenderness or signs of peritonitis in a patient is the most common presentation. Diagnosis is challenging where history is not relevant and clinical examination is not conclusive. The mortality rate from simple splenic rupture is 1 percent; delayed {{diagnosis of}} a ruptured spleen increases the rate to 10 percent. Time is of the essence in these cases and early diagnosis is important to avoid grave morbidity or mortality.
