5000|$|Ford {{produced}} an engine with two overhead cams (one cam per head) and hemispherical chambers in the mid-1960s. The engine, displacing 425 cubic inches and {{belonging to the}} FE family of Ford engines, {{was known as the}} [...] "427 SOHC"; it was also known as the Cammer. It was basically a set of SOHC hemi heads that bolted onto Ford's FE engine block. The 1964 engine was designed in 90 days of intensive engineering effort for use in racing. The 427 SOHC used the side oiler engine block modified slightly to deal with the missing in-block cam among other OHC issues. Because of their power levels, and the fact that Chrysler had showed Bill France that a DOHC 426 Hemi was in the works, it was banned from NASCAR races, though allowed in certain drag racing classes. After the NASCAR ban, Ford continued to produce the SOHC, selling it over the counter to racers and others who used it to power many altered-wheelbase A/FX Mustangs and supercharged Top Fuel dragsters. Connie Kalitta, Pete Robinson, and [...] "Snake" [...] Prudhomme all used the engine in their Top Fuel racers. In 1967 Connie Kalitta's SOHC-powered [...] "Bounty Hunter" [...] won Top Fuel honors at AHRA, NHRA and NASCAR winter meets, becoming the only [...] "triple crown" [...] winner in drag racing history. Dynamometer results of the day showed the SOHC Hemi producing almost 700 hp (522 kW) <b>in</b> <b>crate</b> form (100 hp per liter). The overhead cams meant that it was not as rpm-limited as the Chrysler Hemis were with their pushrods and heavy and complex valvetrains.|$|E

40|$|Power utility {{companies}} are really important {{in our daily}} routine since theyprovide us with power delivery, which is essential in today's society. Withthe advance of technology, {{a lot of the}} procedures that were being manuallydone by these companies to deliver electrical power, have been automated andcentrally controlled by Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems. Therefore, this automation must be protected from external attackersthat want to hurt control systems (e. g. SCADA), either by stealing sensitivedata or even by getting control of the control system and changing parametersand functions that are essential for the good and healthy function of thesesystems. Exploiting vulnerabilities in the oce network can bring an adversarya step closer in getting access to the control system. It is not sucient onits own, but the adversary can launch further attacks from there targeting thecontrol system. The aim of this thesis is to construct a reference model of a typical IT infrastructureof the oce network of a power utility company, with a simpliedimplementation <b>in</b> <b>CRATE.</b> CRATE (Cyber Range And Training Environment) is the environment that was used for the implementation of the thesis, providedby the Swedish Defense Research Agency [FOI]. After the implementation isnished, a SCADA system of an enterprise will be installed <b>in</b> <b>CRATE</b> and willbe connected with this oce network. Once this is done, the Swedish DefenseResearch Agency will simulate cyber-attacks in a more complete infrastructure. The point of this thesis is to make the oce infrastructure as close to a real enterprisenetwork, although there with some dierentiation, part of it on purposeand part of it due to some limitations. Elbolags existens är essentiell i dagens samhälle med tanke på att elbolagenlevererar el vilket viktiga samhällsfunktioner beror på. Idag har avanceradteknologi gjort det möjligt att konvertera diverse procedurer som tidigare genomförts manuellt för att leverera elektricitet att genomföras automatiserat ochcentralstyrt via systemet Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADAsystem). Det är därför ytterst viktigt att skydda det automatiserade systemetfrån externa angripare d. v. s. IT-intrång som vill skada det använda styrsystemett. ex. SCADA-styrsystem. Skada kan ske antingen genom att stjälakänsliga uppgifter eller få kontroll över styrsystemet och ändra på parametraroch funktioner som är väsentliga för ett välfungerande system. Att exploaterasårbarheter i kontorsnätverk kan mojliggöra att motståndare hamnar ett stegnärmare att få tillgång till styrsystemet. Syftet med denna studie är att konstruera en referensmodell av en typisk ITinfrastrukturav kontorsnätet på ett elbolag med en förenklad tillämpning inomCyber Range And Training Environment (CRATE). CRATE är en miljö förcyberövningar som tillhandahålls av Totalförsvarets Forskningsinstitut (FOI) och som har använts i denna studie för att implementera referensmodellen. När referensmodellen av kontorsnätet har implementerats, installeras det ävenett SCADA-system i CRATE, och dessa kopplas tillsammans. Därmed skaFOI kunna simulera cyberattacker i en mer komplett infrastruktur. Syftet meddenna studie var att skapa ett så pass verkligt kontorsnät som möjligt trots vissdifferentiering jämfört med verkligheten på grund av bl. a. vissa begräsningar...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} divided in two parts, one {{that deals with}} the {{development}} of the new data acquisition system at Lund Nuclear Microprobe, and a second part that deals with different applications. A CAMAC based data acquisition system has been installed at the Lund Nuclear Microprobe facility. The system is a true multi-parameter and multi-detector system with fast FERA bus readout and <b>in</b> <b>crate</b> memory buffer. Each event in a detector produces a gate to all of the multiple parameters that should be acquired in coincidence. The system reads and tags each event and scaler word with X-Y position. The charge is measured by a current digitiser connected to a scaler. The beam scanning part is software controlled through a Timed D/A converter, this allows for fast scanning of the beam, this unit generates the coordinates. The work {{with the development of}} this system is described. Applications in various fields are discussed: Otolith analyses and micro fossil analyses. To know a fish life history (or the age of the fish) {{is an important factor in}} assessment of fish populations. Otolith growth is a combination of seasonal and daily increments combined with random events. The otolith develops in rings from its center (incremental zone), a tiny ring presents when the fish hatches. The Sr level in this point is transferred from the mother. The analyses of otoliths from Salmo trutta and Anguilla anguilla are reported...|$|E
40|$|When picking {{objects from}} the floor, low back pain {{patients}} often tend to support the upper body by leaning {{with one hand on}} a thigh. While this strategy may reduce back load, this has not yet been assessed, probably due to the difficulty of measuring the forces between hand and thigh. Ten healthy male subjects lifted a pencil and a crate from the floor, with four lifting techniques (free, squat, stoop and a Weight Lifters Technique (WLT)), each of which was performed with and without supporting with one hand on the thigh. A six Degrees of Freedom force transducer, with a comfortable surface to support the hand on, was mounted just above the subject's left knee. Hand forces, ground reaction forces, full body kinematics, and trunk EMG were measured. Using inverse dynamics and taking the forces between hand and thigh into account, we calculated 3 D L 5 S 1 joint moments, and subsequently estimated spine forces using an EMG-assisted trunk model. For lifting a pencil, hand support reduced average peak total moments by 17 - 25 %, dependent on lifting technique. For crate lifting, hand support reduced total moments by 13 - 19 % compared with one-handed lifting and by 14 - 26 % compared to two-handed lifting. Hand support slightly increased asymmetric motions and caused a substantial increase in asymmetric moments <b>in</b> <b>crate</b> lifting. For compression forces, reductions (up to 28 %) were seen in all techniques except in stoop lifts. It is concluded that leaning with a hand on the thigh can lead to substantial reductions of low back loading during lifting...|$|E
40|$|The {{lithium lens}} in the {{antiproton}} source target vault {{is protected by}} an interlock system, which is located in relay racks R 5 and R 6 near {{the southwest corner of}} the Target Hall (building APO). The interlock system consists of crates of commercial signal conditioner and alarm modules built by Acromag, Inc and interlock Master Modules built by Fermilab: Twenty analog signals from the lens/transformer, power supply, and cooling water system are buffered with signal conditioners (amplifiers), which are located in creates R 5 C and R 5 E. The signals and conditioner assignments are listed in Table 1. Interconnection details are shown in Figure 1. Thermocouple signals come into the conditioners directly from the vault or water system via 12 -pair multiconductor thermocouple extension cables. All other signals pass through a master connection panel on the east end of rack R 6. Water flow signals are AC voltages which must be converted by electronics <b>in</b> <b>crate</b> D 2 B to DC voltages before entering their signal conditioners. Each conditioner drives two parallel outputs. One output goes to a Multiplexed Analog to Digital Converter (MADC 25), which is located in R 5 D. This voltage output is read by the accelerator control network (ACNET) and can be displayed at any control console on parameter page P 46. The other voltage output is connected to an alarm module. Thirteen analog signals are processed by alarm modules, which are located in crates R 6 B and R 6 C. Alarm connection details are shown in Figure 2. Each alarm module contains two DPDT relays, one for an upper limit and one for a lower limit. The relays are latching, so that once an input has passed outside a limit, that limit relay remains in the tripped condition until an operator issues a reset pulse. The reset may be generated locally with a pushbutton on the appropriate interlock master module or remotely from controls parameter page P 46 via ACNET. Alarm settings are summarized in engineering units in Table 1, and actual comparitor voltage settings are listed in Figure 2. Each alarm crate contains 10 module slots and is wired as shown in Figure 3, except for the water conductivity slot, which is wired to a separate interlock chain output. Normally open contacts are used for interlock chains, while normally closed contacts provide status bits. The interlock chain outputs are connected to Interlock Master Modules located in D 5 C. Status bits are read into ACNET through a multiplexer in R 4 A, and can be displayed on parameter page S 40. Any alarm slot may be bypassed by inserting a 'dummy' printed circuit card in place of a module. Each interlock master module sums 5 inputs and provides 3 reed relay contact closure outputs. A circuit schematic is shown in Figure 4. Input 1 requires + 5 volts, and directly energizes an interlock chain relay. Input 2 and 3 require TTL logic levels, and inputs 4 and 5 require and external contact closure. Internal switches select which inputs are active Interlock master interconnections are shown in Figure 5. The lens uses two masters, one for water conductivity and the other for all interlocked conditions. The Conductivity Master controls the lens water purging system and also energizes one input of the General Master. The General Master provides the external interlock for the pulsed power supply. If lithium comes into contact with the cooling water, the conductivity master will trip. Output 2 of the Master shuts off the water circulating pump and initiates purging hardware, which isolates the lens from the water supply and allows inert gas to force remaining water from the lens into a reservoir located in the vault. Output 1 of the Master, which is connected to input 4 of the lens General Master, causes the General Master to trip and disable the pulsed power supply. All other lens alarm conditions (except conductivity) enter input 1 and 2 of the Lens General Master. An alarm condition from these inputs will disable the pulsed power supply, but the water system will remain on. Each interlock master has a manual Emergency Stop pushbutton (red) on its front panel. The pushbutton has alternating action, one push enabling the interlock master, the next push opening the interlock chain. all interlock masters are connected to an audible trip alarm module located in R 5 E- 6...|$|E

Carriage of S. typhimurium was significantly higher among birds placed <b>in</b> clean <b>crates</b> than among the uncrated controls, mainly due to an increase in cecal carriers (from 23. 5 % to 61. 5 %).
