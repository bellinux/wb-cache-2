5|$|At the school, Crawford was {{influenced}} by his housemaster, F. B. Malim, {{who presided over the}} archaeological section of the college's Natural History Society and encouraged the boy's interest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject.</b> It is possible that Malim provided something of a father figure for the young Crawford. With the society, Crawford visited such archaeological sites as Stonehenge, West Kennet Long Barrow, Avebury, and Martinsell. It was also through the society that he obtained Ordnance Survey maps of the landscape, allowing him to explore the downs near to his aunts' home. He began excavation of a barrow near to Bull's Copse, thus attracting the attention of the antiquarian Harold Peake, who was then involved in compiling the Victoria County History of Berkshire. Peake and his wife lived a Bohemian lifestyle, being vegetarians and social reformers, and their ideas had a strong impact on Crawford. Under the Peakes' influence, Crawford rejected his religious upbringing in favour of a rationalist world-view based in science. Crawford gained an appreciation from Peake for the understanding of past societies through an examination of the geographical landscape rather than simply through texts or artefacts.|$|E

5|$|However, the United Kingdom courts {{gradually}} {{adopted a}} single sufficient interest test for all prerogative orders. In R. v.

In Re Lim Chor Pee, ex parte Law Society of Singapore (1986), the Court of Appeal endorsed the sufficient interest test for mandatory orders. In that case, the Law Society of Singapore had applied for a mandamus (now known as a mandatory order) to ensure that the Disciplinary Committee heard and investigated all six charges levied against an advocate and solicitor. The Court, applying the decision of the House of Lords in R. v. Inland Revenue Commissioners, ex parte National Federation of Self-Employed and Small Businesses Ltd.

40|$|Abstract—This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate <b>the</b> mechanisms <b>in</b> weight gain–induced blood pressure (BP) elevation focusing, <b>in</b> particular, on <b>the</b> contributions of sympathetic nervous system activity, fasting plasma insulin, and leptin to BP levels. The study design was longitudinal with a cohort of 1897 men. BP, pulse rate, body mass index (BMI), fasting plasma norepinephrine (NE), insulin, and leptin were measured at 6 and 12 months in those 172 lean normotensive, 79 obese normotensive, 64 lean untreated hypertensive, and 38 obese untreated hypertensive men whose BMI increased. 10 % during the first 6 months. At entry, levels of BP, pulse rate, plasma NE, insulin, and leptin in obese subjects, regardless of BP status, were significantly greater than those <b>in</b> lean <b>subjects.</b> <b>The</b> levels of plasma NE, insulin, and leptin increased with weight gain <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 4 study groups. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> with BP elevation, <b>the</b> increase <b>in</b> pulse rate and plasma NE was significantly greater than that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> without BP elevation at both 6 and 12 months for each of the 4 study groups, although <b>the</b> increase <b>in</b> BMI was similar between <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> with and without BP elevation.

Similarly, the art topic assigned was Romantic art in the European tradition. The Art Resource Guide included sections detailing the lives and works of relevant artists such as Joseph Mallord William Turner, Claude Monet, Albert Bierstadt, and Camille Pissarro.|$|E
