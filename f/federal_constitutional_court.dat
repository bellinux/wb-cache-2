The Bundesverfassungsgericht (<b>Federal</b> <b>Constitutional</b> <b>Court)</b> is the German Supreme Court responsible for constitutional matters, with power of judicial review. Germany's supreme court system, called Oberste Gerichtshöfe des Bundes, is specialised: for civil and criminal cases, the highest court of appeal is the inquisitorial Federal Court of Justice, and for other affairs the courts are the Federal Labour Court, the Federal Social Court, the Federal Finance Court and the Federal Administrative Court.|$|E

40|$|This {{contribution}} revisits the Bundesverfassungsgericht’s {{order for}} reference in the Gauweiler case and focuses on two aspects of that order that until now have not received much scholarly attention. The first concerns the German <b>federal</b> <b>constitutional</b> <b>court’s</b> dissociation of <b>constitutional</b> identity review under the German Basic Law from national identity review under Article 4 (2) TEU. While the decision on the Lisbon Treaty had suggested that the two go "hand in hand", the Bundesverfassungsgericht now emphasizes the "fundamental" difference between the concept of national identity under Article 4 (2) TEU {{on the one hand}} and the German concept of constitutional identity on the other. The second element is the German <b>federal</b> <b>constitutional</b> <b>court’s</b> contention that its approach to ultra vires and constitutional identity review can also be found in the constitutional law of many other member states. Yet, careful analysis demonstrates that while there does indeed seem to be a trend in that direction, and several elements of the German approach can also be found in other countries, very few national courts are as adamant as the Bundesverfassungsgericht, and only a handful have developed their position with the same level of detail and ardor...|$|R

Electoral advertising at government expense would, however, be incompatible with this principle of electoral law.

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} the strong {{conception}} of popular sovereignty employed in the German <b>Federal</b> <b>Constitutional</b> <b>Court's</b> recent decision on the Treaty of Lisbon is incoherent {{and should not be}} used as the centerpiece of a democratic constitutional theory.

In fact, strong conceptions of popular sovereignty eliminate the conceptual space for the idea of legitimate law. This thesis is developed through a critical discussion of Carl Schmitt's constitutional theory-which appears to be the main inspiration behind contemporary arguments for strong popular sovereignty-as well as through an analysis of the Lisbon decision of the Bundesverfassungsgericht. © The Author 2013.

In a supplement to the same edition, Günter Nollau, the resident expert on communism of the West German intelligence service (Verfassungsschutz) underlined that ‘the government hopes to see it applied’. Writing anonymously, Nollau also stressed that what was needed was ‘the immunising of the German people against communism through scientific actions and wide-spread information’ (Thomas, 2014 : p. 134). In the wake of the KPD ban, the party-political balance of BfH publications could be seen from the fact that ApuZ published articles penned, amongst others, by members of the SPD’s Eastern Office (Ostbüro). It also shows that there was an attempt to safeguard the cross-party anticommunist consensus for the long term. ApuZ editors also began to publish annotated excerpts from minutes of the SED’s central committee meetings 17 in order to provide information about political developments in the GDR.|$|R
40|$|The current article {{provides}} a critical {{overview of the}} CJEU’s role as the main ‘architect’ {{of the relationship between}} the EU legal order and the international legal order. The activities of the CJEU are assessed in light of four parameters: the protection of fundamental rights, the protection of the internal division of competences within the EU, issues of primacy and review of legality when international agreements are present, and the relationship between the CJEU and other international tribunals. It is argued that the CJEU in the last decade is increasingly acting in a fashion similar to <b>federal</b> <b>constitutional</b> <b>courts</b> that seek to protect the ‘federal’ level legal order from the intrusions of the international legal order and those of the sub-federal level. In its quest to protect the autonomy of the EU legal order and its own exclusive jurisdiction in a multilevel, pluralistic legal system, the CJEU might have caused more harm than good, affecting legal certainty, and the dialogue between it and the international legal order or international tribunals...|$|R

40|$|When one {{tells the}} {{political}} genealogy of Israel, since its formal inception in 1948 until 2003, a telling conceptual lesson may {{be drawn from}} the adjudication of Israel’s hectic public and political life. The almost unparalleled prominence of its Supreme Court sitting as a High Court of Justice [hereafter- HCJ] is intriguing and fascinating from comparative perspective, as well since the number of cases debated before the Court is about several thousands every year beginning from the 1980 s. Furthermore, in the outset of the 21 st century there is almost no political public controversial affair in Israel that has not formally been named as a legalistic and litigious matter, and debated in the HCJ. In most democratic regimes, e. g., Germany and the USA, such an extensive judicial engagement of the <b>federal</b> <b>constitutional</b> <b>courts</b> in public and political affairs is impossible due to structural constitutional barriers.

Following this ruling, seven federal states introduced tuition fees of €500 per semester in 2006 and 2007.

Several parties which spoke out for tuition fees lost state elections. Bavaria in 2013 and Lower Saxony in 2014 were the last states to abolish tuition fees.|$|E
40|$|This article {{critically}} {{examines the}} democratic theory that informs the German <b>Federal</b> <b>Constitutional</b> <b>Court’s</b> Lisbon Treaty ruling. This is needed because the ruling is ambiguous {{with regard to}} what democracy for what Union. In order to analyse the ruling we establish three models of what European democracy possibly can amount to: Audit democracy based on the EU as a derivative of the member states, a multinational federal state, or a regional-cosmopolitan polity? The Court’s depiction of the EU does not fit {{as well as we}} should expect with the label derivative entity due to the important legislative role of the European Parliament. EU’s legal supranationalism points {{in the direction of a}} federation, but the Court’s argumentation does not lend support to this notion. The Court models democracy on a rather specific set of institutional presuppositions that are derived from the parliamentary model of democracy associated with the sovereign nation state. At the same time, the Court operates with a conception of a changing state sovereignty that unfolds more in line with cosmopolitan than with classical Westphalian statist principles. democracy; democratization; federalism; German Constitutional Court; legitimacy; supranationalism...|$|R

This paper applies the economic argumentation put forth by the OMT's opponents and supporters before the <b>Federal</b> German <b>Constitutional</b> <b>Court</b> [Bundesverfassungsgericht] to the full allotment policy practiced by the ECB since October 2008. The comparison shows that if the OMT violates the ECB's mandate, the same holds for the full allotment policy. Ultimately, therefore, the ECB is not in court because of monetary financing, but rather as a lender of last resort. Accordingly, a court decision against the OMT would endorse an economic reasoning which contradicts 150 years of modern central bank history and would expose the euro area to the instabilities of financial markets. Such a monetary union is neither sustainable nor desirable...|$|R

In an appeal by a Turkish citizen who practiced Islamic ritual slaughter, the German court struck down Germany's former ban on ritual slaughter, holding that the German Basic Law's guarantee of religious freedom prohibited the German government from applying a law requiring stunning prior to slaughter to observant Muslims who practice ritual slaughter for religious reasons, and that the Basic Law's guarantee of religious freedom applies to slaughterers as well as consumers of meat.|$|E
