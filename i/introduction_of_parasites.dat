40|$|The {{specific}} {{identification of}} broad tapeworms (genus Diphyllobothrium) infecting humans {{is very difficult}} to perform by morphological observation. Molecular analysis by PCR and sequencing represents the only reliable tool to date to identify these parasites to the species level. Due to the recent spread of human diphyllobothriosis in several countries, a correct diagnosis has become crucial to better understand the distribution and the life cycle of human-infecting species as well as to prevent the <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>parasites</b> to disease-free water systems. Nevertheless, PCR and sequencing, although highly precise, are too complicated, long, and expensive to be employed in medical laboratories for routine diagnostics. In the present study we optimized a cheap and rapid molecular test for the differential identification of the most common Diphyllobothrium species infecting humans (D. latum, D. dendriticum, D. nihonkaiense, and D. pacificum), based on a multiplex PCR with the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 gene of mitochondrial DNA.

40|$|Understanding the {{mechanisms}} of drug resistance in Plasmodium vivax, the parasite that causes the most widespread form of human malaria, {{is complicated by the}} lack of a suitable long-term cell culture system for this parasite. In contrast to P. falciparum, which can be more readily manipulated in the laboratory, insights about parasite biology need to be inferred from human studies. Here we analyze the genomes of parasites within 10 human P. vivax infections from the Peruvian Amazon. Using nextgeneration sequencing we show that some P. vivax infections analyzed from the region are likely polyclonal. Despite their polyclonality we observe limited parasite genetic diversity by showing that three or fewer haplotypes comprise 94 % of the examined genomes, suggesting the recent <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>parasites</b> into this geographic region. In contrast we find more than three haplotypes in putative drug-resistance genes, including the gene encoding dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase and the P. vivax multidrug resistance associated transporter, suggesting that resistance mutations have arisen independently. Additionally, several drug-resistance genes are located in genomic regions with evidence of increased copy number.

40|$|Population {{outbreaks}} of house mice (Mus domesticus) occur periodically in the wheatlands of southeastern Australia. This paper uses mathematical models {{to assist in}} the evaluation of the potential of a nematode, Capillaria hepatica, as a biological control agent to reduce the severity of these ‘plagues’. C. hepatica is unique amongst helminths of mammals in that its eggs are released only upon the death of an infected host. The major goal of the modelling in this paper is to determine the impact of this feature on the population dynamics of the host—parasite interaction. Simple differential equation models are used to examine the general properties of the system and determine which population parameters are most crucial to the outcome of the interaction. These models are supplemented by age-structured models which investigate the initial behaviour of the system after <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> the <b>parasite.</b> The necessity <b>of</b> host death for transmission is a strongly destabilizing factor, suggesting that C. hepatica cannot regulate most populations stably in the absence of strong resource limitation, although {{it has the potential to}} depress mouse populations below infection-free levels. Although C. hepatica influences mouse fecundity at lower burdens than it affects mortality, the age-structured models show that parasite-induced host death cannot be neglected. Because transmission requires host death, the parasite life-cycle operates on a time-scale similar to that of the hosts, and <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> the <b>parasite</b> as early as possible in the development period of an outbreak will therefore be necessary to achieve substantial reductions in plague intensity...|$|R
30|$|Of greater concern, however, was the {{collection}} of C. auratus from the Vasse Estuary. Individuals of this species have been caught frequently and in large numbers from the fresh waters of the lower Vasse River since 2003 (Morgan and Beatty 2007), and an acoustic tracking study revealed C. auratus entered the uppermost (i.e. fresh) section of the Vasse Estuary, raising concern over the potential for further downstream colonisation (Beatty et al. 2017). This cyprinid is a benthic herbivore and through its vigorous feeding activities uproots and consumes vegetation, increases turbidity by resuspending sediments and releases nutrients into the water column (Richardson et al. 1995). Furthermore, C. auratus may exacerbate the regular algal blooms that occur in this system, as the growth of cyanobacteria is stimulated by passage through the intestine of this species (Kolmakov and Gladyshev 2003). From a biological perspective, C. auratus is a known vector for the <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>parasites</b> and diseases. For example, it is the likely source of the parasitic copepod Lernaea cyprinacea in Western Australia and responsible for the introduction, establishment and spread of Goldfish Ulcer Disease in Australia, which is caused by variants of the pathogenic bacterium Aeromonas salmonicida (Humphrey and Ashburner 1993; Marina et al. 2008). Therefore, its establishment in other estuarine or riverine habitats of the Vasse-Wonnerup system is of great concern.|$|E
40|$|Increased {{productivity}} due to {{nutrient enrichment}} is hypothesized to affect density-dependent processes, such as transmission success of horizontally transmitting parasites. Changes in nutrient availability can also modify the stoichiometry and condition of individual hosts, which may affect their susceptibility for parasites {{as well as}} the growth conditions for parasites within the host. Consequently, if not balanced by increased host immuno-competence or life history responses, changes in the magnitude of parasite effects with increasing nutrient availability are expected. If these parasite effects are host species specific, this may lead to shifts in the host community structure. We here used the Daphnia-parasite model system to study the effect of nutrient enrichment on parasite-mediated competition in experimental mesocosms.

40|$|Human {{influence}} on the environment has led to changes in ecological factors which have greatly contributed {{to the emergence of}} different infectious diseases. The <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>parasites</b> in a new or changed environment can cause mass mortalities in their hosts. However, the reasons for disease outbreaks caused by pathogens are not quite clear, i. e., whether they are caused by changes in epidemiology or evolution of pathogens or both. One factor that can affect the growth of pathogens is nutrient availability. This effect can be different between virulent and avirulent strains due to the influence the available nutrients have on their growth and virulence. Intensive fish farming has created a nutrient rich environment that may favor the growth of pathogens. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate how different nutrient levels will influence the growth of virulent and avirulent strains of Flavobacterium columnare when grown individually as monocultures or together in competition. This study was based on the hypothesis that virulent strain grows better and outcompetes the avirulent strain when nutrient availability is high. However, due to high nutrient requirements it cannot outcompete avirulent strain when nutrient availability is low. It was shown that in both high and low nutrient availability the virulent strain outcompeted the avirulent strain. In competition, it is possible that the virulent strain can grow at lower concentration of limiting nutrient and outcompete the avirulent strain. The results suggest that virulent strains can grow better than avirulent strains both in natural environment where nutrient level is low or in nutrient rich environment, for example at fish farms...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Recently, human {{intervention}} enabled the <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> Barbus barbus from the Rhône River basin into the Barbus meridionalis habitats of the Argens River. After an introduction event, parasite loss and lower infection {{can be expected}} in non-native hosts in contrast to native species. Still, native species might be endangered by hybridization with the incomer and the <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> novel <b>parasite</b> species. In our study, we aimed to examine metazoan parasite communities in Barbus spp. populations in France, with a special emphasis on the potential threat posed by the <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> novel <b>parasite</b> species by invasive B. barbus to local B. meridionalis. Methods Metazoan parasite communities were examined in B. barbus, B. meridionalis and their hybrids in three river basins in France. Microsatellites {{were used for the}} species identification <b>of</b> individual fish. <b>Parasite</b> abundance, prevalence, and species richness were compared. Effects of different factors on parasite infection levels and species richness were tested using GLM. Results Metazoan parasites followed the expansion range of B. barbus and confirmed its introduction into the Argens River. Here, the significantly lower parasite number and lower levels of infection found in B. barbus in contrast to B. barbus from the Rhône River supports the enemy release hypothesis. Barbus barbus[*]×[*]B. meridionalis hybridization in the Argens River basin was confirmed using both microsatellites and metazoan parasites, as hybrids were infected by <b>parasites</b> <b>of</b> both parental taxa. Trend towards higher parasite diversity in hybrids when compared to parental taxa, and similarity between parasite communities from the Barbus hybrid zone suggest that hybrids might represent “bridges” for parasite infection between B. barbus and B. meridionalis. Risk <b>of</b> <b>parasite</b> transmission from less parasitized B. barbus to more parasitized B. meridionalis indicated from our study in the Argens River might be enhanced in time as higher infection levels in B. barbus from the Rhône River were revealed. Hybrid susceptibility to metazoan parasites varied among the populations and is probably driven by host-parasite interactions and environmental forces. Conclusions Scientific attention should be paid to the threatened status of the endemic B. meridionalis, which is endangered by hybridization with the invasive B. barbus, i. e. by genetic introgression and parasite transmission...|$|R
50|$|Since Pleistrophora {{affects the}} rates of cannibalism, this further {{influences}} the inter- and intraspecies interaction dynamics. The parasite makes G. celticus easier to invade, which in turn causes G. pulex to consume more shrimp upon arrival.

Even though the invaders deplete the population of shrimp, the number <b>of</b> <b>parasites</b> does not decrease. This {{is due to the}} fact that “the mixed ‘feeding frenzies’ that form during cannibalism and intraguild predation (IGP) are likely to promote persistence <b>of</b> the <b>parasite</b> in G. duebeni celticus, even when G. pulex invades.” Thus, the <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> the pleipshora <b>parasite</b> mediates interspecies predation by decreasing the fitness of G. celticus.|$|R

40|$|Apresentação em painelSince the Atlantic Islands and {{the coast}} of West Africa have been {{discovered}} that scientists studied their parasitological fauna, mainly the one associated to serious diseases in man and farm animals, which were unknown in Europe. The Cape Verde Islands and Guinea-Bissau were used as “arrival and departure points” during the portuguese discoveries, which promoted the <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>parasites</b> from other geographical areas or the opposite. On the other hand, {{as they have been}} related during several centuries by historical, religious, geographical and political reasons, the spread out of parasitical agents to the previously uninhabitated islands was the most probable occurrence. Based on available references and on the results obtained from parasitological studies in domestic animals performed during 1991 and 1999, at the Cape Verde Islands and Guinea-Bissau, 65 parasitic species were listed, included in PLATYHELMINTHES (TREMATODA and CESTODA), NEMATODA, INSECTA, ARACHNIDA and PENTASTOMIDA PHYLLA. The parasitological diversity was higher at Guinea-Bissau, with 55 species, than at Cape Verde Islands, with 30, from which six species were not found at Guinea-Bissau. Considering the overall species identified, 22 (33, 84 %) are of afrotropical origin and all the remaining are cosmopolite (61, 54 %) and pantropical (4, 62 %), revealing the scarcity of afrotropical species in the islands, only 4 (6, 15 %). As the majority of species were of cosmopolitan origin, they could have been introduced by domestic animal migrations connected to species evolution or more recently by maritime traffic from all over the world. On the other hand, the obtained differences express the dissimilarity in bio and climatic conditions between a continental area with a regular rainy season and an insular area where the irregularity of the rainy season restricts the diversity of the parasitological fauna...|$|E
40|$|Lionfish (Pterois volitans and Pterois miles) are {{the first}} {{recorded}} invasive piscivore in the Caribbean and have become a threat to native species. As generalist consumers, lionfish have a broad diet and reduce prey and competitor abundance and juvenile recruitment. To confront this problem, this paper serves to review all of the current and alternative future controls available to manage lionfish populations in the Western Atlantic and determine where focus is lacking. Derby and cull efforts are the only management efforts in place and are not effective in their current state as these local events have short-term benefits, but lionfish populations recover quickly. Alternative strategies to culls {{include the use of}} biological controls and genetic engineering. Both strategies have their associated risks and ethical concerns, but may provide significant levels of control. Biological control agents include the <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>parasites</b> or disease from their native range that specifically target lionfish or the recovery and conditioning of natural Western Atlantic predators to consume lionfish. Genetic modification is gaining public acceptance for use against pest species and therefore, if made as safe as possible, could provide some of the best results for controlling lionfish. Quantitative analysis of derby and cull data revealed that focus is lacking in key locations throughout the Western Atlantic such as Cuba and the Meso-American Barrier Reef. The vast majority of derbies were located along the U. S. Eastern and Gulf coast. However, lionfish controls must implement in regions of the greatest larval connectivity {{to reduce the amount of}} larval recruitment and subsequent recovery of adult populations after local removals. Monthly, basin-wide removals of 20 % lionfish biomass were determined to be the most effective strategy, reducing lionfish biomass to near-zero levels in only 36 months. Therefore, to effectively reduce lionfish biomass in the Western Atlantic, an international strategy is needed to produce management efforts in all regions simultaneously...|$|E

Most of the trees of above 30 cm DBH were found to be low invasion. All the shrub species in invaded area were highly smothered and only some herbs like Ageratum conizoides, Aquisetum debile, Eragrostis unioloides, Diplazium esculentum and Tectoria macrodonta were observed to be exposed. Coevolved rust pathogen, Puccinia spegazzini has been reported to be able to control the weed. Managing grassland, the intensive and extensive production of NTFP in community forest, cutting of nutrients and moisture for climber and mulching on creeper <b>of</b> Mikania and <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>parasite</b> plant like Cuscuta reflexa have shown as appropriate measure to keep up the weed in acceptable level...|$|R
40|$|<b>Introductions</b> <b>of</b> {{freshwater}} fish into French rivers {{have been carried}} out with increasing frequency in the last decades. Thus, the potential impact <b>of</b> these <b>introductions</b> is <b>of</b> major concern for biologists and fishery managers. Knowledge of the degree of saturation of a community provides an important basis for understanding how the community reacts or will react to the <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> new species. In this paper, we compare local and regional {{freshwater fish}} species richness in similar sizes tributaries and coastal rivers located in the same biogeographic region (North-Western France). We show 1) that species richness is greater for tributaries than for coastal rivers on both local (station) and regional (catchment) scales, and 2) that, whatever the rivers studied (tributaries or coastal rivers), there is a significant, positive linear relationship between local species richness and regional species richness. These findings suggest that local, and probably regional, freshwater fish communities in North-Western French rivers are unsaturated and thus, that major impacts on the community, such as short-term extinctions, are not to be expected. However, competition for food and space, predation, <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> exotic <b>parasites</b> and diseases, could also affect some native species...|$|R
40|$|The malaria parasite, Plasmodium, is one <b>of</b> {{the oldest}} <b>parasites</b> {{documented}} to infect humans and has proven particularly hard to eradicate. One {{of the major}} hurdles in designing an effective subunit vaccine against the malaria parasite is the insufficient understanding of host–parasite interactions within the human host during infections. The success <b>of</b> the <b>parasite</b> lies {{in its ability to}} evade the human immune system and recruit host responses as physiological cues to regulate its life cycle, leading to rapid acclimatization <b>of</b> the <b>parasite</b> to its immediate host environment. Hence understanding the environmental niche <b>of</b> the <b>parasite</b> is crucial in developing strategies to combat this deadly infectious disease. It has been increasingly recognized that interactions between parasite proteins and host factors are essential to establishing infection and virulence at every stage <b>of</b> the <b>parasite</b> life cycle. This review reassesses all of these interactions and discusses their clinical importance in designing therapeutic approaches such as design of novel vaccines. The interactions have been followed from the initial stages <b>of</b> <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> the <b>parasite</b> under the human dermis until asexual and sexual blood stages which are essential for transmission of malaria. We further classify the interactions as “direct” or “indirect” depending upon their demonstrated ability to mediate direct physical interactions <b>of</b> the <b>parasite</b> with host factors or their indirect manipulation of the host immune system since both forms of interactions are known to have a crucial role during infections. We also discuss the many ways in which this understanding has been taken to the field and the success of these strategies in controlling human malaria...|$|R
40|$|Bees {{naturally}} {{suffer from}} a broad range <b>of</b> <b>parasites,</b> including mites, protozoans, bacteria, fungi and viruses. Some appear to be host-specific, but most appear able to infect multiple bee species, and some are found in insects outside of the Hymenoptera. The host range, natural geographic range and virulence in different hosts are poorly understood for most bee <b>parasites.</b> It is <b>of</b> considerable concern that the anthropogenic movement of bees species for crop pollination purposes {{has led to the}} accidental <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> bee <b>parasites</b> to countries and continents where they do not naturally occur, exposing native bees to parasites against which they may have little resistance. In at least one instance, that of the South American bumble bee Bombus dahlbomii, this has led to a catastrophic population collapse. The main bees that are moved by man are the western honeybee, Apis mellifera, and two species of bumble bee, the European Bombus terrestris and the North American B. impatiens. We propose a range of mitigation strategies that could greatly reduce the risk of further impacts of the commercial bee trade on global bee health, including stricter controls on international movement of bees and improved hygiene and <b>parasite</b> screening <b>of</b> colonies before and after shipping...|$|R
40|$|Populations {{of animals}} which {{live in the}} wild are {{regulated}} by many biotic and abiotic factors. <b>Parasites</b> are one <b>of</b> the biotic factors. Parasites may influence their hosts in different ways. They may cause {{the death of the}} host due to a direct lethal effect or an indirect effect. Direct lethal effects may occur if killing {{is a part of the}} life cycle <b>of</b> the <b>parasite</b> or if hosts and parasites have not developed an equilibrium. The <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> hosts or <b>parasites</b> into a new environment with suitable hosts or parasites is an example. Death by parasitism may also be caused by a combination of the emaciating effects <b>of</b> <b>parasites</b> combined with factors such as bad weather conditions, environmental pollution or human handling. Parasites may also influence the behaviour of their hosts. If the hosts are intermediate hosts in the life cycle <b>of</b> the <b>parasites,</b> the alterations in behaviour may make them an easier prey for their predators, the final hosts. Parasites may also influence the reproductive success of the hosts. In this respect the relationship between the red grouse (Lagopus lagopus scoticus) and the caecal nematode Trichostrongylus tenuis has been well worked out...|$|R
