40|$|Agricultural growth {{offers a}} {{potentially}} {{powerful tool for}} spearheading broad-based poverty reduction in Africa. In a continent where 70 percent of the poor work in agriculture, an upsurge in farm productivity contributes directly to broad increases in rural income. In addition, a prosperous agriculture generates powerful growth linkages {{to the rest of}} the economy, providing cheap food, raw materials, and a growing demand for nascent processing and service industries. Even the urban poor, who spend the majority of their income on food, see their real incomes rise when growing agricultural productivity and output enable reduc-tions in staple food prices. Consequently, growing agricultural productivity attacks poverty from three different directions. It increases the productivity and incomes of the majority of Africa’s poor, who work primarily in agriculture. It reduces food prices, which govern real incomes and poverty in urban areas, and generates <b>important</b> <b>spill-overs</b> {{to the rest of the}} economy. BriefNon-PRIFPRI...|$|R
30|$|This paper {{examines}} how “green” investors can induce firms {{to invest in}} clean production technology. The 1 -period model incorporates heterogeneous agents — Markowitz investors and green investors — and two groups of firms working either with clean or polluting technology. Since green investors apply exclusionary environmental screens, some firms will invest in abatement technology in order {{to switch to a}} clean technology and thereby raising firm value. The number of firms working with clean technology will be larger, the higher the proportion of green investors, the lower costs of abatement technology, the higher diversification benefits of stocks of clean firms and if positive <b>spill-overs</b> <b>for</b> clean firms exist.|$|R
40|$|The paper empirically investigates whether people's {{attitude}} towards the progress in political transformation in Eastern Europe are influenced by economic factors. Thereby it addresses the question of independence between economic and political system. Using a large panel data set, containing about 68000 observations on individuals from 19 countries over 6 years, this question is analyzed {{in the framework of}} an appropriately adjusted ordered logit model. It is found that both subjective and objective personal economic experiences, such as the development of the financial situation of the household or its position in the income distribution, as well as objective aggregate data, such as inflation or the private sector share, have a significant influence on people's opinion with respect to progress in democratization. Thus, studies on transition countries should take into account that there appear to be <b>important</b> <b>spill-overs</b> from people's economic experience to their assessment of progress in transforming the political system.

40|$|The sector {{business}} services contributes {{directly and indirectly}} to aggregate economic growth in Europe. The direct contribution comes from the sector’s own dynamism. Though the business-services industry appears to be characterised by strong cyclical volatility, {{there was also a}} strong structural growth. Business services actually generated more than half of total net employment growth in the European Union since {{the second half of the}} 1990 s. Apart from this direct growth contribution, the sector also contributed in an indirect way to economic growth by generating knowledge and productivity <b>spill-overs</b> <b>for</b> other industries. The knowledge role of {{business services}} is reflected in its employment characteristics. The business-services industry created spill-overs in three ways: original innovations, knowledge diffusion, and the reduction of human capital indivisibilities at firm level. The share of knowledge-intensive business services in the intermediate inputs of the total economy has risen sharply in the last decade. Firm-level scale diseconomies with regard to knowledge and skill inputs are reduced by externa...|$|R
40|$|Before the {{introduction}} of the Euro many observers had expected an increase of inflationary pressures due to a de-coordination-shock to national wage bargaining. However, if anything systematically happened after {{the introduction}} of the Euro wage restraint increased (Posen and Gould 2006). A possible explanation for this finding is that a system of pattern bargaining has emerged with Germany figuring as a "centre of gravity" for European wage bargains (Traxler et al. 2008, Traxler and Brandl 2009). This paper studies wage and nominal unit labour cost <b>spill-overs</b> <b>for</b> the EMU for a panel over 13 manufacturing sectors from 1992 - 2005 and quantifies the effects of different countries. It turns out that there are strong interdependencies across EMU-members with regard to nominal wage growth. Indeed, a leading role accrues to Germany whose wage developments are twice as influential as those of the next important countries. Remarkably, the strong interdependence of wage growth is not reflected with regard to unit labour costs. Here, only the development in a core group composed of Austria, France, Germany and the Netherlands, is bound to each other. The development of nominal unit labour costs in other countries is largely independent from each other and especially from this core group.

40|$|Recent {{studies of}} border effects {{have focused on}} the intra-country and inter-country {{comparison}} of trade flows. It is found that borders {{have a negative impact on}} the size of cross-border trade. In order to estimate border effects on a regional level one needs not only data on inter-country but also on intra-country trade. For many countries (regional) data on intra-country trade are simply lacking, which makes an analysis of border effects and border regions cumbersome. In this paper we take a different approach to measure the impact of borders. We estimate a market potential function for German regional wages and by analysing whether German border regions can be distinguished from the other regions in terms of their wages. We use a market potential function because its basic idea (regional wages fall the further one moves away from economic centers) can be grounded on different trade theories and also because the resulting wage equation is related to border effect studies based on trade flows. We use a data set for 441 German districts for the years 1992 and 1995. In general, we find some evidence that is consistent with the existence of border effects but this evidence is probably better looked upon as an indication of a strong localisation of demand spillovers on regional wages in general. Even though border effects can not be ruled out, the overriding outcome is that of a strong localization of demand <b>spill-overs</b> <b>for</b> all German regions. economic geography, empirical estimation, Germany, International Relations/Trade, Labor and Human Capital, R 10, R 12, R 23,...|$|R
