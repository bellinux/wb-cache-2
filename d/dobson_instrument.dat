For the twilight months of March and September when <b>Dobson</b> <b>instrument</b> observations cannot {{be made at}} South Pole, total ozone amounts were deduced from the ECC ozonesonde soundings.

40|$|The primary {{ground-based}} instruments used {{to report}} total column ozone (TOC) are Brewer and Dobson spectrophotometers in separate networks. These instruments make {{measurements of the}} UV irradiances, and through a well-defined process, a TOC value is produced. Inherent to the algorithm {{is the use of}} a laboratory-determined cross-section data set. We used five ozone cross-section data sets: three data sets that are based on measurements of Bass and Paur; one derived from Daumont, Brion and Malicet (DBM); and a new set determined by Institute of Experimental Physics (IUP), University of Bremen. The three Bass and Paur (1985) sets are as follows: quadratic temperature coefficients from the IGACO (a glossary is provided in Appendix A) web page (IGQ 4), the Brewer network operational calibration set (BOp), and the set used by Bernhard et al. (2005) in the reanalysis of the Dobson absorption coefficient values (B 05). The ozone absorption coefficients for Brewer and <b>Dobson</b> <b>instruments</b> are then calculated using the normal Brewer operative method, which is essentially the same as that used for <b>Dobson</b> <b>instruments.</b> Considering the standard TOC algorithm for the Brewer instruments and comparing to the Brewer standard operational calibration data set, using the slit functions for the individual instruments, we find the IUP data set changes the calculated TOC by − 0. 5 %, the DBM data set changes the calculated TOC by − 3. 2 %, and the IGQ 4 data set at − 45 °C changes the calculated TOC by + 1. 3 %. Considering the standard algorithm for the <b>Dobson</b> <b>instruments,</b> and comparing to results using the official 1992 ozone absorption coefficients values and the single set of slit functions defined for all <b>Dobson</b> <b>instruments,</b> the calculated TOC changes by + 1 %, with little variation depending on which data set is used. We applied the changes to the European Dobson and Brewer reference instruments during the Izaña 2012 Absolute Calibration Campaign. With the application of a common Langley calibration and the IUP cross section, the differences between Brewer and Dobson data sets vanish, whereas using those of Bass and Paur and DBM produces differences of 1. 5 and 2 %, respectively. A study of the temperature dependence of these cross-section data sets is presented using the Arosa, Switzerland, total ozone record of 2003 – 2006, obtained from two Brewer-type instruments and one Dobson-type instrument, combined with the stratospheric ozone and temperature profiles from the Payerne soundings in the same period. The seasonal dependence {{of the differences between the}} results from the various instruments is greatly reduced with the application of temperature-dependent absorption coefficients, with the greatest reduction obtained using the IUP data set...|$|R

Approximately 75 % of the total ozone measurements are made with <b>Dobson</b> <b>instruments</b> which offer the best international measurements. When well calibrated their accuracy is {{on the order of}} a few percent.

40|$|The Dobson ozone {{spectrophotometer}} measures {{the difference of}} intensity between selected wavelengths in the ultraviolet. The method uses an optical attenuator (the 'Wedge') in this measurement. The knowledge {{of the relationship of}} the wedge position to the attenuation is critical to the correct calculation of ozone from the measurement. The procedure to determine this relationship is time-consuming, and requires a highly skilled person to perform it correctly. The relationship has been found to change with time. For reliable ozone values, the procedure should be done on a <b>Dobson</b> <b>instrument</b> at regular intervals. Due to the skill and time necessary to perform this procedure, many instruments have gone as long as 15 years between procedures. This article describes an apparatus that performs the procedure under computer control, and is adaptable to the majority of existing Dobson instruments.

40|$|The {{importance}} of ozone in the chemistry and the radiative {{balance of the}} atmosphere is well established. Several ground and satellite based methods are available for measuring total column or the vertical distribution of ozone. The most common ground based instruments that measure ozone are the Dobson and the Brewer instruments, while ozone sondes measure vertical distribution of ozone. There are six <b>Dobson</b> <b>instruments</b> located in Australia, and ozone sondes are launched from one location (Laverton, Victoria). Solar atmospheric spectroscopy is an established technique to measure the total column amounts of trace atmospheric gases and aerosols. Ozone has a rich spectrum extending from the far ultraviolet to the microwave region. At Wollongong University a high resolution Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (HR-FTIR), a diode array ultraviolet spectrometer and a diode array visible spectrometer have been coupled to the same solar tracker to ensure all three instruments are viewing the same atmospheric column. One aim of this thesis {{is to develop a}} rugged, reliable inexpensive solar ultraviolet and visible spectrometer system, suitable to determine total column atmospheric ozone, based on the diode array spectrometer. The shape of the absorption features of the infrared spectrum is influenced by the temperature and pressure environment of the absorbing molecule, and therefore potentially contains information on the vertical distribution of the absorbing molecule. In contrast, in the ultraviolet and visible regions of the spectrum, the environment of the absorbing molecules has limited influence on the shape of the absorption features, and there is greater potential for retrieving accurate total column atmospheric ozone. The thesis also aims to develop the techniques required to determine total column atmospheric ozone from ground based solar high resolution FTIR, and to assess if the complementary information available from solar infrared, ultraviolet and visible spectra can be used to determine some vertical information on atmospheric ozone. The analysis algorithm requires some prior knowledge of the pressure-temperature and ozone vertical profile.

40|$|Concurrent {{measurements}} were taken using the Brewer spectrometer no. 30, the filter ozonometer M 124 no. 200 and the Dobson spectrophotometer no. 71 from September 1987 to December 1988 at Potsdam. The {{performance of the}} instrument types and the compatibility of ozone data was checked under the conditions of a field measuring station. Total ozone values derived from Dobson AD direct sun {{measurements were}} considered as standard. The <b>Dobson</b> <b>instrument</b> had been calibrated at intercomparisons with the World Standard <b>Dobson</b> <b>instrument</b> no. 83 (Boulder) and with the Regional Standard instrument no. 64 (Potsdam), while the Brewer instrument was calibrated several times with the Travelling Standard Brewer no. 17 (Canada). The differences between individual Brewer DS (direct sun) ozone data and Dobson ADDS are within plus or minus 3 percent with half of all differences within plus or minus 1 percent. Less than 0. 7 percent of the systematic difference can be due to atmospheric SO 2. Due to inadequate regression coefficients Brewer ZB (zenith blue) ozone measurements are by (3 [...] . 4) percent higher than Dobson ADDS ozone values. M 124 DS ozone data are systematically by (1 [...] . 2) percent higher than Dobson ADDS ozone with 50 percent of the differences within plus or minus 4 percent, but with extreme differences up to plus or minus (20 [...] . 25) percent. M 124 ZB ozone values are by (3 [...] . 5) percent higher than Dobson ADDS with all the differences within plus or minus 10 percent, i. e. the scatter of differences is smaller for ZB than for M 124 DS measurements, Results for differences in the daily mean ozone values are also addressed.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is {{determine}} the extent of closure between measurements and models of UV irradiances at diverse sites using state of the art instruments, models, and the best available data as inputs to the models. These include information about aerosol optical depth (unfortunately not extending down as far into the UVB region as desirable because such information is not generally available), ozone column amounts, as well as vertical profiles of ozone and temperature. We concentrate on clear-sky irradiances, and report the results in terms of UV Index (UVI). Clear-sky data from one year of measurements at each of four diverse sites (Lauder &ndash; New Zealand, Mauna Loa Observatory &ndash; Hawaii, Boulder &ndash; Colorado, and Melbourne &ndash; Australia) have been analysed in detail, also taking account of different measurements of ozone, including satellite-derived values, as well as ground measured values, both from <b>Dobson</b> <b>instruments</b> and as retrieved from the UV spectra under study. Previous studies have generally focussed on data from a single site, and for shorter periods. Consequently, this study is the most comprehensive of its kind to date. At Lauder, which is the cleanest low altitude site, we obtained agreement between measurement and model at 5 % level, which is consistent with the best agreement found previously. At Mauna Loa Observatory, similar agreement was achieved, but model calculations need to allow for reflections from cloud that are present below the observatory. At this site, there are occasional problems with using satellite-derived ozone. At Boulder, mean agreements were similar but the dispersion around the mean was slightly larger, corresponding to larger uncertainties in the aerosol inputs to the model. However, at Melbourne, which is the only non-NDACC (Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change) site, there remain unexplained discrepancies. The measured values are significantly lower than the calculated values. We investigate the extent to which this discrepancy can be explained by incomplete knowledge of aerosol extinctions in the UV at this site. We conclude that further information about aerosol optical depth and single scattering albedo in the UVB region is needed to resolve the issues. At the three NDACC sites, the closure provided by the study gives confidence in both the measurements and our ability to model them. The study revealed a limitation in the use of PTFE diffusers when temperatures are lower than approximately 20 &deg;C. It also documents the range of clear sky UVI values expected at these diverse sites...|$|R

Total ozone column observations – based on the GOME-type Direct Fitting version 3 algorithm – from GOME (Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment), SCIAMACHY (SCanning Imaging Absorption SpectroMeter for Atmospheric CHartographY), and GOME- 2 have been combined into one homogeneous time series, thereby taking advantage of the high inter-sensor consistency. The data record spans the 15 -year period from March 1996 to June 2011 and it contains global monthly mean total ozone columns on a 1 °x 1 ° grid. Geophysical ground-based validation using Brewer, <b>Dobson,</b> and UV–visible <b>instruments</b> has shown that the GTO-ECV level 3 data record is of the same high quality as the equivalent individual level 2 data products that constitute it. Both absolute agreement and long-term stability are excellent with respect to the ground-based data, for almost all latitudes apart from a few outliers which are mostly due to sampling differences between the level 2 and level 3 data. We conclude that the GTO-ECV data record is valuable for a variety of climate applications such as the long-term monitoring of the past evolution of the ozone layer, trend analysis and the evaluation of chemistry–climate model simulations...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. MICROTOPS II is a five-channel, {{handheld}} Sun photometer {{that can}} be configured to measure total ozone, total water vapor, or aerosol optical thickness at various wavelengths. The instrument measures 10 3 20 3 4. 3 cm and weighs 600 g. A principal design goal was the measurement of total ozone to within 1 % of ozone measurements made by much larger, heavier, and more expensive Dobson and Brewer spectrophotometers. This goal has been met for a maximum air mass of up to; 2. 5, as demonstrated by comparisons of MICROTOPS II and its immediate predecessor, Supertops, with <b>Dobson</b> and Brewer <b>instruments</b> at various locations. Conventional interference filters are subject to gradual and unpredictable degradation. MICROTOPS II avoids these problems by using highly stable ultraviolet filters manufactured with an ion deposition process. The 2. 4 nm (FWHM) band pass of the UV filters was selected to balance noise and ozone measurement performance. The optical collimators and electronics of the instrument were carefully designed to optimize pointing accuracy, stray light rejection, thermal and long-term stability, signal-to-noise ratio, and data analysis. An internal microcomputer automatically calculates the total ozone column based on measurements at three UV wavelengths, the site’s geographic coordinates, and universal time, altitude, and pressure. The coordinates can be entered manually or by a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver. A built-in pressure transducer automatically measures pressure. MICROTOPS II saves in nonvolatile memory up to 800 scans of the raw and calculated data. Measurements can be read from a liquid crystal display or transferred to an external computer. 1...|$|R

Global ozone in 1992 is at least 1. 5 percent lower than would be predicted by a statistical model that includes a linear trend and accounts for solar cycle variation and the quasi-biennial oscillation. These results are confirmed by comparisons with data from other ozone monitoring instruments: the SBUV/ 2 instrument on the NOAA- 11 satellite, the TOMS instrument on the Russian Meteor- 3 satellite, the World Standard <b>Dobson</b> <b>Instrument</b> 83, and a collection of 22 ground-based Dobson instruments...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} key {{results achieved}} by {{an analysis of}} the relation between high-quality simultaneous Dobson, Brewer ground and TOMS-V 8, GOME-WFDOAS satellite total ozone observations for Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic. Statistically significant seasonal differences with maxima up to 4 % of monthly averages have been found between Dobson and Brewer measurements during the winter/spring months. These differences can influence estimations of ozone trends if combined data series are used after replacing a <b>Dobson</b> <b>instrument</b> by a Brewer spectrophotometer. The differences can be attributed mostly to the influence of temperature on ozone absorption coefficients and to total sulphur dioxide. Similar seasonal differences exist between Dobson, GOME and Brewer, TOMS data sets at Hradec Kralove while Dobson versus TOMS and Brewer versus GOME observations fit well with each other within the instrumental accuracy of spectrophotometers. The above findings are supposed to be relevant to other mid and high latitude stations and they have been confirmed by several independent analyses. The conclusions should be considered by data users because the differences between particular ground and satellite data sets can influence validation of satellite ozone observing systems and analyses of recovery of the ozone layer in mid and high latitudes, among others...|$|E
40|$|Comparisons {{of total}} column ozone {{measurements}} from Dobson, Brewer and SAOZ instruments are presented {{for the period}} 1990 to 1995 at seven stations covering the mid- and the high northern latitudes, {{as well as the}} Antarctic region. The main purpose of these comparisons is to assess, by reference to the well established Dobson network, the accuracy of the zenith-sky visible spectroscopy for the measurement of total ozone. The strengths and present limitations of this latter technique are investigated. As a general result, the different instruments are found to agree within a few percent at all stations, the best agreement being obtained at mid-latitudes. On average, for the mid-latitudes, SAOZ O 3 measurements are approximately 2 % higher than Dobson ones, with a scatter of about 5 %. At higher latitudes, both scatter and systematic deviation tend to increase. In all cases, the relative differences between SAOZ and Dobson or Brewer column ozone are characterised by a significant seasonal signal, the amplitude of which increases from about 2. 5 % at mid-latitude to a maximum of 7. 5 % at Faraday, Antarctica. Although it introduces a significant contribution to the seasonality at high latitude, the temperature sensitivity of the O 3 absorption coefficients of the <b>Dobson</b> and Brewer <b>instruments</b> is shown to be too small to account for the observed SAOZ/Dobson differences. Except for Faraday, these differences can however be largely reduced if SAOZ AMFs are calculated with realistic climatological profiles of ozone, pressure and temperature. Other sources of uncertainties that might affect the comparison are investigated. Evidence is found that the differences in the air masses sampled by the SAOZ and the other instruments contribute significantly to the scatter, and the impact of the tropospheric clouds on SAOZ measurements is displaye...|$|R

Vertical ozone profiles measured in Dobson units (DU) are currently retrieved based on laboratory measurements of the ozone absorption cross-section spectrum between 270 and 400 nm published in 1985 by Bass and Paur (BP). Recently, the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the European Space Agency (ESA) proposed using the set of ozone cross-section measurements made at the Daumont laboratory in 1992 (BDM) for revising the Aura Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME) satellite ozone profiles and total ozone column retrievals.

It is currently used for all Dobson Umkehr data processing submitted to the World Ozone and Ultraviolet radiation Data Centre (WOUDC) under the Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) program of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). Ozone profiles are also retrieved from measurements by the Mark IV Brewers operated by the NOAA-EPA Brewer Spectrophotometer UV and Ozone Network (NEUBrew) using a modified UMK 04 algorithm (O 3 BUmkehr v. 2. 6, Martin Stanek).

40|$|International audienceAccurate {{long-term}} {{monitoring of}} total ozone {{is one of}} the most important requirements for identifying possible natural or anthropogenic changes in the composition of the stratosphere. For this purpose, the NDACC (Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change) UV-visible Working Group has made recommendations for improving and homogenizing the retrieval of total ozone columns from twilight zenith-sky visible spectrometers. These instruments, deployed all over the world in about 35 stations, allow measurements of total ozone twice daily with little sensitivity to stratospheric temperature and cloud cover. The NDACC recommendations address both the DOAS retrieval parameters and the calculation of air mass factors (AMF) needed for the conversion of O 3 slant column densities into vertical column amounts. The most important improvement is the use of O 3 AMF look-up tables calculated using the TOMS V 8 O 3 profile climatology, that allows accounting for the dependence of the O 3 AMF on the seasonal and latitudinal variations of the O 3 vertical distribution. To investigate their impact on the retrieved ozone columns, the recommendations have been applied to measurements from the NDACC/SAOZ (Système d'Analyse par Observation Zénithale) network. The revised SAOZ ozone data from eight stations covering all latitude regions have been compared to TOMS, GOME-GDP 4, SCIAMACHY-TOSOMI, OMI-TOMS, and OMI-DOAS satellite overpass observations, as well as to those of collocated <b>Dobson</b> and Brewer <b>instruments.</b> A significant improvement is obtained after applying the new O 3 AMFs, although systematic seasonal differences between SAOZ and all other instruments remain. These are shown to mainly originate from i) the temperature dependence of the ozone absorption cross sections in the UV being not or improperly corrected by some retrieval algorithms, and ii) the longitudinal differences in tropospheric ozone column being ignored by zonal climatologies. For those measurements sensitive to stratospheric temperature like TOMS, OMI-TOMS, Dobson and Brewer, the application of a temperature correction results in the almost complete removal of the seasonal difference with SAOZ, improving significantly the consistency between all ground-based and satellite total ozone observations...|$|R
40|$|The {{stability}} of the calibration of the Nimbus 7 solar backscatter UV (SBUV) and {{total ozone mapping spectrometer}} (TOMS) instruments by comparing their ozone measurements with those made by a single, very stable Dobson instrument: the world primary standard Dobson spectrometer number 83. Measurements of ozone made with instrument 83 at Mauna Loa observatory in eight summers between 1979 and 1989 were compared with coincident TOMS ozone measurements. The comparison shows that relative to instrument 83, ozone measured by TOMS (and SBUV) was stable between 1979 and approximately 1983, had decreased by 3 percent by 1986, and had decreased by almost 7 percent by 1989. A similar time dependence is seen when data from an ensemble of 39 Dobson stations throughout the world is compared with TOMS over the period 1979 - 1987. The most likely reason for the relative drift is that the diffuser plate used by both SBUV and TOMS to measure solar flux has suffered an uncorrected wavelength-dependent degradation, with most of the degradation occurring after 1983. The recently released version 6 TOMS data, corrected using the internal 'pair justification' technique, show almost no drift relative to <b>Dobson</b> <b>instrument</b> 83. Accurate measurements of long-term global ozone change will require a coherent system incorporating both ground-based and satellite-based ozone measurements...|$|E
40|$|Total {{ozone data}} {{obtained}} with a <b>Dobson</b> <b>instrument</b> at Syowa Station are compared with Nimbus 7 Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) version 6 data for 1979 through March 1988. Generally speaking TOMS data show larger {{values of a}} few percent compared with Dobson data. Monthly averaged differences demonstrate a clear seasonal variation of summer maximum. This behavior {{was the same as}} my previous work in which Dobson data were compared with TOMS version 5 data over Syowa Station. My previous work also revealed a long term trend of difference due to TOMS version 5 data which have been affected by the deterioration of the diffuser plate attached to the TOMS instrument. No such long term trend is recognized in the present result which shows the superiority of the new calibration method adopted in the TOMS version 6 data analysis. However, the clear seasonal variation of difference between Dobson total ozone data and new version of TOMS data suggests a problem which may inherently exist in the TOMS data or Dobson data. This problem should be further examined. As for absolute value, as mentioned above, mean TOMS version 6 data are larger than Dobson data by several percent. This difference is larger than that of TOMS version 5...|$|E
40|$|In this study, we {{investigated}} the susceptibility of the Dobson spectrophotometer No. 118 to stray light interference. In this regard, {{a series of}} total ozone content measurements were carried out in Athens, Greece for air-mass values (μ) extending up to μ = 5. The monochromatic-heterochromatic stray light derived by Basher's model was used in order to evaluate the specific instrumental parameters which determine if this instrument suffers from this problem or not. The results obtained indicate that the measurements made by the <b>Dobson</b> <b>instrument</b> of the Athens station for air mass values up to 2. 5, underestimates the total ozone content by 3. 5 DU in average, or about 1 % of the station's mean total ozone content (TOC). The comparison {{of the values of}} the same parameters measured 15 years ago with the present ones indicates the good maintenance of the Dobson spectrophotometer No. 118. This fact is of crucial importance because the variability of the daily total ozone observations collected by the Athens Dobson Station since 1989 has proved to be representative to the variability of the mean total ozone observed over the whole mid-latitude zone of the Northern Hemisphere. This stresses the point that the Athens total ozone station, being the unique Dobson station in south-eastern Europe, may be assumed as a ground truth station for the reliable conversion of the satellite radiance observations to total ozone measurements...|$|E
40|$|Total {{ozone data}} {{obtained}} during summers at Mauna Loa Observatory, Hawaii, with Dobson Spectrophotometer 83 are routinely compared with overpass total ozone {{data from the}} Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) and the Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet (SBUV) spectrometer launched aboard the Nimbus 7 satellite in 1978. Results from the TOMS/Dobson instrument comparisons through 1990 have been presented by McPeters and Komhyr (1991). Dobson spectrophotometer 83 was established as the standard instrument for the U. S. A. <b>Dobson</b> <b>instrument</b> station network in 1962. In 1980, the instrument was designated by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) as the Standard Dobson Spectrophotometer for the World. Long-term ozone measurement precision of the instrument has been maintained at plus or minus 0. 5 percent (Komhyr et al., 1989). On an absolute scale, the ozone measurement accuracy of the instrument is estimated to plus or minus 3 percent. In early April, 1990, comparison of total ozone and vertical distribution (Umkehr) observations were made {{for the first time}} with Dobson spectrophotometer 8. 3. The work was conducted at the NOAA Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory (CMDL) in Boulder, Colorado, and at the research and instrument manufacturing facility of the Ball Aerospace System Division located about 2 km east of Boulder. (The SBUV- 2 S/N- 2 instrument, built by Ball Aerospace Systems Division, is scheduled for launch aboard the NOAA- 13 satellite). We present results of the comparisons which include ozone vertical distribution data obtained with a balloon-borne electrochemical concentration cell (ECC) ozonesonde (Komhyr, 1969) ...|$|E
40|$|In {{submitting}} {{data to the}} World Meteorological Organization (WMO) World Ozone and Ultraviolet Data Center (WOUDC), numerous ozonesonde stations {{include a}} correction factor (CF) that multiplies ozone concentration profile data so that the columns computed agree with column measurements from co-located ground-based and/or overpassing satellite instruments. We evaluate this practice through an examination of data from 4 Japanese ozonesonde stations: Kagoshima, Naha, Sapporo, and Tsukuba. While agreement between the sonde columns and Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) or Ozone Mapping Instrument (OMI) is improved by use of the CF, agreement between the sonde ozone concentrations reported near the surface and data from surface monitors near the launch sites is negatively impacted. In addition, the agreement between the mean sonde columns without the CF and the ground-based <b>Dobson</b> <b>instrument</b> columns is improved by ~ 1. 5 % by using the McPeters et al. (1997) balloon burst climatology rather than the constant mixing ratio assumption for the above burst height column estimate. Limited comparisons of coincident ozonesonde profiles from Hokkaido University {{with those in the}} WOUDC database suggest that while the application of the CFs in the stratosphere improves agreement, it negatively impacts the agreement in the troposphere. Finally, unexplained trends and changing trends in the CFs appear over the last 20 yr. The overall trend in the CFs for the four Japanese ozonesonde stations from 1990 – 2010 is (&minus; 0. 157 &plusmn; 0. 032) &times; 10 &minus; 2 yr− 1 ; but from 1993 – 1999 the trend is (&minus; 2. 21 &plusmn; 0. 14) &times; 10 − 2 yr− 1 and from 1999 – 2009 is (1. 180 &plusmn; 0. 059) &times; 10 − 2 yr− 1 , resulting in a statistically significant difference in CF trends between these two periods of (3. 39 &plusmn; 0. 15) &times; 10 − 2 yr− 1 . Given our analysis, we recommend the following: (1) use of the balloon burst climatology is preferred to a constant mixing ratio assumption for determining total column ozone with sonde data; (2) if CFs are applied, their application should probably be restricted to altitudes above the tropopause; (3) only sondes that reach at least 32 km (10. 5 hPa) before bursting should be used in data validation and/or ozone trend studies; and (4) all ozone trend studies employing Japanese sonde data should be revisited after a careful examination {{of the impact of the}} CF on the calculated ozone trends...|$|E
