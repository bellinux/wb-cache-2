5|$|The loss of high {{offices to}} Criollos and the {{eighteenth-century}} revolts in Spanish South America were the direct {{causes of the}} wars of independence, which took place decades later, {{but they have been}} considered <b>important</b> <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> the political background in which the wars took place.|$|E
5|$|<b>Important</b> <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> {{traditional}} Scouting {{have their}} origins in Baden-Powell's experiences {{in education and}} military training. He was a 50-year-old retired army general when he founded Scouting, and his revolutionary ideas inspired thousands of young people, {{from all parts of}} society, to get involved in activities that most had never contemplated. Comparable organizations in the English-speaking world are the Boys' Brigade and the non-militaristic Woodcraft Folk; however, they never matched the development and growth of Scouting.|$|E
5|$|Some {{aspects of}} the mysteries of Isis and of other mystery cults, {{particularly}} their connection with the afterlife, resemble <b>important</b> <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> Christianity. The {{question of whether the}} mysteries influenced Christianity is controversial and the evidence is unclear; some scholars today attribute the similarities to a shared cultural background rather than direct influence. In contrast, Apuleius's account has had direct effects in modern times. Through his description of them, the mysteries of Isis have influenced many works of fiction and modern fraternal organizations, as well as a widespread, though false, belief that the ancient Egyptians themselves had an elaborate system of mystery initiations.|$|E

5|$|A third recension was {{probably}} compiled {{during the reign}} of HenryI and was used at the coronation of his successor, Stephen, in 1135. While retaining the most <b>important</b> <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> the Anglo-Saxon rite, it borrowed heavily from the consecration of the Holy Roman Emperor from the Pontificale Romano-Germanicum, a book of German liturgy compiled in Mainz in 961, thus bringing the English tradition into line with continental practice. It remained in use until the coronation of EdwardII in 1308 when the fourth recension was first used, having been compiled over several preceding decades. Although influenced by its French counterpart, the new ordo focussed on the balance between the monarch and his nobles and on the oath, neither of which concerned the absolutist French kings. One manuscript of this recension is the Liber Regalis at Westminster Abbey which has come to be regarded as the definitive version.|$|E
5|$|By the 19th century, the Barbadian colonialists grew to fear slave revolts, and specifically, the use {{of music}} {{as a tool of}} {{communication}} and planning for revolution. As a result, the government passed laws to restrict musical activities among slaves. At the same time, American and other forms of imported music were brought to Barbados, while many <b>important</b> <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> modern Barbadian music, like tuk bands, also emerged. In the 20th century, many new styles were imported to Barbados, most influentially including jazz, ska, reggae, calypso and soca. Barbados became home to many performers of these new genres, especially soca and calypso, while the island also produced an indigenous style called spouge, which became an important symbol of Barbadian identity.|$|E
5|$|Scotland has an {{extensive}} coastline and vast areas of difficult terrain and poor agricultural land. In this period, more land became marginal due to climate change, resulting in relatively light human settlement, {{particularly in the}} interior and Highlands. Northern Britain lacked urban centres and settlements were based on farmsteads and around fortified positions such as brochs, with mixed-farming primarily based on self-sufficiency. In this period, changes in settlement and colonisation meant that the Pictish and Brythonic languages began to be subsumed by Gaelic, English, and, {{at the end of}} the period, by Old Norse. Life expectancy was relatively low, leading to a young population, with a ruling aristocracy, freemen, and relatively large numbers of slaves. Kingship was multi-layered, with different kings surrounded by their war bands that made up the most <b>important</b> <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> armed forces, and who engaged in both low-level raiding and occasional longer-range, major campaigns.|$|E

5|$|The median plates (m, m') {{are also}} sclerites {{that are not}} so {{definitely}} differentiated as specific plates as are the three principal axillaries, but nevertheless they are <b>important</b> <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> the flexor apparatus. They lie in the median area of the wing base distal to {{the second and third}} axillaries and are separated from each other by an oblique line (bf) which forms a prominent convex fold during flexion of the wing. The proximal plate (m) is usually attached to the distal arm of the third axillary and perhaps should be regarded {{as a part of the}} latter. The distal plate (m') is less constantly present as a distinct sclerite and may be represented by a general sclerotization of the base of the mediocubital field of the wing. When the veins of this region are distinct at their bases, they are associated with the outer median plate.|$|E
5|$|Four British {{transports}} were considered: the Blackburn Beverley, Bristol 179B, Bristol 195 and Short PD 16/1. The mission also {{assessed the}} American Fairchild C-119G Flying Boxcar, Fairchild C-123 Provider and Lockheed C-130A Hercules. Of these types, the mission assessed that the Beverley, C-123 and C-130 could potentially meet the RAAF's requirements. Following further {{consideration of the}} options after their return to Australia, in early 1955 {{the members of the}} mission unanimously recommended that Hercules be procured, as the other two types did not meet some of the most <b>important</b> <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> the requirement. At this time the Australian Government was reluctant to fund any new equipment for the RAAF, and a decision to acquire twelve C-130s was not made until mid-1957. A contract for these aircraft was signed in October that year. The Australian C-130As were to be similar to those in service with the United States Air Force (USAF), the main difference being the use of TF56-A-11 engines in the place of the usual TF56-A-1 and TF56-A-9s; these engines provided almost the same power, but were modified to meet Australian fuel requirements. The total cost for the aircraft, initial crew training and support equipment was $US36 million (equivalent to about 16 million Australian pounds).|$|E
5|$|Love, sex {{and desire}} become <b>important</b> <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> the plot in Sant Singh Sekhon's Punjabi play Kalakar (1945), which places the epic drama {{in the modern}} age. It depicts Ahalya as a free-spirited woman, who dares to be painted nude by Inder (Indra), a pupil of the art professor, Gautama, and defends her {{decision}} against her husband's criticisms. N. S. Madhavan's Malayalam story (April 2006) also retells Ahalya's tale in a modern setting, wherein Ahalya, accused of adultery, is beaten by her husband, leaving her in a coma from which the neurologist, Rama, revives her. The 2015 film Ahalya gives a feminist twist to the tale where the policeman Indra turns into a stone doll, after visiting Ahalya. The tale was also parodied in the Telugu film Attarintiki Daredi. However, the practice of retelling the classical Ahalya–Indra tale in a contemporary setting is not new. The Yoga Vasistha (1001–1400) narrates {{a tale of two}} adulterous lovers, Queen Ahalya and the Brahmin Indra. Here, Ahalya and Indra fall in love and continue their affair, despite being punished by Ahalya's jealous husband. After death, they reunite in their next birth.|$|E

5|$|The UNPROFOR mandate was {{extended}} several times, in increments {{of up to}} six months, with consent {{of the government of}} Croatia. That changed in early 1995, when Croatian President Franjo Tuđman wrote to the Secretary-General of the United Nations informing him that Croatia would not accept further extensions of the mission once it expired on 31 March and asking that UNPROFOR leave Croatia by the end of June. At the time, it was established UN practice to seek consent of the country where its peacekeepers were deployed, and the letter effectively required UNPROFOR to withdraw completely from Croatia. Such action would also require abolishment of the UNPAs, which had been identified as integral parts of Croatia by United Nations Security Council Resolution 815 of 30 March 1993. Two days later, the Secretary-General reported to the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) that UNPROFOR was unable to implement <b>important</b> <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> the Vance plan, enforce a ceasefire, or protect its own vehicles against hijackings in the UNPAs.|$|E

25|$|Guajeos {{are one of}} {{the most}} <b>important</b> <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> the {{vocabulary}} of Afro-Cuban descarga (jazz-inspired instrumental jams), providing a means of tension and resolution and a sense of forward momentum, within a relatively simple harmonic structure. The use of multiple, contrapuntal guajeos in Latin jazz facilitates simultaneous collective improvisation based on theme variation.
