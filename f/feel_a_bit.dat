25|$|A book of {{the show}} has become all but necessary, if only {{to allow us to}} ingest this {{information}} at normal brain speed, and because such fine and creative research genuinely deserves to be captured in print. So it's slightly disappointing that the book arrives in the question-and-answer format made so familiar by last year's big hit Does Anything Eat Wasps? There are actually about 20 such books out this year, all asking these quirky questions (Do Sheep Shrink In The Rain? Do Fish Drink Water?), all piled up in Waterstones, making book-buyers <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> depressed.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the track}} {{was a major}} hit for the band, Dave Davies did not enjoy the success of [...] "Lola", saying, [...] "In fact, when 'Lola' was a hit, it made me <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> uncomfortable. Because it was taking us out of a {{different}} sort of comfort zone, where we'd been getting into the work, and the writing and the musicality was more thought about. It did have that smell of: 'Oh blimey, not that again.' I found it a bit odd, that period. And then it got odder and weirder". Mick Avory said that he [...] "enjoyed the success" [...] the band had with [...] "Lola" [...] and its follow-up, [...] "Apeman".|$|E
500|$|Peter Bright of Ars Technica praised {{many of the}} {{improvements}} on Windows 8.1, such as its more [...] "complete" [...] touch interface, the [...] "reasonable" [...] tutorial content, the new autocomplete tools on the on-screen keyboard, software improvements, and the deep SkyDrive integration. However, {{he felt that the}} transition between the desktop and apps [...] "still tends to <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> disjointed and disconnected" [...] (even though the option to use the desktop wallpaper on the Start screen made it feel more integrated with the desktop interface rather than dissimilar), and that the restoration of the Start button made the two interfaces feel even more inconsistent because of how different it operates between the desktop and apps.|$|E

500|$|The BBC and {{television}} regulatory body Ofcom received 70 complaints after Whitney's first scenes with Tony aired. A BBC spokesman responded: [...] "This {{is a difficult}} and challenging storyline, but one which keeps with {{the tradition of the}} show for tackling difficult social issues such as domestic abuse and mental health in the past. All the content on screen adheres to the BBC's editorial guidelines." [...] The Guardian Aida Edemariam said of the beginning of the storyline: [...] "what is most disturbing, watching [...] first scenes together, is not the sexuality of the situation per se, though that is uncomfortable - it's the subtle blackmail with which he keeps her in line. As it's combined with the emotional manipulation native to soaps, the viewer starts to <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> bullied, too." [...] Numbers of viewer complaints rose within days to over 200. New Statesman journalist Jeremy Sare commented on the public outrage and defended EastEnders decision to air the storyline, writing: ...|$|E
500|$|Poniewozik {{notes that}} [...] "It also remains {{a delight to}} watch Spacey pump the humid breath of life into House of Cards’ arid Capitol chill. If only his {{character}} weren’t so dominant of his surroundings as well. One reason the series’ movements can feel so mechanical is that, so far, no one seems nearly in Underwood’s league: not the adversaries he battles directly, nor the sad sacks that he gulls without their even knowing it." [...] Chuck Barney of the San Jose Mercury News notes that the preview episodes show that [...] "Frank's [...] "Survivor"-like back-stabbing is beginning to <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> repetitive." [...] and that his lack of an adversarial foil has become an issue: [...] "...things always seem to fall neatly into place for him. Even his showdowns with the president (Michel Gill) come off as one-sided..." [...] Verne Gay of Newsday notes that [...] "Frank Underwood has no remorse, no superannuated sense of Washington tradition or decorum, and certainly no second thoughts. He is TV's perfect monster of the moment - a compleat malefactor, with a pleasing honey-toned drawl." ...|$|E
500|$|Professor Layton and the Last Specter {{received}} [...] "favorable" [...] reviews {{according to}} video game review aggregator Metacritic. Many critics noted {{that although the}} game feels similar to past titles, the series had found a working formula and {{did not need to}} change. IGN shared these sentiments, but found that the game had [...] "an added attention to detail that makes the whole game <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> sharper and more magnificent" [...] than its predecessors. The game's puzzles received mixed reception. Reviewers often commented that they felt too similar to puzzles from the other games in the series, and several felt that they tended to be vague or inconsistent in difficulty. Despite this, GamePro felt that the game's puzzles were [...] "more balanced" [...] than those from previous games. The game's cutscenes and visuals were very well received, with GamesRadar describing the cutscenes as [...] "near-Ghibli quality" [...] and IGN saying that [...] "the graphics, which make use of a cartoony yet beautifully detailed, painterly art style, are simply gorgeous." ...|$|E

500|$|Travis Fickett, a {{reviewer}} from IGN, praised {{both the}} {{writing and the}} acting of season 4. When speaking of the season finale [...] "Goodbye Toby", Fickett {{went on to say}} [...] "It's a great episode that ends a great season. There are more than a few questions raised that will have us eagerly tuning in when the show returns in the fall." [...] Aubry D'Arminio praised the season, but she also showed disapproval at what she felt was a lack of use for some of The Offices supporting cast in the episodes directly following the Writers' Strike, saying [...] "I just <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> sad that, minus Leslie David Baker's Stanley, these excellent actors/characters haven't been highlighted nearly enough since the series' return in April." [...] In a comprehensive review of the fourth season DVD, IGN reviewers Travis Fickett and Phil Pirrello both believed [...] "this season {{to be one of the}} show's best, [...] that 14 episodes across four discs gives way to crowding, especially when the season tries to tackle Jim and Pam dating, Angela and Dwight breaking up, Andy and Angela dating by way of awkward silence, Michael and Jan breaking up, Toby leaving the office and a new love interest for Michael joining the cast." [...] Fickett and Pirrello gave the season a total score of 8 out of 10.|$|E
500|$|The Escapist gave Last Specter a {{score of}} four-and-a-half stars out of five, saying, [...] "Another Professor Layton game, another bit of puzzling brilliance. Some of the brain teasers <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> {{recycled}} - instead of foxes and chickens, you're shuttling dogs and cats across the river, for example - but there's more than enough variety to warrant doggedly tracking down every last one. But if you only solve the ones you need to move the story forward, that's ok, too." [...] The Guardian gave it four stars out of five, saying, [...] "If you've not {{been a fan of}} the series, this isn't the game that's going to change your mind. For everybody else though, Professor Layton & The Spectre's Call is several days of commute-improving, grey cell stimulation in a mostly effective package. [...] And bravo to Nintendo for keeping this franchise on the standard DS rather than – for the time being, at least – adding that third dimension." [...] However, The Daily Telegraph gave it two-and-a-half stars out of five, saying, [...] "The Layton charm is undoubtedly still present, but it's not enough to carry the series by itself. Upon solving certain puzzles, Layton exclaims 'I love the thrill of a good solution'. So do we, Hershel, so do we. And in this Layton game, sadly, that thrill is all too rare." ...|$|E
500|$|After Mal and Peter Asher (A head of Apple Records) saw {{the rock}} band the Iveys perform at London's Marquee Club, Mal {{constantly}} {{suggested that the}} Beatles sign the band to Apples label. This eventually happened in July '68 when the Iveys became the first band to be signed to the label. Some of the first Apple recording sessions were produced by Mal and the band eventually changed their name to Badfinger. Evans: [...] "January 13, 1969: Paul [...] is really cutting down on the Apple staff members. I was elevated to office boy [...] and I feel very hurt and sad inside—only big boys don't cry. Why I should feel hurt and reason for writing this is ego. ... I thought I was different from other people in my relationship with The Beatles and being loved by them and treated so nice, I felt {{like one of the}} family. Seems I fetch and carry. I find it difficult to live on the £38 I take home each week and would love to be like their other friends who buy fantastic homes and have all the alterations done by them, and are still going to ask for a rise. I always tell myself—look, everybody wants to take from, be satisfied, try to give and you will receive. After all this time I have about £70 to my name, but was content and happy. Loving them as I do, nothing is too much trouble, because I want to serve them. <b>Feel</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> better now—EGO?" [...] Evans' financial problems started to become such a problem that he had to ask Harrison for money: [...] "April 24: [...] "Had to tell George —'I'm broke'.

[...] Sometimes the remarks, that are given to our town, when a person knows where Winfield is, are far harder to swallow than when he is ignorant of its location. [...] Some of the milder titles are, 'barracks', or 'oh, those places.' We are so tiny, that even state and county cartographers sometimes forget to put us on their maps.

McCartney read the interview and offered the song [...] "Come and Get It" [...] to the group, although he had written the song for the soundtrack of The Magic Christian. Before the recording on Saturday, 2 August 1969, Griffiths remembered the whole group being so excited they couldn't sleep.
