5|$|A {{person with}} Tourette's has about a 50% chance of passing the gene(s) {{to one of}} his or her children, but Tourette's is a {{condition}} of variable expression and <b>incomplete</b> <b>penetrance.</b> Thus, not everyone who inherits the genetic vulnerability will show symptoms; even close family members may show different severities of symptoms, or no symptoms at all. The gene(s) may express as Tourette's, as a milder tic disorder (provisional or chronic tics), or as obsessive–compulsive symptoms without tics. Only a minority of the children who inherit the gene(s) have symptoms severe enough to require medical attention. Gender appears to have a role in the expression of the genetic vulnerability: males are more likely than females to express tics.|$|E
5|$|Most {{cases of}} Alzheimer's disease do not exhibit autosomal-dominant {{inheritance}} and are termed sporadic AD, in which environmental and genetic differences may act as risk factors. The best known genetic risk {{factor is the}} inheritance of the ε4 allele of the apolipoprotein E (APOE). Between 40 and 80% of people with AD possess at least one APOEε4 allele. The APOEε4 allele {{increases the risk of}} the disease by three times in heterozygotes and by 15 times in homozygotes. Like many human diseases, environmental effects and genetic modifiers result in <b>incomplete</b> <b>penetrance.</b> For example, certain Nigerian populations do not show the relationship between dose of APOEε4 and incidence or age-of-onset for Alzheimer's disease seen in other human populations. Early attempts to screen up to 400 candidate genes for association with late-onset sporadic AD (LOAD) resulted in a low yield. More recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have found 19 areas in genes that appear to affect the risk. These genes include: CASS4, CELF1, FERMT2, HLA-DRB5, INPP5D, MEF2C, NME8, PTK2B, SORL1, ZCWPW1, SlC24A4, CLU, PICALM, CR1, BIN1, MS4A, ABCA7, EPHA1, and CD2AP.|$|E

50|$|Beyond {{looking at}} the genes and {{individual}} proteins that {{play a role in}} primary focal hyperhidrosis, researchers have looked at the patterns of heredity for this trait. In a 2003 study, using multiple families, researchers found that primary focal hyperhidrosis was not a sex-linked gene, since male-to-male transmission was seen in multiple families. Instead evidence supported an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance with an <b>incomplete</b> disease <b>penetrance.</b> 21 patients in this study reported a positive family history of hyperhidrosis (62%). Researchers were able to uncover this by creating pedigrees of all the participants in the study. Not every member of the pedigree exhibited forms of hyperhidrosis, which allowed the researchers to track the patterns of inheritance. The findings in this study indicated that primary focal hyperhidrosis is typically an hereditary disorder.|$|R

The genetic diagnosis of CAKUT has proven to be challenging due to genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity and <b>incomplete</b> genetic <b>penetrance.</b> Monogenic causes of CAKUT have been identified using different approaches, including single gene screening, and gene panel and whole exome sequencing. The majority of the identified mutations, however, lack substantial evidence to support a pathogenic role in CAKUT. Copy number variants or single nucleotide variants that are associated with CAKUT have also been identified. Numerous studies support the influence of epigenetic and environmental factors on kidney development and the natural history of CAKUT, suggesting that the pathogenesis of this syndrome is multifactorial. In this Review we describe the current knowledge regarding the genetic susceptibility underlying CAKUT and the approaches used to investigate the genetic basis of CAKUT.

Most cases are sporadic; however, three familial SEDAC cases have been reported, suggesting genetic etiological factors. All familial cases are associated with lymphedema-distichiasis syndrome (LDS), whose causal gene is FOXC 2. However, FOXC 2 mutation analysis has been performed in only 1 family, and no mutation analysis has been performed on sporadic (non-familial) SEDACs. We recruited 17 SEDAC subjects consisting of 2 familial and 7 sporadic cases and examined FOXC 2 mutations by Sanger sequencing and structural abnormalities by TaqMan copy number assay. We identified 2 novel FOXC 2 mutations in 2 familial cases. <b>Incomplete</b> LDS <b>penetrance</b> was noted in both families. Four subjects presented with SEDACs only. Thus, SEDAC caused by the heterozygous FOXC 2 loss-of-function mutation {{should be considered a}} feature of LDS, although it often manifests as the sole symptom. Seven sporadic SEDAC subjects had no FOXC 2 mutations, no symptoms of LDS, and showed differing clinical characteristics from those who had FOXC 2 mutations, suggesting that other gene(s) besides FOXC 2 are likely to be involved in SEDAC...|$|R
40|$|Mendel used hawkweeds {{and other}} plants to verify the laws of {{inheritance}} he discovered using Pisum. Trait segregation was not evident in hawkweeds because many form seeds asexually by apomixis. Meiosis does not occur during female gametophyte formation and the mitotically formed embryo sacs do not require fertilization for seed development. The resulting progeny retain a maternal genotype. Hawkweeds in Hieracium subgenus Pilosella form mitotic embryo sacs by apospory. The initiation of sexual reproduction is required to stimulate apospory in ovules and to promote {{the function of the}} dominant locus, LOSS OF APOMEIOSIS, which stimulates the differentiation of somatic aposporous initial (AI) cells near sexually programmed cells. As AI cells undergo nuclear mitosis the sexual pathway terminates. The function of the dominant locus LOSS OF PARTHENOGENESIS in aposporous embryo sacs enables fertilization-independent embryo and endosperm development. Deletion of either locus results in partial reversion to sexual reproduction, and loss of function in both loci results in reversion to sexual development. In these apomicts, sexual reproduction is therefore the default reproductive mode upon which apomixis is superimposed. These loci are unlikely to encode factors critical for sexual reproduction but might recruit the sexual pathway to enable apomixis. <b>Incomplete</b> functional <b>penetrance</b> of these dominant loci is likely to lead to the generation of rare sexual progeny also derived from these facultative apomicts...|$|R

40|$|Nineteen {{families}} with autosomal dominant partial epilepsy were analysed clinically and electrophysiologically in detail. Seventy-one patients were studied {{as well as}} 33 non-epileptic at-risk family members. We subdivided the families into those with autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (ADNFLE) (n = 8), familial temporal lobe epilepsy (n = 7) and autosomal dominant partial epilepsy with variable foci (n = 4). However, the application of this nosology to certain families was difficult in cases of non-specific or conflicting clinical and electrophysiological evidence. This was underscored by the observation by depth electrode recordings in one patient that a so-called ADNFLE may originate in an extrafrontal area. The evolution of familial partial epilepsies, which exhibit great intrafamilial variability, is not always benign. The level of pharmacoresistance may reach 30 %, close to that seen in classical cryptogenic partial epilepsies. The familial character of a partial epilepsy may be unrecognized in small families as some affected members may have only EEG abnormalities and are clinically asymptomatic, which reflects <b>incomplete</b> clinical <b>penetrance.</b> In view of the recent discoveries of mutations in the α 4 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit in a few {{families with}} ADNFLE, this genetic study focused on genes encoding nicotinic receptor subunits and a candidate region on chromosome 10 q.

40|$|Screening {{families}} with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) presents a common clinical problem to practicing cardiologists, internists, and pediatricians. The traditional recommended strategy for screening relatives in most HCM families calls for such evaluations with echocardiography (and electrocardiogram [ECG]) on a 12 - to 18 -month basis, usually beginning at about age 12 years. If such tests show {{no evidence of}} left ventricular hypertrophy, i. e., without one or more segments of abnormally increased wall thickness by the time full growth and maturation is achieved (at the age of about 18 to 21 years), it has been customary practice to conclude that HCM is probably absent and reassure family members accordingly that further echocardiographic testing is unnecessary. However, novel developments {{in the definition of}} the genetic causes of HCM have defined both substantial molecular diversity and heterogeneity of the disease expression including (in some relatives) <b>incomplete</b> phenotypic <b>penetrance</b> and delayed, late-onset left ventricular hypertrophy well into adulthood. These observations have unavoidably reshaped the customary practice of genetic counseling and established a new proposed paradigm for clinical family screening of HCM families. Therefore, in the absence of genetic testing, strong consideration should be given to extending diagnostic serial echocardiography past adolescence and into mid-life for those family members with a normal echocardiogram and ECG. Of note, recent developments in laboratory DNA-based diagnosis for HCM could potentially avoid the necessity for serial echocardiography in many such relatives...|$|R
40|$|Background & AimsAceruloplasminemia {{is a rare}} {{autosomal}} recessive neurodegenerative disease associated with brain and liver iron accumulation which typically presents with movement disorders, retinal degeneration, and diabetes mellitus. Ceruloplasmin is a multi-copper ferroxidase that is secreted into plasma and facilitates cellular iron export and iron binding to transferrin. ResultsA novel homozygous ceruloplasmin gene mutation, c. 2554 + 1 G>T, was identified {{as the cause of}} aceruloplasminemia in three affected siblings. Two siblings presented with movement disorders and diabetes. Complementary DNA sequencing showed that this mutation causes skipping of exon 14 and deletion of amino acids 809 – 852 while preserving the open reading frame. Western blotting of liver extracts and sera of affected patients showed retention of the abnormal protein in the liver. Aceruloplasminemia was associated with severe brain and liver iron overload, where hepatic mRNA expression of the iron hormone hepcidin was increased, corresponding to the degree of iron overload. Hepatic iron concentration normalized after 3 and 5 months of iron chelation therapy with deferasirox, which was also associated with reduced insulin demands. During short term treatment there was no clinical or imaging evidence for significant effects on brain iron overload. ConclusionsAceruloplasminemia can show an <b>incomplete</b> clinical <b>penetrance</b> but is invariably associated with iron accumulation in the liver and in the brain.

40|$|Abstract Background Keloids are benign skin tumors {{that are}} {{the effect of a}} {{dysregulated}} wound-healing process in genetically predisposed patients. They are inherited with an autosomal dominant mode with <b>incomplete</b> clinical <b>penetrance</b> and variable expression. Keloids are characterized by formation of excess scar tissue beyond the boundaries of the wound. The exact etiology is still unknown and there is currently no appropriate treatment for keloid disease. Methods We analyzed sample tissues were obtained from 20 patients with keloid skin lesions and normal skin was obtained from 20 healthy donors. The telomeres were measured by Terminal Restriction Fragment (TRF) analysis and Real-Time PCR assay. Quantitative Real-Time RT-PCR analysis of hTERT gene expression was performed and intracellular ROS generation was measured. Results In this study, we determined whether telomeric shortening and the expression of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) occurs in keloid patients. Using Terminal Restriction Fragment (TRF) analysis and Real-Time PCR assay, we detected a significant telomere shortening of 30 % in keloid specimens compared to normal skin. Using quantitative Real-Time RT-PCR, telomerase activity was found absent in the keloid tissues. Moreover, an increase in ROS generation was detected in fibroblasts cell cultures from keloid specimens as more time elapsed compared to fibroblasts from normal skin. Conclusion Telomere shortening has been reported in several metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. We found that telomere shortening can also be associated with human keloids. Chronic oxidative stress {{plays a major role in}} the pathophysiology of several chronic inflammatory diseases. Here we found increased ROS generation in fibroblasts from keloid fibroblasts cell cultures when compared to normal skin fibroblasts. Hence we conclude that oxidative stress might be an important modulator of telomere loss in keloid because of the absence of active telomerase that counteracts telomere shortening. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser (MRKH) {{syndrome}} affects {{at least}} 1 out of 4500 women and has {{for a long}} time been considered as a sporadic anomaly. Congenital absence of upper vagina and uterus is the prime feature of the disease which, in addition, is often found associated with unilateral renal agenesis or adysplasia as well as skeletal malformations (MURCS association). The phenotypic manifestations of MRKH overlap various other syndromes or associations and thus require accurate delineation. Since MRKH manifests itself in males, the term GRES syndrome (Genital, Renal, Ear, Skeletal) might be more appropriate when applied to both sexes. The MRKH syndrome, when described in familial aggregates, seems to be transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait with an <b>incomplete</b> degree of <b>penetrance</b> and variable expressivity. This suggests the involvement of either mutations in a major developmental gene or a limited chromosomal deletion. Until recently progress in understanding the genetics of MRKH syndrome has been slow, however, now HOX genes have been shown to play key roles in body patterning and organogenesis, and in particular during genital tract development. Expression and/or function defects of one or several HOX genes may account for this syndrome. </p...|$|R
40|$|Many genetic traits have complex {{modes of}} {{inheritance}}; they may exhibit <b>incomplete</b> or age-dependent <b>penetrance</b> {{or fail to}} show any clear Mendelian inheritance pattern.

Prior to undertaking a linkage study, {{it is important to consider}} whether the pedigrees available for the proposed study are likely to provide sufficient information to demonstrate linkage, assuming a linked marker is tested. In the current paper, we describe a computer simulation method to estimate the power of a proposed study to detect linkage for a complex genetic trait, given a hypothesized genetic model for the trait. Our method simulates trait locus genotypes consistent with observed trait phenotypes, in such a way that the probability to detect linkage can be estimated by sample statistics of the maximum lod score distribution. The method uses terms available when calculating the likelihood of the trait phenotypes for the pedigree and is applicable to any trait determined by one or a few genetic loci; individual-specific environmental effects can also be dealt with. Our method provides an objective answer to the question, Will these pedigrees provide sufficient information to map this complex genetic trait...|$|R
40|$|Some {{individuals}} with a particular disease-causing mutation or genotype fail to express {{most if not all}} features of the disease in question, a phenomenon that is known as ‘reduced (or <b>incomplete)</b> penetrance’. Reduced <b>penetrance</b> is not uncommon; indeed, there are many known examples of ‘disease-causing mutations’ that fail to cause disease in at least a proportion of the individuals who carry them. Reduced penetrance may therefore explain not only why genetic diseases are occasionally transmitted through unaffected parents, but also why healthy individuals can harbour quite large numbers of potentially disadvantageous variants in their genomes without suffering any obvious ill effects. Reduced penetrance can be a function of the specific mutation(s) involved or of allele dosage. It may also result from differential allelic expression, copy number variation or the modulating influence of additional genetic variants in cis or in trans. The penetrance of some pathogenic genotypes is known to be age- and/or sex-dependent. Variable penetrance may also reflect the action of unlinked modifier genes, epigenetic changes or environmental factors. At least in some cases, complete penetrance appears to require the presence of one or more genetic variants at other loci. In this review, we summarize the evidence for reduced penetrance being a widespread phenomenon in human genetics and explore some of the molecular mechanisms that may help to explain this enigmatic characteristic of human inherited disease...|$|R

40|$|Autosomal {{recessive}} interleukin (IL) - 12 p 40 (IL- 12 p 40) deficiency {{is a rare}} {{genetic etiology}} of Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial disease (MSMD). We report the genetic, immunologic, and clinical features of 49 patients from 30 kindreds originating from 5 countries (India, Iran, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and Tunisia). There are only 9 different mutant alleles of the IL 12 B gene: 2 small insertions, 3 small deletions, 2 splice site mutations, and 1 large deletion, each causing a frameshift and leading to a premature stop codon, and 1 nonsense mutation. Four of these 9 variants are recurrent, affecting 25 of the 30 reported kindreds, due to founder effects in specific countries. All patients are homozygous and display complete IL- 12 p 40 deficiency. As a result, the patients lack detectable IL- 12 p 70 and IL- 12 p 40 and have low levels of interferon gamma (IFN-γ). The clinical features are characterized by childhood onset of bacille Calmette-Guérin (attenuated Mycobacterium bovis strain) (BCG) and Salmonella infections, with recurrences of salmonellosis (36. 4 %) more common than recurrences of mycobacterial disease (25 %). BCG vaccination led to BCG disease in 40 of the 41 patients vaccinated (97. 5 %). Multiple mycobacterial infections were rare, observed in only 3 patients, whereas the association of salmonellosis and mycobacteriosis was observed in 9 patients. A few other infections were diagnosed, including chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (n = 3), nocardiosis (n = 2), and klebsiellosis (n = 1). IL- 12 p 40 deficiency has a high but <b>incomplete</b> clinical <b>penetrance,</b> with 33. 3 % of genetically affected relatives of index cases showing no symptoms. However, the prognosis is poor, with mortality rates of up to 28. 6 %. Overall, the clinical phenotype of IL- 12 p 40 deficiency closely resembles that of interleukin 12 receptor β 1 (IL- 12 Rβ 1) deficiency. In conclusion, IL- 12 p 40 deficiency is more common than initially thought and should be considered worldwide in patients with MSMD and other intramacrophagic infectious diseases, salmonellosis in particular.

This study involved a large Italian family, spanning 4 generations, with arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy of different phenotypes, including ARVC, DCM, system conduction defects, ventricular arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death. Mutation screening of LMNA and ARVC-related genes PKP 2, DSP, DSG 2, DSC 2, JUP, and CTNNA 3 was performed. We identified a novel heterozygous mutation (c. 418 _ 438 dup) in LMNA gene exon 2, occurring in a highly conserved protein domain across several species. This newly identified variant was not found in 250 ethnically-matched control subjects. Genotype-phenotype correlation studies suggested a co-segregation of the LMNA mutation with the disease phenotype and an <b>incomplete</b> and age-related <b>penetrance.</b> Based on clinical, pedigree, and molecular genetic data, this mutation was considered likely disease-causing. To clarify its potential pathophysiologic impact, functional characterization of this LMNA mutant was performed in cultured cardiomyocytes expressing EGFP-tagged wild-type and mutated LMNA constructs, and indicated an increased nuclear envelope fragility, leading to stress-induced apoptosis as the main pathogenetic mechanism. This study further expands {{the role of the}} LMNA gene in the pathogenesis of cardiac laminopathies, suggesting that LMNA should be included in mutation screening of patients with suspected arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy, particularly when they have ECG evidence for conduction defects.

To clarify its potential pathophysiologic impact, functional characterization of this LMNA mutant was performed in cultured cardiomyocytes expressing EGFP-tagged wild-type and mutated LMNA constructs, and indicated an increased nuclear envelope fragility, leading to stress-induced apoptosis as the main pathogenetic mechanism. This study further expands the role of the LMNA gene in the pathogenesis of cardiac laminopathies, suggesting that LMNA should be included in mutation screening of patients with suspected arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy, particularly when they have ECG evidence for conduction defects. The combination of clinical, genetic, and functional data contribute insights into the pathogenesis of this form of life-threatening arrhythmogenic cardiac laminopathy...|$|R
