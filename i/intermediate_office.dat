50|$|In telecommunication, a spill-forward {{feature is}} a service feature, in the {{operation}} of an <b>intermediate</b> <b>office,</b> that, acting on incoming trunk service treatment indications, assumes routing control of the call from the originating office. This increases the chances of completion by offering the call to more trunk groups than are available in the originating office.|$|E
50|$|A {{telegraphic address}} or cable address {{was a unique}} {{identifier}} code for a recipient of telegraph messages. Operators of telegraph services regulated the use of telegraphic addresses to prevent duplication. Rather like a uniform resource locator (URL), the telegraph address did not contain any routing information (aside from possibly a city name), but instead could be looked up by telegraph office personnel, who would then manually direct {{the message to the}} office nearest the destination or to an <b>intermediate</b> <b>office.</b> Since the destination address of a telegram counted as part of the message, using a short registered address code saved the expense of sending a complete street address. Telegraph addresses were chosen either as versions of a company's name or as a memorable short word, somehow associated with the recipient. Occasionally, an organization would be best known by its telegraphic address, for example Interflora or Interpol. A telegraphic address was a valuable part of a company's corporate identity, and disputes sometimes arose when a competitor registered a telegraphic address similar to a trade name or identifier used by a rival.|$|E

50|$|A sit-stand desk is an <b>intermediate</b> form of <b>office</b> {{workstation}} {{between a}} typical seated desk and a standing desk. It allows {{the user to}} position the workstation at a level convenient for sitting or standing. Sit-stand desks may be effective at reducing sitting time during the work day between 30 minutes and two hours per working day but the evidence is very low quality. It is unclear if sit-stand desks have health benefits.|$|R
40|$|In {{the complex}} interplay of {{segmented}} office markets and short- and long-term developments, a drama {{is taking place}} at an <b>intermediate</b> time scale: <b>office</b> buildings are becoming obsolete before their time. Since the mid- 1980 s, the problems arising from premature obsolescence, diminishing returns, higher costs, and increasing vacancies have drawn attention in the Netherlands. Premature obsolescence {{is the result of}} developments on the demand and supply side of the office market but also of the changing structure of cities. This study revolves around the owners experiences with the obsolescence of their office buildings in Amsterdam and Rotterdam and the strategies they use to cope with the problems associated with obsolescence. The owners of obsolete office buildings have a whole range of strategies to choose from, which may be grouped under two headings: property development (refurbishment and redevelopment, intended for either re-use as offices or as accommodation for other functions); and other forms of management (entailing little or no upgrading, intended for either maintenance or sale). The conditions for investment in renewal were not favourable during {{a large part of the}} research period. Yet for the majority of owners, the alternative strategies extension of lease without refurbishment, sale, change of function were even less attractive. The financial constraints played a key role in the decision-making. The limited financial scope for investment in renewal was not only the result of the realistic market rents for office space and for other uses; it was also a result of the financial obstacles introduced by the long-term owners themselves. This behaviour may be traced back to the use of old-fashioned methods of bookkeeping and valuation. Over the past few years, real growth in rents has created more financial leeway for that kind of investment. In the same period the owners who are active on the real estate investment market have become more professional. External benchmarks have forced them to act with greater transparency, show more market-responsiveness, and be more realistic in their bookkeeping. Thus, one may expect to see fewer constraints on investment in or sale of obsolete office buildings. A more 'normal' market of obsolete buildings will come into play, whereby possibilities and challenges will arise for different kinds of actors. The economic obsolescence of office premises will be a manageable problem for owners only if the locational obsolescence of the sites can be prevented. These locational problems cannot be solved by the owners of the premises alone. A regionally co-ordinated policy of local governments will be needed to upgrade the quality and capacity of existing office locations before releasing an ample supply of greenfields for office development. As long as existing office locations retain their appeal to office firms, the rent level can be kept up through a 'locational premium' effect. This creates additional financial possibilities for investment in renewal of the building...|$|R
40|$|Understanding {{the reasons}} for {{variations}} in physician resource utilization in coronary angioplasty (PTCA) and coronary surgery (CABG) is essential to efficiently organizing, managing, and paying for these procedures. To evaluate the extent of variations in physician resource utilization for CABGs and PTCAs and {{the reasons for}} these variations, the resource-based relative value scale (RBRVS), an index of relative weights for physician work and practice costs, is used to evaluate physician practice patterns. Given their extensive clinical review, RBRVS weights represent new, unique, comprehensive measures of physician resource utilization where 1 unit value is equivalent to an <b>intermediate</b> <b>office</b> visit for an established patient. Our investigation uses 3 years of clinical and financial data on 392 randomized patients with multivessel coronary artery disease (EAST data). receiving the initial therapy of either CABG or PTCA. RBRVS weights are assigned to each procedure code (CPT) and the distribution of RBRVS units and their allocation among different types of services are analyzed. Results show significant differences in physician resources for both CABGs and PTCAs. Among CABG patients, nearly a ninefold variation in physician resource units is evident (108 ± 46) and, for PTCA, a 29 -fold variation exists (66 ± 54). At three years, the average physician resource utilization for CABG is 64 % greater than PTCA. Significant differences are also evident in surgical, laboratory, imaging, and consult resources even after accounting for casemix. The findings demonstrate that the RBRVS is a viable and useful analytical tool for managerial and clinical personnel...|$|E
