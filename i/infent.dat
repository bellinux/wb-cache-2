5000|$|The lumbering {{community}} of Pensaukee was largely destroyed on July 7, 1877 in a disaster {{known as the}} Pensaukee Tornado. The death toll included four children and two adults, as well as 32 injuries, many horses and cattle killed, and 50 buildings destroyed, including the town's hotel (the Gardner House), sawmill, flour mill, boarding house, school, depot, and many houses and barns. The names of those killed in the two-minute disaster were reported in a telegram as [...] "L. Zanto Zanto, 35 years old, H. Baumgardner Baumgartner, 9 years, Jr., Albert Blackbird years, Mrs. E. R. Chesley Chesley, née Golather, 27 years, an <b>infent</b> [...] of Farley Farley, 2 years, and an infant of L. Zanto Zanto, 6 months." ...|$|E

40|$|All {{minerals}} in the mineralogical {{system can}} be projected onto a plane using four pairs of functions: each pair consists of the <b>InfEnt</b> function and one of four Qual functions. <b>InfEnt</b> is the information entropy (a function of the stoichiometry of a mineral formula), and Qual_ 1... Qual_ 4 are different but related functions of the atomic numbers of the elements present. The <b>InfEnt</b> vs. Qual plots for mineral groups or for the whole system offer a new insight into the behavior of chemical elements in minerals. They also permit plotting of scalar physical properties as a third dimension. The <b>InfEnt</b> and Qual data for 4872 mineral end-members are stored in a file that can be searched and used to identify unidentified or new mineral phases. Web of Science 26671070...|$|E
