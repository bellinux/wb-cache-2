25|$|The ACR {{criteria}} for the classification of patients were originally established as <b>inclusion</b> <b>criteria</b> for research purposes and were not intended for clinical diagnosis but have now become the de facto diagnostic criteria in the clinical setting. It {{should be noted that}} the number of tender points that may be active at any one time may vary with time and circumstance. A controversial study was done by a legal team looking to prove their client's disability based primarily on tender points and their widespread presence in non-litigious communities prompted the lead author of the ACR criteria to question now the useful validity of tender points in diagnosis. Use of control points has been used to cast doubt on whether a person has fibromyalgia, and to claim the person is malingering; however, no research has been done for the use of control points to diagnose fibromyalgia, and such diagnostic tests have been advised against, and people complaining of pain all over should still have fibromyalgia considered as a diagnosis.|$|E
25|$|In 1969, Swindon beat Arsenal 3–1 {{to win the}} League Cup for {{the only}} time in the club's history. As winners of the League Cup, Swindon were assured of a place in their first European competition: the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup. However, the Football Association had {{previously}} agreed to <b>inclusion</b> <b>criteria</b> with the organizers which mandated that only League Cup winners from Division One would be able to take part. As the team were not eligible, the short lived Anglo-Italian competitions were created to give teams from lower divisions experience in Europe. The first of these, the 1969 Anglo-Italian League Cup, was contested over two legs against Coppa Italia winners A.S. Roma. Swindon won 5–2, with the scorer of two goals in the League Cup final – Don Rogers – scoring once and new acquisition Arthur Horsfield acquiring his first hat-trick for the club. The team then {{went on to win the}} 1970 Anglo-Italian Cup competition in a tournament beset by hooliganism. The final against S.S.C. Napoli was abandoned after 79 minutes following pitch invasions and a missile barrage, with teargas being employed to allow the teams to return to the dressing room.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the past}} {{it was thought}} that the {{diagnosis}} of IBS relied on a diagnosis of exclusion; that is, if one cannot find a cause then IBS is the diagnosis.

Although the Rome II and III criteria were not designed to be management guidelines, they are currently a [...] "gold standard" [...] for the diagnosis of IBS.

2500|$|Some {{clinical}} trials have tested individualized homeopathy, {{and there have}} been reviews of this, specifically. A 1998 review found 32 trials that met their <b>inclusion</b> <b>criteria,</b> 19 of which were placebo-controlled and provided enough data for meta-analysis. These 19 studies showed a pooled odds ratio of 1.17 to 2.23 in favour of individualized homeopathy over the placebo, but no difference was seen when the analysis was restricted to the methodologically best trials. The authors concluded that [...] "the results of the available randomized trials suggest that individualized homeopathy has an effect over placebo. The evidence, however, is not convincing because of methodological shortcomings and inconsistencies." [...] Jay Shelton, author of a book on homeopathy, has stated that the claim assumes without evidence that classical, individualized homeopathy works better than nonclassical variations. A 2014 systematic review and meta-analysis found that individualized homeopathic remedies may be slightly more effective than placebos, though the authors noted that their findings were based on low- or unclear-quality evidence. The same research team later reported that taking into account model validity did not significantly affect this conclusion.|$|E
40|$|This {{investigation}} aims {{to discuss}} the methodologies applied in clinical trials published about CarisolvTM, {{in order to assess}} the best scientific evidence concerning chemo-mechanical caries removal. Papers concerning the use of CarisolvTM were sought using a search strategy. The titles and abstracts of all the reports identified through the search were analyzed by a single reviewer. The <b>inclusion</b> <b>criterion</b> involved: clinical trials having CarisolvTM in one of the study groups. Then, those that fulfilled the <b>inclusion</b> <b>criterion</b> underwent methodology assessment and data extraction. Only 12 papers met the <b>inclusion</b> <b>criterion.</b> It was observed that none of these studies complied with all the evaluated research methodological principles required in order to have power of evidence generation. CarisolvTM proved to be effective in caries removal. Appointment mean time was greater, but the perceived time was shorter than that using conventional techniques due to patients' perception of more comfort and a reduction of anesthesia needs. There were no adverse effect in long-term assessments. In studies with microbiological evaluation of the remaining dentine, it was observed that both the conventional and chemo-mechanical methods produced statistically significant reduction on counts of viable microorganisms...|$|R

Lastly, the FDA observed: [...] "Your [...] tumor measurements initially recorded on worksheets at baseline and on-study treatment [...] studies for all study subjects were destroyed and are not available for FDA inspectional review", meaning {{that there was no way}} for the FDA to verify either initial tumor sizes or effects that the antineoplastons may have had.|$|E

Vitamin A is cheap and easily provided through existing health services in low-income settings. It is thus important to determine the effect of routine supplementation of H levels, and because low blood vitamin A levels have been associated with rapid HIV infection and deaths, To identify randomised controlled trials comparing vitamin A supplementation with placebo in known HIV-infected pregnant women, authors searched the Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMBASE, AIDSearch and GATEWAY; checked reference lis,.

[...] However, antenatal vitamin A supplementation significantly improved birth weight, but there was no evidence of an effect on preterm births, stillbirths, deaths by 24 months.
