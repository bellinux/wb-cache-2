40|$|The {{changes of}} {{phytosanitary}} situation recently {{taking place in}} sugar beet crops in the Republic of Belarus are shown. It is noticed that in the crop agrocoenosises {{there is a high}} infestation level caused by Japanese barnyard millet (Echinochloa crus-galli (L) Pal. Beauv), field sowthistle (Sonchus arvensis L), chickweed (Stellaria media (L) Vill), quick grass (Agropyron repens (L) Pal Beauv), matricary (Matricaria perforate Merat), creeping thistle (Circium arvense (L) scop), marsh woundwort (Stachus palustris L) wild buckwheat (Polygonum convolvulus L), bristle stem hemp nettle (Galeopsis tetrahit L), common horsetail (Equisetum arvense L), <b>field</b> <b>forget-me-not</b> (Myosotis arvensis (L) Hill), shepherd's purse (Capsella bursa-pastoris (L) Med) etc. Due to non-observance of preventive and separate agrotechnical techniques especially in spring-summer period, such weeds as bedstraw (Galium aparine L), white campion (Melandrium album (Mill) Garcke), green amaranthus (Amaranthus retroflexus L) started to appear in the crops. To protect sugar beet effectively, two variants of herbicides application are proposed. The first one - a combined, one stipulating soil action herbicides application before planting or before sugar beet seedlings emergence and on seedlings - to carry out two treatment by post-emergence preparations. The second variant, a split post- -emergence herbicide application (two-three times spraying) on growing weeds at small application rates. In the next 5 - 6 years, a combined method will be of a primary importance in the conditions of the Republic...|$|E
