5|$|After the {{initiation}} of U.S. naval interdiction efforts in coastal waters, known as Operation Market Time, the trail had to do <b>double</b> <b>duty.</b> Materiel sent from the north was stored in caches in the border regions that were soon retitled Base Areas, which, in turn, became sanctuaries for NLF and PAVN forces seeking respite and resupply after conducting operations within South Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|A few DNA {{sequences}} in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, {{and more}} in plasmids and viruses, blur the distinction between sense and antisense strands by having overlapping genes. In these cases, some DNA sequences do <b>double</b> <b>duty,</b> encoding one protein when read along one strand, and a second protein when read {{in the opposite direction}} along the other strand. In bacteria, this overlap may be involved in the regulation of gene transcription, while in viruses, overlapping genes increase the amount of information that can be encoded within the small viral genome.|$|E

5|$|The term double burden {{arises from}} the fact that many women, as well as some men, are {{responsible}} for both domestic labor and paid labor. However, due to the thinking that a woman's time spent in domestic work is more valuable than a woman's time spent doing paid work, and that a man's time spent doing paid work is more valuable than a man's time spent doing domestic work, there is the issue of women having to do a large amount of both paid and unpaid work, leading to the double burden. Some alternative terms for double burden include : double day, second shift, and <b>double</b> <b>duty.</b>|$|E
5|$|Pulmonic {{consonant}} {{letters are}} arranged singly or in pairs of voiceless (tenuis) and voiced sounds, with these then grouped in columns from front (labial) sounds {{on the left}} to back (glottal) sounds on the right. In official publications by the IPA, two columns are omitted to save space, with the letters listed among 'other symbols', and with the remaining consonants arranged in rows from full closure (occlusives: stops and nasals), to brief closure (vibrants: trills and taps), to partial closure (fricatives) and minimal closure (approximants), again with a row left out to save space. In the table below, a slightly different arrangement is made: All pulmonic consonants {{are included in the}} pulmonic-consonant table, and the vibrants and laterals are separated out so that the rows reflect the common lenition pathway of stop → fricative → approximant, as well as the fact that several letters pull <b>double</b> <b>duty</b> as both fricative and approximant; affricates may be created by joining stops and fricatives from adjacent cells. Shaded cells are judged to be implausible.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{other data}} buses (e.g., Ethernet, HDMI), USB {{connections}} are directed, with both {{upstream and downstream}} ports emanating from a single host. This applies to electrical power, with only downstream facing ports providing power; this topology was chosen to easily prevent electrical overloads and damaged equipment. Thus, USB cables have different ends: A and B, with different physical connectors for each. Therefore, in general, each different format requires four different connectors: a plug and receptacle {{for each of the}} A and B ends. USB cables have the plugs, and the corresponding receptacles are on the computers or electronic devices. In common practice, the A end is usually the standard format, and the B side varies over standard, mini, and micro. The mini and micro formats also provide for USB On-The-Go with a hermaphroditic AB receptacle, which accepts either an A or a B plug. On-The-Go allows USB between peers without discarding the directed topology by choosing the host at connection time; it also allows one receptacle to perform <b>double</b> <b>duty</b> in space-constrained applications.|$|E

In 2013, he received a Leo Award for Best Musical Score in an Animation along with Steffan Andrews {{for his work in}} the Friendship Is Magic episode [...] "Magical Mystery Cure".

5|$|Metallica {{released}} {{their debut}} album Kill 'Em All on the independent label Megaforce Records in July 1983. The album helped to establish thrash metal, a heavy metal subgenre defined by its brisk riffs and intense percussion. After finishing its promotional tour, Metallica began composing new material and from September began performing {{the songs that}} were to make up Ride the Lightning at concerts. Because the band had little money, its members often ate one meal a day and stayed at fans' homes while playing clubs across the US. An incident occurred when part of Metallica's gear was stolen in Boston, and Anthrax lent Metallica its equipment to complete the remaining dates. When not gigging, the band stayed in a rented house in El Cerrito, California, called the Metallica Mansion. Frontman James Hetfield felt uneasy about performing <b>double</b> <b>duty</b> on vocals and rhythm guitar so the band offered the job to Armored Saint singer John Bush, who turned down the offer because Armored Saint was doing well at the time. Hetfield gradually built confidence as lead vocalist and kept his original role. Metallica started recording on February 20, 1984 at Sweet Silence Studios in Copenhagen, Denmark. The album was produced by Flemming Rasmussen, founder of Sweet Silence, {{who went on to}} produce the band's next two albums. Drummer Lars Ulrich chose Rasmussen because he liked his work on Rainbow's Difficult to Cure (1981) and was keen to record in Europe. Rasmussen, who had not heard of Metallica, agreed to work on the album, even though his studio employees questioned the band's talent. Rasmussen listened to Metallica's tapes before the members arrived and thought the band had great potential. Metallica rehearsed the album's material at Mercyful Fate's practice room in Copenhagen.|$|E
25|$|Equus {{was also}} {{presented}} in Baltimore in 1979 by the Lovegrove Alley Theatre. The production starred a pre-Broadway Charles S. Dutton {{in the role}} of Dysart.

A young actress named Lauren Raher played Jill Mason, and her real-life mother Rhona Raher portrayed Dora, Alan's mother.|$|E
25|$|Many fire sirens (used {{for calling}} the {{volunteer}} fire fighters) serve <b>double</b> <b>duty</b> as tornado or civil defense sirens, alerting an entire community of impending danger. Most fire sirens are either {{mounted on the}} roof of a fire station or on a pole next to the fire station. Fire sirens can also be mounted on or near government buildings, on tall structures such as water towers, as well as in systems where several sirens are distributed around a town for better sound coverage. Most fire sirens are single tone and mechanically driven by electric motors with a rotor attached to the shaft. Some newer sirens are electronically driven speakers.|$|E
50|$|The band again took a {{short break}} after the {{completion}} of the Mayhem Festival as Jordison once again returned to perform with the Murderdolls in Europe. Upon his return from Europe, he returned to perform with Zombie who had once again teamed up with Alice Cooper for the Halloween Hootenanny tour, a co-headlining tour which would also be supported by the Murderdolls. Jordison performed <b>double</b> <b>duties</b> on the tour, drumming for Zombie and playing guitar for the Murderdolls. Black Label Society, Children of Bodom and Clutch supported Zombie and Cooper on October 17 by merging the Black Label Berzerkus Tour with the Halloween Hootenanny Tour for one night only.|$|R
50|$|Overall, {{the conference}} and forum conference were marred by {{conflict}} and politicization of international and national events which {{had little to do}} with women's issues. The official agenda was obscured by nationalist causes pitting the developing countries of the South and the developed countries of the North against each other. The question for continued participation in the conferences left many asking if the focus could be shifted away from political issues and return to the problems related to women: aging; credit for economic development; <b>double</b> <b>duties</b> between work and family; fertility versus infertility; shortage of heat and inadequate water, support systems and lack of them; women’s health; and violence against women.|$|R
50|$|At {{the time}} of founding, the swing-span Mission Railway Bridge opened in 1891 was the only {{crossing}} of the Fraser River in the Fraser Valley below the Alexandra Bridge, and all rail traffic between Vancouver and the United States was necessarily routed through Mission until the New Westminster Bridge at New Westminster was built in 1904. The rail bridge at Mission <b>doubled</b> <b>duty</b> as a one-way alternating vehicular bridge until 1973, when a long-promised new Mission Bridge was finally completed. The bridge's location is geographically important {{at the head of}} the tidal bore on the Fraser River, and its water level gauge is an important measure of the Fraser's annual and sometimes dangerously large spring freshet.|$|R
25|$|The medieval {{collection}} in the main Metropolitan building, centered on the first-floor medieval gallery, contains about six thousand separate objects. While {{a great deal of}} European medieval art is on display in these galleries, most of the European pieces are concentrated at the Cloisters (see below). However, this allows the main galleries to display much of the Met's Byzantine art side-by-side with European pieces. The main gallery is host {{to a wide range of}} tapestries and church and funerary statuary, while side galleries display smaller works of precious metals and ivory, including reliquary pieces and secular items. The main gallery, with its high arched ceiling, also serves <b>double</b> <b>duty</b> as the annual site of the Met's elaborately decorated Christmas tree.|$|E
25|$|The {{sale was}} {{announced}} on the 26th, pending FCC approval. Release the World head Chris Panos pledged to keep as much secular programming as possible, including the NBC affiliation. Still, six full-time staff members left, including Angstadt, leaving the station's engineer Ray McInturff to pull <b>double</b> <b>duty</b> as manager. The station crammed into {{half of its}} building {{in an attempt to}} stabilize its financial situation by renting the other half out. The station's financial trouble brought the attention of the State Corporation Commission, who in March found grounds to block the sale. Television Fredericksburg had been granted an exception from stock-registration requirements under Virginia law, which the state argued should be removed if a controlling stake was to be sold to an out-of-state interest. Television Fredericksburg successfully defended its actions in an April 2 hearing, and the sale was allowed to proceed.|$|E
25|$|Midway {{through the}} 2000 season, Cheerios became Andretti's primary sponsor. This was the {{precursor}} to Petty Enterprises' switch to Dodge as their manufacturer, {{and with the}} team pulling <b>double</b> <b>duty</b> {{trying to keep the}} Pontiacs they were currently racing and prepare the Dodges that were coming in, things began to fall apart for the organization. He fell to twenty-third in points after finishing in the top ten twice. Over the next two seasons, Andretti posted three top ten finishes including a notable second at Bristol where he finished second to Elliott Sadler (this was the last 1-2 finish for Petty Enterprises and Wood Brothers Racing., before he was released midway through the 2003 season. He ran a couple of races for Haas CNC Racing and Richard Childress Racing before finishing the season in the No. 1 Pennzoil-sponsored Chevy for Dale Earnhardt, Inc. His best finish that year was twelfth at New Hampshire.|$|E
5000|$|In July 1773 the <b>double</b> <b>duties</b> {{were still}} being applied [...] "to the great {{detriment}} of Trade" [...] so, {{in an attempt to}} stop this, the Prussian king was asked [...] "to name & accept of a Sum that the City is capable of paying as a recompence".

50|$|In 2000, Roberts Radio {{was bought}} by Clear Channel Communications with Clear Channel taking control that November. Though WBWZ was aided by the {{elimination}} of rival WCTJ (now WPKF), its ratings soon began to slip to levels not seen since prior to the Hot AC format. After the decline stretched several years, the station was soon taken over by WPKF program director Jimi Jamm (Collins) whose past work had improved that station to levels beyond Clear Channel's expectations. On June 30, 2003, Z-93 {{was replaced by the}} more CHR-leaning Star 93.3. Bolger remained in mornings though with the departure of Dawn Spicer for WGY in Albany in April 2005 until December 2010 when Clear Channel replaced him with WPKF Program Director Chris Marino assuming <b>double</b> <b>duties</b> for the cluster.|$|R
25|$|Keating {{followed}} up on 2015’s winning success with his most successful IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship season yet in 2016. Racing the full season with Bleekemolen for the third-straight year, Keating once again kicked-off the schedule with <b>double</b> <b>duty</b> in the season-opening Rolex 24 At Daytona. He and co-drivers Jeff Mosing, Eric Foss, Gar Robinson and Damien Faulkner put the No. 93 Viper on the GTD-class podium for the second-straight year after the 2015 Daytona victory. The No. 93 gained three positions in the race’s final hour for a third-place finish. Keating and the No. 33 team in turn recovered from a Saturday night accident to finish 10th which made ViperExchange.com the only two-car GTD team in the Rolex 24 to place both of its entries in the top 10. Keating focused solely on the No. 33 Viper with Bleekemolen {{for the rest of}} the year after Daytona but encountered some tough going one race later in the 12 Hours of Sebring for the third year in a row. Bleekemolen was leading in the race’s opening hour when the No. 33 suffered a rear stub axle failure. The entry returned after some lengthy repairs and soldiered home to a 12th-place finish with Marc Miller co-driving with Keating and Bleekemolen.|$|E
500|$|Among FBO's other offscreen talent, {{the best}} known {{director}} to work regularly at the studio was Ralph Ince, younger brother of famous filmmaker Thomas H. Ince. Pulling <b>double</b> <b>duty</b> on occasion, Ralph Ince starred {{in four of the}} fourteen films he made for FBO. One production in which Ince served in both capacities was particularly well received: Chicago After Midnight (1928) was described by the New York Times as [...] "n unusually well-acted and adroitly directed underworld story." [...] After The Mistress of Shenstone, Henry King directed two more R-C films with Pauline Frederick, also in 1921: Salvage and The Sting of the Lash. Tod Browning directed two Gothic Pictures specials in 1924 starring Evelyn Brent: The Dangerous Flirt and Silk Stocking Sal.|$|E
500|$|The {{conflict}} was resolved when son Jay became a substitute drummer {{for his father}} during parts of the Working on a Dream Tour that Max could not make due to commitments to the O'Brien show.

[...] We promise to return him in one piece." [...] The younger Weinberg began playing during segments of the tour's shows, and got a very positive response from audiences and reviewers as a spark plug for the band. Max Weinberg said Jay's segments allowed him a [...] "total out-of-body experience. For the first time in – I've been with Bruce for 35 years – I've been able {{to go out in the}} audience and enjoy a Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band concert."

60|$|Thomas Mugridge, so strangely and pertinaciously {{clinging}} to life, was soon limping about again and performing his <b>double</b> <b>duties</b> of cook and cabin-boy. Johnson and Leach were bullied and beaten {{as much as}} ever, and they looked for their lives to end {{with the end of}} the hunting season; while the rest of the crew lived the lives of dogs and were worked like dogs by their pitiless master. As for Wolf Larsen and myself, we got along fairly well; though I could not quite rid myself of the idea that right conduct, for me, lay in killing him. He fascinated me immeasurably, and I feared him immeasurably. And yet, I could not imagine him lying prone in death. There was an endurance, as of perpetual youth, about him, which rose up and forbade the picture. I could see him only as living always, and dominating always, fighting and destroying, himself surviving.|$|R
500|$|The episode {{received}} mostly positive reviews. Dan Martin of The Guardian gave {{a positive}} review, writing, [...] "This was a fitting {{end to a}} golden era, and bravo to Steven Moffat for telling such an involving, emotional story with such style". He also praised {{the concept of the}} cherubs and the Angels in New York. However, he noted that he was [...] "flummoxed" [...] as to where in River's timeline the episode took place. The Daily Telegraph reviewer Gavin Fuller gave it five out of five stars, concluding [...] "'The Angels Take Manhattan' brought this mini-run of the series to a close with easily the best episode of the five: a powerful, taut, compelling, filmic, emotionally punchy affair which re-established the Angels as one of the standout monsters of the series and gave Amy Pond a fine send off". While he praised the four actors he felt Gillan was the star, and noted that Rory did not [...] "get any sort of send-off". Keith Phipps of The A.V.

Updating a concept introduced by TV hostess Vampira over three decades before, MST3K presented cheap, low-grade movies, primarily science fiction of the 1950s and 1960s, along with running voiceover commentary highlighting the films' shortcomings. Director Ed Wood has been called [...] "the master of the 'C-movie in this sense, although Z movie (see below) is perhaps even more applicable to his work.
