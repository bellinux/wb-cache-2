40|$|This paper {{presents}} a control mechanism for zero-cell-loss handoff in wireless ATM networks. Since the path re-routing process in handoff control causes the incompletion {{of the connection}} path during a transition period, a cell level scheduling mechanism has {{to be applied to}} avoid data loss. In this paper, we first describe the basic requirements at the cell level scheduler of ATM devices (ATM switches and ATM NIC cards). We show that a dynamic buffering and transmission control should be supported through <b>in-band</b> <b>signaling</b> with OAM cells. Then we propose a <b>in-band</b> <b>signaling</b> mechanism with an End-ofstream (EOS) OAM cell and a Start-of-stream (SOS) OAM cell to perform zero-cell-loss control at cell level. Finally, by combining the <b>in-band</b> <b>signaling</b> and ATM UNI/NNI outband signaling in right sequence, we {{presents a}} protocol design of handoff control which has no cell loss, duplication or misordering.

50|$|Whereas common-channel {{signaling}} {{systems are}} out-of-band by definition, and <b>in-band</b> <b>signaling</b> systems are also necessarily channel-associated, the above metering pulse example demonstrates that there exist channel-associated signaling systems which are out-of-band.|$|R

50|$|<b>In-band</b> <b>signaling</b> {{applies only}} to {{channel-associated}} signaling (CAS). In common channel signaling (CCS) separate channels are used for control and data, {{as opposed to the}} shared channel in CAS, so all control is out-of-band by definition.|$|R
50|$|When dialing from a {{land-line}} telephone, {{the telephone}} number is encoded and transmitted across the telephone line {{in form of}} dual-tone multi-frequency signaling (DTMF). The tones control the telephone system by instructing the telephone switch where to route the call. These control tones are sent over the same channel, the copper wire, and in the frequency range (300 Hz to 3.4 kHz) as the audio of the telephone call. <b>In-band</b> <b>signaling</b> is also used on older telephone carrier systems to provide inter-exchange information for routing calls. Examples {{of this kind of}} <b>in-band</b> <b>signaling</b> system are the Signaling System No. 5 (SS5) and R2 signalling.|$|R

50|$|A {{blue box}} is an {{electronic}} device that simulated an operator by generating the same tones employed by a telephone operator's dialing console to, for example, switch long-distance calls. A blue box {{is a tool}} {{that emerged in the}} 1960s and '70s; it allowed users to route their own calls by emulating the <b>in-band</b> <b>signaling</b> mechanism that then controlled switching in long distance dialing systems. The most typical use of a blue box was to place free telephone calls. A related device, the black box, enabled one to receive calls which were free to the caller. The blue box no longer works in most Western nations, as modern switching systems do not use <b>in-band</b> <b>signaling.</b> Instead, signaling occurs on an out-of-band channel which cannot be accessed from the line the caller is using, a system called Common Channel Interoffice Signaling or CCIS.|$|R

40|$|Abstract- Basis of {{cognitive}} radio is to exploit unused frequency channels in licensed band.

50|$|MF {{and other}} <b>in-band</b> <b>signaling</b> systems differ from Signaling System 7 (SS7) {{in that the}} routing digits are out-pulsed in MF format in the same {{voiceband}} channel used for voice. The dialing user cannot detect these digits being out-pulsed because the audio connection is not established {{all the way to}} the userâs handset or device until after the connection is established with the terminating switch.
