5|$|Birds {{are often}} {{important}} to island ecology. Birds have frequently reached <b>islands</b> <b>that</b> mammals have not; on those islands, birds may fulfil ecological roles typically played by larger animals. For example, in New Zealand the moas were important browsers, {{as are the}} kereru and kokako today. Today the plants of New Zealand retain the defensive adaptations evolved {{to protect them from}} the extinct moa. Nesting seabirds may also affect the ecology of islands and surrounding seas, principally through the concentration of large quantities of guano, which may enrich the local soil and the surrounding seas.|$|E

50|$|In 1756, Daniel Demetre had {{acquired}} the <b>island</b> <b>that</b> was {{then known as}} John Smith's Island. During the 1770s, William DeBrahm, a Surveyor General to King George III, noted the existence of entrenchments and ruins on the <b>Island</b> <b>that</b> could not be explained. The mysteries have lingered to this day.|$|R

5|$|If {{the green}} parrots Leguat {{referred}} to {{were not the}} Rodrigues parrot (Necropsittacus rodericanus), they might perhaps have been a green colour morph of Newton's parakeet, as Julian Hume has suggested. As A. Newton observed in his original description, some feathers of the female specimen display both blue and green tinges, depending on the light. This may {{explain some of the}} discrepancies. The green parrots mentioned could also instead have been storm-blown members of Psittacula species from other <b>islands,</b> <b>that</b> survived on Rodrigues for a short time.|$|E
5|$|In 1735, Euler {{presented}} {{a solution to}} the problem known as the Seven Bridges of Königsberg. The city of Königsberg, Prussia was set on the Pregel River, and included two large <b>islands</b> <b>that</b> were connected to each other and the mainland by seven bridges. The problem is to decide whether it is possible to follow a path that crosses each bridge exactly once and returns to the starting point. It is not possible: there is no Eulerian circuit. This solution is considered to be the first theorem of graph theory, specifically of planar graph theory.|$|E
5|$|In the end, {{air superiority}} and {{command of the}} sea allowed the Allies to heavily {{reinforce}} their position on Los Negros. The 1st Cavalry Division could then overrun the islands. The campaign officially ended on 18May 1944. The Allied victory completed {{the isolation of the}} major Japanese base at Rabaul that was the ultimate objective of the Allied campaigns of 1942 and 1943. A major air and naval base was developed in the Admiralty <b>Islands</b> <b>that</b> became an important launching point for the campaigns of 1944 in the Pacific.|$|E

5|$|In {{the nineteenth}} century, {{the range of}} the mockingbird {{expanded}} northward towards provinces such as Nova Scotia and Ontario and states such as Massachusetts, although the sightings were sporadic. Within the first five decades of the twentieth century, regions that received an influx of mockingbirds were Maine, Vermont, Ohio, Iowa, and New York. In western states such as California, the population was restricted to the lower Sonoran regions but by the 1970s the mockingbirds was residential in most counties. <b>Islands</b> <b>that</b> saw introductions of the mockingbird include Bermuda (in which it failed), Barbados, St. Helena, Socorro Island, the Cayman Islands and Tahiti.|$|E
5|$|Most seabirds are colonial, and {{the reasons}} for colonial {{behaviour}} are assumed to be similar, if incompletely understood by scientists. Procellariids for the most part have weak legs and are unable to easily take off, making them highly vulnerable to mammalian predators. Most procellariid colonies are located on <b>islands</b> <b>that</b> have historically been free of mammals; for this reason some species cannot help but be colonial as they are limited to a few locations to breed. Even species that breed on continental Antarctica, such as the Antarctic petrel, are forced by habitat preference (snow-free north-facing rock) to breed in just a few locations.|$|E
5|$|Of the 718 islands, only 47 are {{inhabited}} in {{the sense}} that at least one person resides on that island. Some sources indicate that Croatia has 67 inhabited islands, which is the number of <b>islands</b> <b>that</b> have a settlement on them, but 20 of these islands have lost all of their permanent population {{as a result of the}} population decline occurring throughout the Croatian islands due to insufficient economic activity.|$|E

5|$|The Greek {{campaign}} {{ended with}} a complete German and Italian victory. The British {{did not have the}} military resources to carry out big simultaneous operations in North Africa and the Balkans. Moreover, even had they been able to block the Axis advance, they would have been unable to exploit the situation by a counter-thrust across the Balkans. The British came very near to holding Crete and perhaps other <b>islands</b> <b>that</b> would have provided air support for naval operations throughout the eastern Mediterranean.|$|E
5|$|The Noronha skink is very {{abundant}} throughout Fernando de Noronha, even occurring commonly in houses, {{and also}} occurs on the smaller <b>islands</b> <b>that</b> surround the main island of the archipelago. Its abundance {{may be a}} result of the absence of ecologically similar competitors. Apart from T.atlantica, the reptile fauna of Fernando de Noronha consists of the indigenous amphisbaenian Amphisbaena ridleyi and two introduced lizards, the gecko Hemidactylus mabouia and the tegu Tupinambis merianae.|$|E
5|$|The Solomon Islands are a group {{consisting}} of approximately a thousand <b>islands</b> <b>that</b> serves as home to almost 600,000 people. The island chain was designated a protectorate of the United Kingdom in the 1890s, and remained under British control during World War II, where the island chain {{was the center}} of some of the war's worst fighting. In 1976, the Solomon Islands won the right to self-government from the British, and declared independence in 1978. The nation fell into a period of civil instability between then and 2003, when Australia led a military force to restore law and order in the country.|$|E

5|$|The {{primary purpose}} of the stop lines and the {{anti-tank}} <b>islands</b> <b>that</b> followed was to hold up the enemy, slowing progress and restricting the route of an attack. The need to prevent tanks from breaking through was of key importance. Consequently, the defences generally ran along pre-existing barriers to tanks such as rivers and canals; railway embankments and cuttings; thick woods; and other natural obstacles. Where possible, usually well-drained land was allowed to flood, making the ground too soft to support even tracked vehicles.|$|E
5|$|The suburb was {{originally}} three low lying <b>islands</b> <b>that</b> {{were covered in}} shell grit and saltbush and surrounded by mangrove and samphire swamps. Fishermen had established huts on the islands by 1865 and by 1873 there were 13 huts and a boathouse recorded when the area was surveyed by Thomas Evans. By the 1890s people were visiting the islands attracted to the supposed curative properties of the mangrove mud, using the beach for bathing and fishing for crabs.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{population}} of macaroni penguins is estimated at around 18 million mature individuals, a substantial decline has been recorded in several locations. This includes a 50% reduction in the South Georgia population between the mid-1970s to mid-1990s, and {{the disappearance of the}} species from Isla Recalada in Southern Chile. This decline of the overall population in the last 30 years has resulted in the classification of the species as globally Vulnerable by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Long-term monitoring programs are underway at a number of breeding colonies, and many of the <b>islands</b> <b>that</b> support breeding populations of this penguin are protected reserves. The Heard Islands and McDonald Islands are World Heritage Sites for the macaroni penguin. The macaroni penguin may be being impacted by commercial fishing and marine pollution. A 2008 study suggests the abilities of female penguins to reproduce may be negatively affected by climate- and fishing-induced reductions in krill density.|$|E

5|$|As Delta {{accelerated}} to {{the northeast}} towards the Canary Islands, it intensified again, reaching a second peak of just under hurricane strength on November27. In post-storm analysis, the NHC noted {{that there was a}} possibility that Delta had briefly reached hurricane strength that day; however, the data was not conclusive enough to justify an upgrade to hurricane status. On November28, as it neared the Canary Islands Tropical Storm Delta lost its tropical characteristics. The extratropical storm, which maintained winds of near-hurricane strength, passed about 105mi (165km) north of the <b>islands</b> <b>that</b> night. The storm moved over Morocco early on November29 and rapidly weakened overland, dissipating late that day over northwestern Algeria.|$|E
5|$|Buenos Aires {{attempted}} to retain {{influence over the}} settlement by installing a garrison, but a mutiny in 1832 was followed the next year {{by the arrival of}} British forces who reasserted Britain's rule. The Argentine Confederation (headed by Buenos Aires Governor Juan Manuel de Rosas) protested against Britain's actions, and Argentine governments have continued since then to register official protests against Britain. The British troops departed after completing their mission, leaving the area without formal government. Vernet's deputy, the Scotsman Matthew Brisbane, returned to the <b>islands</b> <b>that</b> year to restore the business, but his efforts ended after, amid unrest at Port Louis, gaucho Antonio Rivero led a group of dissatisfied individuals to murder Brisbane and the settlement's senior leaders; survivors hid in a cave on a nearby island until the British returned and restored order. In 1840, the Falklands became a Crown colony, and Scottish settlers subsequently established an official pastoral community. Four years later, nearly everyone relocated to Port Jackson, considered a better location for government, and merchant Samuel Lafone began a venture to encourage British colonisation.|$|E
5|$|Common {{over much}} of the Northern Hemisphere, S.coccinea occurs in the Midwest, in the valleys between the Pacific coast, the Sierra Nevada, and the Cascade Range. Its North American {{distribution}} extends north to various locations in Canada and south to the Mexican state Jalisco. The fungus has also been collected from Chile in South America. It is also found in the Old World—Europe, Africa, Asia, Australia, and India. Specimens collected from the Macaronesian <b>islands</b> <b>that</b> once thought to be S.coccinea were later determined to be the distinct species S.macaronesica. A 1995 study of the occurrence of British Sarcoscypha (including S.coccinea and S.austriaca) concluded that S.coccinea was becoming very rare in Great Britain. All species of Sarcoscypha, including S.coccinea, are Red-Listed in Europe. In Turkey, it is considered critically endangered.|$|E
