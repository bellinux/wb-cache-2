40|$|Intensive {{efforts have}} been put into the growth of silicon {{crystals}} to suit today's solar cell and integrated circuit requirements. Each step of processing the crystal must also receive concentrated attention to preserve the grown-in perfection {{and to provide a}} suitable device-ready wafer at reasonable cost. A comparison is made between solar cell and I. C. requirements on the mechanical processing of silicon from ingot to wafer. Specific defects are described that can ruin the slice or can possibly lead to device degradation. These include grinding cracks, saw exit chips, crow's-foot fractures, edge cracks, and <b>handling</b> <b>scratches...</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{process is}} subject to both burst errors and random errors. Burst errors include those due to disc {{material}} (defects of aluminum reflecting film, poor reflective index of transparent disc material), disc production (faults during disc forming and disc cutting etc.), disc <b>handling</b> (<b>scratches</b> – generally thin, radial and orthogonal to direction of recording) and variations in play-back mechanism. Random errors include those due to jitter of reconstructed signal wave and interference in signal. CIRC (Cross-Interleaved Reed–Solomon code) {{is the basis for}} error detection and correction in the CD process. It corrects error bursts up to 3,500 bits in sequence (2.4nbsp&mm in length as seen on CD surface) and compensates for error bursts up to 12,000 bits (8.5nbsp&mm) that may be caused by minor scratches.|$|R

Oils, dirt, lotions, and perspiration transmitted through fingerprints can destroy emulsion and cause bleaching, staining, and silver mirroring. Physical damage caused by human <b>handling</b> includes abrasion, <b>scratches,</b> tears, breakage, and cracks.|$|R

40|$|Whether integrable, {{partially}} integrable or nonintegrable, nonlinear partial {{differential equations}} (PDEs) can be <b>handled</b> from <b>scratch</b> with {{essentially the same}} toolbox, when one looks for analytic solutions in closed form. The basic tool is the appropriate use of the singularities of the solutions, and {{this can be done}} without knowing these solutions in advance. Since the elaboration of the singular manifold method by Weiss et al., many improvements have been made. After some basic recalls, we give an interpretation of the method allowing us to understand why and how it works. Next, we present {{the state of the art}} of this powerful technique, trying as much as possible to make it a (computerizable) algorithm. Finally, we apply it to various PDEs in 1 + 1 dimensions, mostly taken from physics, some of them chaotic: sine-Gordon, Boussinesq, Sawada-Kotera, Kaup-Kupershmidt, complex Ginzburg-Landau, Kuramoto-Sivashinsky, etc. Comment: LaTeX, 85 pages, subject index, no figure, to appear in Direct and inverse methods in nonlinear evolution equations, ed.

5000|$|The black tree monitor is {{generally}} well adapted for living in trees. Its tail is particularly long, sometimes {{two-thirds of the}} overall body length, and is used in a prehensile manner to stabilize the animal in the branches. [...] In fact, the tail is used solely for this purpose, as the animal does not evince the defensive tail-lashing behaviour seen in other monitor species. The black tree monitor’s feet sport large claws and adhesive soles, which help it to maintain grip in the trees. It also has unusually long teeth for a monitor of its size, which may help it {{to hold on to}} prey it catches in the canopy. Black tree monitors in the wild are reported to be nervous and high-strung; they will flee if threatened, and if <b>handled</b> carelessly, will <b>scratch,</b> bite, and defecate on the offender.|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} {{prior to the}} Eurovision contest, Skaat explained what the song was about to him. He said, [...] "The song 'Milim' is about separation, of any kind. Separation of lovers, of a family. In Hebrew, 'Milim' means words. The words are the most memorable thing we have after a separation, words are very powerful and they are engraved in our minds and hearts. Sadly, my beloved grandfather suddenly passed away {{the week of the}} Israeli pre-selection competition, which gave the lyrics of 'Milim' a very personal and difficult meaning to me." [...] The song lyrics seem to suggest that the person singing the song has been left alone while his or her loved one has left, perhaps permanently. Household items and architectural details are mentioned throughout the song--fallen ceiling, <b>scratched</b> <b>handles,</b> arranged books, and windows with cracked glass. The song contains the refrain, [...] "Hish'art li rak milim" [...] (English version: [...] "You left me only words"), which is repeated throughout the chorus.|$|R
50|$|The digital {{formation}} of sets and locations, {{especially in the}} time of growing film series and sequels, is that virtual sets, once computer generated and stored, can be easily revived for future films.Considering digital film images are documented as data files on hard disk or flash memory, varying systems of edits can be executed with the alteration of a few settings on the editing console with the structure being composed virtually in the computer's memory. A broad choice of effects can be sampled simply and rapidly, without the physical constraints posed by traditional cut-and-stick editing. Digital cinema allows national cinemas to construct films specific to their cultures in ways that the more constricting configurations and economics of customary film-making prevented. Low-cost cameras and computer-based editing software have gradually enabled films to be produced for minimal cost. The ability of digital cameras to allow film-makers to shoot limitless footage without wasting pricey celluloid has transformed film production in some Third World countries. From consumers' perspective digital prints don't deteriorate with the number of showings. Unlike celluloid film, there is no projection mechanism or manual <b>handling</b> to add <b>scratches</b> or other physically generated artefacts. Provincial cinemas that would have received old prints can give consumers the same cinematographic experience (all other things being equal) as those attending the premiere.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Data {{handling}} in {{the field}} of NMR metabolomics has historically been reliant on either in-house mathematical routines or long chains of expensive commercial software. Thus, while the relatively simple biochemical protocols of metabolomics maintain a low barrier to entry, new practitioners of metabolomics experiments are forced to either purchase expensive software packages or craft their own data <b>handling</b> solutions from <b>scratch.</b> This inevitably complicates the standardization and communication of data handling protocols {{in the field}}. We report a newly developed open-source platform for complete NMR metabolomics data handling, MVAPACK, and describe its application on an example metabolic fingerprinting data set. The biochemical procedures involved in metabolomicsexperiments are potentially straightforward and inex-pensive, depending on the biological systems and pathways under study. 1 The minimal sample handling requirements of one-dimensional (1 D) 1 H NMR spectroscopy and the immense sensitivity of multivariate statistical methods such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Partial Least Squares (PLS) make NMR metabolic fingerprinting especially attainable. This low barrier to entry has no doubt contributed to the rapid growth of the field. Unfortunately, commercial software packages available for multivariate analysis (SIMCA, PLS Toolbox, The Unscrambler, etc.) tend to be expensive and require more software for upstream processing and treatment of spectral data. Furthermore, such packages provide little to no domain-specific functionality, requiring a user to first open and preprocess NMR data in ACD/ 1 D NMR Manager (Advance...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Distributed {{applications}} are generally structured {{as a set}} of communicating processes executing on multiple processors. As the number of processors in a distributed system and the running time of applications increases, the likelihood of processor failure increases. Without mechanisms for recovery, the failure of even a single processor can mandate restarting an entire application from <b>scratch.</b> <b>Handling</b> multiple failures is important because power failures, user error, etc. can often cause several machines to fail almost simultaneously. With appropriate recovery mechanisms, distributed applications can survive failures and complete restarts can be avoided. In this paper we present a set of distributed recovery techniques called CPR (Complete Process Recovery) which utilize vector time to handle failures and address both consistent state restoration and the associated message handling issues. The latter is important, since some recovery techniques delegate the handling of lost or duplicate messages to the message transport mechanism. This requires the ability to checkpoint the network layer (a serious restriction), since the network is generally unaware of the anomalous messages induced by process failure and recovery. CPR provides a comprehensive approach to process recovery which melds consistent state restoration and proper message handling. Our technique requires non-failed processes to roll back at most once in response to a single failure and has low message complexity. Processes required to rollback after a failure do so concurrently, which substantially decreases recovery delay after a failure has occurred...|$|R
