He kept emphasizing the word 'truth' and I asked him if he really wanted the truth. He assured me that he did...Now Tuohy made a big deal about hearing the truth.

25|$|After leaving Human Entertainment, Suda founded Grasshopper Manufacture {{to fulfill}} his wish to create {{original}} video game projects. Its debut title was The Silver Case for the PlayStation. He was initially approached by ASCII Entertainment, who acted as the game's publishers and provided funding. Suda acted as director, co-writer and designer for the game. Alongside this, Suda had the responsibility of acting as the studio's CEO, so he felt responsible for ensuring <b>everyone</b> <b>got</b> paid. The initial staff of Grasshopper Manufacture was fairly small, which meant that the game's assets and style needed to be adjusted to fit limited resources and a tight budget. The title was a success in Japan and helped establish Grasshopper Manufacture, although had limited critical success due to the proliferation of its visual novel style at the time. While Suda wanted an overseas release, {{the large amount of}} text and difficulties localizing puzzle elements kept The Silver Case exclusive to Japan for a long time. Suda attempted to port the game to the Nintendo DS, but he was unsatisfied with the result and cancelled the project despite it being close to completion. Suda later acted as producer for a high-definition remaster of The Silver Case for Microsoft Windows, which was the title's Western debut. He also co-wrote new content that connected to its mobile sequel Ward 25.|$|E

Koichi Tohei was the only sensei who gave lessons or spoke to foreigners in English. His style was very free.... Now he is known for Ki Aikido.

2500|$|A further {{strategy}} {{aimed at}} diminishing the power dynamic between photographer/subject {{was to have}} each participant choose their own image, with the option of re-photographing them if they desired. [...] Fulbeck states, [...] "... every participant not only got to write their statement the way they wanted to, they also got to pick their own image. A camera is a tremendously powerful tool and the power dynamic between photographer and subject is palpable. For this reason, I wanted to give some of the power back to the subjects. It {{was never going to}} be completely democratic – it is, after all, my concept, my project, and my design – but there are some strategies you can employ to make it less unilateral. <b>Everyone</b> <b>got</b> to see their image and choose to keep it or erase it and shoot again."

2500|$|A {{great deal}} of the songs on the album were written over a two-year period by Love, Erlandson, and Schemel, in both Los Angeles as well as in a {{makeshift}} studio Love had set up at her and Cobain's secluded home in Carnation, Washington. Love also stated that [...] "half the fucking songs were written in the studio." [...] According to Love, the songwriting process for the album was [...] "really easy": [...] "We started at [...] Jabberjaw. I wrote [...] "Violet" [...] there. Then we moved to Seattle in the middle of that. [...] "Miss World" [...] was written in Seattle, if I remember correctly... We had this great rehearsal space : It was just perfect, up on Capitol Hill, near the Urban Outfitters. <b>Everyone</b> <b>got</b> really close. There was just a great flow." [...] Love also stated that she had been listening to The Breeders, Pixies, Echo and the Bunnymen, and Joy Division while recording the album, and that their work had acted as primary influences on her at the time.|$|E
2500|$|Entertainment Weeklys Shirley Li {{awarded the}} episode a [...] "B+" [...] saying, [...] "Judging this episode on its own, I'd say it didn't feel {{at all like}} a Legends of Tomorrow episode, despite all the quips from Mick and the blue chyron and the time traveling. Though Stein got an {{emotional}} arc, {{the rest of the}} emotional story belonged to Barry and the tediously angry Cisco, making this almost like a second Flash episode... Yet, much of this episode worked as an hour-long finale. <b>Everyone</b> <b>got</b> a chance to shine, and though the Dominators' motive is still somewhat muddled, the invasion sparked fun rapport among the teams – and isn't that the whole point of a crossover in the first place? This might not drive any non-Legends viewers to watch Legends, but the episode gave plenty to Arrowverse fans." [...] Li also felt some of the potential [...] "budgetary constraints were glaring" [...] such as the fact that Thea did not appear in the episode, and Oliver's [...] "lash out" [...] at Kara to have her not be at the confrontation with [...] "Glasses".|$|E

2500|$|The band {{subsequently}} started afresh {{in early}} 2012, returning to Droste's mother's home in Cape Cod, where the band had previously recorded its second studio album, Yellow House (2006). Commenting {{on the return}} to Yellow House, Droste noted, [...] "It's so funny that we went back there in the end. It's my grandmother's house, we know it, and we can use it for free. And {{as soon as we}} got there, things started happening. [...] We just sat by the fire, Dan strumming, me singing, and it happened. Some of the best songs on the record, like [...] "Speak in Rounds" [...] and [...] "Half Gate", came out of that. We stayed there in isolation for two months straight." [...] Droste stated that he and Rossen decided to [...] "'try writing from the bottom up. We've never done it before.' There's a little bit of fear there because it's a new process we've never tried. We've never sat side by side and said, 'Let's literally, out of the ether, start writing songs together.' A couple of songs came that way, and that's why they're verse me, chorus Dan. [...] Suddenly the synergy hit, and the momentum struck, and then <b>everyone</b> <b>got</b> excited.

2500|$|While the bus {{was leaving}} San Fernando, the bus driver saw at a {{distance}} that there were several trucks blocking the highway up ahead, {{and that there were}} several men wearing ski-masks and holding AR-15s. The gunmen ordered the bus to stop, and the bus driver obeyed. The cartel members approached the bus pointing their guns and yelling, [...] "Open the door, asshole! Move, you son of a bitch, unless you want me to shoot you dead." [...] The chauffeur, trembling, opened the door for the gunmen, who quickly stormed the bus as soon as the door was opened. [...] "You are all fucked," [...] yelled one of the gunmen to the people on board; the passengers were frightened, and some of them cried, thinking it was simply a regular armed robbery. But {{that was not the case}} this time. The cartel members then ordered the bus driver to drive the bus deep into a dirt road for about ten kilometers before reaching a plain area, [...] "in the middle of nowhere." [...] In the area there were about twenty luxurious trucks and three passenger buses, some of them with bullet holes, flat tires, and broken windows. The driver was then ordered to stop the bus, and all the men were then told to descend from the vehicle. They were asked to form a line, and the cartel members began to organize them from youngest to oldest and from strongest to weakest. Those who looked old or weak were separated from the group, tied from their feet, and then taken elsewhere. Those who were left were ordered to take off their shirts and remain where they were. A man wearing black military uniform, a bulletproof vest, and a kit belt was called from the trucks that were parked nearby. All of the triggermen referred to him as Commander 40, better known as Miguel Treviño Morales, one of the top leaders of Los Zetas. The man approached the passengers that were lined up in front of him, and said in an energetic voice: [...] "Let's see, assholes. Who wants to live?" [...] But no one answered. One teenager accidentally wet himself out of nervousness, and Commander 40 killed him with a shot to the head. Treviño Morales then yelled: [...] "I will ask all of you one more time. Who the fuck wants to live?" [...] All of the men raised their hands. [...] "Good. We will test your abilities to see how capable you are. If you make it, you'll survive; if you do not, you're fucked." [...] Commander 40 then asked his henchmen to bring the bats and clubs, and each of the passengers was given one. He then said, [...] "Look, each of you will get in pairs and beat the shit out of each other. Those who survive will work for Los Zetas, those who don't, well, they're fucked." [...] All of the passengers were shocked at the order the individual in front of them gave them. <b>Everyone</b> <b>got</b> their bats and clubs, joined up as a pair, and stared at their partners nervously. Treviño Morales then said: [...] "Now beat the shit out of each other." ...|$|E

60|$|Arrived {{at the top}} of the pass, {{we found}} {{ourselves}} at the head of a deep ravine, on the side of which, a quarter of a mile from the summit, it was decided that the camp should be pitched. A more uncomfortable place for a camp could hardly be imagined. The ground was ploughed, and was extremely sloping. The supply of water was deficient, and was four or five hundred feet below us, and the wind swept over the top of the pass with piercing force. However, there was no help for it. The 4th had started four miles behind us, and there was no ground even so good as that selected for another seven miles. Immediately on our arrival, and before the tents were pitched, a tremendous shower came on, and <b>everyone</b> <b>got</b> drenched before the baggage-animals arrived with the tents. The black earth turned, as if by magic, into slimy clay, and our position was the reverse of agreeable. Far worse, however, was the condition of the 4th, which, having halted at Dildee for two hours, did not arrive until between eight and nine in the evening, wetted of course to the skin. We now felt bitterly the inconvenience of not having even one change of clothes with us. It could, however, have hardly been foreseen that, after having had only two or three showers since we arrived in Abyssinia, we were to be exposed to heavy rains regularly every day, which has, with one exception, been the case for the last week. As it is, it is impossible to say how long we shall be in our present state of only having the clothes we stand in. It is a week since we left our little all behind us at Lât. We are still a week’s march from Magdala, and may calculate on being fully a month without our baggage. Officers have all managed somehow to bring on a second shirt and pair of stockings; but the soldiers have no change of any kind. For them, and indeed for the officers, to be wetted through day after day, and to have no dry clothes to put on, and this at an altitude of 11,000 feet above the sea, and when the cold at night is more pierceing than anything I ever experienced, is trying in the extreme, and a great many are already complaining of rheumatic pains. That night {{at the top of}} the hill was the most unpleasant that officers or men have passed since their arrival in the country: wet through, cold, and lying upon ground so steep that we kept perpetually sliding down off our waterproof sheet. As to lying in the orthodox fashion, side by side, with all the heels close to the pole, like the spokes of a wheel, the thing was simply impossible. In many of the tents the men’s feet would have been a yard higher than their heads. However, there were few grumblings at the discomfort; but I can answer that I for one was greatly pleased when I saw daylight break, to get up from my uncomfortable sliding couch. We were ordered to start at eight, but the men’s things were still so wet that the march was postponed for two hours, to allow the blankets and greatcoats to be dried in the wind and sun.|$|E
