5|$|Banksia canei lacks a {{lignotuber}} {{and appears}} to regenerate from bushfire by seed, although its response to fire has been little studied. The follicles remain closed until burnt, although some do open spontaneously after five years or so. The fungus Banksiamyces toomansis, of the order Helotiales, infects older cones and seed, and hence seed older than about five years <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>not</b> viable. Plectronidium australiense is a species of anamorphic fungus that was recovered from a dead branch of B. canei at Healesville Sanctuary and described in 1986.|$|E
5|$|Dilation and {{curettage}} or an {{endometrial biopsy}} {{are used to}} obtain a tissue sample for histological examination. Endometrial biopsy is the less invasive option, {{but it may not}} give conclusive results every time. Hysteroscopy only shows the gross anatomy of the endometrium, which <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>not</b> indicative of cancer, and is therefore not used, unless in conjunction with a biopsy. Hysteroscopy can be used to confirm a diagnosis of cancer. New evidence shows that D has a higher false negative rate than endometrial biopsy.|$|E
5|$|Female {{sexuality}} <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>not</b> adequately {{represented in}} texts and documents. Until very recently, {{much of what}} has been documented about women's sexuality has been written by men, in the context of male understanding, and relevant to women's associations to men—as their wives, daughters, or mothers, for example. Often artistic representations of female sexuality suggest trends or ideas on broad scales, giving historians clues as to how widespread or accepted erotic relationships between women were.|$|E

5|$|In 1819, {{smoke was}} {{observed}} at the mountain. However, this <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>not</b> recorded as an eruption as the information was insufficient to identify it as such.

5|$|Similar to humans, gray wolves have facial color {{patterns}} {{in which the}} gaze direction can be easily identified, although this <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>not</b> the case in other canid species. In 2014, a study compared the facial color pattern across 25 canid species. The results suggested that the facial color pattern of canid species is related to their gaze communication, and that especially gray wolves use the gaze signal in conspecific communication.|$|E

5|$|The formal {{oxidation}} {{number in}} boranes is positive, {{and is based}} on the assumption that hydrogen is counted as −1 as in active metal hydrides. The mean oxidation number for the borons is then simply the ratio of hydrogen to boron in the molecule. For example, in diborane B2H6, the boron oxidation state is +3, but in decaborane B10H14, it is 7/5 or +1.4. In these compounds the oxidation state of boron <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>not</b> a whole number.|$|E

In places, the Greek characters are unclear and have been subject to much speculation by art historians, not least due to vanEyck's sometimes erratic spelling and unusual spacing.|$|E
5|$|There are {{significantly}} fewer bughouse openings {{than there are}} chess openings. Many chess openings create weaknesses which can be easily exploited in bughouse. It is for instance not recommended to move pawns other than the d- and e-pawns. Bughouse openings are generally geared towards dominating vital squares and fast development. Captured pieces become available {{after the first few}} moves and it is important to develop at this stage as there <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>not</b> enough time to do so later. Development also helps to defend against early piece drop attacks.|$|E

5|$|Although chest {{radiography}} {{is an important}} part of the diagnosis, it <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>not</b> sensitive enough to detect the condition early after the injury. In a third of cases, pulmonary contusion is not visible on the first chest radiograph performed. It takes an average of sixhours for the characteristic white regions to show up on a chest X-ray, and the contusion may not become apparent for 48hours. When a pulmonary contusion is apparent in an X-ray, it suggests that the trauma to the chest was severe and that a CT scan might reveal other injuries that were missed with X-ray.|$|E
5|$|Prolonged {{exposure}} to high inspired fractions of oxygen causes {{damage to the}} retina. Damage to the developing eye of infants exposed to high oxygen fraction at normal pressure has a different mechanism and effect from the eye damage experienced by adult divers under hyperbaric conditions. Hyperoxia may be a contributing factor for the disorder called retrolental fibroplasia or retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) in infants. In preterm infants, the retina <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>not</b> fully vascularised. Retinopathy of prematurity occurs {{when the development of}} the retinal vasculature is arrested and then proceeds abnormally. Associated with the growth of these new vessels is fibrous tissue (scar tissue) that may contract to cause retinal detachment. Supplemental oxygen exposure, while a risk factor, is not the main risk factor for development of this disease. Restricting supplemental oxygen use does not necessarily reduce the rate of retinopathy of prematurity, and may raise the risk of hypoxia-related systemic complications.|$|E
5|$|The Legend of Zelda is {{considered}} a spiritual forerunner of the modern role-playing video game (RPG) genre. Though it <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>not</b> {{considered part of the}} genre since it lacked key RPG mechanics such as experience points, it had many features in common with RPGs and served as the template for the action role-playing game genre. The game's fantasy setting, musical style and action-adventure gameplay were adopted by many RPGs. Its commercial success helped lay the groundwork for involved, non-linear games in fantasy settings, such as those found in successful RPGs, including Crystalis, Soul Blazer, Square's Seiken Densetsu series, Alundra, and Brave Fencer Musashi. The popularity of the game also spawned several clones trying to emulate the game.|$|E

5|$|The {{protective}} effect {{does not begin}} immediately, and people visiting areas where malaria exists usually start taking the drugs one to two weeks before arriving and continue taking them for four weeks after leaving (except for atovaquone/proguanil, which only needs to be started two days before and continued for seven days afterward). The use of preventative drugs <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>not</b> practical for {{those who live in}} areas where malaria exists, and their use is usually only in pregnant women and short-term visitors. This is due to the cost of the drugs, side effects from long-term use, and the difficulty in obtaining anti-malarial drugs outside of wealthy nations. During pregnancy, medication to prevent malaria has been found to improve the weight of the baby at birth and decrease the risk of anemia in the mother. The use of preventative drugs where malaria-bearing mosquitoes are present may encourage the development of partial resistance.|$|E
5|$|The use of props in Noh is minimalistic and stylized. The most {{commonly}} used prop in Noh is the fan, as it is carried by all performers regardless of role. Chorus singers and musicians may carry their fan in hand when entering the stage, or carry it tucked into the obi (the sash). The fan is usually placed at the performer's side {{when he or she}} takes position, and <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>not</b> taken up again until leaving the stage. During dance sequences, the fan is typically used to represent any and all hand-held props, such as a sword, wine jug, flute, or writing brush. The fan may represent various objects {{over the course of a}} single play.|$|E
5|$|Of {{near miss}} events, {{obstetrical}} fistulae (OF), including vesicovaginal and rectovaginal fistulae, remain {{one of the}} most serious and tragic. Although corrective surgery is possible it <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>not</b> available and OF is considered completely preventable. If repaired, subsequent pregnancies will require cesarian section. While unusual in developed countries, it is estimated that up to 100,000 cases occur every year in the world, and that about 2 million women are currently living with this condition, with the highest incidence occurring in Africa and parts of Asia. OF results from prolonged obstructed labor without intervention, when continued pressure from the fetus in the birth canal restricts blood supply to the surrounding tissues, with eventual fetal death, necrosis and expulsion. The damaged pelvic organs then develop a connection (fistula) allowing urine or feces, or both, to be discharged through the vagina with associated urinary and fecal incontinence, vaginal stenosis, nerve damage and infertility. Severe social and mental consequences are also likely to follow, with shunning of the women. Aprt from lack of access to care, causes include young age, and malnourishment. The UNFPA has made prevention of OF a priority and is the lead agency in the Campaign to End Fistula, which issues annual reports and the United Nations observes May 23 as the International Day to End Obstetric Fistula every year. Prevention includes discouraging teenage pregnancy and child marriage, adeaquate nutrition, and access to skilled care, including caesarian section.|$|E
