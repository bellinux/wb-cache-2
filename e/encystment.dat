2500|$|The {{life cycle}} of F. magna is {{relatively}} complex and {{is similar to the}} development of the related fluke, F. hepatica. A detailed account of the F. magna life cycle was given by Swales (1935), Erhardová-Kotrlá (1971), and reviewed by Pybus (2001).Adult flukes occur in pairs or groups within a fibrous [...] in the liver parenchyma of the definitive host. Mature flukes release eggs which are collected in the cavity of the capsule. The capsule contains a great mass of eggs and has duct connections to bile ducts. The eggs are passed together with bile into the bile collecting system, enter the small intestine, and leave the definitive host along with the faeces. The eggs which are passed out in the faeces into the environment are undeveloped and undergo embryonation outside the host. Several physical-chemical factors, especially temperature, humidity and oxygen tension, are known to influence embryonation. During the embryonation of the egg, a larva called a miracidium develops from germinal cells. Fully developed miracidium releases the operculum of the egg using several proteases. The embryonation period varies from 27 to 44 days in natural conditions. Ciliated miracidia hatch in water and actively seek suitable intermediate hosts that are freshwater snails from family Lymnaeidae. After attaching to a suitable snail host, the miracidium penetrates into the snail body. After shedding its ciliated cell layer it is called a sporocyst. The sporocysts are found in the foot, the snail body, digestive glands, reproductive organs, and in the pulmonary sac of the snail. The sporocysts contain germinal cells that give rise to 1-6 mother rediae (a trematode larval form with an oral sucker). Developed mother rediae are released from the sporocyst and migrate into digestive glands, renal organ, reproductive organs, and pulmonary sac of the snail body. Each mother redia can asexually produce up to 10 daughter rediae. However, only 3 to 6 daughter rediae complete their development and leave the mother rediae. In turn, each daughter redia may produce 1-6 Trematode lifecycle stages#Typical lifecyle stagescercariae in experimentally infected snails and 16-22 cercariae under natural conditions. Cercariae emerge from the rediae and mature usually in digestive glands of the snail. Mature cercarie spontaneously emerge from the snail host and swim actively in water for up to two hours before encysting on vegetation. After <b>encystment</b> the flukes are called metacercariae. Development within the snail takes 40 to 69 days depending upon the temperature and the species of snail. The definitive host ingests vegetation containing the metacercariae. In the stomach and the intestine, the metacercariae are stimulated to emerge from the cyst (excystation). Newly excysted juvenile flukes penetrate the wall of the intestine and migrate in the abdominal cavity. Juvenile flukes penetrate the Glisson’s capsule of the liver and continue migrating in the liver tissue. Rarely juvenile flukes penetrate other organs, such as lungs or kidneys. In these organs, however, flukes do not survive and not attain maturity. In the liver, flukes migrate within the parenchyma to search another fluke. If the fluke meet another one, they stop moving, and the fibrous capsule is formed around them. In the capsule, the parasite completes its development and starts egg-laying. Prepatent period varies 3–7 months and is dependent on host species. Adult F. magna can survive in the liver of the host up to 7 years.|$|E

50|$|In {{bacteria}} (for instance, Azotobacter sp.), <b>encystment</b> occurs {{by changes}} in the cell wall; the cytoplasm contracts and the cell wall thickens.

50|$|Colpoda inflata proliferates by mitosis, {{resulting}} in cells that can either form fully developed division cysts (trophonts) or resting cysts. Resting cysts are globular and differ from division cysts by their mucous layer containing many yellow globules and their tolerance for harsh environmental conditions like low nutrient levels.

50|$|The paired gamonts form a {{membrane}} around themselves (<b>encystment)</b> - {{a process}} known as syzygy. The resulting gametocyst is usually spherical in shape. Within the gametocyst the gamonts give rise to gametes which may be of similar size (isogametes) or different sizes (anisogametes). The gametes fuse in pairs and give rise to a zygote - the only diploid stage in the life cycle. The zygote forms an oocyst and within the oocyst, the sporozoites develop. The oocysts leave the gametocyst either via the latter's rupture or via sporoducts.|$|E
5000|$|Female Trichinella worms {{live for}} about six weeks, {{and in that time}} can produce up to 1,500 larvae; when a spent female dies, she passes out of the host.

In some cases, accidental migration to specific organ tissues can cause myocarditis and encephalitis that can result in death.|$|E
5000|$|The worms {{can survive}} with little oxygen by waving hemoglobin-rich tail ends to exploit all {{available}} oxygen, and can exchange {{carbon dioxide and}} oxygen through their thin skins, {{in a manner similar}} to frogs. They can also survive in areas heavily polluted with organic matter that almost no other species can endure. By forming a protective cyst and lowering its metabolic rate, T. tubifex can survive drought and food shortage. <b>Encystment</b> may also function in the dispersal of the worm.They usually inhabit the bottom sediments of lakes, rivers, and occasionally sewer lines and outlets.|$|E
50|$|A {{microbial}} cyst is a resting or dormant {{stage of}} a microorganism, usually a bacterium or a protist or rarely an invertebrate animal, that helps the organism to survive in unfavorable environmental conditions. It {{can be thought of}} as a state of suspended animation in which the metabolic processes of the cell are slowed down and the cell ceases all activities like feeding and locomotion. <b>Encystment</b> also helps the microbe to disperse easily, from one host to another or to a more favorable environment. When the encysted microbe reaches an environment favorable to its growth and survival, the cyst wall breaks down by a process known as excystation.|$|E
50|$|Choanoflagellates grow vegetatively, {{with many}} species {{undergoing}} longitudinal fission; however, the reproductive {{life cycle of}} choanoflagellates remains to be elucidated. Currently, {{it is unclear whether}} there is a sexual phase to the choanoflagellate life cycle, and the ploidy level is unknown; however, the discovery of both retrotransposons and key genes involved in meiosis suggests that they are cryptically sexual. Interestingly, some choanoflagellates can undergo <b>encystment,</b> which involves the retraction of the flagellum and collar and encasement in an electron dense fibrillar wall. On transfer to fresh media, excystment occurs; though it remains to be directly observed. Further examination of the choanoflagellate life cycle will be informative about mechanisms of colony formation and attributes present before the evolution of animal multicellularity.|$|E
50|$|Asexual {{phase in}} adult anuran host. The basic opaline life cycle {{begins with the}} large, multinucleate trophonts in the adult anuran cloaca. Through much of the year, the trophonts grow and divide {{continually}} to yield more trophonts. Nuclear divisions maintain the appropriate number of nuclei during this phase. As the host's breeding season approaches, the trophonts enter a phase known as palintomy -- a series of cell divisions {{with little or no}} overall growth or nuclear divisions. The resulting opalines, which become gradually smaller with fewer nuclei per individual, are called tomonts. At some point the small tomonts undergo <b>encystment,</b> and the cysts are released into the environment (i.e. the breeding pool of the anuran host) along with the feces.|$|E

50|$|Algae are {{the primary}} natural source of {{astaxanthin}} in the aquatic food chain. Currently, the primary industrial source for natural astaxanthin is the microalgae Haematococcus pluvialis. Haematococcus pluvialis seems to accumulate {{the highest levels of}} astaxanthin in nature. Commercially, more than 40 g of astaxanthin can be obtained from one kg of dry biomass. Haematococcus pluvialis has the advantage of the population doubling every week, which means scaling up is not an issue. However, it does require some expertise to grow the algae with a high astaxanthin content. Specifically, the microalgae are grown in two phases. First, in the green phase, the cells are given an abundance of nutrients to promote proliferation of the cells. In the subsequent red phase, the cells are deprived of nutrients and subjected to intense sunlight to induce <b>encystment</b> (carotogenesis), during which the cells produce high levels of astaxanthin as a protective mechanism against the environmental stress. The cells, with their high concentrations of astaxanthin, are then harvested.|$|E
50|$|Protists, {{especially}} protozoan parasites, {{are often}} exposed to very harsh conditions {{at various stages}} in their life cycle. For example, Entamoeba histolytica, a common intestinal parasite that causes dysentery, has to endure the highly acidic environment of the stomach before it reaches the intestine and various unpredictable conditions like desiccation and lack of nutrients while it is outside the host. An encysted form is well suited to survive such extreme conditions, although protozoan cysts are less resistant to adverse conditions compared to bacterial cysts. In addition to survival, the chemical composition of certain protozoan cyst walls {{may play a role}} in their dispersal. The sialyl groups present in the cyst wall of Entamoeba histolytica confer a net negative charge to the cyst which prevents its attachment to the intestinal wall thus causing its elimination in the feces. Other protozoan intestinal parasites like Giardia lamblia and Cryptosporidium also produce cysts as part of their life cycle (see oocyst). In some protozoans, the unicellular organism multiplies during or after <b>encystment</b> and releases multiple trophozoites upon excystation.|$|E
50|$|When organisms were well-fed, they {{appeared}} as 4-zooid-2-nuclei pseudocolonies, and during vegetative reproduction doubled number of zooids followed by nuclei division leading to 8-zooid-4-nuclei stage with further transverse binary division into two 4-zooid-2-nuclei Polykrikos. Gamete formation was particular as pseudocolony produces 4 gametes {{of different sizes}} and morphologies than vegetative cells. Vegetative form doubled zooids and subsequently split into four gametes of a 2-zooid-1-nucleus form. Two gametes further paired up with their ventral sides and fused forming a planozygote. For P. kofoidii two copulation finger-shaped structures were observed in gametes that are presumably involved in gamete contact and fusion, but more data is needed to confirm this. The ventrally fused gametes required a complex rearrangement of eight flagella and formation of sulci and cinguli. The 4-zooid planozygote had only one nucleus and had two developmental pathways depending on food availability. Under starvation conditions the planozygote disassembled into two 2-zooid with one lacking nucleus, but further fate was not examined. Under culture conditions most organisms undergone meiosis and directly entered vegetative cycle. Very few planozygotes went through a resting cyst stage. The cyst stage persisted for 1 month, which is considered as {{a relatively short period}} in comparison to other dinoflagellates, which obligate dormancy period may reach up to 6 month. The duration of <b>encystment</b> is associated with ecological foraging strategies. Short dormancy period could facilitate rapid cycling between life cycle stages that could be beneficial to heterotrophic species in case of fluctuating food availability. However, possibility of chemical signalling involved in cyst hatching for Polykrikos is yet to be determined.|$|E

40|$|This thesis aims to {{elucidate}} the molecular mechanism of indoleamine-induced <b>encystment</b> in dinoflagellates. Indoleamines such as melatonin and 5 -methoxytryptamine (5 MT) dose- and time-dependently induced <b>encystment</b> in {{many species of}} dinoflagellates. Such responses are reversible and liand-selective. Together, partial sequence homologous to the third intracellular loop of a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) was cloned, suggesting the presence of GPCRs in dinoflagellates. The involvement of G protein activation in <b>encystment</b> {{is suggested by the}} observation that mastoparan induced transient <b>encystment.</b> Immunodetection of Gα-like proteins and cloning of Gα-like partial sequences implicate the presence of novel G proteins in dinoflagellates. Depletion of extracellular Ca 2 + significantly diminished the indoleamine-induced <b>encystment.</b> Ca 2 + ionophores and Ca 2 +-ATPase inhibitors can mimick the indoleamine-induced <b>encystment.</b> Inactive indoleamines can antagonise 5 MT-induced Ca 2 + influx. Together, these results suggest that Ca 2 + acts as a second messenger for <b>encystment.</b> Indoleamines were shown to stimulate a phospholipase C pathway in dinoflagellates, leading to the formation of inositol phosphates (IF).

40|$|Acanthamoeba are {{ubiquitous}} protists {{that play}} an environmental role in regulating microbial diversity; they also occasionally cause infections {{of the eye}} (Acanthamoeba keratitis) and brain (granulomatous amoebic encephalitis). These organisms exhibit two distinct phenotypes. The trophozoite form dominates in favorable conditions, in which the Acanthamoeba move through the extension of pseudopodia, engulfing microbes and other particles. During stressful conditions, the Acanthamoeba undergo a process of <b>encystment,</b> in which they build a double cell wall and become relatively inactive. The cyst form can survive years until more favorable conditions arise, at which point they may excyst. For this study, multiple laboratory <b>encystment</b> methods were compared to determine the percent <b>encystment</b> and the different viabilities of laboratory-produced cysts. Furthermore, four different <b>encystment</b> genes were targeted for development of a primer library for reverse-transcription, polymerase chain reaction expression studies.

Results: Only PBS solutions with 0. 25 ppm polyaminopropyl biguanide (PAPB) and increasing concentrations of PG and POV stimulated A. castellanii <b>encystment</b> in a dose-dependent manner, whereas PBS solutions containing 3 % H 2 O 2 and increasing concentrations of PG and POV did not stimulate <b>encystment.</b> Borate-buffered saline and PBS/citrate solutions containing PG also did not stimulate <b>encystment.</b> In addition, no <b>encystment</b> was observed after 24  hours, 7 days, or 14 days of exposures of trophozoites to one-step H 2 O 2 contact lens disinfection products or related solutions.

The cellular levels of DNA, RNA, and protein; of lysosomal enzymes (acid phosphatase, acid proteinase); and of peroxisomal enzymes (catalase) were assayed during growth and the subsequent stationary phase that led eventually to <b>encystment.</b> Only DNA remained at a constant cellular level. <b>Encystment</b> of exponentially growing cells could also be initiated by washing them and introducing them into a soluble peptone medium.

40|$|Alginate is {{essential}} for <b>encystment</b> in Azotobacter vinelandii. Transcription of the algD gene, which codes for GDP-mannose dehydrogenase, a key enzyme in the alginate biosynthetic pathway, is initiated at two promoters, one of which, p 2, has ςE consensus sequences. AlgU is the A. vinelandii alternative ςE factor. In this study, we constructed an algU mutant (SMU 88) which, as expected, is impaired in alginate production, <b>encystment,</b> and transcription of the algD gene from the p 2 promoter. Plasmid pJMSAT 1, carrying the A. vinelandii algU gene, restored alginate production and <b>encystment</b> to SMU 88 and to strain UW 136, a naturally occurring algU mutant. Plasmid pSMU 865, carrying the A. vinelandii mucABCD genes coding for negative regulators of AlgU activity and previously shown to diminish alginate production in the wild-type strain, ATCC 9046, was shown here to impair <b>encystment</b> and transcription of the algD gene from the p 2 algU-dependent promoter. Since nonencysting strain ATCC 9046 /pSMU 865 produced more alginate than some encysting strains, such as UW 136 /pJMSAT 1, we propose an AlgU role in <b>encystment,</b> independent of the structural role that alginate plays in mature cysts...|$|E
40|$|Aims:  This study {{investigate}}s {{the effects of}} biguanides during <b>encystment</b> of Acanthamoeba castellanii. Methods and Results:  A non-nutrient <b>encystment</b> system was used to investigate {{the changes in the}} levels of sorption (uptake) of three non-cysticidal concentrations (10, 20 and 50 μg ml− 1) of chlorhexidine diacetate (CHA) and polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB) as well as their effects on viability and leakage of pentose sugars during the first 36 h of <b>encystment.</b> Trophozoites treated with CHA or PHMB were more sensitive and generally sorbed more of each biocide than cysts. During <b>encystment,</b> the largest increases in resistance developed between 18 and 36 h for both biguanides with the resistance emerging to biguanide concentrations of 10 or 20 μg ml− 1 between 18 and 24 h. At 50 μg ml− 1 resistance emerged between 24 and 36 h. There was a general decrease in biocide sorption during <b>encystment</b> between 0 – 24 and 0 – 21 h for CHA and PHMB, respectively, at a concentration of 50 μg ml− 1. The greatest decline in biguanide-induced pentose leakage was between 0 and 12 h. Conclusions:  The results suggest that during <b>encystment</b> some of the changes in the susceptibility to CHA or PHMB may be related to decreases in the levels of biocide sorption, which is limited by the developing cyst wall. Significance and Impact of the Study:  During encystation, changes occur in biguanide sensitivity. The physical barrier of the cyst wall may be an important factor in limiting biocide sorption...|$|E
40|$|Tardigrades {{have two}} forms of dormancy, namely {{cryptobiosis}} and <b>encystment.</b> The <b>encystment</b> {{is a form of}} diapause known for a limited number of species of tardigrades and still little studied. To increase the knowledge on <b>encystment,</b> two species of eutardigrades from Italy have been considered: the moss-dwelling Amphibolus volubilis (Eohypsibiidae), and the limnic Dactylobiotus parthenogeneticus (Murrayidae). Cysts have been collected in nature, or induced under laboratory conditions. In the latter case, it was possible to follow the several steps of <b>encystment</b> processes. Two different types of cyst (type 1 and type 2) have been found in A. volubilis, while in D. parthenogeneticus only one type has been found. In general, the ovoid-shaped cysts are constituted by a series of cuticles surrounding the animals and resemble an onion or a Matrioshka Russian doll. In all three types of cyst, the <b>encystment</b> processes show both common and peculiar traits. <b>Encystment</b> begins with the discharging of the sclerified parts of the buccal-pharyngeal apparatus, as in the molting process, but without the loss of the old cuticle. Then, two or three new cuticles are serially synthesized, according to cyst type. In A. volubilis, the ultrastructure of these new cuticular involucra {{is similar to that of}} non-encysted animal cuticles, while in D. parthenogeneticus the ultrastructure of the new cuticular involucra differs from that of non-encysted animal cuticle. A modified buccal-pharyngeal apparatus has been observed both in type 2 cyst of A. volubilis and in the D. parthenogeneticus cyst...|$|E
40|$|International audienceFree-living amoebae are {{protozoa}} {{found in}} soil and water. Among them, some are pathogenic {{and many have}} been described as potential reservoirs of pathogenic bacteria. Their cell cycle is divided in at least two forms: the trophozoite and the cyst and the differentiation process is named <b>encystment.</b> As cysts are more resistant to disinfection treatments than trophozoites, many studies focused on <b>encystment</b> but until recently little was known about cellular, biochemical and molecular modifications operating during this process. Important signals and signaling pathways at play during <b>encystment</b> have been described, as well as cell responses at the molecular level.
