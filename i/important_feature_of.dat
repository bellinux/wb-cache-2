5|$|An <b>important</b> <b>feature</b> <b>of</b> anti-de Sitter {{space is}} its {{boundary}} (which {{looks like a}} cylinder {{in the case of}} three-dimensional anti-de Sitter space). One property of this boundary is that, locally around any point, it looks just like Minkowski space, the model of spacetime used in nongravitational physics.|$|E

5|$|Nittany Furnace, known earlier as Valentine Furnace, was a {{hot blast}} iron furnace located in Spring Township, Centre County, Pennsylvania, United States. Placed in {{operation}} in 1888 {{on the site of}} an older furnace, it was an <b>important</b> <b>feature</b> <b>of</b> Bellefonte economic life until it closed in 1911, no longer able to compete with more modern steel producers.|$|E
5|$|The Shapley–Folkman lemma enables {{researchers}} to extend results for Minkowski sums of convex sets to sums of general sets, which {{need not be}} convex. Such sums of sets arise in economics, in mathematical optimization, and in probability theory; {{in each of these}} three mathematical sciences, non-convexity is an <b>important</b> <b>feature</b> <b>of</b> applications.|$|E

5|$|The left-wing preoccupations {{were also}} an <b>important</b> <b>feature</b> <b>of</b> Libertatea. Its opening {{manifesto}} {{called for a}} large-scale social reform, which it claimed {{was more important to}} Romanians than any National Liberal project to recover Transylvania from its Austro-Hungarian overlord. It enlisted contributions, generally less political than those at Seara, from literary figures such as Vinea, Demostene Botez, I. Dragoslav, Adrian Maniu and I. C. Vissarion.|$|E
5|$|The missing depth is not {{the only}} factor that the critics deplore. An <b>important</b> <b>feature</b> <b>of</b> Michelangelo's work which, in many places, has {{disappeared}} forever is the painting of the eyeballs.

5|$|An <b>important</b> <b>feature</b> <b>of</b> English cathedrals, {{uncommon}} elsewhere {{except in}} Normandy, {{is the large}} and often elaborate square central tower over the crossing. The larger of these towers range from 55 metres (182ft) at Wells to 82.5 metres (271ft) at Lincoln. The central tower may exist as a single feature as at Salisbury, Gloucester, Worcester, Norwich and Chichester or in combination with paired towers at the west front as at York, Lincoln, Canterbury, Durham and Wells. Among the cathedrals that have three towers, the central tower is usually much the tallest. At Southwell the two western towers are capped by pyramidal spires sheathed in lead.|$|E

5|$|Radioactive {{substances}} can harm {{human health}} via (i) local skin contamination, (ii) internal exposure due to ingestion of radioactive isotopes, and (iii) external overexposure by β-activity and γ-radiation. Together with radium and transuranium elements, actinium {{is one of}} the most dangerous radioactive poisons with high specific α-activity. The most <b>important</b> <b>feature</b> <b>of</b> actinium is its ability to accumulate and remain in the surface layer of skeletons. At the initial stage of poisoning, actinium accumulates in the liver. Another danger of actinium is that it undergoes radioactive decay faster than being excreted. Adsorption from the digestive tract is much smaller (~0.05%) for actinium than radium.|$|E
5|$|An <b>important</b> <b>feature</b> <b>of</b> Western Chalukya roof {{art is the}} use of domical {{ceilings}} (not to {{be confused}} with the European types that are built of voussoirs with radiating joints) and square ceilings. Both types of ceilings originate from the square formed in the ceiling by the four beams that rest on four pillars. The dome above the four central pillars is normally the most attractive. The dome is constructed of ring upon ring of stones, each horizontally bedded ring smaller than the one below. The top is closed by a single stone slab. The rings are not cemented but held in place by the immense weight of the roofing material above them pressing down on the haunches of the dome. The triangular spaces created when the dome springs from the centre of the square are filled with arabesques. In the case of square ceilings, the ceiling is divided into compartments with images of lotus rosettes or other images from Hindu mythology.|$|E
5|$|Bache {{supported}} {{himself as}} an organist at the English Church, where the chaplain had previously known Bache's brother Edward. As {{his reputation as a}} performer grew, he also came into demand as a teacher. These two activities guaranteed financial security. He also became acquainted with several young gifted musicians, including fellow Liszt pupil Giovanni Sgambati and violinist Ettore Pinelli. During this time, Bache began exploring the two-piano repertoire, especially the arrangements of Liszt's symphonic poem Les préludes and Schubert's Wanderer Fantasy, which he performed with Sgambati in concert. The two-piano arrangements of Liszt's symphonic poems would become an <b>important</b> <b>feature</b> <b>of</b> Bache's concert series once he returned to England. He was also active in chamber music—the works he performed during this time include Chopin's cello sonata, the David-Pinelli Violin Variations, Mendelssohn's D minor piano trio, a piano trio by Anton Rubinstein and a Schumann violin sonata arranged for viola.|$|E

5|$|In 1793, {{following}} {{a survey of}} coastal defences in the southeast, approval was given for the positioning of infantry and artillery to defend the bay between Beachy Head and Hastings from attack by the French. Fourteen Martello Towers were constructed along the western shore of Pevensey Bay, continuing as far as Tower73, the Wish Tower at Eastbourne. Several of these towers survive: the Wish Tower is an <b>important</b> <b>feature</b> <b>of</b> the town's seafront and {{was the subject of}} a painting by James Sant RA, and part of Tower68 forms the basement of a house on St.Antony's Hill. Between 1805 and 1807, the construction took place of a fortress known as the Eastbourne Redoubt, which was built as a barracks and storage depot, and armed with 10cannons.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the old town, the city's district of Kazimierz is particularly notable for its many renaissance buildings and picturesque streets, {{as well as the}} historic Jewish quarter located in the north-eastern part of Kazimierz. Kazimierz was founded in the 14th century to the south-east of the city centre and soon became a wealthy, well-populated area where construction of imposing properties became commonplace. Perhaps the most <b>important</b> <b>feature</b> <b>of</b> medieval Kazimierz was the only major, permanent bridge (Pons Regalis) across the northern arm of the Vistula. This natural barrier used to separate Kazimierz from the Old Town for several centuries, while the bridge connected Kraków to the Wieliczka Salt Mine and the lucrative Hungarian trade route. The last structure at this location (at the end of modern Stradom Street) was dismantled in 1880 when the northern arm of the river was filled in with earth and rock, and subsequently built over.|$|E
5|$|Phagocytosis is an <b>important</b> <b>feature</b> <b>of</b> {{cellular}} {{innate immunity}} performed by cells called 'phagocytes' that engulf, or eat, pathogens or particles. Phagocytes generally patrol the body searching for pathogens, {{but can be}} called to specific locations by cytokines. Once a pathogen has been engulfed by a phagocyte, it becomes trapped in an intracellular vesicle called a phagosome, which subsequently fuses with another vesicle called a lysosome to form a phagolysosome. The pathogen is killed by the activity of digestive enzymes or following a respiratory burst that releases free radicals into the phagolysosome. Phagocytosis evolved {{as a means of}} acquiring nutrients, but this role was extended in phagocytes to include engulfment of pathogens as a defense mechanism. Phagocytosis probably represents the oldest form of host defense, as phagocytes have been identified in both vertebrate and invertebrate animals.|$|E

5|$|The Puget Sound Convergence Zone is an <b>important</b> <b>feature</b> <b>of</b> Seattle's weather. In the {{convergence}} zone, air arriving {{from the north}} meets air flowing in from the south. Both streams of air originate over the Pacific Ocean; airflow is split by the Olympic Mountains to Seattle's west, then reunited to the east. When the air currents meet, they are forced upward, resulting in convection. Thunderstorms caused by this activity are usually weak and can occur {{north and south of}} town, but Seattle itself rarely receives more than occasional thunder and small hail showers. The Hanukkah Eve Wind Storm in December 2006 is an exception that brought heavy rain and winds gusting up to , an event that was not caused by the Puget Sound Convergence Zone and was widespread across the Pacific Northwest.|$|E
5|$|The {{causes of}} {{schizophrenia}} {{are not well}} understood, but numerous abnormalities of brain structure have been reported. The most thoroughly investigated alterations involve the cerebral cortex, but effects on the hippocampus have also been described. Many reports have found reductions {{in the size of}} the hippocampus in schizophrenic subjects. The left hippocampus seems to be affected more than the right. The changes noted have largely been accepted to be the result of abnormal development. It is unclear whether hippocampal alterations play any role in causing the psychotic symptoms that are the most <b>important</b> <b>feature</b> <b>of</b> schizophrenia. It has been suggested that on the basis of experimental work using animals, hippocampal dysfunction might produce an alteration of dopamine release in the basal ganglia, thereby indirectly affecting the integration of information in the prefrontal cortex. It has also been suggested that hippocampal dysfunction might account for the disturbances in long-term memory frequently observed.|$|E
5|$|During {{the later}} Roman Empire, the {{principal}} military developments were attempts {{to create an}} effective cavalry force {{as well as the}} continued development of highly specialised types of troops. The creation of heavily armoured cataphract-type soldiers as cavalry was an <b>important</b> <b>feature</b> <b>of</b> the 5th-century Roman military. The various invading tribes had differing emphasis on types of soldiers—ranging from the primarily infantry Anglo-Saxon invaders of Britain to the Vandals and Visigoths, who had a high proportion of cavalry in their armies. During the early invasion period, the stirrup had not been introduced into warfare, which limited the usefulness of cavalry as shock troops because {{it was not possible to}} put the full force of the horse and rider behind blows struck by the rider. The greatest change in military affairs during the invasion period was the adoption of the Hunnic composite bow in place of the earlier, and weaker, Scythian composite bow. Another development was the increasing use of longswords and the progressive replacement of scale armour by mail armour and lamellar armour.|$|E
