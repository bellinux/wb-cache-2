For example, the enzyme CYP2C19 metabolises several drugs, such as the anti-clotting agent Clopidogrel, into their active forms. Some patients possess polymorphisms in specific places on the 2C19 gene that make poor metabolisers of those drugs; physicians can test for these polymorphisms and {{find out whether the}} drugs will be fully effective for that patient. Advances in molecular biology have helped show that some syndromes that were previously classed as a single disease are actually multiple subtypes with entirely different causes and treatments.

Each game uses a pre-defined set of ten {{questions}} from over seventy episodes, titled by the name of the show's fictional sponsor. Most questions are multiple choice, providing one correct and three incorrect answers, along with a short timer that starts once the question has been completely presented. All players play at the same time, entering their choice of answer before the 20 second timer runs out. If a player is correct, they get a base dollar amount plus a bonus defined by <b>how</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>they</b> answered, while if they miss the question, they lose a similar amount of money.

40|$|Solar flares often {{accelerate}} ions and electrons to relativistic energies. The {{details of}} the acceleration process are not well understood, but until recently the main trend was to divide the acceleration process into two phases. During the first phase elctrons and ions are heated and accelerated up to several hundreds of keV simultaneously with the energy release. These mildly relativistic electrons interact with the ambient plasma and magnetic fields and generate hard X-ray and radio radiation. The second phase, usually delayed from the first by several minutes, is responsible for accelerating ions and electrons to relativistic energies. Relativistic electrons and ions interact with the solar atmosphere or escape from the Sun and generate gamma ray continuum, gamma ray line emission, neutron emission or are detected in space by spacecraft. In several flares the second phase is coincident with {{the start of a}} type 2 radio burst that {{is believed to be the}} signature of a shock wave.

40|$|Abstract. In {{the musical}} chairs game MC(n,m), {{a team of}} n players plays against an adver-sarial {{scheduler}}. The scheduler wins if the game proceeds indefinitely, while termination after {{a finite number of}} rounds is declared a win of the team. At each round of the game each player occupies one of the m available chairs. Termination (and a win of the team) is declared as soon as each player occupies a unique chair. Two players that simultaneously occupy the same chair are said to be in conflict. In other words, termination (and a win for the team) is reached as soon as there are no conflicts. The only means of communication throughout the game is this: At every round of the game, the scheduler selects an arbitrary nonempty set of players who are currently in conflict, and notifies each of them separately that it must move. A player who is thus notified changes its chair according to its deterministic program. As we show, for m ≥ 2 n − 1 chairs the team has a winning strategy. Moreover, using topological arguments we show that this bound is tight. For m ≤ 2 n − 2 the scheduler has a strategy that is guaranteed to make the game continue indefinitely and thus win. We also have some results on additional interesting questions. For example, if m ≥ 2 n − 1 (so that the team can win), <b>how</b> <b>quickly</b> can <b>they</b> achieve victory...|$|R
