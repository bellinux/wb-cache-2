Giovinco started <b>in</b> <b>every</b> <b>single</b> match at the tournament, but Italy lost to eventual winners Germany 1–0 in a tightly contested semi-final.

5|$|The Portuguese shield rests {{over the}} armillary sphere. Except {{during the reign}} of Afonso I, it is present <b>in</b> <b>every</b> <b>single</b> {{historical}} flag, in one form or another. It is the prime Portuguese symbol as well as one of the oldest, with the first elements of today's shield appearing {{during the reign of}} Sancho I. The evolution of the Portuguese flag is inherently associated with the evolution of the shield.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the 1990s was marked by the supremacy of the Chicago Bulls, which saw them appear in six Finals. Coached by Phil Jackson and led by NBA superstar Michael Jordan, the Bulls won a title <b>in</b> <b>every</b> <b>single</b> appearance to the Finals from 1991 to 1998. Jordan was also the Finals MVP every time. The only other team to win championships during this period was the Houston Rockets, who went back-to-back in 1994 and 1995 during Jordan's initial retirement from professional basketball.|$|E

5|$|As {{you long}} ago wrote me, {{and told me}} personally, nay predicted, Jackson has thrown me overboard; he is not only unwilling to give me employment, as he promised after I {{declined}} a reelection to Congress, but has <b>in</b> <b>every</b> <b>single</b> instance refused office to my friends, and even respectful consideration to my letters of recommendation to others. Nor does he stop here. I am at this moment enduring the whole weight of the opposition to him, his friends, and the power and patronage of his government to break down myself and my friends in Virginia, and to prevent my reelection to the office I now fill. Without having much reputation for political matters, I have read those folks at Washington thoroughly... I am not of a temper to pocket insult, neglect, or injury. I have, my dear friend, determined on my course. I can be as silent and patient as any of my aboriginal ancestors, and like them I feel that vengeance would be sweet, but when the day of retribution shall come, it will be marked by {{the effects of the}} tomahawk. You must know that notwithstanding all efforts to prevent it I calculate on a reelection. Then I will begin to formulate a message in which, as you know, my own principles will be maintained.|$|E
5|$|The 2006–07 {{season was}} a {{learning}} experience for the young Arsenal squad and Fàbregas. The club again failed to secure any major honours and were defeated by city rivals Chelsea in the League Cup Final. Fàbregas, however, {{emerged as one of}} the key creative players for the team, playing <b>in</b> <b>every</b> <b>single</b> league game. He kick-started Arsenal's 2006–07 UEFA Champions League campaign when he scored a brace in a 3–0 win over Dinamo Zagreb in a qualifier match. In the Premier League, he notched up 13 assists, which was the second-highest total in the league. He ended the season with several individual honours, including the Golden Boy award, presented by the Italian paper TuttoSport, based on a poll of leading writers across Europe. He was also named in the 2006 UEFA Team of the Year, and named FA Premier League Player of the Month for January 2007. Additionally, he was nominated for both PFA Players' Player of the Year and PFA Young Player of the Year, although both awards went to Manchester United's Cristiano Ronaldo. In June 2007, he was named Arsenal's Player of the Season, taking in 60% of the votes.|$|E
5|$|The cup defeat {{prompted}} Wenger {{make changes}} to his squad. He signed young England internationals Richard Wright and Francis Jeffers, midfielder Giovanni van Bronckhorst from Rangers {{as a partner}} for Vieira, and convinced defender Sol Campbell to join from local rivals Tottenham Hotspur on a free transfer. Campbell's arrival strengthened a defence which {{was going through a}} transition phase from 1999 and 2001; Steve Bould and Nigel Winterburn moved on in this period, club graduate Ashley Cole displaced Sylvinho as Wenger's first choice left back, while Lauren acted as Lee Dixon's understudy. Midfielders Fredrik Ljungberg and Robert Pirès – brought in during preceding transfer windows, had now established themselves into the first team. The 2001–02 season brought much success as Wenger led Arsenal to the double once more. The crowning moment was the win against Manchester United at Old Trafford in the penultimate game of the season. Sylvain Wiltord scored the winning goal to secure the club's 12th league championship and third double; four days earlier, Arsenal beat Chelsea 2–0 in the 2002 FA Cup Final. The team scored <b>in</b> <b>every</b> <b>single</b> league fixture and were unbeaten away from home that season.|$|E

25|$|Corrall was a lower-order {{right-handed}} batsman and wicketkeeper and, at {{five feet}} and two inches, {{one of the}} smallest first-class cricketers. Having played for the second eleven since 1927, he made his first-class debut for Leicestershire in a single game in the 1930 season, against Cambridge University, in which he failed to make a dismissal. He returned to second eleven cricket for 1931 {{but at the end of}} that season Tom Sidwell, who had been the regular first-team wicketkeeper since before the First World War, retired. Corrall took over as the wicketkeeper in the 1932 season and played <b>in</b> <b>every</b> <b>single</b> Leicestershire first-class match that season, making 39 catches and 11 stumpings and batting at No 10 or No 11.|$|E

25|$|CBC Television, {{with its}} role as the {{publicly}} funded broadcaster, {{has at least one}} O <b>in</b> <b>every</b> <b>single</b> province, as well as CBC North serving the three territories as well as northern Quebec. While the majority of Canadians are served by CBC owned-and-operated stations, the CBC also has some privately owned affiliates, though the number has decreased over the years, particularly since the early 2000s. As of January 2017, no private CBC affiliates remain (the last such station disaffiliated in September 2016), and stations that have left the network since the mid-2000s have generally not been replaced. Indeed, the public broadcaster shut down most of its own TV rebroadcast transmitters in 2012, and now relies instead on cable and satellite carriage of its O in regions outside the largest markets.|$|E

When Firth left for Broadway, Dai Bradley took {{over the role of}} Alan in the London production, playing opposite Michael Jayston as Dr. Dysart. Tom Hulce replaced Firth during the Broadway run. The Broadway production ran for 1,209 performances. Marian Seldes appeared <b>in</b> <b>every</b> <b>single</b> performance of the Broadway run, first in the role of Hesther and then as Dora.

25|$|If a batsman {{has been}} {{dismissed}} <b>in</b> <b>every</b> <b>single</b> innings, then their {{total number of}} runs scored divided {{by the number of}} times they have been out gives exactly the average number of runs they score per innings.

If their scores have a geometric distribution then total number of runs scored divided by the number of times out is the maximum likelihood estimate of their true unknown average.|$|E
