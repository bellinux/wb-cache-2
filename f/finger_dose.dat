30|$|The total {{personal}} radioactivity dose during rinsing of the 68 Ge/ 68 Ga generator with 30  ml 0.05  M {{hydrochloric acid}} (originally required after > 72  h of no elution) {{was found to}} be 2  μSv. The personal radioactivity dose during the subsequent 68 Ga radiolabelling procedure observed was 1  μSv. This implies that one rinsing of the generator followed by a labelling procedure corresponds to 3  μSv. Unfortunately, we did not assess the <b>finger</b> <b>dose</b> during drawing of the final product into a syringe and during administration to the patient. For the specific purpose of evaluation of possible labelling strategies, however, this can be considered as less relevant because drawing into a syringe and administration to a patient will be required anyhow independent of the labelling strategy applied.|$|E
40|$|The {{radiation}} exposure of fingers, thyroid and eyes of workers handling radiopharmaceuticals during various nuclear medicine procedures {{was measured using}} thermoluminescent dosemeters. Dosemeters {{were placed on the}} finger tips of 19 workers on several different occasions for various procedures. Additionally, the routinely determined whole-body doses to various groups of workers were analysed. The <b>finger</b> <b>dose</b> measurements demonstrated clear differences between the various tasks, from 0. 0012 µGy MBq(- 1) (unpacking and installing (99) Mo/(99 m) Tc-generator) to 3. 0 µGy MBq(- 1) (syringe withdrawal, injection and waste handling of (18) F-FDG). As long as the worker was handling (99 m) Tc, the dose to the fingers was well below the ICRP dose limits, even when the activity was high. Special concern should, however, be devoted to the handling of (18) F, since the dose to the fingers could easily reach the dose limits. The estimated dose to eyes and thyroid was well below the dose limits. Since the introduction of the positron emission tomography/computed tomography facility, the annual whole-body dose has increased for those directly involved in the handling of (18) F. The annual whole-body dose of 0. 2 - 2. 5 mGy was, however, well below the dose limits...|$|E
40|$|The {{number and}} {{complexity}} of interventional radiological procedures and in particular catheter-directed liver interventions have increased substantially. The current study investigates the reduction of personal doses when using a dedicated radiation protection cabin (RPC) for these procedures. Operator and assistant doses were assessed for 3 series of 20 chemoinfusion/chemoembolisation interventions, including {{an equal number of}} procedures with and without RPC. Whole body <b>doses,</b> <b>finger</b> <b>doses</b> and doses at the level of knees and eyes were evaluated with different types of TLD- 100 Harshaw dosemeters. Dosemeters were also attached on the three walls of the RPC. The operator doses were significantly reduced by the RPC, but also without RPC, the doses appear to be limited as a result of thorough optimisation with existing radiation protection tools. The added value of the RPC should thus be determined by the outcome of balancing dose reduction and other aspects such as ergonomic benefits. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{radiation}} safety {{issues in the}} application of radioguided sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy are discussed, particularly the effective dose (ED) for patients undergoing lymphoscintigraphy by taking into account both the internal emission and the external transmission dose. The quantitative result can be compared with other common radiological examinations. Whole body and <b>finger</b> <b>doses</b> of surgical and pathology staff were determined by direct measurement using high-sensitivity thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs) and compared with the annual dose limits recommended by the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP). These dosimetric observations for personnel also provide reference information to implement guidelines for the safe handling, storage, and transport of radioactive specimens at all stages of the radioguided surgery effort in order to maintain good work practices while dealing with unsealed radioactive substances. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|Introduction: 90 Y-Zevalin {{labeling}} {{may cause}} severe finger radiation exposure, especially in high-dose protocols (HD-Zevalin), where up to 7. 4 GBq could be injected. In this work, we optimized the labeling of HD-Zevalin with special regard to simplicity, speed, safety and radiation protection. Methods: Factors influencing labeling outcome (activity, specific activity, time, final volume, stability) were studied separately. The critical {{steps of a}} standard radiolabeling procedure were optimized to reduce finger exposure, developing an alternative labeling procedure and including a different 90 Y supplier. <b>Finger</b> <b>doses</b> were monitored by thermoluminescent dosimeters at each fingertip under anti-X gloves, considering both absolute values and values after normalization to 1. 48 GBq. Results: Labeling of 90 Y-Zevalin was safe and reproducible up to 7. 4 GBq with a simple and single-step procedure offering good stability for several hours. Radiolabeling specific activity was found critical, being kept at 740 MBqÂ·mg- 1. Radiochemical purity values â 8 ̆ 9 ¥ 98...|$|R
40|$|Workers {{performing}} {{preparation and}} administration of radiopharmaceuticals in NM departments {{are likely to}} receive high local skin doses to the hands which may even surpass the dose limit of 500 mSv whenever radiation protection standards are insufficient. A large measurement campaign was organised {{within the framework of}} the ORAMED project to determine the dose distribution across the hands received during preparation and administration of 18 F- and 99 mTc-labelled radiopharmaceuticals. The final data, collected over almost 3 years, include 641 measurements from 96 workers in 30 NM departments from 6 European countries. Results have provided levels of reference doses for the considered standard NM diagnostic procedures (mean maximum normalised skin dose of 230 μSv/GBq, 430 μSv/GBq, 930 μSv/GBq and 1200 μSv/GBq for the administration of 99 mTc, preparation of 99 mTc, administration of 18 F and preparation of 18 F, respectively). <b>Finger</b> <b>dose</b> was analysed as a function of the potential parameters of influence showing that shielding is the most efficient means of radiation protection to reduce skin dose. An appropriate method for routine monitoring of the extremities is also proposed: the base of the index finger of the non-dominant hand is a suitable position to place the ring dosemeter, with its sensitive part oriented towards the palm side; its reading may be multiplied by a factor of 6 to estimate the maximum local skin dose. Finally, results were compared to earlier published data, which correspond mostly to individual works with a reduced number of workers and measurements...|$|E
40|$|There are {{conflicting}} {{statements in}} the literature on the optimum shielding for beta emitting radionuclides. Perspex is commonly cited as reducing bremsstrahlung compared to lead. Other reports indicate lead can be used. Newer therapies require dispensing of large activities (> 1 GBq) and it is vital to minimize high finger doses. The shielding aspects for 90 Y and 32 P, two commonly used therapy radionuclides, have been investigated. Whole body doses and finger doses are examined, together with ergonomic aspects. The research highlights the difficulty in carrying out dose assessments and the disparity of the data in the literature. Three different assessment techniques were used: a) different types of TLDs; b) a variety of dose rate meters and c) spectral analysis with a germanium detector. The measurement and source geometries used were designed to replicate as far as possible those routinely encountered in the clinical environment. Investigations were carried out using three types of syringe shields for 10 ml and 1 ml syringes; Perspex, tungsten and a hybrid shield of plastic and lead. In all cases the hybrid shield is the optimum choice to reduce both <b>finger</b> <b>dose</b> and whole body exposure. However, ergonomically it is bulky which can result in longer handling times. This work identifies an improved shield design. The tungsten shield provides almost as much dose reduction and is preferred by operators. Tungsten shields are also normally routinely available in Nuclear Medicine departments. They are therefore considered a justifiable alternative. Although Perspex is still commonly recommended, both the tungsten and hybrid shields are superior to Perspex shields, {{with the exception of the}} 1 ml shield for 90 Y where Perspex was marginally better than tungsten. The other critical training issue highlighted is that finger doses can exceed statutory annual limits within seconds if staff handle unshielded syringes or vials of 90 Y or 32 P...|$|E
40|$|Many {{publications}} {{attest to}} {{the potential of the}} sentinel lymph node technique in advancing the clinical management of melanoma and, more recently, breast cancer. Whilst not yet universally regarded as the standard of care, the technique is gaining wide acceptance. Use of a radiolabelled colloidal tracer is central to optimising sensitivity, and this brings with it the need to address radiation safety issues relating to the use of radioactive materials in the operating theatre and pathology laboratory, and the generation of radioactive waste. The radiation dose to the patient should also be determined if the professional is to reassure the patient by placing this in its proper context. For the purpose of this investigation, biodistribution data were obtained from patient studies to quantify the migration of tracer beyond the injection site, thereby permitting a detailed assessment of the internal dosimetry of the tracer and the resulting radiation dose to the patient. Uptake of tracer in the sentinel nodes, reticulo-endothelial system and circulating blood was investigated. The radiation dose to surgical staff was recorded using whole-body monitors and extremity dosimeters worn at the fingers. Clinical waste in the operating theatre was monitored and the radioactive content of significantly contaminated items determined. The radiation dose to pathology staff was estimated from knowledge of the radioactive content of the specimens obtained and a study of work practices. Migration of tracer was found to be minimal, with greater than 95 % retention at the injection site. The effective dose resulting to the patient was 2. 1 x 10 - 2 mSv/MBq, with a mean breast dose of 7. 2 x 10 - 1 mGy/MBq. A mean whole-body dose of 0. 34 μSv was received by surgical staff per procedure, with a mean <b>finger</b> <b>dose</b> of 0. 09 mSv (90 μSv). Radiation doses received by pathology staff will be predominantly below measurable levels and are likely to be negligible unless primary specimens from a large number of studies are analysed promptly upon their excision. At operation, surgical swabs can become significantly contaminated and have been found to contain up to 22 % of the administered activity, dependent upon the surgical procedure performed. It is concluded that moderate activities of technetium- 99 m labelled tracer are administered to the patient, and the radiation risk to the patient is consequently low relative to that from many other medical exposures. The radiation doses to staff groups involved in all aspects of the technique are low, and under normal circumstances and levels of workload, routine radiation monitoring will not be required. Standard biohazard precautions prevent direct intake of radioactive contamination. Radioactive waste is created in the operating theatre, and may be generated in the pathology laboratory if specimens are not routinely stored until fully decayed. This will require special handling if the disposal of radioactive material is not permitted...|$|E

40|$|Radioembolisation (RE), with yttrium- 90 (90 Y) {{labelled}} microspheres, is {{an increasingly}} common treatment method for unresectable liver tumours. The tolerable mean absorbed dose for normal liver (NL) tissue {{is higher in}} RE than in External Beam Radiation Therapy (EBRT); absorbed dose heterogeneity {{is thought to be}} one important reason, together with a low absorbed dose rate, but the knowledge of microsphere distributions is limited. The aim of this thesis was to describe macroscopic and small-scale heterogeneity in the distribution of microspheres and consequently in absorbed dose, and to create a hepatic branching artery tree model, able to reproduce normal liver microsphere and absorbed dose distributions. Another aim was to develop and evaluate a method for prediction of absorbed dose to the surgeon’s hands during liver resection on still radioactive tissues. Two patients with marginally resectable cholangiocarcinoma underwent resection, nine days after RE with resin SIR-Spheres®. Considering radiation safety, simulation of absorbed dose to surgeon’s hands was performed with the software Varskin Mod 2 ® before surgery and absorbed dose rate measurements were done with thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLD) on resected tissue. The macroscopic sphere distribution within NL was investigated by gamma well chamber activity measurements on punch biopsies from sliced resected tissues and by calculating coefficient of variation (CV) and skewness (SK), in relation to biopsy mass. Small-scale heterogeneity in microsphere and absorbed dose distribution was studied by light microscopy and subsequent absorbed dose simulations by beta dose point kernel convolution. A branching artery tree model was used, to simulate microsphere and absorbed dose distributions. Tissue measurements and simulations of absorbed dose to surgeon’s hands showed similar results. The CV and SK of activity concentration, by gamma well chamber measurements, decreased rapidly with increasing mass and/or mean activity concentration. Aggregations of clusters increased in frequency and CV and SK for absorbed dose distribution increased with mean sphere concentration. The branching artery tree model was able to resemble the biopsy sphere and absorbed dose distributions. Expected absorbed dose to the surgeon’s hands was not alarming, but simulations and measurements of surgeon <b>finger</b> absorbed <b>dose</b> are recommended. Decreasing CV and SK for macroscopic distribution indicated a heterogeneous pattern larger than the punch biopsy masses investigated. Small-scale sphere and absorbed dose heterogeneity both increased with mean sphere concentration. The branching artery tree model helps to explain the distribution mechanism better than previous distribution models. The shown heterogeneity and the arterial tree model provide knowledge that may be helpful in optimising RE treatment, regarding number of injected spheres and activity per sphere...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{research}} has shown the potential of silicon carbide (SIC) power devices in power electronic applications. They are intensely studied because their on-state power dissipation is lower than conventional silicon power devices due to its superior material properties. The critical electric field of SiC is 10 times higher than Si. As a result, the Baliga Figure of Merit for SiC is roughly 400 times better. ^ Most of the {{research has}} focused on 4 H-SiC because of its higher and more isotropic electron mobility than other polytypes. Among many device structures proposed, Bipolar Junction Transistor (BJT) is projected to benefit from the conductivity modulation in the drift region and has a lower forward voltage drop than the unipolar theoretical limit. In this dissertation, physics of 4 H-SiC BJTs is discussed and simulations are performed to identify the key design issues such as <b>finger</b> length, JTE <b>dose</b> and width, and the gap between p+ implant and emitter finger. Large area (3 ̆e 1 mm 2) 4 H-SiC BJTs are fabricated and good I-V characteristics are observed (V CEO 3 ̆e 3, 000 V, β 3 ̆e 50). Because the BJT is a current drive device, additional power is dissipated in the drive current IB path. The control circuitry is also more complex than voltage drive devices such as MOSFETs. With increased current gain, these difficulties can be overcome. Boron base transistors (BBTs) are expected to have even higher current gain because boron in 4 H-SiC forms deeper accpertor levels than aluminum and has a lower ionization percentage at room temperature. Prelimenary emperimental results show that BBTs are suffering from the low carrier lifetime in the base. They exhibit current gain as low as 3 and large turn on voltage. However, from simulation, it is expected that current gain will improve and turn on voltage will reduce if the carrier lifetime can be improved. ...|$|R
40|$|Radiotherapy has {{commonly}} been utilised to cure cancer {{for more}} than a century. It is counted among the fundamental branches of medicine and represents an effective local or locally-regional method of curing both cancer and some non-cancerous conditions. It utilises ionising radiation which unfortunately eliminates tumour cells along with healthy ones. This is why a wide range of harmful effects of the radiation can be observed on humans. Patients treated with radiotherapy are in some cases monitored with dosimeters so that the intended dose can be compared with what is really absorbed. Nemocnice České Budějovice, a. s. monitors the dose in expected locations of non-homogeneous irradiation using the aforementioned TL dosimeters during the process of rotary irradiation of Mycosis fungoides. Before actually being used in an in vivo dosimetry, these dosimeters must be properly calibrated and have their sensitivity adjusted. Other than that, they are fairly easy to use, do not require much time or money invested and are able to constantly monitor the dose received by a patient treated with rotary irradiation. This diploma thesis discusses the usage of TL dosimeters to measure non-homogeneity of irradiation. It therefore compares the doses received by patients {{in various parts of the}} body during irradiation by the TSEI method. These 22 irradiated patients had thorough measurements taken of the doses they received in the so-called black hole region, their axillae and neck while holding their arms up and with arms loosely positioned close to the body. The thesis also suggests the possibility of the dosimeters being used by the integrated emergency service to assist during rescues and demolitions performed in emergency situations when a leak of ionising radiation occurs. Using TL dosimeters would mean more precise measurements of the dose received by the involved personnel in various parts of their body. If a patient is treated with the TSEI method, the dose received is monitored in a reference point, critical areas and areas with residual infiltrations or tumours. Doses measured in critical areas indicate that should the acral parts of limbs be left uncovered, they absorb larger doses than the rest of the body. They thus exceed the intended dose significantly. In the case of <b>fingers,</b> the <b>dose</b> tends to reach as much as 3 Gy. Depending on clinical picture, the attending physician determines whether special covering should be used. This covering reduces the doses received to merely a few tenths of a Gy. There also tends to be a large difference in absorbed doses in axillar areas and the neck, depending on whether the patient's arms are held up or close to the body respectively. Test results indicate that holding arms up or keeping them close to the body on a particular side have always had a profound effect on the dose absorbed by the patient in this particular area. This means that the position of the body greatly influences how much is absorbed in various parts of the body. TL dosimeters are also used in other areas than in vivo dosimetry in radiotherapy. An example of this could be determining the dose received in upper limbs of the workers monitored with thermoluminescent dosimeters in the form of bracelets or rings. They also serve to monitor the external irradiation of persons within the limits of the Czech Republic (TLD network). In radiation therapy, both the doses in skin and body are taken into account when conducting measurements. Depending on the data extracted, it is then possible to assess the course of treatment and ensure safe implementation of ionising radiation. Integrated emergency service teams deployed in cases of radiation emergencies are not considering using TL dosimeters so far, although they could most likely be used to ascertain the exact doses absorbed. Further research would however need to be conducted to either confirm or disprove the benefits of using TLD...|$|R
