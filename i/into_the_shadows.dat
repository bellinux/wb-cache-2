5|$|The {{company was}} founded by Swedish {{programmer}} Magnus Högdahl. Högdahl was {{a former member of}} the PC demoscene group Triton, and specialized in making tech demos. He decided to leave the company after his project, an action role-playing game named <b>Into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Shadows,</b> was cancelled. He then decided to found his own studio and began crafting his own game engine. He actively recruited staff among his acquaintances and the studio was officially established in 1998 in Härnösand, Sweden.|$|E

Those who had been unfaithful were turned away {{at the entrance to}} the new land and faded <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>shadows</b> to an unknown fate.|$|E
500|$|In {{order to}} carry out executions, players must {{approach}} a hunter from behind, undetected. To facilitate this, each scene is full of [...] "dark spots" [...] (shadows where the player can hide). Enemies cannot see <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>shadows</b> (unless they see the player actually entering the area). A standard technique in the game is {{to hide in the}} shadows and tap a wall {{to attract the attention of}} a nearby hunter. When the hunter has examined the area and is moving away, players can emerge from the shadows behind them, and execute them. The game has three levels of execution, with each level progressively more violent and graphic than the last: [...] "hasty" [...] executions are quick and not very bloody, [...] "violent" [...] are considerably more gory, and [...] "gruesome" [...] are over-the-top blood-soaked murders. Players are entirely in control of which level they use; once players have locked onto an enemy, the lock-on reticule changes color over time to indicate the three levels: white, yellow and red.|$|E
25|$|The term eclipse is {{most often}} used to {{describe}} either a solar eclipse, when <b>the</b> Moon's <b>shadow</b> crosses <b>the</b> Earth's surface, or a lunar eclipse, when <b>the</b> Moon moves <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Earth's <b>shadow.</b> However, it can also refer to such events beyond the Earth–Moon system: for example, a planet moving <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>shadow</b> cast by one of its moons, a moon passing <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>shadow</b> cast by its host planet, or a moon passing <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>shadow</b> of another moon. A binary star system can also produce eclipses if {{the plane of the}} orbit of its constituent stars intersects the observer's position.|$|R

2500|$|Hunt was undeniably {{bitter about}} what he {{perceived}} as President John F. Kennedy's lack of commitment in overthrowing the communist government of Cuba. In his semi-fictional autobiography, Give Us This Day, he wrote: [...] "The Kennedy administration yielded Castro all the excuse he needed to gain a tighter grip {{on the island of}} José Martí, then moved shamefacedly <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>shadows</b> and hoped the Cuban issue would simply melt away." ...|$|E

"Introducing Hercule Poirot, the {{brilliant}} – and eccentric – detective who, at a friend's request, {{steps out of}} retirement – and <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>shadows</b> of a classic mystery {{on the outskirts of}} Essex. The victim is the wealthy mistress of Styles Court, found in her locked bedroom with the name of her late husband on her dying lips. Poirot has a few questions for her fortune-hunting new spouse, her aimless stepsons, her private doctor, and her hired companion. The answers are positively poisonous. Who's responsible, and why, can only be revealed by the master detective himself." [...] (Book jacket, Berkley Book edition April 1984) ...|$|E
2500|$|In Vishal Bharadwaj's {{adaptation}} of Othello, Omkara, Basu {{played the role}} of Bianca and was a cameo. She caught the attention of public with her dance number [...] "Beedi", which was highly popular in India and overseas. Critic Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN wrote, [...] "... Bipasha Basu is brought in to lend oomph and she succeeds in doing just that." [...] Basu became {{the talk of the town}} for donning a bikini in Aditya Chopra's Dhoom 2. She reportedly ate only oranges for three days and trained hard to shoot the scene. Nikhat Kazmi of The Times of India commented, [...] "Aah Bipasha! Looks great, brings back the bikini to Bollywood, and gently slips <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>shadows</b> as a pretty accessory." ...|$|E
2500|$|Thirty {{years after}} the scandal broke, Amanda Marcotte {{suggested}} in The Daily Beast that [...] "we owe a lot to Vanessa Williams for being a pioneer {{when it comes to}} showing the world how to recover when you’ve been unjustly shamed for being sexual. Williams could have slunk off <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>shadows</b> in shame, which no doubt many people at the time expected her to do. Williams picked herself up and kept fighting for a career as an entertainer, first by becoming a successful singer and then becoming a well-known comic actress ... Sleazy people tried to drag Vanessa Williams down with accusations of being sexual 30 years ago, but she moved on, showing she had nothing to be ashamed of." [...] In addition, Williams commented on her ability to persevere after these events in a 2015 interview with Entertainment Tonight by stating that [...] "you can't give up ... you always have to remember what you're made of and not let circumstances get in the way. They might delay your progress for the moment, but you always have to remember who you are, and that will give you the eyes on the prize." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{individual}} {{stages of}} each Manhunt installment are typically {{referred to in}} a way that relates to the game's plot. In the first game, stages are called [...] "scenes," [...] which relates to the snuff film in which the protagonist is forced to participate. In the second game, stages are called [...] "episodes," [...] relating to the mental state and experiences of the protagonist, an escaped mental patient. In this vein, the gameplay itself in Manhunt 2 is referred to as [...] "treatment" [...] (for example, instead of a [...] "Load Game" [...] option from the main menu, the option is [...] "Continue Treatment"). Players survive the stages by dispatching enemies occasionally with firearms, but primarily by stealthly executing them, often in bloody over-the-top ways. In order to carry out executions, the player must approach an enemy from behind, undetected. To facilitate this, each stage in both games are full of [...] "dark spots" [...] (shadows where the player can hide). Enemies cannot see <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>shadows</b> (unless they see the player actually entering the area). A standard technique in both games is to hide in the shadows and tap a wall {{to attract the attention of}} a nearby enemy. When he has examined the area and is moving away, the player can emerge from the shadows behind him, and execute him.|$|E
2500|$|As Eva and Walther retreat further <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>shadows,</b> Beckmesser {{begins his}} serenade. Sachs {{interrupts}} him by launching into a full-bellied cobbling song, and hammering {{the soles of}} the half-made shoes. Annoyed, Beckmesser tells Sachs to stop, but the cobbler replies {{that he has to}} finish tempering the soles of the shoes, whose lateness Beckmesser had publicly complained about in Act 1. Sachs offers a compromise: he will be quiet and let Beckmesser sing, but he (Sachs) will be Beckmesser's [...] "marker", and mark each of Beckmesser's musical/poetical errors by striking one of the soles with his hammer. Beckmesser, who has spotted someone at Eva's window (Magdalena in disguise), has no time to argue. He tries to sing his serenade, but he makes so many mistakes (his tune repeatedly places accents on the wrong syllables of the words) that from the repeated knocks Sachs finishes the shoes. David wakes up and sees Beckmesser apparently serenading Magdalena. He attacks Beckmesser in a fit of jealous rage. The entire [...] neighborhood is awakened by the noise. The other apprentices rush into the fray, and the situation degenerates into a full-blown riot. In the confusion, Walther tries to escape with Eva, but Sachs pushes Eva into her home and drags Walther into his own workshop. Quiet is restored as abruptly as it was broken. A lone figure walks through the street – the nightwatchman, calling out the hour.|$|E
2500|$|Wes Craven {{said his}} {{inspiration}} for the basis of Freddy Krueger's power stemmed from several stories in the Los Angeles Times about a series of mysterious deaths: All the victims had reported recurring nightmares and died in their sleep. Additionally, Craven's original script characterized Freddy as a child molester, which Craven said was the [...] "worst thing" [...] he could think of. The {{decision was made to}} instead make him a child murderer in order to avoid being accused of exploiting the spate of highly publicized child molestation cases in California around the time A Nightmare on Elm Street went into production. Craven's inspirations for the character included a bully from his school during his youth, a disfigured homeless man who had frightened him when he was 11, and the 1970s pop song [...] "Dream Weaver" [...] by Gary Wright. In an interview, he said, [...] "When I looked down there was a man very much like Freddy walking along the sidewalk. He must have sensed that someone was looking at him and stopped and looked right into my face. He scared the living daylights out of me, so I jumped back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>shadows.</b> I waited and waited to hear him walk away. Finally I thought he must have gone, so I stepped back to the window. The guy was not only still looking at me but he thrust his head forward as if to say, 'Yes, I'm still looking at you.' The man walked towards the apartment building's entrance. I ran through the apartment to our front door as he was walking into our building on the lower floor. I heard him starting up the stairs. My brother, who is ten years older than me, got a baseball bat and went out to the corridor but he was gone." ...|$|E
