40|$|Reminiscence is {{proposed}} {{as an important}} activity for well-being in late life but recent reviews highlight the differential outcomes of this behavior. If older adults engage in reminiscing as a natural process, but do so with a ruminative style of thinking, it may actually be detrimental to successful development and well-being. This project explored the relationship between rumination, reminiscence, mood, and psychosocial development. One hundred and fifty community dwelling older adults completed measures assessing these variables. As expected, increased rumination was related to increased depressed mood. Fiftyfour of the participants completed a <b>follow-up</b> <b>measure</b> of depressed mood. Rumination also accounted for follow-up depressed mood beyond that explained by time- 1 mood. The interaction between rumination and reminiscing significantly predicted future depressed mood after controlling for main effects and baseline mood.

40|$|This study {{examined}} various client related {{factors that may}} predict problem gambling (PG) treatment outcomes (i. e., treatment completion and continued abstinence). Specifically, factors that may facilitate treatment (i. e., social support, self-efficacy, motivation, readiness for change, and emotion-focused coping) or hinder treatment (i. e., depression and life stress) were examined. The 50 participants were followed for four months after entering treatment for PG and were assessed at baseline, one month into treatment, two months into treatment, and during a follow-up four months after treatment began. Of the 50 participants, 20 dropped-out of treatment and 24 completed the <b>follow-up</b> <b>measure.</b> The results suggest that self-efficacy and depression, measured at baseline, are good predictors of one and two month outcomes, whereas depression and life stress, measured after two months of treatment, are good at predicting four month outcomes.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the urgent and <b>follow-up</b> <b>measures</b> in case of {{chlorine}} leak and a retrospective analysis of past cases. Chlorine is a widely used toxic gas. It is known from history as the first practically used warfare agent. Today, {{it is an important}} chemical raw material that is used widely in industry. It is also commonly transported by road and rail. It is one of the substances whose leakages occur very often. The objective {{of this paper is to}} assess the impacts of chlorine leakage on the lives and health of people and to provide an overview of urgent and <b>follow-up</b> <b>measures</b> in case of chlorine leakage in the perspective of the integrated rescue system and the general public. In addition, to locate, describe and analyze past cases. The theoretical part contains information about chlorine, the principles of behaviour of the population in case of an accident with chlorine leakage and an overview of measures undertaken at the site of chlorine leakage. Through studying available literature and resources on the Internet, overview of major chlorine leakages in the Czech Republic as well as abroad has been created. Selected events are described in detail. The practical part simulates, using computer programme called TerEx, a chlorine leakage from a water treatment plant in Písek, South Bohemia. To compare the results, several model situations were created with varying amounts of chlorine leaked at different times of accident and atmospheric conditions. A specific example is used to assess the risks to people living near the plant and to outline the urgent and <b>follow-up</b> <b>measures...</b>|$|E
40|$|The present {{investigation}} had two purposes. First, {{to examine whether}} {{a group of young}} competitive figure skaters could effectively learn and use mental training skills taught to them during a mental training program intervention. Second, to examine to what extent the skaters could learn and use the three primary mental training skill components from Orlick's heuristic model of personal excellence (i. e., imagery, focusing, and refocusing). A group of 17 female competitive figure skaters (mean age 13. 6 years) were divided into two groups [...] experimental 1 and experimental 2. Measures used to assess mental skills and trait anxiety were taken on three occasions [...] pre-test, post-simulation, and follow-up. The measures included both qualitative (short-answer and interview responses) and quantitative (Sport Competition Anxiety Test, Commitment to Sport and Self-Control Scales) methods of assessment. The pre-test measures were taken prior to any subjects receiving the mental training program. The post-simulation measures were taken after a simulated competition when only the experimental group 1 skaters had completed the mental training program. <b>Follow-up</b> <b>measures</b> were taken several months after all skaters (both experimental 1 and experimental 2) had received the mental training. Comparisons done between pre-test and post-simulation measures, and pre-test and <b>follow-up</b> <b>measures</b> were used to assess the effectiveness of the mental training program.

The main focus of this program was the promotion of exercise as an alternative behaviour to smoking. Methods: The applicability of the intervention was assessed through questionnaires regarding: (a) attitudes towards smoking, (b) interest in information about smoking, and (c) knowledge about health consequences of smoking. Moreover, interviews were taken from the educators and the school principals. The questionnaires were completed from 210 students (101 boys and 109 girls) before the beginning, at the end of the program, and 12 months after the completion of the programme. One-way repeated measure ANOVA was performed to examine the differences between the pre-, post-, and the <b>follow-up</b> <b>measures.</b> Results: Results showed that the program succeeded in changing the students' attitudes, but the <b>follow-up</b> <b>measures,</b> 12 months later, showed that attitudes towards smoking and interest in information were relapsed to the pre-intervention levels.

Method: This one-group pretest–posttest study included 5 children with ADHD and their parents, who had previously participated in a therapist-delivered play-based intervention.

In the present paper, we reported {{the case of}} a 39 year-old patient with chronic-hallucinatory schizophrenia who developed symptomatic pancreatitis during the clozapine dose titration performed to reach the therapeutic range. Diagnosis of pancreatitis was suggested by clinical examination and abnormal laboratory values of pancreatic enzymes and confirmed by C-T scan and ultrasonography. The causal incrimination of clozapine in this case seems likely as all other possible causes of pancreatitis were excluded, as AP developed shortly after the introduction of the drug and as the pancreatic enzymes normalized after clozapine was stopped. No rechallenge to confirm the causal relationship was however attempted. So far, only eight cases of acute pancreatitis have been reported in association with clozapine use. Clozapine is an atypical antipsychotic drug which belongs to the chemical class of dibenzodiazepines. The mechanism by which clozapine could produce acute pancreatitis remained unclear.
