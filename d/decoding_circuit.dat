40|$|Reliable and {{efficient}} {{transmission of data}} over a wireless network has been an increasing demand {{for the past few}} years. Whereas, major concern is the control of errors and to obtain reliable reproduction of data. This is achieved by using a variety of error control codes which improves BER performance in digital communication systems and are important in wireless information networks. Performance of Error correcting codes for a complete system analysis includes finding the reliability of coding and <b>decoding</b> <b>circuits</b> as this plays a significant role in undetected errors. Error Control Codes used in this paper evaluate their performance by computing the probability of not correcting an error. In general, the fact that the coder and decoder circuitry can also fail is neglected. This paper explains that under certain circumstances [e. g., low bit error rate and low data transmission rates (bits/sec), variable message bits] the chip failure probabilities can actually dominate and eliminate the gains achieved with coding. Some of the Error correcting codes like parity bit code, Hamming code and Reed Solomon code for various message lengths and different code rates including the effect of coding & <b>decoding</b> <b>circuits</b> is analysed. Finally the improvement ratio is calculated between probability of not correcting error without coding and with coding for 3 codes.

Neural recordings from primary sensory afferents, along with behavioral observations, demonstrate that vertical coordinates of contacted objects are encoded by the identity of activated afferents, horizontal coordinates by the timing of activation and radial coordinates by the intensity of activation. Because these codes are mutually independent, the three-dimensional location of an object could, in principle, be encoded by individual afferents during single whisker–object contacts.
