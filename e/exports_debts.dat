In 1995, expectations {{arising from the}} new discoveries of sizable oil reserves and double-digit growth in the non-oil economyâ€”led by the timber industryâ€”dominated economic developments. However, the fiscal position was again expansionary, as the fiscal deficit grew to 5 percent of GDP, exacerbating imbalances and adding to external payments arrears. Total budgetary revenue {{as a share of}} GDP fell and noninterest expenditure increased sharply including unclassified spending on the order of 3 percent of GDP.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{a number}} of structural factors affecting the external debt sustainability of HIPC completion point countries. It shows that (i) while comparing favorably with other lowincome countries, the policy and institutional frameworks of completion point countries in general are still relatively weak, and their debt management practices remain inferior to international standards; and (ii) their export base remains narrow and fiscal revenue mobilization lags behind, even compared with many other low-income countries. Achieving and maintaining long-term debt sustainability in completion point countries will require continued structural reforms, timely donor support, and close monitoring of new borrowing in support of sound macroeconomic policies.

40|$|While the {{relationship}} between volatility and credit risk is central {{to much of the}} literature on finance and banking, it has been largely neglected in empirical macro studies on sovereign defaults. This paper presents new econometric estimates for a panel of 25 emerging market countries over 1970 - 2001, breaking down aggregate volatility into its external and domestic policy components. We find that countries with historically higher macroeconomic volatility are more prone to default, and particularly so if part of this volatility is policy-induced. Reducing policy volatility thus appears to be key to improving a country''s credit standing.

40|$|Tanzania''s real {{effective}} {{exchange rate}} (REER) has depreciated sharply since end- 2000, reversing the appreciation {{that took place}} in the second half of the 1990 s. Single-country and panel data estimates, and the external sustainability approach, suggest that Tanzania''s REER is currently modestly undervalued relative to its estimated equilibrium level. Looking forward, a modest trend appreciation of the equilibrium REER is expected, consistent with continued high GDP growth and an expected recovery in terms of trade. In addition, capital inflows to Tanzania could be significantly higher than currently expected, to take advantage of Tanzania''s natural resources and strong policy framework. If so, these inflows would contribute to an additional appreciation by as much as 20 percent of the equilibrium REER.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to conduct a {{comparative}} analysis of the various issues faced by firms involved in foreign trade in Brunei Darussalam and Singapore. It tries to delineate the issues or concerns in export and import trade that are significant, but of either same or different magnitudes in these countries. It also attempts to determine the concerns that are of lesser extent for both importers and exporters, and extent of usage of insurance against non-payment of <b>export</b> <b>debts,</b> and/or loss of goods in transit. Design/methodology/approach – Judgment and snowball sampling methods are employed to collect data from various companies in these countries. The results are analyzed from two samples of 42 and 25 responding firms of Brunei Darussalam, and Singapore, respectively. Descriptive statistics is used to present and analyze the data. Findings – The paper highlights the various important issues related to foreign trade by firms. The issues that are significant, but are of the same magnitudes in these countries along with the issues that are of different magnitudes are mentioned. Furthermore, concerns of lesser extent for both importers and exporters along with a comparative analysis of buying insurance by firms are also mentioned. Research limitations/implications – The results are basically from the various trading companies involved in foreign trade in Brunei Darussalam and Singapore. The sample size of firms from Singapore may be another limiting factor. Originality/value – This study fills the gap in the existing literature about current issues prevalent in these countries. Furthermore, some suggestions to reduce the concerns of foreign trade are also mentioned in the paper. The findings may be useful for financial institutions interested in providing better services to the firms.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{world has}} {{witnessed}} increased interdependence {{in the last}} two decades, thanks to globalization. The main driving forces of this process are technology, policy and competition and it subordinates domestic economies to global market conditions and practices. Developed nations are the beneficiaries of globalization as their share of world trade and finance has been expanded at the expense of developing countries. Thus, the process exacerbates inequality between the world’s regions and poverty in the developing world. Nigeria has not benefited from globalization due to monocultural export, inability to attract increased foreign investments and huge indebtedness. But globalization can be domesticated in the country through diversification of <b>exports,</b> <b>debt</b> reduction and expanded development cooperation with other countries. The Nigerian state also needs to be strengthened as a bulwark against the dictates of foreign capital.

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} non linear impact of {{external}} debt on growth using a large panel data set of 93 developing countries over 1969 – 98. Results are generally robust across different econometric methodologies, regression specifications, and different debt indicators. For {{a country with}} average indebtedness, doubling the debt ratio would reduce annual per capita growth by between half and a full percentage point. The differential in per capita growth between countries with external indebtedness (in net present value) below 100 percent of exports and above 300 percent of exports {{seems to be in}} excess of 2 percent per annum. For countries that are to benefit from debt reduction under the current HIPC initiative, per capita growth might increase by 1 percentage point, unless constrained by other macroeconomic and structural economic distortions. Our findings also suggest that the average impact of debt becomes negative at about 160 – 170 percent of exports or 35 – 40 percent of GDP. The marginal impact of debt starts being negative at about half of these values. High debt appears to reduce growth mainly by lowering the efficiency of investment rather than its volume.

As a result, Australia’s economic expansion is now in its 14 th year, with growth averaging 3 Â¾ percent owing to a combination of strong job creation and high productivity growth. Growth is expected to rise from 2 Â¼ percent in 2005 to about 3 Â½ percent in the medium term, although this will require continued strong growth in productivity.

The econometric estimation showed that the sign of the coefficient of debt is positive and the debt squared is negative, and beyond a certain stock, the impact of debt on growth becomes negative and Tunisia must control its debts as additional increases will have adverse impacts on the economic performance of the country.

40|$|The econometric {{relationship}} between external public <b>debt,</b> <b>exports</b> {{and economic growth}} in Lebanon has been rarely examined. This study empirically investigates the {{relationship between}} economic growth, <b>exports</b> and external <b>debt</b> of Lebanon through an econometric analysis over the period 1970 - 2010 with {{the inclusion of a}} fourth macroeconomic variable that is the exchange rate. The exports were introduced in the model to test the export-led growth hypothesis for Lebanon. We explore this relationship using the vector error correction models (VECM) and we employ Granger causality technique in order to investigate the presence of causality among these variables. The results show that both short run and long run relationships exist among these variables. Moreover, the finding suggests, i) bidirectional Granger causality between GDP and external debt servicing, ii) unidirectional Granger causality that runs from external <b>debt</b> to <b>exports,</b> iii) unidirectional causality running from exports to economic growth, and iv) unidirectional causality running from exchange rate to economic growth. </p...|$|R

40|$|We {{construct}} a financial vulnerability indicator {{that is consistent}} with the theoretical literature on determinants of defaults. It is based on the amount of new foreign financing that is needed to avoid a default or an import adjustment, expressed as a proportion of the country''s sources of foreign currency. As the need for new foreign financing increases, so does a country''s financial vulnerability. The indicator has a higher correlation with default episodes than other indicators used in previous studies. In addition, the level at which it leads to a high probability of default is comparable across countries.
