25|$|The Imperial edict of 12 Ramasan 1256 {{and later}} {{ordinances}} made {{the distinction between}} three types of mail items: ordinary letters, registered letters (markings te'ahudd olunmoshdur), and official letters (markings tahirat-i mühümme). Fees were calculated {{by the type of}} mail, the weight, and the distance (measured in hours): in 1840, an ordinary letter, weighing less than 10g, had a cost per hour of 1 para. Special fees applied to samples, <b>insured</b> <b>mail,</b> special delivery, and printed matters, etc. These postal rates changed frequently, and new services were added over the years. Upon joining the Universal Postal Union on 1 July 1875, Ottoman overseas rates conformed to UPU rules.|$|E
25|$|The MPS also {{supports}} mail delivery for U.S. diplomatic facilities overseas and to deployed personnel in combat zones worldwide. Most USPS extra services, such as Certified Mail, registered mail, delivery confirmation, <b>insured</b> <b>mail,</b> certificate of mailing, return receipt, restricted delivery and return receipt for merchandise {{are available to}} the MPS. Mail sent from one military post office (MPO) to another MPO can be sent for free as inner/intra-theater delivery service (IDS) {{as long as it}} does not transit the United States. Military postage rates are equivalent to U.S. domestic postage rates because the Services pay the second destination transportation (SDT) costs to, from, and between MPOs. The postage paid on mail to/from MPOs only covers the cost of transporting the mail within the U.S. All military mail between the U.S. and overseas locations is subject to customs inspection in the country of destination, and customs declarations must normally be attached to packages and larger mail pieces.|$|E

Usage of a return address is required for some postal services (including Priority Mail, Express Mail, Periodicals in envelopes or wrappers, <b>Insured</b> <b>Mail,</b> Registered Mail, and parcel services).|$|E

5000|$|Monday, October 31, 1988 was payday {{for a lot}} of people, {{who began}} early Christmas {{shopping}} on the next day. On the evening of Tuesday, as on all days, shops all over the country deposited the days takings in drop-boxes at their local retail bank branches. In the morning of Wednesday, November 2, 1988, bank branches counted the deposits and credited them to the shop's accounts. In the afternoon, bank branches carried their excess cash to the local post offices and <b>mailed</b> it as <b>insured</b> high-value <b>mail.</b> The same service was used by a few other businesses sending valuable goods such as bearer bonds and expensive office equipment. In the evening, local post offices presorted the mail by destination post office as indicated by the zip code. [...] Most of the bank cash would be going to the Copenhagen post office.|$|R
