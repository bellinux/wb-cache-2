30|$|A high {{turbidity}} (mainly {{caused by}} degassing) can adversely influence {{the intensity of}} the fluorescent measurements. In the case of the Rheinfelden spring where a high CO 2 content exists, a <b>degassing</b> <b>device</b> was installed to reduce turbidity. Besides degassing and turbidity, a possible mixing of the thermal spring water with a neighbouring aquifer can influence the fluorescence signal. The order of magnitude by which the fluorescence intensity is affected by such a mixing depends on the constituents of the inflowing aquifer. Anthropogenic influxes in the form of chemicals such as cleaning agents from nearby industry or thermal baths resorts could also adversely influence measurements taken.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact that free, disbursed and {{dissolved}} air in liquid food products has on the per formance of packaging lines. Specific focus is put on high-speed hot- fill beverage lines that rapidly increased in number of installations in the 19802 ̆ 7 s and 19902 ̆ 7 s. This 2 ̆ 7 paper investigates the sources of gases in liquid food products, the negative operational impacts of excess gas in liquid food products, and the commonly available types of systems used to reduce gas levels prior to packaging. A specific new technology, atmospheric hot degassing, is described. This new technology is evaluated in a pilot plant environment to determine its potential effectiveness compared to existing methods and control runs with no deaeration applied. This paper concludes that, based upon the results seen in the pilot plant research, sufficient evidence exists to justify additional production- scale field-testing. Finally, based upon {{the results of the}} pilot plant research, this paper describes the patent filing and ultimate issuance of a United States Patent to the author for the application of an atmospheric <b>degassing</b> <b>device</b> in hot-fill processing and packaging applications...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the work: the {{investigation}} of the O* 002 - and CO* 002 -gas exchange, biochemical composition of cells in the cellular cycle Chlorella sp. K with the different concentration O* 002 in the cultural medium. For the first time shown has been the following: the elongation of the cellular cycle at a high concentration O* 002 in the medium due to the delayof the formation of the photosynthetic device; the increase of specific speed of O* 002 isolation without the increase of the cells growth speed at alow concentration O* 002 in the medium. The data on the action of high concentration O* 002 on the cells biochemical composition and cellular cycle are very important {{for the development of the}} regulations in the mass cultivating of the algae. The <b>degassing</b> <b>devices</b> have been developed: the hydrodynamic and the ultrasonic ones, reducing the concentration O* 002 in the medium. The data can be used in constructing the industrial photoreactors, at the designs of the closed systems of life-supportAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|R
