40|$|Polyurethane foam {{formation}} involves simultaneous polymerization and expansion. In an {{open cell}} foam, foam lamellae rupture at some stage of foam formation, {{resulting in a}} foam with continuous air channels. Experiments are carried out to study the effect of initial temperature of monomers on the open cell content of water-blown flexible polyurethane foams. The change in kinetics of the polymerization and blowing with initial monomer temperature is noted by measuring the gel and rise times during foaming. Both polymerization and blowing reactions {{are found to be}} faster with increasing monomer temperature. The cell size is found to increase with initial monomer temperature, and the height of the cured free rise foam is found to decrease. The open cell content of the foam increased considerably with initial monomer temperature, leading finally to the collapse of the foam at the highest temperatures studied. The mechanical properties of the foam at different monomer temperatures are determined by making molded foams. The <b>indentation</b> <b>load</b> <b>deflection</b> decreased with increasing monomer temperature indicating the formation of softer foams, but showed a slight increase near the temperature of collapse.

40|$|AbstractThis project {{focused on}} {{identifying}} {{the influence of}} subject characteristics and foam properties on seat contours in order to explain the load transfer between the buttocks and cushion. Seat contours were recorded for 17 people (11 spinal cord injured and six able-bodied individuals). Contour characteristics were represented by maximum contour depth, surface area, and displaced volume. Subject characteristics were represented as intertrochanteric distance, body weight, and lower extremity muscle tone. Two foams with different degrees of stiff-ness (45 - and 55 -pound <b>indentation</b> <b>load</b> <b>deflection</b> [ILD]) were studied. Multiple regression equations were calculated {{for each of the}} three contour characteristics by entering in all three sub-ject attributes. While the equations differ, all six exhibited a significant Multiple R (range: 0. 79 to 0. 92). Each subject characteristic was a significant predictor of at least one contour trait (p< 0. 05). The major difference between the two cushions was the predictive ability of muscle tone. For the stiffer HR 55 foam, muscle tone was the strongest predictor of all contour characteristics. Therefore, some conclusions can be drawn con-cerning the relationship between foam stiffness, tone, and resulting seat contours. These relationships help define the dif-ferences in load transfer as subject and cushion characteristics vary and are important in the design of contoured foam for use as wheelchair cushions.

30|$|The typical cyclic nanoindentation P h {{curve of}} GaN thin films {{subjected}} to a maximum <b>indentation</b> <b>load</b> of 100 mN is illustrated in Fig. 1. The curve exhibits irregularities during loading characterized by small jumps in the penetration depth (see the arrows), {{referred to as the}} multiple “pop-in” events in what follows. The fact that multiple “pop-in” events are observable over such a wide range of <b>indentation</b> <b>load</b> and penetration depth indicates the close relations to the plastic deformation of GaN thin films. Furthermore, since the phenomena are randomly distributed on the loading curve and each curve is associated with a different stress rate which increases with the maximum <b>indentation</b> <b>load,</b> it is suggestive that the first “pop-in” event is not thermally activated. Dislocation-induced “pop-in” event is usually associated with two distinct deformation behaviors before (pure elastic behavior) and after (elastoplastic behavior) the phenomena [13]. In this work, it cannot be provided for such <b>indentation</b> <b>load</b> any evidence of dislocation activity and crack features at the free surface around the indentation from SEM observations, as illustrated in the insert of Fig. 1. Also, no reversal discontinuities during unloading segment of P h curves, commonly called the “pop-out” events are observed here; such phenomena are observed for instance in Si and related to phase transformation just beneath the diamond indenter [14, 15]. One possible mechanism that would explain the observed behavior is the formation and propagation of dislocations in GaN thin films.|$|R
40|$|In this report, size-effects {{observed}} in conical indentation tests {{due to the}} existence of plastically-graded surfaces and the effect of geometrically necessary dislocations (GND) have been discussed. First, a new scheme has been proposed for the computational modelling of conical indentation in plastically-graded materials. Based on the new scheme and the work of Dao et al. [1], an analytical expression to predict the <b>indentation</b> <b>loading</b> curve has been presented which can be further used to establish a reverse algorithm to determine the plastic properties of a plastically-graded surface. Secondly, to characterize the effect of GND, a closed-form expression of the size-dependent sharp <b>indentation</b> <b>loading</b> curve has been proposed based on dimensional analysis and the finite deformation Taylor-based nonlocal theory (TNT) of plasticity (Huang et al. [2]). The key issue is to link the results of FEM based on TNT plasticity with those obtained using conventional FEM by taking as the effective strain gradient that presented in the work of Nix and Gao [3], thus avoiding large-scale finite element computations using strain gradient plasticity theories. Experiments carried out on 316 stainless steel have been used to verify the effectiveness of the present analytical model; the results demonstrate that the present analytical expression of the size-dependent <b>indentation</b> <b>loading</b> curve corresponds very well to the experimental <b>indentation</b> <b>loading</b> curve.

30|$|Table  3 {{shows the}} {{comparison}} of <b>indentation</b> <b>loads</b> at different penetration depths of the pristine single-crystal copper specimen and machining-induced surface. It can {{be noted that the}} <b>indentation</b> <b>loads</b> on the machining-induced surface are much smaller than those on the pristine surface with the same indentation depth, respectively. No remarkable difference was found when the maximum indentation penetration depth is larger than 2.0 nm. The amplitude value of the indentation curve on the pristine surface is much larger than the other. It is due to the dislocation embryos which developed and propagated in the specimen under the diamond indenter. However, when the maximum penetration is smaller than 2.0 nm, the hardness of the diamond-turned surface becomes distinctly lower than that of the pristine copper. At a sufficiently small <b>load,</b> the <b>indentation</b> response will be mainly due to the surface effects. At a slightly larger indentation penetration depth, the <b>indentation</b> <b>loads</b> are much smaller than those of the pristine single-crystal copper surface. It can be concluded from these results that the machining-induced surface is softer than pristine single-crystal copper.|$|R
40|$|Several major {{types of}} civil {{engineering}} structure including off-shore platforms and road and railway bridges are subjected to repeated loading. Earlier {{studies have indicated that}} such <b>loading</b> causes higher <b>deflections</b> in concrete structures than static loading. This thesis is devoted {{to the study of the}} deflection behaviour of reinforced and partially prestressed concrete box beams. In addition to presenting details and results of a comprehensive experimental programme, a simple and reliable procedure is proposed for the analysis of concrete beam <b>deflections</b> under repeated <b>loading.</b> Thirty reinforced and five partially prestressed concrete box beams (of 1 / 4 scale) were fabricated and each tested up to 105 repetitions of load. For each beam, the repeated loading range was kept constant with the lower and upper limits set at 30 percent and 50 percent of the yield load to simulate the dead load and service load respectively. For some beams 70 percent or 90 percent of the yield load was used as the upper limit, simulating overloading conditions. The <b>deflections</b> at both <b>loading</b> limits were measured immediately after 1, 10, 102, 103, 104 and 105 cycles of load. It was found that after the initial loading cycle the bending rigidity of the beams (hence the instantaneous deflection) was not affected by further repeated loading. The dead <b>load</b> <b>deflection</b> on the other hand increased with increasing number of loading cycles although the rate of increase reduced rapidly as the number of cycles became larger. This amplification of dead <b>load</b> <b>deflection</b> by repeated <b>load</b> can be seen as a parallel phenomenon to the time creep of concrete under sustained <b>loads.</b> Because large <b>deflection</b> can accumulate in a short time under repeated <b>loads,</b> the accumulated <b>deflection</b> is referred to herein as the 2 ̆ 7 intensive creep 2 ̆ 7 deflection. For some lightly reinforced beams the intensive creep deflection was as high as eight times the initial dead <b>load</b> <b>deflection.</b> The steel ratio, degree of prestressing and the maximum loading level are found to be the important factors influencing the deflection behaviour of concrete beams under repeated loading. A simple procedure is presented for the analysis of the total deflections of reinforced and prestressed concrete box beams under repeated <b>loading.</b> The total <b>deflection</b> is obtained by summing the instantaneous live <b>load</b> <b>deflection</b> and the accumulated dead <b>load</b> <b>deflection.</b> The latter may be computed as the product of the initial dead <b>load</b> <b>deflection</b> and the intensive creep factor. Following a comparative study, the most suitable method is chosen from 9 well-known procedures for the computation of initial dead <b>load</b> <b>deflection.</b> Based on the experimental data of the initial and accumulated dead <b>load</b> <b>deflections</b> an empirical formula for the intensive creep factor is derived using statistical means. Parallel to the logarithmic time-creep equation, the formula is considered to be more realistic than an alternative hyperbolic model. For computing the instantaneous live <b>load</b> <b>deflection</b> of any <b>loading</b> cycle, a new equation for the effective moment of inertia is proposed. This equation is shown to be superior to the existing formulas. All equations recommended for use are simple and explicit. In light of the experimental data obtained herein and those by other researchers, comparisons are made with two other recently published methods. It is concluded that the proposed procedure is more versatile in that it accounts for more variables and allows for the predictions of instantaneous deflection and permanent set in addition to the total deflection. In most cases it also gives more accurate results...|$|R
40|$|A new {{approach}} explaining the microhardness dependence on <b>indentation</b> <b>load</b> is pro-posed. It {{is assumed that}} the scale effect of microhardness is due to stage pattern of plastic strain and to gradual transition from the dislocation strain to the rotation one according to in-creasing force of indentor penetration. It is established that lubrication influence on the mi-crohardness value is determined by stages of the microindentation process: at the loading stage, by modification in the structural condition of the surface metal layer in the indentor-metal contact region; at the unloading stage, by value of elastic recovery of stresses formed under loading. The joint action of both factors determines variations in the microhardness {{with the use of}} lubricant media.

The best correlation between measured values and used models is achieved by using the Meyer Law and the modified PSR model.
