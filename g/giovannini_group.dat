5000|$|Despite the {{introduction}} of the euro more than ten years ago, the provision of post-trading services (i.e. clearing and settlement) remained heavily fragmented along national lines. For example, there were still 19 CSDs operating in the euro area in 2009 and almost 40 in the 27 countries of the EU.This situation is clearly not optimal for a single currency area or for the EU, as it encourages each countryâ€™s financial market to remain domestically-oriented. Investors continue to invest mostly in domestic securities, and as a result, the euro area financial market cannot fully benefit from the risk diversification and competition benefits that arise from having a single currency. These barriers which provoke a considerable competitive disadvantage for European capital markets were identified in a report by the <b>Giovannini</b> <b>group.</b> [...] EU authorities have taken up initiatives to remove impediments to competition between national markets. The most important initiatives from the European Commission are the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID), the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR) and the Central securities depositories Regulation (CSDR). T2S as a pan-European platform is intended to complement these existing initiatives by boosting competition, increasing price transparency and harmonising practices across Europe.|$|E
40|$|The {{findings}} {{reported here}} raise some serious concerns. Relative to domestic transactions, transactions within the European economy that occur across Member Sates {{are far more}} complex, are hindered {{by a number of}} significant barriers and, given the data that the group has been able to collect, are much more costly than domestic transactions. It is perhaps no exaggeration to conclude, from the analysis in this report, that inefficiencies in clearing and settlement represent the most primitive and thus most important barrier to integrated financial markets in Europe. The removal of these inefficiencies is a necessary condition {{for the development of a}} large and efficient financial infrastructure in Europe. This is the first of two reports on cross-border clearing and settlement arrangements in the European Union and focuses on identifying the sources of inefficiency that exist in the current arrangements. A second report, to be published in 2002, will be more forward looking and will attempt to assess the prospects for the EU clearing and settlement architecture, with a particular emphasis on public policy aspects. cross-border clearing, settlement transactions, barriers to efficiency, clearing and settlement architecture, public policy, <b>Giovannini</b> <b>Group...</b>|$|E
