The original lyrics serve as the official festive song {{of the city of}} Split. The song, being traditional, does not have a strictly defined ending, so its ending <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> <b>through</b> <b>time</b> and ideologies. Numerous artists have recorded the song. Najbolji Hrvatski Tamburaši included it in their 1989 release Hrvatska pjesmarica. Trio Gušt released a version with new lyrics in 2009.|$|E
50|$|Ecological-{{evolution}}ary theory (EET) is a sociological {{theory of}} sociocultural evolution {{that attempts to}} explain the origin and changes of society and culture. Key elements focus {{on the importance of}} natural environment and technological change. EET {{has been described as a}} theory of social stratification, as it analyzes how stratification <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> <b>through</b> <b>time</b> across different societies. It also has been viewed as a synthesis of the structural functionalism and conflict theory. Proposed by Gerhard Lenski, the theory perhaps is best articulated in his book, Ecological-Evolutionary Theory: Principles and Applications (2005).His major collaborators, Jean Lenski and Patrick Nolan, also are said to have contributed to EET.|$|E

50|$|A dynamic megabias {{occurs when}} the fossilization {{potential}} of one group relative to that of another group changes through time. For example, lingulide brachiopods had a lower fossilization potential than articulate brachiopods, {{but only in the}} early Paleozoic.This <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> <b>through</b> <b>time,</b> governed by changes in bathymetry and lateral shifts in lithofacies associated with basin evolution. By the Middle Ordovician, articulates had diversified to become important components of all marine environments except the deep basin; inarticulates were most important in offshore and basinal settings. By moving away from the main taphonomic window, the inarticulates sacrificed their fossilization potential whilst not necessarily decreasing their biological diversity.|$|E

The six chose the name 'Weapon X' due to their common ties to the Project in their native timelines, although, save for Sabretooth, the background of all the other members are a mystery. The Exiles completed the mission without realizing the existence of Weapon X, but the Weapon X trio saw the Exiles and their leader, Blink.|$|E

To analyze the advertisements, this thesis uses Goffman’s theory on gender stereotypes in advertisements. Goffman’s theory is used to explore whether women’s portrayals in advertisements <b>have</b> <b>changed</b> <b>through</b> <b>time.</b> In his theory, Goffman proposes five categories: Relative Size, Feminine Touch, Function Ranking, Licensed Withdrawal, and the Ritualization of Subordination. The results of my study show that eighty-five advertisements from Kartini 2014 - 2015 fit with Goffman’s categories. With regards to gender stereotypes, out of eighty-five advertisements analyzed, 83. 5...|$|R

The Mexican population is majority Mestizo, which in colonial times {{meant to be a}} person of half European and half Native American ancestry. Nonetheless {{the meaning of the word}} <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> <b>through</b> <b>time,</b> currently being used to refer to the segment of the Mexican population who does not speak indigenous languages,thus in Mexico, the term [...] "Mestizo" [...] has become a cultural label rather than a racial one, it's vaguely defined and includes people who does not have Indigenous ancestry, people who does not have European ancestry aswell as people of African ancestry.Such transformation of the word is not a casualty but the result of a concept known as [...] "mestizaje", which was promoted by the post-revolutionary Mexican government in an effort to create a united Mexican ethno-cultural identity with no racial distinctions. It's because of this that sometimes the Mestizo population in Mexico is estimated to be as high as 93% of the Mexican population.|$|E

By relying on a multifactor asset pricing framework, this paper examines the integration of 11 African Stock Markets (ASMs) relative {{to the world and}} emerging markets, as well as the impact of the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) on their degree integration. We provide evidence that world, emerging market and African market factors command a significant risk premium in African markets, and that the markets are partially integrated with the world market.

The current understanding, on the contrary, is that the condition of poverty is unacceptable, and that it should be eradicated. This study investigates the impact of food security on urban poverty using Lagos state, Nigeria as a case study. The study reveals that four important proxies (high level of education, small household size, healthy households and high income,) for food security have huge impact on poverty and significant impact on urban poverty. Hence; with good policy in place ensuring food security, poverty can be overcome...|$|E
40|$|The {{nature of}} public goods <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> <b>through</b> <b>time</b> {{and so has}} the {{literature}} on public goods provision which has experienced a significant increase since Samuelson's (1954) paper.

In this note we try to show the hypotheses underlying the different functions used. We argue that the different approaches are suitable only if used in the right framework and this should be kept in mind when choosing the function in relation to the type of public good to be studied.
