5|$|At {{the inauguration}} on 9 September 2008, Afghan President Hamid Karzai {{was a guest}} of honour, which was a signal for much closer {{cooperation}} {{between the two nations}} in addressing the tribal insurgency along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. After the election, Zardari promised to approve the constitutional provision that removed the President's power to dismiss Parliament, but public scepticism remained on whether he would actually carry out his promise. His economic competence was questioned after allegations that he had raised grain procurement prices through inflationary subsidies and scrapped the capital gains tax. His first parliamentary speech was overshadowed by 20 September Islamabad Marriott Hotel bombing. A few days later, he went to the United Nations <b>Headquarters</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> City on his first overseas trip as President.|$|E
5|$|CBS began a shortwave {{listening}} {{program in}} September 1939, on an experimental basis, at the National Lawn Tennis Championships at West Side Tennis Club in Forest Hills, New York. Engineers installed equipment at the CBS booth when the location {{was found to}} have good reception, and monitors relayed European shortwave news to CBS <b>headquarters</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> between tennis matches. Throughout World War II, CBS captured Allied and enemy shortwave communications from more than 60 international stations via secretly located receivers. Translations of intercepted broadcasts were teletyped to all New York newspapers, Associated Press, United Press International and International News Service, and in turn disseminated to newspapers and radio stations throughout the United States. Major headline news frequently resulted, since big stories often broke first on radio.|$|E

In February 2013, the Toronto City Council decided to coordinate its anti-human-trafficking efforts with the NAP-CHT. That May, during a meeting of the sixty-seventh session of the United Nations General Assembly at United Nations <b>Headquarters</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> City that was convened to discuss the Global Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons, the Canadian delegation spoke about the NAP-CHT.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} the Indiana World War Memorial Plaza lay in a 1919 attempt {{by the city of}} Indianapolis to lure the newly formed American Legion from its {{temporary}} <b>headquarters</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> City. The American Legion, chartered by Congress in 1919 after World War I, is an organization of veterans that sponsors youth programs, promotes patriotism and national security, and provides commitment to Americans who have served in the armed forces. Three Indianapolis veterans wanted to attract the Legion to the city, which already had the Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument. At an American Legion national convention in Minneapolis during November 1919, cities sent representatives to lobby to become the new headquarters. Indianapolis drew support because of its central location within the United States and the city's shows of patriotism. Although Washington, D.C. received the most votes on the first ballot, Indianapolis gained a majority and won the second with 361 votes out of 684 cast.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{political}} pressure, the MoD continued to lack confidence in UNAMSIL leadership. Thus, the British government refused to place combat troops under UN command, but did second additional staff officers to UNAMSIL, to the UN <b>headquarters</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York,</b> {{and to the}} SLA. The officers attached to UNAMSIL were tasked with assisting its commanders in planning and mounting operations and were led by a brigadier who became UNAMSIL's chief of staff, while in New York, the officers attached to UN headquarters provided planning support for logistics operations to bring UNAMSIL up to its mandated strength. At the same time, {{the focus of the}} British training programme shifted. Although six battalions had been trained, the SLA still lacked many combat support functions as well as command and control capabilities. The STTTs set out to improve the SLA's capabilities in these areas by providing the next set of recruits with more specialised training in addition to basic infantry training provided to the first intake. The British trainers also constructed an operations room at the SLA's headquarters and provided other support to improve the SLA's communications and logistical capabilities.|$|E

5|$|The {{company that}} would become FBO began as the U.S.-based movie {{subsidiary}} of the British importer, exporter, and film distributor Robertson-Cole. This organization was similar in structure to the French Path√© Exchange company, {{a subsidiary of the}} French Path√© Fr√®res company. From its U.S. <b>headquarters</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> City, R-C Pictures, as it was sometimes known, first entered the American film distribution market. In 1919, the company forged an alliance with Exhibitors Mutual Distributing, a corporate descendant of the Mutual Film studio. The first of R-C's own feature productions to be released was The Wonder Man, directed by John G. Adolfi and starring Georges Carpentier, which debuted May 29, 1920. With its move into production, Robertson-Cole established a 13.5-acre (5.5-hectare) studio in Los Angeles's fortuitously named Colegrove district, then adjacent to but soon to be subsumed by Hollywood. In January 1921, Robertson-Cole absorbed Hallmark Pictures, which had acquired the Exhibitors Mutual interests the previous year. The first official Robertson-Cole production shot at the new studio was a February 1921 release, The Mistress of Shenstone, directed by Henry King and starring beautiful Pauline Frederick, a former Paramount and Goldwyn star. That year, the British owners of the studio entered into a working relationship with Joseph P. Kennedy, father of future U.S. president John F. Kennedy. Joseph Kennedy was then a broker at the New York banking firm of Hayden, Stone, as well as the owner of Maine‚ÄìNew Hampshire Theatres, a small chain of movie houses. Though he failed to arrange the sale R-C's general partners were looking for, Kennedy's involvement with the studio was far from over.|$|E
