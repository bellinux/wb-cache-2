Hän käytti näiden alusten lasteja sekä niiden koti-, lastaus- ja määräsatamatietoja keskeisimpänä tilastomateriaalinaan. Hän käytti työssään myös muita lähteitä, mm. Itämeren piirissä toimineiden amerikkalaisten ja englantilaisten lähettiläiden ja konsulien raportteja.

The {{purpose of}} this study is to discuss the {{development}} of trade and polito-commercial relations between the U. S and Russia from the Treaty of Paris in 1783 to 1860. The problems are approached on four levels: 1) commercial diplomacy between the countries, 2) the entrepreneurs involved in commerce and their activities, 3) mercantile shipping, 4) the volume of trade. The neutrality of trade and the seas (free ships-free goods) was the cornerstone of American commercial and foreign policy. Britain did not accept the principle in the forms proposed by Washington and the Department of State sought support from Russia. The results were poor. Articles of neutrality were even omitted from the commercial treaty concluded between Russia and the U. S. in 1832. In the name of freedom of the seas the U. S. took the initiative in the abolition of the old Danish Sound dues in 1857. Most of the entrepreneurs in American trade with Baltic Russia were from New England, as were the ships, brigs, barks and schooners that crossed the Atlantic. At first insufficient information about the distant markets was the biggest obstacle to commercial intercourse. The captains and supercargoes played a crucial role in getting the best cargoesfor the Russian markets and find the most reliable trading house in St Petersburg to deal with. In practice about 90 - 95 percent of the trade between Russia and the U. S was carried through the Sound, 95 percent of it on American vessels. According to the Sound Toll Accounts and Consular reports altogether 9500 American vessels sailed to the Baltic and back in the period 1783 - 1860. Most of them visited St Petersburg. European wars created new opportunities for the Americans to trade with Russia. During the Continental SystemAmericans sailing under the neutral flag ”found” excellent markets for their colonial products in St Petersburg. The good days came to an end during the Anglo-American War in 1812 - 14. Initially the U. S. imports from Russia were bar iron, hemp and “manufactures” (i. e. <b>hemp</b> and flax <b>cloths).</b> The main American exports and re-exports to St. Petersburg consisted of a wide range of products (e. g. sugar, rice, tobacco, coffee, cotton, spices). From the 1820 s onwards American merchants created ”the sugar triangle”: the trade from New England via Havana to St Petersburg and back to the ports of Massachusetts or New York. The sugar carried by the Americans was worth over twice as much as direct exports from the U. S. to Russia. At the beginning of the 1850 s ”the cotton triangle” entered the scene. Americans carried cotton wool from Southern ports to St Petersburg and sailed back to western Europe, New York or Boston. The raw sugar and cotton the Americans carried gave a major boost to the creation of modern industrial production in Russia. British money played a central role in the shipments of sugar and cotton. Over 45 percent of the American tonnage involved in commerce with Russia did not trade directly between the two countries...|$|R

40|$|It is {{said that}} Korean hemp was already in use in BCE 2333 and that by the 7 th century it {{had become one of}} the primary fibers used. Today, Koreans {{manufacture}} <b>hemp</b> <b>cloth</b> for shrouds, funerary costumes, and everyday summer-wear. There are two types of Korean hemp cloth: Andongpoh (Seang-neang-ii), which is produced in Andong County and adjacent areas; and Musam (Ik-neang-ii), which is produced in eleven different regions throughout Korea. The majority of hemp fabric production in Korea is Musam, and in Boseong County, in southern Korea, there is a particularly long history of Musam hemp cultivation. Twenty-five percent of all Korean hemp is cultivated in this region, and 50 % of market share in Korean hemp fabric is produced here. Adding further research that was conducted on Musam hemp production in Boseong County in 2007, to a presentation made in Toronto (in 2006) on this subject, this paper will focus on a step by step comparison of the two types of hemp production. The ultimate goal is to point out how the differences in production create the two different qualities of <b>hemp</b> <b>cloth.</b> In addition, the paper will address ways the market for the two types of hemp has changed in the present day. Both types of hemp are 35 cm (14 in) wide, but Andongpoh is much finer, as it is composed of 640 to 1200 warps. It is considered an exquisite fabric, and some historical references have been found in which it was presented as an inter-class gift by members of the lower/ middle class to members of the upper class. 2 Musam, on the other hand, which is coarse but very durable, was historically produced for clothing for the middle and lower classes and also for funerary garments.
