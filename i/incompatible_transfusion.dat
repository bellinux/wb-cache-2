[...] Unlike the ABO antigens, a recipient will not usually react to the first <b>incompatible</b> <b>transfusion</b> because the adaptive immune system does not immediately recognize it. After an <b>incompatible</b> <b>transfusion</b> the recipient may develop an antibody to the antigen and will react to any further incompatible transfusions. This antibody is important because it is the most frequent cause of hemolytic disease of the newborn. Incompatible red blood cells are sometimes given to recipients who will never become pregnant, such as males or postmenopausal women, {{as long as they do}} not have an antibody, since the greatest risk of Rh incompatible blood is to current or future pregnancies.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the introduction of two-sample policy for transfusion at our hospital and reduction of the risk of ABO <b>incompatible</b> <b>transfusion.</b> BACKGROUND: ABO <b>incompatible</b> <b>transfusion</b> can be a fatal but avoidable event. Wrong blood in tube is a cause of ABO <b>incompatible</b> <b>transfusion</b> and there are various strategies available to try and expunge this event. METHODS: Survey of policy/practice before and after the introduction of a two-sample policy. RESULTS: Staff training is inadequate in reducing the risk of ABO <b>incompatible</b> <b>transfusion.</b> A two-sample policy was introduced and does not significantly increase workload or use of group O blood and does not compromise patient safety by causing delay in blood provision. Post hoc analysis confirms good understanding of the policy by medical staff. Observation of medical staff taking transfusion samples demonstrated consistent deviation from policy, enforcing the need for confirmatory samples. CONCLUSION: A two-sample policy adds an extra layer of safety to transfusion practice and can be introduced without creating new problems...|$|E

40|$|Platelet transfusions {{have contributed}} to the revolutionary modern {{treatment}} of hypoproliferative thrombocytopenia. Despite the long-term application of platelet transfusion in therapeutics, all aspects of their optimal use (i. e., in cases of ABO and/or Rh (D incompatibility) have not been definitively determined yet. We reviewed the available data on transfusion practices and outcome in ABO and RhD incompatibility and platelet refractoriness due to anti-human leukocyte antigen (HLA) antibodies. Transfusion of platelets with major ABO-incompatibility is related to reduced posttransfusion platelet (PLT) count increments, compared to ABO-identical and minor, but still are equally effective in preventing clinical bleeding. ABO-minor <b>incompatible</b> <b>transfusions</b> pose the risk of an acute hemolytic reaction of the recipient that is not always related to high anti-A, B donor titers. ABO-identical PLT transfusion seems to be the most effective and safest therapeutic strategy. Exclusive ABO-identical platelet transfusion policy could be feasible, but alternative approaches could facilitate platelet inventory management. Transfusion of platelets from RhD positive donors to RhD negative patients is considered to be effective and safe though is associated with low rate of anti-D alloimmunization due to contaminating red blood cells. The prevention of D alloimmunization is recommended only for women of childbearing age. HLA alloimmunization is a major cause of platelet refractoriness. Managing patients with refractoriness with cross-matched or HLA-matched platelets is the current practice although data are still lacking for the efficacy of this practice in terms of clinical outcome.

40|$|Background: Transfusion {{of blood}} and blood {{products}} {{can be associated with}} hazards which may be at times fatal. Timely reporting of transfusion reactions is imperative for root cause analysis and their prevention in future. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the transfusion reactions at our institution during last seven years. The data was retrieved from our computerized blood bank information system and by reviewing the medical charts of patients. The frequency of adverse effects, implicated products, wrong blood transfusion and its outcome were observed. Results and conclusions: During study period (2006 – 2012), a total of 393, 662 blood or blood products were transfused. There were 458 adverse events with an estimated rate of 1. 16 per 1000 blood products administered. During 2011 – 2012, 121 transfusion reactions were reported of 119, 921 transfused units. The most common adverse effects were allergic reactions (70 episodes of 121 or 57. 8 %) followed by febrile non hemolytic transfusion reactions or FNHTR (43 events of 121 or 35. 5 %). Transfusion associated dyspnea, circulatory overload and transfusion associated lung injury were less frequent. During the study period, 142, 066 red cell units were transfused with nine recognized ABO-mismatch transfusions and two fatalities. The computed incidence of ABO-mismatch transfusion was 1 in 15, 785 with a mortality rate of 1 in 71, 033 units transfused. Etiology included: errors in final bed side check (n = 5), blood bank clerical errors (n = 3) and mislabeled tube (n = 1). A review of these cases prompted hospital transfusion committee for re-enforcing policies and protocols to minimize accidental ABO <b>incompatible</b> <b>transfusions.</b> We concluded that urticaria and FNHTR are the most frequent transfusion reactions in our setting.

40|$|In {{the recent}} several years, it is {{necessary}} to use the preserved blood in the surgical procedures because of the reasons that the dvelopements of surgical techniques have demended the great amounts of blood transfusions. But it may be said that the preserved blood transfusion has many unknown clinical problems, even its clinical usefulness. The author studied on the relation of hemolysis of preserved blood to untoward reactions of transfusion in Part Ⅰ of this studies. 1. On the clinical investigations of hemolytic reactions by preserved blood transfusion: The hemolytic reaction is the most important and severe untoward reaction. In this reaction, the patient shows the so-called hemolytic shock and, in the latter, studium, has the crisis due to renal failure. The causes of this reaction, which shows the destruction of blood cells in the patient, may be said in (1) <b>incompatible</b> blood <b>transfusion,</b> (2) massive transfusion of O-type blood and (3) transfusion of hemolysed blood. The statistical analysis of the untoward reactions due to preserved blood transfusion in the Tsuda's Surgical Department shows that 80 % of untoward reactions are fever or allergic ones and 0. 8 %, 14 cases, are hemolytic reactions. 6 cases of these hemolytic reaetions are occurred in <b>incompatible</b> blood <b>transfusions</b> and other 8 cases are seen in compatible blood transfusions. The main causes of latter 8 cases have the intimate relations to the hemolysis of preserved blood But, it is remarkable that the clinical severity of this reaction is not identified the grade of hemolysis or the quantity of <b>incompatible</b> blood <b>transfusion</b> and is in the more intimate relations to the patho-physiological states of the patients. 2. The grade of hemolysis and the untoward reactions; There are seen no definite intimate relations between the grade of hemolysis, ocurrences of untoward reactions and the kinds of untoward reactions. 3. The patho-physiological states of the patients and the untoward reactions; The author classified the next four groups in the meanings of patho-physiology. (1) nearly normal state, (2) anemia, (3) hypoproteinemia and (4) dehydrated state. In the latter 3 groups there are shown the untoward reactions in the ratio of over twice numbers than the group of nearly normal state. The allergic reactions are seen in hypoproteinemia group in the most high ratio. On the contrary, the fever and hemolytic reactions are often seen in the groups of anemia and dehydrated state. 4. Experimental studies on the hemolysis of preserved blood: The atuthor has the experimental studies on the hemolysis of preserved blood, especially on the influences of preservation days, transportation, shaking, filtratron, temperature, mixtures with many other physiological transfued solutions etc [...] All over mentioned mechanical procedures show the unexpected important influences on the hemolysis of preserved blood, and especially show the marked hemolysis in the longer preservation days. These hemolytic tendencies are seen most intense in the duration of 1 week of preservation. In the conclusions of these clinical and experimental studies, there must be said that it should be taken the most careful handling in the presereved blood transfusions even mechanically as well as criticizing of hemolytic states of preserved blood itself and shonld use the preserved blood of duration of within one week to the poor risked patients...|$|R

The EFSAM consolidates 14  blood banks in southeast France. It supplies 149  hospitals and maintains a centralized database on ABO types used at all area hospitals. As an added precaution against <b>incompatible</b> <b>transfusion,</b> the APHM requires ABO testing at each admission {{regardless of whether the}} patient has an ABO record. The study goal was to determine if admission testing was warranted. Discrepancies between ABO type determined by admission testing and records in the centralized database were investigated. The root cause for each discrepancy was classified as specimen collection or patient admission error. Causes of patient admission events were further subclassified as namesake (name similarity) or impersonation (identity fraud). The incidence of ABO discrepancies was 1 : 2334 including a 1 : 3329 incidence of patient admission events. Impersonation was the main cause of identity events accounting for 90. 3 % of cases. The APHM's ABO control policy prevented 19  incompatible transfusions. In relation to the 48, 593  packed red cell units transfused, this would have corresponded to a risk of 1 : 2526. Collecting and storing ABO typing results in a centralized database is an essential public health tool. It allows crosschecking of current test results with past records and avoids redundant testing. However, as patient identification remains unreliable, ABO typing at each admission is still warranted to prevent transfusion errors...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. Transfusion {{management}} {{of patients who}} are alloimmunized against high-prevalence erythrocyte antigens is often problematic. Strategy management depends, {{not only on the}} specific clinical circumstances of the patient, but also on the acceptable time frame. In patients without clinically significant antibody <b>incompatible</b> <b>transfusion</b> it may be less harmful than delaying medical intervention. Case Outline. We report a 57 -year-old female from Libya, blood group O, RhD-positive, who was treated at the Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases of Vojvodina. At the Blood Transfusion Institute of Vojvodina, during pretransfusion testing an IgG alloantibody of unknown specificity was determined. A total of 200 blood units (O, RhD-positive) were crossmatched, but positive reactions indicating that the donor units were incompatible for that specific patient. By testing the patient’s family members in Tripoli, six compatible blood units were found and applied during and after surgery. Due to the deterioration of the patient’s condition a rapid transfusion was required; however cross-match compatible blood was not available. After a biological crossmatch to predict the clinical significance of this antibody, 12 units of erythrocytes with the lowest positive cross-match reactions, were transfused to the patient without any adverse effects. Good tolerance of the units suggested that the present antibodies were not clinically significant. Later on, a rare alloantibody directed to the high frequency Gerbich blood group antigens was identified by the Foundation Central Laboratory, Blood Transfusion Service in Bern, Switzerland. Conclusion. In cases of emergency patients with alloantibodies against high frequency Gerbich, when autologous or compatible alogenous transfusion is unavailable, blood with the lowest positive cross-match reaction could be transfused if the biological cross-match is negative. Formation of a national register of donors with rare blood groups and their connection with international registers is of crucial significance in the {{management of}} patients requiring antigen negative blood otherwise unavailable from routine blood banks...|$|E

Here we share our experience of managing these patients with <b>incompatible</b> blood <b>transfusions</b> and suggest the minimal test required to assure patient safety. Materials and Methods: A total of 14 patients admitted with severe anemia, diagnosed with AIHA and requiring blood transfusion urgently were included in the study. A series of immunohematological investigations were performed to confirm the diagnosis and issue "best match" packed red blood cells (PRBC) to these patients. Results: A total of 167 PRBC units were crossmatched for 14 patients of which 46 units (28 %) were found to be best match ones and 26 (56. 5 %) of these units were transfused. A mean turn around time of 222 min was observed in issuing the ′best match′ blood. Severe hemolysis was observed in all patients with a median hemoglobin increment of 0. 88 g/dl after each unit PRBC transfusion. Conclusion: Decision to transfuse in AIHA should be based on the clinical condition of the patient. No critical patient should be denied blood transfusion due to serological incompatibility. Minimum investigations such as direct antiglobulin test (DAT), antibody screening and autocontrol should be performed to ensure transfusion safety in patients.

Design and methods: Blood requests were for patients with trauma, unexpected massive intraoperative hemorrhage, or ruptured aneurysm. Group O Rh positive RBC is our first choice to support patients who cannot wait for type specific or crossmatched blood. Transfusion was ordered on clinical signs of class III or class IV hemorrhage who could not be adequately resuscitated with crystalloid solutions. Results: One hundred nineteen patients entered the protocol, receiving a total of 568 units of blood (4. 77 units/patient). There were no adverse effects noted even though complete serologic testing had not been done. There were no deaths related to transfusion incompatibility. None of the patients presented with anti-D. Only 14 patients who were Rh negative received group O Rh positive RBC, and most of these patients were male. There were no acute hemolytic reactions or sensitization of young females. Overall, 38 patients (31. 9 %) died, 24 within hours of arrival. No death was attributable to transfusion reaction or blood incompatibility.

The direct Coombs test has become a diagnostic and investigative tool in hemolytic disease of the newborn (4 - 6), following <b>incompatible</b> blood <b>transfusions</b> (7) and in the acquired hemolytic anemias, idiopathic or secondary types (8 - 22).

40|$|The {{immune system}} is {{extremely}} complex and critical {{to the survival of}} all species as it protects them from attack by foreign micro-organisms and viruses. However the immune system can also be a foe in that it can sometimes turn against the organism it is designed to protect resulting in a range of autoimmune diseases. Additionally, its design to protect against invasion of foreign antigens, creates a major hurdle for transfusion and transplantation. If the immune system could be manipulated to allow for transfusion and transplantation of incompatible tissues, or turned off against specific targets in the case of autoimmune disease, all the while maintaining normal protective functions, then major advances in human health and well-being could be made. A variety of approaches have been used to try to manipulate the immune system, but with no one approach being the panacea, thus leaving open the opportunity for novel approaches to try and manipulate it towards creating beneficial outcomes. The recent development of a technology using novel function-spacer-lipid constructs (FSLs) has the ability to modify cell surfaces. As some of these FSLs are related in structure to glycolipids, they have the potential to inhibit antibodies. This research, using mice, set out to determine if FSL constructs could be used to manipulate the immune system by modifying membrane antigens and inhibiting/neutralizing antibodies. By using KODE™ technology, carbohydrate antigens were introduced to red cells (kodecytes) and visualization molecules provided a novel method with which to study and manipulate the immune response. This research involved a series of experiments in mice to investigate antibody stimulation, cell survival measurement and recovery, antibody neutralization and tolerance induction using various FSL constructs. Four hypotheses concerning the use of Functional-Spacer-Lipid (FSL) constructs were developed to investigate their potential for altering the immune response in mice. The hypothesis that FSLs might induce antibody production was tested with FSL constructs to determine the immunogenicity of the molecules with direct infusion into the circulation and subcutaneous immunization. FSL constructs injected by subcutaneous and intravenous routes were not immunogenic, with no anti-A production detected. The hypothesis that kodecytes could be used safely to determine cell survival after transfusion was tested with kodecyte transfusion in both compatible and incompatible mice. Incompatible mice were created by immunization with salivary blood group substance A with the successful production of anti-A and transfusion of A kodecytes. The FSL construct representing blood group A antigen (FSL-A) was intravenously infused into naive and anti-A-positive mice to determine in vivo antigen transformation and cell survival after A antigen-compatible and <b>incompatible</b> (A+biotin kodecyte) <b>transfusions.</b> Other FSL kodecytes were used to create non-lethal, compatible transfusion control mouse models. The FSL-biotin construct provided a label allowing in vitro binding with avidin/Alexafluor 488 providing a fluorescent marker to track kodecyte survival. A method was also developed to recover transfused, circulating A+biotin kodecytes from a whole blood sample with a use of avidin-agarose beads in gel cards. The hypothesis that FSLs could be used to neutralize circulating antibody was tested by infusing FSL constructs to neutralize antibody and then infusing antibody incompatible kodecytes. It was demonstrated that FSL-A was able to neutralize circulating anti-A, mitigating the consequences of kodecyte-incompatible red blood cell transfusion, and allowing for normal cell survival for up to 72 hours. The hypothesis that FSL constructs could potentially induce tolerance was tested by measuring the consequences of infusing FSL-A by direct circulatory infusion into mice, pre-immunization with salivary blood group A substance. Primary immunization with FSL-A did not induce tolerance to the A epitope since anti-A was produced after a secondary immunization of salivary A substance. However, there was some evidence of a partial down-regulation of the immune response in terms of tolerance induction after infusion of FSL-A. With further research, the potential for FSLs to be used safely in humans as a new methodology to determine 24 -hour transfused cell survival, or to recover the transfused cells or to neutralize circulating antibody without subsequent antibody stimulation, is now possible...|$|R
