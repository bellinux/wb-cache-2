40|$|The phase-encoding {{technique}} {{can sometimes}} increase {{the efficiency of}} the least-squares reverse time migration (LSRTM) by more than one order of magnitude. However, traditional random encoding functions require all the encoded shots to share the same receiver locations, thus limiting the usage to seismic surveys with a <b>fixed</b> <b>spread</b> geometry. We implement a frequency-selection encoding strategy that accommodates data with a marine streamer geometry. The encoding functions are delta functions in the frequency domain, so that all the en- coded shots have unique non-overlapping frequency content, and the receivers can distinguish the wavefield from each shot with a unique frequency band. Since the encoding functions are orthogonal to each other, there will be no crosstalk between different shots during modeling and migration. With the frequency-selection encoding method, the computational efficiency of LSRTM is increased so that its cost is compara- ble to conventional RTM for both the Marmousi 2 model and a marine data set recorded in the Gulf of Mexico. With more iterations, the LSRTM image quality is further improved. We conclude that LSRTM with frequency-selection is an efficient migration method that can sometimes produce more focused images than conventional RTM...|$|E
40|$|The {{trustees}} of funded defined benefit pension schemes must make two vital and inter-related decisions - setting the asset allocation and the contribution rate. While these decisions are usually taken separately, {{it is argued}} that they are intimately related and should be taken jointly. The objective of funded pension schemes is taken to be the minimization of both the mean and the variance of the contribution rate, where the asset allocation decision is designed to achieve this objective. This is done by splitting the problem into two main steps. First, the Markowitz mean-variance model is generalised to include three types of pension scheme liabilities (actives, deferreds and pensioners), and this model is used to generate the efficient set of asset allocations. Second, for each point on the risk-return efficient set of the asset-liability portfolio model, the mathematical model of Haberman (1992) is used to compute the corresponding mean and variance of the contribution rate and funding ratio. Since the Haberman model assumes that the discount rate for computing the present value of liabilities equals the investment return, it is generalised to avoid this restriction. This generalisation removes the trade-off between contribution rate risk and funding ratio risk for a <b>fixed</b> <b>spread</b> period. Pension schemes need to choose a spread period, and it is shown how this can be set to minimise the variance of the contribution rate. Finally, using the result that the funding ratio follows an inverted gamma distribution, shortfall risk and expected tail loss are computed for funding below the minimum funding requirement, and funding above the taxation limit. This model is then applied to one of the largest UK pension schemes - the Universities Superannuation Scheme...|$|E

40|$|M. Comm. Fixed-income {{securities}} as {{an asset}} class form {{an integral part of}} investment portfolios. Turnover in the South African bond market during 2009 was R 13. 4 trillion. Normal coupon bonds are traded in the market on a yield-to-maturity basis, and the price of the bond is calculated using a formula based on the sum of all the present values of the future cash flows of the bond. The bond-pricing formula makes the assumption that coupons can be reinvested at the same yield as the current yield-tomaturity. If the investor invests the coupons at a different rate when coupons are paid out, the investor will realise a different yield on the investment. Interest rates are not static, but instead volatile, or change over time and maturity. The term structure of interest rates are of a dynamic nature and the slope of the yield curve changes as market forces impact on short-, medium- and long-term interest rates. The bond-pricing formula ignores the term structure of interest rate. Bonds with similar terms-to-maturity, trading at the same yield-to-maturity and different coupon rates, will produce different returns to investors because of the reinvestment of the coupons in the future. Zero-volatility spreads are calculated by determining the present value of each individual future cash flow of a bond at the relevant point on the yield curve. The sum of all these present values is then compared to the price of the bond. The zerovolatility spread will be equal to a <b>fixed</b> <b>spread</b> to the yield curve, and this will result in the present value of future cash flows at the yield curve and the bond price being equal to each other. Yield curves in this study are constructed as zero-coupon curves with money market, FRA and swap rates as inputs to the calculation thereof. Different methods of determining portfolio returns are investigated to enable the researcher to distinguish between the returns of two bond portfolios. Two portfolios with similar bonds with different zero-volatility spreads are compiled, and similarities in bond portfolios are tested with price value of a basis point, duration and convexity. The returns of these two portfolios are measured and compared over the period 30 September 2000 to 30 November 2009 in order to determine whether zero-volatility spreads as an evaluative tool can optimise bond portfolio returns...|$|E

The identification and modelling of carbonate cemented zones represents one of the many challenges facing the world leading Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) CO 2 CRC Otway Project in Victoria. Carbonate cemented zones are low permeability dolomite-dominated zones that form at the meteoric-saline water interface within winnowed tidal bar sandstones deposited in deltaic-marginal marine environments. Successful identification of these zones from wireline log data requires the creation of empirical tools that combine statistical analysis with geological interpretation. The Mean-Probability Log and the Vshale Facies Log are two empirical tools that, when combined, can successfully identify carbonate cemented zones from well log data. The Mean-Probability Log is derived from available well data contained at CRC- 2 which includes the CCA_ 20 log (Elemental Capture Spectroscopy) and CarbCmnt log (carbonate cemented zones prediction log). These logs, combined with conventional raw and derived logs (Gamma, Sonic, Neutron, Density, Shallow Resistivity, Deep Resistivity, and Ratio) were used to create binned distributions required for a probability distribution model. Probability values from the model were incorporated into individual carbonate cement predictions logs for each of the raw and derived logs. An average of these logs resulted {{in the creation of a}} carbonate cemented prediction Mean-Probability Log. Flexibility of the Mean-Probability Log revealed only a variance of 13 samples when compared to Mean-Probability Logs lacking one of the key logs (e. g. Gamma). Calculation of a statistically derived cutoff was incorporated using the mode, standard deviation and a <b>fixed</b> <b>spread</b> (variance). Creation of a Vshale Facies Log was undertaken to assist accuracy of the Mean-Probability Log in predicting carbonate cemented zones within winnowed sandstones. The facies component of the log was derived from reclassification of an existing core-derived facies log used at CRC- 2, whilst the clay-content (Vcl) of the log was derived from an existing Petrolog algorithm used in the Darling Basin of NSW. A cutoff value for CRC- 2 (Vcl value of 0. 6) was established for sandstones that are hosts for known carbonate cemented zones. Both the Mean-Probability Log and the Vshale Facies Log were successfully applied to both selected Otway Basin (onshore and offshore) and Bass Basin wells. Carbonate cemented zone analysis revealed a total of 126 carbonate cemented zones in onshore Otway Basin, 53 in offshore Otway Basin, and 7 in the Bass Basin. Interpretation of carbonate cemented zone results revealed a decrease in thickness and increase in clay-content from the Port Campbell Embayment to Shipwreck Trough in the Otway Basin, and a localised accumulation along the Pelican and Dondu Troughs within the Bass Basin.

We consider a HARQ based on incremental redundancy (IR) strategy.

In order to effectively exploit the channel frequency-selectivity and the channel coding, the spreading factor is changed between the initial transmission and the succeeding retransmissions. The throughput performance of HARQ with VSF in a frequency-selective Rayleigh fading channel is evaluated by the computer simulation and compared with that with <b>fixed</b> <b>spreading</b> factor (FSF). It is shown that HARQ with VSF can provide better throughput performance than with FSF and is particularly useful when high-level modulation (e. g., 16 QAM and 64 QAM) is used.
