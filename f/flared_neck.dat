5000|$|In 1957, a {{new breed}} of streetlight fixture was introduced; the [...] "cobraheads". If viewed from beneath they resembled a cobra's <b>flared</b> <b>neck.</b> Westinghouse dubbed its cobraheads the Silverliners, which {{remained}} in production over the next 25 years. The OV-25 remains a popular streetlight fixture.|$|E
5000|$|The term 'frilly-based tyg' {{is used in}} some English archaeological {{literature}} {{to refer to a}} type of medieval and early post-medieval drinking mug or pitcher, usually wheel-thrown with a rounded belly and a straight or <b>flared</b> <b>neck,</b> which may have one or more handles. The 'frilly base' refers to the foot-ring of the mug, which after throwing was given an alternating bossed and indented form by manual shaping with fingers or thumbs. This style was popularized from c. 1300 onwards in hard-fired Rhenish wares, for example in ash-glazed wares from Siegburg, near Bonn, Germany, and later in salt-glazed wares like those from Raeren, eastern Belgium. These were imported to England in large quantities and were imitated in English stoneware and earthenware.|$|E
50|$|Kindleoceras is {{characterized}} by a gently curved or virtually straight shell, the cross section of which is triangular with flattened dorsum and subangular venter.The siphuncle is small, ventral, cyrtochoanitic with outwardly <b>flared</b> <b>necks,</b> thickened rings, and well developed radial internal actinosiphonate deposits.|$|R

50|$|The siphuncle of Oonoceras is cyrtochoanitic. Septal <b>necks</b> <b>flare</b> {{outwardly}} {{and unlike}} Oocerina, are empty. Segments are either slightly or broadly expanded into the chambers.|$|R
5000|$|Among {{the various}} types of rhyta and horns, the one with an animal head {{termination}} on a long horn seems the least popular in the Near and Middle Eastern cultural domains. The horns are usually provided with an animal forepart, while the simple heads of rather large dimensions are typically combined with a straight or <b>flaring</b> calyx-like <b>neck.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Polyelasmoceratidae is {{a family}} of oncocerid nautiloids {{characterized}} by rapidly expanding endogastrically curved shells, curved such that the ventral side is longitudinally concave. In cross section shells are typically tear-drop in shape to subtriangular. The siphuncle is typically nummuloidal, like a string of beads, with outwardly <b>flared</b> septal <b>necks,</b> and located between {{the center and the}} venter. Most contain radially lamellar actinosiphonate deposits.|$|R
5000|$|Tripteroceroides has a depressed, apically curved, {{straight}} shell {{with the}} under side (the venter) flatter than the upper (the dorsum). Sutures have slight lobes (to a rear inflections) as {{they cross the}} upper and lower sides, and saddles (diversions to the front) on either flank. The suture is subventral (near the lower side), with <b>flared</b> out <b>necks</b> and subcylindrical segments, sharply reduced in diameter at either end.|$|R
50|$|The {{adult male}} has {{distinctive}} multicolored iridescent plumage and red eyes,with a distinctive white <b>flare</b> down the <b>neck.</b> The female, less colorful, has a white eye-ring and a whitish throat. Both adults have crested heads.|$|R
50|$|It {{was first}} studied by Lorraine Copeland and Peter Wescombe in 1965-1966. A {{wide variety of}} {{materials}} were recovered from the site and its immediate area that are now held in the Saint Joseph University in Beirut. Stone tools from the surface included numerous short, wide, sickle blades with fine denticulation or nibbling along with tanged arrowheads, scrapers, chisels, axes, burins, obsidian and a small green stone axe. Pottery resembled middle periods at Byblos and coloured similar to at Ard Tlaili with red or black washes. Both fine and coarse shards were found of jars {{with a variety of}} collared and <b>flared</b> <b>necks</b> and flat bases along with bow rims such as those found at Jericho. Vessels were decorated with stabbed and incised designs, finger pressed around the rim and smoothed by hand or with straw. A painted lattice pattern was detected on at least one piece. Comparisons were made with middle and late Neolithic periods at Byblos showing inhabitation from several phases. The site was also used in Bronze Age and Classical times and material from these phases has been found over a wide area around the site.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{characteristics}} of early Shang zun's {{consisted of a}} <b>flaring</b> mouth, high <b>neck</b> and a large body. The zun's also had wide shoulders and a foot ring. During the early Western Zhou there was a zun modeled after a gu but was thicker, larger and the body portion is swelled more {{than that of a}} gu. [...] Flanges appear begin to appear on the vessels body and neck while the same decoration is used. The shoulders consist of small animal heads. Late Shang to Early Zhou Zuns are slim. The flanges start {{from the mouth of the}} vessel and down the body ending before the foot ring. The flanges are identical showing symmetry. [...] Early Western Zhou zun are shorter, rounder and smoother. The relief of the vessel emphasizes the form removing the flanges. The bird motif is more prominent now than in the previous vessels.|$|R
25|$|Injuries {{affected}} {{the selection of}} the two sides for the final Test. Mike Hendrick was still suffering from his hamstring, Bob Willis from his troubled knees, so Peter Lever was brought in for Willis and Chris Old's good form was finally rewarded with a Test place instead of the veteran Fred Titmus. David Lloyd had an old football injury to his <b>neck</b> <b>flare</b> up and Colin Cowdrey took his place as makeshift opener. John Edrich had now recovered from his broken ribs and was recalled to the team in place rather than the out of form Brian Luckhurst. Jeff Thomson was out with his tennis shoulder and Australia brought in Geoff Dymock, a fast-medium left-arm bowler who had taken a wicket with his second ball the previous year at Adelaide. After top-scoring at Sydney the leg-spinner Terry Jenner was dropped for the return of batsman Ross Edwards. Despite the hot weather a thunderstorm wetted the covers before the match and the groundsmen spilled water on the wicket when removing them in the morning, which would drastically affect play. Ian Chappell won the toss for the fifth time in the series and chosen to bat, probably as he underestimated the amount of water on the wicket which was otherwise excellent for batting.|$|R

60|$|The low {{building}} {{had the look}} of having once been a mill. There was a rotten wart of wood upon its forehead that seemed to indicate where the sails had been, but the whole was very indistinctly seen in the obscurity of the night. The boy lifted the latch of the door, and they passed at once into a low circular room, where a man stood before a red fire, looking down into it, and a girl sat engaged in needlework. The fire was in a rusty brazier, not fitted to the hearth; and a common lamp, shaped like a hyacinth-root, smoked and <b>flared</b> in the <b>neck</b> of a stone bottle on the table. There was a wooden bunk or berth in a corner, and in another corner a wooden stair leading above--so clumsy and steep that it was little better than a ladder. Two or three old sculls and oars stood against the wall, and against another part of the wall was a small dresser, making a spare show of the commonest articles of crockery and cooking-vessels. The roof of the room was not plastered, but was formed of the flooring of the room above. This, being very old, knotted, seamed, and beamed, gave a lowering aspect to the chamber; and roof, and walls, and floor, alike abounding in old smears of flour, red-lead (or some such stain which it had probably acquired in warehousing), and damp, alike had a look of decomposition.|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectivesThis study aims to {{evaluate}} outcomes following EVAR {{in patients with}} hostile neck anatomy (HNA). MethodsData prospectively collected from 552 elective EVARs were analysed retrospectively. Data regarding neck morphology was obtained from aneurysm stent plans produced prior to EVAR. HNA was defined as any of; neck diameter > 28  mm, neck angulation > 60 °, neck length < 15  mm, neck thrombus, or <b>neck</b> <b>flare.</b> Results 552 patients underwent EVAR. Mean age 73. 9 years, mean follow-up 4. 1 years. 199 patients had HNA, 353 had favourable neck anatomy (FNA). There was {{a significant increase in}} late type I endoleaks (FNA 4. 5 %, HNA 9. 5 %; P =  0. 02) and total reinterventions (FNA 11. 0 %, HNA 22. 8 %; P <  0. 01), and a significant decrease in late type II endoleaks in patients with HNA (FNA 16. 7 %, HNA 10. 6 %; P <  0. 05). There {{was no significant difference in}} technical success (FNA 0. 6 %, HNA 2. 0 %; p =  0. 12), 30 -day re-intervention (FNA 2. 8 %, HNA 5. 0 %; P =  0. 12), 30 -day mortality (FNA 1. 1 %, HNA 0. 5 %; P =  0. 45), 30 -day type I endoleaks (FNA 0. 8 %, HNA 2. 5 %; P =  0. 12), 5 -year mortality (FNA 15. 1 %, HNA 14. 6 %; P =  0. 86), aneurysm-related mortality (FNA 1. 7 % versus HNA 2. 0 %; P =  0. 79), stent-graft migration (FNA 2. 5 %, HNA 3. 0 %; P =  0. 75), sac expansion (FNA 13. 0 %, HNA 9. 5 %; P =  0. 22), or graft rupture (FNA 1. 1 %, HNA 3. 5 %; P =  0. 05). Binary logistic regression of individual features of HNA revealed secondary intervention (P =  0. 009), technical failure (P =  0. 02), and late type I endoleaks (P =  0. 002), were significantly increased with increased neck diameter. ConclusionsHNA AAAs can be successfully treated with EVAR. However, surveillance is necessary to detect and treat late type I endoleaks in HNA patients...|$|R
