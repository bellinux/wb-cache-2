50|$|Light {{transmission}} (for this article, the perceivable {{visible spectrum}} between 390 nm and 750 nm is considered) through glass is diminished either by light reflection or light absorption of the <b>glazing</b> <b>material.</b> The total light transferred through the <b>glazing</b> <b>material</b> (light transmission) {{is reduced by}} reflection and/or absorption. In art framing, light reflection causes glare, while light absorption also may cause the transmitted colors to be dulled or distorted. While type of the glass substrate will affect the light absorption of the glazing, the surface treatment can affect light scattering, light reflection and in some cases, light absorption. There are various glazing options {{to achieve this goal}} as explained in the following sections on Types of Picture Framing Glass.|$|R

5000|$|Unglazed systems, or transpired {{air systems}} {{have been used to}} heat make-up or {{ventilation}} air in commercial, industrial, agriculture and process applications. They consist of an absorber plate which air passes across or through as it scrubs heat from the absorber. Non-tranparent <b>glazing</b> <b>materials</b> are less expensive, and decrease expected payback periods. Transpired collectors are considered [...] "unglazed" [...] because their collector surfaces are exposed to the elements, are often not transparent and not hermetically sealed.|$|E
5000|$|Glazes need {{to include}} a ceramic flux which {{functions}} by promoting partial liquefaction in the clay bodies and the other <b>glaze</b> <b>materials.</b> Fluxes lower the high melting point of the glass formers silica, and sometimes boron trioxide. These glass former may {{be included in the}} <b>glaze</b> <b>materials,</b> or may be drawn from the clay beneath. [...] Raw <b>materials</b> of ceramic <b>glazes</b> generally include silica, which will be the main glass former. Various metal oxides, such as sodium, potassium and calcium, act as a flux to lower the melting temperature. Alumina, often derived from clay, stiffens the molten glaze to prevent it from running off the piece. Colorants, such as iron oxide, copper carbonate or cobalt carbonate, and sometimes opacifiers such as tin oxide or zirconium oxide, are used to modify the visual appearance of the fired glaze.|$|R

5000|$|P was {{severely}} injured {{when he fell}} through the glass door enclosing his tub in his apartment he was renting. It was not possible for P or his wife {{to determine if the}} glass was tempered or just ordinary glass. After the accident, the glass was found to be just ordinary glass. P sued Klein (D), his landlord, for the injuries. At trial, P introduced expert evidence about the custom and usage of tempered glass from 1956 to 1976. Since at least the early 1950s, a practice of using shatterproof <b>glazing</b> <b>materials</b> for bathroom enclosures had come into common use, so that by 1976 the glass door here no longer conformed to accepted safety standards. P also showed that over this period bulletins of nationally recognized safety and consumer organizations along with official Federal publications had joined in warning of the dangers that lurked when plain glass was utilized in [...] "hazardous locations", including [...] "bathtub enclosures". Over objection, the trial court also allowed in sections of New York's General Business Law, which, as of July 1, 1973, required, on pain of criminal sanctions, that only [...] "safety glazing material" [...] be used in all bathroom enclosures. D's managing agent admitted that, since at least 1965, it was customary for landlords who had occasion to install glass for shower enclosures, to replace the glass with [...] "some material such as plastic or safety glass". P was given the verdict by the jury. The appellate division reversed the decision awarding P damages; D was under no common law duty to replace the glass unless he had prior notice of the danger. P appealed. The Court of Appeals reversed and ordered a new trial.|$|E

50|$|He {{established}} his practice in 1878, and for 10 years worked {{in partnership with}} William de Morgan (1839-1917), for whom he designed tiles, vases, and other artefacts. He advocated the use of <b>glazed</b> <b>materials</b> to resist the polluted atmosphere of nineteenth century London. In this, he anticipated the designs of Otto Wagner in Vienna, who used coloured tiles set in the same planes as walls and piers to suggest architectural features. He designed several buildings, of which the best were the Howrah Station, gateway to Calcutta, situated in the twin city Howrah, district Howrah, West Bengal, India (1901; with a glowing exterior of brick and coloured tiles), and Debenham House in Holland Park (1905-8), completely faced with impervious <b>glazed</b> <b>materials,</b> even the roof-tiles. He was an Arts-and-Crafts architect, whose work was extraordinarily sensitive, imaginative, and original. Among his works his own house, ‘Woodside’, Graffham, near Petworth, Sussex (1905), deserves note.|$|R

The results of the simulations showed a handsome potential savings, over several standard glazing types, for selective transmitters of both the fixed and switchable variety. Fixed transmitters were also excellent performers,several configurations offering savings often only slightly lower than the highest savings attained in the switchable group. The switchable transmitter group contained glazings which produced the lowest annual loads. The primary reductions were made in cooling loads without dramatic increases in lighting loads, but heating savings, resulting primarily from <b>glazing</b> <b>materials</b> of high thermal resistance, proved to be significant in cold climates. by William A.

40|$|Abstract. Red mud is {{the main}} solid residue {{generated}} during the production of alumina {{by means of the}} Bayer process. In order to expand the comprehensive utilization field of red mud and develop new ceramic products with low radioactivity utilizing red mud, the exploration of preparing self-releasing <b>glaze</b> ceramic <b>materials</b> using red mud as raw material was carried out. During the exploration, the self-releasing <b>glaze</b> ceramic <b>materials</b> with low radiation level were produced by normal pressure sintering process using the main ingredients of red mud, red sandstone, barium carbonate and ball clay. The properties of the self-releasing glaze ceramic samples were investigated by the measurements of mechanical properties, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and radiation measurement. The results show that the self-releasing <b>glaze</b> ceramic <b>materials</b> have good mechanical properties (the bulk density, 3. 10 g/cm 3; the compressive strength, 78. 00 MPa). Adding barium carbonate to the raw materials and then calcine them to ceramics, which can extend the sintering temperature range and the radioactivity level of the self-releasing <b>glaze</b> ceramic <b>materials</b> can be reduced to that of the natural radioactive background of Guilin Area, Karst landform (the average 60 Total/Timer) ...|$|R

In order to save energy in buildings without interfering with visual activities that require specific lighting levels, it is necessary to take into account not only the amount, but also the quality of lighting that has an impact on workplaces.
