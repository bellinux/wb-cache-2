5|$|A {{controversial}} strategy {{proposed by}} Gale {{results in a}} decisive victory in District 2, enabling the rebels to launch a final assault against the Capitol itself. Katniss is assigned to a squad and sent to a relatively quiet sector so that a film crew can shoot propaganda. President Coin sends Peeta along, {{even though he is}} still dangerous and unpredictable. From this, Katniss suspects Coin wants her dead because she <b>has</b> <b>too</b> much influence and has not shown much support for Coin.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to Ka, {{which is a}} measure of how much energy is needed to stretch the bilayer, Kb {{is a measure of}} how much energy is needed to bend or flex the bilayer. Formally, bending modulus is defined as the energy required to deform a membrane from its intrinsic curvature to some other curvature. Intrinsic curvature is defined by the ratio of the diameter of the head group to that of the tail group. For two-tailed PC lipids, this ratio is nearly one so the intrinsic curvature is nearly zero. If a particular lipid <b>has</b> <b>too</b> large a deviation from zero intrinsic curvature it will not form a bilayer and will instead form other phases such as micelles or inverted micelles. Addition of small hydrophilic molecules like sucrose into mixed lipid lamellar liposomes made from galactolipid-rich thylakoid membranes destabilises bilayers into micellar phase. Typically, Kb is not measured experimentally but rather is calculated from measurements of Ka and bilayer thickness, since the three parameters are related.|$|E
5|$|Montgomery County, Maryland, {{similarly}} approved {{plans to}} install 20 stations and 200 bikes in the Rockville and Shady Grove areas near Washington Metro stations and high-traffic destinations such as Montgomery College and Rockville Town Center. The expansion {{will be paid}} for by a $1.288 million grant from the National Capital Region Transportation Planning Board with a $688,000 local match. Officials also cited plans to add 50 stations and 400 bicycles in southern areas of the county, including Bethesda, Silver Spring, Friendship Heights, and Takoma Park. However, bicycling advocates cautioned that clusters of stations in the county could be too far from each other as well as the larger network of stations within neighboring Washington, D.C. There was also concern that the county <b>has</b> <b>too</b> few bike lanes and trails to support the expected number of users. Despite these concerns, Montgomery County added its first stations in May 2013.|$|E

5|$|Stringer also struggles, {{having been}} cut off by Avon's drug {{suppliers}} and left with increasingly poor-quality product. He again goes behind Avon's back, giving up half of Avon's most prized territory to a rival named Proposition Joe {{in exchange for a}} share of his supply. Avon, unaware of the arrangement, assumes that Joe and other dealers are moving into his territory simply because the Barksdale organization <b>has</b> <b>too</b> few enforcers. He contracts a feared assassin named Brother Mouzone. Stringer deals with this by tricking his old adversary Omar into believing that Mouzone was responsible for the vicious killing of his partner in their feud in season one. Seeking revenge, Omar shoots Mouzone but, realizing Stringer has lied to him, calls 9-1-1. Mouzone recovers and leaves Baltimore, and Stringer (now with Avon's consent) is able to continue his arrangement with Proposition Joe.|$|E
5|$|X-rays {{are used}} to produce the {{diffraction}} pattern because their wavelength λ is typically the same order of magnitude (1–100 angstroms) as the spacing d between planes in the crystal. In principle, any wave impinging on a regular array of scatterers produces diffraction, as predicted first by Francesco Maria Grimaldi in 1665. To produce significant diffraction, the spacing between the scatterers and the wavelength of the impinging wave should be similar in size. For illustration, the diffraction of sunlight through a bird's feather was first reported by James Gregory in the later 17th century. The first artificial diffraction gratings for visible light were constructed by David Rittenhouse in 1787, and Joseph von Fraunhofer in 1821. However, visible light <b>has</b> <b>too</b> long a wavelength (typically, 5500 angstroms) to observe diffraction from crystals. Prior to the first X-ray diffraction experiments, the spacings between lattice planes in a crystal were not known with certainty.|$|E

25|$|The planet Mars is {{too cold}} and <b>has</b> <b>too</b> little {{atmospheric}} pressure {{to permit the}} pooling of liquid water. Geologic evidence appears to confirm, however, that ancient lakes once formed on the surface. It {{is also possible that}} volcanic activity on Mars will occasionally melt subsurface ice, creating large temporary lakes. This water would quickly freeze and then sublimate, unless insulated in some manner, such as by a coating of volcanic ash.|$|E

25|$|At {{the junior}} high level (grades 7–8), there is no {{athletic}} competition beyond the district level. Sixth grade students may only compete in athletics if they will be too old the following year to compete on a seventh-grade team or if a junior high school <b>has</b> <b>too</b> few seventh- and eighth-grade students to field a combined team. With only a few exceptions due to disability, sixth-graders {{are not allowed to}} compete in individual sports.|$|E
25|$|The problem—which also {{exists in}} the State Senate—can be boiled down to a single {{overarching}} issue: The Assembly speaker <b>has</b> <b>too</b> much power. He controls everything, from the legislation that can be voted on to how his normally docile members vote on it. He decides what the Assembly will accept in a state budget. He negotiates secretly {{with the other two}} leaders to hammer out important, expensive and far-reaching laws. And he ignores the wishes of less-exalted lawmakers.|$|E
25|$|There {{are still}} 164 state-run grammar schools in existence. Only a few areas keep a formal grammar school system {{along the lines}} of the Tripartite System. In these areas, the eleven plus exam is used solely to {{identify}} a subset of children (around 25%) considered suitable for grammar education. When a grammar school <b>has</b> <b>too</b> many qualified applicants, other criteria are used to allocate places, such as siblings, distance or faith. Such systems still exist in Buckinghamshire, Rugby and Stratford districts of Warwickshire, the Salisbury district of Wiltshire and most of Lincolnshire, Kent, Reading and Medway.|$|E

5000|$|Queuing {{problems}} are usually due {{to too many}} servers or too little servers. Although <b>having</b> <b>too</b> many servers cause rapid service, workers become idle and equipment becomes under-utilized. On the other hand, <b>having</b> <b>too</b> little servers creates long queues, frustrates customers, and congests areas. Thus, correct and balanced queue management is necessary.|$|R
25|$|In {{classical}} physics, when a ball is rolled {{slowly up}} a large hill, it will {{come to a stop}} and roll back, because it doesn't have enough energy to get {{over the top of the}} hill to the other side. However, the Schrödinger equation predicts that there is a small probability that the ball will get to the other side of the hill, even if it <b>has</b> <b>too</b> little energy to reach the top. This is called quantum tunneling. It is related to the distribution of energy: although the ball's assumed position seems to be on one side of the hill, there is a chance of finding it on the other side.|$|E
25|$|The {{race has}} {{finished}} since 1975 with laps of the Champs-Élysées. This stage rarely challenges the leader {{because it is}} flat and the leader usually <b>has</b> <b>too</b> much time in hand to be denied. But in 1987, Pedro Delgado broke away on the Champs to challenge the 40-second lead held by Stephen Roche. He and Roche finished in the peloton and Roche won the Tour. In modern times, there {{tends to be a}} gentlemen's agreement: while the points classification is still contended if possible, the overall classification is not fought over; because of this, {{it is not uncommon for}} the de facto winner of the overall classification to ride into Paris holding a glass of champagne.|$|E
25|$|Most often, sword {{fighting}} duels {{occur when}} two ships collide during naval combat. Sword fights can also break out during attacks on cities, {{particularly if the}} city <b>has</b> <b>too</b> few defenders to mount a battle outside the city gates, but also if the player manages to reach the town gates during such land battles without first having defeated the enemy force. During these two kinds of fights, the player's crew and the enemy crew will have an important influence on combat. Crew sizes and morale dictate which side {{is more likely to}} lose men during the conflict - any men lost on one side will cause a reduced effectiveness of that side's leader's combat moves.|$|E

Afraid that he will reveal too much, Frodo climbs on a table and begins to sing and dance to {{distract}} the crowd. However, he slips, and the Ring lands on his finger, turning him invisible. An angry ranger takes the hobbits into another room, warning them they are drawing {{too much attention to}} themselves. He introduces himself as Strider (Daran Norris) and asks if he may join them on their journey. At this point, the innkeeper, Barliman Butterbur (Daran Norris), arrives with a letter from Gandalf which informs Frodo that Strider is really Aragorn, a trusted friend. Attracted by Frodo's accidental use of the Ring, the Nazgûl come to Bree, but Aragorn successfully hides the hobbits.|$|E
25|$|Chapter Six – Pig and Pepper: A Fish-Footman has an {{invitation}} for the Duchess of the house, which he delivers to a Frog-Footman. Alice observes this transaction and, after a perplexing conversation with the frog, lets herself into the house. The Duchess's Cook is throwing dishes and making a soup that <b>has</b> <b>too</b> much pepper, which causes Alice, the Duchess, and her baby (but not the cook or grinning Cheshire Cat) to sneeze violently. Alice is given the baby by the Duchess and to her surprise, the baby turns into a pig. The Cheshire Cat appears in a tree, directing her to the March Hare's house. He disappears, but his grin remains behind to float on its own in the air, prompting Alice to remark that she has often seen a cat without a grin but never a grin without a cat.|$|E
25|$|Penalties {{are awarded}} {{if a player}} is caught offside, is {{involved}} in foul play, offends at the tackle, ruck or maul, or is involved in dangerous play at scrums and line-outs. Foul play includes intentionally or repeatedly offending, throwing the ball into touch, obstructing the opposition, or misconduct. Examples of misconduct are striking, stamping, kicking or tripping players, illegal tackles and contact with players after they have kicked the ball. Dangerous play at line-outs is pushing, charging, obstructing or levering on an opponent. Dangerous play at scrums is charging at opponents not correctly binding to opponents, the hooker swinging (using both feet to strike the ball), twisting, dipping or lifting an opponent collapsing. Other offences that result in penalties are if a team <b>has</b> <b>too</b> many players, wearing illegal clothing, throwing the ball deliberately into touch, intentionally knocking the ball on, not releasing the ball if taking into touch, incorrect numbers in a scrum, handing in the scrum and the scrumhalf kicking {{the ball in the}} scrum.|$|E
