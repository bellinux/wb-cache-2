500|$|Bryan Enk, {{writing for}} UGO, {{states that the}} myth-making story of Söze's origins is a classic ghost story that would be right at home in horror fiction. Writing about psychopaths in film, {{academic}} Wayne Wilson explicitly compares Söze to Satan and assigns to him demonic motives. Wilson states that Söze allows himself to be caught <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> his superiority over the police; this compromises his ultimate goal of anonymity, but Söze can not {{resist the urge to}} show off and create mischief. In The Journal of Nietzsche Studies, Lewis Call states that Söze's mythological status draws the ire of the authoritarian government agents because he [...] "represents a terrifying truth: that power is ephemeral, and has no basis in reality." [...] According to Call, Söze's intermediaries – the [...] "usual suspects" [...] themselves – are more useful to the police, as they represent an easily controlled and intimidated criminal underworld, in direct contrast to Söze himself.|$|E

2500|$|Larry David (Larry David) – Candid, neurotic, but {{generally}} disposed to pursue what he perceives {{to be the}} right course, Larry often finds himself in awkward situations that arise {{as a result of his}} obstinate belief in his own ethical principles and codes of conduct, which he is nevertheless prepared to bend when it suits him. He usually has good intentions but often finds himself a victim of circumstance and social convention, as many of the people around him are also self-centered and stubborn. He often focuses on petty details and stubbornly holds to his opinion to the extent of aggravating everyone around him <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> an insignificant point. The real-life Larry David has commented that although he secretly wishes to be more like his fictionalized version on the series, he could never be that way because he is a lot more cautious when it comes to social tension. Larry's trademark behaviors are his probing stare when he doesn't think somebody is telling the truth, fondly saying something is [...] "prett-ay, prett-ay, prett-ay, pretty good" [...] and, when caught up short in a moment of poor or contrary behavior, quizzically and mock-innocently inquiring, often of his wife, Cheryl, or of a close friend, [...] "No good?" [...] Among Larry's characteristics are his love of playing golf and his annoyance at having to engage in small talk, especially with people he deals with in commercial situations, such as waiters and tradesmen. Larry also humorously explores various aspects of Jewish life, history, and culture.|$|E
