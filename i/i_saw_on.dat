And domestic violence is far more complicated than that. We're watching someone rationalize a domestic violence relationship {{and this is the}} kind of thought process that actually goes on in real life. It’s not satire anymore." ...|$|E

[...] "I think Ben Ward will go down {{as one of the greatest}} police commissioners this city has ever had. Bob McGuire is the other, and I appointed both of them."

2500|$|The first concerted Mongol {{invasion}} of Jin occurred in 1211 and total conquest was not accomplished until 1234. In 1232 the Mongols besieged the Jin capital of Kaifeng and deployed gunpowder weapons {{along with other}} more conventional siege techniques such as building stockades, watchtowers, trenches, guardhouses, and forcing Chinese captives to haul supplies and fill moats. Jin scholar Liu Qi (劉祈) recounts in his memoir, [...] "the attack against the city walls grew increasingly intense, and bombs rained down as [...] advanced." [...] The Jin defenders also deployed gunpowder bombs as well as fire arrows (huo jian 火箭) launched using a type of early solid-propellant rocket. Of the bombs, Liu Qi writes, [...] "From within the walls the defenders responded with a gunpowder bomb called the heaven-shaking-thunder bomb (震天雷). Whenever the [...] troops encountered one, several men at a time would be turned into ashes." [...] A more fact based and clear description of the bomb exists in the History of Jin: [...] "The heaven-shaking-thunder bomb is an iron vessel filled with gunpowder. When lighted with fire and shot off, it goes off like a crash of thunder that can be heard for a hundred li , burning an expanse of land {{more than half a}} mu , and the fire can even penetrate iron armor." [...] A Ming official named He Mengchuan would encounter an old cache of these bombs three centuries later in the Xi'an area: [...] "When I went on official business to Shaanxi Province, <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>on</b> top of Xi'an's city walls an old stockpile of iron bombs. They were called 'heaven-shaking-thunder' bombs, and they were like an enclosed rice bowl with a hole at the top, just big enough to put your finger in. The troops said they hadn't been used for a very long time." [...] Furthermore, he wrote, [...] "When the powder goes off, the bomb rips open, and the iron pieces fly in all directions. That is how it is able to kill people and horses from far away." ...|$|E
2500|$|Who is {{homosexual}}? My {{answer is}} that a homosexual is somebody who is abnormal because the normal person was created to be attracted to the opposite sex ... to procreate and perpetuate the human race. ... y bishop of North Ankole, Rt. Rev. Muhanguzi ... asked the following question: ... How can God contradict himself by saying in the Book of Genesis that Adam {{should be given a}} wife, Eve, and then also create homosexuals? ... However, now that I have been forced to concentrate my mind on this issue by the actions {{of a small group of}} our MPs led by the Rt. Hon. Kadaga, I can see the fallacy of Bishop Muhanguzi's position. ... Do Albinos create themselves? No. Simply, nature goes wrong in a minority of cases. ... The question at the core of the debate of the homosexuals is: [...] "What do we do with an abnormal person? Do we kill him/her? Do we imprison him/her? Or do we contain him/her?" ... Apart from the people who are born abnormal, it seems there is a larger group of those that become homosexual for mercenary reasons - they get recruited on account of financial inducements. ... How about the women lesbians? Apart from the ones who are born abnormal and the ones that may become lesbian for mercenary reasons, there may be those that go into that practice because of sexual starvation when they fail to get married. Women are normally more [...] than men.... In the past, this imbalance could have been addressed by polygamy. ... The groups that can be rescued ... are those who are homosexual or lesbian for mercenary reasons or on account of ... failure to get legal partners. The rescue for these mercenary deviants is, first and foremost, economic - rapidly industrialize Uganda, modernize agriculture, etc. ... In addition ... we should legislate harshly against those people with money, from within and without, who take advantange of the desperation of our youth to lure them into these abnormal and deviant behaviors. I would support a life sentence.... On this one I would agree with the Bill passed by Parliament. The unanswered question, however, is: What do you do with the really abnormal people? ... Only the other day, <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>on</b> television that Dr. Allan Turing, the genius mathematician that cracked the German Enigma code for the anti-Hitler alliance ... was a homosexual. This man ... enabled them to win the war. Yet, the British chemically castrated him in 1952, where-upon he committed suicide, apparently. Were the British correct in handling that issue like that? The British no longer think so. Only the other day, the Queen had to apologize to this ... person ... much more useful to society than the millions of sexually normal people. ... he challenge is how to correctly handle the sexually abnormal on the one hand and those who use money or any other influence to recruit sexually normal people into this abnormal and disgusting behaviour. When we meet in the NRM caucus, we shall, I am sure, find a scientifically correct position.|$|E
