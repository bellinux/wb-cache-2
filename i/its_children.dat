25|$|State {{policy of}} social classes: The State enforces a rigidly {{stratified}} society with entrenched patterns of official discrimination. A citizen's potential success {{in life and}} the level of services provided by the State are predetermined by a State-assigned social class (songbun). Each individual's and family's designation is decided according to the apparatus' perception of their ideological loyalty to the regime. Discrimination applies to geographic segregation, occupation, criminal punishment, and access to food, housing, health care, and education. Applying intergenerational responsibility and collective punishment, a family's social class (songbun) is passed down to <b>its</b> <b>children</b> and grandchildren. Each individual's status is recorded in a registration system, inaccessible to him or her. The lowest songbun was given to groups including former wealthy industrialists, alleged spies, Catholics, Buddhists, and South Korean prisoners of war.|$|E

500|$|A Vindication of the Rights of Woman: with Strictures on Political and Moral Subjects (1792), {{written by}} the 18th-century British proto-feminist Mary Wollstonecraft, {{is one of the}} {{earliest}} works of feminist philosophy. In it, Wollstonecraft responds to those educational and political theorists of the 18th century who did not believe women should have an education. She argues that women ought to have an education commensurate with their position in society, claiming that women are essential to the nation because they educate <b>its</b> <b>children</b> and because they could be [...] "companions" [...] to their husbands, rather than mere wives. Instead of viewing women as ornaments to society or property to be traded in marriage, Wollstonecraft maintains that they are human beings deserving of the same fundamental rights as men.|$|E
500|$|Spoilt Rotten: The Toxic Cult of Sentimentality (subtitle in US editions: [...] How Britain is Ruined by <b>Its</b> <b>Children)</b> is a non-fiction book by the British {{writer and}} retired doctor and {{psychiatrist}} Theodore Dalrymple, {{originally published in}} 2010. Polemical in nature, the book contends that sentimentality has become culturally entrenched in British society, with harmful consequences. The author uses a range of cultural, educational, political, media and literary issues‚Äîincluding falling standards in education, UK aid policies for African development, the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, the disappearance of Madeleine McCann, and the work and life of Sylvia Plath‚Äîto illustrate {{what he sees as}} the danger of abandoning logic in favour of sentimentality, which he describes as [...] "the progenitor, the godparent, the midwife of brutality". Much of Dalrymple's analysis is underpinned by his experience of working with criminals and the mentally ill.|$|E
