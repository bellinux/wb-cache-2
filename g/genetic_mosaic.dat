5|$|The {{life cycle}} of A.gallica {{includes}} two diploidization–haploidization events. The first {{of these is the}} usual process of cell fusion (forming a diploid) followed by meiosis during the formation of haploid basidiospores. The second event is more cryptic, and occurs before fruit body formation. In most basidiomycetous fungi, the hyphae of compatible mating types will fuse to form a two-nucleate, or dikaryotic stage; this stage is not observed in Armillaria species, which have cells that are mostly monokaryotic and diploid. Genetic analyses suggest that the dikaryotic mycelia undergo an extra haploidization event prior to fruit body formation to create a <b>genetic</b> <b>mosaic.</b> These regular and repeating haploidization events result in increased genetic diversity, which helps the fungus to adapt to unfavorable changes in environmental conditions, like drought.|$|E

40|$|Leaf {{shape in}} cotton is {{regulated}} by the developmental age of the shoot and by several major genes that affect leaf lobing. The effect of these factors was investigated by allometric analysis, cell lineage analysis, and by studying {{the expression of the}} leaf shape mutation, Okra, in <b>genetic</b> <b>mosaics.</b> Allometric analysis of leaf growth suggests that leaf shape is determined during the initiation of the primordium rather than during the expansion phase of leaf growth. Clonal analysis demon-strates that both the rate and duration of cell division are fairly uniform throughout the leaf. Cells in the marginal region of the developing cotton leaf contribute more to the growth of the lamina than they do in tobacco. The Okra mutation acts early {{in the development of a}} leaf and appears to accentuate a developmental pattern that is also responsible for heteroblastic variation in leaf shape. The expression of this mutation in <b>genetic</b> <b>mosaics</b> demonstrates that its effect does not diffuse laterally within the leaf primordium.

40|$|Somatic {{mutations}} are an underappreciated {{source of}} genetic variation within multi-cellular organisms. The resulting genetic mosaicism should be particularly abundant in large clones of vegetatively propagating angiosperms. Little is known on the abundance and ecological correlates of genetic mosaicism in field populations, despite its potential evolutionary significance. Because sexual reproduction restores genetic homogeneity, we predicted that in facultatively clonally reproducing organisms, {{the prevalence of}} genetic mosaicism increases with increasing clonality. This was tested among 33 coastal locations colonized by the ecologically important marine angiosperm Zostera marina, ranging from Portugal to Finland. <b>Genetic</b> <b>mosaics</b> were detectable as complex microsatellite genotypes at two hypervariable loci that revealed additional mosaic alleles, suggesting the presence {{of one or more}} divergent cell lineages within the same ramet. The proportions of non-mosaic genotypes in a population sharply decreased below a clonal richness of 0. 2. Accordingly, more <b>genetic</b> <b>mosaics</b> were found at the southern and northern limit of the distribution of Z. marina in Europe where sexual reproduction is rare or absent.

25|$|Chromosome {{abnormalities}} can be numerical, as in {{the presence}} of extra or missing chromosomes, or structural, as in derivative chromosome, translocations, inversions, large-scale deletions or duplications. Numerical abnormalities, also known as aneuploidy, often occur as a result of nondisjunction during meiosis in the formation of a gamete; trisomies, in which three copies of a chromosome are present instead of the usual two, are common numerical abnormalities. Structural abnormalities often arise from errors in homologous recombination.

40|$|<b>Genetic</b> <b>mosaics</b> provide {{information}} about cellular lineages that is otherwise difficult to obtain, especially in humans. De novo mutations act as cell markers, allowing the tracing of developmental trajectories of all descendants of the cell in which the new mutation arises. De novo mutations may arise {{at any time during}} development but are relatively rare. They have usually been observed through medical ascertainment, when the mutation causes unusual clinical signs or symptoms. Mutational events can include aneuploidies, large chromosomal rearrangements, copy number variants, or point mutations. In this review we focus primarily on the analysis of point mutations and their utility in addressing questions of germ line versus somatic lineages. <b>Genetic</b> <b>mosaics</b> demonstrate that the germ line and soma diverge early in development, since there are many examples of combined somatic and germ line mosaicism for de novo mutations. The occurrence of simultaneous mosaicism in both the germ line and soma also shows that the germ line is not strictly clonal but arises from at least two, and possibly multiple, cells in the embryo with different ancestries. Whole genome or exome DNA sequencing technologies promise to expand the range of studies of <b>genetic</b> <b>mosaics,</b> as de novo mutations can now be identified through sequencing alone {{in the absence of a}} medical ascertainment.

This internalistic notion is based on the integration of physiological experiments, clonal analysis and <b>genetic</b> <b>mosaics</b> of morphogenetic mutants. Physiological experiments such as regeneration, cell dissociation and re-aggregation, and feeder layers, reveal the existence of regional specificities related to regional patterning, positional values and cell polarity. On the other hand, clonal analysis shows homogeneous and exponential growth by mitosis associated with oriented cell divisions along two axes of growth. Preferential mitotic orientations are also regional characteristic. Finally, <b>genetic</b> <b>mosaics</b> of morphogenetic mutants help to understand the genetic and eventually the molecular bases of morphogenesis, revealing the modes of cell behavior (such as positional accommodation, mitotic orientations, cell affinities and cell recognition) at work in the generation of the constant sizes and shapes of Drosophila imaginal structures.

The acetylcholine receptor were significantly reduced in the adult ennui in size as well as localization at the myotome segment borders of fast-twitch muscles. <b>Genetic</b> <b>mosaic</b> analysis revealed that ennui is necessary cell autonomously in muscle fibers for normal synaptic localization of acetylcholine receptors.

50|$|Cre-lox {{can also}} be used to permanently, fluorescently label cells by using a {{transgenic}} which contains a ubiquitous promoter such as β-actin driving a super-stop sequence flanked by loxP sites, upstream of a fluorescent protein sequence such as RFP. In this fashion, Julien Bertrand from David Traver's lab and Neil Chi discovered the endothelial-origin of hematopoietic (blood) stem cells in zebrafish by using a transgenic with an endothelial promoter, kdrl, driving Cre recombinase crossed to β-actin loxP transgenic fish (2010). Thus, in the presence of Cre, all endothelium-derived cells became indelibly fluorescent red since the super-stop was removed from the genome, and RFP will be expressed under the control of β-actin in all cellular progeny. Indeed, they found that nearly all hematopoietic stem cells and differentiated blood cells were RFP+, indicating their embryonic endothelial origin (See Figure 2). Similar site-directed recombination technology such as FLP-FRT recombination (Flippase and Flippase recognition target sites) is extremely powerful in cell fate mapping, ablation studies, and <b>genetic</b> <b>mosaic</b> analysis; this tool is also used heavily in studies in animal systems as divergent as mice and flies.|$|E

Subsequently, he pioneered the molecular analysis of the process of segmentation in the Drosophila embryo, through the simultaneous analysis the expression of patterns of pair rule genes using the technique of in situ hybridisation. These studies led to his interest in what is now known as the Hedgehog signalling pathway; Ingham's genetic studies identified the core components of this pathway and in particular the role of the Patched protein as the receptor for the Hedgehog ligand. In 1993, in collaboration with Andy McMahon and Cliff Tabin, Ingham's research group discovered the vertebrate homologues of the Drosophila hedgehog gene, including Sonic hedgehog. This finding set in train a surge of interest in this pathway, leading amongst other things, to the recognition of its role in a number of human cancers and {{to the development of a}} novel anti-cancer drug that specifically targets the pathway.
