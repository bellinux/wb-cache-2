5|$|Incredibly, 20 years later, {{the aquatic}} {{ecologist}} J. O. Langtry was still compelled to criticise the extremely heavy, lawless, fishing pressure, {{in the form}} of both uncontrolled small-scale commercial fishing and rampant illegal fishing, with which he was confronted in all reaches of the Murray River he <b>investigated</b> <b>in</b> 1949–1950.|$|E
5|$|Initially the {{committee}} <b>investigated</b> <b>in</b> private. On September 10, 1990, Bennett submitted a confidential report, which soon leaked, that recommended that {{the committee}} continue its investigation of Cranston, DeConcini, and Riegle, but take no action against Glenn and McCain, as there was insufficient evidence to pursue the latter two. Bennett also recommended that public hearings be held.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the trial}} judge had criticized the police investigation, Essex Police held an {{internal}} inquiry, conducted by Detective Chief Superintendent Dickinson. Bamber alleged this report confirmed that evidence had been withheld by the police, so he made a formal complaint, which was <b>investigated</b> <b>in</b> 1991 by the City of London Police. This process uncovered more documentation, which Bamber used to petition the Home Secretary in September 1993 for a referral back to the Court of Appeal, refused in July 1994.|$|E

5|$|Finite {{symmetry}} {{groups such}} as the Mathieu groups are used in coding theory, which is in turn applied in error correction of transmitted data, and in CD players. Another application is differential Galois theory, which characterizes functions having antiderivatives of a prescribed form, giving group-theoretic criteria for when solutions of certain differential equations are well-behaved. Geometric properties that remain stable under group actions are <b>investigated</b> <b>in</b> (geometric) invariant theory.|$|E
5|$|Frome is {{reputed to}} have one or more systems of tunnels beneath {{the streets of the}} older parts of the town. Some entrances are visible above ground; for example in the wall at the top of Stony Street, with other entrances in the cellars of shops and houses. Their purpose and full extent remain unknown but they have been <b>investigated</b> <b>in</b> recent years by at least one local group and a {{documentary}} has been made.|$|E
5|$|It is {{acceptable}} to defend from a violent attack anywhere on the street especially {{when a person is}} attacked with a knife or another deadly weapon. Shooting an unarmed attacker also occurs and becomes sometimes a subject of controversy. In general, each case is <b>investigated</b> <b>in</b> great detail before being eventually dismissed as a legitimate self-defense. The defense is judged according to the subjective and objective perception of the defender {{during the time of the}} imminent or ongoing attack, and not according to the view of persons who are judging it ex post.|$|E

5|$|Temple 32 (Structure 5D-32) stands {{immediately}} {{to the east of}} Temple 33.

The temple shrine contained three large chambers, which were looted soon after the abandonment of the city in the 10th century. Archaeologists discovered a tomb cut into the bedrock under the pyramid, which contained a royal burial (Burial 195). The pyramid was built over the tomb soon after the king's burial and consisted of a single construction phase.|$|E
