5|$|The {{historical}} {{association is}} an <b>incorporated</b> <b>body</b> of volunteers {{who use the}} fort under licence from the Minister. The association operate the fort and visitor centre, holding monthly public open days at which {{the history of the}} fort is recreated; this includes drill demonstrations and firing of the fort's weapons. The association maintain static displays of the fort's active period and sell souvenirs. The association's goal is to have the site open as a fully operational fort for interpretation, tourism and education. The volunteers are involved with recreation, living history and ceremonial work outside the fort. They act as guards of honour at some Government House functions and attended the restoration opening of the Albany, Western Australia fort, and the annual re-enactment of the Battle of Waterloo in Keyneton, Victoria. The fort has living history displays, including the barracks laid out and furnished in period detail. The visitor centre has displays showing the development of South Australia's colonial defence from 1836 and artifacts found on site during restorations.|$|E
2500|$|The {{undergraduate}} members push {{to establish}} a national organization, to engage in activities that were national in scope, to change the sorority's name and symbols {{as well as to}} be more politically oriented caused conflict between one alumnae member who wished to keep the previous name and functional status quo, and the remaining collegiate Alpha Chapter members who voted to change the name of Alpha Kappa Alpha to Delta Sigma Theta Sorority. [...] When the graduate member, Nellie Quander, heard about the 22 students desire to change the sorority's name, colors and constitution, she disagreed and gave the students a deadline to stop the efforts to reorganize the sorority. [...] The 22 declined and unanimously voted to reorganize, even prior to Delta Sigma Theta being approved by the Howard University administration. Thus Delta Sigma Theta was founded on January 13, 1913, by the 22 students. The new sorority was officially incorporated in 1930 making Delta the first sorority composed of undergraduate African American women to apply to the trustees of any university for the right to become an <b>incorporated</b> <b>body.</b> On January 20, 1930, the organization's Grand Chapter was nationally incorporated. Delta Sigma Theta was one of the key African American organizations to participate in the Women's Suffrage March on March 3, 1913.|$|E
2500|$|The German Evangelical Society {{appealed the}} {{decision}} to the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia. [...] It gave three grounds for appeal: 1) That the court in equity had erred in finding the PHC properly incorporated under the 1860 charter; 2) that the court in equity had erred in denying a November 17, 1892, motion to amend the countersuit; and 3) that the court in equity had erred when it found that non-members of the Society were voting members of the PHC. The Court of Appeals, however, dismissed {{the first and third}} grounds. Under the rules of the court, the Society (as appellant) was required to have printed the testimony and proceedings of the initial court. The Society had declined to do so, and the court of appeals concluded that it could not find in favor of the appellant without any printed record. The key question in answering the remaining issue, the court of appeals said, was whether the 1886 entity calling itself the [...] "German Evangelical Society" [...] was, in fact, the same voluntary, unincorporated body which formed the PHC in 1860. The court said it was not and could never be, since {{as a matter of law}} it was a completely new entity. The charter of 1860, as amended, gave no voting rights to any outside organization, only to lotholders. Nor did the charter require lotholders to be members of the German Evangelical Society, whether the society of 1860 or the newly <b>incorporated</b> <b>body</b> of 1886. The court in equity, then, was right in denying the November 17, 1892, motion to amend, for this motion would have given the 1886 body voting rights and standing in the PHC annual meeting. The Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of the Court of the District of Columbia in Equity on February 5, 1894.|$|E

When a gift is to an unincorporated body, it must be treated, whatever the wording, {{as a gift to}} that body's purpose. This is because unincorporated bodies cannot possess things. If the body has ceased to exist but the purpose continues, the gift has not failed. <b>Incorporated</b> <b>bodies</b> on the other hand can possess property, and as such, as said by Buckley J in Re Vernon's Will Trust, [...] "A bequest to a corporate body ... takes effect simply as a gift to that body beneficially, unless there are circumstances which show that the recipient is to take the gift as a trustee." ...|$|R
