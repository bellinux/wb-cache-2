40|$|An optical {{procedure}} {{in the context}} of continuous variables to verify bipartite entanglement without destroying both systems and their entanglement is proposed. To perform the nondestructive verification of entanglement, the method relies on beam-splitter and quantum nondemolition (QND) interactions of the signal modes with two ancillary probe modes. The probe modes are measured by <b>homodyne</b> <b>detections,</b> and the obtained information is used to feed forward modulation of signal modes, concluding the procedure. Characterizing the method by figures of merit used in QND processes, we can establish the conditions for an effectively quantum scheme. Based on such conditions, it is shown that the classical information acquired from the <b>homodyne</b> <b>detections</b> of probe modes is sufficient to verify the entanglement of the output signal modes. The processing impact due to added noise on the output entanglement is assessed in the case of Gaussian modes. Comment: 7 pages, 2 figures. Close to published versio...|$|R

At the beginning of the chapter, receiver key components (filters, delay line interferometer, optical hybrids) are discussed.

50|$|Microwave {{detection}} {{is based}} on homodyne or heterodyne technologies. They can significantly increase the detection sensitivity by suppressing the noise and follow sub-nanosecond plasma generation and evolution. The <b>homodyne</b> <b>detection</b> method mixes the detected microwave electric field with its own source to produce a signal proportional to {{the product of the}} two. The signal frequency is converted down from tens of gigahertz to below one gigahertz so that the signal can be amplified and observed with standard electronics devices. Because of the high sensitivity associated with <b>homodyne</b> <b>detection</b> method, the lack of background noise in the microwave regime, and the capability of time gating of the detection electronics synchronous with the laser pulse, very high SNRs are possible even with milliwatt microwave sources. These high SNRs allow the temporal behavior of the microwave signal to be followed on a sub-nanosecond time scale. Thus the lifetime of electrons within the plasma can be recorded. By utilizing a microwave circulator, a single microwave horn transceiver has been built, which significantly simplify the experimental setup.|$|E
