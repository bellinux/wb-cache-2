5|$|Campbell's dwarf hamster {{is prone}} to genetic {{abnormalities}} in the metabolism of carbohydrates and lipids. They can develop tumours of the mammary glands, lungs, uterus, and ovaries. Tumours can also develop if the animal is exposed to chemical carcinogens. Due to having slow locomotion and an insignificant response to bright lights and humans, as well as having a low population density, <b>field</b> <b>studies</b> allow scientists to study entire populations in the wild.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to several}} taxonomic {{revisions}} by Russell Mittermeier, Colin Groves, and others, {{the number of}} recognized lemur species has grown from 33 species and subspecies in 1994 to approximately 100 in 2008. With continuing cytogenetic and molecular genetic research, as well as ongoing <b>field</b> <b>studies,</b> particularly with cryptic species such as mouse lemurs, the number of recognized lemur species is likely to keep growing. However, the rapid {{increase in the number}} of recognized species has had its critics among taxonomists and lemur researchers. Since classifications ultimately depend on the species concept used, conservationists often favor definitions that result in the splitting of genetically distinct populations into separate species to gain added environmental protection. Others favor a more thorough analysis.|$|E

5|$|During several {{independent}} <b>field</b> <b>studies</b> {{cracks and}} other ground deformations were observed {{on both the}} Egyptian and Saudi Arabian sides of the gulf. During a field survey that was done there in 1996, a series of cracks were discovered between 28°35' N and 29°05' N on the Saudi Arabian coast. A field investigation was also done in Egypt in 1996 by seismologist Yann Klinger and others along with the Egyptian Geological Survey and Mining Authority. The most dramatic ground ruptures found were north of Nuweiba along a coastal road.|$|E
5|$|Lemurs {{have been}} the focus of {{monographic}} series, action plans, field guides, and classic works in ethology. However, few species have been thoroughly studied to date, and most research has been preliminary and restricted to a single locality. Only recently have numerous scientific papers been published to explain the basic aspects of behavior and ecology of poorly known species. <b>Field</b> <b>studies</b> have given insights on population dynamics and evolutionary ecology of most genera and many species. Long-term research focused on identified individuals is in its infancy and has only been started for a few populations. However, learning opportunities are dwindling as habitat destruction and other factors threaten the existence of lemur populations across the island.|$|E
5|$|Little {{was known}} about their {{behaviour}} until the <b>field</b> <b>studies</b> of Birutė Galdikas, who became a leading authority on the apes. When she arrived in Borneo, Galdikas settled into a primitive bark and thatch hut, at a site she dubbed Camp Leakey, {{near the edge of}} the Java Sea. Despite numerous hardships, she remained there for over 30 years and became an outspoken advocate for orangutans and the preservation of their rainforest habitat, which is rapidly being devastated by loggers, palm oil plantations, gold miners, and unnatural forest fires.|$|E
5|$|Colletid bees of {{the genus}} Leioproctus visit Adenanthos cuneatus flowers. A 1978 <b>field</b> <b>study</b> {{conducted}} around Albany found the honey possum (Tarsipes rostratus) occasionally visited Adenanthos cuneatus, while the western spinebill much preferred the species to other flowers. A 1980 <b>field</b> <b>study</b> at Cheyne beach showed that the New Holland honeyeater and white-cheeked honeyeater pollinate it A 1985–86 <b>field</b> <b>study</b> in the Fitzgerald River National Park found that the nectar-feeding honey possum occasionally eats it. The silvereye (Zosterops lateralis) feeds on nectar from the flowers, and has also been observed taking dew-drops from leaves early in the morning.|$|R

5|$|Orangutans {{are among}} the most {{intelligent}} primates; they use a variety of sophisticated tools and construct elaborate sleeping nests each night from branches and foliage. The apes have been extensively studied for their learning abilities. There may even be distinctive cultures within populations. <b>Field</b> <b>studies</b> of the apes were pioneered by primatologist Birutė Galdikas. All three orangutan species are considered to be critically endangered. Human activities have caused severe declines in populations and ranges. Threats to wild orangutan populations include poaching, habitat destruction, and the illegal pet trade. Several conservation and rehabilitation organisations are dedicated to the survival of orangutans in the wild.|$|E
5|$|Past {{studies have}} {{reported}} other social organizations in ruffed lemurs including monogamous pair bonding. This {{may have been due}} to the use of short-term, seasonal <b>field</b> <b>studies</b> instead of yearlong studies that take into consideration the effects that changing seasons have on ruffed lemur communities. For instance, during the cold, rainy season, which corresponds with the breeding season, interactions between core groups within a community are significantly reduced. During this time small subgroups form consisting of a mature female, a mature male, and sometimes offspring. This can be misinterpreted as monogamous pair bonding.|$|E
5|$|The course {{focuses on}} the {{strategic}} and political aspects of war and educationally prepares students for assignments as strategic leaders. The academic year runs from late June through late May. The ASLSP curriculum provides a comprehensive, multifaceted focus at the theater-strategic level across the spectrum of Joint and land force operations during peace, crisis, and war. The program includes classroom studies of strategy, regional studies, joint operations, strategic leadership, and twentieth-century conflict. Students also research and write a publishable-quality monograph of 10,000- 12,000 words on a suitable subject. ASLSP includes an extensive <b>field</b> <b>studies</b> program, with approximately eight weeks of TDY, to reinforce and expand classroom studies and meet with senior leaders across JIIM organizations. <b>Field</b> <b>Studies</b> include interactions with several agencies in the National Capital Region, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and CONUS-based combatant commands, and visits to various military and civilian governmental agencies. Normally, six US Army officers and the USMC, Canadian, and German officers remain for a second year to serve as seminar leaders as seminar leaders in the AMSP course, while one US Army officer joins {{the faculty of the}} ASLSP as the military faculty member. Graduates typically serve in a follow-on command assignment or work for a three- or four-star general officer as a member of his or her staff.|$|E

5|$|The quarry {{is also a}} prime {{location}} for geological research and provides opportunities for <b>field</b> <b>studies</b> {{in a variety of}} disciplines: sedimentology, stratigraphy, palaeontology, geography, and industrial archaeology. Several features make this a unique {{location for}} the study of rock formations. Visitors can examine the extensively exposed rock faces, primarily Kentish Ragstone and Hassock facies, and study changes in vertical and lateral facies. The facies are glauconitic with some horizons of silicification. Shell debris (ammonites, belemnites, nautiloids, bivalves, etc.) and bioturbation are also present. The quarry could be important for future research via gamma ray profiling of the rock beds in relation to changes in sea level and climate.|$|E
5|$|The {{species has}} {{generally}} fared badly with human {{change to the}} landscape. Once common on the Cumberland Plain in Sydney's western suburbs, it has now almost disappeared from the Sydney Basin. It has also disappeared from the vicinity of Rockhampton in Queensland, and declined on Rottnest Island, and in the Wheatbelt region of Western Australia. <b>Field</b> <b>studies</b> in small patches of remnant vegetation indicate reduced survival rates there.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} social {{differences}} {{between males and}} females. Females typically have many affiliates and bond strongly with other females {{both within and outside}} their core areas, but do not affiliate with individuals outside the community range, except during mating season. Males, on the other hand, are more solitary, interact with only a couple of conspecifics, have weak social bonds with other males, and rarely associate with others outside their core group. Furthermore, <b>field</b> <b>studies</b> suggest that only females play a role in communal home range defense. Males may scent-mark and remain relatively silent, but otherwise show little involvement during disputes.|$|E

5|$|Animal testing, {{also known}} as animal experimentation, animal {{research}} and in vivo testing, {{is the use of}} non-human animals in experiments that seek to control the variables that affect the behavior or biological system under study. This approach can be contrasted with <b>field</b> <b>studies</b> in which animals are observed in their natural environments. Experimental research with animals is usually conducted in universities, medical schools, pharmaceutical companies, defense establishments and commercial facilities that provide animal-testing services to industry. The focus of animal testing varies on a continuum from pure research, focusing on developing fundamental knowledge of an organism, to applied research, which may focus on answering some question of great practical importance, such as finding a cure for a disease. Examples of applied research include testing disease treatments, breeding, defense research and toxicology, including cosmetics testing. In education, animal testing is sometimes a component of biology or psychology courses. The practice is regulated to varying degrees in different countries.|$|E
5|$|Ascocoryne sarcoides is {{a species}} of fungus in the family Helotiaceae. The species name {{is derived from the}} Greek sarkodes (fleshy). Formerly known as Coryne sarcoides, its taxonomical history has been {{complicated}} by the fact that it may adopt both sexual and asexual forms. Colloquially known as jelly drops or the purple jellydisc, this common fungus appears as a gelatinous mass of pinkish or purple-colored discs. Distributed widely in North America, Europe and Asia, A.sarcoides is a saprobic fungus and grows in clusters on the trunks and branches of a variety of dead woods. <b>Field</b> <b>studies</b> suggest that colonization by A.sarcoides of the heartwood of black spruce confers some resistance to further infection by rot-causing fungi. A.sarcoides contains the antibiotic compound ascocorynin, shown in the laboratory to inhibit the growth of several Gram-positive bacteria.|$|E
5|$|Fertilisation of Orchids {{is a book}} by English naturalist Charles Darwin {{published}} on 15 May 1862 under the full explanatory title On the various contrivances by which British and foreign orchids are fertilised by insects, and on the good effects of intercrossing. Darwin's previous book, On the Origin of Species, had briefly mentioned evolutionary interactions between insects and the plants they fertilised, and this new idea was explored in detail. <b>Field</b> <b>studies</b> and practical scientific investigations that were initially a recreation for Darwin—a relief from the drudgery of writing—developed into enjoyable and challenging experiments. Aided in his work by his family, friends, and a wide circle of correspondents across Britain and worldwide, Darwin tapped into the contemporary vogue for growing exotic orchids.|$|E
