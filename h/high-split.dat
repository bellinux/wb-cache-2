40|$|Abstract—This paper {{demonstrates}} {{the feasibility of}} an architecture that consolidates a number of deployed Passive Optical Network (PON) infrastructures into a long-reach, <b>high-split</b> ratio system which further increases equipment sharing between users. The demonstrated system allows the use of uncooled lasers with possible wavelength drift across a CWDM band (20 nm) with optical amplification and narrow optical filtering with no performance degradation. A complete study of potential implementations was performed with experimental results showing that a target performance of 10 − 10 could be achieved over 120 km of standard fiber with transmitter wavelengths fro...|$|E
40|$|This paper compares two {{burst-mode}} {{clock and}} data recovery (BM-CDR) techniques suitable for bursty upstream data transmission, namely a gated voltage controlled oscillator (GVCO) and an oversampling clock phase alignment (CPA). Numeric models were deduced with timing jitter and duty cycle distortion (DCD) {{present in the}} received data. The performance of the two techniques are analyzed and compared especially in an optically amplified long-reach <b>high-split</b> PON (LR-PON) system. It is shown that an oversampling CPA exhibits a large DCD tolerance and better jitter rejection than a GVCO without line coding, resulting in high network efficiency while keeping fast bit synchronisation. This makes the oversampling CPA technique the best option for the proposed network...|$|E
40|$|The {{continuous}} {{stream of}} new {{applications for the}} internet, increases the need for higher access speed in the currently deployed communication networks. Most networks in use today still consist of twisted copper wires, inherited from the telephone network. The disadvantages of reusing the existing telephone network are twofold. Firstly, the bandwidth of twisted copper wires is limited and secondly, {{a large number of}} switches and routers are needed throughout the network leading to an excessive power consumption. The hybrid fiber coax network that reuses the television distribution network is not free from these drawbacks. The bandwidth is also limited and power hungry amplifiers are needed to bridge the distance to and from the user. The future of broadband access lies in optical fiber networks. The optical fiber has a virtually unlimited bandwidth and the lower attenuation leads to less switches and amplifiers in the network, reducing the power consumption of the complete infrastructure. This dissertation describes the design of a 10 Gb/s burst-mode receiver for <b>high-split</b> extended reach passive optical networks (PONs). The designed receiver incorporates two very advanced features. Firstly, the burst-mode receiver locks its gain setting within 6 ns avoiding packet loss due to gain switching during data payload reception. Secondly, the burst-mode receiver detects both burst start and burst end, making it the first burst-mode receiver of its kind to operate without any time critical signal requirements from outside the burst-mode receiver. The presented work covers the chip-level architecture study and design of a 10 Gb/s burst-mode transimpedance amplifier and a 10 Gb/s post-amplifier, which are the two most critical components of a burst-mode receiver...|$|E
