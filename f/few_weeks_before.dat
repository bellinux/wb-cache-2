In August 2000, Camelot showed an early but playable version at the Nintendo Spaceworld Expo in Japan.

5|$|In Half-Life 2, {{the player}} {{takes on the}} role of Dr. Gordon Freeman.

Frohman is incredibly naïve and, unlike the other citizens, seems to enjoy living under the rule of the totalitarian administrator, Dr. Breen, and the Combine. He holds an insane reverence for the latter, even going to the point of having a plush doll of a Combine soldier.|$|E

He sent a letter discouraging the expedition stating that the political situation was too unstable for the expedition to be advisable. The letter reached Jacques Joseph Champollion a <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> the expedition was scheduled to leave, but he conveniently delayed in sending it on to his brother until after the expedition had left.|$|E

Immensely popular forward Craig Conroy, who retired only a <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> the game, also took part for Calgary.|$|E
5|$|Lincoln, however, did tacitly {{support the}} {{proposed}} Corwin Amendment to the Constitution, which passed Congress before Lincoln {{came into office}} and was then awaiting ratification by the states.

Despite very short notice about 100 people attended, including two RAF Police NCOs from RAF Benson.|$|E
5|$|Servicing Mission 3A, {{flown by}} Discovery, {{took place in}} December 1999, and was a {{split-off}} from Servicing Mission 3 after three of the six onboard gyroscopes had failed. The fourth failed a <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> the mission, rendering the telescope incapable of performing scientific observations. The mission replaced all six gyroscopes, replaced a Fine Guidance Sensor and the computer, installed a Voltage/temperature Improvement Kit (VIK) to prevent battery overcharging, and replaced thermal insulation blankets. The new computer is 20 times faster, with six times more memory, than the DF-224 it replaced. It increases throughput by moving some computing tasks from the ground to the spacecraft and saves money by allowing the use of modern programming languages.|$|E
