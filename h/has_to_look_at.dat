In a May 2012 interview with Inside Soap's Jason Herbison, Barber said he liked the fact that Rhys' mother had been introduced and that he had the chance to learn more about his character's background. He expressed his wish of having Rhys' father introduced in the future, saying [...] "Rhys doesn't have a good relationship with him, as his dad abandoned the family when he was younger. It would certainly create a lot of interesting dilemmas".|$|E
500|$|In {{his review}} of Minogue's 2004 {{greatest}} hits album Ultimate Kylie, Jason Shawahn from About.com praised the inclusion of songs like [...] "Spinning Around" [...] and other tracks from Light Years, calling them [...] "a blessing for domestic music consumers, since that disc has never found its way onto official US release, though with any collection of Minogue hits, one simply <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> {{what they have in}} their collection versus what they don't." [...] At the 14th ARIA Music Awards ceremony in 2000, [...] "Spinning Around" [...] won the award for [...] "Best Pop Release". Billboards Jason Lipshutz wrote the track found the singer [...] "returning to straightforward pop after 1997's ambitious Impossible Princess and corralling some disco thump to create an especially giddy effect"; calling it one of Minogue's [...] "most effortless hits to date". Louis Vartel from the LGBT oriented website NewNownext, called it her [...] "coolest, most liberated dance opus". He placed it at number seven of his list of the singer's 48 greatest songs, in honor of her 48th birthday.|$|E
500|$|Kohli {{and other}} senior players were rested for India's tour of Bangladesh {{ahead of the}} England tour. India conceded a 3–1 defeat in the five-match Test series against England despite leading it 1–0 after the first two Tests. Kohli fared poorly in the series {{averaging}} just 13.40 in 10 innings with a top score of 39. He was dismissed for single-digit scores on six occasions in the series and was particularly susceptible to the swinging ball on off stump line, being dismissed several times edging {{the ball to the}} wicket-keeper or slip fielders. Man of the series James Anderson got Kohli's wicket four times, while Kohli's batting technique was questioned by analysts and former cricketers. Geoffrey Boycott said, [...] "Jimmy Anderson ate him for breakfast. Every time Kohli came in, all he did was bowl at off stump, around the corridor of uncertainty and Kohli nicked it. He is playing with his bat too far away from his pad. He <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> video replays of his technique and get back to basics". India won the ODI series that followed 3–1, but Kohli's struggles with the bat continued with an average of 18 in four innings. In the one-off T20I, he scored 41-ball 66, his first fifty-plus score of the tour on the last match of the tour. India lost the match by three runs, but Kohli reached the number one spot for T20I batsmen in the ICC rankings.|$|E

[...] In their book The Charter Revolution & the Court Party, Alberta politician Ted Morton and Professor Rainer Knopff allege judges have a greater role and more choice in shaping policy, and quote former Chief Justice Antonio Lamer as stating that a Charter case, [...] "especially when one <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> Section 1... is asking us to make essentially {{what used to be a}} political call." ...|$|E

Bülent Uluer, the then Secretary General of the Revolutionary Youth Federation (...) said on 2 May 1977: [...] "Most victims were among us. About 15 of our friends died.

2500|$|Comments made {{by at the}} 2011 NFU conference by food critic Jay Rayner {{during a}} panel {{discussion}} entitled ‘Is modern agriculture palatable?’ pointed to the industry being at fault. Mr Rayner told farmers that perception that the public would disapprove of such a development had been given fuel {{by a lack of}} positive PR. [...] “The industry <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> how it communicates to the media, not just to the industry and government. Basically it needs to work out a way to kill those page three Daily Mail stories which misrepresent what agriculture is. [...] There is a failure of imagination. You need to employ some PR people to communicate the realities of agricultural production in the 21st century.” ...|$|E
