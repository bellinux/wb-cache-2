40|$|This work reviews {{membrane}} technologies- specifically Brackish Water Revere Osmosis (BWRO), Nanofiltration (NF) and <b>Electrodyalisis</b> Reversal (EDR), {{for drinking}} water production from brackish waters at lab, pilot and industrial scale. In the recent years, many fresh water {{resources such as}} surface and groundwater have become overused or misused. As a result, these resources are either diminishing or becoming low quality waters, which are supplied to population due to scarcity. These facts combined with the more demanding standards for drinking water quality cause an increasing complexity of water purification processes. Classic treatments (flocculation, oxidation, filtration, etc.) cannot reduce salinity and many so-called emerging contaminants simultaneously. Due to the variability {{in the composition of}} brackish waters and the different regulations, there are no standardized treatment processes. Therefore, reaching an environmental and economic optimal process to produce potable water is challenging...|$|E
40|$|A {{membrane}} is an interphase that {{restricts the}} passage of different components in a specific mode and {{over a wide range}} of particle sizes and molecular weights, from ions to macromolecules [1]. Synthetic membranes may be manufactured using organic or inorganic materials; they may be homogeneous or heterogeneous, symmetrical or asymmetrical, porous or dense, electrically neutral or charged; they may exhibit isotropic or anisotropic properties. The efficiency of a membrane basically is determined by two parameters: permeability (the rate at which a given component is transported through the membrane) and selectivity (the ability to separate in specific way a given component from others). The transport of different species through a membrane is a non-equilibrium process, and the separation of the different components is due to a differences in their transport rate. In a membrane separation process, the transport rate of a component can be activated by various driving forces such as gradients in concentration, pressure, temperature or electrical potential. In many membrane operations more than one driving force is involved (e. g. pressure and concentration in gas separation, concentration and electrical potential in <b>electrodyalisis,</b> etc.) ...|$|E
40|$|In this {{research}} Pd – ZrO 2 composite thin films were synthetized by Metalorganic Chemical Vapor Deposition (MOCVD) {{in order to}} obtain anticorrosive coatings for electrodes used in the technique of water treatment called <b>Electrodyalisis.</b> Coatings were deposited on AISI 304 L stainless steel substrates in ratios of 10 – 90, 20 – 80 and 30 – 70 wt % Pd and Zr precursors (acetylacetonates) respectively, and temperatures of 450, 500 and 550 °C. Gas flows were adjusted at 130 cm 3 min- 1 at ratio of 20 – 80 % vol of O 2 – Ar, and pressure was maintained at less than 1 Torr. Structural characterization was carried out through X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) showing the presence of metallic palladium and zirconia in cubic and tetragonal phases; palladium diffusion inside zirconia matrix was influenced by deposition temperatures and compositions. Topographic characterization was performed by Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), films showed a uniform and columnar growth; dome size and roughness were acquired with this technique too. Temperature effect on morphology and electrochemical behavior was clearly demonstrated by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Electrochemical techniques respectively: highly compact and crackless morphology was showed at lower temperatures and medium compositions, the highest charge-transfer resistance was also obtained at this temperature; whereas mores stresses appeared in the film and the charge-transfer resistance decreased significantly at higher temperatures...|$|E
