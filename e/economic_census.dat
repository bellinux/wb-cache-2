500|$|Proponents {{state the}} FairTax {{would reduce the}} number of tax filers by about 86% (from 100 million to 14 million) and reduce the filing {{complexity}} to a simplified state sales tax form.

Retailers would receive an administrative fee equal to the greater of $200 or 0.25% of the remitted tax as compensation for compliance costs.

It is argued here that in an increasingly information-oriented economy, producer services-whether performed within manufacturing fmns or by independent, specialized enterprises-play a pivotal role in expanding the division of labor, which in tum generates greater productivity and increasing incomes. The study utilizes data from the 1987 <b>economic</b> <b>censuses.</b> The results confirm and reinforce earlier evidence that the density of metropolitan producer services has a highly significant and positive association with per capita metropolitan income (as well as per capita metropolitan earnings), even when the relationship is controlled for level of education and for metropolitan population size, each of which also makes a positive and significant contribution.
