5|$|Duran quickly {{allied with}} the United Earth Directorate's expeditionary force, and used UED {{resources}} to mount an assassination attempt on Mengsk and provided vital intelligence and strategic advice on the Dominion to DuGalle. Duran convinced DuGalle to destroy the psi <b>disruptor,</b> to Stukov's chagrin, and as the UED closed in on Mengsk and his allies, Duran sabotaged a key operation, allowing the emperor to escape. When Stukov reconstructed the psi <b>disruptor,</b> Duran killed him and revealed his allegiance was actually to Sarah Kerrigan.|$|E
5|$|Alexei Stukov was {{the vice}} admiral and second-in-command of the United Earth Directorate's expeditionary force. He first appears in Brood War, voiced by Cástulo Guerra; he later reappears {{as one of}} Kerrigan's lieutenants in the Zerg Swarm in Heart of the Swarm and Legacy of the Void, voiced by Victor Brandt. A man of Russian descent, his {{military}} career primarily revolves around secret research, though he is also noted as an excellent tactician. A close friend of DuGalle, Stukov will debate situations with the admiral but will subordinate himself to his friend's higher rank. Stukov becomes suspicious of the motives of Samir Duran after the latter convinces DuGalle to destroy the psi <b>disruptor.</b> Believing the device to be the UED's best hope to conquer the Zerg, Stukov instead takes the psi <b>disruptor</b> to Braxis but is tracked down and shot dead by Duran. With his dying breaths, Stukov convinces DuGalle that Duran is a traitor {{and to keep the}} psi <b>disruptor</b> running for the UED's assault on the Zerg homeworld of Char. Stukov's body is given a full funeral and UED propaganda portrays Stukov as a hero, claiming he died in combat on Char.|$|E
5|$|At that time, the {{demography}} for the PlayStation shifted as more {{teenagers and}} children started {{to use the}} console to play video games. As a result, the team decided not to make another violent game like <b>Disruptor</b> and instead develop a family-friendly game that would be suitable for every member of a family, regardless of their age. The family game market was dominated by Sony's competitor Nintendo with games like Super Mario 64, while the PlayStation has no similar exclusives. Cerny later pushed Insomniac Games to develop a game with a mascot and mass appeal. An environment artist of <b>Disruptor,</b> Craig Stitt proposed that the game's theme and story should revolve around an anthropomorphic dragon. At the same time, Alex Hastings began developing an engine that specialized in games with panoramic view, which is suitable for open world games. The engine allowed more gameplay features including the ability for the dragon to glide through air. Spyro the Dragon was released in late 1998.|$|E

5|$|Cerny {{also gave}} input and {{feedback}} on the game's level-design. However, the 3DO did not perform as they had expected, and Universal suggested that the team should switched to Sony Computer Entertainment's PlayStation to increase sales of the game.

The debut title was called <b>Disruptor,</b> and was released worldwide in November 1996.|$|E
5|$|Gerard DuGalle is the {{commanding}} admiral of the United Earth Directorate's expeditionary {{force to the}} Koprulu Sector. DuGalle only appears in Brood War and is voiced by Jack Ritschel. Considered the UED's most capable military leader, DuGalle, a Frenchman, is a staunch believer in the UED's mission to pacify the sector and carries out his orders with precision. In Brood War, DuGalle leads the UED as it conquers the Terran Dominion; however, despite his experience, DuGalle believes misinformation planted by former Confederate soldier Samir Duran regarding a psi <b>disruptor,</b> a device that disrupts Zerg communications, on Tarsonis. When DuGalle's lifelong friend Alexei Stukov abandons the fleet, DuGalle allows Duran to assassinate Stukov as a traitor, only realizing his mistake too late. Nevertheless, DuGalle acts to prevent Duran destroying the psi <b>disruptor</b> and uses it to capture the Zerg Overmind on Char. However, {{as a result of}} demoralization, limited manpower and an alliance of enemies led by Kerrigan, the fleet is eventually pushed back and when a final attempt to recapture Char fails, DuGalle orders the retreat. Shortly before the UED fleet is overtaken by Zerg and destroyed, DuGalle composes a letter to his wife in which he admits responsibility for his closest friend's death and commits suicide by a gunshot to the head.|$|E

30|$|This paper {{presents}} a one-page visual tool for adaptively planning and managing potentially disruptive business models {{such as in}} RFID-Startups. The visual tool is called “The <b>Disruptor’s</b> Arrow of Time.” The modular and iterative approach of the <b>Disruptor’s</b> Arrow of Time overcomes a serious limitation of Waterfall Business Planning, which rigidly focuses on a single chain of activities from planning to execution. Unlike in Waterfall Business Planning, the <b>Disruptor’s</b> Arrow of Time uses a business model as unit of analysis, planning, design, and innovation. The <b>Disruptor’s</b> Arrow of Time uses a four-stage process for business model planning and management. To illustrate benefits of using the <b>Disruptor’s</b> Arrow of Time, the tool is used to present a case study on the systematic development and validation of a disruptive business model such as for Zipcar, which is an RFID-startup. Zipcar’s example highlights the flexibility and effectiveness of the <b>Disruptor’s</b> Arrow of Time in adaptively planning and managing disruptive business models particularly in the emerging epoch of the Internet of Things.|$|R

5|$|Aside {{from the}} usual {{tactical}} aspects of racing, Wipeout 2097 (unlike its predecessor) offered the chance to eliminate other drivers from the competition by destroying their craft with weapons. Each craft has a shield energy quota, and when this quota reaches zero—either from damage sustained from weapon attacks, or impact from other craft or {{the edges of the}} circuit—the craft blows up. The craft also blows up if the time limit is reached, though this only applies to human players. The biggest weapon introduced in 2097 was the Quake <b>Disruptor,</b> which has been a series hallmark ever since. This weapon causes a quake to thrust a destructive wave down the track that dunks the crafts it smash into.|$|E

40|$|Endocrine <b>disruptors</b> are {{chemicals}} {{affecting the}} body, disrupting {{the functioning of}} the endocrine system and thus altering the balance of physiological functions in the entire organism. There are countless endocrine <b>disruptors</b> in the ecosystem, in addition to accumulated substances in the environment, these elements are found in a wide range of products that we encounter on a daily basis. Most often, these materials include various plastics, such as packaging of beverages and foods. According to the presence of these chemicals, endocrine <b>disruptors</b> can be divided into synthetic and natural. Endocrine <b>disruptors</b> are characterised by a long half-live and significant bioaccumulation. These harmful substances enter the organism in various ways, for example through skin and food. Exposure of the organism to endocrine disrupters has a negative effect on its health. In a large quantity, they also affect the reproductive functions. In addition to the effect on reproduction, a negative impact was demonstrated also on other systems, such as nervous. Some endocrine <b>disruptors</b> have a confirmed carcinogenic effect. Endocrine <b>disruptors</b> work primarily through the oestrogen, androgen, progestin or aryl hydrocarbon receptors. Their combinations and metabolites are often more dangerous than the actual substances. The research of the impact of endocrine <b>disruptors</b> on the reproduction of animals proved their negative effect on gonads, production of gametes (spermatocyte and oocyte), fertilisation, implantation, embryonic development, completion of gravidity and birth weight; therefore the changes may occur in the entire reproductive system. Despite numerous studies examining the effect of endocrine <b>disruptors</b> on animal health, there are certain unexplained inconsistencies, which is why it is necessary to continue in the research intensively in the future...|$|R

Methods Bisphenol A (BPA) and Aroclor 1254 (polychlorinated biphenyls) were used as endocrine <b>disruptors</b> in this study. Mouse 2 -cell embryos were cultured in medium alone or vehicle or co-cultured with human endometrial epithelial layers in increasing ED concentrations. Results At 72 hours the percentage of normal blastocyst were decreased by ED in a dose-dependent manner while the co-culture system significantly enhanced the rate and reduced the toxicity of endocrine <b>disruptors</b> on the embryonic development in vitro. Conclusions In conclusion, although EDs have the toxic effect on embryo development, the co-culture with human endometrial cell reduced the preimplantation embryo from it thereby making human reproductive environment protective to preimplantation embryo from the toxicity of endocrine <b>disruptors.</b> </p...|$|R

The activated carbons exhibited high removal ability of 1, 2 -dibromo- 3 -chloropropane (DBCP), 100 fold increased adsorption over that with PDMS membranes from aqueous solution of DBCP. The removal ratio of the endocrine <b>disruptors,</b> e. g., 1, 2 -dibromo- 3 -chloropropane, dibenzo-p-dioxin, and hexachlorocyclohexane, increased linearly in an aqueous solution with increasing the logarithm of Pow of the endocrine <b>disruptors.</b> Almost complete removal of the endocrine <b>disruptors</b> (i. e., 85) was observed above log Pow 3. 5 in 25 mL of an aqueous solution using 0. 05 g activated carbon. One aim {{of the present study}} is to use preferential sorption of chemical contaminants onto activated carbons for removal of the chemical contaminants from aqueous solutions including drinking water, beverages, milk, and human milk. When the removal of endocrine <b>disruptors</b> contained in milk or human milk is targeted, water soluble vitamins in the milk, such as vitamin B 2, vitamin B 12, and niacin are expected to be co-currently adsorbed on the activated carbons.

40|$|In tro duc ti on Endocrine <b>disruptors</b> (xenohormones) are {{exogenous}} substances or {{compounds that}} cause {{adverse health effects}} in the organism by disrupting the endocrine functions (1, 2, 3). Endocrine disruptions mostly occur {{on the basis of}} genetic predisposition. Natural or synthetic chemical endocrine disrupting substances that we are surrounded with and are exposed to in the modern world lead to clinical disorders by intervening with hormonal physiology (4). At first, endocrine <b>disruptors</b> were thought to act only via nuclear hormone receptors such as estrogen, androgen, progesterone, thyroid and retinoid receptors. However, recent {{studies have shown that the}} mechanism of action of endocrine <b>disruptors</b> is not that simple. Endocrine <b>disruptors</b> are thought to exert effects on endocrine and reproductive systems through nuclear receptors, non-nuclear steroid hormone receptors (membrane estrogen receptors), non-steroid receptors (neurotransmitter receptors such as serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine receptors), orphan receptors (aryl hydrocarbon receptor), enzymatic pathways involving steroid biosynthesis and/or metabolism, and numerous other mechanisms (3). Endocrine <b>disruptors</b> are also known as endocrine modulators, hormone active agents, endocrine active agents, endocrine toxins or xenohormones (5, 6). Molecules defined as endocrine <b>disruptors</b> constitute an extremely heterogeneous group and include synthetic chemicals used as industrial solvents/lubricants and their by-products (polychlorinated biphenyls, polybrominated biphenyls, dioxins), plastics (bisphenol A), plasticisers (phthalates), pesticides [methoxychlor, chlorphyrifos...|$|R
