50|$|The <b>desert</b> <b>wheatear</b> (Oenanthe deserti) is a wheatear, a small {{passerine}} {{bird that}} was formerly classed {{as a member}} of the thrush family Turdidae, but is now more generally considered to be an Old World flycatcher (Muscicapidae). It is a migratory insectivorous species, 14.5 to 15 cm in length. Both western and eastern forms of the <b>desert</b> <b>wheatear</b> are rare vagrants to western Europe. The western <b>desert</b> <b>wheatear</b> breeds in the Sahara and the northern Arabian peninsula. The eastern race is found in the semi-deserts of central Asia and in winter in Pakistan and northeast Africa.|$|E
50|$|The red-rumped {{wheatear}} avoids real desrets and {{is normally}} found in flat areas, especially near saline or barren areas. In Morocco uses more vegetated areas than the <b>desert</b> <b>wheatear</b> and {{also found in}} rocky hills.|$|E
50|$|The <b>desert</b> <b>wheatear</b> feeds {{largely on}} insects which it picks {{up off the}} ground. It breeds in the spring when a clutch of usually four pale blue, {{slightly}} speckled eggs is laid in a well-concealed nest made of grasses, mosses and stems.|$|E
5|$|Other British Birds rarities {{that have}} been sighted (single records unless {{otherwise}} indicated) are: Little bittern, glossy ibis, gyrfalcon (3 records), little and Baillon's crakes, collared pratincole, semipalmated (5 records), least (2 records), white-rumped and Baird's (2 records) sandpipers, Wilson's phalarope, laughing gull, bridled tern, Pallas's sandgrouse, great spotted, black-billed and yellow-billed (3 records) cuckoos, European roller, olive-backed pipit, citrine wagtail, Alpine accentor, thrush nightingale, red-flanked bluetail, black-eared (2 records) and <b>desert</b> <b>wheatears,</b> White's, Swainson's (3 records), and grey-cheeked (2 records) thrushes, Sardinian (2 records), Arctic (3 records), Radde's and western Bonelli's warblers, Isabelline and lesser grey shrikes, red-eyed vireo (7 records), two-barred crossbill, yellow-rumped and blackpoll warblers, yellow-breasted (2 records) and black-headed (3 records) buntings, rose-breasted grosbeak (2 records), bobolink and Baltimore oriole (2 records).|$|R
5|$|As of 2007, the {{following}} reviews are underway: {{a review of}} past records of Macaronesian shearwaters, reviews of all redhead and royal tern records, a review of great white egrets to establish if any are of the Nearctic race, a review of sandplovers, a review of records of the eastern race of redstart, a review of Orphean warbler records aimed at determining the race of each, and a review of subalpine warblers to determine which individuals are ascribable to the race albistriata. It has also been suggested that reviews should be conducted of records of great snipe, as older records show a very different temporal occurrence pattern than more recent birds, {{the large numbers of}} gull-billed tern records from the English south coast from the 1960s, and <b>desert</b> <b>wheatears,</b> to establish racial identifications.|$|R
50|$|Over {{five hundred}} species of bird have been {{recorded}} from Oman. Some of these are resident, others arrive in spring to breed, departing by autumn. Still more are in transit, on migration routes between the Palearctic ecozone, Africa and the Indian Subcontinent. The east coast with its mudflats and lagoons is visited by many species of wader, and the mangrove areas are home to the red-wattled lapwing and the collared kingfisher. The coast and offshore islands are home to gulls, terns and cormorants. The mountainous north of the country attracts many passerines in passage, the desert areas are home to the endangered houbara bustard, sand partridge, four species of sandgrouse, <b>desert</b> larks, pipits, <b>wheatears</b> and buntings. The mountains additionally attract golden eagles and Egyptian vultures. The Dhofar region in the south has {{a great variety of}} breeding and migratory species. The Omani owl (Strix butleri) is a species of owl discovered in 2013, and {{is believed to be the}} only bird endemic to Oman.|$|R
50|$|The <b>desert</b> <b>wheatear</b> has a {{very large}} range {{breeding}} range, estimated as nearly 10 million square kilometers (3.9 million square miles), and the population appears to be stable. For this reason, the bird is listed as being of least concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.|$|E
50|$|The <b>desert</b> <b>wheatear</b> is an {{occasional}} vagrant to the British Isles {{and a female}} got blown off course in October 2012 during its autumn migration and was seen in a sandpit in Essex. Only a few weeks later, another {{was seen in the}} RSPB Loch of Strathbeg reserve in Scotland.|$|E
50|$|The {{habitat of}} the <b>desert</b> <b>wheatear</b> is barren open countryside, steppes, deserts, {{semi-arid}} plains, saltpans, dried up river beds and sandy, stony and rocky wasteland. It is found at altitudes {{of up to}} 3500 m. During the winter it may also visit cultivated land when this is interspersed with bare areas of countryside.|$|E
50|$|Halvad {{is close}} to the Indian Wild Ass Sanctuary at the Little Rann of Kutch. The Asiatic wild ass {{is a member of the}} horse family with {{striking}} white underparts and a deep mane. It is a strong and powerful runner. Other animals spotted here are nilgai and chinkara and the birds seen are the Indian sandgrouse, houbara bustard, lark, desert warbler, <b>desert</b> <b>wheatear,</b> Indian courser and vultures.|$|E
50|$|The <b>desert</b> <b>wheatear</b> {{tends to}} perch on a bush, tussock or grass or other {{eminence}} and dart {{to the ground}} beneath to pounce on insects and other small invertebrates, though it can also catch insects in the air. The diet usually consists of ants, beetles, caterpillars and flies and the larvae of various insects including ant-lions. In addition to these, seeds have also been found in its stomach. It is able to hover for short periods and when it finds a large prey insect, with which it is unable to cope, it sometimes displays {{in front of it}} by fluttering its wings.|$|E
50|$|The eastern {{race of the}} <b>desert</b> <b>wheatear</b> breeds in a great swathe of Asia {{extending}} from the Middle East and Saudi Arabia through Iran, Baluchistan, Afghanistan, the south Caucasus, Turkestan, the Tarbagatai Mountains, the Altai Mountains and north western Mongolia. Birds from this region migrate southwards to overwinter in northeastern Africa, the Arabian peninsula, Iraq and Pakistan. The western race breeds in North Africa from Morocco and Rio de Oro to the part of Egypt west of the River Nile. This population is largely resident but in Morocco, birds {{in the south and}} east part migrate while those in the south west tend not to.|$|E
50|$|The <b>desert</b> <b>wheatear</b> breeds during late April or May {{over most}} of its range. It nests on rocky hillsides, on steppes, on sandy plains, in crevices in walls or in hollows under rocks. The nest is often {{concealed}} behind gorse (Ulex europaeus) bushes or other bushy vegetation and is a tidily-built cup made of grasses, mosses and stems, lined with fine roots and hairs, and sometimes small feathers. A clutch of four (occasionally five) eggs are laid. These are pale bluish with fine rusty speckles, usually forming a distinct zone at the wider end. They measure approximately 20.1 x 15 mm. Incubation is done mainly by the female and both sexes help care for the young.|$|E
50|$|The {{head and}} nape {{of the adult}} male <b>desert</b> <b>wheatear</b> are a pale sandy-grey colour with the {{feathers}} tipped grey. The mantle, scapulars and back are a similar but rather richer colour. The rump and upper tail-coverts are pale buff. The basal third of the tail feathers are white and the rest black with a pale buff tip. A curved stripe over the eye is pale buff and extends backwards. The feathers of the chin, throat, lores and ear-coverts are black tipped with white. The breast and flanks are sandy-buff and the belly and under tail-coverts are creamy-white tinged with buff. The axillaries and under wing-coverts are black tipped with white. The primaries have black outer webs, tipped and edged with white and inner webs pale brown edged with white. The secondaries are similar but have broader white edges to both webs. Its length is about 15 cm and it weighs between 15 and 34 g.|$|E
40|$|The {{quality and}} size of {{nestling}} food of the <b>Desert</b> <b>Wheatear</b> Oenanthe deserti ssp. atrogularis were investigated {{in the spring of}} 2001 in the Dzungarian Gobi in Mongolia. Data are based on observations of nine pairs. Nestling food consisted of several taxa caught on the ground and in the air. Diptera, Coleoptera larvae, and Hymenoptera were the most frequent prey, that is, they contributed 17 to 30 % of all food items each. The food composition changed with nestling age and season. Food item size decreased with date. A higher proportion of multiple prey loadings were brought to nestlings {{in the second half of}} the season than in the first half. Prey items were significantly smaller in multiple prey loadings than in single prey loadings, but as a whole, multiple prey loadings were larger than single prey loadings. Despite the increase of the proportion of multiple prey loadings in the second half of the season compared with the first half, the loading size decreased with time. Presumably, large, profitable prey became rarer with the ongoing season. This may have caused the parents’ feeding effort to increase and prevented them from starting regular second broods...|$|E
40|$|Medak district, Andhra Pradesh, India. The said {{bird was}} sighted {{perching}} on Phoenix acaulis and had distinctive sandy-brown plumage with pale white supercilium, white rump and black tail with white tips and edges. The bird {{landed on a}} nearby pathway, where it was observed {{for a total of}} c. 15 minutes before it returned to the perch. The bird flew from its perch to an open ground and then returned to the perch. We had an opportunity to observe the bird for about 15 minutes. The bird perched in an upright stance and had long legs. The bird was identified as <b>Desert</b> <b>Wheatear</b> Oenanthe deserti following Kazmierczak, (2000) and Grimmett et al. (1998). The identification was also independently confirmed from the photograph by more experienced members of the Birdwatchers ’ Society of Andhra Pradesh. The senior author (CS) has observed this species and Isabelline Wheatear Oenanthe isabellina in Haryana, Rajasthan and Delhi environs between 2005 and 2007. The bird is presumed to be a non-breeding adult female as its throat is white with pale whitish fringes and has broad whitish to buffish fringes and blackish centre on wing coverts. The present report constitutes recent sighting of this species in Andhra Pradesh. This bird had been purportedly “observed along the route from Nirmal to Utnoor (via Talamdiri village) between 12 and 15 [1925]”, Adilabad district by the late Dr. Salim Ali (Al...|$|E
40|$|This {{report by}} the Slovenian Rarities Committee {{presents}} records of rare bird species in Slovenia in 2015, with some addenda for previous years. The numbers in brackets refer {{to the number of}} records (first number) and individuals (second number) recorded between 1 Jan 1950 and 31 Dec 2014. Since 1 Jan 2013, submission to the Committee has been required for 37 additional species, 17 of which are regional rarities. Records of these species are not numbered, since records from previous years were not collected by the Committee. One new species, the <b>Desert</b> <b>Wheatear</b> Oenanthe deserti, was added to category A. Other notable observations were the first record of Parrot Crossbill Loxia pytyopsittacus after 1909, the second record of Baillon’s Crake Zapornia pusilla, the third and fourth records of Calandra Lark Melanocorypha calandra, the fourth of Long-legged Buzzard Buteo rufinus, the fifth of Richard’s Pipit Anthus richardi and the sixth of Grey Phalarope Phalaropus fulicarius. Four species were added to category E: Bahama Pintail Anas bahamensis, Rosy-billed Pochard Netta peposaca, Harris’s Hawk Parabuteo unicinctus and Alexandrine Parakeet Psittacula eupatria. The list of birds recorded in Slovenia (as of 31 Dec 2015) contains 386 species (371 in category A, 6 in category B, 9 exclusively in category C; 4 species are both in categories A and C). Category D contains 6 species, while category E contains 38, two of which are classified into subcategory E*. These two categories {{are not part of the}} list...|$|E
40|$|This ornithological report {{covering}} the years 1982 and 1983 follows on {{from a series}} begun in 1950. lt deals mainly {{with the results of}} the long-term monitoring of several bird communities in the Camargue and lists a few species which are accidentai in the area. The baseline for inclusion of unusual observations is provided by the Guide des Oiseaux de Camargue (Blondel et Isenmann, 1981) which gives the status and phenology of the 337 species recorded in the Camargue, the Crau and the Alpilles. Now that a rare birds committee has been established in France only those observations accepted by this committee will in future be published here. The present report, however, was written before the committee had given a verdict on sorne of the observations submitted. The meteorological report shows that 1982 was a dry year with a mild winter and a hot summer. The autumn was mild and characterised by a freak storm from the S. E. on the 7 - 8 November 1983 was also a dry year; the spring was dominated by frequent and strong S. E. winds and the summer was hot. Cormorants have been censused for the 3 rd and 4 th consecutive winters and their numbers have peaked at between 4 000 and 6 000 (Fig. 1). The recent increase in numbers can perhaps be related to the increase of the breeding populations of Denmark and Rolland, since ringed birds from Rolland have been sighted in the Camargue. Reed-nesting herons are censuse d annually by aerial photography over the major part of the south coast of Franoe. The Grey heron continues to increase in number and to extend its range (Table l). Purple heron numbers have increased since 1981, but unlike the Grey, the major colonies of this species are not situated within the Camargue proper but to the East and West of the two main arms of the river. Tree-nesting herons have also been censused annually since 1968. Their numbers are given in Table II, from which {{it can be seen that}} the Cattle egret population has practically stopped increasing and now fluctuates at around 400 pairs. Both Little and Cattle egrets have also been censused at the winter roosts (Table III). Breeding Bitterns we re also censused and 5 4 « boom ing) males were located in the greater Camargue area in 1983; the number found in the Camargue proper (24) being the same as in 1982. Both years produced record numbers of flamingos breeding in the delta : 10500 pairs raised 6825 chicks in 1982 and 14400 pairs raised 7200 chicks in 1983, the latter being the only colony established throughout the western Mediterranean. The ringing programme started in 1977 was continued and 652 and 720 chicks respectively were marked the two years. These birds are individually recogniseable in the field and there have now been over 19000 contacts from a total of 4688 colour-ringed flamingos (56 % of the sample). Sightings are from the Western Mediterranean in particular, but with a few birds in Senegal, Mauritania and Libya. Following the strong S. E. winds of early November 1982, small groups of flamingos were sighted well inland in France. One ringed bird is known to have returned to the Camargue after being seen on the River Isère (Drôme), 185 km up the Rhône valley. In spite of the large numbers of flamingos in the Camargue these two springs the problem of these birds feeding in the rice-paddies has not worsened. On the contrary, the scaring campaings have paid off and no subsequent damage was reported by the farmers (even though the area under rice cultivation has increased). The wintering Bewick's Swan population peaked at 55 - 60 in 1981 - 82 and 68 in 1982 - 83, rather lower than the peaks of 85 and 82 individuals recorded in the past. Over the past six years the number of Shelducks recorded along the south coast of France prior to breeding has been around 1400 individuals. About 500 pairs breed in the area, mainly in the salines of the Camargue and Petite Camargue. The colour-ringing programme was continued and a further 69 birds were marked, bringing the total of individually recogniseable Shelducks ringed since 1978 to 316. Sightings of these birds on the « Grosser Knechtsand » have shown that birds from the south of France join the vast majority of birds from North Western Europe for the annual moult in the German Waddenzee (see Table IV). Following the cold spell in N. Europe in winter 1981 - 82, a record number of 2060 Shelducks were counted in S. France, most of these (1876) being in the Camargue and Petite Camargue. Results of the monthly winter censuses of other Anatidae species, carried out by the C. N. R. S. since 1964 - 65, are summarised in Table V and VI, prepared and commented upon by A. Tamisier. During the winter of 1982 - 83 total duck numbers peaked at only 100000. This is lower than usual and may be attributed to two factors mainly : the S. E. storm of early November and the gradual loss of good habitat (disturbance by hunting and fishing has increased). In order to emphasize the importance of disturbance-free areas the numbers of ducks recorded on the St Seren marsh located in the centre of the Tour du Valat Reserve are given in Table VII. Regarding the larger raptors there has been no change in the status of the Egyptian vulture and Eagle owl in the Alpilles, but the two pairs of Bonelli's eagles have had very poor breeding seasons with only 2 young raised in two years. In the Camargue there has been no detectable change in the Marsh harrier population, an estimated 84 occupied nest sites being located in 1982. In the Crau the winte ring population of Little bustards has remained relatively stable over the past ten years at around 1000 individuals (max. 1283 in Dec. 1982. Amongst the waders on passage unusually high numbers of Marsh sandpipers, up to 15 - 16 together, have been recorde deach autumn. a Terek sandpiper was shot locally in Sept. 1983 and there are two further May records of Wilson's phalarope, a species now observed almost annually. The 1982 census of breeding laro-limicolae revealed 26 pairs of Slenderbilled gulls but these failed to raise any chicks. In 1983, however, a similar number of pairs raised 60 young, by far the most successful season on record for this species. Mediterranean gulls also had two good seasons with a record 13 pairs in 1982 and 14 young raised in 1983 by 5 - 6 pairs (incomplete census). Whiskered terns, on the other hand, did not breed in 1982 and failed in their attempt in 1983 (200 + pairs). Amongst the passerines a <b>Desert</b> <b>wheatear</b> was recorded in the Crau in February 1983. This bird, the second recorded from the Crau in 3 years, has been accepted by the rareties committee. Finally, an event which has either been overlooked in the past or is a new development, is the importance of a Carrion crow roost near Le Sambuc where 950 were recorded in December 198...|$|E
