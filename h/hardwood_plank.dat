50|$|Although not {{the first}} to {{broadcast}} VFL football (Melbourne's 3AR was broadcasting ex-Carlton player Rod McGregor's descriptions of play at least as early as 1927), Banks was certainly a pioneer of football radio broadcasts, often overcoming extraordinary working conditions. At Princes Park, Carlton in 1931 he broadcast his first football match standing on a ladder {{at the end of the}} dressing room. On another occasion at Princes Park he had the luxury of broadcasting from a <b>hardwood</b> <b>plank</b> protruding from a ladies toilet, with no protection from the weather. At Lakeside Oval he broadcast from an 18-metre steel tower.|$|E

50|$|The show {{involves}} a temporary cylindrical structure about 25 {{feet high and}} 30 feet in diameter, or wider when cars are to be involved, built of <b>hardwood</b> <b>planks.</b> The audience stands upon the platform built around the circumference of the structure and gaze down into the well where the motorcyclists or cars drive.|$|R
5000|$|The 18th century Hawaiian 'wave sliders' seen, by Captain Cook's crew, {{performing}} [...] "dangerous maneuvers" [...] {{with great}} [...] "boldness and address", would have ridden 15 foot (4.5 metre) <b>hardwood</b> <b>planks</b> with no directional fin or skeg to aid steering, therefore {{one of the}} few expressions available to them may have been the casual stance which would have been a forerunner to the modern Soul Arch.|$|R
25|$|Typically {{constructed}} of <b>hardwood</b> <b>planking</b> and selectively clad with armour plate, this shallow-draft, barge-like boat {{with a crew}} of four could ferry an infantry platoon of 31, with space to spare for five additional specialist troops, to shore at 7 knots (13km/h). Men generally entered the boat by walking over a gangplank from the boat deck of a troop transport as the LCA hung from its davits. When loaded, the LCA was lowered into the water. Soldiers exited by the boat's bow ramp.|$|R
50|$|Internally, the {{underground}} hospital was timbered like a mine, although two different techniques were used. The north tunnel was heavily timbered with three piece sets of sawn Oregon posts and top lagged with hardwood planks {{resting on the}} caps. Five sets were intact in October 1997. The rest of the hospital was lightly timbered with round logs of native hardwood about 1.5 cm in diameter. Throughout most of the hospital only occasional posts were standing in 1997 {{and most of these}} were dislodged and leaning. A few intact set survived in the north east corner, showing the construction was generally similar to the sawn timber Oregon sets; having round caps and <b>hardwood</b> <b>plank</b> lagging resting on them. The sets were spaced by sprags resting on cleats nailed to the tops of the posts.|$|E
5000|$|Instead {{of boiling}} the {{hardwood}} logs, {{in this process}} they are kept at a low humidity level and dried slowly to draw moisture {{from the inside of}} the wood cells. The logs are then sawed {{in the same manner as}} for solid <b>hardwood</b> <b>planks.</b> This style of engineered hardwood has the same look as solid hardwood, and does not have any of the potential problems of [...] "face checking" [...] that rotary-peel and slice-peel products have, because the product is not exposed to added moisture.|$|R
50|$|The {{finished}} underground {{hospital was}} about 100m {{from the rear}} of the nearest hospital building, with access along a gravelled pathway. The three entrances were secured by locked timber gates. Inside the hospital was framed either with sets of round native timber or sawn Oregon timber, the ceiling was sawn <b>hardwood</b> <b>planks</b> and some of the walls were lined with gidyea logs. The floor was bare earth. The hospital was equipped with electric lights and a telephone. Furthermore, buckets of water and sand, stirrup pumps and shovels were present in case of an air raid.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{traditional}} Filipino bahay na bato with long slanting roofs covered in nipa leaves. The {{house has a}} coral stone foundation, rough-hewn wooden posts, wooden walls and floors of wide <b>hardwood</b> <b>planks</b> and a receiving hall with a high vaulted ceiling. It {{is made up of}} two floors: the living quarters being on the upper floor. The upper floor has large and wide windows made up of capiz shells which let the sunshine in if closed. [...] There are about half a dozen four-poster antique wooden beds reflecting the austere Boholano aesthetic.|$|R
2500|$|The life preservers, [...] <b>hardwood</b> <b>planks,</b> [...] {{long and}} [...] wide, were never used. [...] Two boats {{with a total}} of 18 persons reached shore. [...] In addition, {{fourteen}} people were saved on a large raft and many others on parts of the wreckage. Over 300 lives were lost and 98 saved. The drummer of the German band, Charles Beverung, saved himself by using his large bass drum as a life preserver. Survivors reported the heroic efforts of Captain Wilson to save about 300 persons collected on a raft. [...] When day broke, between 350 and 400 passengers and crew were drifting in stormy waters, holding on to anything they could, many only to be pulled under by breakers near shore.|$|R
50|$|The {{traditional}} {{event was}} originally {{a tribute to}} the start of the fishing season. The planking dates to the 1930s near Smithfield, Virginia, beginning as a small gathering of friends to celebrate the James River running of shad—the oily, bony fish smoked for the occasion on wood planks over an open flame. The unique shad cooking technique that is enjoyed today traces its roots to Mr. Paul Cox, of Surry County, Virginia. Mr. Cox, along with several Ruritans including Dr. E.C. Nettles and Mr. Richard Savedge, invited twenty-five of their friends to historic Wrenn's Mill in Isle of Wight County, Virginia for their first Shad Planking. Having attended similar functions in the deep South, Mr. Cox introduced the group to the intriguing process of cooking 15 shad they had caught earlier in the day from the James River on <b>hardwood</b> <b>planks</b> over an open fire.|$|R
40|$|Composites {{reinforced}} by lignocellulosic fibers and structural cellulosic materials, such as bamboo, are being increasingly {{used in many}} industrial fields, owing to the growing society need to use materials from renewable natural resources. This work aims to analyze a waste of the agribusiness sustainable production of heart of palm, namely {{the trunk of the}} pupunha (Bactris gasipaes) palm. The main objective was to characterize the mechanical behavior of the “timber like” material obtained after the pupunha palm is cut. This material has an appearance similar to some <b>hardwood</b> <b>planks,</b> and can be an alternative route for obtaining wood-like materials, considering the following: availability, preservation of the environment, performance of the material and relative low cost. In this work, the flexural and compression strengths, and the abrasion resistance of pupunha specimens are reported. The results obtained are compared with the mechanical performance of bamboo and several woods (both hardwood and softwood) commonly used at furniture manufacture. Key words: mechanical properties, physical properties, pupunh...|$|R

50|$|The car, cheap {{gasoline}} and postwar affluence created boom {{conditions for the}} expansion of suburbia. Several standard designs for the single family home on a standard lot were reproduced cookie-cutter style row-upon-row in cities across Canada as subdivision after subdivision sprang up radiating from the central core. The designs were thoroughly modern, reflecting the optimism of the era, usually with a peaked roof, asphalt shingles and a brick or wood siding exterior and included a living room, kitchen and occasionally dining room and two, three or four bedrooms and a full basement made of poured concrete or cinder block. Floors were usually made of varnished <b>hardwood</b> <b>planks</b> and the walls and ceilings of gyprock. Copper piping brought running water from the serviced street and copper wiring electricity from the rear lot line. Clay tile pipe carried the sewage from the flush, sit toilet to the main sewer line running under the street. There was usually a driveway beside the house for the family car, and less frequently a carport or garage.|$|R
50|$|Windeward Bound is a two masted brigantine-rigged vessel {{based in}} Hobart, Tasmania, Australia. The vessel {{is named after}} Lewis Winde, the builder of an 1848 Boston {{schooner}} on which Windeward Bound was modelled. It is constructed almost entirely of Tasmanian eucalypt, huon pine and Oregon pine, recycled from old boats and buildings. The hull is constructed of 5 cm <b>hardwood</b> strip <b>planks,</b> over epoxy-laminated douglas fir frames, spaced 38 cm (15 inches) apart. The stem, sternpost and keel are of epoxy-laminated Tasmanian blue gum and the decks are of huon and New Zealand kauri pines.|$|R
5000|$|Variance on riser {{height and}} tread depth between {{steps on the}} same flight should be very low. Building codes require variances no larger than 0.1875 in between depth of {{adjacent}} treads or the height of adjacent risers; within a flight, the tolerance between the largest and smallest riser or between the largest and smallest tread can not exceed 0.375 in. The reason is that on a continuous flight of stairs, people get used to a regular step and may trip {{if there is a}} step that is different, especially at night. The general rule is that all steps on the same flight must be identical. Hence, stairs are typically custom made to fit the particular floor to floor height and horizontal space available. Special care must be taken on the first and last risers. Stairs must be supported directly by the subfloor. If thick flooring (e.g. thick <b>hardwood</b> <b>planks)</b> are added on top of the subfloor, it will cover part of the first riser, reducing the effective height of the first step. Likewise at the top step, if the top riser simply reaches the subfloor and thick flooring is added, the last rise at the top may be higher than the last riser. The first and last riser heights of the rough stairs are modified to adjust for the addition of the finished floor.|$|R
5000|$|Wood or timber [...] "decking" [...] {{can be used}} in {{a number}} of ways: as part of garden landscaping, to extend living areas of houses, and as an {{alternative}} to stone based features such as patios. Decks are made from treated lumber, composite lumber, composite material, and Aluminum. Lumber may be Western red cedar, teak, mahogany, ipê and other <b>hardwoods.</b> Recycled <b>planks</b> may be high-density polyethylene (HDPE), polystyrene (PS) and PET plastic as well as mixed plastics and wood fiber (often called [...] "composite" [...] lumber). Artificial decking products are often called [...] "wood-plastic composites". These days, WPC's have more widely known by different brands like Trex, Azek, Ecornboard etc.|$|R
60|$|The {{vessel was}} nearly two hundred tons burden. She had {{originally}} been built very strongly, and might even have ventured on a voyage to the Polar seas just as she was. But Captain Harvey resolved to take every precaution to insure {{the success of his}} voyage, and the safety and comfort of his men. He, therefore, had the whole of the ship's bottom sheathed with thick <b>hardwood</b> <b>planking,</b> which was carried up above her water-line, as high as the ordinary floe-ice would be likely to reach. The hull inside was strengthened with stout cross-beams, as well as with beams running {{along the length of the}} vessel, and in every part that was likely to be subjected to pressure iron stanchions were fastened. But the bow of the vessel was the point where the utmost strength was aimed at. Inside, just behind the cutwater, the whole space was so traversed by cross-beams of oak that it almost became a solid mass, and outside the sharp stem was cased in iron so as to resemble a giant's chisel. The false keel was taken off, the whole vessel, in short, was rendered as strong, outside and in, as wood and iron and skill could make her. It need scarcely be said that all the other arrangements about her were made with the greatest care and without regard to expense, for although the owners of the brig did not wish to waste their money, they set too high a value on human life to risk it for the sake of saving a few pounds. She was provisioned for a cruise of two years and a half. But this was in case of accidents, for Captain Harvey did not intend to be absent much longer than one year.|$|R
50|$|Skis {{traditionally}} were hand-carved out of {{a single}} piece of hardwood such as Hickory, Birch or Ash. These woods were used because of their density and ability to handle speed and shock resistance factors associated with ski racing. Because of Europe’s dwindling forests, the ability to find quality, <b>plank,</b> <b>hardwood</b> became difficult, which led to the invention of the laminated ski. Beginning in 1891, skimakers in Norway began laminating two or more layers of wood together to make lighter cross country running skis. These evolved into the multi-laminated high-performance skis of the mid-1930s.|$|R
5000|$|The Quema House {{portrays the}} design of a typical bahay-na-bato (literally, [...] "house of stone") popular among the mestizo class. The roof has a steep pitch suggestive of {{traditional}} Chinese architecture. [...] The ground floor was used as storage and as a garage for horse-drawn carriages, while the living quarters were housed in the upper floor. The exterior walls of the upper storey are enclosed by wood-framed, sliding window panels of kapis shells (Placuna placenta, a thin-shelled oyster). All throughout the living quarters are wide <b>plank</b> <b>hardwood</b> floors.|$|R
6000|$|Soon the sleigh {{appeared}} in sight, {{coming up the}} river at full speed, and a loud [...] "hurrah!" [...] from {{the men at the}} gate, told the visitor that he was a welcome guest. It was a dog-sleigh--a sort of conveyance much used by the fur-traders in winter travelling. In form, it was as like as possible to a tin slipper bath. It might also be compared to a shoe. If the reader will try to conceive of a shoe large enough to hold a man, sitting with his legs out before him, that will give him a good idea of the shape of a dog cariole. There is sometimes an ornamental curve in front. It is made of two thin <b>hardwood</b> <b>planks</b> curled up in front, with a light frame-work of wood, covered over with deer or buffalo skin, and painted in a very gay manner. Four dogs are usually harnessed to it, and these are quite sufficient to drag a man on a journey of many days, over every sort of country, where there is no road whatever. Dogs are much used for hauling little sledges in that country in winter. The traveller sits wrapped up so completely in furs, that nothing but his head is visible. He is attended by a driver on snow-shoes, who is armed with a large whip. No reins are used. If the snow is hard, as is usually the case on the surface of a lake or river, the driver walks behind and holds on to a tail-line, to prevent the dogs from running away. If the traveller's way lies through the woods, the snow is so soft and deep that the poor dogs are neither willing nor able to run away. It is {{as much as they can}} do to walk; so the driver goes before them, in this case, and beats down the snow with his snow-shoes--"beats the track," [...] as it is called. The harness of the dogs is usually very gay, and covered with little bells which give forth a cheerful tinkling sound.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Environmental impacts {{associated}} with building materials are under increasing scrutiny in the US. A gate-to-gate life-cycle inventory (LCI) of solid strip and solid <b>plank</b> <b>hardwood</b> flooring production {{was conducted in}} the eastern US for the reporting year 2006. Survey responses from hardwood flooring manufacturing facilities in this region accounted for nearly 28 % of total US solid hardwood flooring production for that year. This study examined the materials, fuels, and energy required to produce solid hardwood flooring, coproducts, and the emissions to air, land, and water. SimaPro software was used to quantify the environmental impacts {{associated with}} the reported materials use and emissions. Impact data were allocated on their mass contribution to all product and coproduct production of 1. 0 m 3 (oven-dry mass basis) of solid hardwood flooring. Carbon flow and transportation data are provided {{in addition to the}} LCI data. Results of this study are useful for creating a cradle-to-gate inventory when linked to LCIs for the hardwood forest resource and the production of solid hardwood lumber in the same region...|$|R
50|$|The house's front {{entrance}} {{leads to the}} main hall and an open stair along its left wall. The stair handrail terminates in a shepherd's crook above a turned newel. The turned handrail spindles have a plain tapered profile. The handrail spindles and newel have a dark natural finish. South of the hall is a small sitting room connected to a bedroom in the rear. North of the hall are the main parlor and the dining room, connnected by a large doorway. The kitchen and utility spaces are in the rear wing. All the primary first-floor rooms incorporate wide <b>plank</b> <b>hardwood</b> floors, ten-foot ceilings, four-panel doors, wide shouldered Greek Revival casings and simple but wide wood base boards. The interior doorways incorporate paneled casings with corner blocks. The dining room and main parlors contain matching black marble Eastlake style fireplace mantles with decorative incising, coal grates and encaustic tile hearths. The mantle's wide proportions suggest their appearance {{is the result of}} a ca. 1880 adaptation of a preexisting mantle.|$|R
5000|$|The eastern {{section of}} the first floor is divided into a hall and [...] "best room" [...] (now the dining room), {{which may be the}} {{original}} configuration. The hall contains an enclosed stair leading to the upper floor and a stairway to the basement, which was the location of the kitchen. There is also a door to the exterior at the northern end of the hall. The eastern wall of the dining room features a fireplace and a built-in hutch; the latter is a contemporary addition. Documentation reveals that this room contained a Franklin stove in the 1820s; however, the fireplace has since been rebuilt. This room also features exposed hand-hewn beams; however, they are significantly larger than those in the west room and the ceiling itself is higher. As in the western {{section of the}} house, the ceiling in this room was originally plastered. All windows and trim on the main floor of this section appear original, as does the mantel. The first floor features wide <b>plank</b> <b>hardwood</b> floors throughout. Changes other than those noted include replacement of original hardware and possibly some of the doors.|$|R
