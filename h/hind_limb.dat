5|$|M. browni, M. harriesi, and M. schwarzi {{were all}} {{found in the}} Upper Elliot Formation of Cape Province, South Africa. All three are based on fragmentary material, and were {{regarded}} as indeterminate {{in the most recent}} review. M. browni is based on two cervical, two back, and three caudal vertebrae and miscellaneous <b>hind</b> <b>limb</b> elements. M. harriesi is known from a well-preserved forelimb and parts of a hindlimb. M. schwarzi is known from an incomplete <b>hind</b> <b>limb</b> and sacrum. M. hislopi and M. rawesi were named from fossils found in India. M. hislopi is based on vertebrae from the Upper Triassic Maleri Formation of Andhra Pradesh, whereas M. rawesi is based on a tooth from the Upper Cretaceous Takli Formation of Maharashtra. M. hislopi was tentatively retained as an indeterminate sauropodomorph in the latest review, but M. rawesi may be a theropod or nondinosaur. M. huenei is a combination derived by Cooper for Lufengosaurus huenei, as he considered Lufengosaurus and Massospondylus to be synonyms. This synonymy is no longer accepted.|$|E
5|$|Two researchers, Chris Bennett (1996) and David Peters (2000), {{have found}} pterosaurs to be protorosaurs or {{closely related to}} them. Peters used a {{technique}} called DGS, which involves applying the digital tracing features of photo editing software to images of pterosaur fossils. Bennett only recovered pterosaurs as close relatives of the protorosaurs after removing characteristics of the <b>hind</b> <b>limb</b> from his analysis, {{in an attempt to}} test the idea that these characters are the result of convergent evolution between pterosaurs and dinosaurs. However, subsequent analysis by Dave Hone and Michael Benton (2007) could not reproduce this result. Hone and Benton found pterosaurs to be closely related to dinosaurs even without <b>hind</b> <b>limb</b> characters. They also criticized previous studies by David Peters, raising questions about whether conclusions reached without access to the primary evidence, that is, pterosaur fossils, can be held to have the same weight as conclusions based strictly on first-hand interpretation. Hone and Benton concluded that, although more primitive pterosauromorphs are needed to clarify their relationships, pterosaurs are best considered archosaurs, and specifically ornithodirans, given current evidence. In Hone and Benton's analysis, pterosaurs are either the sister group of Scleromochlus or fall between it and Lagosuchus on the ornithodiran family tree. Sterling Nesbitt (2011) found strong support for a clade composed of Scleromochlus and pterosaurs.|$|E
5|$|Plateosaurus shows {{a number}} of cursorial adaptations, {{including}} an erect <b>hind</b> <b>limb</b> posture, a relatively long lower leg, an elongated metatarsus and a digitigrade foot posture. However, in contrast to mammalian cursors, the moment arms of the limb extending muscles are short, especially in the ankle, where a distinct, moment arm-increasing tuber on the calcaneum is missing. This means that in contrast to running mammals, Plateosaurus probably did not use gaits with aerial, unsupported phases. Instead, Plateosaurus must have increased speed by using higher stride frequencies, created by rapid and powerful limb retraction. Reliance on limb retraction instead of extension is typical for non-avian dinosaurs.|$|E
40|$|In {{my earlier}} {{experiments}} with spinal cats (1962) I {{established that the}} isolated lumbosacral cord is able to co-ordinate walking movements of the <b>hind</b> <b>limbs.</b> In cats {{this part of the}} cord possesses a high degree of autonomy. It seemed interesting to know whether in rabbits the isolated lumbosacral cord is also able to maintain these functions. It was especially important to establish whether the spinal rabbit can carry out the typical jumping movements with <b>hind</b> <b>limbs,</b> which serve, as is well known, in the act of progression in normal conditions. According to Laughton (1924) the synchronous bilateral jumping movements of the <b>hind</b> <b>limbs</b> seen in normal rabbits should be replaced by alternate rhythmical move-ments in spinal rabbits. After decerebration Laughton made a transection of the spinal cord in rabbits at the limit of the thoracic cord. The dorsal cutaneous nerves, which innervate the <b>hind</b> <b>limbs,</b> were isolated and prepared for stimulation. Reflex-movements of the <b>hind</b> <b>limbs</b> were observed in response to electrical stimulation with faradic currents and mechanical stimulation by pinching one toe of the hind feet. Such reflexes consist of ipsilateral flexion and crossed extension of the <b>hind</b> <b>limbs.</b> He could not provoke any synchronous bilateral movement of the <b>hind</b> <b>limbs</b> in his rabbits after transection of the cord. Laughton concludes that in rabbits the nervous mechanism in the lumbosacral cord is so arranged that it can innervate only the alternate rhythmical movements of the <b>hind</b> <b>limbs.</b> The synchronous bilateral move-ments of the <b>hind</b> <b>limbs</b> are only possible when the cord is in connexion with the supraspinal centres of the brain-stem, which lies probably in the pontine region. Whereas Laughton made a transection of the spinal cord in decerebrated rabbits and then examined the reflex-movements of the <b>hind</b> <b>limbs</b> by excitation of the sensory nerves, I carried out chronic experiments in which I studied the walking movements of the spinal animal, as I had already done in my investigations of spinal pigeons and spinal cats...|$|R

5|$|The bipedal-quadrupedal {{consensus}} was changed by a {{detailed study of}} the forelimbs of Plateosaurus by Bonnan and Senter (2007), which clearly showed that Plateosaurus was incapable of pronating its hands. The pronated position in some museum mounts had been achieved by exchanging the position of radius and ulna in the elbow. The lack of forelimb pronation meant that Plateosaurus was an obligate (i.e. unable to walk in any other way) biped. Further indicators for a purely bipedal mode of locomotion are the great difference in limb length (the <b>hind</b> <b>limb</b> is roughly {{twice as long as}} the forelimb), the very limited motion range of the forelimb, {{and the fact that the}} centre of mass rests squarely over the hind limbs.|$|E
5|$|Using one of {{the above}} definitions, dinosaurs can be {{generally}} described as archosaurs with hind limbs held erect beneath the body. Many prehistoric animal groups are popularly conceived of as dinosaurs, such as ichthyosaurs, mosasaurs, plesiosaurs, pterosaurs, and pelycosaurs (especially Dimetrodon), but are not classified scientifically as dinosaurs, and none had the erect <b>hind</b> <b>limb</b> posture characteristic of true dinosaurs. Dinosaurs were the dominant terrestrial vertebrates of the Mesozoic, especially the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. Other groups of animals were restricted in size and niches; mammals, for example, rarely exceeded {{the size of a}} domestic cat, and were generally rodent-sized carnivores of small prey.|$|E
5|$|At {{the other}} extreme, the striped {{burrowing}} frog (Cyclorana alboguttata) regularly aestivates during the hot, dry season in Australia, surviving in a dormant state {{without access to}} food and water for nine or ten months of the year. It burrows underground and curls up inside a protective cocoon formed by its shed skin. Researchers at the University of Queensland have found that during aestivation, the metabolism of the frog is altered and the operational efficiency of the mitochondria is increased. This means that the limited amount of energy available to the comatose frog is used in a more efficient manner. This survival mechanism is only useful to animals that remain completely unconscious {{for an extended period}} of time and whose energy requirements are low because they are cold-blooded and have no need to generate heat. Other research showed that, to provide these energy requirements, muscles atrophy, but <b>hind</b> <b>limb</b> muscles are preferentially unaffected. Frogs have been found to have upper critical temperatures of around 41 degrees Celsius.|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{sagittal}} plane ground reaction forces (GRFs) in ridden elite dressage horses performing ‘collected trot’ and in ‘passage’ over ground were determined. In-ground force plates captured GRF data from four Dutch Warmblood and four Lusitano horses ridden by their trainers. At least three stance phases were analysed for forelimbs and <b>hind</b> <b>limbs</b> per horse. The variables extracted were vertical and longitudinal (braking, propulsive) force maxima, their times of occurrence and the respective impulses for forelimbs and <b>hind</b> <b>limbs.</b> Lusitanos had lower vertical impulses than Dutch warmbloods in collected trot. Across all horses, passage had larger vertical impulses than collected trot in the forelimbs and <b>hind</b> <b>limbs.</b> Propulsive impulse {{increased in the}} <b>hind</b> <b>limbs</b> in passage. Prolonged stance durations in passage contributed to higher vertical impulses that are needed to increase the vertical excursions of the centre of mas...|$|R

5|$|Ji and Ji (1996) {{identified}} many {{features that}} set Sinosauropteryx {{apart from other}} birds and dinosaurs. They {{found that it was}} a small primitive bird with a relatively high skull, blunt rostrum and a slightly high premaxilla; that the antorbital fenestra was elliptical but not enlarged, the dentary was robust, the surangular was narrow and elongated, and the dentition is extremely well developed and acute; that there are over 50 extremely elongated caudals, constituting 60% of the body length, and the forelimb is extremely short with a short and thick humerus; the pubis was elongated and extremely inflated at its distal end and the ischium is broad; the <b>hind</b> <b>limb</b> was long and robust, the tibia is only slightly longer than the femur, the tarsals are separated, and the metatarsals are relatively robust with unfused proximal ends; the feathers are short, small, and uniform; many ornament the top of the skull, cervical, and dorsal regions, in addition to the dorsal and ventral caudal region.|$|E
5|$|The {{skeleton}} (catalogue number QG24) {{has been}} found weathering out of a hill slope and was partially eroded by surface exponation and plant roots. It includes the pelvis and sacrum, most of the left <b>hind</b> <b>limb</b> and foot, a right thigh bone, and twelve anterior tail vertebrae. These remains pertain to a single individual as they were all found articulated (still connected together). Additionally, several disarticulated bones were found, including the right forearm and some metacarpalia and phalanges from both {{the right and left}} forefeet, probably also pertaining to this individual. Later, the site was revisited by the scientists Geoffrey Bond and Michael Cooper, who were able to collect additional remains including a scapula (specimen QG152, a shoulder blade) and a fragment of a neck vertebra. These remains show that more than one individual was present, and it is possible that they do not pertain to Vulcanodon at all. Today, the Vulcanodon remains are stored in the Natural History Museum of Zimbabwe in Bulawayo.|$|E
5|$|Currently, both Opisthocoelicaudia and Nemegtosaurus are {{classified}} within the Titanosauria, and Jeffrey Wilson stated in 2005 that synonymy cannot be ruled out. Currie and colleagues, in 2003 and 2017, {{argued that a}} synonymy is very probable {{in the light of}} new fossil discoveries in the Nemegt Formation. After relocating the original Nemegtosaurus quarry, these researchers excavated postcranial bones of the Nemegtosaurus holotype including the centrum of a caudal vertebra and <b>hind</b> <b>limb</b> bones, which allowed, for the first time, a direct comparison between the Nemegtosaurus and Opisthocoelicaudia type specimens based on overlapping elements. These postcranial elements were found to be very similar to the corresponding parts of the Opisthocoelicaudia holotype. Most importantly, the discovered caudal centrum is opisthocoelous – a diagnostic feature of Opisthocoelicaudia – suggesting that both genera were either closely related or synonymous. Furthermore, these authors noted that none of the 32 known sauropod localities of the Nemegt Formation revealed evidence for the presence of more than one species of sauropod. In her first description, Borsuk-Białynicka (1977) argued that different sauropod genera sharing the same habitat is nothing unusual, as is evident in the North American Morrison Formation. Currie and colleagues, however, stressed that the dinosaur fauna of the Nemegt Formation was fundamentally different, as larger dinosaurs were present with only few species per clade, indicating a harsh and geographically restricted habitat. Definitive proof for the suggested synonymy is, however, still missing, and additional overlapping elements would be required before Opisthocoelicaudia and Nemegtosaurus can be formally declared synonyms.|$|E

50|$|Both {{the fore}} and <b>hind</b> <b>limbs</b> possessed {{extended}} phalanges with long, flattened claws, {{which suggests that}} Eosimops was a digger. It had short limbs, and it likely had a sprawling posture similar to its close relative Diictodon. Like Diictodon, Eosimops likely used its forelimbs for postural support and digging and its <b>hind</b> <b>limbs</b> for impact loading.|$|R
50|$|A {{distinguishing}} {{feature of this}} species was the difference in size between the fore and <b>hind</b> <b>limbs.</b> Its fore limbs were quite delicate with bones weighing 1 gram, while its <b>hind</b> <b>limbs</b> are large with bones weighing 12 grams. This difference is related to saltation. Other characteristics related to hopping locomotion include a long, but rather thin tail.|$|R
5|$|Each forelimb of {{the horse}} runs from the scapula or {{shoulder}} blade to the navicular bone. In between are the humerus (arm), radius (forearm), elbow joint, ulna (elbow), carpus (knee) bones and joint, large metacarpal (cannon), small metacarpal (splint), sesamoid, fetlock joint, first phalanx (long pastern), pastern joint, second phalanx (short pastern), coffin joint, outwardly evidenced by the coronary band, and the third phalanx (coffin or pedal) bones. Each <b>hind</b> <b>limb</b> {{of the horse}} runs from the pelvis to the navicular bone. After the pelvis come the femur (thigh), patella, stifle joint, tibia, fibula, tarsal (hock) bone and joint, large metatarsal (cannon) and small metatarsal (splint) bones. Below these, the arrangement of sesamoid and phalanx bones and joints {{is the same as}} in the forelimbs. When the horse is moving, the distal interphalangeal joint (coffin joint) has the highest amount of stresses applied to it of any joint in the body, and it can be significantly affected by trimming and shoeing techniques. Although having a small range of movement, the proximal interphalangeal joint (pastern joint) is also influential to the movement of the horse, and can change the way that various shoeing techniques affect tendons and ligaments in the legs. Due to the horse's development as a cursorial animal (one whose main form of defense is running), its bones evolved to facilitate speed in a forward direction over hard ground, without the need for grasping, lifting or swinging. The ulna shrank in size and its top portion became the point of the elbow, while the bottom fused with the radius above the radiocarpal (knee) joint, which corresponds to the wrist in humans. A similar change occurred in the fibula bone of the hind limbs. These changes were first seen in the genus Merychippus, approximately 17 million years ago.|$|E
5|$|The diet of oviraptorids {{has been}} {{interpreted}} in various ways since the time Oviraptor was wrongly {{thought to have been}} a predator of eggs. It has been suggested that oviraptorosaurs as a whole were herbivores, which is supported by the gastroliths (stomach stones) found in Caudipteryx, and the wear facets in the teeth of Incisivosaurus. In 2010 Longrich and colleagues found that oviraptorid jaws had features similar to those seen in herbivorous tetrapods (four-limbed animals), especially those of dicynodonts, an extinct group of synapsid stem-mammals. Oviraptorids and dicynodonts share features such as short, deep, and toothless mandibles; elongated dentary symphyses; elongated mandibular fenestrae; and a downwards-projecting bar in the palate. Modern animals with jaws that resemble those of oviraptorids include parrots and tortoises; the latter group also has tooth-like projections on their premaxillae. Longrich and colleagues concluded that due to the similarities between oviraptorids and herbivorous animals, the bulk of their diet would most likely have been formed by plant matter. Oviraptorids are found at high frequencies in the formations they are known from, similar to the pattern seen in dinosaurs that are known to be herbivorous; these animals were more abundant than carnivorous dinosaurs, as more energy was available at their lower trophic level in the food chain. The jaws of oviraptorids may have been specialised for processing food, such as xerophytic vegetation (adapted for environments with little water), that would have grown in their environment, but this is not possible to demonstrate, as {{little is known about the}} flora of the area at the time. A 2013 study by Lü and colleagues found that oviraptorids appear to have retained their <b>hind</b> <b>limb</b> proportions throughout ontogeny (growth), which is also a pattern mainly seen in herbivorous animals.|$|E
25|$|Alectrosaurus was {{originally}} {{characterized as a}} long-armed theropod, but Mader and Bradley (1989) observed that the forelimbs (AMNH 6368) {{did not belong to}} this individual and assigned them to the segnosauridae. The remaining material, AMNH 6554 represents the <b>hind</b> <b>limb</b> of a true tyrannosauroid, and were assigned as the lectotype for Alectrosaurus olseni. Mader and Bradley also described and assigned caudal vertebrae AMNH 21784 to this genus. These researchers concluded that Alectrosaurus was closely related to Maleevosaurus novojilov based on <b>hind</b> <b>limb</b> proportions.|$|E
