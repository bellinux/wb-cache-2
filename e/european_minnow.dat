40|$|Hamilton's {{theory of}} the selfish herd {{suggests}} that gregarious behaviour is a strategy by which individuals seek cover behind other group members {{to reduce the risk}} of predation. Therefore, it can be predicted that individuals will have less reason to seek cover within a group if the habitat itself provides physical structure, and therefore cover. We tested this prediction with <b>European</b> <b>minnows,</b> Phoxinus phoxinus, in a large, seminatural stream channel using a fully factorial design in which habitat complexity and predation risk were manipulated independently. We recorded shoal size, rates of movement and association preferences for familiar fish. Consistent with predictions, <b>European</b> <b>minnows</b> responded to the presence of predatory pike, Esox lucius, by forming larger shoals, but this effect was observed only in structurally simple habitats. Fish also responded to increased predation risk by reducing their rates of movement, and this was particularly pronounced in complex habitats. Association preferences for familiar fish were unaffected by predation risk in simple habitats. Together, these results suggest that when at risk from predation, <b>European</b> <b>minnows</b> shoal to obtain shelter, but only when there is insufficient physical structure available.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to clarify the {{interaction}} between <b>European</b> <b>minnow</b> (Phoxinus phoxinus) and brown trout (Salmo trutta), in the subalpine lake, Øvre Heimdalsvatn, with special emphasis on habitat use and diet between the two species about 40 years after the establishment of minnows in the lake. The fieldwork was carried out in three periods: June-July, July-August and August-September 2009. Nordic gillnets were used for collecting fish and to study the habitat use at four different depths (0. 5 m, 1. 5 m, 3 m and 6 m) in the littoral zone. The results indicate a clear segregation in habitat use between the <b>European</b> <b>minnow</b> and brown trout. Most of the European minnows were captured at the shallowest depth, i. e. 0. 5 m depth, whereas the majority of <b>European</b> <b>minnow,</b> regardless of depth, were captured at the lowermost section, 0 - 25 cm from the bottom. Few brown trout were captured compared to <b>European</b> <b>minnow,</b> but most brown trout was captured at 1. 5 m depth and within the whole gillnet height. However, there was a clear trend towards higher catches in the two deepest sections, 0 - 25 and 25 - 50 cm. Catches by electrofishing revealed that small European minnows, not captured by the gillnets, were frequent in the shallowest part of the littoral. Brown trout caught at deeper depths (3 and 6 m) had a larger body length (> 20 cm), than brown trout caught at 0. 5 m and 1. 5 m depths (< 20 cm). The <b>European</b> <b>minnow</b> and juvenile brown trout (< 20 cm) forage mostly on the same prey organisms i. e. Cladocera, terrestrial insects, Ephemeroptera-, Plecoptera- and Trichoptera -species, Gammarus and chironomids. Additionally, juvenile brown trout foraged on <b>European</b> <b>minnow,</b> especially in the last period, where 28. 9 volume % of the juvenile brown trout’s diet was minnow. In June-July there was a significant diet overlap (D = 63. 6 %), whereas there was no significant diet overlap in the two other periods (D = 52. 2 % and 42. 5 %). These results indicate a considerable interaction between brown trout and <b>European</b> <b>minnow</b> in Øvre Heimdalsvatn regarding both habitat use and diet. The large density of <b>European</b> <b>minnow</b> on shallow water may be a result of predation risk from brown trout. At the same time, the high <b>European</b> <b>minnow</b> density may strongly reduce available invertebrate prey for juvenile brown trout, which may seek to deeper water, where predation risk for small individuals may be higher. These interactions may lead to a reduced growth rate in brown trout due to reduced food availability, but also result in reduced recruitment to the harvestable stock because of predation on juvenile brown trout by larger brown trout. <b>European</b> <b>minnow</b> in high altitude lakes like Øvre Heimdalsvatn may thus reduce the catch potential of brown trout...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to compare the parasite fauna of brown trout (Salmo trutta) in the lake, Øvre Heimdalsvatn, {{before and after the}} establishment of a large population of the invasive species, the <b>European</b> <b>minnow</b> (Phoxinus phoxinus). Brown trout were collected in June, July and September of 2011, by means of gillnetting. A total of 392 fish were caught, of which 113 fish, evenly distributed on different length-classes from 9 cm to 39 cm, were examined for parasites. A study of the helminth fauna in the lake was done in 1969 - 72, just after the introduction of the <b>European</b> <b>minnow,</b> while the population density of the minnow was low. By repeating the study, 40 years later, we can gain valuable information on how introductions of the <b>European</b> <b>minnow</b> may affect the parasite fauna of brown trout in subalpine lakes. Nine of the parasite species were the same as those found in 1969 - 72, while one species, Eubothrium crassum, was not found, though another species, Diphyllobothrium dendriticum, not recorded in 1969 - 72 was found in 2011. The mean intensity of some species showed major changes, especially the three species Diphyllobothrium ditremum, Crepidostomum sp. and Diplostomum spathaceum, these showed great changes in abundance from 1969 - 72 to 2011. Many of the parasite species found in brown trout are dependent on one or several intermediate hosts, both vertebrates and invertebrates, and changes in the availability of these will influence the success of the parasites. The increase in fish-eating birds in the lake, Øvre Heimdalsvatn, probably {{as a result of a}} large <b>European</b> <b>minnow</b> population, may also influence the transmission rates of parasites with birds as final host. Documented changes in population dynamics of brown trout and the invertebrate community in the lake, Øvre Heimdalsvatn, has been linked to the establishment of the <b>European</b> <b>minnow,</b> and has effectively influenced the availability of intermediate hosts. As a conclusion, the <b>European</b> <b>minnow</b> has indirectly changed the premise for many of the helminth species in the lake, thus influencing the abundance of the parasite species. The changes in the parasite fauna of brown trout, demonstrate another effect on a subalpine lacustrine ecosystem, as a result of establishment of an invasive species, the <b>European</b> <b>minnow.</b> Bakgrunnen for denne oppgåva er å samanlikne parasittfaunaen hjå aure (Salmo trutta) i Øvre Heimdalsvatn før og etter etableringa av ein stor populasjon av invasjonsarten ørekyt (Phoxinus phoxinus). Fisken vart fanga med ein fast garnserie i juni, juli og september 2011. Totalt vart 392 fisk fanga, og 113 av dei, jamt fordelt på lengdeklassar frå 9 cm til 39 cm, vart undersøkt for parasittar. Parasittfaunaen i vatnet er tidlegare undersøkt i 1969 - 72, før populasjonen av ørekyt i vatnet var stor. Ved å gjera same undersøkinga no, 40 år etter, kan ein få nyttig informasjon om endringar i parasittfaunaen i eit høgfjellsvatn som følgje av ei etablering av ørekyt. Totalt ti parasittar vart funne i vatnet, inkludert ein ny art (Diphyllobothrium dendriticum). Samanlikninga av den gjennomsnittlege parasittinfeksjonen i 1969 - 1972 mot 2011 syner store skilnadar i parasittfaunaen i vatnet. Parasittane Diphyllobothrium ditremum, Crepidostomum sp. og Diplostomum spathaceum synte størst endring i gjennomsnittleg infeksjon. Fleire av parasittane i aure er avhengige av ein eller fleire mellomvertar for å fullføra livssyklusen sin, og ei endring i tettleiken av desse kan påverka suksessen til parasittane. Auken av fiskeetande fugl ved vatnet, truleg på grunn av ørekyt, kan ha påverka distribusjonen av parasittar som har fugl som endeleg vert. Dei godt dokumenterte endringane i populasjonsdynamikken hjå aure og i evertebratsamfunnet i Øvre Heimdalsvatn har vorte kopla til etableringa av ørekyt i vatnet. Dette har som ein effekt endra tilgjenge av mellomvertar. Ørekyt har indirekte endra føresetnadane for mange av parasittane og dermed også utbreiinga i vatnet.

In this laboratory study, we examined how additional noise (playback of field recordings of a ship passing through a harbour), compared with control conditions (playback of recordings from the same harbours without ship noise), affected responses to a visual predatory stimulus. We compared the anti-predator behaviour of two sympatric fish species, the three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) and the <b>European</b> <b>minnow</b> (Phoxinus phoxinus), which share similar feeding and predator ecologies, but differ in their body armour.

Genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) represent unique candidates to investigate evolutionary processes driving local adaptation to parasite communities. The present study aimed at identifying the relative roles of neutral and adaptive processes driving the evolution of MHC class IIB (MHCIIB) genes in natural populations of European minnows (Phoxinus phoxinus). To this end, we isolated and genotyped exon 2 of two MHCIIB gene duplicates (DAB 1 and DAB 3) and 1665 amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers in nine populations, and characterized local bacterial communities by 16 S rDNA barcoding using 454 amplicon sequencing. Both MHCIIB loci exhibited signs of historical balancing selection. Whereas genetic differentiation exceeded that of neutral markers at both loci, the populations' genetic diversities were positively correlated with local pathogen diversities only at DAB 3. Overall, our results suggest pathogen-mediated local adaptation in European minnows at both MHCIIB loci. While at DAB 1 selection appears to favor different alleles among populations, this is only partially the case in DAB 3, {{which appears to be}} locally adapted to pathogen communities in terms of genetic diversity.

However, Tregenza et al. suggested that in continuous input situations (where resources are supplied at a steady rate and utilised immediately) the relative competitive ability of an individual may be affected by competitor density.

These effects can cancel each other out to give the misleading idea that there is no effect of group size upon relative competitive ability.

Like many other small species of fish, rainbowfish were capable of identifying and distinguishing between individuals and choose to preferentially associate with familiar individuals as opposed to strangers.

40|$|The spatial {{distribution}} and histopathological changes induced by metacercariae of the digenean trematode Diplostomum phoxini (Faust, 1918) in {{the brains of}} <b>European</b> <b>minnows,</b> Phoxinus phoxinus (L.) from the River Endrick, Scotland were studied by light and electron microscopy. Post mortem examination of a sample of 34 minnows revealed that 50 % (n= 17) of the population were infected with 13. 7 ± 2. 6 (mean ± standard error; range 1 - 38) metacercariae per infected host. Serial histological sections of the infected minnow brains revealed that the metacercariae were unevenly distributed throughout the brain, with aggregations occurring in the cerebellum, the medulla oblongata and the optic lobes. In fish with highest intensity of infection, respectively, over 40 % of cerebellar area and about 30 % of medulla oblongata area were occupied by larvae. Metacercariae disrupt the integrity of brain tissue, with individuals being found in small pockets surrounded by cellular debris. Metacercariae were rarely encountered {{on the surface of}} the brain. Electron microscopic examination of infection sites revealed that the granular layer surrounding metacercariae was necrotic, exhibited nuclear degradation and was marked by vacuolation of the cytoplasm. Rodlet cells, the only inflammatory cell types recorded in this study were found only in parasitized brains and in close proximity to the teguments of metacercariae. It is hypothesised that secretions released from the teguments of metacercariae are a counter response to protect the metacercariae from the fish brain's cellular defence mechanisms...|$|R

40|$|Man-made noise {{can affect}} {{physiology}} and behaviour of animals of all taxa, including fish. However, {{there is not}} much known about effects of increased noise levels on anti-predator and foraging behaviour, which are both essential for survival and reproduction. In our laboratory study, we investigated effects of increased noise levels on these behaviours in two sympatric fish species, three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) and <b>European</b> <b>minnows</b> (Phoxinus phoxinus), which differ in their anti-predator defences and likely in their hearing capabilities. Our study indicated that both behavioural contexts were affected by increased noise levels, but effects differed between species. Sticklebacks responded to a visual predatory stimulus sooner when exposed to additional noise playbacks than in control conditions, whereas minnows were not affected by the noise treatments. In foraging experiments, both fish species consumed fewer water fleas, but the reasons fish decreased food consumption seemed species specific: sticklebacks increased the number of foraging errors, whereas minnows tended to decrease their foraging effort by interacting socially more often and more individuals were inactive during increased noise level conditions. To allow for controlled comparative experiments, our studies were conducted in the laboratory. Complementary field experiments ensuring natural acoustic conditions will be necessary to investigate whether species differences can translate into community effects and whether these effects differ between different kinds of noise, such as drilling, pile driving and energy device operation noise. Expanding research to commercially important fish and quantification of particle motion in addition to sound pressure as most fish, and likely invertebrate species, perceive particle motion rather than sound pressure, would further deliver valuable knowledge for industry, policy makers and fisheries managers about how marine renewable energy devices may interfere with the marine environment.

40|$|Until the 1970 's {{research}} on predator-prey interactions in fish was rare. But {{in the last}} few decades, interest in the topic has grown explosively. By now there are thousands of articles on the topic. One aspect that has received special attention is learning. Research makes it increasingly clear that fish are not the anti-social, memory-impaired blobs they were once thought to be, but that they are intelligent creatures that form social relationships with their shoal mates and perform sophisticated techniques to outwit their predators and / or prey (Laland et al 2003; Bshary et al 2002). Many fish species live in groups or shoals. Shoals provide their members with advantages, such as a choice of breeding partner, as well as disadvantages, such as food competition (Krause & Ruxton 2002). When shoaling fish detect a predator they aggregate, forming a more compact shoal (e. g. Templeton & Shriner 2005 : guppies; Ferrari et al 2005 : fathead minnows; Brown et al 2004 : glowlight tetras; Magurran & Pitcher 1987 : <b>European</b> <b>minnows).</b> Also, several studies find that fish living in predator-dense areas spend more time aggregated than their conspecifics in less predator-dense areas. So it seems protection from predation is a major advantage of shoaling (Seghers 1974 : guppies; Magurran 1986 : minnows). In this review I will focus on how this protection by shoaling arises. I will show that shoaling does not always protect, but may expose their members to predation instead. In addition I will discuss various techniques employed by predators to deal with shoaling prey. Finally I will show how these predatorprey interactions are shaped by learning. In the course of this review it will become clear that the theories commonly used to explain the anti-predator benefits of shoaling are difficult to prove with empirical data. In their attempts to do so, researchers use experimental set-ups, so tightly controlled, that their naturalness becomes doubtful. Also, the number of species used in research is limited, casting doubt on the universality of our current knowledge. The text is accompanied by examples from various studies. These either illustrate the issues discussed or add an extra dimension to them. ...|$|R
50|$|There are 11 reptile and 8 {{amphibian}} species. There are Central European species (fire salamander, yellow-bellied toad, smooth snake), Palearctic (common toad, European green toad, common frog), Euro-Siberian (European tree frog, common European viper, grass snake, viviparous lizard), Irano-Turanian (marsh frog), Southern European (agile frog), Euro-Mediterranean (European green lizard), Mediterranean (common wall lizard) and Balkan (Erhard's wall lizard). The ichthyofauna includes 6 fish species: common <b>minnow,</b> <b>European</b> eel (considered extinct), western vairone, brown trout, {{rainbow trout}} and brook trout. The {{limited number of}} species {{is determined by the}} high altitude of the park. The glacial lakes, streams and upper river courses are inhabited by few fish species. The western vairone is known only from the Kremenski lakes and might in fact represent a new undescribed species.|$|R
50|$|Of the 42 {{species of}} fish found in Scottish fresh waters, only half have arrived by natural colonisation. Native species include allis shad, brown trout, European eel and river lamprey. Scottish rivers support {{one of the largest}} Atlantic salmon {{resources}} in Europe, with nearly 400 rivers supporting genetically distinct populations. Five fish species are considered 'late arrivals' to Scotland, having colonised by natural means prior to 1790. They are the northern pike, roach, stone loach, <b>European</b> perch, and <b>minnow.</b> Rarer native species include the endemic Salvelinus killinensis and the powan, the latter found in only two locations and under threat from introduced ruffe and the Arctic charr. The latter may have been the first fish species to re-enter fresh waters when the last ice age ended, and about 200 populations exist.|$|R
40|$|Studies of {{the brown}} trout (Salmo trutta) {{population}} in the subalpine lake, Øvre Heimdalsvatn, on the eastern slope of the Jotunheimen Mountains, have been performed since 1957 until today. The exploitation {{of the population was}} reserved for scientific purposes until in 1992, when the lake was opened for ordinary angling. At the same time, the experimental fishery by gillnets has been limited during the last decades compared to the gillnet effort during the period 1958 – 1970. Based on the earlier studies, the trout population size and the exploitation by gillnets have been known, but no studies of the angling activity and catch obtained by the anglers have been performed. The lake is located in a popular destination for hikers and tourists. Angler effort and catches were estimated by observations and interviews of anglers present at the lake, in addition to reports submitted by anglers to the fisheries management authorities. I conducted 46 visits for interviewing anglers during June, July and August in 2015 and 2016, both covering weekdays and weekends, between 1000 – 2200 hours. To estimate the trout population size and structure, I used a pilot fleet of eight gillnets consisting of mesh sizes (bar mesh) from 24 to 39 mm, with a high capture probability for trout of age-class four winters and older, hereafter referred to as post recruits, in the range 20 – 45 cm. Based on capture data from earlier studies, regarding regressions between catch per unit effort with a gillnet pilot and population numbers, I have estimated the population size and structure from catches per gillnet-effort on my pilot fleet, for post recruits. The angling season range from approximately mid-June to mid-October. According to the interviews and reports, the angler catches consisted of 28. 4 kg trout all together, during the fishing seasons 2015 and 2016. The gillnet catches obtained by a university course and my own gillnetting were far larger, 81. 1 kg and 72. 2 kg in 2015 and 2016, respectively. The estimated number of post recruits of trout were almost 8, 000 fish in 2015 and 7, 300 in 2016. The age distribution ranged between 4 and 18 winters, with lengths varying between 17 and 46 cm. Compared to studies in the period 1960 – 1970, the trout population had approximately the same size today, although the total exploitation is much lower now. Accordingly, neither the anglers nor the gillnetting seem to be a regulatory factor today. Reduced recruitment due to internal regulation is more likely the main regulation. Based on earlier studies, {{it is likely that the}} introduction of <b>European</b> <b>minnows</b> (Phonixus phonixus) limits the use of the sheltered, stony part of the littoral of trout juveniles, and forces the juvenile trout to use open water and expose themselves for predation. If the goal is to attract more anglers to the lake, more information about the good angling possibilities should be presented, in addition to investigate the preferences of anglers that visit the lake...|$|R
