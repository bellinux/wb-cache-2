40|$|This {{trial is}} aimed to study leather {{properties}} that produced from Sudan Desert {{sheep and goats}} in relation to breed type and age category. Thirty pieces of fresh sheep and goats skins were collected randomly (15 for each) during January 2015. The collected skins were tanned and the produced leather properties were studied. The Statistix 8 program for variance analysis was used for data analysis. The study samples were taken according to the Complete Randomized Design. Sheep leather results revealed that, lamb's skin was significantly (P ≥ 0. 05) produced better quality leather than ram's and ewe's skins in elongation (%), tensile strength (kg/cm 2), cracking load (kg), thickness (mm), tear load (kg/cm), flexibility and moisture%. While it was yielded leather with the same characteristics to ram's and ewe's leather in Ash (%), fat (%) and chrome (%). Leather properties [elongation (%), tensile strength (kg/cm 2), cracking load (kg), tear load (kg/cm), flexibility and Ash (%) ] were significantly (P ≥ 0. 05) affected by breed variation. On the other hand thickness (mm), moisture (%), fat (%) and chrome (%) were not significantly (P ≥ 0. 05) affected by breed. Ram's skin was produced better quality <b>leather</b> than ewe's <b>skins.</b> Goat's <b>leather</b> results revealed that, <b>kid</b> goat's <b>skin</b> was significantly (P ≥ 0. 05) produced better quality leather than bucks and doe's skin in tensile strength (kg/cm 2), cracking load (kg), thickness (mm), tear load (kg/cm) and flexibility degree. But <b>kids</b> and buck's <b>skins</b> were produced the same quality leather in elongation % and moisture% with significant variation (P ≥ 0. 05) to doe's <b>leather.</b> <b>Kid's</b> <b>skin</b> yields <b>leather</b> with the same characteristics to buck's and doe's leather in Ash (%), fat (%) and chrome (%). Generally Desert goats produce slightly better quality leather than Nubian goats. Leather prosperities [cracking load (kg), tear load (kg/cm), and Ash (%) ] were significantly (P ≥ 0. 05) affected by breed variation. Elongation (%), tensile strength (kg/cm 2), thickness (mm), moisture (%), fat (%), flexibility and chrome% were not significantly (P ≥ 0. 05) affected by goats breed...|$|R

25|$|Historically, the {{majority}} of trade in the region came through Port Elizabeth. In the 1830s, at least five ships regularly transported goods to Europe. It became a free port in 1832. In 1833, about 50 vessels had moved through the port. In 1828, 55,201 pounds, (25038kg), of goods were imported through the port, increasing by 1832 to 112,845 pounds, (51185kg), imported in that year. Port Elizabeth exported 41,290 pounds, (18738kg), in 1828, with a large increase to 86,931 pounds, (39431kg), goods exported in 1829.

40|$|Natural dried <b>skin</b> and <b>leather</b> {{which comes}} from fresh skin {{has been used for}} many {{applications}} in the automotive sector, furniture, clothes and other industries. However, the biomechanical properties of these materials have not been well established. Therefore, this study attempts to quantify and investigate the parameters o f fresh goat skin (Category I), natural dried skin (Category II) and leather (Category III), which also include orthotropic analysis (longitudinal and transverse directions). Uniaxial tensile test (ASTM D 2099 - 00) was conducted to obtain engineering stress-stretch data for all categories. Analytical and numerical approaches were also adapted to quantify the material parameters. Engineering stress-stretch curves for both approaches were fitted to the experiment data by adapting three hyperelastic materials models (i. e. neo- Hookean, Mooney-Rivlin and Ogden). Numerical approach adapting the Ogden model is likely the best hyperelastic material model in representing the parameters o f fresh goat skin, natural dried <b>skin</b> and <b>leather.</b> For each category, the Ogden parameters (a and |j.) range value were found from 15. 154 to 18. 344 and from 0. 152 MPa to 0. 277 MPa (Category I), from 0. 675 to 5. 652 and from 107. 416 MPa to 1185. 859 MPa (Category II) from 14. 815 to 15. 885 and from 1. 827 MPa to 4. 441 MPa (Category III) respectively. This study also found out that among fresh goat skin, natural dried <b>skin</b> and <b>leather,</b> natural dried <b>skin</b> was the stiffest skin of them all. As a conclusion, the biomechanical properties of fresh goat skin, natural dried <b>skin</b> and <b>leather</b> has been quantified, and thus proving that the objective o f the study has been achieved successfully...|$|R

By 1830, the dominant Yoruba and Hausa Muslim groups that settled in Ibadan land include the Oyo-Yoruba, Ife and Egba, Nupe and Bornu groups. 2 I...|$|R

The paper then investigated if there is unexploited trade potential. The investigation revealed that among others, South Korea, United Kingdom, USA, Zambia and Zimbabwe have unexploited export potential.
