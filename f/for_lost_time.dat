25|$|The {{speed and}} {{punctuality}} of many LB passenger services {{was the subject}} of widespread criticism in the technical and popular press during the 1890s. This was in part {{due in part to the}} complexity of the system between London and Croydon, with a large number of signals and junctions, the sharing of stretches of line with the SER, and the relatively short routes, which gave little opportunity to make up <b>for</b> <b>lost</b> <b>time.</b> The LB gradually began to rebuild its reputation during the twentieth century through improvements to main-line infrastructure and electrification of suburban services.|$|E

25|$|Alcohol {{is often}} used {{as a form of}} {{self-treatment}} of insomnia to induce sleep. However, alcohol use to induce sleep can be a cause of insomnia. Long-term use of alcohol is associated with a decrease in NREM stage 3 and 4 sleep as well as suppression of REM sleep and REM sleep fragmentation. Frequent moving between sleep stages occurs, with awakenings due to headaches, the need to urinate, dehydration, and excessive sweating. Glutamine rebound also plays a role as when someone is drinking; alcohol inhibits glutamine, one of the body's natural stimulants. When the person stops drinking, the body tries to make up <b>for</b> <b>lost</b> <b>time</b> by producing more glutamine than it needs.|$|E

It shows the aftermath of an execution, as two men haul the body away to be thrown into the sea; it was described as [...] "poetry on canvas" [...] by William Macready, who bought it from Etty.

Etty had put far more work into this than was usual for a portrait, remarking to the Williams-Wynn family that he intended [...] "to make a fine work of Art as well as a resemblance". Showing Williams-Wynn's daughters Charlotte and Mary in elaborate Italian-style costumes, it was critically well received as evidence that Etty was able to paint a major work that did not rely on nudity, as well as demonstrating that Etty could paint on commission for the elite, leading to further commissions. The Warrior Arming was a study of Godfrey de Bouillon. painted to satisfy the then-current fad for medievalism. Etty had recently developed an interest in collecting pieces of armour, and The Warrior Arming is a technically adept study of the effects of lights from multiple sources shining on polished armour.|$|E
