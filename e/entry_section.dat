500|$|Clackline Bridge {{continued}} to be a safety concern, with several accidents occurring in the 1970s. The narrow road and small curve radius were considered major factors in the accidents, and there was roughness in the road surface between the original and widened sections. A reinforced concrete overlay was installed on the bridge in 1978, initially with a single coat surface, but then upgraded to a [...] bituminous concrete surface in 1987. The 1980s saw the closure and removal of the Perth–Northam railway line, as well a number of major and sometimes fatal accidents involving prime movers. There were also several car accidents, and the [...] "screaming brakes of cars and hiss of airbrakes" [...] were often heard at night in Clackline. After each accident, damaged sections of the bridge – usually the guardrails, handrails, or bridge <b>entry</b> <b>section</b> – needed to be repaired. A 1989 prime mover accident severely damaged the footpath. Rather than repair the narrow footpath, and given that the railway had been removed, a new pedestrian path was constructed on the ground below the bridge.|$|E
2500|$|Depending on {{train station}} {{platform}} heights, three designs {{can be used}} for entry - high platforms require use of a [...] "split level" [...] car design, where the doors are located on a middle level, with access into the upper or lower level branching off - with stairs or ramps going both up and down (sometimes this configuration includes a section of seating at the middle level in the <b>entry</b> <b>section,</b> with double levels only in part of the lengths of the car). For low train station platforms, a [...] "two floor" [...] design with level entry onto the lower floor is used. Occasionally a third, very tall [...] "two floors over-wheel" [...] design is used. This is a traditional single floor car [...] "with a second story" [...] design with, when using low platform, requires steps up to a traditional floor height and then internal stairs up to the upper floor.|$|E

It has projecting <b>entry</b> <b>sections</b> on the north and south sides, with stylistically sympathetic additions to the south and west. It was built in 1905, gutted by a major fire in 1913, after which its interior was rebuilt.

50|$|No {{reader can}} engage in the <b>entry</b> <b>section</b> if the readtry {{semaphore}} has been set by a writer previously. The reader must wait for the last writer to unlock the resource and readtry semaphores. On the other hand, if a particular reader has locked the readtry semaphore, this will indicate to any potential concurrent writer {{that there is a}} reader in the <b>entry</b> <b>section.</b> So the writer will wait for the reader to release the readtry and then the writer will immediately lock it for itself and all subsequent writers. However, the writer {{will not be able to}} access the resource until the current reader has released the resource, which only occurs after the reader is finished with the resource in the critical section.|$|E

40|$|The group mutual {{exclusion}} (GME) problem deals with sharing {{a set of}} (m) mutually exclusive resources among all (n) processes of a network. Processes are allowed {{to be in a}} critical section simultaneously provided they request the same resource. We present three group {{mutual exclusion}} solutions for tree networks. All three solutions do not use process identifiers and use bounded size messages. They achieve the best context-switch complexity, which is O(min(n, m)). The first solution uses a fixed root of the tree and uses 0 to O(n) messages per critical <b>section</b> <b>entry.</b> This solution supports an unbounded degree of concurrency, thus providing the maximum resource utilization. The second solution also uses a fixed root, but uses a reduced number of messages for the critical <b>section</b> <b>entry.</b> It generates an average of O(log n) messages per critical <b>section</b> <b>entry</b> and also allows an unbounded degree of concurrency. We remove the restriction of using a fixed root in the third solution in addition to maintaining all other desirable properties of the second solution...|$|R
