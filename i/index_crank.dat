50|$|Indexing is an {{operation}} of dividing a periphery of a cylindrical workpiece into {{equal number of}} divisions by the help of <b>index</b> <b>crank</b> and index plate.A manual indexing head includes a hand crank. Rotating the hand crank in turn rotates the spindle and therefore the workpiece. The hand crank uses a worm gear drive to provide precise control of {{the rotation of the}} work. The work may be rotated and then locked into place before the cutter is applied, or it may be rotated during cutting {{depending on the type of}} machining being done.|$|E

In comparison with the conventional indexing {{cam mechanism}}, the double <b>crank</b> <b>indexing</b> cam mechanism has a more compact structure due to the coaxial input/output arrangement, and enables more stops to be produced at the same input speed. This paper introduces a dynamic model of the cam system by taking this mechanism as research object, and makes systematic analysis about the constrained forces of the new mechanism. On that basis, {{the effectiveness of the}} approach is validated by the examples. The results of the study provide important theoretical foundation for the working of this new mechanism...|$|R

OBD-II, standardizes {{on the amount}} of memory (Freeze Frame) it uses to store the readings of the vehicle sensor when it logs on emission related Intermittent Trouble code (IT). The intent of OBD-II, systems is to detect most vehicle malfunctions when performance of a power train component or system deteriorates {{to the point that the}} vehicle’s HC emission exceed standard. The vehicle operator is notified at the time when the vehicle begins to marginally exceed emission standards, by illuminating the Malfunctions Indicator Light (MIL). <b>Index</b> Terms- <b>Crank</b> angle Idle Air Control Valve, Malfunctions Indicator Light (MIL), Mass Air Flow (MAF) sensor...|$|R

It is very difficult to indexing and positioning of hollow circular component by <b>index</b> plate with <b>crank</b> and sector mechanism. In this project an attempt has been made for the design and fabrication of jig and fixture for indexing and positioning of hollow cylindrical component in drilling machine at lesser cost. Quality of the performance of a process largely influenced by the quality of jigs and fixtures used for this purpose. The main purpose of a fixture is to locate and in the cases hold a work piece during an operation. A jig differs from a fixture in the sense that it guides the tool to its correct position or towards its correct movement during an operation in addition to locating and supporting the work piece...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—An online {{optimization}} procedure {{provides the}} pa-rameters of a nonlinear battery model by {{taking into account}} {{a few minutes of}} measured current–voltage data. Within a defined range in terms of charge current, state of charge (SOC), and duration of charge and discharge events, the model is able to capture the relevant battery dynamics and predict the behavior for the next few minutes. From the battery behavior during specific events, the state of the battery can be revealed, which is defined as the state of function. Validation, which is carried out on measured current–voltage profiles, shows the accuracy of prediction during the high-rate partial SOC operation. Even with the data measured during a city drive within a microhybrid electrical vehicle, the method is able to predict the voltage level during high-rate dis-charge pulses (<b>cranking).</b> <b>Index</b> Terms—Battery model, charge acceptance, high-rate par-tial state-of-charge (HRPSOC), hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), lead-acid battery, state of function (SOF).

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{computer program}} {{is used to}} simulate the unsteady gas flow in the exhaust and inlet systems of a six-cylinder, marine duty, turbocharged, aftercooled, medium-high speed, indirect injection, four-stroke diesel engine which is installed at the authors' laboratory. The simulation assumes one-dimensional, time varying, gas flow in the engine pipes and incorporates numerous realistic thermodynamic and heat transfer features. The characteristics mathematical transformation solution, of the gas flow dynamics partial differential equations, is interfaced with first law analysis models of the cylinders main chambers and prechambers, while the engine turbocharger system is simulated in both an efficient and low computer-time cost manner. The simulation results compare favourably against the engine's performance experimental results, which include mean air consumption rate, pressure histories at various locations on the exhaust system, and energy-mean temperature values at the exit of the exhaust system. The simulation results are also utilized for {{the determination of the}} various cylinders exhaust waves intensity, as they are imposed by the design characteristics of the exhaust manifold. The plotting of relevant charts, showing the contour variations of gas pressure, temperature and Mach <b>index</b> against engine <b>crank</b> angle and pipe length, aids in the correct interpretation of the observed behaviour...|$|R
40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{digital computer}} program {{is used to}} simulate the unsteady gas flow in the exhaust and inlet systems of a multi-cylinder, turbocharged, medium-high speed, four-stroke diesel engine installed at the authors' laboratory. The simulation assumes one-dimensional, time-varying gas flow in the engine pipes and incorporates numerous realistic fluid dynamic, thermodynamic and heat-transfer features. The characteristic mathematical transformation solution of the gas-flow dynamics partial differential equations is interfaced with First-Law analysis models of the cylinders main chambers and prechambers. The simulation results are compared most favourably against the engine's experimental performance results, which include mean air consumption rate, pressure histories at various locations on the exhaust system, and energy-mean temperature values at the exit of the exhaust system.

The plotting of relevant charts, showing the contour variation of gas pressure, temperature and Mach <b>index</b> against engine <b>crank</b> angle and pipe length, aids the correct interpretation of the observed behaviour. The detailed simulation of the fluid dynamic and heat-transfer fields in the engine exhaust system, permits an interesting parametric study of the influence of the degree of insulation of the exhaust system on the energy and exergy (availability) content of the exhaust gases before the turbocharger turbine, by coupling the above First-Law with Second-Law analysis concepts. © 1994...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of a comprehensive computer program for solving the unsteady flow problem in the inlet and exhaust manifolds of a multi-cylinder piston internal combustion engine is described. The mathematical simulation assumes one dimensional perfect gas flow in the pipes, incorporating wall friction, transient heat transfer rates, area and entropy gradients and variable gas specific heats with temperature and composition. The governing set of hyperbolic equations is transformed, via the characteristic curves mathematical technique, {{to a group of}} three slope equations, constituting the two wave characteristics and the pathline curves coupled with their associated compatibility equations, giving the change of the two Riemann variables and entropy along the above curves. The resulting set of differential equations is converted into a finite differences one and is solved on a normalized space and time field to provide the gas state and velocity distributions in all engine pipes, during a working engine cycle. Special attention is paid to setting up the appropriate boundary conditions at the pipes ends. As a validation of the present methodology, the analysis results are compared favourably with experimental data for a spark ignition engine taken from the literature. Using the analysis results, detailed charts are plotted showing the contours variation of gas pressure, temperature and Mach <b>index</b> against engine <b>crank</b> angle (time) and (inlet or exhaust) pipe length, providing useful information for the physical mechanisms involved and aiding towards the correct interpretation of the observed engine behaviour...|$|R
