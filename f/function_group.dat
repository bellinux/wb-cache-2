40|$|To {{separate}} functional from phylogenetic pelvic {{differences in}} Aves, seventy-seven birds were measured and statistically analyzed {{to define the}} characters that unite them into <b>function</b> <b>groups,</b> and to identify the characters that separate the <b>function</b> <b>groups</b> from each other. Four Major <b>Function</b> <b>Groups</b> were identified: Birds of Prey (Chapter II) Waterbirds (Chapter III), Ground birds and Stalker-wader birds (Chapter V). Birds of Prey statistically separate into Air predators and Scavengers. Waterbirds statistically divide into Surface swimmers, Wing-propelled divers, and Foot-propelled divers. A suite of pelvic characters (Level One indicators) can separate nonpasseriformes birds into <b>function</b> <b>groups.</b> These are: length to width ratio of the pelvis, iliac angle, relative iliac surface areas and pre-acetabular ilium proportions. A second suite of characters (Level Two indicators), used by themselves, shows trends, but do not completely separate the <b>function</b> <b>groups.</b> These are proportional length of lower leg components, and femur length: pelvis length ratio. Combining the identified characters in Principal Component Analysis and Discriminant Function Analysis produces a good split among the <b>function</b> <b>groups.</b> When all of the birds are combined into a single analysis (Chapter V), using Level one and Level Two characters, the plots generated have Stalker-wader birds at the center, with three groups radiating out. One arm is Ground Birds, another is Waterbirds, {{and the third is}} Birds of Prey. ^ Pelvic musculature dissections of a representative from each group are compared (Chapter VI). The picture drawn from the muscle data is different. The muscle data suggest that Ground Birds are the central group. Ground Birds (represented by a pigeon) have leg/pelvic muscles neither specialized for specific femoral movements, nor for specific tibiotarsal movements. No particular group of muscles is hypertrophied, and no major groups are reduced or missing. The other three <b>function</b> <b>groups</b> of birds show some degree of specialization, either by reducing or accentuating muscles, or by losing muscles completely. The result is a statistical portrait of four bird <b>function</b> <b>groups</b> that has implications for the sequence of morphological changes seen in avian radiations of the Tertiary. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} my {{study was to}} examine how music {{teachers}} can create a well <b>functioning</b> <b>group</b> dynamic that benefits learning within an ensemble. The study was based on the following questions: (1) How can the leader of a group contribute to a well <b>functioning</b> <b>group</b> dynamic? (2) Which ways of thinking and attitudes are beneficial to convey to the students? (3) Which are the most common social obstacles for a well <b>functioning</b> <b>group</b> dynamic? The method of the study was qualitative. I chose to interview 4 music teachers from Norrbotten that teach at music school and Music University. The result showed that the group dynamic within an ensemble is affected by many different factors. The positive atmosphere, an accepting attitude, a humorous outlook on things, the ability to see se eachothers differences as assets and to have common goals emerged as important factors in creating a well <b>functioning</b> <b>group</b> dynamic.

50|$|In 1994, {{researchers}} from Zeria Pharmaceuticals unveiled cyanopyrrolidines with a nitrile <b>function</b> <b>group</b> that {{was assumed to}} form an imidate with the catalytic serine. Concurrently other DPP-4 inhibitors without a nitrile group were published but they contained other serine-interacting motifs, e.g. boronic acids, phosphonates or diacyl hydroxylamines. These compounds were not as potent because of the similarity of DPP-4 and prolyl oligopeptidase (PEP) and also suffered from chemical instability. Ferring Pharmaceuticals filed for patent on two cyanopyrrolidine DPP-4 inhibitors, which they published in 1995. These compounds had excellent potency and improved chemical stability.|$|E

However, in terms of motor outcome in immature brains, no study has been reported on the less affected corticospinal tract in hemiplegic pediatric patients. Therefore, we {{examined the relationship between}} the condition of the less affected corticospinal tract and motor function in hemiplegic pediatric patients. Forty patients with hemiplegia due to perinatal or prenatal injury (13. 7 Â± 3. 0 months) and 40 age-matched typically developing controls were recruited.

Diffusion tensor tractography images showed that compared with the control group, the patient group of the less affected corticospinal tract showed significantly increased fiber number and significantly decreased fractional anisotropy value. Significantly increased fiber number and significantly decreased fractional anisotropy value in the low <b>functioning</b> <b>group</b> were observed than in the high <b>functioning</b> <b>group.</b> These findings suggest that activation of the less affected hemisphere presenting as increased fiber number and decreased fractional anisotropy value is related to poor motor function in pediatric hemiplegic patients...|$|R

40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to: 1) assess the {{feasibility}} of left ventricular (LV) vortex flow analysis using contrast echocardiography (CE); and 2) characterize and quantify LV vortex flow in normal subjects and patients with LV systolic dysfunction. Vortices that form during LV filling have specific geometry and anatomical locations that are critical determinants of directed blood flow during ejection. Therefore, it is clinically relevant to assess the vortex flow patterns to better understand the LV function. Twenty-five patients (10 normal and 15 patients with abnormal LV systolic function) underwent CE with intravenous contrast agent, Definity (Bristol-Myers Squibb Medical Imaging, Inc., North Billerica, Massachusetts). The velocity vector and vorticity were estimated by particle image velocimetry. Average vortex parameters including vortex depth, transverse position, length, width, and sphericity index were measured. Vortex pulsatility parameters including relative strength, vortex relative strength, and vortex pulsation correlation were also estimated. Vortex depth and vortex length were significantly lower in the abnormal LV <b>function</b> <b>group.</b> Vortex width was greater and sphericity index was lower in the abnormal LV <b>function</b> <b>group.</b> Relative strength, vortex relative strength, and vortex pulsation correlation were significantly lower in the abnormal LV <b>function</b> <b>group.</b> It was feasible to quantify LV vorticity arrangement by CE using particle image velocimetry in normal subjects and those with LV systolic dysfunction, and the vorticity imaging by CE may serve as a novel approach to depict vortex, the principal quantity to assess the flow structure...|$|E
