5|$|Animal {{navigation}} is {{the ability}} of many animals to <b>find</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> accurately without maps or instruments. Birds such as the Arctic tern, insects such as the monarch butterfly and fish such as the salmon regularly migrate thousands of miles to and from their breeding grounds, and many other species navigate effectively over shorter distances.|$|E
5|$|A temulent bee is {{more likely}} to stick out its tongue, or proboscis. Inebriated bees spend more time flying. If a bee is {{sufficiently}} intoxicated, it will just lie on its back and wiggle its legs. Inebriated bees typically have many more flying accidents as well. Some bees that consume ethanol become too inebriated to <b>find</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> back to the hive, and will die as a result. Bozic et al. (2006) found that alcohol consumption by honeybees disrupts foraging and social behaviors, and has some similar effects to poisoning with insecticides. Some bees become more aggressive after consuming alcohol.|$|E
5|$|Crawford led about 500 {{volunteer}} militiamen, {{mostly from}} Pennsylvania, deep into American Indian territory, {{with the intention}} of surprising the Indians. The Indians and their British allies from Detroit had already learned of the expedition, however, and gathered a force to oppose the Americans. After a day of indecisive fighting near the Sandusky towns, the Americans found themselves surrounded and attempted to retreat. The retreat turned into a rout, but most of the Americans managed to <b>find</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> back to Pennsylvania. About 70 Americans were killed; Indian and British losses were minimal.|$|E

5|$|After socialist {{gains in}} the legislature, the Argentine {{government}} introduced several bills in May 1914 which would have put the battleships up for sale, {{but they were all}} defeated by late June. Following the commencement of the First World War, the German and British ambassadors to the United States both complained to the US State Department; the former believed that the British were going to be given the ships as soon as the ships reached Argentina, and the latter considered it the responsibility of the United States to ensure that the ships never left Argentina's possession. International armament companies attempted to get Argentina to sell to one of the smaller Balkan countries and expected that the ships would then <b>find</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> into the war.|$|E

Foraging workers use visual cues {{to help them}} <b>find</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> around, or to let them determine that they are lost; workers will identify landmarks they are familiar with to orientate themselves. When provoked, an individual banded sugar ant will lift up its abdomen and use its large mandibles to fend off an attacker.

5|$|Docile and slow-moving, zebra {{sharks are}} not {{dangerous}} to humans {{and can be}} easily approached underwater. However, they have bitten divers who pull on their tails or attempt to ride them. As of 2008 there is one record of an unprovoked attack in the International Shark Attack File, though no injuries resulted. They are popular attractions for ecotourist divers in the Red Sea, off the Maldives, off Thailand's Phuket and Phi Phi islands, on the Great Barrier Reef, and elsewhere. Many zebra sharks at diving sites have become accustomed {{to the presence of}} humans, taking food from divers' hands and allowing themselves to be touched. The zebra shark adapts well to captivity and is displayed by a number of public aquaria around the world.

5|$|It is {{suggested}} that people should avoid jack jumpers, but this is difficult to do. Closed footwear (boots and shoes) along with socks reduce the chances of encountering a sting, but wearing thongs or sandals will put the person at risk. With this said, they are still capable of stinging through fabric, and can <b>find</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> through gaps in clothing. Most stings occur when people are gardening, so taking extra caution or avoiding gardening altogether is recommended. People can also avoid encountering jack jumpers by moving to locations where jack jumper populations are either low or absent, or eliminate nearby nests. Since Myrmecia ants have different venoms, people who are allergic to them are advised {{to stay away from}} all Myrmecia ants, especially to ones they have not encountered before.|$|E

Lisa alerts the police to Bob's location, but Bob deflates the blimp and kidnaps Bart, before stealing the original Wright Brothers aircraft, which had been an exhibit at the air show. Bob attempts to carry out a kamikaze attack against the civil defense shack where Krusty is hiding, but the slow-moving plane ends up merely bouncing harmlessly off the shack. The authorities quickly arrest Bob and take him into custody while Bart is reunited with his family.|$|E

5|$|Most {{tropical}} cyclones form on {{the side}} of the subtropical ridge closer to the equator, then move poleward past the ridge axis before recurving north and northeast into the main belt of the Westerlies. When the subtropical ridge shifts due to El Niño, so will the preferred tropical cyclone tracks. Areas west of Japan and Korea tend to experience many fewer September–November tropical cyclone impacts during El Niño and neutral years. During El Niño years, the break in the subtropical ridge tends to lie near 130°E, which would favor the Japanese archipelago. During La Niña years, the formation of tropical cyclones, and the subtropical ridge position, shift westward across the western Pacific Ocean, which increases the landfall threat to China and greater intensity to Philippines. Those that form near the Marshall Islands <b>find</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> to Jeju Island, Korea.|$|E
