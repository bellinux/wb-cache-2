5|$|One of {{the best}} sermons I have ever been privileged to hear was by the late Bishop of Winchester. Social exclusion? He said {{virtually}} that if one sheep from a flock of 100 goes missing, the good shepherd worries frantically about that single sheep until it is safely found. There are too many sheep, men, women and children, being marginalised. John the Baptist had the answer: why <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>not?</b> I remain concerned in these turbulent times, but {{thank you for your}} patience. It has been my privilege to be able to speak in your Lordships' House.|$|E

500|$|Another difficulty, {{related to}} the first one, is the absence or rarity of {{transitional}} varieties in time. Darwin commented that by the theory of natural selection [...] "innumerable transitional forms must have existed," [...] and wondered [...] "why <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>not</b> find them embedded in countless numbers in the crust of the earth?" [...] (for further discussion of these difficulties, see [...] and Bernstein et al. and Michod) ...|$|E
500|$|A {{phrase from}} The Tempest is {{mentioned}} by Gorkon as representing the new galactic order, {{that of a}} [...] "brave new world". Chang recites most of the lines from Shakespeare used in the film, including quotes from Romeo and Juliet and Henry IV, Part 2 in his parting words to Kirk after dinner. During Kirk's trial, Chang also mocks Kirk with lines from Richard II. The final battle above Khitomer contains seven references to five of Shakespeare's plays. Two references are drawn from the title character's lines in King Henry V ("Once more unto the breach"/"The game's afoot"), while two more quotations are from Julius Caesar ("I am as constant as the Northern Star"/"Cry 'havoc!' and let slip the dogs of war"). There is a single reference to Prospero from The Tempest ("Our revels now are ended"), and Chang shortens the wronged Shylock's speech from The Merchant of Venice: [...] "Tickle us, <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>not</b> laugh; prick us, <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>not</b> bleed; and wrong us, shall we not revenge?" ...|$|E
500|$|After {{the show}} ended, several media outlets {{reported}} that Madonna {{may have been}} drunk during the performance; however, Madonna blasted these reports, by responding: [...] "Thanks for supporting me. Too bad people don't know the art of acting and playing a character. I could never do any of my shows high or drunk. And yes underlying {{all of this is}} sexism and mysongony [...] which proves that not only <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>not</b> get equal pay but we are still treated like heretics if we step out of line and think outside the box! Sexism is alive and kicking but i am #livingforlove." ...|$|E

500|$|Chapter VI {{begins by}} saying the next three {{chapters}} will address possible objections to the theory, the first being that often no intermediate forms between closely related species are found, though the theory implies such forms must have existed. As Darwin noted, [...] "Firstly, why, if species have descended from other species by insensibly fine gradations, <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>not</b> everywhere see innumerable transitional forms? [...] Why is not all nature in confusion, instead of the species being, as we see them, well defined?" [...] Darwin attributed this to the competition between different forms, combined with {{the small number of}} individuals of intermediate forms, often leading to extinction of such forms. This difficulty can be referred to as the absence or rarity of transitional varieties in habitat space.|$|E
500|$|The speech Big Gay Al gave {{while taking}} Stan {{on a boat}} ride through his animal {{sanctuary}} were based on actual speeches animation director Eric Stough made {{while working as a}} [...] "jungle cruise director" [...] at the Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando, Florida. The dirt smudges on the football player's helmets and uniforms were intentionally designed to look like smudges on construction paper. This was done to maintain the show's deliberately crude visual style they first created with construction paper in [...] "The Spirit of Christmas" [...] and the pilot episode, [...] "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe". The characters Butters Stotch and Clyde Donovan are featured during the football game, although neither had been identified by name yet in the series. During a football crowd scene, a white character can be seen that looks identical to Token Black, an African-American character introduced later in the series. The background character is wearing the same shirt Token wears, which Parker explained was the result of an animator placing a different head on the body {{in order to create a}} filler character for the crowd. The moment when Big Gay Al says, [...] "My work here is done" [...] and disappears into a suitcase is Stone's favorite part of the episode, even though he admitted, [...] "It makes no sense". Parker said that the moment was written that way simply because the duo could not decide how to [...] "get rid of" [...] the character. Parker said, [...] "We didn't want him around all the time, (so we asked) how <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>not</b> make him a character each week".|$|E

2500|$|When the {{contents}} of Article 44 were put to Pope Pius XI by Cardinal Eugenio Pacelli (then Cardinal Secretary of State, later Pope Pius XII), the pope stated in diplomatic language: [...] "We do not approve, nor <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>not</b> disapprove – we will remain silent". It was said that the Vatican was privately more appreciative of the constitution, and Pius XII later praised it.|$|E

2500|$|... "This sounds simple: <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>not</b> already sing {{our love}} for and {{obligation}} {{to the land of}} the free and the home of the brave? Yes, but just what and whom do we love? Certainly not the soil, which we are sending helter-skelter down river. Certainly not the waters, which we assume have no function except to turn turbines, float barges, and carry off sewage. Certainly not the plants, of which we exterminate whole communities without batting an eye. Certainly not the animals, of which we have already extirpated many of the largest and most beautiful species. A land ethic of course cannot prevent the alteration, management, and use of these ‘resources,’ but it does affirm their right to continued existence, and, at least in spots, their continued existence in a natural state. In short, a land ethic changes the role of Homo sapiens from conqueror of the land-community to plain member and citizen of it. It implies respect for his fellow-members, and also respect for the community as such." ...|$|E
