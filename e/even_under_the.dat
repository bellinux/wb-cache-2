5|$|Fifteen months later, Heinrich Olbers {{discovered}} a second {{object in the}} same region, Pallas.

5|$|At Whitsun in 1189, Coutances was {{a member}} of a {{commission}} appointed by the papal legate John of Anagni to arbitrate the dispute between King Henry II of England and his son, Richard, who was supported by King Philip II of France. Henry and Richard's conflict stemmed from Richard's desire to secure his inheritance to the throne of England, which he believed his father was trying to give to his youngest brother, John. The commission met near Le Mans. Richard and Philip insisted that Richard should be married to Philip's sister Alice, that Henry name Richard as Henry's heir, and that Richard's youngest brother John should go on crusade with Richard. Henry rejected those terms, and neither Philip nor Richard would negotiate, <b>even</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> legate's threat of an interdict on France.|$|E
5|$|Diệm's regime had {{announced}} that 5,335,668 people were eligible to vote, {{but when the}} results were declared, there were 5,784,752 ballots. Diệm's government claimed his candidacy had been endorsed by the mother of Bảo Đại, although Diệm had ordered the military to confiscate her family's property and evict her from the land. The near unanimous voter turnout and support for Diệm was replicated in highland and Mekong Delta swamp areas, which were not <b>even</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> {{control of the government}} and its Vietnamese National Army. In some districts of the Mekong Delta, overwhelming tallies for Diệm in excess of 90% of the registered voters were recorded, even though the Hòa Hảo warlord Ba Cụt and his army had prevented voting.|$|E

5|$|Feletti faced a court trial {{under the}} code of laws in effect in Bologna {{at the time of}} Edgardo's removal. Carboni {{proposed}} that <b>even</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> pontifical laws, the seizure was illegal—he reported that he had seen no evidence to support the friar's claim that he had acted following instructions from Rome, and that there was substantial evidence casting doubt on Morisi's account, but so far as he could see Feletti had done nothing to verify what she had said before ordering the child removed. After Feletti refused to appoint a defence counsel when prompted, saying he was putting his defence in the hands of God and the Virgin Mary, the experienced Bologna lawyer Francesco Jussi was appointed by the state to defend him.|$|E
5|$|Habitat destruction, such as forest {{clearing}} {{for commercial}} logging, agriculture space, and residential areas, {{is the most}} detrimental activity {{on the distribution of}} these rabbits. Since they prefer a habitat of both mature and young forests, they do not thrive in only mature forests untouched by destruction, yet they do not thrive in newly growing forests alone, either. There are plans to remove current habitat for these rabbits for the construction of golf courses and resorts, which is allowed because it will not directly be killing the rabbit, just changing the environment where it dwells, which is legal <b>even</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> protection of the special natural monument status.|$|E
5|$|In 1918, Kheda {{was hit by}} {{floods and}} famine and the {{peasantry}} was demanding relief from taxes. Gandhi moved his headquarters to Nadiad, organising scores of supporters and fresh volunteers from the region, the most notable being Vallabhbhai Patel. Using non-co-operation as a technique, Gandhi initiated a signature campaign where peasants pledged non-payment of revenue <b>even</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> threat of confiscation of land. A social boycott of mamlatdars and talatdars (revenue officials within the district) accompanied the agitation. Gandhi worked hard to win {{public support for the}} agitation across the country. For five months, the administration refused but finally in end-May 1918, the Government gave way on important provisions and relaxed the conditions of payment of revenue tax until the famine ended. In Kheda, Vallabhbhai Patel represented the farmers in negotiations with the British, who suspended revenue collection and released all the prisoners.|$|E

5|$|Jurisdiction over {{charitable}} disputes {{is shared}} equally between the High Court of Justice and the Charity Commission. The Commission, the first port of call, is tasked with regulating and promoting charitable trusts, {{as well as}} providing advice and opinions to trustees on administrative matters. Where the Commission feels there has been mismanagement or maladministration, it can sanction the trustees, removing them, appointing new ones or temporarily taking the trust property itself to prevent harm being done. Where there are flaws with a charity, the High Court can administer schemes directing the function of the charity, or <b>even,</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> Cy-près doctrine, change the purpose of the charity or gift altogether.|$|E

25|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{assimilate}} the Jews into Russia’s economy, Catherine included them under the rights and laws of the Charter of the Towns of 1782.

25|$|In {{the ancient}} world, Greek {{had been the}} primary {{language}} of science. <b>Even</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> Roman Empire, Latin texts drew extensively on Greek work, some pre-Roman, some contemporary; while advanced scientific research and teaching continued to be carried on in the Hellenistic side of the empire, in Greek.

25|$|After the {{establishment}} in the 1880s {{that the disease}} was contagious, TB was made a notifiable disease in Britain; there were campaigns to stop spitting in public places, and the infected poor were pressured to enter sanatoria that resembled prisons; the sanatoria for {{the middle and upper}} classes offered excellent care and constant medical attention. Whatever the purported benefits of the fresh air and labor in the sanatoria, <b>even</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> best conditions, 50% of those who entered were dead within five years (1916).|$|E
25|$|Throughout its history, {{even during}} the times of {{partition}} and under the communist regime, Polish sociology {{was influenced by the}} developments of the theory in the West. Some Poles were the International Sociological Association’s officers: Jan Szczepański was president (1966-1970), Stanisław Ossowski vice-president (1959-1962), and Magdalena Sokołowska vice-president (1978-1982). The Polish Sociological Association was also relatively independent. <b>Even</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> communist regime, the freedom of Polish academics seemed to have been greater than in other communist countries, and thus Polish academics often spread Western ideas among their colleagues in the East and South.|$|E
25|$|Although {{it resembles}} a vacuum tube in appearance, its {{operation}} {{does not depend}} on thermionic emission of electrons from a heated cathode. It is therefore called a cold-cathode tube (a form of gas-filled tube), and is a variant of the neon lamp. Such tubes rarely exceed 40°C (104°F) <b>even</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> most severe of operating conditions in a room at ambient temperature. Vacuum fluorescent displays from the same era use completely different technology—they have a heated cathode together with a control grid and shaped phosphor anodes; Nixies have no heater or control grid, typically a single anode (in the form of a wire mesh, {{not to be confused with}} a control grid), and shaped bare metal cathodes.|$|E

25|$|South Asian {{martial arts}} {{underwent}} {{a period of}} decline after the full establishment of British colonial rule in the 19th century. More European modes of organizing kings, armies and governmental institutions, and {{the increasing use of}} firearms, gradually eroded the need for traditional combat training associated with caste-specific duties. The British colonial government banned kalaripayat in 1804 in response to a series of revolts. Silambam was also banned and became more common in the Malay Peninsula than its native Tamil Nadu. Nevertheless, traditional fighting systems persisted, sometimes <b>even</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> patronage of enthusiastic British spectators who tended to remark on the violence of native boxing and the acrobatic movements characteristic of South Asian fighting styles.|$|E
25|$|These events {{heightened}} Confederate support {{within the}} state. Governor Jackson appointed Sterling Price, {{president of the}} convention on secession, {{as head of the}} new Missouri State Guard. In the face of Union General Lyon's rapid advance through the state, Jackson and Price were forced to flee the capital of Jefferson City on June 14, 1861. In the town of Neosho, Missouri, Jackson called the state legislature into session. They enacted a secession ordinance. However, <b>even</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> Southern view of secession, only the state convention had the power to secede. Since the convention was dominated by unionists, and the state was more pro-Union than pro-Confederate in any event, the ordinance of secession adopted by the legislature is generally given little credence. The Confederacy nonetheless recognized it on October 30, 1861.|$|E
25|$|A {{constitutional}} amendment effecting greater decentralization was voted upon and approved in the Chambers of Deputies, {{but it still}} faced major opposition in the Senate. The priest Antônio Feijó planned a coup d’état {{in which he would}} assume dictatorial powers and the {{constitutional amendment}} would be enacted concurrently without the approval of the National Assembly (Parliament). On 30 July 1832 some Nativist deputies (in concert with Feijó) put a proposal before the Chamber that parliament be turned into a constituent assembly and that a new constitution be adopted using as part of their argument that the senate was filled with restorationist senators. The Deputy Carneiro Leão managed to successfully rally the other deputies against the Nativists' proposal and the coup attempt was crushed. The Coimbra bloc's firm actions prevented restriction of legal rights and kept Brazil from sliding into dictatorship during the regency <b>even</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> threat of rebellions and political crises.|$|E
