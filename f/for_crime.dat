5|$|In 1984, state Sen. Joseph F. Timilty {{resigned}} his Norfolk and Suffolk seat {{to pursue}} a career in private law, and Keating became the only major Democratic contender for the office.

Keating focused his campaign on expanding resources <b>for</b> <b>crime</b> prevention and education, tailoring his message to the Boston constituency he would pick up as a senator.

After the grant was established, GANO, the Shenandoah Civic Association, and GARC worked together to reduce juvenile crime. In 1995, Nelson Reyes, a counselor for immigrants from Mexico and El Salvador at the Gulfton Area Neighborhood Organization, said that local parents had positive attitudes about living in Gulfton as they made more money {{than they did in}} their home countries, but Gulfton-area children felt impacted by the area crime.|$|E

5|$|Josef von Sternberg was {{directing}} in Hollywood at {{the same}} time. Films of his such as Shanghai Express (1932) and The Devil Is a Woman (1935), with their hothouse eroticism and baroque visual style, anticipated central elements of classic noir. The commercial and critical success of Sternberg's silent Underworld (1927) was largely responsible for spurring a trend of Hollywood gangster films. Successful films in that genre such as Little Caesar (1931), The Public Enemy (1931) and Scarface (1932) demonstrated {{that there was an}} audience <b>for</b> <b>crime</b> dramas with morally reprehensible protagonists. An important, possibly influential, cinematic antecedent to classic noir was 1930s French poetic realism, with its romantic, fatalistic attitude and celebration of doomed heroes. The movement's sensibility is mirrored in the Warner Bros. drama I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang (1932), a forerunner of noir. Among films not considered films noir, perhaps none had a greater effect {{on the development of the}} genre than Citizen Kane (1941), directed by Orson Welles. Its visual intricacy and complex, voiceover narrative structure are echoed in dozens of classic films noir.|$|E
