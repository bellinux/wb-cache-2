It is proved that a set of optimal control problems is not empty, it is weakly compact and every minimizing sequence of the functional goals converges weakly in the space of controls to the set of optimal controls. The examples show that the solution of the problem can be not unique and minimizing sequence for the functional purpose can not have a limit in the strong topology of space management.

40|$|The total {{variation}} (TV) {{model is}} one of the most successful methods for image restoration, as well as an ideal bed to develop optimization algorithms for solving sparse representation problems. Previous studies showed that <b>derivative</b> <b>space</b> formulation of the image restoration model is useful in improving the success rate in image recovery and kernel estimation performance in blind deconvolution. However, little attentions are paid on the model and algorithm for <b>derivative</b> <b>space</b> based image restoration. In this paper, we study the TV based image restoration (TVIR) by developing a novel derivative space-based reformulation together with an efficient derivative alternating direction method of multipliers (D-ADMM) algorithm.

40|$|Abstract. The second order {{accurate}} Lax-Wendro {{scheme is}} based on the rst three terms of a Taylor expansion in time in which the time derivatives are replaced by <b>space</b> <b>derivatives</b> using the governing evolution equations. The <b>space</b> <b>derivatives</b> are then ap-proximated by central dierence formulas. In this paper we extent this idea and truncate the Taylor expansion at an arbitrary even order. We use then the so called Cauchy-Kovalevskaya procedure to replace all the time <b>derivatives</b> by <b>space</b> <b>derivatives.</b> The linear case is the main focus of this paper, because the proposed high order schemes are good candidates for the approximation of linear wave motion over long distances and times with the important applications in aeroacoustics and electromagnetics. We formulate the scheme for a general system of linear equations with arbitrary order and in two or three space dimensions. The numerical results are compared with a standard scheme for aeroacoustical applications with respect to their quality and the computational eort. ...|$|R

Here we introduce a unified variational framework that ties together the problems of downscaling, data fusion, and data assimilation as ill-posed inverse problems. This framework seeks solutions beyond the classic least squares estimation paradigms by imposing a proper regularization, expressed as a constraint consistent with the degree of smoothness and/or probabilistic structure of the underlying state. We review relevant smoothing norm regularization methods in <b>derivative</b> <b>space</b> and extend classic formulations of the aforementioned problems with particular emphasis on land surface hydrometeorological applications. Our results demonstrate that proper regularization of downscaling, data fusion, and data assimilation problems can lead to more accurate and stable recovery of the underlying non-Gaussian state of interest with improved performance in capturing isolated and jump singularities. In particular, we show that the Huber regularization in the <b>derivative</b> <b>space</b> offers advantages, compared to the classic solution and the Tikhonov regularization, for spatial downscaling and fusion of non-Gaussian multisensor precipitation data.
