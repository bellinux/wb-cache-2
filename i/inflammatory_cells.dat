5|$|COPD {{develops}} as {{a significant}} and chronic inflammatory response to inhaled irritants. Chronic bacterial infections may also add to this inflammatory state. The <b>inflammatory</b> <b>cells</b> involved include neutrophil granulocytes and macrophages, two types of white blood cell. Those who smoke additionally have Tc1 lymphocyte involvement and some people with COPD have eosinophil involvement {{similar to that in}} asthma. Part of this cell response is brought on by inflammatory mediators such as chemotactic factors. Other processes involved with lung damage include oxidative stress produced by high concentrations of free radicals in tobacco smoke and released by <b>inflammatory</b> <b>cells,</b> and breakdown of the connective tissue of the lungs by proteases that are insufficiently inhibited by protease inhibitors. The destruction of the connective tissue of the lungs is what leads to emphysema, which then contributes to the poor airflow and, finally, poor absorption and release of respiratory gases. General muscle wasting that often occurs in COPD may be partly due to inflammatory mediators released by the lungs into the blood.|$|E
5|$|Inflammation is {{a normal}} part of the human immune response, whereby leukocytes (white blood cells), {{including}} neutrophils (white blood cells that specialize in causing inflammation), gather, and chemokines (proteins released from certain cells, which activate or elicit a response from other cells) accumulate at any location in the body where bacterial or viral infections occur. Inflammation interferes with the activity of bacteria and viruses, and serves to clear them from the body. In DPB, bacteria such as Haemophilus influenzae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa can cause the proliferation of <b>inflammatory</b> <b>cells</b> into the bronchiolar tissues. However, when neither bacteria are present with DPB, the inflammation continues for an as yet unknown reason. In either circumstance, inflammation in DPB can be so severe that nodules containing <b>inflammatory</b> <b>cells</b> form in the walls of the bronchioles. The presence of inflammation and infection in the airways also results in the production of excess mucus, which must be coughed up as sputum. The combination of inflammation, nodule development, infection, mucus, and frequent cough contributes to the breathing difficulties in DPB.|$|E
5|$|During HBV infection, {{the host}} immune {{response}} causes both hepatocellular damage and viral clearance. Although the innate immune response does {{not play a}} significant role in these processes, the adaptive immune response, in particular virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes(CTLs), contributes to most of the liver injury associated with HBV infection. CTLs eliminate HBV infection by killing infected cells and producing antiviral cytokines, which are then used to purge HBV from viable hepatocytes. Although liver damage is initiated and mediated by the CTLs, antigen-nonspecific <b>inflammatory</b> <b>cells</b> can worsen CTL-induced immunopathology, and platelets activated at the site of infection may facilitate the accumulation of CTLs in the liver.|$|E
30|$|Lung {{sections}} were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. All lung fields at × 200 magnification were examined for each sample. Assessment of histological lung injury was performed as follows: 1 [*]=[*]normal; 2 [*]=[*]focal (< 50 % lung section) interstitial congestion and <b>inflammatory</b> <b>cell</b> infiltration; 3 [*]=[*]diffuse (> 50 % lung section) interstitial congestion and <b>inflammatory</b> <b>cell</b> infiltration; 4 [*]=[*]focal (< 50 % lung section) consolidation and <b>inflammatory</b> <b>cell</b> infiltration; 5 [*]=[*]diffuse (> 50 % lung section) consolidation and <b>inflammatory</b> <b>cell</b> infiltration [22].|$|R
30|$|In {{pathological}} {{findings of}} our case, prominent <b>inflammatory</b> <b>cell</b> infiltration was characteristic. To our knowledge, {{there are no}} reports describing marked <b>inflammatory</b> <b>cell</b> infiltration within CoCC. The reason why marked <b>inflammatory</b> <b>cell</b> infiltration occurred in our case remains unclear. However, recent studies have revealed that CoCC is a distinct molecular entity compared with other HPC-derived liver tumors, as determined by gene profiling analysis, and also revealed that CoCC shows significant upregulation of TGF-beta signaling and inflammatory and immune response signatures, such as interleukin- 6, TNF-α, and chemokines and their receptors, which are known as factors of angiogenesis and <b>inflammatory</b> <b>cell</b> infiltration into the tumor [23]. These findings suggest that CoCC {{is likely to be}} closely related to angiogenesis and inflammation. If this hypothesis is correct, prominent <b>inflammatory</b> <b>cell</b> infiltration and vascular proliferation of our case can be explained. However, further study will be required to elucidate the significance of upregulation of such genes.|$|R
40|$|<b>Inflammatory</b> <b>cell</b> {{counting}} in endoscopic biopsy sections {{was carried}} out on duodenal mucosal samples from defined sites in patients with duodenal ulcer, duodenitis but no ulcer, non-ulcer dyspepsia, and asymptomatic controls using computer linked image analysis. The variables measured included polymorphonuclear and mononuclear cells per mm of superficial epithelium and per mm 2 lamina propria. Duodenal ulcer crater margin and mucosal biopsy specimens from endoscopically inflamed mucosa in the group with duodenitis but no ulcer showed significantly higher <b>inflammatory</b> <b>cell</b> counts than endoscopically normal non-ulcer dyspepsia and control mucosa. Biopsy specimens from non-ulcer dyspepsia patients showed significantly higher lamina propria polymorphs than control group mucosa. Endoscopically normal duodenal ulcer and duodenitis but no ulcer mucosa also showed significantly higher acute and chronic <b>inflammatory</b> <b>cell</b> counts than controls. The prevalence of Helicobacter pylori in duodenal biopsy specimens was low (0 - 22 %) and unrelated to local inflammatory response. Despite histological appearances, duodenal biopsy specimens from non-ulcer dyspepsia patients showed significantly higher <b>inflammatory</b> <b>cell</b> infiltration than control specimens, suggesting {{that at least some}} represent part of a spectrum of subclinical peptic disease...|$|R
5|$|In {{the earlier}} {{stages of the}} disease, the biopsy {{typically}} shows steatosis (deposition of fatty material), increased glycogen in the nucleus, and areas of necrosis (cell death). In more advanced disease, the changes observed are quite similar to those seen in autoimmune hepatitis, such as infiltration by <b>inflammatory</b> <b>cells,</b> piecemeal necrosis and fibrosis (scar tissue). In advanced disease, finally, cirrhosis is the main finding. In acute liver failure, degeneration of the liver cells and collapse of the liver tissue architecture is seen, typically on a background of cirrhotic changes. Histochemical methods for detecting copper are inconsistent and unreliable, and taken alone are regarded as insufficient to establish a diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|The {{fact that}} {{inflammation}} in DPB persists {{with or without}} the presence of P.aeruginosa and H.influenzae provides a means to determine several mechanisms of DPB pathogenesis. Leukotrienes are eicosanoids, signaling molecules made from essential fatty acids, which play a role in many lung diseases by causing the proliferation of <b>inflammatory</b> <b>cells</b> and excess mucus production in the airways. In DPB and other lung diseases, the predominant mediator of neutrophil-related inflammation is leukotriene B4, which specializes in neutrophil proliferation via chemotaxis (the movement of some types of cells toward or away from certain molecules).|$|E
25|$|Immediately after a {{blood vessel}} is breached, {{ruptured}} cell membranes release inflammatory factors like thromboxanes and prostaglandins {{that cause the}} vessel to spasm to prevent blood loss and to collect <b>inflammatory</b> <b>cells</b> and factors in the area. This vasoconstriction lasts five to ten minutes and is followed by vasodilation, a widening of blood vessels, which peaks at about 20 minutes post-wounding. Vasodilation is {{the end result of}} factors released by platelets and other cells. The main factor involved in causing vasodilation is histamine. Histamine also causes blood vessels to become porous, allowing the tissue to become edematous because proteins from the bloodstream leak into the extravascular space, which increases its osmolar load and draws water into the area. Increased porosity of blood vessels also facilitates the entry of <b>inflammatory</b> <b>cells</b> like leukocytes into the wound site from the bloodstream.|$|E

40|$|Background: The tumor-associated <b>inflammatory</b> <b>cell</b> {{infiltrate}} {{is recognized}} to have prognostic value in various common solid tumors. However, the prognostic {{value of the}} tumor <b>inflammatory</b> <b>cell</b> infiltrate has not been established in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) nor has {{its relationship with the}} systemic inflammatory response. Methods: Retrospective study was made of 173 patients who underwent surgery between 1997 and 2009. Routine pathology specimens were scored according to density of the tumor <b>inflammatory</b> <b>cell</b> infiltrate, and biochemical data were collected preoperatively. Results: Low-grade tumor <b>inflammatory</b> <b>cell</b> infiltrate was associated with earlier tumor recurrence (P &# 60;  0. 001) and particularly in the liver (P =  0. 027). It was also associated with T 3 tumors (P &# 60;  0. 05), lymph node involvement (P &# 60;  0. 05), and resection margin involvement (P &# 60;  0. 05).

25|$|In this pattern, {{hepatocellular}} necrosis {{is associated with}} infiltration of <b>inflammatory</b> <b>cells.</b> There can be three types of drug-induced hepatitis. (A) viral hepatitis is the most common, where histological features are similar to acute viral hepatitis.

40|$|Bronchial biopsy {{specimens}} {{from chronic}} obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients demonstrate increased numbers of CD 8 + T-lymphocytes, macrophages and, in some studies, neutrophils and eosinophils. Smoking cessation affects {{the rate of}} forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV(1)) decline in COPD, but the effect on inflammation is uncertain. Bronchial biopsy <b>inflammatory</b> <b>cell</b> counts were compared in current and ex-smokers with COPD. A pooled analysis of subepithelial <b>inflammatory</b> <b>cell</b> count data from three bronchial biopsy studies that included COPD patients who were either current or ex-smokers was performed. Cell count data from 101 subjects, 65 current smokers and 36 ex-smokers, were analysed for the following cell types: CD 4 + and CD 8 + T-lymphocytes, CD 68 + (monocytes/macrophages), neutrophil elastase+ (neutrophils), EG 2 + (eosinophils), mast cell tryptase+ and cells mRNA-positive for tumour necrosis factor-alpha. Current smokers and ex-smokers were similar in terms of lung function, as measured by FEV(1) (% predicted), forced vital capacity (FVC) and FEV(1) /FVC. The results demonstrate that {{there were no significant differences}} between smokers and ex-smokers in the numbers of any of the <b>inflammatory</b> <b>cell</b> types or markers analysed.

30|$|In {{the present}} study, the mice model of SSc was {{established}} by subcutaneous injection of BLM. Consistent with previous studies (Yamamoto and Nishioka 2002; Yamamoto et al. 1999), we could observe {{the destruction of the}} structure of skin and lung tissues, such as disordered structure, increased <b>inflammatory</b> <b>cell</b> infiltration, collagen deposition, significant skin and pulmonary fibrosis in mice from the model group at different time points. Furthermore, studies confirmed that the skin and lung tissues of SSc mice exhibited increased <b>inflammatory</b> <b>cell</b> filtration and upregulation of TGF-β 1 expression at the early stage (Bienkowski and Gotkin 1995; Bonniaud et al. 2005).

40|$|Enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) is {{a highly}} {{pathogenic}} bacterial strain capable of inducing severe gastrointestinal disease. Here, we show that EHEC uses the T 3 SS effector NleF to counteract the host inflammatory response by dampening caspase- 4 -mediated <b>inflammatory</b> epithelial <b>cell</b> death and by preventing the production of IL- 1 β. The other two inflammatory caspases, caspase- 1 and caspase- 5, {{are not involved in}} EHEC ΔnleF-induced <b>inflammatory</b> <b>cell</b> death. We found that NleF not only interrupted the heterodimerization of caspase- 4 -p 19 and caspase- 4 -p 10, but also inhibited the interaction of caspase- 1 and caspase- 4.

25|$|They {{primarily}} {{deal with}} parasitic infections. Eosinophils {{are also the}} predominant <b>inflammatory</b> <b>cells</b> in allergic reactions. The most important causes of eosinophilia include allergies such as asthma, hay fever, and hives; and also parasitic infections. They secrete chemicals that destroy these large parasites, such as hook worms and tapeworms, that are too big for any one WBC to phagocytize. In general, their nucleus is bi-lobed. The lobes are connected by a thin strand. The cytoplasm is full of granules that assume a characteristic pink-orange color with eosin staining.|$|E
40|$|Infiltration of leukocytes into premalignant {{tissue is}} a common feature of many {{epithelial}} neoplasms and is thought to contribute to cancer development. However, the molecular and cellular regulatory mechanisms underlying activation of innate host responses to enhanced neoplastic cell proliferation are largely unknown.

Whereas abundant deposition of C 3 is a characteristic feature of premalignant hyperplasias and dysplasias coincident with leukocyte infiltration in neoplastic tissue, genetic elimination of C 3 neither affects <b>inflammatory</b> <b>cell</b> recruitment toward neoplastic skin nor impacts responding pathways downstream of <b>inflammatory</b> <b>cell</b> activation, e. g., keratinocyte hyperproliferation or angiogenesis.

40|$|Tumour {{necrosis}} factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin 1 β (IL- 1 β) {{have been}} implicated in the pathogenesis of asthma. The p 38 kinase inhibitor, SB 203580 inhibits TNF-α and IL- 1 β production in vitro and in vivo. In this study the effect of SB 203580 on allergen-induced airway TNF-α production and <b>inflammatory</b> <b>cell</b> recruitment was investigated in sensitized Brown Norway rats. The allergen-induced increase in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) TNF-α was inhibited by SB 203580 at every dose tested (10 – 100 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, p. o.). In contrast, neither ovalbumin-induced eosinophilia or neutrophilia were inhibited by SB 203580 (10 – 100 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, p. o.). In conclusion, SB 203580 inhibits BAL TNF-α production by 95 % without inhibiting either antigen-induced airway eosinophilia or neutrophilia. This data suggests that either the residual TNF-α is sufficent to drive allergen-induced <b>inflammatory</b> <b>cell</b> recruitment into the lung or that TNF-α {{is not involved in}} allergen-induced <b>inflammatory</b> <b>cell</b> recruitment...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Pathological and {{metabolic}} alterations co-exist and co-develop in {{the progression}} of chronic pancreatitis (CP). The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate the metabolic char-acteristics and disease severity of a rat model of CP in order to determine associations in the observed pathology and the metabolites of CP using high-resolution magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (HR-MAS NMR). Wistar rats (n= 36) were randomly assigned into 6 groups (n= 6 per group). CP was established by administering dibutyltin dichloride solution into the tail vein. After 0, 7, 14, 21, 28 and 35 days, the pancreatic tissues were collected for pathological scoring or for HR-MAS NMR. Correlation analyses between the major pathological scores and the integral areas of the major metabolites were determined. The most representative metabolites, aspartate, betaine and fatty acids, were identified as possessing the greatest discriminatory significance. The Spearman's rank correlation coefficients between the pathology and metabolites of the pancreatic tissues were as follows: Betaine and fibrosis, 0. 454 (P= 0. 044); betaine and inflamma-tory cell infiltration, 0. 716 (P= 0. 0001); aspartate and fibrosis, ‑ 0. 768 (P= 0. 0001); aspartate and <b>inflammatory</b> <b>cell</b> infiltration, ‑ 0. 394 (P= 0. 085); fatty acid and fibrosis, ‑ 0. 764 (P= 0. 0001); and fatty acid and <b>inflammatory</b> <b>cell</b> infiltration, ‑ 0. 619 (P= 0. 004). The metabolite betaine positively correlated with fibrosis and <b>inflammatory</b> <b>cell</b> infiltration in CP. In addition, aspartate negatively correlated with fibrosis, but exhibited no significant correlation with <b>inflammatory</b> <b>cell</b> infiltration. Furthermore, the presence of fatty acids negatively correlated with fibrosis and <b>inflammatory</b> <b>cell</b> infiltration in CP. HR-MAS NMR may be used to analyze metabolic characteristics in a rat model of different degrees of chronic pancreatitis...|$|R
25|$|Vasospasm, {{referring}} to blood vessel constriction, can occur secondary to subarachnoid hemorrhage following a ruptured aneurysm. This {{is most likely}} to occur within 21 days and is seen radiologically within 60% of such patients. The vasospasm is thought to be secondary to the apoptosis of <b>inflammatory</b> <b>cells</b> such as macrophages and neutrophils that become trapped in the subarachnoid space. These cells initially invade the subarachnoid space from the circulation in order to phagocytose the hemorrhaged red blood cells. Following apoptosis, it is thought there is a massive degranulation of vasoconstrictors, including endothelins and free radicals, that cause the vasospasm.|$|E
25|$|Biopsies of the mucosa {{are taken}} to {{definitively}} diagnose UC and differentiate it from Crohn's disease, which is managed differently clinically. Microbiological samples are typically taken {{at the time of}} endoscopy. The pathology in ulcerative colitis typically involves distortion of crypt architecture, inflammation of crypts (cryptitis), frank crypt abscesses, and hemorrhage or <b>inflammatory</b> <b>cells</b> in the lamina propria. In cases where the clinical picture is unclear, the histomorphologic analysis often plays a pivotal role in determining the diagnosis and thus the management. By contrast, a biopsy analysis may be indeterminate, and thus the clinical progression of the disease must inform its treatment.|$|E
25|$|Intrinsic factors {{refer to}} injury {{mechanisms}} that occur within the rotator cuff itself. The principal is a degenerative-microtrauma model, which supposes that age-related tendon damage compounded by chronic microtrauma results in partial tendon tears that then develop into full rotator cuff tears. As {{a result of}} repetitive microtrauma {{in the setting of}} a degenerative rotator cuff tendon, inflammatory mediators alter the local environment, and oxidative stress induces tenocyte apoptosis causing further rotator cuff tendon degeneration. A neural theory also exists that suggests neural overstimulation leads to the recruitment of <b>inflammatory</b> <b>cells</b> and may also contribute to tendon degeneration.|$|E

50|$|Hyperplastic {{candidiasis}} is variable. Usually {{there is}} hyperplastic and acanthotic epithelium with parakeratosis. There is an <b>inflammatory</b> <b>cell</b> infiltrate and hyphae are visible. Unlike {{other forms of}} candidiasis, hyperplastic candidiasis may show dysplasia.|$|R
25|$|There are {{hypersensitivity}} responses, both a type I response (atopic, with {{formation of}} immunoglobulin E, or IgE) and a type III hypersensitivity response (with formation of immunoglobulin G, or IgG). The reaction of IgE with Aspergillus antigens results in mast cell degranulation with bronchoconstriction and increased capillary permeability. Immune complexes (a type III reaction) and <b>inflammatory</b> <b>cells</b> are deposited within the mucous membranes of the airways, leading to necrosis (tissue death) and eosinophilic infiltration. Type 2 T helper cells appear {{to play an}} important role in ABPA due to an increased sensitivity to interleukin (IL) 4 and IL-5.

25|$|The {{tertiary}} butyl {{group in}} salbutamol {{makes it more}} selective for β2 receptors, which are the predominant receptors on the bronchial smooth muscles. Activation of these receptors causes adenylyl cyclase to convert ATP to cAMP, beginning the signalling cascade that ends with the inhibition of myosin phosphorylation and lowering the intracellular concentration of calcium ions (myosin phosphorylation and calcium ions are necessary for muscle contractions). The increase in cAMP also inhibits <b>inflammatory</b> <b>cells</b> in the airway, such as basophils, eosinophils, and most especially mast cells, from releasing inflammatory mediators and cytokines. Salbutamol and other β2 receptor agonists also increase the conductance of channels sensitive to calcium and potassium ions, leading to hyperpolarization and relaxation of bronchial smooth muscles.|$|E
25|$|Lp(a) is {{assembled}} at the hepatocyte {{cell membrane}} surface, while other scenarios exist {{with regard to}} the location of assembly. It mainly exists in plasma. Lp(a) contributes to the process of atherogenesis.

It may also enhance coagulation by inhibiting the function of tissue factor pathway inhibitor. Lp(a) carries cholesterol and binds atherogenic proinflammatory oxidized phospholipids as a preferential carrier of oxidized phospholipids in human plasma, which attract <b>inflammatory</b> <b>cells</b> to vessel walls and leads to smooth muscle cell proliferation. Moreover, Lp(a) is also hypothesized to be involved in wound healing and tissue repair, interacting with components of the vascular wall and extra cellular matrix.

40|$|Background: Vascular proliferation, {{inflammation}} and epidermal changes are important {{features in the}} pathogenesis of psoriasis. Aims: In this study we attempted an objective evaluation of these parameters using morphometry. Methods: Inflammation, microvessels and epidermal parameters were assessed in 50 newly diagnosed cases of psoriasis vulgaris (between 01 Nov 2008 and 31 Oct 2011) by morphometry. Parameters studied were microvessel density, microvessel caliber, <b>inflammatory</b> <b>cell</b> density in dermis, ratio between inner and outer epidermal length, maximum epidermal thickness, minimum epidermal thickness and difference between maximum epidermal thickness and minimum epidermal thickness. Results: Microvessel caliber showed moderate correlation (r = 0. 645) and microvessel density, weak correlation (r = 0. 226) with <b>inflammatory</b> <b>cell</b> density in dermis. Both these parameters also showed mild positive correlation with "ratio between inner and outer epidermal length". All parameters except minimum epidermal thickness showed mild positive correlation with <b>inflammatory</b> <b>cell</b> density in dermis. Conclusion: All microvessels and epidermal parameters showed positive correlation with dermal inflammation; and epidermal parameters exhibited positive correlation with micro-vascular dilation. It is likely that inflammation is {{a key factor in}} the pathogenesis of psoriasis...|$|R
40|$|AIMS: This study {{evaluated}} {{the role of}} cyclophilin A (CyPA) in early phase of atherosclerosis and also examined the atheroprotective effects of melatonin due to its antioxidant properties. MAIN METHODS: APOE null mice at 6 and 15 weeks of age were treated with melatonin at a dose of 0. 1 mg/kg/day or 10 mg/kg/day. We evaluated both histopathological alterations in endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells by CyPA and rolling mononuclear cell expression during the early phase of atherosclerosis development. KEY FINDINGS: Our study showed that CyPA expression increases and may modulate <b>inflammatory</b> <b>cell</b> adhesion and interleukin- 6 expression inducing vascular smooth muscle <b>cell</b> migration and <b>inflammatory</b> <b>cell</b> extravasation in a time-dependent manner. Moreover, we observed an indirect atheroprotective effect of melatonin on vascular injury; it inhibited CyPA mediated <b>inflammatory</b> <b>cell</b> extravasation and oxidative stress. SIGNIFICANCE: The melatonin treatment may represent a new atheroprotective approach that contributes to reducing the early phase of atherosclerosis involving the rolling of monocytes, their passage to subendothelial space and inhibition of CyPA expression...|$|R
