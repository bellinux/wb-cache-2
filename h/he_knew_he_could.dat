5|$|Geoffrey Rush as Captain Hector Barbossa: The {{captain of}} the Black Pearl, since taken over from Sparrow. Barbossa and his crew suffer a curse from Aztec gold that makes them a team of living-dead. Verbinski {{approached}} Rush {{for the role of}} Barbossa, as <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> hint at the subtle complexities of the character while still portraying a simple villainy that would suit the story's tone.|$|E
25|$|After the war, Doohan {{moved to}} London, Ontario for further {{technical}} education. After hearing a radio drama that <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> do better, he recorded his {{voice at the}} local radio station, and learned about a drama school in Toronto. There he won a two-year scholarship to the Neighborhood Playhouse in New York City, where his classmates included Leslie Nielsen, Tony Randall and Richard Boone.|$|E
25|$|In {{much of his}} career, Saionji {{tried to}} {{diminish}} {{the influence of the}} Imperial Japanese Army in political issues. He {{was one of the most}} liberal of Emperor Hirohito's advisors, and favored friendly relations with Great Britain and the United States. However, he was careful to pick his battles, and would concede defeat when <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not win (e.g. his inability to prevent the Tripartite Pact).|$|E
50|$|A 28-year-old English teacher named Tim Schrader {{agrees to}} smuggle 8 kilos of heroin into the U.S. to solve his {{financial}} problems. Although <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> receive the death penalty, {{the money is}} too tempting to resist.|$|R
50|$|Innokentii Volodin, a diplomat, makes a {{telephone}} call he feels obliged by conscience to make, even though <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> be arrested. His call is taped and the NKVD seek to identify who has made the call.|$|R
60|$|And {{still more}} {{secretly}} <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not refuse her.|$|R
25|$|With the {{outbreak}} of the Great War, he was given command of the Home Defence Army, part of Ian Hamilton's Home Defence Central Force. However, following the sudden death of Sir James Grierson, he was placed in charge of the British Expeditionary Force II Corps, by Lord Kitchener, the new Secretary of State for War. Field Marshal Sir John French had wanted Sir Herbert Plumer but Kitchener chose Smith-Dorrien as <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> stand up to French, and in the full knowledge that French disliked him. Kitchener admitted to Smith-Dorrien that he had doubts about appointing him, but put them to one side.|$|E
25|$|The {{circumstance}} of Mr. Rogers having preached at Paul's cross, after Queen Mary {{arrived at}} the Tower, has been already stated. He confirmed in his sermon the true doctrine taught in King Edward's time, and exhorted the people to beware of the pestilence of popery, idolatry, and superstition. For this he was called to account, but so ably defended himself that, for that time, he was dismissed. The proclamation of the queen, however, to prohibit true preaching, gave his enemies a new handle against him. Hence he was again summoned before the council, and commanded to keep to his house. He did so, though he might have escaped; and though he perceived {{the state of the}} true religion to be desperate. <b>He</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not want a living in Germany; and he could not forget a wife and ten children, and to seek means to succor them. But all these things were insufficient to induce him to depart, and, when once called to answer in Christ's cause, he stoutly defended it, and hazarded his life for that purpose.|$|E
500|$|Reid named Donovan McNabb the Eagles' starter for the 2010 season, but McNabb {{was traded}} to the Washington Redskins and Kevin Kolb was named the starter. While relegated to a second-string role, Vick said <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> still play at a high level. Asked if he wanted the Eagles to pick up the second year of his contract, he said, [...] "I hope so...I feel like I'm {{probably}} better than I ever was in my career, as far as the mental aspect of the game." [...] The Eagles exercised his option for 2010 in March and Vick received a $1.5 million roster bonus.|$|E
25|$|No one {{reported}} {{the presence of}} British cruisers to Admiral Hipper until 14:35. Had <b>he</b> <b>known,</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> have brought his own battlecruisers to sea faster and consolidated his fleet, possibly preventing the German losses and instead inflicting some on the departing British ships. The British operation had dragged out longer than anticipated so that the large German ships would have had sufficient high water to join the battle.|$|R
60|$|Kurt hired a {{young man}} <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> to drive him over to Wheatly. All the way Kurt brooded about his father's strange action. The old man had left home before the rain-storm. How did <b>he</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> {{guarantee}} so many bushels of wheat as the selling-price indicated? Kurt divined {{that his father had}} acted upon one of his strange weather prophecies. For he must have been absolutely sure of rain to save the wheat.|$|R
6000|$|... "If it was any one but Belinda, I don't think I {{could stand}} it," [...] exclaimed Phil, {{as he watched}} his lost {{sweetheart}} with wistful eyes; for, though he submitted to the sentence which <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> deserved, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not relinquish so much excellence without deep regret.|$|R
500|$|An {{official}} {{report of}} the Nationalist Government argued that an excess of untrained and inexperienced troops was {{a major cause of}} the defeat, but at the time Tang Shengzhi was made to bear much of the blame and later historians have also criticized him. Japanese historian Tokushi Kasahara, for instance, has characterized his battlefield leadership as incompetent, arguing that an orderly withdrawal from Nanking may have been possible if Tang had carried it out on December 11 or if he had not fled his post well in advance of most of his beleaguered units. However, Chiang's very decision to defend Nanking is also controversial. Masahiro Yamamoto believes that Chiang chose [...] "almost entirely out of emotion" [...] to fight a battle <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> only lose, and fellow historian Frederick Fu Liu concurs that the decision is often regarded as one of [...] "the greatest strategical mistakes of the Sino-Japanese war". Still, the historian Jay Taylor notes that Chiang was convinced that to run from his capital city [...] "without a serious fight ... would forever be regarded as a cowardly decision." ...|$|E
500|$|The Jesuit priest John Gerard {{described}} Keyes as [...] "a {{grave and}} sober man, and of great wit and sufficiency". [...] Father Oswald Tesimond claimed that Keyes had [...] "tasted persecution himself, having lost his goods because of it" [...] while historian and author Cyril Northcote Parkinson's {{image of him}} was of a [...] "desperate man, ruined and indebted". [...] Tall, with a red beard, despite his relative poverty Catesby declared him [...] "a trusty honest man", and may have paid him for his services. [...] Like fellow plotter Guy Fawkes, he was thought capable of looking after himself. [...] Several conspirators expressed concerns {{about the safety of}} fellow Catholics who would be at Parliament {{on the day of the}} planned explosion; Keyes was particularly worried about Lord Mordaunt, his wife's employer. [...] Thomas Percy was concerned for his patron, Henry Percy, 9th Earl of Northumberland, and the Lords Vaux, Montague, Monteagle and Stourton were also mentioned. [...] Keyes's suggestion to warn Lord Mordaunt was treated by Catesby with derision, when he answered that [...] "he would not for the chamber full of diamonds acquaint him with the secret, for that <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not keep it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kearny was outnumbered. <b>He</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not win; {{he ordered}} {{his men to}} take cover on a small hill. On the night of December 8, Carson, a naval {{lieutenant}} named Beale, and an Indian scout left Kearny to bring reinforcements from San Diego, [...] away. Carson and the lieutenant removed their shoes because they made too much noise, and walked barefoot through the desert. Carson wrote in his Memoirs: [...] "Finally got through, but had the misfortune to lose our shoes. Had to travel over a country covered with prickly pear and rocks, barefoot." ...|$|E
60|$|Peter nodded. <b>He</b> <b>knew</b> that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> swim if <b>he</b> had to, {{but only}} for a very little way, and he hated the thought of it.|$|R
60|$|This was no idle boast on {{the part}} of Leo. <b>He</b> <b>knew</b> that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> {{accomplish}} what <b>he</b> threatened long before the Eskimos could get within spear-throwing distance of his boat.|$|R

2500|$|In the mid 1980s Guitar {{manufacturers}} {{were seeking}} {{to meet an}} ever-increasing demand for musical instruments. [...] This led to major manufacturers like Gibson and Fender {{as well as others}} to begin importing guitars from the Orient. [...] Dean was determined to keep production in the U.S.A. in order to maintain quality; at least until he could assure that the (import) quality was as good as <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> deliver. [...] While he did import for a time, he wound up selling the company in 1991 to take some time off to raise a young family of his own, with his wife, Playboy Playmate - Suzi Schott (Zelinsky).|$|E
2500|$|In Ellwood's view, Eliade's nostalgia {{was only}} {{enhanced}} by his exile from Romania: [...] "In later years Eliade felt {{about his own}} Romanian past as did primal folk about mythic time. He was drawn back to it, yet <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not live there, and that all was not well with it." [...] He suggests that this nostalgia, along with Eliade's sense that [...] "exile is among the profoundest metaphors for all human life", influenced Eliade's theories. Ellwood sees evidence of this in Eliade's concept of the [...] "Terror of history" [...] from which modern man is no longer shielded. In this concept, Ellwood sees an [...] "element of nostalgia" [...] for earlier times [...] "when the sacred was strong and the terror of history had barely raised its head".|$|E
2500|$|Word came in {{the summer}} of 1846 that Rubinstein's father was gravely ill. [...] Rubinstein was left in Berlin while his mother, sister and brother {{returned}} to Russia. At first he continued his studies with Dehn, then with Adolf Bernhard Marx, while composing in earnest. [...] Now 17, <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> no longer pass as a child prodigy. [...] He sought out Liszt in Vienna, hoping Liszt would accept him as a pupil. However, after Rubinstein had played his audition, Liszt is reported to have said, [...] "A talented man must win the goal of his ambition by his own unassisted efforts." [...] At this point, Rubinstein was living in acute poverty. [...] Liszt did nothing to help him. Other calls Rubinstein made to potential patrons came to no avail. After an unsuccessful year in Vienna and a concert tour of Hungary, he returned to Berlin and continued giving lessons.|$|E
60|$|Carthoris {{shouted to}} the Lotharian, warning him back, for <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> but uselessly {{sacrifice}} his life by placing himself, all unarmed, {{in the path}} of the cruel and relentless savages.|$|R
50|$|Blaming {{himself for}} his friend's death (even though <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not {{have reached the}} guns in time anyway), Pete sinks into a depression, unwilling to see anyone. A visit from Ellie brings him out of it. Pete tells her {{that he has been}} given a three-day leave before being sent back to the United States, safely out of combat. Together out in the countryside, they get married. However, Pete's guilt makes him decide to rejoin his unit. Ellie does not try to stop him. Afterward, she discovers she is pregnant, which means she will have to leave the army.|$|R
50|$|When fellow mafioso Salvatore Cancemi {{confessed to}} Buscetta at {{a trial in}} 1993 that he had strangled Buscetta's two sons, Buscetta forgave him saying that <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not have refused the order.|$|R

60|$|All this {{sounded very}} mysterious to Tom Pinch. But as <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> rely upon his friend, he {{resolved}} {{to follow this}} advice.|$|E
60|$|But {{there was}} no need to tell everybody, and so when he telegraphed the fact to Harvey, he enjoined secrecy. <b>He</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> trust Harvey.|$|E

60|$|He did {{not wait}} to see his orders carried out: <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> trust these soldiers--who were still smarting under his rebuke--not to mince matters, when given a free hand to belabour a third party.|$|R
6000|$|... "She is--wonderful," [...] Paul said slowly. He {{was about}} to say more, but he checked himself. Lady May was {{watching}} him, and <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not speak of Adrea Kiros unmoved. So he went on:-- ...|$|R
60|$|Jet was {{not sorry}} {{to sit down}} again, although, {{in view of the}} desperate situation, <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> afford to halt but a short time.|$|E
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not deceive his wife's {{ears and}} eyes just then, so he {{remained}} silent. [...] "We've got to leave, Nell," [...] he admitted at last.|$|E

5000|$|Among the {{visitors}} I {{observed in the}} crowd today was Hon. Andrew Johnson of the Ho. Repts. of Representatives Though he represents a Democratic District in Tennessee (my own State) {{this is the first}} time I have seen him during the present session of Congress. Professing to be a Democrat, he has been politically, if not personally hostile to me during my whole term. He is very vindictive and perverse in his temper and conduct. If he had the manliness and independence to declare his opposition openly, <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not be elected by his constituents. I am not aware that I have ever given him cause for offense.|$|R
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>knew</b> that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not at {{any rate}} be {{warranted}} in mentioning Hetta Carbury's name. He had never even asked her for her love, and certainly had received no assurance that he was loved. 'I cannot name her.' ...|$|R
