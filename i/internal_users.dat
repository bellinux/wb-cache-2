50|$|Data {{theft and}} {{alteration}} {{has been a}} major problem in the recent times. Moreover, as far as patient health records are concerned, there are always potential threats of information leakages, data hacking, information destruction, manipulation or even blackmailing of patients by the external or <b>internal</b> <b>users.</b> Since the consequences of Information leaks are comparatively high in contrast to information alterations, one possible way to have information regarding the user of information is to audit information trails.Audit trails refer to keeping information about who had recently used or accessed patient records. Through the usage of audit trails and the above-mentioned security steps, Electronic Health Records could most probably be made the best way of collecting, storing, retaining and using patient health information.|$|E
50|$|IPsec is a {{protocol}} suite, recently standardized by the IETF, which provides network-layer security {{services such as}} packet confidentiality, authentication, data integrity, replay protection, and automated key management.This is an artifact of firewall deployment: internal traffic that is not seen by the firewall cannot be filtered; as a result, <b>internal</b> <b>users</b> can mount attacks on other users and networks without the firewall being able to intervene. Large networks today {{tend to have a}} large number of entry points (for performance, failover, and other reasons). Furthermore, many sites employ internal firewalls to provide some form of compartmentalization. This makes administration particularly difficult, both from a practical point of view and with regard to policy consistency, since no unified and comprehensive management mechanism exists.|$|E

The Company has established six gas processing (LPG) plants, four along the HVJ pipeline two at Vijaipur, MP, one at Vaghodia, Gujarat and Auraiya, UP and one each in Lakwa, Assam and Usar, Maharashtra.

50|$|Most large {{enterprises}} use zoned network to create layered defense against network oriented threats. For example, an enterprise typically has {{a credit card}} processing (PCI-compliant) zone, a non-PCI zone, a data zone, a DMZ zone to proxy external user access, and an IWZ zone to proxy <b>internal</b> <b>user</b> access. Applications need to integrate across multiple zones. The Hub and spoke model would work better in this case.|$|R
50|$|Galea is a {{database}} security solution protecting properties by encrypting the enterprise key data. It minimizes {{to be affected}} to database performance due to data encryption and provides the system operation with non-stop. Also, it has the encryption module verified by a government agency and maintains availability, confidentiality and integrity of enterprise database and database encryption system based on strict security operation like as FIPS 140-2 Level. Due to introduction of Galea, {{there is no need}} to change an application connecting the existing database to enterprises and it is possible to service encryption/decryption for multiple databases concurrently. Enterprises manage customers’ data securely from intruders through Galea and they can improve their reliability preventing illegal information leakage accidents by <b>internal</b> <b>users</b> and outsourcing development companies. Also, they can cope with various local information protection laws including the privacy data protection law. Currently, Galea supports Oracle only.|$|E
50|$|A reverse proxy server, like a proxy server, is an intermediary, but is {{used the}} other way around. Instead of {{providing}} a service to <b>internal</b> <b>users</b> wanting to access an external network, it provides indirect access for an external network (usually the Internet) to internal resources.For example, a back office application access, such as an email system, could be provided to external users (to read emails while outside the company) but the remote user would not have direct access to their email server. Only the reverse proxy server can physically access the internal email server. This is an extra layer of security, which is particularly recommended when internal resources need to be accessed from the outside. Usually such a reverse proxy mechanism is provided by using an application layer firewall as they focus on the specific shape of the traffic rather than controlling access to specific TCP and UDP ports as a packet filter firewall does.|$|E
5000|$|The {{premise of}} the {{traditional}} enterprise network architecture {{is to create an}} internal network separated from the outside world by a fixed perimeter that consists of a series of firewall functions that block external users from coming in, but allows <b>internal</b> <b>users</b> to get out. [...] Traditional fixed perimeters help protect internal services from external threats via simple techniques for blocking visibility and accessibility from outside the perimeter to internal applications and infrastructure. But the weaknesses of this traditional fixed perimeter model are becoming ever more problematic because of the popularity of user-managed devices and phishing attacks, providing untrusted access inside the perimeter, and SaaS and IaaS extending the perimeter into the Internet.Software defined perimeters address these issues by giving application owners the ability to deploy perimeters that retain the traditional model’s value of invisibility and inaccessibility to outsiders, but can be deployed anywhere - on the internet, in the cloud, at a hosting center, on the private corporate network, or across some or all of these locations.|$|E
