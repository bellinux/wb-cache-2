25|$|The ideal {{conditions}} for imine hydrogenation {{depend on the}} nature of the substrate and catalyst system. Generally, higher pressures of hydrogen gas are needed in order to achieve reasonable reaction times; however, <b>hydrogen</b> <b>pressure</b> does not appreciably affect enantioselectivity. If the active catalyst is generated in situ, Schlenck techniques or a glove box should be employed. Parr shakers may be used for reaction pressures up to 4 bar, although precise temperature control is difficult to achieve in the reaction vessel. For higher hydrogen pressures, specialized autoclave equipment is required.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} take {{advantage}} of the total hydrogen capacity, the intermediate compound LiH must be dehydrogenated as well. Due to its high thermodynamic stability this requires temperatures in excess of 400°C, which is not considered feasible for transportation purposes. Accepting LiH + Al as the final product, the hydrogen storage capacity is reduced to 7.96 wt%. Another problem related to hydrogen storage is the recycling back to LiAlH4 which, owing to its relatively low stability, requires an extremely high <b>hydrogen</b> <b>pressure</b> in excess of 10000 bar. Cycling only reaction R2 — that is, using Li3AlH6 as starting material — would store 5.6 wt% hydrogen in a single step (vs. two steps for NaAlH4 which stores about the same amount of hydrogen). However, attempts at this process have not been successful so far.|$|E

50|$|An {{alternative}} method to deoxygenate biomass-derived oils {{is that of}} decarboxylation/decarbonylation (deCOx), which shows several distinct advantages over hydrotreating. First and foremost, deCOx does not require high <b>hydrogen</b> <b>pressures,</b> meaning that {{it has the potential}} to be performed at smaller decentralized facilities that could be placed closer to the biomass source and lead to a drastic reduction in the economic and environmental costs associated with the transportation of feedstock and products to and from these facilities. In deCOx reactions oxygen is eliminated in the form of carbon dioxide or carbon monoxide. Admittedly, this entails the loss of a small amount of carbon. However, the general consensus is that the lower <b>hydrogen</b> <b>pressures</b> needed more than compensates for the slightly lower carbon efficiency of deCOx relative to HDO.|$|R
