500|$|In {{his opening}} scene, Cagney spoke fluent Yiddish, a {{language}} {{he had picked}} up during his boyhood in New York City. Critics praised the film. Taxi! {{was the source of}} one of Cagney's most misquoted lines; he never actually said, [...] "MMMmmm, you dirty rat!", a line commonly used by impressionists. The closest he got to it in the film was, [...] "Come out and take it, you dirty, yellow-bellied rat, or I'll <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> through the door!" [...] The film was swiftly followed by The Crowd Roars and Winner Take All.|$|E
500|$|When {{the ground}} was finally cleared Gregory insisted, {{according}} to Harris, that Coulthard be replaced. When Harris would not agree, Gregory said, [...] "Then the game is at an end". Harris asked Barton whether he could claim the match on a forfeit. Barton replied [...] "I will <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> in two minutes if the batsmen don't return". Harris then asked Barton to speak with Gregory to ascertain his intentions. When Barton came out he announced that Alick Bannerman and Nat Thomson would resume the NSW innings. They walked onto the arena and reached the stumps, but before they could receive a ball, the crowd again invaded the pitch, and remained there until the scheduled end of play. According to The Sydney Mail approximately 90 minutes' play had been lost. Lord Harris maintained {{his position on the}} ground, standing [...] "erect" [...] with [...] "moustache bristling" [...] among the spectators, fearful that his leaving the arena would lead to a forfeit.|$|E
500|$|The fourth error, {{according}} to Peter the Venerable, {{was that the}} Petrobrusians denied sacramental grace, [...] rejecting the rite of Communion entirely, let alone {{the doctrine of the}} real presence or the nascent Scholastic account of transubstantiation. “They deny, not only the truth of the body and blood of the Lord, daily and constantly offered in the church through the sacrament, but declare that it is nothing at all, and ought not to be offered to God. They say, 'Oh, people, do not believe the bishops, priests, or clergy who seduce you; who, as in many things, so {{in the office of the}} altar, deceive you when they falsely profess to make the body of Christ, and <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> for the salvation of your souls.'" [...] The term [...] "transubstantiation", used to describe the transformation of the consecrated bread and wine into the body and blood of Christ, was first used by Hildebert de Lavardin in about 1079. This theory had long been widely accepted as orthodox doctrine at the time of the attacks by Peter of Bruys. In less than two centuries, in 1215, the Fourth Lateran Council officially declared transubstantiation the necessary, orthodox Catholic explanation of the Eucharist.|$|E

5000|$|Jack Lynch, {{assistant}} professor of English at Rutgers University, says that correction of [...] "me and you" [...] to [...] "you and I" [...] as subject leads people to [...] "internalize the rule that 'you and I' is somehow more proper, and they end up using it in places where they should not - such as 'he <b>gave</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> and I' when it should be 'he <b>gave</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> and me.'" ...|$|R
500|$|The episode {{features}} cover {{versions of}} Kanye West's [...] "Gold Digger", Salt-n-Pepa's [...] "Push It", [...] "Take a Bow" [...] by Rihanna, [...] "I Say a Little Prayer" [...] by Dionne Warwick, Chic's [...] "Le Freak", and [...] "All by Myself" [...] by Eric Carmen.

[...] "Gold Digger" [...] and [...] "Take a Bow" [...] are {{included on the}} album , with a studio recording of [...] "I Say a Little Prayer" [...] included as a bonus track on discs purchased from iTunes. [...] "Take a Bow" [...] was offered {{for use in the}} episode at a reduced licensing rate, something which surprised Murphy, who believed {{he would not be able}} to secure the rights to the song. He stated: [...] "Usually, people who have no. 1 hits, even if they <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> want hundreds of thousands of dollars, in my experience. But Rihanna gave it to us for a really good price. That's been one of the cool and surprising things about this experience, that these people that the cast and we really admire and respect have found out about the show and are supportive." ...|$|E
500|$|Fink {{does not}} know how long her {{character}} will be featured on Glee. When asked about what she likes about her character, Fink said: [...] "I think what I love about Lauren is she's so strong and so confident and she knows what she wants and I feel very blessed to play a role model for people who have ever felt other or different. I remember how I used to feel watching TV and seeing Sara Rue on Popular because she was an inspiration to me. It's funny because what I love about Lauren is that she's unapologetic and she's confident and she's making Puck work for it and she's not just looking for a roll in the hay. I think that they are very sweet together, there is this vulnerability when they are both such bad asses and you put them together and I think there is something really special there. What I appreciate about Lauren is that she's like I don't need to <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> you're going to work for it, and I think that's a great message to send to young girls. I think that he is smitten and she is probably a little smitten too but I think she has enough self esteem not to give everything up for the charming cute boy that's kind of after her." [...] Kevin Fallon, a writer for The Atlantic, reacted favorably to the casting of Fink: [...] "Glee hit the trifecta this year with its three major cast additions. First there were Darren Criss—who's exploded with popularity—and Chord Overstreet. Now there's Ashley Fink's Lauren. And while the tough-only-on-the-outside Lauren can deliciously out-sass Santana Lopez, it's her straight-talking that really has me sold." ...|$|E

For example, in English [...] "(I'll <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you)</b> when I see you" [...] the verb [...] "see" [...] is {{in the present tense}} despite the time being in the future; in Esperanto, future tense is required: (Mi donos ĝin al ci) kiam mi vidos cin.|$|E

2500|$|Songs to Remember {{was finally}} {{released}} in September 1982. In several interviews {{at the time}} of the album's release, Gartside stated his dissatisfaction with Rough Trade's promotion of the record, hinting in one interview that [...] "there's still a lot of problems, as far as I'm concerned, fundamental matters of distribution and economics, promotion, marketing and a bias against their product at radio stations" [...] and in another he complained, [...] "I must say I've been badly disappointed the way RT have handled the past three singles. I dunno, but when you really need that boost, they can't <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you...</b> I'd like to see it generally happen with RT.

2500|$|One {{historian}} has written, however, {{that when}} Murrow met Roosevelt with William J. Donovan of the OSS that night, while {{the magnitude of}} the destruction at Pearl Harbor horrified the president, Roosevelt seemed slightly less surprised by the attack than the other men. According to Murrow, the president told him [...] "Maybe you think [...] didn't surprise us!" [...] He said later, [...] "I believed him", and thought that he might have been asked to stay as a witness. When allegations of Roosevelt's foreknowledge appeared after the war, John Gunther asked Murrow about the meeting. He reportedly responded that the full story would pay for his son's college education and [...] "if you think I'm going to <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> you're out of your mind". Murrow did not write the story, however, before his death.|$|E
2500|$|Senator Clinton {{voted against}} the two major tax cuts {{packages}} introduced by President Bush, the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 and the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003, saying it was fiscally irresponsible to reopen the budget deficit. At the 2000 Democratic National Convention, Clinton had called for maintaining a budget surplus to pay down the national debt for future generations. At a fundraiser in 2004, she told a crowd of financial donors that [...] "Many of you are well enough off that ... the tax cuts may have helped you" [...] but that [...] "We're saying that for America {{to get back on}} track, we're probably going to cut that short and not <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> We're going to take things away from you on behalf of the common good." ...|$|E

2500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Good for You" [...] is a torch {{song and}} a come-hither with themes of intensity, psychodrama, {{self-confidence}} and female self-empowerment, with Gomez singing the hook [...] "I just wanna {{look good for}} you, good for you", as a plea. According to the singer, the track [...] "reps women in a good way" [...] and [...] "does something to a woman when they look good". In an interview for People magazine, she stated: [...] "This song represents the confidence that I truly have inside of me, and I think it's the vulnerable side that I've expressed, but it's also the combination of just feeling myself". It was noted to showcase a shift towards more mature and sexually suggestive subject matter than in Gomez's previous releases. A number of the lyrics attribute syllables {{as a means of}} poetry, namely, [...] "leave this dress a mess on the floor" [...] and [...] "syncopate my skin to your heart beating". Gomez's lyrics specifically deal with pleasing and being the perfect complement for her significant other, by means of wearing skin-tight dresses and doing her [...] "hair up real, real nice". Gomez references the Greek myth of Midas and jewelry retailer Tiffany & Co in the lines [...] "Doing it up like Midas, mmm" [...] and [...] "I'm on marquise diamond / I'm a marquise diamond / Could even make that Tiffany jealous, mmm". Gomez's lyrics deal with pleasing her lover and being the perfect complement for him, seen in lyrics as [...] "Gonna wear that dress you like, skin-tight / Do my hair up real, real nice". The line [...] "You say I <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> hard / So bad, so bad / Make you never wanna leave / I won't / I won't" [...] represents a shift towards more mature and sexually suggestive subject matter than Gomez's previous releases.|$|E
