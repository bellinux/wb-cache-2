At a November 2011 meeting between the two groups, HaKohen was quoted as saying: [...] "The first step towards achieving peace is for both populations {{to learn to be}} <b>good</b> <b>neighbors.</b> And this is less relevant to people in Tel Aviv than it is to ethnic Jews living here in Samaria. ... Both populations need to learn to see and accept the other as indigenous and belonging here. The closest people in the world to the Jewish people are the Arabs. Any hostility between our two peoples is completely unnatural and the result of foreign powers exploiting both populations. ... If we examine the last two decades, we see that thousands of people have been killed on both sides and that our two populations have been forcibly segregated. ... Both peoples have also suffered several other injustices. Thousands of Jews have been forcibly expelled from their homes and turned into refugees. Entire towns and villages have been destroyed. And Arabs have their freedom of movement restricted by a military bureaucracy every day of their lives. ... Before Oslo there were no checkpoints or walls here and everyone could travel wherever they liked. Peoples lived together in a situation that may not have been perfect but was still much better than the situation we see today." ...|$|E

This may be to judge my neighbors harshly; for I believe that many of them are not aware that they have such an institution as the jail in their village.|$|E
6000|$|Charles Louis Auguste Fouquet, Comte de Belleisle, is Grandson of that Intendant Fouquet, sumptuous Financier, whom Louis XIV. at last threw out, {{and locked}} into the Fortress of Pignerol, amid the Savoy Alps, there to meditate for life, which lasted thirty years longer. It was never {{understood}} that the sumptuous Fouquet had altogether stolen public moneys, nor indeed rightly {{what he had done}} to merit Pignerol; and always, though fallen somehow into such dire disfavor, he was pitied and respected by {{a good portion of the}} public. [...] "Has angered Colbert," [...] said the public; [...] "dangerous rivalry to Colbert; that is what has brought Pignerol upon him." [...] Out of Pignerol that Fouquet never came; but his Family bloomed up into light again; had its adventures, sometimes its troubles, in the Regency time, but was always in a rising way:--and here, in this tall lean man getting papers put into his hand, it has risen very high indeed. Going as Ambassador Extraordinary to the Germanic Diet, [...] "to assist <b>good</b> <b>neighbors,</b> as a neighbor and Most Christian Majesty should, in choosing their new Kaiser to the best advantage:" [...] that is the official color his mission is to have. Surely a proud mission;--and Belleisle intends to execute it in a way that will surprise the Germanic Diet and mankind. Privately, Belleisle intends that he, by his own industries, shall himself choose the right Kaiser, such Kaiser as will suit the Most Christian Majesty and him; he intends to make a new French thing of Germany in general; and carries in his head plans of an amazing nature! He and a Brother he has, called the Chevalier de Belleisle, who is also a distinguished man, and seconds M. le Comte with eloquent fire and zeal in all things, are grandsons of that old Fouquet, and the most shining men in France at present. France little dreams how much better it perhaps were, had they also been kept safe in Pignerol!-- ...|$|E
