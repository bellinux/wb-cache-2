500|$|In a {{contemporary}} review, Robert Christgau gave Escape a grade of B+ and wrote that Hutchins and Smith [...] "turn out ingratiating {{variations on a}} formula.

NME described Escape as superior to Whodini's first album and praised Smith's production, writing that his [...] "sparse DMC sound here gives way to a rich and warm electronic soundscape".

According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Kobalt Music Publishing Inc., [...] "Hold It Against Me" [...] {{is set in the}} compound meter time signature, with a moderate dance beat infused metronome of 133 beats per minute. Lyrically, [...] "Hold It Against Me" [...] talks about seducing someone on the dancefloor.

Ajitpaul Mangat of Tiny Mix Tapes noted the song {{as some of the}} album's generic work, stating, [...] "with its run-of-the-mill lyrics about longing hearts, it sounds like the work of any middling R singer." [...] Tyler Lewis of PopMatters said [...] "I Need A Girl" [...] was among the album's best songs, that it and [...] "Neighbors Know My Name", [...] "thump as they should." [...] David Jeffries of Allmusic noted the song as a standout track from Ready. Glenn Gamboa of Newsday said that on the track, Songz [...] "displays a more flexible delivery than usual." [...] DJBooth said, [...] "Traditional R depends on three things: vocals, writing, and production. [...] In a nutshell, <b>I</b> <b>Need</b> <b>A</b> Girl has the whole trifecta, and should be just what Trey needs to get Ready a solid release date."

The record, however, was never sent to Azalea and on 1 August 2013, she denied that Ora would be collaborating {{with her on the}} album. Azalea then met Perry for the first time, as her supporting act at the iTunes Festival that year. At the festival, Perry approached Azalea with an offer to record [...] "Black Widow" [...] as she felt the song would suit her better. Azalea was then invited to Perry's after party that night, where the two exchanged numbers, and Perry sent Azalea the record. When Azalea received the song, it only consisted of a hook and a beat. She initially wanted Perry to sing the song's hook, but Perry was unable to because of time constraints. In an interview, Azalea mentioned, [...] "It needed someone who could really sing, as Katy's voice is awesome. The sky's the limit for Rita. Rita's a superstar and she will only get bigger.

500|$|Tricky {{explained}} Maxinquayes {{title in}} an interview with Simon Reynolds: [...] "Quaye, that's this race of people in Africa, and 'Maxin,' that's my mum's name, Maxine, and I've just taken the E off"; Reynolds interpreted this as a [...] "place name" [...] similar to the Rastafarian idea of Zion. In another source, Tricky was reported as saying Quaye had also been his mother's surname. According to Greg Kot, his mother's name provided the album its title while her suicide, along with his father abandoning him and Tricky's lack of moral sense as a youth, helped inform his [...] "unsentimental grasp on reality", which was reflected in Maxinquayes [...] "collision of beauty and violence". In the opinion of Stylus Magazines Kenan Hebert, who called it [...] "a document of obsession, mistrust, misconduct, solipsism, and sociopathy", the songs dealing with dysfunctional sexual relationships and fear of intimacy were given a Freudian angle by his mother's influence on the album, including Tricky's reference to her on [...] "Aftermath". In an interview for The Wire, Tricky explained his mother's influence and his use of female vocalists like Topley-Bird: [...] "My first lyric ever on a song was 'your eyes resemble mine, you'll see as no others can'. I didn't have any kids then... so what am I talking about? Who am I talking about? My mother... used to write poetry but in her time she couldn't have done anything with that, there wasn't any opportunity. It's almost like she killed herself to give me the opportunity, my lyrics. I can never understand why I write as a female, I think I've got my mum's talent, I'm her vehicle. So <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>a</b> woman to sing that." ...|$|E

[...] Paramount executives thought Wilder was adapting a story called A Can of Beans (which did not exist) and allowed him relative freedom to proceed as he saw fit.

2500|$|Markie's third studio album <b>I</b> <b>Need</b> <b>a</b> Haircut was {{released}} on August 27, 1991, on Cold Chillin'/Warner Bros. Records and was produced by Biz Markie and his cousin Cool V. [...] Sales of the album were already low when Markie was served a lawsuit by Gilbert O'Sullivan, who claimed that the album's [...] "Alone Again" [...] featured an unauthorized sample from his hit [...] "Alone Again (Naturally)". O'Sullivan's claim was upheld in a landmark ruling, Grand Upright Music, Ltd. v. Warner Bros. Records Inc., that altered the landscape of hip-hop, finding that all samples must be cleared with the original artist before being used. In accordance with the ruling, Warner Bros., {{the parent company of}} Cold Chillin', had to pull <b>I</b> <b>Need</b> <b>a</b> Haircut from circulation, and all companies had to clear samples with the samples' creators before releasing the records. This development reflected the increasing popularity of hip-hop and the financial stakes over which releases were set. Biz responded in 1993 with the mischievously titled All Samples Cleared!, but his career had been hurt by the publicity emanating from the lawsuit, and the record suffered accordingly. Additional bad news came when the video for the track 'Toilet Stool Rap' was labeled Worst Video of the Year on the Fromage show from Canada's MuchMusic.|$|E
