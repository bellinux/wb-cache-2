This all made S eager to sell their loans. The buyers – major Wall Street firms – were quick to take advantage of the S' lack of expertise, buying at 60% to 90% of value and then transforming the loans by bundling them as, effectively, government-backed bonds by virtue of Ginnie Mae, Freddie Mac, or Fannie Mae guarantees.

500|$|By March 1987, Keating {{was asking}} McCain {{to travel to}} meet with {{regulators}} regarding Lincoln Savings; McCain refused.

2500|$|By 1932, {{unemployment}} {{had reached}} 23.6%, peaking in early 1933 at 25%. Drought persisted {{in the agricultural}} heartland, businesses and families defaulted on record numbers of loans, and more than 5,000 banks had failed. Hundreds of thousands of Americans found themselves homeless, and began congregating in shanty towns – dubbed [...] "Hoovervilles" [...] – that began to appear across the country. In response, President Hoover and Congress approved the <b>Federal</b> <b>Home</b> <b>Loan</b> <b>Bank</b> Act, to spur new home construction, and reduce foreclosures. The final attempt of the Hoover Administration {{to stimulate the economy}} was the passage of the Emergency Relief and Construction Act (ERA) which included funds for public works programs such as dams and the creation of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC) in 1932. The Reconstruction Finance Corporation was a Federal agency with the authority to lend up to $2billion to rescue banks and restore confidence in financial institutions. But $2billion was not enough to save all the banks, and bank runs and bank failures continued. Quarter by quarter the economy went downhill, as prices, profits and employment fell, leading to the political realignment in 1932 that brought to power Franklin Delano Roosevelt. It is important to note, however, that after volunteerism failed, Hoover developed ideas that laid the framework for parts of the New Deal.|$|E
