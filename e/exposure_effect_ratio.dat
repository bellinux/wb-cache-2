40|$|Background: Unmeasured {{confounding}} {{is one of}} {{the principal}} problems in observational pharmacoepidemiologic studies. Prior event rate ratio (PERR) adjustment method has been proposed to control for unmeasured confounding. Objectives: To assess the performance of the PERR method in realistic pharmacoepidemiologic settings. Methods: Simulation studies were performed in several scenarios with varying effects of prior events on the probability of subsequent exposure, incidence rates, strength of confounders in prior and post periods, and rate of mortality/dropout. <b>Exposure</b> <b>effects</b> were estimated using conventional rate ratio (RR) and PERR adjustmentmethods. For the PERR method, the <b>exposure</b> <b>effect</b> is a <b>ratio</b> of two RRs: RR post exposure initiation and RR prior to initiation of exposure. In each simulation, the sample size was 100000 and each scenario was replicated 10000 times. 95 % confidence intervals were estimated in a non-parametric way using the 2. 5 and 97. 5 percentiles of the 10000 estimates. Results: The <b>exposure</b> <b>effects</b> from the PERR adjustment method are highly biased when “prior” events influence the probability of subsequent exposure or when confounding differs considerably between prior and post periods. For example, the RR ranged from 1. 52 to 1. 10 (true RR= 2. 00) when the effect of prior events on the exposure was RR 1. 25 to 1. 70, respectively. With a strong effect of prior events on the exposure (e. g. RR= 1. 70), the bias of the estimates were more pronounced for PERR method than for the conventional method. In such case, even with a null <b>exposure</b> <b>effect</b> (RR = 1. 00), the estimates shifted away from the null. In all settings, the confidence intervals of the estimates were wider for the PERR method than for the conventional method. Conclusions: The PERR adjustment method has significant limitations; in particular situations, e. g. when prior events strongly influence the probability of subsequent exposure, it can be more biased than conventional methods. Hence, caution should be exercised when applying this method and theoretical justification should be provided for underlying assumptions of the PERR...|$|R
40|$|Chronic noise {{exposure}} {{is associated with}} adverse pathophysiological effects, which {{may contribute to the}} progression of hypertension. However, evidence supporting its effect on women is still inconsistent. The aim {{of the study was to}} examine the hypertension risk related to road traffic noise in residential settings in an urban community amongst reproductive-aged women. Cross-sectional study data including 3, 121 pregnant women, 20 - 45 years old, and a geographic information system (GIS) to assess the average road noise (LAeq 24 hr) for every subject at the current residential address were used. Effects on physician-diagnosed hypertension were estimated by logistic regression with adjustments for age, social status, marital status, education, alcohol consumption, ethnic group, parity, body mass index, chronic disease, and exposure duration. The prevalence of hypertension amongst women aged 20 - 45 years in the lowest exposure category was 13. 1 % in comparison to 13. 6 % and 18. 1 % amongst those exposed to the medium and the highest exposure category, respectively. After making adjustments for the selected variables, no <b>exposure</b> <b>effects</b> [Odds <b>ratio</b> (OR) ≈ 1. 0] were noted in the medium exposure category [51 - 60 dB(A) ]. However, a slight increase was noted in the highest exposure category [≥ 61 dB(A)), OR 1. 36; 95 % CI 0. 86 - 2. 15]. The effect was more pronounced amongst women aged 30 - 45 years and a positive exposure-response relation was indicated for hypertension: An effect was seen at noise levels 51 - 60 dB(A) (OR = 1. 03; 95 % CI 0. 72 - 1. 49) and at > 61 dB(A) (OR = 1. 94, 95 % CI 1. 01 - 3. 72). The present study shows some evidence for an association between the residential road traffic noise and hypertension amongst reproductive-aged women, and an exposure-response relationship...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{assess the}} impact of random left {{truncation}} of data on the estimation of time-dependent <b>exposure</b> <b>effects.</b> METHODS: A simulation study was conducted in which the relation between exposure and outcome was based on an immediate <b>exposure</b> <b>effect,</b> a first-time <b>exposure</b> <b>effect,</b> or a cumulative <b>exposure</b> <b>effect.</b> The individual probability of truncation, the moment of truncation, the exposure rate, and the incidence rate of the outcome were varied in different simulations. All observations before the moment of left truncation were omitted from the analysis. RESULTS: Random left truncation did not bias estimates of immediate <b>exposure</b> <b>effects,</b> but resulted in an overestimation of a cumulative <b>exposure</b> <b>effect</b> and underestimation of a first-time <b>exposure</b> <b>effect.</b> The magnitude of bias in estimation of cumulative <b>exposure</b> <b>effects</b> depends on a combination of exposure rate, probability of truncation, and proportion of follow-up time left truncated. CONCLUSIONS: In case of a cumulative or first-time exposure, left truncation can result in substantial bias in pharmacoepidemiologic studies. The potential for this bias likely differs between databases, which may lead to heterogeneity in estimated <b>exposure</b> <b>effects</b> between studies...|$|R

40|$|The mere <b>exposure</b> <b>effect,</b> {{positive}} affect elicited {{by exposure to}} a previously unfamiliar stimulus, {{is considered one of}} the most well established findings in the psychological literature. Yet its mechanism remains unknown. In Experiments 1 - 5, memory encoding was examined to determine whether the mere <b>exposure</b> <b>effect</b> was a form of conceptual or perceptual implicit priming, and, if not either, whether cardiovascular psychophysiology could reveal its nature. Experiment 1 examined the effects of study phase level of processing on recognition, the mere <b>exposure</b> <b>effect,</b> and word identification implicit priming. Deep relative to shallow processing improved recognition, but did not influence the mere <b>exposure</b> <b>effect</b> or word identification implicit priming. Experiments 2 and 3 examined the effect of study-test changes in font and orientation, respectively, on the mere <b>exposure</b> <b>effect</b> and word identification implicit priming. Different study-test font and orientation reduced word identification implicit priming, but had no influence on the mere <b>exposure</b> <b>effect.</b> The combined results from Experiments 1 - 3 suggested that conceptual and perceptual processing do not drive the mere <b>exposure</b> <b>effect.</b> Experiments 4 and 5 developed and used, respectively, an innovative cardiovascular psychophysiological implicit priming paradigm to examine whether stimulus-specific cardiovascular reactivity at study predicted the mere <b>exposure</b> <b>effect</b> at test. At encoding, stimulus-specific peripheral vasodilatation had predictive value for the mere <b>exposure</b> <b>effect,</b> but not for word identification implicit priming. Experiments 6 and 7 examined whether sustained or transitory anxiety (i. e., trait or state, respectively) would influence the mere <b>exposure</b> <b>effect.</b> Greater trait and state anxiety reduced the mere <b>exposure</b> <b>effect.</b> Together, the findings from these experiments (N = 362) identify a novel affective mechanism of implicit priming that is influenced by cardiovascular psychophysiology and variations in trait and state anxiety...|$|R
40|$|A {{meta-analysis}} {{of research on}} Zajonc's (1968) mere <b>exposure</b> <b>effect</b> indicated that stimuli per-ceived without awareness produce substantially larger <b>exposure</b> <b>effects</b> than do stimuli that are consciously perceived (Bornstein, 1989 a). However, this finding has not been tested directly in the laboratory. Two experiments were conducted comparing {{the magnitude of the}} <b>exposure</b> <b>effect</b> produced by S-ms (i. e., subliminal) stimuli and stimuli presented for longer durations (i. e., 500 ms).

40|$|Background: The {{results from}} studies on adverse drug effects in {{electronic}} health care databases may vary due to multiple reasons, {{one of them}} being differences in (left and right) censoring mechanisms between databases. Such censoring mechanisms can be features of the database and are therefore hard to avoid by the researcher. Objectives: To {{assess the impact of}} left and right censoring on estimates of adverse effects of drugs. Methods: We used simulation studies {{to assess the impact of}} left and right censoring (differential or nondifferential) on bias of estimates of adverse drug effects. We studied three types of adverse drug effects: (1) a constant exposure effect; (2) a first-time <b>exposure</b> <b>effect</b> (e. g. anaphylactic reaction); and (3) a cumulative <b>exposure</b> <b>effect.</b> Effects were expressed as incidence rate ratios and estimated using Poisson regression. Results: Non-random censoring biased all three types of adverse drug effects. Random right censoring did not result in a bias. Random left-censoring resulted in an overestimation of the drug effect in case of a cumulative <b>exposure</b> <b>effect</b> and an underestimation of the drug effect in case of a first-time <b>exposure</b> <b>effect.</b> For example, when 50 % of the observation time was left censored, the observed first-time <b>exposure</b> <b>effect</b> was RR 1. 4 instead of the true RR 3. 0 and a cumulative <b>exposure</b> <b>effect</b> of RR 1. 15 per unit time exposure was observed instead of the true RR 1. 1 per unit time exposure. The impact of censoring depended on exposure prevalence, outcome incidence, and duration of the time-interval that was censored. Conclusions: Censoring may differentially impact estimates of <b>exposure</b> <b>effect</b> in studies of constant, firsttime, and cumulative <b>exposure</b> <b>effects.</b> Researchers should be aware of this when combining data from multiple databases or when comparing drug effects across databases...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} the mere <b>exposure</b> <b>effect</b> and the explicit memory in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients and elderly control subjects, using unfamiliar faces. During the exposure phase, the subjects estimated {{the age of}} briefly flashed faces. The mere <b>exposure</b> <b>effect</b> was examined by presenting pairs of faces (old and new) and asking participants to select the face they liked. The participants were then presented with a forced-choice explicit recognition task. Controls subjects exhibited above-chance preference and recognition scores for old faces.

Here we consider whether a generalized mere <b>exposure</b> <b>effect</b> contributes to their appeal. Specifically, we tested whether positive affect associated with previously seen faces (the mere <b>exposure</b> <b>effect)</b> generalizes to the averaged composite of those faces. To maximize {{the likelihood of}} generalization, two six-face sets were created for each of four distinct facial types (male and female, Japanese and Caucasian), each with high within-set similarity and low between-set similarity.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The <b>effects</b> {{of tobacco}} <b>exposure</b> are {{typically}} examined by comparing {{groups based on}} a cut-score of self-reported number of cigarettes or bioassays collected in cross-sectional studies. This study introduces a new fuzzy clustering method that facilitates detection of subtle <b>exposure</b> <b>effects</b> by objectively deriving subgroups from modeling multidimensional exposure measures. We test the new method on a known <b>exposure</b> <b>effect</b> (fetal growth) and report on the graded <b>exposure</b> <b>effect</b> detected in a pregnancy cohort. METHODS: 978 pregnant women were enrolled from 1986 to 1992 in the Maternal Infant Smoking Study of East Boston (MISSEB). Four kinds of exposure data were used to generate exposure groups: self-reported smoking, cotinine levels, nicotine levels, and nicotine dependence scores. Subgroups were identified via a comprehensive validation procedure. The results from MISSEB (number of <b>exposure</b> clusters, <b>exposure</b> <b>effects</b> on birth weight, body length, and head circumference) were compared with those obtained in a separate cohort. RESULTS: Using our new method in MISSEB, {{the same number of}} clusters was generated as previously, and graded <b>exposure</b> <b>effects</b> were again detected. Neonates with heavier exposure weighed less at birth relative to nonexposed neonates, with no difference between lighter-exposed and nonexposed neonates. CONCLUSIONS: The same graded prenatal <b>exposure</b> <b>effect</b> emerges for known exposure-related outcomes across 2 different studies, about 2 decades apart. Our new method characterizes the degree of prenatal exposure, with the potential to help detect subtler effects on developmental outcomes, such as deficits in growth or development, neonatal temperament and behavior, and psychological functioning...|$|R
40|$|Exposure {{increases}} liking – {{the mere}} <b>exposure</b> <b>effect.</b> The phenomenon is highly robust, having {{been reported in}} over 200 articles. The present thesis investigated {{the limits of the}} mere <b>exposure</b> <b>effect</b> – situations in which exposure does not cause liking. Many authors have claimed that the mere <b>exposure</b> <b>effect</b> occurs even when participants are unaware of stimulus exposure. Chapter 1 examined these claims using exposure duration and continuous flash suppression to render participants aware or unaware of the stimuli. No mere <b>exposure</b> <b>effect</b> was obtained without conscious awareness. Only exposure with awareness increased liking. Exposure with awareness is also insufficient for the mere <b>exposure</b> <b>effect.</b> In Chapter 2, participants were repeatedly exposed to pairs of contexts and target stimuli. The usual preference for familiar target stimuli was disrupted when the context-target pairings were rearranged between exposure and test, or a novel context was introduced at test. Thus, liking of stimuli due to exposure is specific to the context of exposure and does not generalise to other contexts. Chapter 3 hypothesised that the mere <b>exposure</b> <b>effect</b> would be robust to changes in context if the stimuli were exposed in multiple contexts. Thus, the target stimuli were paired with more than one context. The mere <b>exposure</b> <b>effect</b> was robust to exposure in multiple contexts, but only when the target stimulus was presented at test in a context in which it had been repeatedly exposed. The results suggest that familiarity of the relationships between stimuli and their context, not simply familiarity of the stimuli themselves, leads to liking. Chapter 4 investigated valenced stimuli as a limit to the mere <b>exposure</b> <b>effect</b> because previous studies have shown seemingly inconsistent findings. Exposure increased liking for negatively and positively valenced stimuli. Increased liking of negatively valenced stimuli was robust to a change in context between exposure and test – a finding that is not easily accommodated by current mere exposure accounts. Overall, mere exposure is not sufficient to increase liking. The present evidence suggests that only exposure with awareness increases the pleasantness of stimuli and that the increase is generally limited to the context or contexts of exposure...|$|R

Topolinski et al., (2014) explained that the fluency created by pronunciation plays a vital role in increasing fondness for a stimulus. In the experiment, participants were shown unfamiliar adverts in a cinema. The control group watched the adverts with a sugar cube in their mouth. Therefore, there was no interference in pronunciation in the control group. The experimental group watched the adverts whilst eating popcorn, which meant there was oral interference. One week later, participants rated their liking of products. In the control group, the mere <b>exposure</b> <b>effect</b> was observed, where old products had higher ratings than new products. In the experimental group, the mere <b>exposure</b> <b>effect</b> was abolished by interfering with fluency of pronunciation during presentation of stimulus.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: We {{propose a}} method for {{diagnosing}} confounding bias under a model that links a spatially and temporally varying exposure and health outcome. We decompose the association into orthogonal components, corresponding to distinct spatial and temporal scales of variation. If the model fully controls for confounding, the <b>exposure</b> <b>effect</b> estimates should be equal at the different temporal and spatial scales. We show that the overall <b>exposure</b> <b>effect</b> estimate is a weighted average of the scale-specific <b>exposure</b> <b>effect</b> estimates. We use this approach to estimate the association between monthly averages of fine particles (PM 2. 5) over the preceding 12 months and monthly mortality rates in 113 US counties from 2000 to 2002. We decompose the association between PM 2. 5 and mortality into 2 components: (1) the association between “national trends ” in PM 2. 5 and mortality; and (2) the association between “local trends, ” defined as county-specific deviations from national trends.

An abundance of previous mere exposure research has utilised neutral, meaningless stimuli, with few studies using emotional stimuli. However, it is highly plausible that the stimuli used in these studies were not truly emotional. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} study was to examine the <b>effect</b> of repeated <b>exposure</b> on liking ratings of images which had inherent emotional properties, namely valence and arousal. Three experiments took place. Experiment 1 used neutral yet meaningful images to obtain a baseline but surprisingly, no significant mere <b>exposure</b> <b>effect</b> was found.

Guided by these findings, Experiment 3 then used negative high arousal images that have greater societal application, namely cigarette health warning images. Strikingly, a significant mere <b>exposure</b> <b>effect</b> was again found. It is argued that stimulus discriminability played a vital role in the occurrence of the mere <b>exposure</b> <b>effect,</b> such that a significant effect was found only when the stimuli were of similar content to one another.

The heat <b>exposure</b> <b>effects</b> may occur from hot air, radiant heat, contact with hot surfaces, endogenous heat {{produced by the}} body during exercise, which cannot be cooled during fire. A significant morbidity and mortality from exposure to heat was reported in other countries but not from India. Aims : Present study focuses on prevalence of heat <b>exposure</b> <b>effects</b> i. e., heat exhaustion, heat syncope, heat pyrexia and heat cramps recorded among fire fighters of Ahmedabad fire brigade. Settings: Ahmedabad fire brigade (AFB) of Ahmedabad municipal corporation. Design: Cross sectional. Materials and Methods: Present study focuses on prevalence of heat <b>exposure</b> <b>effects</b> i. e., heat exhaustion, heat syncope, heat pyrexia and heat cramps recorded between 262 FF of AFB. This prevalence&#x 2032;s were observed among firemen those directly exposed to heat in combating fire and others (load trucks, pump trucks etc.) that assist the firemen. These were seen in different age groups (&# 60; 30; 31 - 45 and&# 62; 45 yrs), duration of exposure (&# 60; 10; 11 - 20 and&# 62; 21 yrs). The number of accidents associated with heat exposure was analyzed. Statistical Analysis: Prevalence comparison by Chi-square test. Results: The results revealed that a total of 53 (20. 0 &#x 0025;) FF reported health <b>exposure</b> <b>effects</b> and were higher among firemen than other groups. Heat exhaustion 48 (18. 3 &#x 0025;); heat syncope 11 (4. 2 &#x 0025;); heat pyrexia 11 (4. 2 &#x 0025;) and heat cramps 16 (6. 1 &#x 0025;) were reported indicating significant occurrence of heat stress among firefighters. In majority of FF, the frequency of occurrence was observed at only one instance. There were no differences according to age or duration of exposure. Among 53 FF with heat <b>exposure</b> <b>effects,</b> accident were reported in 10 (18. 9 &#x 0025;) suggesting that heat stress {{may be responsible for}} this. Conclusion: Overall, Significant occurrence of heat <b>exposure</b> <b>effect</b> among FF and wearing cooling jackets/other heat proof materials may be precautionary cum preventive measure...|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} method for {{diagnosing}} confounding bias under a model which links a spatially and temporally varying exposure and health outcome. We decompose the association into orthogonal components, corresponding to distinct spatial and temporal scales of variation. If the model fully controls for confounding, the <b>exposure</b> <b>effect</b> estimates should be equal at the different temporal and spatial scales. We show that the overall <b>exposure</b> <b>effect</b> estimate is a weighted average of the scale-specific <b>exposure</b> <b>effect</b> estimates. We use this approach to estimate the association between monthly averages of fine particles (PM 2. 5) over the preceding 12 months and monthly mortality rates in 113 U. S. counties from 2000 - 2002. We decompose the association between PM 2. 5 and mortality into two components: 1) the association between “national trends” in PM 2. 5 and mortality; and 2) the association between “local trends,” defined as county-specificdeviations from national trends. This second component provides evidence as to whether counties having steeper declines in PM 2. 5 also have steeper declines in mortality relative to their national trends. We find that the <b>exposure</b> <b>effect</b> estimates are different at these two spatio-temporalscales, which raises concerns about confounding bias. We believe that the association between trends in PM 2. 5 and mortality at the national scale {{is more likely to}} be confounded than is the association between trends in PM 2. 5 and mortality at the local scale. If the association at the national scale is set aside, there is little evidence of an association between 12 -month exposure to PM 2. 5 and mortality...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the growing}} {{popularity}} of propensity score (PS) methods in epidemiology, relatively little has been written in the epidemiologic literature about the problem of variable selection for PS models. The authors present the results of two simulation studies designed to help epidemiologists gain insight into the variable selection problem in a PS analysis. The simulation studies illustrate how the choice of variables that are included in a PS model can affect the bias, variance, and mean squared error of an estimated <b>exposure</b> <b>effect.</b> The results suggest that variables that are unrelated to the exposure but related to the outcome should always be included in a PS model. The inclusion of these variables will decrease the variance of an estimated <b>exposure</b> <b>effect</b> without in-creasing bias. In contrast, including variables that are related to the exposure but not to the outcome will increase the variance of the estimated <b>exposure</b> <b>effect</b> without decreasing bias. In very small studies, the inclusion of variables that are strongly related to the exposure but only weakly related to the outcome can be detrimental to an estimate in a mean squared error sense. The addition of these variables removes only a small amount of bias but can increase the variance of the estimated <b>exposure</b> <b>effect.</b> These simulation studies and other analytical results suggest that standard model-building tools designed to create good predictive models of the exposure will not always lead to optimal PS models, particularly in small studies. confounding factors (epidemiology); effect modifiers (epidemiology); models, statistical; propensity score...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that the mere <b>exposure</b> <b>effect</b> under {{subliminal}} conditions is more likely to occur for implicit attitudes than for explicit attitudes. We tested whether the implicit effects of subliminal mere exposure could spill over to the explicit level through social interaction. Preliminary experiment replicated the findings that the subliminal mere <b>exposure</b> <b>effect</b> occurs only for implicit attitudes, and not for explicit attitudes. Main experiment showed that this implicit effect could become explicit through discussion between two individuals who had been subliminally exposed to the same stimuli. However, this transformation of attitudes through social interaction did not occur when the two individuals were exposed to different stimuli. Implications were discussed in terms of justification through social interaction...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} two decades {{interest}} in implicit memory, most notably repetition priming, has grown considerably. During the same period, research has also focused on the mere <b>exposure</b> <b>effect.</b> Although the two areas have developed relatively independently, a number of studies has described the mere <b>exposure</b> <b>effect</b> as an example of implicit memory. Tacit in their comparisons is the assumption that the effect is more specifically a demonstration of repetition priming. Having noted that this assumption has attracted relatively little attention, this paper reviews current evidence and shows that {{it is by no means}} conclusive. Although some evidence is suggestive of a common underlying mechanism, even a modified repetition priming (perceptual fluency/attribution) framework cannot accommodate all of the differences between the two phenomena. Notwithstanding this, it seems likely that a version of this theoretical framework still offers the best hope of a comprehensive explanation for the mere <b>exposure</b> <b>effect</b> and its relationship to repetition priming. As such, the paper finishes by offering some initial guidance as to ways in which the perceptual fluency/attribution framework might be extended, as well as outlining important areas for future research...|$|R
