40|$|A {{wide range}} of {{architectures}} have been proposed within the areas of learning by demonstration and multi-robot coordi-nation. These areas share a common issue: how humans and robots share information and knowledge among themselves. This paper analyses the impact of communication between human teachers during simultaneous demonstration of task execution in the novel Multi-robot Learning by Demonstra-tion domain, using the MRLbD architecture. The perfor-mance is analysed {{in terms of time}} to task completion, as well as the quality of the multi-robot <b>joint</b> <b>action</b> <b>plans.</b> Participants with different levels of skills taught real robots solutions for a furniture moving task through teleoperation. The experimental results provide evidence that explicit com-munication between teachers does not necessarily reduce the time to complete a task, but contributes to the synchronisa-tion of manoeuvres, thus enhancing the quality of the <b>joint</b> <b>action</b> <b>plans</b> generated by the MRLbD architecture...|$|R
40|$|The central {{problem of}} {{designing}} intelligent robot systems which learn by demonstrations of desired behaviour {{has been largely}} studied {{within the field of}} robotics. Numerous architectures for action recognition and prediction of intent of a single teacher have been proposed. However, little work has been done addressing how a group of robots can learn by simultaneous demonstrations of multiple teachers. This paper contributes a novel approach for learning multirobot <b>joint</b> <b>action</b> <b>plans</b> from unlabelled data. The robots firstly learn the demonstrated sequence of individual actions using the HAMMER architecture. Subsequently, the group behaviour is segmented over time and space by applying a spatio-temporal clustering algorithm. The experimental results, in which humans teleoperated real robots during a search and rescue task deployment, successfully demonstrated the efficacy of combining action recognition at individual level with group behaviour segmentation, spotting the exact moment when robots must form coalitions to achieve the goal, thus yielding reasonable generation of multirobot <b>joint</b> <b>action</b> <b>plans...</b>|$|R
2500|$|The {{first meeting}} on {{establishing}} a <b>joint</b> <b>action</b> <b>plan</b> {{in the event}} of a German invasion was on 24 May 1940. The meeting was held in London and had been convened to explore every conceivable way in which the German forces may attempt an invasion of Ireland. At the meeting were Joseph Walshe, Irish secretary of External Affairs, Colonel Liam Archer of Irish Military Intelligence (G2), and officers from the Royal Navy, British Army, and the Royal Air Force. [...] The War Office wanted direct liaisons between the Irish military authorities in Dublin and the British General Officer Commanding in Belfast. Walshe and Archer therefore agreed to fly in secret to Belfast with Lieutenant Colonel Dudley Clarke. In Belfast, two British Army staff officers were collected and the group travelled back to Dublin by rail. This meeting was held underneath Government buildings in Kildare Street and included a number of Irish Army officers. The meeting was informed that General Sir Hubert Huddleston, the General Officer Commanding (GOC.) Northern Ireland, was already under orders to take a mobile column south of the border to help the Irish Army if the Germans invaded.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{whether people}} {{take into account}} an interaction partner's attentional focus and whether they represent in advance their partner's part of the task when planning {{to engage in a}} synchronous <b>joint</b> <b>action.</b> The experiment involved two participants <b>planning</b> and performing <b>joint</b> <b>actions</b> (i. e., synchronously lifting and clinking glasses), unimanual individual actions (i. e., lifting and moving a glass as if clinking with another person), and bimanual individual actions. EEG was recorded from one of the participants. We employed a choice reaction paradigm where a visual cue indicated the type of <b>action</b> to be <b>planned,</b> followed 1. 5 sec later by a visual go stimulus, prompting the participants to act. We studied attention allocation processes by examining two lateralized EEG components, namely the anterior directing attention negativity and the late directing attention positivity. <b>Action</b> <b>planning</b> processes were examined using the late contingent negative variation and the movement-related potential. The results show that early stages of <b>joint</b> <b>action</b> <b>planning</b> involve dividing attention between locations in space relevant for one's own part of the <b>joint</b> <b>action</b> and locations relevant for one's partner's part of the <b>joint</b> <b>action.</b> At later stages of <b>joint</b> <b>action</b> <b>planning,</b> participants represented in advance their partner's upcoming action in addition to their own action, although not at an effector-specific level.

40|$|The {{ability to}} act jointly with others is a {{hallmark}} of primate evolution and is fundamental for human development. In recent years, the study of coordination strategies between individuals performing <b>joint</b> <b>actions</b> has received growing attention. However, when, {{in the course of}} post-natal development, this cognitive-motor function emerges is still unknown. Here, we studied dyads of peers aged 6 - 9 years, as well as adult subjects, while they performed a task where the same action, namely, exerting hand force on an isometric joystick to move a visual cursor from a central toward a peripheral target, was performed in a "solo" and in a social "cooperative" context. The results revealed that during <b>joint</b> <b>action</b> <b>planning,</b> an attempt to synchronize one's own action with that of a partner emerges at 7 years of age, together with a reduction in the duration and variability of the reaction times. A critical time is 8 years, when "solo" performance reaches a high level of accuracy. From this age, another coordination strategy, based on the online monitoring of the peer's behavior, seems to be implemented during the execution of <b>joint</b> <b>action.</b> The motor and cognitive development occurring during childhood are discussed as possible mechanisms mediating, respectively, the capability and the propensity {{to take into account the}} peer's behavior for implementing a common <b>action</b> <b>plan...</b>|$|R

40|$|Past work on <b>joint</b> <b>action</b> {{has shown}} that the {{performance}} of <b>joint</b> <b>action</b> improves when individuals within a pair behave using a predictable strategy. The present study sought {{to examine the effects of}} manipulating task demands on <b>joint</b> <b>action</b> <b>planning</b> strategies and online control. Participant pairs performed a joint task in which a Passer passed an object to a Receiver, who had to place it in a target area in a pre-determined orientation. Seven experiments varied the demands, constraints, and roles involved in each participants' task. Experiment 1, which served as a control for the following experiments, examined the basic <b>action</b> <b>planning</b> formation amongst two individuals. Experiment 2 and 3 applied an artificial impairment in a predictable and unpredictable manner, respectively, to one of the participants to examine its effect on strategy formation relative to <b>action</b> <b>planning</b> and control. In Experiment 4 the effects of gaze cue was examined, whilst Experiment 5 increased task difficulty through the insertion of an added precision task. Experiment 6 examined the role of imitation and adopting a partner's role during joint cooperation by swapping roles during the object passing task. Experiment 7 increased movement complexity through the application of a cube that could be rotated in 3 dimensions. Overall, it was observed that Passers were inclined to rotate the object prior to handing it to the Receiver, thereby accommodating the latter's affordances. When task demands were varied within a session, Passer's adopted highly consistent strategies across conditions. When roles were reversed halfway through the session, participants generally behaved as their partner had in the first block. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
