40|$|The {{convergence}} of {{corporate social responsibility}} (CSR) and corporate governance (CG) has changed the corporate accountability mechanism. This has developed a socially responsible ‘corporate self-regulation’, a synthesis of governance and responsibility <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>companies</b> <b>of</b> strong economies. However, unlike <b>in</b> <b>the</b> strong economies, this convergence has not been visible <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>companies</b> <b>of</b> weak economies, where the civil society groups are unorganised, regulatory agencies are either ineffective or corrupt and the media and non-governmental organisations do not mirror the corporate conscience. Using the case of Bangladesh, this article investigates the convergence between CSR and CG <b>in</b> <b>the</b> self-regulation <b>of</b> <b>companies</b> <b>in</b> a less vigilant environment...|$|R

30|$|The {{analysis}} of 244 projects in our ten training classes from 2009 to 2012 shows that 164 {{of the projects}} are related to operating contradiction solving, which is 67.2 % of the total numbers. The number shows {{that there are many}} contradictions in innovation processes in <b>companies</b> <b>of</b> china, which is the answer <b>of</b> Q 1. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>companies</b> <b>of</b> developed countries (Imoh et al. 2011), the number is 30 of the 40 respondents who use the tool of contradiction solving. The frequencies applying contradiction-solving method <b>of</b> TRIZ both <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>companies</b> <b>of</b> developed countries and in China are similar. We find the truth that innovation type originated from the most engineers or researchers in various workplaces in companies is incremental innovation. To identify and solve operating contradictions in companies are driving forces for the processes of incremental innovations in companies in China.|$|R

5|$|Fieldfares often nest {{in small}} colonies, {{possibly}} {{for protection from}} predators. The nest is built in a tree where five or six eggs are laid.

5|$|In 1323, Roger Mortimer, who {{had been}} held in captivity in the Tower of London, escaped and fled to France. Two years later, Queen Isabella {{travelled}} to Paris on an embassy to the French king. Here, Isabella and Mortimer developed a plan to invade England and replace Edward II on the throne with his son, the young Prince Edward, who was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> <b>of</b> Isabella. Isabella and Mortimer landed in England on 24 September 1326, and due to the virulent resentment against the Despenser regime, few came to the king's aid. Arundel initially escaped the invading force <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> <b>of</b> the king, but was later dispatched to his estates in Shropshire to gather troops. At Shrewsbury he was captured by his old enemy John Charlton of Powys, and brought to Queen Isabella at Hereford. On 17 November– the day after Edward II had been taken captive– Arundel was executed, allegedly on the instigation of Mortimer. According to a chronicle account, {{the use of a}} blunt sword was ordered, and the executioner needed 22 strokes to sever the earl's head from his body.|$|E
