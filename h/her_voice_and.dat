5|$|Before, Beyoncé's {{approach}} to heartbreak was always literal, <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>and</b> her words declaiming her feelings with a studied earnestness {{that at times}} was difficult to believe, let alone connect with. 'Irreplaceable' is the first song in which Beyoncé lies to herself, and the way her voice perfectly betrays that lie (revealing a giveaway tremble in the stiff upper lip of the lyrics) simultaneously renders it her most sophisticated and her most honest performance to date.|$|E
5|$|Discovering that Talbot {{has already}} confiscated the painting, Coulson agrees {{to meet with}} him after {{debriefing}} his team. Meanwhile, May follows Talbot, who is actually Hydra agent Sunil Bakshi using advanced technology to take on Talbot's voice and appearance. May is attacked by Agent 33, a former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent brainwashed into Hydra's service, who knocks May unconscious and uses the same device to take on <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>and</b> appearance. Agent 33 goes to the Bus, a S.H.I.E.L.D. plane being used as a mobile command center, where she secretly plants a computer virus before meeting with Coulson. Further discussing his contingency plan, in which May would kill Coulson and replace him as Director of S.H.I.E.L.D., Coulson deduces that Agent 33 is not May and turns on her; this draws the attention of Bakshi, who was ready to torture May to gain S.H.I.E.L.D. secrets.|$|E
5|$|Warlock signed {{their first}} {{recording}} contract with Mausoleum Records and released their debut album Burning the Witches in 1984. Doro attracted immediately {{the attention of}} fans and press, becoming the spokesperson and the main means of promotion for the band. The mix of traditional heavy metal and power ballads, together with <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>and</b> stage presence led Warlock to success, an exception in the 80s' metal scene dominated by male-fronted metal bands. Warlock signed a new contract with the major label Phonogram and released the albums Hellbound in 1985 and True as Steel in 1986, sharing the stage of European rock festivals {{with some of the}} best hard rock and heavy metal bands of the period. On 16 August 1986, Doro was the first woman to front a metal band at the Monsters of Rock festival in Castle Donington, England, the most important European rock meeting of the 80s. Warlock's long tours in Europe, supporting W.A.S.P. and Judas Priest, pushed Doro to give up her day job as a graphic designer to devote her life to music. In this period she also received vocal coaching.|$|E

25|$|Pathé gave Morse the {{opportunity}} to indulge in a level of experimentation, not only by recording her own songs, but also through {{the opportunity}} to explore the limits of her vocal abilities.

25|$|Brandy {{credited}} Whitney Houston, Kim Burrell and Enya for inspiring her to {{push the}} limits of <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>and</b> vocal arrangements. With Brandy {{in a relationship with}} one of the album's primary musicians, its lyrical concepts centered on both sensual and frustrated feelings toward a lover. Jerkins credited Michael Jackson, Brandy's voice, and his experiences at European nightclubs for influencing the sound of the album. Lyrically, the album speaks on love in all its forms. Musically, Full Moon drew inspiration from UK garage, electro, dance, glitch, and funktronica, while blending soul and R elements into adult contemporary ballads.|$|E

Sara implanted a copy of her consciousness into the house, and it lived with <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>and</b> mind and memories for over a century. Even after the civilization around it collapsed, the house lived on, a mysterious anomaly to the de-civilized humans. Many feared it, but some would explore it and Sara would make them comfortable and grant their wishes.|$|E
25|$|As a small girl, she {{travelled}} {{with her}} family to London, New York (where her father, mother, brother and sister gave the first performance of Mozart's Don Giovanni in the United States, {{in the presence of}} the librettist, Lorenzo Da Ponte) and Mexico. By the age of six she was fluent in Spanish, French, English and Italian; later in her career, she sang Russian arias so well that she was taken for a native speaker. After her father's death in 1832, her mother, soprano Joaquina Sitchez, took over her singing lessons, and forced her to focus her attention on <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>and</b> away from the piano.|$|E
25|$|By {{the age of}} ten, Nouhad {{was already}} known at school for her unusual singing voice. She would sing {{regularly}} during school shows and on holidays. This was how {{she came to the}} attention of Mohammed Flayfel, a well known musician and a teacher at the Lebanese Conservatory, who happened to attend one of the school's shows in February 1950. Impressed by <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>and</b> performance, he advised her to enroll in the conservatory, which she did. At first, Nouhad's conservative father was reluctant to send her to the conservatory; however, he eventually allowed her to go on condition that her brother accompany her. That having been said, Nouhad's family as a whole encouraged her in her musical career.|$|E

25|$|Boag {{was born}} in Portland, Oregon, in 1920 to Evelyn G. and Wallace B. Boag. He joined a {{professional}} dance team at age nine, later established his own dance school, and {{by the age of}} 19 had turned to comedy. He toured the world's stages in hotels, theaters and nightclubs. While appearing at the London Hippodrome in Starlight Roof, he brought a young 12-year-old girl on stage to help with his balloon act. The girl, a young Julie Andrews, astonished the audience with <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>and</b> was kept in the show. In 1945, Boag signed a contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and appeared in films such as Without Love and Thrill of a Romance, in credited roles.|$|E
25|$|Mohammed Fleyfel took a close {{interest}} in Nouhad's talent. Among other things, he {{taught her to}} recite verses from the Koran (in the recitative style known as Tajweed). On one occasion, Nouhad was heard singing by Halim el Roumi, head of the Lebanese radio station and a prominent musician {{in his own right}} (also the father of the famous Lebanese singer Majida Roumi). Roumi was impressed by <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>and</b> noticed that it had a rare flexibility that allowed her to sing both Arabic and Western modes admirably. At Nouhad's request, El Roumi appointed her as a chorus singer at the radio station in Beirut and went on to compose several songs for her. He chose for her the stage name Fairuz, which is the Arabic word for turquoise.|$|E
25|$|Diez {{was born}} in Munich and {{received}} her early training from her father who was a musician in the city. In 1836 she joined the chorus of the Munich Hofoper where the conductor Franz Lachner noticed the beauty of <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>and</b> gave her further training. She made her debut as a soloist on 1 December 1836 as Angelina in Cherubini's The Water Carrier and in February of the following year appeared as Benjamin in Étienne Méhul's Joseph. Shortly thereafter she was engaged as permanent member of the company. She went on to sing many leading roles with the Hofoper and appeared in several world premieres. By 1867, she had sung 122 roles in 94 operas, including all the female roles (apart from Marcellina) in The Marriage of Figaro and all six female roles in The Magic Flute.|$|E
