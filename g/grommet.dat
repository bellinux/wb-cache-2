He finds Bodhi and <b>Grommet</b> and chases them on the climb, but <b>Grommet</b> falters, falling to his death. Utah catches up to Bodhi, but he falls backward down the waterfall, completing what would have been the last ordeal; Bodhi has to redo the fourth ordeal because he bailed out on the wave when he chose to save Johnny. Seventeen months later, Utah finds him in the Pacific facing another giant wave. As Utah tries to get Bodhi to come back with him and pay for his crimes, he eventually lets Bodhi attempt to surf it, both knowing that he will not come back. The wave engulfs Bodhi, and Utah continues his career in the FBI and begins going through his own eight ordeals.|$|E

Bodhi escapes because Utah cannot stand up after the crash. The FBI freezes Bodhi's sponsors' assets; Bodhi plans to rob a nearby Italian bank on a mountain top. Utah and the police intercept the group, resulting in a crossfire that kills Roach.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: <b>Grommets</b> may be {{considered}} as the treatment of choice for otitis media with effusion (OME) in children born with a cleft. But the timing and precise indications to use them are not well established. The aim {{of the study is}} to compare the results of hearing and speech controls at three and six year-old in children born with total cleft or cleft palate in the presence or not of <b>grommets.</b> METHODS: This retrospective study concerns non syndromic children born between 1994 and 2006 and operated for a unilateral cleft lip palate (UCLP) or a cleft palate (CP) alone, by one surgeon with the same schedule of operations (Malek procedure). We compared the results of clinical observation, tympanometry, audiometry and nasometry at three and six year-old. The Borel-Maisonny classification was used to evaluate the velar insufficiency. None of the children had preventive <b>grommets.</b> The Fisher Exact Test was used for statistical analysis with p< 0. 05 considered as significant. RESULTS: Seventy-seven patients were analyzed in both groups. Abnormal hearing status was statistically more frequent in children with UCLP compared to children with CP, at three and six years (respectively, 80 - 64 %, p< 0. 03 and 78 - 60 %, p< 0. 02), with the use of <b>grommets</b> at six years in 43 % of cases in both groups. Improvement of hearing status between three and six year-old was present in 5 % of children with UCLP and 9 % with CP, without the use of <b>grommets.</b> CONCLUSION: The use of <b>grommets</b> between three and six year-old was not associated to any improvement of hearing status or speech results children with UCLP or with CP, with a low risk of tympanosclerosis. These results favor the use of <b>grommets</b> before the age of three, taking into account the risk of long term tympanosclerosis...|$|R

The brass badge had the GRETSCH logo in block letters above the <b>grommet.</b> The GRETSCH logo below the <b>grommet</b> was placed upside down {{to allow for the}} varied positioning of the toms. U.S.A. was on the left and right side of the <b>grommet</b> with the left U.S.A. letters upside down.

2500|$|... 1883 to 1971 - The {{original}} Gretsch Round Badge design. This was {{the first}} badge used on Gretsch drums {{going all the way}} back to 1883. The badge was round with GRETSCH written across the top and DRUM MAKERS SINCE 1883 along the bottom. The Round Badge was attached to snare drums and bass drums using a standard brass <b>grommet</b> which also provided a vent-hole for the drum, but it was attached to tom-toms using a carpenter's upholstery tack which therefore left those drums unvented. Final production of Gretsch drums with the Round Badge was in 1971.|$|E

40|$|There is {{a paucity}} of {{evidence}} to guide the management of otitis media with effusion (OME), which is a common problem causing significant hearing impairment in children with cleft palate. The insertion of <b>grommets</b> is currently being used to correct hearing impairment and prevent complications of unmanaged OME, but there is ongoing discussion about whether the benefits of <b>grommets</b> outweigh the costs and risks. A decision-tree model was developed to assess the surgical insertion of <b>grommets</b> with two non-surgical alternatives (hearing-aids and do-nothing strategies) in cleft palate children with persistent bilateral OME. The model assumed a 2 -year time horizon and a UK National Health Service perspective. Outcomes were valued using quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) estimated by linking utility values with potential hearing gains measured in decibels. Multiple data sources were used, including reviews of the clinical effectiveness, resource use and utility literature, and supplemented with expert opinion. Uncertainty in the model parameters was assessed using probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Expected value of perfect information {{analysis was used to}} calculate the potential value of future research. The results from the probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated that the <b>grommets</b> strategy was associated with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of £ 9, 065 per QALY gained compared with the do-nothing strategy, and the hearing-aids strategy was extended dominated by the <b>grommets</b> strategy. The population expected value of perfect information was £ 5, 194, 030 at a willingness to pay threshold of £ 20, 000 per QALY, implying that future research could be potentially worthwhile. This study found some evidence that the insertion of <b>grommets</b> to manage cleft palate children with bilateral OME is likely to be cost-effective, but further research is required to inform this treatment choice...|$|R

2500|$|The wingsuit flying {{sequence}} {{which is}} notably {{the most dangerous}} stunt in the film was filmed in Walenstadt, Switzerland and required five stuntmen (including the cameraman) flying in formation, while all weaved through narrow mountain passes, {{one of which is}} called [...] "The Crack", all at a speed of over 145 miles per hour. The production canceled planned flights on a number of days because of poor weather conditions, eventually completing it only after two weeks in August 2014. Core brought in Jeb Corliss, a professional sky diver, to help coordinate the scene and handpick wingsuit athletes to perform the stunt. Corliss and his team picked the best wingsuit pilots in the world, who have all made over 17,000 sky dives and have had 20 years of experience, including one thousand BASE jumps and thousands of wingsuit jumps each, to perform the jump. Corliss himself was {{going to be one of}} the fliers, but was not able to be, because he was recovering from a knee surgery after he tore his anterior cruciate ligament prior to the filming, while testing a suit. The five fliers includes two times World Wingsuit League champion and four times Guinness World Records holder Jhonathan Florez (cameraman, who died in July 2015), Red Bull Air Force former manager Jon DeVore (portrayed Utah), who previously worked on the wingsuit sequence for , and served as the aerial coordinator, Mike Swanson (Bodhi), Julian Boulle (<b>Grommet),</b> Noah Bahnson (Roach), and James Boole. DeVore knew that the sequence was going to be difficult to enact, especially in supertight, choreographed formations.
