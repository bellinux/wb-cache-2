It {{was only one of}} the two large tumuli that contained a chamber tomb, but both barrows, the church and the two Jelling stones testify to how <b>important</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> mark death ritually during the pagan era and the earliest Christian times.|$|E
500|$|The {{top three}} drivers {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and in the subsequent press conference. Michael Schumacher broke into tears when asked if matching Ayrton Senna's number of victories {{meant a lot to}} him. He later regained his composure and spoke about how <b>important</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> maintain the life of the engine at the circuit. Michael Schumacher revealed that the cause of his emotion was of him thinking about Senna's death at the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix and said that he was surprised at how the media reacted to the moment which said that Schumacher [...] "was human after all". Häkkinen revealed that his team made modifications to his car at his pit stop which contributed to him setting the fastest lap of the race. He also admitted that he was unable to catch Michael Schumacher due to the presence of the two Minardis which cost him time. Ralf Schumacher said he was not worried from being challenged by Verstappen and Zonta during the event because of the Williams's quick pace. He also was confident that Williams had confirmed itself as the third strongest team in Formula One.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{have argued}} that the anthem is too male-centric. Lyrics such as [...] "Our manhood we pledge to thy liberty" [...] suggest the song was {{originally}} intended to be sung only by men. Amandala correspondent Naomi Burn suggested that [...] "manhood" [...] be replaced by [...] "honour" [...] so that the lyrics would have more relevance for women. It has also been noted that women are never mentioned in the anthem, only men. A 1998 survey of approximately 2,000 Belizean women asked how <b>important</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> include women in the national anthem. 14.6% answered [...] "most important", 19.7% answered [...] "somewhat important", and 63.4% answered [...] "not very important".|$|E

60|$|Conscious of the disorderly {{appearance}} {{of her own}} dress after the adventure of the preceding night, and of the grotesque habit and demeanour of her guide, and sensible how <b>important</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> secure an attentive and impatient audience to her strange story from some one who might {{have the means to}} protect her, Jeanie readily acquiesced in Madge's proposal to rest under the trees, by which they were still somewhat screened, until the commencement of service should give them an opportunity of entering the hamlet without attracting a crowd around them. She made the less opposition, that Madge had intimated that this was not the village where her mother was in custody, and that the two squires of the pad were absent in a different direction.|$|E
6000|$|There was Mr. Balls, {{the great}} grocer of South Audley Street, a warm man, who, they say, had his twenty {{thousand}} pounds; Jack Snaffle, of the mews hard by, a capital fellow for a song; Clinker, the ironmonger: all married gentlemen, {{and in the}} best line of business; Tressle, the undertaker, etc. No liveries were admitted into the room, as may be imagined, but one or two select butlers and major-domos joined the circle; for the persons composing it knew very well how <b>important</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> be on good terms with these gentlemen and many a time my lord's account {{would never have been}} paid, and my lady's large order never have been given, but for the conversation which took place at the [...] "Bootjack," [...] and the friendly intercourse subsisting between {{all the members of the}} society.|$|E

But she said nothing of this--she only {{repeated}} her question: aware that she was exasperating to her sister but also aware {{that she could not}} be anything else. Mrs. Berrington, whose maid, having outlived surprises, had gone to rest, began to divest herself of some of her ornaments, and it was not till after a moment, during which she stood before the glass, that she made that answer about doing as she had always done. To this Laura rejoined that she ought to put herself in her place enough to feel how <b>important</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> her to know what was likely to happen, so that she might take time by the forelock and think of her own situation. If anything should happen she would infinitely rather be out of it--be as far away as possible. Therefore she must take her measures.|$|E

60|$|And now the French King, who {{was very}} proud of his young wife, was {{preparing}} for many years of happiness, and she was looking forward, I dare say, to many years of misery, when he died within three months, and left her a young widow. The new French monarch, FRANCIS THE FIRST, seeing how <b>important</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> his interests that she should take for her second husband no one but an Englishman, advised her first lover, the Duke of Suffolk, when King Henry sent him over to France to fetch her home, to marry her. The Princess being herself so fond of that Duke, as to tell him that he must either do so then, or for ever lose her, they were wedded; and Henry afterwards forgave them. In making interest with the King, the Duke of Suffolk had addressed his most powerful favourite and adviser, THOMAS WOLSEY--a name very famous in history for its rise and downfall.|$|E
60|$|But {{though this}} {{movement}} produced the immediate effect which was designed, {{it led to}} ill consequences, which Nelson foresaw, but for want of sufficient force was unable to prevent. His squadron was {{too small for the}} service which it had to perform. He required two seventy-fours and eight or ten frigates and sloops; but when he demanded this reinforcement, Admiral Hotham had left the command. Sir Hyde Parker had succeeded till the new commander should arrive; and he immediately reduced it to almost nothing, leaving him only one frigate and a brig. This was a fatal error. While the Austrian and Sardinian troops, whether from the imbecility or the treachery of their leaders, remained inactive, the French were preparing for the invasion of Italy. Not many days before Nelson was thus summoned to Genoa, he chased a large convoy into Alassio. Twelve vessels he had formerly destroyed in that port, though 2000 French troops occupied the town. This former attack had made them take new measures of defence; and there were now above 100 sail of victuallers, gun-boats, and ships of war. Nelson represented to the Admiral how <b>important</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> destroy these vessels; and offered, with his squadron of frigates, and the CULLODEN and COURAGEUX, to lead himself in the AGAMEMNON, and take or destroy the whole. The attempt was not permitted; but it was Nelson's belief that, if it had been made, it would have prevented the attack upon the Austrian army, which took place almost immediately afterwards.|$|E
6000|$|Pass {{from the}} closest of all differences, that between husband and wife, {{to the most}} distant of all differences, that of the remote and {{unrelated}} races who have seldom seen each other's faces, and never been tinged with each other's blood. Here we still find the same unvarying Prussian principle. Any European might feel a genuine fear of the Yellow Peril; and many Englishmen, Frenchmen, and Russians have felt and expressed it. Many might say, and have said, that the Heathen Chinee is very heathen indeed; that if he ever advances against us he will trample and torture and utterly destroy, {{in a way that}} Eastern people do, but Western people do not. Nor do I doubt the German Emperor's sincerity when he sought to point out to us how abnormal and abominable such a nightmare campaign would be, supposing that it could ever come. But now comes the comic irony; which never fails to follow on the attempt of the Prussian to be philosophic. For the Kaiser, after explaining to his troops how <b>important</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> avoid Eastern Barbarism, instantly commanded them to become Eastern Barbarians. He told them, in so many words, to be Huns: and leave nothing living or standing behind them. In fact, he frankly offered a new army corps of aboriginal Tartars to the Far East, within such time as it may take a bewildered Hanoverian to turn into a Tartar. Any one who has the painful habit of personal thought, will perceive here at once the non-reciprocal principle again. Boiled down to its bones of logic, it means simply this: [...] "I am a German and you are a Chinaman. Therefore I, being a German, {{have a right to be}} a Chinaman. But you have no right to be a Chinaman; because you are only a Chinaman." [...] This is probably the highest point to which the German culture has risen.|$|E
