He labeled the company's retail pricing of Year Zero in Australia as [...] "ABSURD", concluding that [...] "as a reward for being a 'true fan' you get ripped off". Reznor {{went on to say}} that he hated Interscope, and in later years the [...] "climate" [...] of record labels may have an increasingly ambivalent <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> <b>consumers</b> who buy music. Reznor's post, specifically his criticism of the recording industry at large, elicited considerable media attention.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) had {{to approve the}} deal and ensure {{that there was no}} {{negative}} <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> <b>consumers</b> from Dynegy's expanding market share in the Midwest. But on April 16, FERC said that the studies submitted by Dynegy and Ameren were inadequate, and it ordered the two firms to rerun the studies and report back to FERC by July 14. On July 16, FERC again declined to approve or disapprove the Dynegy-Ameren deal. The agency said that it Dynegy's study showed it charging market rates for energy in the Midwest. But FERC said it worried that transmission bottlenecks in the area would permit Dynegy to charge much more. [...] Furthermore, federal regulators were considering an expansion in the market area IPH could serve. FERC asked Dynegy to provide additional information on transmission limitations and market area expansion. In August, the Sierra Club formally filed opposition to the Dynegy-Ameren deal. The environmental group said the transmission bottleneck issue gave Dynegy too much market power. It also argued that Dynegy and Ameren had submitted only regional market power data, and had not accounted for local impacts (which could be very severe).|$|E

As the general public have {{become aware of the}} importance of protecting the environment, consumers have started to evidence a marked preference for green products. This study constructed a model describing the relationships among perceived benefit of green consumption behavior, perceived risk, moral responsibility, normative belief, control strength, control belief, attitude, subjective norms, behavior control, behavior intention, and actual behavior. An analysis of 560 valid questionnaires resulted in six main findings: (1) Perceived benefit of green consumption has a significantly positive <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> <b>consumer</b> attitude. (2) Perceived risk of green consumption has a significantly negative <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> <b>consumer</b> attitude. (3) Normative belief and moral responsibility both have significantly positive <b>impacts</b> <b>on</b> <b>consumer</b> subjective norms. (4) Control strength and control belief both have significantly positive <b>impacts</b> <b>on</b> <b>consumer</b> behavior control. (5) Attitude, subjective norms and behavior control both have significantly positive <b>impacts</b> <b>on</b> <b>consumer</b> behavior intention.

40|$|While {{research}} has shown the positive impact of sensory cues and cue- congruency on emotion and behavior in retail store atmospheres, these cues have primarily been investigated in isolation or in pairs. Consequently, little is known on how multi-sensory cues in interplay <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> <b>consumer</b> emotions and purchase behaviors. In addition, {{research has}} not yet provided any clear conceptualization of congruency in marketing when designing retail store atmospheres, other than stating that some cues are expected to match, therefore become pleasantly perceived. Thus, {{the main purpose of}} this research is to examine and show how multi-sensory cues in interplay and congruency can be utilized in creating a retail store atmosphere to enhance consumer emotions and purchase behaviors. To address the purpose, a sequential method was adopted with four essays. The first essay explores multi-sensory interplay in marketing contexts with a literature review that forms the basis for a research agenda. The second essay employs focus groups to highlight the congruency between cues, products and the retail setting, and identifies which category of cues is in need of investigation. The third essay uses field experiments to investigate two congruent visual, auditory and olfactory cues (six cues in total) in a retail setting, and their <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> <b>consumer</b> emotion and purchase behavior. The final essay, also use field experiments to examine and duplicate one cue from each sense, and employs these together in interplay, to show how multi-sensory cues in interplay impacts emotions and purchase behaviors. This research concludes that multi-sensory cues in interplay in a retail store atmosphere have a greater <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> <b>consumer</b> emotions and purchase behaviors than single visual, auditory and olfactory setting-congruent sensory cues. Among single sensory cues, those perceived as complementary in the atmosphere, specifically auditory and olfactory in an already visual dominated atmosphere, have the largest <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> <b>consumer</b> emotions and purchase behaviors. Overall, this research signifies that congruent multi-sensory cues in interplay emerge as reliable predictors for the influence <b>on</b> <b>consumer</b> arousal, valence, time spent, touching, browsing and purchasing Theoretical and managerial implications are discussed. ...|$|R
