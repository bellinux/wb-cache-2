40|$|Insulation {{deterioration}} is {{an increasing}} problem with the age of high voltage apparatus and current deregulation circumstance. Partial discharge (PD) measurement {{has been used for}} insulation assessment for many years. It has been arguably {{recognized as one of the}} most effective diagnosis tool for insulation condition monitoring. However, on site partial discharge measurement is often affected by excessive electromagnetic interference (EMI). This makes it very difficult to interpret data for insulation assessment purpose. The <b>differential</b> <b>circuit</b> was adopted by power supply industry to reject common mode interference a long time ago. However for on site partial discharge measurement, the <b>differential</b> <b>circuit</b> is still very hard to implement for reliable operation. In practice, it would be difficult to find two sensors with matching electrical characteristics so that they can be used to cancel the common mode interference.

Interference and true partial discharge signal could be distinguished by analyzing their polarities and the correlation coefficients.

40|$|Long {{test times}} {{and the use of}} {{conventional}} automatic test equipment (ATE) makes conventional mixed-signal linearity performance testing costly. Diminishing test time of linearity test significantly reduces system-on-a-chip production test costs and, therefore, lessens total product manufacturing costs. Several low-cost linearity test methods have addressed this issue for a single-ended mixed-signal circuit testing. On the other hand, a low-cost test approach has rarely been proposed for <b>differential</b> mixed-signal <b>circuits,</b> due to a new class of test obstacles from <b>differential</b> <b>circuits</b> that are widely employed for high-speed I/O products.
