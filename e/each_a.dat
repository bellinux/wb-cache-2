5|$|After the Battle of Leros, New Zealand withdrew its {{squadron}} {{from the}} Long Range Desert Group, compelling the LRDG to reorganise itself into two squadrons of eight patrols <b>each.</b> <b>A</b> Squadron {{was composed of}} Rhodesians and B Squadron comprised British troops and a squadron of signallers; around 80 of the officers and men were from Southern Rhodesia. The group was reassigned from the Middle East Command to the Central Mediterranean Force in early 1944, and deployed to the Gargano peninsula in south-eastern Italy, where a new LRDG headquarters was set up near the seaside town of Rodi. Britain hoped to compel the Germans to commit as many divisions as possible to south-eastern Europe so {{they could not be}} used on the more important fronts closer to Germany. In June 1944 the LRDG was assigned to operate on the western coast of Yugoslavia, with orders to set up observation posts, report the movements of German ships and undertake minor raids.|$|E
5|$|Alistair Campbell of Zimbabwe was {{the first}} to score a century in the tournament when he made 100 against New Zealand during the inaugural edition. Four players—Sourav Ganguly (India), Herschelle Gibbs (South Africa), Chris Gayle (West Indies) and Shikhar Dhawan (India)—hold the record for the most number of centuries with three <b>each.</b> <b>A</b> further four players—Saeed Anwar (Pakistan), Marcus Trescothick (England), Upul Tharanga (Sri Lanka) and Shane Watson (Australia)—have scored two centuries. Gayle's three centuries in 2006 is a record for any player in a single edition. New Zealand's Nathan Astle's 145 against the United States remains the highest {{individual}} score as of 2017. Jacques Kallis' (South Africa) 113 not out against Sri Lanka in 1998, Ganguly's 141 not out against South Africa in 2000, and Chris Cairns' (New Zealand) 102 not out against India in the same tournament feature in the top 100 ODI innings of all-time by a list released by the Wisden Cricketers' Almanack in 2002.|$|E

5|$|Both {{environmental}} factors and genetics {{are associated with}} alcoholism with about half the risk attributed to <b>each.</b> <b>A</b> person with a parent or sibling with alcoholism is {{three to four times}} more likely to be alcoholic themselves. Environmental factors include social, cultural, and behavioral influences. High stress levels, anxiety, as well as inexpensive easily accessible alcohol increases risk. People may continue to drink partly to prevent or improve symptoms of withdrawal. A low level of withdrawal may last for months following stopping. Medically, alcoholism is considered both a physical and mental illness. Both questionnaires and certain blood tests may detect people with possible alcoholism. Further information is then collected to confirm the diagnosis.|$|E

5|$|In the {{original}} Holliday model for homologous recombination, single-strand breaks {{occur at the}} same point on one strand of each parental DNA. Free ends of each broken strand then migrate across to the other DNA helix. There, the invading strands are joined to the free ends they encounter, resulting in the Holliday junction. As each crossover strand reanneals to its original partner strand, it displaces {{the original}} complementary strand ahead of it. This causes the Holliday junction to migrate, creating the heteroduplex segments. Depending on which strand was used as a template to repair the other, the four cells resulting from meiosis might end up with three copies of one allele and only one of the other, instead of the normal two of <b>each,</b> <b>a</b> property known as gene conversion.|$|E
