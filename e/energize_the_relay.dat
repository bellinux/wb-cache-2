The circuit includes an operational amplifier having a feedback circuit connected between an output terminal and an input terminal; a bank of relays operably connected to a plurality of resistors; and a comparator comparing an output voltage of the amplifier with a reference voltage and generating a compared signal responsive thereto. Means is provided for selectively <b>energizing</b> <b>the</b> <b>relays</b> according to <b>the</b> compared signal from the comparator until the output signal from the amplifier equals to the reference signal.

40|$|Unlike {{any other}} battery charger, {{this project is}} about the {{combination}} of battery charger circuit with alarm circuit. The main objective of this project is the alarm will send signal to the user. Thus, the user will know that the batteries are already fully charged. It consists of 3 segments, the power supply, charging circuit and alarm circuit. In this project, the charging process is focus more on AA batteries. The heart of the circuit located at LM 324. It is the segment that controlling the charging process of the whole circuit. 2 pins are required. First pin (pin 12) is for Upper Limit Set, while the second pin (pin 9) is for lower limit set. This both pin sending the signal as a reference value. The upper limit send an information that the batteries is overcharged while the lower limit send the information about batteries deep discharge. Both of them are controlled by a potentiometer. When this is happen, the LM 324 will send signal to the transistor. This transistor than operates thus <b>energizes</b> <b>the</b> <b>relay</b> coil. When <b>the</b> <b>relay</b> retracted, <b>the</b> charging process is halt {{and at the same}} time, operates the buzzer. The buzzer will continue to ring until the charger is turn off...|$|R
50|$|A {{combination}} of these methods was possible. A set of relays were continuously powered by the power supply. The common-audible ringing signals from the KSU would run though <b>the</b> <b>energized</b> <b>relays</b> to certain phones that would also ring {{if there was a}} power failure. The phone lines that terminated at the KSU were also terminated at these <b>relays</b> and in <b>the</b> event of a power failure, <b>the</b> <b>relays</b> would de-energize and switch the phone lines to the ringers of selected phones.|$|R
50|$|Since <b>relays</b> are switches, <b>the</b> {{terminology}} {{applied to}} switches is also applied to relays; a relay switches {{one or more}} poles, each of whose contacts can be thrown by <b>energizing</b> <b>the</b> coil. Normally open (NO) contacts connect the circuit when <b>the</b> <b>relay</b> is activated; <b>the</b> circuit is disconnected when <b>the</b> <b>relay</b> is inactive. Normally closed (NC) contacts disconnect the circuit when <b>the</b> <b>relay</b> is activated; <b>the</b> circuit is connected when <b>the</b> <b>relay</b> is inactive. All of the contact forms involve combinations of NO and NC connections.|$|R
50|$|The {{simplest}} type of {{burglar alarm}} control {{consists of a}} single relay. In this type, the sensor circuit (called the loop in industrial terminology) holds <b>the</b> <b>relay</b> <b>energized.</b> Since <b>the</b> path for the loop goes {{through a set of}} contacts which are normally open (when <b>the</b> <b>relay</b> is restored they are open, when <b>the</b> <b>relay</b> is <b>energized</b> they are closed), when the loop opens, even momentarily, <b>the</b> <b>relay</b> will drop out and stay that way. A second set of contacts on <b>the</b> <b>relay,</b> normally closed (when <b>the</b> <b>relay</b> is restored they are closed, when <b>the</b> <b>relay</b> is <b>energized</b> they are open) is used to operate the annunciator, usually a bell. The system is disarmed by a key-operated shunt which forces <b>the</b> <b>relay</b> to <b>energize,</b> and is armed by closing all traps and then by opening the shunt. While burglar alarm controls are now very elaborate, the single-relay control incorporates all the functionality of any control. These controls and a closely related dual-relay design are still widely used in stand-alone applications, powered by lead-acid batteries.|$|R
5000|$|Comparing. Simple {{comparing}} circuits had two entries and one exit that emitted a pulse whenever pulses {{arrived at the}} entries at different times. Some machines, e.g. collators, could detect which number was higher {{if they were not}} equal. A tabulating machine might compare the account number on successive cards and print a total when a new account number appeared. For the compare function, IBM implemented what would now be called an XOR gate using opposing electromagnets. If neither magnet was energized or both magnets were <b>energized</b> at <b>the</b> same time, <b>the</b> <b>relay</b> armature would not move. If only one magnet was <b>energized,</b> <b>the</b> armature would move and touch one of two contacts placed on either side. The two contacts were wired together internally and connected to an exit hub that indicated an unequal comparison.|$|R
40|$|Abstract––The {{analysis}} of a modelled differential protection <b>relay</b> is presented. <b>The</b> mathematical model was first developed from where diagrams were produced. A different approach {{in dealing with the}} instability problem caused by switching in-rush current in transformers- „The voltage restraint method‟, is also presented. In this paper, a stability logic circuit was modelled to block the operation of <b>the</b> <b>relay</b> under “unreal fault ” conditions. Tests and simulations show that <b>the</b> <b>relay</b> responds within 10 milliseconds; and an appreciable output was obtained at the differential current as low as 0. 01 Ampere while at the differential current of 0 Amp (no differential current) <b>the</b> <b>relay</b> was stable. Keywords––Differential current, protection, restraining voltage, stability, current transformer. I. INTRDUCTION The differential relay‟s operation is based on the principles of Kirchoff‟s law which states that the sum of the currents in a node is zero. In the basic differential scheme, the currents in each phase are compared on the incoming and outgoing sides of the protected equipment. If they are not equal, the difference current is used to <b>energize</b> <b>the</b> operating coil of <b>the</b> <b>relay.</b> That implies that current transformers will be required at both sides of the equipment to facilitate the summation of currents as shown in fig 1.

5000|$|If {{there is}} a fault on the primary feeder, the {{substation}} circuit-breaker is meant to open, disconnecting the primary feeder from one side. The problem is that this primary cable is also connected to a network transformer, which is interconnected to other network transformers on its secondary side. The secondary network will <b>energize</b> <b>the</b> primary feeder through the network transformer. This can be very dangerous, because a fault {{will continue to be}} 'fed' from the secondary network side of transformer. Even without a fault, if the electric utility wants to perform maintenance on that primary cable, they must have a way to fully disconnect that primary cable, without worrying about <b>the</b> cable being <b>energized</b> by <b>the</b> secondary network through the network transformer. Thus, the network protector is designed to open its contacts if <b>the</b> <b>relay</b> senses backwards flowing current.|$|R
40|$|Abstract- It {{is quite}} common in modern relays to use a {{permanent}} magnet for assisting both <b>the</b> <b>energized</b> and <b>the</b> deenergized conditions. These magnets must maintain their strength under all temperature and vibration extremes seen by <b>the</b> <b>relay.</b> Loss of magnetic field strength could cause <b>the</b> <b>relay</b> to change key operating parameters. Recently, advances {{have been made in}} the development of permanent magnet materials. In particular, new techniques for fabricating the magnet alloys, as well as, fundamentally new materials. Some of the recent advances in SmCo magnets have demonstrated stable field strength into the range of 350 degrees C. In addition, some of these materials enable a designer to obtain a certain field strength with a great reduction in magnet volume and weight. This paper itemizes some of these new magnet materials and discusses their advantages and disadvantages...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} paper the main results of the {{pre-operational}} studies related to the energization maneuver of a Half-Wavelength Transmission Line (AC-Link), are presented. The simulations were performed in PSCAD with actual Brazilian system data. Specifically the following studies were performed: electromagnetic transient studies of energiza-tion maneuver considering no fault and the occurrence of fault along the trunk; dynamic analysis of generator units that will <b>energize</b> <b>the</b> AC-Link; TRV on the circuit-breaker that will <b>energize</b> <b>the</b> trunk. The main conclusion is that the AC-Link energization experiment can be implemented without jeopardizing or causing time-life reduction of the equipment involved in the experiment, which comprises the generator unit that will <b>energize</b> <b>the</b> trunk, the step-up transformer, the arresters that will be kept during the experiments, {{as well as the}} circuit-breaker that will energize and then trip the AC-Link...|$|R

In normal operation, the electric current in the fence wires causes a relay to <b>energize,</b> indicating that <b>the</b> fence is intact.
