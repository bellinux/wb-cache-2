The concept, definition and legal status of water resources are presented in the introduction, as the basis for an analysis of the possibility of <b>disposing</b> of, or limiting the disposal of, water resources. Further, an analysis is made of the basic characteristics of <b>disposing</b> of property rights in general, and of <b>disposing</b> of resources that are of interest to the Republic of Croatia and public property for common usage...|$|R

40|$|Ankara : The Department of Management, İhsan Doğramacı Bilkent Univ., 2013. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Bilkent University, 2013. Includes bibliographical refences. Recently, <b>disposing</b> has {{attracted}} lots of research attention. While some researchers frame <b>disposing</b> as {{a practice of}} ordering, identity management, and psychological relief, others associate it with overconsumption, waste of usable resources, and environmental hazard. Although <b>disposing</b> is related to such seemingly conflicting meanings and consumption practices, consumer researchers mostly bypass the broader structures, grand practices, and ideological and discursive meaning systems underlying <b>disposing</b> practices. Using ethnographic methods, this study explores <b>disposing</b> as a mundane practice, embedded in contexts with socio-cultural, economic, historical, and political dimensions. The research aims to reveal when and how consumers practice <b>disposing</b> by highlighting the normative and ideological structures that help constructing these practices. It also aims {{to shed light on}} how <b>disposing</b> might relate to other consumption practices. The results depict <b>disposing</b> as embedded in four meta-practices at the intersection of various tensions and ideologies feeding these. Steeped in these grand discourses of consumption, <b>disposing</b> helps moralizing consumption and allows consumers to experience morality without standing against consumerism or adopting new lifestyles. Rather than just facilitating consumer resistance, <b>disposing</b> also helps consumers to compromise with the market. The results complicate the linear framing of consuming as acquiring-using-disposing by highlighting how <b>disposing</b> reflects on the object’s consumption and is constructive of its value. The study also reveals new practices through which consumers negotiate <b>disposing</b> and highlight a new dimension of object attachment. The results have important implications for the disposition, moral consumption, and value research. Türe, MeltemPh. D...|$|R
40|$|This report mainly {{talks about}} {{utilizing}} the cement kiln to <b>dispose</b> wastes. In China, {{there are huge}} amounts of wastes can be produced every year.

The cement kiln has a high temperature, long remaining time, and can solidify the heavy metals, <b>dispose</b> the solid, semi-solid or liquid wastes. To <b>dispose</b> the wastes in cement kiln will not cause the new emissions. In addition, it is cheaper than building the new incinerator plants. So utilizing the cement kiln is good way to <b>dispose</b> wastes in environment and economy. Now China has more than 600 NSP cement kilns.

5|$|Churchill fully tooled-up—that is, installed, {{assembled}} and made ready for productive use—the Gatling Gun factory {{that opened in}} Birmingham in 1889. This was despite being an undischarged bankrupt. He had formed a partnership with his son, Charles Henry Churchill, and in 1888 he obtained another partner when John William Wright Gabriel <b>disposed</b> of his family's interest in a drugs manufacturer, Gabriel and Troke, and joined the Churchills. This partnership may explain how {{he was able to}} complete the work in Birmingham despite his financial status. Despite the assertion by biographer David Jeremy that J W W Gabriel <b>disposed</b> of the drugs manufacturing interest, a notice in The London Gazette for 1885 shows his father, John Wild Gabriel, ending a partnership with Troke, and that Troke then formed a similar arrangement with another person.|$|E
