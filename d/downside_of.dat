25|$|One <b>downside</b> <b>of</b> using neutral {{buoyancy}} to simulate microgravity is the {{significant amount of}} drag presented by water. Generally, drag effects are minimized by doing tasks slowly in the water. Another <b>downside</b> <b>of</b> {{neutral buoyancy}} simulation is that astronauts are not weightless within their suits, thus, precise suit sizing is critical.|$|E
25|$|Synthesis of {{thalidomide}} has {{usually been}} performed {{as seen in}} scheme 1. This synthesis is a reasonably simplistic three step process. The <b>downside</b> <b>of</b> this process however is that the last step requires a high-temperature melt reaction which demands multiple recrystallizations and is not compliant with standard equipment.|$|E
25|$|The <b>downside</b> <b>of</b> this {{development}} is the ecological damage due to the low standards of production and excessive sizes of dams (the bigger projects were favoured by the industrial authorities and received more funding), the increased humidity sharpened the already hard climate. Another powerplant project on Katun River in Altai mountains in the 1980s, which was widely protested publicly, was cancelled.|$|E

Now, however, Japanese teams scout American Triple-A games and monitor MLB transactions, looking for players being shuttled {{back and forth between}} the minors and the majors. A good majority of American players recruited to play in NPB are power hitters, which traditionally are in short supply in Japan.|$|E
25|$|To give {{compiler}} vendors greater freedom, the C++ {{standards committee}} {{decided not to}} dictate the implementation of name mangling, exception handling, and other implementation-specific features. The <b>downside</b> <b>of</b> this decision is that object code produced by different compilers {{is expected to be}} incompatible. There were, however, attempts to standardize compilers for particular machines or operating systems (for example C++ ABI), though they seem to be largely abandoned now.|$|E
25|$|On 26 November 2007, Terra {{announced}} that {{they were willing to}} take the <b>downside</b> <b>of</b> the investments made in 2007 by the four Nordland municipalities, a total loss of NOK 150M. This would result in a net loss for the municipalities of NOK 150M. By 27 November the municipalities had rejected the offer. Local politicians in Narvik feared that they would be forced to sell the remaining stake in Narvik Energi if they could not extract themselves from the agreement with Terra.|$|E

25|$|Minamata disease {{attracted}} global {{attention in}} 1972 during the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment held in Stockholm. The official report {{presented to the}} Conference by the Japanese government {{did not mention the}} disease at all; this lack of honesty resulted in a second report being put together by Japanese citizens. Minamata disease patients were sent to Stockholm to hand in the citizens' report. Evidence of the misery caused by heavy environmental pollution revealed the <b>downside</b> <b>of</b> Japan's post-war rapid economic development to global public.|$|E
25|$|This {{process is}} also known as {{precision}} forging. It was developed to minimize cost and waste associated with post-forging operations. Therefore, the final product from a precision forging needs little or no final machining. Cost savings are gained from the use of less material, and thus less scrap, the overall decrease in energy used, and the reduction or elimination of machining. Precision forging also requires less of a draft, 1° to 0°. The <b>downside</b> <b>of</b> this process is its cost, therefore it is only implemented if significant cost reduction can be achieved.|$|E
25|$|Post-war {{tunnelling}} {{took place}} in less urgent circumstances and new, less damaging, tunnelling methods were used. Explosives were employed again but this time in smaller quantities, placed in drill holes bored {{into the face of}} the excavation. They were fired electrically in a sequence which began in the centre of the face and spread outwards, so that the centre would create a void into which the peripheral rock could fall. The <b>downside</b> <b>of</b> this method was that it created tunnels with jagged sides, as it fractured the limestone around the periphery of the excavation.|$|E

25|$|O. longistaminataas donor of perenniality traits. This African {{species is}} genetically diverse, {{strongly}} perennial and rhizomatous. Rhizomes {{may be able}} to survive and spread in drier conditions than stolons. The <b>downside</b> <b>of</b> this donor is that it is more distantly related to cultivated rice and the crosses and backcrosses are much more difficult to make. Descendents of the few successful crosses are mostly infertile, and few were perennial. Interestingly, many of the perennial plants lacked rhizomes. Rhizomes may not be essential for survival, but they may help plants survive stress and they certainly help them spread.|$|E
25|$|The <b>downside</b> <b>of</b> the new units was {{the more}} {{restricted}} view through the windows. The Mark 3 bodyshell has a much higher window sill level than the first generation DMUs and moreover the alignment of the windows with the seating positions is poor, a problem common to much Mk 3 derived stock. The view is especially poor for passengers seated nearest to the doors, whose view is obscured by the pockets into which the doors slide when opened, or {{at the ends of}} the vehicle. Also unlike the first generation DMUs, the rear of the driver's cab was not glazed, so passengers in the front seats no longer had a view of the track ahead, which was regretted both by railfans and children.|$|E
25|$|In sum, {{both systems}} are about 24 minutes per year {{ahead of the}} actual {{tropical}} year; the systems' methods of intercalation fixes only their internal error; and Thandeikta slightly accelerates the annual drift. The accumulating error means the New Year's Day which used to fall near the vernal equinox at its launch in 638 now falls on 17 April in 2013—a drift of 15 days, (after adjusting to the Julian and Gregorian calendar switch). Burmese calendarists {{have dealt with the}} issue by using apparent reckoning and periodically modifying the intercalation schedule in the Metonic cycle. One major <b>downside</b> <b>of</b> this approach {{is that it is not}} possible to publish future calendars more than a few years (often even a year) ahead.|$|E

25|$|For a long time, DSLRs offered {{faster and}} more {{responsive}} performance, with less shutter lag, faster autofocus systems, and higher frame rates. Around 2016-17, specific mirrorless camera models started offering competitive or superior specifications in these aspects. The <b>downside</b> <b>of</b> these cameras being {{that they do not}} have an optical viewfinder, making it difficult to focus on moving subjects or in situations where a fast burst mode would be beneficial. Other digital cameras were once significantly slower in image capture (time measured from pressing the shutter release to the writing of the digital image to the storage medium) than DSLR cameras, but this situation is changing with the introduction of faster capture memory cards and faster in-camera processing chips. Still, compact digital cameras are not suited for action, wildlife, sports and other photography requiring a high burst rate (frames per second).|$|E
25|$|The {{best thing}} {{was simply the}} {{privilege}} {{and the challenge of}} being able to take a shot at the first female captain, transcending stereotypes that I was very familiar with. I was able to do that in front of millions of viewers. That was a remarkable experience—and it continues to resonate. The <b>downside</b> <b>of</b> that is also that it continues to resonate, and threatens to eclipse all else in one's long career if one does not up the ante and stay at it, in a way that may not ordinarily be necessary. I have to work at changing and constantly reinventing myself in a way that probably would not have happened had Star Trek not come along. I knew that going in, and I think that all of the perks attached to this journey have been really inexpressively great. So the negatives are small.|$|E
25|$|Development {{continued}} in the US as well during the 1930s and mid-1930, the first inverting image intensifier was developed at RCA. This tube used an electrostatic inverter to focus an image from a spherical cathode onto a spherical screen. (The choice of spheres was to reduce off-axial aberrations.) Subsequent development of this technology led directly to the first Generation 0 image intensifiers which were used by the military during World War II to allow vision at night with infrared lighting for both shooting and personal night vision. The first military night vision device were introduced by the German army as early as 1939, developed since 1935. Early night vision devices based on these technologies were used by both sides in World War II. However, the <b>downside</b> <b>of</b> active night vision (when infrared light is used) {{is that it is}} quite obvious to anyone else using the technology.|$|E

50|$|<b>Downsides</b> <b>of</b> the Intel's lockstep memory layout are the {{reduction}} of effectively usable amount of RAM (in case of a triple-channel memory layout, maximum amount of memory reduces to {{one third of the}} physically available maximum), and reduced performance of the memory subsystem.|$|R
25|$|A non-trivial {{example of}} {{exploiting}} extra {{assumptions about the}} signal is given by the recent field of compressed sensing, which allows for full reconstruction with a sub-Nyquist sampling rate. Specifically, this applies to signals that are sparse (or compressible) in some domain. As an example, compressed sensing deals with signals that may have a low over-all bandwidth (say, the effective bandwidth EB), but the frequency locations are unknown, rather than all together in a single band, so that the passband technique doesn't apply. In other words, the frequency spectrum is sparse. Traditionally, the necessary sampling rate is thus 2B. Using compressed sensing techniques, the signal could be perfectly reconstructed if it is sampled at a rate slightly lower than 2EB. The <b>downside</b> <b>of</b> {{this approach is that}} reconstruction is no longer given by a formula, but instead by the solution to a convex optimization program which requires well-studied but nonlinear methods.|$|E
25|$|Most meters using Economy 7 {{switch the}} entire {{electricity}} {{supply to the}} cheaper rate during the 7 hour night time period, not just the storage heater circuit. The <b>downside</b> <b>of</b> {{this is that the}} daytime rate per kWh is significantly higher, and that standing charges are sometimes higher. For example, as of July 2017, normal ("single rate") electricity costs 17.14p per kWh in the London region on the standard default tariff for EDF Energy (the post-privatisation incumbent electricity supplier in London), with a standing charge of 18.90p per day. The equivalent Economy 7 costs are 21.34p per kWh during the peak usage period with 7.83p per kWh during the off-peak usage period, and a standing charge of 18.90p per day. Timer switches installed on washing machines, tumble dryers, dishwashers and immersion heaters may be set so that they only switch on during the off-peak usage period.|$|E
25|$|Each Survivor {{can carry}} one each of five {{categories}} of equipment: primary weapons, secondary weapons, throwable weapons, major medical supplies (which also includes ammunition upgrades) and minor medical supplies. Primary weapons are {{broken down into}} four tiers based on their availability and attributes. Tier one weapons (such as the SMG and Chrome Shotgun) deal damage relatively slowly and serve as basic offensive weapons. Tier two weapons (such as the Assault Rifle and Combat Shotgun) deal damage faster and often appear in later maps of each chapter. The two tier three weapons (Grenade Launcher and M60) differ from tier one and two weapons both because of their rarity and because players cannot refill their ammunition from ammunition dumps. They deal damage quickly {{at the cost of}} limited ammo. Tier four weapons are all mounted weapon systems and carry unlimited ammunition. The mounted weapons deal damage the fastest, but at the cost of overheating after a period of non-stop use. The mounted weapons are in set positions in maps and have a fixed arc of fire. They cannot be given ammunition upgrades like other weapons and players cannot utilize the laser sights attachment with them. There are three types of secondary weapons available: melee weapons, small caliber pistols (that can be dual wielded) and large caliber pistols. Although melee weapons cause extra damage to Infected when struck, the Survivors can use any other weapon or item for weaker melee attacks that can push the Infected back. Players also carry a flashlight with infinite battery life, the use of which enables players to see in the dark (with the <b>downside</b> <b>of</b> the player gaining the attention of the Infected much faster). They may also carry a single first aid kit, special ammo pack, or a defibrillator in their major medical supply slot; in addition to either pain pills or an adrenaline shot in their minor medical supply slot. They may also carry a single throwable weapon—Molotov cocktails to set an area on fire; pipe bombs to attract any nearby Infected to the flashing light and sound it makes until it explodes; and jars of Boomer bile, which attracts Common Infected to whatever it hits (e.g. fires, Special Infected, each other).|$|E
