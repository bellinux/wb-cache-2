40|$|This study {{examines}} whether <b>reference</b> <b>levels</b> {{change over time}} and the impact on individuals 2 ̆ 7 risk-taking behavior. I apply expectations-based reference-dependent preferences theory to analyze whether individuals 2 ̆ 7 <b>reference</b> <b>levels</b> change over time in an economic setting. The theory suggests that individuals develop <b>reference</b> <b>levels</b> based on expectations of future outcomes (Koszegi and Rabin 2006). Therefore, this {{study examines}} whether individuals 2 ̆ 7 expectations affect the setting of their <b>reference</b> <b>level</b> and how possible changes in <b>reference</b> <b>levels</b> affect subsequent risk-taking behavior. This study also provides evidence on how budget-based contracts impact individual risk taking behavior in a single period setting. Prior research has used multiple theories {{in an attempt to}} explain contradictory results relating to budget target difficulty and risk-taking behaviors. This study provides more evidence to the literature by further examining the impact of budget-based contracts on individuals 2 ̆ 7 risk-taking behavior. A 1 x 2 between subjects experiment was conducted over five periods. Budget target was the manipulated factor at two levels: easy and moderate. Results suggest that individuals under easy budget targets make riskier decisions. Additionally, individuals 2 ̆ 7 <b>reference</b> <b>levels</b> change over time and the change in <b>reference</b> <b>level</b> is greater for those individuals who continually attain their budget target, suggesting that expectations do increase the <b>reference</b> <b>level.</b> Lastly, in the current study, changes in <b>reference</b> <b>level</b> do not {{have a significant impact on}} risky decision making...|$|R
40|$|This study {{extends the}} {{literature}} on portfolio choice under prospect theory preferences by introducing a two-period life cycle model, where the household decides on optimal consumption and investment in a portfolio with one risk-free and one risky asset. The optimal solution depends primarily on the household’s choice of {{the present value of}} the consumption <b>reference</b> <b>levels</b> relative to the present value of its endowment income. If the present value of the consumption <b>reference</b> <b>levels</b> is set below the present value of endowment income, then the household behaves in such a way to avoid relative losses in consumption in any present or future state of nature (good or bad). As a result the degree of loss aversion does not directly affect optimal consumption and risk taking activity. However, it must be sufficiently high in order to rule out outcomes with relative losses. On the other hand, if the present value of the consumption <b>reference</b> <b>levels</b> is set exactly equal to the present value of the endowment income, i. e., the household sets its <b>reference</b> <b>levels</b> such that they are in balance with its income, then the household’s optimal consumption is the reference consumption in both periods and the household will not invest in the risky asset. Finally, if the present value of the household’s consumption <b>reference</b> <b>levels</b> is set above the present value of its endowment income, then the household cannot avoid experiencing a relative loss in consumption, either now or in the future. As a result, loss aversion directly affects consumption and risky investment. <b>Reference</b> <b>levels</b> {{play a significant role in}} consumption and risk taking activity. In most cases the household will “follow the Joneses” if the <b>reference</b> <b>levels</b> are set equal to the consumption levels of the Joneses. Independent of how consumption <b>reference</b> <b>levels</b> are set, being more ambitious, i. e., increasing one’s <b>reference</b> <b>levels,</b> will result in less happiness.

50|$|A <b>reference</b> <b>level</b> (RL) is {{expressed}} as an amount, derived by differencing {{a sequence of}} amounts {{over a period of}} time.

If the amounts are emissions, the <b>reference</b> <b>level</b> becomes a <b>reference</b> emission <b>level</b> (REL); however these RELs are seen by some as incomplete as they do not take into account removals. <b>Reference</b> <b>levels</b> are based on a scope ‒ what is included? ‒ a scale ‒ the geographical area from which it is derived or to which it is applied ‒ and a period over which the <b>reference</b> <b>level</b> is calculated.

It is proposed to establish diagnostic <b>reference</b> <b>levels</b> as the 75 %-percentiles of X-ray unit distribution by the patient standard doses for a given X-ray examination.
