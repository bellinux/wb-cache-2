5|$|As Mr. Burns collapses on the sundial, it is {{seen that}} the gun he was {{previously}} carrying has gone missing. This was inserted as an intentional <b>freeze</b> <b>frame</b> clue.|$|E
5|$|The same {{model was}} used for both the Kaled and the Thal domes. The gas attack in Part One was {{achieved}} through dry ice and green lighting. Some of the Thal guns were re-used props from the First Doctor (William Hartnell) serial Galaxy 4 (1965). The electric trolley used by the Kaleds in Part One worked in tests, but collapsed when Baker and Marter boarded it. The creature Harry and the Doctor glimpse {{at the end of}} Part Two was mainly a reused Ice Warrior costume, while the Thal rocket ship was a reused model from The Ambassadors of Death (1970). During the filming of Part Two, Miles and Chinnery had trouble fitting the gun on the Dalek. As a result, the scene had to be filmed in two takes, bridged with a reaction shot of the Doctor. Part Two is unusual in that {{it is one of the}} very few episodes not to begin with a reprise, and also the first to end in a <b>freeze</b> <b>frame.</b> A stunt double for Elisabeth Sladen was hired for Sarah's fall from the scaffolding, but Maloney discovered that she would be falling eight feet, while Sladen had fallen ten feet in rehearsals. Maloney ultimately decided to conclude the episode with a <b>freeze</b> <b>frame</b> ending. Maloney would use the <b>freeze</b> <b>frame</b> technique again, most notably with The Deadly Assassin. The third episode overran its 25-minute limit and rather than cut material out the cliffhanger was changed from Davros' speech to the Doctor being electrocuted. The music for the serial was recorded on 3 March 1975 and the dubbing finished the day before Part One aired.|$|E
5|$|On May 7, 2001, Burger King began {{promotions}} for the film, {{giving out}} {{a selection of}} nine exclusive Candy Caddies based on the Shrek characters, in Big Kids Meal and Kids Meal orders. Ice cream chain Baskin-Robbins also ran an 8-week promotion of the film, selling products such as Shrek's Hot Sludge Sundae, a combination of Oreo Cookies 'n Cream ice cream, hot fudge, crushed chocolate cookies, whipped cream and squiggly gummy worms, and Shrek <b>Freeze</b> <b>Frame</b> Cake, featuring an image of Shrek and Donkey framed by sunflowers. This was to support the film's DVD/VHS release.|$|E
5000|$|Hong Kong {{director}} John Woo {{also makes}} {{extensive use of}} <b>freeze</b> <b>frames</b> shots, usually {{to gain a better}} focus on to a character's facial expression or emotion at a critical scene.|$|R
50|$|For the {{original}} {{release of the}} film in Britain, censors removed the glowing eye effects. UK prints without the glowing eyes effects show that during the final sequence, in the close-ups, the kids widen their eyes as they attack Zellaby's mind, unlike the <b>freeze</b> <b>frames</b> with added glowing eyes used in the American prints. Another example is a slight smile that David makes after setting one of the villagers on fire in the UK print; the <b>freeze</b> <b>frames</b> of the American print do not contain such subtle detail. This print also has a credit for being filmed at MGM's British studios that {{is not on the}} American prints.|$|R
50|$|The film uses {{a number}} of stylized {{techniques}} in its storytelling, particularly {{through the use of}} <b>freeze</b> <b>frames,</b> flashbacks and voiceovers, which allow sections of the narrative to be delivered from the points of view of the four main characters.|$|R
5|$|When Press Your Luck {{returned}} after the weekend break, the episode {{started with the}} same <b>freeze</b> <b>frame</b> image. Tomarken (again chroma keyed over the image) then brought the viewers {{up to speed on}} what Friday's episode entailed, first by introducing Larson's opponents and then explaining what Larson had done so far, before the game resumed. Freeze frames were also used to lead {{into and out of the}} first two commercial breaks, with voice overs by Tomarken leading into and out of them.|$|E
5|$|As the Mysterons {{start to}} fire on Cloudbase, Dr Fawn is killed. Posing as his assistant, Mysteron {{intermediary}} Captain Black reports that Scarlet is dead with {{no possibility of}} recovery, his retro-metabolic ability being too weak to heal such extensive injuries. The Mysteron assault intensifies, resulting {{in the deaths of}} Magenta and the remaining Angels, until only White, Blue and Lieutenant Green are left alive in the Control Room. As the stricken Cloudbase loses altitude, Green is killed by another explosion, which also cripples Blue and leaves him unable to save himself. White resolves to go down with his command, and is seen standing to attention and saluting in a spiralling <b>freeze</b> <b>frame</b> shot, accompanied by the sounds of Cloudbase crashing to Earth.|$|E
5|$|From its inception, users {{would use}} the {{newsgroup}} to discuss {{the quality of the}} episode, as well as to talk about continuity errors and trivia. They would also discuss cultural references, usually related to pop culture. Another common topic is <b>freeze</b> <b>frame</b> gags, which are jokes that can only be seen when the viewer tapes the episode and freezes the image. All of these many discussions were compiled and submitted to The Simpsons Archive, which contains at least 330 episode guides as well as other guides. The newsgroup also provides The Simpsons Archive with information on the characters and the setting, as well as a compilation of articles about the show and interview with its cast and crew.|$|E
40|$|Western {{images of}} Islam and Muslims have been frozen {{in history and}} are {{recycled}} with mundane regularity. These ‘freeze frames’ emerged {{at the beginning of}} Islam and have, over centuries, acquired certain key elements and descriptors. Association of Islam with promiscuity and licentiousness was common during the eight and tenth centuries. The Crusades added war-like violence to the picture, and embedded Islam within the concept of evil. Two further elements, barbarism and despotism, were supplied by the humanist movement of the fourteenth century and the Enlightenment. We explore how Hollywood used the historic authority of the <b>freeze</b> <b>frames</b> to establish a convention for representing Islam and Muslims during its formative years in such iconic films as Fatima's Dance (1907), The Sheikh (1921) and The Thief of Bagdad (1924). The convention was expanded and developed further in blockbusters like Dream Wife (1953) and El Cid (1961). It is now so well established as shorthand descriptors of Islam and Muslims that one only has to locate a film in a Muslim city, like Bagdad, Cairo, Algiers or Casablanca, for all the elements of the <b>freeze</b> <b>frames</b> to come into play. The movies had made <b>freeze</b> <b>frames</b> an integral part of western popular imagination and consciousness...|$|R
50|$|Some {{scenes were}} edited and {{replaced}} {{because it would}} be difficult to digitally translate the fast scenes' text into English such as Dona Florinda's outside restaurant shots that were moving too fast, so they had to be <b>freeze</b> <b>framed</b> in order to have a direct translation.|$|R
5000|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Money City Maniacs" [...] was {{directed}} by Mike Andringa, who previously directed Sloan's music videos for [...] "The Good in Everyone" [...] and [...] "The Lines You Amend." [...] The video consists of the band playing with intermittent <b>freeze</b> <b>frames</b> and faux-red colorization.|$|R
5|$|The {{idea for}} the episode came from Matt Groening, who had wanted to do an episode in which Mr. Burns was shot, {{which could be used}} as a {{publicity}} stunt. The writers decided to write the episode in two parts with a mystery that could be used in a contest. It was important for them to design a mystery that had clues, took advantage of <b>freeze</b> <b>frame</b> technology, and was structured around one character who seemed to be the obvious culprit. While deciding who the culprit was, Oakley and Weinstein pitched Barney Gumble because he was a character that could go to jail and it could change the dynamic of the show. Mirkin suggested Maggie because he felt it was funnier and wanted the culprit to be a Simpsons family member. Oakley and Weinstein were initially unsure about having Maggie as the culprit, and it was decided that the episode would end with Maggie shifting her eyes and making it look like it was not a complete accident.|$|E

5000|$|The American TV show NCIS—a {{spin-off}} of {{the series}} JAG—often uses freeze-frame shots, referred to in that programss production as [...] "phoofs" [...] or [...] "foofs" [...] due to the sound effect that accompanies them, which was created by NCISs creator and Executive Producer Donald P. Bellisario hitting a microphone with his hand, though {{it sounds like a}} light-bulb exploding. These short black and white <b>freeze</b> <b>frames</b> depict an event that will occur later in the episode, and usually last for three seconds. The program first used the technique in the fourth episode of the second season of NCIS, Lt. Jane Doe, and have appeared in every episode since, with a typical episode containing four or five <b>freeze</b> <b>frames</b> that include main characters and sometimes also one-off or recurring characters.|$|R
5000|$|From {{an event}} {{realized}} {{under the influence}} of hypnosis, Larry Miller created an installation [...] "Mom-Me," [...] from 1973, which featured snapshots, family photos by the artist, video <b>freeze</b> <b>frames</b> and video as part of The Third Mind: American Artists Contemplate Asia at the Guggenheim Museum from January to April 2009.|$|R
50|$|Jean Taris, Swimming Champion (Taris, roi de l'eau or La natation par Jean Taris, {{champion}} de France or Taris, champion de natation) is a 1931 French short {{documentary film}} directed by Jean Vigo, about the French swimmer Jean Taris. The film is notable {{for the many}} innovative techniques that Vigo uses, including close ups and <b>freeze</b> <b>frames</b> of the swimmer's body.|$|R
25|$|The jump {{distance}} is measured electronically using digital video <b>freeze</b> <b>frame</b> technology or, in some cases, is measured manually by judges.|$|E
25|$|Mode 02 {{accepts the}} same PIDs as mode 01, {{with the same}} meaning, but {{information}} given is from when the <b>freeze</b> <b>frame</b> was created.|$|E
25|$|The {{closing credits}} for the {{programme}} varied series by series. The first series used peeling labels featuring {{the names of}} the cast and crew, mirroring the opening sequence, but these had to be updated with every new episode, making the process very time-consuming; from the second series the credits switched to a standard rolling format. The third series featured additional symbols. For the fourth series, these designs were replaced with white lettering on a black background. The fifth series had a black and white background, but the sixth series reverted to the black one. For the seventh series, the credits scrolled against a <b>freeze</b> <b>frame</b> of the final scene.|$|E
50|$|Man with a Movie Camera {{is famous}} for the range of {{cinematic}} techniques Vertov invents, deploys or develops, such as double exposure, fast motion, slow motion, <b>freeze</b> <b>frames,</b> jump cuts, split screens, Dutch angles, extreme close-ups, tracking shots, footage played backwards, stop motion animations and self-reflexive visuals (at one point it features a split-screen tracking shot; the sides have opposite Dutch angles).|$|R
50|$|The {{movie is}} {{nevertheless}} impressionistic, with {{extensive use of}} slow motion, <b>freeze</b> <b>frames,</b> multiple images, and varying perspectives. The film is shot in brilliant, saturated hues, with strong reds perhaps predominating. Black, white, blue and a smaller amount of yellow are all present in concentrated form. The scenes are cut, often abruptly, and multiple shots are often {{used in the same}} screen.|$|R
50|$|Unlike most Chinese {{language}} talk shows, {{the format}} of KangSi is fast-paced, humorous and fully self-aware despite topics that are occasionally controversial. Most episodes feature a group of entertainers and politicians as guest stars engaging into discussions ranging from their career to gossip and current events. Along with its variety show approach, KangSi frequently accompanies itself with cartoon sound effects, comical use of editing (instant replays and <b>freeze</b> <b>frames)</b> and wacky animated texts and visuals.|$|R
500|$|Once Larson passed $36,000, the {{producers}} {{cut to a}} <b>freeze</b> <b>frame</b> of the contestant area and Tomarken (in a chroma key shot) then tossed to a commercial. Once back from the commercial, Tomarken informed the viewers {{that because of the}} extraordinary circumstances, the match could not be completed on the June 8 episode and would instead be finished on the next scheduled airing on Monday, June 11. He then signed off with the words [...] "To be continued..." [...] superimposed on the screen.|$|E
500|$|Initially {{the film}} was to retain the short story's title of [...] "High Jump", because of Ishaan's {{inability}} to achieve the high jump in gym class. This subplot—filmed but later cut—tied into the original ending for the movie. In this rendition, a [...] "ghost image" [...] separates from Ishaan after the art competition and runs to the sports field; the film would end on a <b>freeze</b> <b>frame</b> of Ishaan successfully making the leap. Khan, however, was unhappy with that proposed ending and convinced Gupte to rewrite it.|$|E
500|$|The film's violent climax was edited {{together}} {{in its present}} shape due to a continuity problem. In the screenplay, the soldier played by Nicky Henson was supposed to shoot both Price and Ogilvy to death. However, the actor only had one flintlock pistol, which had been clearly established in previous scenes, and was therefore only able to shoot one person. When the error was discovered, Reeves immediately told the actor: [...] "All right, just shoot Vincent and I'll get Ian to scream and shout and go mad and <b>freeze</b> <b>frame</b> on Hilary Dwyer screaming." ...|$|E
50|$|In {{creating}} a filming style, director Oldrich Lipský {{was inspired by}} silent comedy films, from which he borrowed numerous effects, including film tinting, slow motion, and fast motion. Brdečka's experience as an animator, often in collaboration with Jiří Trnka, led to several effects and ideas derived from animation being incorporated into the film, including animated smoke rings and dotted lines for bullet paths, <b>freeze</b> <b>frames</b> for dramatic effect, and even {{a reference to the}} Acme Corporation from the Looney Tunes cartoons.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the seminal}} {{products}} of the French New Wave (Nouvelle Vague), Jules and Jim is an inventive encyclopedia {{of the language of}} cinema: Truffaut incorporated newsreel footage, photographic stills, <b>freeze</b> <b>frames,</b> panning shots, wipes, masking, dolly shots, and voiceover narration (by Michel Subor). Truffaut's cinematographer was Raoul Coutard, a frequent collaborator with Jean-Luc Godard, who employed the latest lightweight cameras to create an extremely fluid film style. For example, some of the postwar scenes were shot using cameras mounted on bicycles.|$|R
5000|$|This {{features}} remixes to the Dragon Ball opening theme [...] "Makafushigi Adventure" [...] and {{the closing}} theme {{to the third}} film [...] "Chikyū Marugoto Chōkessen" [...] which is known outside Japan as The Tree of Might, [...] "Marugoto". Also featured is the closing theme to the Bardock TV special, [...] "Hikari no Tabi" [...] which doubles as the title track to the album. As a result, much of the album's production art {{is made up of}} <b>freeze</b> <b>frames</b> from the TV special.|$|R
500|$|... "No Podrás" [...] debuted {{at number}} 39 on the Billboard Hot Latin Songs chart on {{the week of}} 25 July 1992. The song {{climbed to the top}} ten on the week of 29 August 1992 and peaked at number three two weeks later. To promote the song, a music video was made for [...] "No Podrás" [...] which shows Castro {{performing}} the song for a live audience, inserting some sequences of a female dancer and different backgrounds. The video ends in a <b>freeze</b> <b>frame</b> of Castro embracing on stage with a female teenage fan. Another music video shows Castro performing this song while he is walking at the sea shore. The song also reached number one on the hit parade chart in Mexico City.|$|E
500|$|Burnett {{left after}} seven innings and was {{replaced}} by Mariano Rivera in the eighth. The Phillies put two runners on with a walk to Jimmy Rollins and a single by Shane Victorino with one out in the eighth. However, Chase Utley grounded into an inning-ending double play ending on a close play at first base, the second close call made by the first base umpire Brian Gorman. Gorman himself later admitted he missed this call, saying [...] "on a <b>freeze</b> <b>frame,</b> it looks like there's {{a little bit of a}} ball outside his glove when he hits the bag." [...] Ultimately, Rivera threw 39 pitches and got six outs for his 38th postseason save, his tenth in World Series play.|$|E
500|$|The film {{is set in}} 2014. Josh Brolin {{provides}} the voice and performance capture for Thanos, the supervillain who appeared in The Avengers mid-credits scene. Gunn noted that the film would be connected to [...] Several other objects of significance appear in the Collector's museum, including a Chitauri from The Avengers and a Dark Elf from Thor: The Dark World, among other characters. About their appearances Gunn said, [...] "There's {{a lot of stuff}} in the Collector's Museum. And for me, it was mostly just really fun. As a Marvel fan, giving the actual fans something that they can <b>freeze</b> <b>frame</b> on their Blu-Ray at home and just kind of pick out everything that's in there. So there are, I mean, seriously all those boxes have something interesting in them, so it's pretty fun."

40|$|This essay reads Lyndsey Turner’s 2015 Hamlet at the Barbican Theatre in London {{against the}} production’s priorities, namely, being star, new {{audience}} and box-office driven. It explores {{the negotiation of}} the script, space and politics {{at the heart of}} this production. Giving its due when discussing the cinematic employment of cuts, editing, lighting and <b>freeze</b> <b>frames,</b> it acknowledges that some of the special effects were lost to the theatre spectator, per force cast in a secondary role in a production that prioritised live-streaming across the world...|$|R
5000|$|Dezaki {{was known}} for his {{distinct}} visual style, which makes use of split screen, stark lighting, extensive use of dutch angle, and pastel <b>freeze</b> <b>frames</b> that he called [...] "postcard memories", which may be his most famous trademark. They feature a process whereby the screen fades into a detailed [...] "painting" [...] of the simpler original animation. Many of his techniques became popular and came to be seen as special techniques of Japanese animation. He particularly influenced Yoshiaki Kawajiri, Yoshiyuki Tomino, Ryūtarō Nakamura, Noriyuki Abe, Kunihiko Ikuhara, Akiyuki Shinbo, and Yutaka Yamamoto.|$|R
