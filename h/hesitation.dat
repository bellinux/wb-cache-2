40|$|This {{contribution}} {{provides a}} study on the acoustic and prosodic characteristics of vocalic <b>hesitations</b> in three languages. The main goal is to determine whether vocalic <b>hesitations</b> can be considered as bearing language-specific information. An additional point of interest concerns the link between vocalic <b>hesitations</b> and the vowels in the phonemic inventory of a language. Finally, a complementary aim of the present work is to use large corpora to investigate whether some language universals can be found. <b>Hesitations</b> have been automatically extracted from large corpora of journalistic broadcast speech and parliamentary debates in American English, French and Spanish. Duration, fundamental frequency and formant values were measured and compared. Results confirm that vocalic <b>hesitations</b> share (potentially universal) properties across languages, e. g,. longer durations and lower fundamental frequency than are observed for intra-lexical vowels. The results on vocalic timbre show that while the measures on <b>hesitations</b> are close to existing vowels of the language, they do not necessarily collapse with them...|$|R
50|$|Measurements {{of speech}} tempo can be {{strongly}} affected by pauses and <b>hesitations.</b> For this reason, it is usual {{to distinguish between}} speech tempo including pauses and <b>hesitations</b> and speech tempo excluding them. The former is called speaking rate and the latter articulation rate.|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, {{the writer}} studies about how <b>hesitations</b> occur and {{influence}} a speaker?s utterances when he communicates and interacts {{in the conversation}} using turntaking and exchange strategies. The writer takes {{the data from the}} conversations between William and Anna in "Notting Hill" because the writer notices a lot of William?s utterances that contain <b>hesitations.</b> Beside that, through turntaking and exchange strategies that contain <b>hesitations</b> in William?s utterances, the writer analyses how he encourages himself to keep talking and communicating in the conversation. After analysing the data, the writer found that <b>hesitations</b> appeared as the consequences of William?s conditions when he felt confused, shy, panic, and nervous when he met Anna. In turntaking and exchange strategies, the writer found that William tried to handle his difficulty, motivate himself and carry out his role in order to keep talking with Anna. Thus, William could build good communication and relationship with Anna. Finally, the writer can conclude that <b>hesitations</b> may help the speaker build a good conversation, especially through managing him/herself, ideas, and strategy to run the conversation...|$|R

There were no <b>hesitation</b> wounds, which are typical of suicide by self-infliction. However, the authorities do not seem to be investigating the case further.|$|E

5|$|As {{retribution}} for the Italian actions at Beirut, {{four days}} after the battle the central Ottoman government ordered the Wilyets of Beirut, Aleppo, and Damascus to expel all Italian citizens from their jurisdictions, resulting in the deportation of over 60,000 Italians from the region. Despite the retaliatory expulsion of Italian citizens from the area, the battle gave the Italian forces complete naval superiority in the approaches to the Suez Canal and Italian forces in Eritrea could now be reinforced without <b>hesitation,</b> eliminating much of the Ottoman threat to the region. Thus the battle was both a strategic and tactical Italian victory.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{acoustic}} characteristics of vocalic <b>hesitations</b> in a cross-language perspec-tive. The underlying questions concern the “neu-tral ” vs. language-dependent timbre of vocalic hes-itations and the link between their vocalic quality and the phonemic system of the language. An ad-ditional point of interest concerns the duration ef-fect on vocalic <b>hesitations</b> compared to intra-lexical vowels. Acoustic measurements have been car-ried out in American English, French and Spanish. Results on vocalic timbre show that <b>hesitations</b> (i) carry language-specific information; (ii) whereas of-ten close to measurements of existing vowels, they do not necessarily collapse with them. Finally, (iii) duration variation affects the timbre of vocalic hes-itation and a centralization towards a “neutral ” real-ization is observed for decreasing durations...|$|R

The rest of the office, still angry at Michael for his near-disastrous idea, play along with Wallace's misunderstanding and congratulate Dwight. When David sets up a conference call with the marketing department so Dwight can explain his Golden Ticket promotion, Michael interrupts and goads Dwight into revealing the idea actually came from Michael. After much bickering between Michael and Dwight, a frustrated David leaves the office, appearing indifferent about the outcome.|$|E

5|$|Despite their success, {{the band}} has had several feuds with the {{corporate}} {{side of the}} recording industry.

NIN signed to Interscope Records afterward, but {{after the release of}} their fifth studio album Year Zero in 2007, Reznor announced that the band would release future material independently. The band signed with Columbia Records for the release of their eighth album <b>Hesitation</b> Marks (2013) but returned to self-releasing material with the second Nine Inch Nails EP, Not the Actual Events (2016).|$|E

5|$|Her {{relationship}} with the Jesuits was complex. Members of this order educated her, served as her confessors, and supervised the religious education of her eldest son. The Jesuits were powerful and influential {{in the early years}} of Maria Theresa's reign. However, the queen's ministers convinced her that the order posed a danger to her monarchical authority. Not without much <b>hesitation</b> and regret, she issued a decree which removed them from all the institutions of the monarchy, and carried it out thoroughly. She forbade the publication of Pope Clement XIII's bull which was in favour of the Jesuits and promptly confiscated their property when Pope Clement XIV suppressed the order.|$|E
5|$|Hines led sixty {{men from}} Toronto, Ontario, on August 25, 1864. They arrived during the Democratic Party National Convention held in Chicago that year. The Copperheads had told Hines {{to wait until}} that time, as they said that 50,000 Copperheads would {{be there for the}} event. However, encountering Copperhead <b>hesitation</b> to assist Hines and his force, and with Federal {{authorities}} apparently knowledgeable of the plot, Hines and his men were forced to flee Chicago on August 30, 1864. Many of the men thought Anderson may have been a double agent, forcing him to leave the group. A second attempt to free the Camp Douglas Confederate prisoners occurred during the United States Presidential Election of 1864, but that plan was also foiled.|$|E
