In the invasive edge of pancreatic carcinoma, {{a subset of}} CD133+CXCR4+ (receptor for CXCL12 chemokine {{also known as a}} SDF1 ligand) cells was defined. These cells exhibited significantly stronger migratory activity than their counterpart CD133+CXCR4− cells, but both showed similar tumor <b>development</b> <b>capacity.</b> Moreover, inhibition of the CXCR4 receptor reduced metastatic potential without altering tumorigenic capacity.|$|E
25|$|CSCs, now {{reported}} in most human tumors, are commonly identified and enriched using strategies for identifying normal stem {{cells that are}} similar across studies. These procedures include fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), with antibodies directed at cell-surface markers and functional approaches including side population assay or Aldefluor assay. The CSC-enriched result is then implanted, at various doses, in immune-deficient mice to assess its tumor <b>development</b> <b>capacity.</b> This in vivo assay is called a limiting dilution assay. The tumor cell subsets that can initiate tumor development at low cell numbers are further tested for self-renewal capacity in serial tumor studies.|$|E
25|$|A 2005 {{report found}} serious {{shortcomings}} to China’s national innovation system. There were problems with services to help turn S work into {{results and the}} allocation of national funding to support S was far from optimal. Sometimes researchers became short-sighted if they {{get too close to}} the market. Another serious problem was that companies facing severe competition looked first to purchase foreign technology rather than investing in developing technology and technology <b>development</b> <b>capacity</b> at home in China. Many of the patent applications came from medium-sized enterprises (70%) since small enterprises invest little in research. China's hierarchical, top-down society where authority is greatly respected and feared has been argued to stifle creative debate.|$|E

50|$|Capacity {{building}} (or <b>capacity</b> <b>development)</b> is {{the process}} by which individual and organizations obtain, improve, and retain the skills and knowledge needed to do their jobs competently. Capacity building and <b>capacity</b> <b>development</b> are often used interchangeably; however, some people interpret capacity building as not recognizing people's existing <b>capacity</b> whereas <b>capacity</b> <b>development</b> recognizes existing <b>capacities</b> which require improvement.|$|R
25|$|However, some {{obstacles}} remain. ASEAN currently trades {{more with}} other countries (80%) than among its member countries (20%). Therefore, ASEAN economies {{are more concerned about}} currency stability against major international currencies, like the US dollar. On macroeconomic conditions, ASEAN member countries have different levels of economic <b>development,</b> <b>capacity,</b> and priorities that translate into different levels of interest and readiness. Monetary integration however implies less control over national monetary and fiscal policy to stimulate the economy. Therefore, greater convergence in macroeconomic conditions is being enacted to improve conditions and confidence in a common currency. On the other hand, there are also constraints on the adoption of one currency, such as the following: diversity in the level of economic development across countries, weaknesses in the financial sectors of many countries, inadequacy of regional-level resource pooling mechanisms and institutions required for forming and managing a currency union, and lack of political preconditions for monetary co-operation and a common currency.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To outline a {{framework}} and {{a process for}} assessing the needs for <b>capacity</b> <b>development</b> to achieve nutrition objectives, particularly those targeting maternal and child undernutrition. Design: Commentary and conceptual framework. Setting: Low- and middle-income countries. Result: A global movement {{to invest in a}} package of essential nutrition interventions to reduce maternal and child undernutrition in low- and middle-income countries is building momentum. Capacity to act in nutrition is known to be minimal in most low- and middle-income countries, and {{there is a need for}} conceptual clarity about <b>capacity</b> <b>development</b> as a strategic construct and the processes required to realise the ability to achieve population nutrition and health objectives. The framework for nutrition <b>capacity</b> <b>development</b> proposed recognises <b>capacity</b> to be determined by a range of factors across at least four levels, including system, organisational, workforce and community levels. This framework provides a scaffolding to guide systematic assessment of <b>capacity</b> <b>development</b> needs which serves to inform strategic planning for <b>capacity</b> <b>development.</b> Conclusions: <b>Capacity</b> <b>development</b> is a critical prerequisite for achieving nutrition and health objectives, but is currently constrained by ambiguous and superficial conceptualisations of what <b>capacity</b> <b>development</b> involves and how it can be realised. The current paper provides {{a framework}} to assist this conceptualisation, encourage debate and ongoing refinement, and progress <b>capacity</b> <b>development</b> efforts...|$|R
40|$|Implementing a {{systemic}} approach to <b>capacity</b> <b>development</b> is more challenging than stakeholders expect {{and can be}} difficult to communicate to colleagues, donors and intended beneficiaries. This article explores challenges faced by the IDS Knowledge Services as it sought to turn an understanding of <b>capacity</b> <b>development</b> into practice. Drawing on the experience of one small scale programme it argues that: • for organisations to facilitate <b>capacity</b> <b>development,</b> they themselves need to change; • customary understandings of <b>capacity</b> <b>development</b> are an obstacle to effective demand?led approaches; • promoting critical reflection may be the most sustainable activity for facilitating <b>capacity</b> <b>development.</b> It concludes that the process of translating an understanding of <b>capacity</b> <b>development</b> into practice requires treading a line between pragmatism and idealism. This approach has ethical and practical challenges which <b>capacity</b> <b>development</b> practitioners need to counter by considering the impact that they have on others, by being aware of their own capacity and working to change understandings of <b>capacity</b> <b>development...</b>|$|R
