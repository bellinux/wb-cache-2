The multilayer design of the filters and coatings, choice of layer materials, and the deposition techniques adopted to ensure adequate layer thickness control is discussed. The spectral assessment of the filters and coatings is carried out using a FTIR spectrometer; some measurement results are presented together with discussion of measurement accuracy and the identification and avoidance of measurement artifacts. The post-deposition processing of the filters by sawing to size, writing of an identification code onto the coatings and the environmental testing of the <b>finished</b> <b>filters</b> are also described...|$|R

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Electrical and Computer EngineeringWilliam B. KuhnIn {{microchip}} circuitry, {{the tiny}} size of inductors creates low Q values, limiting a bandpass filter’s {{ability to have}} narrow bandwidths at RF frequencies. To counter this problem and also compensate for losses, Q-enhancement can be implemented to facilitate narrower bandwidths and boost gain. With Q-enhancement, temperature sensitivity of the circuitry causes the filter parameters to drift over time, making it necessary to adjust the filter periodically {{in order to keep}} the filter centered at the desired frequency. With the proper additional on-chip circuits used with a microprocessor, a tuning algorithm makes it possible to automatically tune the filter in-situ. The algorithm is based on increasing Q-enhancement until the filter begins to oscillate, reading the frequency of oscillation, adjusting to the desired frequency, and then decreasing Q-enhancement until the filter no longer oscillates. A 500 MHz single-pole differential filter was designed with an on-chip amplitude detector and frequency prescaler to facilitate tuning. The filter was made adjustable across frequency with banks of binary weighted switchable capacitors. Q-enhancement adjustment was achieved via banks of cross-coupled FETs, also binary weighted. The circuit was fabricated in 0. 5 μm silicon-on-sapphire technology. The <b>finished</b> <b>filter</b> chip was controlled with a PIC microprocessor which had been programmed in C with the tuning algorithm. With the tuning algorithm in place, the filter was successfully able to align itself to within ± 1 MHz of the desired 500 MHz center frequency. Q-enhancement levels were also able to self-adjust to maintain a desired bandwidth. An improved design based around an off-chip coupled-resonator two-pole filter has also been designed. This filter includes adjustable coupling capacitance between the two poles, which also must be tuned. A new method of tuning is proposed for such applications. The properties of a two-pole filter cause it to oscillate at two frequencies with Q-enhancement. A modified amplitude detector is capable of reading the beat frequency which results from the two oscillations, a value which relates directly to and allows tuning of the bandwidth of the filter...|$|R

Since the band was funding this CD and video themselves, to save money, the band used videotape instead of film, which caused problems during the filming. Excessive lighting had to be used on stage so the videotape would pick up all the images which then lead to excessive heat on stage making the performers sweat which was rather unflattering when watching the <b>finished</b> product. A <b>filter</b> was used during editing that softened the images but it caused the picture to look distorted making purchasers wonder if they had received a defective item.|$|R
40|$|Motivation: Conformational {{searches}} in {{molecular docking}} are a time-consuming process with {{wide range of}} applications. Favorable conformations of the ligands that successfully bind with receptors are sought to form stable ligand-receptor complexes. Usually a large num-ber of conformations are generated and their binding energies are examined. We propose adding a geometric screening phase before an energy minimization proce-dure so that only conformations that geometrically fit in the binding site will be prompted for energy calcula-tion. Results: Geometric screening can drastically {{reduce the number of}} conformations to be examined from mil-lions (or higher) to thousands (or lower). The method can also handle cases when there are more variables than geometric constraints. An early-stage implemen-tation is able to <b>finish</b> the geometric <b>filtering</b> of confor-mations for molecules with up to nine variables in one minute.

40|$|Frequency {{selective}} surfaces (FSS) are {{structures that}} filter or preserve some frequency bands. Usually, the desired spectral response is obtained tuning manually the dielectric materials and periodic geometries of the FSS. The design process of a FSS is costly {{and difficult to}} <b>finish</b> if the <b>filtering</b> response to be synthesized cannot be directly obtained with classical geometries. To overcome this problem, in this paper a heuristic method (PSO) and an analysis methodology of structures with several periodic surfaces (CG-FFT) are combined in order to automate the search. The analysis method uses a multilayer Green’s function that considers the mutual coupling effects using a transmission line model for translating the field from the source FSS to the other periodic surfaces. A comparison with commercial simulators and results for the optimization of a FSS with two periodic layers, are presented to show {{the usefulness of the}} approach...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} reliable satisfaction of customer demand by unreliable production systems. In {{the framework of a}} simple production-storage-customer model, we show that this can be accomplished by using an appropriate level of filtering of production randomness. The filtering is ensured by <b>finished</b> goods buffers (<b>filtering</b> in space) and shipping periods (filtering in time). The following question is considered: how are filtering in space and filtering in time interrelated? As an answer, we show that there exists a conservation law: in lean manufacturing systems, the amount of filtering in space multiplied by the amount of filteringin time (both measured in appropriate dimensionless units) ispractically constant. Along with providing an insight into the nature of manufacturing systems, this law offers a tool for selecting the smallest, that is, lean, finished goods buffering, which is necessary and sufficient to ensure the desired level ofcustomer demand satisfaction. </p...|$|R
40|$|H. 264 /MPEG- 4 part 10 or Advanced Video Coding (AVC) is a {{standard}} for video compression. MPEG- 4 is currently {{one of the most}} widely used formats for recording, compression and distribution of high definition video. One feature of the AVC codec is the inclusion of an in-loop deblocking filter. The goal of the deblocking filter is to remove blocking artifacts that exist at macroblock boundaries. However, due to the complexity of the deblocking algorithm, the filter can easily account for one-third of the computational complexity of a decoder. In this thesis, a modification to the deblocking algorithm given in the AVC standard is presented. This modification allows the algorithm to <b>finish</b> the <b>filtering</b> of a macroblock to finish twenty clock cycles faster than previous single filter designs. This thesis also presents a hardware architecture of the H. 264 deblocking filter to be used in the H. 264 decoder. The developed architecture allows the filtering of videos streams using 4 : 2 : 2 chroma subsampling and 10 -bit pixel precision in real-time. The filter was described in VHDL and synthesized for a Spartan- 6 FPGA device. Timing analysis showed that is was capable of filtering a macroblock using 4 : 2 : 0 chroma subsampling in 124 clock cycles and 4 : 2 : 2 chroma subsampling streams in 162 clock cycles. The filter can also provide real-time deblocking of HDTV video (1920 x 1080) of up to 988 frames per second...|$|R
40|$|Distributed array radar {{can improve}} radar {{detection}} capability and measurement accuracy. However, it will suffer cyclic ambiguity in its angle estimates {{according to the}} spatial Nyquist sampling theorem since the large sparse array is undersampling. Consequently, the state estimation accuracy and track validity probability degrades when the ambiguous angles are directly used for target tracking. This paper proposes a second probability data association filter (SePDAF) -based tracking method for distributed array radar. Firstly, the target motion model and radar measurement model is built. Secondly, the fusion result of each radar’s estimation is employed to the extended Kalman <b>filter</b> (EKF) to <b>finish</b> the first <b>filtering.</b> Thirdly, taking this result as prior knowledge, and associating with the array-processed ambiguous angles, the SePDAF is applied to accomplish the second filtering, and then achieving a high accuracy and stable trajectory with relatively low computational complexity. Moreover, the azimuth filtering accuracy will be promoted dramatically and the position filtering accuracy will also improve.

40|$|Localized Harmonic Motion (LHM) Imaging {{is a new}} {{technique}} of ultrasound imaging which uses the localized stimulus of the oscillatory ultrasonic radiation force as produced by a modulated signal, and estimates the resulting harmonic displacement in the tissue {{in order to assess}} its underlying mechanical properties. This method can be highly localized and is considered as a non-invasive modality. In this thesis we first present the background information for LHM imaging and we compare this technique to other tissue mechanical properties imaging techniques. We then describe a setup for LHM induction and how the data is acquired and processed. We first focus on the transducer configuration, its characteristics and the housing built to combine the transducers, then the alignment of these transducers so they are confocal and can induce and detect motion in tissues, and finally we describe the local harmonic motion experiment setup including a supporting system and the induction/detection module. One of the most critical stages is the acquisition of the signal, since signals acquired by the imaging transducer always contain different sources of noise such as acoustic (standing waves, reflection from the tank, mechanical cross-talk between the transducers) and electric noise (electric cross-talk, noise of the high power amplifier) that we need to filter. Electronic filters were designed and implemented into our LHM experiment system. Additionally, digital filters were designed to further improve the performance of the system. We applied several kinds of digital notch filters (finite impulse response (FIR) and infinite impulse response (IIR) classes) and conduct analysis on the performance when obtaining LHM displacement information. After <b>finishing</b> the <b>filtering</b> and the setup, we performed LHM displacement experiments. We analyzed the obtained displacements as well as the noise observed in the final displacement waveforms, and the influence of analog and digital filters on the displacement detection. We finally measured the displacements induced by LHM on samples with different Young modulus and were able to differentiate them by the amplitude of the motion. Finally, we performed optimizations on the algorithm for LHM displacement calculations. Due to the large amount (462) of RF signals, it will typically take around 1 h for a 41 x 41 points image. It was found that the digital filter was the most time consuming part of the processing and it was parallelized using graphics processing unit (GPU) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{theoretical}} framework, {{including a}} short {{introduction to the}} Valhall oilfield, is provided in Chapter 2. To allow for readers with backgrounds other than geophysics, basic terms like anisotropy {{and the types of}} body waves are explained in 2. 2 and 2. 3. Also included in this section is the polarization and splitting of shear-waves and its link to transverse isotropy. Large portions of the thesis rely on understanding the effects of the Thomsen parameters, so special care is taken to properly define them and their relationship with Hooke’s law and the phase velocities of P- and S-waves in 2. 4. Definitions of terms involved in AVO and AVOA analysis, such as AVO gradient as well as examples of use and underlying assumptions of the concepts are provided in 2. 5 and 2. 6. The Zoeppritz equations describe exactly how seismic waves are reflected at a media boundary as a function of incidence angle, but their complexity obscure insight into the problem at hand. For that reason, Andreas Rüger’s (1997) approximation for the P-wave reflectivity in horizontally isotropic media is introduced in 2. 6. 1. Two approaches for inverting this equation for the symmetry axis orientation are outlined in the same section. The AVOA signature can be obscured by several error factors which vary with azimuth and/or wavefront normal angle. These include ghost effects, attenuation, source array directivity and heterogeneous/anisotropic overburdens. Brief explanations of these phenomena are given in 2. 6. 2. In 2. 7, the theory behind some of the processing applied to the seismic data in this thesis is explained – Kirchhoff migration and noise removal through f-x deconvolution and f-k <b>filtering.</b> <b>Finishing</b> off chapter two is {{a brief description of the}} finite element model ISAMGEO and the modeling software mech 2 seis. This software package, with the ISAMGEO-model as input, was used to model AVOA-effects to be compared with observed data. Chapter 3 contains the complete description of the practical work in this thesis. The first part summarizes the seismic data preprocessing and the AVOA attribute calculation and extraction along the horizons THC and Top Balder, figures of with common offset/midpoint gathers from every processing step and AVO/AVA plots. The second part of Chapter 3 describes the comparing of the extracted AVOA attributes along the horizons THC and Top Balder with: 1. Direction of maximum modeled stress. Theoretically, the direction of maximum stress is approximately equal to the isotropy plane orientation. 2. Unidirectionality of modeled stress. Large maximum stress compared to minimum stress could create small fractures and microcracks aligned in the direction of maximum stress. Also, the alignment of open fracturing can be influenced by the stress field if the maximum stress is significantly larger than the minimum stress – Cracks oriented orthogonal to the maximum stress direction may close, while cracks oriented parallel to the maximum stress direction may open. This will cause azimuthal anisotropy in the form of birefringence. 3. Modeled maximum stress magnitude difference across the interfaces. A certain difference in stress magnitude across the interface may be needed to induce measurable azimuthal anisotropy. 4. Modeled AVOA-effects. Synthetic AVO gradients were computed from modeled stress, density and velocity in an effort to match the observed AVO gradients. These comparisons confirmed a relationship between modeled stress and AVOA-effects, particularly at reservoir level, and the modeling of the AVO gradient indicated that the azimuthal anisotropy on Valhall is mainly caused by differences in the shear wave splitting parameter difference, Δγ, which points to that the azimuthal anisotropy could be caused by near-vertical fractures. Chapter 4 features a general discussion of the methodology and conclusions from the three comparisons between modeled and observed data, as well as a discussion of the relevance for using AVOA as an indicator of reservoir depletion based on data from a single survey. Input parameters for all figures, acquisition parameters, and PGS preprocessing are summarized in three tables in Appendix A, while Appendix B contains all MATLAB functions written for computing the AVO gradients from mech 2 seis output. </p...|$|R
