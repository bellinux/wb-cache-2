40|$|Objectives: To {{describe}} all {{elderly patients}} hospitalised with principal and secondary diagnoses of <b>depression,</b> {{and to determine}} whether a relationship can be demonstrated between psychosocial stressors, physical illness and type of <b>depression.</b> Method: A retrospective chart review of elderly patients admitted to a general hospital psychiatry ward over a 7 -year period with principal or secondary diagnoses of <b>depression</b> was undertaken. Four broad diagnostic categories of <b>depression</b> were used: major <b>depression,</b> psychotic <b>depression,</b> minor <b>depression,</b> and organic <b>depression.</b> Chief outcome measures were: number of medical diagnostic categories, presence of psychosocial stressors, global clinical improvement, and length of stay. Results: Of 228 patients admitted with <b>depression</b> (194 principal diagnoses and 34 secondary diagnoses), 100 had major <b>depression,</b> 47 psychotic <b>depression,</b> 48 minor <b>depression</b> and 33 organic <b>depression.</b> Psychiatric comorbidity occurred in 70 %, about half of which was due to organic brain syndrome. Patients with psychotic <b>depression</b> had the fewest medical problems and those with organic <b>depression</b> the most, while patients with minor <b>depression</b> had the highest rate of family and marital problems, comorbid personality dysfunction and suicide attempts. Patients with psychotic <b>depression</b> had the longest admissions, while those with minor <b>depression</b> had the shortest. Overall, 89 % showed significant clinical improvement. Conclusions: Elderly inpatients have a wide spectrum of depressive disorders with different psychosocial, medical and treatment profiles.

40|$|IMPORTANCE: Some small {{studies suggest}} that {{maternal}} postnatal <b>depression</b> is {{a risk factor for}} offspring adolescent <b>depression.</b> However, to our knowledge, no large cohort studies have addressed this issue. Furthermore, only 1 small study has examined the association between antenatal <b>depression</b> and later offspring <b>depression.</b> Understanding these associations is important to inform prevention. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the hypothesis that there are independent associations between antenatal and postnatal <b>depression</b> with offspring <b>depression</b> and that the risk pathways are different, such that the risk is moderated by disadvantage (low maternal education) with postnatal <b>depression</b> but not with antenatal <b>depression.</b> DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Prospective investigation of associations between symptoms of antenatal and postnatal parental <b>depression</b> with offspring <b>depression</b> at age 18 years in a UK community-based birth cohort (Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children) with data from more than 4500 parents and their adolescent offspring. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Diagnosis of offspring aged 18 years with major <b>depression</b> using the International Classification of Diseases, 10 th Revision. RESULTS: Antenatal <b>depression</b> was an independent risk factor. Offspring were 1. 28 times (95 % CI, 1. 08 - 1. 51; P =. 003) more likely to have <b>depression</b> at age 18 years for each standard deviation increase in maternal <b>depression</b> score antenatally, independent of later maternal <b>depression.</b> Postnatal <b>depression</b> was also a risk factor for mothers with low education, with offspring 1. 26 times (95 % CI, 1. 06 - 1. 50; P =. 01) more likely to have <b>depression</b> for each standard deviation increase in postnatal <b>depression</b> score. However, for more educated mothers, there was little association (odds ratio, 1. 09; 95 % CI, 0. 88 - 1. 36; P =. 42). Analyses found that maternal education moderated the effects of postnatal but not antenatal <b>depression.</b> Paternal <b>depression</b> antenatally was not associated with offspring <b>depression,</b> while postnatally, paternal <b>depression</b> showed a similar pattern to maternal <b>depression.</b> CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings suggest that treating maternal <b>depression</b> antenatally could prevent offspring <b>depression</b> during adulthood and that prioritizing less advantaged mothers postnatally may be most effective...|$|R

(1) The original studies upon which the criteria for atypical <b>depression</b> were based cited fatigue, insomnia, pain, and loss of weight as characteristic symptoms. (2) Several studies of DSM depressive criteria found patients with atypical <b>depression</b> to exhibit high levels of insomnia, fatigue, and loss of appetite/weight. (3) Several studies have found atypical <b>depression</b> to be comorbid with headaches, bulimia, and body image issues. (4) Most probands who report atypical <b>depression</b> meet criteria for “somatic depression,” defined as <b>depression</b> associated with several of disordered eating, poor body image, headaches, fatigue, and insomnia. The gender difference in prevalence of atypical <b>depression</b> results from its overlap with somatic <b>depression.</b> Somatic <b>depression</b> is associated with psychosocial measures related to gender, linking it with the descriptions of atypical <b>depression</b> as “reactive” appearing in the studies upon which the original criteria for atypical <b>depression</b> were based.

40|$|Objective: <b>Depression</b> is {{commonly}} reported in patients after cardiac surgery {{and increases the}} risk of postoperative cardiac morbidity and/or mortality. Although preoperative <b>depression</b> has been implicated as the strongest predictor of <b>depression</b> after surgery, the characteristics thought to influence reactive or persistent <b>depression</b> have been poorly investigated in cardiac surgery patients. Therefore, the main aim {{of this study was to}} examine whether preexisting <b>depression</b> rather than perioperative variables may predict postoperative reactive or persistent <b>depression.</b> Methods: Ninety-six patients completed a psychological evaluation, including the Center for Epidemiologic Studies of <b>Depression</b> (CES-D) scale and the State and Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI Y 1 /Y 2) for <b>depression</b> and anxiety, respectively, before surgery and at three-month follow-up. Results: Twenty-seven (28 %) and 24 (25 %) patients had <b>depression</b> preoperatively and at three-month follow-up, respectively. Postoperative <b>depression</b> was predicted by preoperative scores in CES-D (beta= 0. 29, P. 75). Specifically, patients with reactive <b>depression</b> showed greater EuroSCORE than those without <b>depression</b> (P <. 05), whereas patients with persistent <b>depression</b> had greater preoperative CES-D scores than those whose <b>depression</b> improved after surgery (P <. 01). Conclusions: The severity of preexisting <b>depression</b> and biomedical risk factors can be markers of depression-related risk three months after cardiac surgery in patients with persistent and reactive <b>depression,</b> respectively.

40|$|Background: The two {{essential}} {{features of}} minor <b>depression</b> {{are that it}} has fewer symptoms than major <b>depression</b> {{and that it is}} less chronic than dysthymia. This study describes the clinical features and functioning of outpatients with minor <b>depression.</b> Methods: Subjects with minor <b>depression</b> (with and without a prior history of major <b>depression)</b> were recruited through clinical referrals and community advertising. Assessments included the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID), the 17 -item Hamilton Rating Scale for <b>Depression</b> (HAM-D), the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self Report (IDS-SR) and Clinician Rated (IDS-C) scales, the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scale, the Medical Outcomes Study 36 -item Short-Form scale (MOS), and the Clinical Global Impressions Severity Scale (CGI).

RESULTS: In the twin study, the heritability of perinatal <b>depression</b> was estimated at 54 % (95 % CI= 35 %- 70 %), with the remaining variance attributable to nonshared environment (46 %; 95 % CI= 31 %- 65 %). In the sibling design, the heritability of perinatal <b>depression</b> was estimated at 44 % (95 % CI= 35 %- 52 %) and the heritability of nonperinatal <b>depression</b> at 32 % (95 % CI= 24 %- 41 %). Bivariate analysis showed that 14 % of the total variance (or 33 % of the genetic variance) in perinatal <b>depression</b> was unique for perinatal <b>depression.</b> CONCLUSIONS: The heritability of perinatal <b>depression</b> was estimated at 54 % and 44 %, respectively, in separate samples, and the heritability of nonperinatal <b>depression</b> at 32 %.
