50|$|A {{problem was}} {{discovered}} very {{late in the}} development of the TXE4 in that an equipment number could be threaded with the wrong <b>directory</b> <b>number</b> by mistake on the cyclic stores. Even worse it could be the <b>directory</b> <b>number</b> of another equipment number leading to multiple directory numbers. This would cause Number Unobtainable (NU) tone when the incorrectly threaded number was dialled and the double threading number received incorrect calls. The exchange had no way of detecting this but the programming of one of the MCUs allowed a separate programme to run to detect this problem and print out the locations of the duplicates. This had to be done on a regular basis. Eventually, after many more diagnostic routines had been added, this became known as Tester 299A, even though it was only software.|$|E

5000|$|Another limitation, {{less well}} known, {{is the number}} of directories. The ISO image has a {{structure}} called [...] "path table". For each directory in the image, the path table provides the number of its parent directory entry. The problem is that the parent <b>directory</b> <b>number</b> is a 16-bit number, limiting its range from 1 to 65,535. The content of each directory is written also in a different place, making the path table redundant, and suitable only for fast searching.|$|E
5000|$|A vector <b>directory</b> <b>number</b> (VdN) is an {{extension}} on an automatic call distributor that directs an incoming call to a [...] "vector"—a user-defined sequence of functions that may be performed, such as routing the call to a destination, giving a busy signal, or playing a recorded message. This number is a [...] "soft" [...] extension number not assigned to an equipment location. VDNs must be set up according to the customer's dial plan and the optional vectoring software must be enabled. VDN is used in different call center environments.|$|E
50|$|Some private branch {{exchange}} (PBX) telephone systems use a paging facility {{that acts as a}} liaison between the telephone and a PA amplifier. In other systems, paging equipment is not built into the telephone system. Instead the system includes a separate paging controller connected to a trunk port of the telephone system. The paging controller is accessed as either a designated <b>directory</b> <b>number</b> or central office line. In many modern systems, the paging function is integrated into the telephone system, and allows announcements to be played over the phone speakers.|$|E

5000|$|In the 1990s an {{epidemic}} of [...] "cloning" [...] cost the cellular carriers millions of dollars. An eavesdropper with specialized equipment could intercept a handset's ESN (Electronic Serial Number) and MDN or CTN (Mobile <b>Directory</b> <b>Number</b> or Cellular Telephone Number). The Electronic Serial Number, a 12-digit number sent by the handset to the cellular system for billing purposes, uniquely identified that phone on the network. The system then allowed or disallowed calls and or features based on its customer file. A person intercepting an ESN/MDN pair could clone the combination onto a different phone and use it in other areas for making calls without paying.|$|E

These directories contain files with names such as [...] "ABCD1234.JPG" [...] that consist of four alphanumeric characters (often [...] "DSC_", [...] "DSC0", [...] "DSCF", [...] "IMG_", [...] "MOV_", or [...] "P000"), followed by a number.DCF 2.0 adds support for DCF optional files recorded in an optional color space (that is, Adobe RGB rather than sRGB). Such files must be indicated by a leading [...] "_" [...] (as in [...] "_DSC" [...] instead of [...] "DSC_" [...] or [...] "DSC0").|$|E
50|$|The {{choice of}} the main type of memory used in the TXE2 (and the TXE4) was {{particularly}} characteristic of the general design philosophy, that the components used had to be of a technology that had been tested over many years. The choice thus went to the 'Dimond ring' type of memory, named after T. L. Dimond of Bell Laboratories, who invented them in 1945. They were large-diameter magnetic ferrite toroidal rings with solenoid windings, through which are threaded writing and reading wires. This set-up is shown fairly clearly in the picture (above) of the Ambergate Calling Number Generator (CNG) and Class of Service (COS) racks. These racks gave the ability to convert a subscriber's <b>directory</b> <b>number</b> into an equipment location identity. This was a considerable innovation in British exchanges, since in Strowger exchanges the directory and equipment numbers {{had to be the}} same.|$|E

50|$|Analogue mobile {{telephones}} were notorious for {{their lack of}} security. Casual listeners easily heard conversations as plain narrowband FM; eavesdroppers with specialized equipment readily intercepted handset Electronic Serial Numbers (ESN) and Mobile <b>Directory</b> <b>Numbers</b> (MDN or CTN, the Cellular Telephone Number) over the air. The intercepted ESN/MDN pairs would be cloned onto another handset and used in other regions for making calls. Due to widespread fraud, some carriers required a PIN before making calls or used a system of radio fingerprinting to detect the clones.|$|R
50|$|Before 1992, {{telephone}} numbers {{would consist of}} a 2 or 3-digit area code, and a 5 or 6-digit subscriber number. Example: (067) 85 000 and (04) 66 00 00. In that year, a closed telephone numbering plan was adopted, with eight-digit {{telephone numbers}} incorporating the area code and full number dialling for local and national calls. Service numbers were to be three digits long, <b>Directory</b> <b>numbers</b> four digits and some companies were allocated five-digit numbers, ex. 07575.GSM telephony was introduced in 1993, and those numbers always start with the digit '4' or '9'.|$|R
5000|$|The 118 118 {{advertising}} {{was originally}} launched using {{the two men}} dressed as athletic runners. Used with the catchphrase [...] "Got Your Number!", the runners' characters featured in a high-profile advertising and PR campaign leading up to deregulation in August 2003, when the original 192 <b>directory</b> <b>number</b> was switched off. This slogan has fallen into disuse by the marketing department of 118 118 because of the expansion of service beyond directory enquiries alone, but has lived on {{in the minds of}} the public. The use of the runners' characters is particularly noted for the legal action threatened, but never acted on, by 1970s record-breaking runner David Bedford. 118 118 responded to this by stating that their inspiration was partly the late American runner Steve Prefontaine. Bedford subsequently briefly worked for 118 500, a rival directory enquiries service provided by BT.|$|E
50|$|Line {{scanning}} circuits sequentially {{examined the}} state of each line, junctions and so on {{by means of a}} pulse many times a second and immediately after each pulse a data store (the Cyclic Store) offered the MCU permanent information relating to the line. When a calling condition was detected, the scanning pulse was passed to the MCU indicating to it that a new call had to be set up and busying it temporarily to further calls. As the first steps in dealing with the new call the MCU recorded the <b>directory</b> <b>number</b> and class of service (shared service, PABX line, incoming junction register, TOS and so on) information offered by the Cyclic Store and allocates one of its associated group of up to 30 registers. The registers were connected to peripheral terminals of the switching network, {{in the same way as}} subscribers' lines, junction circuits and other units and the MCU proceeded to issue instructions to the network to connect the subscriber and register terminals.|$|E
5000|$|A Mobile Station Roaming Number (MSRN) is an E.164 defined {{telephone}} number used to route telephone {{calls in a}} mobile network from a GMSC (Gateway Mobile Switching Centre) to the target MSC (see Network Switching Subsystem). It can also {{be defined as a}} <b>directory</b> <b>number</b> temporarily assigned to a mobile for a mobile terminated call. A MSRN is assigned for every mobile terminated call, not only the calls where the terminating MS lives on a different MSC than the originating MS. Although this seems unnecessary since many vendors' VLR's are integrated with the MSC, the GSM specification indicates that the MSC and VLR (Visitor Location Register) do not need to reside on the same switch. They are considered two different nodes as they have their own routing addresses. The MSRN is one of the returned parameters into SRI_Response message. In particular the MSRN is used into an MNP scenario (in this case it can be modified as 'RgN + MSISDN' ...|$|E

50|$|Subscriber {{information}} was programmed into the exchange in racks called cyclic stores which used PTFE wire threaded through magnetic cores known as 'Dimond ring' (see TXE2 section for more information). The information stored was the Class of Service (COS) i.e. PBX, CCB (payphone) or single line, {{followed by the}} <b>directory</b> <b>number.</b> The subscribers derived an equipment number from the position on the cyclic store rack. This was a six-digit number and {{referred to as the}} MUCKBL, which describes to the exchange where this is. In some parts of the exchange equipment was in the format of BUMCLK and this was used by engineers as a pseudo swear word. When a subscriber lifted their handset it sent a pulse down this wire, which was picked up by a 156 ms scanner, which initiated a path to be set up through the reed relays so the subscriber could be connected to a Register. This Register then returned dialling tone to the subscriber and dialling could commence.|$|E
50|$|A novel but {{subsequently}} disastrous feature {{designed by}} Bell Antwerp {{was used to}} hold the subscriber’s class of service information i.e. PBX, shared service, incoming calls barred (ICB), temporary out of service (TOS) etc. This was a capacitor store, and it held information on a thin plastic strip, into which could be inserted up to 10 little copper squares which had a capacitance of 10 pico farad. The thin plastic strips were then inserted into the Data Store rack, one at the position representing the <b>directory</b> <b>number</b> and another at the position representing the equipment number. This {{can be seen in}} the photograph together with some plastic strips hanging by wire. Hanging the strips by wire was a common practice for subscribers who were constantly changing their Class of Service, i.e. being made TOS. This information was then pulsed by the STC common control translator and appropriate action taken. STC had enormous trouble getting it to work, which caused a delay to the opening of the exchange. In the end the problem turned out to be cable interference requiring substantial re-cabling at the rear of the rack. This system was not used again and was replaced by a threaded-core store called Dimond Rings in TXE3, TXE4 and TXE2, which were extremely reliable.|$|E
50|$|The {{first task}} of the {{electronic}} control was to detect when a new call arrived. For this purpose each subscriber's line termination was examined {{for a period of}} 280 microseconds every 224 milliseconds, a process known as scanning. Junctions were scanned at eight times this rate. The scanning was carried out by a magnetic drum, each track of which is divided into 100 sections or words, one for each line. Parallel tracks were used for each 100 lines, one track providing the permanent (IDF) information (that is, <b>directory</b> <b>number</b> and class of service), another track gave a semi-permanent information (that is, whether the line was already engaged or parked because of PG conditions). Since the tracks are switched in sequence the information relating to each line could be read sequentially as the drum rotated, the angular position of the word together with the track number defining the equipment position that is, the line apparatus number of the line being scanned. The groups of 800 lines (junctions and subscribers) at Highgate Wood were divided into eight sub-groups, one sub-group for each track of the drum. In each sub-group the line units was arranged in ten columns of ten rows so that any line position could be defined by a ZXY code, Z for the sub-group, X for the column and Y for the rows.|$|E
