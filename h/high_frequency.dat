5|$|The {{durability}} and life of dynamically loaded, welded steel structures is determined {{in many cases}} by the welds, in particular the weld transitions. Through selective treatment of the transitions by grinding (abrasive cutting), shot peening, <b>High</b> <b>Frequency</b> Impact Treatment, etc. the durability of many designs increase significantly.|$|E

5000|$|The {{effect of}} {{dominant}} pole compensation is that gain is reduced at <b>higher</b> <b>frequencies.</b> There is increasingly less NFB at <b>high</b> <b>frequencies</b> {{due to the}} reduced loop gain. This is why amplifiers exhibit increased distortion for <b>higher</b> <b>frequency</b> components of a signal. In effect, transistor amplifiers start to become more [...] "tube like" [...] (employ less negative feedback and distort more) at <b>higher</b> <b>frequencies.</b>|$|R
50|$|In India, L-M20 has a <b>higher</b> <b>frequency</b> among Dravidian castes, but is {{somewhat}} rarer in Indo-Aryan castes. In Pakistan, it has <b>highest</b> <b>frequency</b> in Balochistan.|$|R
5|$|Thus, {{the work}} of many {{researchers}} enabled the use of electronics to convert signals into <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> oscillating currents, and via suitably shaped conductors, electricity permits the transmission and reception of these signals via radio waves over very long distances.|$|E
5|$|Capacitively coupled plasma (CCP): {{similar to}} glow {{discharge}} plasmas, but generated with <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> RF electric fields, typically 13.56 MHz. These differ from glow discharges {{in that the}} sheaths are much less intense. These are widely used in the microfabrication and integrated circuit manufacturing industries for plasma etching and plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition.|$|E
5|$|KAL007's {{divergence}} {{prevented the}} aircraft from transmitting its position via shorter range very <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> radio (VHF). It therefore requested KAL015, also {{en route to}} Seoul, to relay reports to air traffic control on its behalf. KAL007 requested KAL015 to relay its position three times. At 14:43UTC, KAL007 directly transmitted a change of {{estimated time of arrival}} for its next waypoint, NEEVA, to the international flight service station at Anchorage, but it did so over the longer range <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> radio (HF) rather than VHF. HF transmissions are able to carry a longer distance than VHF, but are vulnerable to electromagnetic interference and static; VHF is clearer with less interference, and preferred by flight crews. The inability to establish direct radio communications to be able to transmit their position directly did not alert the pilots of KAL007 of their ever-increasing divergence and was not considered unusual by air traffic controllers. Halfway between Bethel and waypoint NABIE, KAL007 passed through the southern portion of the North American Aerospace Defense Command buffer zone. This zone is north of Romeo 20 and off-limits to civilian aircraft.|$|E
2500|$|... "Ultraviolet" [...] means [...] "beyond violet" [...] (from Latin ultra, [...] "beyond"), violet {{being the}} color of the <b>highest</b> <b>frequencies</b> of visible light. Ultraviolet has a <b>higher</b> <b>frequency</b> than violet light.|$|R
5000|$|It {{reduces the}} {{bandwidth}} of the amplifier, thereby reducing available open loop gain at <b>higher</b> <b>frequencies.</b> This, in turn, reduces {{the amount of}} feedback available for distortion correction, etc. at <b>higher</b> <b>frequencies.</b>|$|R
50|$|Manufacturers usually {{advertise}} {{that their}} <b>higher</b> <b>frequency</b> systems improve audio quality and range. In the ideal case, <b>higher</b> <b>frequencies</b> actually have signal worse propagation {{as shown by}} the basic Friis transmission equation, and path loss tends to increase at <b>higher</b> <b>frequencies</b> as well. Practical influences on quality and range are signal strength, antenna quality, the method of modulation used, and interference, which varies locally.|$|R
5|$|Nominally {{based in}} Alaska, the Sea-based X-band Radar (SBX-1) arrived on Ford Island in 2006 for {{maintenance}} and repairs and has returned several times since. Primarily used as a warhead-detection radar system on a self-propelled floating platform in the Pacific, its presence on the island has been controversial. The platform, with a cost reaching nearly , has never actually made it to Alaska and conspiracy theorists argue that the platform is a mobile version of the <b>High</b> <b>Frequency</b> Active Auroral Research Program.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Hornets {{were very}} similar to the {{standard}} USNavy variants, but incorporated a number of minor modifications. These included the addition of an Instrument Landing System/Very <b>High</b> <b>Frequency</b> Omnidirectional Range (ILS/VOR) system, a high-frequency radio, a different ejection seat harness and the deletion of all equipment used only to launch the aircraft from catapults. In addition, two of the Australian aircraft were fitted with flight-test instrumentation so that they could be used as part of trials.|$|E
5|$|The {{winds are}} {{predominantly}} northern. Along the coastline the winds {{flow from the}} north in November – March, from the east in April – August and from the north-east in September – October. The sea breeze causes the <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> of eastern winds in summer. In the interior the predominant wind direction is more varied with northern winds being the most frequent in January – March and in October.|$|E
50|$|At the <b>higher</b> <b>frequencies</b> {{it is not}} {{possible}} to use lumped components for the tuned circuit. Instead methods such as stripline or resonant cavities are used. One design for ultra <b>high</b> <b>frequencies</b> (UHF) and super <b>high</b> <b>frequencies</b> (SHF) is a resonant λ/4 (quarter wave) rod which can vary in length. Another design for X-band (10 GHz) is a resonant cavity which can be changed in length.|$|R
50|$|The {{frequency}} and amplitude {{of the machine}} controls the finish of the parts. The frequencies can vary from 900 to 3600 cycles per minute (CPM) and the amplitude can vary from 0 to 3/16 in. <b>High</b> <b>frequencies,</b> 1800 CPM or greater, and small amplitudes are used for fine finishes or delicate parts, whereas large amplitudes are used for heavier cutting. <b>High</b> <b>frequencies</b> and amplitudes can roll burrs and peen edges. The circulation of parts is best at <b>higher</b> <b>frequencies,</b> therefore, heavy pieces are run at these <b>high</b> <b>frequencies</b> with moderate amplitudes of 3/32 to 1/8 in.|$|R
5000|$|The D {{layer is}} present {{during the day}} and it is a good {{absorber}} of radio waves, increasing losses, <b>Higher</b> <b>frequencies</b> are absorbed less, so <b>higher</b> <b>frequencies</b> tends to perform better during daytime.|$|R
5|$|A 1993 study {{proposed}} that the higher frequency of tooth breakage among Pleistocene carnivores compared with living carnivores was {{not the result of}} hunting larger game, something that might be assumed from the larger size of the former. When there is low prey availability, the competition between carnivores increases, causing them to eat faster and consume more bone, leading to tooth breakage. Compared to modern wolves, the <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> of tooth fracture in Beringian wolves indicates higher carcass consumption due to higher carnivore density and increased competition.|$|E
5|$|A Type 271 surface {{search radar}} {{replaced}} the fire-control director and rangefinder above the bridge. A Type 290 surface warning radar was added {{at the top}} of the foremast. A <b>High</b> <b>frequency</b> direction finding system was added on a pole mast aft. The ship also received a Type 242 IFF system. Two 4.7-inch guns were removed, one each forward and aft, and the forward gun was replaced by a Hedgehog anti-submarine spigot mortar. The 3-inch anti-aircraft gun amidships was also removed, but the number of 20mm AA guns was increased to six.|$|E
5|$|Another common process, {{explosion}} welding, {{involves the}} joining of materials by pushing them together under extremely high pressure. The {{energy from the}} impact plasticizes the materials, forming a weld, even though only {{a limited amount of}} heat is generated. The process is commonly used for welding dissimilar materials, such as the welding of aluminum with steel in ship hulls or compound plates. Other solid-state welding processes include friction welding (including friction stir welding), magnetic pulse welding, co-extrusion welding, cold welding, diffusion bonding, exothermic welding, <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> welding, hot pressure welding, induction welding, and roll welding.|$|E

5|$|Native Americans have {{inhabited}} the Table Rocks area {{for at least}} 15,000 years before European-American settlement. Starting in the mid-19th century during a gold rush, the settlers forced the Takelma tribe away from the Table Rocks and into reservations. The surrounding area was quickly developed. The Table Rock post office was established in 1872, an airstrip was built atop Lower Table Rock in 1948, and a very <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> omni-directional range (VOR) aviation tower was constructed on Upper Table Rock in the 1960s. The Table Rocks were not protected until the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|Reflections in {{more complex}} scenarios, such as {{found on a}} network of cables, can result in very {{complicated}} and long lasting waveforms on the cable. Even a simple overvoltage pulse entering a cable system as uncomplicated as the power wiring found in a typical private home can result in an oscillatory disturbance as the pulse is reflected to and fro from multiple circuit ends. These ring waves as they are known persist for far longer than the original pulse and their waveforms bears little obvious resemblance to the original disturbance, containing <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> components {{in the tens of}} MHz range.|$|E
5|$|Tantalum is inert against most acids except {{hydrofluoric}} acid and hot sulfuric acid, and hot alkaline solutions also cause tantalum to corrode. This property {{makes it a}} useful metal for chemical reaction vessels and pipes for corrosive liquids. Heat exchanging coils for the steam heating of hydrochloric acid are made from tantalum. Tantalum was extensively used {{in the production of}} ultra <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> electron tubes for radio transmitters. The tantalum is capable of capturing oxygen and nitrogen by forming nitrides and oxides and therefore helps to sustain the high vacuum needed for the tubes.|$|E

25|$|One {{can think}} of MEMS {{resonators}} as small bells that ring at <b>high</b> <b>frequencies.</b> Small bells ring at <b>higher</b> <b>frequencies</b> than large bells, and since MEMS resonators are small they can ring at <b>high</b> <b>frequencies.</b> Common bells are meters down to centimeters across and ring at hundreds of hertz to kilohertz; MEMS resonators are {{a tenth of a}} millimeter across and ring at tens of kilohertz to hundreds of megahertz.

These observations indicate that the synchronisation between CNST and PAWA is a form of generalised synchronisation.|$|R
5|$|The {{attitude}} was controlled with three hydrazine thrusters. The satellite transmitted data {{back to the}} ground with S-Band and Very <b>High</b> <b>Frequency</b> (VHF) transmitters, at a rate of 15 Mbit/s and 6 bit quantization. The satellite had three-axis fine attitude control with four wheels, which gave it +/- 0.7 degrees of control. The attitude control system also used horizon scanners, sun sensors, and a command antenna. A freon gas propulsion system allowed the satellite to make fine attitude adjustments. Landsat 2 could store 30 minutes worth of data on two wide-band video tape recorders.|$|E
25|$|Early {{conventional}} tube {{systems were}} limited to the <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> bands, and although very <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> systems became widely available in the late 1930s, the ultra <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> and microwave regions were well beyond the ability of conventional circuits.
