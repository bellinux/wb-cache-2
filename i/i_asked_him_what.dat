He wanted two warts (moles) removed {{on the right}} lower {{forehead}} between the eyes and one at the left angle, outer angle of the left eye; wanted a depression of the nose filled in; a scar; a large one {{to the left of}} the median line of the upper lip excised, wanted his dimples removed and wanted the angle of the mouth drawn up. He didn't say anything about the fingers that day to me.|$|E
500|$|The {{circumstances}} of Arjen and Bernadien's first meeting {{have been reported}} by his former youth coach, Barend Beltman: [...] "Arjen was driven and determined at a young age. He was always on time, never late. But one Friday afternoon he showed up 15 minutes past the start of practice. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>what</b> was going on. 'We were at the market square, having fun,' he said. There were some girls {{with him and his}} friends, so I asked, 'Was she worth it?' 'Yes, trainer, she was,' he told me. I told him to get his gear and join the training session. At his wedding, I heard the woman he met that day was now his wife and mother of his children. Bernadien is her name." ...|$|E

Montague, a {{hardened}} reporter on a highly anti-Roosevelt newspaper, {{walking up and}} down and cursing. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>what</b> moved him to these expletives. 'Roosevelt, damn him,' said Montague; 'I can't keep hating him if I get anywhere within twenty feet of him, and I'm always accidentally doing it. He's spoiling my story.'" ...|$|E

"If <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> the farmer, the manufacturer, the merchant, the tradesman, {{and down}} {{through all the}} occupations of life to the common laborer, what service monarchy is to him, he can give me no answer. If <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>what</b> monarchy is, he {{believes}} it is something like a sinecure." ...|$|R

'E was loiterin' about until <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>'im</b> <b>what</b> 'is business was, for I didn't {{care about the}} looks of 'im, or the way that 'e was peepin' in at the windows.

2500|$|Realizing {{that the}} matter was of highly {{political}} significance for {{the relation between the}} SS and the Army, I called immediately on my military superior ..., Dr. Dornberger. He informed me that the SS had for a long time been trying to get their [...] "finger in the pie" [...] of the rocket work. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>what</b> to do. He replied on the spot that if I wanted to continue our mutual work, I had no alternative but to join.|$|E
2500|$|Smith {{relocated}} to Hiram, Ohio, in September 1831. Smith and Rigdon were tarred and feathered at the John Johnson Farm on March 24, 1832. Smith recorded: [...] "The next morning I {{went to see}} elder Rigdon, and found him crazy, and his head highly inflamed, for they had dragged him by his heels, and those too, so high from the earth he could not raise his head from the rough frozen surface, which lascerated it exceedingly; {{and when he saw}} me he called to his wife to bring him his razor. She asked him what he wanted of it? and he replied to kill me. Sister Rigdon left the room, and he asked me to bring his razor. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>what</b> he wanted of it, and he replied he wanted to kill his wife, and he continued delirious some days." ...|$|E
2500|$|... “There were a {{great many}} cowboys with the show. [...] There was a chief of the cowboys who had general {{supervision}} over both horses and men. [...] When an unbroken horse would be brought in, this cowboy chief would give it to an Indian to ride bareback. [...] After the animal was well broken, it would {{be taken away from}} the Indian and given to a cowboy to ride. [...] Then the Indian would be given another unbroken horse. [...] For a while we said nothing about it, but finally it began to be just a little too much to stand. [...] One day one of the Indians came to me just before it was time to enter the arena. [...] His horse was saddled and bridled, but he was leading the horse by the bridle. [...] <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>what</b> was the matter, and {{he said it was a}} wild horse and he was not going to ride it into the arena. [...] I went to the chief cowboy and said, ‘I do not think you are doing right. [...] You know our Indian boys have to ride bareback, but you always give them the wild horses to ride. [...] Then, when they have the horse nicely broken, you give to a cowboy. [...] Why don’t you give the wild horses to the cowboys to break in? [...] They ride on saddles, and it would not be so hard for them.’ [...] But the chief cowboy only said, “Well, I can’t be bothered by a little thing like that. [...] You will have to see Buffalo Bill about the horses.’ [...] But I retorted, “You know very well that Buffalo Bill does not know what you do with the horses. [...] He does not know that you give the wild ones to the Indian boys to ride until they are broken in. [...] Give that horse back to that Indian boy or he will not go into the arena today.’ [...] That was all, but the boy got his horse in time to enter the arena with the others. [...] Just as I was ready to go back to the Indians, I looked at Buffalo Bill, and he had a twinkle in his eye. [...] After that, we had no more trouble with the horses. [...] Although Buffalo Bill never said anything to me, I knew he had fixed things to our satisfaction.” ...|$|E

6000|$|A sailor {{was near}} me coiling the {{loosened}} mooring-rope on the deck. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> to <b>what</b> port the vessel was bound. The {{man looked at}} me in surly amazement, and answered: ...|$|R
5000|$|..... "I {{was just}} a kid when I read Spoon River for the first time: Cesare Pavese brought it to me, one morning when <b>I</b> had <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>what</b> was the {{difference}} between American and English literature." ...|$|R

60|$|I {{examined}} the blank, {{and sure enough}} the wary Boston h. c. had thoughtfully concealed that statistic. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> at <b>what</b> hour it had started from Boston. He answered up as brightly as ever, and said he didn't know.|$|R
60|$|It was {{the first}} thing he had said that made me respect him. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>what</b> had led him to the discovery.|$|E

6000|$|It was for me, then, to say [...] "Oh!" [...] But I {{hope that}} no more than civil {{surprise}} appeared in my voice when <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> to <b>what,</b> then, <b>I</b> owed the pleasure. [...] . He was reaching for an inside pocket leisurely.|$|R
6000|$|... "My brother says he's {{going to}} Newcome, Barnes, next week," [...] said the Baronet, wishing {{to make the}} {{conversation}} more interesting to the newly arrived Colonel.

60|$|All {{this with}} a solemn countenance and in deep {{measured}} tones. Yet somehow I got an irresistible conviction that he was exasperated by something in particular.

60|$|The {{next person}} I came across was a dapper little {{man in a}} {{beautiful}} white wig, whom I saw to be a barber on his rounds; and knowing well that barbers were great gossips, <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> plainly <b>what</b> sort of a man was Mr Balfour of the Shaws.|$|R
60|$|One {{thing had}} {{struck me as}} curious about these hussars--that they {{pronounced}} French with the utmost difficulty.
