5|$|After the {{war ended}} with the defeat of Japan in 1945, the ban on nonessential {{construction}} was lifted, and the state restarted construction and restoration activities in Constitution Square in 1948. These activities included restoring and re-roofing the buildings, adding furniture to the buildings, constructing walkways, erecting signs, and adding landscaping to the park. The restorations were completed in 1955. From 1960 to 1968, the state added a <b>fence</b> <b>around</b> the site, installed a new lighting and diorama system, constructed {{a replica of the}} square's original pillory, and renovated several buildings, including an early 19th-century brick schoolhouse which became the caretaker's residence.|$|E
5|$|An autopsy reveals Wells' {{death was}} the result of an asthma attack. However the ambitious {{district}} attorney, Gordon Roberts (Robert Wisden) believes Plott is somehow responsible. The investigation stalls until another child, Danielle Barbakow (Lauren Diewold), mentions overhearing Wells being physically abused by Plott. Plott is arrested by Sherman, who she reprimands sternly, reminding him that she looked after him as a child too, and has never been accused of anything in three decades of childcare work. Sherman sees she is incapable of what she has been accused of and continues to send his son to the daycare, but other parents protest, to the point of picketing and vandalizing the <b>fence</b> <b>around</b> the daycare.|$|E

5|$|Historical data {{prior to}} 1700 is sparse {{due to lack}} of {{significant}} European settlements along the coastline; the few storms listed are largely records from Roanoke Colony and later the Province of Carolina. Modern meteorologists believe early storms were tropical cyclones, though due to the time period confirmation is impossible. One theory explaining the disappearance of Roanoke Colony suggests a hurricane destroyed the village, though {{there is no evidence to}} prove the theory. It is considered unlikely {{due to lack of}} damage to a <b>fence</b> <b>around</b> the village, on which the villagers left an inscription.|$|E
5|$|The Israeli Defense Minister Israel Navon (Doron Tavory) {{moves to}} {{a house on the}} border between Israel and the West Bank, with the {{building}} sitting on the Israeli side just next to the dividing line. The Israeli Secret Service views the neighboring lemon grove of Salma Zidane (Hiam Abbass), a Palestinian widow whose family has cared for the area for generations, {{as a threat to the}} minister and his wife. The security forces soon set up a guard post and a <b>fence</b> <b>around</b> the grove. They then obtain an order to uproot the lemon trees.|$|E

They enter the house with a few men, and find that it is lit from glass windows in the ceiling, so that the daylight illuminates the room and there are no shadows to be seen due to this. There were depictions of many gods there and a woman who is described as well dressed near the door.|$|E

50|$|Camp Red Cloud {{has been}} the site of various protests and demonstrations against the US {{presence}} in Korea. The largest such protest was in 2002 when Korean protesters tossed molotov cocktails and cut holes in the <b>fences</b> <b>around</b> the post. This demonstration was {{in reaction to the}} Yangju highway incident in which a US military vehicle had run over two school girls. <b>Fences</b> <b>around</b> the post have since been replaced with concrete walls.|$|R

5|$|A log {{portion of}} the {{original}} Oklahoma Row was moved north and now sits {{on the east side}} of Highway 94 in Monte Ne. It is used for storage. The three-story concrete-and-stone tower still stands and remains above water on the edge of Beaver Lake. This section is often incorrectly referred to as the bank building and the honeymoon suite. Monte Ne was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978 because of the historic significance of being so closely associated with Harvey and its unique architecture and engineering. Despite this, what is left of Monte Ne has fallen victim to severe neglect and vandalism. It is covered with spray paint and graffiti, as well as being cracked and full of debris. In 2011 the fire department was called to help a person who had climbed to the top floor and gotten stuck in the chimney. Because of this incident and the general state of the remains, the Army Corps of Engineers erected a temporary barbed wire <b>fence</b> <b>around</b> the tower.|$|E
5|$|Caudy {{never learned}} to write in English; he signed his last will and {{testament}} with an X mark in 1784. Caudy died on March 15, 1784, and was interred on his property south of present-day Capon Bridge. According to local tradition, Caudy was buried with a Native American on either side of him. Another tradition says he was buried with his horse. The site of Caudy's interment is located on property now known as Hartford Bealer farm. In the 1930s, Caudy's burial site was attended to by a local Boy Scouts troop, who landscaped the site and planted shrubbery. By 1976, Caudy's burial place was marked with four posts. In 2002, the Capon Bridge Ruritan Club removed the overgrown shrubs and erected a white <b>fence</b> <b>around</b> Caudy's interment site. The project was initiated by Capon Bridge area residents Roy Giffin, Ken Edmonds, and Roberta Munske. The Ruritans purchased a marble marker and erected it on the site at 9 a.m. on November 15, 2003. The burial site is accessible and visible from Christian Church Road, West Virginia Secondary Route 13.|$|E

The original hand rails, as well as the original iron maidens were also painted yellow. Two fences that were at the south end of each platform retained their paint color; the one on the Woodlawn bound platform would later be replaced with a second Communication Room.|$|R
25|$|The Super Bowl was {{considered}} a level one national security event. To that end, the New Jersey State Police and the NFL host committee installed a 2.5-mile chain-link perimeter <b>fence</b> <b>around</b> the Meadowlands Sports Complex, which {{is located at the}} intersection of a number of highways. Security planners stated that access to the area would be strictly limited and regulated. To that end, parking spaces were greatly reduced, tailgate parties restricted and walking to the venue strictly prohibited. Taxis and limousines were not permitted to drop off passengers. Passengers for trains to the stadium were limited in what they carry and were screened before boarding.|$|E
25|$|The word wicket is also {{sometimes}} {{used to refer}} to the cricket pitch itself. According to the Laws of Cricket, this usage is incorrect, but it is in common usage and commonly understood by cricket followers. This usage probably derives from the days when the outfield was kept short by grazing sheep on it and the playing surface, which was specially prepared, was protected from them by a light wicker <b>fence</b> <b>around</b> it. Since many regular grounds had resident bat-makers {{it is quite possible that}} the branches cut off from the willow wood used for the bats formed all or part of this fence.|$|E
