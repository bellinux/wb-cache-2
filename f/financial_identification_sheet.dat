Six samples from the Mafra county: Barril, Carvalhal, Ericeira, Casal do Rodo, Malveira and two from Encarnação are selected. Two samples were selected from neighboring regions, Sintra and Loures. Samples were characterized for physical-chemical, sensory, and thermal properties as well image analysis of the bread slices. The results were submitted to analysis of variance (ANOVA) and multivariate analysis (Principal Components Analysis and Cluster). The analysis of <b>identification</b> <b>sheets</b> showed that bread from the region of Mafra differs from the conventional production process. Higher mixing times and lower fermentation times and levels of yeast used, are the main differences encountered. Results from bread samples from Alentejo were added to our results in order to evaluate discrimination ability among various regions. Through statistical treatment a complete differentiation of the Alentejo samples and samples from Mafra and bordering regions were achieved. Associated to the difference found between the neighboring regions and Mafra breads are the variables aw, firewood taste, chroma, density, hardness and Young's modulus. In conclusion, due to its characteristics, a potential PGI can be applied to Mafra's Bread...|$|R
