A detailed survey was carried out, which included the use of laser and infra-red measuring devices from within a helicopter, and numerous <b>field</b> <b>trips</b> to determine the final alignment and bridge sites.

I tis clear that alll studied are strongly impacted by human acticity. The frequency of relic species were (Dragons and Ground beetles) 20 % only on all studied plots 80, 00 %.

40|$|English {{is one of}} the {{international}} languages which is very important. It is taught in elementary school as a local content subject and in junior high school until universities as a compulsory subject. The ability of using English in speaking becomes the objective of most English teaching nowadays. By mastering English speaking, the people are able to communicate with other people in the world. Moreover, by learning English speaking, the students gain a valuable skill which can be useful in their lives and contribute to their community and country. In this thesis, the researcher tried to prove the theory that <b>field</b> <b>trip</b> could improve students' speaking ability. Therefore, the researcher determined to conduct her research using <b>field</b> <b>trip</b> method to improve students' speaking competence. She chose role-play as the activities during <b>field</b> <b>trip</b> to promote speaking. For the material, the researcher used descriptive text. It was because the material related with the topics chosen in this research, they were describing business places and describing things. The researcher preferred to u e <b>field</b> <b>trip</b> because it gave learning English-speaking fun by observing the authentic objects. The design of this research was Collaborative Classroom Action Research. The researcher conducted in two cycles for six meetings. One cycle consisted of four elements, they were: planning, implementing, observing and reflecting. Moreover, the researcher used instruments to collect the data through observation checklist, field notes, questionnaire and the assessment fonn. The researcher discussed the data as the result of study in descriptive qualitative manner. In the implementation of <b>field</b> <b>trip,</b> the researcher conducted the activities, they were: at the first meeting was the <b>field</b> <b>trip</b> preparation. Here the teacher informed the short <b>field</b> <b>trip,</b> prepared role play, and reviewed the material of descriptive text. At the second meeting was short <b>field</b> <b>trip,</b> here the students implemented the short <b>field</b> <b>trip</b> by visiting the real objects outside the classroom and wrote the vocabularies used during short <b>field</b> <b>trip.</b> At the third meeting was the post trip. Here, the students performed role-play based on their experience, and submitted the swnmary of <b>field</b> <b>trip</b> in the fonn of short writing. While performed role-play in this meeting, the teacher assessed students speaking ability. In the post trip, the researcher used the assessment form to get the students speaking score. Therefore, the researcher knew the improvement of students' speaking ability after implementing the method. The data of students' speaking score showed that the students' speaking ability was improved. That in the first cycle the average of their•speaking competence was in level 1 + that means students were able to ask and answer questions on topics very familiar to them, but in the last cycle the students could improve at level 2 + and level 3. It means that the students were able to participate actively in simple conversation, control of grammar gcod, and their errors never interfere with understanding. Furthermore, the researcher gave the students questionnaire sheet to know their responSts after applying the method. Based on the result of questionnaire, the researcher concluded that most of students liked the <b>field</b> <b>trip</b> method in speaking learning. It was proved by 90 % students said that <b>field</b> <b>trip</b> made them comfortable communicate using English, furthermore 100 % students admitted that by implementing <b>field</b> <b>trip</b> method, their experience in learning speaking could be fun. Finally, this research is expected to give useful contribution for teacher and students in teaching learning process of English lesson, especially for speaking skill. Moreover, it {{is expected to be a}} reference to help other researchers who conduct the wider research in the same field...|$|R

5|$|When {{designing}} the game's fictional locations, the team tried to represent iconic {{features of the}} American frontier; New Austin features small towns and outposts, Nuevo Paraíso includes rebel outposts and Mexican army forts, and West Elizabeth represents the civilized areas of the world. These three locations represent a developing nation, a province {{on the brink of}} war, and an advanced nation, respectively. The American frontier was extensively researched for the game. The team organized <b>field</b> <b>trips</b> to Washington, visited the Library of Congress, captured a multitude of photographs, and analyzed various classic Western films. A challenge that the team faced {{as a direct result of}} the world's size was to include enough content to interest players. Using this challenge as a strength and a major part of the design process, the team tried to make the countryside wild, with a variety of potential events to occur. They initially believed that it was possible to use the formula of Grand Theft Auto IV (2008)—a large variety of mission styles with different activities and objectives—in Red Dead Redemption; as development continued, they realized that the emptiness of the world resulted in the inability to use this formula.|$|E
