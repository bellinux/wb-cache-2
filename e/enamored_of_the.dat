25|$|Napoléon I was <b>enamored</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Grand Trianon {{and ordered}} the {{building}} remodeled and redecorated for his and his family's use. During the reign of Louis-Philippe, the Grand Trianon was an especial favorite residence of the king and royal family.

25|$|Raza was {{initially}} <b>enamored</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bucolic countryside of rural France. Eglise {{is part of}} a series which captures the rolling terrain and quaint village architecture of this region. Showing a tumultuous church engulfed by an inky blue night sky, Raza uses gestural brushstrokes and a heavily impasto-ed application of paint, stylistic devices which hint at his later 1970s abstractions.|$|E

In 1998 a book was {{published}} (Haiku: This Other World) with 817 of his own favorite haikus. Many of these haikus have an uplifting quality even as they deal with coming to terms with loneliness, death, and the forces of nature.|$|E

40|$|Many are <b>enamored</b> <b>of</b> recapitalizing <b>the</b> banking sector by injecting {{government}} funds into distressed banks {{in exchange for}} preferred stock and equity warrants. This appears to be <b>the</b> core <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Treasury's most recent plan. Jonathan Carmel points out that this approach can actually create more problems than it solves by adding to the bank's debt overhang problem. If public funds are to be used, a better approach is to directly capitalize the banks by buying common stock and distributing it to taxpayers, suggests Carmel. ...|$|R

25|$|Hermes Conrad (Phil LaMarr) – Hermes is the Jamaican {{accountant}} of Planet Express. A 36th-level bureaucrat (demoted {{to level}} 37 during the series) {{and proud of}} it, he is a stickler for regulation and <b>enamored</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tedium of paperwork and bureaucracy. Hermes is also a former champion in Olympic Limbo, a sport derived from the popular party activity. He gave up limbo after the 2980 Olympics when a young fan, imitating him, broke his back and died.

25|$|Even so, it wasn't until February 1452 that Charles finally {{consented to}} see d'Estouteville. In his {{capacity}} as papal legate, he {{handed over the}} inquiry to the Inquisitor of France, Jean Bréhal. On 2 May 1452, the inquisitor questioned witnesses connected with the case, followed by more thorough testimony beginning on May 8. This inquiry included most of the former tribunal members who were still living. Though Charles was keen to know the facts behind the case, he was not <b>enamored</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thought of the Inquisition running a high-profile case in France outside of royal control. But through d'Estouteville's intervention, by December 1452 the case {{had taken on a}} life of its own, independent of Charles.|$|E
25|$|After leaving Quicksilver in October 1970, Cipollina formed Copperhead, {{which was}} {{initially}} a loose and variable aggregation before coalescing around the less transitory lineup of Cipollina, Gary Philippet (vocals, guitar and organ), Jim McPherson (vocals, bass and piano) and David Weber (drums). Although Clive Davis was particularly <b>enamored</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> group and signed {{them to a}} lucrative deal with Columbia Records, their eponymous 1973 debut failed to gain traction in the marketplace despite heavy touring, leading to Columbia refusing to release their second album and hastening their disbandment. Unable to secure a major label contract {{in the aftermath of}} the 1975 Quicksilver reunion, he continued to perform regularly with many other Bay Area acts (including a joint venture with Nick Gravenites, who had co-produced Quicksilver's debut) before becoming a founding member of The Dinosaurs in 1982. In 1974, Cipollina guested with Quicksilver-idolizing Welsh progressive rock group Man, playing with them at their 1974 Winterland concerts and on a subsequent UK tour; these efforts resulted in the 1975 live album Maximum Darkness. He died in 1989 at the age of 45 from complications of emphysema exacerbated by Alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency.|$|E
25|$|Another popular running gag {{concerned}} <b>the</b> social habits <b>of</b> Benny's on-air orchestra, {{who were}} consistently {{portrayed as a}} bunch of drunken ne'er-do-wells. Led first by Phil Harris and later by Bob Crosby, the orchestra, and in particular band member Frank Remley, were jokingly portrayed as often being too drunk to play properly, using an overturned bass drum to play cards on just minutes before a show, and so <b>enamored</b> <b>of</b> liquor that <b>the</b> sight <b>of</b> {{a glass of milk}} would make them sick. Remley was portrayed in various unflattering situations, such as being thrown into a garbage can by a road sweeper who had found him passed out in the street at 4am, and on a wanted poster at the Beverly Hills police station.|$|R
25|$|Mickie James {{debuted in}} WWE on the October 10, 2005 episode of Raw, under her real name, as an obsessed fan <b>of</b> Trish Stratus. <b>The</b> storyline had James and Stratus {{competing}} together in tag team matches, with James' character becoming increasingly infatuated with Stratus. This led to various angles including a Halloween Costume Contest in which James was dressed like Stratus and helped Stratus retain the Women's Championship in a Fulfill Your Fantasy Battle Royal at Taboo Tuesday by eliminating herself and Victoria {{at the same}} time to even utilizing Stratus' signature finishing moves as her own during matches. Subsequently, the storyline between Mickie and Trish also developed into a lesbian angle after Mickie had a kiss with Trish under a sprig <b>of</b> mistletoe. In <b>the</b> championship match at the pay-per-view, James lost to Stratus, but continued to be <b>enamored</b> <b>of</b> her <b>the</b> next night on Raw, and she confessed her love for Stratus at the Royal Rumble. On March 6, 2006, the storyline had Stratus confronting James, telling her that they needed time apart from each other.|$|R

Intent on taking action against the mechanic's family to right the wrong suffered by her mother, the daughter begins to lose her grip on sanity when she finds out that the men she suspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rape are actually innocent. In fact, her father had long ago exacted his own vengeance on the real culprits. This knowledge pushes her over the edge, and she has to be institutionalized. Meanwhile, the young mechanic misunderstands what happened and that leads to tragedy; he tracks down and kills the innocent men Elle had suspected of raping her mother, believing them to be responsible for Elle's current condition.|$|R
500|$|Andersen biographer Alison Prince {{believes}} the tale to be a parable representing {{the different kinds}} of love. When the Snowman asks the dog why a young man and woman stroll about the wintry garden hand-in-hand, the disillusioned old dog tells him the two are engaged and will soon be moving into [...] "the same kennel together and sharing each other's bones". The Snowman has a different idea of love, being <b>enamored</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stove. Prince considers the image of the poker found within the Snowman's remains [...] "a homoerotic image of such potency that a failure to spot it seems inconceiveable." ...|$|E
500|$|Though Judas Priest did {{not have}} a top 40 album in the United States until 1980, for many it was the {{definitive}} post-Sabbath heavy metal band; its twin-guitar attack, featuring rapid tempos and a non-bluesy, more cleanly metallic sound, was a major influence on later acts. While heavy metal was growing in popularity, most critics were not <b>enamored</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> music. Objections were raised to metal's adoption of visual spectacle and other trappings of commercial artifice, but the main offense was its perceived musical and lyrical vacuity: reviewing a Black Sabbath album in the early 1970s, leading critic Robert Christgau described it as [...] "dull and decadent...dim-witted, amoral exploitation." ...|$|E
500|$|Dixon was <b>enamored</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{technique}} of binaural recording, {{and used it}} extensively on the album. Easter recalled that Dixon [...] "made this sort of fake binaural head out of a cardboard box and stuck two microphones in it" [...] to record the group. In Easter's opinion the method made drummer Bill Berry's parts [...] "fresher sounding". Binaural recording also allowed bassist Mike Mills' backing vocals to be loud without covering up Stipe's lead vocals. Dixon explained, [...] "Mike Mills was often singing 12 to 15 {{feet away from the}} microphones that were recording his part, but because it was in a studio binaural field, we would tend to hear him as behind [...]" ...|$|E

No one in the office wants to set up any of their friends with Michael, but when Michael learns that the chair model had died in a car crash some time ago, Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) takes pity and sets him up on a blind date with her landlady (Brooke Dillman). The date does not go well, beginning with Michael pretending he is not who {{she was supposed to be}} meeting. After Michael admits his own blind date was a failure, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) convinces him that he needs closure on this person he loved who is gone.

500|$|By the mid-1950s, Stengel was {{becoming}} a national figure, familiar from television broadcasts of the Yankees on NBC's Game of the Week, and from managing in most World Series and All-Star Games during his tenure. National magazines such as Look and [...] Sports Illustrated did feature stories about Stengel, and his turn of phrase became known as [...] "Stengelese". The magazines not only told stories about the manager's one-liners and jokes, but recounted the pranks from his playing days, such as the grapefruit dropped from the plane and the sparrow under the cap. According to Richard Bak in his biography of Stengel, [...] "people across the country grew <b>enamored</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> grandfatherly fellow whose funny looks and fractured speech were so {{at odds with the}} Yankees' bloodless corporate image".|$|E

500|$|A {{group of}} Democrats {{nominated}} Landon Carter Haynes to oppose Johnson as he sought a fifth term; the Whigs were so {{pleased with the}} internecine battle among the Democrats {{in the general election}} that they did not nominate a candidate of their own. The campaign included fierce debates: Johnson's main issue was the passage of the Homestead Bill; Haynes contended it would facilitate abolition. Johnson won the election by more than 1600 votes. Though he was not <b>enamored</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> party's presidential nominee in 1852, former New Hampshire senator Franklin Pierce, Johnson campaigned for him. Pierce was elected, but he failed to carry Tennessee. In 1852, Johnson managed to get the House to pass his Homestead Bill, but it failed in the Senate. The Whigs had gained control of the Tennessee legislature, and, under the leadership of Gustavus Henry, redrew the boundaries of Johnson's First District to make it a safe seat for their party. The Nashville Union termed this [...] "Henry-mandering"; lamented Johnson, [...] "I have no political future." ...|$|E
500|$|Several reviewers {{described}} book as clever, well written, engaging, amusing, and fun. The prose {{was described}} as [...] "effortless", [...] "colorful", [...] "kinetic and often witty". Numerous reviewers thought the Dr. Impossible character was {{the highlight of the}} novel. The Library Journal review [...] "highly recommended [...] for all public libraries" [...] calling it [...] "fun and thought-provoking book". In The New York Times Book Review reviewer Dave Itzkoff wrote that the novel [...] "can't completely measure up , but its ambition and persistence in the face of formidable odds make it an admirable addition to the genre". The Publishers Weekly review noted that the comic book scenario written in a prose novel, with [...] "thoughtfully portrayed" [...] characters, would broaden the appeal of the genre. Similarly, regarding the comic book set-up written in prose, Mat Johnson in USA Today wrote that Grossman's [...] "fabulist vision is meticulously captured so that it might be gleefully explored, nostalgically, within its traditional boundaries". Journalist Carlo Wolff wrote that [...] "it takes some time to engage because...Grossman is so <b>enamored</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> worlds he's fashioning that he overstuffs them... is a fresh, warm take on comic books, science fiction and pop culture." [...] The Kirkus Reviews summary notes that the action scenes are [...] "unimpressive, interrupted by more talk as...the battle seesaws in an arbitrary fashion. For all the special effects, a debut novel that's lifeless and inert."

500|$|In a {{contemporary}} review, Rolling Stone critic Rob Tannenbaum found Emotions dependent on [...] "commercial dance-pop" [...] and Carey's indulgent vocal exercises, {{making it difficult}} for listeners to connect with the lyrics. [...] "Carey has a remarkable vocal gift, but to date, unfortunately, her singing has been far more impressive than expressive," [...] Tannenbaum wrote. Dennis Hunt from the Los Angeles Times said Carey's [...] "spectacular and impressive" [...] voice was comparable to that of Whitney Houston, but criticized the songwriting and production for [...] "playing high on the angst scale." [...] In The New York Times, Stephen Holden believed the record showcased Carey's vocal strengths more effectively than her debut, but showed no improvement in writing lyrics, which Holden said [...] "describe the rapturous highs and desperate lows of romance in blunt, strung-together pop clichés, with minimal rhyming." [...] Arion Berger from Entertainment Weekly found the record [...] "colder and more calculated" [...] than Carey's debut, describing Emotions as [...] "the hybrid progeny of a venerable tradition — the tradition of the R diva — and crass commercial instincts. it's gospel without soul, love songs without passion, pop without buoyancy." [...] Orlando Sentinel editor Parry Gettelman was also critical of Carey's vocal acrobatics, writing that the singer had become [...] "so <b>enamored</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ultra-high-frequency part of her range that I'm starting to suspect she may be an intergalactic spy trying to re- establish communications with the far-off Planet of Dogs." [...] Steve Morse from The Boston Globe was more enthusiastic in his review, deeming Emotions [...] "a quantum leap in maturity and confidence" [...] from her first album. He called the lyrics [...] "remarkable," [...] the ballads [...] "unspeakably beautiful," [...] and Carey's vocal and songwriting ability [...] "unlimited." ...|$|E
