5|$|After sending Stewie out {{for more}} paper, Paul finds several news {{articles}} in an album that imply Wilkes is actually a serial killer. Just then, the local sheriff (Joe) appears, and is surprised to find Paul there. Before he can help him, however, Stewie blows his legs off with a shotgun. The sheriff then complains that he will now {{have to spend the}} rest of his life in a wheelchair, only to be shot again and killed by Stewie. Paul finally finishes the book and demands Stewie let him go, but Stewie refuses, knowing he could try to turn him/her <b>in</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> police and tell them s/he kidnapped him, held him hostage, and fondled him in his sleep, which Paul did not know originally. Paul's ultimate fate is left ambiguous as the story ends with a Magnum, P.I.-style credits roll.|$|E
5|$|Architecture {{in modern}} Scotland {{encompasses}} all building in Scotland, between {{the beginning of}} the twentieth century and the present day. The most significant architect of the early twentieth century was Charles Rennie Mackintosh, who mixed elements of traditional Scottish architecture with contemporary movements. Estate house design declined in importance in the twentieth century. In the early decades of the century, traditional materials began to give way to cheaper modern ones. After the First World War modernism and the office block began to dominate building in the major cities and attempts began to improve the quality of urban housing for the poor, resulted in a massive programme of council house building. The Neo-Gothic style continued <b>in</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> twentieth century but the most common forms in this period were plain and massive Neo-Romanesque buildings.|$|E

5|$|As {{a patron}} of poets and authors James V (r. 1513–42) {{supported}} William Stewart and John Bellenden, who translated the Latin History of Scotland compiled in 1527 by Hector Boece, into verse and prose. David Lyndsay (c. 1486–1555), diplomat {{and the head}} of the Lyon Court, was a prolific poet. He wrote elegiac narratives, romances and satires. George Buchanan (1506–82) had a major influence as a Latin poet, founding a tradition of neo-Latin poetry that would continue <b>in</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> seventeenth century. Contributors to this tradition included royal secretary John Maitland (1537–95), reformer Andrew Melville (1545–1622), John Johnston (1570?–1611) and David Hume of Godscroft (1558–1629).|$|E
5|$|At 4:00pm, {{following}} {{a period of}} artillery preparation, the commandos launched their attack. Amidst thick mist and heavy rain, the attack went badly from the start. Shortly after stepping off, No. 5 Troop was ambushed by a German force disguised as locals, reducing its strength to just five men. The main assault force pressed on, although by now it consisted of only 67 men due to earlier losses. Part of the assault force—No. 6 Troop—took heavy fire and lost forward momentum; however, the other two troops gained {{the top of the}} hill and broke <b>in</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> German position. Upon reaching the summit they were greeted by an intense volume of heavy machine gun fire and at this point it became clear that the preparatory bombardment had not been successful. Calls for further artillery support were denied due to a shortage of ammunition amongst the field batteries and eventually after a number of unsuccessful attempts at taking the position the commandos were forced to retire.|$|E

Bond is reunited with Solitaire; the following morning Mr Big ties the couple to a line behind his yacht and plans to drag them over the shallow coral reef and into deeper water so that the sharks and barracuda that he attracts <b>in</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> area with regular feedings will eat them.|$|E

5|$|By 04:30 on 14July, the 1st Parachute Battalion was {{in control}} of Primosole Bridge, but the Fallschirmjäger Machine Gun Battalion were well dug <b>in</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south. Beyond them, 140 men of the 2nd Parachute Battalion had {{occupied}} the three small hills, and taken 500Italian prisoners. In numbers, both battalions had little more than company strength. The 3rd Parachute Battalion had suffered {{the worst in the}} scattered parachute drop, and only a few of their men had arrived at the bridge. With no command structure, they were attached to the 1st Parachute Battalion to help defend the bridge. To the north, the Italian 372nd Coastal Battalion and the 10th Arditi Regiment had been informed of the parachute landings. Many of the 372nd Battalion had disappeared, while the Arditi mounted the first of a number of attacks on the British positions. Without the support of any heavy weapons, they were easily fought off.|$|E
5|$|Cisneros called Saavedra and Martín Rodríguez, and {{requested}} their military {{support in the}} case of a popular rebellion. They refused to give such support, and Saavedra argued that Cisneros should resign because the Junta of Seville that had appointed him did not exist anymore. As a result, Cisneros gave <b>in</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> request of Juan José Castelli: to celebrate an open cabildo, an extraordinary meeting of the noteworthy peoples of the city, and discuss the situation. The next day an armed mob, led by Antonio Beruti and Domingo French, occupied the Plaza to demand the making of the open cabildo, doubting that Cisneros would actually allow it. Saavedra addressed the crowd and assured them that the Regiment of Patricians supported their claims.|$|E
5|$|Contador faced {{repeated}} {{challenges from}} Riccardo Riccò and Danilo Di Luca in the race's final week. They {{were separated by}} {{less than a minute}} after stage 15, and though Di Luca would falter slightly in the Giro's second individual time trial, the time gap among the three of them was just 21 seconds heading <b>in</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Giro's final mountain stage. Di Luca faltered further in that last mountain stage, losing almost five minutes and any chance to repeat as Giro champion, but Contador and Riccò finished together and were separated by only four seconds going into the Giro's final stage, another individual time trial. Contador's superior time trial skills provided the difference in the Giro's finale. Though he finished 11th on the stage, he gained almost two minutes over Riccò, winning the Giro overall without taking any individual stage.|$|E

5|$|During the Ottoman rule of Greece, impalement {{became an}} {{important}} tool of psychological warfare, intended to put terror into the peasant population.

Victims were publicly impaled and placed at highly visible points, and had the intended effect on many villages who not only refused to help the klephts, but would even turn them <b>in</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> authorities.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: 					 <b>The</b> aim was <b>to</b> {{evaluate}} <b>the</b> {{effectiveness of}} traditional preoperative planning {{with the use}} of templating. 				 				 					METHOD: 					 Forty-three anteroposterior X-rays were analyzed by three experienced surgeons (A, B, C) and compared. Cohen's Kappa concordance test and weighted Kappa indexes using quadratic weighting were used for statistical analysis with a confidence interval of 95 %. 				 				 					RESULTS: 					 The preoperative evaluations were divided into the analysis of the sizes of the acetabular cup, stem and plug of the distal femoral canal. Surgeon A obtained a moderate agreement <b>in</b> relation <b>to</b> <b>the</b> acetabular component and substantial agreements <b>in</b> relation <b>to</b> <b>the</b> stem and plug. Surgeon B had moderate agreement <b>in</b> relation <b>to</b> both <b>the</b> acetabulum and the stem and substantial agreement <b>in</b> relation <b>to</b> <b>the</b> plug.

CONCLUSION: 					 Templating used in preoperative planning proved effective; however, there was a prevalence of slight and moderate agreement <b>in</b> relation <b>to</b> <b>the</b> size of the acetabular component...|$|R

In July 2016, fewer than 130 stores remained open and administrators were brought <b>in</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> head office to identify restructuring options ahead of a potential sale of the business, although the move did not extend to franchisee-operated outlets. In November 2016, Pizza Hut announced to media that it had merged with Eagle Boys.

Giacomo Antonio Morigia was acceptable to the secular rulers, but was opposed by the zelanti for lacking governing experience in addition to not being firm or having the energy required.
