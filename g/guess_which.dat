5|$|Series 6 {{also saw}} the {{computer}} game Grabbit Rabbit replaced with Kwakatak' - a game' which involved viewers having to guide 'Derek the Duck' around a pond picking up pieces of bread before a goldfish character could get to it first. Mr Blobby's new game became Blob A Job which saw him as a handyman and viewers having to <b>guess</b> <b>which</b> celebrity's house he would be redecorating later on that afternoon.|$|E
5|$|The {{computer}} game for this series became Grabbit Rabbit which involved guiding 'Warren the Rabbit' down a course collecting carrots whilst dodging obstacles such as fences and bushes. Ball later {{said in an}} interview that Blake Harrison of The Inbetweeners had told her that he had once been a player on Grabbit Rabbit when he was younger. Blobby's game also now became known as Blobby's Office Trolley which saw him as a postman for the BBC with viewers having to <b>guess</b> <b>which</b> celebrity a letter was for.|$|E
5|$|Until the film's production, many {{special effects}} in the film {{industry}} were achieved using miniature models, matte paintings, and on-set visual effectsalthough other films had made extensive use of CGI. Knoll previewed 3,500 storyboards for the film; Lucas accompanied him to explain factors of the shots that would be practical and those which would be created through visual effects. Knoll later said that on hearing the explanations of the storyboards, {{he did not know}} how to accomplish what he had seen. The result was a mixture of original techniques and the newest digital techniques to make it difficult for the viewer to <b>guess</b> <b>which</b> technique was being used. Knoll and his visual effects team wrote new computer software, including cloth simulators to allow a realistic depiction of the digital characters' clothing, to create certain shots. Another goal was to create computer-generated characters that could act seamlessly with live-action actors. While filming scenes with CGI characters, Lucas would block the characters using their corresponding voice actors on-set. The voice actors were then removed and the live-action actors would perform the same scene alone. A CGI character would later be added into the shot to complete the conversation. Lucas also used CGI to correct the physical presence of actors in certain scenes. Practical models were used when their visuals helped with miniature sceneries for backgrounds, set extensions, and model vehicles that would be scanned to create the digital models or filmed to represent spaceships and podraces.|$|E
50|$|Other systems {{attempt to}} reduce latency by <b>guessing</b> <b>which</b> pages not in RAM {{are likely to be}} needed soon, and {{pre-loading}} such pages into RAM, before that page is requested. (This is often in combination with pre-cleaning, <b>which</b> <b>guesses</b> <b>which</b> pages currently in RAM {{are not likely to be}} needed soon, and pre-writing them out to storage).|$|R

25|$|Yet {{as he did}} so, the front-running pair of Rubens Barrichello's Jordan and Nigel Mansell's Williams came up to lap him. Noda was a touch {{too slow}} in {{getting out of the}} way, and both Barrichello and Mansell had to <b>guess</b> <b>which</b> side to pass. Rubens pulled to the right and safely {{negotiated}} his way around the Larrousse, but all Nigel could do was lock his brakes and ram the back of the Japanese driver.|$|E
25|$|The idea of {{the method}} is as follows: one starts with an initial <b>guess</b> <b>which</b> is {{reasonably}} close to the true root, then the function is approximated by its tangent line (which can be computed using the tools of calculus), and one computes the -intercept of this tangent line (which is easily done with elementary algebra). This -intercept will typically be a better approximation to the function's root than the original guess, and the method can be iterated.|$|E
50|$|It is {{performed}} by improvisation: the tester seeks to find bugs {{by any means}} that seem appropriate. Ad hoc testing {{can be seen as}} a light version of error <b>guessing,</b> <b>which</b> itself is a light version of exploratory testing.|$|R

25|$|Each round has a {{different}} Category: Memory and Strategy, Speed and Agility, and Trivia and Knowledge. In the Memory and Strategy rounds, players {{have to focus on}} cards before they flip and guess how many objects there were after the cards flip, or memorize what were used or happened in Disney Movies. In the Speed and Agility rounds, Players have to <b>guess</b> <b>which</b> object is odd after it is done spinning, or answers other questions quickly. And in the Trivia and Knowledge rounds, players have to guess trivia questions about Disney movies.|$|E
25|$|In general, {{the range}} of {{possibilities}} is first narrowed down (often by entering the desired character's pronunciation). Then, if there remains more than one possibility, the desired ideogram is selected, either by typing the number before the character, or using a graphical menu to select it. The computer assists the typist by using heuristics to <b>guess</b> <b>which</b> character is most likely desired. Although this may seem painstaking, East Asian input methods are today sufficient in that, even for beginners, typing in these languages is only slightly slower than typing English.|$|E
25|$|As a rule {{it is not}} {{difficult}} to <b>guess</b> <b>which</b> eyes are which in a living or preserved specimen, but sometimes it can be. Apart from the fact that in some species one or more pairs may be missing, sometimes eyes from the posterior and anterior rows may be very close to each other, or even fused. Also, either one row or both might be so grossly curved that some of the notionally anterior eyes actually may lie posterior to some of the eyes in the posterior row. In some species the curve is so gross that the eyes apparently are arranged into two anteroposterior parallel rows of eyes.|$|E
50|$|What is {{happening}} is essentially a race between the errors that result from wrong <b>guesses,</b> <b>which</b> double with every shift left, and the corrections made by adding or subtracting multiples of r based on a guess of what the errors may be.|$|R
50|$|Confidence-Based Learning, CBL, {{measures}} the correctness of a learner's knowledge {{and confidence in}} that knowledge. It is designed to increase retention and minimize the effects of <b>guessing,</b> <b>which</b> can skew the results of traditional single-score assessments. It distinguishes between what individuals think and actually know.|$|R
50|$|Codenames has an espionage setting, {{in which}} players in teams try to {{identify}} their own team's secret agents, based on their agents' code names. Codenames is a game of <b>guessing</b> <b>which</b> code names (words) in a set are related to a hint-word given by another player.|$|R
25|$|Effective {{blinding}} can {{be difficult}} to achieve where the treatment is notably effective (indeed, studies have been suspended in cases where the tested drug combinations were so effective that it was deemed unethical to continue withholding the findings from the control group, and the general population), or where the treatment is very distinctive in taste or has unusual side-effects that allow the researcher and/or the subject to <b>guess</b> <b>which</b> group they were assigned to. It is also difficult to use the double blind method to compare surgical and non-surgical interventions (although sham surgery, involving a simple incision, might be ethically permitted). A good clinical protocol will foresee these potential problems to ensure blinding is as effective as possible. It has also been argued that even in a double-blind experiment, general attitudes of the experimenter such as skepticism or enthusiasm towards the tested procedure can be subconsciously transferred to the test subjects.|$|E
25|$|When Ambrosio was 12 years old, she partook in {{modeling}} classes, {{and then}} began modeling for Dilson Stein at age 15. Competing in Brazil's Elite Model Look competition started her modeling career in earnest. Her first notable modeling job was shooting the cover of Brazilian Elle magazine. Elite passed along some of her Polaroids to <b>Guess</b> <b>which</b> led her booking the Millennium GUESS? campaign. She has since appeared in advertising campaigns for Gucci, Dolce & Gabbana, Calvin Klein, Oscar de la Renta, Christian Dior, Escada, Fendi, Giorgio Armani, Guess, Emporio Armani, Moschino, Gap, Hugo Boss, Ralph Lauren, Saks Fifth Avenue, Macy's, Revlon, and the Pirelli Calendar. She has walked the catwalks for designers such as Prada, Chanel, Dolce & Gabbana, Givenchy, Christian Lacroix, Bottega Veneta, Escada, Tommy Hilfiger, Christian Dior, Marc Jacobs, Louis Vuitton, Balmain, Ralph Lauren, Halston, Vivienne Westwood, Giles Deacon, and Oscar de la Renta. She has appeared in numerous international magazine covers, including Cosmopolitan, Elle, GQ, Harper's Bazaar, Marie Claire, Ocean Drive, Vogue and was the only model {{to appear on the}} cover of Glamour in the United States in 2006.|$|E
25|$|The {{simplest}} type {{of possible}} attack is the intercept-resend attack, where Eve measures the quantum states (photons) sent by Alice and then sends replacement states to Bob, prepared {{in the state}} she measures. In the BB84 protocol, this produces errors in the key Alice and Bob share. As Eve has {{no knowledge of the}} basis a state sent by Alice is encoded in, she can only <b>guess</b> <b>which</b> basis to measure in, {{in the same way as}} Bob. If she chooses correctly, she measures the correct photon polarization state as sent by Alice, and resends the correct state to Bob. However, if she chooses incorrectly, the state she measures is random, and the state sent to Bob cannot be the same as the state sent by Alice. If Bob then measures this state in the same basis Alice sent, he too gets a random resultas Eve has sent him a state in the opposite basis—with a 50% chance of an erroneous result (instead of the correct result he would get without the presence of Eve). The table below shows an example of this type of attack.|$|E

50|$|During {{the first}} season, the Snack Break {{occurred}} {{in the middle of}} the round, and the contestant in the lead at that point had the chance to win a small prize by correctly <b>guessing</b> <b>which</b> of three numbered refrigerators it was located in (similar to Let's Make a Deal). The other two each held a revolting food item.|$|R
500|$|Justin Haywald of 1UP.com {{stated that}} [...] "even when I felt I had to <b>guess</b> <b>which</b> {{direction}} I {{was supposed to}} go, the levels are set up well enough that the way forward is always easy to figure out". Haywald praised the visuals as well, but stated that [...] "as the scenery grows more cluttered, it also sometimes becomes {{difficult to find a}} safe place to land after sending the world spinning". Haywald rated And Yet It Moves a B+. NintendoLife rated the WiiWare version 9 out of 10, stating that the new additions and updated controls made it the [...] "definitive version of the game" [...] despite the omission of online features seen in the PC version.|$|E
500|$|Rowling {{particularly}} dislikes the British tabloid the Daily Mail, {{which has}} conducted interviews with her estranged ex-husband. As one journalist noted, [...] "Harry's Uncle Vernon is a grotesque philistine of violent tendencies and remarkably little brain. It {{is not difficult}} to <b>guess</b> <b>which</b> newspaper Rowling gives him to read [...]" [...] , she was seeking damages from the Mail for libel over an article about her time as a single mother. Some have speculated that Rowling's fraught relationship with the press was the inspiration behind the character Rita Skeeter, a gossipy celebrity journalist who first appears in Goblet of Fire, but Rowling noted in 2000 that the character predates her rise to fame.|$|E
500|$|Damage to the {{hippocampus}} {{does not affect}} some types of memory, {{such as the ability}} to learn new skills (playing a musical instrument or solving certain types of puzzles, for example). [...] This fact suggests that such abilities depend on different types of memory (procedural memory) and different brain regions. Furthermore, amnesic patients frequently show [...] "implicit" [...] memory for experiences {{even in the absence of}} conscious knowledge. For example, patients asked to <b>guess</b> <b>which</b> of two faces they have seen most recently may give the correct answer most of the time in spite of stating that they have never seen either of the faces before. Some researchers distinguish between conscious recollection, which depends on {{the hippocampus}}, and familiarity, which depends on portions of the medial temporal lobe.|$|E
50|$|The first round, Deal Breakers, {{sees the}} teams trying to predict whether the {{audience}} considered something acceptable or unacceptable, {{such as whether}} a wacky marriage proposal was a deal-breaker or not; in the fourth episode, the team <b>guessed</b> <b>which</b> {{one of the three}} members of the opposing team were responsible for a quote in a round called First Impressions.|$|R
6000|$|Babbitt spoke well--and often--at these orgies of {{commercial}} righteousness about the [...] "realtor's {{function as a}} seer of the future development of the community, and as a prophetic engineer clearing the pathway for inevitable changes"--which meant that a real-estate broker could make money by <b>guessing</b> <b>which</b> way the town would grow.

500|$|Finally, Vice President of East Coast Television and Microwave Oven Programming for General Electric Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) and NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) are {{participating}} in [...] "Bottoms Up" [...] day at the office. Jack must work in Kenneth's job for a day, to help him be a better manager. During their time together, Kenneth tells Jack about an idea he has for a game show called Gold Case, in which contestants must correctly <b>guess</b> <b>which</b> briefcase being modeled contains gold bricks. Jack helps him sell the idea to NBC. The pilot episode of Gold Case is in production, with host John McEnroe. Due to {{the weight of the}} gold, contestants can quickly spot which model is straining with the weight of the case. Every contestant wins almost immediately which results in the show being shut down.|$|E
500|$|The Maniac Mansion team {{wanted to}} retain the {{structure}} of a text-based adventure game, but without the standard command-line interface. Gilbert and Winnick were frustrated by the genre's text parsers and frequent game over screens. While in college, Gilbert had enjoyed Colossal Cave Adventure and the games of Infocom, but he disliked their lack of visuals. He found the inclusion of graphics in Sierra On-Line games, such as King's Quest, to be {{a step in the right}} direction. However, these games still require the player to type, and to <b>guess</b> <b>which</b> commands must be input. In response, Gilbert programmed a point-and-click graphical user interface that displays every possible command. Fox had made a similar attempt to streamline Lucasfilm's earlier [...] and he conceived the entirety of Maniac Mansions interface, according to Gilbert. Forty input commands were planned at first, but the number was gradually reduced to 12. Gilbert finished the Maniac Mansion engine—which he later named [...] "Script Creation Utility for Maniac Mansion" [...] (SCUMM)—after roughly one year of work. Although the game was designed for the Commodore 64, the SCUMM engine allowed it to be ported easily to other platforms.|$|E
500|$|... "You Must Love Me" [...] {{was written}} by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice, who had reunited for Evita after a ten-year {{creative}} separation due to their individual projects. It was written specifically for the film, {{so that it would}} contain new material and be eligible for an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Song. Madonna noted it as her favorite song from the film, recalling that the idea for [...] "You Must Love Me" [...] grew when Parker re-arranged the ending of the film from the original play, with the hopes of reuniting Rice and Webber to create new music. According to Webber, the purpose of the song was to showcase Perón's emotional state at the time as well as her relationship with her husband Juan Perón; [...] " [...] is dying and she knows she's dying. One reason she is saying, 'You must love me', is out of desperation. She's also saying, 'You must love me because you must have always loved me', so it's a little word play, I <b>guess,</b> <b>which</b> Tim Rice has written", he explained. It was released as the soundtrack's first official single on October 27, 1996. Since its release, the song has been included in several productions of the play, including the 2006 London production and the 2012 Broadway revival.|$|E
50|$|There are 26 players, each {{holding a}} case. The one {{who wins the}} quiz round can play the game and win up to 1,000,000 rand (about US$122,000) or down to 1 cent (about 0.12¢).
