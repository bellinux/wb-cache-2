She is a skilled sword-fighter, but is followed by the dead spirits of baby chicks, who believe her to be their mother, and rest on her, thus interfering in her sword-training.

5|$|Forensics teams {{analyzed}} the DNA of Deer Island Jane to exclude some missing persons and {{in hopes of}} matching it to possible relatives of the <b>girl</b> <b>whose</b> DNA was on record. It was obtained through samples of hair and a tooth. The DNA did not match the profiles stored in databases of known missing persons. Officials stated that they also sent samples to the University of North Texas {{to create a more}} specific profile, a time-consuming process. Mitochondrial DNA from the bones of the child was later developed to compare to possible relatives.|$|E

50|$|Studies {{have also}} found that <b>girls</b> <b>whose</b> fathers left the family early in their lives had {{the highest rates of}} early sexual {{activity}} and adolescent pregnancy. <b>Girls</b> <b>whose</b> fathers left them at a later age had a lower rate of early sexual activity, and the lowest rates are found in <b>girls</b> <b>whose</b> fathers were present throughout their childhood. Even when the researchers took into account other factors that could have contributed to early sexual activity and pregnancy, such as behavioral problems and life adversity, early father-absent girls were still about five times more likely in the United States and three times more likely in New Zealand to become pregnant as adolescents than were father-present girls.|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{positive}} {{association between}} parental socio-economic position (PSEP) and health among adolescents may be partly explained by physical activity behaviour. We investigated the associations between physical activity, aerobic fitness and PSEP {{in a population}} based sample of German adolescents. Methods: 5, 251 participants, aged 11 – 17 years, in the German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents 2003 – 2006 (KiGGS) underwent a sub-maximal cycle ergometer test and completed a questionnaire obtaining information on physical activity and media use. The associations between physical activity, media use, aerobic fitness and PSEP were analysed with multivariate logistic regression models {{for boys and girls}} separately. Odds ratios (ORs) of PSEP (education, occupation and income) on the outcomes were calculated adjusted for age, region, and other influencing factors. Results: Parental education was more strongly associated with the outcome variables than parental occupation and income. After adjusting for age and region, a higher parental education level was associated with better aerobic fitness – with an OR of 1. 5 (95 % CI 1. 2 - 1. 9) for <b>girls</b> <b>whose</b> parents had secondary education and 1. 9 (1. 4 - 2. 5) for <b>girls</b> <b>whose</b> parents had tertiary education compared to <b>girls</b> <b>whose</b> parents had primary education. The corresponding ORs for boys were 1. 3 (1. 0 - 1. 6) and 1. 6 (1. 2 - 2. 1), respectively. Higher parental education level was associated with lower media use: an OR of 2. 1 (1. 5 - 3. 0) for <b>girls</b> <b>whose</b> parents had secondary education and 2. 7 (1. 8 - 4. 1) for <b>girls</b> <b>whose</b> parents had primary education compared to <b>girls</b> <b>whose</b> parents had tertiary education. The corresponding ORs for boys were 1. 5 (1. 2 - 1. 9) and 1. 9 (1. 5 - 2. 5), respectively. Higher parental education level was associated with a higher physical activity level only among girls: an OR of 1. 3 (1. 0 - 1. 6) for <b>girls</b> <b>whose</b> parents had secondary education and 1. 2 (0. 9 - 1. 5) for <b>girls</b> <b>whose</b> parents had tertiary education compared to <b>girls</b> <b>whose</b> parents had primary education. The corresponding ORs for boys were 0. 9 (0. 8 - 1. 2) and 0. 8 (0. 6 - 1. 0), respectively. Conclusions: Adolescents of parents with low SEP showed a lower level of aerobic fitness and higher levels of media use than adolescents of parents with higher SEP. Health-promotion interventions need to reach adolescents of parents with low PSEP and stimulate physical activity...|$|R
5|$|Michelle Cedillo v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, {{also known}} as the omnibus autism {{proceeding}} (OAP), was a court case involving the family of Michelle Cedillo, an autistic <b>girl</b> <b>whose</b> parents sued the United States government because they believed that her autism was caused by her receipt of both the measles-mumps-and-rubella vaccine ({{also known as}} the MMR vaccine) and thimerosal-containing vaccines. The omnibus proceeding required the petitioners to present three test cases for each proposed mechanism by which vaccines had, according to them, caused their children's autism; Michelle was the first such case for the MMR-and-thimerosal hypothesis.|$|E

On the outward journey, Tony engages in a shipboard romance with Thérèse de Vitré, a young <b>girl</b> <b>whose</b> Roman Catholicism causes her to shun him when he tells her he has a wife.

5|$|Saori, nicknamed , is a {{girl who}} is a fifth grader in Shuichi's class at the {{beginning}} of Wandering Son. She takes an interest in encouraging Shuichi to cross-dress, even {{going so far as to}} buy Shuichi an expensive dress for Shuichi's birthday, which Shuichi later returns, much to her displeasure. Saori finds it difficult to associate with others; she has few friends, though becomes close to Shuichi. She tends to convey what is on her mind and disregards how others may take what she says. As Saori grows up, she gradually becomes more standoffish and stoic; she even has bad relations with her teachers. Despite her self-centered attitude, she remains popular among her male classmates due to her physical attractiveness. She is a sensitive <b>girl</b> <b>whose</b> temper sometimes gets the better of her when reprimanding bullies that tease Shuichi, because of Shuichi's femininity and cross-dressing. Saori is often emotionally affected by circumstances involving Shuichi, because of her feelings for Shuichi. Saori converts to Christianity partly because of this influence to seek forgiveness for her previous actions, though she only attends mass when feeling guilty about her behavior.|$|E

25|$|This festival had {{a legendary}} {{aetiology}} {{in a particularly}} delicate episode of Roman history and also recurs at (or shortly after) a particular time of the year, that of the so-called caprificatio when branches of wild fig trees were fastened to cultivated ones to promote insemination. The historical episode narrated by ancient sources concerns the siege of Rome by the Latin peoples that ensued the Gallic sack. The dictator of the Latins Livius Postumius from Fidenae would have requested the Roman senate that the matronae and daughters {{of the most prominent}} families be surrendered to the Latins as hostages. While the senate was debating the issue a slave <b>girl,</b> <b>whose</b> Greek name was Philotis and Latin Tutela or Tutula proposed that she together with other slave girls would render herself up to the enemy camp pretending to be the wives and daughters of the Roman families. Upon agreement of the senate, the women dressed up elegantly and wearing golden jewellery reached the Latin camp. There they seduced the Latins into fooling and drinking: after they had fallen asleep they stole their swords. Then Tutela gave the convened signal to the Romans brandishing an ignited branch after climbing on the wild fig (caprificus) and hiding the fire with her mantle. The Romans then irrupted into the Latin camp killing the enemies in their sleep. The women were rewarded with freedom and a dowry at public expenses.|$|E
