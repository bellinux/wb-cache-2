40|$|Polymersomes are the {{synthetic}} analogues to liposomes and {{a relatively new}} kind of soft nanoparticles, which have already shown great promise as drug carriers. They are composed of amphiphilic block copolymers instead of phospholipids like their natural counterparts. Due to the good synthetic control of polymer chemistry, polymersomes provide much more variability, stability and functionality than liposomes. The formation of polymersomes by controlled self-assembly can be induced by transferring the block copolymer in a selective solvent, for example water. In this case hydrophobic parts will associate {{in order to prevent}} the unfavorable contact with water, while the hydrophilic blocks will face the inner and outer solution. Due to this association, polymersomes have the capability to load hydrophilic molecules as well as hydrophobic ones, which offers advantages over spherical polymer micelles. Nevertheless, the preparation and loading of polymer nanostructures is a challenging task since it must be a highly controllable and continuous process. At the beginning of this video we will show you two different batch methods for the formation of vesicles and their limitations which were adapted from the liposome preparation techniques. Compared to this, the next presentation of a continuous process for the production and in-situ loading of polymersomes illustrates the outstanding advantages of micro technology for nano engineering. Before Prof. Dr. Michael Maskos, <b>graduate</b> <b>chemist,</b> was appointed to head the Fraunhofer ICT-IMM as director in 2014, he had been working as CEO of the Institut für Mikrotechnik Mainz GmbH (IMM) for 3 years, before it was integrated into the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft in 2014. In 2000 he was awarded the Research Award of the Boehringer-Ingelheim Foundation. Afterwards he left Mainz for a year abroad within a research scholarship of the German Academy of Natural Scientists Leopoldina to work at the McGill University in Montreal, Canada. Back in Germany Maskos habilitated 2003 in physical chemistry. Afterwards he moved to Berlin where he took the lead of the Division Durability of Polymers at the Federal Institute of Materials Research and Testing (BAM). During this period he also graduated from the Helmholtz-Academy of Young Researchers in Scientific Management. Two years later he was appointed as a W 3 -professor at the Johannes Gutenberg-University in the field of Chemical Process Engineering and Microfluidics, and also became CEO of the IMM. In 2015 Maskos won the Literature Prize of the Chemical Industry for the textbook “Polymers: Synthesis, Characteristics and Applications”. Dr. Regina Bleul graduated with her PhD on the topic of the formation, characterization and functionalization of polymeric nanoparticles and their interactions with biological systems from the FU Berlin in 2014. Since then she has been working as a junior scientist in the area of nanopharmaceuticals at the Fraunhofer ICT-IMM. Sibylle von Bomhard is a PhD student in the group of Michael Maskos. Her focus is on the process development for the continuous formation of polymer based nanoparticles including downstream processing. Dr. Raphael Thiermann received his PhD on the subject of self-organisation of amphiphilic block copolymer in micromixers in 2014. Afterwards he moved to the Fraunhofer ICT-IMM where his research is focused on the manufacturing and characterization of nanoparticles.

40|$|T. R. Crompton has {{accomplished}} a significant task, summarizing the literature (up to 1998) for {{the determination of}} organic and inorganic compounds {{in a variety of}} water substrates (surface/natural water, treated water, and waste water). Overall, the book is relatively easy to read; the manuscript produced by the author contains clear tables, figures, and font. The first chapter presents a brief overview of the techniques presented in the book. The author assumes that the reader has a general understanding of chromatography and the basic components of a chromatographic system. The remainder of the book is organized into chapters by chromatographic technique. Each of these subsequent chapters is organized by the variety of compounds that have been successfully analyzed by each technique. In this way, a reader can search for information by either analyte or analytical technique. The chromatographic techniques include widely used techniques such as gas chromatography, high-performance liquid chromatography (both with a variety of detectors including mass spectrometry), thin-layer chromatography, ion-pair chromatography, capillary electrophoresis, and ion exchange chromatography. Less common techniques are also presented: micelle chromatography, electrostatic ion chromatography, ion exclusion chromatography and gel permeation chromatography. Classes of compounds addressed in this text include a wide variety of naturally occurring as well as anthropogenic compounds such as metals, organometals, carboxylates, insecticides, herbicides, fungicides, fertilizers, petroleumrelated compounds, detergents, plasticizers, and disinfectants. In these chapters, the author briefly summarizes the scientific literature with respect to the analytical techniques covered in chapter one. Although details are generally insufficient to permit readers to duplicate reported analyses, a truly impressive number of cited references are listed {{at the end of each}} chapter. The book concludes with a comprehensive subject index. This book provides a good initial reference for a variety of <b>graduate</b> students, scientists (<b>chemists,</b> biologists, soil scientists, toxicologists, environmental scientists, etc.), managers, and public health professionals who may be faced with evaluating and/or developing an analytical approach for the analysis of organic and/or inorganic compounds in a water-based matrix. As most scientists work with finite resources, this book would be valuable to researchers who wish to apply their existing technology to new analytical challenges. This text would also be valuable to professionals reviewing data submissions, proposals, and/or grant applications. Most chapters, after a brief introduction, offer a straightforward review of the literature by compound class. Many chapters contain valuable tables that compare the suitability of the analytical technique being discussed for a variety of compounds. Inclusion of detection limits and references further increase the value of these tables. For future editions of this text, additional information that would be helpful to the reader might include relative cost, sample throughput, and reproducibility...|$|R
40|$|T. R. Crompton has {{accomplished}} the Herculean task of summarizing the literature (up to 1998) for {{the determination of}} organic and organometallic substances in soils, aquatic, and marine sediments and sludge. Although previous books address the analysis of such compounds in water, {{this is the first}} book dedicated to the analysis of pollutants in soils, sediments, and sludges, matrices that typically contain a variety of interfering compounds and offer significant analytical challenges. Overall, the book is relatively easy to read; the “camera ready” manuscript produced by the author contains clear tables, figures, and font. Classes of compounds addressed in this text include a wide variety of mostly anthropogenic compounds such as insecticides, herbicides, fungicides, fertilizers, petroleum-related compounds, detergents, as well as humic/fulvic acids. The initial chapter provides an overview of the types of analytical instrumentation that is commonly used to analyze organic compounds in soils, sediments, and sludge. Each of the next 12 chapters is dedicated to the analysis of a class of compounds. Chapter topics include hydrocarbons, surface active agents, oxygen-containing compounds, halogen-containing compounds, nitrogen-containing compounds, phosphorous-containing compounds, sulfur-containing compounds, pesticides (insecticides, growth regulators, fungicides), mixtures of organic compounds, metalloids, organometallic compounds, and finally miscellaneous organics. In these chapters, the author briefly summarizes the scientific literature with respect to the analytical techniques covered in Chapter One. Although details are generally insufficient to permit readers to duplicate reported analyses, cited references are listed {{at the end of each}} chapter. Chapter Fourteen emphasizes the importance of sampling procedures and provides a good overview of sample homogenization, and destructive and nondestructive sampling approaches. The final two chapters discuss accumulation processes in sediments, and the disposal of wastes to land. These chapters provide an excellent justification for the importance of the material presented in this book, and would perhaps serve the reader better had they constituted the initial book chapters. The book concludes with an appendix of instrument suppliers, an extremely brief listing of the United Kingdom Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Foods Methods for soil analysis, and a subject index. This book provides a good initial reference for a variety of <b>graduate</b> students, scientists (<b>chemists,</b> biologists, soil scientists, toxicologists, environmental scientists, etc.), managers, data/grant reviewers, and public health professionals who may be faced with reviewing data and/or developing an analytical approach for the analysis of organic compounds in difficult matrices such as soils, sediments and sludges. Mostly, however, this book simply reviews the literature. The author injects very little analysis to the literature summary. For example, there is no mention of the fact that analysis by thin-layer chromatography is generally qualitative (nonquantitative) compared to analysis by gas chromatography (GC) or high performance liquid chromatography. For the analysis of halogen-containing compounds (such as organochlorine insecticides), there is no mention of the selectivity afforded by GC–electron capture detection. I believe a large number of readers would benefit greatly from a discussion section at the end of each chapter. This discussion might include a table that compares the variety of detection methods with respect to limits of detection, cost, sample throughput, and reproducibility. Because many chapters contain mostly references that are more than 20 years old (i. e., citations pertaining to the use of packed GC columns), the discussion section could help the reader determine the advantages of one technique over another and which techniques are commonly used today versus those which are antiquated. Perhaps this would be easier if individual chapters were written by pertinent experts or at least if there were multiple editors rather than having one author compile and edit the entire book. Additionally, a brief summary of the author’s experience/expertise would possibly contribute credibility to this book. Another small addition that would increase the value of the book would be the inclusion of the article titles in the cited references. This would make it easier for readers to determine the value of citations prior to obtaining the article...|$|R
