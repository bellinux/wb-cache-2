40|$|Nutrient {{composition}} and sensory investigation of butter biscuits incorporated with {{various levels of}} grey oyster mushroom (Pleurotus sajor-caju, PSC) powder were studied. The biscuits were formulated with 0, 2, 4 or 6 % of PSC powder to partially replace wheat flour. Our results showed that butter biscuit formulated with 6 % PSC powder significantly (p≤ 0. 05) recorded the highest protein content (6. 94 %) as compared with control (6. 50 %). Meanwhile, the addition of 2 % PSC powder in biscuit {{does not affect the}} fat content (20. 71 %) compared with control (20. 52 %). Both biscuits containing 4 % and 6 % PSC powder recorded 5. 34 g/ 100 g and 5. 52 g/ 100 g total dietary fibre (TDF), respectively and significantly higher (p≤ 0. 05) than control biscuit (4. 84 g/ 100 g). Biscuits formulated with 4 % and 6 % PSC powder had significantly higher β-glucan concentration at 0. 72 and 0. 79 g/ 100 g than control biscuit (0. 66 g/ 100 g). In the sensory evaluation, biscuits incorporated with 2 % PSC powder had the highest scores for all sensory attributes except for crispiness and flavor. Butter biscuit containing 4 % PSC powder had score values of 5. 5 and 4. 5 for crispiness and flavor, respectively. The present study suggested that incorporation of PSC powder up to 4 % to replace wheat flour improved crispiness and flavour, increased concentration of protein, dietary fibre and β-glucan but did not affect the <b>fat</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>butter</b> biscuit...|$|E
40|$|Observations made <b>of</b> {{traditional}} <b>butter</b> making by smallholders {{have clearly}} indicated that churning efficiency was considerably improved {{by using the}} agitator. This internal agitator has passed through several phases of Development over the years. Details on the design and construction of the agitator are given further on in the article. Consequently, efficient butter making can be measured by {{the length of time}} it takes to churn the milk and, more importantly, by the amount of fat remaining in the butter milk or the amount of fat extracted from the milk. The results of the trials clearly indicated that at a churning temperature of 18 degree C, the average <b>fat</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> the <b>butter</b> milk was about 1. 4 percent using the traditional method compared with 0. 3 percent using the agitator. The average percentage of fat recovered was about 60 percent, compared with 76 percent when using the agitator. The length of time required for churning was 65 minutes for the agitator method...|$|R

In every other case the rats fed margarine showed a final loss in weight and most of them did not survive the experiment. Butter was fed at a daily rate equal to one-tenth or one-twentieth of the quantity of margarine fed in all cases but one, and the rats survived and gained, the smallest gain averaging 45 grams and the largest 111 grams during the eight-weeks period...|$|R

The biggest difference was obtained for oleic acid and elaidic acid since, {{with the exception}} of the margarine, in each case proportion of the cis-configurated oleic acid decreased while that of the trans-configurated elaidic acid increased. For all of the other fatty acids in the foodstuffs examined no such differences were obtained regarding change in fatty acid composition whose differences could influence healthy nutrition to considerable extent. Therefore we can take it as a fact that neither heat treatment performed on a traditional cooking plate nor microwave treatment affects considerably the composition of food fats...|$|R
40|$|Summary: <b>Butter</b> is one <b>of</b> {{the most}} popular dairy {{products}} that have been transformed from a cottage industry to successful large scale productions. In western countries, consumption <b>of</b> <b>butter</b> has slowly overtaken margarine as {{the most popular}} spread. Different kinds <b>of</b> <b>butter</b> are now available on the markets, of which sweet cream butter and salted butter constitute significant proportions. The popularity <b>of</b> cultured cream <b>butter</b> is mainly attributed to its unique flavour and nutritional properties. Butter contains large amounts of β-carotene (provitamin A carotenoid) and is characterised by the buttery flavour due {{to the presence of}} diacetyl as well as other organic aroma compounds. Although butter has been produced successfully in large scale commercial processing, small scale productions still exists in small communities and for use in specialised products. New Zealand, like in many other western countries, is dominated by small to medium scale food processing enterprises which produce speciality foods for discerning markets. The domestic market in New Zealand enjoys a variety of dairy products which includes cultured butter. Some small food processing enterprises in outlying areas of New Zealand produce their own cultured butter to cater for the local businesses and their inhabitants. Thus, the main objective of this project was to standardise small scale production <b>of</b> cultured <b>butter</b> using kitchen/domestic scale equipment. Fresh cream (40 % fat) used to produce cultured butter was fermented by a mixed lactic starter culture (Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis biovar. diacetylactis and Leuconostoc cremoris) following a modified standard method. The cream was pasteurised at 95 °C/ 5 min, rapidly cooled to 8 °C, and then starter culture (2 %) was added. The cream was held at 8 °C/ 2 h to initiate the formation of low melting point fat crystals. The temperature of the cream was then increased to 20 - 21 °C, and held at this temperature for further 2 h to melt fat crystals with high melting point and recrystallise the crystals. The temperature was then decreased to 16 °C/ 2 h to form pure fat crystals. This was then followed by slightly decreasing the temperature to 15 °C for butter churning in a K 5 SS KitchenAid Heavy Duty (USA) churning mixer. Buttermilk (100 mL) was collected and stored at 4 ºC for analysis and the remained buttermilk in the butter churn was drained. The butter grains were washed with distilled water to remove any residual buttermilk. Final cultured butter (product) was packed in heavy duty aluminium foil and stored at 4 ºC for 21 days. Cultured butter was produced on three different occasions commencing in August 2014 (batch 1), September 2014 (batch 2), and October 2014 (batch 3). Various analyses and measurements were conducted during processing and storage to monitor the shelf life stability <b>of</b> the <b>butter.</b> Standard methods were used to measure chemical, physical, consumer sensory acceptance of the products and presence of coliforms were enumerated by Violet Red Bile Agar. Thus, <b>fat</b> <b>content</b> in buttermilk was determined by the Mojonnier test to calculate churning efficiency. Colour was measured by colourimetry, while texture analysis was determined by the TA. XT 2 Texture Analyser. Water droplet size <b>of</b> <b>butter</b> was examined by confocal laser scanning microscope after staining with Nile Red and Acridine Orange. The cultured butter samples were also evaluated by consumer sensory panellists using hedonic scaling of six sensory attributes (smoothness, hardness, spreadability, melting rate, buttery flavour, and overall acceptance). Data were plotted on graphs and also analysed by analysis of variance (P< 0. 05), linear regression and interaction plot. There were significant differences (P< 0. 05) in moisture <b>content</b> <b>of</b> the three batches <b>of</b> <b>butter</b> which ranged from 13. 90 to 19. 19 %. Although the moisture <b>content</b> <b>of</b> two batches (1 and 3) <b>of</b> <b>butter</b> was slightly higher than the standard (16 %), it was within expected range. Manual washing butter grains after churning to remove water droplets may be inefficient to remove water droplets on the surface <b>of</b> <b>butter.</b> Most <b>of</b> the water droplets had a diameter of 5 μm which is desirable to inhibit the growth of spoilage microorganisms. No coliforms were detected in the cultured butter, indicating good hygiene standard during production. There were significant differences (P< 0. 05) in hardness of the three batches <b>of</b> cultured <b>butter.</b> Batch 2 had higher hardness than the other two batches, probably attributed to its low moisture <b>content.</b> The <b>fat</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> cultured <b>butter</b> <b>of</b> the three batches ranged between 75 % and 80 %, which was slightly lower than the expected 80 %. However, the results were reasonable, considering the higher moisture <b>content</b> <b>of</b> the <b>butter.</b> The cultured butter was well accepted by sensory panellists. Linear regression and interaction plot showed that spreadability and buttery flavour had significant effects (P< 0. 05) on the overall acceptance <b>of</b> the <b>butter.</b> The products were spreadable, presumably due to higher moisture content. The buttery flavour could be attributed to the aroma compounds produced by lactic acid bacteria through citrate metabolism during cream ripening. The dominant hue in the butter was yellowness, which slightly decreased during storage, presumably due to the loss of β-carotene. The pH <b>of</b> <b>butter</b> samples (5. 3 to 5. 8) during storage was slightly higher than in previous studies (4. 7 - 5. 2). The higher pH may be caused by poor acid production of the leuconostoc in the mixed culture. Cultured butter was successfully processed using a kitchen/domestic churning mixer. The churning efficiency of the equipment was lower than the expected range. The butter had good keeping quality and was well accepted by sensory panellists. The quality <b>of</b> the <b>butter</b> during storage was probably attributed to the optimal size of water droplets, which were successfully measured by the confocal laser scanning microscope method modified in this study...|$|R
