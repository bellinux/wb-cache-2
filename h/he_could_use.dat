The {{rules of the}} match were that the one who {{retrieved}} the cane from the pole was allowed to use the cane.

5|$|Brooker {{had other}} ideas that {{were removed from}} the {{original}} script because they would be complicated to do. He said <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>use</b> these ideas in a sequel story which would involve the main character finding messages that she had left for herself on previous days as the process of erasing her mind starts to not function. However, as the location for the episode no longer exists, he felt it would be more practical to create a graphic novel instead of recreating the scenario.|$|E
5|$|In 1953, Mainer and {{his wife}} settled in Flint, Michigan, where he found work at a General Motors factory. Although renouncing both the music {{industry}} and his trademark instrument, the banjo, he and Julia did continue to sing at gospel revival meetings. In the early 1960s, Molly O'Day convinced him that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>use</b> the banjo in gospel recordings, which spurred a series of religiously themed banjo albums beginning in 1961. He also began to record and tour with his wife.|$|E

5|$|The third {{match was}} between Triple H and Carlito in which Carlito {{could not be}} disqualified. Carlito took {{advantage}} of the situation as <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>use</b> any weapon. He attacked Triple H several times with steel chairs, and threw powder in his eyes. With the referee distracted, a blinded Triple H struck Carlito with a low blow followed by a Pedigree, leading to Triple H pinning Carlito to win the match.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Aquinas, while proposing five proofs of God's {{existence}} in his Summa Theologica, objected to Anselm's argument. He suggested that people cannot know {{the nature of}} God and, therefore, cannot conceive of God in the way Anselm proposed. The ontological argument would be meaningful only to someone who understands the essence of God completely. Aquinas reasoned that, as only God can completely know His essence, only <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>use</b> the argument. His rejection of the ontological argument caused other Catholic theologians to also reject the argument.|$|E
5|$|About 10:00, Kamimura's gunnery officer erroneously {{informed}} him that Izumo had expended three-quarters of her ammunition and he turned back after a five-minute rapid-fire barrage.

By this time she had been sunk by Naniwa and Takachiho. They had radioed Kamimura that she was sunk, but he did not receive the message. Shortly after the Japanese turned back, Gromoboi and Rossia were forced to heave-to to make repairs. Iwate was the most seriously damaged Japanese ship and suffered a total of 40 killed and 37 wounded.|$|E

5|$|At {{the back}} of Why Johnny Can't Read, Flesch had {{included}} 72 lists of words that young children {{should be able to}} read, and Spaulding provided Geisel with a similar list. Geisel later told biographers Judith and Neil Morgan that Spaulding had supplied him with a list of 348 words that every six-year-old should know and insisted that the book's vocabulary be limited to 225 words. However, according to Philip Nel, Geisel gave varying numbers in interviews from 1964 to 1969. He variously claimed that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>use</b> between 200 and 250 words from a list of between 300 and 400; the finished book contains 236 different words.|$|E
5|$|Chatwin went to Australia {{to learn}} more about Aboriginal culture, {{specifically}} the songlines or dreaming tracks. Each songline is a personal story and functions as a creation tale and a map, and each Aboriginal Australian has their own songline. Chatwin thought the songlines could be a metaphor <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>use</b> to support his ideas about humans' need to wander, which he believed was genetic. However, he struggled to fully understand and describe the songlines and their place in Aboriginal culture. This was due to Chatwin's approach to learning about the songlines. He spent several weeks in 1983 and 1984 in Australia, during which he primarily relied on non-Aboriginal people for information. Chatwin was limited by his inability to speak the Aboriginal languages. He interviewed people involved in the Land Rights movement, and he alienated many of them because he was oblivious to the politics and also because he was an admirer of Strehlow's work.|$|E

5|$|Great Barrington had a {{majority}} European American community, who treated Du Bois generally well. He attended the local integrated public school {{and played with}} white schoolmates. As an adult, he wrote about racism which he felt as a fatherless child {{and the experience of}} being a minority in the town. But teachers recognized his ability and encouraged his intellectual pursuits, and his rewarding experience with academic studies led him to believe that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>use</b> his knowledge to empower African Americans. Du Bois graduated from the town's Searles High School. When Du Bois decided to attend college, the congregation of his childhood church, the First Congregational Church of Great Barrington, raised the money for his tuition.Horne, p. 7.Lewis, pp. 39–40.|$|E
5|$|In actuality, Boyce {{stopped in}} London {{en route to}} a safari in British East Africa. It is true that an unknown Scout helped him and refused a tip. But this Scout only helped him cross a street; he did not take him to the Scout {{headquarters}} and Boyce never met Baden-Powell. Upon Boyce's request, the unknown Scout did give him the address of the Scout headquarters, where Boyce went and picked up a copy of Scouting For Boys and other printed material on Scouting. He read this while on safari and was so impressed that instead of making his return to America an around-the-world trip via San Francisco, he returned to the Scout headquarters in London. He volunteered to organize Scouting in America and was told that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>use</b> their manual. While Boyce's original account does not mention fog, a 1928 account says there was fog. Climatologists report no fog on that day in London.|$|E
5|$|In the {{two years}} {{following}} the release of Horse in 1941, Kurosawa searched for a story <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>use</b> to launch his directing career. Towards the end of 1942, {{about a year after}} the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, novelist Tsuneo Tomita published his Musashi Miyamoto-inspired judo novel, Sanshiro Sugata, the advertisements for which intrigued Kurosawa. He bought the book on its publication day, devoured it in one sitting, and immediately asked Toho to secure the film rights. Kurosawa's initial instinct proved correct as, within a few days, three other major Japanese studios also offered to buy the rights. Toho prevailed, and Kurosawa began pre-production on his debut work as director.|$|E

5|$|On 20 January 1989, off Vieques Island, Iowas Turret One fired {{six of the}} {{experimental}} shells using the supercharged powder bags. Skelley claimed {{that one of the}} 16inch shells traveled , setting a record for the longest conventional 16inch (406.4mm) shell ever fired. Although the shells had been fired without serious incident, Meyer and Petty Officer First Class Dale Eugene Mortensen, gun chief for Turret One, told Skelley that they would no longer participate in his experiments. Skelley asked Turret Two's gun chief, Senior Chief Reggie Ziegler, if <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>use</b> Turret Two for his experiments; Ziegler refused. Skelley then asked Lieutenant Phil Buch, Turret Two's officer in charge, and Buch acquiesced.|$|E
5|$|On {{returning}} to England in 1805, Brown began preparing {{an account of}} his Australian plant specimens. In September 1808, with Brown's account still far from finished, Swedish botanist Jonas Dryander asked him to prepare a separate paper on the Proteaceae, so that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>use</b> the genera erected by Brown in a new edition of Hortus Kewensis. Brown immediately began {{a study of the}} Proteaceae, and in January 1809 he read to the Linnean Society of London a monograph on the family entitled On the Proteaceae of Jussieu. Among the eighteen new genera presented was one that Brown named Josephia in honour of Banks.|$|E

Homer is faintly aware that something is wrong, but is unsure what is happening. After passing several bowling lessons, Jacques and Marge agree to meet each other for brunch.|$|E
