5|$|On March 28, 1941, Seaborg, {{physicist}} Emilio Segrè and Kennedy {{were able}} to demonstrate not only the presence of plutonium, but that was fissile, an <b>important</b> <b>distinction</b> that was crucial to the decisions made in directing Manhattan Project research. Arthur Wahl then began exploring the chemistry of the newly discovered element. In 1966, Room 307 of Gilman Hall on the campus at the Berkeley, where they did this work, was declared a U.S. National Historic Landmark.|$|E
5|$|The {{evolutionary}} biologist Richard Dawkins {{described himself}} as a neo-Paleyan in The Blind Watchmaker (1986), where he argued, following the evolutionary biologist and humanist Julian Huxley, that Paley's watch analogy fails to recognise the difference between the complexity of living organisms and that of inanimate objects. Living organisms can reproduce themselves, so they can change to become more complex from generation to generation. Inanimate objects such as watches are unable to pass on any changes, so they never become more complex unless a watchmaker redesigns them. The comparison breaks down, in Dawkins's view, because of this <b>important</b> <b>distinction.</b>|$|E
5|$|Democratisation {{still left}} open one <b>important</b> <b>distinction</b> between the former princely {{states and the}} former British provinces, namely, that since the princely states had signed limited Instruments of Accession {{covering}} only three subjects, they were insulated from government policies in other areas. The Congress viewed this as hampering its ability to frame policies that brought about social justice and national development. Consequently, they sought to secure to the central government {{the same degree of}} powers over the former princely states as it had over the former British provinces. In May 1948, at the initiative of V. P. Menon, a meeting was held in Delhi between the Rajpramukhs of the princely unions and the States Department, {{at the end of which}} the Rajpramukhs signed new Instruments of Accession which gave the Government of India the power to pass laws in respect of all matters that fell within the seventh schedule of the Government of India Act 1935. Subsequently, each of the princely unions, as well as Mysore and Hyderabad, agreed to adopt the Constitution of India as the constitution of that state, thus ensuring that they were placed in exactly the same legal position vis-à-vis the central government as the former British provinces. The only exception was Kashmir, whose relationship with India continued to be governed by the original Instrument of Accession, and the constitution produced by the state's Constituent Assembly.|$|E

5|$|The {{mechanisms}} of reproductive heritability and {{the origin of}} new traits remained a mystery. Towards this end, Darwin developed his provisional theory of pangenesis. In 1865, Gregor Mendel reported that traits were inherited in a predictable manner through the independent assortment and segregation of elements (later known as genes). Mendel's laws of inheritance eventually supplanted most of Darwin's pangenesis theory. August Weismann made the <b>important</b> <b>distinction</b> between germ cells {{that give rise to}} gametes (such as sperm and egg cells) and the somatic cells of the body, demonstrating that heredity passes through the germ line only. Hugo de Vries connected Darwin's pangenesis theory to Weismann's germ/soma cell distinction and proposed that Darwin's pangenes were concentrated in the cell nucleus and when expressed they could move into the cytoplasm to change the cells structure. De Vries {{was also one of the}} researchers who made Mendel's work well-known, believing that Mendelian traits corresponded to the transfer of heritable variations along the germline. To explain how new variants originate, de Vries developed a mutation theory that led to a temporary rift between those who accepted Darwinian evolution and biometricians who allied with de Vries. In the 1930s, pioneers in the field of population genetics, such as Ronald Fisher, Sewall Wright and J. B. S. Haldane set the foundations of evolution onto a robust statistical philosophy. The false contradiction between Darwin's theory, genetic mutations, and Mendelian inheritance was thus reconciled.|$|E

25|$|The trait EI {{model is}} general and subsumes the Goleman model {{discussed}} above.

25|$|Representation theory {{depends upon}} {{the nature of the}} vector space on which the {{algebraic}} object is represented. The most <b>important</b> <b>distinction</b> is between finite-dimensional representations and infinite-dimensional ones. In the infinite-dimensional case, additional structures are important (e.g. whether or not the space is a Hilbert space, Banach space, etc.). Additional algebraic structures can also be imposed in the finite-dimensional case.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} types of {{caesarean}} section (CS). An <b>important</b> <b>distinction</b> lies {{in the type of}} incision (longitudinal or transverse) made on the uterus, apart from the incision on the skin: the vast majority of skin incisions are a transverse suprapubic approach known as a Pfannenstiel incision but {{there is no way of}} knowing from the skin scar which way the uterine incision was conducted.|$|E

25|$|Elderly care {{emphasizes}} {{the social and}} personal requirements of senior citizens who need some assistance with daily activities and health care, but who desire to age with dignity.

It is also noteworthy that {{a large amount of}} global elderly care falls under the unpaid market sector.|$|E
25|$|In The Blind Watchmaker, Richard Dawkins {{argues that}} the watch analogy conflates the {{difference}} between the complexity that arises from living organisms that are able to reproduce themselves (and may cause to become more complex over time) and the complexity of inanimate objects, unable to pass on any reproductive changes (such as the multitude of parts manufactured in a watch).

At this time, only {{the owner of the}} royal {{insignia}} was considered legitimate king of Hungary.

25|$|Special Operations Teams deploy to multi-casualty {{incidents}} and disasters. While other agencies may {{be trained to}} do similar, the very <b>important</b> <b>distinction</b> is the staff of NSW Ambulance also provide life saving medical intervention {{to those who are}} lost, trapped or in a precarious situation. This is especially important as Fire and Rescue NSW personnel are generally Basic Life Support (BLS) trained hence not being trained to provide acceptable levels of professional clinical care.|$|E
25|$|Defamation {{law in the}} United States is {{much less}} plaintiff-friendly than its {{counterparts}} in European and the Commonwealth countries, due to {{the enforcement of the}} First Amendment. One very <b>important</b> <b>distinction</b> today is that European and Commonwealth jurisdictions adhere to a theory that every publication of a defamation gives rise to a separate claim, so that a defamation on the Internet could be sued on in any country in which it was read, while American law only allows one claim for the primary publication.|$|E
