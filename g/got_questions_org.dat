40|$|Class of 2014 AbstractSpecific Aims: To {{assess the}} {{prevalence}} of mothers asking pharmacists for pediatric dosing and mothers’ knowledge of pediatric OTC use. Subjects: Mothers with ≥ one child under 6 years old in a local mothers’ support group in Tucson. Methods: Questionnaires were sent out weekly for a month by the group’s listserv and social media website to determine {{the prevalence of}} mothers that ask pharmacists questions and assess their knowledge of OTC medications and what medical sources they use. Data on ages, ages of children, number of children, race/ethnicity, pharmacy visited, education, insurance coverage, and children’s chronic diseases were collected. Main Results: Twenty-six people responded. About 46 % {{of the participants were}} 30 - 34 years old. Forty-six percent of mothers had 2 children; 42 % had 1 child. About 54 % of mothers have asked a pharmacist for pediatric OTC dosing. The reasons mothers gave for not asking pharmacists dosing information were that they hadn’t needed to ask (25 %), they asked a doctor (16 %), they used an online resource (8 %), and they didn’t think about asking (8 %). Three questions assessed OTC knowledge; 50 % of participants <b>got</b> all <b>questions</b> correct, 38. 5 % <b>got</b> two <b>questions</b> correct, and 11. 5 % <b>got</b> one <b>question</b> correct. There wasn’t a difference in OTC knowledge and whether they asked a pharmacist questions (p= 0. 373). Conclusion: More than half of mothers asked pharmacists dosing information, but this percentage could still be higher. Fifty percent <b>got</b> all three <b>questions</b> right, 38. 5 % <b>got</b> two <b>questions</b> correct, and 11. 5 % of mothers <b>got</b> only 1 <b>question</b> correct...|$|R
40|$|Maintaining {{the museum}} {{integrity}} as a conserving and educational institution on one hand, {{and making the}} museum more competitive and popular on the other hand, {{is one of the}} main challenges for museums. This research tried to find out if a newly designed collaborative quest was suitable to be both educative and enjoyable. Special attention was focused on the influence of personal interest on education and enjoyment. To find an answer, an experiment was conducted in Museon in which groups of four participants, with at least two children, played the quest. The quest started and ended at a multi-touch table, which was used because it was very suitable for collaboration. Between the parts at the table participants had to answer questions, which were provided at terminal computers in the main exhibition of Museon. Two conditions were compared. Participants in the normal condition <b>got</b> <b>questions</b> about subjects they had indicated as interesting at the start at the table, participants in the inverse conditions <b>got</b> <b>questions</b> about subjects they had not indicated as interesting. It showed that children in the normal condition scored higher for understanding than children in the inverse condition. For remembering and enjoyment no differences were found between the two conditions, but scores were quite high. Th...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the degree to which patients have perceived that they <b>got</b> <b>questions</b> or advice about eating habits and smoking habits at their last visit at the dental clinic and if this information was differently distributed between different age groups. A further aim was to study whether there were differences in the proportions of questions and advice given to individuals who perceived problems regarding caries and gum bleeding compared to those that did not feel they had problems. The results are based on a postal questionnaire survey,"Life and Health 2008 ". The study was conducted in a population of women and men aged 18 - 84 years in 5 counties in Sweden. A total of 68, 710 questionnaires were sent out and the response rate was 59. 2 %. Substantial differences in proportions existed between age groups regarding who received questions and advice related to dental caries and periodontal disease. The differences between age groups regarding information were statistically significant since it was less common that older people <b>got</b> <b>questions</b> and advice than younger. These differences also exist, but less pronounced, between those with disease related problems and those without. Three factors were statistically significantly associated with information. Age, education level and problems with caries or bleeding gums had statistical effect on the prevalence of questions and advice related to eating habits or smoking habits respectively. In conclusion, it is an urgent need of education in methods for dental staff if they want to contribute to changes in life style behaviors for their patients since most patients today don't perceive that they got important disease relevant information at the last dental visit...|$|R
