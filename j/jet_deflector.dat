40|$|The {{jet noise}} {{is the main}} cause of the vibro-acoustic loading and {{internal}} noise (noise felt by the payload and critical launch vehicle systems) experienced by the launch vehicle during lift-off phase. Techniques such as water injection are being attempted to reduce the launch vehicle noise during lift-off {{and its impact on the}} sensitive payload and sub-systems of the launch vehicle are yet to be studied. The current work deals with estimation of noise levels on the entire launch vehicle using a modified version of Eldred’s method. The prediction algorithm takes into account the three dimensional nature of <b>jet</b> <b>deflector</b> and consequent distribution of noise sources. Effect of water injection on the noise levels is also attempted. Results show that due to the three dimensional nature of the sources, the noise levels on the front side are higher than on the umbilical tower side.

40|$|AbstractDuring load {{tripping}} of {{the hydraulic}} turbine at the Bois power plant, the turbined flow is directly transferred and discharged into an external canal without releasing an alert flow. The {{operation of the turbine}} in bypass mode, which consists in maintaining flow through the penstock and the turbine nozzles, was therefore envisaged to reduce flow variations in the short-circuited section of the scheme, in which people may be found, particularly during the summer season (safety stake). To validate the feasibility of this type of operating mode and, specifically, to verify the structural integrity in operation of the components impacted by the <b>jet</b> (<b>deflector,</b> control rod, jack…), studies were jointly carried out by EDF and CETIM, and a test-calculation program was initiated. This program included preliminary calculations using a finite element model, a campaign of tests in operating conditions (with vibration measurements and dynamic extensometric measurements) and an analysis of the potential damage due to fatigue. In the end, the study made it possible to show that the damage due to fatigue resulting from the operation of the Bois turbine in bypass operating mode remained in an acceptable range...|$|E

30|$|The {{process of}} the gas jet from {{aircraft}} engines impacting a <b>jet</b> blast <b>deflector</b> {{is not only a}} complex fluid–solid coupling problem that is not easy to compute, but also a safety issue that seriously interferes with flight deck environment. The computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method is used to simulate numerically the impact effect of gas jet from aircraft engines on a <b>jet</b> blast <b>deflector</b> by using the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations and turbulence models. First of all, during the pre-processing of numerical computation, a sub-domains hybrid meshing scheme is adopted to reduce mesh number and improve mesh quality. Then, four different turbulence models including shear-stress transport (SST) k-w, standard k-w, standard k-ε and Reynolds stress model (RSM) are used to compare and verify the correctness of numerical methods for gas jet from a single aircraft engine. The predicted values are in good agreement with the experimental data, and the distribution and regularity of shock wave, velocity, pressure and temperature of a single aircraft engine are got. The results show that SST k-w turbulence model is more suitable for the numerical simulation of compressible viscous gas jet with high prediction accuracy. Finally, the impact effect of gas jet from two aircraft engines on a <b>jet</b> blast <b>deflector</b> is analyzed based on the above numerical method, not only the flow parameters of gas jet and the interaction regularity between gas jet and the <b>jet</b> blast <b>deflector</b> are got, but also the thermal shock properties and dynamic impact characteristics of gas jet impacting the <b>jet</b> blast <b>deflector</b> are got. So the dangerous activity area of crew and equipments on the flight deck can be predicted qualitatively and quantitatively. The proposed research explores out a correct numerical method for the fluid–solid interaction during the impact process of supersonic gas jet, which provides an effective technical support for design, thermal ablation and structural damage analysis of a new <b>jet</b> blast <b>deflector.</b>|$|R
25|$|A <b>jet</b> blast <b>deflector</b> (JBD) or {{blast fence}} is a safety device that redirects the high energy exhaust from a jet engine to prevent damage and injury. The {{structure}} must {{be strong enough}} to withstand heat and high speed air streams as well as dust and debris carried by the turbulent air. Without a <b>deflector,</b> <b>jet</b> blast can be dangerous to people, equipment and other aircraft.|$|R
25|$|Aircraft {{carriers}} use <b>jet</b> blast <b>deflectors</b> at {{the rear}} of aircraft catapults, positioned to protect other aircraft from exhaust blast damage. <b>Jet</b> blast <b>deflectors</b> are made of heavy duty material that is raised and lowered by hydraulic cylinders or linear actuators. The <b>jet</b> blast <b>deflector</b> lies flush with and serves as a portion of the flight deck until the aircraft to be launched rolls over it {{on the way to the}} catapult. When the aircraft is clear of the deflector, the heavy panel is raised into position to redirect the hot jet blast. As soon as the deflector is raised, another aircraft can be brought into position behind it, and flight deck personnel can perform final readiness duties without the danger of hot, violent exhaust gases. Such systems were installed on aircraft carriers in the late 1940s and early 1950s, as jet-powered aircraft began to appear in navies.|$|R

30|$|The {{high-temperature}} and high-speed gas jet from {{aircraft engines}} {{is in an}} over expansion state when the aircraft engines are in full afterburner state to takeoff, which has a serious impact on the flight deck due to the complicated physical phenomena such as shock wave, noise and gas tempering caused by the interaction between gas jet and the <b>jet</b> blast <b>deflector</b> [1, 2]. The gas jet from aircraft engines has basic characteristics of supersonic flow and complex wave system. When the gas jet impacts a <b>jet</b> blast <b>deflector,</b> the thermal shock and dynamic impact will lead to thermal ablation and structure damage. The safety limits for pressure and temperature of the gas jet {{need to be considered}} due to the relatively small flight deck for carrying and taking off.

30|$|Because {{supersonic}} gas jet has {{the characteristics}} of high temperature, high pressure and high speed, {{there are two main}} difficulties in numerical computation. One is that the numerical computation of supersonic gas jet with complicated geometric model and flow characteristics is sensitive to initial field. The initial deviation from actual physical field will cause difficulty of convergence, even divergence at the beginning of computation. The other is that a high-precision discrete format, appropriate turbulence model and boundary conditions are needed to capture shock wave and expansion wave of the flow field, which leads to a long computation time and large memory usage. Therefore, domestic and foreign scholars usually use two-dimensional numerical simulation model to carry out the research [9 – 11]. But the flow information of two-dimensional numerical results is limited, which is unable to analyze the anisotropic impact effect of gas jet on a <b>jet</b> blast <b>deflector.</b> Three-dimensional numerical model was used by some scholars to simulate the impact process of gas jet, but the thermal shock effect of gas jet was not considered [12, 13]. According to the geometry of a single aircraft engine and {{the characteristics of}} gas jet, numerical simulation of the gas jet is made combined with different turbulence models. The high-precision results with SST k-w turbulence model are analyzed and verified. Then a scheme of sub-domains hybrid mesh is designed based on three-dimensional numerical model with coupling aircraft engines and a <b>jet</b> blast <b>deflector.</b> The parameters such as shock wave, velocity, pressure and temperature are got, and impact effect of the gas jet from aircraft engines on a <b>jet</b> blast <b>deflector</b> and the surrounding environment is analyzed.|$|R

40|$|The U. S. Bureau of Mines has {{patented}} {{and transferred}} to industry an abrasive-enhanced water-jet rock drill. This drill incorporates three novel components: a collimator, <b>jet</b> <b>deflectors</b> for cutting clearance, and an unpressurized swivel, which rotates at 1, 000 rpm while passing 20 gpm of an abrasive slurry flowing at 1, 000 ft/s. Drilling occurs through the action of a 10, 000 -psi, 2 O-gpm water jet into which is entrained 72 lb/min of abrasives. The pumps, hoses, and fittings are those commonly used in the water-jet-cleaning industry. Only inexpensive, common sandblasting abrasives are used. This drill can cut through hard rocks with moderate-pressure jets; e. g., rocks with a compressive strength of 73, 000 psi can be drilled with a 1 O,OOO-psi abrasive jet. In addition to drilling holes, the drill can cut deep, narrow kerfs; collar a hole at any angle; drill through rubble; and chamber holes.

30|$|In short, the <b>jet</b> blast <b>deflector</b> {{can well}} deflect high-speed, {{high-pressure}} and high-temperature gas jet, and main harm {{of the gas}} jet from twin engines on crew and equipments on the flight deck is greatly weakened.

As a result of the reheat from the Spey turbofans, the ship's <b>jet</b> blast <b>deflectors</b> (JBD) were not used; instead a steel plate was fixed to the deck to absorb the heat of the engines building to launch, and fire hoses were used after each launch to prevent them melting.|$|R
