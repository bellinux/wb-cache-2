25|$|By November 1876, the Mason County War had petered {{out after}} about a dozen {{individuals}} had been killed. Scott Cooley {{was thought to be}} dead, and Johnny Ringo and <b>his</b> <b>pal</b> George Gladden were locked up once again. One of Ringo's alleged cellmates was the notorious killer John Wesley Hardin. While Gladden was sentenced to 99 years, Ringo appears to have been acquitted. Two years later, Ringo was a constable in Loyal Valley, Texas. Soon after this, he traveled to Arizona for the first time.|$|E

2500|$|Sean Ryon of XXL commented saying, [...] "Despite the {{disparity}} of styles, the album's sequencing affords it {{a greater sense of}} cohesion. Listeners will have little trouble transition between the booming [...] "Watching Movies" [...] and more subdued affairs like [...] "Suplexes Inside of Complexes And Duplexes". This is due to Mac's excellent production throughout as Larry Fisherman." [...] Nick Catucci of Rolling Stone stated, [...] "On Watching Movies, he tosses in a chain saw: punch-drunk slow-and-arty beats he produced with Diplo, Flying Lotus and <b>his</b> <b>pal</b> Earl Sweatshirt. The often mesmerizing production may be a crafty way of distancing himself from Cheesy Mac, the party rapper responsible for the irresistible bro-down [...] "Donald Trump"." ...|$|E
2500|$|Good {{friends in}} real life, Fred Allen and Jack Benny {{inadvertently}} hatched a running gag in 1937, {{when a child}} prodigy, violinist Stuart Canin, gave a very credible performance on the Allen show, inspiring an Allen wisecrack about [...] "a certain alleged violinist," [...] who should hide in shame over his poor playing. Allen often mentioned his show-business friends on the air ("Mr. Jacob Haley of Newton Highlands, Massachusetts" [...] was Allen's way of saying hello to <b>his</b> <b>pal</b> Jack Haley), and on the Canin broadcast Allen knew Benny would be listening. Benny, according to Allen biographer Taylor, burst out laughing, then responded in kind on his own program. And they were off and running, going at it {{for over a decade}} and doing it well enough to convince some if not many fans of both shows that the two comedians really were blood enemies.|$|E
2500|$|The {{popularity}} of the Muppets has been so pervasive that the characters have been viewed by the media as celebrities in their own right. The Muppets have received their own collective star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, with Kermit having his own individual star as well. The characters have also presented at the Academy Awards and Emmy Awards; made cameo appearances in such feature films as Rocky III, An American Werewolf in London and Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium; and have been interviewed on the news magazine 60 Minutes. Kermit the Frog was interviewed early on in Jon Stewart's run on The Daily Show, guest hosted The Tonight Show, Jimmy Kimmel Live!, , America's Funniest Home Videos and an April Fools' Day edition of Larry King Live; and has served as Grand Marshal of the Tournament of Roses Parade. The characters also appeared in-character on such sitcoms and dramas as The Cosby Show, The West Wing, and The Torkelsons. The music video for the Weezer song [...] "Keep Fishin'" [...] is premised on the band performing on The Muppet Show and features appearances by several characters. On September 28, 2005, the United States Postal Service released a Jim Henson and the Muppets postage stamp series. The Muppets also appeared on Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve for the 2008 countdown on December 31, 2007. Kermit, Rizzo, and others welcomed {{in the new year}} with a series of messages to welcome viewers back from the advertising breaks. After one such segment, with Kermit in Times Square, co-host Ryan Seacrest thanked <b>his</b> <b>pal</b> [...] "Kerms" [...] for the help bringing in '08. Miss Piggy has appeared as a guest on The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson and Kermit the Frog appeared on Hollywood Squares and as one of the celebrity commentators on VH1's I Love documentary series.|$|E

60|$|At half-past nine Jerry Purdy came to {{call for}} <b>his</b> <b>pal.</b> Jerry was Morel's bosom friend, and Mrs. Morel disliked him.

His nature was cold and shrewd. Generous where he {{intended}} to be generous, {{he seemed to be}} very fond of Morel, and more or less to take charge of him.|$|E

The Christian Scientist has no ailment; to him there is no such thing, and he will not use the lying word. All that happens to him is, that upon his attention an imaginary disturbance sometimes obtrudes itself which claims to be an ailment, but isn't.|$|E
