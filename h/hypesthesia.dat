40|$|Dr. Nagatani and colleagues, {{in their}} {{comments}} on our study {{of natural history}} of sphenoid-orbital meningiomas (SOM) [8], have recommended not resecting the portion of SOM involving cavernous sinus (CS) and superior orbital fissure (SOF) {{in order to avoid}} the risk of permanent cranial nerve dysfunction. As indeed pointed out, the resection of SOMs is associated with a range of complications. The reported numbers of postoperative neurological complications after resections of SOMs (primarily cranial nerve palsies) range up to 100 % for trigeminal <b>hypesthesias</b> [3, 9], 13 % for oculomotor palsy [2, 5, 10], and up to 6 % mortality have also been reported [2, 5]. Furthermore, a recurrence rate of up to 50 % after a surgical resection has been reported [1]. As we have explained in our recent paper on the surgical results of SOM [7], given the limited improvement in prognosis and the complications involved in surgery, the aim of surgical treatment for SOM should be restoration of visual acuity and reduction of proptosis, rather than complete tumor removal. In our group of 66 patients, surgery arrested visual deterioration or improved visual acuity in 91 % of our patients. Furthermore, a substantial reduction in proptosis was achieved in 85 % of the patients. Proptosis was reduced by 2. 6 ± 2. 6 mm; however, we had hoped to achieve a better result and were disappointed by this level of improvement [7]...|$|R

40|$|We have {{operated}} on nine {{patients with a}} prepontine epidermoid extending to the bilateral cistern or the unilateral middle fossa using the anterior transpetrosal approach since 1986. The preoperative symptoms were unilateral trigeminal neuralgia, hearing disturbance, gait disturbance, double vision, facial <b>hypesthesia,</b> hemifacial spasm, and dysphagia. The most common neurological sign was unilateral trigeminal nerve disturbance. In two patients with useful hearing preoperatively lost, the labyrinth and mastoid air cells {{as well as the}} petrous apex were resected to extend the surgical field. Tumors were totally removed, except for capsules that were tightly adhered to the brain stem, cranial nerve, and vessels. The trigeminal neuralgia, hemifacial spasm, and dysphagia disappeared, but double vision improved only one out of three cases, and facial <b>hypesthesia</b> was unchanged in all cases. There were no postoperative deaths. New abducens palsy appeared in four cases and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage appeared in three cases postoperatively, but later these symptoms disappeared. In one case, postoperative chemical meningitis developed, and a ventricular shunt was required later to treat hydrocephalus. Postoperative follow-up, an average of 5, 7 years, did not show any increases in any of the tumors.

40|$|Abstract Background Although {{magnesium}} ions (Mg 2 +) {{are known}} to display many similar features to other 2 + charged cations, {{they seem to have}} quite an important and unique role in biological settings, such as NMDA blocking effect. However, the role of Mg 2 + in the neural transmission system has not been studied as sufficiently as calcium ions (Ca 2 +). To clarify the sensory effects of Mg 2 + in peripheral nervous systems, sensory changes after intradermal injection of Mg 2 + were studied in humans. Methods Magnesium sulphate, magnesium chloride and saline were injected into the skin of the anterior region of forearms in healthy volunteers and injection-induced irritating pain ("irritating pain", for short), tactile sensation, tactile pressure thresholds, pinch-pain changes and intolerable heat pain thresholds of the lesion were monitored. Results Flare formation was observed immediately after magnesium sulphate or magnesium chloride injection. We found that intradermal injections of magnesium sulphate and magnesium chloride transiently caused irritating pain, <b>hypesthesia</b> to noxious and innocuous mechanical stimulations, whereas secondary hyperalgesia due to mechanical stimuli was not observed. In contrast to mechanical stimuli, intolerable heat pain-evoking temperature was significantly decreased at the injection site. In addition to these results, spontaneous pain was immediately attenuated by local cooling. Conclusion Membrane-stabilizing effect and peripheral NMDA-blocking effect possibly produced magnesium-induced mechanical <b>hypesthesia,</b> and extracellular cation-induced sensitization of TRPV 1 channels was thought to be the primary mechanism of magnesium-induced heat hyperalgesia. </p...|$|E

40|$|Pain relief {{comparable}} with radiofrequency thermocoagulation (RFT) alone and fewer side effects than RFT {{have been achieved}} by combination treatment with pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) and short-duration RFT in trigeminal neuralgia (TN). CASE DESCRIPTION: We report the successful management of recurrent TN after RFT with single PRF in 2 patients. The RFT treatment was performed in 2 - 3 cycles for each division, with the lesion setting at 75 °C- 80 °C for 90 seconds. The PRF treatment was applied for 120 seconds, with a generator output of 45 V, not exceeding a temperature of 42 °C {{at the tip of}} the electrode. In case 1, pain relief was immediately achieved by RFT (75 °C for 90 seconds), with moderate <b>hypesthesia.</b> Relapse of the triggered pain occurred 6 months later, and PRF was then applied. Long-term (18 months) pain relief without any additional pharmacologic or other treatment was reported. In case 2, a second RFT treatment at a higher temperature (80 °C) was performed after recurrence after the first RFT within a week. Accompanied by worse <b>hypesthesia,</b> complete pain relief lasted for 6 months until the recurrence of pain was triggered by toothbrushing. PRF was then applied, and complete analgesia with long-term follow-up (28 months) was achieved. CONCLUSIONS: The PRF treatment for recurrent TN after RFT in this study could be viewed as a combination of PRF and RFT treatments in succession. Therefore, PRF and RFT should be considered to be complementary rather than alternative in the management of TN...|$|E

40|$|Object The goal of {{this study}} was to {{establish}} whether clear patterns of initial pain freedom could be identified when treating patients with classic trigeminal neuralgia (TN) by using Gamma Knife surgery (GKS). The authors compared <b>hypesthesia</b> and pain recurrence rates to see if statistically significant differences could be found. Methods Between July 1992 and November 2010, 737 patients presenting with TN underwent GKS and prospective evaluation at Timone University Hospital in Marseille, France. In this study the authors analyzed the cases of 497 of these patients, who participated in follow-up longer than 1 year, did not have megadolichobasilar artery- or multiple sclerosis-related TN, and underwent GKS only once; in other words, the focus was on cases of classic TN with a single radiosurgical treatment. Radiosurgery was performed with a Leksell Gamma Knife (model B, C, or Perfexion) using both MR and CT imaging targeting. A single 4 -mm isocenter was positioned in the cisternal portion of the trigeminal nerve at a median distance of 7. 8 mm (range 4. 5 - 14 mm) anterior to the emergence of the nerve. A median maximum dose of 85 Gy (range 70 - 90 Gy) was delivered. Using empirical methods and assisted by a chart with clear cut-off periods of pain free distribution, the authors were able to divide patients who experienced freedom from pain into 3 separate groups: patients who became pain free within the first 48 hours post-GKS; those who became pain free between 48 hours and 30 days post-GKS; and those who became pain free more than 30 days after GKS. Results The median age in the 497 patients was 68. 3 years (range 28. 1 - 93. 2 years). The median follow-up period was 43. 75 months (range 12 - 174. 41 months). Four hundred fifty-four patients (91. 34 %) were initially pain free within a median time of 10 days (range 1 - 459 days) after GKS. One hundred sixty-nine patients (37. 2 %) became pain free within the first 48 hours (Group PF(≤ 48 hours)), 194 patients (42. 8 %) between posttreatment Day 3 and Day 30 (Group PF((> 48 hours, ≤ 30 days))), and 91 patients (20 %) after 30 days post-GKS (Group PF(> 30 days)). Differences in postoperative <b>hypesthesia</b> were found: in Group PF(≤ 48 hours) 18 patients (13. 7 %) developed postoperative <b>hypesthesia,</b> compared with 30 patients (19 %) in Group PF((> 48 hours, ≤ 30 days)) and 22 patients (30. 6 %) in Group PF(> 30 days) (p = 0. 014). One hundred fifty-seven patients (34. 4 %) who initially became free from pain experienced a recurrence of pain with a median delay of 24 months (range 0. 62 - 150. 06 months). There were no statistically significant differences between the patient groups with respect to pain recurrence: 66 patients (39 %) in Group PF(≤ 48 hours) experienced pain recurrence, compared with 71 patients (36. 6 %) in Group PF((> 48 hours, ≤ 30 days)) and 27 patients (29. 7 %) in Group PF(> 30 days) (p = 0. 515). Conclusions A substantial number of patients (169 cases, 37. 2 %) became pain free within the first 48 hours.

Removal of the molar via intraoral approach was chosen avoiding facial nerve branches and unnecessary scar formation. Coronoid process is removed, the tooth is separated and removed. The defect is filled with iliac cancellous bone. The coronoid process was fixed as a cover with a resorbable plate and screws (BIONX). RESULTS: Removal via intraoral approach is possible. <b>Hypesthesia</b> existed postoperatively, became normal later. CONCLUSION: Annual observation is strongly recommended. Intraoral approach is superior to the extraoral approach. Removal of the coronoid process minimizes the masticator forces. Separation of the tooth is essential. Filling the defect with cancellous bone accelerates the healing...|$|E
