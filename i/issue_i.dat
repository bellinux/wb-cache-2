25|$|Speaking {{before the}} opening of the Ordinary Synod of Bishops on the Family in October 2015, McAleese {{ridiculed}} the concept of 300 elderly celibates coming together to discuss family questions. Addressing a meeting of the Global Network of Rainbow (LGBT) Catholics {{on the eve of the}} Vatican’s Synod on the Family, former president McAleese said: “In the days when I was president, we had workshops on various issues and if I wanted to look at an <b>issue,</b> <b>I</b> would consult the experts... But look at the Synod, I have to ask the question: If I wanted expertise on the family, I honestly cannot say that the first thing that would come into my mind would be to call together 300 celibate males who, as far we know, have never raised a child...“Let me repeat a question I asked last year when I saw the Vatican’s lengthy pre-Synod questionnaire, namely how many of these men have ever changed a child’s nappy? For me that is a very important question because it is one thing to say that we all grew up in families, we had mothers, we had fathers but it is a very different thing to raise a gay child, a very different thing to live daily in a relationship and to police the relationships between children and the world.” Acknowledging that the Synod will doubtless be considering the Catholic Church's pastoral approach to homosexuals, McAleese described herself as “cynical” about the outcome of the forthcoming three week consultation.|$|E

At all. It was so logically unsound that it was distracting." [...] The notion that Rachel would not know that Cats had closed eleven years before was derided by Brown and Amy Reiter of the Los Angeles Times, while Rachel and Kurt's encounter with [...] "the only friendly security guard in New York City" [...] was mocked by Anthony Benigno of The Faster Times and Entertainment Weekly Sandra Gonzalez.
