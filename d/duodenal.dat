5|$|World Congress of Gastroenterology {{recommends}} eradicating H. pylori to cure <b>duodenal</b> ulcers.|$|E
5|$|Covacci et al. {{sequence}} the CagA gene, which encodes for a cytotoxin-associated surface protein, which correlated {{strongly with}} strains of H. pylori that caused <b>duodenal</b> ulcers. This {{was the first}} description of a virulence factor for H. pylori infection determined by molecular techniques.|$|E
5|$|Rauws and Tytgat {{describe}} cure of <b>duodenal</b> ulcer by {{eradication of}} H. pylori using Borody's triple therapy combination. Triple-therapy, modernized to a proton pump inhibitor and two antibiotics, soon becomes first line therapy for eradication.|$|E
5|$|Helicobacter pylori, {{previously}} Campylobacter pylori, is a gram-negative, microaerophilic bacterium found {{usually in}} the stomach. It was identified in 1982 by Australian scientists Barry Marshall and Robin Warren, who {{found that it was}} present in a person with chronic gastritis and gastric ulcers, conditions not previously believed to have a microbial cause. It is also linked to the development of <b>duodenal</b> ulcers and stomach cancer. However, over 80% of individuals infected with the bacterium are asymptomatic, and it may {{play an important role in}} the natural stomach ecology.|$|E
5|$|In 1978, Feynman sought medical {{treatment}} for abdominal pains and {{was diagnosed with}} liposarcoma, a rare form of cancer. Surgeons removed a tumor {{the size of a}} football that had crushed one kidney and his spleen. Further operations were performed in October 1986 and October 1987. He was again hospitalized at the UCLA Medical Center on February3, 1988. A ruptured <b>duodenal</b> ulcer caused kidney failure, and he declined to undergo the dialysis that might have prolonged his life for a few months. Watched over by his wife Gweneth, sister Joan, and cousin Frances Lewine, he died on February15, 1988.|$|E
5|$|Although {{many aspects}} of Hubbard's life story are disputed, there is general {{agreement}} about its basic outline. Born in Tilden, Nebraska, {{he spent much of}} his childhood in Helena, Montana. He traveled in Asia and the South Pacific in the late 1920s after his father, an officer in the United States Navy, was posted to the U.S. naval base on Guam. He attended George Washington University in Washington, D.C. {{at the start of the}} 1930s, before dropping out and beginning his career as a prolific writer of pulp fiction stories. He served briefly in the United States Marine Corps Reserve and was an officer in the United States Navy during World War II, briefly commanding two ships, the USS YP-422 and USS PC-815. He was removed both times when his superiors found him incapable of command. The last few months of his active service were spent in a hospital, being treated for a <b>duodenal</b> ulcer.|$|E
5|$|Harvard University offered Holst a lectureship for {{the first}} six months of 1932. Arriving via New York he was pleased to be reunited with his brother, Emil, whose acting career under the name of Ernest Cossart had taken him to Broadway; but Holst was dismayed by the continual attentions of press interviewers and photographers. He enjoyed his time at Harvard, but was taken ill while there: a <b>duodenal</b> ulcer prostrated him for some weeks. He {{returned}} to England, joined briefly by his brother for a holiday together in the Cotswolds. His health declined, and he withdrew further from musical activities. One of his last efforts was to guide the young players of the St Paul's Girls' School orchestra through one of his final compositions, the Brook Green Suite, in March 1934.|$|E
5|$|He {{was again}} struck by {{depression}} in 1948 when Sir Alfred Thompson Denning and Sir John Singleton were both {{appointed to the}} Court of Appeal ahead of him, despite having been appointed to the High Court after him. On 30 July 1949, Birkett went to the Lord Chancellor and discussed the possibility of his appointment to the Court of Appeal, but left dissatisfied. On 14 November, a <b>duodenal</b> ulcer perforated, from which he spent six months recovering. In an attempt to appease him, the Lord Chancellor offered Birkett a peerage without salary on 8 May 1950, but he refused as he lacked the means to survive without paid employment. While speaking {{at a conference in}} Washington, D.C. on 31 August 1950, he received a telegram from the Lord Chancellor offering him appointment to the Court of Appeal; he immediately wired back his acceptance. He was sworn in on 2 October, and heard his first case the following day.|$|E
5|$|Individuals {{infected}} with H. pylori have a 10 to 20% lifetime {{risk of developing}} peptic ulcers and a 1 to 2% risk of acquiring stomach cancer. Inflammation of the pyloric antrum {{is more likely to}} lead to <b>duodenal</b> ulcers, while inflammation of the corpus (body of the stomach) is more likely to lead to gastric ulcers and gastric carcinoma. However, H. pylori possibly plays a role only in the first stage that leads to common chronic inflammation, but not in further stages leading to carcinogenesis. A meta-analysis conducted in 2009 concluded the eradication of H. pylori reduces gastric cancer risk in previously infected individuals, suggesting the continued presence of H. pylori constitutes a relative risk factor of 65% for gastric cancers; in terms of absolute risk, the increase was from 1.1% to 1.7%.|$|E
5|$|By 1960, Carson {{had more}} than enough {{research}} material, and the writing was progressing rapidly. In addition to the thorough literature search, she had investigated hundreds of individual incidents of pesticide exposure and the human sickness and ecological damage that resulted. However, in January, a <b>duodenal</b> ulcer followed by several infections kept her bedridden for weeks, greatly delaying the completion of Silent Spring. As she was nearing full recovery in March (just as she was completing drafts of the two cancer chapters of her book), she discovered cysts in her left breast, one of which necessitated a mastectomy. Though her doctor described the procedure as precautionary and recommended no further treatment, by December Carson discovered that the tumor was in fact malignant and the cancer had metastasized. Her research was also delayed by revision work for a new edition of The Sea Around Us, and by a collaborative photo essay with Erich Hartmann. Most of the research and writing {{was done by the}} fall of 1960, except for the discussion of recent research on biological controls and investigations of a handful of new pesticides. However, further health troubles slowed the final revisions in 1961 and early 1962.|$|E
25|$|The {{timing of}} the {{symptoms}} {{in relation to the}} meal may differentiate between gastric and <b>duodenal</b> ulcers: A gastric ulcer would give epigastric pain during the meal, as gastric acid production is increased as food enters the stomach. Symptoms of <b>duodenal</b> ulcers would initially be relieved by a meal, as the pyloric sphincter closes to concentrate the stomach contents, therefore acid is not reaching the duodenum. <b>Duodenal</b> ulcer pain would manifest mostly 2–3hours after the meal, when the stomach begins to release digested food and acid into the duodenum.|$|E
25|$|Some {{may develop}} abscess, pseudocyst or <b>duodenal</b> obstruction.|$|E
25|$|The {{possible}} {{persistence of}} symptoms after surgical bypass {{can be traced}} to the remaining prominence of reversed peristalsis in contrast to direct peristalsis, although the precipitating factor (the <b>duodenal</b> compression) has been bypassed or relieved. Reversed peristalsis has been shown to respond to <b>duodenal</b> circular drainage—a complex and invasive open surgical procedure originally implemented and performed in China.|$|E
25|$|Andy Cunningham died of <b>duodenal</b> cancer on 5 June 2017, aged 67.|$|E
25|$|Type II: Ulcer in {{the body}} in {{combination}} with <b>duodenal</b> ulcers. Associated with acid oversecretion.|$|E
25|$|Other {{documented}} {{features are}} cholangitis, pancreatitis, eosinophilic splenitis, acute appendicitis and giant refractory <b>duodenal</b> ulcer.|$|E
25|$|Morgan had {{throughout}} his life suffered with a chronic <b>duodenal</b> ulcer. In 1945, at age 79, he experienced a severe heart attack and died from a ruptured artery.|$|E
25|$|The {{incidence}} of <b>duodenal</b> ulcers has dropped significantly {{during the last}} 30years, while the {{incidence of}} gastric ulcers has shown a small increase, mainly caused by {{the widespread use of}} NSAIDs.|$|E
25|$|In {{some cases}} of SMA syndrome, severe {{malnutrition}} accompanying spontaneous wasting may occur. This, in turn, increases the <b>duodenal</b> compression, which worsens the underlying cause, creating {{a cycle of}} worsening symptoms.|$|E
25|$|In 1941, Matisse was {{diagnosed}} with <b>duodenal</b> cancer. The surgery, while successful, resulted in serious complications from which he nearly died. Being bedridden for three months resulted in his developing a new art form using paper and scissors.|$|E
25|$|Like most mineral nutrients, the {{majority}} of the iron absorbed from digested food or supplements is absorbed in the duodenum by enterocytes of the <b>duodenal</b> lining. These cells have special molecules that allow them to move iron into the body. To be absorbed, dietary iron can be absorbed as part of a protein such as heme protein or iron must be in its ferrous Fe2+ form. A ferric reductase enzyme on the enterocytes’ brush border, <b>duodenal</b> cytochrome B (Dcytb), reduces ferric Fe3+ to Fe2+. A protein called divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1), which can transport several divalent metals across the plasma membrane, then transports iron across the enterocyte’s cell membrane into the cell.|$|E
25|$|The primary uses of esomeprazole are {{gastroesophageal}} reflux disease, {{treatment and}} maintenance of erosive esophagitis, treatment of <b>duodenal</b> ulcers caused by H. pylori, prevention of gastric ulcers in those on chronic NSAID therapy, and treatment of gastrointestinal ulcers associated with Crohn's disease.|$|E
25|$|Esomeprazole is {{combined}} with the antibiotics clarithromycin and amoxicillin (or metronidazole instead of amoxicillin in penicillin-hypersensitive patients) in a 10-day eradication triple therapy for Helicobacter pylori. Infection by H. pylori is a causative factor {{in the majority of}} peptic and <b>duodenal</b> ulcers.|$|E
25|$|After living {{nearly twenty}} years in retirement, Willis died at her London home on 11 March 1964, in her 87th year, of a {{perforated}} <b>duodenal</b> ulcer. She was cremated, and her ashes were buried in a memorial garden at Downe House. Her estate at death amounted to £16,510.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{protective}} effect of alcohol consumption against active infection with H. pylori In contrast, alcohol intake (comparing those who drink > 30g of alcohol per day to non-drinkers) is {{not associated with}} higher risk of <b>duodenal</b> ulcer. Excessive alcohol consumption seen in alcoholics is a known risk factor for pneumonia.|$|E
25|$|Persistent {{vomiting}} {{results in}} loss of stomach acid (hydrochloric acid). The vomited material {{does not contain}} bile because the pyloric obstruction prevents entry of <b>duodenal</b> contents (containing bile) into the stomach. The chloride loss results in a low blood chloride level which impairs the kidney's ability to excrete bicarbonate. This is the significant factor that prevents correction of the alkalosis.|$|E
25|$|Locoregional {{complications}} include {{pancreatic pseudocyst}} (Most common, occurring {{in up to}} 25% of all cases) and phlegmon / abscess formation, splenic artery pseudoaneurysms, hemorrhage from erosions into splenic artery and vein, thrombosis of the splenic vein, superior mesenteric vein and portal veins (in descending order of frequency), <b>duodenal</b> obstruction, common bile duct obstruction, progression to chronic pancreatitis, pancreatic ascites, pleural effusion, pancreatic abscess, sterile/infected pancreatic necrosis.|$|E
25|$|Many {{drugs as}} tablets, capsules, or drops are taken orally. Administration methods {{directly}} into the stomach include those by gastric feeding tube or gastrostomy. Substances may also be placed into the small intestines, as with a <b>duodenal</b> feeding tube and enteral nutrition. Enteric coated tablets are designed to dissolve in the intestine, not the stomach, because the drug present in the tablet causes irritation in the stomach.|$|E
25|$|Monitoring {{involves}} {{the provision of}} outpatient colonoscopy, and occasionally upper gastric tract esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD, to search for premalignant gastric or <b>duodenal</b> tumors), typically once every 1–3 years, and/or a genetic blood test to definitively confirm or deny susceptibility. A small number of polyps can often be excised (removed) during the procedure, if found, but if there are more severe signs or numbers, in patient surgery may be required.|$|E
25|$|Antiproliferative {{actions on}} bone marrow and GI tissue: Due to the drug's {{preference}} for rapidly proliferating tissues, bone marrow depression (anemia, leukopenia, pancytopenia, or even rarely agranulocytosis) may occur. Aplastic anemia {{has also been}} seen. Bone marrow toxicity can be irreversible and may cause death, particularly in immunocompromised patients. GI toxicity may be severe or rarely fatal and consists of anorexia, abdominal bloating, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dry mouth, <b>duodenal</b> ulcer, GI hemorrhage, nausea, vomiting, and ulcerative colitis.|$|E
25|$|A major {{causative factor}} (60% of gastric {{and up to}} 50–75% of <b>duodenal</b> ulcers) is chronic {{inflammation}} due to Helicobacter pylori that colonizes the antral mucosa. The immune system is unable to clear the infection, despite the appearance of antibodies. Thus, the bacterium can cause a chronic active gastritis (type B gastritis). Gastrin stimulates the production of gastric acid by parietal cells. In H. pylori colonization responses to increased gastrin, the increase in acid {{can contribute to the}} erosion of the mucosa and therefore ulcer formation.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the precise}} {{shape and size}} of the stomach varies widely among {{different}} vertebrates, the relative positions of the oesophageal and <b>duodenal</b> openings remain relatively constant. As a result, the organ always curves somewhat to the left before curving back to meet the pyloric sphincter. However, lampreys, hagfishes, chimaeras, lungfishes, and some teleost fish have no stomach at all, with the oesophagus opening directly into the anus. These animals all consume diets that either require little storage of food, or no pre-digestion with gastric juices, or both.|$|E
25|$|Upper {{gastrointestinal}} bleeding {{is from a}} source between the pharynx and the ligament of Treitz. An upper source is characterised by hematemesis (vomiting up blood) and melena (tarry stool containing altered blood). About half of cases are due to peptic ulcer disease (gastric or <b>duodenal</b> ulcers). Esophageal inflammation and erosive disease are the next most common causes. In those with liver cirrhosis, 50–60% of bleeding is due to esophageal varices. Approximately half of those with peptic ulcers have an H. pylori infection. Other causes include Mallory-Weiss tears, cancer, and angiodysplasia.|$|E
25|$|Depending on {{the nature}} of the defect in the APC gene, and whether it is the full or {{attenuated}} form, familial polyposis may manifest as polyps in colon or in the <b>duodenal</b> tract, or in any combination of these. Therefore, an absence of polyps in, for example, the rectum, may not of itself be sufficient to confirm absence of polyps. It may be necessary to consider and visually examine other possible parts of the intestinal tract. Colonoscopy is preferred over sigmoidoscopy for this, as it provides better observation of the common right-side location of polyps.|$|E
25|$|After his resignation, Mannerheim bought Kirkniemi Manor in Lohja, {{intending}} {{to spend his}} retirement there. In June 1946, he underwent an operation for a perforated peptic ulcer, and in October of that year {{he was diagnosed with}} a <b>duodenal</b> ulcer. In early 1947, it was recommended that he should travel to the Valmont Sanatorium in Montreux, Switzerland, to recuperate and write his memoirs. Valmont was to be Mannerheim's main residence for the remainder of his life, although he regularly returned to Finland, and also visited Sweden, France and Italy.|$|E
