50|$|Microblading {{should be}} {{performed}} using aseptic technique, needles must always be sterile and single use, the technician must disinfect {{the area of the}} skin prior to the tattoo service and clinical grade single use associated equipment and consumables are highly recommended (hand piece, skin wipes and saline, micro-brushes, <b>dressing</b> <b>packs</b> etc.) preferably sterile. The most common complications and client dissatisfaction that results from any form of tattooing is misapplication of the pigment, pigment migration and color change. Serious complications are uncommon though it is important to stress that like all forms of tattooing risks associated with Microblading include the transmission of Blood Borne Pathogenic Organisms (e.g. HIV, Hepatitis C Virus) as well as short term or long terms reactions to pigment ingredients. Therefore, it is essential to check that the technician holds appropriate licenses and registrations for the provision of tattoo services as well as inquiring about the standard of training that has been attained by the technician.|$|E
40|$|Aim: To {{explore the}} current central venous {{dialysis}} catheter (CVDC) nursing care practices in Australia. Method: A survey of dialysis units in Australia. Results: 66 % return rate (48 / 73) Internal jugular {{is the main}} insertion site (75 %) and the majority are tunneled (85 %). Insertion was performed most commonly by radiologists (34 %) followed by intensivists (24 %) with one center reporting insertion by nursing staff. CVDCs were most commonly inserted in radiology (54 %), followed by theatre (33 %). Dressings were attended weekly (55 %) or on dialysis days (45 %). Chlorhexidine was the antiseptic solution of choice (54 %) followed by povidine-iodine (37 %). In 21 % of centres Mupirocin was routinely applied {{in addition to the}} antiseptic solution. Transparent dressings were overwhelmingly favoured however most centres recommended alternatives related to patient need. 21 % of units reported enrolled nurses undertaking dressings. All units reported the use of sterile gloves and sterile <b>dressing</b> <b>packs.</b> 10 % reported different routine care for tunneled and non-tunneled. 40 % of the units collected data on infection rates per catheter days. General opinion (39 %) was identified as the reason to base CVDC protocols while descriptive studies (25 %), RCTs (23 %) and guidelines (18 %) were also reported. Conclusion: There are significant variations in the Australian nursing practice related to the care of CVDCs. Although there is still practice based on general opinion there is evidence that changes in practice in the past 8 years may be associated with knowledge derived from research. <br /...|$|E
40|$|Background: Postoperative {{wound healing}} {{has been a}} problem which causes high {{mortality}} in the developing world; postoperative wound has been reported to cause devastating consequences and a measurable mortality. The objective {{of the study was to}} assess nursing practice on postoperative wound care in surgical wards at Muhimbili National Hospital. Methodology: A quantitative descriptive cross-sectional design was employed. Data was collected using a checklist from a convenient sample of 71 nurses in surgical wards at Muhimbili National Hospital. The study was approved by the ethical committee of Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences and permission to conduct the study was granted by Muhimbili National Hospital. Data was analyzed using SPSS program version 19. Results were summarized using frequencies, percentages, and presented using figures, tables and text. Results The result shows that majority of the participants were female 76. 5 % and 40. 8 % of the participants aged 25 – 34 years. More than half of the participants were observed to have poor post operative wound care practice 57. 7 %. Male participants scored higher, and had better practice compared to female however there was no significant difference between the scores (P= 0. 803). In the preparation phase, hand washing before and after the procedure was observed by less than half of the participants 49. 3 %. None of the participants ensured cleanliness of the environment and patient’s privacy by screening or closing the room. The study findings revealed that nurses use clean gloves when removing the old dressing 99 %, while use of sterile gloves during wound dressing was not observed by 63 % of participants. Good practice was observed in applying dressing solution as prescribed 85 % participants, dry sterile dressing applied 90 %, arrangement of dressing forceps and other items by order to their application using forceps 20 %, usage of forceps to dip gauze into antiseptic solution 35 % and cleaning of the wound from least contaminated to most contaminated area 34 %. Post-operative counseling and instructing the patient not to temper with the wound was done by only 15 % of the participants. None of the participant documented wound changes, reported patient comfort, and recorded date or time after the procedure. Conclusion Majority of the participants in surgical wards do not follow the postoperative wound care checklist provided by MNH although they know its importance. Assessment of the wound and documentation continues to be a problem in the nursing profession. Participants were reasonably knowledgeable about the principal of wound dressing; however lack of knowledge on some of the key principles of wound dressing is worth noting. Almost half of the participants did not wash hands before and after the procedures, they did not use single gauze in one direction only, nor cleaned from least contaminated to most contaminated area, which can lead to wound contamination. Recommendation Ministry of health and social welfare should ensure that nurses are more trained at least to undergraduate level of nursing education. This can be achieved by providing more learning opportunities to nurses accompanied by sponsorships from the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare and sophisticated access to loan from Higher Education Loan Board (HELBS) Muhimbili National Hospital should recruits adequate number of nurses to cope with workload and number of patients. Adequate number of nurses will enable nurses to have more time to prepare equipments and to assess, plan, implement and evaluate care of patients with wound. Ministry of health and social welfare should also ensure that nurses caring for patients with wounds have refresher course to update them on issues of personal and patient protection from infection through infection control and prevention seminars. Increase economic power of the MNH to purchase items to ensure adequate supply of dressing materials including <b>dressing</b> <b>packs,</b> toothed forceps, cotton swabs, gauze, kidney dishes, dressing towels, artery forceps, eusol solution and Hydrogen peroxide solution, normal saline and Spirit...|$|E

30|$|Current {{clinical}} {{studies have demonstrated}} that cryotherapy after knee surgery may significantly bring immediate benefits by decreasing pain and edema during inflammatory response after surgery, reducing muscle spasm, and promoting knee function recovery; thereby accelerating postoperative rehabilitation and the ability of patients to return to routine activities. To the best of our knowledge, cold <b>dressing,</b> cold <b>packs,</b> crushed ice bags and cooling pads have been used as common and traditional methods. With the development of cryotherapy techniques, CCD could simultaneously provide cold and compression to the knee surgery area; and this has become a routine in postoperative cryogenic nursing. Novel devices that generally comprise of specific cuffs, tubes and coolers make the operation simpler, maintain low temperatures for longer periods, and are more appropriate to the operation area. Compared with traditional cryotherapy, CCD brings not only pressurized therapy, but also extra cost. Therefore, better effectiveness for postoperative management may become the crucial factor for its application. For CCD, it remains undetermined whether compression or cryotherapy could actually reduce pain and swelling (Martimbianco et al. 2014). However, the limited evidence currently available from randomized trials is insufficient to draw certain conclusions on the comparison of CC and CA, in terms of the effectiveness of pain and swelling.|$|R
