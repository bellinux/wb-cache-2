Still, she was aware that she was being watched constantly. Maria and her sister Anastasia burned their letters and diaries in April 1918 because they feared their possessions would be searched.|$|E

Spears {{will go down in}} history books, but not for anything she’s created, besides a world-class stir". She named [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] "the song that defined her legacy" [...] and also added: [...] "In less than five minutes, it contains an emotional storm that is both widely public and deeply personal. <b>If</b> <b>only</b> <b>she</b> had continued to prove worthy of that heroic task." [...] Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times said that [...] "Listening to her hits all at once, you may be struck by the seductive severity of Ms. Spears's music: the beats are sharp as tines, the lyrics are filled with evocations of fear and control, the voice projects nothing you might mistake for warmth".|$|E
500|$|Title {{garnered}} {{mixed reviews}} from contemporary music critics. Rolling Stone writer Jon Dolan observed, [...] ", the EP hooks similar trickle-down Beyoncé empowerment themes to sugary doo-wop and girl-group melodies." [...] AllMusic's Matt Collar lauded Trainor's vocal ability as [...] "soulful" [...] and [...] "highly resonant" [...] on the record. Christina Garibaldi of MTV News {{felt that the}} title track showcased Trainor's [...] "impressive" [...] rapping skills. Stereogum's Chris DeVille wrote, [...] "Title suggests she might {{have a shot at}} outlasting 'All About That Bass' <b>if</b> <b>only</b> <b>she</b> finds some new subject matter to sing about." [...] DeVille, however, commended the EP's production, opining, [...] " [...] how to craft a hit, both in terms of punchy major-key music and cheeky, meme-able lyrical turns," [...] and went on to conclude that Trainor is a [...] "very capable singer" [...] and is able to [...] "project lots of character and emotion within a relatively limited range". In a mixed review, a writer for the Knoxville News Sentinel commented, [...] "After 'Bass,' Title loses its element of surprise and leaves even appreciative listeners to wonder what else Trainor's got to offer".|$|E

We show that, an investor has higher cautiousness (i) <b>if</b> and <b>only</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> is always more likely to buy the option; and (ii) <b>if</b> and <b>only</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> always demands more options per share. As an option’s payoff is a convex function, increasing positions in the option increases the convexity of a portfolio, which leads {{to an increase in}} skewness.

500|$|She summoned {{church leaders}} {{from both sides}} to attempt to solve their doctrinal differences. Despite her optimism, the {{resulting}} Colloquy of Poissy ended in failure on 13 October 1561, dissolving itself without her permission. Catherine failed because she saw the religious divide only in political terms. In the words of historian R. J. Knecht, [...] "she underestimated the strength of religious conviction, imagining that all would be well <b>if</b> <b>only</b> <b>she</b> could get the party leaders to agree". In January 1562, Catherine issued the tolerant Edict of Saint-Germain in a further attempt to build bridges with the Protestants. On 1 March 1562, however, in an incident known as the Massacre of Vassy, the Duke of Guise and his men attacked worshipping Huguenots in a barn at Vassy (Wassy), killing 74 and wounding 104. Guise, who called the massacre [...] "a regrettable accident", was cheered as a hero {{in the streets of}} Paris while the Huguenots called for revenge. The massacre lit the fuse that sparked the French Wars of Religion. For the next thirty years, France found itself in a state of either civil war or armed truce.|$|E
500|$|The album {{garnered}} mainly positive {{reviews from}} critics. Sarah Bardeen of Rhapsody said the album established Queen as [...] "the voice for women", complimenting her [...] "self-assured delivery". She {{claimed that the}} tracks in which featured guest artists [...] "get {{the sense that the}} guys she's trading verses with are {{trying to keep up with}} her and not the other way around," [...] noting that the platinum edition [...] "launched the monster hit [...] "Quiero Bailar". Rachel Devitt, also writing for Rhapsody, categorized the album as [...] "Urban Latin" [...] music. Michael Endelman of Entertainment Weekly called the album their number one pick for crossover success in the United States while complimenting the [...] "catchy hooks and sticky grooves" [...] found on the album. Kalefa Sanneh of The New York Times said [...] " [...] celebrates her hybrid genre by refusing to stay put", while claiming Queen to sometimes depart from [...] "reggaeton's sharp, steady shuffle to explore other rhythms". She later said that the album would make Queen a [...] "likely candidate for crossover success, <b>if</b> <b>only</b> <b>she</b> didn't sing in Spanish". An editor for the Chicago Tribune selected the album as one of three to [...] "add to your reggaetón collection" [...] other than Daddy Yankee's Barrio Fino (2004). The writer noted the included hits ("Quiero Bailar" [...] and [...] "Papi Te Quiero"), along with [...] " [...] handful of remixes–and a whole lot of attitude". The album was highly anticipated and acclaimed and widely regarded as a factor in reggaeton's mainstream exposure in 2004 along with her next studio album Real (2004), Daddy Yankee's Barrio Fino and Tego Calderon's El Enemy de los Guasíbiri (2004), after being certified Platinum in the Latin field signifying sales of over 100,000 by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Jonathan Widran of Allmusic described [...] "Quiero Bailar" [...] as a song that [...] "gets the party and people moving" [...] and as well as being one of Queen's hits. Kid Curry, of Rhythmic Top 40 WPOW (Power 96) cites Ivy Queen's release of [...] "Yo Quiero Bailar" [...] as [...] "the last reggaetón super-hit". [...] "Papi Te Quiero" [...] was selected as one of the hits from [...] "The Golden Era of Reggaetón" [...] which lasted from 2003 until 2007 by Jesus Trivino of Latina magazine. The album was nominated for [...] "Reggaeton Album of the Year" [...] at the 2005 Billboard Latin Music Awards where she was also nominated for [...] "Tropical Airplay Track of the Year, Female" [...] and [...] "Tropical Airplay Track of the Year, New Artist".|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We propose an {{economic}} approach to Sybil attack detection. In our Informant protocol, a detective offers {{a reward for}} Sybils to reveal themselves. The detective accepts from one identity a security deposit {{and the name of}} target peer; the deposit and a reward are given to the target. We prove the optimal strategy for the informant is to play the game <b>if</b> and <b>only</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> is Sybil with a low opportunity cost, and the target will cooperate <b>if</b> and <b>only</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> is identical to the informant. Informant uses a Dutch auction to find the minimum possible reward that will reveal a Sybil attacker. Because our approach is economic, it is not limited to a specific application and does not rely on a physical device or token. ...|$|R
