5|$|In {{an article}} {{published}} in the newspaper Fremover (Narvik, Norway), in May 1994, the English aviation engineer Hugh Tyrer stated that the cause of the accident was probably due to fatigue in the end piece of the transfer mechanism to the elevator. The end piece was in such a state that it would have failed sooner or later in ordinary use. Following this discovery in the wreck, Widerøe had grounded all their Twin Otters and checked these pieces, but without finding any other defect parts. de Havilland Canada had also sent an alert to all operators of the Twin Otter to check the component, and had canceled the contract with the subcontractor. On 800 operating Twin Otters, 86 <b>end</b> <b>pieces</b> were replaced shortly after the accident, although none had fatigue similar to that of LN-BNS. The commission's chair, Ragnar Rygnestad, stated that they had not considered the end piece {{to be part of the}} cause of the accident, and that they therefore had not stress-tested it or the elevator to see what forces were needed to cause a crack. Rygnestad stated that the board knew about the fatigue. He also said that he had no problems with the opening of a new inquiry. Widerøe stated that they trusted the report from the Accident Investigation Board.|$|E
5|$|Member of parliament, Inge Myrvoll, and {{president}} of the Norwegian Airline Pilots Association, Cpt.Peter Helland, both stated that the Accident Investigation Board should make a new inquiry about the accident. Cpt. Helland stated that the report's credibility was weakened due to the influence de Havilland Canada had during the process. On 10 June, the commission reopened the case, after having held meetings with Tyrer. The commission stated that there was disagreement as to if the tail rudder and tail plane or the end piece had cracked first, which would be crucial in determining the cause of the accident. Among the inquiries would be to re-investigate the tape of cockpit sound with new technology. The Accident Investigation Board used the National Aerospace Laboratory in the Netherlands to conduct tests on the <b>end</b> <b>pieces.</b> The report from the National Aerospace Laboratory was published on 23 March 1995, and supported the conclusion in the commissions report. The journalist Oddvar Kristoffersen in Fremover won the SKUP Award for 1994 for his work related to uncovering the controversy. The pilots' union in Widerøe was initially critical of the report, but by July it stated that it supported the conclusion. In addition, Det Norske Veritas withdrew its critical comments concerning the commission. With this, all officially involved parties supported the report.|$|E

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} on the fluid dynamic characteristics of the bottom <b>end</b> <b>piece</b> of a nuclear fuel assembly. A commercial CFD code was used to simulate water flows through perforated plates in a square duct to evaluate both turbulence models and mesh refinement. Perforated plates with different diameter holes and one similar to the plate of the bottom <b>end</b> <b>piece</b> were simulated. The numerical results with the optimized mesh and SST k-ω turbulence model showed a good agreement when compared with a conventional methodology (Idelchik). With the same mesh criteria and the SST k-ω turbulence model were accomplished simulations in a standard bottom <b>end</b> <b>piece,</b> with some geometric simplifications. Experiments were also carried out to determine the pressure drop through the bottom <b>end</b> <b>piece.</b> The agreement between the numerical simulations and experimental results can be considered satisfactory but suggests further numerical investigations with bottom piece under real conditions of the experiment, without the geometric simplifications and with a gap between the piece and the wall of the flow channel. Additionally, other turbulence models should be appraised for this complex geometry.

6000|$|If I {{now take}} the fourth ring I find {{it has the}} same structure, and so have the fifth and the second; so that, in each of these {{divisions}} of the tail, I find parts which correspond with one another, a ring and two appendages; and in each appendage a stalk and two <b>end</b> <b>pieces.</b> These corresponding parts are called, in the technical language of anatomy, [...] "homologous parts." [...] The ring of the third division is the [...] "homologue" [...] of the ring of the fifth, the appendage of the former is the homologue of the appendage of the latter. And, as each division exhibits corresponding parts in corresponding places, we say that all the divisions are constructed upon the same plan. But now let us consider the sixth division. It is similar to, and yet different from, the others. The ring is essentially the same as in the other divisions; but the appendages look at first as if they were very different; and yet when we regard them closely, what do we find? A stalk and two terminal divisions, exactly as in the others, but the stalk is very short and very thick, the terminal divisions are very broad and flat, {{and one of them is}} divided into two pieces.|$|E
