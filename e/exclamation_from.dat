500|$|The song {{took its}} title from an <b>exclamation</b> <b>from</b> Lee Cohen, a Chicagoan {{friend of the}} band, at Brighton in May 1997. The band {{recorded}} [...] "Yes! I Am a Long Way from Home" [...] during the Mogwai Young Team sessions from July to August 1997 at MCM Studios in Hamilton, South Lanarkshire, Scotland, where the band had previously recorded {{the majority of their}} earlier material. The song was produced by Mogwai and Paul Savage, who handled production and mixing duties on the bulk of the band's previous recordings.|$|E
2500|$|During the World Trickshot Championship in 1991 Higgins {{demonstrated}} his seeming {{ignorance of}} how a professional snooker player should behave, when during his performance he described the black ball as [...] "Muhammad Ali" [...] {{in front of a}} live audience and TV cameras. [...] This caused a visibly pained expression from Barry Hearn and an <b>exclamation</b> <b>from</b> fellow judge Steve Davis that his score was already low now before the shot was even played.|$|E
2500|$|Each hero has {{a primary}} attack or skill {{and at least}} two {{additional}} skills that can be invoked at any time, some requiring a brief cooldown period before they can be used again. Furthermore, each player slowly builds up a meter towards their character's [...] "ultimate" [...] skill; this meter builds up over time but can build up faster for defeating opponents or performing other beneficial tasks for their team such as healing other team members. Once ready, the player can use this skill at any time which may last for a few seconds (such as increased attack strength or immunity to attacks) or be a single powerful action (such as resurrecting any recently-fallen team members), after which they then must wait for the meter to fill up again. Opposing players will be alerted to the use of this ultimate ability by an <b>exclamation</b> <b>from</b> the character, often in the character's native language; for example, gunslinger McCree will call out [...] "It's high noon" [...] as the player engages the ultimate ability to target multiple visible enemies and deal lethal damage to those still in sight. This gives opposing players a brief moment to try to take cover or respond appropriately.|$|E

60|$|Such {{were the}} <b>exclamations</b> <b>from</b> Dora, Grace and Nellie, as all rushed forward {{to where the}} boys were {{alighting}} from the Dartaway.

60|$|Presently, {{he passed}} a lonely house of some size, {{standing}} back from the road and surrounded by a high wall. As he did so, he heard a scream in a female voice, followed by angry <b>exclamations</b> <b>from</b> two male voices, while loudly rose a woman's cries for help.|$|R

60|$|He heard excited <b>exclamations</b> <b>from</b> the {{quarters}} of the soldiers and he heard men running in his direction.
