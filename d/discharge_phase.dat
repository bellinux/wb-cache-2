5000|$|During the <b>discharge</b> <b>phase,</b> molten {{elemental}} sodium at {{the core}} serves as the anode, meaning that the Na donates electrons to the external circuit. The sodium is separated by a beta-alumina solid electrolyte (BASE) cylinder from the container of molten sulfur, which is fabricated from an inert metal serving as the cathode. The sulfur is absorbed in a carbon sponge. BASE is a good conductor of sodium ions, but a poor conductor of electrons, and thus avoids self-discharge. When sodium gives off an electron, the Na+ ion migrates to the sulfur container. The electron drives an electric current through the molten sodium to the contact, through the electrical load {{and back to the}} sulfur container. Here, another electron reacts with sulfur to form Sn2−, sodium polysulfide. The discharge process can be represented as follows: ...|$|E

50|$|Most commonly, {{discharging}} {{is applied}} to planar graphs.Initially, a charge is assigned to each face and each vertex of the graph.The charges are assigned so that they sum to a small positive number. During the <b>Discharging</b> <b>Phase</b> the charge at each face or vertex may be redistributed to nearby faces and vertices, as required {{by a set of}} discharging rules. However, each discharging rule maintains the sum of the charges. The rules are designed so that after the <b>discharging</b> <b>phase</b> each face or vertex with positive charge lies in one of the desired subgraphs. Since the sum of the charges is positive, some face or vertex must have a positive charge. Many discharging arguments use one of a few standard initial charge functions (these are listed below). Successful application of the discharging method requires creative design of discharging rules.|$|R

40|$|The crystal {{structures}} of heat-treated electrolytic manganese dioxide (HEMD) and the discharge products are char-acterized by high-spatial-resolution convergent-beam electron diffraction (CBED) and lattice imaging. In this paper, CBED results {{are used to}} clarify the ambiguity in the x-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of these materials. The CBED results of HEMD used as the positive electrode material confirms that the major phase has the pyrolusite space group, P 4,/mnm, but {{with a range of}} c/a ratios. The experimentally observed variability of the lattice parameters from grain to grain is found to coincide with broadening on the low-angle sides of the XRD peaks. Both XRD and CBED analyses indi-cate that the unit cell volume of the pyrolusite-type phase increases during discharge, which is consistent with previous work by Ohzuku et al. CBED patterns of the discharge products suggest that a second <b>discharge</b> <b>phase</b> is formed by a topotactic phase transformation during discharge and has a specific orientation relationship with the expanded pyro-lusite-type phase.

The ignition delay time behind a reflected shock wave was measured with and without the discharge. It was shown that the initiation of the discharge with a specific deposited energy of 10  30 mJ/cm 3 leads to {{an order of magnitude}} decrease in the ignition delay time.
