From this moment we stand between you and her, as we stand between her and the world. Are you ready to see her grow up away from you, losing even the little recollection she has had of your kindness--passing you in the street without knowing you, perhaps even having you pointed out to her as a person she should avoid? Are you prepared to shut your eyes and ears henceforth to all that you may hear of her new life, when she is happy, rich, respectable, a courted heiress--perhaps the wife of some great man? Are you ready to accept that she will never know--that no one will ever know--that you had any share in making her so, and that if you should ever breathe it abroad we shall hold it our duty to deny it, and brand the man who takes it up for you as a liar and the slanderer of an honest girl?" ...|$|E

5000|$|Sonnet 11 {{begins with}} calling out the Youth on his slow decline in beauty. To paraphrased {{the first two}} lines, [...] "As fast as you decline in beauty, so <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>child</b> you grow into that beauty which you {{yourself}} leave behind". This is also {{the beginning of the}} speaker's push for the Youth to have a child within this particular sonnet. William Rolfe takes these same two lines and rolls out a thicker interpretation. He explains that having children explored how no matter how fast a person increases in age; the youth the young man has lost will be placed into his offspring. Rolfe ends his description by saying, [...] "As it were, growing afresh that which thou departest (to depart) from". This verse truly sets the stage for what the speaker wishes to convey most to the fair youth. Katherine Duncan-Jones expands that by paraphrasing the speaker's meaning behind line 3, saying, [...] "You give your blood (semen) to a wife while you are young, and, perhaps, in a youthful manner". The speaker has found every way to push at the idea of the Fair Youth marrying and having children.|$|E

40|$|A child {{protective}} services (CPS) worker {{knocks on the door}} of your client, a 36 -year-old mother involved in a contentious child custody case. The worker reveals only that she received an anonymous phone call alleging that your client physically abused her son and now she must investigate those allegations under state law. The worker demands to enter the house, interview the children, and inspect the premises. She threatens that a lack of cooperation may result in the filing of a court petition and the possible removal of the child. Your panicked client calls with a plethora of questions: Can CPS do this? Why can 2 ̆ 7 t I find out who is making these allegations against me? Can CPS really remove my child from the home? What are my rights? The questions continue. Am I entitled to a court-appointed attorney? Will I get to visit my child if he 2 ̆ 7 s placed in foster care? Can he go live with my mother? A traumatic situation, indeed. Your client will undoubtedly look to you for guidance to resolve these issues. As a practicing domestic relations attorney, you feel helpless. Your knowledge of civil child protection cases is limited and extends only to the occasional story that appears in the media. Although you do not represent this mother in the child abuse and neglect matter, you 2 ̆ 7 d like to provide her with some helpful information to resolve the situation favorably.

40|$|Do {{the young}} need more {{discipline}} {{to help them}} through life? Spiritually speaking discipline is an internal quality. Discipline {{is an act of}} unconditional love. For children it is our love and care that carries them towards adulthood. A spiritually centred relationship is a powerful tool for parents and teachers to expand meaning {{in the lives of the}} children. The home is the foundation for the ethical development of the whole child. In this sense the school needs to be an extension of the home that generates possibilities for safe self expression. Children, who are always learning, learn everything through their environment. Discipline is internalised through offering children clear choices and outlining clear consequences. It should never be punitive. The maxim "Discipline should never exceed the amount of love" is worth remembering. Avoid emotional coercion and reject it when you meet it <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>child.</b> Emotional blackmail is never a good way to get one's way. Remember that: Bad behaviour is always a cry for help; bad behavioural habits are learnt; the child is not the behaviour; the hallmarks of discipline in a classroom and at home are essentially the same. A safe and happy child needs little intervention. Choices should be limited yet challenging. Consequences need to be clear, simple and just. Relationship is the foundation of good discipline. Good self-esteem builds good behaviour. Do not use put downs in discipline - the child is NOT the behaviour. Love is the foundation of relationship and successful discipline. Consistency is also the key to discipline. Be consistent but also flexible - justice is not blind but needs to be responsive Honesty and open communications at all time - admit it when you make a mistake. Respect and honour your children - never talk down...|$|E
