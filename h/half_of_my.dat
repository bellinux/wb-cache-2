2500|$|In November 2009 Alkaline Trio {{announced}} {{the formation of}} their own independent record label, created as {{a joint venture with}} Epitaph Records {{in a manner similar to}} ANTI- and Hellcat Records. Epitaph had previously released Patent Pending, the 2006 album by Skiba's side project Heavens. Named Heart & Skull after Alkaline Trio's logo, the new label would be inaugurated by the release of their new album. Skiba remarked that [...] "We made the decision to form Heart & Skull to put out our own records after having been through every kind of label deal in the industry, big indies, small indies, majors. We knew it was time to adapt to the shifting tides of the music industry and we could not be more thrilled about doing that in conjunction with the team at Epitaph." [...] Singer and bassist Dan Andriano added: [...] "For our band at this time it really makes sense to release our own records, but we wanted to make sure we could partner up with good people who we would want to share in something very special to us. When Brett [...] called and said he wanted to be involved, that was it. Epitaph is a label I've admired and supported for more than <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> life." ...|$|E
