25|$|The newer concentric-float {{fill valve}} {{consists}} of a tower which is encircled by a plastic <b>float</b> <b>assembly.</b> Operation is otherwise {{the same as a}} side-float fill valve, even though the float position is somewhat different. By virtue of its more compact layout, interference between the float and other obstacles (tank insulation, flush valve, and so on) is greatly reduced, thus increasing reliability. The concentric-float fill valve is also designed to signal to users automatically when there is a leak in the tank, by making much more noise when a leak is present than the older style side-float fill valve, which tends to be nearly silent when a slow leak is present.|$|E
50|$|In a rate {{indicating}} gyroscope, the gyroscope {{is turned}} {{at a steady}} rate about its input axis and a torque {{is applied to the}} spin axis. This causes the gyroscope to precess about the output axis.The rate indicating gyroscope consists of a damping fluid between the <b>float</b> <b>assembly</b> can and the outer casing. This viscous fluid resists the motion of the gimbal precession. This causes the gimbal to accelerate initially in the fluid, until the damping effect is equal to the precessing force.The rate of precession, will hence be directly proportional to the rate of turn of the gyroscope about its input axis and the total angle of movement about the output axis will be proportional to the speed and length of time the input axis is turning.|$|E

It is indicative of the esteem in which Patrick was held that he, a non-German, was offered a place. The balloon was equipped against every eventuality and stocked with rations for 20 days. The balloon took off on 27 September, just before 6 pm. The same evening, their trailing rope became stuck in trees and gusty winds caused the crew to lose control. In the dark it was decided to release the gas and land the balloon. The ambitious expedition ended just 20 km from the start.|$|R
40|$|Release modules of {{amoxicillin}} and clarithromycin {{combined in}} a single dosage form designed to float in the gastric content and to sustain the intra-gastric concentrations of these two antibiotics used for the eradication of Helicobacter pylori have been studied. The modules having a disc shape with curved bases were formulated as hydrophilic matrices. Two modules of clarithromycin were assembled by sticking the concave base of one module to the concave base of the other, creating an internal void chamber. The final dosage form was a <b>floating</b> <b>assembly</b> of three modules of clarithromycin and two of amoxicillin in which the drug release mechanism did {{not interfere with the}} floatation mechanism. The assembled system showed immediate in vitro floatation at pH 1. 2, lasting 5 h. The in vitro antibiotics release profiles from individual modules and assembled systems exhibited linear release rate during buoyancy for at least 8 h. The predicted antibiotic concentrations in the stomach maintained for long time levels significantly higher than the respective minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC). In addition, an in vivo absorption study performed on beagle dogs confirmed the slow release of clarithromycin and amoxicillin from the assembled system during the assembly's permanence in the stomach for at least 4 h...|$|R

The simulation of floating electrical potential distribution on the micro-electrode chip is performed by COMSOL software, and the simulation result shows that the coupled electrical potential on the floating drain electrodes {{is very close to}} the original electrical potential applied on the gate electrode, which means that the method can provide di-electrophoresis (DEP) force for all the electrode pairs at one time, thus realizing large-scale assembly at one time. With Cu/CuO nanowires well dispersed and micro-electrode chip fabrication, nanowires assembly experiments are performed and the experimental results show that Cu/CuO nanowires are assembled at hundreds of micro-electrodes pairs at one time, and the success rate of nanowires assembly also reaches 90 %. © 2014 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|R
60|$|The {{assembled}} spectators {{of almost}} all degrees, whose minds had been wound up to the pitch which we have described, uttered a groan, or rather a roar of indignation and disappointed revenge, {{similar to that of}} a tiger from whom his meal has been rent by his keeper when he was just about to devour it. This fierce exclamation seemed to forbode some immediate explosion of popular resentment, and, in fact, such had been expected by the magistrates, and the necessary measures had been taken to repress it. But the shout was not repeated, nor did any sudden tumult ensue, such as it appeared to announce. The populace seemed to be ashamed of having expressed their disappointment in a vain clamour, and the sound changed, not into the silence which had preceded the arrival of these stunning news, but into stifled mutterings, which each group maintained among themselves, and which were blended into one deep and hoarse murmur which <b>floated</b> above the <b>assembly.</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{report a}} simple, versatile, and rapid method for the {{fabrication}} of optically-transparent large-area carbon nanotube (CNT) films via flotation assembly. After solvent-induced <b>assembly,</b> <b>floating</b> films {{were transferred to}} a flat supporting substrate to form conductive and transparent CNT film electrodes. The resulting electrodes, with uniform 40 ± 20 nm multi-walled CNT (MWCNT) layers, were characterized by electrochemical and microscopy methods. The flotation method does not require specialized thin-film instrumentation and avoids the need for surfactants and pre-oxidized CNTs which can hamper electrochemical performance. A proof-of-concept nanostructured bioelectrode demonstrating high sensitivity for glucose was developed with an electropolymerized poly(pyrene-adamantane) layer for host–guest immobilization of active β-cyclodextrin tagged GOx enzymes. The polymer provides pyrene groups for cross-linking to CNTs and pendant adamantane groups for binding the β-cyclodextrin groups of the tagged enzyme. This demonstration offers a new approach for the preparation of stable and transparent CNT film electrodes with attractive electrochemical properties towards future photobio- and bio-electrochemical fuel cells, electrochemical sensors, and electroanalysis...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Intracortical microprobes {{allow the}} precise {{monitoring}} of electrical and chemical signaling and {{are widely used}} in neuroscience. Microelectromechanical system (MEMS) technologies have greatly enhanced the integration of multifunctional probes by facilitating the combination of multiple recording electrodes and drug delivery channels in a single probe. Depending on the neuroscientific application, various assembly strategies are required {{in addition to the}} microprobe fabrication itself. This paper summarizes recent advances in the fabrication and assembly of micromachined silicon probes for drug delivery achieved within the EU-funded research project NeuroProbes. The described fabrication process combines a two-wafer silicon bonding process with deep reactive ion etching, wafer grinding, and thin film patterning and offers a maximum in design flexibility. By applying this process, three general comb-like microprobe designs featuring up to four 8 -mm-long shafts, cross sections from 150 × 200 to 250 × 250 µm², and different electrode and fluidic channel configurations are realized. Furthermore, we discuss the development and application of different probe assemblies for acute, semichronic, and chronic applications, including comb and array <b>assemblies,</b> <b>floating</b> microprobe arrays, as well as the complete drug delivery system NeuroMedicator for small animal research. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Neutronic {{studies of}} 18 -pin and 36 -pin {{stringer}} fuel assemblies {{have been performed}} to ascertain that core design requirements for the liquid-salt cooled Very High Temperature Reactor (LS-VHTR) can be met. The stringer assemblies are being considered to eliminate the possibility of fuel <b>assemblies</b> <b>floating</b> in the liquid salt coolant. The design also allows the fuel and graphite moderator to be replaced at different time intervals in the core. Parametric studies were performed to determine core characteristics required to achieve a target core cycle length of 18 months and fuel discharge burnup greater than 100 GWd/t under the constraint that the uranium enrichment be less than 20 % to support non-proliferation goals. The effects of changing fuel enrichment, number of fuel pins per assembly, packing fraction of the microstructures in the fuel, {{and the number of}} batches per burnup cycle were calculated. In addition, these calculations provided insight into several physics characteristics of the core, including the sensitivity of the new assembly designs to the fuel-to-moderator ratio, and the spectral differences resulting from the stringer design. The results show that the design goals can be met using a 1 -batch fuel management scheme, uranium enrichment of 15 % and a fuel packing fraction of 30 % or greater for the 36 -pin stringer fuel assembly design...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we show that}} passive {{self-assembly}} {{in the context of}} the tile self-assembly model is capable of performing fuel efficient, universal computation. The tile self-assembly model is a premiere model of self-assembly in which particles are modeled by four-sided squares with glue types assigned to each tile edge. The assembly process is driven by positive and negative force interactions between glue types, allowing for tile <b>assemblies</b> <b>floating</b> in the plane to combine and break apart over time. We refer to this type of assembly model as passive in that the constituent parts remain unchanged throughout the assembly process regardless of their interactions. A computationally universal system is said to be fuel efficient if the number of tiles used up per computation step is bounded by a constant. Work within this model has shown how fuel guzzling tile systems can perform universal computation with only positive strength glue interactions [32]. Recent work has introduced space-efficient, fuel-guzzling universal computation with the addition of negative glue interactions and the use of a powerful non-diagonal class of glue interactions [19]. Other recent work has shown how to achieve fuel efficient computation [27] within active tile self-assembly. In this paper we utilize negative interactions in the tile self-assembly model to achieve the first computationally universal passive tile self-assembly system that is both space and fuel-efficient. In addition, we achieve this result using a limited diagonal class of glue interactions...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of four papers, which treat the modelling of a spur gear set and a disc brake, and {{the interaction between the}} machine elements. Features of the performance are studied in relation to the initial stated assumptions. Initially, a method for analysing the influence of profile errors upon load-sharing capabilities and mesh stiffness of spur gears was proposed. The contacts between mating gear teeth were identified in the deformed state. In addition, artificial neural networks were employed for system identification. The discussion was focused upon the dependency between the contact ratio and the load in addition to the influence of profile and pitch errors. Experimental data validated the reliability of the approach. Following, a non-linear damping model for shaft torsional vibration studies was proposed and experimentally validated. The experiments showed that the internal shaft damping was highly non-linear. The damping tended to be not only stiffness related but also noticeably depended on the type of material. Friction induced noise due to the interaction of the mating teeth of a spur gear set was studied. For the shaft bearings, a non-linear damping model based upon the coefficient of restitution describing the interaction between the rolling elements and the inner- and outer race of the bearing was proposed. The non-linear support bearing model created a relation between the bearing stiffness in the path of contact of the mating teeth and the movement of the gears perpendicular to the path of contact. The presence of friction had its greatest effect upon the bearing force in the path of contact of the mating gear teeth at low angular velocities, and at mesh frequencies close to the natural frequency of the vibration perpendicular to the path of contact. Finally, the influence of the interaction between the disc of a <b>floating</b> disc brake <b>assembly</b> and connecting members was studied. In the initial process of the experimental research, high drag torque was acquired without applying force to the pads. The spline profile and the nave width were proven to have little effect upon drag, whilst the position on which the caliper was mounted had a considerable influence. Both the analytical study and the experimental measurements showed a strong correlation between the caliper position and the drag torque...|$|R
40|$|This study {{deals with}} the {{multi-stage}} forming process of a sling shackle, investigated {{with the use of}} finite element simulation. Used as a lifting connector during <b>Floating</b> Production Unit <b>assembly</b> and provision of supplies for petroleum platforms, Wide Body (WB) shackles endure severe working conditions in hostile environment. Providing high level of strength and toughness as well as outstanding fatigue behavior, hot forming {{is one of the main}} production method of shackles. Aiming towards process improvement and stronger shackles development, the main purpose of this study is, with the help of numerical simulation, to understand, predict and control all aspects that can be involved in the manufacturing of a WB 125 tons shackle. In close collaboration with forging industry Le Béon Manufacturing in Lorient area, forging experiments were carried out on a 0. 3 MJ friction drive screw press and at temperatures higher than 900 °C. In order to form both jaws, two successive sequences of closed-die forging and deflashing are performed. It follows an open-die forging stage to form the body. Finally, the crown is obtained using a ram bending process. The numerical model presented herein is developed using a fully coupled 3 D thermomechanical analysis and is conducted on Abaqus software. Tools are made of AISI H 13 with constant thermophysical properties. Mechanical properties of the 34 CrNiMo 6 used for the workpiece at temperatures ranging from 900 to 1200 °C and strain rates ranging from 0. 1 to 1 /s were extracted from the literature. To describe the compression behavior, the Johnson-Cook flow stress model has been used. Temperatures, duration and kinematic movements have been recorded over the production of 80 shackles, and forging loads were evaluated by instrumenting strain gauges directly on the mechanical press. A particular methodology has been developed to perform successively the numerical simulation of the various forming operations with a unique workpiece. It combines a sequence of Abaqus/Implicit-HT, Abaqus/Dynamic-Explicit and Abaqus/Static-Implicit. In all simulations, convective and radiative cooling is taken into account and heat transfer between the tools and the workpiece is considered. As in the industrial process, workpiece stability and forging accuracy are obtained with the use of a manipulator modeled as an analytical rigid surface and a combination of springs to account for the recoil and shock absorption. A remeshing method has also been developed to thwart excessive distortion in the flash and the body...|$|R
