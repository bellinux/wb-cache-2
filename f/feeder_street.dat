50|$|Military Road {{assumed a}} growing {{importance}} in the regional transportation system in the 1930s and 1940s. In August 1931, Arlington County and the U.S. Army agreed to end a dispute over who should continue to maintain the road, with the county taking responsibility for the road itself and the military assuming authority over connections and on/off ramps to nearby military facitilies like Fort Myer and Arlington National Cemetery. One of the first traffic lights on Military Road was installed at the street's intersection with Wilson Boulevard in August 1934. In 1937, the federal government offered to sell Military Road to Arlington County for $1, but the county turned down the offer. The usefulness of the southern leg of Military Road from the 14th Street Bridge to Arlington Boulevard declined in the late 1930s. Although it once served as a major <b>feeder</b> <b>street</b> to traffic crossing the 14th Street Bridge, Military Road was severed from this road network in 1939. In 1941, much of Military Road {{in the vicinity of the}} 14th Street Bridge was obliterated by construction of The Pentagon.|$|E

In the early 20th century, trams provided a new means of transport between Nottingham, Ripley and Heanor. Lawrence lived next to the line, and described it as the most dangerous tram service in England.|$|R
40|$|Large-scale {{renewable}} energy (RE) {{integration into the}} distribution network (DN) causes uncertainties due to its intermittent nature and is a challenging task today. In general RE sources are mostly connected near the end user level, i. e., in the low voltage distribution network. RE integration introduces bidirectional power flows across distribution transformer (DT) and hence DN experiences with several potential problems that includes voltage fluctuations, reactive power compensation and poor power factor in the DN. This study identifies the potential effects causes due to large-scale integration of RE into the Berserker <b>Street</b> <b>Feeder,</b> Frenchville Substation under Rockhampton DN. From the model analyses, it has clearly evident that voltage of the Berserker <b>Street</b> <b>Feeder</b> fluctuates with the increased integration of RE and causes uncertainties in the feeder {{as well as the}} DN...|$|R

40|$|Whether one {{considers}} it a personal problem or not, traffic congestion on Oahu is getting worse. The private automobile, the dominant {{mode of transportation}} in this rapidly growing urban area, requires more and more highways to accommodate it. This means less space available for offices in the Central Business District (CBD) as well as destruction of the natural environment. More highways mean more <b>feeder</b> <b>streets</b> and parking facilities where the trip terminates, usually at common points in the urban core. This tends to defeat the purpose of coming there at all: more space would be devoted for the trip over than for the purpose itself! The history of transportation on Oahu, where in 1970 over 80 {{percent of the state}} of Hawaii's population lived, (State, 1973 b) followed the same pattern as {{in the rest of the}} United States. The technological development of the automobile has had a great effect in destroying the mass transit industry. Passenger car registrations have grown from the turn of the century, dipping only during the Depression and World War II. (Schneider, 1965) In Hawaii, the car population is growing at a rate three times faster than our human population. (Cleaner Air Week, 1973) The dynamic growth of automobile usage has convinced many planners that the future city will be dominated by the automobile simply because people have an overwhelming desire to travel in their own cars...|$|R

50|$|The DC-8 {{missed the}} auto {{transport}} loading facility {{at the south}} end of the Miami City Rail Yard just north of the end of the runway, and also busy cargo operations facilities along the very busy NW 25th <b>Street</b> <b>feeder</b> to the airport's cargo area just to the south of the end of the runway.

At that time the mini-mall was a hub of computer parts distributors specializing in South American commerce.|$|R
40|$|As non-controllable and {{intermittent}} power sources, grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) {{systems can}} contribute to overvoltage in low voltage (LV) distribution feeders during periods of high solar generation and low load where there exists a possibility of reverse power flow. Overvoltage is usually prevented by conservatively limiting the penetration level of PV, even if these critical periods rarely occur. This is the current policy implemented in the Northern Territory, Australia, where a modest system limit of 4. 5 kW/house was imposed. This paper presents an active power curtailment (APC) strategy utilizing artificial neural networks techniques. The inverter active power is optimized to prevent any overvoltage conditions on the LV <b>feeder.</b> A residential <b>street</b> located in Alice Springs {{was identified as a}} case study for this paper. Simulation results demonstrated that overvoltage conditions can be eliminated and made to comply with the Australian Standards AS 60038 and AS 4777 by incorporating the proposed predictive APC control. In addition, the inverter downtime due to overvoltage trips was eliminated to further reduce the total power losses in the system...|$|R

40|$|A {{recent issue}} of {{increasing}} public focus {{is the need for}} robust, sustainable and climate friendly power systems that are intelligent, reliable and green. The intermittent nature of renewable energy generation and the associated power electronic inverters creates a number of potential challenges in integrating large-scale renewable energy (RE) into the grid that affects power quality of the distribution network. Therefore, this study initially, investigates the potential technical impacts in particular voltage regulation, active and reactive power variations, transformer loading and current and voltage harmonics causes with RE integration. Then, to reduce the level of impacts observed, STATCOM and energy storage system (both optimised) were integrated into the network that ensures a smooth power supply to the customers. As a case study, the Berserker <b>Street</b> <b>Feeder,</b> Frenchville Substation under Rockhampton distribution network, Central Queensland, Australia has been considered. Similar analyses also carried out with the IEEE 13 bus network to investigate the potential technical challenges of RE integration and identify suitable mitigation measures. Results shows that integration of both optimised STATCOM and energy storage enhances the overall power quality of the power network as it improves voltage regulation, power distribution, and transformer utilisation and reduce total harmonic distortion of the power network...|$|R
40|$|To improve mobility, Metropolitan Council has {{proposed}} a network of dedicated transitways in the 2030 Transportation Policy Plan. This project studied the profile of transit riders in the Twin Cities and explored environmental factors that influence mode choice of access to transitways, using the 2005 Metropolitan Council Transit Rider Survey. We found the Hiawatha Light Rail Transit (LRT) balances efficiency by serving choice riders and equity through promoting reverse commute and serving captive riders. The LRT has also facilitated {{the formation of a}} multi-modal transportation system by promoting mode mixing and encouraging transfers. More importantly, travel shed analysis of several transit routes showed the LRT has a much broader influence on the regional transportation network than local buses and express services. Multinomial Logit models for access mode of the LRT confirmed that riders’ demographics, trip characteristics, built environment and social environment factors around LRT stations affect their access modes. Among them, the distance from trip origin to LRT stations is the dominant factor; the impacts of built environment elements were equivalent to those of riders’ demographics and trip characteristics, whereas the effects of social environment factors were the weakest. The results suggest if the goal is to maximize the number accessing transitways from existing bus services, we should increase the coverage of <b>feeder</b> services, increase <b>street</b> connectivity and promote mixed-use development. If the goal is to attract choice riders in areas where walking and local transit are not options, more park and ride facilities should be provided...|$|R
