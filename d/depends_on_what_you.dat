5000|$|David Haglund and Forrest Wickman of Slate wrote, in a post titled [...] "How True is Pain & Gain?": [...] "In {{addition}} to the usual Hollywood streamlining and the amping up of certain scenes, the changes seem largely designed to make the central criminals more sympathetic.

60|$|I do not {{presume to}} throw the {{slightest}} doubt upon the accuracy {{of any of the}} calculations made by such distinguished mathematicians as those who have made the suggestions I have cited. On the contrary, it is necessary to my argument to assume that they are all correct. But I desire to point out that this seems {{to be one of the}} many cases in which the admitted accuracy of mathematical processes is allowed to throw a wholly inadmissible appearance of authority over the results obtained by them. Mathematics may be compared to a mill of exquisite workmanship, which grinds you stuff of any degree of fineness; but, nevertheless, what you get out <b>depends</b> <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> put in; and as the grandest mill in the world will not extract wheat-flour from peascods, so pages of formul√¶ will not get a definite result out of loose data.|$|E
6000|$|And {{one of them}} taking it, I {{am sorry}} to say, for a line of secular poetry, exclaimed at the {{stiffness}} and coldness. Pica then put in her oar, and began to argue that honour must be earned, {{and that it was}} absurd and illogical to claim it for the mere accident of seniority or relationship. Jane, not at all conscious of being an offender, howled at her that this was her horrible liberalism and neology, while Metelill asked what was become of loyalty. [...] "That <b>depends</b> <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> mean by it," [...] returned our girl graduate. [...] "LOI- AUTE, steadfastness to principle, is noble, but personal loyalty, to some mere puppet or the bush the crown hangs on, is a pernicious figment."

You may be in places where the commissariat breaks down altogether, and <b>you</b> have to <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> buy; you may be left behind wounded, or may be taken prisoner, one never can tell. I shall feel more {{comfortable}} about you if I {{know that you are}} well provided with cash, whatever may happen. My advice is, Terence, get fifteen or twenty pounds in gold sewn up in your boot; have an extra sole put on, and the money sewn inside. If it is your bad luck to be taken prisoner, you will find the money mighty useful in a great many ways." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; luxury. No {{man ever}} {{had a right to}} say more {{positively}} to a woman that it was her duty to marry him, than I have to you. And I do say it. I say it on behalf of all of us, that it is your duty. I won't talk of my own love now, because you know it. You cannot doubt it. I won't even talk of yours, because I am sure of it. But I say that it is your duty to give up drowning us all in tears, burying us in desolation. You are one of us, and should do as all of us wish you. If, indeed, you could not love me it would be different. There! I have said what I've got to say. You are crying, and I will not take your answer now. I will come to you again to-morrow, and then you shall answer me. But, remember when you do so that the happiness of many people <b>depends</b> <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> say."

60|$|She was as dead an {{old woman}} as ever I saw; no more than bone and parchment, curiously put together. Her eyes, with which she interrogated mine, were vacant of sense. It <b>depends</b> <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> call seeing, whether you might not call her blind. Perhaps she had known love: perhaps borne children, suckled them and given them pet names. But now that was all gone by, and had left her neither happier nor wiser; and the best she could do with her mornings was {{to come up here}} into the cold church and juggle for a slice of heaven. It was not without a gulp that I escaped into the streets and the keen morning air. Morning? why, how tired of it she would be before night! and if she did not sleep, how then? It is {{fortunate}} that not many of us are brought up publicly to justify our lives at the bar of threescore years and ten; fortunate that such a number are knocked opportunely on the head in what they call the flower of their years, and go away to suffer for their follies in private somewhere else. Otherwise, between sick children and discontented old folk, we might be put out of all conceit of life.|$|E
6000|$|... "Efficiency," [...] of course, is futile for {{the same}} reason that strong men, will-power and the superman are futile. That is, it is futile because it only deals with actions after they have been performed. It has no {{philosophy}} for incidents before they happen; therefore it has no power of choice. An act can only be successful or unsuccessful when it is over; if it is to begin, it must be, in the abstract, right or wrong. There is no such thing as backing a winner; for he cannot be a winner when he is backed. There is no such thing as fighting on the winning side; one fights to find out which is the winning side. If any operation has occurred, that operation was efficient. If a man is murdered, the murder was efficient. A tropical sun is as efficient in making people lazy as a Lancashire foreman bully in making them energetic. Maeterlinck is as efficient in filling a man with strange spiritual tremors as Messrs. Crosse and Blackwell are in filling a man with jam. But it all <b>depends</b> <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> want to be filled with. Lord Rosebery, being a modern skeptic, probably prefers the spiritual tremors. I, being an orthodox Christian, prefer the jam. But both are efficient when they have been effected; and inefficient until they are effected. A man who thinks much about success must be the drowsiest sentimentalist; for he must be always looking back. If he only likes victory he must always come late for the battle. For the man of action there is nothing but idealism.|$|E
