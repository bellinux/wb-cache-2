500|$|After Stafford left {{to become}} a <b>humanitarian</b> <b>worker,</b> over two hundred {{applicants}} {{signed up for a}} nationwide search to be her replacement. Griffin eventually narrowed the list to three finalists, which consisted of Summer Bartholomew, former Playboy centerfold Vicki McCarty, and Vanna White. Griffin gave each of the three women an opportunity to win the job by putting them in a rotation for several weeks after Stafford's departure. In December 1982, Griffin named White as Stafford's successor, saying that he felt she was capable of activating the puzzle board letters (which is the primary role of the Wheel hostess) better than anyone else who had auditioned. White became highly popular among the young female demographic, and also gained a fanbase of adults interested in her daily wardrobe, in a phenomenon that has been referred to as [...] "Vannamania". White remained on the daytime series {{for the rest of the}} time it was on the air.|$|E

30|$|There {{were few}} {{differences}} between development and <b>humanitarian</b> <b>workers.</b> <b>Humanitarian</b> <b>workers</b> identified more ‘Organisational’ stressors such as workload and bureaucracy. They {{were also more}} likely to cite ‘Unhelpful activities’ such as alcohol (supporting Costa et al. 2015). There were no differences between the two groups in terms of physical health and safety as a key stressor, despite the emergency nature of humanitarian work. This may be because <b>humanitarian</b> <b>workers</b> saw security issues as inherent to humanitarian work and thus were more able to accept these stressors (Crane et al. 2018). The results indicate that there are few differences between the development and <b>humanitarian</b> <b>workers</b> despite past research focusing predominantly on <b>humanitarian</b> <b>workers.</b>|$|R
30|$|Why did the <b>humanitarian</b> <b>workers</b> become {{targets of}} violence? The {{literature}} has been focusing on some approaches of explanation such as processes of politicization, militarization, or securitization of humanitarian action that emphasize external factors. From an alternative perspective, Larissa Fast’s Aid in Danger succeeds in contextualizing why the <b>humanitarian</b> <b>workers</b> became targets {{of violence in}} Iraq, Afghanistan, and Somalia; explores the competing narratives to interpret {{the underlying causes of}} violence against <b>humanitarian</b> <b>workers</b> and agencies; and reveals the internal vulnerabilities of <b>humanitarian</b> <b>workers</b> and agencies in high-stress environments and conflict zones.|$|R

30|$|According to the {{preliminary}} {{records of the}} Aid Worker Security Database, 270 <b>humanitarian</b> <b>workers</b> were killed, kidnapped, or seriously wounded in 2014. The majority of the <b>humanitarian</b> <b>workers</b> killed (67 out of 105) were victims of targeted attacks or crossfire while delivering assistance. Improvised explosive devices and complex attacks accounted for 20  % of <b>humanitarian</b> <b>workers</b> killed. Ninety percent of the victims (244 out of 270) were national staff, who account {{for the majority of}} <b>humanitarian</b> <b>workers</b> (United Nations 2015). Although this represents a decrease of roughly 30  % compared to 2013, it was “due mainly to reduced or reconfigured operational presence in these countries, with fewer <b>humanitarian</b> <b>workers</b> deployed to field locations deemed insecure” (Aid Worker Security Database 2015).|$|R
30|$|In history, <b>humanitarian</b> <b>workers</b> and {{agencies}} often {{work in the}} toughest situations.

30|$|Chapters 1 – 5 {{reveal that}} most of the <b>humanitarian</b> <b>workers</b> killed or injured were {{national}} staff. In such cases, Fast calls for a better accounting of the internal vulnerabilities of <b>humanitarian</b> <b>workers</b> and agencies. In the following pages (chapter 6 and conclusion) and parts of chapters 1 – 2, she analyzes the dynamics and mechanisms of protecting <b>humanitarian</b> <b>workers</b> and agencies, highlights analytical and practical challenges facing the humanitarian cause, and provides recommendations for reasserting humanity.|$|R

30|$|There {{remains a}} {{critical}} gap in understanding {{challenges faced by}} <b>humanitarian</b> <b>workers</b> who may be key in providing assistance during complex emergencies. This study examines self-reported views by <b>humanitarian</b> <b>workers</b> working in Palestine concerning three concepts: resilience, generalized self-efficacy, and importance of workplace empowerment. Aid workers in Palestine face unique obstacles placed on economic, social, and political autonomy imposed by Israeli policy. Data obtained from 46 <b>humanitarian</b> <b>workers</b> recruited using snowball sampling methodology hint at a complex relationship between the three concepts. Firstly, a hypothesized positive relationship between resiliency and generalized self-efficacy was supported. Secondly, an unexpected negative relationship was found between resiliency and workplace empowerment. Finally, counter to our hypothesis, no significant relationship was found between self-efficacy and workplace empowerment. Gender differences also highlight disparities between the experience {{of women and men}} in the non-profit workplace in Palestine. This study adds to our knowledge regarding unique stresses on <b>humanitarian</b> <b>workers</b> and enhances a growing base of literature focused on national staff and volunteers.|$|R
30|$|First, it criticizes {{humanitarian}} exceptionalism which separates <b>humanitarian</b> <b>workers</b> {{and agencies}} from the populations they assist and downplays “how individual or organizational actions might {{have played a}} role” (Fast 2014, p. 47). As Fast suggests, the existing literature shows little concern {{about the fact that}} <b>humanitarian</b> <b>workers</b> and agencies were attacked, while others were not. Second, it uncovers the evolution of violence against <b>humanitarian</b> <b>workers</b> and agencies. Third, Fast stresses the “context-generated threats,” which are caused by the humanitarian workers’ and agencies’ behaviors and lifestyle choices {{and the ways in which}} some aid agencies operate. In the eyes of Fast, <b>humanitarian</b> <b>workers</b> “represent all types of people” and make various responses to the high-risk working environments (Fast 2014, p. 137). In some cases, the humanitarian workers’ deviant behavior is considered as “immoral, unacceptable, or culturally insensitive’, creates tension in local communities, and ‘tarnish[es] the reputations of all expatriates in the eyes of the local community” (Fast 2014, p. 146).|$|R

50|$|While the Geneva Conventions {{guarantee}} {{protection for}} <b>humanitarian</b> <b>workers,</b> {{they do not}} guarantee access of <b>humanitarian</b> <b>workers</b> to affected areas: governments or occupying forces may, if they wish, ban a relief agency from working in their area.

40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} {{understand}} the phenomenon of attacks against <b>humanitarian</b> <b>workers</b> by asking: why are <b>humanitarian</b> <b>workers</b> attacked in some contexts, but not in others? By exploring the effects of deterrence as a security strategy, this thesis investigates the direct link between causes of attacks against <b>humanitarian</b> <b>workers</b> and <b>humanitarian</b> security. It argues that when humanitarian organisations involve peacekeepers directly in their humanitarian relief activities, {{this is likely to}} lead to a decrease in attacks. This is because peacekeepers are armed and able to function as a capable and credible counterthreat against belligerents for humanitarian organisations. A game-like theoretic model of the decision-making sequence leading up to attacks in the humanitarian space is applied to illustrate this. The theoretical argument is tested quantitatively on freshly collated data on peacekeeping activities using a negative binomial count model. Unexpectedly however, the results reveal a contradictory relationship to the hypothesis. Directly involving peacekeepers in humanitarian relief activities is associated with an increase in attacks against <b>humanitarian</b> <b>workers.</b> The surprising results are found to be significant and robust overall...|$|R
