Next, most breeds have their hooves painted black, usually with <b>hoof</b> <b>black</b> or a glossy black spray paint. Exceptions to this are the Clydesdale and Shire breeds which commonly have white hooves, linked to the white leg markings preferable for their breed. For these breeds, {{it is necessary to}} powder their white feathers with baby powder, or a similar substance, once again depending on preference.|$|E

In addition to low growls, these deers may attack their opponents with their tusks and strong fore <b>hooves.</b> <b>Black</b> musk deer are also considerably vigilant.

The black colour derives from the Tux breed, and the red from the Zillertal. The skin is dark, the nose and <b>hooves</b> <b>black.</b> The Tux-Zillertal is a frugal breed, well adapted to high mountain pastures.|$|R

50|$|Prior to 1831, the Shawnee were relocated, band by band, to Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma, {{and other}} parts of the American Plains west of the Mississippi River as a number of Shawnee chiefs {{surrendered}} independently to the United States. Chief <b>Black</b> <b>Hoof</b> (Catahecassa, d. 1831) signed the 1817 Treaty of Fort Meigs and 1818 Treaty of St. Mary's, which ceded lands and created small reservations for the Shawnee.

He probably took part in the Battle of Point Pleasant during Lord Dunmore's War against the Virginia militia in 1774. During the American Revolutionary War, he may have taken part in the siege of Boonesborough in 1778, which was led by Chief Blackfish, as well as the subsequent defense of the Shawnee village of Chillicothe in 1779.
