500|$|Snake {{is awarded}} {{the title of}} [...] "Big Boss" [...] and given the Distinguished Service Cross for his efforts by President Johnson {{in front of his}} FOX Unit and other officials; however Snake has become so distraught and {{demoralized}} after EVA's revelation that he leaves almost immediately after getting his medal, hardly acknowledging Major Zero, Para-Medic and Sigint. Later, he arrives at an anonymous grave, The Boss's, just one of thousands located in Arlington National Cemetery. Laying down The Boss's gun and a bouquet of lilies upon the nameless gravestone, <b>he</b> <b>scans</b> the endless rows before him, salutes, and sheds a single tear, knowing that The Boss will forever be seen by the world as a terrorist, and a traitor to her nation, and that her true patriotism will be known by only EVA, himself, and others who knew of her mission.|$|E
2500|$|At each concert, Brooks {{and crew}} {{return to the}} stage and perform [...] "The Fever". Brooks dances on a {{conveyor}} belt as the drummer's sphere rises above the stage. Following the performance, the band leaves the stage once again. Brooks then returns, often unaccompanied, for what he dubs the [...] "housekeeping segment", in which <b>he</b> <b>scans</b> the crowd for fans with signs requesting songs, performing them acoustically. In some instances (such as the Atlanta concerts in September 2014), he may also perform acoustic covers of songs like [...] "Amarillo By Morning", [...] "Night Moves", and [...] "Piano Man". Regardless, the encore set commonly concludes with the band returning to perform [...] "Much Too Young (To Feel This Damn Old)".|$|E
6000|$|Who {{believes}} that equal grace [...] God extends in every place, [...] Little difference <b>he</b> <b>scans</b> [...] Twixt a rabbit's God and man's.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>scanned</b> {{his finger}} nails. He {{looked up at}} Redwood with eyes bland through his glasses.|$|R
60|$|Faintly out of {{the night}} there came to Carthoris's ears the purring of a distant motor. <b>He</b> <b>scanned</b> the heavens.|$|R
6000|$|... "What is it?" [...] he cried. [...] "Am I not welcome?" [...] <b>He</b> <b>scanned</b> {{her face}} with passionate longing. [...] "Do you regret--regret letting me come?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Deserted now, <b>he</b> <b>scans</b> thy gray-worn towers, [...] Thy vaults, where dead of feudal ages sleep, [...] Thy cloisters, {{pervious}} to the wintry showers, [...] These--these he views, {{and views}} them but to weep.|$|E
6000|$|Deserted now, <b>he</b> <b>scans</b> thy gray worn towers; [...] Thy vaults, where dead of feudal ages sleep; [...] Thy cloisters, {{pervious}} to the wintry showers; [...] These, these he views, {{and views}} them but to weep.|$|E

6000|$|Was {{the guide}} resting? Was <b>he</b> <b>scanning</b> {{the country from}} some high point? Was he inquiring of a chance mountaineer? Stop,--had he fainted from excess of fatigue and anxiety? ...|$|R
60|$|He {{pulled the}} {{newspaper}} out. It was a good-sized rosy sheet, as if flushed by {{the warmth of}} its own convictions, which were optimistic. <b>He</b> <b>scanned</b> the pages rapidly.|$|R
60|$|At last {{he put out}} {{his hands}} to seize mine, and drawing me to the light <b>he</b> <b>scanned</b> my face, Heaven alone knowing what it was he sought there.|$|R
6000|$|ANDERSON. Don't speak so strangely, my love. It sounds insincere to me. (She looks unutterable reproach at him.) Yes, dear, {{nonsense}} {{is always}} insincere; and my dearest is talking nonsense. Just nonsense. (Her face darkens into dumb obstinacy. She stares straight before her, {{and does not}} look at him again, absorbed in Richard's fate. <b>He</b> <b>scans</b> her face; sees that his rallying has produced no effect; and gives it up, making no further effort to conceal his anxiety.) I wish I knew what has frightened you so. Was there a struggle? Did he fight? ...|$|E
6000|$|To continue. Besides {{originality}} and daring, {{which have}} been already insisted upon, width and intensity are leading characteristics of his writings--width both of subject-matter and of comprehension, intensity of self-absorption into what the poet contemplates and expresses. <b>He</b> <b>scans</b> and presents an enormous panorama, unrolled before him as from a mountain-top; and yet, whatever most large or most minute or casual thing his eye glances upon, that he enters into with a depth of affection which identifies him with it for a time, be the object what it may. There is a singular interchange also of actuality and of ideal substratum and suggestion. While he sees men, with even abnormal exactness and sympathy, as men, he sees them also [...] "as trees walking," [...] and admits us to perceive that the whole show is in a measure spectral and unsubstantial, and the mask of a larger and profounder reality beneath it, {{of which it is}} giving perpetual intimations and auguries. He is the poet indeed of literality, but of passionate and significant literality, full of indirections as well as directness, and of readings between the lines. If he is the 'cutest of Yankees, he is also as truly an enthusiast as any the most typical poet. All his faculties and performance glow into a white heat of brotherliness; and there is a poignancy both of tenderness and of beauty about his finer works which discriminates them quite as much as their modernness, audacity, or any other exceptional point. If the reader wishes to see the great and more intimate powers of Whitman in their fullest expression, he may consult the Nocturn for the Death of Lincoln; than which {{it would be difficult to}} find anywhere a purer, more elevated, more poetic, more ideally abstract, or at the same time more pathetically personal, threnody--uniting the thrilling chords of grief, of beauty, of triumph, and of final unfathomed satisfaction. With all his singularities, Whitman is a master of words and of sounds: he has them at his command--made for, and instinct with, his purpose--messengers of unsurpassable sympathy and intelligence between himself and his readers. The entire book may be called the paean of the natural man--not of the merely physical, still less of the disjunctively intellectual or spiritual man, but of him who, being a man first and foremost, is therein also a spirit and an intellect.|$|E

6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>scanned</b> them {{carefully}} with his experienced eye. [...] "Is it the microbes ye mean?" [...] he answered. [...] "An' what 'ud they be, then, if it wasn't the bacillus of pyaemia?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{we fought}} {{together}} at the Old Fields School. Are you that boy?" [...] and <b>he</b> <b>scanned</b> me again. [...] "By God, I believe you are." [...] Suddenly his face clouded once more.|$|R

50|$|It {{has been}} said that his {{performance}} gives the importance he gave to expressional restraint and <b>He</b> <b>scans</b> the ragas with an eye on beauteous light and shade. In the present generation of musicians, {{he is one of the}} few instrumentalists who can provide this experience to listeners and create in their minds nostalgic memories of a bygone era. He travels extensively on musical tours all over the world.|$|E
6000|$|... "God help us!" [...] murmured Stanley, in an undertone, as <b>he</b> <b>scanned</b> the seaward horizon, {{which was}} covered with leaden clouds and streaks of lurid light, beneath which the foaming sea leaped furiously.|$|R
60|$|What {{he wanted}} was four months back, in December. It was a tiny item, so small that he almost missed it. His hands trembled as <b>he</b> <b>scanned</b> it, using the small {{dictionary}} {{for some of the}} archaic terms.|$|R

50|$|One of Megatron's loyal followers, Skyquake was entombed in stasis on Earth {{until he}} was awakened by Starscream. However, Skyquake refuses to follow Starscream while {{remaining}} loyal to Megatron {{to the point of}} attempting to finish his master's order to kill Optimus Prime. Though outmatched by Optimus and Bumblebee, despite the former's attempts to reason with him, Skyquake gains the advantage when <b>he</b> <b>scans</b> Fowler's fighter jet. Eventually, through a reckless plan, Bumblebee manages to defeat Skyquake, destroying him.|$|E
50|$|Reilly {{leaves the}} ship, stating {{his job is}} to find milgonite. Assisted by Alan Carter, <b>he</b> <b>scans</b> the parent rock. His {{geophysical}} assessment confirms it is not milgonite, but an amalgam of several other minerals. As Koenig and Maya arrive, Reilly intends to inspect a smear of the rock fluid under a portable microscope. Koenig protests, but Maya insists research is necessary to save Verdeschi. The fluid is found to contain structures similar to blood corpuscles—the rock is a living organism.|$|E
5000|$|Knowing {{about the}} dead Kitty wants to hand {{it over to the}} party who demanded it and he finds a murdered person. In the later course of time they finds it belongs to a {{minister}} and the money inside make them greedy. In such a situation Kitty wants to know why terrorists are behind that body in his truck of the car [...] <b>He</b> <b>scans</b> the body and finds a pen drive tucked inside. That explains a terrorist gang is up to a major demolition of peace.|$|E
60|$|A talk lasting {{the best}} part of an hour followed, and at last the worthy doctor had his eyes opened to the unworthiness of his assistant. <b>He</b> <b>scanned</b> the sheets of paper and the writing the boys had brought with interest.|$|R
60|$|He {{paused at}} the rough gate and leaned over it while <b>he</b> <b>scanned</b> the house and its {{surroundings}} eagerly. As he looked, the kitchen door opened and Min, clad in the old overcoat, came out and walked swiftly across the yard.|$|R
6000|$|When he lit {{the candles}} there, And the light {{fell on his}} hand, And it trembled as <b>he</b> <b>scanned</b> Her and me, his vanquished air Hinted that his dream was done, And I saw he had begun [...] To understand.|$|R

5000|$|Although McCloud {{sketches}} his layouts in pencil, {{the remainder}} of his work is done digitally, explaining in his 2006 book Making Comics that he had not used traditional materials like Bristol board, pens or brushes in years. After sketching layouts, which he says are [...] "pretty tight", and include the full script, <b>he</b> <b>scans</b> them into an 18-inch computer tablet/monitor to use them as a guide for lettering them in Adobe Illustrator. After completing the lettering, he exports the files to Photoshop, where he fully renders the art at a resolution of 1,200 dpi, creating between five and fifty layers of finished art before flattening it into a single black and white bitmap, plus a greyscale page, if needed.|$|E
50|$|Bumblebee {{returns in}} Transformers: Age of Extinction. He {{has a new}} vehicle mode, a {{modified}} 1967 Chevrolet Camaro, before <b>he</b> <b>scans</b> a yellow 2014 Camaro and turns into a 2014 Chevrolet Camaro concept, because of this his robot mode has been changed as well and resembles one design of Bumblebee from the Generation 1 IDW comics. In the end of Age of Extinction, Bumblebee assumed the Autobot leadership and protecting Yeager family as Optimus blasts off to space along with the Seed, finding the mysterious Creators. Though Bumblebee mostly can't speak in the film and still relies on radio communication, he is shown {{to be able to}} express limited speech but in a more high-pitched voice, possibly meaning his voice box is healing.|$|E
60|$|Her {{eyes were}} shining through her tears, and {{her smile was}} like the sun out of a rain-swept sky. His Lordship took {{one of her hands}} in his own, and one of mine. <b>He</b> <b>scanned</b> our faces in a long, {{lingering}} look.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I think it's {{rather a}} pity that you shouldn't arrive there directly, without the {{interposition}} of Trieste." [...] <b>He</b> <b>scanned</b> her yet more closely, {{but with a}} sort of absence in his look, as if he addressed some ideal of her.|$|R
