5|$|Continuing westward, Inez made {{landfall}} {{as a small}} hurricane on the Barahona Peninsula of the Dominican Republic. There, {{the storm}} flooded many rivers and destroyed over 800houses. Nationwide, there were about 100deaths and $12million in damage. After affecting the country, Inez struck southwestern Haiti, where it was considered the worst hurricane since the 1920s. As many as 1,000people were killed, and 60,000people were left homeless. Damage totaled $20.35million in Haiti, prompting the United States government to send aid for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>nearly</b> ten years due to previous mishandling of funds. Inez weakened quickly over Hispaniola, although it reintensified into a major hurricane before striking southeastern Cuba on September30.

In 1986, Sinatra collapsed on stage while performing in Atlantic City and was hospitalized for diverticulitis, which left him looking frail. Two years later, Sinatra reunited with Martin and Davis, Jr. and went on the Rat Pack Reunion Tour, during which they played a number of large arenas. When Martin dropped out of the tour early on, a rift developed between them and the two never spoke again.|$|E
5|$|It was the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>nearly</b> {{two decades}} that number 1 played number 2 and neither {{had won the}} French Open previously.

Rain had affected the tournament schedule and in Djokovic's case, he had to play 4 matches in 5 days. Murray was playing {{to become the first}} Brit since 1937 to win, while Djokovic had multiple historical records on the line, most notably joining the elite group of men who won a career grand slam and joining Rod Laver and Don Budge as the only men to hold all 4 Grand Slam titles at the same time. After Murray took the first set, Djokovic rallied to win the match prevailing in four sets.|$|E

5|$|Four {{games into}} the 2009–10 season, Daniel {{suffered}} {{the first major}} injury of his career, breaking his foot {{in a game against}} the Montreal Canadiens. He was sidelined for 18games, marking the first time in Henrik's career that he played without his brother for an extended period. In Daniel's absence, however, Henrik enjoyed a high-scoring start to the season. On 14 November 2009, he scored his first NHL career hat-trick in an 8–2 win against the Colorado Avalanche. Leading up to Daniel's 22 November return, Henrik scored seven goals in seven games. He continued his pace into December, recording a League-leading 25points (five goals, 20assists) in 15games to be named the NHL's First Star of the Month. The following month, he was named Second Star, having recorded 25points in 13games. On 7 January 2010, Henrik moved into top spot in the NHL scoring race, ahead of San Jose Sharks centre Joe Thornton with a three-assist night against the Phoenix Coyotes. It marked the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>nearly</b> five years, since Näslund was tied with Robert Lang on 18 February 2004, that a Canucks player held the League lead in scoring. During a 3–1 win against the Calgary Flames on 14 March, Henrik recorded his 416th career assist to pass Trevor Linden as Vancouver's all-time leader. On 27 March, he scored two assists against the San Jose Sharks to become the fourth Canuck in team history to record a 100-point season (after Pavel Bure, Alexander Mogilny and Markus Näslund). He was named Third Star of the Month for March after scoring 24points in 15games.|$|E
60|$|The {{deputation}} retired greatly crestfallen, and {{the result}} was that for that evening the young Canterbury girls were for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> their lives <b>nearly</b> emancipated from maternal supervision, and enjoyed the evening proportionately, flirting with a zest all the greater for its being an amusement indulged <b>in</b> for the <b>first</b> <b>time,</b> and making their mothers' hearts swell, and their mothers' hair figuratively stand on end at such unheard of goings on. Another consequence of the lighted walks was that many families of girls who had never hitherto been allowed to dance except in quadrilles, now found themselves allowed to waltz as they pleased. Not that their mothers' views of the extreme impropriety of such dances had undergone any change; but that of two evils they chose the least, and thought it better to have their daughters waltzing under their eyes, than that they should be wandering away altogether beyond their ken.|$|R
40|$|Densification {{of calcium}} {{hydroxyapatite}} fine powders doped with different concentrations of Mg (2, 4 and 6 mol % Mg, MgHA) was successfully achieved for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> a <b>nearly</b> fully dense state using the hydrothermal hot pressing (HHP) technique at low temperatures. Consolidation of MgHA powders was studied under different temperatures (150 – 240 °C), reaction times (1 – 6 h), and powder particle size (20 nm– 1. 5 μm). X-Ray diffraction analyses {{indicated that the}} particle densification under HHP conditions proceeded without any variation in the crystalline structure and regardless of the Mg content. The results from this work showed that an increase in temperature accelerates the reaction between MgHA particles and water (solvent) mixed during the hydrothermal treatment. Particle packing associated with bulk densification was achieved through a massive dissolution-recrystallisation mechanism, which induced the formation of small particles that rapidly crystallised {{on the surface of}} the partially dissolved original MgHA particles. The optimum conditions to obtain pellets with a high apparent density of 3. 0758 ± 0. 001 g/cm 3 and tensile strength value of 12. 6 ± 0. 6 MPa were 10 wt% of water at a temperature of 240 °C with a 6 h reaction time and 6 mol % of Mg (MgHA 3). The use of the HHP technique coupled with the fine particle size and reactivity of the MgHA precursor powders with water allowed us to produce disks that were compacted to a nearly full dense state with a low content of open porosity of 2. 0 %...|$|R
40|$|Exorcism {{has been}} a ministerial {{component}} of Christianity from its inception, following the example of Jesus Christ who cast out demons from possessed persons. In the Roman Catholic Church, this ministry is principally carried out {{by means of the}} Rite of Exorcism, which is an official liturgical rite celebrated by a priest on behalf of a person who is thought to be possessed by the devil. The rite evolved through the centuries until it was standardized for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> 1614. For <b>nearly</b> four hundred years thereafter, it remained virtually unaltered until a process of revision was set in motion in the 1990 s. Why was the revision undertaken? Would the liturgical laws contained in the 1614 rite be altered? In response to these queries and others, the author contextualizes the rite of exorcism within a larger historical framework by tracing its development from ancient times to the present. With this context established, the revised rite of 1998 is studied and compared with its predecessor of 1614...|$|R

5|$|Boarding was {{phased out}} in 1989 and the {{buildings}} used for boarding, School House and the Bishop's Palace, were converted into teaching space. Girls were {{admitted to the}} sixth form for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> 1994, ending <b>nearly</b> 900 years of single-sex education. In 1999 the Daynes Sports Centre opened and the former gymnasium was converted into the Blake Drama Studio and two further laboratories. The same year the artists Cornford & Cross were commissioned by the Norwich Gallery to produce a series of sculptures beside the River Wensum. One of the works, Jerusalem, was installed on the school playing fields until July 2002. Part of the installation was later donated to the art department. In 2008 new science laboratories opened on St Faiths Lane in the south section of the Close. The facilities include a seismometer {{which is part of}} the British Geological Survey's schools network. That same year, the school began to admit girls below the sixth form for the <b>first</b> <b>time,</b> initially as young as age eleven. The next year, 2009, all school-age girls were eligible for admission. An eighth house called Seagrim, named after distinguished ONs Derek and Hugh Seagrim, was created in 2009. In 2011 the first female head of school in the school's history was chosen. In late 2013 work began to extend the Lower School.|$|R
5000|$|The {{government}} {{charged that}} he was a prominent member of the Taliban and its military, but we proved that this is false. Indeed, we have documents from Afghanistan, even a letter from Mullah Omar himself on Taliban letterhead, discussing Mr. Gul’s efforts to resign from the Taliban a year or more before 9/11/01[...] [...] [...] Mr. Gul was never an enemy of the United States in any way[...] [...] [...] We now hear for the very <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> the <b>nearly</b> 10 years since Mr. Gul’s arrest, that (1) he operated a guesthouse for Al-Qaida members, and (2) that he admitted providing bin Laden operational support on several occasions. Over the course of almost 3 years in court, the government has never provided any evidence at all to support this slander. Neither Mr. Gul nor any credible witness has ever said such things. Indeed, this is why the government placed Mr. Gul in the group of prisoners set for “indefinite detention;” it admitted that it lacked any credible evidence to prove its suspicions in a court of law. The government never even made these claims until now, when Mr. Gul is not alive to defend himself.Beginning in the early 1980′s, Mr. Gul was a member of local forces who were allied with the United States against the Soviets. From 1989-1996, he continued to run the local weapons depot in his hometown, not unlike a police commander, which he used to keep the peace. In 1996, the Taliban swept through eastern Afghanistan and took over his city at the barrel of a gun. Mr. Gul was given two options: flee with your family to Pakistan or stay home and operate the depot at the command of the Taliban. It must be remembered that the Taliban was initially greeted warmly by many Afghans, and even the American government, as a source of hope. Mr. Gul stayed home. The Taliban soon proved themselves to be as corrupt and abusive as we can imagine. Mr. Gul discovered this change over time and resigned from the Taliban more than one year before September 11, 2001. He was arrested in December 2001 when he voluntarily traveled to meet American militaryofficials.|$|R
60|$|The mere {{beauty of}} this scene all will feel, who have the sense of beauty in them. Yet it is not on that aspect which I wish to dwell, but on its healthfulness. Exercise is taken, <b>in</b> {{measured}} <b>time,</b> {{to the sound of}} song, as a duty almost, as well as an amusement. For this game of ball, which is here mentioned for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> human literature, <b>nearly</b> three thousand years ago, was held by the Greeks and by the Romans after them, to be an almost necessary part of a liberal education; principally, doubtless, from the development which it produced in the upper half of the body, not merely to the arms, but to the chest, by raising and expanding the ribs, and to all the muscles of the torso, whether perpendicular or oblique. The elasticity and grace which it was believed to give were so much prized, that a room for ball-play, and a teacher of the art, were integral parts of every gymnasium; and the Athenians {{went so far as to}} bestow on one famous ball-player, Aristonicus of Carystia, a statue and the rights of citizenship. The rough and hardy young Spartans, when passing from boyhood into manhood, received the title of ball- players, seemingly from the game which it was then their special duty to learn. In the case of Nausicaa and her maidens, the game would just bring into their right places all that is liable to be contracted and weakened in women, so many of whose occupations must needs be sedentary and stooping; while the song which accompanied the game at once filled the lungs regularly and rhythmically, and prevented violent motion, or unseemly attitude. We, the civilised, need physiologists to remind us of these simple facts, and even then do not act on them. Those old half-barbarous Greeks had found them out for themselves, and, moreover, acted on them.|$|R

40|$|Displacement Green's {{function}} is the building block for some semi-analytical methods like Boundary Element Method (BEM), Distributed Point Source Method (DPCM), etc. In this thesis, the displacement Green`s function in anisotropic media {{due to a}} time harmonic point force is studied. Unlike the isotropic media, the Green's function in anisotropic media {{does not have a}} closed form solution. The dynamic Green's function for an anisotropic medium can be written as a summation of singular and non-singular or regular parts. The singular part, being similar to the result of static Green's function, {{is in the form of}} an integral over an oblique circular path in 3 D. This integral can be evaluated either by a numerical integration technique or can be converted to a summation of algebraic terms via the calculus of residue. The other part, which is the regular part, is in the form of an integral over the surface of a unit sphere. This integral needs to be evaluated numerically and its evaluation is considerably more time consuming than the singular part. Obtaining dynamic Green's function and its spatial derivatives involves calculation of these two types of integrals. The spatial derivatives of Green's function are important in calculating quantities like stress and stain tensors. The contribution of this thesis can be divided into two parts. In the first part, different integration techniques including Gauss Quadrature, Simpson's, Chebyshev, and Lebedev integration techniques are tried out and compared for evaluation of dynamic Green’s function. In addition the solution from the residue theorem is included for the singular part. The accuracy and performance of numerical implementation is studied in detail via different numerical examples. Convergence plots are used to analyze the numerical error for both Green's function and its derivatives. The second part of contribution of this thesis relates to the mathematical derivations. As mentioned above, the regular part of dynamic Green's function, being an integral over the surface of a unit sphere, is responsible for the majority of computational time. From symmetry properties, this integration domain can be reduced to a hemisphere, but no more simplification seems to be possible for a general anisotropic medium. In this thesis, the integration domain for regular part is further reduced to a quarter of a sphere for the particular case of transversely isotropic material. This reduction proposed for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> this thesis <b>nearly</b> halves the number of integration points for the evaluation of regular part of dynamic Green's function. It significantly reduces the computational time...|$|R
