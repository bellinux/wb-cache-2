25|$|August Weismann was {{responsible}} for interpreting and formalizing the mechanisms of Darwinian evolution in a modern theoretical framework. In 1889, he theorized that ageing was part of life's program because the old need to remove themselves from the theatre {{to make room for}} the next generation, sustaining the turnover that is necessary for evolution. This theory again has much intuitive appeal, but it suffers from having a teleological or goal-driven explanation. In other words, a purpose for ageing has been identified, but not a mechanism by which that purpose could be achieved. Ageing may have this advantage for the long-term health of the community; but that doesn't explain how individuals would acquire the genes that make them <b>get</b> <b>old</b> and die, or why individuals that had ageing genes would be more successful than other individuals lacking such genes. (In fact, there is every reason to think that the opposite is true: ageing decreases individual fitness.) Weismann later abandoned his theory.|$|E

500|$|As {{part of her}} {{character}} arc, the plot moves GLaDOS from her anger with Chell for her actions in Portal, which Wolpaw said [...] "was going to <b>get</b> <b>old</b> pretty quick", to an internal struggle. The reuse of McLain's voice {{led to the creation}} of a backstory and subplot about GLaDOS's creation. The writers panicked when they realized that their plans to have Chell and GLaDOS play off each other would only work if both players spoke. To remedy this, they created the Caroline subplot to give GLaDOS an external situation to deal with and to drive the story during the middle act of the game.|$|E

Although disappointed with the results, Sigurður expressed confidence that [...] "I will get a younger and a bigger and better one soon." [...] Visitors' most common reaction to the preserved human penis is [...] "that it's very old, you know, a bit shrunken, and the male members [...] say 'oh, I hope mine will not look like this when I <b>get</b> <b>old.</b> Sigurður has considered donating his own penis to the museum when he dies but said that it depends on his wife: [...] "If she dies first, my specimen would go in here.

500|$|The Monster's {{gameplay}} {{was praised}} by Ingenito, {{as he thought}} it tasked players to use skills and patience while playing, and that Evolve has provided satisfying rewards for the player that successfully outsmarts the Hunters, a sentiment which was echoed by Strom. Lathi commended the Wraith, which he thought encouraged hit-and-run tactics. However, Rowan thought that the Monster gameplay can <b>get</b> <b>old</b> very fast. Furthermore, he noted that several Monsters felt overpowered, which made Evolve feel unbalanced. The controls of the game received praise. Marchiafava {{thought that it was}} smartly designed, and applauded it for its accessible nature. Lathi wrote a similar statement, but thought that the gameplay would be [...] "difficult to master". David Meikleham from GamesRadar praised Evolves shooting mechanic, but complained that the action presented on-screen can become too chaotic for players to handle. Strom felt that the game-modes were unbalanced in terms of fun, and that certain game-modes prioritized fun for one team at the penalty of the other, and criticized the fact that outside of private lobbies with friends, you cannot choose any game-mode other than Hunt.|$|E
500|$|HitFix writer Alan Sepinwall {{declared}} [...] "Flu Season" [...] the {{one episode}} he would suggest to newcomers seeking {{to become familiar}} with Parks and Recreation because it spotlights so many different characters, includes both warm and comedic moments, and includes commentary on small town government. He praised the performances of Lowe and Poehler, the latter of whom was especially effective because there were real stakes to Leslie making her presentation. Matt Fowler of IGN also said Lowe's character, which he feared would <b>get</b> <b>old</b> fast, had proven to be a strong asset to the show, and Ann's character was at her strongest opposite him. But Fowler also said [...] "Flu Season" [...] was a strong ensemble with great character moments for everyone, including Ron and Andy's bonding and Ben's admiration of Leslie. The A.V. Club writer Steve Heisler said [...] "Flu Season" [...] gave the entire cast the chance to be a bit sillier than usual and demonstrate their wide comedic ranges. Heisler said Ben and Chris felt like they belonged among the other characters, and he praised the performance of Aubrey Plaza, claiming April's character seemed more fleshed out than in past episodes.|$|E
500|$|Nurmi stated to a Swedish {{newspaper}} that [...] "this is absolutely my last {{season on the}} track. I am beginning to <b>get</b> <b>old.</b> I have raced for fifteen years and have had enough of it." [...] However, Nurmi continued running, turning his attention to longer distances. In October, he broke the world records for the 15km, the 10 miles and the one hour run in Berlin. Nurmi's one-hour record stood for 17 years, until Viljo Heino ran 129 metres further in 1945. In January 1929, Nurmi started his second U.S. tour from Brooklyn. He suffered his first-ever defeat in the mile to Ray Conger at the indoor Wanamaker Mile. Nurmi was seven seconds slower than in his world record run in 1925, and it was immediately speculated if the mile had become too short a distance for him. In 1930, he set a new world record for the 20km. In July 1931, Nurmi showed he still had pace for the shorter distances by beating Lauri Lehtinen, Lauri Virtanen and Volmari Iso-Hollo, and breaking the world record on the now-rare two miles. He was the first runner to complete the distance in less than nine minutes. Nurmi planned to compete only in the 10,000 m and the marathon in the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, stating that he [...] "won't enter the 5000 metres for Finland has at least three excellent men for that event." ...|$|E
