5|$|Developments in AspectJ have {{revealed}} {{the potential to}} incorporate <b>just-in-time</b> compilation into the execution of aspect-oriented code to address performance demands. At run-time, an aspect weaver could translate aspects in a more efficient manner than traditional, static weaving approaches. Using AspectJ on a Java Virtual Machine, dynamic weaving of aspects at run-time {{has been shown to}} improve code performance by 26%. While some implementations of <b>just-in-time</b> virtual machines implement this capability through a new virtual machine, some implementations can be designed to use features that already exist in current virtual machines. The requirement of a new virtual machine is contrary to one of the original design goals of AspectJ.|$|E
5|$|HipHop Virtual Machine (HHVM) {{developed}} at Facebook and available as open source, it converts PHP code into a high-level bytecode (commonly {{known as an}} intermediate language), which is then translated into x86-64 machine code dynamically at runtime by a <b>just-in-time</b> (JIT) compiler, resulting in up to 6× performance improvements.|$|E
5|$|Psyco is a <b>just-in-time</b> specialising {{compiler}} that integrates with CPython and transforms bytecode {{to machine}} code at runtime. The emitted code is specialised for certain data types and is faster than standard Python code.|$|E
5|$|PyPy is a fast, {{compliant}} {{interpreter of}} Python 2.7 and 3.5. Its <b>just-in-time</b> compiler brings a significant speed improvement over CPython. A version {{taking advantage of}} multi-core processors using software transactional memory is being created.|$|E
5|$|Python's {{developers}} {{strive to}} avoid premature optimization, and moreover, reject patches to non-critical parts of CPython that would offer a marginal {{increase in speed}} {{at the cost of}} clarity. When speed is important, a Python programmer can move time-critical functions to extension modules written in languages such as C, or try using PyPy, a <b>just-in-time</b> compiler. Cython is also available, which translates a Python script into C and makes direct C-level API calls into the Python interpreter.|$|E
5|$|To {{accomplish}} <b>just-in-time</b> weaving, {{a change}} to the virtual machine that executes the compiled bytecode is necessary. A proposed solution for AspectJ uses a layered approach which builds upon the existing Java Virtual Machine to add support for join point management and callbacks to a Dynamic Aspect-Oriented Programming Engine. An alternative implementation uses a weaving engine that uses breakpoints to halt execution at the pointcut, select an appropriate method, embed it into the application, and continue. The use of breakpoints in this manner {{has been shown to}} reduce performance due to {{a very large number of}} context switches.|$|E
25|$|Since JRE version 1.2, Sun's JVM {{implementation}} {{has included}} a <b>just-in-time</b> compiler {{instead of an}} interpreter.|$|E
25|$|<b>Just-in-time</b> (JIT) compilation: The runtime {{will turn}} ECMA CIL byte codes into native code as the code runs.|$|E
25|$|In particular, for <b>just-in-time</b> compilers the {{performance}} of the run time compile component, executing together with its target code, is the key to improving overall execution speed.|$|E
25|$|The use of {{inventory}} proportionality in the United States {{is thought to}} have been inspired by Japanese <b>just-in-time</b> parts inventory management made famous by Toyota Motors in the 1980s.|$|E
25|$|SpiderMonkey is a {{cross-platform}} engine {{written in}} C++ which implements ECMAScript, a standard developed from JavaScript. It comprises an interpreter, several <b>just-in-time</b> compilers, a decompiler and a garbage collector. Products which embed SpiderMonkey include Firefox, Thunderbird, SeaMonkey, and many non-Mozilla applications.|$|E
25|$|Transportation: - The Department of Transportation is {{responsible}} for protecting the road, rail, air, and water transportation infrastructure, including computer-controlled <b>just-in-time</b> delivery systems, optimization of distribution through hubs, and traffic and operations centers that are consolidated into key locations, and regulation of the transport of hazardous materials.|$|E
25|$|Green {{publishing}} means {{adapting the}} publishing process to minimise environmental impact. One {{example of this}} is the concept of on-demand printing, using digital or print-on-demand technology. This cuts down the need to ship books since they are manufactured close to the customer on a <b>just-in-time</b> basis.|$|E
25|$|Recent developments, such as <b>just-in-time</b> manufacturing, have {{affected}} those working manufacturing jobs and agricultural work more than others. When larger companies or others {{who control the}} supply chain decide to reduce manufacturing, these people oftentimes find themselves {{out of a job}} with little or no assistance.|$|E
25|$|During {{a period}} of {{significant}} postwar reconstruction, migrant assimilation and technical innovation, the factory employed a peak of 7000 people from 35 nations. The only plant in Australia to manufacture the complete vehicle, it introduced to Australia the in-line transfer machining of engine blocks, the “rotodip” paint process, automatic conveyor assembly processes and major advances in <b>just-in-time</b> and flexible manufacturing concepts.|$|E
25|$|<b>Just-in-time</b> compilers {{can produce}} {{customized}} machine code based on run-time data, {{at the cost}} of compilation overhead. This technique dates to the earliest regular expression engines, and has become widespread with Java HotSpot and V8 for JavaScript. In some cases adaptive optimization may be able to perform run time optimization exceeding the capability of static compilers by dynamically adjusting parameters according to the actual input or other factors.|$|E
25|$|A new runtime {{environment}} {{known as the}} Android Runtime (ART), intended to replace the Dalvik virtual machine, was introduced as a technology preview in KitKat. ART is a cross-platform runtime which supports the x86, ARM, and MIPS architectures in both 32-bit and 64-bit environments. Unlike Dalvik, which uses <b>just-in-time</b> compilation (JIT), ART compiles apps upon installation, which are then run exclusively from the compiled version from then on. This technique removes the processing overhead associated with the JIT process, improving system performance.|$|E
25|$|Because {{of their}} remote nature, {{prognosis}} and health-monitoring systems on offshore wind turbines will {{become much more}} necessary. They would enable better planning <b>just-in-time</b> maintenance, thereby reducing the operations and maintenance costs. According to a report from a coalition of researchers from universities, industry, and government (supported by the Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future), making field data from these turbines available would be invaluable in validating complex analysis codes used for turbine design. Reducing this barrier would contribute {{to the education of}} engineers specializing in wind energy.|$|E
25|$|In the 21st century, {{major changes}} to the ice pack due to climate change have stirred {{speculation}} that the passage may become clear enough of ice to permit safe commercial shipping for {{at least part of}} the year. On August 21, 2007, the Northwest Passage became open to ships without the need of an icebreaker. According to Nalan Koc of the Norwegian Polar Institute, this was the first time the Passage has been clear since they began keeping records in 1972. The Northwest Passage opened again on August 25, 2008. However, drifting chunks of ice, especially in springtime, remain problematic as they can clog straits or severely damage a ship's hull. Cargo's routes may therefore be slower and uncertain, depending on conditions. Because most of the containerized traffic operates in a <b>just-in-time</b> mode, which does not tolerate delays well, and the relative isolation of the passage (which impedes shipping companies from optimizing their operations by grouping multiple stopovers on a same itinerary), the NWP and other Arctic routes are not usually seen as promising shipping lanes.|$|E

500|$|... while {{a second}} study {{estimate}} over 500,000vehicles travel that section on some days. This makes it North America's busiest roadway, surpassing the Santa Monica Freeway in Los Angeles and I-75 in Atlanta. The <b>just-in-time</b> auto parts delivery {{systems of the}} highly integrated automotive industry of Michigan and Ontario {{have contributed to the}} highway's status as the world's busiest truck route, carrying 60percent of vehicular trade between Canada and the US.|$|E
500|$|Jobs found {{office space}} in Palo Alto, California on 3475 Deer Creek Road, occupying {{a glass and}} {{concrete}} building which featured a staircase designed by architect I. M. Pei. The first floor used hardwood flooring and large worktables where the workstations would be assembled. To avoid inventory errors, NeXT used the <b>just-in-time</b> (JIT) inventory strategy. The company contracted out for all major [...] such as mainboards and cases and had the finished components shipped {{to the first floor}} for assembly. The second floor was the office space with an open floor plan. The only enclosed rooms were Jobs's office and a few conference rooms.|$|E
500|$|The {{foundation}} of PHP 7 is a PHP branch that was originally dubbed PHP next generation (phpng). It was authored by Dmitry Stogov, Xinchen Hui and Nikita Popov, and aimed to optimize PHP performance by refactoring the Zend Engine {{to use more}} compact data structures with improved cache locality while retaining near-complete language compatibility. [...] , WordPress-based benchmarks, which served as the main benchmark suite for the phpng project, showed an almost 100% increase in performance. [...] Changes from phpng are also expected {{to make it easier}} to improve performance in the future, as more compact data structures and other changes are seen as better suited for a successful migration to a <b>just-in-time</b> (JIT) compiler. [...] Because of the significant changes, the reworked Zend Engine is called Zend Engine 3, succeeding Zend Engine 2 used in PHP 5.|$|E
2500|$|In 1981, AMF {{sold the}} company {{to a group of}} 13 investors led by Vaughn Beals and Willie G. Davidson for $80million. [...] Inventory was {{strictly}} controlled using the <b>just-in-time</b> system.|$|E
2500|$|... {{there are}} a number of {{alternative}} implementations of Ruby, including JRuby, Rubinius, MagLev, IronRuby, MacRuby (and its iOS counterpart, RubyMotion), mruby, HotRuby, Topaz and Opal. Each takes a different approach, with IronRuby, JRuby, MacRuby and Rubinius providing <b>just-in-time</b> compilation and MacRuby and mruby also providing ahead-of-time compilation.|$|E
2500|$|An {{optimizing}} <b>just-in-time</b> (JIT) compiler named FTL {{was announced}} on May 13, 2014. It uses LLVM to generate optimized machine code. [...] "FTL" [...] stands for [...] "Fourth-Tier-LLVM", and unofficially for faster-than-light, alluding to its speed. As of February 15 2016, the backend of FTL JIT {{is replaced by}} [...] "Bare Bones Backend" [...] (or B3 for short).|$|E
2500|$|For {{computer}} programs {{to run on}} CLI, {{they need to be}} compiled into Common Intermediate Language (CIL) – as opposed to being compiled into machine code. Upon execution, an architecture-specific <b>just-in-time</b> compiler (JIT) turns the CIL code into machine code. To improve performance, however, [...]NET Framework comes with Native Image Generator (NGEN), which performs ahead-of-time compilation.|$|E
2500|$|When an {{application}} is first launched, the [...]NET Framework compiles the CIL code into executable code using its <b>just-in-time</b> compiler, and caches the executable program into the [...]NET Native Image Cache. Due to caching, the application launches faster for subsequent launches, although the first launch is usually slower. To {{speed up the}} first launch, developers may use the Native Image Generator utility to manually ahead-of-time compile and cache any [...]NET application.|$|E
2500|$|The {{variety of}} terms is {{basically}} the result of grouping software mechanisms that relate to a given aspect of software development. Automation specifically relates to exporting the function of an application or component (as an application programming interface (API)) {{so that it can}} be controlled by other applications instead of by human users only, [...]NET is a self-contained general methodology and technology to develop desktop and web applications written in a variety of <b>just-in-time</b> (JIT) compiled languages.|$|E
2500|$|Xamarin.iOS (previously named MonoTouch) is a {{proprietary}} library that allows developers to create C# and [...]NET based applications {{that run on}} the iPhone, iPod and iPad devices. It {{is based on the}} Mono framework and developed in conjunction with Novell. Unlike Mono applications, Xamarin.iOS [...] "Apps" [...] are compiled down to machine code targeted specifically at the Apple iPhone and iPad. This is necessary because the iOS kernel prevents <b>just-in-time</b> compilers from executing on the device.|$|E
2500|$|The Java {{platform}} {{consists of}} several programs, {{each of which}} provides a portion of its overall capabilities. [...] For example, the Java compiler, which converts Java source code into Java bytecode (an intermediate language for the JVM), is provided {{as part of the}} Java Development Kit (JDK). [...] The Java Runtime Environment (JRE), complementing the JVM with a <b>just-in-time</b> (JIT) compiler, converts intermediate bytecode into native machine code on the fly. The Java platform also includes an extensive set of libraries.|$|E
2500|$|The {{ability of}} digital presses to print without plates enables {{the use of}} {{variable}} data such as text or images, such as in personalized direct marketing applications, or in photo albums, which are usually printed in copies of one. Digital presses also make short-run and <b>just-in-time</b> printing [...] cost-effective. In this way, digital presses have changed the economic models for print {{in a wide variety of}} market segments, cutting down on supply chain costs and simplifying the creation of campaigns that reach consumers in more creative, personalized ways.|$|E
2500|$|The {{technique}} of inventory proportionality is {{most appropriate for}} inventories that remain unseen by the consumer, as opposed to [...] "keep full" [...] systems where a retail consumer {{would like to see}} full shelves of the product they are buying so as not to think they are buying something old, unwanted or stale; and differentiated from the [...] "trigger point" [...] systems where product is reordered when it hits a certain level; inventory proportionality is used effectively by <b>just-in-time</b> manufacturing processes and retail applications where the product is hidden from view.|$|E
2500|$|...NET Core is a {{free and}} {{open-source}} managed software framework for Windows, macOS and Linux. It consists of CoreCLR, a complete runtime implementation of CLR, the virtual machine that manages the execution of [...]NET programs. CoreCLR comes with an improved <b>just-in-time</b> compiler, called RyuJIT. [...] also includes CoreFX, which is a partial fork of FCL. While [...]NET Core shares a subset of [...]NET Framework APIs, it comes with its own API that {{is not part of}} [...]NET Framework. Further, [...]NET Core contains CoreRT, the [...]NET Native runtime optimized to be integrated into AOT compiled native binaries. A variant of the [...]NET Core library is used for UWP. 's command-line interface offers an execution entry point for operating systems and provides developer services like compilation and package management.|$|E
2500|$|The APLNext VisualAPL {{system is}} a {{departure}} from a conventional APL system in that VisualAPL is a true [...]NET language which is fully interoperable with other [...]NET languages such as VB.NET and C#. VisualAPL is inherently object-oriented and Unicode-based. While VisualAPL incorporates most {{of the features of}} standard APL implementations, the VisualAPL language extends standard APL to be [...]NET-compliant. VisualAPL is hosted in the standard Microsoft Visual Studio IDE and as such, invokes compilation in a manner identical to that of other [...]NET languages. By producing Common Intermediate Language (CIL) code, it utilizes the Microsoft <b>just-in-time</b> compiler (JIT) to support 32-bit or 64-bit hardware. Substantial performance speed-ups over standard APL have been reported, especially when (optional) strong typing of function arguments is used.|$|E
2500|$|Until version 5.0, Android used Dalvik as {{a process}} virtual machine with trace-based <b>just-in-time</b> (JIT) {{compilation}} to run Dalvik [...] "dex-code" [...] (Dalvik Executable), which is usually translated from the Java bytecode. [...] Following the trace-based JIT principle, in addition to interpreting the majority of application code, Dalvik performs the compilation and native execution of select frequently executed code segments ("traces") each time an application is launched. Android4.4 introduced Android Runtime (ART) as a new runtime environment, which uses ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation to entirely compile the application bytecode into machine code upon the installation of an application. [...] In Android4.4, ART was an experimental feature and not enabled by default; it became the only runtime option in the next major version of Android, 5.0.|$|E
