500|$|On 22 July 1967, Harrison, Boyd, Starr, and {{assistant}} Neil Aspinall flew to Athens, where they stayed overnight until Lennon, {{his wife and}} son, McCartney, and Jane Asher (McCartney's girlfriend), Boyd's 16-year-old sister, Paula, roadie Mal Evans, and publicist Alistair Taylor set off for Athens. Looking for an island they could buy to live on together, they chartered a yacht, the MV Arvi. McCartney later said that whilst sailing around Greek islands, <b>everybody</b> <b>just</b> [...] "sat around and took LSD". Lennon and the other Beatles publicly renounced drugs—although never completely—after their initial meetings with the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in London, and Bangor, Wales.|$|E
500|$|The {{lyrics of}} the {{original}} song were switched to fit the cause. The new lyrics include the line: [...] "A little sweat ain’t hurt nobody [...] Don't just stand there on the wall, <b>everybody</b> <b>just</b> move your body, move your body, move your body." [...] The song is a step-by-step flash dance-style workout that combines elements of hip hop music, Latin music as well as dancehall moves with traditional exercise. Nicole James of MTV Buzzworthy described [...] "Move Your Body" [...] as a [...] "kid-friendlier" [...] version {{of the original}}. Risa Dixon of Newsday praised the reworked version, calling it [...] "a fun, yet cardio-intensive workout song to get young people excited about exercising." ...|$|E
500|$|To {{revive the}} fervor of punk, which the band felt was being {{distorted}} by new wave, the Idles sought {{to look as}} intimidating as possible. They shaved their heads, grew mohawks and wore various punk accessories. Nelson and MacKaye even drove thumbtacks into the soles of their boots so they would make an [...] "ominous clacking" [...] sound when they walked. The band's visual presentation was at odds with their demeanor; according to MacKaye, [...] "In our shows and within our own community, we were totally goofy guys. We were painfully honest — we didn't shoplift, we didn't vandalize, we didn't spray-paint. [...] We don't do anything — <b>everybody</b> <b>just</b> hates us {{because of the way}} we look".|$|E
2500|$|During 2008, {{many people}} {{questioned}} {{the future of}} Godsmack, and rumors began swirling. Sully Erna put those rumors to rest, stating [...] "The band's in great shape. We're getting along wonderfully, and there's no problems whatsoever. We all know this is an entity we can't just shut down; it's gonna continue to go, and <b>everybody's</b> <b>just</b> kinda doing something on the side that's...a little different than what we'd do from Godsmack." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, that's {{all there}} is of us at present," [...] said Mrs. Munger, coming down the main road with her from the last place, [...] "and you see just what we are. It's a {{neighbourhood}} where <b>everybody's</b> <b>just</b> adapted to <b>everybody</b> else. It's not a mere mush of concession, as Emerson says; people are perfectly outspoken; but there's the greatest good feeling, and no vulgar display, or lavish expenditure, or--anything." ...|$|R

500|$|Their {{chartered}} yacht, the MV Arvi, {{was detained}} in Crete {{because of bad}} weather, so the party had to wait in Athens for three days. Taylor complained that {{on a trip to}} a small hill village, [...] "We came round a corner of the peaceful road only to find hundreds of photographers clicking away at us", which Mardas had organised. McCartney later said that while sailing around Greek islands, <b>everybody</b> <b>just</b> sat around and took LSD. They eventually found the [...] island of Leslo, which had a small fishing village, four beaches and a large olive grove. Four small neighbouring islands surrounded it (which were planned as one for each Beatle) so the island was bought for £95,000 (with a 25% premium); but it was sold for a modest profit a few months later, after all four Beatles lost interest in the idea.|$|E
500|$|After the filming, Burton {{said of the}} cast, [...] "All I can say is {{this is one of}} {{the best}} casts I've ever worked with. These people are not {{professional}} singers, so to do a musical like this which I think is one of the most difficult musicals, they all went for it. Every day on the set was a very, very special thing for me. Hearing all these guys sing, I don't know if I can ever have an experience like that again."" [...] Burton said of the singing, [...] "You can't just lip synch, you'd see the throat and the breath, every take they all had to belt it out. It was very enjoyable for me to see, with music on the set <b>everybody</b> <b>just</b> moved differently. I'd seen Johnny (Depp) act in a way I'd never seen before, walking across the room or sitting in the chair, picking up a razor or making a pie, whatever. They all did it in a way that you could sense." ...|$|E
500|$|While Cox {{was working}} with Deerhunter to produce Cryptograms, it was {{considered}} Kranky policy to not print the lyrics of an album in its liner notes. [...] This was a rule enforced by label owner Joel Leoschke, who believed the practice [...] "demystifi {{the experience of a}} rock record." [...] Despite largely agreeing with this sentiment, Cox chose to print the lyrics of Let the Blind Lead, in part because he wanted to [...] "see what they looked like," [...] having ad-libbed the words of every song on their first take. [...] In an interview with Pitchfork Media, Cox described the lyrical origins of each song on Let the Blind Lead; they are largely autobiographical in nature, reflecting life experiences of his. The song [...] "Recent Bedroom" [...] conveys an experience Cox had when his aunt died: [...] "She was in her bedroom, and everybody knew she was about to pass away, and she went out, she faded out, and <b>everybody</b> <b>just</b> started crying." [...] Although he was [...] "overwhelmed" [...] by her death, it did not bring him to tears like the rest of his family. This event is expressed in the song by the lines [...] "I walked outside, I could not cry / I don’t know, I don’t know why". [...] Cox’s inability to cry stemmed from his having been [...] "very involved in drugs" [...] at the time, which he believes eliminated his [...] "childhood instinct…to cry." [...] The song attempts to communicate an emotional vacancy and sense of detachment characterized by [...] "moving from childhood to adolescence".|$|E
6000|$|<b>Everybody</b> nodded. <b>Just</b> then Chatterer the Red Squirrel shouted, [...] "Here comes Unc' Billy, Ol' Mrs. Possum and all {{the little}} Possums." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2010, he was videotaped {{while working}} {{security}} for a site {{related to the}} BP oil spill. Mateen said of those working on the cleanup: [...] "Nobody gives a shit here. <b>Everybody's</b> <b>just,</b> get out to get paid. They're like hoping for more oil {{to come out and}} more people to complain so they'll have jobs. They want more disaster to happen." [...] Video of his comments were included in a 2012 documentary, The Big Fix.|$|R
5000|$|Throughout the story, Heinlein {{takes the}} view of the {{objective}} narrator when describing Venusian society. [...] "Logic of Empire" [...] places different rationales on the people who participate in slavery. There are no real villains; <b>everybody's</b> <b>just</b> doing their job, trying to maximize income in a mercantalist system. Even the plantation owner who owns the hero is portrayed as a struggling — and failing — small businessman, whose main motivation is to secure a livelihood for his daughter.|$|R
2500|$|Hancock said of Shorter's {{tenure in}} the group: [...] "The master writer to me, in that group, was Wayne Shorter. He {{still is a}} master. Wayne {{was one of the}} few people who brought music to Miles that didn't get changed." [...] Davis said, [...] "Wayne is a real composer. He writes scores, write the parts for <b>everybody</b> <b>just</b> as he wants them to sound. ... Wayne also brought in a kind of curiosity about working with musical rules. If they didn't work, then he broke them, but with musical sense; he {{understood}} that freedom in music was the ability to know the rules in order to bend them to your own satisfaction and taste." ...|$|E
2500|$|Speaker of the House John Boehner, a Republican Representative from Ohio, {{told reporters}} that {{throughout}} November [...] "more Americans {{are going to lose}} their health care than are going to sign up." [...] Ohio Governor John Kasich stated on NBC's Meet the Press program on October 27 that the roll-out has [...] "got <b>everybody</b> <b>just</b> shaking their heads". He also added that it seemed highly likely that most Ohioans would pay more on the HealthCare.gov plans. Kentucky Governor Steve Beshear counter-argued that while the website didn't work well yet that it soon would since HealthCare.gov represents [...] "the future of health care", and he commented as well, [...] "You know, the advice I would give the news media and the critics up here is take a deep breath." ...|$|E
2500|$|In November 2013, Schoolboy Q {{expressed}} he {{felt there}} were no more gangsta rappers. In an interview, Schoolboy Q discussed his status as a gangsta rapper: [...] "I'm not one of them rappers that's scared to put a title on their name," [...] Schoolboy Q said during an interview with MTV." [...] Conscious rappers never like to be called conscious rappers and a lyrical rapper never like to be a party rapper. I'm a gangsta rapper, that's who I am. I happen to make fun records at the same time, that's what I do. I joke, I bag on niggas, my personality is like that, but I am a gangsta rapper and that's what I'm gonna bring to the table." [...] During the interview, Schoolboy Q then added that gangsta rappers are nowhere to be found today: [...] "There's no more gangsta rappers. It's just trap music now. So I wanna get that old feeling back that I do naturally. I'm not necessarily trying to bring gangsta rap back. I'm just trying to let you know it's still here and I'm a part of it. I feel like I'm the only one out of the coast that's doing this gangsta rap shit the way that it used to be done...how niggas used to put detail in their music, not just going to the club and turning up." [...] Schoolboy Q said {{that he is going to}} bring that style in Oxymoron: [...] "I'm just telling my story and what I grew up around and what I seen and what I did and I wanna put that in the light instead of <b>everybody</b> <b>just</b> smiling. Like Eminem said, 'Whatever happened to wildin' out and being violent? / Whatever happened to catchin a good-ol' fashioned passionate ass-whoopin' and getting your shoes coat and your hat tooken?' [...] "I'm one of them niggas," [...] Schoolboy Q continued. [...] "Whatever happened to that? I don't want niggas to get beat up or no shit like that, but at the end of the day, that is a part of life and I like that type of music. That's what pushed West Coast music to where it was at like when Dre, Snoop and all them...Dogg Pound. That's what they was doin' and that's what they was talking about and that's what I was raised off of." ...|$|E

5000|$|Regarding The Fruit Tree Foundation's future, Jones noted, [...] "I don’t want {{to limit}} The Fruit Tree Foundation project to being just another indie project.

6000|$|... "Oh, well, if I am {{expected}} to, I suppose I must," [...] Graham sighed. [...] "But {{just the}} same I hate to do whatever <b>everybody</b> does <b>just</b> because <b>everybody</b> does it. But if it's the custom--well, it's the custom, that's all. But it's mighty hard on one with so many other nice girls around." ...|$|R

5000|$|... "He thinks everyone's got {{at least}} one number one hit in them,'" [...] says Cooper, his long-time writing partner, in a 2004 Observer Music Monthly article.

50|$|Central to Faltins teachings is that {{entrepreneurship}} {{today is}} available to <b>everybody,</b> not <b>just</b> for those with capital and patents. He dissociates clearly entrepreneurship from business administration.

By using ready-made components a founder could even challenge big companies.|$|R
5000|$|The album's {{title was}} a {{reflection}} of the success Snaith received after the release of Swim.

[...] The album features contributions from Jessy Lanza and Owen Pallett.|$|R

[...] He had forgotten completely the kindness the Rover boys had shown him, and how they had gone {{to the head of the}} college and pleaded for him, so that he had been allowed to remain at Brill. Perhaps Flockley was not as wicked at heart as his former college cronies, Larkspur and Koswell, but he was equally ungrateful.|$|E
6000|$|... "So I, Ebbits, journeyed down to Cambell Fort {{to collect}} the debt. Jones, who is chief trader, looked at me, and he laughed. He made great laughter, and would not give payment. I went to the medicine-man, what you call missionary, and had large talk about the bad water and the payment that should be mine. And the missionary made talk about other things. He talk about where Moklan has gone, now he is dead. There be large fires in that place, and if missionary make true talk, I know that Moklan will be cold no more. Also the missionary talk about where I shall go when I am dead. And he say bad things. He say that I am blind. Which is a lie. He say that I am in great {{darkness}}. Which is a lie. And I say that the day come and the night come for <b>everybody</b> <b>just</b> the same, and that in my village {{it is no more}} dark than at Cambell Fort. Also, I say that darkness and light and where we go when we die be different things from the matter of payment of just debt for bad water.

And so I come back from Cambell Fort, and no payment has been made, and Moklan is dead, and in my old age I am without fish and meat." ...|$|E
6000|$|Nat {{he jumped}} in {{and slammed the}} door, and away they went a-ripping and a-tearing over the roughest road a body ever see, and the racket of it was {{something}} awful.

He was horrible scared, but he laid into his work for all he was worth, and hung tight to the arm-loops and made his legs fairly fly. He yelled and shouted to the driver to stop, and so did the crowds along the street, for they could see his legs spinning along under the coach, and his head and shoulders bobbing inside through the windows, and he was in awful danger; but the more they all shouted the more the nigger whooped and yelled and lashed the horses and shouted, [...] "Don't you fret, I'se gwine to git you dah in time, boss; I's gwine to do it, sho'!" [...] for you see he thought they were all hurrying him up, and, of course, he couldn't hear anything for the racket he was making. And so they went ripping along, and <b>everybody</b> <b>just</b> petrified to see it; and {{when they got to the}} Capitol at last it was the quickest trip that ever was made, and everybody said so. The horses laid down, and Nat dropped, all tuckered out, and he was all dust and rags and barefooted; but he was in time and just in time, and caught the President and give him the letter, and everything was all right, and the President give him a free pardon on the spot, and Nat give the nigger two extra quarters instead of one, because he could see that if he hadn't had the hack he wouldn't'a' got there in time, nor anywhere near it.|$|E
