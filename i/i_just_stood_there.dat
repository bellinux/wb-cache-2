So when the day of my first performance came close there were no requisites left anymore. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> and talked to the audience.

5000|$|Merezhkovsky {{started working}} upon the novel {{in the summer}} of 1890. The process was boosted by the Merezhkovskys European 1892 trip when the couple visited Greece and Turkey. Merezhkovsky’s first {{impressions}} of Greece were not favourable but everything changed as he found himself facing the sacred hill of Acropolis. One glance for me was enough to see everything - Acropol, Parthenon, Propylaea and be overwhelmed by the feeling that will stay with me till my dying day. The joy poured into my soul, that of this instant escape from life that Beauty provides us. Pathetic worries over money, the unbearable heat, the tiredness from the journey, the weight of modern day petty skepticism - all this evapourised. Bewildered, almost out of my mind, I was standing there, repeating again and again: My God, what is that? ... And, as always happened in the most significant, singular moments of my life, I received this impression that all this I've seen and lived through, not by books. I was staring and remembering all those things that were familiar and close to my heart. ... For {{the first time in my}} life I understood what Beauty was. Without any prevailing idea or a wish, neither crying nor rejoicing, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there,</b> feeling very calm. On return, the couple found themselves in serious financial difficulties. [...] "We literally have nothing to eat and we've pawned our wedding rings," [...] Zinaida Gippius complained in one of her 1894 letters.

Hundreds of people rushed to the scene where they formed human chains to help the British Army and Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) free those trapped beneath the rubble by digging with their bare hands.

One witness was Billy McQuiston, who had been walking down the Shankill with a friend {{when they heard the}} blast. Rushing to the scene, McQuiston later recounted what he saw and felt upon reaching the wrecked building:"Women were crying. Men were trying to dig out the rubble. Other men were hitting the walls. One person was crying beside you and the next person was shouting 'Bastards' and things like that. I didn't actually see the babies' bodies as they had them wrapped in sheets, but the blood was just coming right through them. They were just like lumps of meat, you know, small lumps of meat.

5000|$|During World War I, he {{accompanied}} {{his father}} on many railroad trips that took him all across the country, to destinations including San Francisco, Los Angeles, Hoboken, Atlanta and Philadelphia. It was this exposure to life outside Chicago that led to Motley's encounters with race prejudice in many forms. In his oral history interview with Dennis Barrie working for the Smithsonian Archive of American Art, Motley related this encounter with a streetcar conductor in Atlanta, Georgia:I wasn't {{supposed to go to}} the front. So I was reading the paper and walking along, after a while I found myself {{in the front of the}} car. The conductor was in the back and he yelled, [...] "Come back here you so-and-so" [...] using very vile language, [...] "you come back here. You must be one of those smart'uns from up in Chicago or New York or somewhere." [...] It just came to me then and I felt like a fool. I was never white in my life but I think I turned white. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> and held the newspaper down and looked at him. I walked back there. Then he got so nasty, he began to curse me out and call me all kinds of names using very degrading language. I just couldn't take it. And he made me very, very angry. I used to have quite a temper.Motley's was often considered “ethnically ambiguous” as a result of his multiracial background. Consequently, he never truly felt that he belonged to any particular group. Thus, this marked the inception of Motley’s ability to see race as a diverse spectacle. His social status made him hyper aware of the socioeconomic and sociocultural boundaries of race.|$|E

5000|$|In {{front of}} 27,000 fans in attendance, Brook lost his IBF welterweight title after being stopped in round 11. In a fight where mostly power shots were landed, Spence threw {{combinations}} {{to the head}} {{and more to the}} body, wearing down Brook. Brook did well working the counter, and landed his own shots to the body, but Spence came back with his own shots. In round 10, Spence, having Brook against the ropes unloaded some heavy power shots, which caused Brook to take a knee. In round 11, before the fight was stopped, Brook motioned many times that he couldn't see through his left eye and voluntarily took a knee, again counting as a knockdown. The referee started the 10 count which Brook couldn't make, giving him back to back defeats and his first as a welterweight. His trainer Dominic Ingle was also on the apron before the fight was officially stopped. At the time of stoppage, all three judges had Spence ahead on their scorecards (97-92, 96-93, 95-94). In the post-fight interview, Brook credited Spence admitting he lost to the better boxer, “It was a very tough fight. I would say Spence {{is one of the best}} kids I’ve been in with, if not the best. I got caught in the seventh round, in the eye, and it felt like the same as in the Golovkin fight. Probably not as bad as that time, but I was getting hit on it over the rounds and it was getting worse. The last round, he caught me in it and <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there,</b> double vision, and I couldn't see out of the eye ... so I had to stop.” Spence landed 246 of 633 punches thrown (39%) whilst Brook landed 136 of 442 (31%). The fight was shown in the afternoon in the US on Showtime and averaged 291,000 viewers, peaking at 337,000 viewers. This was considered low numbers, even for an afternoon showing, possibly due to it being a holiday weekend. Brook spoke to Sky Sports the following day and confirmed that a CT scan showed he had broken his eye socket, meaning he would likely have surgery.|$|E
