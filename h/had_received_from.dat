5|$|In 1850, the Duchess of Kent's new comptroller, Sir George Couper, {{studied the}} old accounts. He found huge discrepancies.

5|$|After {{several months}} of poor health, Suramarit, Sihanouk's father, died on 3April 1960 which Sihanouk blamed upon the shock that his father <b>had</b> <b>received</b> <b>from</b> the parcel bomb attack. The {{following}} day, the royal throne council met to choose Monireth as regent. Over the next two months, Sihanouk introduced constitutional amendments to create the new post of Head of State of Cambodia, which provided ceremonial powers equivalent {{to that of the}} king. A referendum held on 5June 1960 approved Sihanouk's proposals, and Sihanouk was formally appointed Head of State on 14June 1960. As the head of state, Sihanouk took over various ceremonial responsibilities of the king, such as holding public audiences and leading the Royal Ploughing Ceremony. At the same time, he continued to play an active role in politics as Sangkum's leader.|$|E
5|$|Day {{focussed}} on the girls' education, in {{the style}} of Emile. He expanded on the teaching they <b>had</b> <b>received</b> <b>from</b> the Foundling Hospital in reading and basic arithmetic, and also taught them how to write. He believed that the girls should be able to manage the house, so they were charged with cooking and cleaning as well as other housework. Finally, he {{wanted to be able to}} debate complex concepts with them, so he taught them rudimentary theories in physics and geography, tasking them with observing the changing of the seasons, and recording details of sunrises and sunsets. He also imparted to them Rousseau's philosophical contempt for luxury.|$|E
5|$|In early 1996, former FBI hostage {{negotiator}} {{and criminal}} profiler Clinton R. Van Zandt was contacted by an investigator working with Bisceglie. Bisceglie asked Van Zandt {{to compare the}} manifesto to typewritten copies of handwritten letters David <b>had</b> <b>received</b> <b>from</b> his brother. Van Zandt's initial analysis determined that there was better than a 60 percent chance that the same person had written the letters {{as well as the}} manifesto, which had been in public circulation for half a year. Van Zandt's second analytical team determined an even higher likelihood that the letters and the manifesto were the product of the same author. He recommended that Bisceglie's client immediately contact the FBI.|$|E

This achievement was {{due in part to the}} mainstream promotional efforts Modern Sounds <b>had</b> <b>received</b> <b>from</b> ABC prior to and following release. The album proved to be a crossover hit as well, as distributors claimed the record had been selling in pop, R and country music markets; at the time, often referred to as white and black markets during the period.|$|E
5|$|Rubin was {{inspired}} to pursue an undergraduate education at the currently all-women's school, Vassar College, because Maria Mitchell had been a professor there. She also ignored advice she <b>had</b> <b>received</b> <b>from</b> a high school science teacher to avoid a scientific career and become an artist. She earned her bachelor's degree in astronomy in 1948, the only graduate in astronomy that year. She attempted to enroll in a graduate program at Princeton, but was barred due to her gender. Princeton would not accept women as astronomy graduate students for 27 more years. Rubin also turned down an offer from Harvard University due to her husband, Robert Rubin's, position {{as a graduate student}} at Cornell University.|$|E
5|$|Wat'ul Chatel's last {{monument}} {{was erected}} in 889. This stela {{is also the}} last dated monument raised at Seibal and by 900 the city was all but abandoned, the whole region had been engulfed by the Classic Maya collapse and trade no longer flowed along the Pasión-Usumacinta route. Most Classic Maya capitals had already been abandoned and whatever external support Seibal <b>had</b> <b>received</b> <b>from</b> its overlord had vanished. By 930 AD, the site was completely abandoned. It was left relatively undisturbed until around 1890 when Federico Artes was informed of the city’s ruins.|$|E

5|$|Caesar {{was assassinated}} in March 44 BC. The motives of the conspirators were both personal, as well as political. Many of Caesar's {{ultimate}} assassins were envious of him, and dissatisfied with the recognition that they <b>had</b> <b>received</b> <b>from</b> him. Most of the conspirators were senators, {{and many of them}} were angry {{about the fact that he}} had deprived the senate of much of its power and prestige. They were also angry that, while they had received few honors, Caesar had been given many honors. There were also rumors that he was going to make himself king, and transfer the seat of government to Alexandria. The grievances that they held against him were vague, and as such, their plan against him was vague. The fact that their motives were vague, and that they had no idea of what to do after his assassination, both were plainly obvious by the subsequent course of events.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{generally}} satisfactory {{situation in}} Venice, Monteverdi experienced personal problems {{from time to}} time. He was on one occasion – probably because of his wide network of contacts – {{the subject of an}} anonymous denunciation to the Venetian authorities alleging that he supported the Habsburgs. He was also subject to anxieties about his children. His son Francesco, while a student of law at Padua in 1619, was spending in Monteverdi's opinion too much time with music, and he therefore moved him to the University of Bologna. This did not have the required result, and it seems that Monteverdi resigned himself to Francesco having a musical career – he joined the choir of San Marco in 1623. His other son Massimiliano, who graduated in medicine, was arrested by the Inquisition in Mantua in 1627 for reading forbidden literature. Monteverdi was obliged to sell the necklace he <b>had</b> <b>received</b> <b>from</b> Duchess Caterina to pay for his son's (eventually successful) defence. Monteverdi wrote at the time to Striggio seeking his help, and fearing that Massimiliano might be subject to torture; it seems that Striggio's intervention was helpful. Money worries at this time also led Monteverdi to visit Cremona to secure for himself a church canonry.|$|E
5|$|In 1926, the German Navy adopted, as its top {{cryptographic}} device, {{a modified}} civilian Enigma machine; in 1928 the German Army followed suit. The {{complexity of the}} system was much increased in 1930 {{by the introduction of}} a plugboard (Steckerbrett), albeit with only six connecting leads in use. In December 1932, Marian Rejewski made what historian David Kahn describes {{as one of the greatest}} advances in cryptologic history, by applying pure mathematicsthe theory of permutations and groupsto breaking the German armed forces' Enigma machine ciphers. Rejewski had worked out the precise interconnections of the Enigma rotors and reflector, after the Bureau <b>had</b> <b>received,</b> <b>from</b> French Military Intelligence Captain Gustave Bertrand, two German documents and two pages of Enigma daily keys (for September and October of that year). These had been obtained by a French military intelligence agent, a German codenamed Rex, from an agent who worked at Germany's Cipher Office in Berlin, Hans-Thilo Schmidt, whom the French codenamed Asché.|$|E

5|$|In the meantime, the Waffen-SS had {{suffered}} over 43,000 casualties up to February 1942, {{particularly in the}} Battle of Moscow, and Berger had to replace them. Berger next {{turned his attention to}} the Hungarian Volksdeutsche. Through an agreement with the Royal Hungarian Army, his recruiters enlisted more than 16,500 ethnic German recruits from Hungary between March and May 1942. While this campaign was ongoing, on 20 April 1942 Berger was promoted to SS-Gruppenführer. At this point, he saw a significant difference between SS ideological leadership and the martial indoctrination conducted by the German Army. In September 1942, the SS-FHA complained bitterly about Berger's recruiters, stating that many of the recruits were medically unsuitable, had been coerced or duped into enlisting, or were in fact ethnic Hungarians. Late in 1942, more Volksdeutsche from the Banat and Romania were combined with the SS Cavalry Brigade to form the SS-Kavallerie-Division. On 24 November 1942, the Chief of the Gestapo, Heinrich Müller advised Himmler of a proposal he <b>had</b> <b>received</b> <b>from</b> Berger that a Hungarian SS division could be financed by selling emigration permits to Slovak Jews.|$|E
5|$|Outside of his ministerial duties, he {{also met}} with Jiang Zhenghua, Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, having led the {{official}} Antiguan delegation to Beijing. Following a power struggle in 2003, Joseph was given the Economic Development and Investment Promotion portfolio, to hold {{at the same time}} as his Tourism and the Environment position. Despite a scandal surrounding donations he <b>had</b> <b>received</b> <b>from</b> Texan businessman Robert Stafford, Joseph was selected to contest the seat of St Mary's North in the 2004 Antiguan general election, in which the ALP lost power, being replaced in government by the United Progressive Party (UPP) led by Baldwin Spencer. Joseph himself lost his seat, but was elected Chairman of the ALP a year later, and regained the seat in 2009 with a majority of 21. The same year, he was arrested for participating in an unauthorised May Day rally protesting the UPP administration; after a lengthy trial, he and several other ALP members were convicted and fined.|$|E
5|$|Personnel {{from local}} Viet Cong units {{infiltrated}} Kontum and Pleiku to spread rumours of a ‘big Communist offensive’ on the aforementioned districts. In {{response to the}} rumours, the ARVN 45th Infantry Regiment was sent out to sweep the areas near Ban Me Thuot, Thuan Man, and Duc Lap. To maintain the secrecy of their operations, the North Vietnamese Tay Nguyen Front ordered the 320A Infantry Division, which had by then set up camp west of Ban Me Thuot, to avoid contact with the South Vietnamese. Upon their arrival from Laos, the 316th Infantry Division received similar orders, and {{was not allowed to}} open fire under any circumstances. As the events in South Vietnam’s II Corps Tactical Zone were beginning to unfold, intelligence reports from Saigon continued to warn General Phu of an imminent Communist onslaught on Ban Me Thuot. Despite the numerous warnings which he <b>had</b> <b>received</b> <b>from</b> the CIA and his own military intelligence, General Phu remained convinced that Pleiku would be North Vietnam’s next target.|$|E
