5|$|Given the {{unexpected}} size of German forces closed off in Stalingrad, on 23 November Stavka (Soviet Armed Forces High Command) decided {{to strengthen the}} outer encirclement preparing to destroy Axis forces {{in and around the}} city. On 24 November, several Soviet formations began to entrench themselves to defend against possible German incursions originating from the West. The Soviets also reinforced the encircling forces in order to prevent a successful breakout operation by the German 6th Army and other Axis units. However, this tied down over ½ of the Red Army's strength in the area. Planning <b>for</b> <b>Operation</b> Saturn began on 25 November, aiming for the destruction of the Italian 8th Army and the severing of communications between German forces west of the Don River and those operating in the Caucasus. Meanwhile, planning also began <b>for</b> <b>Operation</b> Koltso (Ring), which aimed at reducing German forces in the Stalingrad pocket.|$|E

5|$|In {{his role}} as Controller of Atomic Energy, Morgan was present <b>for</b> <b>Operation</b> Hurricane, the first British atomic weapons tests at the Montebello Islands in October 1952. His {{position}} was gradually reduced to a figurehead, with his authority largely supplanted by the Atomic Energy Board, which was chaired by Lord Cherwell, and was abolished in 1954 {{with the creation of}} the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority. Morgan then became Controller of Nuclear Weapons. Nonetheless, he was still an important figure in the push for higher-yield weapons. He pressed for the testing of the Green Bamboo boosted fission weapon during Operation Mosaic. This resulted in Mosaic becoming a two-test series, although Green Bamboo could not be made available in time. A Green Bamboo assembly was subsequently taken to Christmas Island <b>for</b> <b>Operation</b> Grapple, but was deleted from the test series to save money. Morgan was also instrumental in putting the case {{for the development of the}} H-bomb on operational grounds.|$|E
