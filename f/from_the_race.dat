5|$|As {{the riders}} entered the flat lands near the Belgian coast, the winds became more problematic. Around {{three-quarters of the}} peloton had been dropped or had {{withdrawn}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>race</b> {{by the time the}} riders turned back inland. Gert Steegmans (Trek Factory Racing) was blown sideways into a ditch; the wind knocked several other riders over and caused Martin Velits (Etixx-Quick Step) and Lars Bak (Lotto-Soudal) to withdraw <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>race.</b> Mark Cavendish crashed and was forced to chase to attempt to rejoin the leading riders. The conditions were so severe that some team officials called for the race to be neutralised to ensure the riders' safety. Shortly afterwards, two large groups came back together. The main peloton was therefore made up of around 100 riders and was approximately two minutes behind the breakaway. The breakaway was caught soon afterwards.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to her Democratic opponent, Roberts faced unaffiliated write-in candidate Christopher Navage. Navage withdrew <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>race</b> in October 2006 and endorsed Colgan. Roberts significantly outraised her opponents, donating over $8,000 to her own campaign, and ultimately winning the November 2006 general election with 52 percent of the vote.|$|E

But in the Iowa speech that was recorded and distributed to reporters (with a parallel video of Kinnock) by aides to Michael Dukakis, the eventual nominee, he failed to do so. Dukakis, who disowned any knowledge of the Kinnock video, fired John Sasso, his campaign manager and long-time Chief of Staff, but Biden's campaign could not recover.|$|E

5|$|As a {{consequence}} of the race, Hamilton extended his lead in the World Drivers' Championship to be seven points ahead of Button. This ensured the pair would enter the next, and their home race - the British Grand Prix - as first and second in the championship. Vettel's victory moved him up to third in standings; he became six points behind Button after surpassing the totals of teammate Mark Webber and Fernando Alonso. By gaining the most points <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>race,</b> McLaren extended their lead in the World Constructors' Championship to thirty over Red Bull.|$|E
5|$|Following Mark Warner's {{withdrawal}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>race</b> in October, Bayh {{looked to}} gain {{the most in the}} field of candidates. He immediately began to call former Warner supporters, hoping they would support his campaign. During a visit to New Albany, Indiana, the candidate called for the 9/11 Commission's recommendations to be enacted. Later in the month, he made a stop in Nevada to discuss senior issues with Nevada's gubernatorial candidate Dina Titus.|$|E
5|$|For the 1965 Formula One season, Rindt {{signed as}} a {{permanent}} driver with Cooper, paired with Bruce McLaren. He was not immediately successful as Cooper, formerly a top team, were struggling at the time. In his first race, the 1965 South African Grand Prix, he developed transistor trouble; the damage was initially repaired but the problem recurred and Rindt had to retire <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>race.</b> His best result was a fourth place at the German Grand Prix at the Nürburgring. He ended the season with four points, 13th in the championship.|$|E

5|$|Giovinazzi quickly caught Marciello and overtook him (with {{the help}} of DRS and drafting) {{at the start of}} lap 18 to take over the lead. Giovinazzi began to pull away from Maricello. The safety car was {{deployed}} for the fourth (and final) time after Nato attempted to pass teammate King around the inside and retired <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>race</b> having been squeezed into the turn three barrier by him. The area was cleared of Nato's damaged car over the next five laps which meant the race would finish under a time limit. Giovinazzi accelerated as late as possible to limit the slipstream effect and remained the leader at the lap-25 restart despite locking-up his tyres heading into the first turn. King retired <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>race</b> following contact with Eriksson. Giovinazzi remained the leader for the remaining two laps to clinch his first, and his team's maiden, victory in the GP2 Series. Siroktin overtook Rowland for third place and clinched second position from Marciello by drafting behind him on the start/finish straight. Rowland finished in fourth place, ahead of Evans and Matsushita whom he defended from in the final two laps. Gelael, de Jong, Ghiotto, and Malja rounded out the point-scoring positions. Eriksson and King were the last of the classified finishers. The attrition race was high, with ten drivers reaching the end of the race.|$|E
5|$|He withdrew <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>race</b> on March 30 {{after his}} {{hospitalization}} for a concussion sustained {{in a fall}} against a bathtub in late February; an inner-ear injury from the accident left him unable to campaign. Both his wife and Scott Carpenter campaigned on his behalf during February and March, but doctors gave Glenn a recovery time of one year. Glenn {{did not want to}} win solely due to his astronaut fame, so he dropped out of the race on March 31.|$|E
5|$|In August 1844, in {{the midst}} of the campaign, Tyler withdrew <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>race.</b> The Democratic Party was by then {{unequivocally}} committed to Texas annexation, and Tyler, assured by Polk's envoys that as President he would effect Texas annexation, urged his supporters to vote Democratic. Polk narrowly defeated Whig Henry Clay in the November election. The victorious Democrats were poised to acquire Texas under President-elect Polk's doctrine of Manifest Destiny, rather than on the pro-slavery agenda of Tyler and Calhoun.|$|E
