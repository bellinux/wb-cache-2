5|$|The Old Swiss Confederacy in the 17th {{century was}} a {{federation}} of thirteen largely independent cantons. The federation comprised rural cantons {{as well as}} city states that had expanded their territories into the countryside by political and military means {{at the cost of}} the previously ruling liege lords. The cities <b>just</b> <b>took</b> over the preexisting administrative structures. In these city cantons, the city councils ruled the countryside; they held the judicial rights and also appointed the district sheriffs (Landvögte).|$|E
5|$|There {{was a scene}} were I {{was lying}} on the ground, {{appearing}} to be dead, in a Lodger-esque pose and we had a camera with a big weather balloon filled with helium hooked up to it… the first one we did, we started the film, I was laying on the ground and the ropes that were holding the balloon snapped, the camera <b>just</b> <b>took</b> off into the atmosphere… the camera landed two hundred miles away in a farmer's field somewhere. He finds it and takes it to the police, thinking that it's a surveillance camera for marijuana, they develop the film and think that it's some sort of snuff film of a murder, give it to the FBI and have pathologists looking at the body saying, 'yeah, he's rotting,' (I had corn starch on me, right) 'he's been decomposing for 3 weeks.' You could see {{the other members of the}} band walking away and they had these weird outfits on, and they thought it was some kind of gang slaying.|$|E

25|$|As MacKenzie's layout {{was seen}} by more and more people, a {{collective}} shudder ran through the office (but) MacKenzie's dominance was so total there was nobody left in the organisation who could rein him in except Murdoch. (Everyone in the office) seemed paralysed—"looking like rabbits in the headlights"—as one hack described them. The error staring them in the face was too glaring. It obviously wasn't a silly mistake; nor was it a simple oversight. Nobody really had any comment on it—they <b>just</b> <b>took</b> one look and went away shaking their heads in wonder at the enormity of it. It was a 'classic smear'.|$|E
25|$|Rain intervened on {{both the}} first two days at Riverside, {{limiting}} play to 56.1 overs, compared to the expected 200 on fine days, and that was probably a major cause of the drawn game. Durham ground their way to 260 for 3 amid the rain, however, Michael Hussey smashing five sixes in his third Championship century of the season, for 146 runs. David Masters was the star of the third day, though, completing a six-wicket-haul as Durham lost their last seven wickets for 55 runs to end with a first-innings total of 315. In reply, Liam Plunkett took two early wickets, but Dinesh Mongia's unbeaten 77 saw Leicestershire to stumps on day three - still trailing by 98 runs with seven wickets in hand. Leicestershire batted on for 50 overs on day four, Gareth Breese taking five for 91 as Leicestershire were bowled out for 443, while Mongia notched up 29 boundaries in his only first-class century of the season, finishing with 164 before he was stumped off Breese. With 50 overs remaining and one innings to go for both sides, Durham <b>just</b> <b>took</b> their time at the crease as batting practice, Hussey boosting his batting average with 61 not out.|$|E
25|$|But in {{this right}} moment, Görgei {{learned that the}} enemy <b>just</b> <b>took</b> Királyrév. This {{happened}} when he sent the orders to his cavalries to attack, and during the strong advancement of his right wing. Because of this he went personally with two infantry battalions and two cannons of the Hungarian II. corps {{to take back the}} village. Görgei wanted also to see if it is any enemy troops coming from the direction of Csallóköz. After he saw that his troops will not be attacked from there - because Klapka managed to hold the position there, he returned to the main battlefield, letting the two infantry battalions which he had led to Királyrév to continue the assault on the village. When he was returning, he saw that the attack of the cavalry of the III. corps on the right wing failed, and they were retreating, he understood that his plan of turning back the front line in the original position did not succeeded. Now he wanted to obtain this goal ordering the retreat of the infantry of the III. corps. He wanted that his troops to resist in Pered until the hoped arrival of Nagysándor's I. corps, which could decide the outcome of the battle in the favor of the Hungarians. He hoped to hold the village {{with the help of the}} III. corps of Leiningen, who retreated towards there. But when görgei arrived to Pered, saw that Colonel Kászonyi already ordered the retreat of the II. corps, and in the village he found only the cavalry of the III. corps. Görgei had no choice, than to position the III. and II. corps infantries behind Pered in order to hold themselves there. To hold their new front line successfully, Görgei ordered that Leiningen's III. corps cavalry division and four battalions to stop the advancement of the imperial cavalry from the right side of the enemy center, and the cavalry of the II. division which previously were held back by the Russian infantry division, to attack the enemy troops advancing from the extreme right wing of Wohlgemuth's army, in order to ease the tasks of the II. corps infantry and the III. corps cavalry. He also ordered, that if the III. corps would be pushed back, it can retreat only to Zsigárd, where they should take the artillery of the II. corps, which retreated there because their shortage of ammunition, and to hold there until Királyrév is recaptured. Colonel Kászonyi with the II. corps had to defend the III. corps left from an encirclement and to keep the contact with the troops from Királyrév. If this village would be reoccupied, than the two Hungarian corps had to start another offensive, helped by the troops from Királyrév. This was Görgei's new plan.|$|E

What I admired so much about Lewis Gilbert was that he <b>just</b> <b>took</b> the screenplay and shot it. That's the way to direct: You either trust your writer or you don't." ...|$|E

Rapinoe would later convert her shot during the penalty shootout to help send the United States to the semifinals. Rapinoe described her last minute cross against Brazil: [...] "I <b>just</b> <b>took</b> a touch and friggin' smacked it with my left foot. I don't think I've hit a ball like that with my left foot.

[...] Goldwater strongly supported the 1980 presidential campaign of Reagan, who had become the face of the conservative movement after his Time for Choosing speech. Reagan reflected many of the principles of Goldwater's earlier run in his campaign.

We <b>just</b> <b>took</b> our time and got together in two-week blocks of time - any longer than that I'm sure we would have started getting on each others' nerves.
