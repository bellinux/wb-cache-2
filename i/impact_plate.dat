5000|$|Several factors {{affect the}} {{accuracy}} of the calibration beyond the calibration itself. Build up of material on the <b>impact</b> <b>plate</b> can cause the load cell response to be dampened to impacting grain, reducing the load cell response. Wear on the <b>impact</b> <b>plate</b> can also cause reduction in accuracy of a calibration. [...] The chain tension of the clean grain elevator affects the velocity at which grain is expelled from the elevator which changes the force that is applied at the <b>impact</b> <b>plate.</b> Manufacturers often advise properly tensioning the clean grain elevator before calibrating the grain yield monitor. [...] Excessive wear of the clean grain elevator paddles over time will also affect the mass flow calibration. Some harvesters use a solid plastic paddle over a rubber paddle for better consistency over time as worn paddles change the grain trajectory as it leaves the elevator changing the location the grain contacts the <b>impact</b> <b>plate.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Grain Mass flow is most {{commonly}} measured using a load cell with an <b>impact</b> <b>plate</b> {{attached to the}} load cell located {{at the top of}} the clean grain elevator. As the clean grain elevator paddles rotate around the top of the clean grain elevator, the grain is expelled from the elevator by centrifugal force and makes contact with the <b>impact</b> <b>plate</b> attached to the load cell. [...] The force applied by the grain is converted to an electrical signal by the load cell that is used to estimate the mass flow of the grain. A calibration of the sensor to develop a relationship of the amplitude of the electrical signal to grain mass flow and is calibrated on a harvester specific basis with the grain mass reported on a wet basis. This technology was developed and first commercialized by Ag Leader Technology. [...] The clean grain elevator speed is also measured and used in the calibration from electrical signal to mass flow as the elevator has a direct impact on the amount of force applied to the <b>impact</b> <b>plate</b> and load cell.

5000|$|Harvesting on slopes {{decreases}} {{the accuracy of}} the mass flow sensing system in most cases.

In cases which the <b>impact</b> <b>plate</b> is located similar to that seen in the [...] "Impact based mass flow sensor and clean grain elevator" [...] image, if the machine is pitched forward the mass flow will increase as gravity will aid in applying additional force to the mass flow sensor. When the harvester is pitched aft, the sensor response is reduced as gravity reduces the amount of force applied to the mass flow sensor. Roll causes similar error but of a smaller magnitude to that of the pitch of the harvester.|$|E

Free-floating parallelepiped-shaped growlers (small glacial ice masses) were impacted with a heavy apparatus (i. e. <b>impact</b> <b>plate)</b> designed to simulate a ship bow. Impacts were conducted at speeds ranging from 0. 2 to 3. 0 m/s, at three growler orientations, and at <b>impact</b> <b>plate</b> angles of 450, 300, and 150.

The long-term objective was to achieve a self-calibrating sensor system capable of adapting to varying input conditions due, for example, to changes in grain moisture content and aging of the system???s elevator paddles. In analyzing the mass flow sensing system, a physics-based model was developed to describe the relationship between the rate of mass flow through the combine and the measured force imparted to the <b>impact</b> <b>plate</b> in terms of mechanical properties of the grains and the interior geometry of the combine. A computational realization of this model was constructed in Matlab. Accurate mass flow rate estimation was achieved through model-based estimation based on nonlinear regression applied to the physics-based model and data acquired through simulation and experimentation. Model-based estimation was also extended as a means for self-calibration of the sensing system. Through development of the physics based model, the dependence of the force imparted to the <b>impact</b> <b>plate</b> on the orientation of the <b>impact</b> <b>plate</b> was identified. By inducing known changes to the <b>impact</b> <b>plate</b> orientation and implementing model-based estimation, a means of self-calibration of the sensing system was achieved. Three methods of model-based estimation were successfully demonstrated using data generated from the physics-based model. Additionally, these were further verified using data collected from discrete element modeling simulations, and experimental data collected in two fashions: using a full-scale replica of the mass flow sensing system, and using a small-scale, benchtop testing apparatus. Furthermore, the ability of the developed algorithm to update theoretical model parameters while simultaneously estimating mass flow rate was shown to enable the system to self-calibrate.

Single parameter regression models were created using the horizontal and magnitude force components of the load cells to predict mass flow through the combine. The horizontal and magnitude force prediction models had adjusted R 2 values of 0. 324 and 0. 599 respectively. Including the stover moisture to the prediction models using horizontal force and magnitude force increased the correlation of the adjusted R of the prediction models to 0. 709 and 0. 785 respectively.

40|$|The main aim of {{this study}} was to {{validate}} an already existing Finite Element (FE) model of a truck steering wheel, using experimental testing and computer modeling. Statistics show a high risk of sustaining severe injuries, in a frontal crash of heavy vehicles, due to steering wheel rim to thorax contact. The Hybrid III crash test dummy is now also used for analyzing heavy vehicle frontal crashes. It was originally developed for passenger cars and load cases common to them. To use in heavy vehicles, loading pattern to Hybrid III torso is now changed from the central hub to the rim of steering wheel. The Hybrid III crash test dummy is also available in FE codes. In order to investigate the heavy vehicle crashes in FE, a validated FE steering wheel model is also required. An impact test setup was designed and replicated both in physical testing and computer modeling. Since the steering wheel can be adjusted at different tilt angles of the rim during driving, a set of tilt angles 0, 10, 20 and 30 degree was selected to see the behavior of steering wheel on impact with the rigid steel plate. The contact force, <b>impact</b> <b>plate</b> displacement and component deformations were the key parameters to be observed and compared, in order to validate the FE steering wheel model. During physical tests for all the tilt angles, the steering wheel showed a stiff behavior regarding force level and horizontal displacement of the <b>impact</b> <b>plate.</b> Variation in peak force level during simulation and physical tests is less than 5 % for 0 and 10 degree.
