40|$|Crossed {{magnetic}} field effects on bulk high-temperature superconductors {{have been studied}} both experimentally and numerically. The sample geometry investigated involves finite-size effects along both (crossed) {{magnetic field}} directions. The experiments were carried out on bulk melt-processed Y-Ba-Cu-O (YBCO) single domains that had been pre-magnetized with the applied field parallel to their shortest direction (i. e. the c-axis) and then subjected to several cycles of {{the application of a}} transverse magnetic field parallel to the sample ab plane. The magnetic properties were measured using orthogonal pick-up coils, a Hall probe placed against the sample surface and Magneto-Optical Imaging (MOI). We show that all principal features of the experimental data can be reproduced qualitatively using a two-dimensional finite-element numerical model based on an E-J power law and in which the current density flows perpendicularly to the plane within which the two components of magnetic field are varied. The {{results of this study suggest}} that the suppression of the magnetic moment under the action of a transverse field can be predicted successfully by ignoring the existence of flux-free configurations or <b>flux-cutting</b> effects. These investigations show that the observed decay in magnetization results from the intricate modification of current distribution within the sample cross-section. It is also shown that the model does not predict any saturation of the magnetic induction, even after a large number (~ 100) of transverse field cycles. These features are shown to be consistent with the experimental data. Comment: 41 pages, 9 figures, accepted in Phys. Rev.

These investigations show that the observed decay in magnetization results from the intricate modification of current distribution within the sample cross section. The current amplitude is altered significantly only if a field-dependent critical current density Jc(B) is assumed. Our model is shown to be quite appropriate to describe the cross-flow effects in bulk superconductors. It is also shown that this model does not predict any saturation of the magnetic induction, even after a large number (~ 100) of transverse field cycles.

40|$|International audienceWe present {{measurements}} of the auto-and cross-frequency power spectra of the cosmic infrared background (CIB) at 250, 350, and 500 mu m (1200, 860, and 600 GHz) from observations totaling similar to 70 deg(2) made with the SPIRE instrument aboard the Herschel Space Observatory. We measure a fractional anisotropy delta I/I = 14 % +/- 4 %, detecting signatures arising from the clustering of dusty star-forming galaxies in both the linear (2 -halo) and nonlinear (1 -halo) regimes; and that {{the transition from the}} 2 - to 1 -halo terms, below which power originates predominantly from multiple galaxies within dark matter halos, occurs at k(theta) similar to 0. 10 - 0. 12 arcmin(- 1) (l similar to 2160 - 2380), from 250 to 500 mu m. New to this paper is clear evidence of a dependence of the Poisson and 1 -halo power on the <b>flux-cut</b> level of masked sources-suggesting that some fraction of the more luminous sources occupy more massive halos as satellites, or are possibly close pairs. We measure the cross-correlation power spectra between bands, finding that bands which are farthest apart are the least correlated, as well as hints of a reduction in the correlation between bands when resolved sources are more aggressively masked. In {{the second part of the}} paper, we attempt to interpret the measurements in the framework of the halo model. With the aim of fitting simultaneously with one model the power spectra, number counts, and absolute CIB level in all bands, we find that this is achievable by invoking a luminosity-mass relationship, such that the luminosity-to-mass ratio peaks at a particular halo mass scale and declines toward lower and higher mass halos. Our best-fit model finds that the halo mass which is most efficient at hosting star formation in the redshift range of peak star-forming activity, z similar to 1 - 3, is log(M-peak/M-circle dot) similar to 12. 1 +/- 0. 5, and that the minimum halo mass to host infrared galaxies is log(Mmin/M-circle dot) similar to 10. 1 +/- 0. 6...|$|R
