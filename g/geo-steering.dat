We studied the key technologies related to real-time LWD data visual interpretation and <b>geo-steering</b> and developed computer software with Chinese intellectual property rights covering the following important aspects: 1) real-time computer communication of well site LWD data; 2) visualization of geological model and borehole information; 3) real-time interpretation of LWD data; 4) real-time geological model updating and <b>geo-steering</b> technology.

40|$|A {{methodology}} for faults enhancement from seismic volume is presented. This method proposes {{to detect the}} faults distribution on the basis on the 3 D analysis of a continuous geological model. This geological model is obtained by using an innovative technique based on global optimization algorithms in the PaleoScan software. The analysis of the geo-model allows to detect the faults network {{with a high level}} of accuracy and to estimate the throw along each fault plane. This approach has been successfully tested on various data sets where the throw analysis was required to identify the sealing faults for <b>geo-steering</b> and well placement applications.

30|$|This section reviews {{a number}} of common logging while {{drilling}} (LWD) technologies in {{the oil and gas}} drilling operations. The review aims at identifying the benefits of faster and better quality telemetry systems as the basis of effective <b>geo-steering</b> decision making and drilling risk control (Wassermann et al. 2009). Downhole telemetry technologies that transfer drilling data to the surface are categories into wired-pipe telemetry (WPT) and wireless telemetry systems that include electromagnetic (EM), acoustic and mud pulse (MPT) telemetry systems (Hutin et al. 2001). Increased downhole collected information quantity have led the deployment of telemetry technology to be limited by transmission bandwidth of critical data (Nygard et al. 2008). The increased bandwidth demand guarantee complete drilling and formation evaluation in real time (Wolfe et al. 2009). The real-time data are important for well construction analysis and decision making to optimize drilling and well completion strategies while drilling.|$|E

30|$|Effective {{and robust}} signal {{transmission}} techniques combined with data compression methods {{can improve the}} performance of MPT systems data rate transmission. The introduction of data compression techniques into mud pulse logging data (Wu 2008) can improve the MPT information quantity and quality to satisfy exploration and drilling information. Real-time logging data compression method and mud signal differential pulse-code modulation (DPCM) scheme can reduce data redundancy, achieve good signal decoding quality and low algorithm complexity (Yu et al. 2010; Zhang et al. 2009). With the compression ratio of at least 50 %, it can provide the alterable compressing ratio advantages, excellent decode quality and low algorithm complexity (Zhang et al. 2009). Half compressed real-time logging data can double the transmission efficiency of the LWD system when the error between the compressed and original data is less than 5 % (Yu et al. 2010). The 4  bps physical data transmission link with data compression addition can achieve effective data rates of up to 33  bps at higher telemetry frequencies (≥[*] 10  Hz) (Caruzo et al. 2012). Implemented Orion II telemetry platform employed data compression algorithms that increased the quantity of data rate to 120  bps (simulated results), providing real-time <b>geo-steering</b> drilling efficiency to surface from 12, 300  m downhole (Gilles 2009). However, (Gilles 2009) and (Caruzo et al. 2012) did not disclose the data compression methods used. The data compression algorithms to maximize the effective data rate and allow delivery of real-time image data of equivalent quality were demonstrated by (Cooper et al. 2015). At surface, compatible data decompression algorithms are required to maintain compressed telemetry data quality.|$|E
