40|$|One {{critical}} issue in cooperation research is that evidence for certain behaviors often stems from public <b>goods</b> <b>games</b> played for very {{short periods of}} time in an artificial environment, the laboratory.

40|$|This paper reports an {{experiment}} which compares behaviour in two punishment regimes: (i) a standard public <b>goods</b> <b>game</b> with punishment in which subjects {{are given the}} opportunity to punish other group members (democratic punishment regime) and (ii) a public <b>goods</b> <b>game</b> environment where all group members exogenously experience an automatic reduction of their income (irrespective of their behaviour) and are {{given the opportunity to}} alleviate the automatic penalty (undemocratic punishment regime). We employ a within-subjects design where subjects experience both environments and control for order effects by alternating their sequence. Our findings indicate that average contributions and earnings in the undemocratic punishment environment are significantly lower relative to the standard public <b>goods</b> <b>game</b> with punishment. We also observe that in the undemocratic environment average contributions decay over time only when subjects have experienced the standard public <b>goods</b> <b>game</b> with punishment. As a result, alleviation is significantly less when subjects have experienced the standard public <b>goods</b> <b>game</b> with punishment compared to when they do not have such experience.

40|$|Public <b>goods</b> <b>games</b> are {{models of}} social {{dilemmas}} where cooperators pay a {{cost for the}} production of a public good while defectors free ride on the contributions of cooperators. In the traditional framework of evolutionary game theory, the payoffs of cooperators and defectors result from interactions in groups formed by binomial sampling from an infinite population. Despite empirical evidence showing that group-size distributions in nature are highly heterogeneous, most models of social evolution assume that the group size is constant. In this article, I remove this assumption and explore the effects of having random group sizes on the evolutionary dynamics of public <b>goods</b> <b>games.</b> By a straightforward application of Jensenâ€™s inequality, I show that the outcome of general nonlinear public <b>goods</b> <b>games</b> depends not only on the average group size but also on the variance of the group-size distribution. This general result is illustrated with two nonlinear public <b>goods</b> <b>games</b> (the public <b>goods</b> <b>game</b> with discounting or synergy and the N-person volunteerâ€™s dilemma) and three different group-size distributions (Poisson, geometric, and Waring). The results suggest that failing to acknowledge the natural variation of group sizes can lead to an underestimation of the actual level of cooperation exhibited in evolving populations...|$|R

One challenge is having publishers provide games early enough to be reviewed and filmed in time.
