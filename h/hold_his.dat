5|$|Johnson's friends accused Erskine {{of using}} the trial as a {{political}} platform and not thinking of {{the best interests of}} his client. Johnson's imprisonment was not harsh; being relatively wealthy, Johnson rented a home for himself within the prison, where he continued to <b>hold</b> <b>his</b> weekly soirées.|$|E
5|$|Spinks was a {{formidable}} specialist and professional competitor in straight rail billiards (early on), and balkline billiards (one {{of the most}} difficult of all cue sports), especially 14.2 and later 18.2 balkline, and skilled enough at the even more difficult 18.1 variant to <b>hold</b> <b>his</b> own against World Champions.|$|E
5|$|Halotus {{was also}} {{known to have}} been a eunuch. There are many {{possible}} reasons for this but the most likely is related to the possibility of sexual contact between servant and master; a prohibition against sexual contact between royalty and servants, guards and slaves was not uncommon {{in many parts of the}} world during Halotus' era and it was thought that male castration would prevent this. Halotus may have been required to submit to castration in order to <b>hold</b> <b>his</b> position.|$|E
5000|$|... "Holding" [...] is {{the second}} Jackson Browne composition. It is an up-tempo tune in the 1960s style, {{featuring}} guitar in the foreground and banjo in the background. Holding means something slightly different in each verse and chorus. He is <b>holding</b> <b>his</b> door open, <b>holding</b> <b>his</b> own, and <b>holding</b> <b>his</b> name up.|$|R

5|$|Mary Surratt, Powell, Herold, and Atzerodt were hanged in the Old Arsenal Penitentiary on July 7. Mary Surratt was {{the first}} woman {{executed}} by the United States government. O'Laughlen died in prison in 1867. Mudd, Arnold, and Spangler were pardoned in February 1869 by Johnson. Spangler, who died in 1875, always insisted his sole connection to the plot was that Booth asked him to <b>hold</b> <b>his</b> horse.|$|E
5|$|Michael's {{recklessness}} makes {{a complete}} mess {{of the warehouse}} while jeopardizing the employees' safety. Michael's plans to <b>hold</b> <b>his</b> own seminar backfire when the warehouse workers' gripe session leads to them deciding to form a union.

5|$|Team North America {{closed the}} {{two-point}} gap by {{one point in}} men's team play, where they won {{two of the three}} games. Both Niklas Edin of Team World and Kevin Martin of Team North America won close games against Heath McCormick and Tom Brewster, respectively, while Glenn Howard made a double-takeout in the last end to <b>hold</b> <b>his</b> lead and win the game over Thomas Ulsrud. At the end of the day, Team World led Team North America 5–4.|$|E

5|$|A {{group of}} most of the top riders in the GC, paced by the race leader himself, caught every one of the twelve initial leaders, and {{subsequently}} Garzelli just before the day's last climb, Prà Martino. Di Luca's aggressive descent of Prà Martino gave him a gap over the elite group of riders who had been able to <b>hold</b> <b>his</b> wheel to that point, and the stage win. The day saw a big winner in time gains and a big loser: Lance Armstrong finished 29 seconds behind Di Luca in the same group as the man finishing sixth on the stage, gaining seven places in the GC, while Thomas Lövkvist lost over a minute and fell from second to eighth in the GC.|$|E
5|$|About 19:45, the 1st Army Group held {{a conference}} in Zagreb, just as German tanks were {{entering}} the city. Nedeljković told Petrović that {{he could no longer}} <b>hold</b> <b>his</b> positions, but despite this, Petrović ordered him to hold for at least 2–3 days to enable the withdrawal of the 7th Army to the Kupa river. Nedeljković replied that he no longer had an army, and suggested that all Serb officers and men be ordered back to form a defensive line along the Sava and Una rivers. Petrović refused to consider this, but ordered the 1st Cavalry Division to form a defensive line along the Sava between Jasenovac and Zagreb.|$|E
5|$|According to Kint, Söze {{began his}} {{criminal}} {{career as a}} petty drug dealer in his native Turkey. His legendary persona is born when rival Hungarian smugglers invade his house while he is away, rape his wife, and <b>hold</b> <b>his</b> children hostage; when Söze arrives, they kill one of his children and demand he surrender his business. Instead, Söze kills his own family and {{all but one of}} the Hungarians, who he knows will tell the Mafia what has happened. Once his family is buried, Söze targets the Hungarian Mafia, their families, friends, and people who owe them money. He goes underground, never again doing business in person.|$|E

5|$|Adams and the {{correspondence}} committees promoted {{opposition to the}} Tea Act. In every colony except Massachusetts, protesters were able to force the tea consignees to resign or to return the tea to England. In Boston, however, Governor Hutchinson was determined to <b>hold</b> <b>his</b> ground. He convinced the tea consignees, two of whom were his sons, not to back down. The Boston Caucus and then the Town Meeting attempted to compel the consignees to resign, but they refused. With the tea ships about to arrive, Adams and the Boston Committee of Correspondence contacted nearby committees to rally support.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} proper, Lewis Hamilton {{was able to}} <b>hold</b> <b>his</b> lead, while his {{teammate}} Nico Rosberg tried to attack Sebastian Vettel in second place. This opened up the opportunity for the second Ferrari of Kimi Räikkönen {{to go around the}} outside of the Mercedes and take third. Hamilton tried to open up a gap in order to cover his position, should the Ferrari drivers attempt a so-called undercut, a strategy in which a car entered the pit lane early in order to use fresher tyres to get in front of another car without overtaking them on track. Meanwhile, Rosberg took back third from Räikkönen on lap four before doing the same with Vettel on the end of lap nine.|$|E
5|$|Finally {{accepting}} that Soult would not arrive, Ney could {{not hope to}} <b>hold</b> <b>his</b> position, much less push the Austrians back. He concluded that he must fall back to Winterthur. To cover the retreat, he instructed Walther and his cavalry to establish {{a position on the}} Töss, above the bridge at Stieg. From there, the cavalry could protect an orderly retreat. Amidst a muddy rivulet feeding the Töss, Ney positioned a second detachment guarding the village of Töss and the road leading to a ridge of the hills, where he placed a couple of cannons. From the ridge, his rear guard could fire its artillery on the Austrian advance.|$|E

5|$|Firing began {{early on}} the morning of June 5. The Indians did not close, but {{remained}} at a distance of two or three hundred yards. Such long range firing with smooth bore muskets caused little loss to either side. The Americans thought that the Indians held back because they had suffered heavy losses on the previous day. In fact, the Indians were buying time, waiting for reinforcements to arrive. Crawford decided to <b>hold</b> <b>his</b> position in the trees and make a surprise attack on the Indians after nightfall. At this point, he was still confident of success, although his men were low on ammunition and water. Simon Girty, the British agent and interpreter, rode up with a white flag and called for the Americans to surrender, which was refused.|$|E
5|$|Following the American attack, Komori {{pulled his}} {{remaining}} {{force back to}} defend the airstrip. As {{this was not an}} Allied objective, the Japanese were not subjected to further attacks by ground troops other than occasional patrol clashes and ambushes. As a result of the supply shortages, many of the Japanese soldiers fell sick. Attempts to bring supplies in by sea from Gasmata were disrupted by U.S.Navy PT boats and the force lacked enough porters to supply itself through overland trails. Komori concluded that his force was serving no purpose, and on 8February informed his superiors that it faced destruction due to supply shortages. They responded by ordering Komori to <b>hold</b> <b>his</b> positions, though his force was awarded two Imperial citations in recognition of its supposed success in defending the airstrip.|$|E
5|$|Headed by Saint Peter, the Apostles {{are dressed}} in white robes and sit on two facing benches set below Christ {{and to the right}} and left of the choir of virgins. Two angels attend to the groups {{gathered}} at each side of the benches. A further two angels are positioned immediately above Christ. They <b>hold</b> <b>his</b> cross and {{are dressed in}} white amice and albs, with the right hand angel wearing an outer blue dalmatic vestment. They are flanked on either side by angels playing long wind instruments, probably trumpets. The two angels on either side of Christ bear the symbols of the crucifixion already represented on the left hand panel. The angel on the left holds a lance and crown of thorns, the angel on the right a sponge and nails.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Jack's Valentine's dinner {{plans with}} his girlfriend Elisa (Salma Hayek) are {{postponed}} {{when they have to}} attend church. Jack calls his office assistant, Jonathan (Maulik Pancholy), telling him to <b>hold</b> <b>his</b> dinner reservations. Before they can leave church, Elisa tells Jack that they need to go to confession. After horrifying the priest (Zak Orth) with his admissions, Elisa becomes furious with Jack and breaks up with him. Later, however, she laments her fight with Jack. After finding a McFlurry coupon in the collection plate, she believes it is a sign from God because both she and Jack love the McDonald's dessert. The two reconcile their relationship as a result, and spend Valentine's Day together at a McDonald's.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the others}} {{arrive at the}} cabin for the hunting trip. Leslie (Amy Poehler) proves to be an {{excellent}} hunter and bags the first quail. Growing increasingly agitated, Ron agrees to a challenge that Leslie cannot shoot more birds than he can, and they split up. After {{a few hours of}} hunting, Ron screams and the others rush to his side and find he has been shot in the head. Ann, a nurse, takes Ron back to the cabin, where he is absolutely furious even though the injury is not serious. Ron asks whether Leslie shot him, but she insists she did not. Ron takes several pain pills and washes it down with scotch, which forces Ann and Leslie to <b>hold</b> <b>his</b> mouth open and induce vomiting, despite fierce opposition from Ron himself.|$|E
5|$|Plante's {{first foray}} into {{organized}} hockey came at age 12. He was watching his school's team practice, when the coach ordered the goaltender off the ice after a heated argument over his play, and Plante asked to replace him. The coach permitted him to play {{since there was no}} other available goaltender; it was quickly apparent that Plante could <b>hold</b> <b>his</b> own, despite the other players being many years older than he was. He impressed the coach and stayed on as the team's number one goaltender.|$|E
