In 1954, he joined Cadet College Hasan Abdal and was among the founding teachers of the college. He served as the housemaster of Haider and Auragnzeb wing during his tenure. He was also the coach of Hasanabdal's college football team. He used to teach mathematics and Urdu during his 26 years of stay in the college. He retired from Cadet College in 1980.

6000|$|Of Carlyle's early {{school life}} {{we have some}} {{interesting}} glimpses in Sartor Resartus.

At the wish of his parents, who intended Carlyle for the ministry, he endured this hateful school life till 1809, when he entered Edinburgh University. There he spent five miserable years, of which his own record is: [...] "I was without friends, experience, or connection {{in the sphere of}} human business, was of sly humor, proud enough and to spare, and had begun my long curriculum of dyspepsia." [...] This nagging illness was the cause of much of that irritability of temper which frequently led him to scold the public, and for which he has been harshly handled by unfriendly critics.|$|E
