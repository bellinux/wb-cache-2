He asked Kong Rong to let him lead soldiers to fight their way out, but Kong refused and insisted on waiting for reinforcements. The rebels came closer day by day. Kong Rong wanted to seek help from Liu Bei, the Chancellor of Pingyuan State (平原國; around present-day Pingyuan, Shandong), {{but no one had}} any idea on how {{to break out of the}} siege. Taishi Ci volunteered to fight his way out and seek reinforcements from Liu Bei, but Kong Rong said, [...] "The rebels have completely surrounded the fortress. Everyone thinks it is impossible to break out. It will be very <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> break out no matter how courageous you are." [...] Taishi Ci replied, [...] "When I was away, you treated my mother very generously. She feels grateful, hence she told me to help you. She knew that I know what I am doing, and that I can help you. Now, everyone says it is impossible to break out. If I were to agree with them, I will not be able to repay your kindness. Why, then, did my mother send me here for? We are in a very desperate situation. I hope you won't hesitate any longer." [...] Kong Rong agreed to let him break out of the siege.|$|E

3000|$|The {{dependent}} variable {{for this study}} is an index of key performance indicators (KPIs) of the healthcare system in Alberta. These indicators reveal a single underlying construct measuring public perceptions of healthcare (see Northcott and Harvey, 2012 for details). The KPIs index consists of five general indicators assessing the availability, accessibility, and perceived quality of healthcare services, overall quality of the healthcare system, and satisfaction with the health system in Alberta. Four of these KPIs were measured on a 4 -point scale and one (satisfaction) on a 5 -point scale. Availability was measured by asking the respondents, “Overall, {{how would you rate}} the availability of health care services in your community?” (coded 1 [*]=[*]poor, 4 [*]=[*]excellent). Accessibility was measured by the question, “How easy or <b>difficult</b> is it <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> get the health care services you need when you need them?” (coded 1 [*]=[*]very difficult, 4 [*]=[*]very easy). Perceived quality of the healthcare services was measured by the question, “Overall, how would you rate the quality of health care services that are available in your community?” (coded 1 [*]=[*]poor, 4 [*]=[*]excellent). Quality of the healthcare system was measured by the question, “Thinking now about the health care system in Alberta, overall, how would you rate it?” (coded 1 [*]=[*]poor, 4 [*]=[*]excellent). Satisfaction with the health system was measured by the question, “Overall, how satisfied are you with the health system in Alberta?” (coded 1 [*]=[*]very dissatisfied, 5 [*]=[*]very satisfied). Northcott and Harvey (2012) utilized the same sample used in this study and reported a Cronbach’s alpha value of [...]. 84 for the KPIs index, indicating good internal consistency for this measure.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Physical {{function}} (PF) is a core patient-reported outcome domain {{in clinical}} trials in rheumatic diseases. Frequently used PF measures have ceiling effects, leading to large sample size requirements and low sensitivity to change. In most of these instruments, the response category that indicates the highest PF level is the statement that one is able to perform a given physical activity without any limitations or difficulty. This study investigates whether using an item format with an extended response scale, allowing respondents to state that the performance of an activity is easy or very easy, increases the range of precise measurement of self-reported PF. METHODS: Three five-item PF short forms were constructed from the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS(R)) wave 1 data. All forms included the same physical activities but varied in item stem and response scale: format A (2 ̆ 2 Are <b>you</b> able <b>to</b> [...] . 2 ̆ 2; 2 ̆ 2 without any difficulty 2 ̆ 2 / 2 ̆ 2 unable to do 2 ̆ 2); format B (2 ̆ 2 Does your health now limit you [...] . 2 ̆ 2; 2 ̆ 2 not at all 2 ̆ 2 / 2 ̆ 2 cannot do 2 ̆ 2); format C (2 ̆ 2 How <b>difficult</b> is it <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> [...] . 2 ̆ 2; 2 ̆ 2 very easy 2 ̆ 2 / 2 ̆ 2 impossible 2 ̆ 2). Each short-form item was answered by 2217 - 2835 subjects. We evaluated unidimensionality and estimated a graded response model for the 15 short-form items and remaining 119 items of the PROMIS PF bank to compare item and test information for the short forms along the PF continuum. We then used simulated data for five groups with different PF levels to illustrate differences in scoring precision between the short forms using different item formats. RESULTS: Sufficient unidimensionality of all short-form items and the original PF item bank was supported. Compared to formats A and B, format C increased the range of reliable measurement by about 0. 5 standard deviations {{on the positive side}} of the PF continuum of the sample, provided more item information, and was more useful in distinguishing known groups with above-average functioning. CONCLUSIONS: Using an item format with an extended response scale is an efficient option to increase the measurement range of self-reported physical function without changing the content of the measure or affecting the latent construct of the instrument...|$|R
