STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We searched five high-impact-factor medical journals for reports of RCTs with clinical event endpoints published between January 1, 2004 and December 31, 2005. RESULTS: ACs were reported in 33. 4 % of the 314 reports of RCTs. ACs were reported in 29. 6 % of trials with low risk of misclassification (i. e., "hard" main outcome), in 47. 5 % of trials with medium risk of misclassification (i. e., subjective main outcome and intervention delivered <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>blinded</b> <b>fashion)</b> and in 31 % of trials with high risk of misclassification (i. e., subjective main outcome without intervention delivered <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>blinded</b> <b>fashion).</b> Selected cases to be adjudicated consisted largely of events identified by site investigators (93. 3 %).

30|$|With {{sophisticated}} {{signal and}} information processing algorithms, air interfaces with space-time (ST) coding and multiple reception antennas substantially improve {{the reliability of}} wireless links. This paper proposes a new receiver algorithm for differential ST coded transmissions over the finite-impulse-response (FIR) rich multipath fading channels. The symbol detection introduced in this paper is a deterministic subspace-based approach <b>in</b> <b>a</b> multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) system framework. The receiver (i) operates <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>blind</b> <b>fashion</b> without estimating the channel or its inverse and (ii) is {{able to work with}} a small number of signal samples and hence can be applied in the quasistatic channels. The proposed scheme employs multiple antennas at both sides of the transceiver and exploits both the antenna diversity and the multiple constant modulus (MCM) characteristics of the signaling. The receiver is able to blindly mitigate the intersymbol interference (ISI) <b>in</b> <b>a</b> rich multipath propagation environment, and this has been verified through the extensive Monte Carlo simulations.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new framework for blind source separation (BSS) of non-negative source signals. The proposed framework, referred herein to as convex analysis of mixtures of non-negative sources (CAMNS), is deterministic requiring no source independence assumption, the entrenched premise in many existing (usually statistical) BSS frameworks. The development {{is based on}} a special assumption called local dominance. It is a good assumption for source signals exhibiting sparsity or high contrast, and thus is considered realistic to many real-world problems such as multichannel biomedical imaging. Under local dominance and several standard assumptions, we apply convex analysis to establish a new BSS criterion, which states that the source signals can be perfectly identified (<b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>blind</b> <b>fashion)</b> by finding the extreme points of an observation-constructed polyhedral set. Methods for fulfilling the CAMNS criterion are also derived, using either linear programming or simplex geometry. Simulation results on several data sets are presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method over several other reported BSS methods...|$|R
