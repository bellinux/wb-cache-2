Previous experiments demonstrated that worker policing is effective, killing most (∼ 98 %) worker-laid eggs. However, many queen-laid eggs were also killed (∼ 50 %) suggesting that effective policing may have high costs. In these previous experiments, eggs were transferred using forceps into test cells, mostly into unrelated discriminator colonies. We measured both {{the survival of}} unmanipulated queen-laid eggs {{and the proportion of}} removal errors that were rectified by the queen laying a new egg. Across 2 days of the 3 -day egg stage, only 9. 6 % of the queen-laid eggs in <b>drone</b> <b>cells</b> and 4. 1 % in worker cells were removed in error. When queen-laid eggs were removed from cells, 85 % from <b>drone</b> <b>cells</b> and 61 % from worker cells were replaced within 3 days. Worker policing in the honeybee has a high benefit to policing workers because workers are more related to the queen’s sons (brothers, r = 0. 25) than sister workers’ sons (0. 15).

40|$|Varroa jacobsoni, an {{ectoparasite}} of the Asian honeybee Apis cerana, {{has been}} introduced world-wide, and is currently decimating colonies of the European honeybee Apis mellifera. Varroa 's reproductive cycle is tuned to that of <b>drone</b> <b>cells,</b> those mainly parasitized in the original host. We describe here how a single fertilized female, infesting a brood cell, can produce two to four adult fertilized females within the limited time span of bee development (270 h in worker and 320 h in <b>drone</b> <b>cells),</b> despite the disturbance caused by cocoon spinning and subsequent morphological changes of the bee. From observations on transparent artificial cells {{we were able to}} show how the mite combats these problems with specialized behaviors that avoid destruction by the developing bee, prepares a feeding site for the nymphs on the bee pupa, and constructs a fecal accumulation on the cell wall which serves as a rendezvous site for matings between its offspring. The proximity of the fecal accumulation to the feeding site facilitates feeding by the maturing progeny. However, communal use of the feeding site leads to competition between individuals, and protonymphs are most disadvantaged. This competition is somewhat compensated by the timing of oviposition by the mites. Use of a common rendezvous and feeding site by two or more Varroa mothers in multiinfested cells may have developed from the parental care afforded to them as nymphs...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} the reproductive biology of V. destructor in Africanized honeybees (AHB) in Central American conditions, specifically in Costa Rica. Attention {{was paid to}} mite fertility and production of viable female mites in worker and <b>drone</b> brood <b>cells.</b> Other reproduction parameters, like fecundity, production of only immature offspring, production of only female or only male offspring and no reproduction at all are discussed. Furthermore, results on mite population dynamics and its influence in the colony condition are presented. We hypothesized that, due to the preference of mites to invade drone brood to reproduce, {{a high proportion of}} the mite reproduction in Africanized bees should occur in <b>drone</b> <b>cells.</b> Mite fertility for varroa infesting worker brood cells in AHB in Costa Rica, ranged between 69 % and 76 %. So the number of fertile varroa mites in worker brood was higher than what other studies have reported for AHB in Brazil. Nevertheless, factors that limited varroa reproduction in worker brood were the non-reproducing mites, foundresses that produced only immature stages, foundresses that produced one adult sex, mortality of emerging mites and the absence of the male we found in a considerable percentage of worker cells. The combined effects of these factors results in less than 30 % of the foundress mites producing viable female in Africanized colonies. The absence of the male in worker cells reduces the production of viable daughters. We observed in artificial cells containing infested worker brood in Africanized bees that in a considerable number of cases the first egg (that is generally male) was disturbed and damaged when the prepupa molts into a pupa. We consider that the absence of male in a considerable number of worker cells could be hypothesized by this effect. The low number of viable females produced by foundress mites found in worker brood cells of AHB colonies, seems insufficient to explain the occurrence of viruses in severely infested colonies and the mite infestation increase in the colonies through the year. Due to the preference of mites to infest drone brood to reproduce, we compared the reproductive rate of V. destructor in worker and <b>drone</b> <b>cells</b> of AHB colonies. We found that mite fertility was similar between worker and drone brood. However, {{one of the most significant}} differences in mite reproduction was the higher percentage of mites producing viable offspring in <b>drone</b> <b>cells</b> compared to worker cells. The number of eggs and viable females produced per foundress mites was also higher in drone brood. Furthermore, a high percentage of the non-reproducing mites in worker brood produced offspring when they were transferred to drone brood. This indicates that <b>drone</b> brood <b>cells</b> proved to be better suited for mite reproduction than worker brood cells and that brood type has an influence in the reproductive success of varroa mites in Africanized bees. The number of viable female offspring produced by invading mother mites depends, in part, upon the type of cell the mite enters, whether it is worker or drone Because in tropical conditions worker brood rearing takes place all year-round, varroa can completes many reproductive cycles. So the number of mite reproductive cycles that occurs in worker brood through the year and the successful reproduction of varroa mites in drone brood are significant factors related with the mite population growth determined in AHB colonies in Costa Rica...|$|R

Worker policing in social Hymenoptera (by removal of worker laid eggs) was predicted in 19841 and first reported in the honeybee (Apis mellifera) in 19892. To date, worker policing has been observed in 29 species 3. Various models try to explain the origin and maintenance of policing in terms of inclusive fitness theory. Much effort has been invested into the search for signals or cues of egg provenance 4. Less {{is known about the}} organization of policing within a colony. Recent studies in several taxa suggest a specialization in policing behaviour 5. We aim to provide the first insight on the task allocation of worker policing in honeybees. Therefore, we will follow cohorts of individually marked bees of known age in an observation hive, using focal sampling methods, to study the work profile of policing honeybee workers. A predisposition for policing might be indicated by inspecting <b>cells,</b> especially on <b>drone</b> combs. By introducing worker laid eggs in <b>drone</b> <b>cells,</b> {{we will be able to}} observe actual events of policing. Policing and non-policing bees of the same age will be sampled and their ovaries dissected. The policing of bees with developed ovaries could be interpreted as selfish if they thereby would gain higher chances to lay eggs themselves. A possibly inherited bias for policing will be detected by microsatellite analysis of patrilines. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} <b>drone</b> small <b>cells</b> (DSCs) network modeled by 3 D Poisson point process. We further study an {{underlay}} spectrum sharing between the 3 D DSCs network and traditional cellular networks modeled by 2 D Poisson Point Processes. We derive the explicit expressions for the downlink DSCs coverage probability and achievable throughput. We obtain the optimal density of DSCs aerial base stations that maximizes the DSCs network throughput while satisfying the cellular network efficiency constraint. Our analytical and numerical {{results show that}} the maximized throughput of the DSCs user increases almost linearly with the increase of the DSCs outage constraint. However, to protect the cellular user, the potential throughput of the DSCs user should stop increasing when it encounters the cellular network efficiency loss constraint...|$|R
40|$|The classic view {{of insect}} colonies as {{harmonic}} societies {{has been challenged}} in the last decades. It became clear that several conflicts ‘loom’ below the peaceful surface. One conflict is about male parentage, as some workers are capable of producing viable male eggs and are sometimes favoured by selection to do so. Yet, there are methods in place to reduce or solve these conflicts.
