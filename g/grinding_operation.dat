5000|$|An {{example of}} the concept of {{tolerance}} is a shaft for a machine is intended to be precisely 10 mm in diameter: 10 mm is the nominal dimension. The engineer designing the machine knows that in reality, the <b>grinding</b> <b>operation</b> that produces the final diameter may introduce a certain small-but-unavoidable amount of random error. Therefore, the engineer specifies a tolerance of ±0.01 mm ("plus-or-minus" [...] 0.01 mm).|$|E
50|$|Electrolytic in-process {{dressing}} (ELID) grinding {{is one of}} {{the most}} accurate grinding methods. In this ultra precision grinding technology the grinding wheel is dressed electrochemically and in-process to maintain the accuracy of the grinding. An ELID cell consists of a metal bonded grinding wheel, a cathode electrode, a pulsed DC power supply and electrolyte. The wheel is connected to the positive terminal of the DC power supply through a carbon brush whereas the electrode is connected to the negative pole of the power supply. Usually alkaline liquids are used as both electrolytes and coolant for grinding. A nozzle is used to inject the electrolyte into the gap between wheel and electrode. The gap is usually maintained to be approximately 0.1mm to 0.3 mm. During the <b>grinding</b> <b>operation</b> one side of the wheel takes part in the <b>grinding</b> <b>operation</b> whereas the other side of the wheel is being dressed by electrochemical reaction. The dissolution of the metallic bond material is caused by the dressing which in turns results continuous protrusion of new sharp grits.|$|E

50|$|The <b>grinding</b> <b>operation</b> is {{combined}} with EDM for several reasons. For example, according to Modern Machine Shop, the combination allows a higher material removal rate and is therefore more cost effective. Also, the EDM process slightly affects the surface finish. Grinding is used on the affected area to provide a finer final surface. The Beijing Institute of Electro-Machining attributes a finer shaping and surface geometry to {{the combination of the}} two processes into one.|$|E

The contractor sued for the costs of finding that it needed to grind the powder, because the Army should have shared this superior knowledge.|$|E

40|$|Gear {{noise in}} modern {{automobiles}} is unacceptable. It has different sources, such as design parameters and manufacturing errors. Manufacturing errors, for example, {{can be reduced}} using advanced <b>grinding</b> <b>operations.</b> However, sometimes <b>grinding</b> <b>operations</b> can introduce micro-geometry deviations that cause severe noise problems. The present thesis defines and characterizes the micro-geometry of gears, studies its noise consequences, explores some finishing-operations characteristics from the micro-geometry point of view, and uses this knowledge to optimize {{one of the most}} important <b>grinding</b> <b>operations</b> (Reishauer <b>Grinding).</b> Results of the proposed optimization routine are verified, and capabilities of the optimized grinding are compared to an alternative operation method (Power Honing). The most "noisy" surface parameters were identified as undulations. Amplitude, wavelength, and main direction of undulations were considered as noise-influential. Therefore, three optimization criteria were assumed: 1) reduction of the amplitude of undulations, 2) shortening their wavelength, 3) producing surfaces with a suitable direction of the undulations. Experimental noise investigations showed that assumptions of the optimization criteria worked out properly, since experiments showed that gear surfaces having undulations caused a significantly higher noise level. Extra noise frequencies were identified as corresponding to the wavelength of undulations. The noise level also was shown to directly correlate to undulation amplitude. Finally, theoretical modeling and simulations explained characteristic noise changes (as indicated by experiments) ...|$|R
