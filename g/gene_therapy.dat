5|$|<b>Gene</b> <b>therapy</b> {{typically}} {{involves the}} use of a non-infectious virus (i.e., a viral vector such as the adeno-associated virus) to shuttle genetic material into a part of the brain. The gene used leads to the production of an enzyme that helps to manage PD symptoms or protects the brain from further damage. In 2010 there were four clinical trials using <b>gene</b> <b>therapy</b> in PD. There have not been important adverse effects in these trials although the clinical usefulness of <b>gene</b> <b>therapy</b> is still unknown. One of these reported positive results in 2011, but the company filed for bankruptcy in March 2012.|$|E

5|$|<b>Gene</b> <b>therapy</b> {{is being}} studied in {{some types of}} epilepsy. Medications that alter immune function, such as {{intravenous}} immunoglobulins, are poorly supported by evidence. Noninvasive stereotactic radiosurgery is, as of 2012, being compared to standard surgery for certain types of epilepsy.|$|E
40|$|<b>Gene</b> <b>therapies</b> hold {{great promise}} for {{treatment}} of diseases but so far their market authorisation has been limited. This paper describes the development of patented <b>gene</b> <b>therapies</b> in the sector of life sciences and health.  It {{was found that the}} annual number of patented <b>gene</b> <b>therapies</b> increased significantly till the year 2005.   A cluster analysis of <b>gene</b> <b>therapies</b> patented in 1995 shows that:  a) more than eighty percent has been renewed for more than fifteen years (fifty three per cent till the maximum patent term) and b) fifty per cent of the patents have been licensed. There is a statistically significant correlation between the numbers of citations in future patent applications by third parties and the number of years of patent renewals. A case study of the patent EP 0833934 of biotechnology start- up Crucell demonstrates that the number of citations by third companies to this patent even predicts the companies’ market capitalization. This research yielded evidence that the number of patent citations can be used as indicator to determine the value of <b>gene</b> <b>therapies.</b> Such information is of relevance for both the patentee and investors...|$|R

5|$|Another type of {{approach}} is tissue engineering, using biomaterials to help scaffold and rebuild damaged tissues. Biomaterials being investigated include natural substances such as collagen or agarose and synthetic ones like polymers and nitrocellulose. They fall into two categories: hydrogels and nanofibers. These materials {{can also be used}} as a vehicle for delivering <b>gene</b> <b>therapy</b> to tissues.|$|E
5|$|In {{research}} {{involved with}} the Grand Challenges in Global Health initiative, Rosetta {{has been used to}} computationally design novel homing endonuclease proteins, which could eradicate Anopheles gambiae or otherwise render the mosquito unable to transmit malaria. Being able to model and alter protein–DNA interactions specifically, like those of homing endonucleases, gives computational protein design methods like Rosetta an important role in <b>gene</b> <b>therapy</b> (which includes possible cancer treatments).|$|E

Moon {{is apparently}} killed and Bond is captured and tortured for 14 months, {{after which he}} is exchanged for Zao, Moon's assistant. Despite being suspended on his return, he decides to complete his mission and tracks down Zao to a <b>gene</b> <b>therapy</b> clinic, where patients can have their appearances altered through DNA restructuring. Zao escapes, but the trail leads to British billionaire Gustav Graves.|$|E
5|$|Commander T'Pol and Commander Tucker remain captives of Paxton, who {{continues}} to broadcast his demand on all channels and frequencies. Paxton's action has an unsettling effect on the interspecies conference since {{it is clear that}} not all humans support it. On Mars, Paxton allows T'Pol and Tucker see the baby, and T'Pol uses her scanner to learn that the child is unwell (and that Paxton has been using Rigelian <b>gene</b> <b>therapy</b> to treat himself). Seeking to fine-tune their attack, Paxton then threatens T'Pol to force Tucker to optimize the targeting system of the array.|$|E

5|$|Geneticists {{often use}} viruses as vectors to {{introduce}} genes into cells {{that they are}} studying. This is useful for making the cell produce a foreign substance, or to study the effect of introducing a new gene into the genome. In similar fashion, virotherapy uses viruses as vectors to treat various diseases, as they can specifically target cells and DNA. It shows promising use {{in the treatment of}} cancer and in <b>gene</b> <b>therapy.</b> Eastern European scientists have used phage therapy as an alternative to antibiotics for some time, and interest in this approach is increasing, because of the high level of antibiotic resistance now found in some pathogenic bacteria.|$|E
5|$|Further {{examination}} of the blood of both Zero and the dead man reveal that their condition has been induced through <b>gene</b> <b>therapy.</b> Watts and Black theorize that the DOE is developing a biological weapon which would incite violence and rioting in a targeted population; they learn that the research is being conducted by scientists involved in the Human Genome Project. Later, the body of Knox is found at a nearby morgue. Later, Black and Watts, assisted by local police, raid an office building connected to the project, which they believe is using homeless shelters to test their pathogen. They hope to recover Zero in the raid, but find him cogent and working for the project—his real name is Dr. William Kramer, and he denies any knowledge of the incident. Black believes Kramer was accidentally infected during his work, and finds a photograph in the man's office, showing him in military uniform, {{taking part in the}} 1994 Rwandan Genocide.|$|E

40|$|International audienceAmong {{innovative}} strategies {{developed for}} cancer treatments, <b>gene</b> <b>therapies</b> stand {{of great interest}} despite their well-known limitations in targeting, delivery, toxicity or stability. The success of any given gene-therapy is highly dependent on the carrier efficiency. New approaches are often revisiting the mythic trojan horse concept to carry therapeutic nucleic acid, i. e. DNAs, RNAs or small interfering RNAs, to pathologic tumor site. Recent investigations are focusing on engineering carrying modalities to overtake the above limitations bringing new promise to cancer patients. This review describes recent advances and perspectives for <b>gene</b> <b>therapies</b> devoted to tumor treatment, taking advantage of available knowledge in biotechnology and medicine...|$|R
40|$|While {{knowledge}} of genetics originated centuries ago, the field had difficulty progressing until the Human Genome Project (HGP) expanded this topic of study by offering new insights on human genetics. The HGP {{was created to}} organize and lay out the complete set of genetic material in a species otherwise known as the genome, this project also aided in the discovery of diseasecausing genes. The recognition of disease-causing genes led to the formulation of <b>gene</b> <b>therapies</b> to treat specific disorders such as cystic fibrosis. This study analyzes not only how ethics are impacting the development of cystic fibrosis <b>gene</b> <b>therapies</b> but also exhibits how scientist view ethical concerns on these treatments and their beliefs. It also demonstrates a deeper connection to the awareness of ethical concerns {{in the scientific community}} because even though some of the ethical issues are common knowledge they are not deeply analyzed by individuals in the science field. The study was conducted by interviewing professionals in the Science filed focused on working with cystic fibrosis. The results of the experiment show a hindering in the development of cystic fibrosis <b>gene</b> <b>therapies,</b> {{this is due to the}} ethical issue causing limitations in the research process. Ethics has played a role in the development of cystic fibrosis <b>gene</b> <b>therapies</b> considering that this research began in the 1990 ’s. The development of new technology urges the scientific community to deal with societal concerns about this research in order to bring these treatments to the public and improve the patients’ quality of life...|$|R
