5|$|The use {{of black}} and white is {{regarded}} as dramatic, and although it may have been influenced by 1940s and 1950s works of Willem <b>de</b> <b>Kooning,</b> Franz Kline and Robert Motherwell, it is more likely a commentary on Mondrian's 1917 Composition in Black and White. Alternatively, {{it may have been a}} reference to another of Mondrian's Pre-World War I black and white oval paintings, such as Pier and ocean, 1915. This complementary source art was common of Lichtenstein's 1960s work on frequently advertised objects. Lichtenstein describes his sources as Mondrian Plus and Minus paintings.|$|E
5|$|Tulsa is home {{to several}} internationally renowned museums. Located in the former villa of oil pioneer Waite Phillips in Midtown Tulsa, the Philbrook Museum of Art is {{considered}} one of the top 50 fine art museums in the United States, and is one of only five to offer a combination of a historic home, formal gardens, and an art collection. The museum's expansive collection includes work by a diverse group of artists including Pablo Picasso, Andrew Wyeth, Giovanni Bellini, Domenico di Pace Beccafumi, Willem <b>de</b> <b>Kooning,</b> William Merritt Chase, Auguste Rodin and Georgia O'Keeffe. Philbrook also maintains a satellite campus in downtown Tulsa.|$|E
5|$|In {{the visual}} arts, the Hudson River School was a mid-19th-century {{movement}} {{in the tradition of}} European naturalism. The realist paintings of Thomas Eakins are now widely celebrated. The 1913 Armory Show in New York City, an exhibition of European modernist art, shocked the public and transformed the U.S. art scene. Georgia O'Keeffe, Marsden Hartley, and others experimented with new, individualistic styles. Major artistic movements such as the abstract expressionism of Jackson Pollock and Willem <b>de</b> <b>Kooning</b> and the pop art of Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein developed largely in the United States. The tide of modernism and then postmodernism has brought fame to American architects such as Frank Lloyd Wright, Philip Johnson, and Frank Gehry. Americans have long been important in the modern artistic medium of photography, with major photographers including Alfred Stieglitz, Edward Steichen, and Ansel Adams.|$|E
5|$|In the 1870s, sculptors Augustus Saint-Gaudens and Daniel Chester French {{lived and}} worked near the Square. By the 1920s, Washington Square Park was nationally {{recognized}} as {{a focal point for}} artistic and moral rebellion. As such, the Washington Square campus became more diverse and bustled with urban energy, contributing to academic change at NYU. Famed residents of this time include Eugene O'Neill, John Sloan, and Maurice Prendergast. In the 1930s, the abstract expressionists Jackson Pollock and Willem <b>de</b> <b>Kooning,</b> and the realists Edward Hopper and Thomas Hart Benton had studios around Washington Square. In the 1960s the area became one of the centers of the beat and folk generation, when Allen Ginsberg and Bob Dylan settled there. This led to tension with the university, which at the time {{was in the midst of}} an aggressive facilities expansion phase. In 1975, the university opened The Grey Art Gallery at 100 Washington Square East, housing the NYU art collection and featuring museum quality exhibitions.|$|E
25|$|In {{a related}} work, his Erased <b>de</b> <b>Kooning</b> Drawing of 1953, Rauschenberg erased a drawing by {{abstract}} expressionist artist Willem <b>de</b> <b>Kooning.</b> Perhaps surprisingly, <b>De</b> <b>Kooning</b> was sympathetic to Rauschenberg's aims and implicitly endorsed this experiment {{by providing the}} younger artist {{with one of his}} own drawings which was very densely worked, taking 2 months and many erasers for Rauschenberg to (incompletely) erase.|$|E

Part of the Willem <b>de</b> <b>Kooning</b> Academy is the Piet Zwart Institute for postgraduate studies and research in Fine Art, Media Design and Retail Design. The Piet Zwart Institute boasts a selective roster of emerging international artists.|$|E
25|$|Arshile Gorky's {{portrait}} {{of what may}} be his friend Willem <b>de</b> <b>Kooning</b> (left) {{is an example of the}} evolution of Abstract Expressionism from the context of figure painting, cubism and surrealism. Along with his friends <b>de</b> <b>Kooning</b> and John D. Graham Gorky created bio-morphically shaped and abstracted figurative compositions that by the 1940s evolved into totally abstract paintings. Gorky's work seems to be a careful analysis of memory, emotion and shape, using line and color to express feeling and nature.|$|E
25|$|While New York and {{the world}} were yet {{unfamiliar}} with the New York avant-garde by the late 1940s, most of the artists who have become household names today had their well-established patron critics: Clement Greenberg advocated Jackson Pollock and the color field painters like Clyfford Still, Mark Rothko, Barnett Newman, Adolph Gottlieb and Hans Hofmann; Harold Rosenberg seemed to prefer the action painters such as Willem <b>de</b> <b>Kooning</b> and Franz Kline, {{as well as the}} seminal paintings of Arshile Gorky; Thomas B. Hess, the managing editor of ARTnews, championed Willem <b>de</b> <b>Kooning.</b>|$|E
25|$|Visual artists Jackson Pollock, Charles Hawthorne, Edwin Dickinson, Marsden Hartley, Robert Motherwell, Hans Hofmann, Franz Kline, Willem <b>de</b> <b>Kooning,</b> Henry Hensche, George Morrison, Herman Maril, Max Bohm, Nela Arias-Misson, and Anne Packard.|$|E
25|$|It {{also has}} fine Contemporary Paintings and Creations in the Bloch Building by Willem <b>de</b> <b>Kooning,</b> Fairfield Porter ("Mirror"), Wayne Thiebaud ("Bikini Girl"), Richard Diebenkorn, Agnes Martin, Bridget Riley, and Alfred Jensen.|$|E

25|$|From {{the fall}} of 1952 to the spring of 1953 Rauschenberg {{traveled}} through Europe and North Africa with his fellow artist and partner Cy Twombly. In Morocco, he created collages and boxes out of trash. He took them back to Italy and exhibited them at galleries in Rome and Florence. A lot of them sold; those that did not he threw into the river Arno. From his stay, 38 collages survived. In a famously cited incident of 1953, Rauschenberg erased a drawing by <b>de</b> <b>Kooning,</b> which he obtained from his colleague {{for the express purpose}} of erasing it as an artistic statement. The result is titled Erased <b>de</b> <b>Kooning</b> Drawing.|$|E
25|$|The Mildred Lane Kemper Art Museum {{on campus}} houses {{most of the}} University's art and {{sculpture}} collections, including pieces by Jackson Pollock, Robert Rauschenberg, Jenny Holzer, Pablo Picasso, Max Ernst, Willem <b>de</b> <b>Kooning,</b> Henri Matisse, Joan Miró, and Rembrandt van Rijn, among others.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the other}} artists who popularized East Hampton as an artists colony were Willem <b>de</b> <b>Kooning,</b> Mark Rothko, Franz Kline, Ian Hornak, Larry Rivers, Alfonso Ossorio, Robert Motherwell, Andy Warhol, John Ferren and Thomas Moran, {{as well as}} art dealers Leo Castelli and Ileana Sonnabend.|$|E
25|$|Soon after, in 1926, Martínez {{traveled}} to Chicago, {{where he studied}} and worked for over five years at the Fine Arts Institute of Chicago under the tutoring of Ruth VanSickle Ford. In Chicago, Martínez befriended and worked alongside Edward Hopper, Isamu Noguchi, Willem <b>de</b> <b>Kooning</b> and Edgar Kaufmann, Jr., among others.|$|E
25|$|Hopper's {{influence}} on the art world and pop culture is undeniable. Though he had no formal students, many artists have cited him as an influence, including Willem <b>de</b> <b>Kooning,</b> Jim Dine, and Mark Rothko. An illustration of Hopper's influence is Rothko's early work Composition I (c. 1931), which is a direct paraphrase of Hopper's Chop Suey.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, other action painters, notably Willem <b>de</b> <b>Kooning,</b> Arshile Gorky, Norman Bluhm, Joan Mitchell, and James Brooks, (see gallery) used imagery via either {{abstract}} landscape or as expressionistic {{visions of}} the figure to articulate their highly personal and powerful evocations. James Brooks' paintings were particularly poetic and highly prescient in relationship to Lyrical Abstraction that became prominent in the late 1960s and the 1970s.|$|E
25|$|It {{also holds}} works {{by a wide}} range of {{influential}} European and American artists including Georges Braque, Marcel Duchamp, Walker Evans, Helen Frankenthaler, Alberto Giacometti, Arshile Gorky, Hans Hofmann, Edward Hopper, Paul Klee, Franz Kline, Willem <b>de</b> <b>Kooning,</b> Dorothea Lange, Fernand Léger, Roy Lichtenstein, Morris Louis, René Magritte, Aristide Maillol, Joan Miró, Henry Moore, Kenneth Noland, Georgia O'Keeffe, Jackson Pollock, Robert Rauschenberg, Auguste Rodin, Mark Rothko, David Smith, Frank Stella, and hundreds of others.|$|E
25|$|Notable {{artists in}} the {{collection}} include: Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, Mary Cassatt, Thomas Eakins, Henry Moore, Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko, Franz Kline, Hans Hofmann, Morris Louis, Kenneth Noland, John Chamberlain, Francis Bacon, Willem <b>de</b> <b>Kooning,</b> Milton Avery, Ellsworth Kelly, Louise Nevelson, Arshile Gorky, Edward Hopper, Larry Rivers, and Raphael Soyer among others. Outside the museum is a sculpture garden, featuring works by artists including Auguste Rodin, David Smith, Alexander Calder, Jean-Robert Ipoustéguy, Jeff Koons, and others.|$|E
25|$|The modern {{collection}} on {{the plaza}} level displays works from 1900 to the 1970s, largely populated by the Janice and Henri Lazarof collection. In December 2007, Janice and Henri Lazarof gave LACMA 130 mostly modernist works estimated to be worth more than $100 million. The collection includes 20 works by Picasso, watercolors and paintings by Paul Klee and Wassily Kandinsky and {{a considerable number of}} sculptures by Alberto Giacometti, Constantin Brâncuși, Henry Moore, Willem <b>de</b> <b>Kooning,</b> Joan Miró, Louise Nevelson, Archipenko, and Arp.|$|E
25|$|Throughout his life, Jensen met and {{collaborated with}} many already or {{subsequently}} influential artists, most notably Mark Rothko, Sam Francis, Jean Dubuffet, Joan Miró, and Allan Kaprow, and held exhibitions with contemporaries including Ulfert Wilke, Robert Becker, Sally Hazelet, Franz Kline, Joseph Cornell, Willem <b>de</b> <b>Kooning</b> and Robert Rauschenberg. A well traveled {{citizen of the}} world, he spoke five languages and similarly refused to settle into any one artistic movement, remaining a challenge to categorize—as noted by Peter Schjeldahl in his essay “Jensen’s Difficulty”.|$|E
25|$|In {{the years}} after World War II, {{a group of young}} New York artists known as the New York School formed the first truly {{original}} school of painting in America that exerted a major influence on foreign artists: abstract expressionism. Among the movement's leaders were Jackson Pollock (1912–1956), Willem <b>de</b> <b>Kooning</b> (1904–1997), and Mark Rothko (1903–1970). The abstract expressionists abandoned formal composition and representation of real objects to concentrate on instinctual arrangements of space and color and to demonstrate the effects of the physical action of painting on the canvas.|$|E
25|$|Alongside {{works by}} Andy Warhol and Willem <b>de</b> <b>Kooning,</b> Klein's {{painting}} RE 46 (1960) {{was among the}} top-five sellers at Christie's Post-War and Contemporary Art sale in May 2006. His monochromatic blue sponge painting sold for $4,720,000. Previously, his painting RE I (1958) had sold for $6,716,000 at Christie's New York in November 2000. In 2008, MG 9 (1962), a monochromatic gold painting, sold for $21,000,000 at Christie's. FC1 (Fire Color 1) (1962), a nearly 10-foot long panel created with a blowtorch, water and two models, sold for $36.4 million at Christie's in 2012.|$|E
25|$|The {{paintings}} of Abstract expressionist figures like Jackson Pollock and Willem <b>de</b> <b>Kooning</b> are indexical {{in that they}} stand effectively as a signature on canvas. In contrast, Neo-Dadaists like Johns and Rauschenberg seemed preoccupied with a lessening of the reliance of their art on indexical qualities, seeking instead to create meaning solely {{through the use of}} conventional symbols. Some have interpreted this as a rejection of the hallowed individualism of the abstract expressionists. Their works also imply symbols existing outside of any referential context. Johns' Flag, for instance, is primarily a visual object, divorced from its symbolic connotations and reduced to something in-itself.|$|E
25|$|Despite its low {{popularity}} {{among the general}} public, Krazy Kat gained a wide following among intellectuals. In 1922, a jazz ballet based on the comic was produced and scored by John Alden Carpenter; though the performance played to sold-out crowds on two nights and was given positive reviews in The New York Times and The New Republic, it failed to boost the strip's popularity as Hearst had hoped. In addition to Seldes and Cummings, contemporary admirers of Krazy Kat included Willem <b>de</b> <b>Kooning,</b> H. L. Mencken, and Jack Kerouac. More recent scholars and authors have seen the strip as reflecting the Dada movement and prefiguring postmodernism.|$|E
25|$|In October 2006, Geffen sold two {{paintings}} by Jasper Johns and a <b>De</b> <b>Kooning</b> from his collection for a combined sum of $143.5million. On November 3, 2006, the New York Times reported that Geffen had sold Pollock's 1948 painting No. 5, 1948 from his collection for $140million (£73.35million) to Mexican financier David Martinez. Martinez {{is the founder}} of London-based Fintech Advisory Ltd, a financial house that specializes in buying Third World debt. The sale made No. 5, 1948 the most expensive painting ever sold (outstripping the $134million paid in October 2006 for Gustav Klimt's portrait Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I, purchased by cosmetics heir Ronald Lauder).|$|E
25|$|In {{distinction}} to {{the emotional}} energy and gestural surface marks of abstract expressionists such as Jackson Pollock and Willem <b>de</b> <b>Kooning,</b> the Color Field painters initially appeared to be cool and austere, effacing the individual mark in favor of large, flat areas of color, which these artists {{considered to be the}} essential nature of visual abstraction, along with the actual shape of the canvas, which later in the 1960s Frank Stella in particular achieved in unusual ways with combinations of curved and straight edges. However Color Field painting has proven to be both sensual and deeply expressive albeit in a different way from gestural Abstract expressionism.|$|E
25|$|Alongside Porto, Rotterdam was European Capital of Culture in 2001. The {{city has}} its own orchestra, the Rotterdam Philharmonic, with its well-regarded young music {{director}} Yannick Nézet-Séguin; a large congress and concert building called De Doelen; several theaters (including the new Luxor) and movie theatres; and the Ahoy Rotterdam complex {{in the south of}} the city, which is used for pop concerts, exhibitions, tennis tournaments, and other activities. A major zoo called Diergaarde Blijdorp is situated at the northwest side of Rotterdam, complete with a walkthrough sea aquarium called the Oceanium. The city is home to the Willem <b>de</b> <b>Kooning</b> Academy and Piet Zwart Institute.|$|E
25|$|Beat {{writers and}} artists flocked to Greenwich Village in New York City in the late 1950s because of low rent and the 'small town' element of the scene. Folksongs, {{readings}} and discussions often took place in Washington Square Park. Allen Ginsberg {{was a big part}} of the scene in the Village, as was Burroughs, who lived at 69 Bedford Street. Burroughs, Ginsberg, Kerouac, and other poets frequented many bars in the area including the San Remo at 93 MacDougal Street on the northwest corner of Bleeker, Chumley's, and Minetta Tavern. Jackson Pollock, Willem <b>de</b> <b>Kooning,</b> Franz Kline, and other abstract expressionists were also frequent visitors and collaborators of the beats.|$|E
25|$|The other Abstract expressionists {{followed}} Pollock's breakthrough {{with new}} breakthroughs of their own. In a sense the innovations of Jackson Pollock, Willem <b>de</b> <b>Kooning,</b> Franz Kline, Mark Rothko, Philip Guston, Hans Hofmann, Clyfford Still, Barnett Newman, Ad Reinhardt, Richard Pousette-Dart, Robert Motherwell, Peter Voulkos, and others opened the floodgates to {{the diversity and}} scope of all the art that followed them. The new art movements of the 1960s essentially followed the lead of abstract expressionism {{and in particular the}} innovations of Pollock, <b>De</b> <b>Kooning,</b> Rothko, Hofmann, Reinhardt, and Newman. The radical Anti-Formalist movements of the 1960s and 1970s including Fluxus, Neo-Dada, Conceptual art, and the feminist art movement {{can be traced to the}} innovations of abstract expressionism. Rereadings into abstract art, done by art historians such as Linda Nochlin, Griselda Pollock and Catherine de Zegher critically shows, however, that pioneer women artists who have produced major innovations in modern art had been ignored by the official accounts of its history, but finally began to achieve long overdue recognition in the wake of the abstract expressionist movement of the 1940s and 1950s. Abstract expressionism emerged as a major art movement in New York City during the 1950s and thereafter several leading art galleries began to include the abstract expressionists in exhibitions and as regulars in their rosters. Some of those prominent 'uptown' galleries included: the Charles Egan Gallery, the Sidney Janis Gallery, the Betty Parsons Gallery, the Kootz Gallery, the Tibor de Nagy Gallery, the Stable Gallery, the Leo Castelli Gallery as well as others; and several downtown galleries known at the time as the Tenth Street galleries exhibited many emerging younger artists working in the abstract expressionist vein.|$|E
25|$|Willem <b>de</b> <b>Kooning,</b> David Smith, Dorothy Dehner, Jean Charlot, Edward Hopper, Alexander Calder, Rockwell and Sally Kent, Thomas Hart Benton, Allen Tucker, Max Weber, Kimon Nicolaidies, {{and many}} others. As a student, she was {{associated}} with the Art Students League as a young woman prior to 1900 and in 1913 began a serious role in the New York art scene at the Art Students League as a Secretary Treasurer and member of the Board of Control along with her husband, the artist Thomas Furlong. She taught art for over 56 years in New York and she was active with the Whitney Studio Club during the formative years of the organization in New York City a fact revealed in the Studio Club archives.|$|E
25|$|Post-Second World War American {{painting}} called Abstract expressionism included {{artists like}} Jackson Pollock, Willem <b>de</b> <b>Kooning,</b> Arshile Gorky, Mark Rothko, Hans Hofmann, Clyfford Still, Franz Kline, Adolph Gottlieb, Barnett Newman, Mark Tobey, James Brooks, Philip Guston, Robert Motherwell, Conrad Marca-Relli, Jack Tworkov, William Baziotes, Richard Pousette-Dart, Ad Reinhardt, Esteban Vicente, Hedda Sterne, Jimmy Ernst, Bradley Walker Tomlin, and Theodoros Stamos, among others. American Abstract expressionism {{got its name}} in 1946 from the art critic Robert Coates. It is seen as combining the emotional intensity and self-denial of the German Expressionists with the anti-figurative aesthetic of the European abstract schools such as Futurism, the Bauhaus and Synthetic Cubism. Abstract expressionism, Action painting, and Color Field painting are synonymous with the New York School.|$|E
25|$|During the 1930s {{through the}} 1960s as {{abstract}} painting in America and Europe evolved into movements such as Abstract Expressionism, Color Field painting, Post painterly abstraction, Op art, hard-edge painting, Minimal art, shaped canvas painting, and Lyrical Abstraction. Other artists reacted {{as a response}} to the tendency toward abstraction allowing imagery to continue through various new contexts like the Bay Area Figurative Movement in the 1950s and new forms of expressionism from the 1940s through the 1960s. In Italy during this time, Giorgio Morandi was the foremost still life painter, exploring a wide variety of approaches to depicting everyday bottles and kitchen implements. Throughout the 20th century many painters practiced Realism and used expressive imagery; practicing landscape and figurative painting with contemporary subjects and solid technique, and unique expressivity like Milton Avery, John D. Graham, Fairfield Porter, Edward Hopper, Andrew Wyeth, Balthus, Francis Bacon, Frank Auerbach, Lucian Freud, Leon Kossoff, Philip Pearlstein, Willem <b>de</b> <b>Kooning,</b> Arshile Gorky, Grace Hartigan, Robert De Niro, Sr., Elaine <b>de</b> <b>Kooning</b> and others. Along with Henri Matisse, Pablo Picasso, Pierre Bonnard, Georges Braque, and other 20th-century masters. The figurative work of Francis Bacon, Frida Kahlo, Edward Hopper, Lucian Freud Andrew Wyeth and others served as a kind of alternative to abstract expressionism. One of the most well-known images in 20th-century American art is Wyeth's painting, Christina's World, currently in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. It depicts a woman lying on the ground in a treeless, mostly tawny field, looking up at and crawling towards a gray house on the horizon; a barn and various other small outbuildings are adjacent to the house. This tempera work, done in a realist style, is nearly always on display at the Museum of Modern Art in New York.|$|E
