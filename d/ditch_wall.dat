Beyond a space of 15 to 100 m there often followed another <b>ditch</b> or <b>wall</b> structure. Today, traces of this old fortification may be found above Altenkleusheim.|$|R
50|$|Most of {{the outer}} defences of the fort survive {{including}} parts {{of the outer}} works which extend into the adjacent recreation grounds {{to the east and}} west.

From the hill it is possible to see Fort Clarence tower to the west, and the remains of Fort Amherst to the north east. A <b>ditch,</b> <b>wall</b> and (reputedly) tunnels were to link the three into a single fortified Napoleonic defensive line, defending the naval docks against a (land-based) attack from the south.|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} aimed to examine {{detailed}} structure of papilla vallata in porcupines by light and scanning electron microscopy. For this purpose, 5 mature porcupines (3 males and 2 females) were used. Papilla vallata was one each in both side of median line in dorsal surface of tongue base. There was taste buds (Caliculus gustatorius) only inner wall of ditch of papilla. Maximum 9 taste buds were counted on one side. The mean {{surface area of}} papilla <b>ditch</b> <b>wall</b> was calculated as 30. 26 mm 2. In addition, mean micrometric measurements of papilla vallata were width of papilla (3225 μm), length of papilla (1875 μm), depth of ditch (1890 μm), length of the taste bud (206. 25 μm), width of the taste bud (117. 86 μm) and epithelial thickness (362. 5 μm). Two types of taste bud cells that were lightly dyed (Epitheliocytus sensorius gustatorius) and densely dyed (Epitheliocytus sustentans) were observed as arranged vertically through depth of ditches. The borders of surface epithelial cells of papilla vallata were clearly observed on scanning electron microscope. There were micropits and microridges on cell surfaces. In conclusion, papilla vallata of porcupines were examined in detail by light and scanning electron microscopy and then {{the similarities and differences}} with other mammals were determined...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was a {{response}} to the discovery of two artifacts found in a <b>ditch</b> <b>wall</b> near Harney Lake, Oregon. These were lying on a buried lake floor that appeared to be of late Pleistocene or early Recent age. Other sediments exposed in the ditch seemed to relate to {{at least some of the}} phases of the pluvial lake sequence in the Harney Basin. Three problems were considered: (1) the geomorphology and dating of the pluvial lake stillstands, (2) whether the original artifacts were part of a larger early site, and (3) whether there was any relationship between archaeological sites and geomorphic features in the area. These problems were approached in the field by stratigraphic mapping of exposed sediments and by an archaeological survey of a defined study area. Test excavations were made adjacent to the location of the original artifact discovery to search for other cultural material. Beachline records of four stillstands of Pluvial Lake Malheur are preserved in the exposed sediments. The youngest beachline is undated. Three others were 14 C dated from associated fossil molluscs at 32, 000, 9620 and 8680 B. P. At least in the case of the 8680 B. P. lake, the Harney Basin was filled to overflowing and was a part of the Columbia River system. The Voltage basalt flow, which dammed the outlet of the Basin in Malheur Gap, was in place by 32, 000 years ago. There is no evidence for a diversion of the Basin outlet to Crane Gap following this event. Molluscan fossils and diatoms were used, along with soil texture analyses, to help identify and differentiate sedimentary deposits and to draw environmental inferences. Artifacts were found both on and beneath buried beach deposits of the 8680 B. P. lake. Four of the five sites in the study area were either on wave-cut terraces or other lakeshore features associated with this lake. Diagnostic artifacts are Lind Coulee points, crescents, basally ground leaf-shaped points, and what are apparently true blades. The sites seem to have been located to take advantage of shallow water littoral zone resources. Fish may have been an important dietary item of the early Harney Basin dwellers. Large salmonid vertebrae from fish in the 10 kg weight class are found on the playa. By using the relationship between landforms and elevations it may be possible to predict the general age class of other sites on the margin of the playas...|$|E

However, Yamagata was determined to leave nothing to chance.

However, Xenophon urges the reader not to reject a horse that can not easily perform these tasks, as this is more likely due to lack of experience than inability, and if {{the horse is}} trained he will soon be able to perform these tasks easily. He does warn, however, that a nervous, skittish, or vicious horse is unacceptable as a war-mount.|$|R

[...] The excavation after thirty-two years provided information on decay rates and patterns of deposited objects, which are of use to forensic scientists. Nonintrusive examination of the ditch has indicated that in this particular environment (exposed chalky hill), after about ten years the general appearance no longer makes rapid changes in appearance and can be considered relatively stable.|$|R

25|$|Furthermore, {{additional}} signaling {{and observation}} towers were frequently built outside the city, and were sometimes fortified in a castle-like fashion. The {{border of the}} area of influence {{of the city was}} often partially or fully defended by elaborate <b>ditches,</b> <b>walls</b> and hedges. The crossing points were usually guarded by gates or gate houses. These defenses were regularly checked by riders, who often also served as the gate keepers. Long stretches of these defenses can still be seen to this day, and even some gates are still intact. To further protect their territory, rich cities also established castles in their area of influence. An example of this practice is the Romanian Bran Castle, which was intended to protect nearby Kronstadt (today's Braşov).|$|R
40|$|<b>Ditches,</b> <b>walls,</b> and palisades are extant in {{continental}} Europe from {{as early}} as the Neolithic, but important aspects changed {{in the course of the}} 2 nd millennium BC. A review of the spectrum of dated sites from Central Europe shows that the expansion of metalworking techniques preceded the widespread occupation of high ground. Hill-top sites at crossroads and river crossings proved to be a permanent feature, though shifts in location occurred frequently. The motivation for the construction of walls and ramparts was probably not uniform. Certain walls were clearly built to be seen from afar. Hence, they can be explained as signs of presence and/or prominence. In other cases the aspect of enhanced security deserves special attention. The wide variation in size and regional settings of hill-forts as well as the divergent traces of occupation invalidate any unitary explanatio...|$|R
