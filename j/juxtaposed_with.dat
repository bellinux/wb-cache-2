5|$|The film {{contains}} no dialogue {{for the first}} and last 20 minutes or so.

5|$|Read-Only Memory is a British {{publisher}} of art books on topics of video game history and culture. Following {{a resurgence of}} interest in 1980s and '90s British video game development, the company crowdfunded and produced four art books: an oral history of that Britsoft era, two books on British developers Sensible Software and The Bitmap Brothers, and a definitive volume on the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis, for which the publisher became best known.

Reviewers were particularly impressed with each book's breadth of unreleased concepts.|$|E

5|$|Released as the album's second {{single in}} mid-1986, {{the song was}} a {{commercial}} success. It became Madonna's fourth number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100, and performed well internationally, reaching the top position in the United Kingdom and Australia. It was well received by music critics and was frequently cited as a highlight in the album. The music video, directed by James Foley, shows Madonna's second image makeover, featuring her with a more toned and muscular body, and cropped platinum blonde hair. It portrayed a storyline where Madonna is trying to tell her father about her pregnancy. The images are <b>juxtaposed</b> <b>with</b> shots of Madonna dancing and singing in a small, darkened studio, and spending a romantic evening with her boyfriend.|$|E

5|$|The {{music video}} starts with {{shots of the}} New York skyline, the Staten Island Ferry, and {{character}} close-ups. Madonna plays a teenager, who is seen walking along a lane. Then it shows her thinking about her father, played by Danny Aiello, {{and how much he}} loves her. She then sees her boyfriend, played by actor Alex McArthur, coming along. The images are <b>juxtaposed</b> <b>with</b> shots of Madonna dancing and singing in a small, darkened studio. Madonna then moves away from her friends, who warn her from her boyfriend. She and her boyfriend spend a romantic evening together on a barge where they reflect upon their lives after watching an elderly couple. Then Madonna finds out that she is pregnant and after much hesitation tells her father. They have a few hours of tension between them. Her father eventually accepts the pregnancy, and the final scene is a reconciliatory embrace between father and daughter.|$|E
5|$|The {{positioning}} of the bodies and their musculature refers to classical ideals of physical beauty and masculine camaraderie evocative of Greek art. The reclining figure is a paraphrase of the Dying Gaul, and is <b>juxtaposed</b> <b>with</b> the far less formal self-depiction by the artist. It is possible that Eakins was seeking to reconcile an ancient theme with a modern interpretation; the subject was contemporary, but the poses {{of some of the}} figures recall those of classical sculpture. One possible influence by a contemporary source was Scène d'été, painted in 1869 by Frédéric Bazille (1841–70). It is not unlikely that Eakins saw the painting at the Salon while studying in Paris, and would have been sympathetic to its depiction of male bathers in a modern setting.|$|E
5|$|Vaughan Williams's choral {{works for}} concert {{performance}} include settings of both {{secular and religious}} words. The former include Toward the Unknown Region to words by Whitman (composed 1904–06), Five Tudor Portraits, words by John Skelton (1935), and the Shakespearean Serenade to Music (in its alternative version for chorus and orchestra, 1938). Choral pieces with religious words include the oratorio Sancta Civitas (1923–25) and the Christmas cantata Hodie (1954). In 1953 the composer said that of his choral works Sancta Civitas was his favourite. The Dona Nobis Pacem, an impassioned anti-war cantata (1936) {{is a combination of}} both, with words from Whitman and others <b>juxtaposed</b> <b>with</b> extracts from the Latin mass, anticipating a similar mixture of sacred and secular text in Britten's War Requiem twenty-five years later.|$|E
5000|$|The band's name (originally [...] "Slutface") {{was chosen}} to <b>juxtapose</b> <b>with</b> their feminist message and grab attention. In an {{unreleased}} 2016 interview, the band said that the controversial name didn't cause them too much trouble back home, with their increasing popularity even leading to the Norwegian government to pay them to tour high schools in their home country. Despite Norway's large English-speaking population, the band said that the name {{was not nearly as}} provocative there as it {{would turn out to be}} in the UK and America.|$|R

5|$|The camera {{work and}} editing work {{together}} to further heighten the frightening qualities of the film. Eleanor is often viewed from above, and in one scene the camera closes in so tightly on her that she is forced backward over a railing. Eleanor's viewpoint is often <b>juxtaposed</b> <b>with</b> eerie views of the house, as if both viewpoints were the same. Many of the editing choices in the film are also used to heighten the audience's discomfort. There {{are a number of}} rapid cuts in the film that throw off the viewer's sense of spatial orientation, and Dutch angles are used to imply that reality is off-kilter. Cutting on action—showing the characters exiting a room to the right, only to show them entering the next room from the left—is often violated, so that the viewer cannot get a clear sense of which rooms and hallways are connected to one another. The audience also lacks temporal clues. There are few shots in which they can see out a window to determine whether it's night or day. When Eleanor is rescued by Dr. Markway on the unstable spiral staircase, some of the windows nearby show strong sunlight streaming in, while others show darkness outside.|$|E
5|$|While using Dante's terza rima style, {{the poem}} {{continues}} by describing the Battle of Britain. The image of warfare merges with {{the depiction of}} Pentecost, and the Holy Spirit is <b>juxtaposed</b> <b>with</b> the air-raids on London. In the second section, a ghost, representing the poets of the past stuck between worlds, begins talking to the narrator of the poem. The ghost discusses change, art in general, and how humankind is flawed. The only way to overcome the problematic condition of humanity, according to the ghost, is to experience purgation through fire. The fire is described {{in a manner similar}} to Julian of Norwich's writing about God's love and discussed in relationship to the shirt of Nessus, a shirt that burns its wearer. Little Gidding continues by describing the eternalness of the present and how history exists in a pattern. The poem concludes by explaining how sacrifice is needed to allow an individual to die into life and be reborn, and that salvation should be the goal of humankind.|$|E

25|$|Yamaguchi {{intentionally}} {{tried to}} create uncool and old-fashioned lyrics, in order to <b>juxtapose</b> <b>with</b> the song's modern sound. He wrote the lyrics an hommage to kayōkyoku pop lyrics of the 1970s and 1980s, specifically the songs of Momoe Yamaguchi and Akina Nakamori. Yamaguchi felt that stylistically, the song's chorus melody was directly inspired by Shōwa period kayōkyoku, but someone unfamiliar with the genre might misinterpret as purely inspired by dance music. After Yamaguchi finished songwriting, the band's guitarist Motoharu Iwadera arranged the initial demo, with bassist Ami Kusakari later reworking the demo to blend Iwadera's style with hers.|$|R
