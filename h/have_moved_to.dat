5|$|Barbadian {{culture and}} music are {{mixtures}} of European and African elements, with minimal influence from {{the indigenous peoples}} of the island, about whom little is known. Significant numbers of Asian, specifically Chinese and Japanese, people <b>have</b> <b>moved</b> <b>to</b> Barbados, but their music is unstudied and has had little impact on Barbadian music.|$|E
5|$|Immigration since World War II {{has given}} Glasgow, Edinburgh and Dundee small South Asian communities. In 2011, {{there were an}} {{estimated}} 49,000 ethnically Pakistani people living in Scotland, making them the largest non-White ethnic group.

5|$|Bouyon (Boo-Yon) {{is a form}} {{of popular}} music of Dominica, also known as jump up music in Guadeloupe and Martinique. The best-known band in the genre is Windward Caribbean Kulture (WCK), who {{originated}} the style in 1988 by experimenting elements of kadans (or cadence-lypso), lapo kabwit drumming, the folk style jing-ping, and a quick-paced electronic drum pattern. From a language perspective, Bouyon draws on English and Dominican Creole French. More recently, deejays with raggamuffin-style vocals (bouyon-muffin) <b>have</b> <b>moved</b> <b>to</b> the fore, updating the sound for the New Generation.|$|E
5|$|During {{the twentieth}} century the Doom Bar was {{regularly}} dredged to improve access to Padstow. By the 1930s, when Commander H.E. Turner surveyed the estuary, there were two channels round the Doom Bar, and {{it is thought that}} the main channel may <b>have</b> <b>moved</b> <b>to</b> the east side in 1929. By 2010 the original channel had disappeared. The estuary is regularly dredged by Padstow Harbour Commission's dredgers, Sandsnipe and Mannin.|$|E

5|$|Large {{numbers of}} Christians from {{throughout}} Jordan, particularly from al-Salt, <b>have</b> <b>moved</b> <b>to</b> Amman. Nearby Fuheis is a predominantly Christian town located {{to the northwest}} of the city. A small Armenian Catholic community of around 70 families {{is present in the}} city. Ecclesiastical courts for matters of personal status are also located in Amman. A total of 16 historic churches are located in Umm ar-Rasas ruins in Al-Jeezah district; the site is believed to have initially served as Roman fortified military camps which gradually became a town around the 5th century AD. It has not been completely excavated. It was influenced by several civilizations including the Romans, Byzantines and Muslims. The site contains some well-preserved mosaic floors, particularly the mosaic floor of the Church of Saint Stephen.|$|E
5|$|Many Welsh {{painters}} gravitated {{towards the}} art capitals of Europe. Augustus John {{and his sister}} Gwen John lived mostly in London and Paris. However, the landscapists Sir Kyffin Williams and Peter Prendergast lived in Wales {{for most of their}} lives, while remaining in touch with the wider art world. Ceri Richards was very engaged in the Welsh art scene as a teacher in Cardiff and even after moving to London. He was a figurative painter in international styles including Surrealism. Various artists <b>have</b> <b>moved</b> <b>to</b> Wales, including Eric Gill, the London-Welshman David Jones and the sculptor Jonah Jones. The Kardomah Gang was an intellectual circle centred on the poet Dylan Thomas and poet and artist Vernon Watkins in Swansea, which also included the painter Alfred Janes.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{renumbering}} in 2003, {{portions of}} US491 in New Mexico have been upgraded to a four-lane divided highway, with grade separations at the busiest interchanges. The New Mexico Department of Transportation has noted that, as sections are upgraded, fatality rates improve on the four-lane portions, but remain {{high on the}} two-lane portions. As construction has proceeded, the most dangerous portions of the highway <b>have</b> <b>moved</b> <b>to</b> points where the four-lane portion ends, and traffic merges to two lanes. This has caused the department to coordinate the phases of the upgrades to minimize the number of two-lane/four-lane transitions. Construction on the final phase was originally scheduled to begin January 2008, however the state applied for American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funds to finish the project and completion was delayed until 2012.|$|E

5|$|The {{background}} for building the rapid transit system to Nydalen, was the urban redevelopment from an industrial to a mixed {{residential and commercial}} area during the 1990s and 2000s. About 200 companies <b>have</b> <b>moved</b> <b>to</b> {{the vicinity of the}} station, and by 2007 there were 14,800 jobs in the area. The area has several large information technology and telecommunication companies, including ErgoGroup, Agresso, EDB Business Partner, Visma, TDC and NetCom. Large cultural institutions in the area include the national touring theater Riksteatret and the national touring concerts Concerts Norway, the publishing companies Hjemmet Mortensen, De Norske Bokklubbene and Schibsted's printing press.

5|$|Immediately {{before and}} {{continuing}} into {{the time of}} the dissolution of the Soviet Union, waves of Armenians from the Republic of Armenia and other former Soviet republics arrived for political reasons and economic opportunities, settling in older established Armenian communities across the country. The 1988 Armenian earthquake and the energy crisis in Armenia during the Nagorno-Karabakh War caused an estimated number of 700,000 Armenians to leave the country, most of whom ended up in Russia, still others in the US, and some in Europe. Annually, on average 2,000 people from Armenia migrated to the US since 1994, not including ethnic Armenians from Middle Eastern countries. According to the 2000 US Census, there were 65,280 Armenian-born people in the US: 57,482 in California, 1,981 in New York and 1,155 in Massachusetts. According to the 2011 American Community Survey, there were 85,150 Armenian-born people in the US, about 20,000 more than in 2000. According to the US embassy in Yerevan, about 21,000 citizens of the Republic of Armenia <b>have</b> <b>moved</b> <b>to</b> the US for permanent residency in the period from 1995 to 2012. Meanwhile, Armenian immigration from the Middle East continues, contributing to California's distinction of having, by far, the highest Armenian American population of any state.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} layers at Mummy Cave {{yielded a}} few prismatic stone blades dating to about 7300BC. Several layers contained no artifacts and were defined by soot layers. By layer6 the first parallel-oblique points appeared. By Layer8, roughly corresponding to 6500BC, the cultural evidence became continuous. Layers8, 9, 10 and 12 produced lanceolate or leaf-shaped projectile points {{which have been}} interpreted as corresponding to Angostura-style points. This implies that the inhabitants of Mummy Cave during this era were big-game hunters from the Great Plains who adapted to the mountain environment. In layer16, radiocarbon dated to 5630BC, {{a new type of}} point appeared. These Blackwater side-notched points implied the arrival of a group from eastern Nebraska or western Iowa, replacing the previous group which may <b>have</b> <b>moved</b> <b>to</b> the north. The presence of such points suggests a connection with the Simonsen Site in northeastern Iowa, which has been dated to the Early Archaic period. This transition coincided with the climatic shift to the Altithermal. Side-notched points recovered from layers21, 24 and 28 imply a return of the previous inhabitants; the easterners had moved on to the central Columbian Plateau.|$|E
