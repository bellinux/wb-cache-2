25|$|I {{had watched}} Ken Barrington – a great Test batsman – {{as a boy}} and when I broke into the England side in the late Seventies he became a father figure. In fact, he was a mentor {{to a lot of}} us then – myself, David Gower, Ian Botham, Mike Gatting. Ken was an England {{selector}} and assistant manager on the West Indies tour of 1981. There were no official coach in those days but it was to Ken that most of us turned. Unlike many retired pros, he never used the words, 'In my day...' On the first night of the Test, he suffered a heart attack in our hotel. I was woken the next morning at around 8am by tour manager Alan Smith and captain Ian Botham. I <b>knew</b> <b>something</b> <b>was</b> wrong, because Both was never up before then. They told me the news. I had tears in my eyes when we went out on to the pitch for the minute's silence and again when I was batting in the second innings. We needed over 500 to win and it soon became apparent that we weren't going to get them. But I kept thinking of him and managed to make a hundred. Kenny was a counsellor, a friend and an inspiration.|$|E
500|$|Radiohead {{used this}} process to create [...] "blocks" [...] {{of music to}} which Yorke wrote vocal melodies and lyrics. Yorke likened the process to editing a film. Guitarist Ed O'Brien told Rolling Stone: [...] "The brick walls we tended to hit were when we <b>knew</b> <b>something</b> <b>was</b> great, like 'Bloom', but not finished. We knew the song was nearly something. Then Colin (Greenwood) had that bassline, and Thom started singing. Those things {{suddenly}} made it a hundred times better." ...|$|E
500|$|... "De Mauro {{was very}} busy piecing {{together}} {{the elements of}} the plot, and his death stopped it being uncovered," [...] according to Ingroia. [...] "The other 'convergent' element in his death was the fact that he knew, from its inception, about the subversive project involving spies, neofascists and Mafia groups," [...] to stage the Borghese Coup," [...] Ingroia said. [...] "From his sources in neofascist circles, from his past in Prince Junio Valerio Borghese's crack Decima Mas unit, as well as from tip-offs from Mafia boss Emanuele D'Agostino, he <b>knew</b> <b>something</b> <b>was</b> in the offing".|$|E

500|$|The artwork for Subterranean Jungle {{features}} {{an image of}} the band inside a subway car. The photograph was taken by George DuBose at the subway station on 57th Street and Sixth Avenue in Manhattan. This cover concept was designed by Dubose, who suggested that since the B Sixth Avenue Express train stopped at the empty station for about 20 minutes. In the photograph, Marky is featured peering out the subway window—Marky was positioned this way after Johnny asked DuBose to do so because [...] "they were kicking him out of the band, but he didn't know it yet." [...] Marky recalled that he [...] "liked that shot, but [...] <b>knew</b> <b>something</b> <b>was</b> up." ...|$|E
500|$|Two songs, [...] "Low Down Freedom" [...] and [...] "Black Rose," [...] were {{produced}} by Ronny Light. [...] "We Had It All" [...] {{was produced by}} Jennings and Ken Mansfield. [...] Like the music within, the album cover was also {{at odds with the}} elaborate, often overwrought cover designs from Music Row, featuring an unpretentious shot of a smiling Jennings and his unkempt friends sat around a studio laughing and drinking. [...] In a 2008 interview with Dan MacIntosh, Shaver said of the LP, [...] "Oh, it was great, because the songs were bigger than me. And I couldn't possibly sing as good as Waylon. And at the time, Waylon was just great, so great, and I <b>knew</b> <b>something</b> <b>was</b> gonna happen good for him, and sure enough it helped me and it helped him, too, and that's a pretty good trade." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2002 Schapira interviewed three {{anonymous}} Israeli soldiers, [...] "Ariel, Alexej and Idan," [...] {{who said}} they had been on duty at the IDF post that day. They <b>knew</b> <b>something</b> <b>was</b> about to happen, one said, because of the camera crews that had gathered. One soldier said the live fire started from the high-rise Palestinian blocks known as [...] "the twins"; the shooter was firing at the IDF post, he said. The soldier added that he had not seen the al-Durrahs. The Israelis returned fire on a Palestinian station 30 metres {{to the left of the}} al-Durrahs. Their weapons were equipped with optics that allowed them to fire accurately, according to the soldier, and none of them had switched to automatic fire. In the view of the soldier, the shooting of Jamal and Muhammad was no accident. The shots did not come from the Israeli position, he said.|$|E

500|$|A {{few members}} of Cho's family, those who {{remained}} in South Korea, had concerns about his behavior during his early childhood. Cho's relatives {{thought that he was}} selectively mute or mentally ill. According to Cho's uncle, Cho [...] "didn't say much and did not mix with other children." [...] Cho's maternal great-aunt described Cho as [...] "cold" [...] and a cause of family concern from as young as eight years old. According to his great-aunt, who met him twice, Cho was extremely shy and [...] "just would not talk at all." [...] He was otherwise considered [...] "well-behaved," [...] readily obeying verbal commands and cues. The great-aunt said she <b>knew</b> <b>something</b> <b>was</b> wrong after the family's departure for the United States because she heard frequent updates about Cho's older sister but little news about Cho. During an ABC News Nightline interview on August 30, 2007, Cho's grandfather reported his concerns about Cho's behavior during childhood. According to Cho's grandfather, Cho never looked up to him to make eye contact, never called him grandfather, and never moved to embrace him.|$|E
500|$|The {{band was}} {{still searching for}} a lead singer. Chimes recalls one Billy Watts (who [...] "seemed to be, like, {{nineteen}} or eighteen then, as we all were") handling the duties for a time. Rhodes had his eye on Strummer, with whom he made exploratory contact. Jones and Levene had both seen him perform and were impressed as well. Strummer, for his part, was primed to make the switch. In April, he had taken in the opening act {{for one of his}} band's gigs—the Sex Pistols. Strummer later explained:I <b>knew</b> <b>something</b> <b>was</b> up, so I went out in the crowd which was fairly sparse. And I saw the future—with a snotty handkerchief—right in front of me. It was immediately clear. Pub rock was, [...] "Hello, you bunch of drunks, I'm gonna play these boogies and I hope you like them." [...] The Pistols came out that Tuesday evening and their attitude was, [...] "Here's our tunes, and we couldn't give a flying fuck whether you like them or not. In fact, we're gonna play them even if you fucking hate them."On 30 May, Rhodes and Levene met surreptitiously with Strummer after a 101'ers gig. Strummer was invited to meet up at the band's rehearsal location on Davis Road. After Strummer turned up, Levene grabbed his guitar, stood several inches away from Strummer, {{looked him in the eye}} and then began playing [...] "Keys to Your Heart", one of Strummer's own tunes.|$|E
2500|$|At {{a little}} after 4:00, Officer Simonsen phoned Warden Powell, who was {{across the street at}} his residence. [...] Simonsen told the warden there was a {{disturbance}} inside the prison and that someone had been knifed. [...] Under duress from Myles and Smart, the officer told the warden little else, and Powell rushed through Tower 7 along with two guards to see what the [...] "disturbance" [...] was. [...] As soon as he entered Inside Administration, he was yanked through the doorway. [...] His escort realized something was wrong and retreated, escaping back through Tower 7. [...] The guards on top of this tower <b>knew</b> <b>something</b> <b>was</b> wrong and had tried to warn the warden, but the blustery spring wind had obliterated their words.|$|E

2500|$|Several of Desmond's lines, such as, [...] "All right Mr. DeMille, I'm {{ready for}} my close-up," [...] and [...] "I am big, it's the {{pictures}} that got small!" [...] are often quoted. Much of the film's wit is delivered through Norma Desmond's deadpan comments, which are often followed by sarcastic retorts from Gillis. Desmond appears to not hear some of these comments, as she is absorbed by her own thoughts and in denial, and so some of Gillis's lines are heard only by the audience, with Wilder blurring {{the line between the}} events and Gillis's narration. Gillis's response to Desmond's cry that [...] "the pictures got small" [...] is a muttered reply, [...] "I <b>knew</b> <b>something</b> <b>was</b> wrong with them". Wilder often varies the structure, with Desmond taking Gillis's comments seriously and replying in kind. For example, when the two discuss the overwrought script Desmond has been working on, Gillis observes, [...] "They'll love it in Pomona." [...] "They'll love it everyplace," [...] replies Desmond firmly.|$|E
2500|$|Shortly before halftime of the Saturday evening {{game between}} the Oklahoma Sooners and the Kansas State Wildcats, spectators inside the stadium heard an {{explosion}}. The explosion was reported as being heard up to five miles away, but people {{on the east side}} of the stadium heard only a rumble like a low-volume thunder, of the type that signals impending rain. A few heard nothing. [...] Spectators were not allowed to leave the stadium at half-time, which caused concern among fans who did hear the explosion. No stadium announcements were made until the third and fourth quarters of play, when bus drivers were asked to leave the stadium and meet at the northwest corner of the Asp Avenue Parking Facility. [...] During the last six minutes of the game, an announcement was made over the public address system in the stadium and over local radio to exit through the south and east gates and to avoid the area, known to students and fans as the South Oval, west of the stadium. [...] No further explanations were given to game attendees because university officials [...] "didn't want to start any kind of panic." [...] "Everyone in my [...] section heard it. We looked to the opposite side of the field though thinking it was thunder. Me and my family were gonna go to the university bookstore after the game but the direction we had to go was blocked by caution tape. We <b>knew</b> <b>something</b> <b>was</b> up and got out of there ASAP." [...] said a Sooner fan.|$|E
