50|$|Serious {{systemic}} illness {{caused by}} Campylobacter infection rarely occurs, but {{can lead to}} sepsis and death. The case-fatality rate for Campylobacter infection is 0.05 per 1000 infections. For instance, one major possible complication that C. jejuni can cause is Guillain-Barré syndrome, which induces neuromuscular paralysis in a sizeable percentage of those who suffer from it. Over time, the paralysis is typically reversible to some extent; nonetheless, about 20% of patients with GBS are left disabled, and around 5% die. Another chronic condition that {{may be associated with}} Campylobacter infection is what was formerly known as Reiter's syndrome, a form of reactive arthritis. Reactive arthritis is a complication strongly associated with a particular genetic make-up. That is, persons who have the <b>human</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>antigen</b> B27 (HLA-B27) are most susceptible.

BackgroundThe <b>human</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>antigen</b> (HLA) class II proteins (DR, DQ, and DP) and DM, a protein involved in loading antigenic peptide onto the class II molecules, have a coordinate regulation that facilitates antigen presentation to CD 4 + T cells. CIITA {{is a specific}} transcription factor responsible for the coordinate regulation of these genes. DR expression in the kidney was described to be constitutive on renal microvascular endothelium in the early 1980 s, but {{expression of}} other genes involved in class II antigen presentation (DQ, DP, DM, and CIITA) has not been characterized. MethodsExpression of the HLA class II proteins, DM, and CIITA in normal human kidney cortex was evaluated by immunofluorescence microscopy, Northern blots, and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). ResultsThe endothelium of glomerular and peritubular capillaries constitutively express DR, as indicated by colocalization of DR and CD 31 antibodies. However, the endothelium of larger renal blood vessels is devoid of class II proteins. Capillaries that express DR do not have detectable DQ, DP, or DM by immunofluorescence. Northern blots identified DR, DP, and DM mRNAs but not DQ mRNA. CIITA was amplified by RT-PCR {{at a level that}} could account for the class II expressed by the microvascular endothelium. ConclusionThe renal microvascular endothelium constitutively expresses DR without the other class II proteins or DM. This discoordinate expression of HLA class II genes is unusual and may contribute to the kidney's ability to control CD 4 + T-cell responses...|$|E

The anti-human lymphocyte antigen (HLA) antibody production, specificity, and immunoglobulin class were examined sequentially in 73 patients undergoing aortic valve replacement. In addition, the long-term production of antibodies was examined in a cross-sectional study of 160 patients at periods varying from 1 to 15 years postoperatively. <b>Human</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>antigen</b> antibodies were produced in 17 of 30 antibioticsterilized homografts (56 %) and in 15 of 15 “homovital” homograft recipients, compared with 6 of the 28 control xenograft recipients (21 %) (p < 0. 001). The HLA antibodies were immunoglobulin G in all 15 homovital homografts, in 11 of 17 antibiotic-sterilized homografts, and {{in four of}} the six xenograft cases. <b>Human</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>antigen</b> specificities could be assigned to the antibodies in 21 cases. In 10 of 11 cases in which donor HLA typing data were available, the antibodies detected were directed against donor HLA class I antigens. Of six possible determinants of HLA antibody production, the type of homograft valve implanted (homovital or antibiotic sterilized) correlated with antibody formation. In the crosssectional study, 66 of the 85 homovital homograft recipients tested for HLA antibodies after 1 year were found to have antibodies, compared with 29 of 75 antibioticsterilized homograft recipients (p = 0. 00003).

Results: Significant statistical differences were observed in the CD 8 /HML- 1 expression when conjunctival epithelial cells were co-cultured with non-activated and activated lymphocytes (p = 0. 04 for each) and when corneal epithelial cells were co-cultured with non-activated lymphocytes (p = 0. 03).

40|$|Many {{significant}} {{advances have}} been made in assisted reproductive technology since the birth of the first baby conceived with in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer. The development of recombinant gonadotropins and gonadotropin releasing hormone antagonists helps to simplify the ovarian stimulation. Excessive ovarian stimulation should be avoided because of the risks of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome and reduction in endometrial receptivity. Maturation of oocytes in vitro has been developed in some centers. It is still uncertain whether techniques such as assisted hatching, blastocyst transfer and pre-implantation aneuploidy screening can improve the live birth rates in assisted reproduction. The introduction of pre-implantation genetic diagnosis for selection of <b>human</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>antigens</b> (HLA) compatible embryos for treatment of siblings has raised ethical concerns. There is a higher risk of obstetric complications and congenital abnormalities even in singleton pregnancies achieved with assisted reproduction. Because of the risks of multiple pregnancies, elective single embryo transfer is increasingly used in good-prognosis patients. With a good freezing program, the cumulative pregnancy rate (including the pregnancies from subsequent replacement of frozen-thawed embryos) is not adversely affected. Improvement in cryopreservation techniques has made it possible to cryopreserve slices of ovarian tissue or oocytes, thus helping women who have to receive sterilizing forms of anti-cancer treatment to preserve their fertility. It is important that the development of the new techniques should be based on good scientific evidence.

Certain cryptic epitopes are consequently produced by antigen-presenting cells, and are effectively presented according to the available HLA molecules, with subsequent HLA-restricted autoantibody production. Thus, while not directly involved in disease pathogenesis, SSc-associated autoantibodies appear to be reliable reporters of disease-specific pathologic phenomena, and may prove valuable pointers toward the etiopathogenesis of the different subtypes of SSc...|$|E
40|$|SYNOPSIS. Malaria {{has been}} invoked, {{perhaps more than}} any other {{infectious}} disease, as a force for the selection of human genetic polymorphisms. Evidence for genome-shaping interactions can be found in the geographic and ethnic distributions of the hemoglobins, blood group antigens, thalassemias, red cell mem-brane molecules, <b>human</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>antigen</b> (HLA) classes, and cytokines. Human immune responses and genetic variations can correspondingly influence the structure and polymorphisms of Plasmodium popula-tions, notably in genes that affect the success and virulence of infection. In Africa, where the burden from Plasmodium falciparum predominates, disease severity and manifestations vary in prevalence among human populations. The evolutionary history and spread of Plasmodium species inform our assessment of malaria as a selective force. Longstanding host-pathogen relationships, as well as recent changes in this dynamic, illustrate the selective pressures human and Plasmodium species place on one another. Investigations of malaria protection determinants and virulence factors that contribute to the complexity of the disease should advance our understanding of malaria pathogenesis...|$|E
40|$|A novel {{approach}} to DNA probe hybridization and heteroduplex analysis, termed directed heteroduplex analysis (DHDA) is presented here to illustrate its utility in simplification of <b>human</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>antigen</b> (HLA) - typing. By strategic labeling of single-stranded probe sequences, DHDA allows {{the identification of}} specific heteroduplex structures {{that contribute to the}} differentiation of DQAI and DQB 1 alleles. Because of the high degree of polymorphism among major histocompatibility complex class 11 second exon sequences, this analysis of 50 different heteroduplex molecules provides evidence of the importance of unpaired bases and mismatched base pairs and their effect on heteroduplex electrophoretic-mobility differences. This strategy is further used to genotype accurately a family for DQAI which was previously analyzed by sequence specific oligonucleotide (SSO) probe hybridization. To differentiate by SSO-typing among the DQA 1 and DQB 1 alleles analyzed in this study requires the use of 23 different probes. Equivalent results are obtained by DHDA using only three probes. Therefore, this study suggests that accurate HLA-typing can be simplified by DHDA. Additionally, DHDA may be useful for differentiation of DNA sequence polymorphisms in other genetic systems...|$|E
