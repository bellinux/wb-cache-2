50|$|Typically {{these are}} caused by poor design. Where there is mixed signal {{technology}} on a printed circuit board, e.g. analogue, digital and possibly RF, it is usually necessary for a highly skilled engineer to specify the layout of where the grounds are to be interconnected. Typically the digital section will have its own ground plane to obtain the necessary low inductance grounding and avoid ground bounce which can cause severe digital malfunction. But <b>digital</b> <b>ground</b> current must not pass through the analog grounding system, where voltage drop due to the finite ground impedance would cause noise to be injected into the analogue circuits. Phase lock loop circuits are particularly vulnerable because the VCO loop filter circuit is working with sub-microvolt signals when the loop is locked, and any disturbance will cause frequency jitter and possible loss of lock.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- Grounding {{forms an}} inseparable {{part of all}} {{electronic}} and electrical designs, from circuit through system up to installation design. All the ground pins of the system should be tied to the analog ground plane, separated from the system’s <b>digital</b> logic <b>ground,</b> to achieve optimum performance in a mixed mode circuit. The ESD indirect discharge test is carried out to predict the effect of ESD on data in a mixed mode circuit when the analog and <b>digital</b> <b>grounds</b> are common and separate. The Indirect discharge is done for different voltages and distances. The susceptibility of a circuit to ESD can be greatly reduced by properly grounding it which is observed in the mixed mode circuit. In the mixed mode circuit the data is affected more by the ESD transients based on the discharge voltage given when the analog and <b>digital</b> <b>grounds</b> are common than {{when compared with the}} grounds being separate...|$|R

Research efforts to date are scarce on automated extraction of qualitative information based on photographs and therefore this study contributes in this respect, i. e. the automated quantification of landscape scenic quality. Based on the texture indices that {{are commonly used}} in landscape ecology, nine quantitative indices are selected to describe the fragmentation {{and complexity of the}} landscape, and the results from the application of these indices to a sample of ground photographs are described in this paper. Furthermore, we investigate the effectiveness of the indices selected with respect to the classification of the landscape's scenic quality, while the results are compared to the results derived from a research programme of the National Technical University of Athens. Also, as research experience has shown that texture indices are affected by data resolution, this paper investigates the influence of this factor in the calculation of the quantitative indices that are applied in <b>digital</b> <b>ground</b> photographs.
