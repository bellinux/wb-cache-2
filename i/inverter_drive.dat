40|$|Air {{conditioning}} installations {{are typically}} designed with enough cooling capacity {{to satisfy the}} desired minimum temperature under the heaviest load. Since heat loads {{tend to be less}} than the maximum designed loads, the system will most often be working under part-load rather than full-load conditions. Operating at these part-load conditions at fixed capacity will be more expensive than if the capacity were able to match the required load. Varying capacity air conditioning systems, which make use of inverter technology, have been developed in order to track the required cooling load more closely. These high quality air conditioners are advertised as consuming around 30 per cent less energy than conventional systems. This experimental investigation looked into the steady state performance and start-up power requirements of an <b>inverter</b> <b>driven</b> refrigeration unit versus fixed speed operation.

40|$|Abstract. This article {{represents}} {{research on}} fault diagnosis of <b>inverter</b> electric <b>drives.</b> It puts {{more emphasis on}} power electronics and drives. The paper begins with the diagnostics of systems with conventional <b>inverter</b> <b>drives,</b> because knowledge of the fault diagnosis in conventional inverter {{can be used for}} its applications in other topologies of <b>inverter</b> <b>drives.</b> Therefore, the article describes several methods for troubleshooting. A conventional inverter driver (CID) system usually consists of three cascaded subsystems: a rectifier, an inverter, and a motor. A review of fault detection techniques in an inverter is focused in this section. As it was previously mentioned [1], input motor supply current can be used to detect discontinuity in transistor basic circuit or converter switch short. As a rule two techniques are applied in fault detection and diagnosis: model based on engineering philosophy and mathematic computer software model. A model based on engineering philosophy (a physical one) directly depends upon a mathematical model; for instance, analytical back-up/redundancy method and parameter estimation method. A model based technique is valuable if an accurate model of faults can be obtained. However, in th...|$|R
