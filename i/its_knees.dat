5|$|The Flavians, {{although}} a relatively short-lived dynasty, helped restore stability to an empire on <b>its</b> <b>knees.</b> Although all three have been criticised, especially {{based on their}} more centralised style of rule, they issued reforms that created a stable enough empire to last well into the 3rd century. However, their background as a military dynasty led to further marginalisation of the senate, and a conclusive move away from princeps, or first citizen, and toward imperator, or emperor.|$|E
5|$|There {{were many}} notable {{innovations}} during the Tang, including {{the development of}} woodblock printing. Buddhism became a major influence in Chinese culture, with native Chinese sects gaining prominence. However, Buddhism would later be persecuted by the state, subsequently declining in influence. Although the dynasty and central government were in decline by the 9th century, art and culture continued to flourish. The weakened central government largely withdrew from managing the economy, though the country's mercantile affairs stayed intact and commercial trade continued to thrive regardless, at least until agrarian rebellions {{in the latter half}} of the 9th century brought the dynasty to <b>its</b> <b>knees,</b> resulting in damaging atrocities such as the Guangzhou Massacre.|$|E
5|$|The basic garment for all Romans, {{regardless}} of gender or wealth, was the simple sleeved tunic. The length differed by wearer: a man's reached mid-calf, but a soldier's was somewhat shorter; a woman's {{fell to her}} feet, and a child's to <b>its</b> <b>knees.</b> The tunics of poor people and labouring slaves were made from coarse wool in natural, dull shades, with the length determined {{by the type of}} work they did. Finer tunics were made of lightweight wool or linen. A man who belonged to the senatorial or equestrian order wore a tunic with two purple stripes (clavi) woven vertically into the fabric: the wider the stripe, the higher the wearer's status. Other garments could be layered over the tunic.|$|E

5|$|In 692/693, the Byzantine emperor Justinian II (reigned 685–695 and 705–711) and the Umayyad Caliph Abd al-Malik (r. 685–705) {{broke the}} truce that had existed between Byzantium and the Umayyad Caliphate since 679, {{following}} the failed Muslim {{attack on the}} Byzantine capital, Constantinople. The Byzantines secured great financial and territorial advantages from the truce, which they extended further by exploiting the Umayyad government's involvement in the Second Muslim Civil War (680–692). However, by 692 the Umayyads were clearly emerging as the victors in the conflict, and Abd al-Malik consciously {{began a series of}} provocations to bring about a resumption of warfare. Justinian, confident in his own strength based on his previous successes, responded in kind. Finally, the Umayyads claimed that the Byzantines had broken the treaty and invaded Byzantine territory, defeating the imperial army at the Battle of Sebastopolis in 693. In its aftermath, the Arabs quickly regained control over Armenia and resumed their attacks into the border zone of eastern Asia Minor, that would culminate in the second attempt to conquer Constantinople in 716–718. Furthermore, Justinian was deposed in 695, beginning a twenty-year period of internal instability that almost brought the Byzantine state to <b>its</b> <b>knees.</b>|$|E
25|$|The feet of H.nbsp&floresiensis were unusually {{flat and}} unusually long in {{relation}} {{with the rest of}} the body. As a result, when walking, it would have had to bend <b>its</b> <b>knees</b> further back than modern people do. This forced the gait to be high stepped and walking speed to be low. The toes had an unusual shape and the big toe was very short.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} fully achieve {{the aim of}} a {{national}} scheme the Commonwealth and states entered a cross-vesting of jurisdiction agreement in which the Federal Court was vested with state jurisdiction to hear company law matters. Although this system functioned effectively for several years it was eventually brought to <b>its</b> <b>knees</b> by the High Court in Re Wakim; Ex parte McNally, Bond v The Queen, and R v Hughes, (2000) 171 ALR 155. These decisions precipitated further reform of the national corporation law scheme in 2001.|$|E

This child's terrying features included a horn on its forehead, wings, an eye on <b>its</b> <b>knee,</b> and a clawed foot, according to Florentine chronicler Luca Landucci. Its appearance was evidently a cause for alarm, and news spread across Europe in the diaries of contemporary writers.|$|R

25|$|The {{series of}} raids {{launched}} by the Chola Empire in the 11th century had weakened the once glorious empire of Srivijaya. By {{the end of the}} 13th century, the already fragmented Srivijaya caught the attention of the expansionist Javanese King, Kertanegara of Singhasari. In 1275, he decreed the Pamalayu expedition to overrun Sumatra. By 1288, Singhasari naval expeditionary forces successfully sacked Jambi and Palembang and brought Malayu Dharmasraya—the successor state of Srivijaya, to <b>its</b> <b>knees.</b> In 1293 Singhasari was successed by Majapahit ruling the region.|$|E
25|$|The painter Edwin Henry Landseer {{submitted}} a picture called 'The Shrew Tamed' for the Royal Academy exhibition of 1861. It showed {{a beautiful girl}} in riding habit reclining against the neck of a horse which is on <b>its</b> <b>knees</b> among the straw. It was ostensibly not a portrait of Walters, but the alleged model, the noted horsewoman Annie Gilbert, resembles her, and the juxtaposition of horse, beautiful woman and prevailing mood of languor troubled contemporary critics; some clearly assumed Walters herself had been the subject. The picture gained the alternative title of 'The Pretty Horsebreaker'.|$|E
25|$|Needless to say, Hsinbyushin of Burma never {{abandoned}} {{his plan to}} force Siam to <b>its</b> <b>knees,</b> {{and as soon as}} he had been informed of the foundation of Thonburi as King Taksin's capital, he commanded the Governor of Tavoy to subjugate him in 1767. The Burmese army advanced to the district of Bangkung in the province of Samut Songkram to the west of the new capital, but was routed by the Thai king himself. However, when the Chinese troops invaded, Hsinbyushin decided to call most of his troops back to resist the Chinese.|$|E
5000|$|A curtsey (also spelled curtsy or even {{incorrectly}} courtsey) is {{a traditional}} gesture of greeting, in which a girl or woman bends her knees while bowing her head. It is the female equivalent of male bowing in Western cultures. Miss Manners characterizes <b>its</b> <b>knee</b> bend as deriving from a [...] "traditional gesture of an inferior to a superior."

25|$|John's successor, whom he {{apparently}} despised, was Henry of Stoke. He {{took steps to}} improve the abbey's finances. In particular, he retained the services of William of Shareshill, a talented lawyer, to maximise the abbey's income from its endowments. Shareshill was very successful and received the lease of Boningale as a reward. However, cattle disease in the 1330s and the first outbreak of the Black Death in 1348 struck hard. The labour shortage brought the community to <b>its</b> <b>knees.</b> Abbot Henry resigned in 1350 and in 1351 Edward III appointed Shareshill and William Banaster as custodians to restore solvency.|$|E
25|$|The Cup Winners' Cup triumph {{proved to}} be the last of Chelsea's successes in the decade, as a series of {{problems}} combined to almost bring the club to <b>its</b> <b>knees.</b> From the early 1970s, the discipline of the team began to degenerate, as Sexton fell out with several key players, most notably Osgood, Hudson and Baldwin over their attitude and lifestyle. As the spirit of the team declined, so too did results. Chelsea set two records in defence of the Cup Winners' Cup in 1971–72: a 21–0 aggregate win over Luxembourg side Jeunesse Hautcharage, which remains a record scoreline in European competition. The result included a 13–0 home win over Jeunesse, the biggest winning scoreline in Chelsea's history. However, the team were knocked out of the competition by little-known Åtvidabergs FF under the away goals rule in the next round.|$|E
25|$|In a December 2015 {{interview}} with BBC Radio 4's Today programme Ahern said low pay workers had brought country to <b>its</b> <b>knees</b> {{because they got}} “cocky” and insisted on “second, third and even fourth homes”. The former Taoiseach said that the availability of cheap credit through Ireland's involvement in the eurozone created “a huge problem”. “Anyone could walk into any institution and seem to get any amount of money {{and this is where}} the cocky bit came in. “Unfortunately… Joe Soap and Mary Soap, who never had a lot, got the loans for the second house and leveraged the third house off the second house and the fourth on the third, and you know, what are you having yourself.” People, among them those who had previously regarded the former Taoiseach highly, took to social media and the airwaves to criticise Ahern for his remarks.|$|E

25|$|The {{decline in}} per capita income growth {{at the end of}} the 18th century may appear as a counterargument against the modernity of the Dutch economy. However, at closer {{inspection}} this was actually a modern process of restructuring in the face of adverse circumstances, as may be seen in current modern economies, like the United States and European countries, that also undergo major structural upheavals. The 18th-century deindustrialization was in large part a consequence of a too-high real wage level, combined with protectionist policies of foreign governments, closing access to major markets. The agricultural depression was a general European phenomenon. The crisis in foreign trade was answered, and partly parried, with commercial innovations. The financial and fiscal crisis that proved the Republic's undoing was altogether modern in nature (unlike the comparable crises that regularly brought the Spanish Crown to <b>its</b> <b>knees),</b> but simply happened before the modern means of dealing with it (expansion of the tax base and/or monetary inflation) were at hand.|$|E
25|$|Basically {{the same}} Coalition, again {{led by the}} Republic and what now became Great Britain, soon fought France again in the War of the Spanish Succession, in which the States Army reached its {{greatest}} power and size: 119,000 men in 1712. It therefore formed {{the backbone of the}} Anglo-Dutch forces in the Southern Netherlands, led by the Duke of Marlborough (while the Republic also paid for many of the troops supplied by the allied German princes and Denmark, by way of subsidies); the British contribution was usually smaller in size at most of the battles fought during this conflict. The effort required from the Republic in this war almost brought it to financial exhaustion, just as France was financially brought to <b>its</b> <b>knees.</b> This, {{and the fact that the}} fruits of the allied victory over France were almost exclusively reaped by Great Britain (that had turned its back on its allies and concluded a separate peace) so disillusioned the Dutch government, that they decided to turn their back on European power politics for the remainder of the 18th century, adopting a policy of armed neutrality.|$|E
25|$|The Prussian army of 200,000 men now besieged {{the city}} of Metz, where 3 French marshals, 50 generals, 135,000 men, and 600 guns were encircled. Bazaine {{attempted}} to break the siege at Noisseville on 31 August but the French were repulsed, losing 3,500 men in the attempt. There were supplies in Metz to last {{no more than a}} month, such that by early September the order was given for work horses to be slaughtered for food. By mid September, cavalry horses also began to be slaughtered. Without cavalry and horses to pull the guns, Bazaine's ability to mount effective attempts to break out rapidly diminished. On 7 October, hungry and immobilised, Bazaine dispatched two 40,000 man foraging parties along both banks of the Moselle, but the Prussian guns blew the French wagons off the road and the Prussian infantry cut swathes through the desperate French soldiers with Chassepots captured at Sedan. Over 2,000 men were lost in this operation. Typhus and smallpox was spreading and by 10 October, it is estimated that 19,000 of the French troops in Metz were hospitalised. A further attempt was made to break the siege on 18 October at Bellevue, but again the French troops were repulsed, with the loss of 1,250 men. The city was on <b>its</b> <b>knees,</b> the troops and inhabitants on the point of starvation.|$|E

40|$|A biped robot with {{heterogeneous}} legs (BRHL) {{is proposed}} {{to provide an}} ideal test-bed for intelligent bionic legs (IBL). To make artificial leg gait better suited to a human, a four-bar mechanism is used as <b>its</b> <b>knee</b> joint, and a pneumatic artificial muscle (PAM) is used as its driving source. The static mathematical model of PAM is established and the mechanical model of a single degree of freedom of a knee joint driven by PAM is analyzed. A control simulation of an artificial leg based on PID control algorithm is carried out and the simulation {{results indicate that the}} artificial leg can simulate precisely a normal human walking gait...|$|R
40|$|The {{object of}} this Thesis was to {{construct}} a simple walking bipedal model in a computer simulation, similar to a human being.

500|$|A giraffe rests by lying {{with its}} body {{on top of}} its folded legs. To lie down, the animal kneels on its front legs and then lowers {{the rest of its}} body. To get back up, it first gets on <b>its</b> <b>knees</b> and spreads its hind legs to raise its hindquarters. It then {{straightens}} its front legs. With each step, the animal swings its head. In captivity, the giraffe sleeps intermittently around 4.6 hours per day, mostly at night. It usually sleeps lying down, however, standing sleeps have been recorded, particularly in older individuals. Intermittent short [...] "deep sleep" [...] phases while lying are characterised by the giraffe bending its neck backwards and resting its head on the hip or thigh, a position believed to indicate paradoxical sleep. If the giraffe wants to bend down to drink, it either spreads its front legs or bends <b>its</b> <b>knees.</b> Giraffes would probably not be competent swimmers as their long legs would be highly cumbersome in the water, although they could possibly float. When swimming, the thorax would be weighed down by the front legs, making it difficult for the animal to move its neck and legs in harmony or keep its head above the surface.|$|E
