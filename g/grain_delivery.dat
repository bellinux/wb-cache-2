25|$|The rural towns {{have evolved}} from {{a very large number}} of widely {{dispersed}} <b>grain</b> <b>delivery</b> points in 1900, through a period of expansion over the first thirty years of the 20th century, to a pattern of relatively concentrated population and businesses in an urban-based economy by 2000. Mechanization, especially the rapid replacement of horses by tractors after 1945, meant one family could operate a much larger farm, so some farmers bought out their neighbors, who then moved to town along with the surplus children. The rural economy diversified far beyond its exclusively agricultural base, with service employment in education and medicine important, as well as small-scale factories. Better highways, along with cell phones and internet coverage encouraged a concentration in fewer, larger centers, which drew customers and clients from a wide radius. Most rural communities declined continuously over the second half of the 20th century, but some grew in population, expanded their economic base, and experienced an increase in their market areas for a limited range of goods and services. These communities also became centers of employment for their own and surrounding (farm and nonfarm) population.|$|E

40|$|Four {{groups of}} pigeons were trained with a {{standard}} autoshaping procedure in which a brief fixed-duration interval always followed by a <b>grain</b> <b>delivery</b> alternated with a longer variable-duration interval never associated with <b>grain</b> <b>delivery.</b> One of two stimuli was always presented during each interval. One of them contained three black dots and a black star on a green background; the other contained four black dots on a green background.

Which of the two stimuli preceded <b>grain</b> <b>delivery</b> was counterbalanced within each pair of groups. The speed of occurrence of the first autoshaped peck was not affected by whether the stimulus containing the distinctive star element preceded <b>grain</b> <b>delivery,</b> but autoshaping was faster when the stimulus arrays were compact than when they were dispersed. During 560 response-independent training trials that followed the first autoshaped peck, this pattern reversed; both discriminative control over responding and the relative frequency of pecking the stimulus that preceded <b>grain</b> <b>delivery</b> were greater {{for the two groups}} where this stimulus contained the discriminative element than for the two groups where it contained only common elements.

In the first experiment, autoshaped pecking of the stimulus preceding <b>grain</b> <b>delivery</b> began much sooner when that stimulus was a black vertical line on a white background and the other stimulus was green than when the opposite stimulus arrangement was used. Because these two stimuli differed in form, hue, brightness, and similarity in hue and brightness to the illumination of the raised feeder, three subsequent experiments examined whether the differential speed of autoshaping in the two groups was due to a feature-positive, feature-negative effect, a preference for brighter over darker stimuli, a simple preference for white over green, or stimulus generalization from the brightness or hue of the illuminated, raised feeder to the stimulus on the key preceding <b>grain</b> <b>delivery.</b> The data from these experiments showed that the first autoshaped key peck was most likely to be made to the stimulus of the same hue as that illuminating the feeder, regardless of whether that stimulus was positively or negatively associated with <b>grain</b> <b>delivery.</b> At least under some conditions, therefore, stimulus-generalization mediated response transfer of pecking grain in the presence of the hue illuminating the feeder to pecking the key illuminated by a similar hue appears to account for the occurrence of autoshaped key pecking...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a simple model of an Ethiopian farn household which captures three {{important aspects of}} the policy regime characterising the Derg period. These aspects are compulsory <b>grain</b> <b>delivery,</b> rationing in manufactured consumer goods, and rationing in modern farn inputs. The model involves two main innovations with the agricultural household modelling framework. First, a new procedure of analysing the impact of the policy of forced grain procurement is introduced. The procedure enables us to directly characterize the effects of that policy on farm households’ welfare, as well as the production and consumption choices they make. Second, it pulls together various strands of te relevant literature in a simple manner. In particular, it provides a more direct way of determining the welfare effects of rationing, compulsory <b>grain</b> <b>delivery,</b> prices and incomes. Both individual and joint effects can be handled this way. The comparative static properties of the model directly show that forced grain procurement by the state reduces the welfare of farm households and distorts their production choices. The results also indicate that shortages (rationing) in manufactures consumer goods and modern inputs make commodity demands, input demands, and output supplies less price responsive. ...|$|E

When the schedule on the center key was variable-interval reinforcement, the color was green (positive discriminative stimulus); when no reinforcements were scheduled, the color was red (negative discriminative stimulus). Since pecking the side keys did not affect <b>grain</b> <b>deliveries,</b> changes in the rate of pecking could not be ascribed to changes in the frequency of primary reinforcement.
