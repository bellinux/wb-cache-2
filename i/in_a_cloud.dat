After his retirement from cricket, Collins used his gambling knowledge to start a career in horse racing, working as a bookmaker and commission agent.|$|E
5|$|As these larger water {{droplets}} descend, coalescence continues, so that drops become heavy enough to overcome air resistance and fall as rain. Coalescence generally happens {{most often in}} clouds above freezing, and {{is also known as}} the warm rain process. In clouds below freezing, when ice crystals gain enough mass they begin to fall. This generally requires more mass than coalescence when occurring between the crystal and neighboring {{water droplets}}. This process is temperature dependent, as supercooled water droplets only exist <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>cloud</b> that is below freezing. In addition, because of the great temperature difference between cloud and ground level, these ice crystals may melt as they fall and become rain.|$|E
5|$|Data {{from the}} ZDR was {{passed to the}} All-Target Processor (ATP), which ran initial {{processing}} on as many as 625 objects <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>cloud.</b> As many as 50 of these could be picked out for further processing in the Discrimination and Control Computer (DCC), which ran more tests on those tracks and assigned each one a probability of being the warhead or decoy. The DCC was able to run 100 different tests. For exoatmospheric signals the tests included measure of radar return pulse-to-pulse to look for tumbling objects, as well as variations in signals strength due to changes in frequency. Within the atmosphere, the primary method was examining the velocities of the objects to determine their mass.|$|E

5|$|In 1914, at the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Muller's career took a new turn. The Dutch government appointed him government commissioner in charge {{of one of the}} main Belgian Refugee Camps in the Netherlands. Muller was charged with the transfer of the camp from a makeshift army encampment in Oldebroek to a proper refugee camp with full provisions in Nunspeet. He took to the job with great enthusiasm, but resigned a year later, declaring that he had attained the goals he had set himself on his appointment. Actually the resignation came <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>cloud</b> of controversy around his person and policies. At the end of World War I the Dutch prime minister did acknowledge the high quality of Muller's work in setting up the camps and bringing and maintaining order and human dignity under very trying circumstances. Apart from his position as member of the Consular Examinations Commission, this position was the only Dutch government appointment Muller held inside the Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|Murtagh becomes Eragon's new {{companion}} and {{they travel to}} the city Gil'ead to find {{information on how to}} find the Varden, a group of rebels who want to see the downfall of Galbatorix. While stopping near Gil'ead, Eragon is captured and imprisoned in the same jail that holds a woman he has been having dreams about. As she is being dragged past she is revealed as an elf when her pointed ears are uncovered. Murtagh and Saphira stage a rescue, and Eragon escapes with the unconscious elf. During the escape, Eragon and Murtagh battle with Durza. Murtagh shoots Durza between the eyes with an arrow, and the Shade disappears <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>cloud</b> of mist. Having escaped, they run off. Eragon succeeds in communicating with the elf, whose name is revealed as Arya, and learns the location of the Varden. After some arguing, Murtagh decides to still travel with Eragon to the Varden but is still wary of them.|$|E
5|$|The Luftwaffe {{scored a}} notable {{success on the}} night of 2 December 1943 when 105 Ju 88 bombers struck the port of Bari. Skilfully using chaff to confuse the Allied radar operators, they found the port packed with brightly lit Allied shipping. The result was the most {{destructive}} air raid on Allied shipping since the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941. Hits were scored on two ammunition ships and a tanker. Burning oil and exploding ammunition spread over the harbour. Some 16 ships were sunk and eight damaged, and the port was put out of action for three weeks. Moreover, one of the ships sunk, SS John Harvey, had been carrying mustard gas, which enveloped the port <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>cloud</b> of poisonous vapours.|$|E

At the hospital, the doctors are shocked when Isabel levitates off her bed and explodes <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>cloud</b> of dust. Elsewhere, the devastated Kapp is left alone in the ruins of his cottage and observatory. More and more young people are joining the Planet People, {{including}} the gangs that have been terrorising the cities and the soldiers assigned to keep them away from the Megalithic sites. Contact is restored with Chuck Marshall and with the Russians in the form of Gurov (Brewster Mason). Quatermass theorises {{that this is not the}} first time this has happened; megalithic sites such as prehistoric stone circles are in fact markers where beacons have been left by the alien force for its next visit. Quatermass believes the force is a sphere of energy surrounding the Earth. The Russians and the Americans send a space shuttle, commanded by Marshall, to make contact with the force. Quatermass is sceptical; he believes they are dealing not with an intelligence but with a machine constructed to harvest human protein. The space shuttle is destroyed but not before Marshall reports a giant beam of light stretching in all directions. Meanwhile, the Planet People are gathering at Wembley Stadium in the tens of thousands. Annie and Quatermass travel to the stadium but are powerless to prevent the Planet People from gathering. When they are attacked, Annie drives their car into the underground car park beneath the stadium where she crashes the vehicle and is killed. The lightning strikes the stadium.|$|E

40|$|With cloud {{computing}}, the long-envisioned {{dream of}} computing as utility is achieved. Many {{of the current}} standalone cloud providers offer resources and services using pay-per-use fixed pricing. Spot pricing, recently introduced in Amazon EC 2, is more efficient by setting the resource price dynamically, based on demand. However, this pricing scheme, similar to the uniform price auction, is truthful only when supply can be adjusted, such as the case of <b>a</b> standalone <b>cloud</b> provider. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> federated <b>cloud,</b> where resources from multiple cloud providers are integrated to increase elasticity and reliability, rational users can have <b>a</b> greater impact. <b>In</b> this paper, we evaluate the impact of rationality <b>in</b> <b>a</b> federated <b>cloud,</b> by comparing the consumer welfare achieved by spot pricing, currently used in Amazon EC 2, and a strategy-proof pricing scheme. We consider different EC 2 regions as providers <b>in</b> <b>a</b> federated <b>cloud,</b> and use traces of spot prices to determine the consumer requests and the user welfare.
