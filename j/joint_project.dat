5|$|Blackburn {{first became}} {{interested}} in the possibility of an eruption at Mount St. Helens in March 1980, when a series of earthquakes rocked the volcano. Having already climbed the mountain, he was intrigued by the situation and was eventually assigned to document the activity of the volcano for his outdoor skills and his meticulousness. By May, he had begun camping out at the volcano as a <b>joint</b> <b>project</b> to take pictures of the volcanic phenomena for The Columbian, National Geographic, and the United States Geological Survey.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, {{following}} a suggestion to Eastbourne Borough Council by Eastbourne Civic Society (now Eastbourne Society), a <b>joint</b> <b>project</b> {{was set up}} to erect blue plaques on buildings associated with famous people. The principles for selection are broadly those already established by English Heritage for such plaques in London. The first was erected in November 1994 in Milnthorpe Road at the former home of Sir Ernest Shackleton, the Antarctic explorer.|$|E

5|$|M-73 was {{designated}} by July 1, 1919, {{along with the}} rest of the initial state trunkline highway system. In 1937, the highway was completely hard-surfaced for the first time. Its routing has been largely unchanged since designation. The original bridge over the Brule River was built in 1922. In a <b>joint</b> <b>project</b> with the Wisconsin Department of Transportation (WisDOT), MDOT funded a replacement in 2003. WisDOT supervised construction of the new span in a project that ran between July 14 and November 4, 2003.|$|E
5|$|The Cassini–Huygens {{spacecraft}} reached Saturn on July 1, 2004, {{and began}} the process of mapping Titan's surface by radar. A <b>joint</b> <b>project</b> of the European Space Agency (ESA) and NASA, Cassini–Huygens proved a very successful mission. The Cassini probe flew by Titan on October 26, 2004, and took the highest-resolution images ever of Titan's surface, at only , discerning patches {{of light and dark}} that would be invisible to the human eye.|$|E
5|$|The town {{is served}} by Keynsham railway station on the London-Bristol and Bristol-Southampton trunk routes. It opened in 1840 and was renamed Keynsham and Somerdale in 1925. The {{chocolate}} factory had its own rail system which {{was connected to the}} main line, but the connection was taken out of use 26–27 July 1980. The station's name reverted to Keynsham on 6 May 1974. The station was rebuilt in 1985 as a <b>joint</b> <b>project</b> between British Rail and Avon County Council.|$|E

A <b>joint</b> <b>project</b> to widen the bridge sidewalks was carried out by Sacramento, West Sacramento, and Caltrans. The project was completed in May 2008.|$|E
5|$|Bartholdi was {{inspired}} by a French law professor and politician, Édouard René de Laboulaye, who is said to have commented in 1865 that any monument raised to U.S. independence would properly be a <b>joint</b> <b>project</b> of the French and American peoples. Because of the post-war instability in France, work on the statue did not commence until the early 1870s. In 1875, Laboulaye proposed that the French finance the statue and the U.S. provide the site and build the pedestal. Bartholdi completed the head and the torch-bearing arm before the statue was fully designed, and these pieces were exhibited for publicity at international expositions.|$|E
5|$|Owing to {{the danger}} from aerial bombardment, the Chadwicks sent their twins to Canada {{as part of a}} {{government}} evacuation scheme. Chadwick was reluctant to move Tube Alloys there, believing that the United Kingdom was a better location for the isotope separation plant. The enormous scope of the effort became more apparent in 1942: even a pilot separation plant would cost over ₤1 million and strain Britain's resources, to say nothing of a full-scale plant, which was estimated to cost somewhere in the vicinity of £25 million. It would have to be built in America. At {{the same time that the}} British became convinced that a <b>joint</b> <b>project</b> was necessary, the progress of the American Manhattan Project was such that British cooperation seemed less essential, although the Americans were still eager to utilise Chadwick's talents.|$|E

5|$|The {{matter of}} {{cooperation}} {{had to be}} taken up at the highest level. In September 1943, the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, and President Roosevelt negotiated the Quebec Agreement, which reinstated cooperation between Britain, the United States and Canada. Chadwick, Oliphant, Peierls and Simon were summoned to the United States by the director of Tube Alloys, Sir Wallace Akers, to work with the Manhattan Project. The Quebec Agreement established a new Combined Policy Committee to direct the <b>joint</b> <b>project.</b> The Americans disliked Akers, so Chadwick was appointed technical advisor to the Combined Policy Committee, {{and the head of the}} British Mission.|$|E
5|$|At {{the meeting}} with Roosevelt on October 9, 1941, Bush {{advocated}} cooperating with the United Kingdom, and he began corresponding with his British counterpart, Sir John Anderson. But by October 1942, Conant and Bush agreed that a <b>joint</b> <b>project</b> would pose security risks and be more complicated to manage. Roosevelt approved a Military Policy Committee recommendation stating that information given to the British {{should be limited to}} technologies that they were actively working on and should not extend to post-war developments. In July 1943, on a visit to London to learn about British progress on antisubmarine technology, Bush, Stimson and Bundy met with Anderson, Lord Cherwell and Winston Churchill at 10 Downing Street. At the meeting, Churchill forcefully pressed for a renewal of interchange, while Bush defended current policy. Only when he returned to Washington did he discover that Roosevelt had agreed with the British. The Quebec Agreement merged the two atomic bomb projects, creating the Combined Policy Committee with Stimson, Bush and Conant as United States representatives.|$|E
5|$|The 1969 Mansfield Amendment, {{which ended}} {{military}} funding of non-military research, {{the end of}} the Vietnam War, and {{the end of the}} Apollo program reduced ARC's funding from DARPA and NASA. SRI's management, which disapproved of Engelbart's approach to running the center, placed the remains of ARC under the control of artificial intelligence researcher Bertram Raphael, who negotiated the transfer of the laboratory to a company called Tymshare. Engelbart's house in Atherton, California burned down during this period, causing him and his family further problems. Tymshare took over NLS and the lab that Engelbart had founded, hired most of the lab's staff including its creator as a Senior Scientist, renamed the software Augment, and offered it as a commercial service via its new Office Automation Division. Tymshare was already somewhat familiar with NLS; when ARC was still operational, it had experimented with its own local copy of the NLS software on a minicomputer called OFFICE-1, as part of a <b>joint</b> <b>project</b> with ARC.|$|E

5|$|The Anglo-French {{adaption}} of The Bridge {{was announced}} as a <b>joint</b> <b>project</b> between Sky and Canal+ in January 2013. Ben Richards, the head writer of The Tunnel, worked with Hans Rosenfeldt, {{the creator of}} the original series. Due to the setting, the dialogue of the series is bilingual, a first for British and French television. With a budget of £15 million, filming took place between February and August 2013, and was shot on location in Kent, England and northern France. It was produced with both British and French crew members. The premieres on both Sky Atlantic and Canal+ received strong ratings for the respective channels, with an initial consolidated figure of almost 900,000 in the UK, and 1.3 million in France. Critical reception of the series has been generally positive, with Dillane and Poésy's acting being praised, as well as the plot's grittiness. The comparisons with The Bridge were also viewed favourably by some reviewers, though others criticised The Tunnel for being identical. The producers admit that the first episode is a copy of the original.|$|E
5|$|The United Kingdom and France are {{not part}} of the NATO E-3A Component, instead {{procuring}} E-3 aircraft through a <b>joint</b> <b>project.</b> The UK and France operate their E-3 aircraft independently of each other and of NATO. The UK operates six aircraft (with a seventh now retired) and France operates four aircraft, all fitted with the newer CFM56-2 engines. The British requirement came about following the cancellation of the British Aerospace Nimrod AEW3 project to replace the Avro Shackleton AEW2 during the 1980s. The UK E-3 order was placed in February 1987, with deliveries starting in 1990. The other operator of the type, delivered between June 1986 and September 1987, is Saudi Arabia which operates five aircraft, all fitted with CFM56-2 engines. This particular sale was hotly contested between the Reagan administration and opponents of the sale.|$|E
