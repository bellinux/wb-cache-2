25|$|Miners {{had long}} {{believed}} that they were treated poorly. For example, in 1894 a Leadville mine owner instructed the superintendent of the mine to delay a payday for the miners so that a dividend could be paid to stockholders. The WFM had advocated the eight-hour day since its founding convention in 1893. Some miners had the shorter hours, and public employees and building trades workers in Denver had won the eight-hour day as early as 1890. Yet in 1896, hoisting engineers in Leadville were required to work twelve-hour shifts. Mines were more dangerous as they were dug deeper; it was increasingly recognized that poor working conditions as well as longer hours could be correlated with poor health. In 1889 two Leadville workmen were sent to Denver to testify in favor of a mine inspection bill. Although it passed, <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>difference</b> that year because the legislature failed to fund it.|$|E

[...] Regardless they confirmed the Australians' reputation for audacity and courage, winning the only two Victoria Crosses of the land campaign. However, as the Australian government had refused flatly to supply forces for the intervention, their involvement was limited.

Ultimately <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>difference</b> to {{the outcome of the}} Russian Civil War either, perhaps other than to help confirm the Bolshevik's mistrust of the Western powers.

2500|$|Desgrange and his Tour invented bicycle stage racing. Desgrange {{experimented with}} {{different}} ways of judging the winner. Initially he used total accumulated time (as used in the modern Tour de France) [...] but from 1906 to 1912 by points for placings each day. Desgrange saw problems in judging both by time and by points. By time, a rider coping with a mechanical problem—which the rules insisted he repair alone—could lose so much time that it cost him the race. Equally, riders could finish so separated that time gained or lost {{on one or two}} days could decide the whole race. Judging the race by points removed over-influential time differences but discouraged competitors from riding hard. <b>It</b> <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>difference</b> whether they finished fast or slow or separated by seconds or hours, so they were inclined to ride together at a relaxed pace until close to the line, only then disputing the final placings that would give them points.|$|E

2500|$|Brown {{dispensed}} with the experiment of having Hutton bat down {{the order and}} the old Roses opening partnership of Len Hutton and Cyril Washbrook went to the crease. Hutton was full of confidence, 19 runs came off the first three overs and Keith Miller asked for a new ball in the fourth. Umpire Elphinstone examined the ball and changed it for a new one, which he ground into the dust to take the shine off. Hutton insisted on a look and bounced on the grass a few times {{so that it would}} lose its shape. <b>It</b> <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>difference</b> as another 8 runs came of the next two overs and Miller was taken off, only to take a diving catch off Ian Johnson (3/94) to dismiss Washbrook. Miller said this was the finest catch of his career; [...] "He played the perfect cut, but, fielding in the gully, I had anticipated the shot. I ran across before he played it, flung out my hand and held the ball. I was just as astonished as Cyril". Hutton (62) and Simpson (49) took the score to 128/1 when Miller was brought back on to bowl one of his most famous overs. He bowled a [...] "super ball" [...] to dismiss Hutton lbw and bowled Denis Compton for a duck when the ball clipped the edge of the bat and ricocheted into the stumps. Gilbert Parkhouse survived until tea, but Reg Simpson guided another ball from Miller to Sam Loxton at short-fine-leg and England were 137/4. The popular Freddie Brown strode out to the applause of the crowd hoping for some more Melbourne-style big-hitting and they were not disappointed. Hassett took the new ball, but Brown hit Bill Johnston to the fence, lofted Lindwall into the deep and cracked a straight-drive onto Umpire Barlow's foot. He added 50 with Parkhouse (25) before the Welshman pulled Ian Johnson to Arthur Morris at mid-on at 187/5. He was replaced by Trevor Bailey who held up one end while Brown scattered the in-field and clouted the Australian bowling round the ground. When he was finally out the next day, playing over a yorker from Ray Lindwall for 79, he had made his highest Test score, the highest for England so far in the series, and received a royal reception from the crowd. England was now 258/6, their highest innings of a low scoring series, but without their fiery captain they collapsed to 290 all out. Bailey had his thumb broken by a Lindwall bouncer at 263/6 and was taken to St Vincent's Hospital. Godfrey Evans struck 3 fours in his 23 not out, but Alec Bedser was bowled by Lindwall (2/60) and John Warr by Miller (4/37). Bailey returned at 281/8 and tried to bat one-handed before he was caught by Don Tallon of Ian Johnson. Doug Wright joined Evans, but was run out for a duck by his Kent team-mate, tripping over his bat and pulling a muscle as he rushed home and England were all out for 290.|$|E
2500|$|The batting captain {{is allowed}} seven minutes of rolling before his innings and Freddie Brown {{asked for the}} heavy roller to press down the wicket and {{take some of the}} demons out of it. In those days the Woolloongabba still used an old heavy roller drawn by a horse called Dobbin. As it had to be unhitched and led round after each pull of the roller over the pitch, most of the seven minutes was wasted and Brown didn't get much of the rolling he asked for. This was of great {{importance}} as if he had insisted on seven minutes actual rolling instead of messing about at either end the wicket would have been much less dangerous and England would have had less time to bat out before stumps. Though as Bill O'Reilly pointed out the time limits were devised when horse-drawn rollers were the norm and mechanical rollers were unheard of. Initially <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>difference</b> as Reg Simpson was bowled first ball by a full toss from Ray Lindwall (2/21). The veteran England scorer Bill Ferguson was using his famous Ferguson Charts to record the details of each innings; how many runs a batsman had scored, how many balls, how many minutes, how many boundaries, etc. when Simpson was out one wag called out [...] "How long Bill, and how many fours?" [...] which produced a roar of laughter from the press box that astonished the crowd. Cyril Washbrook (6) and John Dewes (9) were determined to see out the day with dead bats and the wicket showed no signs of danger, but Sam Loxton took a superb catch {{to get rid of the}} Lancastrian off Lindwall. Jack Iverson was called up to bowl his first Test over 27 minutes before stumps and had Trevor Bailey in all kinds of trouble as his poked and prodded and could have been out five or six times in the mystery spinner's maiden over. Dewes was bowled by Keith Miller and with one over from Iverson remaining, Alec Bedser came out and immediately appealed against the bad light, but was turned down as he had yet to face a ball. He holed out to Neil Harvey off Iverson, Bailey gave a simple catch to Bill Johnston and Godfrey Evans ran out his fellow wicket-keeper Arthur McIntyre when he called for an unnecessary third run. Brown had fed in nightwatchman after nightwatchman in order to save Hutton, Compton and himself for the next day, but the Man from Pudsey still had to come out at 30/6 to survive the last two balls of an extraordinary day. When asked for his opinion that night Hutton said they might win [...] "if the others will stay till lunch and it doesn't rain again". It didn't rain again, but needing 163 to win with only four wickets in hand there was no room for mistakes. In the morning Brown, the umpires and a stopwatch ensured that England got their full 10 minutes rolling at the start of the day, which took nearly half an hour to complete. Evans (5) helped Hutton add 16 runs before he was caught by Loxton off Bill Johnston (2/30). Denis Compton came to the crease, but lasted one ball as he departed like Evans [...] "c Loxton, b Johnston". Brown came in at number 10 and held on grimly as Hutton peeled off 3 boundaries, though in the end the captain made 17 of their 29 runs together before he became Loxton's fourth victim when he was caught off Iverson (4/43). Doug Wright was the last man in at 77/9 and his batting tended to be a hit and miss affair which rarely reached double figures. Hutton (62 not out) farmed the bowling ruthlessly, making 43 of the 45 runs added for the last wicket. Wright managed to hold a straight bat up to the few balls he was left to face until the last four balls from Iverson before lunch. He kept out the first three, but spooned the last to Ray Lindwall at square leg and the match was over. The 12,000 strong crowd gave Hutton an heroic ovation and after lunch he replied to the congratulations showered on him with by admitting that [...] "with a bit of luck I'd have won the game".|$|E
