5|$|Block II {{had already}} been planned to use a {{completely}} redesigned hatch which opened outward, and could be opened {{in less than five}} seconds. Concerns of accidental opening were addressed by using a cartridge of pressurized nitrogen to drive the release mechanism in an emergency, instead of the <b>explosive</b> <b>bolts</b> used on Project Mercury.|$|E
5|$|Detailed {{instructions}} in relatively small print for various technological devices appear at several {{points in the}} film, the most visible of which are the lengthy instructions for the zero-gravity toilet on the Aries Moon shuttle. Similar detailed instructions for replacing the <b>explosive</b> <b>bolts</b> also appear on the hatches of the E.V.A. pods, most visibly in closeup just before Bowman's pod leaves the ship to rescue Frank Poole.|$|E
5|$|On July 21, 1961, Grissom was {{pilot of}} the second Project Mercury flight, Mercury-Redstone 4, which he named Liberty Bell 7. This was a sub-orbital flight that lasted 15 minutes and 37 seconds. After splashdown, {{emergency}} <b>explosive</b> <b>bolts</b> unexpectedly fired and blew the hatch off, causing water to flood into the spacecraft. Quickly exiting through the open hatch and into the ocean, Grissom nearly drowned as water began filling his spacesuit. A recovery helicopter tried to lift and retrieve the spacecraft, but the flooding spacecraft became too heavy, and it was ultimately cut loose before sinking.|$|E
40|$|An <b>explosive</b> <b>bolt</b> {{has been}} {{developed}} that has a one-sided dual initiation train {{all the way down}} to the pyro charge for high reliability, while still allowing the other side of the bolt to remain in place after actuation to act as a thermal seal in an extremely high-temperature environment. This lightweight separation device separates at a single fracture plane, and has as much redundancy/reliability as possible. The initiation train comes into the <b>explosive</b> <b>bolt</b> from one side...|$|R
50|$|The {{launch of}} Expedition 10 was delayed beyond its {{scheduled}} October 9, 2004 launch date. During preflight testing, an <b>explosive</b> <b>bolt</b> was accidentally activated on the Soyuz TMA-5 spacecraft. The resulting damage was repaired prior to launch.|$|R
50|$|The {{launch of}} Expedition 10 was rescheduled. During {{preflight}} testing, an <b>explosive</b> <b>bolt</b> was accidentally activated on the Soyuz TMA-5 spacecraft. The resulting damage caused was repaired {{and the mission}} launched from Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 14 October 2004.|$|R
5|$|North American had {{originally}} suggested the hatch open outward and use <b>explosive</b> <b>bolts</b> {{to blow the}} hatch in case of emergency, as had been done in Project Mercury. NASA did not agree, arguing the hatch could accidentally open, as it had on Grissom's Liberty Bell 7 flight, so the Manned Spacecraft Center designers rejected the explosive design {{in favor of a}} mechanically operated one for the Gemini and Apollo programs. Before the fire, the Apollo astronauts had recommended changing the design to an outward-opening hatch, and this was already slated for inclusion in the Block II Command Module design. According to Donald K. Slayton's testimony before the House investigation of the accident, this was based on ease of exit for spacewalks {{and at the end of}} flight, rather than for emergency exit.|$|E
25|$|The M.52's single pilot, who, for the {{intended}} first flight, {{would have been}} test pilot Eric Brown, would have flown the aircraft from a small cockpit which was set inside the shock cone at {{the nose of the}} aircraft. The pressurised cockpit, in which the pilot would have had to fly the aircraft in a semi-prone position, was complete with a curved windscreen that was aligned with the contours of the bullet-shaped nose. In the event of an emergency, the entire section could be jettisoned, the separation from the rest of aircraft being initiated via multiple cordite-based <b>explosive</b> <b>bolts.</b> Air pressure would force the detached capsule off the fuselage while a parachute would slow its descent; during the capsule's descent, the pilot would bail out at a lower altitude and then parachute to safety. In order to serve its role as a research aircraft, the M.52 was to be equipped with comprehensive flight instrumentation, including automated instrument recorders and strain gauging throughout the structure connected to an oscilloscope.|$|E
500|$|The launch {{simulation}} on January 27, 1967, on pad 34, was a [...] "plugs-out" [...] test {{to determine}} whether the spacecraft would operate nominally on (simulated) internal power while detached from all cables and umbilicals. Passing this test was essential to making the February 21 launch date. The test was considered non-hazardous because neither the launch vehicle nor the spacecraft was loaded with fuel or cryogenics, and all pyrotechnic systems (<b>explosive</b> <b>bolts)</b> were disabled.|$|E
50|$|The {{frangible}} nut, commonly {{confused with}} an <b>explosive</b> <b>bolt,</b> is a component {{used in many}} industries, but most commonly by NASA to sever mechanical connections. It is, by definition, an explosively-splittable nut. The bolt remains intact while the nut itself is split into two or more parts.|$|R
40|$|Threaded {{split ring}} {{connector}} quickly and cleanly separates two structural members by remote control. The connector is retained in an expanded position by spring plates that are deflected and held by an <b>explosive</b> <b>bolt.</b> Ignition {{of the bolt}} effects the separation. This conceptual approach lends itself to various configurations and sizes of structures...|$|R
40|$|This {{invention}} {{is comprised}} of a high speed door assembly, comprising an actuator cylinder and piston rods, a pressure supply cylinder and fittings, an electrically detonated <b>explosive</b> <b>bolt,</b> a honeycomb structured door, a honeycomb structured decelerator, and a structural steel frame encasing the assembly to close over a 3 foot diameter opening within 50 milliseconds of actuation, to contain hazardous materials and vapors within a test fixture...|$|R
2500|$|Enterprise also lacked RCS {{thrusters}} (which were {{useless in}} atmospheric flight) and hydraulic mechanisms for {{the landing gear}}; the landing gear doors were simply opened {{through the use of}} <b>explosive</b> <b>bolts</b> and the gear dropped down solely by gravity. [...] As it was only used for atmospheric testing, Enterprise featured a large nose probe mounted on its nose cap, common on test aircraft because the location provides the most accurate readings for the test instruments, being mounted {{out in front of the}} disturbed airflow.|$|E
2500|$|The GT-1 {{was usually}} {{released}} from its carrier aircraft {{at an altitude}} of this provided a standoff range of as much as [...] under ideal conditions. The GT-1's warload consisted of a Mark 13 Mod 2A aerial torpedo. The GT-1 was fitted with a paravane, trailing [...] below {{the main body of the}} craft; upon the paravane's striking the surface of the water, <b>explosive</b> <b>bolts</b> would fire to release the torpedo, which would then execute a preset search pattern to locate and destroy its target.|$|E
2500|$|Combat is {{undertaken}} from a first-person perspective; the player is {{armed with a}} variety of upgradeable firearms, as well as a crossbow, and boomerang-like weapons called [...] "wingsticks" [...] which can be used for stealthy attacks. There are several types of ammunition available for each weapon, to allow the player to further customize their play style. As an example, the crossbow's primary ammunition is metal bolts, but it also can shoot electrified bolts, <b>explosive</b> <b>bolts,</b> and more. There are two standard varieties of enemies: enemies with firearms which will take cover and exchange fire with the player, and melee enemies that will charge the player and attack with melee weapons.|$|E
50|$|Reflectors were {{arranged}} {{around the outside}} of the reactor to provide the means to control the reactor. The reflectors were composed of a layer of beryllium, which would reflect neutrons, thus allowing the reactor to begin and maintain the fission process. The reflectors were held in place by a retaining band anchored by an <b>explosive</b> <b>bolt.</b> When the reflector was ejected from the unit, the reactor could not sustain the nuclear fission reaction and the reactor permanently shut down.|$|R
50|$|A {{pyrotechnic}} fastener (also {{called an}} <b>explosive</b> <b>bolt,</b> or pyro, within context) is a fastener, usually a nut or bolt, that incorporates a pyrotechnic charge {{that can be}} initiated remotely. One or more explosive charges embedded within the bolt are typically activated by an electric current, and the charge breaks the bolt into two or more pieces. The bolt is typically scored around its circumference at the point(s) where the severance should occur. Such bolts are often used in space applications to ensure separation between rocket stages, because they are lighter and much more reliable than mechanical latches.|$|R
50|$|Each PAM {{consists}} of four primary components: a Tandem Forward Charge (TFC), a Follow Through Charge (FTC), a propulsion system, and an electronic fusing system. The PAM is placed against the structure and fires an <b>explosive</b> <b>bolt,</b> pinning the PAM in place. It then fires the TFC, which {{consists of}} two explosive devices: one, the forward charge, that cuts rebar, and the other, the hole-drilling charge, that drills {{a hole in the}} target. The FTC is then accelerated by the propulsion system into the newly drilled hole, where it detonates, removing up to 75% of the target's ability to bear loads.|$|R
2500|$|Despite {{the common}} {{misconception}} that the gull-wing doors are mere stylistic affectations, {{the design is}} a very practical one in a tight urban parking space. When properly designed and counterbalanced, they require little side-clearance to open (about 27.5cm, or 11" [...] in the DeLorean) and allow much better entrance/egress than conventional doors. The most obvious downside to having gull-wing doors is that, should the car roll over and come to rest on its roof, exit by the doors would be impossible, requiring a large windscreen opening to escape. The Mercedes SLS solved this problem by fitting <b>explosive</b> <b>bolts</b> in the hinges, that would blow up {{in the event that}} the car rolls over.|$|E
2500|$|The Airacuda {{was plagued}} with {{problems}} from the start. The lofty performance estimates were unobtainable as, despite its sleek looks, the Airacuda was heavy and was slower than most bombers. In {{the event of}} interception by enemy fighters, the Airacuda was not maneuverable enough to dogfight, while the meager [...] bombload was of little use in the intended fighter-bomber role. Even the 37mm cannons were of less value than predicted. The cannons {{had a tendency to}} fill the gun nacelles with smoke whenever fired and, additionally, fears persisted as to how the gunners would escape in an emergency, with the propellers directly behind them. An emergency bailout would have required both propellers to be feathered, though additional provision was made with the use of <b>explosive</b> <b>bolts</b> on the propellers to jettison them {{in the event of a}} bailout.|$|E
50|$|Later, NASA {{announced}} that it was looking into a problem with <b>explosive</b> <b>bolts</b> that failed to fire properly during the launch. Immediately before the twin solid rocket boosters fired into life, only one set of pyrotechnics in ten <b>explosive</b> <b>bolts</b> exploded when commanded to do so. All 10 nuts exploded as planned, but NASA was interested in finding out an explanation for the unexpected anomaly.|$|E
5000|$|Spacecraft #9 had {{originally}} been intended to fly on MA-4, but Spacecraft #8 was used instead after having been recycled from the failed MA-3 launch. #9 was {{the second of the}} [...] "Mark II" [...] Mercury capsules with a larger square window and <b>explosive</b> <b>bolt</b> hatch, while the older [...] "Mark I" [...] capsule had small port windows and a heavy locking mechanism. Gus Grissom's flight on MR-4 had used a Mark II capsule, but it was necessary to test it on a proper orbital mission to ensure that the large window could handle the much higher heat of reentry there.|$|R
50|$|To provide {{oxidation}} resistance for reuse capability, {{the outer layers}} of the RCC were coated with silicon carbide. The silicon-carbide coating protected the carbon-carbon from oxidation. The RCC was highly resistant to fatigue loading that was experienced during ascent and entry. It was stronger than the tiles and was also used around the socket of the forward attach point of the orbiter to the External Tank to accommodate the shock loads of the <b>explosive</b> <b>bolt</b> detonation. RCC was the only TPS material that also served as structural support {{for part of the}} orbiter's aerodynamic shape: the wing leading edges and the nose cap. All other TPS components (tiles and blankets) were mounted onto structural materials that supported them, mainly the aluminum frame and skin of the orbiter.|$|R
5000|$|Ari Monster: This monster {{appeared}} in episode 7. Its powers include teleportation, size changing, <b>explosive</b> body energy <b>bolts,</b> summoning roses armed with venom spray, invisibility, and mouth venom spray.|$|R
50|$|Mission 6 {{tested the}} safety systems with a drop test from 700 m. One of the parachutes was opened {{to test the}} <b>explosive</b> <b>bolts.</b> The test was a success and the cabin was {{recovered}} in good condition.|$|E
50|$|In aviation, to {{jettison}} is {{to discard}} fuel, external stores or other expendable items. The item is usually jettisioned by operating a switch or handle; external stores may {{be separated from}} the aircraft by use of <b>explosive</b> <b>bolts</b> or a mechanism.|$|E
50|$|Unique among {{helicopters}} of its time, it {{was fitted}} with a crew emergency extraction system. This system, when activated, fired <b>explosive</b> <b>bolts</b> that severed the main rotor blades, egress panels were blown off {{the roof of the}} aircraft, then the crew was extracted using rockets.|$|E
5000|$|Dokuja Monster: This monster {{appeared}} in episode 5. Its powers include toxic fangs, an extendable electric tentacle {{for the right}} hand, invisibility, summoning cobras, speed, and <b>explosive</b> mouth energy <b>bolts.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Sasori Monster: This monster {{appeared}} in episode 4. Its powers include a mouth stinger that dissolves victims, fast burrowing, a double sided triangular dagger, <b>explosive</b> eye energy <b>bolts,</b> telekinesis, and invisibility.|$|R
50|$|Hellstrike is a {{seedling}} (mutant), {{the people}} who were genetically affected by the Comet Effect of the 1960s. He's a living weapon of pure energy, what the scientist call a gaseous sentient posthuman entity. He can fire <b>explosive</b> plasma <b>bolts,</b> build a protective plasma shield and fly by means of his energy jet stream. Unfortunately, since one of his first missions, he's been bound to a containment suit that prevents him from dispersing. Hellstrike is immune to telepathy due to being more energy in nature than human.|$|R
50|$|The Kamov Ka-50, which entered {{limited service}} with Russian forces in 1995, {{was the first}} {{production}} helicopter with an ejection seat. The system {{is similar to that}} of a conventional fixed-wing aircraft however the main rotors are equipped with <b>explosive</b> <b>bolts</b> to jettison the blades moments before the seat is fired.|$|E
50|$|To test {{various parts}} of the Jupiter equipment, ABMA began {{launching}} Jupiter hardware on previously planned Redstone development missions. These were known under the name Jupiter-A. Among the systems tested by Jupiter-A were the ST-80 INS, angle-of-attack sensors, fusing systems and the <b>explosive</b> <b>bolts</b> that separated the booster from the upper stage.|$|E
5000|$|Block II {{had already}} been planned to use a {{completely}} redesigned hatch which opened outward, and could be opened {{in less than five}} seconds. Concerns of accidental opening were addressed by using a cartridge of pressurized nitrogen to drive the release mechanism in an emergency, instead of the <b>explosive</b> <b>bolts</b> used on Project Mercury.|$|E
5000|$|The SRBs {{committed}} the shuttle to liftoff and ascent (to orbit) flight, without {{the possibility of}} launch or liftoff/ascent abort, until both motors had fully, and simultaneously, fulfilled their functions, consumed their propellants, were producing zero net reaction thrust and had been jettisoned (again simultaneously) by <b>explosive</b> jettisoning <b>bolts</b> from the remainder of the vehicle launch [...] "stack" [...] (shuttle w/engines; fuel/oxidizer tank). Only then could any conceivable set of launch or post-liftoff abort procedures be contemplated. In addition, failure of an individual SRB's thrust output or ability to adhere to the designed performance profile was not survivable.|$|R
40|$|Finite element {{analysis}} of the Space Shuttle 2. 5 -inch frangible nut was conducted to improve understanding of the current design and proposed design changes to this explosively-actuated nut. The 2. 5 -inch frangible nut is used in two places to attach the aft end of the Space Shuttle Orbiter to the External Tank. Both 2. 5 -inch frangible nuts must function to complete safe separation. The 2. 5 -inch frangible nut contains two explosive boosters containing RDX explosive each capable of splitting the nut in half, on command from the Orbiter computers. To ensure separation, the boosters {{are designed to be}} redundant. The detonation of one booster is sufficient to split the nut in half. However, beginning in 1987 some production lots of 2. 5 -inch frangible nuts have demonstrated an inability to separate using only a single booster. The cause of the failure has been attributed to differences in the material properties and response of the Inconel 718 from which the 2. 5 -inch frangible nut is manufactured. Subsequent tests have resulted in design modifications of the boosters and frangible nut. Model development and initial analysis was conducted by Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) under funding from NASA Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center (NASA-JSC) starting in 1992. Modeling codes previously developed by SNL were transferred to NASA-JSC for further analysis on this and other devices. An <b>explosive</b> <b>bolt</b> with NASA Standard Detonator (NSD) charge, a 3 / 4 -inch frangible nut, and the Super*Zip linear separation system are being modeled by NASA-JSC...|$|R
50|$|The T-90M {{features}} the 'Kaktus K-6' <b>bolted</b> <b>explosive</b> reactive armour (ERA) package on its frontal hull and turret-top (the T-90S has 'Kontakt-5' ERA), is fitted with an enhanced environmental control system supplied by Israel's Kinetics Ltd for providing cooled {{air to the}} fighting compartment, has additional internal volume for housing the cryogenic cooling systems for new-generation thermal imagers like the THALES-built Catherine-FC thermal imager (operating in the 8-12 micrometre bandwidth). In all, India plans to have 1,640 T-90 tanks in service by 2018-2020.|$|R
