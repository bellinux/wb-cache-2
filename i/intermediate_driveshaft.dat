5000|$|The 1966 Oldsmobile Toronado (along {{with its}} sister models the Cadillac Eldorado and Buick Riviera) used a novel {{arrangement}} {{which had the}} engine and transmission in a 'side-by-side' arrangement with power being transmitted between the two via a heavy-duty chain, and a specially designed <b>intermediate</b> <b>driveshaft</b> that passed under the engine sump. This family has {{the distinction of being}} the highest engine capacity (8.2 L) front-wheel-drive vehicles ever built. The Saab 99 and “classic” Saab 900 also used a similar arrangement. The Eagle Premier used a similar powertrain arrangement found in the Renault 21 and 25 - later becoming the basis for the Chrysler LH sedans produced until the 2004 model year.|$|E
