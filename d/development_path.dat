5|$|The {{introduction}} of the first effective anti-aircraft missiles by the late 1950s changed this picture dramatically. Missiles could stand ready for immediate launch, eliminating operational delays like {{the time needed to}} get the pilot into the cockpit of a fighter. Guidance did not require wide-area tracking or calculation of an intercept course: a simple comparison of the time needed to fly to the altitude of the target returned the required deflection. Missiles also had greater altitude capability than any aircraft, and improving this to adapt to new aircraft was a low-cost <b>development</b> <b>path.</b> The US was aware of Soviet work in the field, and had reduced the expected operational lifetime of the U-2, knowing that it would become vulnerable to these missiles as they were improved. This later happened with the 1960 downing of the U-2 flown by Gary Powers.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 1930s Baldwin and the Pennsylvania Railroad made an all-in {{bet on the}} future of steam in {{passenger}} rail service with Baldwin's duplex-drive S1 locomotive. It proved difficult to operate, unreliable, costly to maintain, and unsuited for its intended service. Baldwin developed a revision of the same basic design with the T1, introduced in 1943. While the T1s were actually used for PRR's long distance express trains, they still had many of the problems of the S1. The whole S1-T1 venture resulted in losses for PRR and investment in a dead-end development effort for Baldwin at a critical time for both companies. In the early 1940s Baldwin embarked upon its efforts to develop steam turbine power, producing the S2 direct-drive turbine locomotive in 1944. Baldwin's steam turbine program failed to produce a single successful design. Baldwin's steam-centered <b>development</b> <b>path</b> had left them flat-footed in the efforts necessary to compete in the postwar diesel market dominated by EMD and ALCO-GE.|$|E

40|$|The path-of-development metaphor {{registers}} {{in language}} {{the idea that}} the conditions of existence of people get better (or worse in the case of underdevelopment) in particular ways. To measure a metaphor, in this paper, a method of moving between the figurative and the literal is used. <b>Development</b> <b>paths</b> for 150 nations are measured for the period 1965 - 87 by using a methodology that can be described as historical factorial ecology. The measurement of <b>development</b> <b>paths</b> involves analytically combining the social, historical, and geographical dimensions of the development and underdevelopment process, an interpretation of which requires and encourages a combining of the sociological, historical, and geographical imaginations. The findings indicate that the debates within development theory resulted from different theories focusing upon different types of <b>development</b> <b>paths.</b> <b>Development</b> is complexly multidimensional with economic and social <b>development</b> <b>paths</b> resembling the linear and multilinear claims of orthodox modernization theory and with political <b>development</b> <b>paths</b> approximating the antilinear claims of underdevelopment theories. Development and underdevelopment theorists, like the blind wise men encountering the elephant, each described only parts of the beast, assuming that the economic trunk was identical to its political leg. ...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyse how {{different}} <b>development</b> <b>paths</b> lead to different development outcome by comparing the <b>development</b> <b>paths</b> and outcomes of two Samut provinces, Samut Sakorn and Samut Songkram. Previously, both provinces shared the same ecosystem and cultural background. 30 years ago, they took different economic <b>development</b> <b>paths,</b> resulting in a totally different economic and social structure today. Unlike modernisation theory, the richer economy does not gain a better quality of life in this case. While Samut Sakorn has much higher economic growth, Samut Songkram shows more balanced development approach and, consequently much better wellbeing outcomes. Moreover, in present day, Samut Songkram has become one of the most well-known provinces for Thai exotic products and life-styles. This may lead Thai society to reconsider their <b>development</b> <b>paths,</b> especially during the quest for sufficiency economy...|$|R
500|$|Development on Path of Radiance {{began at}} Intelligent Systems after the {{international}} {{success of the}} first localized game in the series, released overseas under the title Fire Emblem. Due to high development costs, the team had been unwilling to develop a title for the GameCube, but after Fire Emblems success overseas, they decided to return from portable to home consoles for its next release. Nintendo SPD was also involved in <b>development.</b> <b>Path</b> of Radiance was the first Fire Emblem to have 3D in-game graphics, full-motion video cutscenes and voice acting. It {{was also the first}} home console game since [...] for the Super Famicom. Transitioning from 2D graphics to 3D graphics {{was one of the biggest}} challenges during development, especially the transition from the tilted overhead view to a character-to-character battle in third-person. One of the features left out due to this process was a dedicated battle arena. At the same time, they introduced the base as members of the development team wanted a place where characters could interact separate from the battlefield. As there was no combat gameplay involved, other types of activity were created, such as special support conversations. To make moves in battle and cutscenes realistic, the team used motion capture, then made sure it appeared a little over the top so the fantasy feeling of the Fire Emblem series remained intact. By the end of development, Narihiro had some regrets about the quality of the game, saying in an interview that he considered it to be only 70% complete when released.|$|E

50|$|Paths to a Kingdom {{features}} gameplay {{similar to}} that of past 3D games of The Settlers series. The player may choose between playing a Campaign game, a Skirmish Game, a ranked game and a multiplayer game. The game gives the player an opportunity to choose between three unique paths of development for victory: Military, Science, and Trade. In the traditional Military <b>development</b> <b>path,</b> the player builds the kingdom's army in order to conquer and destroy enemies. Players can also conquer enemy territories without making an army, by using priests. In the Science <b>development</b> <b>path,</b> the player must focus on researching technological upgrades. Finally in the Trade <b>development</b> <b>path,</b> the player builds their economy and attempts to occupy the best trade routes on the map. Each path of development contains unique units and possibilities. In all development paths, the player wins by collecting Victory points throughout the course of the game.|$|E

40|$|This paper compares {{technological}} <b>development</b> <b>paths</b> {{that determine}} future mitigation scenarios aimed at stabilizing atmospheric CO 2 concentrations. Future {{social and economic}} <b>development</b> <b>paths</b> have already been compared {{in relation to their}} impact on climate mitigation by Morita, Nakicenovic and Robinson (2000). This paper is an expansion of that earlier comparison. Forty stabilization scenarios are reviewed, and all use as their baseline the new scenarios by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published in the Special Report on Emission Scenarios (Nakicenovic et al, 2000). Several common tendencies and characteristics can be observed across the scenarios. First, the different technological <b>development</b> <b>paths</b> described in the baseline IPCC scenarios require that: CO 2 emissions be reduced by different levels; different schedules for the reductions be adopted; and, different technology/policy measures be chosen to stabilize atmospheric CO 2 concentrations - even to achieve the same stabilization level. Second, no one single measure is sufficient for the development, adoption and diffusion of mitigation options to achieve stabilization within the accepted time-frame. Third, the level of technology/policy measures needed to achieve stabilization {{toward the end of the}} 21 st century or beginning of the 22 nd century will be greatly affected by the choice of technological <b>development</b> <b>paths</b> over next decades. The paper also identifies some characteristics in technological measures across the different technological <b>development</b> <b>paths</b> to achieve the stabilization targets...|$|R
