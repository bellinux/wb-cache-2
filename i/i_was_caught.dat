5|$|Two events {{affected}} me most, one when a colleague dropped himself from second floor to escape under-covered police who stormed school. The second incident was when a dear teacher was arrested. That is when my voice started {{to rise and}} become annoying. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>caught</b> vandalizing a school wall by writing apolitical human rights statements on school walls and was given the choice to either be submitted to police or to switch school. So I took {{the easy way out}} and since I was the top student back then, I choose to switch to Sheikh Abdul Aziz school.|$|E

I felt {{a little}} let down with my {{releases}} from Aphrodite. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>caught</b> out {{like a lot of}} artists were, with record companies figuring out how to do single releases these days. I remember doing a promo for one of the last singles and it just felt really old-fashioned. I'm pretty computer-savvy, something didn't feel right, but no one said anything to me. You get Britney releasing [...] "Hold It Against Me" [...] and Gaga's [...] "Born This Way" [...] available on iTunes the day you hear it first. That's how it should be. And there's me waiting for a mid-week chart figure like it's 1989." ...|$|E
500|$|Klaus Berg of the Hamburg Chronicle {{noted that}} [...] "(...) It is a {{well-known}} cliche that American film makers prefer to provide their audiences with a happy ending. Here, a viewer with even the most superficial and rudimentary knowledge {{of the history of}} the Second World War and of the National Socialist Regime would know from the very outset that a happy ending is out of the question, that all the protagonists' efforts and plans are doomed to end in bitter failure. Knowing this, I was surprised to realize how deeply <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>caught</b> up in the tension of the plot, how desperately I was hoping against hope that Cruise and his fellows would after all succeed. (...) No, not for one minute during the entire film did I think about Scientology." ...|$|E

You allege that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>caught</b> on camera, butt naked, banging on the log cabin floor? It wasn't me." ...|$|E
2500|$|All I can {{remember}} is, Bob Willis had this big inswinging, in-dipping action," [...] Darling says. [...] "The ball was pitched well outside off stump {{was the last}} thing I remember. Once it swung in, it also cut in further. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>caught</b> in no man's land. I was sort of caught out of position, and hit in the chest. Unfortunately, at the time, I was chewing a chewy, and I swallowed my tongue and chewy as well. That caused me to black out.|$|E
2500|$|Director Rick Sloane {{was shocked}} at his {{treatment}} {{at the conclusion of}} Hobgoblins, in which Sloane himself was mercilessly mocked over the film's end credits. In a 2008 interview, however, Sloane clarified his comments, saying that [...] "I laughed through the entire MST3K episode, until the very end. I wasn't expecting the humor to suddenly be at my own expense. I was mortified when they dragged out the cardboard cutout and pretended to do an interview with me. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>caught</b> off guard. I had never seen them rip apart any other director before on the show." [...] However, he credits the success of the MST3K episode with inspiring him to make a sequel to Hobgoblins, released in 2009.|$|E

2500|$|... "We started class, {{and in the}} Groundlings curriculum, one of {{the first}} {{exercises}} you do is the cliched 'trust' game. I made everyone stand in a circle, with me in the center, and I said, being onstage, you have to trust your fellow actors, especially when you're an improviser. You're {{going to be there for}} each other, and they're going to be there for you. For example, I'm going to fall back, knowing that you'll catch me. Then I let myself fall backward, and sure enough, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>caught.</b> Everyone gets out some nervous laughter, and then they all took turns doing it. By the time it got around to Mariska Hargitay, we'd already done it with ten or eleven students, and they had clearly gotten the point. Then it was Mariska's turn. 'Okay, Mariska, cross your arms in front of you and gently fall back,' I said. She fell back and nobody caught her. She fell flat on her ass. I was horrified. This had never happened in one of my classes before." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the start}} of World War I at the young age of 16, Brodovitch {{abandoned}} his dream of entering the Imperial Art Academy and {{ran away from home}} to join the Russian army. Not long after, his father had him brought home and hired a private tutor to help Alexey finish school. Upon graduating, Brodovitch ran away again on several occasions. He recalls: After a week or so I ran away to the front line to kill Germans. But my father, now a military general {{at the head of a}} Red Cross hospital train, had plenty of influence, and I was soon brought back to him. On the train back I was employed as a nurses' aid. In East Prussia I ran away again and joined a nearby regiment. Once again <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>caught,</b> and this time I was sent to an officers' school, the Corps de Pages. During the Russian Civil War, Brodovitch served with the White Army. While fighting against the Bolsheviks in Odessa, he was badly wounded and was hospitalized for a time in Kislovodsk, in the Caucasus. [...] In 1918, the town was surrounded by the Bolsheviks, forcing Brodovitch into exile. It was during this retreat to the south through Caucasus and Turkey that he met his future wife, Nina.|$|E
2500|$|In July 1998, Wright {{moved to}} West Ham United for £500,000. He spent fifteen months as a West Ham player, scoring the winner on his debut against Sheffield Wednesday, without {{reaching}} the same form {{he had at}} Arsenal. During his spell there he made headlines when he vandalised the referee's dressing room at Upton Park after being sent off during a match against Leeds United. He had subsequent short spells at Nottingham Forest, Celtic, and Burnley (whom he helped to promotion to Division One) before retiring in 2000. Whilst at Celtic, Wright became involved in a campaign by some fans calling {{for the removal of}} manager, John Barnes. Celtic's performances had been poor. Wright, Barnes and Regi Blinker were considered by some to be not sufficiently talented to improve the club. Wright and Blinker were consequently abused by some Celtic fans. Wright said of the incidents, [...] "I felt <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>caught</b> up in a war crisis in Kosovo not involved in a football result that wrecked John Barnes' career as Celtic manager." [...] "Some so-called fans, a few morons who know nothing better, covered my car in spit, they were shouting obscenities at myself and Regi Blinker." [...] Wright scored on his debut for Celtic as he had for Nottingham Forest. He finished his club career with 313 goals in all competitions.|$|E

2500|$|Atto was {{captured}} by Task Force Ranger on September 21, 1993, from a location near Digfer Hospital. The Rangers had made an earlier attempt at Atto's capture, but missed him by seconds. In a speech at a church in Daytona, in January 2002, William Boykin, responsible for the operation, recounted, [...] "There {{was a man in}} Mogadishu named Osman Atto... He went on CNN and he laughed at us, and he said, 'They'll never get me because Allah will protect me.'" [...] The arrest was later portrayed in the 2001 film Black Hawk Down. In an interview with the BBC, Atto indicated that many aspects of the movie are factually incorrect. He took exception with the ostentatious character chosen to portray him; Atto does not look like the actor who portrayed him, smoke cigars, or wear earrings, facts which were later confirmed by SEAL Team Six sniper Howard E. Wasdin in his 2012 memoirs. Wasdin also indicated that while the character in the movie ridiculed his captors, Atto in reality seemed concerned that Wasdin and his men had been sent to kill rather than apprehend him. Atto additionally stated that he was not consulted about the project or approached for permission, and that the film sequence re-enacting his arrest contained several inaccuracies: [...] "First of all when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>caught</b> on 21 September, I was only travelling with one Fiat 124, not three vehicles as it shows in the film... And when the helicopter attacked, people were hurt, people were killed... The car we were travelling in, and I have got proof, it was hit at least 50 times. And my colleague Ahmed Ali was injured on both legs... I think it was not right, the way they portrayed both the individual and the action. It was not right.|$|E
