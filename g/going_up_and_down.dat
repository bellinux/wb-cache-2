25|$|Old Albany Post Road {{passes through}} heavily wooded and lightly {{populated}} country along the southeastern {{edge of the}} Hudson Highlands. Houses, many on large lots, are the only development along the road, {{and there are no}} settlements along its length. The countryside is rugged, with the road <b>going</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> several hills. Some areas are scenic, with meadows and views of the nearby hills and mountains.|$|E
25|$|The {{area had}} been long inhabited, but except for some green {{obsidian}} the mining that Pachuca is famous for began in the mid-16th century, during Spanish colonial rule. Pachuca remained a major mining center until the mid-20th century, with the city’s fortunes <b>going</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> with {{the health of the}} mining sector. In the mid-20th century a major downturn in mining pushed Pachuca to change the basis of its economy to industry, resulting in the revamping of the Universidad Autónoma de Hidalgo. Today mining forms {{only a fraction of the}} municipality’s economy.|$|E

25|$|It {{branches}} off to {{the northwest}} {{at the point where}} Gallows Hill Road becomes Sprout Brook Road. From there it takes a west-northwestward, meandering course at first, narrowing almost to one lane at some points and climbing steadily to where the Catskill Aqueduct crosses, but soon bends to the north-northeast and widens. It climbs and then descends over the next two miles (3km) to the Lake Celeste area, where it becomes more northerly. Then it bends to the northeast again, <b>going</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> several hills through mostly undeveloped areas, to Chapman Road, where the Appalachian Trail crosses.|$|E
500|$|Phillips {{set up the}} {{equipment}} behind his shop in the (12 square feet) middle living room, with a piano and an overturned tin bath in the cellar as a reverb chamber, with a speaker and microphone linked to the studio above. The recordings would normally be on tape, and then transferred to disc, although the tape was recorded over again during the next session. Because of trams, trucks, and horses <b>going</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> Kensington, Phillips had to hang heavy blankets over the studio door and a rear window to minimise the noise. Phillips' first recording was of himself singing [...] "Bonnie Marie of Argyle", (unaccompanied) {{and a few days}} later he recorded [...] "Unchained Melody", with local dance band singer Betty Roy. The first disc he cut in the studio was on 7 August 1955, with his eight-year-old daughter, Carol, singing, [...] "Mr Sandman". All the discs had [...] "Play with a light-weight pick-up" [...] on the label, as this would increase the life of the disc, which would eventually wear out.|$|E

2500|$|Ed Brophy, {{director}} of the International Boxing Hall of Fame, noted Camacho's talents in attracting an audience. He said, [...] "Camacho {{brought a lot of}} excitement to boxing. He was bright, colorful, and always gave something to talk about with his walks to the ring, with his unique style of entering, and the costumes he wore." [...] Brophy also praised Camacho's boxing skills, describing him as [...] "an exciting fighter, and one of the greats. He faced the best, <b>going</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> several divisions." [...] Alfredo R. Martínez, senior editor of ESPN Deportes, also noted Camacho's flamboyant approach, saying that [...] "if he wasn't the first, {{he was one of the}} firsts that entered the ring with extravagant costumes, feather crests, bright clothes, everything to the rhythm of some pop song".|$|E
2500|$|Old Testament prophets and patriarchs {{are portrayed}} {{on the fourth}} tier of the iconostasis, in {{accordance}} with the traditional Slavic structure. Three of the twelve Biblical figures in the row are hard to identify because they do not hold any emblems, nor do they have their names painted on the icon. However, the placement of the icons is rather strictly regulated, determining whom the three icons can portray. The first painting from the left is one of the three uncertain icons. Most probably it depicts Daniel as a youth. He holds a rock in his hand as described in one of his visions in Daniel 2. He could interpret the dream of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylonia, prophesying the fall of the great empires. In the king's dream, the strong empires, symbolized by a terrifying creature, were smashed by a rock. The next picture portrays Zechariah, the eleventh of the Twelve Minor Prophets, who led his people as a priest. He is depicted in a high priest's vestments holding a seven-branched menorah. Ezekiel's image is the third on the tier. He points to a [...] "closed gate" [...] with his right hand in accordance with one of his prophecies. Christian scholars interpreted this narrative later as the Old Testament reference to the Incarnation, to the birth of Jesus. The gate that can only be opened by God signifies Mary and the prince symbolizes Jesus. The next icon portrays David, the second king of the united Israel. He is depicted with the harp he played to expel the evil spirit possessing King Saul. David is followed by Jacob, holding his ladder. According to the Old Testament Jacob dreamed about a ladder reaching into heaven with angels <b>going</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> it. In Christian theology the ladder can stand for Jesus himself, bridging the gap between Heaven and Earth. The last prophet {{on the left side of}} the tier is Moses. He holds the Tablets of Stone on which the Ten Commandments are inscribed. The painters included two horn-like curls of hair on Moses' head as on Michelangelo's well-known statue.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, hidden Markov models (HMM) is studied for spike sorting. We {{notice that}} HMM state {{sequences}} have capability to represent spikes precisely and concisely. We build a HMM for spikes, where HMM states respect spike significant shape variations. Four shape variations are introduced: silence, <b>going</b> <b>up,</b> <b>going</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> peak. They constitute every spike with an underlying probabilistic dependence that is modelled by HMM. Based on this representation, spikes sorting becomes a classification problem of compact HMM state sequences. In addition, we enhance the method by defining HMM on extracted Cepstrum features, which improves {{the accuracy of}} spike sorting. Simulation results demonstrate {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed method as well as the efficiency...|$|R
