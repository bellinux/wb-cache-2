The extracted anthocyanin pigments then were exposed to number of environmental factors which could destabilize the anthocyanin molecules. These environmental factors were included three different pH (1,. 5 and 4), four various temperatures (5, 0, 0 and 40 °C) and {{presence or absence of}} light. The results showed that increasing in pH, temperature or exposure to light is able to destruction the anthocyanin pigments. Another factor affecting the tolerance of anthocyanin towards the environmental condition is the role of different varieties. Among the various Malus varieties anthocyanin pigment in M. domestica cv. red starking, showed the greatest resistance to destruction by environmental conditions, other varieties followed: M. domestica cv. <b>red</b> <b>delicious</b> M. domestica cv. jonathan and M. domestica cv. abbasi mashhad consecutively...|$|R
40|$|Background : Apples {{have been}} known as nutritious and natural medicines. The {{aim of this study}} was to {{determine}} the amounts of nutrients compounds of golden and <b>red</b> <b>delicious</b> apples produced in Lorestan, Iran. Materials and Methods: Apple cultivars were harvested from different locations throughout Lorestan province in September 2008. The samples were dried at 80 º C for two days. The dry materials were grounded to analyse the elements. Phosphorous calcium, iron, and zinc and sodium and potassium were measured by spectrometry, atomic absorption and flame photometry, respectively. Other measured factors were energy, protein, carbohydrate, water, ash, and fiber. Results: The amounts of water, soluble solid products, ash, and fiber in red apples varieties were 78, 17. 9, 1. 44, and 0. 72 percent, respectively. These values for golden delicious apples were 77, 16, 1. 42, and 0. 72 percent, respectively. Energy, sugars, and protein contents of <b>red</b> <b>delicious</b> apples were 73 calories, 18, and 0. 27 g/ 100, respectively. These amounts for golden varieties were 83 calories, 20. 6, and 0. 2 g/ 100, respectively. K, Ca, P, Na, Fe, and Zn contents of <b>red</b> <b>delicious</b> apples were 63. 8, 27. 6, 9, 4. 8, 0. 24, and 0. 14 mg/ 100, respectively. These values for golden delicious variety were 66. 3, 27. 7, 8. 8, 4. 5, 0. 23, and 0. 14 mg/ 100, respectively. Conclusion: Energy, carbohydrates, and calcium contents of apples varieties produced in Lorestan province were more than their contents in Iranian Food Composition Tables.

Machine vision systems benefit from specially designed {{digital image processing}} software to accomplish this task.

The performance of the implemented virtual grader is examined experimentally with an industrial grade camera connected to an image grabber of a computer based machine vision system. Results of this study are quite promising. In fact, efficiency achieved using proposed virtual grader is 95. 12 % if manual grading taken as reference level is assumed to be 100 % accurate.

40|$|Fifteen states {{account for}} 94 % of U. S. apple production. These states {{are listed in}} Table 22. 1 along with {{estimates}} of apple acreage, production volumes and values for 1999. There are two dramatic trends {{taking place in the}} U. S. apple industry. The first is a pronounced trend toward variety diversification from <b>red</b> <b>delicious</b> strains. Figure 22. 1 charts U. S. production of Red Delicious and Fuji/Gala apples from 1987 to 2000. The second dramatic trend taking place is the utilization of more intensive plantings. Since intensively planted orchards have more trees per acre, a size-controlling rootstock is used to limit tree size. Rootstock appropriate for high-density orchards are M 9 and M 26. A major advantage of higher density plantings is earlier production in the lifetime of the orchard. Increased labor efficiency in the mature orchard is another significant advantage. The M 26 and M 9 rootstocks, in addition to reducing tree size, promote flowering by the second leaf and continue to bloom heavily each year.

Two different types of apple cell wall characteristic were investigated to correlate with porosity and shrinkage after convective drying.

40|$|The {{proposed}} intelligent estimator {{is implemented}} using nearest neighbor classifier for automatic grading of <b>red</b> <b>delicious</b> apple fruit from its surface color using machine vision. Though different variants of nearest neighbor classifier {{are reported in}} the literature for color classification yet no systematic study is reported till-date for its application in fruit quality assessment using surface color information. The present work reports on comparative evaluation of different variants of nearest neighbor classifier for assessing the quality of apple fruit. It has been found experimentally that amongst different variants, Euclidean Distance Metric based k-Nearest Neighbor Classifier is best suited for this particular application. The performance of this classifier is evaluated at different illuminations of the fruit surface. It is found that efficiency is the highest at a particular intensity of surface illumination. In fact, efficiency achieved using proposed estimator is nearly 95. 12 % if manual grading is assumed to be 100 % accurate taken as reference. However, 4. 88 % variation is due to subjective judgment of human-beings in perceiving the apple fruit visually, which of course is obvious. Moreover, the repeatability of the proposed system is found to be 100 % as observed after rigorous experimental validation...|$|R

The experiments were performed on isolated papillary heart muscles from healthy male rats, healthy male rats treated with RDP, diabetic male rats, and diabetic male rats treated with RDP. The preparation was superfused with oxygenated Tyrode’s solution at 37 °C. The stimulation and the recording of the APs, the input resistance, and the threshold current were made using conventional electrophysiological methods. The RDP presented no significant effect in normal rats. Equivalent doses in diabetic rats reduced the APD and ARP. The relationship between input resistance and threshold current established an inverse correlation. The results indicate the following: (1) The functional structure of the cardiac ventricular syncytium in healthy rats is heterogeneous, in terms of input resistance and threshold current. Diabetes further accentuates the heterogeneity. (2) As a consequence, conduction block occurs and increases the possibility of reentrant arrhythmias. (3) These modifications in the ventricular syncytium, coupled with the increase in the ARP, are the adequate substrate so that, with diabetes, the heart becomes more arrhythmogenic. (4) RDP decreases the APD, the ARP, and most syncytium irregularity caused by diabetes...|$|R

This study assesses the economic impact of an extremely high population of Microtus montanus (mountain voles) in a large apple (Malus sp.) orchard in northcentral Washington State (U. S.
