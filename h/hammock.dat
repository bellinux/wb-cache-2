5|$|The {{plant growth}} around the <b>hammock</b> base is nearly impenetrable; beneath the canopy hammocks {{is an ideal}} habitat for animals. Reptiles (such as various species of snake and anole) and {{amphibians}} (such as the American green tree frog, Hyla cinerea), live in the hardwood hammocks. Birds such as barred owls (Strix varia), woodpeckers, northern cardinals (Cardinalis cardinalis), and southern bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) nest in <b>hammock</b> trees. Mammal species living in hardwood hammocks include opossums (Didelphis virginiana), raccoons (Procyon lotor), bobcats (Lynx rufus), Everglades minks (Neovison vison), marsh rabbits (Sylvilagus palustris), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), and the rare, critically endangered Florida panther (Puma concolor coryi).|$|E
5|$|Mulder and Scully {{visit the}} murderer's house, where Mulder sees a {{repairman}} {{working on the}} cable line. They find hundreds of video tapes of the news. Scully believes all the violence the man watched on TV may have {{led him to the}} murders, something Mulder does not believe. That night Scully watches the tapes, seeing if there are any clues to why the man committed murder. She steps outside for a break and sees Mulder in a car talking to the Cigarette Smoking Man. In the morning Scully suspiciously asks Mulder if he moved the car in the night. When Mulder tells her he only went out for a paper earlier, she believes he is lying. The next day a similar murder occurs when a woman thinks she sees her husband in a <b>hammock</b> with another woman; in reality she has killed her neighbor who was in a <b>hammock</b> with his dog. Mulder sees the same cable repairman near the house, who escapes from him. Climbing up on the telephone pole Mulder finds a device inside the cable box.|$|E

5|$|The Halo {{universe}} was first adapted into the graphic novel format in 2006, {{with the release}} of The Halo Graphic Novel, a collection of four short stories. It was written and illustrated by graphic novelists Lee <b>Hammock,</b> Jay Faerber, Tsutomu Nihei, Brett Lewis, Simon Bisley, Ed Lee and Jean Giraud. At the 2007 New York Comic Con, Marvel Comics announced they would be working on an ongoing Halo series with Brian Michael Bendis and Alex Maleev. The limited series, titled , bridges the gap between the events of Halo2 and Halo3; initially planned to conclude shortly before the release of Halo 3, the constant delays led to the final issue being published April 2009.|$|E
5|$|At 02:45, Amethyst {{was able}} to pull across the bows of Niémen, inflicting a devastating raking fire on the French ship which caused terrible damage. Niémen surged forward into Amethyst, but the {{collision}} caused little damage and at 03:00 Amethyst again raked her opponent, this time from the east. The frigates were so close that shot from Amethyst started fires among Niémens <b>hammock</b> netting, placed along the decks to deter boarding actions. At 03:15, Niémens mizenmast and main topmast collapsed and another fire {{broke out in the}} main top, but Amethyst was also severely damaged and at 03:30 her mainmast fell onto the deck from a combination of shot damage and stress in high winds. Niémens mainmast also collapsed a few minutes later. Both frigates had stopped firing at 03:25, as the confusion on their decks was brought under control.|$|E
5|$|Some of the driest {{land in the}} Everglades is pineland (also called pine rockland) ecosystem, {{located in}} the highest part of the Everglades with little to no hydroperiod. Some floors, however, may have flooded {{solution}} holes or puddles {{for a few months}} at a time. The most significant feature of the pineland is the single species of South Florida slash pine (Pinus elliottii). Pineland communities require fire to maintain them, and the trees have several adaptations that simultaneously promote and resist fire. The sandy floor of the pine forest is covered with dry pine needles that are highly flammable. South Florida slash pines are insulated by their bark to protect them from heat. Fire eliminates competing vegetation on the forest floor, and opens pine cones to germinate seeds. A period without significant fire can turn pineland into a hardwood <b>hammock</b> as larger trees overtake the slash pines. The understory shrubs in pine rocklands are the fire-resistant saw palmetto (Serenoa repens), cabbage palm (Sabal palmetto), and West Indian lilac (Tetrazygia bicolor). The most diverse group of plants in the pine community are the herbs, of which there are two dozen species. These plants contain tubers and other mechanisms that allow them to sprout quickly after being charred.|$|E

50|$|They are {{not fire}} {{maintained}} communities, although fire may burn into tropical hardwood <b>hammocks</b> under certain conditions. Tropical hardwood <b>hammocks</b> are habitat {{for a few}} endemic plants, and are critical habitat for many West Indian plant species when the northernmost portions of their ranges extend into South Florida. Tropical hardwood <b>hammocks</b> also provide important habitat for many species of wildlife, including nine federally listed species. While {{the majority of the}} remaining tropical hardwood <b>hammocks</b> outside the Florida Keys have now been acquired, <b>hammocks</b> are still significantly threatened by development in the Keys. Tropical hardwood <b>hammocks</b> have been heavily impacted by outright destruction, conversion to agriculture, exotic plant and animal species, collecting pressure on plants and animals, anthropogenic fires, and alterations in hydrology. Significant work has now been initiated to restore existing disturbed tropical hardwood <b>hammocks</b> and to control exotic plant species. Numerous opportunities also exist to create or maintain tropical hardwood <b>hammocks</b> within the developed landscape.|$|R

5|$|Several walking {{trails in}} the park vary in hiking {{difficulty}} on Pine Island, where visitors can cross hardwood hammocks, pinelands, and freshwater sloughs. Starting at the Royal Palm Visitor Center, the Anhinga Trail is a half-mile self-guided tour through a sawgrass marsh where visitors can see alligators, marsh and wading birds, turtles, and bromeliads. Its proximity to Homestead and its accessibility make {{it one of the}} most visited sites {{in the park}}. The nearby Gumbo Limbo Trail is also self-guided, at half a mile long. It loops through a canopy of hardwood hammocks that include gumbo limbo, royal palms (Roystonea), strangler figs (Ficus aurea), and a variety of epiphytes. Twenty eight miles (45km) of trails start near the Long Pine Key campgrounds and wind through Long Pine Key, well-suited for offroad cycling through the pine rocklands in the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Wilderness Area. Two boardwalks allow visitors to walk through a cypress forest at Pa-Hay-O-Kee, which also features a two-story overlook, and another at Mahogany <b>Hammock</b> (referring to Swietenia mahagoni) that takes hikers through a dense forest in the middle of a freshwater marl prairie. Closer to Flamingo, more rugged trails take visitors through mangrove swamps, along Florida Bay. Christian Point Trail, Snake Bight Trail, Rowdy Bend Trail and Coastal Prairie Trail allow viewing of shorebirds and wading birds among the mangroves. Portions of the trails may be impassable depending on the time of year, because of mosquitoes and water levels. Ranger-led tours take place in the busier season only.|$|E
25|$|No {{data are}} {{available}} on minimal <b>hammock</b> size needed to support a viable population of tree snails. Suitable habitat would have to include an area large enough to provide for foraging and nesting requirements, {{as well as provide}} for the microclimate (air temperature and humidity) needed by the Orthalicus reses reses. Preferences for edge or interior <b>hammock</b> have been observed in Liguus populations on Lignumvitae Key. Age-class differences were seen where older individuals were found in the central mature <b>hammock,</b> while younger individuals were found more often along the edges of the <b>hammock.</b> Tuskes (1981) suggested this may be an adaptation of younger snails to move to the edge to escape competition from older snails. It is not known whether Orthalicus reses reses prefer interior or edge <b>hammock</b> areas. Recent surveys of snails in the Key Largo populations have shown higher numbers of snails {{along the edge of the}} <b>hammock</b> than in the interior, but this result may be affected by the differences in visibility during surveying.|$|E

50|$|Hydric <b>hammocks,</b> {{also known}} as low <b>hammocks,</b> wetland {{hardwood}} <b>hammocks,</b> or lowland oak <b>hammocks,</b> grow on soils that are poorly drained or that have high water tables, subject to occasional flooding. They are usually found on gentle slopes just above swamps, marshes or wet prairies. Hydric <b>hammocks</b> are found in scattered locations in Florida north of Lake Okeechobee, with concentrations along the upper St. Johns River, the Atlantic coast of northeastern Florida, and particularly along the Big Bend section of the Gulf Coast of Florida, from Aripeka to St. Marks.|$|R
50|$|Oak <b>hammocks</b> and domes grow {{as small}} patches on shallow {{depressions}} or slight hills. They consist of thick stands of evergreen oaks, and are distinct from their surrounding habitats, which are typically woodlands dominated by longleaf pine. Mesic <b>hammocks</b> grow on moist soils that are rarely flooded and {{are characterized by}} southern live oak. Xeric <b>hammocks</b> grow on old sand dunes that are very well drained and are characterized by sand live oak (Quercus geminata). Cabbage palm-live oak <b>hammocks,</b> or prairie <b>hammocks,</b> are a sub-type of mesic <b>hammocks</b> composed principally of live oak and cabbage palm trees.

40|$|In south Florida, {{tropical}} hardwood forests (<b>hammocks)</b> {{occur in}} Everglades tree islands and as more extensive forests in coastal settings {{in the nearby}} Florida Keys.

With improvement of tree island condition {{an important element in}} Everglades restoration efforts, we examined stand structure in 23 Keys <b>hammocks</b> and 69 Everglades tree islands. Based on Stand Density Index and tree diameter distributions, many Everglades <b>hammocks</b> were characterized by low stocking and under-representation in the smaller size classes. In contrast, most Keys forests had the dense canopies and open understories usually associated with old-growth hardwood <b>hammocks.</b> Subject to the same caveats that apply to off-site references elsewhere, structural information from mature Keys <b>hammocks</b> can be helpful in planning and implementing forest restoration in Everglades tree islands. In many of these islands, such restoration might involve supplementing tree stocking by planting native trees to produce more complete site utilization and a more open understory...|$|R

5000|$|It {{has been}} noted that rockland habitats, {{including}} tropical hardwood <b>hammocks,</b> contain a lower diversity and abundance of wildlife than similar habitats to the north (Robertson and Kushlan 1984). An analysis of habitats in the Big Cypress (Duever et al. 1979) showed <b>hammocks</b> to be [...] "surprisingly unimportant to animals." [...] They point out that while <b>hammocks</b> are refuges for a very diverse flora, the factors which influence this biodiversity may reduce the potential diversity of wildlife. Factors which may limit faunal diversity of <b>hammocks</b> include their small size and common proximity to deep water areas which reduce frequency of wildfires. Other factors which are believed {{to contribute to the}} depauperate fauna of tropical hardwood <b>hammocks</b> include habitat disturbance by humans and the [...] "peninsula effect" [...] (Snyder et al. 1990). <b>Hammocks</b> are, however, noted to be critical habitat to many species during flood conditions (Duever et al. 1979).|$|R
