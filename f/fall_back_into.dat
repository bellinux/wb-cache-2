5|$|After {{capturing}} the crater, Cherry pushed {{on through the}} village, where his party emerged from among the buildings on the far side. Another stiff fight ensured {{with a group of}} Germans in dug-outs {{by the side of the}} road, before the company was able to meet up with its fellow units which had bypassed the village and were already established to the north and east of the area. Cherry's orders were to <b>fall</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> reserve, but he disregarded them as he sensed a counter-attack was forthcoming. At 09:00 on 27 March, the Germans launched a very strong counter-attack under heavy artillery fire. At one point, Cherry noticed that the Germans were firing yellow flares to pinpoint Australian positions to their gunners. He found some of these flares, and fired them away from his position. The German attempts to retake Lagnicourt—at a cost to the 7th Brigade of 377 casualties—raged all day before they abandoned the counterattack.|$|E

Rebirth in the pure land of Amitabha {{is seen as an}} assurance of Buddhahood, for once reborn there, beings do not <b>fall</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> cyclical existence unless they choose to do so to save other beings, the goal of Buddhism being the obtainment of enlightenment and freeing oneself and others from the birth–death cycle.|$|E

25|$|The novel {{appears in}} the {{computer}} game Deus Ex as a reference when a corporation in the game allegedly tries to develop the Second Men in the series, but also in a much broader aspect as the game deals with genetic engineering, {{the next phase of}} evolution and human augmentations. Also similar to the book are the options presented to the player as to where human kind will go next: a <b>fall</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> an almost savage state of humanity, a keeping of the status quo or an extreme progression with the danger of sacrificing basic rights.|$|E
25|$|The Ganges is {{a sacred}} river to Hindus along every {{fragment}} of its length. All along its course, Hindus bathe in its waters, paying homage to their ancestors and to their gods by cupping the water in their hands, lifting it and letting it <b>fall</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the river; they offer flowers and rose petals and float shallow clay dishes filled with oil and lit with wicks (diyas). On the journey back home from the Ganges, they carry small quantities of river water with them for use in rituals (Ganga jal, literally water of the Ganges).|$|E
25|$|The battle lasted {{less than}} 45 minutes, but its {{intensity}} led to heavy casualties on both sides. As dawn broke, Harvey ordered the outnumbered British to <b>fall</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> {{the woods in}} order to hide their small numbers. They succeeded in carrying away two of the captured guns, and spiked two more, leaving {{them on the ground}} owing to their inability to move them. They later watched from a distance as the Americans returned to their camp after daybreak, burned their provisions and tents and retreated toward Forty Mile Creek (present day Grimsby, Ontario). By afternoon on 6 June, the British occupied the former site of the American camp.|$|E

25|$|They did <b>fall</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the Third Division in 1988, but {{new manager}} Dave Bassett masterminded a quick revival which {{launched}} the Blades towards {{one of the}} most successful eras in their history. Successive promotions in the aftermath of the 1988 relegation saw them return to the First Division in 1990 after a 14-year exile. They survived at this level for four seasons (being founder members of the new FA Premier League in 1992 after peaking with a ninth-place finish in the last season of the old First Division) and reached an FA Cup semi-final in the 1992–93 season before being relegated in 1994.|$|E
25|$|Flies {{searching for}} an {{egg-laying}} site are attracted by fecal odors coming from the vent pipe, but they are prevented from entering by the flyscreen at the outlet of the vent pipe. Some flies may enter into the pit via the squat hole and lay their eggs there. When new adult flies emerge, they instinctively fly towards light. However, if the latrine is dark inside, the only light they can see {{is at the top}} of the vent pipe. Since the vent pipe is covered by a fly screen at the top, flies will not be able to escape and eventually will die and <b>fall</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the pit.|$|E
25|$|The {{direct cause}} of the {{accident}} is presumed to be {{the collapse of the}} vertical stabilizer. There are two alternative explanations for how the crash may have happened. The first explanation is that the lack of vertical control caused by the broken elevator torque tube stalled the aircraft. Be{{cause of the}} lack of pitch control, {{it would have been easy}} for the aircraft to <b>fall</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> a stall repeatedly, each time losing altitude. The aircraft would thus eventually have fallen into the sea. The vertical fin and rudder would have broken off on impact. This theory does not explain why the vertical stabilizer was found at such a distance from the aircraft.|$|E

25|$|A {{check of}} the pet's gums and skin can {{indicate}} dehydration; gums become tacky and dry and skin does not snap back quickly when pinched if dehydration is present. When the skin at the back is lifted, a dehydrated animal's does not <b>fall</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> place quickly. Serious dehydration (loss of 10ndash&12% of body fluids) means the pulled up skin stays there and does not go back into place. At this point, the animal may go into shock; dehydration of 12% or more is an immediate medical emergency. Hypovolemic shock is a life-threatening medical condition in which the heart is unable to pump sufficient blood to the body, due to loss of fluids.|$|E
25|$|Capturing {{them would}} deal a deathblow to the Egyptian's {{strategic}} {{operation in the}} entire Peninsula. The capture of these four objectives were hoped to be {{the means by which}} the entire Egyptian Army would rout and <b>fall</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> Egypt proper, which British and French forces would then be able to push up against an Israeli advance, and crush in a decisive encounter. On 24 October, Dayan ordered a partial mobilization. When this led to a state of confusion, Dayan ordered full mobilization, and chose to take the risk that he might alert the Egyptians. As {{part of an effort to}} maintain surprise, Dayan ordered Israeli troops that were to go to the Sinai to be ostentatiously concentrated near the border with Jordan first, which was intended to fool the Egyptians into thinking that it was Jordan that the main Israeli blow was to fall on.|$|E
25|$|On 16 December 2011, it was {{revealed}} that Feyenoord had been placed in the more favorable second category (Categorie 2). Meaning that Feyenoord were no longer in debt according to the KNVB. They have earned this by the transfer of significant players and a large capital injection made by the organisation VVF (Friends of Feyenoord, Vrienden Van Feyenoord). However to stay in the second category, Feyenoord needed to obtain the same amount of points earned rounding up to or higher than 65 points. On 13 April 2012 Feyenoord was officially out of what has been described as the 'financial dangerzone' and was officially placed in the second Category. According to chairman of the club Eric Gudde the placing in the more favourable category came earlier than anticipated, he also congratulated the fans and promised to maintain the same policy until Feyenoord was completely healthy again and will never <b>fall</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the 1st Category.|$|E

25|$|According to the transtheoretical {{model of}} {{behavior}} change, {{also known as}} the stages of change model, states that there are five stages towards behavior change. The five stages, between which individuals may transition before achieving complete change, are precontemplation, contemplation, preparation for action, action, and maintenance. At the precontemplation stage, an individual {{may or may not be}} aware of a problem but has no thought of changing their behavior. From precontemplation to contemplation, the individual begins thinking about changing a certain behavior. During preparation, the individual begins his plans for change, and during the action stage the individual begins to exhibit new behavior consistently. An individual finally enters the maintenance stage once they exhibit the new behavior consistently for over six months. A problem faced with the stages of change model is that it is very easy for a person to enter the maintenance stage and then <b>fall</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> earlier stages. Factors that contribute to this decline include external factors such as weather or seasonal changes, and/or personal issues a person is dealing with.|$|E
25|$|Rosecrans {{launched}} the Chickamauga Campaign in late August, staging demonstrations near Chattanooga and upstream {{of the city}} along the Tennessee River. This convinced Bragg that Rosecrans was crossing the river to the north; however, Union forces were actually crossing {{to the south of}} the city. This forced Bragg to <b>fall</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> northern Georgia, abandoning the important railroad hub of Chattanooga on September 8. Over {{the course of the next}} several days, Bragg attempted to launch several attacks on isolated parts of the Union army but each attempt failed. On the evening of September 18, Bragg concentrated the army near Chickamauga Creek; he thought that only part of the Union army was nearby but Rosecrans had concentrated his army faster than Bragg had expected. During September 19 at Chickamauga, both sides fed in reinforcements as the day progressed. Longstreet arrived on the battlefield during the night of the 19 and 20; Bragg divided the army into two wings, with Polk commanding one division of his corps along with Hill's and Walker's corps on the right, and Longstreet commanding the other division of Polk's corps with Buckner's corps and his own corps (commanded by John B. Hood), on the left. Polk was ordered to attack at daylight on September 20, with Longstreet attacking immediately afterwards, but Polk didn't launch his attack until midmorning. The left wing failed to dislodge the Union army but Longstreet's wing attacked a gap in the Union army which routed the Union right flank. A portion of the Union army rallied on Horseshoe Ridge and held off multiple Confederate attacks until evening, when it followed the rest of Rosecrans' army into Chattanooga.|$|E
