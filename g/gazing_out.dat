5|$|The {{video is}} shot in {{black-and-white}} and {{is set in}} a dimly lit and smoky office, where Beyoncé puts on a private show for a detective (played by actor Brett G. Smith). As the clip begins, the detective is <b>gazing</b> <b>out</b> the window. Beyoncé then arrives and stands in an open doorway while rain pours outside. With wavy hair and winged eyeliner, Beyoncé is dressed in a thigh-length leather trench coat and high stockings. After walking inside the office, she immediately strips off her coat. This reveals a satin dress over black panties and thigh-high pantyhose held up by garters. When the music starts, Beyoncé sits on a desk and plays with her hair, her back facing the face of the detective. The latter leans against his desk while watching Beyoncé, who starts to dance sensually on the desk and flips her hair to seduce him. As Beyoncé dances around the armchair, she exposes her vintage-style underwear.|$|E

25|$|It was not {{apparent}} from their records at first, but the Thompsons had embraced an esoteric Sufi strand of Islam in early 1974. I Want to See the Bright Lights Tonight was recorded before this conversion, but released some time afterwards. The songs {{for the second}} Richard and Linda album, Hokey Pokey, were similarly written some time ahead of the album's recording and eventual release. It was Pour Down Like Silver, with its cover photo of a turbaned Richard Thompson <b>gazing</b> <b>out</b> at the world, that tipped the public off to the Thompsons' growing preoccupation with their faith.|$|E
25|$|Macaulay {{was born}} at Rothley Temple in Leicestershire on 25 October 1800, the son of Zachary Macaulay, a Scottish Highlander, who became a colonial {{governor}} and abolitionist, and Selina Mills of Bristol, a former pupil of Hannah More. They named their first child after his uncle Thomas Babington, a Leicestershire landowner and politician, who had married Zachary's sister Jean. The young Macaulay was noted as a child prodigy; as a toddler, <b>gazing</b> <b>out</b> of the window from his cot at the chimneys of a local factory, he is reputed to have asked his father whether the smoke came from the fires of hell.|$|E
25|$|The {{character}} {{returns in}} the game's sequel, Mass Effect 3, released on March 6, 2012. He is first {{seen as a}} hologram on Mars when Shepard is retrieving data to stop the concurrent Reaper invasion of Earth. The Illusive Man tells Shepard his plan to control the Reapers and attempts to foil Shepard when Shepard resists. Over {{the course of the}} game, the Illusive Man commands Cerberus to attack the planet Sur'Kesh, homeworld of the salarians, to instigate a war between two allied races and {{to take control of the}} allied interspecies forces' base, the Citadel. He makes another appearance on the asari home planet, Thessia, where he again tries to convince Shepard that controlling the Reapers is the best solution. Shepard refuses and suggests that the Illusive Man is indoctrinated. In response, the Illusive Man commands the assassin Kai Leng to steal vital information necessary to combat the Reapers. Shepard tracks the VI to Cerberus's headquarters and discovers videos of the Illusive Man having himself implanted with Reaper technology and warning Kai Leng of Shepard. In these videos, the Illusive Man shows the Commander a great deal of respect. The Illusive Man makes his penultimate appearance at the headquarters. The Illusive Man appears at the Citadel in the endgame. Depending on prior in-game choices, players then decide whether to shoot him, or to convince him that he is indoctrinated, which makes him shoot himself. If the player shoots him he remarks how beautiful Earth is while <b>gazing</b> <b>out</b> through the Citadel arms, wishing Shepard could see it the same way, before succumbing to his wounds.|$|E

The commercial, entitled [...] "My World", depicts Lopez leaving Manhattan and {{making her way}} to The Bronx, her hometown. Lopez is seen {{behind the steering wheel}} of the car, <b>gazing</b> <b>out</b> at the scenery of The Bronx passing by. A voice-over says the words: [...] "Here, this is my world. This place inspires me to be tougher, to stay sharper, to think faster. They may be just streets to you but to me, they're a playground." ...|$|E
500|$|Of her {{research}} for Falls the Shadow, Penman explains: [...] "I {{did a great}} deal of on-site research, visiting the castles and battlefields that figured in Falls the Shadow, visiting the Reading Room at the British Library, the National Library of Wales in Aberystwyth, and local reference libraries… Here at home, I made use of the University of Pennsylvania Library in Philadelphia, which has an excellent medieval selection. But it really helped to see the scenes for myself. At Lewes, we actually walked along the same path that Simon de Montfort and his men would have followed. It was breathtaking to stand on the Downs, <b>gazing</b> <b>out</b> upon the same view that he would have seen".|$|E

2500|$|During {{the early}} 1920s his {{etchings}} began to receive public recognition. They expressed {{some of his}} later themes, as in Night on the El Train (couples in silence), Evening Wind (solitary female), and The Catboat (simple nautical scene). Two notable oil paintings of this time were New York Interior (1921) and New York Restaurant (1922). He also painted two of his many [...] "window" [...] paintings to come: Girl at Sewing Machine and Moonlight Interior, both of which show a figure (clothed or nude) near a window of an apartment viewed as <b>gazing</b> <b>out</b> or {{from the point of}} view from the outside looking in.|$|E
2500|$|The piano ballad [...] "The 2 of Us", {{according}} to Anderson, is about loneliness {{against the backdrop}} of wealth and fame; a professional couple incapable of relating to one another emotionally. It features Anderson's favourite lyrics on the album: the snow might fall and write the line on the silent page. A tap dancer was originally heard over the middle eight section. This was removed and replaced with a flute player. Echoing [...] "Sleeping Pills" [...] from Suede, [...] "The 2 of Us" [...] and [...] "Still Life" [...] are considered to be written from the viewpoint of a bored or lonely housewife. An early concept that was originally planned for Suede, [...] "Still Life" [...] features the 40-piece Sinfonia of London orchestra. The song is a tale of someone waiting for their lover to come home, <b>gazing</b> <b>out</b> the window. Anderson also agreed with Buller and Osman that the orchestral coda was over-the-top but defended it saying: [...] "it was conceived very much with the album's journey in mind and as such provided an eloquent end point." [...] Alexis Petridis called it a [...] "suitably overblown finale to an overblown album." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Wedding by Proxy of Marie de' Medici to King Henry IV (1622–25), Rubens {{depicts the}} proxy {{marriage}} ceremony of the Florentine princess Marie de' Medici to the King of France, [...] Henry IV [...] {{which took place}} in the cathedral of Florence on October 5, 1600. Cardinal Pietro Aldobrandini presides over the ritual. As was often the case with royal weddings, the bride's uncle, the Grand Duke Ferdinand of Tuscany stood in the King's place and is pictured here slipping a ring on his niece's finger. All the surrounding figures are identifiable, including the artist himself. Although he was present at the actual event twenty years earlier, {{as a member of the}} Gonzaga household during his travels in Italy, Rubens appears youthful and stands behind the bride, holding a cross and <b>gazing</b> <b>out</b> at the viewer. It is highly unlikely that Rubens actually had such a pronounced presence in this scene when it took place. Those who attended the ceremony for Marie include Grand Duchess Cristina of Tuscany and Marie's sister Eleonora, Duchess of Mantua; and in entourage of Grand Duke are Roger de Bellegarde, Grand Esquire of France, and the Marquis de Sillery, who negotiated the marriage. As in other scenes in the Medici Cycle, Rubens includes a mythological element: the ancient god of marriage, Hymenaios [...] wearing a crown of roses, carries the bride's train in one hand and the nuptial torch in the other. The scene takes place below a marble statue, which depicts God the Father mourning over the dead body of Christ, alluding to the Pieta sculpture by Baccio Bandinelli (1493–1560).|$|E
