The trade was put on hold, pending a second opinion from other medical sources. On August 7, Abdur-Rahim was quoted saying: [...] "I don't feel <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> Net". He felt the knee was a non-issue, claiming that he never missed a game in his entire career because of the knee injury.

500|$|Beginning in April 2008, {{the media}} {{reported}} growing speculation that Chris Matthews, news commentator {{and host of}} MSNBC's Hardball with Chris Matthews, might run in the 2010 Democratic primary for the United States Senate Pennsylvania seat then occupied by the Republican Arlen Specter. In an interview with The New York Times Magazine, Matthews said that he believed Specter {{had been in the}} Senate for too long, but that running for Senate would mean giving up a career he loved. Mark Leibovich, author of the article, wrote, [...] "Matthews has been particularly obsessed with Pennsylvania of late, devoting hours on and off the air to the state's upcoming Democratic primary, staying in close contact with the state's party apparatus". Speculation was further fueled by Matthews' appearance on an April 14 episode of The Colbert Report. Host Stephen Colbert asked Matthews about the rumors and prodded him to make a public announcement, to which Matthews replied, [...] "Did you ever want to be something your whole life? ... When you grow up, some kids want to be a fireman. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> Senator. But I have to deal with these things as they come."

500|$|The {{actors who}} voiced the {{characters}} in the short later reprised their roles in The Simpsons series. Dan Castellaneta performed the voices of Homer Simpson, Grampa Simpson, and Krusty the Clown. Homer's voice sounds different in the shorts compared to most episodes of the half-hour show, as Castellaneta originally tried to impersonate Walter Matthau. Although he would retain this characteristic through the early episodes of the regular series, it was gradually dropped as Homer's personality evolved away from that of a stereotypical sitcom father. The producers of the show were in need of someone to do voiceovers, so rather than hire actors, they asked Castellaneta (who had already done some voice work) and Julie Kavner, both members of the Ullman Show cast, to do it. The kids still needed voices, and Nancy Cartwright, a journeyman voice actress, came in to audition. She recalled that [...] "I was already doing voicework for eight different shows at the time and thought this would just be another job. They originally wanted me for Lisa's voice, but I thought 'Nah, I don't want to be the boring middle child, <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> bratty 10-year old boy.' So as soon as I gave a demonstration, [...] hired me on the spot." [...] Some time later, Yeardley Smith, a 22-year-old B-movie actress whose most notable accomplishment to date was featuring in the notorious 1986 Stephen King film Maximum Overdrive, was brought in to do Lisa's voice. [...] The recording of the shorts was often primitive; according to Cartwright, the dialogue for the Ullman shorts was recorded on a portable tape deck in a makeshift studio, which consisted of the video engineer suite, above the bleachers on the Ullman show set. While most of the characters' personalities are similar to what they are in the series, Lisa is simply a clone of Bart and did not have a distinct personality until a few episodes into the regular series.|$|E

5000|$|Refn has cited viewing The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974) as {{inspiration}} for his filmmaking career: I {{grew up in}} a cinema family. My parents were brought up on the French New Wave. That <b>was</b> God <b>to</b> them, but <b>to</b> me it <b>was</b> the antichrist, and how better to rebel against your parents than by watching something your mother <b>is</b> going <b>to</b> hate, which <b>were</b> American horror movies. When I saw Texas Chain Saw Massacre, I realized: <b>I</b> don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a director, <b>I</b> don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a writer, <b>I</b> don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a producer, <b>I</b> don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a photographer, <b>I</b> don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an editor, <b>I</b> don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a sound man. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> all of them at once.

[...] Following the home video, Draper had the idea of making a mockumentary film about the band; she decided to introduce them as music icons like The Beatles. Filmed in mid-2004, the movie was originally independent, and Draper's brother, Tim, a venture capitalist, provided financial incentives for the shoot. In addition, Draper and Wolff's famous celebrity friendssuch as Uma Thurman, Julianne Moore, Cyndi Lauper, Tony Shalhoub, Arsenio Hall, and the ensemble cast from the ABC television drama Thirtysomething (the latter including Draper herself)are featured making cameo appearances.|$|E
