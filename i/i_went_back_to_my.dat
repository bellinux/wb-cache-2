2500|$|Morton Feldman's I Met Heine on the Rue Fürstemberg was {{inspired}} by a vision he had of the dead Heine as he walked through Heine's old neighborhood in Paris: [...] "One early morning in Paris I was walking along the small street on the Left Bank where Delacroix's studio is, just as {{it was more than a}} century ago. I'd read his journals, where he tells of Chopin, going for a drive, the poet Heine dropping in, a refugee from Germany. Nothing had changed in the street. And I saw Heine up at the corner, walking toward me. He almost reached me. I had this intense feeling for him, you know, the Jewish exile. I saw him. Then <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> place and wrote my work, I Met Heine on the Rue Fürstemberg." ...|$|E
2500|$|On July 11, 2017, the Detroit Police Department {{released}} the full report, photographs from Cornell's hotel room, and the 911 {{call from the}} MGM Grand Detroit from the night of Cornell's death. The call was made by an hotel employee at 12:56a.m., reporting [...] "a nonresponsive guest... inside of Room 1136". According to the report, Martin Kirsten, Cornell's bodyguard, was at the singer's hotel room at 11:30p.m. {{to help him with}} his computer, [...] "which was not working at that time." [...] It also says that Cornell's wife, Vicky, talked to her husband at 11:35p.m., and alarmed by what she heard, she phoned the bodyguard to ask him to check on her husband [...] "because he did not sound like he was OK." [...] A call from Cornell's wife at 12:15a.m. prompted his bodyguard to go to the singer's suite to check on him. Kirsten told police he was in his room watching TV when he {{received a phone call from}} Vicky. [...] "She sounded angry because he [...] wasn’t responding to his phone. She told me to go to the room and check on Chris. I came to the room and was unable to get (in) because of the interior latch. <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> room and called for hotel security to come and open the door. They refused, saying that it wasn’t my room, although I told them that he was my employer and that I had a key." ...|$|E

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Madame Bouvet's, to find Nick {{emerging}} from his toilet.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the balcony. On the way I {{got hold}} of Charlie.|$|R
60|$|Be {{it enough}} to say, that when <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Browndown, Lucilla <b>went</b> with me.|$|R
6000|$|... "I saw God. God was light, God was truth. And <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> life, and God was hidden. God {{seemed to}} call me. He called. I heard him, I sought him and I touched his hand. When <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> life I was {{presently}} lost in perplexity. I {{could not tell}} why God had called me nor what I had to do." ...|$|E
60|$|Thus was {{assurance}} made doubly sure, and <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> house hugging {{myself with}} rapture.|$|E
60|$|By the way, when <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> lodging on that eventful day, the miller's wife met {{me at the}} door.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the Public Library {{and into}} the {{newspaper}} room to think over this problem.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the office, the man {{following}} with groans of pain, and I {{turned up}} the lamp.|$|R
60|$|She {{closed the}} sitting-room door behind us. Followed by Mr. Bruff and Betteredge, <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Mr. Blake's room.|$|R
60|$|I {{was through}} it, when a sudden fantastic impulse came upon me, and <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> {{successful}} rival, who looked nervously at the electric push.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> {{room and}} rang up number 157. The voice which {{answered}} {{me was the}} voice of the woman who had denied me admission to the room.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{not used}} to any such work, sir. But you'll find me willing and strong--and honest. I would like to earn a little before <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> home." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{saw that}} it might be best to let the Gandhi motif slide. <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> where we had started.|$|R
60|$|As it was, <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> London {{the very}} next day, {{determined}} to renew my slight acquaintance with Reggie Nettlecraft.|$|R

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> room as Mariposilla {{began to}} dress. A {{few moments later}} I heard the outer door close gently, and knew that the Doña Maria and her child had gone.|$|E
60|$|So <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> stool, {{feeling very}} small and yet indignant, for how was it {{possible}} to be definite about ghosts, or to explain the exact facts of the Mameena myth which clung {{to me like a}} Wait-a-bit thorn.|$|E
6000|$|... "I know {{absolutely}} nothing about our soldiers. I {{was in the}} army at the fall of Montreal, but after that I was mustered out and <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> regular work on the farm, and to hunting and fishing." ...|$|E
60|$|And I couldn't get {{any more}} out of her. <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Florence and reported. She got pretty excited about it.|$|R

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the hotel. <b>I</b> {{enter his}} private office. I reveal no secret when I {{say that he}} is not cordial.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I stubborn? I stiff-necked? I {{ascribed}} all my poor success, under God's good providence, to Divine Astrology. Not {{to me the}} glory!

60|$|The populace passed on, then {{seemed to}} halt, {{and at last}} the shouts died down on the noontide air. <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> writing, and to wait until from my jailer, when next he should chance to appear, I might learn the meaning of that uproar.|$|E
60|$|Then {{we talked}} {{of the places}} and things that I more {{particularly}} desired to see and, well, {{the end of it}} was that <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> hotel in love with Natalie; and as she afterwards confessed, she went to bed in love with me.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the Pension Beaurepas, and when, an hour later, I left {{it with my}} luggage, {{the family}} had not returned.|$|R

6000|$|... "I had {{a glimpse}} of a large enclosure, with some big buildings. Perhaps I can look at them better as <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Boston." ...|$|R
6000|$|Having {{helped to}} lay his poor body on one side, <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> post. Sergeant Drooce looked at me, with his eyebrows a little lifted. I nodded.

60|$|This {{encounter}} plunged me {{into deep}} discouragement and <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> {{reading in the}} library with a despairing resolution to improve every moment, for my stay in the east could not last many weeks. At the rate my money was going May would see me bankrupt.|$|E
60|$|I {{leave these}} fine discriminations to the theologian.
