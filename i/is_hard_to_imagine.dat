In the oral culture at this time, people paid great attention to memorizing pre-Islamic Arabic poetry, it <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> that they did not pay similar attention to the preservation of the Book of the Almighty, especially since they believed they would be rewarded in the hereafter for memorizing it.

500|$|Greeley {{attended}} the convention {{as a substitute}} for a delegate from Oregon who was unable to attend. In Chicago, he promoted Bates but deemed his cause hopeless and felt that Seward would be nominated. In conversations with other delegates, he predicted that, if nominated, Seward could not carry crucial battleground states such as Pennsylvania. Greeley's estrangement from Seward was not widely known, giving the editor more credibility. Greeley (and Seward) biographer Glyndon G. Van Deusen noted that it is uncertain how great a part Greeley played in Seward's defeat by Lincoln—he had little success gaining delegates for Bates. [...] On the first two ballots, Seward led Lincoln, but on the second only by a small margin. [...] After the third ballot, on which Lincoln was nominated, Greeley was seen among the Oregon delegation, a broad smile on his face. According to Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Doris Kearns Goodwin, [...] "it <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> Lincoln letting Greeley's resentment smolder for years as Seward did".|$|E

500|$|Delius later {{liked to}} {{represent}} his house at Solano Grove as [...] "a shanty", {{but it was}} a substantial cottage of four rooms, with plenty of space for Delius to entertain guests. Ward sometimes stayed there, as did an old Bradford friend, Charles Douglas, and Delius's brother Ernest. Protected from excessive summer heat by river breezes and a canopy of oak trees, the house was an agreeable place to live in. Delius paid little attention to the business of growing oranges, and continued to pursue his musical interests. Jacksonville had a rich, though to a European, unorthodox musical life. Randel notes that in local hotels, the African-American waiters doubled as singers, with daily vocal concerts for patrons and passers-by, giving Delius his introduction to spirituals. Additionally, ship owners encouraged their deckhands to sing as they worked. [...] "Delius never forgot the singing as he heard it, day or night, carried sweet and clear across the water to his verandah at Solano Grove, whenever a steam-ship passed; it <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> conditions less conducive to cultivating oranges—or more conducive to composing." ...|$|E

Todd Martens of Los Angeles Times wrote that although <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> the song to be played in a car or a club, it's [...] "attention-grabbing stuff, standing in stark—emphasis on stark—contrast to much of the current pop landscape."

[...] The verdict of the Mozart scholar Alexander Hyatt King is that the concerto is [...] "not only the most sublime of the whole series but also one of the greatest pianoforte concertos ever composed". Arthur Hutchings's view is that [...] "whatever value we put upon any single movement from the Mozart concertos, we shall find no work greater as a concerto than this K. 491, for Mozart never wrote a work whose parts were so surely those of 'one stupendous whole'." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} outlets {{expressed}} disappointment at the penalty shoot-out, {{in particular the}} way that Martin Williams, who as a flanker who would not ordinarily take a kick at goal, had been to [...] "blame" [...] for Cardiff's loss. The Guardians Paul Rees expressed the opinion that asking forwards to take kicks at goal [...] "is demanding something not only unnatural but untried and it turned a rousing semi-final into a pantomime, an unnecessarily demeaning way of settling the issue." [...] Brendan Gallagher writing in The Daily Telegraph noted that {{only three or four}} players on a rugby team would kick the ball during a match in a meaningful way, and said it was [...] "ludicrous that a game should be decided by emphasising that particular skill". He also questioned what would have happened in the event the shoot-out continued and the game been decided between props Martin Castrogiovanni and Gethin Jenkins, both considered amongst the finest players in their position but never ordinarily being required to kick the ball at goal. Chris Hewett expressed similar views in The Independent, observing that Martyn Williams [...] "lost the game by failing to perform a task outside the skill-set of the majority of players" [...] and commenting that [...] "short of asking a cat to bark, it <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> anything more preposterous." ...|$|E
500|$|In October 1999, in {{the year}} {{following}} Tippett's death, A Child of Our Time received a belated New York Philharmonic premiere, at the Avery Fisher Hall. The New York Times reviewer, Paul Griffiths, expressed some astonishment {{that this was the}} orchestra's first attempt at the work. As part of the celebrations for the centenary of the composer's birth in January 2005, English National Opera staged a dramatised performance of the work, directed by Jonathan Kent—coincidentally, the first performance fell in the week of the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the death camps at Auschwitz. Anna Picard, writing in The Independent, recognised the work's sincerity but found the dramatisation of its pacifist message wholly inappropriate: [...] "Do we really need to see a dozen well-fed actors and singers stripped and led into a smoking pit {{in order to understand the}} Holocaust?" [...] Anthony Holden in The Observer was more positive, commenting that [...] "If you must stage a work intended for concert performance ... it <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> a more effective version than Kent's, shot through with heavy symbolism of which Tippett would surely have approved." [...] Nevertheless, Holden found the overall result [...] "super-solemn, lurching between the over-literalistic and the portentous". The 2005 Holocaust Days of Remembrance (1–8 May) were marked at the Kennedy Center in Washington DC by a special performance of A Child of Our time, in which the Washington Chorus was directed by Robert Shafer. The piece was performed at the BBC Proms 2016 on 23 July by the BBC National Orchestra and Chorus of Wales.|$|E

500|$|Upon Eraserhead release, Variety {{offered a}} {{negative}} review, calling it [...] "a sickening bad-taste exercise". The review expressed incredulity over the film's long gestation and described its finale as unwatchable. Comparing Eraserhead to Lynch's next film The Elephant Man, Tom Buckley of The New York Times felt {{that while the}} latter was a well-made film with an accomplished cast, the former was not. Buckley called Eraserhead [...] "murkily pretentious", and felt that the film's horror aspects stemmed solely from {{the appearance of the}} deformed child rather than from its script or performances. Writing in 1984, Lloyd Rose of The Atlantic felt that Eraserhead demonstrated that Lynch was [...] "one of the most unalloyed surrealists ever to work in the movies". Rose described the film as being intensely personal, finding that unlike previous surrealist films, such as Luis Buñuel's 1929 work Un Chien Andalou or 1930's L'Age d'Or, Lynch's imagery [...] "isn't reaching out to us from his films; we're sinking into them". In a 1993 review for the Chicago Tribune, Michael Wilmington described Eraserhead as unique, feeling that the film's [...] "intensity" [...] and [...] "nightmare clarity" [...] were a result of Lynch's attention to detail in its creation due to his involvement in so many roles during its production. In the 1995 essay Bad Ideas: The Art and Politics of Twin Peaks, critic Jonathan Rosenbaum felt that Eraserhead represented Lynch's best work. Rosenbaum felt that the director's artistic talent declined as his popularity grew, and contrasted the film with Wild at Heart—Lynch's most recent feature film at that time—saying [...] "even the most cursory comparison of Eraserhead with Wild at Heart reveals an artistic decline so precipitous that it <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> the same person making both films".|$|E

[...] GamePro writer Blake Snow referred to the library as being [...] "much celebrated". Damien McFerran of Retro Gamer praised Dreamcast's NAOMI arcade ports, opining [...] "The thrill of playing Crazy Taxi in the arcade knowing full well that a pixel-perfect conversion (and not some cut-down port) was set to arrive on the Dreamcast is an experience gamers are unlikely to witness again." [...] Nick Montfort and Mia Consalvo, writing in Loading...

But even when it comes to resisting commercialization, it is arguable that Dreamcast games came closer to expressing this attitude than any other console games have." [...] 1UP.com's Jeremy Parish favorably compared Sega's Dreamcast output, which included some of [...] "the most varied, creative, and fun [...] the company had ever produced", with its [...] "enervated" [...] status as a third-party.
