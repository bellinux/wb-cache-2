Research is ongoing to determine how counseling and psychotherapy can <b>help</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> have ovarian cancer during treatment.|$|E

500|$|Electric {{toothbrushes}} are {{a popular}} aid to oral hygiene. A user without disabilities, with proper training in manual brushing, {{and with good}} motivation, can achieve standards of oral hygiene at least as satisfactory as the best electric brushes, but untrained users rarely achieve anything of the kind. Not all electric toothbrushes are equally effective and even a good design needs to be used properly for best effect, but: [...] "Electric toothbrushes tend to <b>help</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> are not as good at cleaning teeth {{and as a result}} have had oral hygiene problems." [...] The most important advantage of electric toothbrushes is their ability to aid people with dexterity difficulties, such as those associated with rheumatoid arthritis.|$|E

The team hoped to use the trailer as a piece of [...] "artwork", stating influence from the Carousel trailer from Philips.

The actual game development team used the trailer to build up the mood and atmosphere for the game, and they designed quests which required players to <b>help</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> had lost their families.

500|$|In {{the wider}} countercultural {{context of the}} time, with disillusion {{increasingly}} rife with each post-Woodstock rock event, commentators viewed the concerts as, {{in the words of}} Rolling Stone, [...] "a brief incandescent revival of all that was best about the Sixties". Writing in 1981, NME critic Bob Woffinden likened it to a [...] "rediscovery of faith", adding: [...] "Harrison had put rock music back on course." [...] Among Harrison's biographers, Alan Clayson describes the 1971–72 period covering the concerts and their associated releases as [...] "the George Harrison Moment", while Gary Tillery has written: [...] "The Concert for Bangladesh sealed Harrison's stature as something more than just a major celebrity... He changed the perception of recording artists, making it clear they could be good world citizens too – willing to set aside their egos and paychecks in order to <b>help</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> were suffering." ...|$|E

500|$|During {{his initial}} audition, Johnston {{claimed that he}} was bullied and victimised {{from the age of}} six because of his singing. When asked how he dealt with the issue, he stated [...] "I carry on singing." [...] There were claims in the Daily Mail, a UK-based tabloid newspaper, that the programme's {{producers}} had deliberately overstated the extent of Johnston's bullying as a [...] "sob story", suggesting that sympathy rather than his singing got him many of the votes. However, in The Times, Johnston's success story was described as [...] "the stuff of fairytales", as he was successful despite having been raised in [...] "poverty". Johnston said he did not talk about being bullied because he was told to do so by producers, but [...] "because I believed it would <b>help</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> were going through what I had gone through be stronger". Johnston has subsequently visited schools and elsewhere to help other victims of bullying. He said [...] "I want to use my experience of bullies to help other kids".|$|E

2500|$|A common {{misconception}} is that speech-language pathology {{is restricted}} to adjusting a speaker's speech sound articulation to meet the expected normal pronunciation, such as helping English speaking individuals enunciate the traditionally difficult [...] "r".

They provide accommodation such as refuges, shelters, and half-way houses, and offer a range of supported services. The Commonwealth has assigned over $800 million between 2000 and 2005 for the continuation of SAAP. The current program, governed by the Supported Assistance Act 1994, specifies that [...] "the overall aim of SAAP is to provide transitional supported accommodation and related support services, in order to <b>help</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> are homeless to achieve the maximum possible degree of self-reliance and independence. This legislation has been established to help the homeless people of the nation and help rebuild the lives of those in need. The cooperation of the states also helps enhance the meaning of the legislation and demonstrates their desire to improve the nation as best they can. In 2011, the Specialist Homelessness Services (SHS) program replaced the SAAP program.|$|E
