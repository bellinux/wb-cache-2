5|$|As <b>in</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> UK, Leeds' {{housing stock}} {{had fallen into}} {{disrepair}} {{by the middle of}} the 20th century. The city was overcrowded, and the Victorian terraces were unsuitable for modern inhabitation. Leeds had one of the most Labour orientated councils and in the 1930s pledged to replace 30,000 slums.|$|E

5|$|After {{the film}} was {{released}} on April 6, 2007, ticket sales performed significantly below box office analysts' expectations despite mostly positive critic reviews. <b>In</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rest of the world, each feature was released separately in extended versions. Two soundtracks were also released for the features and include music and audio snippets from the film. The feature later found more success on DVD and Blu-ray. In several interviews, despite the box office failure, the directors have expressed their interest in a possible sequel to the film due to its critical acclaim and successful home media sales. Three spin-off films were later made, based on Grindhouses fake trailers: Machete, Machete Kills and Hobo with a Shotgun.|$|E

5|$|Although both colour morphs occur <b>in</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> European range, brown birds predominate in {{the more}} humid climate of western Europe, with the grey phase {{becoming}} more common further east; in the northernmost regions, all the owls are a cold-grey colour. Siberian and Central Asian subspecies have grey and white plumage, the North African race is dark grey-brown, and South and East Asian birds have barred, not striped, underparts, and fine lines around the facial disc. The Siberian and Scandinavian subspecies are 12% larger and 40% heavier, and have 13% longer wings than western European birds, in accordance with Bergmann's rule which predicts that northern forms will typically be bigger than their southern counterparts.|$|E
5|$|Although {{poliovirus}} transmission {{has been}} interrupted <b>in</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world, transmission of wild poliovirus does continue and creates an ongoing {{risk for the}} importation of wild poliovirus into previously polio-free regions. If importations of poliovirus occur, outbreaks of poliomyelitis may develop, especially in areas with low vaccination coverage and poor sanitation. As a result, high levels of vaccination coverage must be maintained. In November 2013, the World Health Organization announced a polio outbreak in Syria. In response, the Armenian government put out a notice asking Syrian Armenians under age 15 to get the polio vaccine. As of 2014, polio virus has spread out to ten countries mainly in Africa, Asia and the Middle East with Pakistan, Syria and Cameroon advising vaccinations to outbound travelers.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1926, Meyer {{had written to}} Irène Joliot-Curie {{suggesting}} that Rona work with her to learn how his laboratory could make their own polonium samples. Once Hans Pettersson was able to secure funds to pay Rona's expenses, Joliot-Curie allowed her to come and study polonium separation at the Curie Institute in Paris. Rona developed an enhanced method of preparing polonium sources and producing alpha-emissions.(α-emission). Gaining recognition as {{an expert in the}} field, she took those skills back to the Radium Institute along with a small disc of polonium. This disc allowed Rona to create lab specimens of polonium, which were used <b>in</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Institute's subsequent research.|$|E

5|$|Brachiopod fossils {{have been}} useful {{indicators}} of climate changes during the Paleozoic era. When global temperatures were low, as <b>in</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ordovician, the large difference in temperature between equator and poles created different collections of fossils at different latitudes. On the other hand, warmer periods, such {{much of the}} Silurian, created smaller difference in temperatures, and all seas at the low to middle latitudes were colonized by the same few brachiopod species.|$|E
5|$|By 1500, the Arikara (or Ree) {{had settled}} <b>in</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Missouri River valley. European {{contact with the}} area began in 1743, when the LaVérendrye {{brothers}} explored the region. The LaVérendrye group buried a plate {{near the site of}} modern-day Pierre, claiming the region for France as part of greater Louisiana. in 1762 the entire region became part of the Spanish Louisiana until 1802. By the early 19th century, the Sioux had largely replaced the Arikara as the dominant group in the area.|$|E
5|$|By 1879, English law {{began to}} {{distinguish}} between suicide and homicide, although suicide still resulted in forfeiture of estate. In 1882, the deceased were permitted daylight burial in England and {{by the middle of}} the 20th century, suicide had become legal <b>in</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> western world. The term suicide first emerged shortly before 1700 to replace expressions on self-death which were often characterized as a form of self-murder in the West.|$|E

5|$|Cassel (from Flemish; Kassel {{in modern}} Dutch spelling) is a commune in the Nord départment in {{northern}} France. Built on a prominent hill overlooking French Flanders, {{the town has}} existed since Roman times. It {{was developed by the}} Romans into an important urban centre and was the focus of a network of roads, which are still in use today, that converge on the hill. After the fall of the Roman Empire, Cassel became an important fortified stronghold for the rulers of Flanders which was repeatedly fought over before finally being annexed to France in the 17th century. It was the headquarters of Marshal Ferdinand Foch during part of the First World War. In 1940, during the German invasion of France, Cassel was the scene of a fierce three-day battle between British and German forces which resulted <b>in</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> town being destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Females {{have the}} same plumage pattern as males, though with {{somewhat}} duller colouration. The female has a grey head; buff supercilium, chin, and throat; black and warm brown upperparts; and off-white underparts. The bill of the female is pale yellow with the tip and cutting edge of mandible dusky. Juveniles are dull grey with a brown back, a pale yellow supercilium, and a pale horn bill. Females and juveniles have hints of chestnut on their supercilium, shoulders, and throat, by which they may be distinguished from other sparrows, such as the Kenya sparrow and the other rufous sparrows, which are common <b>in</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chestnut sparrow's range; or the house sparrow, which also occurs in parts of its range.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> area {{bordering}} the wetlands, {{an abundance of}} produce, of great variety, can be cultivated. The green and varied landscape provides good grazing for livestock. In some areas the carboniferous limestone and the Dolomitic Conglomerate have been mineralised with lead and zinc ores. Evidence of early settlement comes from the Sweet Track, which was built from timber felled {{in the winter of}} 3807–06 BC, and lowland villages such as Glastonbury Lake Village and hill forts and ancient settlements on hills, many of which date from the Iron Age. From the time of the Romans until 1908, the Mendip Hills were an important source of lead.|$|E

5|$|Israeli {{historian}} Omer Bartov, {{writing for}} The New York Times Book Review, judged The Holocaust Industry to be marred {{by the same}} errors he denounces in those who exploit the Holocaust for profit or politics:It is filled with {{precisely the kind of}} shrill hyperbole that Finkelstein rightly deplores <b>in</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> current media hype over the Holocaust; it is brimming with the same indifference to historical facts, inner contradictions, strident politics and dubious contextualizations; and it oozes with the same smug sense of moral and intellectual superiority... Like any conspiracy theory, it contains several grains of truth; and like any such theory, it is both irrational and insidious.|$|E
5|$|Lactuca sativa is {{a member}} of the Lactuca (lettuce) genus and the Asteraceae (sunflower or aster) family. The species was first {{described}} in 1753 by Carl Linnaeus in the second volume of his Species Plantarum. Synonyms for L.sativa include Lactuca scariola var. sativa, L.scariola var. integrata and L.scariola var. integrifolia. L.scariola is itself a synonym for L.serriola, the common wild or prickly lettuce. L.sativa also has many identified taxonomic groups, subspecies and varieties, which delineate the various cultivar groups of domesticated lettuce. Lettuce is closely related to several Lactuca species from southwest Asia; the closest relationship is to L.serriola, an aggressive weed common in temperate and subtropical zones <b>in</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world.|$|E
