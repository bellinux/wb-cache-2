25|$|During {{pregnancy}} in the human, hormones such as relaxin remodel this ligamentous capsule {{allowing the}} pelvic bones {{to be more}} flexible for delivery. The gap of the symphysis pubis, normally is 4–5mm but during pregnancy {{there will be an}} increase of at least 2–3mm, therefore, it is considered that a total width of up to 9mm between the two bones is normal for a pregnant woman. The symphysis pubis separates to some degree during childbirth. In some women this separation can become a diastasis of the symphysis pubis. The diastasis could be the result of a rapid birth, or a <b>forceps</b> <b>delivery,</b> or may be a prenatal condition. A diastasis of the symphysis pubis is a cause of pelvic girdle pain (PGP). Overall, about 45% of all pregnant women and 25% of all women postpartum suffer from PGP.|$|E

50|$|Marie-Louise Lachapelle (1 January 1769 - 4 October 1821) was a French midwife, head of {{obstetrics}} at the Hôtel Dieu, the oldest hospital in Paris. She published textbooks about women’s bodies, gynecology and obstetrics. She argued against <b>forceps</b> <b>deliveries</b> and wrote Pratique des accouchements, long a standard obstetric text, which promoted natural deliveries.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{changes in}} the incidence of vaginal deliveries, cesarean sections, and <b>forceps</b> <b>deliveries</b> and their potential association with fetal, early neonatal, and perinatal mortality rates over time. METHODS: A retrospective study was carried out and the occurrence of deliveries supervised by university services between January 1991 and December 2000 was determined. Data regarding fetal, early neonatal, and perinatal deaths were assessed using obstetric and pediatric records and autopsy reports. RESULTS: Of a total of 33, 360 deliveries, the incidence of vaginal deliveries, cesarean sections, and <b>forceps</b> <b>deliveries</b> was relatively steady (around 60, 30, and 10 %, respectively) while, at the same time, there was a marked reduction in fetal mortality (from 33. 3 to 13. 0 ?), early neonatal mortality (from 30. 6 to 9. 0 ?), and perinatal mortality (from 56. 4 to 19. 3 ?). CONCLUSIONS: The marked reduction in perinatal mortality rates seen during the study period without an increase in cesarean sections indicates that the decrease in perinatal mortality was not impacted by cesarean section rates. The plausible hypothesis seems to be that the reduction in perinatal mortality of deliveries performed under the supervision of university services was more likely to be associated with better neonatal care rather than the mode of delivery...|$|R
500|$|Along {{with other}} factors, {{midwives}} and doctors use {{the extent of}} cervical dilation to assist decision making during childbirth. Generally, the active first stage of labour, when the uterine contractions become strong and regular, begins when the cervical dilation is more than [...] The second phase of labor begins when the cervix has dilated to , which is regarded as its fullest dilation, and is when active pushing and contractions push the baby along the birth canal leading {{to the birth of}} the baby. [...] The number of past vaginal deliveries is a strong factor in influencing how rapidly the cervix is able to dilate in labour. The time taken for the cervix to dilate and efface is one factor used in reporting systems such as the Bishop score, used to recommend whether interventions such as a <b>forceps</b> <b>delivery,</b> induction, or Caesarean section should be used in childbirth.|$|E
500|$|At {{a meeting}} of the American Gynecological Society in 1920, DeLee sparked {{controversy}} when he presented a paper advocating for the use of a systematic approach to childbirth for physicians, including the use of forceps and episiotomy even in women who had no labor complications. DeLee's [...] "prophylactic forceps operation" [...] consisted of several steps: scopolamine injections in the first stage of labor, ether anesthesia in the next stage, then episiotomy and <b>forceps</b> <b>delivery.</b> Ergot was used in the subsequent manual extraction of the placenta. DeLee reasoned that the episiotomy prevented perineal tears which could cause complications like uterine prolapse and vesicovaginal fistula. He said that the early use of forceps would avoid pressure from the pelvic bones against a baby's head, thus preventing complications like epilepsy and cerebral palsy; DeLee said that fatal complications occurred in 4–5% of labors managed with the traditional conservative approach. Though DeLee said that such interventions should only be carried out by a well-equipped physician specialist, John Whitridge Williams and other prominent obstetricians criticized DeLee sharply. They felt that DeLee was being too aggressive by removing a baby before complications occurred; DeLee's colleagues preferred to be conservative and to manage complications as they arose.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Neonatal intracerebellar bleeds {{are very}} rare and {{often seen in}} {{association}} with forceps or vaginal breech deliveries. Frequently the neonate requires surgical evacuation of the hemorrhage. These neonates are most often left with significant neurologic sequelae.

The delivery was facilitated {{by the use of}} low forceps for both infants. Twin B was diagnosed with a massive intracerebellar bleed on day 2 of life. She did not undergo surgical drainage due to an improvement in her clinical status. Follow-up examinations were completely normal, and the infant was developing normally at 2. 5 years of age.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{examine the}} rates of {{obstetrical}} complications and interventions among patients managed or comanaged by family physicians. DESIGN: Case series. Retrospective review of hospital records. SETTING: Victoria Hospital, a tertiary care centre affiliated with the University of Western Ontario in London, Ont. PARTICIPANTS: Five hundred forty-two women in labour admitted consecutively by family physicians from October 1, 1990, to September 31, 1991. There were no exclusions based on antenatal risk. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Degree of risk on admission, and rates of cesarean sections, inductions, epidurals, <b>forceps</b> <b>deliveries,</b> episiotomies, perineal tears, postpartum hemorrhages, and postpartum fever for mothers. For newborns, Apgar scores and rate of need for a pediatric critical care unit or special observation nursery.
