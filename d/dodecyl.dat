25|$|Proteins {{are usually}} {{analyzed}} by sodium <b>dodecyl</b> sulfate {{polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis}} (SDS-PAGE), by native gel electrophoresis, by preparative gel electrophoresis (QPNC-PAGE), or by 2-D electrophoresis.|$|E
25|$|Sodium lauryl sulfate, {{in science}} {{referred}} to as sodium <b>dodecyl</b> sulfate (SDS), is used in cleaning procedures, and is commonly used as a component for lysing cells during DNA extraction, and for denaturing proteins in preparation for electrophoresis in the SDS-PAGE technique.|$|E
25|$|In {{stubborn}} cases {{some doctors}} may recommend keratolytic (dandruff) shampoos (e.g. with sulfur, selenium, zinc pyrithione, or salicylic acid) while others warn {{against the use}} of medicated shampoos in newborns due to systemic absorption. Dandruff shampoos often contain sodium <b>dodecyl</b> sulfate, a noted skin irritant.|$|E
25|$|Sodium <b>dodecyl</b> sulfate, {{appearing}} as its synonym {{sodium lauryl sulfate}} (SLS), is considered as a {{generally recognized as safe}} (GRAS) ingredient, for food use according to the guidelines published in 21 CFR 172.822. It is used as an emulsifying agent and whipping aid. SLS is reported to temporarily diminish perception of sweetness.|$|E
25|$|The first {{proteins}} to be purified are water-soluble proteins. Purification of integral membrane proteins requires {{disruption of}} the cell membrane in order to isolate any one particular protein from others {{that are in the}} same membrane compartment. Sometimes a particular membrane fraction can be isolated first, such as isolating mitochondria from cells before purifying a protein located in a mitochondrial membrane. A detergent such as sodium <b>dodecyl</b> sulfate (SDS) can be used to dissolve cell membranes and keep membrane proteins in solution during purification; however, because SDS causes denaturation, milder detergents such as Triton X-100 or CHAPS can be used to retain the protein's native conformation during complete purification.|$|E
25|$|Proteins, unlike nucleic acids, {{can have}} varying charges and complex shapes, {{therefore}} {{they may not}} migrate into the polyacrylamide gel at similar rates, or at all, when placing a negative to positive EMF on the sample. Proteins therefore, are usually denatured {{in the presence of}} a detergent such as sodium <b>dodecyl</b> sulfate (SDS) that coats the proteins with a negative charge. Generally, the amount of SDS bound is relative to the size of the protein (usually 1.4g SDS per gram of protein), so that the resulting denatured proteins have an overall negative charge, and all the proteins have a similar charge-to-mass ratio. Since denatured proteins act like long rods instead of having a complex tertiary shape, the rate at which the resulting SDS coated proteins migrate in the gel is relative only to its size and not its charge or shape.|$|E
25|$|For the {{analysis}} of the functioning of proteins in a cell, the knowledge of their cooperation is essential. Most often proteins act together in complexes to be fully functional. The analysis of this sub organelle organisation of the cell requires techniques conserving the native state of the protein complexes. In native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (native PAGE), proteins remain in their native state and are separated in the electric field following their mass and the mass of their complexes respectively. To obtain a separation by size and not by net charge, as in IEF, an additional charge is transferred to the proteins by the use of Coomassie Brilliant Blue or lithium <b>dodecyl</b> sulfate. After completion of the first dimension the complexes are destroyed by applying the denaturing SDS-PAGE in the second dimension, where the proteins of which the complexes are composed of are separated by their mass.|$|E
25|$|Sodium <b>dodecyl</b> sulfate (SDS) (C12H25NaO4S; mW: 288.38) (only used in {{denaturing}} protein gels) is {{a strong}} detergent agent used to denature native proteins to individual polypeptides. This denaturation, which {{is referred to as}} reconstructive denaturation, is not accomplished by the total linearization of the protein, but instead, through a conformational change to a combination of random coil and α helix secondary structures. When a protein mixture is heated to 100°C in presence of SDS, the detergent wraps around the polypeptide backbone. It binds to polypeptides in a constant weight ratio of 1.4 g SDS/g of polypeptide. In this process, the intrinsic charges of polypeptides become negligible when compared to the negative charges contributed by SDS. Thus polypeptides after treatment become rod-like structures possessing a uniform charge density, that is same net negative charge per unit weight. The electrophoretic mobilities of these proteins is a linear function of the logarithms of their molecular weights. Without SDS, different proteins with similar molecular weights would migrate differently due to differences in mass-charge ratio, as each protein has an isoelectric point and molecular weight particular to its primary structure. This is known as native PAGE. Adding SDS solves this problem, as it binds to and unfolds the protein, giving a near uniform negative charge {{along the length of the}} polypeptide.|$|E
25|$|For nucleic acids, urea is {{the most}} {{commonly}} used denaturant. For proteins, sodium <b>dodecyl</b> sulfate (SDS) is an anionic detergent applied to protein samples to coat proteins in order to impart two negative charges (from every SDS molecule) to every two amino acids of the denatured protein. 2-Mercaptoethanol may also be used to disrupt the disulfide bonds found between the protein complexes, which helps further denature the protein. In most proteins, the binding of SDS to the polypeptide chain imparts an even distribution of charge per unit mass, thereby resulting in a fractionation by approximate size during electrophoresis. Proteins that have a greater hydrophobic content – for instance, many membrane proteins, and those that interact with surfactants in their native environment – are intrinsically harder to treat accurately using this method, due to the greater variability in the ratio of bound SDS. Procedurally, using both Native and SDS-PAGE together can be used to purify and to separate the various subunits of the protein. Native-PAGE keeps the oligomeric form intact and will show a band on the gel that is representative of the level of activity. SDS-PAGE will denature and separate the oligomeric form into its monomers, showing bands that are representative of their molecular weights. These bands can be used to assess the purity of and identify the protein.|$|E
2500|$|Sodium <b>dodecyl</b> sulfate, synonymously {{sodium lauryl sulfate}} (or laurilsulfate; SDS or SLS, respectively), is a {{synthetic}} organic compound with the formula CH3(CH2)11SO4Na. [...] It is an anionic surfactant used in many cleaning and hygiene products. The sodium salt is of an organosulfate class of organics. It consists of a 12-carbon tail attached to a sulfate group, that is, it is the sodium salt of <b>dodecyl</b> hydrogen sulfate, the ester of <b>dodecyl</b> alcohol and sulfuric acid. Its hydrocarbon tail combined with a polar [...] "headgroup" [...] give the compound amphiphilic properties and so make it useful as a detergent.

2500|$|Nucleic acids {{are often}} {{denatured}} by including urea in the buffer, while proteins are denatured using sodium <b>dodecyl</b> sulfate, usually {{as part of}} the SDS-PAGE process. [...] For full denaturation of proteins, it is also necessary to reduce the covalent disulfide bonds that stabilize their tertiary and quaternary structure, a method called reducing PAGE. Reducing conditions are usually maintained by the addition of beta-mercaptoethanol or dithiothreitol. For general analysis of protein samples, reducing PAGE is {{the most common form of}} protein electrophoresis.|$|E
2500|$|In {{order for}} neuroproteomics to {{function}} correctly, proteins must be separated {{in terms of}} the proteome from which they came. [...] For example, one set might be under normal conditions, while another might be under diseased conditions. [...] Proteins are commonly separated using two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D PAGE). [...] For this technique, proteins are run across an immobile gel with a pH gradient until they stop at the point where their net charge is neutral. [...] After separating by charge in one direction, sodium <b>dodecyl</b> sulfate is run in the other direction to separate the proteins by size. [...] A two-dimensional map is created using this technique {{that can be used to}} match additional proteins later.|$|E
2500|$|An {{analytical}} purification generally utilizes three {{properties to}} separate proteins. [...] First, proteins may be purified {{according to their}} isoelectric points by running them through a pH graded gel or an ion exchange column. [...] Second, proteins can be separated according to their size or molecular weight via size exclusion chromatography or by SDS-PAGE (sodium <b>dodecyl</b> sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) analysis. Proteins are often purified by using 2D-PAGE and are then analysed by peptide mass fingerprinting to establish the protein identity. This is very useful for scientific purposes and the detection limits for protein are nowadays very low and nanogram amounts of protein are sufficient for their analysis. Thirdly, proteins may be separated by polarity/hydrophobicity via high performance liquid chromatography or reversed-phase chromatography.|$|E
2500|$|By far {{the most}} common type of gel {{electrophoresis}} employs polyacrylamide gels and buffers loaded with sodium <b>dodecyl</b> sulfate (SDS). [...] SDS-PAGE (SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) maintains polypeptides in a denatured state once they have been treated with strong reducing agents to remove secondary and tertiary structure (e.g. disulfide bonds [...] to sulfhydryl groups [...] ) and thus allows separation of proteins by their molecular mass. [...] Sampled proteins become covered in the negatively charged SDS and move to the positively charged electrode through the acrylamide mesh of the gel. Smaller proteins migrate faster through this mesh, and the proteins are thus separated according to size (usually measured in kilodaltons, kDa). The concentration of acrylamide determines the resolution of the gel - the greater the acrylamide concentration, the better the resolution of lower molecular weight proteins. [...] The lower the acrylamide concentration, the better the resolution of higher molecular weight proteins. Proteins travel only in one dimension along the gel for most blots.|$|E
2500|$|Before {{separating}} the proteins by mass, {{they are treated}} with sodium <b>dodecyl</b> sulfate (SDS) along with other reagents (SDS-PAGE in 1-D). [...] This denatures the proteins (that is, it unfolds them into long, straight molecules) and binds a number of SDS molecules roughly proportional to the protein's length. [...] Because a protein's length (when unfolded) is roughly proportional to its mass, this is equivalent to saying that it attaches a number of SDS molecules roughly proportional to the protein's mass. [...] Since the SDS molecules are negatively charged, {{the result of this}} is that all of the proteins will have approximately the same mass-to-charge ratio as each other. [...] In addition, proteins will not migrate when they have no charge (a result of the isoelectric focusing step) therefore the coating of the protein in SDS (negatively charged) allows migration of the proteins in the second dimension (SDS-PAGE, it [...] is not compatible for use in the first dimension as it is charged and a nonionic or zwitterionic detergent needs to be used).|$|E
2500|$|Protein {{separate}} techniques, such as 2D PAGE, are limitd in {{that they}} cannot handle very high or low molecular weight protein species. [...] Alternative methods {{have been developed to}} deal with such cases. [...] These include liquid chromatography mass spectrometry along with sodium <b>dodecyl</b> sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, or liquid chromatography mass spectrometry run in multiple dimensions. [...] Compared to simple 2D page, liquid chromatography mass spectrometry can handle a larger range of protein species size, but it is limited in the amount of protein sample it handle at once. [...] Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry is also limited in its lack of a reference map from which to work with. [...] Complex algorithms are usually used to analyze the fringe results that occur after a procedure is run. [...] The unknown portions of the protein species are usually not analyzed in favor of familiar proteomes, however. [...] This fact reveals a fault with current technology; new techniques are needed to increase both the specificity and scope of proteome mapping.|$|E
