5|$|By 1999, {{computer}} systems and software had finally become sophisticated {{enough to allow}} for the ability to underlay on the same workstation satellite imagery, radar imagery, and model-derived fields such as atmospheric thickness and frontogenesis in combination with surface observations to make for the best possible surface analysis. In the United States, this development was achieved when Intergraph workstations were replaced by n-AWIPS workstations. By 2001, the various surface analyses done within the National Weather Service were combined into the Unified Surface Analysis, which is issued every six hours and combines the analyses of four different centers. Recent advances in both the fields of meteorology and geographic information systems <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> to devise finely tailored products that take us from the traditional weather map into an entirely new realm. Weather information can quickly be matched to relevant geographical detail. For instance, icing conditions can be mapped onto the road network. This will likely continue to lead to changes in the way surface analyses are created and displayed over the next several years.|$|E

25|$|Most of {{the victims}} were found on the second floor, where at least 69 bodies were recovered.

Twelve {{of the victims}} died leaping from windows in order to escape the flames, some of whom died of other injuries after being taken to area hospitals. Some workers who had been able to escape to the roof of the building were successfully rescued. The fire department's operations manager Mohammad Mahbub stated that the factory lacked the adequate emergency exits that would <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> to escape from the building, especially since the fire broke out in the warehouse on the ground floor and quickly moved up to higher floors. Of the building's three staircases, all three led through the ground floor, making them extremely dangerous and unusable {{in the case of a}} ground floor fire. This left many workers trapped and unable to get safely out of the course of the fire.|$|E

The hearing was held on May 6 with Weston appearing via teleconference from the Federal Medical Center, Butner with his public defender Jane Pierce and two witnesses he selected, a psychologist and vocational rehabilitation specialist. Federal judge Earl Britt denied Weston's request {{to be released from}} the federal facility, arguing that he failed to present enough evidence that he no longer needed to be committed. During the hearing defense psychologist Holly Rogers stated that, [...] "sometimes there are individuals who simply do not respond to medication", implying that Weston was not ready for release.

500|$|During the 16th and 17th centuries, {{the first}} plants were being {{imported}} to these major Western European gardens from Eastern Europe and nearby Asia (which provided many bulbs), and these {{found a place}} in the new gardens, where they could be conveniently studied by the plant experts of the day. For example, Asian introductions were described by Carolus Clusius (1526–1609), who was director, in turn, of the Botanical Garden of the University of Vienna and Hortus Botanicus Leiden. Many plants were being collected from the Near East, especially bulbous plants from Turkey. Clusius laid the foundations of Dutch tulip breeding and the bulb industry, and he helped create one of the earliest formal botanical gardens of Europe at Leyden where his detailed planting lists <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> to recreate this garden near its original site. The [...] of Leyden in 1601 was a perfect square divided into quarters for the four continents, but by 1720, though, it was a rambling system of beds, struggling to contain the novelties rushing in, and it became better known as the [...] His Exoticorum libri decem (1605) is an important survey of exotic plants and animals that is still consulted today. The inclusion of new plant introductions in botanic gardens meant their scientific role was now widening, as botany gradually asserted its independence from medicine.|$|E
