5000|$|<b>Decaborane</b> has no {{significant}} applications, although the compound {{has often been}} investigated. Since the molecule decomposes in a plasma, yielding monatomic boron ions, <b>decaborane</b> is potentially useful as a fuel for aneutronic fusion, and for low energy ion implantation of boron {{in the manufacture of}} semiconductors. It has also been considered for plasma-assisted chemical vapor deposition for the manufacture of boron-containing thin films. In fusion research, the neutron-absorbing nature of boron has led to the use of these thin boron-rich films to [...] "boronize" [...] the walls of the tokamak vacuum vessel to reduce recycling of particles and impurities into the plasma and improve overall performance.|$|E

5000|$|In <b>decaborane,</b> the B10 {{framework}} resembles {{an incomplete}} octadecahedron. Each boron has one [...] "radial" [...] hydride, and four boron atoms near the open {{part of the}} cluster feature extra hydrides. In the language of cluster chemistry, the structure is classified as [...] "nido".|$|E
50|$|<b>Decaborane,</b> {{also called}} decaborane(14), is the borane with the {{chemical}} formula B10H14. This white crystalline compound {{is one of}} the principal boron hydride clusters, both as a reference structure and as a precursor to other boron hydrides. It is toxic and volatile, with a chocolate-like odor.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{commonly}} synthesized via the pyrolysis of smaller boron hydride clusters. For example, pyrolysis of B2H6 or B5H9 gives <b>decaborane,</b> with loss of H2. [...] On a laboratory scale, sodium borohydride is treated with boron trifluoride to give NaB11H14, which is acidified to release borane and hydrogen gas.|$|E
50|$|Contemporaneously {{with the}} {{development}} of metal cluster compounds, numerous boron hydrides were discovered by Alfred Stock and his successors who popularized the use of vacuum-lines for the manipulation of these often volatile, air-sensitive materials. Clusters of boron are boranes such as pentaborane and <b>decaborane.</b> Composite clusters containing CH and BH vertices are carboranes.|$|E

50|$|The 1,2-closo-dicarbadodecaboranes (usually simply called carboranes), were {{reported}} simultaneously by groups at Olin Corporation and the Reaction Motors Division of Thiokol Chemical Corporation {{working under the}} U.S. Air Force and published in 1963. Heretofore, <b>decaborane</b> derivatives {{were thought to be}} thermally unstable and reactive with air and water. These groups demonstrated the unprecedented stability of the 1,2-closo-dodecaborane group, presented a general synthesis, described the transformation of substituents without destroying the carborane cluster, and demonstrated the ortho to meta isomerization.|$|E
50|$|The {{physical}} characteristics of decaborane(14) {{resemble those of}} naphthalene and anthracene, all three of which are volatile colorless solids. Sublimation is the common method of purification. <b>Decaborane</b> is highly flammable, but, like other boron hydrides, it burns with a bright green flame. It is not sensitive to moist air, although it hydrolyzes in boiling water, releasing hydrogen and giving a solution of boric acid. It is soluble in cold water {{as well as a}} variety of non-polar and moderately polar solvents.|$|E
50|$|UHTCs can be {{prepared}} from solution-based synthesis methods as well, although few substantial studies have been conducted. Solution-based methods allow for low temperature synthesis of ultrafine UHTC powders. Yan et al. have synthesized ZrB2 powders using the inorganic-organic precursors ZrOCl2•8H2O, boric acid and phenolic resin at 1500 °C. The synthesized powders exhibit 200 nm crystallite size and low oxygen content (~ 1.0 wt%). UHTC preparation from polymeric precursors has also been recently investigated. ZrO2 and HfO2 can be dispersed in boron carbide polymeric precursors prior to reaction. Heating the reaction mixture to 1500 °C results in the in situ generation of boron carbide and carbon, and the reduction of ZrO2 to ZrB2 soon follows. The polymer must be stable, processable, and contain boron and carbon {{in order to be}} useful for the reaction. Dinitrile polymers formed from the condensation of dinitrile with <b>decaborane</b> satisfy these criteria.|$|E
5000|$|In chemistry, boranes {{comprise}} {{a large group}} of the group 13 hydride compounds with the generic formula of BxHy. Due to the high affinity of boron for oxygen, these compounds do not occur in nature. Many of the boranes readily oxidise on contact with air, the lighter explode violently. The class is named after the parent chemical called [...] "borane" [...] itself, chemical formula BH3. This compound is only known to exist as a transient intermediate since it dimerises to form diborane, B2H6. The larger boranes all consist of boron clusters that are polyhedral. In addition to the charge-neutral boranes, a large number of anionic boron hydrides are known. The most important boranes are diborane B2H6 and two of its pyrolysis products, pentaborane B5H9 and <b>decaborane</b> B10H14. The development of the chemistry of boron hydrides led to new experimental techniques and theoretical concepts. Boron hydrides have been studied as potential fuels, for rockets and for automotive uses, but the only commercial applications involve derivatives of borane.|$|E
