40|$|Storing foods <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>freezer</b> is a {{great way}} to {{maintain}} their quality, freshness, and nutritional value. <b>The</b> recommended <b>freezer</b> temperature (0 degrees Fahrenheit) will keep food safe to eat indefinitely. Depending on the food, the color, flavor, and texture will eventually deteriorate. Be careful. Harmful bacteria are not killed by freezing temperatures and could begin to grow once the food is thawed. The Colder, <b>the</b> Better <b>Freezers</b> should be kept at a temperature of 0 degrees Fahrenheit or lower. There are a few extra things you can do in addition to turning down the dial to ensure a cold freezer. Keeping cool is all about air flow, so reduce the number of items <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>freezer</b> and add shelf space. This will allow the air to circulate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>freezer</b> more efficiently <b>for</b> a more thorough freeze. Keep foods away from the back vent.

Packaging Remember these three rules when wrapping <b>for</b> <b>freezer</b> storage: wrap tightly, wrap again, and wrap individual portions separately. Wrapping tightly and double wrapping help to maintain quality and prevent freezer burn. Wrapping individual portions separately lets you remove some of the food to prepare without thawing food that is not needed for your meal. Use only moisture- and vapor-proof materials for storing solid foods. Good choices are polyethylene bags, freezer film wraps, and aluminum foil over a layer of plastic film next to the food.

40|$|African Locust Bean (Parkia biglobosa) seeds {{known as}} ‘Iyere’ in Yoruba {{language}} were fermented aerobically and anaerobically at 40, 50, 60 and 70 °С {{for five days}} (120 hours) {{with the aid of}} two starter cultures - Bacillus Subtilis and Saccharomyces Cerevisiae to a vegetable protein based food condiment known as ‘Iru’. The Fermenter was fabricated with galvanized iron, thus getting rid of the unhygienic methods of producing it locally. Samples were taken every day (24 hours) and stored <b>in</b> <b>the</b> deep <b>freezer</b> <b>for</b> further analysis. Fermentation increased the percent protein content from 32 to 40 % and to 52 % for anaerobic and aerobic fermentation processes respectively after 3 days (72 hours). Other parameters like % crude fibre, % ash content and % carbohydrate in both aerobic and anaerobic fermentation processes decreased with number of fermentation days from 9. 58 to 5. 29, 4. 05 to 3. 30, 36 to 23 and 9. 58 to 3. 824, 4. 05 to 0. 832, 36 to 19. 89 respectively. The biological changes such as physiological (odour, colour and appearance) and sensory (taste and texture) were studied. From experimental data generated by the design of experiment (DOE), using MINITAB 17 software, optimum conditions were obtained at 40 ⁰C with inoculum (Bacillus subtilis) concentration of 0. 005 (g broth/g seed) at fermentation duration of 3. 25 days. The product of the fermentation process ‘Iru’ was analyzed physiologically and organoleptically. The products of anaerobic fermentation were not acceptable organoleptically due to their repulsive odour, although was mild at lower temperature. The organoleptic test showed that the sample fermented with Bacillus subtilis was generally acceptable for all parameters tested. The mineral compositions of the fermentation product at different temperatures were analyzed and Magnesium, Phosphorus, Potassium, Sodium, Manganese, Iron, Copper and Zinc were detected.

40|$|Fisheries and {{aquaculture}} {{are very}} important sectors <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Norwegian industry. Fish and its by-products are considered wholesome foodstuff and are popular especially due to their nutritional value. Therefore, consumer safety {{is a very important}} topic and methods for prolonging shelf-life play a vital role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fishing and aquaculture industries. These methods are mostly based on cooling and freezing techniques, as bacteriological and enzymatic activities are generally reduced at low temperatures. However, freezing and cooling are quite energy- and time-consuming. Freezers are often designed as batch-operations, especially on board fishing vessels, and thus act as bottlenecks <b>in</b> <b>the</b> production chain. Therefore, an optimal operation should be imposed in order to minimize the time the good is spending <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>freezer.</b> If a good is <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>freezer</b> longer than necessary, this operation can be denoted as overfreezing. Hence, the aim is to monitor and operate <b>the</b> freezing processes <b>in</b> an optimal way with respect to quality, but also with regards to energy use and environmental impact. This can be achieved by {{a better understanding of the}} factors that influence the quality of fish and seafood during freezing and thawing. Furthermore, comprehension of the actual processes that happen during phase change are of importance; this includes the derivation of a mathematical model to describe <b>the</b> temperature evolution <b>in</b> <b>the</b> food. This model can also be used to monitor and operate the reversed freezing process, namely thawing. Considering not only freezing but also the thawing process as an additional and often inevitable production step makes sense due to the fact that it is difficult to process frozen fish. The thesis is structured into five parts, which are divided thematically: Introduction and Preliminaries, Mathematical Modeling, Freezing and Thawing Applications, Experiments and Closing Remarks. Part I gives an introduction to the context of this thesis. The importance of the fishing industry for the Norwegian economy is highlighted. Furthermore, preliminaries about topics related to freezing and thawing of foodstuff in general, and fish and fish products in particular, are presented. These preliminaries include methods of industrial applicable and more theoretical nature. Furthermore, a Chapter is dedicated to the concise introduction to quality aspects of fish, in a general way, but also with respect to freezing and thawing applications and processes. In Part II, a mathematical model for freezing and thawing processes is derived from the diffusion equation, a partial differential equation (PDE). This model represents a form of a linear heat equation, which is extended by a nonlinear term. This nonlinear term enters the equation due to the fact that phase change occurs in both freezing and thawing, and therefore the parameters of the diffusion equation are modeled state- and thus temperaturedependent. Similarities between this model and other types of PDEs, <b>in</b> particular <b>the</b> Burgers’ equation and its potential form, are investigated. However, due to the statedependency of the coefficients, known transformations can not be applied in order to use already established stability results for this kind of heat equation. Therefore, the stability of the model is investigated. This is conducted in order to show that the model can be used for describing freezing and thawing applications, which are in fact known to be stable due to the laws of thermodynamics. Part III presents applications of <b>the</b> model derived <b>in</b> Part II for freezing and thawing processes, respectively. Firstly, an observer based on an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is developed for both, freezing in plate freezers and thawing in contact thawing devices. The aim is to estimate <b>the</b> temperatures <b>in</b> <b>the</b> inner domain of a block of foodstuff. Therefore, some assumptions have to be imposed, e. g. that temperatures on the surface of the block are measurable. Secondly, the models are subject to Optimal Control Problems (OCP), where an optimal input function, meaning the temperature at the boundaries, is calculated in order to either optimally freeze or thaw blocks of foodstuff. This is done for open loop Optimal Control (OOC), which holds for perfect knowledge of the process with no measurement and estimation disturbances. Furthermore, closed loop Model Predictive Control (MPC) is applied, where measurement / estimation errors as well as discrepancies between the model and the real process are taken into account. In Part IV experimental results for a freezing process in a horizontal plate freezer and a thawing process in a rebuilt horizontal plate <b>freezer</b> adapted <b>for</b> thawing purposes (plate thawer) are shown. Both of these experiments have been conducted at Matís Food Research <b>in</b> Reykjavík, Iceland. <b>The</b> freezing experiments were conducted with a rectangular tray made of aluminum, which was placed <b>in</b> between <b>the</b> plate <b>freezer</b> walls and filled with tap water. Temperature loggers were placed in several positions inside the tray to log the temperature during phase change from liquid to solid. Ammonia was used as <b>the</b> refrigerant <b>in</b> <b>the</b> plate <b>freezer.</b> <b>For</b> <b>the</b> thawing process the same tray was used. Blocks of frozen headed and gutted (H/G) cod were placed inside the tray and between the walls of <b>the</b> re-built plate <b>freezer.</b> <b>The</b> medium to thaw the fish blocks was tap water. Temperature loggers were attached to the fish blocks, namely <b>in</b> <b>the</b> center, half-way to the center and just below <b>the</b> surface. <b>In</b> Part V <b>the</b> thesis is closed with the conclusion and an outlook on future work...|$|R

40|$|As {{a result}} of {{laboratory}} tests were obtained values of the coefficient thermal conductivity (Keff) of new snow for different types of the solid precipitation: plates, needles, stellars, graupels. Snow samples were collected during a snowfall and placed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>freezer.</b> <b>For</b> all types of sediment thermal conductivity of snow is equal to 0. 03 – 0. 04 W/m·°C. Transformation of new snow occurs within 10 days at average temperature − 10 °C and the gradient temperature of 50 – 60 °C/m.  Under these conditions, the metamorphism leads to an increase the density of snow, size of grains and rounded snow particles.  At {{the beginning of the}} experiment, the thermal conductivity of snow is linearly increased in proportion to the density of the snow. However, after 3 – 5 days Keff stabilized at about 0. 08 – 0. 09 W/m·°C, although the density of the snow and size of grains continued to increase. This effect occurs with the appearance of faceted crystals and loosening of snow. In the future, while maintaining a negative temperature coefficient of thermal conductivity remained unchanged. Thus, the temperature gradient metamorphism affect to the thermal conductivity snow, which {{plays an important role in}} maintaining the thermal insulation properties of snow cover.

Other amides such as acetamide, nicotinamide and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide could not be deamidated by these extracts. Optimum deamidation of the two amino acids by the extracts was recorded at pH 6 of 0. 08 to 0. 16 M phosphate buffer and 60 °C. Exposure of the extracts to 60 °C for 20 min in absence of the substrate revealed about 70 % increase in each of the two activities. Fractionation of the extract proteins using DEAE Sephadex A- 25 column chromatography showed that the glutaminase and asparaginase activities were detected in the same protein fractions with the same peak and with almost constant ratios. The ratio of the glutaminase activity to that of the asparaginase was approximately 0. 7 to 1. 0. The activities of the pooled fractions towards L-glutamine and L-asparagine showed similar behaviors at different pH values and at different temperatures. Both activities exhibited hyperbolic substrate saturation kinetics and the apparent k m values were found to be 5. 05 and 2. 57 x 10 - 3 M for L-glutamine and L-asparagine, respectively.

Thirty-five animals weighing 0. 868 ± 0. 168 kg were distributed in a completely randomised design with five treatments (0. 0 - control; 11. 25, 22. 50, 33. 75 and 45 ppm of RAC) and seven replicates with two fillets obtained from the same animal. The diets were isocaloric and isoprotein and experimental time was 90 days. RAC did not affect (P> 0. 05) the initial pH or ph after 24 hours of the fillets. Compared to the control, RAC increased (P< 0. 05) the moisture content of the fillets in natura and lipid oxidation of samples stored for 12 days in the refrigerator or freezer for 60 days. The RAC in 11. 25 ppm reduced (P< 0. 05) the lipid content, while 45 ppm reduced (P< 0. 05) the crude protein in the fillets. Considering only RAC, there was a linear increase (P< 0. 05) in the lipid content (P< 0. 05) and a linear reduction in crude protein and weight loss after cooking the fillets. There was a quadratic effect (P< 0. 05) on the ash content, weight loss and lipid oxidation in fillets stored in the refrigerator or freezer. A RAC dose of 33. 75 ppm resulted in a lower lipid oxidation index. In conclusion, ractopamine at 11. 25 ppm is effective for reducing the fat content in fillets of pacu, although it increases the formation of peroxides in samples kept <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>freezer</b> <b>for</b> longer than 60 days.

Materials and Methods: In this experimental research, AFB 1 was separated from Aspergillus flavus (PTCC 5004) by HPLC and AGE prepared using the Mantis method. The Delayed-Type Hypersensitivity (DTH) test was carried out to determinate the effectiveness of different doses of AGE and AFB 1, which can both {{have an effect on the}} immune system. Subsequent experiments were carried out on 20 Balb/c mice to estimate the effects of AGE and AFB 1 on the number of Treg cell in 4 groups: 10 μl/kg/day of AFB 1 and AGE diluents were administered for 4 consecutive days to group 1.

Mice were sacrificed and splenocytes harvested and the percentage of splenic Treg cells was measured by flow cytometry analysis. The ELISA method was utilized to measure Cytokine production. Results: The findings reveal that AGE increased the level of IFN-γ and IL- 4 cytokines produced by splenocytes stimulated by specific tumor antigen and decreased the number of Treg cells in the spleen (p< 0. 05). AFB 1 increased the number Treg cells in the spleen and decreased cytokine production (p< 0. 05). In groups 2 (control) and 4 (AGE) the number of Treg cells decreased (p value< 0. 05) whereas in groups 1 and 3 the number of Treg cells increased (p< 0. 05). Conclusion: This study indicated that AGE is able to alter the cytokine production in normal mice into a Th 1 protective pattern which is beneficial to the immune system in general and anti-tumor immunity in particular. AFB 1 is able to alter the cytokine production into a Th 2 protective pattern. Therefore, AGE might be used as herbal medicine with few side effects as compared to chemotherapy in treating cancers caused by substances like AFB 1...|$|E
