He dispatched Timocrates of Rhodes, an Asiatic Greek, to distribute ten thousand gold darics in the major cities of the mainland and incite them to act against Sparta. Timocrates visited Athens, Thebes, Corinth, and Argos, and succeeded in persuading powerful factions <b>in</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> states to pursue an anti-Spartan policy.

However, they were relegated from the Third Division after just one season in 1959–60. York's best run in the League Cup came in 1961–62, the competition's second season, after reaching the fifth round. They were beaten 2–1 by divisional rivals Rochdale. York had to apply for re-election for the second time after finishing 22nd in 1963–64, but achieved a second promotion the next season, again in third place in the Fourth Division. York were again relegated after one season, finishing bottom of the Third Division in 1965–66. The club was forced to apply for re-election in three successive seasons, from 1966–67 to 1968–69, after finishing in the bottom four of the Fourth Division <b>in</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> season. York's record of earning promotion every six years was maintained in 1970–71, with a fourth-place finish in the Fourth Division.|$|E

Harry Redknapp has had six spells {{managing}} Premier League football clubs (West Ham United, Portsmouth, Southampton, Portsmouth again, Tottenham Hotspur and Queens Park Rangers) winning a Manager of the Month award <b>in</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> spells. Eight other managers have won an award with two or more clubs: Martin O'Neill with Leicester City, Aston Villa and Sunderland, Brendan Rodgers with Swansea City and Liverpool, Stuart Pearce with Nottingham Forest and Manchester City, Gordon Strachan with Coventry City and Southampton, Sam Allardyce with Bolton Wanderers and West Ham United, Mauricio Pochettino with Southampton and Tottenham Hotspur, Rafael Benítez with Liverpool and Chelsea and Claudio Ranieri with Leicester City and Chelsea.

5|$|Stockport {{remained}} in Division 2 of the Football League {{for seven years}} until 1912–13 when they again had to seek re-election. Stockport gained 22 votes and was therefore re-elected. Despite an unsuccessful 1920–21 campaign that saw Stockport end the season bottom of the Second Division, which would normally have seen them face re-election however, they {{were placed in the}} new Third Division North. After winning five of their first six matches; along with going unbeaten from New Years Day 1921 to Easter Weekend 1922; Stockport set the standard for the division and gained their first Football League title when they beat Darlington in front of 18,500 fans at Edgeley Park. Albert Williams (the then manager) was presented with the trophy seven days later before the home game with Lincoln City. This title win began a remarkable coincidence which has occurred in each of Stockport's title winning seasons where Lincoln City have been the last opponents <b>in</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> seasons.
