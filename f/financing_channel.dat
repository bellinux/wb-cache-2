40|$|Abstract: This paper {{studies the}} trade credit of Chinese corporations. Previous studies have {{presented}} various {{views on the}} utilization of trade credit. One study argued that nonstate- owned firms utilized more trade credit than state-owned firms. Meanwhile, another study suggested that non-state-owned firms depended on informal <b>financing</b> <b>channels</b> rather than on trade credit. What is the actual financing pattern of Chinese corporations? To answer this question，we employ a large database of Chinese corporations and conduct comparative analyses between two groups: state-owned firms and non-state-owned firms. Statistical investigations reveal two findings. First, our empirical results demonstrate a higher utilization of trade credit for state-owned firms in contrast to ap revious study. Second, we conclude that non-state-owned firms rely on informal <b>financing</b> <b>channels</b> due to asymmetric informatio...|$|R

30|$|Through {{analytical}} strategy, {{loans from}} the regular financial system and the private financial system can be classified into visible financing channels, that is, financing channels studied by economists that we can directly observe. Obviously, there is another invisible <b>financing</b> <b>channel</b> {{that can only be}} found in enterprises’ own capital supply chain, 2 which implies that entrepreneurs realize financing through controlling the capital circulation period in industrial chains as well as the scale of cash flow, making use of minimum expenses to stimulate the operation of the whole production chain. 3 In brief, it can be concluded that the scale of cash flow must be minimized and capital circulation speed be improved as much as possible. However, improving capital circulation speed is subject to fixed conditions such as labor intensity, technology, and logistics speed. It is difficult for SMEs to evolve under these situations unless they are making innovations in their technique. Comparably speaking, it is more manageable to minimize cash expenses. This is the invisible <b>financing</b> <b>channel</b> discussed earlier, which refers to the specific phenomenon of structured deferred repayment that occurs among enterprises on a large scale through production chains. In other words, it is cost allocation based on massive graduated debt that definitely motivates the lasting development of SMEs. Nevertheless, economics has not paid sufficient attention to this phenomenon and generally regards it simply as existing debt or deferred repayment.|$|E

In other words, in solving the problem of capital shortage, enterprises can first be in debt to the upstream and repay after the draining of capital. Distinguished from loaning, this <b>financing</b> <b>channel</b> has its own advantages with no need to pay interest. Therefore, in adjusting the capital settlement period with the upstream, the subcontractors adopt social time accepted by the community as a settlement period, which helps them acquire the largest potential for capital circulation and accumulation.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the interaction between}} firms' debt and equity market timing decisions in response to equity misvaluation, {{as well as how}} these timing decisions vary across firms with different external funding needs. We use price pressure resulting from mutual fund flow-induced trading to identify equity misvaluation. We find that when equity is overvalued, the least financially constrained firms issue equity and use the proceeds to retire debt, acting as pure arbitrageurs. In contrast, firms that are most financially constrained issue both overpriced equity and debt to increase investment. Our finding that equity market timing does not vary significantly with external funding needs, while debt market timing does, implies that the <b>financing</b> <b>channel</b> of equity mispricing impacting firm investment works primarily through debt issues...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to explore the}} determinants for small and medium enterprise (SME) performance.

Using a rich and up to date firm-level dataset, we find evidence that SMEs can improve performance by importing more foreign materials inputs and by utilizing foreign technologies from technologically advanced economies. This effect of technology spillover is particularly important for smaller enterprises in developing countries because in-house innovation is expensive. We further find that both informal finance sources and formal <b>finance</b> <b>channels</b> do not enhance the performance of smaller enterprises in financing daily operations and interestingly, informal channels hamper a firm's performance. There is no evidence for the effect of on-the-job training on firm performance.

When collateral constraints are binding, these firms reduce investment relative to the frictionless benchmark. In U.

30|$|However, in reality, SMEs {{have made}} {{significant}} progress {{even in the}} absence of a regular financial system, which impelled researchers to turn their focus to <b>financing</b> <b>channels</b> outside the regular financial system, such as underground private banks, civil bidding, and even exorbitant usury. Taking nongovernmental finance in Wenzhou as an example, there are nongovernmental loans, industrial loans, and civil bidding (Wang et al. 2004; Zhang 2000; Guo and Liu 2002). Whether through <b>financing</b> <b>channels</b> within or outside the regular financial system, SMEs had to pay certain rates for loans since all these financial services are offered for profit. Thus, the SMEs were under the double restriction of a shortage of regular capital supply channels and the high cost of irregular capital supply (Zhou 2007). The cost of regular capital supply was also considerable. With overcapacity in China’s economic sector and the rise of the RMB exchange rate, the profit rate of export-oriented enterprises decreased more and more. Influenced by changes in international marketing conditions, SMEs entrepreneurs who depend heavily on such <b>financing</b> <b>channels</b> tended to experience cracks in the capital supply chain. A large number of entrepreneurs have gone into hiding due to the pressure to repay loans. These SMEs have collapsed on a large scale due to the guarantee chain for the credit warranty system established by banks and massive mutual interenterprise debt. Thus, the causes for the capital shortage were first, that financing approaches were seriously limited and second, SMEs entrepreneurs intended to restrict the scale of financing in order to avoid risks. This raises the question of whether there are any other approaches to tackling the capital shortage problem that emerged in the course of SME operations as market subjects.|$|R
