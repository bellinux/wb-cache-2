40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{mechanical}} behaviour of progressively damaged laminated glass (LG) beams made with ionoplast interlayers. After {{the failure of}} one or more <b>glass</b> <b>plies,</b> the load-bearing capacity of LG beams depends on the capacity of the interlayer to provide coupling effect between broken and undamaged <b>glass</b> <b>plies</b> via adhesion and its own mechanical properties. Dynamic and static tests have been carried out on undamaged and progressively damaged LG beams. The comparison of experimental data with theoretical values obtained neglecting broken plies highlight that ionoplast interlayers assure the transmission of significant shear stresses between broken and unbroken <b>plies,</b> and <b>glass</b> fragments provide a ‘‘tension stiffening” effect to the interlayer. Further tests have been carried out on fully damaged LG beams to evaluate their residual load bearing capacity at the time of glass failure and after a five-month interval to assess effects of aging on the bond between ionoplast interlayers and glass fragments...|$|R

40|$|Dynamic {{behaviors}} of a laminated glass subjected to foreign object impact are studied {{by the use}} of the developed finite element program. A finite element simulation based on a higher-order beam finite element and a PVB interlayer model is applied to compute the dynamic responses of laminated glass panel. In this analysis, the glass plies and PVB interlayer are modeled as linear elastic. The results such as the histories of contact force and deflection, and the distribution for strains, stresses through the beam thickness during impact are obtained. The impact {{behaviors of}} laminated glass panel are compared with those of the monolithic glass of the same total thickness. It shows that PVB interlayer can be prevented inner <b>glass</b> <b>ply</b> of LG beam from damage by reducing the stress to zero.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} glass used in {{buildings}} and presents a criterion for fail-safe optimal design of glass plates. First, the paper {{shows that the}} glass plate is fail-safe only if the load-bearing system is composed of two glass layers bonded to one another with an elastomeric interlayer (Laminated Glass), and if the live loads act upon a sacrificial <b>glass</b> <b>ply</b> (tri-layer system). Then, activity was directed at analyzing the simply-supported fail-safe glass plate loaded out-of-plane, and carrying out research targeted at reducing the incidence of weight and cost (optimal design). The results, obtained using an analytical exact model, show that the limit states are always dictated by the maximum deflection and not by the load-carrying capacity. Thus, optimal design requires finding {{the thickness of the}} glass layers and the stiffness of the interlayer that provide the plate with exactly the minimum allowable stiffness, while the stress verifications are fulfilled automatically. Finally, for every span and load that is found in building applications of glass, the paper provides the thicknesses and the materials of the glass layers and interlayers that adjust capacity to match demand. These results may also replace structural analysis and assessment of Laminated Glass plates...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{most cases}} for the {{structural}} design of architectural glazing systems under {{a wide range}} of environmental conditions, the designers follow procedures provided by model building codes to design window glass. These codes commonly use design charts to determine design strength based on nominal glass thickness and aspect ratio. <b>Glass</b> <b>plies</b> are the principal components of laminated glass (LG) where a thin ply of elastomeric material Polyvinyl butyral (PVB) is used to bond <b>glass</b> <b>plies</b> (normally two plies) to form the LG. Because of the reduction in LG design strength by most building codes and design guidelines, designers avoid architectural LG applications, other than for safety consideration. In this research a higher order mathematical model based on Mindlin plate theory is presented. LG was modeled using finite element methodology with new interlayer (NI). It consists of two plies of PVB with a hard ply of film material in between. In the FEM, properties of PVB/film material can be easily controlled regardless of their thicknesses. The finite element model (FEM) was extended to account the design recommendations of ASTM (2012) to develop the design charts for LG with NI. The current FEM was verified and used to study the stresses transformation through NI. Design charts for samples of LG with NI were developed and presented. It has been found that using NI enhances the total behavior of LG and reflects on the design charts for this type of interlayer material...|$|R

40|$|Static {{and fatigue}} {{properties}} are important factors when developing design rules {{to optimize the}} reduction of damage {{in the middle of}} a composite component loaded under a three point bending test. The progressive damage which occurs in a composite laminate during fatigue will affect the mechanical properties of the component to an extent which depends on the material type and lay-up of the composite and on the mode of testing. By choosing an appropriate combination of ply materials and ply stacking sequence for the composite laminate, a better static condition, as well as better fatigue behavior of the component is expected under in-service conditions. In order to minimize the through-thickness damage {{in the middle of a}} composite laminate under a short beam shear test, the present work focuses on determining the best stacking sequence, combining two different materials through-thickness of a composite component. The use of an algorithm that has been created to run all possible combinations of angles and materials was the key to finding the best stacking sequence for a composite component. Through the optimization method, two different hybrid laminate lay-ups were obtained for a maximum of 40 % of <b>glass</b> <b>plies</b> within a composite laminate. The laminates developed through the algorithm, which are, the Hybrid Design 1 ([(0 c) 2 /(± 45 c) 2 /(± 45 g) 2 /(± 45 c) ]s) and Hybrid Design 2 ([(0 c) 2 /(± 45 g) /(90 c) 4 /(± 45 g) /(90 c) 2]s), have shown that the best ply orientations to minimize the damage in the middle of a composite component occur when the value of the variable angle θ in ±θ plies has a maximum value of 90 degrees. The algorithm used showed that best laminates were obtained when <b>glass</b> <b>plies</b> were not used as the central plies in a glass/carbon composite laminate, with a maximum 40 % of <b>glass</b> <b>plies.</b> Static and fatigue tests were performed on both hybrid designs and on a quasi-isotropic composite laminate ([(0 / 45 / 90 /- 45) 3]s) made of carbon plies. The results of the static and fatigue tests have demonstrated that the best design, giving the best static and fatigue behavior is the Hybrid Design 1. Also, it has been demonstrated through experimental tests that 90 degree plies within a composite laminate subject to a three point bending condition will cause the component to be weaker in terms of fatigue and static properties due to the tendency to develop inclined cracks in the through-thickness direction on the 90 degree plies of the composite laminate, causing delamination and loss of stiffness of the component...|$|R

Addressed are the formulation, implementation, and verification of the model. Parametric studies were conducted on the effect of Poisson's ratio mismatch between plies and the stacking sequence on interlaminar stress, and on the effect of delamination opening height and delamination length, due to bending, on strain energy release rate for various laminates. A comparison of strain energy release rates in all-graphite and graphite/glass hybrid laminates is included. The preliminary results of laminates subjected to torsion are also included. Fatigue tension tests were conducted on Mode 1 and mixed mode edge-delamination coupons to establish the relationship between fatigue load vs. onset of delamination cycle. The effect on the fatigue delamination onset of different frequencies (1 and 5 Hz) was investigated for glass, graphite,and their hybrid laminates. Although a 20 percent increase in the static onset-of-delamination strength and a 10 percent increase in ultimate strength resulted from hybridizing the all-graphite laminate with a 90 deg <b>glass</b> <b>ply,</b> the fatigue onset is lower in the hybrid laminate than in the all-graphite laminate...|$|E

40|$|The {{stiffness}} {{and strength of}} laminated glass, a composite of glass layers bonded together by polymeric interlayers, depend upon shear coupling between the <b>glass</b> <b>plies</b> through the polymer.

This case applies in particular to laminated glass, a composite made of <b>glass</b> <b>plies</b> bonded together by polymeric films. A practical way to calculate the response of such a package is to consider also the interlayer to be linear elastic, assuming its equivalent elastic moduli to be the relaxed moduli under constant strain, after a time equal to {{the duration of the}} design action. The obtained results, that are confirmed by a full 3 -D viscoelastic finite-element numerical analysis, emphasize that there is a noteworthy difference between the state of strain and stress calculated in the full-viscoelastic case or in the aforementioned “equivalent” elastic problem...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of laminated glass, {{which consists of}} two or more <b>glass</b> <b>plies</b> bonded together by polymeric interlayers, depends upon shear coupling between the plies through the polymer.

General expressions have been proposed on the basis of simplified models by Newmark and Wölfel-Bennison, but they are either diffcult to apply or inaccurate. Here, a variational approach to the problem is presented.

The traditional formulas à la Wölfel-Bennison are accurate only when the deformed bending shape of the plate is cylindrical and the plate response {{is similar to that of}} a beam under uniformly distributed load.

In this article, a finite element framework based on the cohesive zone method is developed to characterise the adhesive properties and study the influential factors in a 90 ° peel test. The resulting values are of similar magnitude as in other publications in the field, but no certainty can be established over them, mainly because large-strain behaviour of PVB interlayer is still not well documented for the observed range of strain rates.

The studied joints {{have been used in}} a light full composite airplane. By using solid laminates, a new design for the joint zone is developed. These solid laminates include a number of <b>glass</b> <b>plies</b> with total thickness equal to core thickness. The effect of solid laminate size and interface angle of foam–solid laminate in the bonding zone on the bearing strength, failure loads and type of modes are investigated. The numerical study is performed using 3 D FEM in ANSYS commercial code. Tsai–Wu failure criterion is used in the failure analysis. The results indicate that the most important parameter in the proposed joint zone design is the foam–solid laminate interface angle which plays an important role on the value of failure criterion (damage) in the bonding zone. Also, the use of squared shaped solid laminate as compared with a circular laminate will decrease the criterion value significantly. Finally, the influence of solid laminate size and interface angle on the buckling strength was discussed. As obtained through eigenvalue buckling analysis, the increase of solid laminate size or interface angle could result in considerable higher buckling strength.

Then the questions are: - How and when does the glass fracture? - How are the fragments kept together by the interlayer? - How much of the impact energy can be dissipated by the window without causing danger to humans? Or practically, up to which load is a glazing panel able to withstand the attack? It may be clear that destructive testing is a complex and expensive manner to assess the applicability of a structural wall configuration. Computer simulation offers a tool that can save time and costs, and the possibility to gain a deeper insight in the quantification of the main failure mechanisms: brittle cracking, delamination, interlayer tearing and frame connection failure. Our aim is to develop a numerical modelling technique for laminated glass under impact and blast loads, validated by laboratory experiments. The finite element model takes into account non-linear material behaviour and allows for localised fracture, using upcoming techniques such as the cohesive zone method...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA new {{approach}} and material architecture {{is presented in}} order to overcome the inherent brittleness and unstable failure characteristic of conventional high performance composites. The concept {{is the use of}} thin-ply hybrid laminates. Fracture mechanics calculations were carried out to determine the critical carbon layer thickness for stable pull-out in a three layer unidirectional hybrid laminate, which can provide a pseudo-ductile failure. Unidirectional hybrid composites were fabricated by sandwiching various numbers of thin carbon prepreg plies between standard thickness <b>glass</b> prepreg <b>plies</b> and tested in tension. Specimens with one and two plies of thin carbon prepreg produced pseudo-ductile failure, whereas ones with three and four plies failed with unstable delamination. An explanation of the different failure modes is given in terms of the different energy release rates for delamination in various specimens. The observed damage characteristics agreed well with the expectations according to the estimated critical carbon layer thickness...|$|R
