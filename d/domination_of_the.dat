Two players, A and D, orient <b>the</b> edges <b>of</b> <b>the</b> graph alternately until all edges are oriented. Player D starts the game, and his goal is to decrease <b>the</b> <b>domination</b> number <b>of</b> <b>the</b> resulting digraph, while A is trying to increase it. <b>The</b> game <b>domination</b> number <b>of</b> <b>the</b> graph G, denoted by γg(G), is <b>the</b> <b>domination</b> number <b>of</b> <b>the</b> directed graph resulting from this game. This is well defined if we suppose that both players follow their optimal strategies. We determine the game domination number for several classes of graphs and provide general inequalities relating it to other graph parameters...|$|R

Consequently, the autonomists were opposed to Most. Soon, Berkman {{was working for the}} autonomists' publications, Der Anarchist and Die Autonomie, but he remained committed to the concept of violent action as a tool for inspiring revolutionary change.|$|E

5|$|In the Early Middle Ages, {{from the}} end of the 4th century, the western extent of modern-day Switzerland was part of the {{territory}} of the Kings of the Burgundians. The Alemanni settled the Swiss plateau in the 5th century and the valleys of the Alps in the 8th century, forming Alemannia. Modern-day Switzerland was therefore then divided between the kingdoms of Alemannia and Burgundy. The entire region became part of the expanding Frankish Empire in the 6th century, following Clovis I's victory over the Alemanni at Tolbiac in 504 AD, and later Frankish <b>domination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Burgundians.|$|E

40|$|The {{school choice}} {{mechanism}} design problem focuses on assignment mechanisms matching students {{to public schools}} in a given school district. The well-known Gale Shapley Student Optimal Stable Matching Mechanism (SOSM) is the most efficient stable mechanism proposed so far {{as a solution to}} this problem. However its inefficiency is well-documented, and recently the Efficiency Adjusted Deferred Acceptance Mechanism (EADAM) was proposed as a remedy for this weakness. In this note we describe two related adjustments to SOSM with the intention to address the same inefficiency issue. In one we create possibly artificial coalitions among students where some students modify their preference profiles in order to improve the outcome for some other students. Our second approach involves trading cliques among students where those involved improve their assignments by waiving some <b>of</b> their priorities. <b>The</b> coalition method yields the EADAM outcome among other Pareto <b>dominations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SOSM outcome, while the clique method yields all possible Pareto optimal Pareto <b>dominations</b> <b>of</b> SOSM. <b>The</b> clique method furthermore incorporates a natural solution to <b>the</b> problem <b>of</b> breaking possible ties within preference and priority profiles. We discuss the practical implications and limitations of our approach in <b>the</b> final section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> article...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA sharp {{lower bound}} for the {{domination}} number and <b>the</b> total <b>domination</b> number <b>of</b> <b>the</b> direct product <b>of</b> finitely many complete graphs is given: γ(×i= 1 tKni) ≥t+ 1,t≥ 3.

5|$|The {{political}} history of medieval Karnataka spans the 4th to the 16th centuries, when the empires that {{evolved in the}} Karnataka region of India made a lasting impact on the subcontinent. Before this, alien empires held sway over the region, and the nucleus of power was outside modern Karnataka. The medieval era can be broadly divided into several periods: The earliest native kingdoms and imperialism; the successful <b>domination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gangetic plains in northern India and rivalry with the empires of Tamilakam over the Vengi region; and the <b>domination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> southern Deccan and consolidation against Muslim invasion. The origins {{of the rise of}} the Karnataka region as an independent power date back to the fourth-century birth of the Kadamba Dynasty of Banavasi, the earliest of the native rulers to conduct administration in the native language of Kannada in addition to the official Sanskrit. This is the historical starting point in studying the development of the region as an enduring geopolitical entity and of Kannada as an important regional language.|$|E

5|$|Although Disston's {{engineered}} canals aided {{water transport}} and steamboat traffic in Florida, he was ultimately unsuccessful in draining the Kissimmee River floodplain or lowering the surface water around Lake Okeechobee {{and in the}} Everglades. He was forced to sell much of his investments {{at a fraction of}} their original costs. However, his land purchase primed Florida's economy and allowed railroad magnates Henry Flagler and Henry Plant to build rail lines down the east coast of Florida, and another joining the west coast, which directly led to the <b>domination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tourist and citrus industries in Florida. Disston's immediate impact was in the Philadelphia area, where he was active in Republican politics and a philanthropist, but his legacy is often associated with the draining and development of Florida.|$|E

Pulaski was one of the leading military commanders for the Bar Confederation and fought against Russian <b>domination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Commonwealth. When this uprising failed, he was driven into exile. Following a recommendation by Benjamin Franklin, Pulaski emigrated to North America to help in the cause of the American Revolutionary War. He distinguished himself throughout the revolution, most notably when he saved the life of George Washington. Pulaski became a general in the Continental Army, created the Pulaski Cavalry Legion and reformed the American cavalry as a whole. At the Battle of Savannah, while leading a daring charge against British forces, he was gravely wounded, and died shortly thereafter.|$|E

German East African soldiery at the outbreak of war comprised 216 German officers and enlisted men, and 2,450 askaris (native soldiers); police numbered 45 whites and 2,154 askaris. Because of the British Royal Navy's <b>domination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Indian Ocean, German East Africa was largely isolated from outside help. It therefore fought a war of improvisation, judicious resource management and unorthodox strategy. During the conflict, its military strength grew to a peak of 3,300 whites and anywhere between 15,000 and 30,000 askaris, all commanded by Generalmajor Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck.|$|E

To bolster his position with Himmler, Rosenberg was even willing to appoint Berger as his second state secretary, but Hitler would not allow it. On 10 August 1943, Berger convinced Rosenberg to appoint him as the Chief of Political Operations in the Occupied Eastern Territories. Himmler had long wanted such responsibilities {{to be placed in}} SS hands, and this appointment meant that Berger could sabotage any resistance to SS <b>domination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> economy and population of the subjugated east. The appointment took effect on 10 August 1943, and lasted until January 1945. In this role, Berger proposed a plan to kidnap and enslave 50,000 Eastern European {{children between the ages of}} 10 and 14, under the codename Heuaktion.

Earlier splits within the Church occurred after the Council of Ephesus (431) and the Council of Chalcedon (451).
