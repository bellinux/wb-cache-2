5|$|A large {{squadron}} of ten frigates, including Aigle, was eventually {{able to make}} its way up the western passage on 9 August, enduring fire from batteries {{on both sides of}} the river <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>two</b> <b>hours.</b> Aigle, in the centre, had her stern frame shattered when a shell fell through the deck and exploded, killing a marine and wounding four other members of the crew. She was the only ship to suffer any damage and her casualties amounted to almost half the total of two killed and nine wounded.|$|E
5|$|At 15:00 Lhermitte {{ordered the}} masts on Preneuse {{to be cut}} away and the frigate and battery then opened fire on Adamant, which was {{carefully}} sailing through the coastal shoals {{in an effort to}} engage the beached French ship. <b>For</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> Hotham's ship worked its way inshore until at 17:30 it was well positioned to open fire, unleashing its broadside on the wrecked Preneuse. By 17:45 it was clear that further resistance was futile and Lhermitte struck his colours. Preneuse had surrendered, but was likely damaged beyond repair.|$|E
5|$|Saumarez {{immediately}} {{moved to}} engage the French ship and managed to isolate the frigate and subject it to a fierce barrage of fire <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>two</b> <b>hours.</b> Captain François A. Dénian on Réunion responded, but aside from inflicting minor damage to Saumarez's rigging achieved little while his own vessel was heavily battered, suffering severe damage to rigging masts and hull and more than 80 and possibly as many as 120 casualties. British losses were confined to a single man wounded by an accident aboard Crescent. Eventually Dénian could not hold out any longer {{and was forced to}} surrender on the arrival of the 28-gun British frigate HMS Circe. Réunion was later repaired and commissioned into the Royal Navy, while Saumarez was knighted for his success.|$|E

5|$|Tecumseh, not {{yet ready}} to oppose the United States by force, was away {{recruiting}} allies when Harrison's army arrived. Tenskwatawa, a spiritual leader but not a military man, was in charge. Harrison camped near Prophetstown on November 6 and arranged to meet with Tenskwatawa the following day. Early the next morning, however, warriors from Prophetstown attacked Harrison's army. Although the outnumbered attackers took Harrison's army by surprise, Harrison and his men stood their ground <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>two</b> <b>hours.</b> The Native Americans were ultimately repulsed when their ammunition ran low. After the battle, they abandoned Prophetstown and Harrison's men burned it to the ground, destroying the food supplies stored for the winter. The soldiers returned to their homes.|$|E
5|$|Pathan gained {{selection}} for the 2007–08 tour of Australia, {{but did not}} play {{in the first two}} Tests with only two pacemen chosen. Zaheer and Singh were the first-choice pace duo before the former was injured and replaced by Ishant, who had taken five wickets in the first innings of the Bangalore Test. With the Third Test held on the bouncy WACA Ground in Perth, Pathan replaced second spinner Harbhajan Singh. He batted well with scores of 28 and 46 respectively. His second innings performance came as a nightwatchman in order to shield other batsmen from the new ball late in the second day. After entering at the fall of the first wicket, he batted <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> and was the sixth man to fall. Pathan rediscovered his ability to swing the ball, taking 2/63 and 3/54, including both Australian openers in each innings, having the hosts two wickets down in both innings before 50 runs had been scored. He had four of his victims caught behind the wicket off an edge and trapped Chris Rogers lbw. India won by 72 runs and Pathan was recognised with the man of the match award.|$|E

25|$|By {{the late}} 1990s, Assad's health had deteriorated. American diplomats said Assad had {{difficulty}} staying focused and seemed tired during their meetings; {{he was seen}} as incapable of functioning <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> a day. His spokesperson ignored the speculation, and Assad's official routine in 1999 was basically unchanged from the previous decade. Assad continued to conduct meetings, traveling abroad occasionally; he visited Moscow in July 1999. Because of his increasing seclusion from state affairs, the government became accustomed to working without his involvement in day-to-day affairs. On 10 June 2000, {{at the age of}} 69, Hafez al-Assad {{died of a heart attack}} while on the telephone with Lebanese prime minister Hoss. 40 days of mourning was declared in Syria and 7 days in Lebanon thereafter.
