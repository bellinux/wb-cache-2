25|$|Diflucan (<b>fluconazole),</b> {{the first}} orally {{available}} treatment for severe fungal infections. <b>Fluconazole</b> is recommended as a first-line treatment in invasive candidiasis and {{is widely used}} in the prophylaxis of severe fungal infections in premature infants. <b>Fluconazole</b> is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines.|$|E
25|$|Clinical infections due to Sporobolomyces salmonicolor {{are rare}} {{and there are}} {{currently}} no standard therapies for infection. Treatment with amphotericin B alone, and amphotericin B followed by either ketoconazole or <b>fluconazole</b> have been successful. In one case of endophthalmitis (mentioned in case report below), treatment with voriconazole was likewise successful. A small number of isolates however demonstrate resistance to <b>fluconazole</b> and micafungin.|$|E
25|$|It is {{sold under}} many trade names {{worldwide}} and in combinations with cefixime, nimesulide, ambroxol, and with both tinidazole and <b>fluconazole.</b>|$|E
25|$|Additionally, the {{metabolism}} of zonisamide is inhibited by ketoconazole, ciclosporin, miconazole, <b>fluconazole</b> and carbamazepine (in {{descending order}} of inhibition) {{due to their}} effects on the CYP3A4 enzyme.|$|E
25|$|It is {{also sold}} as a {{combination}} drug with nimesulide as Zitroflam; in a combination with tinidazole and <b>fluconazole</b> as Trivafluc, and in a combination with ambroxol as Zathrin-AX, Laz-AX and Azro-AM.|$|E
25|$|Nevirapine is a {{substrate}} for liver CYP3A and CYP2B6 enzymes. Concomitant {{administration of}} drugs that are inhibitors of these enzymes may increase serum nevirapine levels significantly. Some examples of these drugs include ritonavir, fosamprenavir, and <b>fluconazole.</b> On the other hand, drugs that are inducers of these enzymes such as rifampicin may lower serum nevirapine levels.|$|E
25|$|The company {{develops}} {{and produces}} medicines and vaccines {{for a wide}} range of medical disciplines, including immunology, oncology, cardiology, diabetology/endocrinology, and neurology. Its products include the blockbuster drug Lipitor (atorvastatin), used to lower LDL blood cholesterol; Lyrica (pregabalin) for neuropathic pain/fibromyalgia; Diflucan (<b>fluconazole),</b> an oral antifungal medication; Zithromax (azithromycin), an antibiotic; Viagra (sildenafil) for erectile dysfunction; and Celebrex/Celebra (celecoxib), an anti-inflammatory drug.|$|E
25|$|The {{evidence}} {{around the}} treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis is poor. A number of topical treatments {{may be used for}} cutaneous leishmaniasis. Which treatments are effective depends on the strain, with topical paromomycin effective for L. major, L. tropica, L. mexicana, L. panamensis, and L. braziliensis. Pentamidine is effective for L. guyanensis. Oral <b>fluconazole</b> or itraconazole appears effective in L. major and L. tropica.|$|E
25|$|Pfizer {{makes the}} {{anti-fungal}} drug <b>fluconazole</b> available {{free of charge}} to governmental and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in developing countries with a greater than 1% prevalence of HIV/AIDS. The company has also pledged to provide up to 740million doses of its anti-pneumococcal vaccine at discounted rates to infants and young children in 41 developing countries {{in association with the}} GAVI Alliance.|$|E
25|$|A {{large number}} of {{pharmaceuticals}} contain halogens, especially fluorine. An estimated one fifth of pharmaceuticals contain fluorine, including several {{of the most widely}} used drugs. Examples include 5-fluorouracil, fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil), ciprofloxacin (Cipro), mefloquine, and <b>fluconazole.</b> The beneficial effects arise because the C-F bond is relatively unreactive. Fluorine-substituted ethers are volatile anesthetics, including the commercial products methoxyflurane, enflurane, isoflurane, sevoflurane and desflurane. Fluorocarbon anesthetics reduce the hazard of flammability with diethyl ether and cyclopropane. Perfluorinated alkanes are used as blood substitutes.|$|E
25|$|Leishmaniasis can {{be partly}} {{prevented}} by sleeping under nets treated with insecticide. Other measures include spraying insecticides to kill sandflies and treating {{people with the}} disease early to prevent further spread. The treatment needed is determined by where the disease is acquired, the species of Leishmania, {{and the type of}} infection. Some possible medications used for visceral disease include liposomal amphotericin B, a combination of pentavalent antimonials and paromomycin, and miltefosine. For cutaneous disease, paromomycin, <b>fluconazole,</b> or pentamidine may be effective.|$|E
25|$|As an antifungal, {{ketoconazole}} is structurally {{similar to}} imidazole, and {{interferes with the}} fungal synthesis of ergosterol, a constituent of fungal cell membranes, as well as certain enzymes. As with all azole antifungal agents, ketoconazole works principally by inhibiting the enzyme cytochrome P450 14α-demethylase (CYP51A1). This enzyme participates in the sterol biosynthesis pathway that leads from lanosterol to ergosterol. Lower doses of <b>fluconazole</b> and itraconazole are required to kill fungi compared to ketoconazole, {{as they have been}} found to have a greater affinity for fungal cell membranes.|$|E
25|$|For comparison, {{another group}} of azoles is the triazoles, which {{includes}} <b>fluconazole,</b> itraconazole, and voriconazole. The difference between the imidazoles and the triazoles involves the mechanism of inhibition of the cytochrome P450 enzyme. The N3 of the imidazole compound binds to the heme iron atom of ferric cytochrome P450, whereas the N4 of the triazoles bind to the heme group. The triazoles {{have been shown to}} have a higher specificity for the cytochrome P450 than imidazoles, thereby making them more potent than the imidazoles.|$|E
25|$|Where {{available}} and tolerated by the patient, antifungal drugs are indicated {{as the primary}} treatment of sporotrichosis. For cutaneous infection itraconazole or terbinafine are the primary treatment with <b>fluconazole</b> being recommended if primary antifungals are not well-tolerated. When infection is disseminated throughout the body, Amphotericin B is the drug of choice. To completely clear the fungus, the course of treatment generally lasts from 3 to 6 months. In vitro susceptibility to antifungal drugs {{has been shown to}} be dependent on the growth phase (hyphal or yeast) of the fungus.|$|E
25|$|Flucytosine by {{mouth is}} used for the {{treatment}} of serious infections caused by susceptible strains of Candida or Cryptococcus neoformans. It can also be used for the treatment of chromomycosis (chromoblastomycosis), if susceptible strains cause the infection. Flucytosine must not be used as a sole agent in life-threatening fungal infections due to relatively weak antifungal effects and fast development of resistance, but rather in combination with amphotericin B and/or azole antifungals such as <b>fluconazole</b> or itraconazole. Minor infections such as candidal cystitis may be treated with flucytosine alone. In some countries, treatment with slow intravenous infusions for no more than a week is also a therapeutic option, particular if the disease is life-threatening.|$|E
25|$|Co-administration of {{atorvastatin}} {{with one}} of CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole, telithromycin, and voriconazole, may increase serum concentrations of atorvastatin, which may lead to adverse reactions. This {{is less likely to}} happen with other CYP3A4 inhibitors such as diltiazem, erythromycin, <b>fluconazole,</b> ketoconazole, clarithromycin, cyclosporine, protease inhibitors, or verapamil, and only rarely with other CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as amiodarone and aprepitant. Often, bosentan, fosphenytoin, and phenytoin, which are CYP3A4 inducers, can decrease the plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. Only rarely, though, barbiturates, carbamazepine, efavirenz, nevirapine, oxcarbazepine, rifampin, and rifamycin, which are also CYP3A4 inducers, can decrease the plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. Oral contraceptives increased AUC values for norethisterone and ethinylestradiol; these increases should be considered when selecting an oral contraceptive for a woman taking atorvastatin.|$|E
25|$|Efforts {{to prevent}} infections {{of the mouth}} {{include the use of}} {{chlorhexidine}} mouth wash in those with poor immune function and washing out the mouth following the use of inhaled steroids. Little evidence supports probiotics for either prevention or treatment even among those with frequent vaginal infections. For infections of the mouth, treatment with topical clotrimazole or nystatin is usually effective. By mouth or intravenous <b>fluconazole,</b> itraconazole, or amphotericin B may be used if these do not work. A number of topical antifungal medications may be used for vaginal infections including clotrimazole. In those with widespread disease, an echinocandin such as caspofungin or micafungin is used. A number of weeks of intravenous amphotericin B may be used as an alternative. In certain groups at very high risk, antifungal medications may be used preventatively.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} aspect of treatment is improving denture hygiene, i.e. removing the denture at night, cleaning and disinfecting it, and storing it overnight in an antiseptic solution. This is important as the denture is usually infected with C. albicans which will cause re-infection if it is not removed. Substances which are used include solutions of alkaline peroxides, alkaline hypochlorites (e.g. hypochlorite, which may over time corrode metal components of dental appliances), acids (e.g. benzoic acid), yeast lytic enzymes and proteolytic enzymes (e.g. alcalase protease). The other aspect of treatment involves resolution of the mucosal infection, for which topical antifungal medications are used (e.g. nystatin, amphotericin, miconazole, <b>fluconazole</b> or itraconazole). Often an antimicrobial mouthwash such as chlorhexidine is concurrently prescribed. Possible underlying disease (diabetes, HIV) should be treated where possible.|$|E
25|$|Biologically {{synthesized}} organofluorines {{have been}} found in microorganisms and plants, but not animals. The most common example is fluoroacetate, which occurs as a plant defence against herbivores in at least 40 plants in Australia, Brazil and Africa. Other biologically synthesized organofluorines include ω-fluoro fatty acids, fluoroacetone, and 2-fluorocitrate which are all believed to be biosynthesized in biochemical pathways from the intermediate fluoroacetaldehyde. Adenosyl-fluoride synthase is an enzyme capable of biologically synthesizing the carbon–fluorine bond. Man made carbon–fluorine bonds are commonly found in pharmaceuticals and agrichemicals because it adds stability to the carbon framework; also, the relatively small size of fluorine is convenient as fluorine acts as an approximate bioisostere of the hydroxyl group. Introducing the carbon–fluorine bond to organic compounds is the major challenge for medicinal chemists using organofluorine chemistry, as the carbon–fluorine bond increases the probability of having a successful drug by about a factor of ten. An estimated 20% of pharmaceuticals, and 3040% of agrichemicals are organofluorines, including several of the top drugs. Examples include 5-fluorouracil, fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil), ciprofloxacin (Cipro), mefloquine, and <b>fluconazole.</b>|$|E
2500|$|These are {{antifungal}} drugs. [...] Itraconazole {{is currently}} the drug of choice and is significantly more effective than <b>fluconazole.</b> <b>Fluconazole</b> should be reserved for patients who cannot tolerate itraconazole.|$|E
2500|$|Leishmania major [...] :L. major {{infections are}} usually {{considered}} to heal spontaneously {{and do not}} require treatment, {{but there have been}} several reports of severe cases caused by L. major in Afghanistan. In Saudi Arabia, a six-week course of oral <b>fluconazole</b> 200mg daily has been reported to speed up healing. In a randomized clinical trial from Iran, <b>fluconazole</b> 400mg daily was shown to be significantly more effective than <b>fluconazole</b> 200mg daily in the treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis.|$|E

2500|$|On the whole, oral <b>fluconazole</b> and {{intravenous}} amphotericin B {{are used}} in progressive or disseminated disease, or in immunocompromised individuals. Amphotericin B {{used to be the}} only available treatment, although now there are alternatives, including itraconazole or ketoconazole may be used for milder disease. <b>Fluconazole</b> is the preferred medication for coccidioidal meningitis, due to its penetration into CSF. Intrathecal or intraventricular amphotericin B therapy is used if infection persists after <b>fluconazole</b> treatment. Itraconazole is used for cases that involve treatment of infected person's bones and joints. The antifungal medications posaconazole and voriconazole have also been used to treat coccidioidomycosis. [...] Because the symptoms of valley fever are similar to the common flu and other respiratory diseases, it is important for public health professionals {{to be aware of the}} rise of valley fever and the specifics of diagnosis. [...] Greyhound dogs often get valley fever as well, and their treatment regimen involves 6–12 months of Ketoconazole, to be taken with food.|$|E
2500|$|Hydrazine is a {{precursor}} to several pharmaceuticals and pesticides. Often these applications involve conversion of hydrazine to heterocyclic rings such as pyrazoles and pyridazines. [...] Examples of commercialized bioactive hydrazine derivatives include cefazolin, rizatriptan, anastrozole, [...] <b>fluconazole,</b> metazachlor, metamitron, metribuzin, paclobutrazol, diclobutrazole, propiconazole,hydrazine sulfate, diimide and triadimefon.|$|E
2500|$|The less toxic and {{generally}} more effective triazole antifungal agents <b>fluconazole</b> and itraconazole are usually preferred for systemic use. In 2013 the European Medicines Agency's Committee on Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) recommended that a ban {{be imposed on}} the use of oral ketoconazole for systemic use in humans throughout the European Union, after concluding that the risk of serious liver injury from systemic ketoconazole outweighs its benefits. [...] The oral formulation of ketoconazole was discontinued in Australia in 2013 and in China in 2015.|$|E
2500|$|The carbon-fluorine bond is {{commonly}} found in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals because it is generally metabolically stable and fluorine acts as a bioisostere of the hydrogen atom. [...] An estimated one fifth of pharmaceuticals contain fluorine, including several of the top drugs. Examples include 5-fluorouracil, flunitrazepam (Rohypnol), fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil), ciprofloxacin (Cipro), mefloquine, and <b>fluconazole.</b> [...] Fluorine-substituted ethers are volatile anesthetics, including the commercial products methoxyflurane, enflurane, isoflurane, sevoflurane and desflurane.

2500|$|Ketoconazole and Itraconazole have a {{profound}} effect on the pharmacokinetics of triazolam, leading to greatly enhanced effects. Anxiety, tremor and depression have been documented in a case report following administration of nitrazepam and triazolam. Following administration of erythromycin, repetitive hallucinations and abnormal bodily sensations developed. The patient had, however, acute pneumonia and renal failure. Co-administration of benzodiazepine drugs at therapeutic doses with erythromycin may cause serious psychotic symptoms, especially in those with other physical complications. Caffeine reduces the effectiveness of triazolam. Other important interactions include cimetidine, diltiazem, erythromycin, [...] <b>fluconazole,</b> grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, [...] rifampicin, ritonavir, and troleandomycin. Triazolam should not be administered to patients on Atripla.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Fluconazole</b> is an {{inhibitor}} of {{the human}} cytochrome P450 system, particularly the isozyme CYP2C19 (CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 to lesser extent) [...] In theory, therefore, <b>fluconazole</b> decreases the metabolism and increases the concentration of any drug metabolised by these enzymes. In addition, its potential effect on QT interval {{increases the risk of}} cardiac arrhythmia if used concurrently with other drugs that prolong the QT interval. Berberine has been shown to exert synergistic effects with <b>fluconazole</b> even in drug-resistant Candida albicans infections. <b>Fluconazole</b> may decrease the metabolism of benzodiazepines. <b>Fluconazole</b> may increase the serum concentration of Citalopram (Risk X: avoid combination). <b>Fluconazole</b> may increase the serum concentration of Erythromycin (Risk X: avoid combination).|$|E

5000|$|Persons {{living with}} AIDS {{often have a}} greater burden of disease and higher {{mortality}} (30-70% at 10-weeks), but recommended therapy is with amphotericin B and flucytosine. Where flucytosine is not available (many low and middle income countries), <b>fluconazole</b> should be used with amphotericin. Amphotericin-based induction therapy has much greater microbiologic activity than <b>fluconazole</b> monotherapy with 30% better survival at 10-weeks. [...] Based on a systematic review of existing data, the most cost-effective induction treatment in resource-limited settings appears to be one week of amphotericin B coupled with high-dose <b>fluconazole.</b> [...] After initial induction treatment as above, typical consolidation therapy is with oral <b>fluconazole</b> for at least 8 weeks used with secondary prophylaxis with <b>fluconazole</b> thereafter.|$|E

50|$|Vaginal yeast {{infections are}} {{typically}} treated with topical antifungal agents. A one-time dose of <b>fluconazole</b> is 90% effective in treating a vaginal yeast infection. For severe nonrecurring cases, several doses of <b>fluconazole</b> is recommended. Local treatment may include vaginal suppositories or medicated douches. Other types of yeast infections require different dosing. Gentian violet {{can be used}} for thrush in breastfeeding babies. C. albicans can develop resistance to <b>fluconazole,</b> this being more of an issue in those with HIV/AIDS who are often treated with multiple courses of <b>fluconazole</b> for recurrent oral infections.|$|E
50|$|Like other imidazole- and triazole-class antifungals, <b>fluconazole</b> {{inhibits}} the fungal cytochrome P450 enzyme 14α-demethylase. Mammalian demethylase {{activity is}} much less sensitive to <b>fluconazole</b> than fungal demethylase. This inhibition prevents the conversion of lanosterol to ergosterol, {{an essential component of}} the fungal cytoplasmic membrane, and subsequent accumulation of 14α-methyl sterols. <b>Fluconazole</b> is primarily fungistatic; however, it may be fungicidal against certain organisms in a dose-dependent manner, specifically Cryptococcus.|$|E
