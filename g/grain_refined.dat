Using the capacitance proximity sensor technique and a high-speed-camera system, the dendrite growth velocity has been measured {{as a function}} of initial undercooling in solidifying droplets processed by the electromagnetic levitation technique. Analyses of solidified droplets give evidence to a transition from coarse grained dendrites to <b>grain</b> <b>refined</b> dendrites (CG-GR) at small undercooling, a transition from <b>grain</b> <b>refined</b> dendrites to coarse grained dendrites (GR-CG) at moderate undercooling, and to a second transition from coarse grained dendrites to <b>grain</b> <b>refined</b> dendrites (CG-GR) at a higher undercooling.

The chemical compositions of the steels are critical, and minor changes in chemistry can make substantial differences. Aluminium and vanadium are used in heat treatable steels as grain refining agents. These elements affect the properties of the steels. Two steels with identical chemical composition except for the aluminium and vanadium additions were comparatively tested to determine the better steel for a particular automotive coil spring. The tests included mechanical testing and on site fatigue testing. Fatigue resistance is extremely important especially for automotive coil springs.

40|$|Spontaneous grain {{refinement}} in undercooled metallic melts {{has been a}} topic of enduring interest within the solidification community since its discovery more than 50 years ago. Here we present a comparative study of the solidification microstructures and velocity-undercooling behaviour in two dilute Cu-Ni alloys (3. 98 & 8. 90 wt. % Ni), which have been undercooled by a melt encasement (fluxing) method. Cu- 3. 98 wt. % Ni shows {{grain refinement}} at both low and high undercooling, with a dendritic growth regime separating the two <b>grain</b> <b>refined</b> regions. Within the <b>grain</b> <b>refined</b> region dendritic fragments are clearly evident in the centres of the refined grains and {{on the surface of}} the undercooled droplet, suggesting a dendritic fragmentation mechanism. Cu- 8. 90 wt. % Ni displays also grain refinement at both high and low undercoolings. In the low undercooling <b>grain</b> <b>refined</b> region the samples display curved grain boundaries with a dendritic substructure that extends across grains, indicative of a recovery and recrystallisation mechanism. Conversely, prior to the onset of the high undercooling grain refinement transition extensive regions of dendritic seaweed are observed, suggesting that it is remelting of a dendritic seaweed that gives rise to this structure. Consequently, in two closely related Cu-based systems we have strong microstructural evidence for the operation of all three mechanisms currently considered to give rise to grain refinement. This may help to resolve the grain refinement controversy, although it remains to be determined what factors determine which mechanism operates in any given system...|$|E

40|$|International audienceGrain {{structures}} {{observed in}} most casting processes of metallic alloys {{are the result}} of a competition between the growth of several arrays of dendrites that develop under constrained and unconstrained conditions. Often this leads to a transition from columnar to equiaxed grain growth during solidification (CET). A microgravity environment results in suppression of buoyancy-driven melt flow and so enables growth of equiaxed grains free of sedimentation and buoyancy effects. This contribution presents first results obtained in experiments on-board the International Space Station (ISS), which were performed in the frame of the ESA-MAP programme CETSOL. Hypoeutectic aluminium-silicon alloys with and without grain refiners were processed successfully in a low gradient furnace (MSL-LGF). First analysis shows that in the non <b>grain</b> <b>refined</b> samples columnar dendritic growth exists, whereas CET is observed in the <b>grain</b> <b>refined</b> samples. From analysis of the thermal data and the grain structure the critical parameters for the temperature gradient and the cooling rate describing CET are determined.

Nucleation of the <b>grain</b> <b>refined</b> alloy samples occurred from the coolest to the hottest parts {{of the field of}} view in a sequence that mimicked a forward moving wave.

Measurements of both grain density and growth rate show the effect of Si content and grain refiner (Al 3 Ti 1 B master alloy) additions on grain size. While the total number of grains increases in the alloys with added Al 3 Ti 1 B master alloy, the growth rates tend to be slower. Furthermore, the growth rate for all alloy compositions fluctuates between slow and fast velocities during the initial stages of growth and then tends towards a low steady state value. This decreasing trend is explained in terms of thermal and solutal field interactions between adjacent growing grains and subsequent grain impingement.

With a view to the possible future development of a micro-macro model to describe the casting of this alloy, the effect of grain refinement on the microsegregation of magnesium in industrial rolling ingots of AA 5182 has been investigated at three different depths beneath the edge of the ingot (and hence three different cooling rates) [...] 60, 140 and 600 mm. The accuracy with which published microsegregation models are able to predict the solute distribution profile is assessed. It has been found that the magnesium segregation range (Cmax-Cmin) of the <b>grain</b> <b>refined</b> samples actually increases as cooling rate decreases. The range of the non <b>grain</b> <b>refined</b> samples is independent of cooling rate. The solute concentration profiles of the theoretical microsegregation models examined do not correlate well with the experimentally measured profiles.

A more accurate model of post solidification homogenisation is required to assess the relative contribution of each of these factors to the poor correlation.
