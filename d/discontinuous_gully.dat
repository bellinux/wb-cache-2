The {{suppression}} of wildfires {{has created the}} opportunities for catastrophic wildfires, which can increase suspended-sediment, stream temperature, stream flows, erosion and sedimentation in surrounding waterways. Burn Area Emergency Rehabilitation (BAER) has utilized {{a number of different}} treatments to minimize these effects following a wildfire. Induced meandering is a new concept that utilizes rock structures to promote the stabilization of incised degrading channels, by simulating river riffles, elevating channel bottoms, establishing channel slope, to encourage channel meander and the formation of an active floodplain. This project evaluates the effectiveness of rock baffles, one-rock dams, and aerial seeding in stabilizing an incised <b>discontinuous</b> <b>gully</b> channel post wildfire. The methods used to evaluate the effects of treatment include photo documentation, vegetation percent cover, cross-sectional measurements, streambed geology, and a riparian habitat assessment. Results of the photo documentation of the channel illustrate that meandering is clearly happening, while cross-sectional data suggests the channel has stabilized. Vegetation percent cover and streambed geology support these findings. Photo documentation and vegetation percent ground cover suggest that aerial seeding on the upland slopes was successful. The riparian habitat assessment confirms that gullies are not suitable riparian habitat. Continued monitoring, research and understanding of induced meandering and other rehabilitation treatments are needed to provide the best possible treatment of post wildfires...|$|E
40|$|Bank erosion {{rates and}} {{processes}} across {{a range of}} spatial scales are poorly understood in most environments, especially in the seasonally wet tropics of northern Australia where sediment yields are among global minima. A total of 177 erosion pins was installed at 45 sites on four sand-bed streams (Tributaries North and Central, East Tributary and Ngarradj) in the Ngarradj catchment in the Alligator Rivers Region. Bank erosion was measured for up to 3 · 5 years (start of 1998 / 99 wet season to end of 2001 / 02 wet season) at three spatial scales, namely a <b>discontinuous</b> <b>gully</b> (0 · 6 km²) that was initiated by erosion of a grass swale between 1975 and 1981, a small continuous channel (2 · 5 km²) on an alluvial fan that was formed by incision of a formerly discontinuous channel between 1964 and 1978, and three medium-sized, continuous channels (8 · 5 - 43 · 6 km²) with riparian vegetation. The bank erosion measurements during a period of average to above-average rainfall established that substantial bank erosion occurred during the wet season on the two smaller channels by rapid lateral migration (Tributary Central) and by erosion of gully sidewalls due to a combination of within-gully flows and overland flow plunging over the sidewalls (Tributary North). Minor bank erosion also occurred during the dry season by faunal activity, by desiccation and loss of cohesion of the sandy bank sediments and by dry flow processes. The larger channels with riparian vegetation (East Tributary and Ngarradj) did not generate significant amounts of sediment by bank erosion. Deposition (i. e. negative pin values) was locally significant at all scales. Bank profile form and channel planform exert a strong control on erosion rates during the wet season but not during the dry season...|$|E
40|$|Gully erosion is a {{degradation}} process affecting soils {{in many parts}} of the World. Despite the complexity of a series of collective factors across different spatial scales, previous research has not yet explicitly quantified factor dominance between different sized gullies. This factorial analysis quantifies the differences in factor dominance between continuous and <b>discontinuous</b> <b>gullies.</b> First, gullies (totaling 5 273 ha) visible from SPOT 5 imagery were mapped for a catchment (nearly 5 000 km 2) located in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa. Eleven important factors were integrated into a geographical information system including topographical variables, parent material-soil associations and land use-cover interactions. These were utilized in a zonal approach in order to determine the extent factors differ between continuous and <b>discontinuous</b> <b>gullies.</b> Factors leading to the development of continuous gullies are gentle footslopes in zones of saturation along drainage paths with a large contributing area, erodible duplex soils derived from mudstones, and poor vegetation cover due to overgrazing. Compared to continuous <b>gully</b> conditions, more <b>discontinuous</b> <b>gullies</b> occur on rolling slopes where the surface becomes less frequently saturated with a smaller contributing area, soils are more stable and shallow. Factorial analysis further illustrates that differences in factor dominance between the two groups of gullies is most apparent for soil factors. A combination of overgrazing and susceptible mudstones proves to be key factors that consistently determine the development of continuous and <b>discontinuous</b> <b>gullies...</b>|$|R
40|$|The recent {{development}} of <b>discontinuous</b> <b>gullying</b> {{appears to be}} largely due to clearing of the natural floodplain vegetation {{in the first half}} of the 19 th century although climatic factors may have contributed in a minor way. Rate of headcut migration is related to the frequency of flood flows. which in turn is a function of the frequency of occurrence of large rains. The upward trend in the number of small rains at least since 1915 is thought to have reduced sediment yields through its beneficial influence on the catchment vegetation and may be another factor favouring acclerated erosion of the floodplain. In future studies of unstable stream channels in alluvial deposits a distinction should be made between continuous trenches and <b>discontinuous</b> <b>gullies.</b> When discussing the effect Of vegetation changes on stream behaviour a distinction should always be made between the vegetation of the catchment slopesandi that of theffnodplaln or alluvial fan in which the channel under study is situated since the same change in both may have opposite effects on the behaviour of the stream...|$|R
40|$|Fans, in {{association}} with hillslope gullies and badlands {{and their impact on}} the catchment sediment cascade, slope-channel connectivity and local landscape evolution, have been reported in diverse geomorphic environments. However, research on the development and morphodynamics of gully fans {{is still in its infancy}} in South Africa. An investigation was undertaken in mid-slope <b>discontinuous</b> <b>gullies</b> in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa using field surveys and sediment source fingerprinting techniques to establish the dynamics of fan systems and their impacts on-slope sediments. Findings showed that a sediment core collected from the upper region of the fan was composed mainly of sediment mobilised from subsurface sources, whereas that from the lower region of the fan consisted mostly of sediment from surface sources. 137 Cs data were consistent with the sediment source fingerprinting results, confirming the respective surface and subsurface origins of the sediment in the sampled cores. Additionally, 137 Cs pointed to the recent formation of the fan. Geomorphic reconstruction of the fan did not support a cut and fill mode of gully fan development. Rather, the fan formed as a consequence of <b>discontinuous</b> <b>gullies</b> in the mid-slope leading to on-slope sediment deposition and slope-channel decoupling. It was also observed that hillslope sediment storage in the gully fan is temporally variable. Changes in the balance of morphodynamic processes may lead to sediment flushing and slope-channel coupling...|$|R
40|$|Gully erosion {{phenomena}} {{are very}} common in Ethiopia. They affect large areas with different morphological, pedological and climatic characteristics. The amount of soil loss due to gullying has become {{a very serious problem}} in the recent decades as it was associated to remarkable depletion of cultivated land. Field investigations on gully morphology and its genetic processes were carried out in two study areas of Ethiopia, representative of different geo-environmental conditions: the Lakes Region in the Rift portion north of Shashamene and the area surrounding the town of Mekele in Tigray. Two main types of gullies were identified {{on the basis of their}} morphological and hydraulic geometry characteristics: (1) <b>discontinuous</b> <b>gullies</b> which generally develop on low gradient slopes (1 – 5 j on average) and the hydraulic radius of which increases from an upstream minimum to a maximum, at approximately their mid length, and decreases again to a relative minimum at their downstream end; and (2) stream gullies, formed by deep erosion processes typically migrating upslope. In order to investigate the main causes originating the different types of gullies, shear stress data were collected in the field from their hydraulic geometry. Hypotheses on the mechanisms responsible for both <b>discontinuous</b> and stream <b>gullies</b> development and for their different characteristics are discussed considering the pattern of shear stress variation in the downstream direction...|$|R
40|$|Online publication: [URL] piping (tunnel erosion) {{has been}} {{recognised}} {{as an important}} erosion process in collapsible loess-derived soils of temperate humid climates, which can cause collapse of the topsoil and formation of <b>discontinuous</b> <b>gullies.</b> Information about the spatial patterns of collapsed pipes and regional models describing these patterns is still limited. Therefore, this study aims at better understanding the factors controlling the spatial distribution and predicting pipe collapse. A dataset with parcels suffering from collapsed pipes (n = 560) and parcels without collapsed pipes was obtained through a regional survey in a 236 km² study area in the Flemish Ardennes (Belgium). Logistic regression was applied {{to find the best}} model describing the relationship between the presence/absence of a collapsed pipe and a set of independent explanatory variables (i. e. slope gradient, drainage area, distance-to-thalweg, curvature, aspect, soil type and lithology). Special attention was paid to the selection procedure of the grid cells without collapsed pipes. Apart from the first piping susceptibility map created by logistic regression modelling, a second map was made based on topographical thresholds of slope gradient and upslope drainage area. The logistic regression model allowed identification of the most important factors controlling pipe collapse. Pipes {{are much more likely to}} occur when a topographical threshold depending on both slope gradient and upslope area is exceeded in zones with a sufficient water supply (due to topographical convergence and/or the presence of a clay-rich lithology).

40|$|Two {{methods of}} {{monitoring}} soil redistribution along agroterraces were explored in Tarina basin of the Moldavian Plateau: the classical method of annual or periodic field measurements and the 137 C technique. Results obtained by both methods {{indicate that the}} aggradation rate of the agroterrace edge averages 5. 0 - 6. 0 cm/yr, but the 137 C technique is more efficient because it requires only one field visit. Much of the dow n ward movement of soil in these agroterraces {{can be related to}} contour ploughing, although some erosion/deposition undoubtedly occurs. The future of using 137 C as a tracer of erosion and sedimentation within <b>discontinuous</b> <b>gullies</b> is promising. Some results obtained in the Moldavian Plateau near Barlad support this assumption. A field study, based on a depth - incremental sampling method, was undertaken in two small basins, Roscani and Timbru. Depth distribution of 137 Cs from recent sediments deposited along the floor of dis-continuous gullies allowed the establishment of a mean sedimentation rate of 4. 4 cm/yr over the period 1963 - 1996, and 2. 5 cm/yr after 1986 for short gullies. In the case of long gullies, after the Chernobyl nuclear accident this value is to 4. 9 cm/year. Furthermore, it was possible to estimate: the age of the gullies (23 - 48 years), the mean gully head advance (0. 9 m/yr), the mean total mass of sediment deposited/ eroded within the gully system (up to 124 t/yr) and the main sediment source (the active gully head and banks). Conservation practices and tillage were first implemented during 1982 - 1983 in the upper Racatau basin of 3, 912 hectares. Significant changes in land management practices resulted from the application of the Landed Property Law no. 18 / 1991. The marked shifting from contour to up and down hill farming created a doubling in the amount of soil erosion and deposition. Depth distribution of 137 Cs in recent sediments of the Bibiresti reservoir indicates a mean sedimentation rate of 5. 0 cm/yr over the period 1986 - 1992 and 10. 0 cm/yr for the period 1993 - 1996...|$|R
40|$|Portion of abstract]: Sediment {{dynamics}} {{are influenced}} by transformed landscape connectivity in catchments worldwide. The upper Thina catchment, an important high rainfall resource in the northern Eastern Cape, South Africa, {{is an example of}} where ongoing subsistence farming on communal land has led to overgrazing and trampling that has initiated large erosive features (e. g. gullies) and river incision. The formation of gullies led to increased hillslope-channel connectivity and the resultant river incision decreased the channel-valley fill connectivity. These two changes in connectivity led to increased sediment export from the catchment that has various down-stream ecological and socio-economic impacts. This study investigates how the change in hillslope-channel and channel-valley fill connectivity has altered the sediment dynamics in the Vuvu catchment, a headwater tributary of the Thina River. A combination of methods were used to assess the changes in hillslope-channel and channel-valley fill connectivity. High resolution aerial images were used to map source features, such as fields, gullies, sheet erosion, landslides, roads and livestock tracks. Topographic and geological characteristics of the source features were extracted using a Geographic Information System. Furthermore, hillslope-channel pathways, such as the natural drainage network, continuous <b>gullies,</b> <b>discontinuous</b> <b>gullies,</b> roads and livestock tracks were mapped and analysed in terms of topographic and geological characteristics. Historic aerial images were assessed to calculate the date the larger gullies began forming. Recent aerial photos and cross sectional surveys of the valley fill were combined to map the various sediment sinks. Particle size and organic content were analysed for flood bench cores and terrace samples. The chronology of the flood benches was determined using unsupported Pb- 210 and Cs- 137 dating, and determined for the terraces using Optically Stimulated Luminescence dating. Quantitative and qualitative sediment tracing approaches, using mineral magnetic properties, were used to trace the origin of suspended sediment (collected during flood events), sediment stored in the flood benches and sediment stored in the terraces. Hydrological monitoring was used to assess the potential to store sediment on flood benches along the valley fill through flood bench inundation frequency. Hydrological and hydraulic modelling extended the measured inundation frequencies to a 73 year period and other cross sections along the valley fill. Furthermore, a future scenario of an increased vegetation cover and reduced hillslope-channel connectivity was assessed in terms of channel-valley fill inundation frequency...|$|R

The dominant factors of sheetwash are rainfall intensity and soil surface cover, the latter being controlled by rainfall amounts and livestock density. The <b>discontinuous</b> valley bottom <b>gullies</b> present a complex relationship with catchment hydrology. Giving the high temporal variability of sediment losses, the influence of livestock on gully erosion is difficult to determine with short-term studies.

40|$|Soil erosion is a {{major problem}} confronting land and water {{resources}} {{in many parts of the}} world and the spatial extent should be assessed and continually monitored. The combination of existing erosion models and remote sensing techniques within a Geographical Information System framework is commonly utilized for erosion risk assessment. In most countries, however, especially in developing countries such as South Africa, there is still an absence of standardized methodological frameworks that deliver comparable results across large areas as a baseline for regional scale monitoring. Assessment at the regional scale is often problematic due to spatial variability of the factors controlling erosion and the lack of input and validation data. Due to limitations of scale at which techniques can be applied and processes assessed, this study implemented a multi-process and multi-scale approach to support establishment of a methodological framework for South African conditions. The approach includes assessment of (i) sheet-rill erosion at a national scale based on the principles and components defined in the (Revised) Universal Soil Loss Equation, (ii) gully erosion in a large catchment located in the Eastern Cape Province by integrating eleven important factors into a GIS, and (iii) sediment migration for a research catchment near Wartburg in KwaZulu-Natal by means of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool. Case Study i illustrates that 20 % (26 million ha) of South African land is classified as having a moderate to severe actual erosion risk (emphasizing sheet-rill erosion) and describes the challenges to be overcome in assessment at this scale. Case Study ii identifies severe gully erosion affecting an area of approximately 5 273 ha in the large catchment (Tsitsa valley) of the Eastern Cape Province and highlights gully factors likely to emerge as dominant between continuous <b>gullies</b> and <b>discontinuous</b> <b>gullies.</b> Case Study iii illustrates that a cabbage plot in the upper reaches of a research catchment near Wartburg is a significant sediment source, but is counterbalanced by sinks (river channel and farm dams) downstream. Model assumptions affecting outputs in the context of connectivity between sources and sinks are described. The factor-based nature of this multi-process and -scale approach allowed scrutiny of the role of the main factors in contributing to erosion risk. A combination of poor vegetation cover and susceptible parent material-soil associations are confirmed as the overriding factors in South Africa, and not topography and rainfall as frequently determined in the USA and Europe. A methodological framework with three hierarchical levels is then presented for South Africa. The framework illustrates the most feasible erosion assessment techniques and input datasets for which sufficient spatial information exists, and emphasizes simplicity required for application at a regional scale with proper incorporation of the most important factors. The framework is not interpreted as a single assessment technique but rather as an approach that guides the selection of appropriate techniques and datasets according to the complexity of the erosion processes and scale dependency. It is useful in determining the relative impact of different land use and management scenarios, as well as for comparative purposes under possible future climate change scenarios.
