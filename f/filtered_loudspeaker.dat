40|$|A phantom {{sound source}} {{is a virtual}} sound image which can be {{utilized}} in many applications like stereo base widening, multimedia, and virtual reality engines. Generation of such a virtual sound image using adaptive filters that employ the filtered-x NLMS algorithm is discussed. Such filters are long and complex for the virtual source to cover the whole audio frequency range. Due to this complexity, real-time implementation on a sampleby -sample basis is not possible and block processing techniques, such as block frequency domain adaptive filters, have to be used. Several optimized versions of the filtered-x algorithm in frequency domain are derived and the different implementations are compared.

30|$|In a {{full-duplex}} speech communication system, {{the occurrence}} of acoustic echoes resulting from the coupling between loudspeakers and microphones has to be avoided. For the proposed system where Q speech applications may be active in parallel, M multi-channel echo cancellation structures are needed each having as many adaptive <b>filters</b> as <b>loudspeaker</b> channels are used by the application. To solve the echo cancellation problem, the related reference signals of the Q different and uncorrelated far-end partners or systems are directly accessible. The topic of stereo- and multi-channel acoustic echo cancellation and the presentation of efficient solutions is not {{within the scope of}} this contribution, but further details can be found in[17, 18].|$|R
40|$|Sound zone {{reproduction}} facilitates listeners {{wishing to}} consume personal audio content {{within the same}} acoustic enclosure by <b>filtering</b> <b>loudspeaker</b> signals to create constructive and destructive interference in different spatial regions. Published solutions to the sound zone problem are derived from areas such as sound field synthesis and beamforming. The first contribution of this thesis is a comparative study of multi-point approaches. A new metric of planarity is adopted to analyse the spatial distribution {{of energy in the}} target zone, and the well-established metrics of acoustic contrast and control effort are also used. Simulations and experimental results demonstrate {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} the approaches. Energy cancellation produces good acoustic contrast but allows very little control over the target sound field; synthesis-derived approaches precisely control the target sound field but produce less contrast. Motivated by the limitations of the existing optimization methods, the central contribution of this thesis is a proposed optimization cost function ‘planarity control’, which maximizes the acoustic contrast between the zones while controlling sound field planarity by projecting the target zone energy into a spatial domain. Planarity control is shown to achieve good contrast and high target zone planarity over a large frequency range. The method also has potential for reproducing stereophonic material in the context of sound zones. The remaining contributions consider two further practical concerns. First, judicious choice of the regularization parameter is shown to have a significant effect on the contrast, effort and robustness. Second, attention is given to the problem of optimally positioning the loudspeakers via a numerical framework and objective function. The simulation and experimental results presented in this thesis represent a significant addition to the literature and will influence the future choices of control methods, regularization and loudspeaker placement for personal audio. Future systems may incorporate 3 D rendering and listener tracking...|$|R

The microphone signal is delivered from {{the microphone and}} the loudspeaker signal {{is sent to the}} loudspeaker. A unit (50) determines a property of a transmission channel in the surroundings between loudspeaker (13) and microphone (10) using the test- and microphone signals. A filter (40) <b>filters</b> the <b>loudspeaker</b> signal or the inserted signal, producing a filtered signal. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The filter is adjustable in its characteristics, in response to the determination (50), to match the transmission channel characteristics appropriately. A subtracter removes the filtered signal from the microphone signal, reducing feedback. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for the corresponding method and computer program product. USE - Equipment preventing speaker-microphone feedback in ambient surroundings. ADVANTAGE - The method improves on earlier concepts. Pitch-shifting techniques used to prevent the stable additive feedback which causes oscillation, are avoided.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we present}} a new {{approach}} to acoustic echo cancellation and doubletalk detection for a teleconferencing system including a loudspeaker for which an estimate of the loud-speaker impulse response is available. The approach is general {{in the sense that it}} may be applied to most existing acoustic echo can-cellation and doubletalk detection algorithms. We show that the new approach reduces the computational complexity for both the echo cancellation and the doubletalk detection algorithms. Fur-thermore, the numerical examples show that the new approach also may increase the echo cancellation and doubletalk detection per-formances.

30|$|An {{acoustic}} echo cancellation structure {{with a single}} loudspeaker and multiple microphones is, from a system identification perspective, generally modelled as a single-input multiple-output system. Such a system thus implies specific echo-path models (adaptive <b>filter)</b> for every <b>loudspeaker</b> to microphone path. Due to the often large dimensionality of the filters, which is required to model rooms with standard reverberation time, the adaptation process can be computationally demanding. This paper presents a selective updating normalized least mean square (NLMS)-based method which reduces complexity to nearly half in practical situations, while showing superior convergence speed performance as compared to conventional complexity reduction schemes. Moreover, the method concentrates the filter adaptation to the filter which is most misadjusted, which is a typically desired feature.|$|R
40|$|Loudspeaker {{systems are}} quite complex devices and {{considered}} ‘musical instruments’ for many HiFi-enthusiasts. However, from the technical {{point of view}} the description of an optimal loudspeaker seems to be simple: the reproduction of any electrical input signal {{in such a way}} that the acoustical output looks the same with respect to the waveform. Unfortunately, the demands to reach this task are manifold and very often when fulfilling one requirement problems arise with other demands. A typical one is that with only one transducer it is rather impossible to reproduce the entire frequency spectrum in a satisfying manner and with sufficient output. Therefore several transducers may be used with specific capabilities in low mid or high frequency range. In consequence the frequency content of the input signal needs to be distributed in a correct way so to insure that the overall output of the loudspeaker system fulfills the above mentioned requirement. The technical solution for this is the so-called crossover network. Since several years audio goes digital and the possibilities in creating crossover networks have become more flexible with digital filter design. Digital IIR and FIR filter design is well established, but a simple treatment of analog <b>filter</b> concepts in <b>Loudspeaker</b> Crossover Design (from analog to digital) digital domain would not help to improve the reproduction of a loudspeaker. Therefore new concepts with digital filters are required. In this talk we will firstly discuss the general filter strategies (either analog or digital) for loudspeakers. Then we will introduce both methods – IIR and FIR <b>filter</b> - for <b>loudspeaker</b> crossover design in digital domain. The advantages and some disadvantages will be addressed as well. A real word example will finally show what is possible when making the optimum use of the system...|$|R
40|$|By {{the use of}} {{cross-talk}} cancellation techniques, it {{is possible}} to reproduce binaural audio with loudspeakers. One drawback of such systems is that they have a very narrow sweet-spot, which constraints the listener to be in a specific position with respect to loudspeakers. As to overcome this difficult, a formulation has been developed that adapts the cross-talk cancellation <b>filters</b> of a <b>loudspeaker</b> array to the listener´s position, which is estimated by means of a computer vision head- tracking system. To perform the adaptation, the cross-talk cancellation filters are decomposed into a series of gain-delay individual elements to control the radiation pattern of the loudspeaker array and a finite impulse response (FIR) equalisation filter. The formulation has been implemented in a loudspeaker array consisting of 28 small-size radiators, allowing a sweet-spot-free binaural reproduction for a single listener. <br/...|$|R
40|$|The {{advent of}} digital storage of audio signals and the {{availability}} of high-speed digital signal processing devices facilitate the implementation of high-order <b>filter</b> functions for <b>loudspeaker</b> equalization. A method is presented for generating a digital model of a loudspeaker system from which an efficient compensation filter using an IIR structure is derived.

40|$|Methods for {{beamforming}} {{are available}} {{that provide the}} signals used to drive an array of sources {{for the implementation of}} systems for the so-called personal audio. In this work, performance of the delay-and-sum (DAS) method and of three widely used methods for optimal beamforming are compared by means of computer simulations and experiments in an anechoic environment using a linear array of sources with given constraints on quality of the reproduced field at the listener's position and limit to input energy to the array. Using the DAS method as a benchmark for performance, the frequency domain responses of the <b>loudspeaker</b> <b>filters</b> can be characterized in three regions. In the first region, at low frequencies, input signals designed with the optimal methods are identical and provide higher directivity performance than that of the DAS. In the second region, performance of the optimal methods are similar to the DAS method. The third region starts above the limit due to spatial aliasing. A method is presented to estimate the boundaries of these regions...|$|R
40|$|Nineteen normal-hearing {{university}} undergraduates {{performed an}} "objective" and a "subjective" test of speech intelligibility accuracy (SIA), speed (SIS) and ease (SIE) for {{different levels of}} low-pass filtered speech. During objective testing subjects listened to monosyllabic words low-pass filtered through an earphone, and repeated words as correctly and quickly as possible. They simultaneously turned off a probe light {{as quickly as possible}} whenever it appeared. Objective SIA was assessed as percentage of incorrectly-repeated phonemes, objective SIS as elapsed time between word presentation and a subject's voice response, and objective SIE as probe-reaction time to turning off the light. During subjective testing subjects listened to common sentences low-pass <b>filtered</b> through a <b>loudspeaker</b> in a background of competing speech. Subjective SIA, SIS and SIE were assessed using magnitude estimation in which subjects assigned numbers to how accurately, quickly or easily they understood the sentences. The most important finding was generally improved accuracy, speed and ease of objectively- and subjectively-measured speech intelligibility with decreased filtering. The experimenter further analyzed results by determining how well each measure of SIA, SIS and SIE met assumptions of test sensitivity, selectivity, reliability, convergence, discriminability and sufficiency. Overall, the objective SIA measure best met assumptions, followed by the three subjective measures, the objective SIS measure, and the objective SIE measure. Results have clinical and research implications for testing and understanding normal and impaired speech intelligibility and perception. First, results are encouraging for audiologists who use objective SIA and subjective measures to test speech intelligibility of their patients. Second, results suggest that persons listening to degraded speech, or persons with auditory problems, may have difficulties in SIS and SIE as well as problems already documented for SIA. Accordingly, audiologists should consider SIS and SIE during audiologic evaluations, aural rehabilitation, and auditory research. Finally, a few subjects showed exceptionally fast voice-response and probe-reaction times which has implications for understanding the nature and limits of human auditory processing...|$|R
30|$|In this paper, {{different}} tap selection {{schemes for}} constrained partial updates of subband MAEC filters have been compared. Real-world multichannel signals have been analyzed and {{shown to be}} sparse across subbands (spectrally), channels (spatially), and frames (temporally). This sparsity is then exploited by different tap selection schemes for updating the MAEC filters. The MAEC system consists of a dedicated subband AEC <b>filter</b> for each <b>loudspeaker</b> channel, with each filter composed of multiple sub-filters, i.e., one sub-filter per subband per channel. The first tap selection scheme considered applied the well-known M-Max criterion on the multichannel input spectra across all three dimensions, and is hence called the 3 DM scheme. This scheme jointly exploits the spectral, spatial and temporal sparsity in the input signals but typically results in some sub-filters having no taps updated. In order to avoid this problem, two new schemes have been presented which perform tap selection by applying the M-Max criterion only across filter length (and thereby exploit temporal sparsity for updating each sub-filter) and do not completely ignore the sub-filters with the smallest magnitude tap-inputs. The FEA scheme allocates a fixed number of taps to be updated in each sub-filter per frame, while the proposed DEA scheme exploits the joint spectro-spatial sparsity present in the input signals for dynamically allocating the number of taps to be updated in the different sub-filters. The new tap selection schemes have been compared to the state-of-the-art SPU tap selection scheme in the subband domain, which displays similar properties to the 3 DM scheme. The proposed DEA scheme is designed such that it selects more taps in the sub-filters with larger magnitude tap-inputs (like the 3 DM and SPU schemes) while not completely ignoring the sub-filters with smaller magnitude tap-inputs (like the FEA scheme). Simulation results for speech and music signals showed {{that in terms of}} ERLE and convergence speed, the 3 DM and DEA schemes achieved almost identical echo cancellation performance compared to full filter update even when only 20 % of the MAEC filter taps were updated in every frame, while the FEA and SPU schemes performed worse (about 2 – 4 dB and 10 – 12 dB deterioration in ERLE, respectively). The SPU, FEA and DEA tap selection schemes have a reduced computational cost compared to full filter update, while the 3 DM scheme does not necessarily lead to reduction in computational complexity. Hence, in conclusion, the proposed DEA tap selection scheme yields almost identical echo cancellation performance compared to updating all filter taps at a significantly reduced computational cost.|$|R
