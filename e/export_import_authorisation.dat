To ascertain robustness, <b>exports</b> and <b>imports</b> measured in current prices but in two currencies, Indian rupee and US dollar have been analyzed. Moreover, since the sample comprises data from both the fixed and freely floating exchange rate periods, the tests have also been performed allowing for a one-time structural break in 1992 / 93. The results indicate no-cointegration between <b>exports</b> and <b>imports.</b> The lack of cointegration means that Indian macroeconomic policies have been ineffective in bringing <b>exports</b> and <b>imports</b> into long-run equilibrium and India is in violation of her international budget constraint. <b>Export,</b> <b>Import,</b> Cointegration, India...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the cointegration and causality among exchange rate, <b>export,</b> and <b>import</b> for Turkey {{during the period}} of 1998 - 2006. The econometrics results show that there is a cointegration between <b>exports</b> and <b>import,</b> but direction of causality is bi-directional between these two variables. The impulse response functions also supports that there is a trade-off between exports and imports; for example, when imports are high, there is smaller exports at that time. This study supports few investigators who find no negative effect of exchange rate volatility on trade volume since it is found that exchange rates cannot determine the variation in <b>exports</b> and <b>imports.</b> <b>Export,</b> <b>Import,</b> Exchange Rate, Cointegration, and Impulse Response Function...|$|R
