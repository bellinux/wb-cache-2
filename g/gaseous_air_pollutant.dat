40|$|Although {{particulate}} {{air pollution}} {{has been associated with}} increased numbers of daily deaths in dozens of cities around the world, issues still remain about the association. Some have questioned the complex modeling used to control for season in Poisson regression or the role of <b>gaseous</b> <b>air</b> <b>pollutants</b> as potential confounders of the association. I examined the association between deaths and particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter ≤ 10 µm (PM 10) using a case–crossover design. In this approach, the pollution on the day of each death is contrasted with the pollution level on control days when the subject did not die. Season and <b>gaseous</b> <b>air</b> <b>pollutants</b> were controlled by matching. Control days were chosen within the same month of the same year to control for season, and matched on either sulfur dioxide (SO 2; within 1 ppb), nitrogen dioxide (within 1 ppb), maximum ozone (within 2 ppb), or carbon monoxide (within 0. 03 ppm). The analysis was conducted in 14 U. S. cities that have daily PM 10 monitoring. After matching, there were about 400, 000 deaths in each analysis. Results were combined across cities using a maximum likelihood method. PM 10 {{was a significant predictor of}} mortality when controlling for <b>gaseous</b> <b>air</b> <b>pollutants,</b> with effect sizes ranging from a 0. 45 % increase per 10 µg/m 3 increment of PM 10 [95 % confidence interval (CI), 0. 12 – 0. 79 %] when matched on maximum hourly ozone levels, to a 0. 81 % increase per 10 µg/m 3 increment of PM 10 (95 % CI, 0. 47 – 1. 16 %) when matched on 24 -hr average SO 2.

40|$|Nitric oxide is a <b>gaseous</b> <b>air</b> <b>pollutant</b> {{which is}} a {{precursor}} to nitrogen oxides and in the atmosphere it reacts chemically with gaseous hydrocarbons to form other photochemical contaminants such as ozone (O 3), peroxyacetal nitrate (PAN) and other photochemical oxidants. Non thermal plasma methods namely, electron beam and dielectric barrier discharge have been studied as promising methods to control NO/ NOx. Basically both methods run as plasma oxidation process where excited electrons produce radicals that will oxidize the targeted pollutants. Investigations using the electron beam flue gas treatment indicate that processing temperature, moisture content, beam current and radiation dose are the important parameters in determining the removal efficiency of nitric oxides. Removal efficiency of 90 % was obtained by providing absorbed dose of 14 kGy, and by keeping the humidity of the flue gases at the inlet, to about 13 % v/v and temperature around 70 °C. Experiments using the DBD reactor were carried out at room temperature using different mixtures of gases.

Strong correlations among numerous ambient pollutant concentrations, however, {{have made it}} difficult to determine the relative contribution of each pollutant to a given health outcome and have led to criticism that health effect estimates for particulate matter may be biased due to confounding. In the current study we used data collected from a multipollutant exposure study conducted in Baltimore, Maryland, during both the summer and winter to address the potential for confounding further. Twenty-four-hour personal exposures and corresponding ambient concentrations to fine particulate matter (PM 2. 5), ozone, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and carbon monoxide were measured for 56 subjects.

Exposure to <b>gaseous</b> <b>air</b> <b>pollutants,</b> even at a low level, has been associated with cardiorespiratory diseases (Vedal, Brauer et al. 2003). Most recent epidemiological studies of air pollution have used time-series analyses to explore the relationship between daily mortality or morbidity and daily ambient air pollution concentrations based on the same day or previous days (Hajat, Armstrong et al. 2007). However, most of the previous studies have examined the association between air pollution and health outcomes using air pollution data from a single monitoring site or average values from a few monitoring sites to represent the whole population of the study area. In fact, for a metropolitan city, ambient air pollution levels may differ significantly among the different areas.

Ascorbic and dehydroascorbic acids, GSH and GSSG, superoxide dismutase, ascorbate peroxidase, dehydroascorbate reductase, GSSG reductase, GSH peroxidase, catalase, guaiacol peroxidase, chlorophylls, carotenoids, soluble protein and dry weight were measured in these leaves. The main differences between treated and control leaves were observed during the period 1100 - 1530 h and concerned superoxide dismutase, catalase, ascorbate peroxidase, ascorbate/dehydroascorbate and GSH/GSSG ratios, chlorophylls, carote-noids and dry weight. On {{the basis of the}} pollution climate observed at the experimental site on the day of leaves sampling, ozone appeared to be the causative agent of the observed divergences among the time patterns of antioxidants in treated and control plants. It was deduced that ozone can induce oxidative stress via the production of superoxide radical anion and hydrogen perox-ide.

40|$|WO 2008116654 A 1 UPAB: 20081018 NOVELTY - The {{detector}} has light sources e. g. infrared emitters (1 a, 1 b), {{for providing}} light having same intensities while retaining same spectral distribution. Beam paths are {{allocated to the}} light sources, where a different absorption of light occurs in the beam paths in selected wavelength regions. A polygonal mirror (4) alternately supplies {{the light from the}} beam paths to a photoacoustic measuring cell (6). The intensities of the light sources are constant such that temporal change of the light sources does not generate a photoacoustic signal, which distorts measurement of gas. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a method for determining concentration of an analyte in a photoacoustic measuring cell. USE - Photoacoustic detector for measuring and monitoring concentration of <b>gaseous</b> <b>air</b> <b>pollutants</b> in <b>air</b> or contaminants in a process gas and for determining concentration of an analyte in a photoacoustic measuring cell. ADVANTAGE - The detector is designed such that it has high selectivity for measurement of the gas even when broadband and inexpensive light sources are utilized...|$|R
40|$|Plants absorb <b>gaseous</b> <b>air</b> <b>pollutants</b> {{from the}} {{atmosphere}} through stomata. In this study, the absorption of CO_ 2, SO_ 2 and NO_ 2 by the vegetation classified into 11 categories based on land use was evaluated from the net and gross production, and the area of each vegetation in Sakai city divided into 48 sections. As a result, {{the distribution of the}} gas absorption rate per unit area showed the gradient from the south mountainous area to the northwest commercial and industrial area. The total annual absorption of CO_ 2, SO_ 2 and NO_ 2 by the vegetation in Sakai was estimated to be 87 kt, 66 t and 77 t, respectively. The absorption of SO_ 2 and NO_ 2 was equivalent to 9. 9 and 2. 0 % of the exhaustion from the major stationary sources in Sakai, respectively. Moreover the NO_ 2 absorption was equivalent to 0. 8 % of the total NO_ 2 exhaustion in Sakai. The vegetation in the tumuli in Sakai was the efficient sink of the gases, particularly NO_ 2...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT:This {{article has}} focused on <b>gaseous</b> <b>air</b> <b>pollutants</b> and its {{environmental}} effect-emitted from tanning industry during leather processing, especially in unhairing & liming, deliming, pickling and finishing operations in which hydrogen sulphide (H 2 S), ammonia (NH 3), chlorine (Cl 2) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are emitted respectively at Hazaribagh, Dhaka, Bangladesh. The toxic hydrogen sulphide (H 2 S) gas has negative effect at atmosphere {{by the process of}} photochemical reaction; it increases the greenhouse methane gas. In atmosphere, gaseous form of ammonia (NH 3) reacts with available acids and form their corresponding salts cause cloudiness and finally they return to earth surface by wet or dry deposition which effects on aquatic life. Workers in tanning industries are directly inhaled toxic chlorine gas suffers withvarious health complexities. Emission of VOCs isthe mostly formaldehyde and it is captured in photochemical oxidation by ozone as well as UV radiation. It’s an important precursor of smog formation where it reacts with oxides of nitrogen (NOx) including peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN); smog decreases the visibility in the urban area...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Most of the {{evidence}} regarding the association between particulate air pollution and emergency room visits or hospital admissions for respiratory conditions and asthma comes from the USA. European time-series analyses have suggested that <b>gaseous</b> <b>air</b> <b>pollutants</b> are important determinants of acute hospitalization for respiratory conditions, {{at least as important}} as particulate mass. The association between daily mean levels of suspended particles and gaseous pollutants (sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, ozone) was examined. The daily emergency hospital admissions for respiratory conditions in the metropolitan area of Rome during 1995 – 1997 were also recorded. Daily counts of hospital admissions for total respiratory conditions (43 admis-sions?day- 1), acute respiratory infections including pneumonia (18 ?day- 1), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (13 ?day- 1), and asthma (4. 5 ?day- 1) among residents of all ages and among children (0 – 14 yrs) were analysed. The generalized additive models included spline smooth functions of the day of study, mean temperature, mean humidity, influenza epidemics, and indicator variables for day of the week and holidays...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>gaseous</b> <b>air</b> <b>pollutants,</b> acidic {{deposition}} and mineral deficiency {{on the gas}} exchange of trees are reviewed, and published data which illustrate important responses are described in detail. Data are presented which show that mixtures of SO 2 plus NO 2 can decrease photosynthesis in Betula pendula, that ambient pollutant concentrations (especially O 3) tend to increase stomatal conductance of Populus deltoides X Populus nigra {{in the early part}} of the day for young growing leaves and throughout the day for mature leaves, and that simulated acid rain (pH 2. 8) can cause temporary increases of stomatal conductance. Data for forest sites indicate that ambient concentrations of <b>gaseous</b> <b>air</b> pollution are sufficient to alter the gas exchange of woody plants (Fagus sylvatica, Populus deltoides X Populus nigra, Picea sitchensis and Picea abies). Both inhibitions and stimulations of stomatal conductance have been observed, often associated with no effect or small depressions of photosynthesis. The link between stomatal response to gaseous pollutants and growth effects remains unclear. Initial exposure to wet deposited sulphates and nitrates often leads to stomatal opening while longterm exposure results in closure. Soil-mediated effects may be cumulative and operate via effects on nutrient supply and thus mesophyll characteristics and phloem loading...|$|R
