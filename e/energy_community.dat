The 1967 Merger (Brussels) Treaty led to all of ECSC's institutions to merge into that of the European Economic Community, but the ECSC retained its own independent legal personality. In 2002, the Treaty of Paris expired and the ECSC ceased to exist in any form, its activities fully absorbed by the European Community under the framework of Amsterdam and Nice treaties.|$|E
5|$|The termite gut has {{inspired}} various research efforts aimed at replacing fossil fuels with cleaner, renewable energy sources. Termites are efficient bioreactors, {{capable of producing}} two litres of hydrogen from a single sheet of paper. Approximately 200 species of microbes live inside the termite hindgut, releasing the hydrogen that was trapped inside wood and plants that they digest. Through the action of unidentified enzymes in the termite gut, lignocellulose polymers are broken down into sugars and are transformed into hydrogen. The bacteria within the gut turns the sugar and hydrogen into cellulose acetate, an acetate ester of cellulose on which termites rely for <b>energy.</b> <b>Community</b> DNA sequencing of the microbes in the termite hindgut has been employed to provide {{a better understanding of}} the metabolic pathway. Genetic engineering may enable hydrogen to be generated in bioreactors from woody biomass.|$|E
5|$|However the ECSC {{failed to}} achieve several {{fundamental}} aims of the Treaty of Paris. It was hoped the ECSC would prevent a resurgence of large coal and steel {{groups such as the}} Konzerne, which helped Adolf Hitler rise to power. In the Cold War trade-offs, the cartels and major companies re-emerged, leading to apparent price fixing (another element that was meant to be tackled). With a democratic supervisory system the worst aspects of past abuse were avoided with the anti-cartel powers of the Authority, the first international anti-cartel agency in the world. Efficient firms were allowed to expand into a European market without undue domination. Oil, gas, electricity became natural competitors to coal and also broke cartel powers. Furthermore, with the move to oil, the Community failed to define a proper energy policy. The Euratom treaty was largely stifled by de Gaulle and the European governments refused the suggestion of an <b>Energy</b> <b>Community</b> involving electricity and other vectors that was suggested at Messina in 1955. In a time of high inflation and monetary instability ECSC also fell short of ensuring an upward equalisation of pay of workers within the market. These failures could be put down to overambition {{in a short period of}} time, or that the goals were merely political posturing to be ignored. It has been argued that the greatest achievements of the European Coal and Steel Community lie in its revolutionary democratic concepts of a supranational Community.|$|E

Our analysis shows that configura- tional work combines off-the-shelf technologies with novel technical and non-technical ideas, such as business models for local energy provision, rather than endeavor clear-cut changes to existing devices. Such configurational work is deeply entangled with learning processes at the community level, whereby an evolving technical identity as well as var- ious community building activities provide a growing network of resources as necessary context for implementation of user innovations...|$|R

This paper provides {{an evaluation of}} how the Connecticut Clean <b>Energy</b> <b>Communities</b> program affects household decisions to voluntarily purchase “green” electricity, which is electricity generated from renewable sources of energy. The results suggest that, within participating communities, subsidizing municipal solar panels as matching grants for reaching green-electricity enrollment targets increases the number of household purchases by 35 percent. The Clean <b>Energy</b> <b>Communities</b> program thus demonstrates how mostly symbolic incentives can mobilize voluntary initiatives within communities and promote demand for renewable energy. ...|$|R
5|$|The {{creation}} in 1957 of the European Economic Community (EEC) and the European Atomic <b>Energy</b> <b>Community</b> (EAEC or Euratom) created new duplicate institutions to the ECSC (except for the Parliamentary Assembly and Court of Justice, which were shared). On 7 January 1958, {{it was decided}} that Brussels, Luxembourg, and Strasbourg would again be provisional venues until a final decision. Strasbourg would retain the Assembly, Luxembourg the Court and both Brussels and Luxembourg would host meetings of the Councils and Commissions (or High Authority). The discretion of the exact meeting place of the new Councils was given to the President of the Council. In practice, this was to be in the Château of Val-Duchesse until the autumn of 1958, at which point it would move to 2 Rue Ravensteinstraat in Brussels. Meanwhile, the ECSC Council was still based in Luxembourg, holding its meetings in the Cercle Municipal on Place d’Armes. Its secretariat moved within the city on numerous occasions, but between 1955 and 1967, it was housed in the Verlorenkost district.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Emerging {{smart grids}} have {{promising}} potentials to make energy management {{more efficient than}} currently possible in today’s power grids. Integration of small scale renewables, distributed charging of electrical vehicles and virtual power sta-tions {{are some of the}} technological innovations made possible by smart grids. Besides these technological aspects, smart grids also have a clear social component: consumers and small producers can together form <b>energy</b> <b>communities.</b> Such communities can be based on shared geographical location. They can also form based on shared values. This paper assumes that online social networks can be used to form virtual <b>energy</b> <b>communities</b> with shared values such as sustainability and social cohesion, sharing energy. We present an exploratory study on the creation and evolution of Smart Grid Social Networks using an agent-based simulation model. Initial simulation experiments show that in this context a large community with members that are occasionally active forms a better predictor for successful <b>energy</b> <b>communities</b> than a smaller community of very active users.

40|$|AbstractRenewable <b>energy</b> <b>communities</b> have multiplied {{the last}} years in many countries, even in {{contexts}} that the structural conditions are not favorable. The paper analyses individual motivations for partaking in local renewable projects and generating energy jointly in an investment community, in order to inform policy debates on how to support such communities. To do so, we applied a socio-psychological approach for studying renewable <b>energy</b> <b>communities</b> in Germany and the Netherlands. Our results show that mainly gain (such as decreasing energy costs) and normative (such as addressing climate change) considerations {{played a role in}} the decision, but in the background hedonic motivations were also present, such as having fun and integrating in a community. Each of the groups examined emerged in already existing strong communities, where trust was relatively high, which seems to be an important condition for the realization of local energy projects. Consequently, we argue that tailor-made incentives addressing the different types of motivations can be more effective for the support and spread of renewable <b>energy</b> <b>communities...</b>|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} paper {{focuses on the}} development of <b>community</b> and local <b>energy</b> projects in Finland and the UK. Finland has relatively little citizen-led <b>community</b> <b>energy</b> activity, but {{in the last few years}} small, innovative local projects have started to emerge. UK, on the other hand, has had a surge of interest in <b>community</b> <b>energy</b> for several years. This paper looks at <b>community</b> <b>energy</b> in the two countries through the eyes of four case studies, two in each country. These include citizen-led sustainable energy activities such as replacing fossil fuel based heating with renewables and developing local <b>energy</b> efficiency activities. <b>Community</b> <b>energy</b> is approached through strategic niche management theory and seen as a niche, a space within which innovative activity can take place, develop and potentially diffuse. Data from interviews with 12 <b>community</b> <b>energy</b> practitioners and 10 intermediary organisations are used to answer questions on what is a <b>community</b> <b>energy</b> niche and how do projects interact with that niche. The successful development of <b>community</b> <b>energy</b> projects is often down to several factors.

25|$|The {{resulting}} {{communities were}} the European Economic Community (EEC) and the European Atomic <b>Energy</b> <b>Community</b> (EURATOM or sometimes EAEC).

The first formal meeting of the Hallstein Commission was held on 16 January 1958 at the Chateau de Val-Duchesse. The EEC (direct ancestor of the modern Community) was to create a customs union while Euratom would promote co-operation in the nuclear power sphere. The EEC rapidly became {{the most important of these}} and expanded its activities. One of the first important accomplishments of the EEC was the establishment (1962) of common price levels for agricultural products.

In 1958 the Treaties of Rome had established two new communities alongside the ECSC: the European Economic Community (EEC) and the European Atomic <b>Energy</b> <b>Community</b> (Euratom). However their executives were called [...] "Commissions" [...] rather than [...] "High Authorities". The reason for the change in name was the new relationship between the executives and the Council.

500|$|Six {{years after}} the Treaty of Paris, the Treaties of Rome were signed by the six ECSC members, {{creating}} the European Economic Community (EEC) and the European Atomic <b>Energy</b> <b>Community</b> (EAEC or Euratom).

These two new Communities worked on the creation of a customs union and nuclear power community respectively. The Rome treaties were hurried through just before de Gaulle was given emergency powers and proclaimed the Fifth Republic. Despite his efforts to [...] "chloroform" [...] the Communities, their fields rapidly expanded and the EEC became the most important tool for political unification, overshadowing the ECSC.|$|E

As a whole, the Council only scrutinised the High Authority (the executive). In 1957, the Treaties of Rome established two new communities, and with them two new Councils: the Council of the European Atomic <b>Energy</b> <b>Community</b> (EAEC) and the Council of the European Economic Community (EEC).

40|$|Although in {{the last}} decades a {{transition}} toward a sustainable energy system with renewables has been advocated by many, it is still uncertain where the support and required investments for renewables can come from. In this article we introduce and analyze a special type of investor group: renewable <b>energy</b> <b>communities,</b> which are grassroots initiatives that invest in 'clean energy' {{in order to meet}} consumption needs and environmental goals and thereby – even unwittingly – conduce to the spread of renewables. The aim of the present study is to explore the potential of renewable <b>energy</b> <b>communities,</b> as social niches, to contribute to transitions in the energy system. To do so, we propose three indicators for measuring the transition potential of social niches, based on proxies for technological innovations derived from the literature. In addition, we reinterpret the notion of niches and the way transition occurs by arguing that niches are complex systems in which both technological and social innovations develop simultaneously and that during transition entire niches link up with the regime. Furthermore, we make a distinction between internally and externally oriented niches based on their orientation and application focus. Our results show that renewable <b>energy</b> <b>communities</b> in the Netherlands are internally oriented social niches that have the potential for upscaling and contribute to sustainability transitions. We use a comparative case study analysis complemented by a systematic literature and documentary review to show that these communities are already changing the Dutch energy system, by connecting to regime actors. Their further advancement depends on strengthening their links to established actors, but also on providing a favorable regulatory framework...|$|R
