40|$|The {{longevity}} of a pear orchard incomparison with an apple orchard is much longer. A 10 -year-old apple orchard {{is considered an}} old orchard with prob-lems of insufficient fruit quality (fruit size and/or fruit color) and should be replaced. A high density pear orchard {{at the age of}} 10 years is still a young orchard that comes into optimal productivity for a period of at least 20 years. The higher the plant density, the more difficult it will be to keep the orchard in the productive phase. In this paper we discuss different planting systems for high density pear orchards and the problems of excessive vegetative shoot growth that often occur during an “off ” year after frost damage. Crucial in the management of high densi-ty pear plantings is the definition of good flower bud quality with a high potential for fruit set. PLANT MATERIAL For pear trees planted in high density planting systems the quality of the planting material should be high. It should be a 2 -year-old tree with six to eight laterals ob-tained by pruning back the 1 -year-old trees in the fruit tree nursery. There is an impor-tant difference in productivity between a 1 -year-old <b>feathered</b> <b>tree</b> and a 2 -year-old <b>feathered</b> <b>tree</b> during the first year after planting. When a 1 -year-old whip is plant-ed, the productivity will be delayed by a pe-riod of 2 years during which the frame of the tree has to be developed. For intensive high density pear plantings only 2 -year-old trees are recommended. All the laterals should not be kept at the start but should be reduced to the final number wanted in the planting system, e. g., two in the free spin-dle or four in the V-hedge system. Delaying this reduction in number of laterals to a later date, when the trees are 4 to 5 years old, is risky and can cause a problem of a silver leaf attack. Many times this silver leaf attack is a reaction to a physiological stress situation (heavy pruning cuts) and cannot be related to the fungal attack of Stereum purpureum...|$|E

Assessment of yearly cropping, labor requirements, fruit quality, and orchard profitability were studied. The experiment was organized in a randomized complete block design with three replications.

40|$|Fruit growers prefer well <b>feathered</b> <b>trees</b> for {{planting}} intensive orchards. Besides nurseryman’s practices (pinching shoot tips or young leaves) plant bioregulators {{proved to be}} efficient in secondary shoot formation. Among them, benzyladenin (BA) is {{the most frequently used}} compound for lifting the dormancy of summer buds. Based on our trials secondary shoot formation and shoot growth can be achieved by BA and GA application on apple, cherry and plum nursery trees. However, the treatments are efficient, the result, e. g. growth of secondary shoot is variable year by year, which seemed to be in interaction with weather conditions and root potential of trees. In agriculture some biostimulators are used to improve root growth and due to this, the crop. Our intention was to test these biostimulators in combined application with BA. In order to improve the feathering of apple nursery trees in 2007 a trial was carried out on one-year-old ‘Idared’ on M. 9 and MM. 106 trees. Besides the usual BA application, three times Kelpak and Wuxal Ascofol were carried out on the growing scion shoot from May in two weeks intervals. In autumn before lifting the tree height, caliper, length of secondary shoots was measured and number of feathers was counted. Biostimulator Kelpak and the leaf fertilizer combined with biostimulator Wuxal Ascofol applied alone did not affect the shoot growth, albeit Kelpak improved the root quality and branching. Both biostimulators applied in combination with BA increased the number of feathers and the length of feathers (secondary shoots). Based on our results, the highest number and length of secondary shoots could be achieved by combined application of BA and Kelpak. To improve the results, further trials are needed to find optimal concentration and term of treatments...|$|R

50|$|Textiles were {{of extreme}} {{importance}} for Cholula’s economy. During the Postclassic period {{they were a}} common unit of tribute and exchange. Textiles were manufactured for local consumption and traded extensively by different merchants that frequented the city. Textile production accounts are provided by ethnohistorical and archaeological sources. Spanish writings from Colonial times have noted their excellence in dying techniques and ability to dye wool threads in diverse colors to produce a variety of textiles. Some of the materials they used were cotton, which was probably imported from the Gulf Coast or Southern Puebla, and maguey, <b>feathers,</b> rabbit fur, <b>tree</b> silk, milkweed, and human hair that were all locally found. Artifacts such as spindle whorls found at different Cholula site loci provide evidence for the extensive production of textiles in the site. These are rare from the Formative and the Classic periods but become more prevalent in the Postclassic. Only unbaked-clay whorls {{may have been used}} during the earlier periods but these are not preserved in the archaeological record. The high concentration of spindle whorls recovered from Cholula in comparison to other Mesoamerican sites attests to the important role they played in their economy.|$|R
40|$|The hormone {{corticosterone}} (CORT) helps {{mediate the}} relationship between birds and their environment. I studied nestling and adult birds in several diverse contexts to understand how sources of environmental variability contribute to variation in an integrated measure of CORT from <b>feathers.</b> 	In nestling <b>tree</b> swallows (Tachycineta bicolor), feather CORT {{was positively related to}} maximum nest box temperatures. Temperatures may not have been challenging for nestlings. Instead, CORT physiology was likely matched to nest box conditions. Experimentally-reduced provisioning resulted in significantly lower feather CORT in nestling Cory’s shearwaters (Calonectris diomedea), suggesting nestlings invoked an adaptive strategy of CORT suppression to cope with extended nutritional challenges. 	In adults, both enrichment and its removal from the cages of captive Clark’s nutcrackers (Nucifraga columbiana) resulted in significant increases in feather CORT, but this effect was a function of exposure time. In adult tree swallows, increased productivity was positively associated with CORT from feathers grown post-breeding. Although this effect likely reflected the increased energetic expense of raising more young, it could not be separated from individual quality. Traditional measures of habitat and spatial structure related to Dupont’s lark (Chersophilus duponti) population dynamics were not related to feather CORT. However, when ratios of stable isotopes of carbon (δ 13 C) were used as a proxy for environmental conditions, a significant negative relationship resulted between δ 13 C and feather CORT. This result suggests that combining feather-based measurements is a particularly strong approach to studying habitat-physiology relationships. 	Feather CORT quantified hormonal responses to ecological variability in general, rather than in response to any specific type(s) of challenges. A unifying theme of my work was that, when interpreted in proper context, feather CORT was apparently related to energetic demand or exertion. Feather CORT may therefore be a proxy for individual energetics. Building on this, I developed a conceptual model that helps explains how environmental and physiological variation delineates an “ecophysiological niche”, the boundaries of which define a range of CORT values that should contribute positively to fitness. My results suggest that feather CORT will likely be useful in moving both theoretical and applied research towards a more holistic perspective of avian ecophysiology...|$|R

You have often seen the sand on the seashore. How fine are its tiny grains! And how many of those tiny little grains go to make up the small handful which a child grasps in its play. Now imagine a mountain of that sand, a million miles high, reaching from the earth to the farthest heavens, and a million miles broad, extending to remotest space, and a million miles in thickness; and imagine such an enormous mass of countless particles of sand multiplied as often as there are leaves in the forest, drops of water in the mighty ocean, feathers on birds, scales on fish, hairs on animals, atoms in the vast expanse of the air: and imagine {{that at the end of}} every million years a little bird came to that mountain and carried away in its beak a tiny grain of that sand.

And no British ash, not even the Altyre giants, ever reached to half that bulk. It is a Silk-cotton tree; a Ceiba {79d}--say, rather, the Ceiba of the glen; for these glens have a habit of holding each one great Ceiba, which has taken its stand at the upper end, just where the mountain-spurs run together in an amphitheatre; and being favoured (it may be supposed) by the special richness of the down- washed soil at that spot, grows to one of those vast air-gardens of creepers and parasites of which we have so often read and dreamed. [...] Such a one is this: but we will not go up to it now. This sketch shall be completed by the background of green and gray, fading aloft into tender cobalt: the background of mountain, ribbed and gullied into sharpest slopes by the tropic rains, yet showing, even where steepest, never a face of rock, or a crag peeping through the trees. [...] Up to the sky-line, a thousand feet aloft, all is green; and that, instead of being, as in Europe, stone or moor, is jagged and <b>feathered</b> with gigantic <b>trees.</b> How rich! you would say. Yet these West Indians only mourn over its desolation and disfigurement; and point to the sheets of gray stems, which hang like mist along the upper slopes. They look to us, on this 30th of December, only as April signs that the woodlands have not quite burst into full leaf. [...] But to the inhabitants they are tokens of those fearful fires which raged over the island during the long drought of this summer; when the forests were burning for a whole month, and this house scarcely saved; when whole cane-fields, mills, dwelling-houses, went up as tinder and flame in a moment, and the smoky haze from the burning island spread far out to sea. And yet where the fire passed six months ago, all is now a fresh impenetrable undergrowth of green; creepers covering the land, climbing up and shrouding the charred stumps; young palms, like Prince of Wales's feathers, breaking up, six or eight feet high, among a wilderness of sensitive plants, scarlet-flowered dwarf Balisiers, {81a} climbing fern, {81b} convolvuluses of every hue, and an endless variety of outlandish leaves, over which flutter troops of butterflies. How the seeds of the plants and the eggs of the insects have been preserved, who can tell? But there their children are, in myriads; and ere a generation has passed, every dead gray stem will have disappeared before the ants and beetles and great wood-boring bees who rumble round in blue-black armour; the young plants will have grown into great trees beneath the immeasurable vital force which pours all the year round from the blazing sun above, and all be as it was once more. In verity we are in the Tropics, where the so-called 'powers of nature' are in perpetual health and strength, and as much stronger and swifter, for good and evil, than in our chilly clime, as is the young man in the heat of youth compared with the old man shivering to his grave.
