40|$|Based on the 6 D {{constraints}} of momentum change rate (CMCR), this paper puts forward a real-time and <b>full</b> balance <b>maintenance</b> method for the humanoid robot during high-speed movement of its 7 -DOF arm. First, the total momentum formula for the robot’s two arms is given and the momentum change rate {{is defined by}} the time derivative of the total momentum. The author also illustrates the idea of <b>full</b> balance <b>maintenance</b> and analyzes the physical meaning of 6 D CMCR and its fundamental relation to <b>full</b> balance <b>maintenance.</b> Moreover, discretization and optimization solution of CMCR has been provided with the motion constraint of the auxiliary arm’s joint, and the solving algorithm is optimized. The simulation results have shown the validity and generality of the proposed method on the <b>full</b> balance <b>maintenance</b> in the 6 DOFs of the robot body under 6 D CMCR. This method ensures 6 D dynamics balance performance and increases abundant ZMP stability margin. The resulting motion of the auxiliary arm has large abundance in joint space, and the angular velocity and the angular acceleration of these joints lie within the predefined limits. The proposed algorithm also has good real-time performance...|$|R
