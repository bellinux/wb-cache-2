[...] Mike Clark, of USA Today, gave the film {{three out of four}} stars, writing, [...] "Crystal is funny enough to keep Ryan from all-out stealing the film.

500|$|... "East to West" [...] is a {{contemporary}} Christian song lasting four minutes and 26 seconds. It {{was written in}} common time in the key of F minor at a tempo of 73 beats per minute. The vocal range in the song ranges from the low note of D4 to the high note of F5. Lyrically, [...] "East to West" [...] deals {{with the concept of}} forgiveness, and the doubt that God forgives and forgets all sin. Casting Crowns' lead vocalist Mark Hall explained that: [...] "We have a hard time with the concept of forgiveness. We cut ourselves and it heals, but the scar remains. Sometimes we think God treats sin like we would if we were God, and that <b>he</b> <b>handles</b> forgiveness like we would. We know he forgives, but we can't accept that God chooses to forget and relinquishes his right to avenge. That's what we're singing about in 'East To West'". In a separate interview, Hall elaborated on that theme, commenting that: [...] "I see forgiveness as God giving away His right to revenge in my life. He loved me so much that He’s choosing to remember that against me no more, all because of Jesus".|$|E

[...] Along the same lines, Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post gave the film three out of four stars, writing that it [...] "feels as fresh and bracingly exhilarating as the day Jack Sparrow first swashed his buckle, infusing new reckless energy into a franchise that shows no signs of furling its sails". She said that Marshall [...] "swiftly and without fuss delivers the action set pieces and eye-popping escapism" [...] and praised Depp, Cruz, and McShane's performances. Ray Bennett from The Hollywood Reporter considered that Marshall [...] "shows terrific flair with all the usual chases and sword fights, and <b>he</b> <b>handles</b> the 3D well", and welcomed Penélope Cruz's character, saying she [...] "brings her Oscar-winning vivacity" [...] and had [...] "lively sexual tension" [...] with Depp. Writing for The Globe and Mail, Rick Groen found the action scenes to range from [...] "merely competent to tritely cluttered", but he was pleased with the overall result, calling McShane a [...] "fresh villain" [...] whose [...] "stentorian tones are welcome anywhere". Variety's Andrew Barker considered the film derivative, but accessible. [...] "It has nary an original idea and still doesn't make much sense, but it's lost all pretensions that it should". He praised Geoffrey Rush, stating that he [...] "not only gets the funniest lines and reaction shots, but also starts to siphon away much of the roguish charm that used to be Depp's stock and trade." ...|$|E

Michele has such a beautiful voice; I wish she was given songs that would allow her to showcase it to her advantage." [...] Katie Morgan of Billboard gave a positive review of the Warblers' performance of [...] "Silly Love Songs", writing, [...] "Not only do they sound great , but the song brings a sugary sweet end to a super-saccharine episode." [...] The Marquee Blog at CNN gave the music numbers a positive review. A notable segment reads: [...] "I just loved seeing The Warblers get their groove on amidst the jeans and cotton T-shirts. And Kurt was super gracious trying to be supportive of Blaine, in spite of his own feelings. I also totally loved the music [...] and overall this was one of my favorite episodes this season. Brett Berk of Vanity Fair praised Salling's performance of [...] "Fat Bottomed Girls", as well as the casts' performances of [...] "P.Y.T."

Only in Puck's world would Queen's raucous song qualify as a serenade—and our horror-turned-amusement was mirrored on his fellow New Directions' faces.
