40|$|This {{research}} {{provides a}} benefit-cost analysis {{for each of}} two distinct Hoosier Helper operating scenarios: daytime patrol and 24 -hour patrol. The computation of agency cost involves an aggregation of <b>equivalent</b> annual <b>investment</b> <b>cost,</b> employee salaries and fringe benefit, overhead cost, and maintenance cost for Hoosier Helper. The following components comprise the estimation of Hoosier Helper benefits: non-recurrent congestion delay savings, secondary crash reduction, and vehicle operating cost savings. The results of an analysis of over two thousand evaluations from motorists assisted by Hoosier Helper are also presented...|$|R
40|$|We study a Cournot duopoly {{model of}} {{preemption}} with irreversible investment under uncertainty expressed by a continuous stochastic process. In most real option approach in monopoly or duopoly models, they analyze the model {{which has the}} opportunity to be active on the market by paying the <b>investment</b> <b>cost</b> only. But {{there are two kinds of}} costs in practice, the production <b>cost</b> and the <b>investment</b> <b>cost.</b> The purpose of this paper is to show the effect on the threshold of each firm when the <b>investment</b> <b>cost</b> or the production cost increases. We show that the <b>investment</b> <b>cost</b> does not have the same effect as the production cost on the threshold of each firm. Formally, the threshold of the follower and the monopolist are directly proportional to the <b>investment</b> <b>cost,</b> while they are inversely proportional to a quadratic function of the production cost. We can observe that the threshold of the leader is linear function of the <b>investment</b> <b>cost</b> and is nonlinear function of the production cost...|$|R

Therefore, one average value for capital <b>investment</b> <b>cost</b> of SCGT {{will be used in}} the study which is 968  $/kW.

The LCOE of SCGT is to be used to determine the competitiveness range allowed for PSHPP’s capital <b>investment</b> <b>costs.</b> The relationship is fitted such that the <b>investment</b> <b>cost</b> is the dependent variable, while the LCOE is the independent variable.|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates {{technology}} investment under flexible capacity {{strategy with}} demand uncertainty. Technology investment enables a firm {{to reduce its}} total production cost, while flexible capacity strategy aims to reduce a firms production waste by postponing production until demand is known. Adopting a general technology <b>investment</b> <b>cost,</b> we examine how technology <b>investment</b> <b>cost</b> structure affects a firms technology investment decisions. We derive {{the conditions under which}} the firm will benefit from technology investment. We show that the firm can increase its expected profit through technology investment only when the unit technology <b>investment</b> <b>cost</b> that varies inversely with the basic technology level is below a threshold. However, even though the technology <b>investment</b> <b>cost</b> is zero, the benefit from the increase in technology level is limited. Furthermore, we analytically determine the optimal technology levels and establish their relationships under different technology <b>investment</b> <b>cost</b> structures. Our findings will help firms evaluate various technology investment options and choose the most proper one. Department of Logistics and Maritime Studie...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{construct}} a game-theoretic model to analyze firms¡ ¦ partial compatibility choices. The {{quality of a}} hybrid system depends on the minimum of the compatibility levels chosen by firms. We find that, depending on the <b>investment</b> <b>cost,</b> the compatibility level could be incompatibility or partial compatibility. When the <b>investment</b> <b>cost</b> is very small, firms¡ ¦ optimal compatibility levels are partial. If the <b>investment</b> <b>cost</b> is relatively large, then firms will choose incompatibility.

40|$|We {{examine a}} game of {{competition}} with access provision in which service quality is endogenously determined through infrastructure upgrades with spillovers. There {{are two types of}} equilibria in the free competition regime. In particular, voluntary access provision with an access charge higher than access cost occurs in equilibrium, irrespective of the degree of spillover and the <b>investment</b> <b>cost.</b> However, foreclosure also occurs in equilibrium when the degree of spillover is small and the <b>investment</b> <b>cost</b> is low. We also show that, when voluntary access provision occurs in equilibrium, access regulation is socially desirable only if the degree of spillover is small and the <b>investment</b> <b>cost</b> is high. On the contrary, access regulation is socially desirable in the broader range of <b>investment</b> <b>cost</b> under foreclosure than under voluntary access provision...|$|R

Further, we argue that the correlation between output price and <b>investment</b> <b>costs</b> significantly affects the effect of irreversibility on investment behavior.
