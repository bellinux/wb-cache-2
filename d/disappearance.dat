5|$|In 2016 Natalee’s father, Dave Holloway, hired {{a private}} investigator, T.J. Ward, {{to go through}} all {{evidence}} and information related to the <b>disappearance</b> once more. This led to an informant named Gabriel, who claims to have been a roommate of one of Van der Sloot's closest friends named John back in 2005. Gabriel claims that John was told what happened to Natalee. Gabriel gave a detailed description of what happened on the night of Natalee’s <b>disappearance</b> {{in an interview with the}} Oxygen television channel, which created a new documentary series on Natalee's <b>disappearance.</b> The interview aired on Saturday, August 19, 2017. Using Gabriel's information, the investigator had found what appeared to be human bones.

40|$|Does violent {{repression}} {{strengthen the}} state? In this {{paper we explore}} the legacies of repression by the Mexican government on subsequent state consolidation. We investigate how a particular form of state repression, forced <b>disappearances</b> of alleged leftist dissidents, during the 1960 s and 1970 s in Mexico had path-dependent consequences for different dimensions of state capacity nearly fifty years later. To do so, we rely on data gathered from suppressed Mexican human rights reports of forced <b>disappearances</b> which, to our knowledge, have not been analyzed by social scientists before. Controlling for a rich set of pre-disappearances covariates, we find that forced <b>disappearances</b> are positively correlated with contemporary measures of fiscal and bureaucratic capacity. However, historical forced <b>disappearances</b> do not help the state to provide security, to consolidate its monopoly {{over the use of}} force, or to provide welfare-related public goods in the long run. Moreover, <b>disappearances</b> are negatively correlated with various measures of trust in the government...|$|R
