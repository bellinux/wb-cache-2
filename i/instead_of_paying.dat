5|$|Barkley {{supported}} U.S. neutrality in World War I and endorsed Wilson's plan {{to purchase}} merchant ships for the U.S. <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>paying</b> foreign carriers to travel waters containing German U-boats. His position was popular in his district, as 80% {{of the dark}} tobacco grown in western Kentucky was sold overseas, and higher shipping costs adversely affected profits. The House authorized the purchase, but Republicans and conservative Democrats in the Senate regarded the idea as socialistic and blocked its passage with a filibuster.|$|E
5|$|Driven to {{help her}} secure the money for a sight-saving corneal transplant, he accepts one final hit. Li Ying, a police detective, spots Ah Jong {{completing}} the job but the assassin escapes. Triad boss Hay Wong Hoi double crosses Ah Jong, and <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>paying</b> him, sends a group of hitmen to kill him. During Ah Jong's escape from the Triad, a young child is injured by a stray bullet. After dispatching the attackers, Ah Jong rushes the child to the hospital while being followed by Li and his partner Sgt. Tsang Yeh. Once the child regains consciousness at the casualty ward, Ah Jong escapes Li and Tsang.|$|E
5|$|Sharp was re-elected to the Fourteenth Congress, {{during which}} he served as {{chairman}} of the Committee on Private Land Claims. He supported the controversial Compensation Act of 1816 sponsored by fellow Kentuckian Richard Mentor Johnson. The measure, which paid Congressmen a flat salary <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>paying</b> them on a daily basis for the days when they were in session, was unpopular with the voters of his district. When the next congressional session opened in December 1816, Sharp reversed his position and voted to repeal the law, but the damage was already done; he lost his seat in the House in the next election.|$|E
25|$|In January 2015, when CY Leung {{reversed}} a {{pay freeze}} {{imposed on the}} CE and senior civil servants in 2012, {{he was accused of}} granting himself a pay rise by stealth and going against the trend of top politicians taking <b>pay</b> cuts <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>pay</b> increases.|$|R

That same year, he supported legislation to make the dumping of litter or trash along roads in the state or parish road systems a crime punishable by fines of up to $100 or thirty days in jail.|$|R
5|$|The company {{collected}} NOK73.5 {{million in}} tolls, {{in addition to}} accumulating NOK16.3 million in interest. Costs, mostly for running of the toll plaza, were NOK7.6 million, in addition to financial costs of NOK20.0 million. This gave a profit of NOK62.4 million, including the necessary repayments of the initial loan. Because the debt had been financed with bonds, the company chose to place revenue in the bank with a higher interest <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>paying</b> off the bonds faster. The preferred shares were repaid in 1980, while all bonds had been repaid by 1985. A/S Sotrabrua was formally liquidated on 9 February 1989.|$|E
5|$|In the 1997 reunion mini-series, Abby sells {{her house}} and prepares to leave the {{cul-de-sac}} and move to Malibu. However, the IRS freezes her assets for non-payment of back taxes, and she temporarily moves in with Karen and Mack, and gets a job from Gary at the construction company he runs with Karen. However, Abby's motives are to obtain a legal document from their company {{in order to help}} Greg Sumner, who is being sued. Should she obtain the document, Greg will pay her the $1 million she needs. Greg then informs her he no longer needs the document. Abby tries to infiltrate his other business dealings to her advantage. <b>Instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>paying</b> her off, Greg offers her a job overseeing one of his business operations in Thailand, which will make her rich again. Before departing, Abby learns that Brian's girlfriend (Kate Whittaker) is expecting their first child, thus making her a grandmother.|$|E

30|$|Rather {{small changes}} {{are also found}} for females' weekly working hours, {{indicating}} a negative relation between first job working hours and moonlighting both in Germany and the UK. Similar to the results for males, there is a positive association between working overtime and secondary jobholding for German women indicating a change in the predicted moonlighting probability of about one percentage point. Note again that compensation by leisure <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>pay</b> may be relevant for this finding. Future research might address this in more detail and may also explore the effect of overtime premiums.|$|R

At Vizagapatam Lawson had prospered as a free (i.e., not EIC-affiliated) merchant.|$|E
25|$|Buffett faults the {{incentives}} in the United States medical industry, that payers reimburse doctors for procedures (fee-for-service) leading to unnecessary care (overutilization), <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>paying</b> for results. He cited Atul Gawande's 2009 {{article in the}} New Yorker as a useful consideration of US health care, with its documentation of unwarranted variation in Medicare expenditures between McAllen, Texas and El Paso, Texas. Buffett raised the problem of lobbying by the medical industry, {{saying that they are}} very focused on maintaining their income.|$|E
25|$|After {{a change}} of {{government}} at the December 1975 election, the Fraser Coalition government established the Medibank Review Committee in January 1976. The Committee findings were not made public but the new program was announced in a Ministerial Statement to Parliament on 20 May 1976. 'Medibank Mark II' was launched on 1 October 1976 and included a 2.5% levy on taxable incomes, with the option of taking out private health insurance <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>paying</b> the levy. Other changes included reducing rebates to doctors and hospitals.|$|E

5000|$|Sweat equity is the {{cornerstone}} of the Homes Not Jails philosophy. It is formulated to address the problem that most affordable housing is unaffordable for people with no income or people on General Assistance, Supplemental Security Income, or Aid to Families with Dependent Children. [...] Homes Not Jails proposes an alternative model for people who are destitute and need to do labor <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>pay</b> rent. The use of sweat equity decreases the amount of government funding needed to make affordable units available, and for more complex building skills such as architecture or engineering Homes Not Jails has historically relied on volunteer work. The underlying principle is to have residents do the work on their own housing and greatly reduce the cost of running a large non-profit organization that would contract out or source volunteers to help in construction efforts.|$|R
50|$|Under the Spreepark GmbH {{some new}} attractions were added and visitor numbers reached 1.5 million per annum. Later {{the concept was}} changed and the park was {{gradually}} transformed into a more Western-style amusement park. An entrance fee (adults: 29 DM, children: 27 DM) covering all individual attractions was now charged, <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> visitors <b>paying</b> for each individual ride, as had previously been the case.|$|R
25|$|Geneva State Forest was {{formerly}} {{part of a}} vast land holding of timberlands owned by the Jackson Lumber Company. The lumber company, as was a common practice of the time, clear cut the land. They were left with land that was of little use. Jackson Lumber Company tried to sell the land {{for as little as}} 50 cents an acre. They were unsuccessful and ultimately chose to donate the land to the State of Alabama <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>paying</b> property taxes for land they could no longer use.|$|E
25|$|Record {{economic}} growth {{starting in the}} mid-1980s mostly erased the problem of finances preventing service. As a secondary measure, starting in 1990, paying for a mission became easier on those called to work in industrialized nations. Missionaries began paying into a church-wide general missionary fund <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>paying</b> on their own. This amount paid (about $425 per month currently) {{is used by the}} church to pay for the costs of all missionaries, wherever they go. This enabled those going to Bolivia, whose average cost of living is about $100 per month, to help pay for those going to Japan, whose cost tops out at around $900 per month.|$|E
25|$|While Freedom {{was being}} cast at Mills' foundry, the {{foreman in charge}} of the casting went on strike. <b>Instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>paying</b> him the higher wages he demanded, Mills turned the project over to Philip Reid, one of the slaves working at the facility. Reid presided over the rest of the casting and {{assembly}} of the figure. Late in 1863, construction of the dome was sufficiently advanced for the installation of the statue, which was hoisted by former slaves in sections and assembled atop the cast-iron pedestal. The final section, the figure's head and shoulders, was raised on December 2, 1863, to a salute of 35 guns answered by the guns of the 12 forts around Washington, D.C.|$|E

6000|$|On one {{of these}} penniless pilgrimages they took passage on a boat, and, when fare was demanded, artlessly offered to talk, <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>pay.</b> As the boat was well under way and they {{actually}} had not a cent, there was no help for it. So Brothers Lion and Lamb held forth to the assembled passengers in their most eloquent style. There {{must have been something}} effective in this conversation, for the listeners were moved to take up a contribution for these inspired lunatics, who preached peace on earth and good-will to man so earnestly, with empty pockets. A goodly sum was collected; but when the captain presented it the reformers proved that they were consistent even in their madness, for not a penny would they accept, saying, {{with a look at the}} group about them, whose indifference or contempt had changed to interest and respect, [...] "You see how well we get on without money;" [...] and so went serenely on their way, with their linen blouses flapping airily in the cold October wind.|$|R

25|$|On the road, Jagannath and Balabhadra grew thirsty and chanced upon a milkmaid Manika, {{who gave}} them butter-milk/yogurt to quench their thirst. <b>Instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>paying</b> her dues, Balabhadra {{gave her a}} ring telling her to claim her dues from King Purushottam. Later, Purushottam Deva himself passed by with his army. At Adipur near Chilika lake, the milkmaid Manika halted the King {{pleading}} for the unpaid cost of yogurt consumed by His armie's two leading soldiers riding on black and white horses. She produced the gold ring as evidence. King Purusottam Deva identified the ring as that of Jagannath. Considering this a sign of divine support for his campaign, the king enthusiastically led the expedition.|$|E
25|$|In June 2003, the Scouts {{agreed to}} install a fish ladder, modify the dam's spillway, educate Scouts at camp about {{threatened}} species, and enhance the stream bed habitat for fish. <b>Instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>paying</b> a fine, the San Francisco Chronicle reported in 2006 that the council paid more than $1 million, including legal fees, to construct a custom fish ladder for use when the dam is full and a juvenile vertical-slot fish passage ladder in the spillway. The fish ladder is a unique design that allows the fish to swim upstream or downstream when the flashboards are installed. The design had not {{been used in the}} United States beforehand. It was designed by Swanson Hydrology + Geomorphology and built by Don Chapin Company. The fish ladders significantly improved fish passage.|$|E
25|$|Boeing {{initially}} {{ruled out}} producing a re-engined {{version of its}} 737 {{to compete with the}} Airbus A320neo family launch planned for 2015, believing airlines would be looking towards the Boeing Y1 and a 30% fuel saving, <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>paying</b> 10% more for fuel efficiency gains of only a few percent. Industry sources believe that the 737's design makes re-engining considerably more expensive for Boeing than it was for the Airbus A320. However, there did prove to be considerable demand. Southwest Airlines, who use the 737 for their entire fleet (680 in service or on order), said they were not prepared to wait 20 years or more for a new 737 model and threatened to convert to Airbus. Boeing eventually bowed to airline pressure and in 2011 approved the 737 MAX project, scheduled for first delivery in 2017.|$|E

25|$|The Bay Area Toll Authority {{reported}} that by October 2010 fewer users are driving {{during the peak}} hours and more vehicles are crossing the Bay Bridge {{before and after the}} 5–10 a.m. period in which the congestion toll goes into effect. According to a study contracted to the University of California, Berkeley, commute delays {{in the first six months}} have dropped by an average of 15 percent compared with 2009. When the congestion tolls were proposed, the agency expected the scheme to produce a 20 to 30 percent drop in commute traffic. The study also found a decrease in the number of carpools since the first fee for carpools was introduced, with a reduction of 10,800 carpoolers when figures from September 2009 and 2010 are compared. The UC Berkeley study also provides evidence that some people are using BART to get to work in San Francisco <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>paying</b> the higher tolls on the Bay Bridge during rush hour.|$|E
25|$|Gutknecht {{had always}} chosen to submit filing {{petitions}} when running for Congress <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>paying</b> the $300 election filing fee, calling this a more fiscally conservative approach. Gutknecht {{was the only}} major party candidate in Minnesota to submit filing petitions in 2006. In August 2006, Louis Reiter of Elgin, Minnesota filed papers with the Minnesota Supreme Court seeking to disqualify Gutknecht from having his name appear on the September 12, 2006 primary ballot. The filing was prepared by DFL election attorney Alan Weinblatt, and argued that all candidates are subject to a time limit for petitions, and {{that most of the}} petition signatures were gathered before the July 4–18, 2006 period which the lawsuit claimed was applicable. Gutknecht filed the petitions on July 5, 2006, the first day possible for such filings. He had never previously been challenged on this point. The state Supreme Court heard the case on August 22, 2006 and denied the attempt to disqualify Gutknecht the same day.|$|E
25|$|Like most {{industrialists}} of his era, Roach was staunchly anti-union, {{and insisted}} his employees negotiate {{on an individual}} basis for their wages. Roach however, took the concept of individual negotiation much further than most of his contemporaries. <b>Instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>paying</b> a set wage to workers based on their qualifications or skill, he organized a sliding scale of wages for each group, based on a set of criteria Roach himself deemed important. A worker who met all the criteria would receive the top rate, while those who did not would have their wages progressively reduced, depending on the number of criteria they failed. Criteria for payment included not only a worker's skill level, but his punctuality, dependability, eagerness and quality of work, in addition to which his moral character was subject to assessment. Workers who spent too much on alcohol, who paid their rent erratically, whose families were poorly clothed, or whose children did not attend church or school, could expect to have their wages reduced still further.|$|E
