40|$|Atherosclerosis {{involves}} {{disturbances in}} endothelium {{and the resultant}} cascade of inflammatory reactions involving generation of ROS (Reactive Oxygen Species). Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor- (PPAR-) receptors are more expressed during atherosclerosis process and its stimulation results in inhibition of formation of atherosclerotic plaque. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) stimulates GSH (glutathione) formation and thus helps in scavenging ROS. Thus, the purpose of present study is to explore the role of PPAR- agonist (<b>pioglitazone)</b> <b>and</b> N-acetylcysteine in atherosclerosis. Endothelial injury in hyper-lipidemic rat was produced in the femoral artery. The effect of chronic treatment of <b>pioglitazone,</b> N-acetylcysteine <b>and</b> their combination was evaluated by measuring serum HDL, LDL, triglyceride, total cholesterol <b>and</b> lesion index. <b>Pioglitazone</b> <b>and</b> N-acetylcysteine treated rats showed higher levels of HDL {{and lower levels of}} LDL, triglycerides and total cholesterol as compared to model control animals (diet + endothelial injury model). Combination of both <b>pioglitazone</b> <b>and</b> N-acetylcysteine produced synergistic action with respect to lipid level. N-acetylcysteine treated animals showed high GSH levels in the liver. Femoral artery lesion index was significantly less in the groups treated with pioglitazone (1. 3 ± 0. 09), N-acetylcysteine (3. 17 ± 0. 28) as well as their combination (1. 02 ± 0. 07) when compared with model control group (4. 57 ± 0. 19).

We also studied the modulating effects of these treatments on blood glucose, lipid profile, and insulin resistance.

40|$|The {{present study}} was aimed to find {{possible}} role of <b>pioglitazone</b> (PPARγ agonist) <b>and</b> fenofibrate (PPARα agonist) by Triton induced hyperlipidemia Model, Diet induced model and Relative organ weight analysis [...] The study revels that, both <b>pioglitazone</b> <b>and</b> fenofibrate has significantly reduced the elevated levels of serum triglycerides and cholesterol in both atherogenic diet and triton induced hyperlipidemia at 3 mg kg - 1 b. wt. Significant increase in HDL level was observed in animals treated with pioglitazone 3 mg kg - 1 b. wt. and fenofibrate 3 mg kg - 1 b. wt. in animals induced hyperlipidemia with atherogenic diet. The liver enzymes reveal that, there was significant reverse in ASAT levels in animals treated with pioglitazone 3 mg kg - 1 b. wt. and fenofibrate 3 mg kg - 1 b. wt. Histopathology reports also suggest that, there was a protection to liver and heart against atherogenic and triton induced damage. In combination therapy of both <b>pioglitazone</b> <b>and</b> fenofibrate in atherogenic diet and triton induced hyperlipidemia,there was no potentiation in their activity when they have administered in combination...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the current}} study was to {{investigate}} the effects of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) agonists on cerebellar tissues oxidative damage in hypothyroid rats. The animals included seven groups: group I (control), the animals received drinking water; group II, the animals received 0. 05 % propylthiouracil (PTU) in drinking water; besides PTU, the animals in groups III, IV, V, VI, and VII, were injected with 20 [*]mg/kg vitamin E (Vit E), 10 or 20 [*]mg/kg <b>pioglitazone,</b> <b>and</b> 2 or 4 [*]mg/kg rosiglitazone, respectively. The animals were deeply anesthetized and the cerebellar tissues were removed for biochemical measurements. PTU administration reduced thiol content, superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) activities in the cerebellar tissues while increasing malondialdehyde (MDA) and nitric oxide (NO) metabolites. Vit E, <b>pioglitazone,</b> <b>and</b> rosiglitazone increased thiol, SOD, and CAT in the cerebellar tissues while reducing MDA and NO metabolites. The results of present study showed that, similar to Vit E, both rosiglitazone <b>and</b> <b>pioglitazone</b> as PPARγ agonists exerted protective effects against cerebellar tissues oxidative damage in hypothyroid rats...|$|R
40|$|Background: There are few {{clinical}} trials addressing {{the difference in}} pleiotropic effects among dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP) - 4 inhibitors. We aimed to identify difference in effects on biochemical markers of inflammation, oxidative stress, and atherosclerosis between two DPP- 4 inhibitors in patients with type 2 diabetes. Methods: We prospectively observed twenty subjects with type 2 diabetes before and after a practical medication change from a treatment with <b>pioglitazone</b> <b>and</b> sitagliptin 50 mg to a combination tablet containing the same dose of <b>pioglitazone</b> <b>and</b> alogliptin 25 mg, which was actually identical to switching from sitagliptin to alogliptin. After 3 months, changes from baseline in clinical data and various biochemical markers were evaluated. In partic-ular, body mass index (BMI) and hemoglobin A 1 c (HbA 1 c) were additionally followed after 12 months for evaluation of chronic outcomes. Results: Among markers, serum levels of high mole...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{prevalence}} of {{type 2 diabetes}} mellitus is increasing rapidly, and its treatment with pioglitazone is likely to induce rhabdomyolysis. We aimed {{to determine the effect}} of cotreatment with <b>pioglitazone</b> <b>and</b> red mold dioscorea (RMD) produced by Monascus purpureus NTU 568 on pancreas function in streptozotocin (STZ) -induced diabetic rats. In diabetic rats fed RMD, RMD with <b>pioglitazone,</b> <b>and</b> <b>pioglitazone</b> alone, insulin concentrations increased significantly by 18. 6 – 40. 4 %, 64. 0 – 100. 0 %, and 52. 8 %, respectively, compared with that in the diabetic group (p <  0. 05). Oral glucose tolerance was impaired in the STZ-induced diabetic group within 4 weeks, however, oral glucose tolerance in rats treated with RMD or RMD with pioglitazone improved after 4 weeks, 6 weeks, and 8 weeks. Findings from this study might lend support to the use of RMD as a novel functional food for the prevention of diabetes...|$|R
