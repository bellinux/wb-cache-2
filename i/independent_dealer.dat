500|$|The first {{trademark}} {{friction between}} the two piano manufacturers [...] occurred in 1895 when Steinway & Sons sued to stop Grotrian-Steinweg from using the name [...] "Steinweg" [...] on its pianos. Steinway lost the case, but in January 1919, Willi and Kurt Grotrian decided to change the family surname to Grotrian-Steinweg {{in order to protect}} the trademark of the family business, in the hope of preventing further lawsuits. In 1925, the company established a sales presence in the US as a Delaware corporation called Grotrian-Steinweg Company. Over the next three years, Grotrian-Steinweg sold only 15 pianos in the US, in addition to a few sold by an <b>independent</b> <b>dealer</b> in New York City. Upon discovering the sales in 1928, Steinway & Sons complained to the distributor and to Grotrian-Steinweg, but in 1929 Grotrian-Steinweg sent 47 pianos to the US. A family representative of Steinway went to Germany to discuss the problem directly with the Grotrian-Steinweg family. Arriving at a private agreement, the two family leaders smoked a [...] "peace cigar" [...] and Grotrian-Steinweg subsequently stopped using the names [...] "Steinweg" [...] and [...] "Grotrian-Steinweg" [...] in the US. In 1930 the Delaware corporation was dissolved, and in the next three years exports from Grotrian-Steinweg to the US decreased then halted completely. In 1950, Grotrian-Steinweg relinquished its old 1926 trademark application, which had never been published.|$|E
