40|$|The Report {{describes}} {{the results obtained}} on the spatial and temporal variability of Dioxins, PCBs and selected flame retardants in the Danube during 2 surveys in 2007 and 2013. It contains the full dataset and the detailed description of the analytical methodology. For the investigated compounds in SPM the spatial patterns for PCDD/F and PCBs are similar in 2007 and 2013, while for BDE- 209 the concentration maximum from 2007 shifted from the middle stretch more downstream. From the downstream concentration profile, there is no indication of relevant point sources. Concentrations in SPM are tendencially stable since 2007 except for BDE- 209, displaying a 30 % decrease in concentration. The observed concentrations in SPM ranged between half- and more than one order of magnitude lower compared to the River Elbe. Concentrations in fish are tendencially decreasing since 2007, PCDD/Fs decreased about 20 %, PCBs, both dioxin-like and the sum of 6 marker PCBs and BDE- 209 by approximately 50 %. The concentrations of PCDD/Fs and DL-PCBs found during JDS 3 generally fit into {{the low end of the}} ranges reported for the Rivers Elbe, Rhine, and their tributaries. For the EC- 6 PCBs no data for bream on a wet weight basis were found. However, with the DL-PCBs low, the marker PCBs are supposed to follow this trend. The few BDE- 209 data available suggest that the concentrations in <b>Danube</b> <b>bream</b> are similar to the River Elbe. Since most other organic pollutants appear up to one order of magnitude lower in the Danube-Elbe comparison, this could be an indication for a higher relative relevance of the brominated flame retardants in the Danube. For PCDD/F and PCBs none of the existing EQS values for aquatic biota and suspended solids/sediments, and none of the EU food limits concerned were exceeded. JRC. H. 1 -Water Resource...|$|E
