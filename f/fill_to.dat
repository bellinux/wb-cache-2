The new site {{was less than}} ideal; it was located on an old landfill, and just over a large sewage pipe. Pei's {{architectural}} team added more <b>fill</b> <b>to</b> cover the pipe and developed an elaborate ventilation system to conquer the odor. A new design was unveiled, combining a large square glass-enclosed atrium with a triangular tower and a circular walkway.|$|E
5|$|New Orleans {{was settled}} on a natural high ground along the Mississippi River. Later {{developments}} that eventually extended to nearby Lake Pontchartrain were built on <b>fill</b> <b>to</b> bring them above the average lake level. Navigable commercial waterways extended from the lake into {{the interior of the}} city to promote waterborne commerce. After the construction of the Inner Harbor Navigation Canal in 1940, the state closed these waterways causing the town's water table to lower drastically.|$|E
5|$|At Aliso Beach, {{the mouth}} of Aliso Creek, lies a {{freshwater}} pond that changes frequently in elevation and extent. Tidal activity at the creek's mouth results in sediment building gradually up into a sandbar, impounding it in a small lake about 0.2 miles (0.3km) long at its fullest extent. Afterwards, the water level rises upstream of the sandbar until one of two factors causes it to breach: either waves at high tide wash away {{the top of the}} sandbar, or the lagoon rises enough to overtop the sandbar by itself. Once the water level rises above the sandbar, rapid erosion quickly cuts through the sand and drains the approximately 3–5-foot (0.9–1.5 m)-deep lake in a matter of minutes. Peak flows through the sandbar can reach , even if the incoming flow of the creek is nowhere near that size. Because of the raised flow of the creek and the construction of a parking lot in the lagoon area since the 1960s, the lagoon has never been able to <b>fill</b> <b>to</b> its much larger, historic extent without breaching. Species such as the tidewater goby have suffered because of loss of their habitat this way.|$|E

25|$|Upon CNR's {{assumption}} of the railway and ferry service, the 1950s saw extensive construction at Port aux Basques with expansion of new dock facilities {{and the arrival of}} newer and larger ships such as the MV William Carson. Extensive blasting of rock created space for large rail yards with extensive dual gauge trackage. The excess rock was then used as <b>fill</b> <b>to</b> create the required docks. By the mid-1960s, new railcar-capable ferries such as the MV Frederick Carter permitted the exchange of standard gauge railcars, requiring further expansion at the Port aux Basques terminal facilities.|$|E

However, medical studies to measure the health effects of buckwheat hull pillows manufactured with unprocessed and uncleaned hulls, concluded such buckwheat pillows do contain higher levels of a potential allergen that may trigger asthma in susceptible individuals than do new synthetic-filled pillows.|$|E

Navigable commercial waterways extended from the lake to downtown. After 1940, the state decided to close those waterways following {{the completion of a}} new Industrial Canal for waterborne commerce. Closure of the waterways resulted in a drastic lowering of the water table by the city's drainage system, causing some areas to settle by up to 8feet (2m) due to the compacting and desiccation of the underlying organic soils.|$|E

The following day, more than 500 protestors—most of them mothers—formed a picket line outside the main gate of the convention center construction site at 6:00 PM, preventing trucks from leaving for several hours. After an emergency meeting at city hall that night, city officials and construction company executives agreed to reroute trucks in the Kinsman area so they avoided residential blocks. They also agreed to stop running trucks at midnight, and to add more stop signs in the neighborhood to prevent trucks from speeding.|$|E
25|$|Unlike other action puzzle games such as Tetris or Puzzle League {{where the}} player {{directly}} manipulates the game pieces, either as they fall or via a cursor, the player directly controls the character Toad, who moves around inside {{the playing field}} atop the fallen objects. Toad can pick up individual objects or lift entire stacks and place them elsewhere in the playing field, but is unable to manipulate objects he cannot immediately reach. However, Toad can perform a variety of additional tricks, such as kicking objects across the play field and scurrying {{up the sides of}} stacks to retrieve specific objects. If the player cannot clear the playing field of its objects quickly enough, the play field will eventually <b>fill</b> <b>to</b> the brim and trap Toad, resulting in a Game Over.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, {{with the}} {{approach}} of Hurricane Katrina, storm surge funneled by {{the confluence of the}} GIWW's and MRGO's levees created multiple breaches in the canal's concrete floodwalls, including the spectacular failure of a quarter-mile length on the Lower 9th Ward side, resulting in catastrophic flooding. On the Upper 9th Ward side, the canal poured through a breach near Florida Avenue. On the opposite side, there were two breaches between Florida Avenue and Claiborne Avenue. A large barge, the ING 4727, floated through the breach closer to the river and was deposited in the Lower 9th Ward. The barge itself may have caused {{one or more of the}} breaches; this possibility is under investigation. The canal lock was functioning two days after Katrina hit, at first mostly for barges bringing in <b>fill</b> <b>to</b> repair the breaches. A month later Hurricane Rita reflooded recently drained areas along the canal by topping emergency fill at the breach sites.|$|E

25|$|The {{straight}} six {{extension of}} the Doomben Racecourse was utilised as a ready made apron for the hangars which were to be built. Initial works were delayed by heavy rain for three weeks converting the ground to a quagmire, {{and as a result}} thousands of feet of ashes and coke breeze were carted from the gasworks and deposited in order to keep trucks moving with borrow material from Nudgee. By 18 February 1942 the construction of one hangar had begun and the SW-NE runway was nearing completion. Shiploads of aircraft components were arriving at the port and had to be transported to Amberley for assembly until Eagle Farm was ready. The Americans advised that the runways were urgently needed for the fighter plane protection of Brisbane, and as a result two ten-hour shifts were organised using 100 trucks which hauled 33,000 cubic yards of <b>fill</b> <b>to</b> complete the section, and on 29 March 1942 a squadron of P-39 aircraft landed.|$|E
25|$|The eastern {{shoreline}} of Funafuti Lagoon {{was modified}} during World War II when the airfield (what is now Funafuti International Airport) was constructed. The coral {{base of the}} atoll was used as <b>fill</b> <b>to</b> create the runway. The resulting borrow pits impacted the fresh-water aquifer. In the low areas of Funafuti the sea water can be seen bubbling up through the porous coral rock to form pools with each high tide. Since 1994 a project has been in development to assess {{the environmental impact of}} transporting sand from the lagoon to fill all the borrow pits and low-lying areas on Fongafale. In 2014 the Tuvalu Borrow Pits Remediation (BPR) project was approved in order to fill 10 borrow pits, leaving Tafua Pond, which is a natural pond. The New Zealand Government funded the BPR project. The project was carried out in 2015 with 365,000 sqm of sand being dredged from the lagoon to fill the holes and improve living conditions on the island. This project increased the usable land space on Fongafale by eight per cent.|$|E
500|$|Compared {{to earlier}} Maginot positions, the La Ferté site {{suffered}} {{from a number of}} design and construction deficiencies. The site contours around Block 2 required a great deal of rubble <b>fill</b> <b>to</b> cover the sides of the block. This rubble had not yet stabilized by the spring of 1940 and could be dislodged by artillery fire. Block 2 suffered from restricted fields of fire to the west and southwest, which were covered only by an automatic rifle cloche. The nearby road ran in a cutting that could not be swept by direct fire. [...] Since La Ferté lacked mortars, the road was dead ground.|$|E

Numerous changes were made to Half Day School between 1958 and 1965, but it remained too small to receive all prospective students; in 1983, Half Day School was closed, its duties were given to Laura B.

500|$|In the settlement's early days, Bell Hill {{proved a}} major {{obstacle}} to travel {{south of the city}} centre, and major excavation work was carried out to provide access to the south. A cutting was made in the hill in 1858, and during the 1860s the hill was lowered by some [...] The cutting allowed for the passage of transport between the two parts of the town. The southern flank of the hill was also completely removed (that area now being occupied by Queen's Gardens). The stone removed from the hill was used as construction material for many of the city's first permanent buildings, and also as <b>fill</b> <b>to</b> reclaim the northern end of the Southern Endowment {{along the edge of the}} harbour. This reclamation work added a considerable area to the central city; the original docks, close to the Exchange area of Princes Street, are now several hundred metres inland.|$|E
500|$|Construction {{started on}} August 13, 1963, with an {{elaborate}} ceremony hosted by Mayor Drapeau on barges {{anchored in the}} St. Lawrence River. Ceremonially, construction began when Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson pulled a lever that signalled a front-end loader to dump the first batch of <b>fill</b> <b>to</b> enlarge Saint Helen's Island, and Quebec premier Jean Lesage spread the fill with a bulldozer. Of the 25 million tons of fill needed to construct the islands, 10-12% {{was coming from the}} Montreal Metro's excavations, a public works project that was already under construction before Expo was awarded to Montreal. The remainder of the fill came from quarries on Montreal and the South Shore, however even with that it was insufficient and so bodies of water on both islands were added (lakes and canals) {{to reduce the amount of}} fill required. Expo's initial construction period mainly centered on enlarging Saint Helen's Island, creating the artificial island of Notre Dame Island and lengthening and enlarging the Mackay Pier which became the Cité du Havre. While construction continued, the land rising out of Montreal harbour was not owned by the Expo Corporation yet. After the final mounds of earth completed the islands, the grounds that would hold the fair were officially transferred from the City of Montreal to the corporation on June 20, 1964. This gave Colonel Churchill only 1042 days to have everything built and functioning for opening day. To get Expo built in time, Churchill used the then new project management tool known as the critical path method (CPM). [...] On April 28, 1967, opening day, everything was ready, with one exception: Habitat 67, which was then displayed as a work in progress.|$|E
