Traditional music Seisiúns are still common place both in pubs and in houses. The Donegal <b>fiddle</b> music has been influenced by recorded music, but this is claimed to have had a positive impact on the tradition. Modern Donegal <b>fiddle</b> music is often played in concerts and recorded on albums.|$|E

5|$|Calabria, alone, has 30 {{traditional}} musical instruments, some {{of which}} have strongly archaic characteristics and are largely extinct elsewhere in Italy. It is home to the four- or five-stringed guitar called the chitarra battente, and a three-stringed, bowed <b>fiddle</b> called the lira, which is also found in similar forms in the music of Crete and Southeastern Europe. A one-stringed, bowed <b>fiddle</b> called the torototela, is common in the northeast of the country. The largely German-speaking area of South Tyrol is known for the zither, and the ghironda (hurdy-gurdy) is found in Emilia, Piedmont and Lombardy.|$|E
50|$|There are few real {{distinctions between}} violins and <b>fiddles,</b> though more primitively {{constructed}} and smaller violins {{are more likely}} to be considered <b>fiddles.</b> Due to the style of the music played, <b>fiddles</b> may optionally be set up with a bridge with a flatter arch to allow multiple strings to be played simultaneously with more ease, such as the droning in bluegrass music or performing triple stops.|$|R

Born to Irish parents, McLoughlin's father was head of a London-based country band. At age nine, McLoughlin moved away from piano lessons to play <b>fiddle,</b> and performed with his father's band. McLoughlin had earlier relocated from Brighton to Austin in 1997, after leaving the University of Sussex {{with a degree in}} Politics and American Studies. Trained in London studying Royal Schools of Music Grades before emigrating, McLoughlin also toured with the Asylum Street Spankers, Austin Lounge Lizards, Bruce Robison and Ray Wylie Hubbard after arriving in the United States.|$|E

Notable exponents of Shetland folk music include Aly Bain, Fiddlers' Bid, and the late Tom Anderson and Peerie Willie Johnson. Thomas Fraser was a country musician who never released a commercial recording during his life, but whose work has become popular more than 20 years after his untimely death in 1978.|$|E

5|$|The {{distinctness}} of the Donegal tradition developed due to {{the close}} relations between Donegal and Scotland, and the Donegal repertoire and style has influences from Scottish <b>fiddle</b> music. For example, {{in addition to the}} standard tune types such as Jigs and Reels, the Donegal tradition also has Highlands (influenced by the Scottish Strathspey). The distinctiveness of the Donegal tradition led to some conflict between Donegal players and representatives of the mainstream tradition when Irish traditional music was organised in the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|The {{influences}} between Scotland and Donegal went {{both ways}} and were furthered {{by a wave}} of immigration from Donegal to Scotland in the 19th century (the regions share common names of dances), as {{can be heard in}} the volume of strathspeys, schottisches, marches, and Donegal's own strong piping tradition, has influenced and been influenced by music, and by the sounds, ornaments, and repertoire of the Píob Mhór, the traditional bagpipes of Ireland and Scotland. There are other differences between the Donegal style and the rest of Ireland. Instruments such as the tin whistle, flute, concertina and accordion were very rare in Donegal until modern times. Traditionally the píob mór and the <b>fiddle</b> were the only instruments used and the use of pipe or <b>fiddle</b> music was common in old wedding customs. Migrant workers carried their music to Scotland and also brought back a number of tunes of Scottish origin. The Donegal fiddlers may well have been the route by which Scottish tunes such as Lucy Campbell, Tarbolton Lodge (Tarbolton) and The Flagon (The Flogging Reel), that entered the Irish repertoire. These players prided themselves on their technical abilities, which included playing in higher positions (fairly uncommon among traditional Irish fiddlers), and sought out material which would demonstrate their skills.|$|E
5|$|The monochord {{served as}} a precise measure of the notes of a musical scale, {{allowing}} more accurate musical arrangements. Mechanical hurdy-gurdies allowed single musicians to play more complicated arrangements than a <b>fiddle</b> would; both were prominent folk instruments in the Middle Ages. Southern Europeans played short and long lutes whose pegs extended to the sides, unlike the rear-facing pegs of Central and Northern European instruments. Idiophones such as bells and clappers served various practical purposes, such as warning of the approach of a leper.|$|E
