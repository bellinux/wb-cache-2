40|$|Adsorption of Cr, Cu,Zn, Ni and Cd on {{the surface}} of sea-sediments from Thermaikos gulf was studied as a {{function}} of pH, ionic strength and metal solution concentration. Furthermore, the charge development on the sediment's surface was studied in the pH range ~ 2, 8 to ~ 10. 0, by acid-basepotentiometric titrations. Both sediments exhibit low point of zero charge (pH Cu>Zn>Ni>Cd. The increase of metal concentration, as well as the increase of ionic strength, shifts the adsorption curve in higher pH values. The sediment that has bigger surface area adsorbs the studied metalsin slightly lower pH values. Surface complexation models, such as Difusse Double Layer Model (DDLM) and Constant Capacitance Model (CCM), were applied to the experimental data of potentiometric titrations and adsorption of metals, using the least square optimization program FITEQL 32 (Herbelin and westall, 1996). Constant Capacitance Model fits better titration experimental data compared to the Diffuse Double Layer Model, specially when the surface site density of the sediments is fixed to Ns= 2. 31 sites/nm^ 2 and thecapacitance density to C= 1, 06 F/m^ 2.
