The study was conducted in Dar es Salaam, where the selected organization is located. Questionnaires were administered to NBAA staff. Management team and non-management employees such as Managers, In-charges, Heads of Units and Subordinates were interviewed to get their opinions in identifying key success factors of HR Planning in Public Service Organizations. Respondents were obtained from their respective departments and units. 36 individuals were interviewed due to the size of the organization, identified by their responsibilities, cadre, gender, age, social status and marital status. The sample was chosen randomly and purposely to avoid biasness. Random sampling based on respondents who were not directly involved in HR activities and purposive sampling was based on management team and HR practitioners. The study found out that challenges from other departments arose when traditional executive did not understand the value of human resource expert thus failed to support <b>HR</b> <b>unit</b> when planning. Because of this, the study revealed that there were challenges when implementing HR strategies. From the findings of the study, it is recommended that employees need to be trained and make them aware of HR concept, organization policies and procedures, HR plans and, HR policy and its functioning.

40|$|Abstract Introduction Following {{twenty years}} of {{economic}} and social growth, Liberia's fourteen-year civil war destroyed its health system, with most of the health workforce leaving the country. Following the inauguration of the Sirleaf administration in 2006, the Ministry of Health & Social Welfare (MOHSW) has focused on rebuilding, with an emphasis on increasing the size and capacity of its human resources for health (HRH). Given resource constraints and the high maternal and neonatal mortality rates, MOHSW concentrated on its largest cadre of health workers: nurses. Case description Based on results from a post-war rapid assessment of health workers, facilities and community access, MOHSW developed the Emergency Human Resources (HR) Plan for 2007 - 2011. MOHSW established a central <b>HR</b> <b>Unit</b> and county-level HR officers and prioritized nursing cadres in order to quickly increase workforce numbers, improve equitable distribution of workers and enhance performance. Strategies included increasing and standardizing salaries to attract workers and prevent outflow to the private sector; mobilizing donor funds to improve management capacity and fund incentive packages in order to retain staff in hard to reach areas; reopening training institutions and providing scholarships to increase the pool of available workers. Discussion and evaluation MOHSW has increased the total number of clinical health workers from 1396 in 1998 to 4653 in 2010, 3394 of which are nurses and midwives. From 2006 to 2010, the number of nurses has more than doubled. Certified midwives and nurse aides also increased by 28 % and 31 % respectively. In 2010, the percentage of the clinical workforce made up by nurses and nurse aides increased to 73 %. While the nursing cadre numbers are strong and demonstrate significant improvement since the creation of the Emergency HR Plan, equitable distribution, retention and performance management continue to be challenges. Conclusion This paper illustrates the process, successes, ongoing challenges and current strategies Liberia has used to increase and improve HRH since 2006, particularly the nursing workforce. The methods used here and lessons learned might be applied in other similar settings. </p...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The overall aim of {{this study}} is to obtain more {{knowledge}} about Human Resources (HR) work in supporting line managers and employees in the increasingly expanding consulting industry. The study aims to identify which support outsourced consultants mainly value from their employer in a specific consulting company, which is then compared to the consultant managers' perception of their work in providing consultants with support. The comparison should then provide a strategy for how the firm´s <b>HR</b> <b>unit</b> can advise the line managers concerning support to the consultants. Theory: The theoretical framework describes the challenges of personnel-related work in innovative organizations, bearing in mind the variable level of capacity and interest in personnel matters by consultant managers and the need for support. In order to illustrate and examine the types of support that can be identified in the statements by consultants and line managers, the categorization by House (1981) involving instrumental, informative, evaluative and emotional support has been selected for use. To ascertain the flexible conditions that can prevail in consulting firms, Mintzberg's (1989) theory of adhocratic organizational structures has been used to illustrate how outsourced consultants and line managers can experience a flexible structure and how these conditions can affect the supply of support. Method: This study is based on qualitative research, where a total of six semi-structured interviews have been conducted to collect empirical data. The data have been analysed by encoding, where the answers to questions at the interviews have been divided into four different categories, corresponding to House (1981). Results: The study's empirical results show that the consultants experience seek an improvement in mainly evaluative and emotional support, combined with a generally increased social interaction. Both consultants and line managers experience that instrumental support is a complex task. The distance between the two groups during the everyday working situation and the specialized character of the consultant’s competence give rise to a marginal understanding of the consultants' work by the line manager. As far as informative support is concerned, it appears that the confidence for the work by line managers, concerning business and personal affairs is satisfactory. This type of support seems to be catered for in the studied organization. In a broader context, this study highlights the complexity of providing support under the flexible working conditions that prevail in an adhocratic organizational structure. Based on previous research, two possible strategies have emerged for how HR can facilitate line managers to provide consultants with support. One strategy is to develop clear descriptions of responsibilities, where information is provided concerning when and how support can be conveyed to consultants. We also suggest that further development of the line managers’ role in a more HR-oriented context could be carried out...|$|E
40|$|Cet article présente les résultats d'une {{recherche}} empirique sur l'évaluation de l'efficacité des directions des ressources humaines (DRH) dans le secteur public québécois selon l'approche par les clients. Cette méthode mesure l'efficacité des DRH par la satisfaction de leurs clients. Le modèle proposé et testé distingue les attentes et la satisfaction {{des clients}} (contrairement aux travaux précédents) et tient compte des effets des caractéristiques des DRH sur l'évaluateur (le client). Les résultats de l'étude confirment globalement les grandes conclusions de Tsui (1987, 1990) quant à l'existence de différences significatives dans la satisfaction et les attentes des clients tout en apportant quelques modifications méthodologiques. Aussi, de façon globale, les conclusions mettent en relief l'effet de trois variables indépendantes (l'engagement des clients, la compétence des membres des DRH, la fréquence des contacts des clients avec leur DRH) sur la satisfaction des clients selon les deux axes « relations du travail » et « gestion des ressources humaines ». Every organization (and department) needs {{to undertake a}} periodic analysis to pinpoint its existing strengths and weaknesses. At present, {{there is a growing}} interest among organizations about learning how to conduct a systematic human resources (HR) assessment. The evaluation of the HR function and its relationship to organizational effectiveness results in an understanding that is useful when modelling the path toward strategie human resources management. Thus, evaluation and control mechanisms are a requisite and contributing factor to the credibility and acceptance of HR management in the eyes of corporate management. Although management understands the need for assessing the effectiveness of their HR services, the approaches and instruments avallable to carry out this task are not very well developed. Recently, however, an approach called "multiple constituency" has emerged. The premise behind this approach is that the effectiveness of the HR department is determined by its reputation with constituents or clients. The multiple constituency approach is on the rise, given the importance accorded to customer satisfaction in the general management literature. With the proliferation of general concepts such as "total quality", "zero defects" and the like, this study attempts to develop a model applicable to human resources; it measures constituent satisfaction with various HR activities (i. e. the dependent variable) as an indicator of the effectiveness of the HR department. Nevertheless, given the notion of limited resources, the underlying assumption in this study is that an effective HR department is one that is able to identify the critical constituents in its organization (i. e., hospitals in this study), and to attempt to satisfy these constituent groups first and foremost. By contrast, it is also assumed that an HR department which falls to address these "core groups", may allocate time, money, and other resources to less important constituents and consequently may have less impact on the organization's overall effectiveness. Thus, the two research questions addressed in this study are: 1. What are the key variables affecting the level of satisfaction of different constituent groups with their human resource department? 2. Are there differences or similarities pertaining to the level of satisfaction with the HR services amongst the various constituent groups?In order to test the model, the collaboration of the Quebec Hospital Association was sought. A stratified sample was used to select 35 general hospitals (i. e., 12 large, 12 medium-sized and 11 small) of which 27 finally agreed to collaborate. Two types of instruments (questionnaires) were developed to measure 5 principal constituent groups' perceptions about their respective HR effectiveness. The groups included: (1) senior executives, (2) middle managers, (3) nurses, (4) professional employees, and (5) blue-collar workers. In parallel, all of the HR directors were given questionnaires which enabled them to supply information about their services and department (i. e., size, qualifications of the staff in the <b>HR</b> <b>unit,</b> etc.). Based on this stratified sample, and the requirement of a minimum of 42 questionnaires per hospital (i. e., a minimum of 7 employees selected at random for each constituent group), a 68. 5 % response rate was obtained. The fact that multiple sources of information were used and that analyses were done across hospitals and constituent groups (i. e., the aggregate nature of the analyses), reduced the problem of "method-variance" in the findings. A model pertaining to the determinants of client satisfaction with (and expectations of) the HR department was developed. The determinants of clients' satisfaction (and expectations) were divided into two principal groups: (l) those pertaining to client characteristics (i. e., seniority, age, commitment to the hospital, gender, level of autonomy, frequency of contacts with the HR department, and constituent affiliation), (2) those pertaining to HR department's characteristics (size, power, seniority of the HR department, qualifications of the HR staff, education and the general orientation of the HR strategy in conducting the HR activities). All in all, the results supported the general usefulness of the multiple constituency approach. First, the results of the factorial analysis suggested that the 10 facets of HR activities (i. e., staffing, training, remuneration, etc.) can be grouped into only two dimensions which were labelled in the study: "labour relations" and "traditional HR". Second, it was demonstrated that different constituents have significant differences in their level of satisfaction with respect to labour relations activities ÇF= 11. 6; P=. 001). By contrast, no significant differences in satisfaction were found for the traditional HR dimension. As regards to expectations of the HR department, a significant difference was found for both labour relations and traditional HR activities. Moreover, the findings revealed that three independent variables {{play a major role in}} explaining variance in satisfaction with the HR services: (1) level of commitment of the constituent to the hospital, (2) professional qualification of the HR staff, and (3) the frequency of contacts the constituent has with the human resource department. Other findings shed more light on the level of expectation constituents have toward their HR services. The study concludes with a short discussion on how an HR department can increase its effectiveness under circumstances of compatibility and non-compatibility with its clients' expectations, and how the HR department should intervene in order to increase satisfaction thereby increasing effectiveness...|$|E
40|$|The Taiwan {{mountain}} belt {{is composed}} of a Cenozoic slate belt (Hsuehshan Range <b>units,</b> <b>HR,</b> and Backbone Slates, BS) and of accreted polymetamorphic basement rocks (Tananao Complex, TC). Ongoing crustal shortening has resulted from the collision between the Chinese continental margin and the Luzon volcanic arc, which initiated ~ 6. 5 Ma ago. The grade and age of metamorphism and exhumation are a key record {{of the development of}} the orogenic wedge. Because the Taiwan mountain belt is mostly composed by accreted sediments lacking metamorphic index minerals, quantitative constraints on metamorphism are sparse. By contrast, these rocks are rich in carbonaceaous material (CM) and are therefore particularly appropriate for RSCM (Raman Spectroscopy of CM) thermometry. We apply this technique in addition to (U-Th) /He thermochronology on detrital zircons to assess peak metamorphic temperatures (T) and the late exhumational history respectively, along different transects in central and southern Taiwan. In the case of the <b>HR</b> <b>units,</b> we find evidence for high metamorphic T of at least 340 °– 350 °C and locally up to 475 °C, and for relative rapid exhumation with zircon (U-Th) /He ages in the range of 1. 5 – 2 Ma. Farther east, the BS were only slightly metamorphosed (T < 330 °C), and zircons are not reset for (U-Th) /He. From the eastern BS to the inner TC schists, T gradually increases from ~ 350 °C up to ~ 500 °C following an inverted metamorphic gradient. Available geochronological constraints and the continuous thermal gradient from the BS to the basement rocks of the TC suggest that the high RSCM T of the TC were most probably acquired during the last orogeny, and were not inherited from a previous thermal event. Zircons yield (U-Th) /He ages of ~ 0. 5 – 1. 2 Ma. Peak metamorphic T and the timing of exhumation do not show along-strike variations over the TC in the studied area. In contrast, exhumation is laterally diachronous and decreases southward {{in the case of the}} <b>HR</b> <b>units.</b> In particular, our data imply that the <b>HR</b> <b>units</b> have been exhumed by a minimum of 15 km over the last few Ma. In the case of the BS, they show far less cumulated exhumation and much slower cooling rates. We propose that most of the deformation and exhumation of the Taiwan mountain belt is sustained through two underplating windows located beneath the Hsuehshan Range and the TC. Our data show significant departures from the predictions of the prevailing model in Taiwan, which assumes a homogeneous critical wedge with dominant frontal accretion. Our study sheds new light on how the mountain belt has grown as a possible result of underplating mostly...|$|R

MethodsWe reviewed 1, 318 consecutive patients with chronic heart failure admitted for ADHF to the Cleveland Clinic between July 2008 and December 2013. We also validated our findings in an independent ADHF cohort from the University of Pennsylvania (n = 876). ResultsAdmission serum chloride levels during hospitalization for ADHF were independently and inversely associated with long-term mortality (hazard ratio [HR] per unit change: 0. 94; 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 0. 92 to 0. 95; p  0. 05).

40|$|This {{research}} dissertation {{examines the}} approach {{taken by the}} Land Registry to integrate a strategic approach to Human Resource Management since the launch of Strategic Management Initiative in 1994 and Delivering Better Government in 1996. In particular it examines the role and re-orientation of the Human Resource unit in the Land Registry {{to take account of}} more developmental and strategic focus as envisaged in the Civil Service Modernisation Programme. The methodology chosen for this dissertation is a case study methodology. The case study method is a qualitative approach, which is found useful for social science research and studies. The case study method will allowed me to look in depth at a complex and single instance phenomenon in the Land Registry. I will analyse the Land Registry's human resource practices critically and {{determine the extent to which}} the human resource activities are integrated and aligned with the strategic needs of the organisation. A multi-method approach using both primary and secondary research data was used in this dissertation. The launch of the Strategic Management Initiative in 1994 set the scene for reform in the civil service with significant emphasis on developing greater strategic capacity for departments to help the government facilitate economic and social development. The policy document Delivering Better Government in 1996 sought to develop this capability further by setting out the vision and road map for change in the civil service. It proposed reforms consistent with matching the skills of individuals with the needs of departments, and the creation of a more flexible workforce. In particular the Delivering Better Government proposed a number of reforms for Human Resource Management in the Irish Civil Service such as developing greater autonomy and responsibility for <b>HR</b> <b>units,</b> reorienting <b>HR</b> <b>unit's</b> activities and focus to take a more strategic/developmental approach and devolve responsibility for day-to-day human resource issues to line management. The development by each department of a human resource strategy linked to the overall strategy for the organisation and reforming arrangements for the recruitment, placement, tenure, promotion and development of staff was also proposed. It can be concluded from the research that an overall strategic management framework in which Human Resource Management can evolve is in place within the Land Registry. However, in terms of human resource policy and practices, there has been only been individual development and innovations, rather than a more integrated strategic approach to Human Resource Management. However, the Land Registry like all civil service departments must adhere to centralised policy. This is creating a lack of flexibility to recruit and retain competent staff and deal with under-performance. There is evidence among those interviewed for a considerable level of continuing commitment for change. However, within the Irish Civil Service, an often repeated criticism of Strategic Management Initiative and Delivering Better Government is that it has lead to reform fatigue. It is therefore important that the Human Resource unit in the Land Registry identify, support and communicate the case for civil service reform and modernisation...|$|R

40|$|The Taiwan {{mountain}} belt is classically {{viewed as}} a case example of a critical wedge growing essentially by frontal accretion and therefore submitted to distributed shortening. However, a number of observations call for a significant contribution of underplating {{to the growth of}} the orogenic wedge. We propose here a new thermokinematic model of the Taiwan mountain belt reconciling existing kinematic, thermometric and thermochronological constraints. In this model, shortening across the orogen is absorbed by slip on the most frontal faults of the foothills. Crustal thickening and exhumation are sustained by underplating beneath the easternmost portion of the wedge (Tananao Complex, TC), where the uplift rate is estimated to ~ 6. 3 mm a^(− 1), and beneath the westernmost internal region of the orogen (Hsueshan Range <b>units,</b> <b>HR),</b> where the uplift rate is estimated to ~ 4. 2 mm a^(− 1). Our model suggests that the TC units experienced a synchronous evolution along strike despite the southward propagation of the collision. It also indicates that they have reached a steady state in terms of cooling ages but not in terms of peak metamorphic temperatures. Exhumation of the <b>HR</b> <b>units</b> increases northward but has not yet reached an exhumational steady state. Presently, frontal accretion accounts for less than ~ 10 % of the incoming flux of material into the orogen, although there is indication that it was contributing substantially more (~ 80 %) before 4 Ma. The incoming flux of material accreted beneath the TC significantly increased 1. 5 Ma ago. Our results also suggest that the flux of material accreted to the orogen corresponds to the top ~ 7 km of the upper crust of the underthrust Chinese margin. This indicates that a significant amount (~ 76 %) of the underthrust material has been subducted into the mantle, probably because of the increase in density associated with metamorphism. We also show that the density distribution resulting from metamorphism within the orogenic wedge explains well the topography and the gravity field. By combining available geological data on the thermal and kinematic evolution of the wedge, our study sheds new light onto mountain building processes in Taiwan and allows for reappraising the initial structural architecture of the passive margin...|$|R

Most obvious in all these regions is a major resurfacing at the early hesperian (EH) time of ridged plains (<b>unit</b> <b>Hr)</b> eruption in Lunae Planum and elsewhere. This event seems to have occurred with greater or lesser efficiency in nearly all terrains studied: ridged plains, knobby terrain, smooth plains, and adjacent cratered terrain.

40|$|Background The WHO International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) {{is now the}} {{dominant}} model for exploring the social consequences of a health condition. This paper investigates the association of the different ICF disability domains with mortality. Methods Data are from the British Women Heart and Health Study, a large (n= 4157) prospectively studied cohort of women randomly selected from 23 towns aged 64 – 83 ?years in 2003. Scores were calculated to describe the cumulative load of impairments, limitations and restrictions within each ICF domain. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to calculate mortality <b>HRs</b> per <b>unit</b> score increase within each ICF domain. Adjustments were made for age, town, living status, socioeconomic status, lifestyle behaviours and health conditions. Results Each ICF domain was associated with mortality after controlling for lifestyle factors and health conditions. However, only complex activities (HR= 1. 09, 95 % CI 1. 01 to 1. 18) and participation (HR= 1. 10, 95 % CI 1. 04 to 1. 16) were independent predictors of mortality following adjustment for all other disability domains and potential confounders. Conclusions Results suggest that difficulties with complex activities or social participation {{could be used to}} identify and target women at high risk of dying. Interventions to facilitate complex activities or improve social participation may help to delay mortality in elderly women...|$|R
40|$|Epidemiologic studies {{indicate}} that elevated levels of gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), a key enzyme of glutathione metabolism, might be associated with increased cancer risk. Furthermore, preclinical studies support a role for GGT in tumor invasion and progression. However, the relationship between GGT and risks of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia III (CIN-III) and invasive cervical cancer (ICC) have not been evaluated. We investigated the association of enzymatically determined GGT in blood serum with subsequent incidence of CIN-III and ICC in a prospective population-based cohort of 92, 843 women ages 18 to 95, of whom 79 % {{had at least one}} gynecologic examination including Pap smear testing during follow-up. Cox regression was used to compute adjusted hazard ratios (HR) with 95 % confidence intervals for the association of GGT with CIN-III and ICC. During median follow-up of 13. 8 years, 702 CIN-III and 117 ICC diagnoses were observed. Compared with normal low GGT (72. 00 units/L; P trend < 0. 0001, <b>HR</b> log <b>unit</b> increase 3. 45 (1. 92 - 6. 19) ]. In contrast, associations between GGT serum levels and CIN-III risk were not statistically significant in the main analysis.

40|$|Background: Overweight {{and obesity}} are {{increasing}} worldwide. To help assess their relevance to mortality in different populations we conducted individual-participant-data meta-analyses of the prospective studies of {{body mass index}} (BMI), limiting confounding and reverse causality by restricting analyses to never-smokers and excluding prior disease and the first 5 years of follow- up. Methods: Of 10, 625, 411 participants in Asia, Australia/New Zealand, Europe, and North America from 239 prospective studies (median follow-up 13 · 7 [IQR: 11 · 4 - 14 · 7] years), 3, 951, 455 in 189 studies were never-smokers without specific chronic diseases at recruitment who survived 5 years, of whom 385, 879 died. The primary analyses are of these deaths, using age and sex-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs). Findings: All-cause mortality was minimal (HR= 1) at BMI (kg/m 2) 20 - 25, and increased significantly both just below this range (BMI 18 · 5 - 25, mortality increased approximately log-linearly with BMI; <b>HR</b> per 5 <b>units</b> higher BMI was 1 · 31 (1 · 29 - 1 · 33) in all regions; 1 · 39 (1 · 35 - 1 · 43) in Europe; 1 · 29 (1 · 26 - 1 · 32) in North America, 1 · 39 (1 · 34 - 1 · 44) in East Asia, and 1. 31 (1. 27, 1. 35) in Australia/New Zealand. This <b>HR</b> per 5 <b>units</b> higher BMI (for BMI> 25) was greater in younger than older people (1. 52 at 35 – 49 years vs 1 · 21 at 70 - 89 years; Pheterogeneity< 0 · 0001), greater in men than women (1 · 51 vs 1 · 30; Pheterogeneity< 0 · 0001), but similar in studies with self-reported and measured BMI. Interpretation: The associations of both overweight and obesity with higher all-cause mortality were broadly consistent in four continents. This supports strategies to combat the entire spectrum of excess adiposity in many populations...|$|R
40|$|Argyre, {{located in}} the {{southern}} highlands southeast of Tharsis, {{is one of the}} largest impact basins on Mars and formed in Early Noachian time. We use Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) data to characterize the basin and its geologic features and units. It has been proposed that meltback of a south polar ice cap during the Noachian completely 6 lled the basin with water, that the out 7 ow channel in the north drained the basin, and that the water eventually entered the northern lowlands (Parker T. J., 1994.) If true, this would be the longest drainage system on either Mars or the Earth and would have immense implications for the hydrologic cycle and the evolution of the atmosphere on Mars. In order to address this question, we used topographic data from the Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA) and imaging data from the Mars Observer Camera (MOC). We also tested several alternative models proposed by previous workers (i. e., eolian, volcanic, mud 7 ows, glaciers, 7 uvial/lacustrine) for the evolution of the Argyre basin. Based on our investigation we conclude that the Argyre basin went through a complex geologic history with several geologic processes contributing to its current appearance. Glacial and 7 uvial/lacustrine processes in conjunction with eolian modi 6 cation were probably most important in the evolution of the interior of the Argyre basin. The Hesperian wrinkle ridged <b>unit</b> <b>Hr</b> was previously interpreted as volcanic in origin due to the occurrence of ridges. Based on our observations we conclude that ridges in Argyre Planitia are dissimilar to wrinkle ridges in other occurrences of <b>unit</b> <b>Hr.</b> The new data suggest that these are eskers and based on the occurrence of these esker-like features, we propose a model in which the 7 oor of Argyre was covered by ice. There is evidence for areally signi 6 cant amounts of water having ponded in the Argyre basin in its pas...|$|R

The inhibitory effect was shown to be cell specific in that the partially purified interferon from L cells did not reduce amino acid incorporation in heterospecific cell lines. Heating the interferon preparations at 60 °C destroyed their antiviral activity and their ability to inhibit valine- 14 C incorporation in L cells...|$|R
50|$|The HAI Pegasus (full name E1-79 ΠΗΓΑΣΟΣ) is an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), {{a product}} of the Hellenic Aerospace Industry (HAI or EAB from the Greek initials). Its {{development}} started in 1979 in collaboration with KETA (Hellenic Air Force Research and Development Center) and its first flight was made in 1982. Its main uses are surveillance and intelligence gathering, The first generation (Pegasus I) had a length of 2.1 meters, wingspan 5 m, maximum speed 160 kilometers/hour, minimum speed 75 km/h, takeoff load 130 kilograms and autonomy 3.5 hours. After initial delays in the relevant program of the Greek Air Force, ten units (including the ground station infrastructure) were produced (a number of them by KEA) to facilitate its performance optimization. By 2003 it was already operational, while in 2005 a redesigned upgrade was introduced (Pegasus II) with advanced electronics, length 4.3 m, wingspan 6.2 m, takeoff load 250 kg and autonomy 15 <b>hrs.</b> Four <b>units</b> (each one including the aircraft and ground stations and equipment) are currently operational, with 12 more under construction by KEA. Pegasus II can carry a maximum payload weight of 50 kg, and thanks to the wide use of composite materials for its construction represents a substantial improvement of the Pegasus I design. Its technical features make it suitable for surveillance, target acquisition, and damage assessment and it is evaluated as an ELINT payload carrier. Expectations for its use as a weapons carrier are limited by its relatively small payload capacity (a payload capacity of 100 kg would render it more suitable for these type of missions).|$|R
