25|$|On 26 March 2012 {{most of the}} Dharawal State Conservation Area was {{declared}} a national park with a residual of three areas of state conservation area remaining {{on the western side}} and center of the national park to allow ongoing mining operations The government waited for its last mining <b>exploration</b> <b>licence</b> with BHP Billiton to expire before making the announcement. The national park status has meant that there are now much greater restrictions on activities such as coal mining within the protected area although in 2012 BHP Billiton was reported as continuing mining exploration in Darkes Forest, just outside the park’s border. The area is said to be protected to the centre of the earth which in theory means that no more mining activities can take place.|$|E
2500|$|Gripen Gas {{announced}} in April 2012 the drilling results from their Ekeby Permit, onshore Sweden. Four shallow vertical wells tested the prospectivity of biogenic {{gas from the}} organic rich Cambro-Ordovician Alum Shale over an area covering about 150km². [...] The prospective Alum Shale was encountered at depths of 75–85 metres in the wells and all wells had gas shows whilst drilling. One well cored the Alum Shale section. All wells were drill stem tested. Gripen Gas confirmed in October 2012 that Bergsstaten (Swedish Mines Inspectorate) had awarded the Sandön <b>exploration</b> <b>licence</b> covering 162km² {{in the western part}} of lake Vättern, in Östergötland County. The <b>exploration</b> <b>licence</b> is for biogenic gas exploration in the organic rich Alum shale formation.
