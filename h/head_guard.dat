The MRT-3 also employs the use of closed-circuit television inside all stations to monitor suspicious activities and to assure safety and security aboard the line.

Wanted posters are posted at all MRT-3 stations to help commuters identify known thieves.|$|E

Their farm, given to them by Ketil, will allow them to purchase their freedom through the success with their crops. Einar and Thorfinn also befriend Ketil's father and Snake, the <b>head</b> <b>guard</b> of the farms.

40|$|AbstractCSIRO {{has been}} collaborating with the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) and Melbourne-based {{engineering}} companies to develop an automated scoring and performance analysis system for amateur boxing. The system comprises sensors built into boxing gloves, <b>head</b> <b>guards</b> and vests. The wearable components transmit data wirelessly to a computer for real-time ringside scoring. The introduction of an automated scoring system can only be justified if it outperforms {{the current system of}} judges. Determining a valid score automatically from a number of impact sensors and accelerometers embedded into vests, gloves and <b>head</b> <b>guards</b> requires novel data fusion and analysis. Techniques for combining the multiple wireless data streams and discriminating valid scoring hits from non-scoring hits, such as blocked hits, are presented and discussed...|$|R

500|$|Portraying the <b>head</b> <b>guard</b> Byron Hadley, Clancy Brown {{was given}} the {{opportunity}} to speak with former guards by the production's liaison officer, but declined believing {{it would not be a}} good thing to say that his brutal character was in any way inspired by Ohio state correctional officers. William Sadler, who portrays Heywood, said that Darabont had approached him in 1989 on the set of the Tales from the Crypt television series where he was a writer, about starring in the adaptation he was intending to make. Morgan's son Alfonso has a cameo as a young Red in mug shot photos, and as a prisoner shouting [...] "fresh fish" [...] as Andy arrives at Shawshank. Among the extras used in the film were the former warden and former inmates of the Reformatory, and active guards from a nearby incarceration facility. The [...] novella's original title attracted several people to audition for the non-existent role of Rita Hayworth, including a man in drag clothing.|$|E
500|$|After the plotlines were developed, major {{deviations}} sometimes {{occurred in}} the writing process. Like in {{the final version of}} the script, twins with mind-control abilities were the focus of Edlund's original pitch for the episode [...] "Simon Said". However, the more powerful twin—kept secluded due to deformities—forced his brother to perceive himself as retarded. At the end of the episode, his brother ate him in retaliation. The story was eventually changed, and instead focused on questions such as [...] "What do you do with power?". Kripke felt that this fit greatly with the series' storyline, because Sam was uncomfortable with his developing abilities; the writers wanted to explore one of the psychic children who took his ability as a gift. [...] "Folsom Prison Blues" [...] stemmed from Kripke's desire to feature prison ghosts, and the initial plot had FBI Agent Henriksen finally capturing the brothers and sending them to prison. However, this caused a major complication: the writers would have to devise a way for Sam and Dean to escape in the end. Writer John Shiban suggested that the brothers be arrested on purpose in order to work a job, with the prison's <b>head</b> <b>guard</b> being revealed as a family friend.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} prevalence, nature and {{pathogenesis}} of injuries in boxing. Following an introductory chapter and literature review (Chapters 1 and 2 respectively); Chapter 3 examines {{injuries in the}} GB boxing squad from 2005 to 2009. There were a total of 66 boxers on the squad during this period 61 % were injured, a total of 297 injuries were recorded. The injury rate in competition was at least 460 times higher than in training, and most injuries were new rather than recurrent (246 v 51). The incidence of concussion is comparatively low compared to other studies in amateur boxing (5 in 5 years). Hand and wrist injuries were the most frequent (23. 2 %). Chapter 4 describes the nature of hand and wrist injuries in more detail. ‘Boxers’ knuckle’, skiers thumb, Bennett’s fracture and carpometacarpal instability were the most frequent hand and wrist injuries and also took the longest time to recover compared to all other hand and wrist injuries that occurred. These injuries occur significantly more frequently in competition than in training (347 injuries per 1, 000 hours in competition less than 0. 5 per 1000 hours in training). Chapter 5 describes efforts to identify and validate a means to measure the pressure at each knuckle, given that ‘boxers’ knuckle’ {{was found to be}} such a debilitating injury. This does differentiate between the proportion of knuckle impact forces (PKIF) displayed during punching and no punching but displays very poor test-re-test reliability. This method might allow the impact of changes in the hand wraps or the gloves to be measured. Chapters 6 and 7 deal with head injury in boxing. <b>Head</b> <b>guards</b> were removed from amateur boxers in 2013. The effect of this removal on boxers’ health was investigated by reviewing the number of bouts stopped due to blows to the head both with and without <b>head</b> <b>guards</b> (Chapter 6). To improve the quality of this analysis, an examination of video from championships with and without <b>head</b> <b>guards</b> (Chapter 7) was carried out. A significant decrease in observable signs of concussion (p< 0. 05) and a significant increase in cuts (p< 0. 001) was observed when the <b>head</b> <b>guards</b> were removed. This work will have implications for the protection of boxers’ hands and the use of <b>head</b> <b>guards</b> in other contact sports...|$|R

[...] The Philippine National Police has a special police force assigned at LRT-1 and LRT-2 [...] and security police provided by private companies are assigned to all stations with each having a designated <b>head</b> <b>guard.</b> [...] Closed-circuit televisions have been installed to monitor stations and keep track of suspicious activities. [...] To better prepare for and improve {{response to}} any adverse incidents, drills simulating terror attacks and earthquakes have been conducted. [...] It is standard practice for bags to be inspected upon entry into stations by guards equipped with hand-held metal detectors. [...] Those who refuse to submit to such inspection may be denied entry. [...] Since May 1, 2007, the LRTA has enforced a policy against making false bomb threats, a policy already enforced at airports nationwide. [...] Those who make such threats can face penalties in violation of Presidential Decree No.1727, as well as face legal action. [...] Posted notices on station walls and inside trains remind passengers to be careful and be wary of criminals who may take advantage of the crowding aboard the trains. [...] To address concerns of inappropriate contact on crowded trains, the first coach of Yellow Line trains have been designated for females only.|$|E
