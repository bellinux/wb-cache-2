5000|$|Flake Hammerscale is {{produced}} in large quantities during multiple stages of the smithing process. To create the pure iron necessary for forging, a smith must first purify the iron ore. The smelting of ore creates a ‘bloom’, a porous mixture of slag and metal. The smith then repeatedly heats and hammers the bloom to remove impurities. This technique creates hammerscale of varying composition. As the purification process continues, the hammerscale’s iron content increases. [...] Additional hammerscale {{is produced}} during the forging of the pure iron from the heating and hammering necessary to shape the piece. The scale produced at this stage is characterized by its blue-black color and tends to be slimmer and darker due to its incredibly high iron oxide content. Archeologists believe that spheroidal hammerscale is produced primarily during the process known as <b>fire</b> <b>welding.</b> Also known as forge welding, this technique is used to connect two pieces of metal by heating them to a high temperature and forcing them together with a hammer or other tool. For this method to be successful, the surface of each piece of metal must be molten. As the smith hammers the pieces together, some metal is forced out from between them, often {{in the form of}} a molten jet which cools in the air to form spheroidal hammer scale. It is also possible for spheroidal hammerscale to form during the purification of slag. As the smith hammers a bloom, it compacts which can drive molten metal out of the slag into the air.|$|E

5000|$|The dressed metal {{goes back}} in the fire, is brought near to welding heat, removed from the fire, and brushed. Flux is {{sometimes}} applied, which prevents oxygen from reaching and burning the metal during forging, and it is returned to the fire. The smith now watches carefully to avoid overheating the metal. There is some challenge to this because, to see {{the color of the}} metal, the smith must remove it from the fire—exposing it to air, which can rapidly oxidize it. So the smith might probe into the fire with a bit of steel wire, prodding lightly at the mating faces. When the end of the wire sticks on to the metal, it is at the right temperature (a small weld forms where the wire touches the mating face, so it sticks). The smith commonly places the metal in the fire so he can see it without letting surrounding air contact the surface. (Note that smiths don't always use flux, especially in the UK.)Now the smith moves with rapid purpose, quickly taking the metal from the fire to the anvil and bringing the mating faces together. A few light hammer taps bring the mating faces into complete contact and squeeze out the flux—and finally, the smith returns the work to the <b>fire.</b> The <b>weld</b> begins with the taps, but often the joint is weak and incomplete, so the smith reheats the joint to welding temperature and works the weld with light blows to [...] "set" [...] the weld and finally to dress it to the shape.|$|R
