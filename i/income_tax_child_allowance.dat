This paper examines the efficiency cost of providing <b>child</b> <b>tax</b> benefits. A representative agent model is used to show how the efficiency cost of providing <b>child</b> <b>tax</b> benefits depends on labor supply and fertility elasticities. The model reveals that cross-price substitution effect for labor supply and children is of primary importance in calculating the efficiency cost. However, there are no estimates of this parameter in the literature. This paper uses data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) to estimate this parameter. The estimated cross-price substitution effect implies that children and time spent outside of employment are complements.

Since the <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> rate was then 1 shilling, two pence in the pound (5.83%), the value of the tax credit was therefore 11 shillings and eight pence per child.

In the early 1980 ’s Australia had a highly progressive individual <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> and universal family payments.

40|$|Currently, {{debates about}} the merits of {{one form or another}} of day care {{frequently}} miss some significant issues and hence some of the important policy options may be ruled out or in for the wrong reasons. Here, child day care is layed on a spectrum one end of which offers maximum market freedom in the form of income redistribution, a negative <b>income</b> <b>tax,</b> <b>children</b> 2 ̆ 7 s allowance, or other transfer assistance, to be spent on the market if so desired for day care services, and {{on the other end of}} the spectrum a system of comprehensive child day care centers. In between are various mixtures of the two and various special blends like voucher systems. Hopefully, by so arraying the issues and discussing them certain similarities between antipoverty and child care policy become evident and certain problems of transfers in cash or provision in kind can be clarified. Various day care policy options are discussed in relationship to assumptions that they make about cost, theories of child development, definitions of universality, the preference of parents, returns to scale, economic rationality, market responsiveness, quality, consumer democracy, and citizen control. Finally three central issues which lie outside of this analysis, freedom, political environment, and the target group to whom day care should be directed are discussed. In this discussion the point is made that day care is best conceived of as directed toward mothers not toward children or families. It is the mother who is most in need of the benefit of day care policy most of the time and to whom reasonable policy of day care should be directed. This consideration quite alters what seem fairly reasonable conclusions in favor of market day care in favor of day care by voucher or by direct service...|$|R

The Earned <b>Income</b> <b>Tax</b> Credit (EITC), which provides a tax benefit to low-income working households and was expanded after the 1990 s welfare reform, is currently this country's largest cash transfer program for low-income families with children. This article examines the historical components of the EITC. We then analyze the program's child poverty reduction effectiveness by comparing the percent and percentage point declines in the child poverty rate {{accounted for by the}} EITC benefit for six years between 1996 and 2005. Figures for the first four years were drawn from previous studies, while figures for the final two years were estimated with a U. S. Census Bureau calculator. All of the analyses used Current Population Survey data. We determined that the percent decline in the child poverty rate attributed to the EITC generally increased during this period (highest percent was 19. 5 in 2005), while the percentage point decline remained relatively stable. We then critically examine four poverty reduction assumptions of the EITC that limit its ability to further reduce child poverty and draw social policy implications.

Therefore, under full employment, it decreases per capita consumption. In the presence of unemployment, however, it reduces the deflationary gap and hence stimulates per capita consumption. ...|$|R

The treatment of children in the German system confers tax advantages relatively similar to those obtained by the family quotient, in particular for the first two children. On the other hand the tax advantages obtained in the French system grow more quickly in step with income and have a lesser effect on the reduction of inequalities and the benefits given by the French system for the third child are higher thanks to the additional whole-point on the family quotient. <b>Income</b> Inequalities, <b>Income</b> <b>Tax,</b> Family Splitting, <b>Child</b> Benefits, France and Germany...|$|R

To encourage employment as the primary path to economic security, a comprehensive work support system should accomplish two goals: Provide adequate family resources.
