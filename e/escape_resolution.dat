40|$|Ion {{channels}} of high conductance (> 200 pS) are widespread among prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Two examples, the Escherichia coli mechanosensitive ion channels Ec-MscS and Ec-MscL, pass currents of 125 – 300 pA. To resolve temporal details of conductance transitions, a patch-clamp setup was optimized for low-noise recordings {{at a time}} resolution of 3 µs (10 – 20 times faster than usual). Analyses of the high-resolution recordings confirm that Ec-MscL visits many subconductance states and show {{that most of the}} intersubstate transitions occur more slowly than the effective resolution of 3 µs. There is a clear trend toward longer transition times for the larger transitions. In Ec-MscS recordings, the majority of the observed full conductance transitions are also composite. We detected a short-lived (~ 20 µs) Ec-MscS substate at 2 / 3 of full conductance; transitions between 2 / 3 and full conductance did not show fine structure and had a time course limited by the achieved resolution. Opening and closing transitions in MscS are symmetrical and are not preceded or followed by smaller, rapid currents ("anticipations" or "regrets"). Compared with other, lower-conductance channels, these measurements may detect unusually early states in the transitions from fully closed to fully open. Increased temporal resolution at the single-molecule level reveals that some elementary steps of structural transitions are composite and follow several alternative pathways, while others still <b>escape</b> <b>resolution.</b> High-bandwidth, low-noise single-channel measurements may provide details about state transitions in other high-conductance channels; and similar procedures may also be applied to channel- and nanopore-based single-molecule DNA measurements...|$|E
50|$|In the Greenland oxygen isotope record, the Older Dryas {{appears as}} a {{downward}} peak establishing a small, low-intensity gap between the Bølling and the Allerød. That configuration presents a difficulty in estimating its time, as it {{is more of a}} point than a segment. The segment is small enough to <b>escape</b> the <b>resolution</b> of most carbon-14 series, as the points are not close enough together to find the segment.|$|R
40|$|Bioethics {{originated}} as {{a specific}} collective response of representatives of biomedical sciences, humanities and the public {{to the complexity of}} moral, anthropological and ontological problems (often in situations bordering on life and death) caused by constant development of biomedical technologies. These problems escape simple, universal (eternal) solutions. This makes them “finite”, multiple, dependent on the “here and now” circumstances of the choise of cognitive and communicative transdisciplinary strategies. The word “transdisciplinary” means interdisciplinary biomedical practices where in order to achieve common solutions and understand their common problem as a whole, it is necessary to transcend the area of expert authority and move into the area of “life-world”. From the philosophical point of view the idea of complexity can be interpreted as a network of relationships between the ideas of multiplicity and unity. The problem is to bring out through communication a unity of different kinds of unities presented in philosophy, theology, science, humanities and public discourses. To some extent transdisciplinarity is experience of paradoxes. They <b>escape</b> final <b>resolution</b> and give rise to ever new interpretations, have a permanent tendency to reemerge in ever new situation. They operate like “causa sue” of transdisciplinary communications in bioethics.  </p...|$|R
5|$|Otters do not {{dramatically}} reduce prey {{populations in}} the wild, generally speaking. When a copious supply of food dwindles or other prey becomes available, otters either transfer to a new location or convert their dietary choices to the most adequate prey. When left unchecked, though, otter depredations can be quite significant under certain circumstances (e.g. in hatcheries or other fish culture facilities). Likewise, the potential predatory impact of otters may be considerable whenever fish are physically confined (most commonly in smaller ponds offering sparse cover or other <b>escape</b> options). <b>Resolution</b> of such conflicts will usually require removal and/or relocation of nuisance otters. Even in larger bodies of water, they may take disproportional advantage of any seasonal concentrations of fish when and where only very limited areas of suitable spawning, low-flow, or over-wintering habitat may exist. Even such fast-swimming species as trout become lethargic in extremely cold water, with a commensurate increase in their vulnerability to predation. As such, careful consideration of any threatened, endangered, or fish species of special interest is warranted prior to reintroduction of otters to a watershed. Although other prey species are of temporary significance to the river otter, the deciding factor whether the river otter can establish itself as a permanent resident of one location is the year-round availability of fish.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{molecular}} basis of sensory hair cell mechanotransduction is largely unknown. In {{order to identify}} genes that are essential for mechanosensory hair cell function, we characterized a group of recently isolated zebrafish motility mutants. These mutants are defective in balance and swim in circles but have no obvious morphological defects. We examined the mutants using calcium imaging of acoustic-vibrational and tactile <b>escape</b> responses, high <b>resolution</b> microscopy of sensory neuroepithelia in live larvae, and recordings of extracellular hair cell potentials (microphonics). Based on the analyses, we have identified several classes of genes. Mutations in sputnik and mariner affect hair bundle integrity. Mutant astronaut and cosmonaut hair cells have relatively normal microphonics and thus appear to affect events downstream of mechanotransduction. Mutant orbiter, mercury, and gemini larvae have normal hair cell morphology and yet {{do not respond to}} acoustic-vibrational stimuli. The microphonics of lateral line hair cells of orbiter, mercury, and gemini larvae are absent or strongly reduced. Therefore, these genes may encode components of the transduction apparatus...|$|R
