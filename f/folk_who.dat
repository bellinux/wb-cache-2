5|$|On February 11, 1789, Allen {{traveled}} to South Hero, Vermont {{with one of}} his workers to visit his cousin, Ebenezer Allen, and to collect a load of hay. After an evening spent with friends and acquaintances, he spent the night there, and set out the next morning for home. While accounts of the return journey are not entirely consistent, Allen apparently suffered an apoplectic fit en route, and was unconscious by the time they returned home. Allen died at home several hours later, without ever regaining consciousness. He was buried four days later in the Green Mount Cemetery in Burlington. The funeral was attended by dignitaries from the Vermont government, and by large numbers of common <b>folk</b> <b>who</b> turned out to pay respects to a man many considered their champion.|$|E

25|$|Aside from {{folk and}} {{regional}} dances (southern Thailand's Indian-influenced manohra dance, for example), {{the two major}} forms of Thai classical dance drama are khon and lakon nai. In the beginning, both were exclusively court entertainments {{and it was not}} until much later that a popular style of dance theater, likay, evolved as a diversion for common <b>folk</b> <b>who</b> had no access to royal performances.|$|E
25|$|The British {{rock band}} Blur {{released}} {{a cover of}} the song, with each member taking a verse. The release was limited to 500 7-inch pressings, which were given out at a concert in 1992. The version of 'The Wassailing Song' performed by Blur was later adapted in a recording by The Grizzly <b>Folk,</b> <b>who</b> have stated that the arrangement bears a close resemblance to the 'Gloucestershire Wassail'.|$|E

25|$|In 1537, {{the city}} was made a county corporate. In 1549, the city {{successfully}} withstood a month-long siege by the so-called Prayer Book rebels: Devon and Cornish <b>folk</b> <b>who</b> had been infuriated by the radical religious policies of King Edward VI. The insurgents occupied the suburbs of Exeter, burnt down two of the city gates and attempted to undermine the city walls, but were eventually forced to abandon the siege after they had been worsted {{in a series of}} bloody battles with the king’s army. A number of rebels were executed {{in the immediate aftermath of}} the siege. The Livery Dole almshouses and chapel at Heavitree were founded in March 1591 and finished in 1594.|$|E
25|$|As a {{literary}} theory, postcolonialism {{deals with the}} literatures produced by the peoples who once were colonies of the European imperial powers (e.g. Britain, France, and Spain); and the literatures of the decolonized countries engaged in contemporary, postcolonial arrangements (e.g. Organisation internationale de la Francophonie and the Commonwealth of Nations) with their former mother countries. Postcolonial literary criticism comprehends the literatures written by the colonizer and the colonized, wherein the subject matter includes portraits of the colonized peoples and their lives as imperial subjects. In Dutch literature, the Indies Literature includes the colonial and postcolonial genres, which examine and analyze {{the formation of a}} postcolonial identity, and the postcolonial culture produced by the diaspora of the Indo-European peoples, the Eurasian <b>folk</b> <b>who</b> originated from Indonesia; the peoples who were the colony of the Dutch East Indies; in the literature, the notable author is Tjalie Robinson.|$|E

Harrison said at the time: [...] "I don't want to sound ungrateful, but why are the Beatles on the same stage as a mass of show {{business}} greats?... We're just four normal <b>folk</b> <b>who</b> have had a couple of hit records." [...] The fourth and final nationwide tour of 1963 had a duration of six weeks, and ended on 13 December 1963.|$|E
500|$|For the {{research}} facility at [...] "Taskerlands", Kneale {{was influenced by}} a visit he had paid to the BBC's research and development facility which was based at an old country house at Kingswood Warren in Kingswood, Surrey. Similarly, {{the research}}ers working at Kingswood Warren influenced the portrayal {{of the members of}} the Ryan research team in The Stone Tape. Kneale recalled of his visit to Kingswood Warren, [...] "The sort of impression you got of the <b>folk</b> <b>who</b> worked there was a boyishness. [...] They were very cheerful. It was all rather fun for them, which is a very clever way to go about doing that sort of heavy research... They were nice chaps– and so we got some very nice chaps for the TV version".|$|E

2500|$|While {{the cathedral}} was under construction, a {{temporary}} wooden cathedral was erected, {{and one of}} Blacket's first jobs {{was to create a}} stained-glass window for it. Being unable to acquire coloured glass, he painted plain glass and fired it, using part of the crypt beneath St James, King Street, as his studio. This window, which predated commercial stained glass manufacture in Australia, has unfortunately been lost. Blacket was very pleased with it and wrote to his brother Frank [...] "the <b>folk</b> <b>who</b> come to see it...can hardly believe it is not stained glass." ...|$|E
2500|$|Starting in {{the late}} 1870s Exner began {{painting}} themes from Fanø, a Danish island in the North Sea off {{the west coast of}} Jutland, the Danish mainland. [...] He came to the island {{for the first time in}} 1877. [...] He and his family spent the summers there annually for many years to come. [...] He had a studio at Sønderho Kro. [...] There he found a group of people whose lives interested him deeply, a <b>folk</b> <b>who</b> were fast becoming extinguished in the social changes of that time. [...] These themes made excellent subjects for his painting until his death.|$|E

2500|$|Boardwalk Empire is {{a period}} drama {{focusing}} on Enoch [...] "Nucky" [...] Thompson (based on the historical Enoch L. Johnson), a political figure who rose to prominence and controlled Atlantic City, New Jersey, during the Prohibition period of the 1920s and 1930s. Nucky acts with historical characters in both his personal and political life, including mobsters, politicians, government agents, and the common <b>folk</b> <b>who</b> look up to him. The federal government also takes {{an interest in the}} bootlegging and other illegal activities in the area, sending agents to investigate possible mob connections but also looking at Nucky's lifestyle—expensive and lavish for a county political figure. The final season jumps ahead seven years, to 1931, as Prohibition nears its end.|$|E
2500|$|Jack de Manio {{became its}} {{principal}} presenter in 1958. He {{was held in}} affection by listeners, but became notorious for on-air gaffes (announcing a documentary on Nigeria titled 'The Land of Niger' as 'The Land of Nigger', and referring to Yoko Ono as [...] "Yoko Hama, or whatever her name is", for instance). In 1970 the programme format was changed so {{that there were two}} presenters each day. De Manio left in 1971, and in the late 1970s the team of John Timpson and Brian Redhead became established. Timpson had been critical of the content, style and professionalism of Today—describing it once as [...] "not so much a programme, more a way of telling the time" [...] and being filled with [...] "eccentric octogenarians, prize pumpkins, and <b>folk</b> <b>who</b> ate lightbulbs and spiders".|$|E
2500|$|During the {{intervening}} age, the Terrestrial Exalted became {{the rulers of}} the world, ruling in a system not unlike the Shogunate of feudal Japan. After the Great Contagion (a plague engineered by the Neverborn to swell {{the population of the}} underworld and weaken Creation) and the Balorian Crusade (a war with the Fair <b>Folk,</b> <b>who</b> seek to return the world to Chaos) wrought devastation across Creation, a young captain of the Dragon-Blooded armies gained access to powerful weapons of the First Age. With these, she first beat back the Balorian Crusade, and then asserted her rulership over much of the world, dubbing herself the Scarlet Empress. [...] Nearly eight hundred years later—in the present day of the game—there are eleven Great Houses of the Realm, nearly all of whom claim direct descent from the Empress.|$|E
