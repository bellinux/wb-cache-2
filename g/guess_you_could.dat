500|$|In the 21st century, {{the song}} {{continued}} to draw commentary from listeners. [...] By now Kaukonen was offering {{the view that}} the [...] "blood-stained banders" [...] of the lyric was an allusion to the Ku Klux Klan. He continued to find meaning in performing [...] "Good Shepherd" [...] and other songs like it that celebrated religion in one context or another without preaching, saying such material gave him a doorway into scripture: [...] "I <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> say I loved the Bible without even knowing it. The spiritual message is always uplifting – it's a good thing." ...|$|E

[...] Saxophonist Benny Golson commented that Ibn Ali [...] "became very skilled at the modern sounds, and then went right past them into something very esoteric. He went way out there. I <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> say his brakes didn't work." ...|$|E
500|$|During an {{interview}} for his new television series Homeland, 24 executive producer Howard Gordon addressed {{the impact of the}} series, describing it as [...] "stunning - everyone from Rush Limbaugh to Bill Clinton would talk about it, and we knew they were among our fans. I guess when people used it as propaganda for their own ideas—you know, when Justice Scalia mentioned Jack Bauer—that would make me feel uncomfortable." [...] On the topic of torture and Islamophobia within the series, Gordon said, [...] "I think the one thing that we all felt very confident about—although we had a vigorous behind-the-scenes debate—was at what point are we loyal and beholden to good storytelling, and at what level do you hold yourself accountable for things like stoking Islamophobia or promoting torture as a policy? There were just certain things that we needed to portray {{in order to make it}} feel thrilling—and real, even. When discussing his regrets, he referred to an advertisement for the show for its fourth season (though mistakenly quoted it as an advertisement for the second season, saying [...] "I actually do have regrets about one particular moment, which had more to do with the promotion of the show. In season four, the story involved a Muslim American family, and the father and the mother—and the son—were party to a terror plot. It was sort of a purple conceit in a way. But it was maybe a year and a half after 9/11, and on the 405 freeway there's this giant electronic billboard, and I think the line was: [...] "They could be next door." [...] The writers and the producers were not party to that campaign, but we quickly put an end to it, and realized how dangerous and potentially incendiary this show could be. And I think our awareness of that changed the way we approached the series. So I <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> call it a regret, but it was really an epiphany.|$|E

[...] "We've got to have a fight to get him off, make the best of it, and I've thought it over since the {{children}} spoke about it, and I couldn't seem to see Jackson willin' to go out to Californy or Colorady, to either of his brothers.

In an interview with Rolling Stone, Henley said that the song {{was meant to be}} [...] "more of a symbolic piece about America in general", and added: [...] "Lyrically, the song deals with traditional or classical themes of conflict: darkness and light, good and evil, youth and age, the spiritual versus the secular. [...] I <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> say it's a song about loss of innocence." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gibson was {{initially}} reluctant {{to accept the}} role of Guy Hamilton. [...] "I didn't necessarily see my role as a great challenge. My character was, like the film suggests, a puppet. And I went with that. It wasn't some star thing, even though they advertised it that way." [...] Gibson saw some similarities {{between himself and the}} character of Guy. [...] "He's not a silver-tongued devil. He's kind of immature and he has some rough edges and I <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> say the same for me."

[...] Drummer Darren King has also stated that he does not consider the band to be Christian. While Armistice explored themes of doubt and pessimism that the band has {{gone so far as to}} call [...] "atheistic," [...] Meany stated that the idea for the album Odd Soul was [...] "loosely based on our upbringing in what I <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> call eccentric Christianity," [...] and King further explained that they wanted to celebrate [...] "their weird religious roots."

2500|$|The group's ninth album overall, seventh for Columbia Records, {{and second}} {{released}} on the ARC label was I Am.

Though the band had previously overlooked disco, the summer of 1979 saw EWF topping the dance music charts with their most disco-inspired single, [...] "Boogie Wonderland," [...] which was produced by Maurice and Al McKay and featured The Emotions. (Its lyrics detail the down side of the discothèque genre and lifestyle.)
