40|$|Purpose – Capital {{budgeting}} is a {{key issue}} in corporate finance and over time major theoretical developments have been incorporated into the appraisal processes of capital intensive companies. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to investigate the capital budgeting practices of a sample of motor manufacturing companies in South Africa and compare the empirical findings to the existing literature in order to establish whether the theoretical aspects are still widely practiced. Design/methodology/approach – Semi-structured personal interviews were conducted with respondents at eight motor manufacturers in the Eastern Cape and Gauteng provinces of South Africa. Findings – The net present value (NPV) and internal rate of return criteria are the two most popular appraisals methods used in practice. Most respondents used multiple criteria before making substantial capital investments. These findings conform to contemporary capital budgeting theory. Practical implications – Financial managers should first calculate the <b>discounted</b> <b>payback</b> <b>period</b> of a project before embarking on a more detailed analysis. Once all the data are available, NPV should be used as the primary means of evaluating investments, as this criterion gives the best indication of how much shareholder value the project will add. It is further recommended that more attention be given to “green” considerations in the capital budgeting process. Originality/value – The paper evaluates the applicability of existing literature on capital budgeting to the practice thereof in a capital intensive industry in South Africa.

The use of SWH systems is motivated by the desire to reduce energy consumption and especially to reduce a major source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The purposes of the present paper consist in: assessing the solar potential; analysing the possibility of using solar energy to heat water for residential applications in Romania; investigating the economic potential of SWH systems; and their contribution to saving energy and reducing CO 2 emissions. The results showed that if solar systems are used, the annual energy savings amount to approximately 71 %, and the reduction of GHG emissions into the atmosphere are of 18. 5 tonnes of CO 2 over the lifespan of the system, with a <b>discounted</b> <b>payback</b> <b>period</b> of 6. 8 – 8. 6 years, in accordance with the savings achieved depending on system characteristics, the solar radiation available, ambient air temperature and on heating load characteristics. Financially, the installation of SWH systems determines net savings of 805 – 1151 Euro in a 25 -year period in the absence of governmental subsidies. According to the sensitivity analysis, installing a SWH system with subsidies of up to 50 % determines the reduction of the <b>discounted</b> <b>payback</b> <b>period</b> to 3. 1 – 3. 9 years and the increase of net savings to 1570 – 1916 Euro.

The inclusion of a decentralised wastewater treatment plant has the ability to reduce demand on local resources, minimise resource waste and provide multiple educational and research opportunities for Murdoch University. The aim of this report is to provide a conceptual framework for water recycling and reclamation for Murdoch University Eastern Precinct and its expansion and integration with South Street core campus by way of: Literature review of concepts relating to decentralised recycled water systems and the current legislative frameworks. Assessing suitable wastewater recycling technologies using Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis; and Technology and economic assessment. Review of literature found that South-West of Western Australia is increasingly facing challenges to water supply due to a drying climate and increased water demand due to rapid population growth. There is a need for demonstration projects to facilitate an increase in the uptake of decentralised wastewater recycling systems in Western Australia. Demonstration projects will contribute to the improvement of current regulatory processes and support a shift towards more sustainable urban water practices. The inclusion of a decentralised wastewater treatment plant in the Murdoch University Eastern Precinct development has the ability to reduce demand on local resources, minimise resource waste and provide multiple educational and research opportunities for Murdoch University. Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis was used to determine wastewater recycling technologies suitable to the Murdoch University Eastern Precinct.

This is done by comparing the capital expenditure and operational cost needed with the financial benefits generated by the investment, taking into consideration the size of the household. Design and method: A literature study was done on the different alternative water heating systems in order to obtain a better understanding of how these systems operate and what savings they can generate. Different investment appraisals were identified and a literature review was performed in order to identify the most appropriate investment appraisals for the purpose of this study. It was found that the net present value, equivalent annual annuity, internal rate of return, modified internal rate of return, accounting rate of return, <b>discounted</b> <b>payback</b> <b>period</b> and the economic value added were the best investment appraisal methods to use for the purpose of this study. Findings and conclusion: It was found that the five investment options identified in the literature review would all, to some extent, be financially viable to implement within households with high as well as low volume hot water consumption. All the investment appraisals gave positive outcomes. The conclusion was made that a saving will be generated on the monthly electricity bill no matter what alternative water heating system were to be installed in the place of a conventional geyser. Recommendations: It is recommended that a household with low volume hot water consumption should install a time switch as this investment option renders the highest IRR, MIRR, ARR and <b>discounted</b> <b>payback</b> <b>period.</b> The second best investment option for a household with low volume hot water consumption is a heat pump and the third best option is a gas geyser. For a household with high volume hot water consumption, the best investment options is again a time switch, as this renders the best IRR, MIRR, ARR and <b>discounted</b> <b>payback</b> <b>period.</b> The second best investment option is a heat pump, with a gas geyser as the third best investment option. Value of the research: This study focuses on five alternative water heating systems for a household within South Africa in times where electricity charges sharply increase. The financial viability of each of the alternatives is determined through various investment appraisals and the best option can be identified by comparing the outcomes of the alternatives. Furthermore, each individual is able to determine the viability of the alternatives by using the Excel model attached to this study and by inputting his/her own variables, where applicable. Research limitation: Limited literature was available on the different alternative water heating systems. No indication could be found of the maintenance cost of the different water heating systems. Assumptions had to be made with regard to households, although no two households are the same. Areas for further research: The same study could be performed, but with the focus on small businesses and large organisations. Furthermore, a study could be performed to determine the appropriate discount rate for individuals as well as the maintenance cost for water heating systems. Master...|$|R
40|$|Bachelor thesis Economic Analysis of a {{biogas plant}} {{deals with the}} {{evaluation}} of investments in the biogas plant in Velké Chvojno. The thesis is divided into theoretical and practical part, which is supplemented by discussions. The first part is a literature review, which deals with history, the composition and process of biogas production. The following describes {{the main components of}} a biogas plant and its economy. The last part of literature review is devoted to methods of evaluating investments. In the practical part, at first, the biogas plant in the Velké Chvojno is described. It describes how to create a table of cash flow and income and expenses of the biogas plant are characterized. Subsequently, an assessment of the cost structure of a biogas plant is made, attention is also paid to the structure of raw materials both in terms of cost and weight proportion. Furthermore, a calculation of net present value, internal rate of return and <b>discounted</b> <b>payback</b> <b>period.</b> Among the methods which do not include the time value of money is calculated using the method of simple payback return. The last part, discussion, evaluates the acquired calculations and includes herein a draft for improvement...|$|R
40|$|Energy Storage (ES) {{has been}} seen as a crucial element in active {{distribution}} networks. It facilitates a high penetration level of intermittent renewable energy in power systems thus provide several technical and economic benefits to the utility and consumer. However, given a high capital cost associated with ES, it is crucial to develop an effective planning strategy to avail the maximum benefit. This paper proposes a methodology to determine the optimal location and capacity of Community Energy Storage (CES) units by considering all their possible benefits and costs. The benefits are obtained from energy arbitrage, peaking power generation, energy losses reduction, Transmission and Distribution (T&D) system upgrade deferral, CO 2 emission reduction and VAr support, while the costs include CES 2 ̆ 7 s capital, replacement and Operational and Maintenance (O&M) costs. A comprehensive cost-benefit analysis is conducted to identify the optimal Net Present Value (NPV), <b>Discounted</b> <b>Payback</b> <b>Period</b> (DPP) and Benefit Cost ratio (BCR) of CES investment starting at current year, year 2025 and 2035. Numerical results show that the proposed strategy is able to specify the optimal location and size of CES unit for maximizing the NPV. Some interesting findings are also discussed in the paper...|$|R
