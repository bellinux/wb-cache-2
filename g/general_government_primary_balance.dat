This paper therefore adjusts South Africa's <b>general</b> <b>government</b> <b>primary</b> <b>balance</b> for terms-of-trade effects by means of an alternative calculation of the transitory component based on a measure of the real income gap rather than the real output gap. The results indicate that measures of the cyclical component of the budget balance based on real income and real output gaps generally yield broadly similar results over history, but during exceptional periods of rapid changes in commodity prices, the measures can be very different.

40|$|There {{are many}} {{positive}} aspects associated with subnational borrowing, including additional funding and promoting intergenerational equity. However, {{it may also}} endanger fiscal sustainability and macro stability due to moral hazard and soft budget constraints, making borrowing controls justified and common. This study reviews {{the different types of}} ex-ante and ex-post subnational borrowing regulations used in the international experience based on a large panel of developed and developing countries. Each type of regulations has advantages and disadvantages, with varying suitability to a country's circumstances. It is found that the presence of subnational tax autonomy contributes to an increase in the <b>general</b> <b>government</b> <b>primary</b> <b>balance</b> but not significantly for subnational primary balances. A history of subnational bailouts is associated with lower primary balances, on average, at all levels. The "golden rule" and limits on debt and borrowing appear effective at all levels of government. However, none of the broad types of subnational borrowing regulations seem to have a distinct significant direct effect on the narrow definition of fiscal sustainability at the subnational level...|$|E

With higher social transfers offset by a lower burden of defense spending, expansion reflected a baby-boom driven rise in education spending.

More rigid exchange rate policies, however, encourage fiscal discipline and may imply better stabilization properties compared to flexible inflation targeting rules, if the economy is mainly subject to cost-push shocks.

This action makes fiscal sustainability easier to achieve in the long run. On the other hand, for Latvia, Poland, Romania, and Slovakia, sustainable fiscal policy will be more difficult to attain given the opposite response of governments to public debt shocks.
