5000|$|After {{the electoral}} failure, Arana {{continued}} {{to try to}} get elected representatives to support him, through threats and persuasion. He talked to José Manuel Fortuny, a leftist leader in the PAR. Fortuny later said that Arana asked him [...] "Why don't you and your <b>friends</b> <b>like</b> <b>me?</b> I'm not a man of the right," [...] to which Fortuny responded [...] "We are not against you. We appreciate the role that you played in the revolt against Ponce. It's just that you have no sympathy for labour." [...] By 1949 the National Renovation Party and the PAR were both openly hostile to Arana. A small faction of the Popular Liberation Front (FPL) supported him, but was soundly defeated at the FPL party convention in 1949. As a result, the faction split off to support Arana. The leftist parties decided to back Árbenz instead, as they believed that only a military officer could defeat Arana. In 1947, Arana had demanded that certain labor leaders be expelled from the country; Árbenz vocally disagreed with Arana, and the latter's intervention limited the number of deportees.|$|R

A week later, Amelin talked about the song during a video interview on his official YouTube channel, stating :"That's a really sexy song.

6000|$|A High Class without {{duties to}} do is like a tree planted on precipices; from the roots of which all the earth has been crumbling. Nature owns no man {{who is not a}} Martyr withal. Is there a man who pretends to live luxuriously housed up; {{screened}} from all work, from want, danger, hardship, the victory over which is what we name work--he himself to sit serene, amid down-bolsters and appliances, and have all his work and battling done by other men? And such man calls himself a noble-man? His fathers worked for him, he says; or successfully gambled for him: here he sits; professes, not in sorrow but in pride, that he and his have done no work, time out of mind. It is the law of the land, and is thought to be the law of the Universe, that he, alone of recorded men, shall have no task laid on him, except that of eating his cooked victuals, and not flinging himself out of window. Once more I will say, there was no stranger spectacle ever shown under this Sun. A veritable fact in our England of the Nineteenth Century. His victuals he does eat: but as for keeping in the inside of the window,--have not his <b>friends,</b> <b>like</b> <b>me,</b> enough to do? Truly, looking at his Corn-Laws, Game-Laws, Chandos-Clauses, Bribery-Elections and much else, you do shudder over the tumbling and plunging he makes, held back by the lapels and coatskirts; only a thin fence of window-glass before him,--and in the street mere horrid iron spikes! My sick brother, as in hospital-maladies men do, thou dreamest of Paradises and Eldorados, which are far from thee. 'Cannot I do what I like with my own?' Gracious Heaven, my brother, this that thou seest with those sick eyes is no firm Eldorado, and Corn-Law Paradise of Donothings, but a dream of thy own fevered brain. It is a glass-window, I tell thee, so many stories from the street; where are iron spikes and the law of gravitation! ...|$|R

Never should Englishmen drink his health more earnestly and solemnly than to-day, when rebels have driven {{him from his}} capital, and pestilent traitors {{threatened}} him with armed force. Perhaps, my <b>friends,</b> you, <b>like</b> <b>me,</b> may {{from time to time}} have grumbled when the tax-collectors have come round, and you have seen no one warrant for their demands. But if the king has been forced so to exceed his powers, it was in no slight degree because those at Westminster refused to grant him the sums which were needful. He has, too, been surrounded by bad advisers. I myself loved not greatly either Stratford or Laud. But I would rather bear their high-handed ways, which were at least aimed to strengthen the kingdom and for the honor of the king, than be ground by these petty tyrants at Westminster, who would shut up our churches, forbid us to smile on a Sunday, or to pray, except through our noses; who would turn merry England into a canting conventicle, and would rule us with a rod to which that of the king were as a willow wand. Therefore it is the duty of all true men and good to drink the health of his majesty the king, and confusion to his enemies." ...|$|R
5000|$|According to Jackson in Moonwalk, {{the song}} is about knowing that {{barriers}} separating him from others are seemingly easy to overcome, yet they cause him {{to miss out on}} what he really desires. He said that he cried from the sudden effect of the words because [...] "I had been letting so much build up inside me." [...] Particularly it reminded him of his feeling of being [...] "so rich in some experiences while being poor in moments of true joy." [...] He worried about this feeling showing up on the song, but also felt [...] "if it touched people's heartstrings, knowing that would make me feel less lonely." [...] He described making Off the Wall as [...] "one of the most difficult periods of my life...I had very few close friends at the time and felt very isolated." [...] He would walk through his neighborhood, hoping to meet people who didn't know who he was, so he could meet [...] "somebody who would be my <b>friend</b> because they <b>liked</b> <b>me</b> and needed a friend too, not because I was who I am." ...|$|R
60|$|Whenever I {{looked at}} {{the bow of the}} Snark or thought of her water- tight compartments, I was encouraged. Nobody else, however, was encouraged. My friends began to make bets against the various sailing dates of the Snark. Mr. Wiget, who was left behind in charge of our Sonoma ranch was the first to cash his bet. He {{collected}} on New Year's Day, 1907. After that the bets came fast and furious. My <b>friends</b> surrounded <b>me</b> <b>like</b> a gang of harpies, making bets against every sailing date I set. I was rash, and I was stubborn. I bet, and I bet, and I continued to bet; and I paid them all. Why, the women-kind of my friends grew so brave that those among them who never bet before began to bet with me. And I paid them, too.|$|R

50|$|Issued {{beginning}} on December 23, 1986, {{there have been}} four distinct series. The 1st launched in 1986 with Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah, followed by five more volumes. The 2nd series began appearing in August 1990 with Under the Sea and Disneyland Fun, featuring a new design and reissued volumes labeled One (1) through Twelve (12) in North America (worldwide, volume numbers). The 3rd series, beginning in 1994 with Circle of Life, saw another new package design and the re-release of all previous volumes (excluding Fun with Music, repackaged as 101 Notes of Fun along with Hercules for the non-North American market). Around 1996 this series incorporated Mickey's Fun Songs repackaged as Sing-Along Songs (a three volume live-action set {{in the style of}} Disneyland Fun). Spanish language editions of some volumes were released (Disney Canta Con Nosotros). Some songs moved to newer volumes, newly remixed opening and closing songs appeared, and the final release in this format was Flik's Musical Adventure at Disney's Animal Kingdom on June 8, 1999. During the remixed opening and closing themes, the remixed opening was heard on <b>Friend</b> <b>Like</b> <b>Me,</b> Circle of Life, Honor to Us All, and Collection of All-Time Favorites, and the remixed closing was heard on the 1993 and 1994 editions of Heigh-Ho, as well as <b>Friend</b> <b>Like</b> <b>Me,</b> Circle of Life, and Collection of All-Time Favorites. This series abandoned any new volume numbers, included only sporadically on third series volumes. A special three volume set, Collection of All-Time Favorites, was released in 1997. There have been over 30 titles released to home video. Newly remastered editions began appearing in 2002 on Disney DVD, beginning with Very Merry Christmas Songs, featuring a new package design, bonus features, and some new songs. Some Disney DVD feature releases include individual songs as bonus features. Winnie-the-Pooh Sing a Song volumes are being incorporated into the Sing Along Songs series.
