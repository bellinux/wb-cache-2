25|$|We {{left the}} town, fleeing this living picture of Sodom, with incessant fear lest the raging {{waters of the}} lake {{overtake}} us, which were at the moment invading {{the main part of}} the town, sweeping away everything they encountered. On the outskirts of the town, I came upon a woman who was so exhausted by her burden of two little children and a bundle of clothing that she could proceed no farther. Moved by pity, I took one of the toddlers from her and carried him, and the little indio who has been wailing while in the arms of his mother, stopped short when <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>him</b> into mine and never uttered a sound while I was carrying him a good piece of the way.|$|E
500|$|The {{video for}} [...] "Partition" [...] was {{directed}} by Jake Nava and was shot at the Parisian cabaret club, Crazy Horse. It was filmed quickly as Jay-Z had to travel to London for a concert after the shooting. In a video commentary to the album, Beyoncé said: [...] "The day that I got engaged was my husband's birthday and <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>him</b> to Crazy Horse. And I remember thinking, 'Damn, these girls are fly.' I {{just thought it was}} the ultimate sexy show I've ever seen. And I was like, 'I wish I was up there, I wish I could perform that for my man...' So that's what I did for the video." [...] Talking about the video, Nava noted that for the shooting Beyoncé was trying to be [...] "even more risque than she's been in the past". While filming, he further tried to [...] "create and capture a bit of genuine intimacy" [...] between the singer and her husband. During a commentary about the video for the song, Beyoncé revealed her motivation to film it by saying, ...|$|E
500|$|Murphy {{became a}} {{national}} celebrity following his World War II military service when Life magazine proclaimed him America's [...] "most decorated soldier" [...] in its 16 July 1945 issue cover story. That magazine cover {{brought him to the}} attention of veteran actor James Cagney who invited him to Hollywood. When Murphy arrived in California after his military discharge, Cagney cancelled the hotel reservations he'd made for Murphy and instead took him into his own home, [...] "I got the shock of my life. Audie was very thin. His complexion was bluish-gray." [...] Commenting years later on his first impression, Cagney said, [...] " [...] in such a nervous condition that I was afraid he might jump out of a window. <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>him</b> home and gave him my bed." [...] He spent three weeks as a guest of Cagney and then returned to Texas before finally agreeing to an offer from brothers James and William Cagney of $150 a week as a contract player with their production company. The Cagneys gave Murphy personal attention on acting techniques. He also took lessons at the Actors' Lab on Sunset Boulevard. Murphy studied voice techniques, learned judo, and trained with choreographer John Boyle, Cagney's dance coach for Yankee Doodle Dandy. A 1947 disagreement with William Cagney ended his association with the brothers without having been cast in a film production.|$|E

Bronstein wrote, in his acclaimed book The Sorcerer's Apprentice (page 102): [...] "Later, when I recognised the logical play of Furman, I invited him to be my assistant during preparation for the match [...] in 1951.

He began to explore superhero narrative with the comic strip The Blue Beetle, published [...] from January to March 1940, starring a character created by the pseudonymous Charles Nicholas, a house name that Kirby retained for the three-month-long strip. During this time, Kirby met and began collaborating with cartoonist and Fox editor Joe Simon, who {{in addition to his}} staff work continued to freelance. Simon recalled in 1988, [...] "I loved Jack's work and the first time I saw it I couldn't believe what I was seeing. He asked if we could do some freelance work together. I was delighted and <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>him</b> over to my little office. We worked from the second issue of Blue Bolt through... about 25 years." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kamal Hasan {{was close}} friend of Khanna and Kamal quoted in an {{interview}} [...] "He probably hadn’t been to a public theatre since he became a star. When we reached, things were okay. He enjoyed the mediocre film (The Swarm) thoroughly and refused to leave until the end titles. That’s when I panicked. This was Rajesh Khanna, {{the star of the}} millennium. If audiences got to know he was present there would be a stampede and blood on my hands. But Mr Khanna refused to listen. He stayed on till the end. The inevitable happened after the show. All hell broke loose as audiences realised he was there. I became Rajesh Khanna’s bodyguard and security officer as <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>him</b> through the crowd. His shirt was torn, but he was enjoying himself thoroughly. He giggled and chuckled like a child." [...] Khanna starred in remakes of 3 films of Kamal and in return Kamal acted in 2 remakes of Khanna's films.|$|E

2500|$|Next morning, Thursday, Sasun Eff. {{came in at}} 10; <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>him</b> {{straight}} to Sir Percy and left them. Half an hour later, he returned {{and told me that}} he had accepted and I understood the full significance of the Nunc Dimittis. He asked me what he could now do to help and I sent him {{straight to}} the Naqib. The leading Shi'ah of Baghdad had also refused to join the Council and it was essential to get him in. In the midst of this talk Sir Percy sent for me. I left Sasun to Mr Philby and went to consult with Sir Percy. We agreed that I should send at once for Ja'far, tell him what had happened and bid him bestir himself. It was past one o'clock before I caught Ja'far. We had the most extraordinary conversation. He told me he had come into the Cabinet, only to defeat Talib, that he distrusted and loathed him and regarded it as shameful that he should be one of the leading persons of Mesopotamia. I said that the Mesopotamians themselves had made him, by their fear and their servility, and that it was for them to unmake him if they wished. We then discussed how to win over the extremists, I assured him that that was Sir Percy's chief desire and taking heart, he asked if he might talk to Sir Percy. <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>him</b> at once to Sir Percy and left them together, with the assured conviction that Sir Percy was the best exponent of his own policy.”… “Oh, if we can pull this thing off! rope together the young hotheads, and the Shi'ah obscurantists, and enthusiasts like Ja'far, polished old statesmen like Sasun, and scholars like Shukri—if we can make them work together and find their own salvation for themselves, what a fine thing it will be. I see visions and dream dreams. But as we say in Arabic countless times a day [...] "Through the presence of His Excellency the Representative of the King, and with the help of the Great Government, all please God, must be well!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Emanuel Custer was {{an outspoken}} Democrat who taught his {{children}} politics and toughness {{at an early}} age. In a February 3, 1887 letter to his son's widow, Libby, he related an incident [...] "when Autie [...] was about four years old. He {{had to have a}} tooth drawn, [...] and he was very much afraid of blood. When <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>him</b> to the doctor to have the tooth pulled, it was in the night and I told him if it bled well it would get well right away, and he must be a good soldier. When he got to the doctor he took his seat, and the pulling began. The forceps slipped off and he had to make a second trial. He pulled it out, and Autie never even scrunched. Going home, I led him by the arm. He jumped and skipped, and said 'Father you and me can whip all the Whigs in Michigan.' I thought that was saying a good deal but I did not contradict him." ...|$|E

At 9 o'clock that evening, three white men came into camp and {{reported}} {{to me that a}} large band of Sioux warriors [...] camped 25 miles [...] northwest, waiting for an opportunity to attack the Pawnees for several days, anticipating that we would move up the river where buffaloes were feeding. Previous to this, white men visited us and warned us to be on our guard against Sioux attacks, and I was a trifle skeptical as to the truth of the story told by our white visitors. But one of the men, a young man about my age at the time, appeared to be so sincere in his efforts to impress upon me that the warning should be heeded, that <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>him</b> to Sky Chief who was in command that day, for a conference. Sky Chief said the men were liars; that they wanted to scare the Pawnees away from the hunting grounds so that white men could kill buffaloes for hides. He told me I was squaw and a coward. I took exception to his remarks, and retorted: 'I will go as far as you dare go. Don't forget that.' ...|$|E
