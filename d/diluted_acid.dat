5000|$|When a cell discharges, {{the lead}} and <b>diluted</b> <b>acid</b> undergo a {{chemical}} reaction that produces lead sulfate and water (see lead-acid battery for details of the chemical reaction). When a cell is subsequently charged, the lead sulfate and water are turned back into lead and acid. In all lead-acid battery designs, charging current must be adjusted to match {{the ability of the}} battery to absorb the energy. If the charging current is too great, electrolysis will occur, decomposing water into hydrogen and oxygen, in addition to the intended conversion of lead sulfate and water into lead dioxide, lead, and sulfuric acid (the reverse of the discharge process.) If these gases are allowed to escape, as in a conventional flooded cell, the battery will need to have water (or electrolyte) added from time to time. In contrast, VRLA batteries retain generated gases within the battery as long as the pressure remains within safe levels. Under normal operating conditions the gases can then recombine within the battery itself, sometimes {{with the help of a}} catalyst, and no additional electrolyte is needed http://www.tms.org/pubs/journals/jom/0101/nelson-0101.html.

A comprehensive techno-economic analysis was performed for conversion of cellulosic feedstock to ethanol {{using some of the}} common pretreatment technologies: <b>dilute</b> <b>acid,</b> <b>dilute</b> alkali, hot water and steam explosion. Detailed process models incorporating feedstock handling, pretreatment, simultaneous saccharification and co-fermentation, ethanol recovery and downstream processing were developed using SuperPro Designer. Tall Fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb) was used as a model feedstock.
