5|$|Friedman {{was born}} in Brooklyn, New York on July 31, 1912. His parents, Sára Ethel (née Landau) and Jenő Saul Friedman, were Jewish {{immigrants}} from Beregszász in Carpathian Ruthenia, Kingdom of Hungary (now Berehove in Ukraine). They both worked as dry goods merchants. Shortly after Milton's birth, the family relocated to Rahway, New Jersey. In his early teens, Friedman was injured in a car accident, which scarred <b>his</b> <b>upper</b> <b>lip.</b> A talented student, Friedman graduated from Rahway High School in 1928, just before his 16th birthday.|$|E
5|$|In the 2009–10 season, Yi {{returned}} to the starting lineup for New Jersey. Starting in every game he played but one, Yi suffered several injuries during the season which made him miss 30 games. He sprained his medial collateral ligament on 4 November 2009, had a laceration on <b>his</b> <b>upper</b> <b>lip</b> on 8 December 2009, and sprained his left ankle on 8 March 2009. His final averages for the season were 12 points and 7.2 rebounds per game, {{as well as a}} 40% shooting percentage from the field and 37% on three-point field goals.|$|E
5|$|Rymkus's {{success in}} high school led to a {{scholarship}} to the University of Notre Dame, where he played from 1940 to 1942. He was known in college as a tough and durable tackle. In a 1941 game against Georgia Tech, Rymkus was elbowed in <b>his</b> <b>upper</b> <b>lip.</b> He left the game to get 14 stitches and returned {{to play in the}} 20–0 Notre Dame victory. Notre Dame went undefeated that season, coach Frank Leahy's first year at the school. During his junior year in 1942, Rymkus earned All-America honors, and in his final season at Notre Dame he was named the team's Most Valuable Player.|$|E
60|$|Mohammed Beyd {{drew back}} with a scowl. <b>His</b> thin, <b>upper</b> <b>lip</b> curled upward, {{revealing}} his smooth, white teeth.|$|R
60|$|Shepard {{was a short}} {{youth with}} thick yellow hair, and a comically serious quality in the twist of <b>his</b> long <b>upper</b> <b>lip.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'I was afraid,' {{said the}} Earl, presently, 'that {{you had not}} felt so well,' and he touched <b>his</b> own <b>upper</b> <b>lip</b> to {{indicate}} that the same feature in his son was covered with down like a young bird.|$|R
25|$|Many {{attribute}} his long-term {{dependence on}} opiates to {{his use of}} codeine as a painkiller during his convalescence. The trademark mustache he wore afterward was used to hide a scar on <b>his</b> <b>upper</b> <b>lip</b> resulting from the accident.|$|E
25|$|While batting in {{the second}} Test in the Australian 2006 tour of South Africa, Symonds was struck {{in the face of}} his helmet by a bouncer off Makhaya Ntini. Symonds {{required}} four stitches on the inside of <b>his</b> <b>upper</b> <b>lip.</b> Struggling for reliable impact, Symonds was again dropped {{at the end of this}} series.|$|E
25|$|Following a long setback {{of health}} {{problems}} and a serious lip injury in 1992 where he ruptured <b>his</b> <b>upper</b> <b>lip</b> and subsequently developed an infection, Hubbard was again playing and recording occasionally, even if not at the high level that he set for himself during his earlier career. His best records ranked with the finest in his field.|$|E
5000|$|<b>His</b> <b>upper</b> {{and lower}} <b>lips</b> are equal {{in size and}} have a rosy tint.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is rather}} scandalous in {{her to get}} the better of elder members," [...] said Mr. Gascoigne, with much inward {{satisfaction}} curling <b>his</b> short <b>upper</b> <b>lip.</b> [...] "But it is not my doing, my lord. I only meant her to make a tolerable figure, without surpassing any one." ...|$|R
6000|$|The enmity always {{smouldering}} {{between the}} two men, at this ill-judged interruption almost burst in flame. The stonemason turned upon his offspring, <b>his</b> long <b>upper</b> <b>lip</b> pulled down {{for all the world}} like a monkey's. He stared a while in virulent silence; and then [...] "Get Gregg!" [...] said he.|$|R
500|$|When Lois wipes off Stewie's fake pencil mustache, Stewie {{compares the}} saliva being cleaned on <b>his</b> <b>upper</b> <b>lip</b> {{to the time}} he had dinner with Martin Landau. [...] A cutaway shows Martin Landau having a {{distinct}} speech pattern by not chewing up his food as he speaks.|$|E
500|$|On June 19, 2014, {{professional}} kayaker Hunt Jennings {{descended the}} waterfall in a kayak {{when it was}} at record height due to several days of heavy rain. [...] The only injury sustained by Jennings was a small cut above <b>his</b> <b>upper</b> <b>lip.</b> [...] A spokesperson for the Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board commented, [...] "We are deeply concerned that this act and subsequent publicity will inspire others to attempt the same feat. [...] The impact of the drop, the large boulders {{at the base of}} the Falls, the deep water and fast current could easily injure or kill a kayaker." ...|$|E
2500|$|... {{localised}} swelling to {{the area}} of the left side of <b>his</b> <b>upper</b> <b>lip</b> ...|$|E
60|$|Lieutenant Santierra glared with indignation, but hesitated. His {{handsome}} oval face, {{as smooth}} as a girl's, flushed with the shame of his perplexity. Its nature humiliated his spirit. <b>His</b> hairless <b>upper</b> <b>lip</b> trembled; he seemed {{on the point of}} either bursting into a fit of rage or into tears of dismay.|$|R
60|$|The boy smiled; rather, <b>his</b> {{very short}} <b>upper</b> <b>lip</b> {{apparently}} vanished completely over his white teeth, and his very black eyes, which showed {{a great deal}} of the white around them, danced in their orbits.|$|R
5000|$|After this tragedy, {{some of the}} McCanles {{family moved}} to Florence, Colorado and changed the {{spelling}} of the name to McCandless. Hickok, making use of his new notoriety also changed his name after this incident. After growing a moustache to hide <b>his</b> protruding <b>upper</b> <b>lip,</b> he encouraged people to call him [...] "Wild Bill" [...] instead of [...] "Duck Bill".|$|R
2500|$|... two {{wounds to}} the left side of <b>his</b> <b>upper</b> <b>lip</b> which were not {{bleeding}} ...|$|E
2500|$|For {{the person}} with skin disease to be known to all by the things written about the person, [...] "his clothes shall be rent, and the hair of his head shall go loose, and he shall cover <b>his</b> <b>upper</b> <b>lip,</b> and shall cry: 'unclean, unclean.'" [...] So too, all other unclean persons must declare themselves.|$|E
2500|$|Born {{and raised}} in Handsworth, Birmingham, Iommi {{attended}} Birchfield Road School, where future bandmate Ozzy Osbourne was also a student one year behind him. At age 8 or 9, Iommi fell and badly cut <b>his</b> <b>upper</b> <b>lip</b> as another boy chased him. As a result, he gained the nickname [...] "Scarface" [...] which caused him to become self-conscious of the scar, and he eventually grew his trademark mustache {{as a means of}} covering it.|$|E
60|$|He drove away, {{leaving the}} {{youthful}} diplomatist {{standing with his}} bare feet in the dust. For {{a minute or two}} the young gentleman amused himself by a few light saltatory steps in the road. Then a smile of scornful superiority, mingled perhaps with a sense of previous slights and unappreciation, drew back <b>his</b> little <b>upper</b> <b>lip,</b> and brightened <b>his</b> mottled cheek.|$|R
60|$|The two mates {{released}} the shackles. The prisoner {{raised his eyes}} to Senor Perkins. He was a slightly built man of about thirty, fair-haired and hollow-cheeked. <b>His</b> short <b>upper</b> <b>lip</b> was lifted over his teeth, as if from hurried or labored breathing; but his features were regular and determined, and his large blue eyes shone with a strange abstraction of courage and fatuity.|$|R
60|$|He {{sank down}} in a seat, panting and gasping. The pallor of his face had increased. His lips were {{compressed}} and the sweat was standing out on <b>his</b> forehead and <b>upper</b> <b>lip.</b> He seemed in some horrible agony.|$|R
2500|$|Scriabin {{was small}} and {{reportedly}} frail throughout his life. In 1915, {{at the age of}} 43, he died in Moscow from septicemia {{as a result of a}} sore on <b>his</b> <b>upper</b> <b>lip.</b> [...] He had mentioned the sore as early as 1914 while in London. Immediately upon Scriabin's sudden death, Rachmaninoff toured Russia in a series of all-Scriabin recitals. It was the first time he had played music other than his own in public and his efforts helped secure Scriabin's reputation as a great composer.|$|E
2500|$|His post-service {{physical}} {{makes no}} mention of the lip scar, even though it mentions many smaller scars. When actress Louise Brooks met Bogart in 1924, he had some scar-tissue on <b>his</b> <b>upper</b> <b>lip,</b> which Brooks said that Bogart may have had partially repaired before entering films in 1930. She believed his scar {{had nothing to do with}} his distinctive speech pattern, and said his [...] "lip wound gave him no speech impediment, either before or after it was mended. Over the years, Bogart practiced all kinds of lip gymnastics, accompanied by nasal tones, snarls, lisps and slurs. His painful wince, his leer, his fiendish grin were the most accomplished ever seen on film." ...|$|E
2500|$|Liam's {{voice has}} been {{compared}} to a blend of John Lennon and John Lydon. He has stated he has no clear influence other than John Lennon and [...] "music" [...] itself, however, has been known to incorporate many different forms, such as punk, indie and new wave, and recently has explored elements of jazz with Beady Eye. In 2006, Q magazine voted Gallagher the 11th best singer of all time, citing songs such as [...] "Live Forever", [...] "Lyla", [...] "Don't Go Away", [...] "Slide Away" [...] and [...] "Champagne Supernova" [...] as examples of his best work. Gallagher also ensures that the microphone comes in the closest contact with him between <b>his</b> <b>upper</b> <b>lip</b> and nose, rather than {{directly in front of the}} mouth as is the case with most singers. On the Definitely Maybe DVD, Gallagher revealed that the reason he sings with his arms behind his back is because it allows him to project more power through his voice. In very early Oasis shows until about 1994, Gallagher can be seen touching the microphone with one hand, but still employing his usual singing posture with the rest of his body.|$|E
60|$|Tarzan {{looked at}} Numgo {{steadily}} for several minutes, his shapely head sank just a trifle between his great shoulders, his square chin shot forward and <b>his</b> short <b>upper</b> <b>lip</b> drew back, exposing his white teeth. Then, {{with a low}} growl he leaped upon the ape and buried his fangs in the other's hairy shoulder, clutching the great neck in his mighty fingers. Twice he shook the old ape, then he released his tooth-hold.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this case}} report is {{to point out to}} the {{possibility}} of oral human papilloma virus infection. This is the case history of a 34 year old man who visited a doctor, complaining of warts on his lips for the past two years. Careful inspection of his oral cavity showed papillomatous warty growths protruding from <b>his</b> <b>upper</b> inner <b>lip.</b> The warts on the lip were treated using electivcautery...|$|R
60|$|Sir Henry Lee, who had {{expected}} some effusion {{very different from}} those classical and beautiful lines, soon changed the scornful expression of his countenance, relaxed <b>his</b> contorted <b>upper</b> <b>lip,</b> and, stroking down his beard with his left hand, rested the forefinger of the right upon his eyebrow, in sign of profound attention. After Everard had ceased speaking, the old man signed as {{at the end of}} a strain of sweet music. He then spoke in a gentler manner than formerly.|$|R
60|$|Gonzaga's mouth jerked itself open, and <b>his</b> <b>upper</b> <b>lip</b> shuddered {{against his}} teeth.|$|E
60|$|Henri {{smiled and}} caressed <b>his</b> <b>upper</b> <b>lip,</b> where {{symptoms}} of a moustache were beginning to appear.|$|E
60|$|He {{turned his}} profile to me, making <b>his</b> <b>upper</b> <b>lip</b> very bulky with {{the upper part}} of his beard.|$|E
60|$|In a {{few moments}} he was {{sleeping}} the peaceful sleep of that youth {{which seemed to be}} his own dominant quality. Falkner stood for a little space and watched him, following the boyish lines of his cheek on the pillow, from the shadow of the light brown lashes under his closed lids to the lifting of <b>his</b> short <b>upper</b> <b>lip</b> over <b>his</b> white teeth, with his regular respiration. Only a sharp accenting of the line of nostril and jaw and a faint depression of the temple betrayed his already tried manhood.|$|R
5000|$|In 1993, Flanagan also {{appeared}} in the video for the Danzig song [...] "It's Coming Down". In the uncensored version of the video (near the ending), Flanagan pierces <b>his</b> <b>upper</b> and lower <b>lips</b> together and then he hammers a nail through {{the head of his}} penis before bleeding on the lens of the camera recording him.|$|R
5000|$|The Ren & Stimpy {{character}} Reverend Jack Cheese, {{who goes}} around preaching [...] "the gospel of meat," [...] {{is based on}} Powell. His knuckle tattoos say [...] "PITY" [...] and [...] "SELF PITY". In the episode [...] "It's a Dog's Life", meanwhile, Stimpy is shown to have the words [...] "Love" [...] and [...] "Hate" [...] tattooed on <b>his</b> <b>upper</b> and lower <b>lip.</b>|$|R
