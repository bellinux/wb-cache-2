500|$|Deutsche Gold- und Silber-Scheideanstalt (German Gold and Silver Refinery; Degussa) became sole {{owners of}} Degesch in 1922. There, {{beginning}} in 1922, , Bruno Tesch, and others worked on packaging hydrogen cyanide in sealed canisters {{along with a}} cautionary eye irritant and adsorbent stabilizers such as diatomaceous earth. The new product was also labelled as Zyklon, but it became known as Zyklon B to distinguish it from the earlier version. Heerdt was named the inventor of Zyklon B in the Degesch patent application (number DE 438818) dated 20 June 1922. The <b>German</b> <b>Patent</b> <b>Office</b> awarded the patent on 27 December 1926. Beginning in the 1920s, Zyklon B was used at U.S. Customs facilities along the Mexican border to disinfect the clothing of [...] border crossers.|$|E
500|$|According to Neubronner, {{there were}} a dozen {{different}} models of his camera. In 1907 he had sufficient success {{to apply for a}} patent. Initially his invention [...] "Method of and Means for Taking Photographs of Landscapes from Above" [...] was rejected by the <b>German</b> <b>patent</b> <b>office</b> as impossible, but after presentation of authenticated photographs the patent was granted in December 1908. (The rejection was based on a misconception about the carrying capacity of domestic pigeons.) The technology became widely known through Neubronner's participation in the 1909 International Photographic Exhibition in Dresden and the 1909 International Aviation Exhibition in Frankfurt. Spectators in Dresden could watch the arrival of the pigeons, and the aerial photographs they brought back were turned into postcards. Neubronner's photographs won prizes in Dresden {{as well as at the}} 1910 and 1911 Paris Air Shows.|$|E
