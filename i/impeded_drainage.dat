40|$|The {{cold climate}} and {{resulting}} low decomposition {{rates in the}} ground layers of boreal forests (such as those found in interior Alaska) result {{in the development of}} deep organic soils. In turn, these soils have an important role in many physical, chemical, and biological processes (Van Cleve et al. 1986). In combination with the slope, aspect, elevation, and composition of the underlying mineral soil profile of a specific site (Swanson 1996), organic soils are particularly influential in regulating ground temperature and moisture. As a general rule, the presence of a deep organic soil layer serves to insulate the forest floor during the growing season, causing colder temperatures than would otherwise occur. In many forested sites, autogenic cooling resulting from deepening organic soil layers eventually leads to the formation of permafrost, which, in turn, <b>impedes</b> <b>drainage</b> and substantially increases soil moisture (Van Cleve and Viereck 1981; Van Cleve et al. 1983 a, b) ...|$|R

50|$|Within California, vernal pools {{are quite}} {{commonly}} associated with Mima Mounds. These Mima Mounds are typically located on stable landforms that are greater than 100,000 years old. These landforms are characterized by strongly developed soils that usually have a relatively impermeable layer (claypan or silcrete duripan) in the subsoil. This impermeable layer locally <b>impedes</b> <b>drainage</b> and creates perched water levels and causes the formation of vernal pools within the intermound depressions {{that are associated with}} Mima Mounds. Vernal pools are typically small, shallow, and complex ephemeral wetlands that only have internal drainage because they are hydrologically isolated from perennial inflow by a ring of Mima Mounds. Although the ponded water that fills vernal pools comes and goes throughout the year, it is present at least for a short time in most years. However, within California, the mound-depression microrelief associated with Mima Mounds is just one of a variety of geographic settings within which vernal pools occur. For example, in the Modoc Plateau region of California, numerous vernal pools are found on the surface of volcanic mudflows and basalt lava flows where Mima Mounds are completely absent.|$|R
40|$|Rivers {{draining}} the semiarid Transhimalayan Ranges {{along the western}} Tibetan Plateau margin underwent alternating phases of massive valley infill and incision in Pleistocene times. The imprints of these cut-and-fill cycles on long-term sediment fluxes have remained largely elusive. We investigate the timing and geomorphic consequences of headward incision of the Zanskar River, which taps the vast More Plains valley fill that currently <b>impedes</b> <b>drainage</b> of the endorheic high-altitude basins of Tso Kar and Tso Moriri. In situ 10 Be exposure dating and topographic analyses indicate that a phase of valley infill gave way to net dissection of the > 250 -m thick sedimentary stacks ∼ 125 ka ago, i. e. during the last interglacial (MIS 5 e). Rivers eroded > 14. 7 km 3 of sediment from the Zanskar headwaters since then, fashioning specific sediment yields that surpass 10 Be-derived denudation rates from neighbouring catchments by factors of two to ten. We conclude that recycling of Pleistocene valley fills has provided Transhimalayan headwater rivers with more sediment than bedrock denudation, {{at least since the}} beginning of the last glacial cycle. This protracted liberation of sediment stored in thick valley fills could bias rate estimates of current sediment loads and long-term bedrock denudation...|$|R

50|$|Six soil {{condition}} types {{have been identified}} by the National Soils Map, the most widespread being slowly permeable, seasonally wet, slightly acid but base-rich, loamy and clayey soils which have moderate natural fertility and <b>impeded</b> <b>drainage.</b> Where groundwater levels are high, a wet low fertility variant of the first type occurs. Very acid, free-draining soils with very low natural fertility occur over the Lower Greensand. Freely draining, slightly acid loamy soils are found along the Rother valley where they are used for intensive arable farming and vegetable growing. Freely draining, slightly acid sandy soils are found at Cowdray Park and around Hambledon. Wet loamy and clayey floodplain soils of moderate natural fertility are found along the River Arun, where they provide summer grazing for cattle.|$|E
40|$|Glaucoma is a multifactorial {{condition}} caused, in part, by fibrosis of the sieve-like trabecular meshwork (TM) tissue, which <b>impedes</b> <b>drainage</b> of {{aqueous humor}} (AH), leading to increased intraocular pressure and associated optic nerve damage and blindness. Fibrosis of the TM is {{mainly caused by}} the increased levels of active transforming growth factor-β 2 (TGFβ 2) in the AH of glaucoma patients. Previous reports have shown that TGFβ decreases the expression of Phosphatase and Tensin Homolog (PTEN) gene and that PTEN is a major regulator of ECM deposition. In this study we investigate the regulation of PTEN protein expression and activity by TGFβ 2 in TM cells to determine the mechanism by which excess ECM is deposited. Here we show that TGFβ 2 induces collagen deposition in TM cells by phosphorylation of PTEN, a mechanism that is known to inactivate PTEN. Phosphorylation of PTEN by TGFβ is novel {{and has not been}} previously reported. We have found that PTEN protein expression and phosphorylation is regulated by the PI 3 kinase pathway. We further show that transfection of TM cells to express enhanced-active PTEN decreases TGFβ 2 -induced deposition of collagen type I (COL 1) protein. Thus, regulation of PTEN activity could serve as a therapeutic target with high potential to prevent excess ECM deposition in the TM of glaucoma patients...|$|R

The pygmy shrew survives by eating the insects and spiders that live in the heather. Lapwing, curlew and redshank breed on the moors and there are sandpipers along the streams. Wheatear and golden plovers inhabit grassier patches on the moors and ring ouzels live in stony areas. Red grouse, which feed on young heather shoots, are abundant. The heather is burned in strips by gamekeepers and farmers to encourage new heather growth to feed the grouse. Grouse shooting is part of the moorland economy.About 20 per cent of the national park is covered in bracken. Few things can grow under its dense cover and it does not support many insects and is unpalatable to most animals. The bracken is extremely invasive.|$|R
