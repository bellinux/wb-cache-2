5|$|The {{original}} {{context of}} the song, in the film Robin and the 7 Hoods, is the mob boss Robbo (Sinatra) having just been acquitted of murdering the sheriff, a crime {{for which he had}} been framed. <b>He</b> <b>walks</b> <b>out</b> of the courthouse and joyously sings the song in gratitude to the gathered crowd of Chicagoans. The people eventually join in the singing. Instrumental versions of the song make up the opening and closing credits, and a dance band also plays the song in Robbo's speakeasy.|$|E
25|$|On 7 February 2016 {{the first}} part of a {{television}} series called 'Molly' aired on Australian television. It featured flashbacks of Molly's life and some actual footage of videos seen on Countdown. Molly was played by Samuel Johnson. The unaired footage from his interview with Prince Charles showed Johnson as Molly but actual footage of Prince Charles himself. Part two of the miniseries aired on 14 February 2016. The final scene was a very moving salute to Molly as he returns to public life after a lengthy hospital stay. Actual footage of Molly himself receiving a standing ovation as <b>he</b> <b>walks</b> <b>out</b> {{with the aid of a}} walking stick ends the series.|$|E
25|$|In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Fleur and Bill {{take part}} in the {{operation}} to escort Harry safely to the Burrow, and they witness Mad-Eye Moody being killed by Voldemort. The couple have their wedding and reception at the Burrow, but the event is interrupted when Death Eaters attack {{after the fall of the}} Ministry of Magic. Fleur and Bill allow Ron to stay with them after <b>he</b> <b>walks</b> <b>out</b> on Harry and Hermione during their hunt for horcruxes. The newlyweds later provide safe haven for the trio and others rescued from Malfoy Manor at Shell Cottage, their home.

25|$|In Rome, Mark {{attempts}} to read Rose's letter during class. He is {{distracted by the}} intense gaze of a beautiful student (Ania Pieroni), who leaves suddenly; Mark follows, leaving the letter behind. His friend Sara (Eleonora Giorgi) picks up the letter, and later reads it. Horrified by the letter's contents, she takes a taxi to a library and finds a copy of The Three Mothers. Sara is attacked by a monstrous figure who recognizes the book. She throws the book {{to the ground and}} escapes. Returning to her home, she phones Mark telling him to come and asks a neighbour, Carlo (Gabriele Lavia), to keep her company. The lights suddenly go out and both Sara and Carlo are stabbed to death by a gloved killer. Mark discovers the bodies and two torn fragments from Rose's letter. After the police arrive, <b>he</b> <b>walks</b> <b>out</b> of Sara's apartment and sees a taxi slowly driving by. In {{the back seat of the}} vehicle is the music student, staring at him intently again.|$|E
25|$|Malick is {{introduced}} {{on the verge}} of being fired from Holby City Hospital, after assaulting his boss on the Day Care Surgical ward. He explains to Director of Surgery Henrik Hanssen (Guy Henry) that it was necessary to save a patient: resuscitation had been abandoned, but after forcefully taking control of the situation, Malick was able to revive them. On the proviso that he attends anger management counselling, Hanssen gives Malick a final chance and attaches him to the Acute Assessment Unit (AAU). There, he soon clashes with the unit's staff: consultant Michael Spence (Hari Dhillon), Foundation doctor Penny Valentine (Emma Catherwood), and ward sister Frieda Petrenko (Olga Fedori). Relations begin to improve when Malick is left in charge of the unit for the day. Although he initially dismisses Penny's diagnoses and advice, ultimately he is forced to call on Michael for help and realises that she was right all along. He also becomes Frieda's mentor when she is accepted onto the Foundation programme. A racist patient makes a complaint about Malick; when her condition rapidly deteriorates in theatre, <b>he</b> <b>walks</b> <b>out,</b> causing the junior AAU staff to believe he has abandoned them. Malick soon returns with a crash team and saves the patient's life. Penny develops a crush on him, but Frieda informs her he is gay.|$|E
500|$|Several of CP+B's {{advertising}} {{programs for}} Burger King, including ones for the Whopper, drew criticism from groups for perceived cultural insensitivity or misogynistic themes within them. In May 2006, in an American {{promotion of the}} Texas Double Whopper, Burger King released a campaign called the [...] "Manthem" [...] which parodies Helen Reddy's [...] "I Am Woman". It depicts {{a man and his}} girlfriend at a fancy restaurant. Disappointed by the meager portions he is served, the man bursts into song, expressing his desire for a Texas Double Whopper, in place of what he deems [...] "chick food." [...] As <b>he</b> <b>walks</b> <b>out</b> of the restaurant, he is joined by a chorus of men who rebel by not only eating Texas Double Whoppers, but also go commando, lift a minivan over the side of an overpass, and unfurl a banner which says [...] "Eat This Meat." [...] This has been the source of some controversy, as the commercial has been described as demeaning to male vegetarians/vegans, as well as misogynistic.|$|E

500|$|Sam then meets Rebecca Howe, {{who is the}} {{new manager}} of Cheers and almost {{immediately}} turned off by him based on the rumors of Sam's [...] "sexual prowess". Rebecca uses Sam's former office as her own and, {{although it has been}} completely renovated, Sam is able to use Carla's tricks to overhear Rebecca talking to her boss Evan Drake, on whom she has a crush. Evan knows Sam as a baseball player and wants to hire him to be a bartender. Sam is then hired, but one of the two current bartenders must be sacked to make room for him. The bar regulars want Wayne to go, but Rebecca wants to fire Woody. A competition then ensues to see if Wayne actually knows how to make every drink known. If Wayne loses the bet, he agrees to leave, but if he wins the bet, then he gets Sam's now-damaged sailboat. The gang plays a prank to cause Wayne to lose over the then-fictional cocktail [...] "Screaming Viking" [...] and <b>he</b> <b>walks</b> <b>out,</b> though Rebecca is wise to their game, gives Sam his severance check and tells Sam to leave. Sam then promises nothing of the sort will occur again and is provisionally re-hired on the understanding that this is his last chance as Rebecca uses a seductive baseball metaphor-pun about having two outs, two strikes and [...] "no balls".|$|E

6000|$|... 1. The {{first great}} {{difficulty}} which the teacher feels, {{is a sort}} of moral responsibility for the conduct of others. If his pupils do wrong, he feels almost personal responsibility for it. As <b>he</b> <b>walks</b> <b>out,</b> some afternoon, weary with his labors, and endeavoring to forget, for a little time, all his cares, he comes upon a group of boys, in rude and noisy quarrels, or engaged in mischief of some sort, and his heart sinks within him. It is hard enough for any one to witness their bad conduct, with a spirit unruffled and undisturbed, but for their teacher, it is perhaps impossible. He feels responsible; in fact he is responsible. If his scholars are disorderly, or negligent, or idle, or quarrelsome, he feels condemned himself, almost as if he were, himself, the actual transgressor.|$|E
6000|$|The House of Fame {{cannot be}} ranked with Chaucer's best productions. The {{incidents}} {{are supposed to}} pass in a dream, which was his ordinary plan for avoiding the infringement of probability when he exchanged terrestrial realities for the visions of fancy. He repeatedly in his works does homage to the happy influence of love. He maintained {{that it was the}} parent of the choicest qualities among mankind, though he sometimes adulterates his loftier sentiments by intermingling voluptuous passion with the pure affections of the heart,--a defect which was usual with the mediæval [...] "gestours." [...] He reverts in the House of Fame to his favourite theme, and the first book is taken up with a description of the temple of Venus. The entire edifice was of glass that was radiant with paintings representing subjects from Ovid and Virgil. Chaucer flourished in the finest period of Gothic architecture, when the [...] "storied windows richly dight" [...] were the delight of the age, and his detailed enumeration of the pictured incidents were not, to his contemporaries, the dry catalogue they may appear to us. After examining the marvellous gallery, <b>he</b> <b>walks</b> <b>out</b> of the building to seek for some one to inform him in what country he may be. He finds that the surrounding district is a desert {{as far as the eye}} can reach, without house, tree, herbage, or living creature, till gazing upwards he beholds an eagle aloft in the sky.|$|E
