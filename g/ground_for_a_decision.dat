I would tell them of my own intention to keep my counsel and reserve my own freedom, until I see the moment and the occasion when there may be a prospect of public benefit in endeavouring to make a movement forward, and I will venture to recommend them, as an old parliamentary hand, to do the same.”(178) Something in this turn of phrase kindled lively irritation, and it drew bitter reproaches from more than one of the younger whigs. The angriest of these remonstrances was listened to from beginning to end without a solitary cheer from the liberal benches. The great bulk of the party took their leader’s advice. Of course the reserve of his speech was as significant of Irish concession, as the most open declaration would have been. Yet there was no rebellion. This was felt by ministers to be a decisive omen of the general support likely to be given to Mr. Gladstone’s supposed policy by his own party. Mr. Parnell offered some complimentary remarks on the language of Mr. Gladstone, but he made no move in the direction of an amendment. The public outside looked on with stupefaction. For two or three days all seemed to be in suspense. But the two ministerial leaders in the Commons knew how to read the signs. What Sir Michael (M105) Hicks Beach and Lord Randolph foresaw, for one thing was an understanding between Mr. Gladstone and the Irishmen, and for another, they foresaw the acquiescence of the mass of the liberals. This twofold discovery cleared the <b>ground</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision.</b> After the second night’s debate ministers saw that the only chance now was to propose coercion. Then it was that the ephemeral chief secretary had started on his voyage for the discovery of something that had already been found.|$|E

He told the lawyers that the promoters, the boxers, and their seconds had all broken the law and could be arrested. The bank refused to release all of the funds to Sharkey, withholding 15% due to an injunction. He collected $8,500 of the $10,000 prize money (approximately $ today) but he was not widely accepted as the heavyweight title holder.|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} we propose a logical {{approach}} to planning, {{based on the}} view of a planning activity as the search <b>for</b> <b>a</b> finite model of the specification of the planning problem. Planning problems are represented in a modal temporal language, based on a discrete, linear model of time, whose execution mechanism exploits model construction techniques related to analytic tableaux. The tableau system {{is based on the}} use of prefixes that, intuitively, label each formula as being true in a particular state. This approach allows the exploitation of methods and results from search-based approaches, such as plan-space search, regression and least commitment. A partial ordering of time points is in fact allowed in the calculus, by means of a set of temporal constraints that is built up step by step as the construction of a tableau branch proceeds. A form of soundness and completeness with respect to finite model construction are established, constituting the <b>grounds</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> procedure that is parametric w. r. t. the maximal time length a plan is allowed to reach...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In the {{exchange}} paradox, two players receive envelopes containing different amounts of money. The assignment of the amounts ensures each player {{has the same}} probability of receiving each possible amount. Nonetheless, for each specific amount a player may find in his envelope, {{there is a positive}} expectation of gain if the player swaps envelopes with the other player, in apparent contradiction with the symmetry of the game. I consider a variant form of the paradox that avoids problems with improper probabilities and I argue that in it these expectations give no <b>grounds</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> to swap since that decision must be based on a summation of all the expectations. But this sum yields a non-convergent series that has no meaningful value. The conflicting recommendations – that it is to one or the other player’s advantage to swap – arise from different ways of grouping terms in the sum that yield an illusion of convergence. I describe a generalized exchange paradox, explore some of its properties and display another example. 1...|$|R
50|$|Initially, {{the role}} of a Parliamentary Ombudsman could be characterised as that of a prosecutor. Cases set in motion by the Ombudsman were either shelved with no action being taken or {{resulted}} in prosecution. Eventually, however, routines evolved which meant that prosecution was waived for minor transgressions and an admonition was issued instead. This development was acknowledged by the Riksdag in 1915 by its inclusion of a specific right to waive prosecution in the instructions for the Parliamentary Ombudsman. Until the adoption of the 1975 instructions, these provisions on an Ombudsman's right to waive prosecution in cases involving transgressions that were not of major consequence provided the only formal basis for the expression of criticism. In the cases where an official could not be charged with any punishable error and therefore there were no <b>grounds</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> to waive prosecution, the expression of criticism or advice {{on the part of the}} Ombudsman was based only the usages that had evolved over the years. These practices were appraised and approved by the Riksdag in 1964.|$|R

40|$|This article {{contributes}} to {{the solution of the}} relevant problem of the seaport infrastructure development for the purpose of increasing the cargo turnover in the regions of seaport location as well as {{to improve the quality of}} freight traffic on the basis of the creation of container hinterlands — dry ports. The options of dry ports as the potentially effective solution to increase the cargo turnover of existing seaports, improve the timeliness of freight transportation and overcome the environmental problems of the regions of seaport location are shown. This work analyzes the transport infrastructure of the region, the cargo turnover of major Russian sea and dry ports as well as the experience of creating dry ports in the Russian Federation and abroad. The authors propose the system of parameters for dry ports, which are recommended for the assessment of seaport infrastructure development scenarios on the stage of strategic planning. The authors have developed the approach of optimal values determination of the main parameters of dry ports by simulation modeling method. The features of construction and research of the simulation models of system “seaport — dry port” in programming software AnyLogic are considered. The results of modeling experiments with a developed simulation model are provided. This model is aimed to assess the maximum estimated capacity of the existing seaport in the conditions of the increasing irregularity of cargo traffic, and also to determine the optimum parameters of the constructed «dry port». The obtained dependencies as a result of modeling experiments prove the adequacy of the selected main parameters of dry ports for the effective evaluation of the scenarios of the strengthening of carrying and estimated capacity of existing seaports on the stage of strategic planning. The article shows that the methodology of this research can be used by the investors and public authorities as <b>grounds</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> on <b>a</b> balanced development of transport and logistics infrastructure in the regions of seaports...|$|R
40|$|The smorgasbord ploy {{probably}} plays {{only a minor}} role in {{the admission}} of other crimes evidence. But it offers us a nice window into the uses and abuses of Rule 404 (b) of the Federal Rules of Evidence (“the Rules”) and its state clones. Rule 404 (b) ’s drafters may have supposed that trial judges would look among the illustrative uses in Rule 404 (b) and select {{the one or two}} that seem most apropos to the case before them. However, the practitioners of smorgasbordism do not make any choices but instead list all (or most) of the illustrative uses to support the admission of the other crimes. We can surmise the judge calculates that this will avoid appellate reversal by giving appellate judges more <b>grounds</b> <b>for</b> affirming <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> to admit other crimes evidence. Moreover, it saves work; the judge need not put in as much effort to use the ploy as she would have to in deciding which of the adversaries has analyzed admissibility correctly...|$|R

40|$|This study {{treats the}} {{problems}} that the social worker (the child welfare worker) is faced with, when deciding to take a child into compulsory care. Empirical data (with particulars {{of the children and}} parents involved) covering the public child care at a local authority, was collected from its records and by means of interviews. Data concerning the social workers was obtained through observation, interviews and questionnaires. Out of 166 new child care clients during one year, 77 %were teenagers, and nine out of ten children taken into care were adolescents. Taking up a position in child care cases and making decisions about courses of action were mostly difficult or even painful for the social worker. The <b>decision</b> to take <b>a</b> child into care was considered the hardest task in social work. The social worker's dilemma is created by the requirements of the law that any <b>decision</b> to take <b>a</b> child into care should be based on satisfactory predictions of the consequences for the child. The social worker's agony arises out of her attempts to motivate such predictions when in fact she is convinced, through experience,that very few, if any, of the consequences can be safely established. Empirical data showed that motivations of the decisions given in the investigation for the court were often vague and implicit. This may be explained by referring to the emotionally experienced conflict between prediction and subsumption. In other empirical data social workers described their anxiety when handling cases where children are taken into care. This may be analysed as 'the agony of decision-making', caused by their choice between alternative courses of action, and 'the agony of separation' brought about by the social worker's identification either with the child or with its parents. The proposed model for decision-making aims to reduce the social worker's agony, by shifting some of her burden of responsibility over to the society. This is achieved by letting the <b>grounds</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> to take <b>a</b> child into care rest explicitly on the principia of subsumption. The social worker's task is thereby limited to assessments of the child's present situation. Three criteria of assessment, child abuse, sexual abuse and 'Good-Enough Parenting' are suggested. The study points out the importance of specifying what is counted as 'Good-Enough Parenting'. digitalisering@um...|$|R
25|$|Although {{technically}} {{an appeal}} {{is required for}} the umpire to make <b>a</b> <b>decision,</b> in practice it is often obvious to all that a batsman is out, and the batsman may walk off the field without waiting for the decision of the umpire. This is invariably the case when a batsman is out bowled or to an obvious catch. However, the batsman is always entitled to stand his <b>ground</b> and wait <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> from the umpire. In cases where he considers he might not be out, such as a catch taken low near the grass or where {{it is not clear whether}} the ball hit the bat, batsmen will not take the walking option. It is then up to the fielding team to appeal <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision.</b> Sometimes <b>a</b> batsman will walk even when it is not clear to others that he is out, if in his own mind he is certain he was out; this is considered to be the epitome of sportsmanlike behaviour.|$|R
40|$|As a {{topic of}} my thesis I chose one of the {{fundamental}} topics of the civil procedure, because in the evidence in civil proceedings the court gets the <b>grounds</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> fair <b>decision</b> in the matter. Although it may seem classical, the topic is still very important because of modern trends and frequent amendments of the Civil Procedure Code. The issues related to evidence procedure are not only interesting, but also essential for practice, because the final judgment relies upon various pleadings of the parties and activity of the court. Due to its extent and significance, the topic cannot be fully covered by one thesis, and thus during elaboration of the thesis I divided it in two sections. The first section examines the general problems connected with evidence in civil proceedings and the second section deals with selected issues of evidence in civil proceedings, respective burdens and phases of the evidence procedure. In the first section I tried to define the term evidence and the subject of the evidence by finding what does and what does not belong therein. This section also addresses identical statements of the parties. Further I focused on institutes that facilitate the evidence in civil proceedings. Among these I examined legal fictions which allow to bring in <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> even where some statements [...] ...|$|R
