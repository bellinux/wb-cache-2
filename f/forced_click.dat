Unscrupulous affiliates have used spam, false advertising, <b>forced</b> <b>clicks</b> (to get tracking cookies set on users' computers), adware, and other methods to drive traffic to their sponsors. Although many affiliate programs have terms of service that contain rules against spam, this marketing method has historically proven to attract abuse from spammers.|$|R

40|$|We {{introduce}} a haptic mousewheel {{as a platform}} for design exploration of haptic conviction widgets. Conviction is how strongly one wants to do something, or how strongly one desires a parameter to be as it is. Using the haptic mousewheel, the widgets allow users to communicate conviction using force, where greater conviction requires greater force. These widgets include buttons that take varying amounts of <b>force</b> to <b>click,</b> a trash can that requires overcoming force to delete files, an instant message client that requires more force to communicate a stronger emotion, and widgets that allow parameters to be locked using force...|$|R
5000|$|The court {{concluded}} that subscribers who click [...] "yes" [...] to the Terms of Use Agreement indicate assent via E-sign.However, the court gave {{no comment on}} whether such assent would constitute a valid agreement in this appeal to preliminary injunction; therefore, the validity MRIS's copyright transfer might need to further be solved in its merit claims. Whether the accepting in a Clickwrap Agreement should be interpreted that the user consented to transfer his own right is still a controversial issue. In a practical way, it might have to consider if the user is <b>forced</b> to <b>click</b> yes to the Clickwrap Agreement. If so, it might be clearer if the website would use both the clicking to the Term of Use and the signing to assent to transfer the user's right to the website. It should {{be interesting to see}} how other courts would decide this same issue.|$|R
40|$|Time-domain {{numerical}} solutions of a nonlinear active cochlear model <b>forced</b> by <b>click</b> stimuli {{are analyzed}} with a time-frequency wavelet technique {{to identify the}} components of the otoacoustic response associated with different generation mechanisms/places. Previous experimental studies have shown evidence for the presence of at least two components in the transient otoacoustic response: A long-latency response, growing compressively with increasing stimulus level, and a shorter-latency response, characterized by faster growth. The possible mechanisms for the generation of the two components are discussed using the results of the numerical simulations. The model is a one-dimensional (1 -D) transmission line model with nonlinear and nonlocal active terms representing the anti-damping action of the “cochlear amplifier. ” The dependence on the stimulus level of latency and level was measured for the different components of the response. The generation mechanisms/places of the different components were identified by varying the stimulus level and by turning off the cochlear roughness in well-defined cochlear regions. The results suggest that reflections from roughness coming from basal regions of the cochlea may give a relevant contribution to the early otoacoustic response, whereas nonlinear mechanisms seem to produce a much smaller additional contribution...|$|R
40|$|Gemstone Team MICE (Modifying and Improving Computer Ergonomics) Work-related Musculoskeletal Disorders (WMSDs) are {{conditions}} that develop over time due to repetitive motion and can painfully affect the fingers, wrist, arm, shoulder, back, and neck. Studies indicate {{a correlation between}} heavy computer mouse use and the prevalence of WMSDs. Our team evaluated current ergonomic mouse designs to determine which features of mice reduce excessive muscle activation and harmful arm and hand positioning while still maintaining ease of use and marketability. A motion capture system tracked arm and hand positioning, EMG analysis measured muscle activation, force sensors quantified the user‘s <b>clicking</b> <b>force,</b> and a Fitts‘ test evaluated mouse use efficiency. To determine the marketability of mice features, surveys generalized user preferences, while focus groups closely examined specific market factors. All these systems were combined to identify areas of improvement in ergonomic mouse design...|$|R

Apple Computer {{was one of the}} first companies to ship an optical mouse as the standard input device. While the industrial design of the Pro Mouse was handled entirely by Apple's in-house designers, some of the hardware has been engineered by Sparkfactor Design. The Pro Mouse was included with the Power Mac G4 Cube, also introduced at that year's Macworld. Apple was the first company to use USB mice and keyboards exclusively when they introduced the [...] "hockey-puck" [...] mouse with the original iMac G3 in May 1998. Like the [...] "hockey-puck" [...] mouse and all future mice Apple would make, the Apple Pro Mouse was a USB mouse with a much shorter cord than its ADB predecessors, its 2-foot cord was designed to plug neatly into one of the two ports of the Apple Pro Keyboard's built-in USB hub. The Apple Pro Mouse also featured a unique mechanism to allow for 3 <b>click</b> <b>force</b> settings for the required pressure to click the mouse.
