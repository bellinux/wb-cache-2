5|$|A survey {{conducted}} in 2006 identified 216 {{species of birds}} known to have occurred in Petrified Forest National Park since the park became a protected area in 1906. Of those, 33 species breed within the park, 6 other species probably do, and 18 species live in the park year-round. Thirty-five species live in the park only <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>summer</b> <b>and</b> 11 species only during the winter.

5|$|Hamelin's {{forces were}} {{immediately}} effective: Caroline attacked a westbound convoy of East Indiamen in the Action of 31 May 1809 in the Bay of Bengal and captured two, the Streatham and Europe.

5|$|Hurricanes are an ever-present threat <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>summer</b> <b>and</b> fall season, {{which puts}} Galveston in Coastal Windstorm Area. Galveston Island and the Bolivar Peninsula are {{generally}} at {{the greatest risk}} among the communities near the Galveston Bay. However, though the island and peninsula provide some shielding, the bay shoreline still faces significant danger from storm surge.|$|E

5|$|Management of {{the site}} {{requires}} moderate grazing <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>summer</b> <b>and</b> autumn to help maintain the species diversity. This is because grazing removes each year's new growth which helps stop the site becoming dominated by vigorously growing grasses. Such grasses would allow a buildup of dead organic matter, which together with the increased growth, would reduce the growth of less vigorous species. The overall effect would be a reduction in species diversity, {{which was one of}} the reasons for the SSSI designation. Trampling can be of benefit because it breaks up accumulated dead organic matter.|$|E
5|$|ORNL resumed {{californium}} {{production in}} spring 2008. Hamilton noted the restart <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>summer</b> <b>and</b> {{made a deal}} on subsequent extraction of berkelium. During a September 2008 symposium at Vanderbilt (in Nashville, Tennessee, U.S.) celebrating his 50th year on the Physics faculty, he introduced Oganessian to James Roberto (then the deputy director for science and technology at ORNL). They established a collaboration among JINR, ORNL, and Vanderbilt; the team at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) in Livermore, California, U.S., was soon invited to join.|$|E
5|$|Population size {{is usually}} largest <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>summer</b> <b>and</b> declines during winter, {{although}} populations in Texas and Louisiana {{may be more}} seasonally stable. Animals also often lose weight during winter. Population size varies dramatically {{from year to year}} in southern Texas. In coastal Mississippi, storms probably do not cause the population to decline substantially, and in Texas, inundation of its habitat did not significantly influence population density. However, in Mississippi, flooding did cause a marked decline in rice rat abundance.|$|E

5|$|The 1911 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season was relatively inactive, with only six known tropical cyclones forming in the Atlantic <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>summer</b> <b>and</b> fall. There were three suspected tropical depressions, {{including one that}} began the season in February and one that ended the season when it dissipated in December. Three storms intensified into hurricanes, two of which attained Category 2 status on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. Storm data is largely based on the Atlantic hurricane database, which underwent a thorough revision for the period between 1911 and 1914 in 2005.|$|E
5|$|The Westerlies or the Prevailing Westerlies are the {{prevailing}} winds {{in the middle}} latitudes between 35 and 65degrees latitude. These prevailing winds blow from the west to the east, and steer extratropical cyclones in this general manner. The winds are predominantly from the southwest in the Northern Hemisphere and from the northwest in the Southern Hemisphere. They are strongest in the winter when the pressure is lower over the poles, and weakest <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>summer</b> <b>and</b> when pressures are higher over the poles.|$|E

Long lines are common during the peak spring-skiing season of April and May. Wildcat Mountain offers groomed ski trails and lifts, and is a better choice for less-experienced skiers.

5|$|The fungus is saprobic, and so derives {{nutrients}} from breaking down dead plant material, such as leaves, bark, needles, and twigs, that {{has fallen to}} the ground. Fruit bodies are usually found growing in groups or scattered on leaf litter in beech and beech-hemlock forests <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>summer</b> <b>and</b> autumn, {{although it has been}} recorded growing on lawns. It is also often found under eastern North American oaks. The distribution includes the US states Connecticut, New York, Ohio, Michigan, and Vermont. It has also been collected in Quebec, Canada.|$|E
