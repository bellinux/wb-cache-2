40|$|Expenditure {{on social}} {{protection}} in the European Union (EU) member states has been increasing rapidly over the last decade. To cover the increasing expenses, the countries need {{to find ways to}} increase revenues. Social protection financing systems and structure of financing vary across countries, but all of them use mainly two sources for financing: <b>general</b> <b>government</b> <b>contributions</b> and social tax revenue. The aim {{of this paper is to}} study the development of the structure of social protection financing at the main contributor level over the last decade, defining the trends that characterize the changes. We concentrate on convergence analysis of the structure of social protection financing, which is an important but, so far, insufficiently studied issue.

Shocks to <b>general</b> <b>government</b> and inflation will cause <b>general</b> <b>government</b> debt to increase.

In Greece, the relationship between <b>general</b> <b>government</b> debts with primary balance is found to be positive and significant while negative and significant with net transfer from abroad.
