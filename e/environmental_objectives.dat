40|$|Along {{with the}} {{continuing}} global warming, the environmental constraints {{are expected to}} play more and more {{important role in the}} operation of distributed energy resource (DER) systems, besides the economic objective. In this study, a multi-objective optimization model is developed to analyze the optimal operating strategy of a DER system while combining the minimization of energy cost with the minimization of environmental impact which is assessed in terms of CO 2 emissions. The trade-off curve is obtained by using the compromise programming method. As an illustrative example, the DER system installed in an eco-campus in Japan has been selected for case study. The distributed technologies under consideration include photovoltaics (PV), fuel cell and gas engine for providing electrical and thermal demands. The obtained results demonstrate that increasing the satisfaction degree of economic objective leads to increased CO 2 emissions. The operation of the DER system is more sensitive when <b>environmental</b> <b>objective</b> is paid more attention. Moreover, according to the sensitivity analysis, the consideration of electricity buy-back, carbon tax, as well as fuel switching to biogas, has more or less effect on the operation of DER systems.

Recycling nutrients is also a way to contribute towards sustainability. Today the agriculture has {{a net loss of}} nutrients that is compensated with mineral fertilizers. This net loss of nutrients can be compensated with nutrients from faeces and urine instead. Sweden has a national <b>environmental</b> <b>objective</b> stating that "at least 60 % of phosphorus compounds present in wastewater should be recovered for use on productive land by 2015 and at least half of this amount should be returned to arable land". Source separated wastewater systems contribute to fulfil the Swedish <b>environmental</b> <b>objective</b> by collecting the nutrients in faeces and urine. These nutrients can be used as fertilizers after appropriate treatment. There is a potential hazard with pathogens, pharmaceuticals and heavy metals contained in these fertilizers. However the concentration of heavy metals and pharmaceuticals is lower in urine and faeces than in animal manure. If appropriate treatment for sanitising is used, the risk for pathogens is reduced.

40|$|The Federal State of Saxony (Germany) {{transposed}} the EU Water Framework Directive into state law, identifying 617 {{surface water}} bodies (rivers and streams) for {{implementation of the}} water framework directive (WFD). Their ecological status was classified by biological quality elements (macrophytes and phytobenthos, benthic invertebrates and fish, and in large rivers, phytoplankton) and specific synthetic and non-synthetic pollutants. Hydromorphological and physico-chemical quality elements were used to identify significant anthropogenic pressures, which surface water bodies are susceptible to, and to assess {{the effect of these}} pressures on the status of surface water bodies. In 2009, the data for classification of the ecological status and the main pressures and impacts on water bodies were published in the river basin management plans (RBMP) of the Elbe and Oder rivers. To that date, only 23 (4 %) streams achieved an ecological status of “good”, while the rest failed to achieve the <b>environmental</b> <b>objective.</b> The two main reasons for the failure were significant alterations to the stream morphology (81 % of all streams) and nutrient enrichment (62 %) caused by point (industrial and municipal waste water treatment plants) and non-point (surface run-off from arable fields, discharges from urban drainages and decentralized waste water treatment plants) sources.

40|$|In Tunisia, the {{extension}} of irrigated area is justified by its {{important role in the}} development and diversification of agricultural production. Nevertheless, the strong intensification of the agricultural activities may lead to the pollution of underground water resources due to an excess use of fertilisers and other chemical products. In fact, the high nitrate concentrations observed in some Tunisian irrigated areas, are related to the excessive use of nitrate fertilizers in intensive agriculture. The objective of the present study is to implement decision-making methods allowing a better combination of factors production by optimization of an economic <b>objective</b> and an <b>environmental</b> <b>objective.</b> This research is based on multi-criteria modelling through the optimization of two conflict objectives: an economic objective as settled by farmer in the short or medium-run (Gross margin), and an <b>environmental</b> <b>objective</b> (nitrate pollution reduction) as a long-run objective of the decision maker in order to ensure the continuity of agriculture activities and ecosystems sustainability. Data were collected through a survey conducted in the irrigated area of Kalaât El Andalous in Tunisia with a sample containing 57 farms. Efficient solutions were obtained and compared through the "constraints", "NISE" and "compromises" methods. Main results obtained indicate a significant degree of conflict between these two objectives. Indeed the maximization of the total gross margin involves an increase in the degrees of nitrate pollution and conversely. Finally, some policy implications are presented.

40|$|In {{some cases}} natural {{background}} concentration of heavy metals exceeds levels named in present <b>environmental</b> quality <b>objectives,</b> and thus poses {{a risk to}} the ecosystem of interest.

The method is based on a distinction that can be made between a bioavailable and a non-available fraction of the background concentration. The bioavailable fraction will result in a so-called background effect, defined as the fracton of all species in a given ecosystem that is not fully protected due to the available background concentration. The maximum permissible effect is added to this background effect. The maximum permissible concentration can be obtained {{on the basis of the}} cumulative dose-effect curve...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} high-level <b>environmental</b> policy <b>objectives</b> {{under the}} Antarctic Treaty System (ATS), and {{their relation to}} Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA).

Whilst {{the concept of a}} strategic approach is already accepted in principle within the ATS, there remain difficulties in realising this. These include, inter alia, limitations in the established processes addressing environmental issues (particularly cumulative impacts), and ongoing tensions between the nominally agreed international objectives and national interests (including issues around unresolved territorial sovereignty claims) in practice. The article contends that given growing pressures on the Antarctic environment, high-level <b>environmental</b> policy <b>objectives</b> cannot be achieved through accumulated reactive ad hoc measures, or by industry self-regulation, but requires a systematic approach to strategic environmental considerations.
