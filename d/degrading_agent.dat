40|$|The current {{depletion}} of petroleum resources together with environmental issues {{have led to}} new approaches in plastic manufacturing. This trend involves using ecofriendly materials coming from renewable resources. Good candidates for this, due to their properties and availability, are the cellulose derivatives. Some of them, such as hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC), showed in previous studies a promising behavior when making polymeric foams. Unfortunately, the corresponding results with methyl ethyl hydroxyethylcellulose (MEHEC) were not as promising and the rather high molecular weight of the used MEHEC grade was here believed {{to be one of}} the important factors, affecting the foaming ability. Therefore, in this report, the effect of chain scission and thus the chain length on the foaming behavior of MEHEC was studied. The reduction in molecular weight was achieved through an addition of a <b>degrading</b> <b>agent</b> and salt to aqueous solutions of the original cellulose derivative (MEHEC). After drying, the resulting polymers were characterized, both in the solid state e. g. in the form of films, and as aqueous solutions. This characterization was focused on the rheological behavior. Techniques such as rotational rheometry and dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA) were used for this purpose. The results pointed to a decrease in molecular weight when adding encreasing amounts of the <b>degrading</b> <b>agent.</b> However, the addition of salt seemed to have an opposite effect, and an increase in viscosity was observed for increasing amounts of salt. A hot-mold process and density measurements were used for assessing the foaming ability. The reduction in molecular weight allowed aqueous solutions with up to 20 and 25...|$|E

Due to its molecular structure, which contains polyester segments derived from vegetable oil, the polymeric surface is susceptible to microorganism attack. This study tested the biological <b>degrading</b> <b>agent</b> that was in contact with the microorganisms resulting from microbiological grease degrading agents, when foam was inoculated. Solid-media agar-plate tests were conducted for their potential to evaluate the biodegradation of polymeric particles by specific strains of microorganisms during 216 hours.

We then describe an initial, efficient implementation in the Soar cognitive architecture and evaluate our system in a word sense disambiguation task, showing that it reduces the number of memory searches without <b>degrading</b> <b>agent</b> performance...|$|E
40|$|This work {{evaluates the}} {{particleboard}} made using glutardialdehyde modified corn starch as a binder {{in contact with}} soil and after exposed to fungal attack. Glutardialdehyde modified corn starch {{was used as a}} more environmentally friendly binder compared to conventional, formaldehyde based binder. Binder mixed with rubberwood particles, poured into 20 cm x 20 cm x 0. 5 cm mould and pre-pressed to form mat. Mat was hot-pressed at 150 C for 15 minutes for the binder to cure. Three densities of particularboards were made which were 0. 6 g/cm 3, 0. 7 g/cm 3 and 0. 8 g/cm 3. Soil burial test was done for 4 weeks and 8 weeks in controlled condition. Fungal exposure test were done using Schizophyllum commune, Pycnoporus sanguineus, Formitopsis palustris and Trametes versicolor species. Both tests were done following British Standard (DD ENV 807 : 2001). It was found out that using glutardialdehyde modified starch as particleboard binder had increased the resistivity of the wood based composite against soil <b>degrading</b> <b>agents</b> and fungal attack, compared to those made using native starch as the binder. This is due to better crosslinking of the aldehyde groups which made the particleboard stronger and harder for the <b>degrading</b> <b>agents</b> to penetrate. However, particleboard with different density levels did not affect their percentage of degradation as no trend of increment or decrement were seen with increasing density level...|$|R

It was demonstrated that the coimmobilized system degraded PCP more effectively than the nonimmobilized system. A solid substrate included in the coimmobilized system could support the biodegradation.

The reactor contains 30 internally skinned polysulphone membranes as an immobilization matrix for xylanase, the <b>degrading</b> <b>agent,</b> and was constructed with stainless steel to withstand high temperatures, as Thermomyces lanuginosus SSBP xylanase has an optimum temperature of 50 °C.

A unit cell assembly with a BASF Celtec&# 174;-P 2100 high temperature membrane electrode assembly (MEA) of 45 cm 2 active surface area is investigated by means of impedance spectroscopy. The concentrations in the anode feed gas of all impurities, unconverted methanol-water vapor mixture, CO and CO 2 were varied along with current density according to a multilevel factorial design of experiments. Results show that all the impurities degrade the performance, with CO being the most <b>degrading</b> <b>agent</b> and CO 2 the least. The factorial analysis shows that there is interdependence among {{the effects of the}} different factors considered. This interdependence suggests, for example, that tolerances to concentrations of CO above 2 % may be compromised by the presence in the anode feed of CO 2. Methanol has a poisoning effect on the fuel cell at all the tested feed ratios, and the performance drop is found to be proportional to the amount of methanol in feed gas. The effects are more pronounced when other impurities are also present in the feed gas, especially at higher methanol concentrations...|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to study the biodegradation of a polyurethane derived from castor oil, which contains polyester segment in its molecular structure, thus becoming susceptible to the microorganisms attack. The biodegradation of polyurethane was tested in contact with microorganisms resulting from microbiological grease <b>degrading</b> <b>agents,</b> in appropriate liquid media, with a duration of 156 days. The study was done by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), thermogravimetry (TG) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy with accessory for attenuated total reflectance (FTIR-ATR). The results suggest that the degradation of polyurethane derived from castor oil occurs. TG curves are used in order to indicate the biodegradation, showing changes between the thermal behavior of the samples that were inoculated with microorganisms and control. In the FTIR-ATR spectra, there are detectable changes between the spectra of control and attacked specimens; this suggests that degradation occurs, with the decreased intensity of the absorption band at 1042 cm- 1, corresponding to the esters links...|$|R

40|$|M. Tech. (Mechanical Engineering) This study {{investigated}} process development of recovering base oils from waste lithium based lubricating grease using a novel combination of thermal degradation {{in an aqueous}} caustic solution and solvent extraction. Lubricating greases consist of a thickening agent dispersed in mineral or synthetic oil, forming a colloidal suspension [1]. Large and increasing volumes of used lubricating oil and grease are produced each year and are considered hazardous wastes. During operation, grease suffers mechanical and thermal degradation [2]. Subsequently, it is regarded as waste {{and it must be}} disposed. The waste oil should be collected and recycled not only to prevent the environmental pollution but also to preserve natural resources. Solvent extraction is the preferred method to recycle waste lubricants as it is cost-effective and requires no further purification of the product [3]. The influence of extraction temperature, agitation strength, extraction time, <b>degrading</b> <b>agent</b> concentration, degrading agent-to-grease and solvent-to-sludge mixing ratios on base oil recovery from waste lubricating grease was investigated. This study further optimised the process by studying the influence of various degrading agents (LiOH, NaOH and KOH) and solvents (n-hexane, toluene, heptane, butane, hexanol and acetone) on oil recovery. Oil recovery was enhanced by increase in both extraction temperature, time and agitation speed. The optimum extraction time was found to be 12 minutes. KOH was found to be the optimum <b>degrading</b> <b>agent</b> compared to LiOH and NaOH. Oil recovery also increased from 8. 04 % to 36. 87 % with increase in KOH m/m from 5 % to 30 %. The recovery also increased with an increase of solvent-to-sludge ratio up to 1 : 6. n-Hexane gave the highest recovery of 74. 39 % while acetone gave the lowest of 7. 43 %. A solvent recovery of 82. 6 % to 88 % was obtained through fractional distillation. The study also investigated the differences between virgin and recycled oil using atomic absorption (AA), inductively coupled plasma (ICP) and Fourier transform infrared radiation (FTIR). Rheological studies of waste grease derived oil (WGDO) were also performed. ICP results showed traces of some elements such as Fe, Cu, Si, Ni and Al at a concentration of less than 0. 9 mg/L. Oxidation was observed to occur at a band length of 1716 cm- 1 while additives were identified at 1670 - 1725 cm- 1. The oil viscosity slightly increased with increasing shear rate at temperatures between 60 °C and 120 °C. The shear rate was varied from 200 to 1000 1 /s, with a viscosity convergence at 100 °C. A financial economic model was applied to investigate the feasibility of the recycling technology. For 800 kg/day treatment plant, an investment of R 6, 031, 304. 27 is required with a potential return on investment of 40 %. Recovery was found to be favourable option compared to landfilling as it offers both economic and environmental benefits...|$|E
40|$|The {{main object}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of donors, thermal donors and defects on the lifetime on n-type Czochralsky (Cz) silicon. Cz is a technique for making monocrystals by dipping a monocrystalline seed into the melt, and pulling the ingot up as the melt solidifies. Samples were prepared by sawing, grinding and polishing. Copper decoration and preferential etching was done to reveal the defects. Resistivity measurements were performed to investigate the donor distribution. The lifetime and oxygen concentration was measured. The lifetime may be influenced by donors and traps. Traps may be metallic or non-metallic. Dopants and metal contaminants are usually Scheil distributed, which typically involves a relatively stable distribution in most part of the ingot, and a rapid increase in concentration close to the bottom. Metal contaminants may be introduced from the feedstock, and dopants (either n or p dopants) are added to the melt. Oxygen is dissolved from the crucible. The oxygen concentration typically decreases with increasing length, and is controlled by the rotation speed. This was confirmed by the interstitial oxygen measurements. The oxygen concentration showed no change after heat treatment, but the presence of oxygen in itself may contribute to produce lifetime reducing agents, such as precipitates and thermal donors. Thermal donors were found in the first 18 cm of the ingot. Both the resistivity and lifetime measurements was used to calculate estimated lifetimes and donor concentrations, respectively. This estimated values were compared with the measured ones, revealing that the lifetime in the ingot was SRH dominated. Thermal donors were found to have less influence on the lifetime than the trapping. Oxygen precipitations may explain the low lifetime found {{in the center of the}} ingot up to about 30 cm from the crown. Such precipitations are often gathered in defect bands in the sample. CDI of a Cu decorated sample revealed a pattern of different defect densities, which also showed up at the surface of the sample after preferential etching. An H- or L- band was believed to be situated here, which both consist of small oxygen precipitates. Defects arize as a funktion of the pulling parameters, and a low growth rate was connected to the low lifetime here. Indications of the presence of non-metallic traps were found throughout the ingot. However, oxygen precipitates could not explain the non-metallic traps that was found on the outside of the ingot, and the cause of these is therefore unknown. It is however likely that these traps may be connected to the pullrate/temperature gradient-ratio. Most likely metallic traps were also present. It is uncertain whether the non-metallic or metallic traps were the most important to the lifetime of this ingot, as the relative distribution of the two cannot be decided with certainty from the results in this thesis. Contrasts in CDI and steep curves using PCD measurements vs length plots were believed to be due to the lifetime <b>degrading</b> <b>agent</b> that changes the fastest. Metallic traps and the phosphorous dopant are known to be Scheil distributed, hence they appear transparent for the lifetime measurements in areas where the distribution is stable. Thermal donors and non-metallic traps are thus more likely to create contrast in the top parts of an ingot. However, it is not necessarily the phenomenon that causes the contrast that is the major lifetime degradation contributor. </p...|$|E

40|$|Concrete is {{the primary}} {{construction}} material for civil infrastructures and generally consists of cement, coarse aggregates, sand, admixtures and water. Cementitious materials are characterized by quasi-brittle behaviour and susceptible to cracking [1]. The cracking process within concrete begins with isolated nano-cracks, which then conjoin to form micro-cracks and in turn macro-cracks. Formation and growth of cracks lead to loss of mechanical performance with time and also make concrete accessible to water and other <b>degrading</b> <b>agents</b> such as CO 2, chlorides, sulfates, etc. leading to strength loss and corrosion of steel rebars. To improve brittleness of concrete, reinforcements such as polymeric as well as glass and carbon fibers have been used and microfibers improved the mechanical properties significantly by delaying (but could not stop) the transformation of micro-cracks into macro forms [2]. This fact encouraged the use of nano-sized fillers in concrete to prevent the growth of nano-cracks transforming in to micro and macro forms. Nanoparticles like SiO 2, Fe 2 O 3, and TiO 2 led to considerable improvement in mechanical performance and moreover, nano-TiO 2 helped to remove organic pollutants from concrete surfaces [3]...|$|R
30|$|The {{effect of}} contact {{time for the}} {{photocatalytic}} degradation of eosine blue dye by pure and doped cobalt oxide nanoparticles is shown in Fig.  8 a, b. The dye was quickly degraded in first 20  min and then degradation rate continuously goes on increasing and reaches equilibrium in about 90  min. The rate of degradation of dye was initially fast because dye concentration was maximum; therefore, maximum amount of dye was adsorbed immediately and hence, the initial degradation rate was faster. As the maximum concentration of dye was degraded from aqueous solution, the rate of degradation reaches at equilibrium. The rate of degradation of EB dye was maximum for doped cobalt oxide compared to pure cobalt oxide nanoparticles. The doped cobalt oxide has less band gap due to dopant Fe 2 + and Ni 2 + compared to pure cobalt oxide; hence, doped cobalt oxide was worked as a better photocatalyst for photocatalytic degradation of EB dye. The degradation of eosine blue can be explained {{on the basis of}} heterogeneous photocatalysis. This process involves generation of e− and h+ which again generated O 2 − and −OH radicals, respectively. These radicals are highly reactive and act as <b>degrading</b> <b>agents.</b> Moreover, photogenerated hydrogen atom from water is responsible for reductive degradation [25].|$|R

In this study, we performed an extensive analysis of a mp 65 Δ mutant to assess the role of this protein in cell wall integrity, adherence to epithelial cells and biofilm formation. Results The mp 65 Δ mutant showed a high sensitivity {{to a range of}} cell wall-perturbing and <b>degrading</b> <b>agents,</b> especially Congo red, which induced morphological changes such as swelling, clumping and formation of hyphae. The mp 65 Δ mutant showed an activation of two MAPKs (Mkc 1 p and Cek 1 p), a high level of expression of two stress-related genes (DDR 48 and SOD 5), and a modulated expression of β-glucan epitopes, but no gross changes in cell wall polysaccharide composition. Interestingly, the mp 65 Δ mutant displayed a marked reduction in adhesion to BEC and Caco- 2 cells and severe defects in biofilm formation when compared to the wild type. All of the mentioned properties were totally or partially recovered in a revertant strain, demonstrating the specificity of gene deletion. Conclusions We demonstrate that the MP 65 gene of Candida albicans plays a significant role in maintaining cell wall integrity, as well as in adherence to epithelia and biofilm formation, which are major virulence attributes of this fungus. </p...|$|R
30|$|As a fact, microclimatic {{conditions}} and salt content, obviously caused by water rise and/or infiltration {{are recognized as}} the main <b>degrading</b> <b>agents</b> [3, 7, 9 – 13]. Measurement and conditioning of the microclimate are ruled by Italian (UNI) [14 – 18] and European (EN) norms [19 – 21] whereas, for salt content, only the measurement procedure is provided [22]. In our opinion, norms concerning microclimate and salt content, should be revised because incomplete and/or too old and not {{in line with the}} technological progress. However, such debate {{is beyond the scope of}} the present paper. Establishing optimal microclimatic conditions for stone buildings must be considered a simple academic exercise as it cannot be generalized to any environment. On the contrary, evaluation case-by-case, of the microclimate variability is definitely beneficial as its extent and frequency are really responsible for degradation. This statement is irrefutable as proven by the survival of very ancient artefacts in climatically extreme environments such as burial or diving. Certainly, an analytically significant monitoring of a building produces a large amount of data that it becomes difficult to process. Multivariate analysis surely provides a simple overview of data and, consequently, allows us to identify correlations that in turn will help to reduce the monitoring points [23, 24]. The main problems of the UNI 11087 : 2003 [22], concerning the salt content analysis, relies on the invasive analytical procedure and the lack of a sampling guideline. Alternative procedures were proposed by various research groups [25 – 29].|$|R

30|$|Wood {{preservation}} {{with either}} oil-borne or water-borne preservatives can eliminate biological attack by fungi, insects and termites and can increase mechanical strength [8]. However, no single preservative is available {{that can provide}} all the desired kinds of protection. Though the natural durability of wood offers {{a certain degree of}} resistance to wood <b>degrading</b> <b>agents,</b> there is evidently no ideal wood species that can be used universally in any application without eventual break-down [9]. As a result, a wide range of techniques and methods have been developed for wood preservation [10 – 13]. Preservation {{is an important part of}} wood technology, encompassing every process of chemical or physical treatment that is undertaken to extend the service life of wood by optimizing its resistance to biological attack, fire, shrinkage and swelling due to changes in MC. One of the greatest advantages of wood treatment is that it reduces the ability of wood to absorb moisture and thus improves its dimensional stability. Water repelling characteristics have been shown to increase after the impregnation of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) sapwood with linseed oil [14], coconut oil and various tall oils [15]. Even though the decreased hygroscopicity in heat-treated wood is reported to increase decay resistance [16 – 18], thermally modified wood is not found to be suitable for ground contact outdoor applications [3, 19]. The decay resistance depends on several factors, such as wood species, treatment method and exposure conditions. For example, a noticeably lower mass loss due to fungal attack is observed for oil–heat-treated wood compared with air–heat-treated wood [20]. Nevertheless, heat-treated wood is found to be susceptible to termites as well as marine borers [21, 22]. No single method has been shown to protect wood from all types of biodegradation. Thus, heat treatment in combination with oil can provide more effective protection than single treatment methods alone [13, 20].|$|R

When looking closer at the samples in microscope something that looked like crystalloid formations appeared. This bachelor thesis gave the opportunity to investigate the occurrence of crystals and other precipitations on paint layers and their degradation effects. Through the literature study indications are given to what kind of crystals and perspirations one can find on a painted surface. Also factors that influence the formation of these reaction products are presented. This thesis includes a case study of Holdhus church’s pulpit. For the analysis microscope, scanning electron microscope- Energy dispersive X-ray (SEM-EDX),fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) have been used in attempts to investigate the presence of precipitations that derive from the paint layer. Because of the samples’ size, composition and time limitations, the use of FTIR and XRD have been limited in this study. Some suggestions to the origin of the precipitations found on the painting layer are presented, together with some theories based on the literature studies. The results from the analysis were inconclusive, as they could support neither the presence nor the absence of fatty acids or true crystals on the paint layer.

Relationships were sought between results of the cellular analysis and the extent of environmental stress cracking (ESC), as characterized by scanning electron microscopy. Surface degradation was semiquantified with percent light transmittance. The materials used were: base PEUU, base PEUU with 1 % Santowhite® antioxidant powder, base PEUU with 5 % Methacrol 2138 F® antifume agent, and base PEUU with both 1 % Santowhite® and 5 % Methacrol 2138 F®. A comparison of unstrained base PEUU with base PEUU strained to 400 % elongation indicated that the rate of cell fusion, but not d(o) and d(fc), increased in the presence of strain. In all strained samples, additives that strongly affected the ESC also influenced FBGC kinetic parameters. Strained PEUU containing Santowhite® had the lowest d(o), the slowest rate of cell fusion, and lowest d(fc), and the least incidence of ESC. The results suggest that the incidence of ESC in PEUU was decreased in the presence of Santowhite®, which also lowered the number of adherent macrophages participating in FBGC formation, the rate of FBGC formation and the subsequent FBGC density. These studies also indicate that strain in PEUUs does not directly modulate the adherent macrophage and FBGC density. Further studies are necessary to delineate the relationship between PEUU strain and adherent macrophage and FBGC activation, which leads to the exocytosis of <b>degrading</b> <b>agents</b> and the observed incidence of biodegradation. | Quantitative {{description of}} foreign body giant cell (FBGC) formation on poly(etherurethane urea) (PEUU) surfaces {{as a function of}} time can conceivably predict the effects of polymer characteristics on cellular responses in vivo.

40|$|Open environments are {{characterized}} by their uncertainty and non-determinism. Sophisticated agents operating in these environments must reason about their local problem solving activities, interact with other agents, plan {{a course of action}} and carry out actions in the face of limited resources and uncertainty about action outcomes and the actions of other agents, all in real-time. Many ecient architectures and algorithms that support these activities have been developed and studied. However, none of these architectures explicitly reason about the consumption of time and other resources by control activities such as scheduling and coordination, which may <b>degrade</b> an <b>agent's</b> performance. This paper describes work in progress to dene and build a meta-level control framework which will account for the cost of making appropriate decisions about these control activities, without consuming signicant resources in the process. ...|$|R

Ideally, an agent should only plan when the expected improvementoutweighs the expected cost and no resources should be expended on making this decision. To do this, an agent would have to be omniscient. The problem of how to approximate this ideal, without consuming too many resources in the process, is the meta-level control problem for a resource bounded rational agent. There are two central questions that have to be addressed for meta-level control: Where to focus planning effort and when to start executing the current best plan. These questions are interrelated. To start execution, the beginning of the plan must be elaborated to a level where it is operational...|$|R

This paper presents the experimental investigation on the effects of moisture on the pull-off bond strength of GFRP-strengthened brick specimens. The specimens have been prepared following the wet lay-up procedure and exposed to constant moisture level of 100 % R. H. at 23 ̊C for 8 weeks. The degradation in the bond performance has been investigated by performing pull-off tests on the conditioned specimens after 4 and 8 weeks of exposure. The reversibility of the bond degradation has been also studied by storing some specimens in the laboratory conditions for 1 week after conditioning and before performing the pull-off tests. Comparative analysis has been performed and the main results are presented and discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{implementation}} of reliability methods for designing new structures and assessing {{the safety and}} evaluating the performance of existing structures and infrastructure systems has gained widespread acceptance. Consequently, reliability-based design specifications {{in the form of}} load and resistance factor design (LRFD) methods have dominated the development of current codes and standards. This paper reviews the reliability-based performance criteria used to calibrate design and evaluation codes and standards for assessing the strength, serviceability, and fatigue resistance of structural components. The review shows that large differences exist in the target reliability levels adopted for evaluating the strength of various types of structural members and materials. These differences result from many factors, including (1) intended structure design and service life; (2) expected member modes of failure (e. g., ductile or brittle); (3) importance of the individual member to overall system integrity (secondary member, column, or connection); (4) experiences with previous designs; (5) material and construction costs; (6) structure type and occupancy; and (7) risk tolerance of the engineering community and the public within a code’s jurisdiction. For other than seismic hazards, current specifications remain primarily focused on the evaluation of individual structural members and components, although recently proposed performance-based design (PBD) procedures apply varying target member reliability levels that depend on structure categories, modes of failure, and required levels of structural performance. The {{implementation of}} reliability-based durability criteria in design standards is still a subject of research owing to difficulties encountered in modeling material degradation mechanisms and their interactions and in the collection and mapping of long-term site-specific data on <b>degrading</b> <b>agents.</b> Because of large epistemic uncertainties, the evaluation of the fatigue safety of structural components in engineering practice still relies on conservative basic models of damage accumulation using S-N curves or basic fracture mechanics crack growth models. Overall, reliability-calibrated structural standards are producing designs that offer a good balance between safety and cost. The future implementation of risk-based methods will further enhance the ability to meet structure-specific performance requirements set by owners and users...|$|R
40|$|Biomimetic {{flapping}} wing vehicles {{have attracted}} recent interest {{because of their}} numerous potential military and civilian applications. In this paper we describe {{the design of a}} multi-agent adaptive controller for such a vehicle. This controller is responsible for estimating the vehicle pose (position and orientation) and then generating four parameters needed for split-cycle control of wing movements to correct pose errors. These parameters are produced via a subsumption architecture rule base. The control strategy is fault tolerant. Using an online learning process an agent continuously monitors the vehicle 2 ̆ 7 s behavior and initiates diagnostics if the behavior has <b>degraded.</b> This <b>agent</b> can then autonomously adapt the rule base if necessary. Each rule base is constructed using a combination of extrinsic and intrinsic evolution.

40|$|After trauma, {{articular}} cartilage often does not heal due to incomplete bonding of the fractured surfaces. In {{this study we}} investigated the ability of chemical cross-linkers to facilitate bonding of {{articular cartilage}}, either alone or in combination with a pre-treatment with surface-degrading agents. Articular cartilage blocks were harvested from the femoropatellar groove of bovine calves. Two cartilage blocks, either after pre-treatment or without, were assembled in a custom-designed chamber in partial apposition and subjected to cross-linking treatment. Subsequently, bonding of cartilage was measured as adhesive strength, that is, the maximum force at rupture of bonded cartilage blocks divided by the overlap area. In a first approach, bonding was investigated after treatment with cross-linking reagents only, employing glutaraldehyde, 1 -ethyl- 3 -diaminopropyl-carbodiimide (EDC) /N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS), genipin, or transglutaminase. Experiments were conducted with or without compression of the opposing surfaces. Compression during cross-linking strongly enhanced bonding, especially when applying EDC/NHS and glutaraldehyde. Therefore, all further experiments were performed under compressive conditions. Combinations {{of each of the}} four cross-linking <b>agents</b> with the <b>degrading</b> pre-treatments, pepsin, trypsin, and guanidine, led to distinct improvements in bonding compared to the use of cross-linkers alone. The highest values of adhesive strength were achieved employing combinations of pepsin or guanidine with EDC/NHS, and guanidine with glutaraldehyde. The release of extracellular matrix components, that is, glycosaminoglycans and total collagen, from cartilage blocks after pre-treatment was measured, but could not be directly correlated to the determined adhesive strength. Cytotoxicity was determined for all substances employed, that is, surface <b>degrading</b> <b>agents</b> and cross-linkers, using the resazurin assay. Taking the favourable cell vitality after treatment with pepsin and EDC/NHS and the cytotoxic effects of guanidine and glutaraldehyde into account, the combination of pepsin and EDC/NHS appeared to be the most advantageous treatment in this study. In conclusion, bonding of articular cartilage blocks was achieved by chemical fixation of their surface components using cross-linking reagents. Application of compressive forces and prior modulation of surface structures enhanced cartilage bonding significantly. Enzymatic treatment in combination with cross-linkers may represent a promising addition to current techniques for articular cartilage repair...|$|R
40|$|An {{in-depth}} investigation was undertaken {{of the chemical}} changes to wood induced by <b>degrading</b> <b>agents</b> in dry burial environments. The degradation state of eleven wood samples from dry archaeological sites in Egypt was evaluated by combining the information obtained by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), wet chemical analysis (WCA), attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) and analytical pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry with in situ silylation (Py(HMDS) -GC-MS). The samples belonged to five different wood species (Faidherbia albida, Ficus sycomorus, Taxus baccata, Pinus sylvestris and Tamarix sp.) and came from three different archaeological sites corresponding to three different time periods (from ca. 1700 BC to ca. 1700 AD). The results were compared with sound reference wood of the same species. SEM enabled a fungal attack to be identified {{in some of the}} samples. WCA highlighted the preferential loss of lignin or carbohydrates in these samples, but also showed unusually high values of water-soluble substances in most of them. FTIR spectra acquired before and after the extraction of the samples revealed that this soluble fraction generally contained depolymerised carbohydrates and/or lignin units. Py(HMDS) -GC-MS was applied without any sample pre-treatment and was used to assess the alteration/depolymerisation of the individual wood components, thus complementing the picture regarding the chemical changes. The results showed that, unlike waterlogged archaeological wood, most of the degraded wood components â 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 3 depolymerised carbohydrates and/or lignin â 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 3 had not leached away from the dry wood matrix, and thus complicated the interpretation of data. The commonly used parameters, such as the H/L (holocellulose/lignin) ratio, failed to give a correct evaluation of the wood degradation when both carbohydrates and lignin were degraded. The preservation conditions of the samples were very variable, from very good to a high depletion of carbohydrates, to the preferential depletion of lignin, or comparable levels of carbohydrate and lignin degradation. This was sometimes observed within the same wood species and the same archaeological site. This highlighted how difficult the interpretation can be in order to correctly evaluate the multiple causes of degradation affecting dry archaeological wood. An analytical approach using complementary techniques appears to be essential...|$|R
