5000|$|To put {{instrument}} flight rules into context, {{a brief overview}} of visual flight rules (VFR) is necessary. It is possible and fairly straightforward, in relatively clear weather conditions, to fly a plane solely by reference to outside visual cues, such as the horizon to maintain orientation, nearby buildings and terrain features for navigation, and other aircraft to maintain separation. This is known as operating the aircraft under VFR, and is the most common mode of operation for small aircraft. However, it is safe to fly VFR only when these outside references can be clearly seen from a sufficient distance; when flying through or above clouds, or in fog, rain, dust or similar low-level weather conditions, these references can be obscured. Thus, cloud ceiling and flight visibility are the most important variables for safe operations during all phases of flight. [...] The minimum weather conditions for ceiling and visibility for VFR flights are defined in FAR Part 91.155, and vary {{depending on the type of}} airspace in which the aircraft is operating, and on whether the flight is conducted during daytime or nighttime. However, typical daytime VFR minimums for most airspace is 3 statute miles of flight visibility and a <b>distance</b> <b>from</b> <b>clouds</b> of 500' below, 1,000' above, and 2,000' feet horizontally.

The measurement uncertainty caused by the calibration is the most relevant contribution to the overall uncertainty of radiometers. During the outdoor calibration of radiometers the meteorological conditions have to be observed carefully and data points collected under unfavorable conditions must be rejected. The rejection criteria concern the level of the involved irradiances, wind speed and –direction, and also the cloud conditions. The latter are quantified in terms of the minimum angular <b>distance</b> of <b>clouds</b> <b>from</b> the sun and are usually determined visually by an observer. A purely manual visual determination of the <b>cloud’s</b> angular <b>distance</b> <b>from</b> the sun is time consuming and often inaccurate.

40|$|Many {{investigations}} using {{satellite data}} {{have determined that}} aerosol optical depth and cloud cover are correlated and some have interpreted the correlation as evidence of an aerosol indirect effect on clouds. This study uses in situ aircraft observations taken during the Indian Ocean Experiment (INDOEX), February–March 1999, and mostly over the northern Indian Ocean, to show that on average, relative humidity increases as distance to the boundaries of small marine trade cumulus decreases. The increase is sufficient to cause substantial growth of hygroscopic aerosol particles and consequently greatly enhance particle scattering cross sections near clouds. The measured increase is from a relative humidity of about 90 % at 1 -km horizontal <b>distance</b> <b>from</b> the <b>cloud</b> to about 94 – 96 % at 100 m <b>from</b> <b>cloud</b> edge. This increase would result in about a 40 – 80 % increase in aerosol scattering cross section based on the composition used to model the aerosol. Observations of scattering {{in the vicinity of}} clouds using 30 -m-resolution imagery <b>from</b> the Multichannel <b>Cloud</b> Radiometer (MCR) indicated that the increase in scattering within 1 – 2 km of cloud edge was about 50 %, comparable to the increase calculated for the particle scattering cross sections. On the basis of these findings, global average estimates of the aerosol direct radiative effect as derived from satellite observations of cloud-free oceans is estimated to be 35 – 65 % larger than that inferred for large (> 20 km) cloud-free ocean regions.

The photometric properties of these stars are compatible with a metal-poor ([Fe/H] = - 2. 2) and old (13 Gyr) isochrone located at a distance modulus of similar to 18. 8, i. e., a distance of similar to 57 kpc.

40|$|International audienceHail is more {{hazardous}} {{for aircraft}} engines compared to rain and snow, mainly, because of its solid nature and high water content. In extreme cases {{it can lead to}} engine flame out. In order to avoid such situations, aero engines should be designed to withstand hail ingestion. For this purpose we have studied the post-impact characteristics of ice, such as particle velocity and directions of travel. To achieve this goal, a large experimental program has been undertaken, in which spherical ice specimens were projected against a rigid plate. Three specimen diameters (6. 2, 12. 9 and 27. 5 mm) and four impact angles (20, 45, 67. 2 and 90 °) were considered, as well as a wide range of impact velocities (60 - 200 m/s). From this experimental work, we can conclude that the ice fragments formed after impact do not bounce back and that the post-impact ice trajectory angle is lower than 2 °. This is in line with observations found in the literature. On the other hand, the ice fragments are mainly organised in a circular cloud, when observed in the target plane. The center of this cloud has the same velocity as the initial ice ball tangential impact velocity. Furthermore, the cloud radius expands with a rate proportional to the ice ball normal impact velocity. Finally, each fragment inside the cloud has a relative velocity which varies linearly with its <b>distance</b> <b>from</b> the <b>cloud</b> center.

Both measured Ångström exponents and aerosol size distribution retrievals made before, during and after cumulus development often suggest little change in fine mode particle size; therefore, implying possible new particle formation in addition to cloud processing and humidification of existing particles. In addition to sun–sky radiometer measurements of large enhancements of fine mode AOD, lidar measurements made from both ground-based and aircraft-based instruments during the experiment also measured large increases in aerosol signal at altitudes associated with the presence of fair weather cumulus clouds. These data show modifications of the aerosol vertical profile {{as a result of the}} aerosol enhancements at and below cloud altitudes. The airborne lidar data were utilized to estimate the spatial extent of these aerosol enhancements, finding increased AOD, backscatter and extinction out to 2. 5 km <b>distance</b> <b>from</b> the <b>cloud</b> edge.

40|$|Recent studies {{utilizing}} satellite retrievals {{have shown}} {{a strong correlation between}} aerosol optical depth (AOD) and cloud cover. However, these retrievals from passive sensors are subject to many limitations, including cloud adjacency (or 3 D) effects, possible cloud contamination, uncertainty in the AOD retrieval. Some of these limitations do not exist in High Spectral Resolution Lidar (HSRL) observations; for instance, HSRL observations are not a ected by cloud adjacency effects, are less prone to cloud contamination, and offer accurate aerosol property measurements (backscatter coefficient, extinction coefficient, lidar ratio, backscatter Angstrom exponent,and aerosol optical depth) at a neospatial resolution (less than 100 m) in the vicinity of clouds. Hence, the HSRL provides an important dataset for studying aerosol and cloud interaction. In this study, we statistically analyze aircraft-based HSRL profiles according to their <b>distance</b> <b>from</b> the nearest <b>cloud,</b> assuring that all profile comparisons are subject to the same large-scale meteorological conditions. Our results indicate that AODs from HSRL are about 17 % higher in the proximity of clouds (approximately 100 m) than far away <b>from</b> <b>clouds</b> (4. 5 km), which is much smaller than the reported cloud 3 D effect on AOD retrievals. The backscatter and extinction coefficients also systematically increase in the vicinity of clouds, which can be explained by aerosol swelling in the high relative humidity (RH) environment and/or aerosol growth through in cloud processing (albeit not conclusively). On the other hand, we do not observe a systematic trend in lidar ratio; we hypothesize that this is caused by the opposite effects of aerosol swelling and aerosol in-cloud processing on the lidar ratio. Finally, the observed backscatter Angstrom exponent (BAE) does not show a consistent trend because of the complicated relationship between BAE and RH. We demonstrate that BAE should not be used as a surrogate for Angstrom exponent, especially at high RH...|$|R

This study uses geostationary satellite imagery from the Spinning Enhanced Visible and InfraRed Imager (SEVIRI) to estimate UTH using water vapour channel radiances. Deep convection over Tropical Africa is detected using the difference between 6. 2 mm and 7. 3 mm brightness temperatures. The sensitivity of TOA brightness temperatures to cloud properties including cloud top height and optical depth are modelled using the Santa Barbara Disort Atmospheric Radiative Transfer model with thresholds developed using colocated matchups with CloudSat and CALIPSO cloud classifications. The most appropriate thresholds are determined using probability statistics and receiver operating characteristic curves. Deep convective clouds are tracked over their lifetime in June and December 2010 using a cloud tracking algorithm, based on an area overlap method.

UTH decreases with <b>distance</b> <b>from</b> the <b>cloud</b> edge, whilst a small increase is seen over the cloud lifetime.
