40|$|Measurements {{of stable}} and {{radioactive}} spallation products in meteorites allow to investigate their histories, especially {{with respect to}} the exposure to <b>galactic</b> <b>cosmic</b> ray <b>particles</b> and the pre-atmospheric size of the object. While the concentrations of spallation products lead to the determination of exposure and terrestrial ages, production rate ratios are characteristic for the location of the sample in the meteorite. So, one of the aims of this investigation on meteorites is to obtain depth indicators from suitable pairs of cosmogenic nuclides. Because of the different depth profiles for nuclide productions it is necessary to determine the concentrations of a larger number of spallation products in aliquots of a single small sample.

40|$|Abstract. A {{survey is}} given on the {{application}} of medium-energy nuclear data to the interpretation of cosmogenic nuclides in extraterrestrial matter. Cosmogenic nuclides in extraterrestrial matter provide {{a wealth of information}} on the exposure and collision histories of small objects in space and {{on the history of the}} solar and <b>galactic</b> <b>cosmic</b> radiation itself. The interpreta-tion of the observed abundances of cosmogenic nuclides requires detailed and accurate knowledge of their production rates. Accelerator experiments provide a quantitative basis for respective model calculations by measuring the relevant cross sec-tions and by realistically simulating the interactions of galactic protons with meteoroids under completely controlled condi-tions. We review the establishment of physical model calculations of cosmogenic nuclide production in extraterrestrial matter on the basis of such accelerator experiments. In a series of thin-target and thick-target experiments, a cross section database has been established which allows for model calculations with accuracies better than 10 % and 2 % when predicting produc-tion rates of cosmogenic nuclides and production rate ratios, respectively. On the basis of these model calculations long-term spectra of solar and <b>galactic</b> <b>cosmic</b> ray <b>particles</b> can be determined and the observed abundances of cosmogenic nuclides in meteorites can be interpreted with respect to their exposure histories...|$|R
40|$|The {{increased}} {{radiation exposure}} at aviation altitudes is {{of public interest}} {{as well as of}} legal relevance in many countries. The dose rates that are elevated compared to sea level are mainly caused by <b>galactic</b> <b>cosmic</b> ray <b>particles</b> interacting with the atmosphere and producing a complex radiation field at aviation altitudes. The intensity and composition of this radiation field mainly depend on altitude, geomagnetic shielding, and primary particle intensity. In this work, we present a model based on Monte Carlo simulations, which retrospectively estimates secondary particle fluence as well as ambient dose equivalent rates and effective dose rates at any point in the atmosphere. This model will be used as the physical core in the Professional Aviation Dose Calculator (PANDOCA) software developed by the German Aerospace Center (Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt) for the calculation of route doses in aviation. The calculations are based on <b>galactic</b> <b>cosmic</b> ray spectra taking into account primary nuclei from hydrogen to iron by direct transport calculations of hydrogen and helium nuclei and approximating heavier nuclei by the number of protons equaling the corresponding atomic number.

40|$|Anomalous Cosmic Rays (ACRs) are {{accelerated}} {{far out in}} the heliosphere at {{the termination}} shock. As they diffuse back through the solar system to 1 AU, they are modulated in intensity.

40|$|Detailed {{composition}} measurements {{can be a}} {{very powerful}} means of tracing origins, a fact used regularly by forensic scientists and art historians. One of the main motivating factors for making detailed observations of cosmic rays was always the hope that a unique compositional signature could be found which pointed unambiguously to a particular source. This has proven much harder than expected, but we have now reached a point where it appears possible to begin to decipher the information contained in the compositional data; the key, we have discovered, is to read the data not in isolation, but in the context provided by our general astronomical knowledge and by recent developments in shock acceleration theory (Meyer, Drury and Ellison, 1997, 1998; Ellison, Drury and Meyer, 1997).

40|$|The {{radiation}} exposure in space missions {{can be reduced}} by careful mission planning and appropriate measures, such as provision of a radiation shelter, but it cannot be eliminated. The {{reason for that is}} the high penetration capability of the radiation components owing to their high energies. Radiation is therefore an acknowledged primary concern for manned spaceflight and is a potentially limiting factor for long-term orbital and interplanetary missions. The radiation environment is a complex mixture of charged particles of solar and galactic origin and of the radiation belts, as well as of secondary particles produced in interactions of the <b>galactic</b> <b>cosmic</b> <b>particles</b> with the nuclei of atmosphere of the earth. The complexity even increases by placing a spacecraft into this environment owing to the interaction of the radiation components with the shielding material. Therefore it is a challenge to provide for appropriate measurements in this radiation field, coping with the limited resources on experiment power and mass. Solid-state dosemeters were already chosen for measurements in the first manned flights. Thermoluminescence dosemeters (TLDs) and plastic nuclear track detectors (PNTD) especially found a preferred application because they are light-weighted, need no power supply and they are tissue-equivalent. Most of the data available until 1996 were gathered by using these passive detectors; this especially holds for heavy ion particle spectra. The systems, supplemented by converter foils or fission detectors and bubble detectors, provide information on dose, particle flux-, energyand linear energy transfer spectra of the ionising radiation and neutron fluxes and doses. From 1989, silicon detectors were used for dose and flux measurements and later on for particle spectrometry. Silicon detectors were demonstrated as a powerful tool for the description of space radiation environment. Optical simulated luminescence (OSL) detectors have now been introduced as a new system in space research. Both, OSL and superheated drop detectors are candidates for personal dosimetry systems.

40|$|Cosmic ray {{interactions}} with lunar rocks and meteorites produce {{small amounts of}} radionuclides and stable isotopes. Advances in Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) allow production rates to be measured routinely in well-documented lunar rocks and meteorites. These measurements are analyzed using theoretical models {{to learn about the}} object itself and the history of the cosmic rays that fell on it. Good cross section measurements are essential input to the theoretical calculations. Most primary <b>cosmic</b> ray <b>particles</b> are protons so reliable cross sections for proton-induced reactions are essential. A cross section is deemed accurate if measurements made by different experimenters using different techniques result in consistent values. Most cross sections for proton induced reactions are now well measured. However, good cross section measurements for neutron-induced reactions are still needed. These cross sections are required to fully account for all <b>galactic</b> <b>cosmic</b> ray interactions at depth in an extraterrestrial object. When primary <b>galactic</b> <b>cosmic</b> ray (GCR) <b>particles</b> interact with an object many secondary neutrons are produced, which also initiate spallation reactions.

The chemical evolution of the ice samples was followed online and in situ via a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer and a quadrupole mass spectrometer. The temporal profiles of the cyclopropenone and propynal isomers suggest (pseudo-) first-order kinetics. The cyclic structure (c-C_ 3 H_ 2 O) is formed via an addition of triplet carbon monoxide to ground-state acetylene (or vice versa); propynal (HCCCHO) can be synthesized from a carbon monoxide-acetylene complex via a [HCO center dot center dot center dot CCH] radical pair inside the matrix cage.

After a short introduction to the topic and an historical overview, the properties of cosmic rays are discussed with respect to different energy ranges. The origin and the propagation of nuclei in the Galaxy are dealt with from a theoretical point of view. The mechanisms leading to the acceleration of nuclei by supernova remnants and to their subsequent diffusion through the inhomogeneities of the galactic magnetic field are discussed and some clue is given on the predictions and observations of fluxes of antimatter, both from astrophysical sources and from dark matter annihilation in the galactic halo. The experimental techniques and instrumentations employed {{for the detection of}} cosmic rays at Earth are described. Direct methods are viable up to 10 ^ 14 eV, by means of experiments flown on balloons or satellites, while above that energy, due to their very low flux, cosmic rays can be studied only indirectly by exploiting the particle cascades they produce in the atmosphere. The possible physical interpretation of the peculiar features observed in the energy spectrum of <b>galactic</b> <b>cosmic</b> rays, and in particular the so-called "knee" at about 4 x 10 ^ 15 eV, are discussed. A section is devoted to the region between about 10 ^ 18 and 10 ^ 19 eV, which is believed to host the transition between <b>galactic</b> and extragalactic <b>cosmic</b> rays.

The energy range of interest extends over {{the full range}} of particle acceleration from keV energies of suprathermal seed particles to GeV energies of <b>galactic</b> <b>cosmic</b> ray <b>particles.</b> Present spatial coverage is for operational and legacy spacecraft operating from the inner to the outer heliosphere, e. g. from measurements by the two Helios spacecraft to 0. 3 AU to the inner heliosheath region now being traversed by the two Voyager spacecraft. This coverage will eventually be extended inward to ten solar radii by the planned NASA solar probe mission {{and at the same time}} beyond the heliopause into the outer heliosheath by continued Voyager operations. The geospace fleet of spacecraft providing near-Earth interplanetary measurements, selected magnetospheric spacecraft providing direct measurements of penetrating interplanetary energetic particles, and interplanetary cruise measurements from planetary spacecraft missions further extend VEPO resources to the domain of geospace and planetary interactions. Ground-based (e. g., neutron monitor) and high-altitude suborbital measurements can expand coverage to the highest energies of <b>galactic</b> <b>cosmic</b> rays affected by heliospheric interaction and of solar energetic particles. Science applications include investigation of solar flare and coronal mass ejection events. acceleration and transport of interplanetary particles within the inner heliosphere, cosmic ray interactions with planetary surfaces and atmospheres, sources of suprathermal and anomalous cosmic ray ions in the outer heliosphere, and solar cycle modulation of <b>galactic</b> <b>cosmic</b> rays. Robotic and human exploration, and eventual habitation, of planetary and space environments beyond the Earth require knowledge of radiation hazards informed by VEPO data resources. The VEPO project has completed the first year of work to define science requirements, to document and register selected data products in SPASE format while evolving SPASE for increased applicability to VEPO data, and to support enhanced discovery and access for these products through the evolving data query and middleware system of the Virtual Heliospheric Observatory (VHO). The VEPO team operates as a heliophysics focus group for energetic particle data resources in partnership with VHO and also leverages existing data services of NASA's Space Physics Data Facility. We invite comments from the U. S. and international data provider and user communities on review of the current VEPO/VHO user interface, on directions for future evolution of VEPO and supporting data systems including VHO and SPDF, and on relations to other elements of the heliophysics virtual observatory environment...|$|R
