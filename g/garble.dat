Simply downloading a public key from somewhere is not an overwhelming assurance of that association; deliberate (or accidental) impersonation is possible. From its first version, PGP has always included provisions for distributing user's public keys in an 'identity certificate', which is also constructed cryptographically so that any tampering (or accidental <b>garble)</b> is readily detectable. However, merely making a certificate which is impossible to modify without being detected is insufficient; this can prevent corruption only after the certificate has been created, not before. Users must also ensure by some means that the public key in a certificate actually does belong to the person or entity claiming it. From its first release, PGP products have included an internal certificate 'vetting scheme' to assist with this, a trust model which has been called a web of trust. A given public key (or more specifically, information binding a user name to a key) may be digitally signed by a third party user to attest to the association between someone (actually a user name) and the key. There are several levels of confidence which can be included in such signatures. Although many programs read and write this information, few (if any) include this level of certification when calculating whether to trust a key.|$|E

Our main contributions are as follows: 1. We propose the notion of an interactive <b>garbling</b> scheme, where the <b>garbled</b> circuit is generated through an interactive protocol between the <b>garbler</b> and the evaluator. The <b>garbled</b> circuit is correct and privacy preserving even if one of the two parties was acting maliciously during <b>garbling.</b> The security notion is game based. 2. We show that an interactive <b>garbling</b> scheme combined with a Universally Composable (UC) secure oblivious transfer protocol {{can be used in a}} black-box manner to implement two-party computation (2 PC) UC securely against any probabilistic polynomial time static and malicious adversary. The protocol abstracts many recent protocols for implementing 2 PC from <b>garbled</b> circuits and will al-low future designers of interactive <b>garbling</b> schemes to prove security with the simple game based definitions, as opposed to directly proving UC security for each new scheme. 3. We propose an instantiation of interactive <b>garbling</b> by designing a new protocol in the LEGO family of protocols for efficient <b>garbling</b> against a malicious adversary. The new protocol is based on several new technical contributions and optimizations, for example making it possible to get distinct output to both parties with minimal overhead.

Save the additive poly(λ) factor, this is the best one could hope for. In contrast, all previous constructions of even single-use <b>garbled</b> circuits incurred a multiplicative poly(λ) blowup. Our techniques result in constructions of attribute-based and (single key secure) functional encryption schemes where the secret key of a circuit C consists of C itself, plus poly(λ) additional bits.

This notion considers <b>garbling</b> schemes in which part of the input is public, {{in the sense that it}} can be leaked by F ̂. – We present constructions of partial <b>garbling</b> schemes for (boolean and arithmetic) formulas and branching programs which take advantage of the public input to gain better efficiency. – We demonstrate the usefulness of the new notion by presenting applications to efficient attribute-based encryption, delegation, and secure computation. In each of these applications, we obtain either new schemes for larger classes of functions or efficiency improvements fromquadratic to linear. In particular, we obtain the first ABE scheme in bilinear groups for arithmetic formulas, as well as more efficient delegation schemes for boolean and arithmetic branching programs. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Standard {{constructions of}} <b>garbled</b> {{circuits}} provide only static security, meaning the input x {{is not allowed}} to depend on the <b>garbled</b> circuit F. But some applications—notably one-time programs (Goldwasser, Kalai, and Rothblum 2008) and secure outsourcing (Gennaro, Gentry, Parno 2010) — need adaptive security, where x may depend on F.

To this end we investigate the adaptive security of <b>garbling</b> schemes, an abstraction of Yao’s garbled-circuit technique that we recently introduced (Bellare, Hoang, Rogaway 2012). Building on that framework, we give definitions encompassing privacy, authenticity, and obliviousness, with either coarse-grained or finegrained adaptivity.

Actors and audience enter warmly into the illusion of the piece; and so especially are the former affected, that at Franconi's, where the battles of the Empire are represented, there is as regular gradation in the ranks of the mimic army as in the real imperial legions. After a man has served, with credit, for a certain number of years in the line, he is promoted to be an officer--an acting officer. If he conducts himself well, he may rise to be a Colonel or a General of Division; if ill, he is degraded to the ranks again; or, worst degradation of all, drafted into a regiment of Cossacks or Austrians. Cossacks is the lowest depth, however; nay, it is said that the men who perform these Cossack parts receive higher wages than the mimic grenadiers and old guard. They will not consent to be beaten every night, even in play; to be pursued in hundreds, by a handful of French; to fight against their beloved Emperor. Surely there is fine hearty virtue in this, and pleasant child-like simplicity.|$|E
40|$|Assuming solely the {{existence}} of one-way functions, we show how to construct <b>Garbled</b> RAM Programs (GRAM) where its size only depends on fixed polynomial in the security parameter times the program running time. We stress that we avoid converting the RAM programs into circuits. As an example, our techniques implies the first <b>garbled</b> binary search program (searching over sorted encrypted data stored in a cloud) which is poly-logarithmic in the data size instead of linear. Our result requires {{the existence}} of one-way function and enjoys the same non-interactive properties as Yao’s original <b>garbled</b> circuits...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A {{probabilistic}} {{procedure is}} suggested for the automatic correction of spelling and typing errors in printed English texts. The {{heart of the}} procedure is a probabilistic model for the generation of the <b>garbled</b> word from the correct word. The <b>garbler</b> can delete or insert symbols in the word or substitute one or more symbols by other symbols. An expression is derived for P(Y I X), the probability of generating a <b>garbled</b> word Y from a correct word X. The model is probabilistically consistent. Using the expression for P(Y I X), we can derive {{an estimate of the}} correct word from the <b>garbled</b> word Y so as to minimize the average probability of error in the decision. One of the important features of the expression P(Y I X) is that it can be com-puted recursively. Experiments conducted using the dictionary of 1025 most common English words indicate that the accuracy of correction by this scheme is substantially greater than that which can be obtained by other algorithms especially while dealing with <b>garbled</b> words derived from relatively short words of length less than 6...|$|R
