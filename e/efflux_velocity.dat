40|$|Present {{analysis}} is related with seabed erosion caused during docking and undocking maneuvering. Twin propellers without rudder were studied using a physical {{model with a}} fixed clearance distance and three different rotating velocities.

40|$|A {{mathematical}} model {{was developed to}} describe the heat transfer characteristics of a hot strand emerging into a surrounding coolant. A stable strand of constant <b>efflux</b> <b>velocity</b> is analyzed, with a constant (average) heat transfer coefficient on the sides and leading surface of the strand. After developing a suitable governing equation to provide an adequate description of the physical system, the dimensionless governing equation is solved with Laplace transform methods. The solution yields the temperature within the strand {{as a function of}} axial distance and time. Generalized results {{for a wide range of}} parameters are presented, and the relationship of the results and experimental observations is discussed...|$|E
40|$|A low-order panel code, VSAERO, {{was used}} to predict the {{aerodynamic}} characteristics of helicopter hub fairings. Since the simulation {{of this kind of}} bluff body by VSAERO was not documented before, the VSAERO solutions were correlated with experimental data to establish their validity. The validation process revealed that simulation of the aerodynamic environment around a hub fairing was sensitive to several modeling parameters. Some of these parameters are body and wake panels arrangement, streamwise and spanwise separation location, and the most prominent one-the wake modeling. Three wake models were used: regular wake, separated wake, and jet model. The regular wake is a wake with negligible thickness (thin wake). It is represented by a single vortex sheet. The separated wake and the jet model in the present application are wakes with finite thickness (thick wake). They consist of a vortex sheet enclosing a region of low-energy flow. The results obtained with the reqular wake were marginally acceptable for sharp-edged hub fairings. For all other cases under consideration, the jet model results correlated slightly better. The separated wake, which seemed to be the most appropriate model, caused the solution to diverge. While the regular wake was straight-forward to apply in simulations, the jet model was not. It requires the user to provide information about the doublet strength gradient on wake panels by guessing the <b>efflux</b> <b>velocities</b> at the wake shedding location. In summary, VSAERO neither predicts accurately the aerodynamic characteristics of helicopter hub fairings nor was cost effective...|$|R
40|$|A coaxial plasma {{accelerator}} {{driven by}} protracted pulses of current {{in the range}} of 10, 000 to 100, 000 A and synchronized mass flows from 1. 0 to 36 g/sec argon attains, after some tens of microseconds, a stable magnetoplasmadynamic acceleration mode. This 'quasi-steady' discharge form is characterized by constant terminal voltage and current, a diffuse, fixed current distribution within the discharge, and a steady plasma <b>efflux</b> at <b>velocities</b> of approximately 20 km/sec. Measured potential distributions reveal that the bulk of the arc voltage gradient, exclusive of the electrode falls, occurs within two diameters of the cathode, and is normal to it. The anode fall voltage varies inversely with local current density, implying substantially lower anode losses at higher power arc operation. Spectroscopic, potential, and velocity measurements indicate the existence of a characteristic mass flow rate for a given current, below which arc operation becomes erratic...|$|R
40|$|Low-speed wind-tunnel {{tests have}} been made on a body with a {{vertical}} jet efflux to uwestigate the interference loads arising from the lnteractlon between the mainstream and the efflux. As the ratio of free-stream velocity to Jet <b>efflux</b> <b>velocity</b> 1 s Increased from zero, the lift Increment due to the jet 1 s reduced by the interference and a nose-up pitching moment increment 1 s produced. Forward movement of the Jet exit uwreases the lift loss. If a wing 1 s fitted, an sppreaiable allevlatlon of the lift loss arises from the oirculatlon lift carrzed on the mng, but the nose-up pltchlng moments are larger. Replo~es R. A. E. Tech. Noto NO.

40|$|Flood {{propagation}} over {{urban areas}} can cause {{an interaction between}} the free-surface flow and large underground pipe networks used for storm drainage and sewage, causing outflows and inflows at the bed. The associated waves may collide {{with each other and}} the surface waves. In this thesis the shallow water equations are used to model this type of wave interaction over dry or wet beds with bathymetry gradients and friction terms. The proposed shallow water scheme is solved based on finite volume high-resolution Godunov-type methods. The solver is well-balanced and can accurately balance the source terms and flux-gradients for the steady-state solutions. The solver also utilises a new type of Riemann wave speed to provide depth-positive results over nearly dry beds and dry states. Additionally a new type of source term is introduced in the continuity equation to model pipe inflow and outflow conditions at bed connections. For the standard one-dimensional shallow water equations the numerical results are validated with analytical solutions or other reference solutions provided in the literature. This includes the incipient Riemann problems for nearly dry and dry-states, steady flow over a hump in a rectangular channel and the wave propagation problem. Eventually, the generation of dry bed in the middle, over discontinuous topography is considered. Close agreement is achieved between the shallow water scheme and analytical or reference solutions for the above test cases. For the shallow water problems with influx/efflux source terms comparisons are made with STAR-CD, a commercial Navier-Stokes solver for general fluid flow prediction. The shallow water model is first used to simulate vertical flows through finite gaps in the bed. Next, the interaction of the vertical flows with a dam-break flow is considered for both dry and wet beds. An efflux number, En, is defined based on the vertical <b>efflux</b> <b>velocity</b> and the gap length. A parameter study is undertaken to investigate the effect of the one-dimensional approximation of the present model, for a range of non-dimensional efflux numbers. It is found that the shallow flow model gives sensible predictions at all times provided En 0. 5. Dam break flow over an underground connecting pipe is also considered for the one-dimensional efflux problems. To solve two-dimensional problems the shallow water scheme uses the dimensional-splitting method which solves each one-dimensional Riemann problem in the x- and y-directions separately. The cross-derivative terms for second-order accuracy are incorporated by solving another Riemann problem in the orthogonal direction. For two-dimensional problems first the dam-break problems are considered over wet and dry beds. Then, flood propagation over complex terrain is demonstrated. Next, efflux discharge is modelled in isolation over a dry bed and then with dam-break interaction, comparing with STAR-CD results. Again very good agreement is shown between the two-dimensional shallow water model and STAR-CD for the efflux numbers of En< 0. 5. For modelling the inundation problem over an underground pipe network the solver is coupled with the general underground pipe network solver to calculate the efflux discharge as the flood waves pass through the pipe network. For analysing the pipe network with unknown effluxes an additional set of equations is incorporated into the solution of a general pipe network solver. The shallow water solver coupled to an underground pipe network is then used to simulate dam-break interaction with pipe networks with 9 and 25 nodes to demonstrate the versatility of the method.
