She also provided a foreword for Witchcraft: A Tradition Renewed, a book published in 1990 by Hale.

The other narratives focused on different themes: Mercedes' storyline <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> maturation into a queen, Velvet's story focused on resolving a mystery, while Cornelius' story narrative modeled after traditional fairy tales as a homage to the early PC game Marchen Veil.
