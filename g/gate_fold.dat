40|$|Kv 7 {{channels}} (KCNQ) {{represent a}} family of voltage-gated K+ channels which plays {{a prominent role in}} brain and cardiac excitability. Their physiological importance is underscored by the existence of mutations in human Kv 7 genes, leading to severe cardiovascular and neurological disorders such as the cardiac long QT syndrome and neonatal epilepsy. Kv 7 channels exhibit some structural and functional features that are distinct from other Kv channels. Notably, the Kv 7 C-terminus is long compared to other K+ channels and is endowed with characteristic structural domains, including coiled-coils, amphipatic α helices containing calmodulin-binding motifs and basic amino acid clusters. Here we provide a brief overview of current insights and as yet unsettled issues about the structural and functional attributes of the C-terminus of Kv 7 channels. Recent data indicate that the proximal half of the Kv 7 C-terminus associates with one calmodulin constitutively bound to each subunit. Epilepsy and long QT mutations located in this proximal region impair calmodulin binding and can affect channel <b>gating,</b> <b>folding</b> and trafficking. The distal half of the Kv 7 C-terminus directs tetramerization, employing tandem coiled-coils. Together, the data indicate that the Kv 7 C-terminal domain is a multimodular structure playing a crucial role in channel gating, assembly and trafficking as well as in scaffolding the channel complex with signalling proteins...|$|R

5000|$|A vinyl double {{album was}} produced, limited to 1,000 copies, {{the release of}} which was delayed several times and was {{released}} in late 2014, a complete year after the original release date. However, {{the release of the}} vinyl version of 'Life, Love & Hope' did not receive the blessing of Tom Scholz. According to Scholz via a facebook post of BOSTON's facebook page, “unacceptable vinyl master” was wrecked by “clicks, static and dropouts during many of the quiet segues between the cuts.” Scholz went on to explain, “Our summer tour was in full swing by the time I reviewed it, and there was no possibility of mastering again,” Scholz said. “I made the decision to reject the vinyl master — which meant all the effort to create it would be for nothing. Or so I thought.” [...] Despite intending to scrap the vinyl project completely due to the damaged master pressings, the two disc vinyl pressing was released on 180g virgin vinyl on December 12, 2014. While the release did not have Scholz's blessing, the <b>gate</b> <b>folds</b> of the LP do contain a message from Scholz, which reads, [...] "When I started recording this album over ten years ago, I never thought I'd be running mixes for vinyl in 2014!" [...] This suggests that while the master pressing did not have Scholz's blessing, he did intend to publish it eventually. The message goes on to say, [...] "Many of the pieces on this vinyl edition are entirely analogue, mastered directly from mixes made from 24 track to stereo tape, with no digital interface or editing. While this added many weeks to the production time, the natural sound of these track could only be accomplished by preserving the analogue waveform from instruments to vinyl." ...|$|R

Another kind of start is a standing start, where there are tapes or imaginary lines across the track behind which the horses either stand stationary or trot in circles in pairs in a specific pattern to hit the starting line as a group. This enables handicaps to be placed on horses (according to class) with several tapes, usually with 10 or 20 meters between tapes.

40|$|Surface {{and color}} codes are {{two forms of}} topological quantum error {{correction}} in two spatial dimensions with complementary properties. Surface codes have lower-depth error detection circuits and well-developed decoders to interpret and correct errors, while color codes have transversal Clifford gates and better code efficiency {{in the number of}} physical qubits needed to achieve a given code distance. A formal equivalence exists between color codes and folded surface codes, but it does not guarantee the transferability of any of these favorable properties. However, the equivalence does imply the existence of constant-depth circuit implementations of logical Clifford <b>gates</b> on <b>folded</b> surface codes. We achieve and improve this result by constructing two families of folded surface codes with transversal Clifford gates. This construction is presented generally for qudits of any dimension.
