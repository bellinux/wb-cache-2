In June 1937, several {{cities in the}} Dutch East Indies were visited by Amelia Earhart during her {{attempted}} circumnavigation. From Singapore, Earhart flew to Bandung, Surabaya, and Kupang before continuing her journey to Darwin, Australia. On 3 July 1938, KNILM began operations to Sydney, stopping at Darwin, Cloncurry, and Charleville. KNILM did not fly to the Netherlands, as the Amsterdam-Batavia weekly service was operated by KLM.|$|E
2500|$|Concourse C has 11 gates: C51–C61. All {{international}} arrivals, {{except for}} cities with United States border preclearance, pass through Concourse C as customs and immigration {{is located on}} its lower level. Even though this is the International Concourse, some domestic flights {{go in and out}} of Concourse C. [...] Gates C55, C57 and C59–C61 {{at the end of the}} concourse are designated to accommodate international traffic. [...] Gate C61 includes a dual jetway to accommodate widebody aircraft such as the Airbus A380, but it had been designed for British Airways' Boeing 747, and US Airways' Airbus A330. The concourse also includes a children's play area, and an exhibit commemorating Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, the long-running public television series that originated from Pittsburgh. Concourse C is utilized by American Airlines (<b>International</b> <b>Flights),</b> Condor Airlines (<b>International</b> <b>Flights),</b> Delta Air Lines (<b>International</b> <b>Flights),</b> Allegiant Air (<b>International</b> & Domestic <b>Flights),</b> Frontier Airlines (Domestic <b>Flights),</b> Porter Airlines (<b>International</b> <b>Flights),</b> Southern Airways Express, (Domestic <b>Flights),</b> Sunwing Airlines (<b>International</b> <b>Flights),</b> Swift Air (<b>International</b> <b>Flights)</b> and WOW air (<b>International</b> <b>Flights).</b>|$|R
50|$|Air travel can be {{separated}} into two general classifications: national/domestic and <b>international</b> <b>flights.</b> Flights from {{one point to}} another within the same country are called domestic flights. Flights from a point in one country to a point within a different country are known as <b>international</b> <b>flights.</b> Travelers can use domestic or <b>international</b> <b>flights</b> in either private or public travel.|$|R
50|$|Most <b>{{international}}</b> <b>flights</b> {{must go to}} São Paulo-Guarulhos International Airport or Rio de Janeiro-Galeão International Airport. Belo Horizonte is {{the main}} international airport outside Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo. A few go to Brasília, Recife, Natal, and just recently Fortaleza has accepted <b>international</b> <b>flights.</b> With South American integration, more airports {{can be expected to}} open to <b>international</b> <b>flights.</b>|$|R

5|$|Eilat Airport was {{established}} in 1949 by the Israel Air Force, following the 1948 Israeli War of Independence. During its early years, the airport aimed to establish a comprehensive set of connections to towns across the country, most notably with Tel Aviv and Haifa. Consequently, a regular route from Eilat to Lod Airport (now Ben Gurion International Airport) was started. Soon after, a route to Haifa Airport became operational. In December 1950, following their establishment, Arkia Israel Airlines became the largest domestic operator at Eilat Airport, taking {{the position of the}} former companies Eilata and Aviron. To this day, they retain this position. Later, in 1964 the runway was expanded to 1500m, and a passenger terminal was built. Five years later, the runway was further expanded increasing the length to 1900m. In 1975, Eilat Airport started to attract Scandinavian airlines. The first <b>international</b> <b>flight</b> arrival to Eilat, of the Danish airline, Sterling Airlines landed in this year. Since then, many international routes have been established directly linking Eilat with Europe, however, the airport is still unable to handle landings of large aircraft which have to fly to Uvda International Airport.|$|E
5|$|Jet Airways was {{incorporated}} as a {{limited liability company}} on 1 April 1992. It started operations as an air taxi operator on 5 May 1993 with a fleet of four leased Boeing 737-300 aircraft. The airline was granted a scheduled airline status on 14 January 1995. On 12 May 1994, all the shares were transferred to Tailwinds International, whose equity capital was held by Naresh Goyal (60%), Gulf Air (20%) and Kuwait Airways (20%). In October 1997, as per the directive of Ministry of Civil Aviation forbidding foreign investment in passenger airlines, Goyal {{took control of the}} entire company. The airline launched its first <b>international</b> <b>flight</b> in March 2004 from Chennai to Colombo. The company was listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange and became public company on 28 December 2004, with Goyal retaining 51% ownership of the stock.|$|E
5|$|KAL007's {{divergence}} {{prevented the}} aircraft from transmitting its position via shorter range {{very high frequency}} radio (VHF). It therefore requested KAL015, also en route to Seoul, to relay reports to air traffic control on its behalf. KAL007 requested KAL015 to relay its position three times. At 14:43UTC, KAL007 directly transmitted a change of {{estimated time of arrival}} for its next waypoint, NEEVA, to the <b>international</b> <b>flight</b> service station at Anchorage, but it did so over the longer range high frequency radio (HF) rather than VHF. HF transmissions are able to carry a longer distance than VHF, but are vulnerable to electromagnetic interference and static; VHF is clearer with less interference, and preferred by flight crews. The inability to establish direct radio communications to be able to transmit their position directly did not alert the pilots of KAL007 of their ever-increasing divergence and was not considered unusual by air traffic controllers. Halfway between Bethel and waypoint NABIE, KAL007 passed through the southern portion of the North American Aerospace Defense Command buffer zone. This zone is north of Romeo 20 and off-limits to civilian aircraft.|$|E
50|$|Being an {{international}} airport, all terminals {{are equipped with}} immigration processing facilities and security scanning for all passengers, including domestic passengers. The Satellite terminal handles most of the <b>international</b> <b>flights,</b> while the main terminal building's contact pier handles domestic traffic, regional <b>international</b> <b>flights</b> and <b>international</b> <b>flights</b> routed to other hubs within Malaysia. Malaysia Airlines operates from both terminals, and the main terminal building's contact pier is their preferred terminal for domestic flights. Conversely, low cost carriers such as Tigerair, Cebu Pacific and AirAsia group of airlines operate domestic and <b>international</b> <b>flights</b> out of klia2, the low-cost carrier terminal at KLIA.|$|R
50|$|Juanda International Airport has 2 terminals: Terminal 1 for all {{domestic}} flights, except Garuda Indonesia and Indonesia AirAsia flights, and Terminal 2 for all <b>international</b> <b>flights,</b> Garuda Indonesia and Indonesia AirAsia {{domestic and}} <b>international</b> <b>flights.</b>|$|R
500|$|In 2011, Iloilo International Airport {{serviced}} {{an average}} of 42 flights daily on four domestic routes. [...] At {{the time of its}} opening, the ATO believed that <b>international</b> <b>flights</b> out of and to the airport might not begin until 2008, although <b>international</b> passenger <b>flights</b> could commence once Iloilo International Airport meets ICAO standards. [...] A study was conducted on the feasibility of the airport serving <b>international</b> <b>flights,</b> and the CAAP announced that year that the airport met ICAO standards, allowing for <b>international</b> <b>flights</b> to land at the airport.|$|R
25|$|Under {{the terms}} of bankruptcy, the airline's <b>International</b> <b>Flight</b> Academy in Miami was {{permitted}} to remain open. It was established as an independent training organization beginning in 1992 under its current name, Pan Am <b>International</b> <b>Flight</b> Academy. The company began operating by using the flight simulation and type rating training center of the defunct Pan Am. In 2006, American Capital Strategies invested $58 million into the academy. Owned by the parent of Japanese airline All Nippon Airways as of October 2014, Pan Am <b>International</b> <b>Flight</b> Academy is the only surviving division of Pan American World Airways.|$|E
