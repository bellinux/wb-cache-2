5|$|Conservation of cacti {{can be in}} situ or ex situ. <b>In</b> <b>situ</b> <b>conservation</b> {{involves}} preserving habits through {{enforcement of}} legal protection {{and the creation of}} specially protected areas such as national parks and reserves. Examples of such protected areas in the United States include Big Bend National Park, Texas; Joshua Tree National Park, California; and Saguaro National Park, Arizona. Latin American examples include Parque Nacional del Pinacate, Sonora, Mexico and Pan de Azúcar National Park, Chile. Ex situ conservation aims to preserve plants and seeds outside their natural habitats, often with the intention of later reintroduction. Botanical gardens {{play an important role in}} ex situ conservation; for example, seeds of cacti and other succulents are kept in long-term storage at the Desert Botanical Garden, Arizona.|$|E
5|$|Captive {{populations of}} both ruffed lemur species exist in American and European zoos, {{representing}} a safeguard against extinction. In the United States, captive breeding is {{managed by the}} Species Survival Plan (SSP), a program developed by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA). Although the populations are very limited in their genetic diversity, these species thrive in captivity, making them an ideal candidate for reintroduction into protected habitat, if it is available. Although reintroduction {{is seen as a}} last resort among conservationists, a combination of <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> <b>conservation</b> efforts, such as legal protection, public education, the spread of sustainable livelihoods, and reforestation offer hope for ruffed lemurs. In the meantime, reintroductions offer conservation research opportunities and allow the limited genetic diversity maintained by the SSP to improve the genetic diversity of dwindling Malagasy ruffed lemur populations.|$|E

The results showed a remarkable differentiation between the two populations; that from the Senkele Wildlife Sanctuary showed more genetic diversity than the one from the Nechisar National Park. Another revelation was that the translocation of the individuals from the Senkele Wildlife Sanctuary in 1974 had not made a significant contribution to the gene pool of the Nechisar National Park. Additionally, the Swayne hartebeest populations were compared with a large red hartebeest population, and both subspecies were found to have a high degree of genetic variation. The study advocated <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> <b>conservation</b> of the Swayne's hartebeest and a renewed attempt at its translocation in order to conserve genetic diversity and increase its population size in both the protected areas.|$|E
40|$|The study compares <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> seed <b>conservation</b> trends <b>in</b> two crop categories, ‘pulses’ {{crops and}} ‘preferred’ crops, in two regions of central India. It finds that <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> {{agrobiodiversity}} (seed) <b>conservation</b> efforts suffer statistically {{significant decrease in}} crops for which varieties ‘improved’ by the private or government sector are made available to farmers. This trend calls to question the seed replacement policy adopted by several governments, notably in developing countries, as also the push to promote intellectual property protection for formally developed varieties across the globe, and its potential impact on <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> agrobiodiversity <b>conservation.</b> The overarching approach adopted by the study was multi-disciplinary and incorporated a mixed-methods research design where the qualitative and quantitative segments received equal status {{at the time of}} data interpretation. The quantitative data used for the study derives from extensive farmer surveys conducted in the two regions using the stratified random sampling method. The results provide evidence of significantly higher <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> seed <b>conservation</b> trends <b>in</b> the ‘pulses’ crop category than in the ‘preferred’ crop category. The qualitative data collected via concurrently and sequentially conducted interviews further enriches the findings from the quantitative study and suggests that in regions where improved crop varieties are introduced, farmers have a significantly lower inclination to engage <b>in</b> <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> seed <b>conservation,</b> even for ‘pulses’ crops. From a legal and policy perspective, these findings strongly suggest the need to involve regional agricultural extension officers (RAEOs) in the effort to promote <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> agrobiodiversity <b>conservation.</b> They also suggest that in the absence of such efforts, the provisions of the Indian Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers’ Rights Act, 2001 (the PPV&FR Act) and similar laws that permit farmer level seed saving and conservation, may eventually lose their significance...|$|R

2500|$|Cryoconservation {{of animal}} genetic {{resources}} is a strategy wherein samples of animal genetic materials are preserved cryogenically. Animal genetic resources, {{as defined by the}} Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, are [...] "those animal species that are used, or may be used, for the production of food and agriculture, and the populations within each of them. These populations within each species can be classified as wild and feral populations, landraces and primary populations, standardised breeds, selected lines, varieties, strains and any conserved genetic material; all of which are currently categorized as Breeds." [...] Genetic materials that are typically cryogenically preserved include sperm, oocytes, embryos and somatic cells. Cryogenic facilities are called gene banks and can vary greatly in size usually according to the economic resources available. They must be able to facilitate germplasm collection, processing, freezing, and long term storage, all in a hygienic and organized manner. Gene banks must maintain a precise database and make information and genetic resources accessible to properly facilitate cryoconservation. Cryoconservation is an ex situ conservation strategy that often coexists alongside <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> <b>conservation</b> to protect and preserve livestock genetics. Cryoconservation of livestock genetic resources is primarily done in order to preserve the genetics of populations of interest, such as indigenous breeds, also known as local or minor breeds. Material may be stored because individuals shared specific genes and phenotypes that may be of value or have potential value for researchers or breeders. Therefore, one of the main goals remains preserving the gene pool of local breeds that may be threatened. Indigenous livestock genetics are commonly threatened by factors such as globalization, modernization, changes in production systems, inappropriate introduction of major breeds, genetic drift, inbreeding, crossbreeding, climate change, natural disasters, disease, cultural changes, and urbanization. Indigenous livestock are critical to sustainable agricultural development and food security, due to their: adaptation to environment and endemic diseases, indispensable part in local production systems, social and cultural significance, and importance to local rural economies. The genetic resources of minor breeds have value to the local farmers, consumers of the products, private companies and investors interested in crossbreeding, breed associations, governments, those conducting research and development, and non-governmental organizations. Therefore, efforts have been made by national governments and non-governmental organizations, such as the Livestock Conservancy, to encourage conservation of livestock genetics through cryoconservation, as well as through other ex situ and in situ strategies. Cryogenic specimens of livestock genetic resources can be preserved and used for extended periods of time. This advantage makes cryoconservation beneficial particularly for threatened breeds who have low breed populations. Cryogenically preserved specimens can be used to revive breeds that are endangered or extinct, for breed improvement, crossbreeding, research and development. However, cryoconservation can be an expensive strategy and requires long term hygienic and economic commitment for germplasms to remain viable. Cryoconservation can also face unique challenges based on the species, as some species have a reduced survival rate of frozen germplasm.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Tasmania has {{a strong}} record of {{successful}} <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> plant <b>conservation</b> but {{there will always be}} a role for the integration of various ex situ measures into a plant conservation program due to pressure by threatening processes on wild populations. This paper replaces a 15 year old strategy for ex <b>situ</b> <b>conservation</b> <b>in</b> Tasmania. Progress <b>in</b> ex <b>situ</b> measures for Tasmanian plants is described and broadly evaluated against the previous strategy. Rare and threatened species are considered to be a high priority group for resources if intensive management is required.

40|$|Climate {{change is}} {{predicted}} to have far-reaching deleterious impacts worldwide; agriculture in particular {{is expected to be}} effected by significant loss of suitable land and crop yields in the world’s most populous and poorest regions. Crop wild relatives (CWR) are a rich source of underutilised genetic diversity which could help to mitigate climate change for agriculture through breeding new resilient varieties. However, CWR are under-conserved and threatened in the wild. This thesis researches and develops systematic methodologies to advance knowledge and support action on <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> CWR <b>conservation</b> at the global level. Methods included developing a global inventory of CWR associated with crops important for food security worldwide, species distribution modelling, climate change analysis, <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> gap analysis, reserve planning and prioritisation, and, examining the congruence of CWR distributions with regions of high biodiversity and crop diversity. The methods described here can be applied to CWR at both the national and regional level to ensure robust <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> CWR <b>conservation.</b> A principal success of this research is the global CWR inventory, which has been used in several national strategies and as the basis of a major ex situ germplasm collection mission worldwide...|$|R

Comparative study of <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> soil moisture <b>conservation</b> techniques in bench terraces and unterraced field with maize crop had been conducted from June 2007 to October 2007.

Within the bench terraced field compartment bund and ridges and furrows increased soil moisture by 19. 5 % and 27. 9 % higher than plain bed. In terms of efficiency of moisture conservation, ridges and furrows performed well with 85. 8 % followed by compartment bund with 75. 9 % in terraced field. Unterraced field conserved moisture very poorly with 13. 9 % efficiency inferring importance of bench terraces for soil moisture conservation.

40|$|Captive {{breeding}} {{has been}} suggested {{as a method of}} conserving many threatened vertebrates, and is increasingly being proposed as a valuable conservation strategy for invertebrates. Potential genetic problems associated with ex <b>situ</b> <b>conservation</b> are widely recognized. but a further issue has received less attention: the possibility that populations will undergo adaptation to the captive environment, rendering them less well adapted to survival in the wild. We investigated six traits related to dispersal and reproduction in a culture of the large white butterfly Pieris brassicae (L.), that had been captive for c. 100 - 150 generations, and in recently wild stock reared simultaneously in a common environment. Individuals in the captive culture were heavier, with smaller wings and lower wing aspect ratios. Females from the captive culture laid many more eggs in cage experiments, and had higher ovary mass at the time of peak egg production. These differences are consistent with adaptation to captive conditions. Over time, similar evolutionary changes may affect invertebrates reared <b>in</b> ex <b>situ</b> <b>conservation</b> programmes, decreasing the likelihood that these species can be re-established in the wild. Although the timescale over which most vertebrates are likely to adapt to captivity is longer, and the traits involved will be different, invertebrates like P. brassicae may also provide a model of potential problems <b>in</b> long-term ex <b>situ</b> <b>conservation</b> programmes for both invertebrates and vertebrates.
