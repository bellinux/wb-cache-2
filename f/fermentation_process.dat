5|$|On April 5, 1952, {{biochemist}} Durey Peterson and microbiologist Herbert Murray at Upjohn {{published the}} first report of a <b>fermentation</b> <b>process</b> for the microbial 11α-oxygenation of steroids in a single step (by common molds of the order Mucorales). Their <b>fermentation</b> <b>process</b> could produce 11α-hydroxyprogesterone or 11α-hydroxycortisone from progesterone or Compound S, respectively, which could then by further chemical steps be converted to cortisone or 11β-hydroxycortisone (cortisol).|$|E
5|$|The {{purpose of}} brewing is {{to convert the}} starch source into a sugary liquid called wort and to convert the wort into the {{alcoholic}} beverage known as beer in a <b>fermentation</b> <b>process</b> effected by yeast.|$|E
5|$|Louis Pasteur {{demonstrated}} in 1859 {{that the growth}} of microorganisms causes the <b>fermentation</b> <b>process,</b> and that this growth is not due to spontaneous generation. (Yeasts and moulds, commonly associated with fermentation, are not bacteria, but rather fungi.) Along with his contemporary Robert Koch, Pasteur was an early advocate of the germ theory of disease.|$|E
40|$|The book presents, in a {{systematic}} manner, the optimal controls under different mathematical models in <b>fermentation</b> <b>processes.</b> Variant mathematical models – i. e., those for multistage systems; switched autonomous systems; time-dependent and state-dependent switched systems; multistage time-delay systems and switched time-delay systems – for fed-batch <b>fermentation</b> <b>processes</b> are proposed and the theories and algorithms of their optimal control problems are studied and discussed. By putting forward novel methods and innovative tools, the book provides a state-of-the-art and comprehensive systematic treatment of optimal control problems arising in <b>fermentation</b> <b>processes.</b> It not only develops nonlinear dynamical system, optimal control theory and optimization algorithms, but can also help to increase productivity and provide valuable reference material on commercial <b>fermentation</b> <b>processes...</b>|$|R
50|$|The journal {{focuses on}} applied {{fundamentals}} {{and application of}} engineering principles to biology-based problems. Initially, <b>fermentation</b> <b>processes,</b> as well as mixing phenomena and aeration {{with an emphasis on}} agricultural or food science applications were the major focus. The scale up of antibiotics from <b>fermentation</b> <b>processes</b> was also an active topic of publication.|$|R
30|$|Medium {{composition}} and growth strategies play {{the most important}} role in optimizing high density-cell <b>fermentation</b> <b>processes,</b> as product quality insurance and yield of product are the key issues for large scale <b>fermentations.</b> <b>Process</b> optimization and scale up are aimed to maintain optimum and homogeneous reaction conditions and consequently to minimize stress exposure and enhance metabolic accuracy.|$|R
5|$|Microorganisms {{are used}} in a <b>fermentation</b> <b>process</b> to make yoghurt, cheese, curd, kefir, ayran, xynogala, {{and other types of}} food. Fermentation {{cultures}} provide flavor and aroma, and inhibit undesirable organisms. They are used to leaven bread, and to convert sugars to alcohol in wine and beer. Microorganisms {{are used in}} brewing, wine making, baking, pickling and other food-making processes.|$|E
5|$|In winemaking, fruit sugars are {{converted}} into alcohol by a <b>fermentation</b> <b>process.</b> If the must formed by pressing the fruit {{has a low}} sugar content, additional sugar may be added to raise the alcohol content of the wine in a process called chaptalization. In the production of sweet wines, fermentation may be halted before it has run its full course, leaving behind some residual sugar that gives the wine its sweet taste.|$|E
5|$|Bute died in 1900 and his widow, the Marchioness, {{was given}} a life {{interest}} in Castell Coch; during her mourning, she and her daughter, Lady Margaret Crichton-Stuart, occupied the castle and made occasional visits thereafter. Production in the castle vineyards ceased during the First World War due to the shortages of the sugar needed for the <b>fermentation</b> <b>process,</b> and in 1920 the vineyards were uprooted. John, the 4th Marquess, acquired the castle in 1932 but made little use of it. He also began to reduce the family's investments in South Wales. The coal trade had declined after 1918 and industry had suffered during the depression of the 1920s; by 1938, {{the great majority of}} the family interests, including the coal mines and docks, had been sold off or nationalised.|$|E

40|$|Most known {{natural and}} {{industrial}} food <b>fermentation</b> <b>processes</b> {{are driven by}} either simple or complex communities of microorganisms. Obviously, these fermenting microbes will not only interact with the fermentable substrate but also with each other. These microbe–microbe interactions are complex but thought to be crucial for obtaining the desired product characteristics. Microbial interactions are mediated {{through a variety of}} molecular and physiological mechanisms. Examples of interaction mechanisms which {{have an impact on the}} outcome of food <b>fermentation</b> <b>processes</b> will be discussed. Finally, the technological and scientific challenges associated with the production and propagation of complex mixed starter cultures are briefly addressed. Research on the composition and functionality of complex microbial consortia is gaining momentum and will open new avenues for controlling and improving food <b>fermentation</b> <b>processes,</b> and developing new applications for mixed cultures...|$|R

25|$|In late 2012, a new {{discovery}} {{made the}} alternative fuel butanol {{more attractive to}} the biofuel industry. Scientist Hao Feng found a method that could significantly {{reduce the cost of}} the energy involved in making butanol. His team was able to isolate the butanol molecules during the <b>fermentation</b> <b>process</b> so they do not kill the organisms, and produces 100% or more butanol. After the <b>fermentation</b> <b>process,</b> they used a process called cloud point separation to recover the butanol which used 4 times less energy.|$|E

40|$|In {{this chapter}} we {{describe}} a software tool for modelling <b>fermentation</b> <b>processes,</b> the FerMoANN, which allows researchers in biology and biotechnology areas {{to access the}} potential of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) for this task. The FerMoANN is tested and validated using two <b>fermentation</b> <b>processes,</b> an Escherichia coli recombinant protein production {{and the production of}} a secreted protein with Saccharomyces cerevisiae in fed-batch reactors. The application to these two case studies, tested for different configurations of feedforward ANNs, illustrate the usefulness of these structures, when trained according to a supervised learning paradigm...|$|R
50|$|In <b>fermentation</b> <b>processes,</b> {{such as in}} the {{production}} of xanthan gum, nutrients are needed as a food source by the fermentation organism. Typical nutrients used in <b>fermentation</b> <b>processes</b> are: soybean proteins, and maize (corn) or wheat starches. However, products made by fermentation, such as gums, are not composed of the source nutrients, these are metabolized during fermentation. Then, after the fermentation step, the gums are recovered and purified, dried and milled. Nutrients are not transferred directly to the final products, although unavoidable residues of the process may be present.|$|R
25|$|In Latin America, chicha {{is still}} widely {{produced}} {{by women and}} consumed daily by adults and children, as it typically has a low alcohol content. In Ecuador women harvest yucca, boil the roots, pound it into a paste and then chew the paste, {{in much the same}} way as their ancestors did, to break down the starches and begin the <b>fermentation</b> <b>process.</b> Peruvian women make their version of chicha using the same method, but with corn. In Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay, among Amazonian Indians, chicha, made from corn, or algarroba beer made from carob seed, as well as beer produced from mixing corn or manioc with apples, melons, papaya, pears, pumpkin, quince, strawberries and sweet potatoes are brewed by women. Bolivian women make beer from roasted barley, which is then chewed to begin the <b>fermentation</b> <b>process</b> and is served daily as a dietary supplement.|$|E
25|$|A more {{reliable}} method of determinating the alcoholic strength {{is to use}} scientific testing equipment, such as an alcoholmeter or hydrometer. A hydrometer is used {{during and after the}} <b>fermentation</b> <b>process</b> to determine the potential alcohol percent of the moonshine, whereas an alcoholmeter is used after the product has been distilled to determine the volume percent or proof.|$|E
25|$|After {{the grapes}} destined for Vin Santo are {{harvested}} in September or October, they {{are laid out}} on straw mats, often under rafters or staircases. They are kept in warm, well ventilated rooms that allow the moisture in the grape to evaporate. This process of desiccation allows the sugars in the grape to be more concentrated. The longer the grapes are allowed to dry and desiccate, the higher the resulting residual sugar levels {{will be in the}} wine. Depending on the style of wine desired, the grapes may be crushed and the <b>fermentation</b> <b>process</b> started after a few weeks or not till late March. Producers may use a starter culture of yeast known as a madre that includes a small amount of finished Vin Santo from previous years production. It is believed that this older wine can help jump start the <b>fermentation</b> <b>process</b> and also add complexity to the wine.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} optimal control {{algorithms}} for two E. coli fed-batch fermentations are developed. Fed-batch <b>fermentation</b> <b>processes</b> of E. coli strain MC 4110 and E. coli strain BL 21 (DE 3) pPhyt 109 are considered. Simple material balance models {{are used to}} describe the E. coli <b>fermentation</b> <b>processes.</b> The optimal feed rate control of a primary metabolite process is studied and a biomass production is used as an example. The optimization of the considered fed-batch <b>fermentation</b> <b>processes</b> is done using the calculus of variations to determine the optimal feed rate profiles. The problem is formulated as a free final time problem where the control objective is to maximize biomass {{at the end of the}} process. The obtained optimal feed rate profiles consist of sequences of maximum and minimum feed rates. The resulting profiles are used for optimization of the E. coli fed-batch fermentations. Presented simulations show a good efficiency of the developed optimal feed rate profiles...|$|R

25|$|Vitamin C is {{produced}} from glucose by two main routes. The Reichstein process, {{developed in the}} 1930s, uses a single pre-fermentation followed by a purely chemical route. The modern two-step <b>fermentation</b> <b>process,</b> originally developed in China in the 1960s, uses additional fermentation to replace part of the later chemical stages. Both processes yield approximately 60% vitamin C from the glucose feed.|$|E
25|$|Worker bees combine pollen, {{honey and}} glandular {{secretions}} and {{allow it to}} ferment in the comb to make bee bread. The <b>fermentation</b> <b>process</b> releases additional nutrients from the pollen and can produce antibiotics and fatty acids which inhibit spoilage. Bee bread is eaten by nurse bees (younger workers) who then produce the protein-rich royal jelly needed by the queen and developing larvae in their hypopharyngeal glands.|$|E
