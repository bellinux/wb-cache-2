30|$|The {{processes}} of solution in, and exsolution from, formation water influence the component content {{of natural gas}} by contrasting the relative contents of components before the natural gas dissolves in water and those after exsolving from water under different conditions of high temperatures and pressures. Compared with the composition of original natural gas, the relative content of methane and nitrogen increased after the natural gas dissolved in water. The increase of nitrogen content exceeds that of methane, but the content of ethane, propane, pentane etc reduced. At the same temperature and with pressure increasing the content of methane increased and that of <b>heavier</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> reduced. At the same pressure the content of methane increased quickly from 90 °C to 120 °C, {{and the content of}} <b>heavier</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> reduced. But at even higher temperatures, the increase of methane slowed down and the content of <b>heavier</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> increased slightly. At the same temperature and different pressures, <b>heavier</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> reduced much more with increasing carbon atom number, while with temperature increasing the content difference of <b>heavier</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> reduced.
