50|$|He {{returned}} to France in 1952 {{and once again}} took up the position of an intern with Marcel Bessis. It was during this time that Dausset conducted his first official research. With Bessis, Dausset discovered the first antigen-presenting leucocyte, {{but it was only}} officially described in 1958. Between the years 1952 and 1957 he collaborated with many researchers such as Gilbert Malinvaud and Jacques and Monique Colombani.From 1952 to 1957, majority of Dausset’s time went into developing techniques and developing further ways of confirming the presence of certain antibodies. He was made the head of research at Professor Georges Marchal’s <b>immunohematology</b> laboratory in the Broussais Hospital. During this time, Dausset performed blood transfusions between a voluntary donor and patients in order to further his research in the field of immune responses in the body. He was testing the ability of the antigen-presenting leucocytes in the recipient’s body, which came originally from the donor’s blood. In 1958, Dausset discovered an antibody called MAC which was a leuco-aggluntinate; the abbreviation MAC actually stands for the initials of the names of the donors whose blood Dausset and his colleagues had used during the research.From 1960 to 1965 Dausset worked primarily on improving organ transplantation techniques and the mechanisms involved in enhancing the body’s ability to accept the new tissue. To do this, Dausset again used the blood of voluntary donors and patients to see what differences lay in the blood of the two individuals and how to minimize these differences.1965 was a crucial year for research. There was an intense competition amongst the researchers of the <b>immunohematology</b> field as everyone was on the brink of making a major discovery in the genetic and transplantation research. During this time, Dausset worked with Paul Ivany in Prague and they used leuco-agglutination and lymphocyte toxicity techniques to make some very significant discoveries. They discovered the Hu-1 antigen and the H-2 antigen.|$|E

With its technical expertise in separations chemistry, Bio-Rad was now positioned {{to contribute to a}} developing clinical diagnostics market. With the T-4 test, Bio-Rad recognized that laboratory diagnostics was evolving into “applied biochemistry”, in which the knowledge and techniques of research are applied to medicine and diagnostics. It was a turning point for the industry—and the company. [...] Bio-Rad expanded into the field of analytical and measuring instrument systems through internal research and development efforts and acquisitions in the late 1970s and 1980s. In 1999, Bio-Rad purchased Pasteur Sanofi Diagnostics. This strengthened the company’s position in the HIV and infectious disease diagnostic product market. In 2000 and 2004, Bio-Rad divested its semiconductor, optoelectronic metrology, and confocal microscopy product lines. In late 2007, Bio-Rad acquired Switzerland-based DiaMed Holding AG, enhancing Bio-Rad’s position in the <b>immunohematology</b> market. In January 2013, Bio-Rad purchased AbD Serotec, a division of MorphoSys AG.

40|$|In a {{previous}} report, we investigated {{the capability of}} commercially available <b>immunohematology</b> tests based on gel technology to add useful information for the diagnosis of autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA). In this report, we analyzed the same casuistic to find useful information {{on the importance of}} different <b>immunohematology</b> tests for the AIHA diagnosis, but using the artificial neural network (ANN) analysis. We studied 588 samples with a positive direct antiglobulin test (DAT), of which 52 samples came from patients with AIHA. The samples were analyzed with the ANN using the multilayer perceptron with the backpropagation algorithm. Using the ANN in the observed data set, the predictive value for the presence of AIHAs was 94. 7 %. The rate of DAT-positive cases that were not AIHA and that were correctly classified was 99. 4 %. The receiver operating curve area for the model was 0. 99. The independent variable importance analysis found that the gel centrifugation test anti-IgG titer was an important contributor to the network performance, but other variables such as the IgG subclasses can also be considered important. The use of the ANN permitted us to identify <b>immunohematology</b> tests that were "hidden" with the common statistical models used previously. This was the case for the IgG subclasses. However, it is very likely that the information given to the network from those tests is quantitative rather than qualitative...|$|E

DAT strength had the strongest correlation with AIHA diagnosis (odds ratio [OR], 23), followed by anti-IgG titer 300 (OR, 8. 4), anti-IgG titer 1, 000 (OR, 10. 5), and C 3 d agglutination strength (OR, 1. 7). Decision tree analysis revealed that DAT strength and anti-IgG titer higher than 100 were the best predictors of AIHA. Multidimensional scanning analysis found a high grade of similarity among DAT strength, anti-IgG titer, and IgG strength in the AIHA samples. This observation was not detected in DAT-positive samples from patients without AIHA.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This study {{aimed at}} {{identifying}} associations between {{the participation of}} transfusion services in <b>immunohematology</b> external quality control programs and their accuracy in <b>immunohematology</b> testing and adaptation to technical and legal operational procedures. METHODS: From 2007 to 2009, a cross-sectional {{study was conducted in}} 219 transfusion services of the State of Minas Gerais who participated in this investigation by responding to a questionnaire and conducting a proficiency test comprising: ABO and RhD phenotyping, irregular RBC antibody screening and cross-matching. Frequencies and bivariate analysis followed by binary logistic regression were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Transfusion services who participated in external quality control programs (32. 4 %) and those that did not (67. 6 %) obtained worrying error percentages in proficiency tests which may significantly increase blood transfusion risks. Shortfalls related to the establishment of protocols, standards and internal quality control were also significant. On comparing the two groups, transfusion services that participated in these programs had a 2. 35 times higher chance of correct results in the proficiency panel testing, a 3. 16 higher chance of having transfusional records and a 2. 81 higher chance of performing preventive maintenance of equipment.

40|$|International audienceAt present, 33 {{blood groups}} {{representing}} over 300 antigens are listed by the International Society of Blood Transfusion (ISBT). Most of them {{result from a}} single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the corresponding DNA sequence, i. e. approx. 200 SNPs. In <b>immunohematology</b> laboratories, blood group determination is classically carried out by serological tests, but these have some limitations, mostly in term of multiplexing and throughput. Yet, {{there is a growing}} need of extended blood group typing to prevent alloimmunization in transfused patients and transfusion accidents. The knowledge of the molecular bases of blood groups allows the use of molecular biology methods within <b>immunohematology</b> laboratories. Numerous assays focused on blood group genotyping were developed and described during the last 10 years. Some of them were real biochips or biosensors while others were more characterized by the particular molecular biology techniques they used, but all were intending to produce multiplex analysis. PCR techniques are most of the time used followed by an analytical step involving a DNA biosensor, biochip or analysis system (capillary electrophoresis, mass spectrometry). According to the method used, the test can then be classified as low-, medium- or high-throughput. There are several companies which developed platforms dedicated to blood group genotyping able to analyze simultaneously various SNPs or variants associated with blood group systems. This review summarizes the characteristics of each molecular biology method and medium-/high-throughput platforms dedicated to the blood group genotyping...|$|E
