Later in the storyline, Watson encounters a Cenobite with shards of glass in his head in a manner similar to Pinhead, and later experiences flashbacks/flashforwards of other Cenobites, including Pinhead.|$|R
50|$|In Germany, {{military}} service was mandatory for adult males until 2011. Instead of <b>joining</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>for</b> six months full-time, {{one of the}} alternatives was to join a non-combatant volunteer organisation within the German Katastrophenschutz (disaster relief) or Zivilschutz (civil defense) {{for a minimum of}} four years (this is calculated so that although serving far less time every week, in the end the number of served hours was about the same). The THW was one of those organisations, as were volunteer fire brigades and various organisations engaged in emergency medical service.|$|R

5000|$|The NDSM ranks {{eleventh}} out of twenty-nine in {{the order}} of precedence of service medals. There is no time requirement for the medal's issuance, meaning that someone who <b>joins</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>for</b> simply a few days, and then receives an entry level discharge, would technically be entitled to the NDSM; in practice, however, military clerks will not add the NDSM on a DD Form 214 if the service member performed duty for less than 90 days from the completion of their initial entry training. This accounts for the medal's omission from a large number of [...] "uncharacterized" [...] and [...] "entry level" [...] separation documents. Veterans who have this medal so omitted may apply to <b>the</b> <b>military</b> service departments to have the NDSM added to records via a DD Form 215.|$|R

50|$|Wright {{was born}} on 6 March 1921 in Hammersmith, London, England.

50|$|The {{answer was}} found in calling on {{civilian}} volunteers to act as airplane spotters. With {{the help of the}} American Legion, volunteers were organized in May 1941 into the Aircraft Warning Service, the civilian arm of the Army's Ground Observer Corps. On the east coast, the AWS was {{under the auspices of the}} Army Air Force's 1st Interceptor Command (later First Fighter Command or I Fighter Command) based at Mitchell Field, New York. On the west coast, the AWS was under the auspicies of the 4th Interceptor Command (Later Fourth Fighter Command or IV Fighter Command) based in Riverside, California. On both coasts, observation posts, information centers and filter centers were established. The United States entered World War II on Dec 7, 1941. Many of those who could not <b>join</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>for</b> whatever reason were recruited to the AWS. Statistically, this led to a preponderance of women, apparent in the surviving material, but seemingly little recognized.|$|R

His treatment was harsh; he weighed only 42 kg when he was freed after the war.|$|R
50|$|Although an {{undergraduate}} degree {{is not a}} pre-requisite for Officer training, the majority of potential Officers will have attended University before <b>joining</b> <b>the</b> Armed Forces. At some universities there may be the option for people to join either a University Royal Naval Unit, a University Officer Training Corps (UOTC) or a University Air Squadron; which are designed to introduce students {{to life in the}} Forces and show them the careers that are available. People sponsored under the Defence Technical Undergraduate Scheme will <b>join</b> one of <b>the</b> four Support Units attached to universities participating in DTUS. There is a requirement for bursars of DTUS to <b>join</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>for</b> 3 years after completion of their degree, there no requirement for students of any other organisation to <b>join</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> after they finish their degree programs; and the great majority have no further contact with the armed forces. Although service with these organisations may give some initial benefit to cadets attending <b>the</b> <b>military</b> colleges/academies, <b>the</b> next stage of the officer training programs assumes no prior military experience/knowledge, and those that did not partake in military activities at university are not disadvantaged.|$|R

Rowland also inherited an adjoining estate, Whitehouse in Turnastone. The combined estates stretched along the Golden Valley, on {{the west bank of the}} River Dore, from Peterchurch to Bacton.|$|R
5000|$|Herbert {{signed with}} his {{hometown}} Tigers after attending Detroit Central Catholic High School.

Herbert was tagged with the loss, although he registered an eight-inning complete game.

50|$|The Irish in the British Armed Forces {{refers to}} the history of Irish people serving in the British Armed Forces (including the British Army, the Royal Navy, the Royal Air Force and other elements). Ireland was ruled as part of the United Kingdom from 1800-1922 and during this time in {{particular}} many Irishmen fought in the British Army. Different social classes <b>joined</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>for</b> various reasons, including the Anglo-Irish officers who thoroughly identified with the British Empire, while others, typically poorer Irish Catholics did so to feed their families or seeking adventure. Many Irishmen and members of the Irish diaspora in Britain and also Ulster-Scots served in both World War I and World War II as part of the British forces. However, especially since the advent of Irish independence and The Troubles, the topic of enlistment in the British forces has been controversial for the Irish at home, but does still occur. Since partition, Irish citizens have continued {{to have the right to}} serve in the British Army. Since 2007, when troops finally withdrew from the streets of Northern Ireland, the number of Irish citizens joining has increased, reaching its highest levels since World War II.|$|E

5|$|The {{majority}} of middle-class and educated Khmers had grown {{weary of the}} prince and welcomed the change of government.

In one incident at Kampong Cham on 29 March, however, an enraged crowd killed Lon Nol's brother, Lon Nil, tore out his liver, and cooked and ate it. An estimated 40,000 peasants then began to march on the capital to demand Sihanouk's reinstatement. They were dispersed, with many casualties, by contingents of the armed forces.|$|R
