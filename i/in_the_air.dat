5|$|Overclaiming in {{aerial warfare}} is not uncommon. During the Battle of Britain (and, indeed, {{the rest of}} the Second World War), both sides claimed to have shot down and {{destroyed}} more enemy aircraft on the ground and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> than they had in reality. RAF Fighter Command claimed 78 German aircraft shot down on 13 August 1940. Another source states that official RAF claims amounted to 64. Actual German losses amounted to 47–48 aircraft destroyed and 39 severely damaged. Conversely, the Luftwaffe claimed to have destroyed 70 Hawker Hurricanes and Spitfires <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> and a further 18 Blenheim bombers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> alone. This was an exaggeration of 700 percent. Another 84 RAF fighters were claimed on the ground.
