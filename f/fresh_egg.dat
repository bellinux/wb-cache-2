2500|$|Fresh pastas do not {{expand in}} size after cooking; therefore, [...] of pasta {{are needed to}} serve four people generously. <b>Fresh</b> <b>egg</b> pasta is {{generally}} cut into strands of various widths and thicknesses depending on which pasta is to be made (e.g. fettuccine, pappardelle, and lasagne). It is best served with meat, cheese, or vegetables to create ravioli, tortellini, and cannelloni. <b>Fresh</b> <b>egg</b> pasta {{is well known in}} the Piedmont region and Emilia Romagna region in North Italy. In this area, dough is only made out of egg yolk and flour resulting in a very refined flavour and texture. This pasta is often served simply with butter sauce and thinly sliced truffles that are native to this region. In other areas, such as Apulia fresh pasta can be made without eggs. The only ingredients needed to make the pasta dough are semolina flour and water, which is often shaped into orecchiette or cavatelli. Fresh pasta for cavatelli is also popular in other places including Sicily. However, the dough is prepared differently: it is made of flour and ricotta cheese instead.|$|E
2500|$|Closed containers, such as eggs, can explode when heated in a {{microwave}} oven due to the increased pressure from steam. Intact <b>fresh</b> <b>egg</b> yolks outside the shell will also explode, as a result [...] of superheating. Insulating plastic foams of all types generally contain closed air pockets, and are generally not recommended for use in {{a microwave}}, as the air pockets explode and the foam (which can be toxic if consumed) may melt. Not all plastics are microwave-safe, and some plastics absorb microwaves {{to the point that they}} may become dangerously hot.|$|E

60|$|Once, on {{the edge}} of a wild orchard, I saw him rob a golden-winged woodpecker's nest in this way. The mother bird flew out as Mooweesuk came {{scratching}} up the tree, which assured him that he would find something worth while within. He stretched in a paw, caught an egg, and appeared to be rolling it up, holding it against the side of the tunnel. When the egg was almost up to the entrance he put in his nose to see the treasure. Then it slipped and fell back, and probably broke. He tried another, got it up safely, and ate it whole where he was. He tried a third, which slipped and broke like the first. At this, with the taste of <b>fresh</b> <b>egg</b> in his mouth, he seemed to grow impatient, or perhaps he got an idea from the yellow streaks on his claws. He jabbed his paw down hard to break all the eggs, and drew it up dripping. He licked it clean with his tongue and put it back again into the yellow mess at the bottom. This was easy, and he kept it up until his moist paw brought up only shells and rotten wood, when he backed away down the tree and shuffled off into the woods, leaving a sad mess for a mother woodpecker to face behind him.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Very low density lipoproteins were {{isolated}} from fresh and from 6 -month old eggs laid by hens fed a diet containing crude cottonseed oil. There {{were no differences}} between the very low density lipoproteins isolated from the fresh and those from the stored eggs {{in the percentage of}} lipid extracted by ether after the action of unfolding agents, detergents, reducing agents, trypsin, Pronase, or phospholipase D. Phospholipase C released less lipid from the very low density lipoproteins of the stored eggs than from those of the fresh unless they were extracted with ether before digestion, when equal amounts were extracted. Very low density lipoproteins isolated from <b>fresh</b> <b>eggs</b> and those isolated from stored eggs contained similar percentages of lipid. The very low density lipoproteins from the stored eggs had lower isoelectric points than those from <b>fresh</b> <b>eggs,</b> but there were no differences in average size when determined by electron microscopy. Egg yolk very low density lipoproteins are normally quite stable in water solution, but those from the stored eggs showed evidence of some decomposition during prolonged ultracentrifugation in water solution in contrast to those from <b>fresh</b> <b>eggs...</b>|$|R

6000|$|The {{difficulties}} {{of access to}} the mines will soon be ameliorated, as small steamers are to be put on the river, to ply as far up as the rapids will permit them; but as to the Indian difficulties, it is much to be feared they will increase until a military force is sent into the country to overawe them. The prices of provisions and of mining tools and other necessaries will soon be regulated by the competition of the San Francisco merchants, and the miners will not be long subjected to exorbitant rates. They have a vast advantage in the proximity of San Francisco, abounding, as it does, in supplies for all their wants. When I recall our early troubles and victimisings, I almost cease to pity the victims of the [...] "rocker irons," [...] at 6 pounds a-plate. In 1849 I paid 1 dollar 50 cents for the simple luxury of a <b>fresh</b> <b>egg.</b> I might have had one laid on the Atlantic board, or in Chile or the Sandwich Islands, for less, it is true; but these required French cookery to [...] "disguise" [...] their true state and condition, and I being then [...] "fresh" [...] myself was somewhat particular. Even this did not cap the climax, for I paid a sum in American currency equal to 16 pounds sterling for a pair of boots the day I was burnt out by the first fire--in the same year. And such a pair! They were navvy's boots, and worth in England about 15 shillings. The New Caledonians must not complain, for we have endured more (and survived it too) than they are likely to suffer.|$|E

50|$|Albumen is {{a mixture}} of {{proteins}} found in egg whites, and is utilized for its capacity to create foams. In a commercialized setting, dried albumen is used as opposed to <b>fresh</b> <b>egg</b> whites. In addition to convenience, the advantages of using dried albumen are an increase in food safety, and the reduction of water content in the marshmallow. <b>Fresh</b> <b>egg</b> whites carry a higher risk of Salmonella, and are approximately 90 percent water. This is undesirable for the shelf life and firmness of the product. For artisan-type marshmallows, prepared by a candy maker, <b>fresh</b> <b>egg</b> whites are usually used. Albumen is usually never used on its own when incorporated into marshmallows, and is used in conjunction with gelatin.|$|E
