The goal of Audio Aura is to provide serendipitous information, via background auditory cues, that is tied to people's physical actions in the workplace. We used scenarios to explore issues in serendipitous information such as privacy and work practice. Our sound design was guided {{by a number of}} stragegies for creating peripheral sounds grouped in cohesive ecologies. Faced with an physical and software infrastructure under development in a laboratory distant <b>from</b> <b>our</b> sound <b>studio,</b> we prototyped different sonic landscapes in VRML worlds.

It’s always been my belief that, once the people who work here believed in their own greatness, there was virtually nothing we couldn’t accomplish. And they have proven me right time and time again. Given our track record of achievement and the incredibly dynamic times we live in, I can honestly say I’ve never been more optimistic or enthusiastic about what lies ahead for The Walt Disney Company. We just delivered the best results {{in the history of this}} legendary company, marking our fourth fiscal year of record performance in a row, and our stock price has recently been trading higher than ever, which speaks to our sustained success as well as our optimism and belief in Disney’s potential to keep growing and creating value over the long term. <b>Our</b> <b>Studio</b> delivered some of the biggest movies of 2014, and surpassed $ 4 billion in global box office for the second year in a row.

500|$|Recording studios {{began to}} be {{operated}} in the street. Regent Sound Studio at No. 4 was founded in July 1961 {{to serve as a}} unit for publishers to record their songs.

The band recorded their first album at Regent in 1964 and the single [...] "Not Fade Away" [...] became their first major hit to be recorded there. Oldham liked the atmosphere in the studio as he could [...] "stretch out a bit, experiment and learn <b>from</b> <b>our</b> mistakes".

MY Studio is a multidisciplinary practice, operating in the space between architecture, art, and landscape. Engaged in projects of all scales, the firm believes in an embodied experience of architecture, seeing media as material and its effects as palpable elements of architectural speculation. Specializing in interactive environments and interested in the relationship between technology and the body, they are determined to translate conceptual ideas in the real world, testing projects ranging from concept clothing, artist books, installations and architecture through the dynamic interaction between the construct and the larger public. MY Studio's work was featured in the 2006 National Design Triennial at the Cooper Hewitt National Design Museum in New York. Their work has been exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary, and the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago.
