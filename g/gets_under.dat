500|$|The second opera, Daphne, {{begins as}} {{the wedding of}} Florindo and Daphne <b>gets</b> <b>under</b> way. Cupid, bent on more mischief, wounds Daphne with a special arrow, forged by the god Vulcan, that causes her to renounce all love. She {{abandons}} the wedding and announces that she will join the goddess Diana and become a huntress. This sparks a series of schemes and counter-schemes as both Apollo and Florindo continue to pursue Daphne while the other would-be lovers manoeuvre for position. Lycoris assures Apollo that Daphne's abandonment of the wedding was a signal that she favours him. Lycoris also steals Daphne's cloak and, wearing it as a disguise, makes advances to Damon, having first ensured that Florindo overhears. Florindo is enraged by what he believes is Daphne's duplicity, and denounces her. Damon confirms the story. Daphne, bewildered, pleads with her father Peneus to prove her innocence; he responds by transforming her into a laurel tree. Cupid blames Apollo's pride for the fiasco, but gives him the laurel as his [...] "special tree". Florindo now accepts Alfirena, and Lycoris, having confessed her scheming, is united with Damon. Only the guiltless Daphne ends up losing everything.|$|E
500|$|He was {{subsequently}} {{cast as the}} title role in director Mark Rydell's 2001 TV biographical film James Dean. To immerse himself in the role, Franco {{went from being a}} non-smoker to smoking two packs of cigarettes a day, bleached his dark brown hair blond, and learned to ride a motorcycle as well as play guitar and the bongos. To have a greater understanding of Dean, Franco spent hours with two of Dean's associates. Other research included reading books on Dean and studying his movies. While filming James Dean, the actor, to get into character, cut off communication with his family and friends, as well as his then-girlfriend. [...] "It was a very lonely existence," [...] he notes. [...] "If I wasn't on a set, I was watching James Dean. That was my whole thinking. James Dean. James Dean." [...] Despite already being a fan of Dean, Franco feared he might be typecast if he'd captured the actor too convincingly. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly wrote: [...] "Franco could have walked through the role and done a passable Dean, but instead <b>gets</b> <b>under</b> the skin of this insecure, rootless young man." [...] He received a Golden Globe Award and nominations for an Emmy Award and a Screen Actors Guild Award (SAG).|$|E

500|$|Plumlee often {{responded to}} cases {{involving}} child abuse or abandonment. Records {{show that she}} also participated in undercover investigations, including an anti-homosexual campaign organized by Mayor of Portland Dorothy McCullough Lee. In 1949, the Women's Protective Division sent Plumlee and Edna Trout to Music Hall, which was known at the time for catering to gay men and lesbians, with the intention to [...] "apprehend lesbians who might approach them and solicit attentions". Plumlee also helped educate women on how to avoid victimization. In a 1955 article by The Oregonian called [...] "Pickpockets Beware", she was photographed illustrating how a woman might be susceptible to pickpocketing by opening her billfold in public. In 1957, the paper published a photograph of Plumlee and five other women at a shooting range, with the caption: [...] "Feminine pistol team makes good showing in contest with all-male team from North precinct as interdivisional tournament <b>gets</b> <b>under</b> way". In 1959, two brothers were charged with disorderly conduct and destroying city property after tearing the speaker system from a police car occupied by Plumlee and another female officer. Plumlee also participated in civic events such as luncheons. At a 1964 Portland Yacht Club luncheon called [...] "Women with the Badge", she told female attendees how they should protect themselves and their children. In 1967, she presented slides depicting dangers to women on urban streets to the Women's Council of the Portland Board of Realtors at the Hoyt Hotel.|$|E
500|$|In 2010, Garfield co-starred {{opposite}} Carey Mulligan and Keira Knightley in Mark Romanek's dystopian {{science fiction}} drama Never Let Me Go, {{an adaptation of}} Kazuo Ishiguro's 2005 novel of the same name. He said of his character, Tommy D., [...] "There's a sense of anxiety that runs through these kids, especially Tommy, because he's so sensory and feeling and animalistic, that's my perspective of him." [...] Garfield was attracted to the film based on the existential questions the story expresses. He said {{the experience of being}} a part of Never Let Me Go was [...] "just a dream to come true". He further remarked that the scenes in which his character—unable to contain his frustration—erupts with a wail, were [...] "intense" [...] for him. [...] "I think those screams are inside all of us, I just got a chance to let mine out". For his portrayal of a well-meaning, but dim young man caught in a love triangle, he won the 2010 Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor. Cleveland Magazine Clint O'Connor lauded his performance, commenting that Garfield delivered [...] "a terrifically anguished performance" [...] in the film. Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Owen Gleiberman praised the performances of the lead cast, reflecting that [...] "these three all act with a spooky, haunted innocence that <b>gets</b> <b>under</b> your skin." [...] Tom Preston, a critic from The Guardian, further described Garfield's acting as solid and [...] "at times deeply moving". In comparison to Mulligan and Knightley, Scott Bowles, writing for USA Today, deemed Garfield [...] "the real find" [...] of Never Let Me Go.|$|E
500|$|Gilbert Adair, {{writing in}} a review for Full Metal Jacket, commented that [...] "Kubrick's {{approach}} to language has always been of a reductive and uncompromisingly deterministic nature. He appears to view it as the exclusive product of environmental conditioning, only very marginally influenced by concepts of subjectivity and interiority, by all whims, shades and modulations of personal expression". Johnson notes that although Kubrick was a [...] "visual filmmaker", he also loved words and was like a writer in his approach, very sensitive to the story itself, which he found unique. Before shooting began, Kubrick tried to have the script as complete as possible, but still allowed himself enough space to make changes during the filming, finding it [...] "more profitable to avoid locking up any ideas about staging or camera or even dialogue prior to rehearsals" [...] as he put it. Kubrick told Robert Emmett Ginna: [...] "I {{think you have to}} view the entire problem of putting the story you want to tell up there on that light square. It begins with the selection of the property; it continues through the creation of the story, the sets, the costumes, the photography and the acting. And when the picture is shot, it's only partially finished. I think the cutting is just a continuation of directing a movie. I think the use of music effects, opticals and finally main titles are all part of telling the story. And I think the fragmentation of these jobs, by different people, is a very bad thing". Kubrick also said: [...] "I think that the best plot is no apparent plot. I like a slow start, the start that <b>gets</b> <b>under</b> the audience's skin and involves them so that they can appreciate grace notes and soft tones and don't have to be pounded over the head with plot points and suspense tools." ...|$|E

His enthusiasm for the U.S. Bill of Rights contrasts with a dim opinion of constitutional politics {{on the other side of}} the Atlantic. Hitchens notes, [...] "the utter failure [...] to compose a viable constitution" [...] and the [...] "brevity of the British constitution, perhaps because the motherland of the English-speaking peoples has absent-mindedly failed to evolve one in written form".|$|E
2500|$|More {{information}} about the game was released {{just prior to the}} E3 event in May. Two non-playable demo levels were shown, demonstrating the game engine's ability to create battles involving up to 170 soldiers, with advanced AI resulting in enemies and allies fighting one another irrespective of the player's actions. A new playable demo was made available at E3 itself, with Sega emphasizing that at any one time in battle, the player may have three or four simultaneous objectives. A near complete build of the game was sent out to gaming websites in August. IGN's Juan Castro wrote [...] "while unfinished, Spartan: Total Warrior looks good and plays well [...] combat feels intense and moves at a fluid pace, running at a solid framerate throughout."
