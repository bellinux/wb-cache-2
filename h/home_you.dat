500|$|Fuseli's other Macbeth Woodmason {{painting}} Macbeth and the Armed Head {{depicts a}} later {{scene in which}} Macbeth is shown MacDuff and warned {{to be wary of}} him. Fuseli evidently intended the two paintings to be juxtaposed. He said, [...] "when Macbeth meets with the witches on the heath, it is terrible, because he did not expect the supernatural visitation; but when he goes to the cave to ascertain his fate, it is no longer a subject of terror." [...] Fuseli chose to make MacDuff a near-likeness of Macbeth himself, and considered the painting one of his most poetic in that sense, asking, [...] "'What would be a greater object of terror to you if, some night on going <b>home,</b> <b>you</b> were to find yourself sitting at your own table [...] [...] [...] would not this make a powerful impression on your mind?" ...|$|E

500|$|The {{hospital}} corpsman and sniper of a four-man reconnaissance {{and surveillance}} team, SEAL Team 10. Wahlberg {{was the first}} actor to sign on as a star of the film during its early stages of development. He agreed to portray Luttrell after reading Peter Berg's script. Wahlberg chose not to read Luttrell's book Lone Survivor during production to avoid arguments with Berg over events and details that were {{left out in the}} book. [...] "The problem when adapting a piece of material like that is that you always feel like something is missing", he explained. [...] "I wanted to come at it from this perspective." [...] Of Wahlberg's portrayal, Luttrell stated, [...] "Wahlberg is a consummate professional, and he's a great actor. It was a little strange watching somebody trying to play me, but we talked about it and I knew it would turn out great. I was more worried about the other guys because they’re not around to speak for themselves." [...] Wahlberg has since cited Lone Survivor as his favorite film role as an actor and producer: [...] "This is the best working experience I’ve ever had, under the toughest conditions. I remember early on as an actor, you worked a long, hard day, but you did something you felt was special, and that car ride <b>home</b> <b>you</b> couldn’t stop thinking about it. I had that feeling every day on this movie." ...|$|E

[...] As a child, however, she had been reluctant to assume the family legacy. [...] She later told The Gramophone magazine: [...] "At <b>home,</b> <b>you</b> know, we weren't allowed to hum Gilbert and Sullivan; in fact we were fined for it, because it annoyed my father. We were allowed to sing it properly, but my brother and I couldn't – in my family the fact that I wasn't Mozart at about three years old was thought of as rather disappointing. So I went through a phase when I was very anti-Gilbert and Sullivan; I became rather a highbrow, and my father thought I {{was a bit of}} a snake-in-the-grass because of it." ...|$|E

2500|$|An {{aquarium}} (plural: aquariums or aquaria) is a vivarium of {{any size}} having at least one transparent side in which water-dwelling plants or animals are kept and displayed. Fishkeepers use aquaria to keep fish, invertebrates, amphibians, aquatic reptiles such as turtles, and aquatic plants. The term, coined by English naturalist Philip Henry Gosse, combines the Latin root aqua, meaning water, with the suffix -arium, meaning [...] "a place for relating to". The aquarium principle was fully developed in 1850 by the chemist Robert Warington, who explained that plants added to water in a container would give off enough oxygen to support animals, so long as their numbers do not grow too large. The aquarium craze was launched in early Victorian England by Gosse, who created and stocked the first public aquarium at the London Zoo in 1853, and published the first manual, The Aquarium: An Unveiling of the Wonders of the Deep Sea in 1854. An aquarium is a water-filled tank in which fish swim about. You can keep a small aquarium at <b>home.</b> <b>You</b> can visit a large aquarium in most cities. This kind of aquarium is a building with fish and other water animals in large tanks. A large aquarium may have otters, turtles, dolphins, and other sea animals. Most aquarium tanks also have plants.|$|E
2500|$|Hazlitt was {{ambivalent}} about Rome, the farthest {{point of his}} journey. His first impression was one of disappointment. He had expected primarily the monuments of antiquity.

[...] Further, [...] "the picture galleries at Rome disappointed me quite". Eventually he found plenty to admire, but the accumulation of monuments of art in one place was almost too much for him, and there were also too many distractions. There were the [...] "pride, pomp, and pageantry" [...] of the Catholic religion, as well as having {{to cope with the}} [...] "inconvenience of a stranger's residence at Rome....You want some shelter from the insolence and indifference of the inhabitants....You have to squabble with every one about you to prevent being cheated, to drive a hard bargain in order to live, to keep your hands and your tongue within strict bounds, for fear of being stilettoed, or thrown into the Tower of St. Angelo, or remanded <b>home.</b> <b>You</b> have much to do to avoid the contempt of the inhabitants....You must run the gauntlet of sarcastic words or looks for a whole street, of laughter or want of comprehension in reply to all the questions you ask....|$|E
