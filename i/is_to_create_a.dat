5|$|A popular {{approach}} {{to improve performance}} <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> memory pool-based allocator. Instead of allocating memory every time an item is inserted or removed from a container, a large block of memory (the memory pool) is allocated beforehand, possibly at the startup of the program. The custom allocator will serve individual allocation requests by simply returning a pointer to memory from the pool. Actual deallocation of memory can be deferred until the lifetime of the memory pool ends. An example of memory pool-based allocators {{can be found in}} the Boost C++ Libraries.|$|E

Its goal <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> structure for {{design in the}} company, bridging the gap between objectives set through strategic {{design management}} and the implementation of design on the operational level. It defines how design is organised within the company. This includes {{the use of a}} central body to coordinate different design projects and activities. It deals with defining activities, developing design skills and competencies, managing processes, systems and procedures, assigning of roles and responsibilities, developing innovative products and service concepts, and finding new market opportunities. Outcomes of tactical design management are related {{to the creation of a}} structure for design within the company, to build internal resources and competencies for the implementation of design.
