This study employs <b>entropy</b> <b>spectral</b> <b>analysis</b> for forecasting monthly groundwater levels. For spectral analysis, the domain of consideration for defining entropy is the frequency domain, in which three types of entropies are known: Burg entropy, configurational entropy, and relative entropy. These entropies lead to three types of spectral analysis: (1) Burg <b>entropy</b> <b>spectral</b> <b>analysis</b> (BESA), (2) configurational <b>entropy</b> <b>spectral</b> <b>analysis</b> (CESA), and (3) relative <b>entropy</b> <b>spectral</b> <b>analysis</b> (RESA). BESA, CESA, and RESA are employed to analyze spectra and forecast monthly groundwater levels, and then they are compared to determine which spectral analysis method better forecasts the monthly groundwater level. Monthly and annual groundwater data were obtained from South Carolina to verify the three methods. Both monthly and annual groundwater level data showed significant decreasing trends at almost all stations. It was found that relative entropy yielded the highest resolution in determining the spectral density, while for simulating groundwater levels, all three methods fitted the observed values well. This was indicated by the average value of Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) for BESA, CESA, and RESA being 0. 69, 0. 70, and 0. 70, respectively...|$|E
40|$|<b>Entropy</b> <b>spectral</b> <b>analysis</b> is {{developed}} for monthly streamflow forecasting, which contains {{the use of}} configurational entropy and relative entropy. Multi-channel <b>entropy</b> <b>spectral</b> <b>analysis</b> {{is developed}} for long-term drought forecasting with climate indicators. The configurational <b>entropy</b> <b>spectral</b> <b>analysis</b> (CESA) is developed with both spectral power and frequency as random variables. With spectral power as a random variable, the configurational <b>entropy</b> <b>spectral</b> <b>analysis</b> (CESAS) {{identical to the original}} Burg <b>entropy</b> <b>spectral</b> <b>analysis</b> (BESA) when the underlying process is Gaussian. Through examination using monthly streamflow from the Mississippi Watershed, CESAS and BESA yield the same results and two methods are considered equivalent or as one method. With frequency as a random variable, the configurational <b>entropy</b> <b>spectral</b> <b>analysis</b> (CESAF) is developed and tested using monthly streamflow data from 19 river basins covering a broad range of physiographic characteristics. Testing shows that CESAF captures streamflow seasonality and satisfactorily forecasts both high and low flows. When relative drainage area is considered for analyzing streamflow characteristics and spectral patterns, it is found that upstream streamflow is forecasted more accurately than downstream streamflow. Minimum relative <b>entropy</b> <b>spectral</b> <b>analysis</b> (MRESA) is developed under two conditions: spectral power as a random variable (RESAS) and frequency as a random variable (RESAF). The exponential distribution was chosen as a prior probability in the RESAS theory, and in the RESAF theory, the prior is chosen from the periodicity of streamflow. Both MRESA theories were evaluated using monthly streamflow observed at 20 stations in the Mississippi River basin, where forecasted monthly streamflow shows higher reliability in the Upper Mississippi than in the Lower Mississippi. The proposed univariate entropy spectral analyses are generally recommended over the classical autoregressive (AR) process for higher reliability and longer forecasting lead time. By comparing two MRESA theories with the two maximum entropy spectral analyses (MESA) (BESA and CESA), it is found that MRESA provided higher resolution in spectral estimation and more reliable streamflow forecasting, especially for multi-peak flow conditions. The MRESA theory is more accurate in forecasting streamflow for both peak and low flow values with longer lead time than MESA. Besides, choosing frequency as a random variable shows advantages over choosing spectral power. Spectral density estimated by the RESAF or CESAF theory shows higher resolution than the RESAS or BESA theory, respectively, and streamflow forecasted by RESAF or CESAF is more reliable than that by RESAS or BESA, respectively. Finally, multi-channel <b>entropy</b> <b>spectral</b> <b>analysis</b> (MCESA) is developed for bivariate or multi-variate time series forecasting. MCESA theory is verified by forecasting long-term standardized streamflow index with El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) indicator. SSI was successfully forecasted using multi-channel spectral analysis with ENSO as an indicator. The monthly drought series is forecasted for lead times of 4 - 6 years by MCESA...|$|E

40|$|Background: Much {{effort has}} been {{expended}} on interpreting the mechanism of influenza epidemics, so as to better predict them. In addition to the obvious annual cycle of influenza epidemics, longer-term incidence patterns are present. These so-called interepidemic periods have long been a focus of epidemiology. However, there has been less investigation of the interepidemic period of influenza epidemics. In the present study, we used <b>spectral</b> <b>analysis</b> of influenza morbidity records to indentify the interepidemic period of influenza epidemics in Japan. Methods: We used time series data of the monthly incidence of influenza in Japan from January 1948 through December 1998. To evaluate the incidence data, we conducted maximum <b>entropy</b> method (MEM) <b>spectral</b> <b>analysis,</b> which is useful in investigating the periodicities of shorter time series, {{such as that of}} the incidence data used in the present study. We also conducted a segment time series analysis and obtained a 3 -dimensional spectral array. Results: Based on the results of power spectral density (PSD) obtained from MEM <b>spectral</b> <b>analysis,</b> we identified 3 periodic modes as the interepidemic periods of the incidence data. Segment time series analysis revealed that the amount of amplitude of the interepidemic periods increased during the occurrence of influenza pandemics and decreased when vaccine programs were introduced.

The averaged value during the 40  to 30  minute period before an attack was defined as the baseline.  RESULTS—Compared with baseline, the HF component decreased in both groups at two minutes before the attack (p <  0. 01), and the LF/HF ratio decreased at three minutes before the attack (p <  0. 01).
