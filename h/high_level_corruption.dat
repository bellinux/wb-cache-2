40|$|The declining Zimbabwean {{economy has}} {{resulted}} in corruption reaching epidemic proportions. There is a high tolerance for it in society as {{it is seen as}} {{the only way to get}} timely service or any service at all especially in the public sector which is infested with petty corruption. Through some examples this paper reveals that in the education, health, justice, transport and custom sectors it is common to find public servants charging extra for services, seeking small favours, or using pubic facilities and materials for their own marginal personal gain. Payment of a bribes is now a normal and accepted way of doing business and is no longer viewed by most as an immoral act. Whilst the causes of this petty or bureaucratic corruption can be easily identified it is important to understand the nature and culture of corruption, how it moves from one level to the next. This paper uses an agency model of corruption whose setup has been widely cited and serves as a foundation for empirical research and policy design to combat bureaucratic corruption to show that the public officials rationally make a choice to be corrupt by weighing key determinants which are, the return of corruption against public wage levels, the penalty and probability of being detected. Paying particular attention to the customs sector this paper uses the multi-equilibria model by Andvig and Moene, (1989) “How corruption may corrupt” to show that the increase in the bribe price in the short-run beyond a certain level may result in a shift to a <b>high</b> <b>level</b> <b>corruption</b> equilibrium which is reversible if the bribe price decreases beyond a certain level. However in the long-run this reversal may be difficult and the sector may be stuck in the <b>high</b> <b>level</b> <b>corruption</b> equilibrium. The ratchet effects of corruption in both the supply and demand may result in its continuity and movement towards full corruption in some parts of the customs sector...|$|E

40|$|In 1989, a Commission of Inquiry {{known as}} the Fitzgerald Inquiry {{recommended}} massive reforms in the Queensland Police Service {{in the wake of}} <b>high</b> <b>level</b> <b>corruption.</b> Many of the 121 recommendations were made {{as a result of the}} perception that the police culture in Queensland contributed to a “culture” of corruption. This paper will consider whether “typical” police culture impedes the anti-corruption ideal in the context of specific recommendations about crime prevention. There are valid arguments to be made that the culture of the Fitzgerald era is not the culture of the contemporary Queensland Police Service. Dramatic changes have been made in policy development, professional standards, accountability and recruiting which have impacted on all sectors of the police, including the proactive field of crime prevention. The question remains whether structural and recruiting changes have had the impact on police culture that Fitzgerald envisaged for Queensland. Focusing on crime prevention within the Queensland Police Service, this paper uses policy analysis and interviews with police officers to present evidence which suggest a paradigm shift in Queensland, that although “typical” police culture still exists, it exists in a growing harmony with non-reactive police sections. Whether this is a culture that is corruption-resistant remains unresolved...|$|E

40|$|Abstract- Nigeria {{has been}} portrayed in bad light {{due to its}} unimpressive image and {{reputation}} as a corrupt and mismanaged economy often blamed on bad governance and leadership. The paper basically examines the impact and consequences of state weakness on the Nigerian foreign policy reputation. Findings from the paper reveals that Nigeria since inception as a federation has been a fragile and weak nation, Nigerian foreign policy reputation has been greatly affected by some internal factors that have made the country not to secure a remarkable influence and respect in sub-regional, regional and global diplomatic relationship despite its wealth and commitment in assisting other countries, {{the weakness of the}} Nigerian state arises primarily from the incapacity of the state to deliver essential and basic needs to its citizens and the Nigerian state is a victim of <b>high</b> <b>level</b> <b>corruption</b> and bad governance, political instability, ethnic and religious conflicts among others. These challenges have clogged up the route to sustainable development, tarnished Nigeria’s image and caused the diminishment of Nigeria’s prominence both at home and abroad. The paper therefore recommends that, the Nigerian government should vigorously pursue goals of democracy, good governance and respect for human rights at home to ensure that its leadership role is credible abroad, Nigeria should urgently mount image and reputation management campaigns in the media and project the achievements and humanitarian efforts of the country, the anti-corruption agencies should be pro-active, sincere and expedite action in fighting corruption.

40|$|Economic {{growth is}} a hot topic among economists around the world. The last century {{many parts of the}} world have faced an {{acceleration}} in the economic growth. However, that is not the case for all countries and today there is a large economic gap between the rich and poor countries. But why have some parts of the world succeeded to create economic growth while others do not? The purpose of this study is to create a deeper understanding of the mechanism between economic growth and governance in the frontier market. To do this, a Vector autoregressive time series model will be used. The frontier market is an ad-hoc market index containing 22 countries that have not been classified as developing countries yet. In the poor parts of the world <b>high</b> <b>level</b> <b>corruption</b> and lack of political stability such as rule of law is a fact. Hence, the study will use control of corruption, rule of law as governance variables to investigate the association between governance and economic growth among the countries in the frontier market. Further it will investigate if there is a Granger causality between governance and economic growth and whether it is running from economic growth to governance or conversely. The results implies that there is association between governance and economic growth for Bahrain, Bangladesh, Croatia, Kazakhstan, Lebanon, Lithuania, Mauritius, Morocco, Pakistan, Romania, Slovenia, Serbia, Sri Lanka and Vietnam.

Results [...] Chapter 5. Discussion and conclusion. The study investigates {{the association between}} political connections and organisational performance in Pakistan. It is motivated by mixed findings in the literature regarding the impact of political connections on organisational performance. Further, there is a particular dearth of research on political connections in the South Asian region, thereby leaving an empirical gap in the literature. This study is primarily motivated to address this gap in the literature. In view of a weak regulatory environment, poor implementation {{of the law and}} <b>high</b> <b>level</b> <b>corruption</b> in Pakistan, the study hypothesises a positive association between political connections and organisational performance. Data was collected from 250 non-financial organisations listed on the Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE) of Pakistan. The results reveal that political connections in Pakistan are common across all industries; however, contrary to the expectations, political connections in Pakistan have a significant negative association with organisational performance. In particular, the study found a significantly negative effect of political connections on return on assets and return on equity. In addition, negative association of political connections with organisational performance is more pronounced for organisations having connections with politicians compared to those having connections with former government officials. The study contributes to the existing literature on political connections by providing evidence of the impact of political connections on organisational performance in high corruption and weak regulatory environment. It is the first study which provides evidence of political connections and their impact on organisational performance in Pakistan. The findings can be generalised to other South Asian countries, with similar socio-economic, political and regulatory settingss. Mode of access: World wide web 1 online resource (88 pages...|$|E
40|$|The {{legal and}} {{economic}} analysis presented here empirically tests the theoretical framework advanced by Kugler, Verdier, and Zenou (2003) and Buscaglia (1997). This paper {{goes beyond the}} prior literature {{by focusing on the}} empirical assessment of the actual implementation of the institutional deterrence and prevention mechanisms contained in the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime (Palermo Convention). A sample of 107 countries that have already signed and/or ratified the Convention was selected. The paper verifies that the most effective implemented measures against organized crime are mainly founded on four pillars: (i) the introduction of more effective judicial decision-making control systems causing reductions in the frequencies of abuses of procedural and substantive discretion; (ii) higher frequencies of successful judicial convictions based on evidentiary material provided by financial intelligence systems aimed at the systematic confiscation of assets in the hands of criminal groups and under the control of licit businesses linked to organized crime; (iii) the attack against high level public sector corruption (that is captured and feudalized by organized crime) and (iv) the operational presence of government and/or non-governmental preventive programs (funded by the private sector and/or governments and/or international organizations) addressing technical assistance to the private sector, educational opportunities, job training programs and/or rehabilitation (health and/or behavioral) of youth linked to organized crime in high-risk areas (with high-crime, high unemployment, and high poverty). An empirical jurimetrics model is for the first time developed for the above four anti-crime policy domains in order to assess the legal implementation of organized crime laws. In this context, the empirical results suggest that high-impact prosecutions and effective convictions against criminal organizations are less driven by incarceration of physical persons and more focused on disrupting the production function of criminal groups through asset forfeitures that reduce the amounts of net worth aimed at expanding public corruption rings in order to feudalize States. At the same time, preventive policies aimed at diminishing the flow of youth into criminal activities will also tend to disrupt the street-based operational capacities of organized crime. Accordingly, a paradox of criminal dissuasion emerges that requires the adjustment of Beckers (1968) framework when applied to organized crime. As a result of the jurimetrics-based analysis presented in this study, just relying on traditional legal sanctions to counteract organized crime (e. g., increased incarceration and/or extradition of physical persons) will tend to create an incentive for criminal groups to expand their corruption rings (in order to protect themselves from higher expected sanctions) thus increasing the feudalization of the state by criminal groups while enhancing their operational capacities. This unwanted result of applying traditional criminal sanctions will occur if the network of criminal assets (net worth {{in the hands of a}} network of licit and illicit businesses) is not hampered by intelligence and judicial authorities first. In the cases where criminal asset networks remain untouched, the data in this paper show that criminal groups will simply react to higher expected punishments by re-assigning their relatively untouched financial resources to expanding their rings (scope) and scale of corruption at higher levels in order to protect themselves. As a result, organized crime and <b>high</b> <b>level</b> <b>corruption</b> grow even when the expected punishment aimed at the members of criminal enterprises is increasing at the same time. The jurimetrics-based results in 107 countries show that, in the absence of an active financial intelligence-based criminal assets forfeiture program, high-level corruption grows rapidly while, paradoxically, public sectors continue to devote more criminal justice system resources to incarcerating increasing numbers of organized crime members. At the same time, empirical analysis shows that higher probabilities of sanctions combined with stiffer sentencing guidelines on the books against organized crime members do not play their dissuasive role in the absence of preventive programs to reduce the flow of youth to criminal groups. This constitutes the paradox of criminal sanctions where more frequent and stiffer punishments applied to physical persons lead to higher levels of organized crime and higher level corruption. The deterioration of institutional performance against criminal enterprises in Afghanistan and México and the recent 2001 - 2007 significant improvements experienced by Colombia and Jordan can be explained jointly by financial intelligence, judicial capacities, and preventive capabilities coordinated by public sectors and civil societies. ...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} investigates Russia’s {{transition to}} a market economy and the <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of <b>corruption</b> that accompanied the process. After some sixty years under Communism and a centrally planned economy, Russia began the {{transition to a}} market economy {{at the beginning of the}} 1990 ’s. After the dissolution of the USSR in 1991 a power vacuum emerged which was filled to a large extent by organised crime and corrupt government officials. <b>High</b> <b>levels</b> of <b>corruption</b> became a common feature of the transitional process and to this day Russia is still perceived to be one of the most corrupt countries in the world. The dissolution of the USSR in 1991 was followed by dramatic drops in Russian citizens standards of living, income and even life expectancy. The harsh climate of the early stages of the transition was characterised by mass unemployment and most Russian citizens living in poverty. However some segments of Russian society became extremely rich during the early stages of transition. This was illustrated by the increase in wealth disparity as those with the right connections to government, business and organised crime flourished while those who did not, found their standards of living decreasing and sliding further into poverty. This study will look at some of the reasons or factors contributing to the <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of <b>corruption</b> in transitional Russia. Some of the contributory factors to be analysed are the inefficient and weak legal system, the large unregulated economy and the oligarchic networks controlling large portions of the Russian economy. To some degree the political and economic impact of corruption will also be analysed and assessed.
