5|$|In the field, the AWS is less exuberant {{than the}} English Springer Spaniel, {{but it is}} as skilled in {{retrieval}} as Labrador or Golden Retriever. It is versatile regardless {{of the type of}} terrain, and in the water it is not the fastest swimmer but has a high level of endurance. The breed <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>good</b> at agility and flyball, with the first of the breed receiving a flyball championship title in 1993.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the mountainous}} and forested {{sections}} of the drainage basin lie protected under national forest lands. There are several campgrounds overseen by the U.S. Forest Service in {{the headwaters of the}} Potlatch River watershed. Fishing <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>good</b> in the Potlatch River and many of its tributaries. Anglers are only permitted to catch brook trout, cutthroat trout, and rainbow and steelhead trout. The Department of Fish and Game annually stocks fish in the river. Fishing is permitted on the Potlatch from its mouth upstream to where Moose Creek joins the river near Bovill, {{as well as on the}} East Fork.|$|E

25|$|The dorsal {{stream is}} {{involved}} in spatial awareness and guidance of actions (e.g., reaching). In this it has two distinct functional characteristics—it contains a detailed map of the visual field, and <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>good</b> at detecting and analyzing movements.|$|E
25|$|There {{is clear}} {{evidence}} for the effectiveness of group psychotherapy for depression: a meta-analysis of 48 studies showed an overall effect size of 1.03, which is clinically highly significant. Similarly, a meta-analysis of five studies of group psychotherapy for adult sexual abuse survivors showed moderate to strong effect sizes, and there <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>good</b> evidence for effectiveness with chronic traumatic stress in war veterans.|$|E
25|$|Since 2015 the WFP has {{introduced}} digital cash transfers, i.e. sends 100 KShi in cash per person/ month through a mobile phone to replace {{part of the}} food rations (10% of staple cereal like maize, wheat flour, or sorghum). The cash can only be redeemed for food. This gives refugees more freedom to decide what they will eat and <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>good</b> for the local economy.|$|E

25|$|Designing {{a strong}} curved jib {{required}} Fairbairn's advanced theoretical {{understanding of the}} mechanics of a box girder. The tension forces were carried by the outer, convex surface of the girder which was made of back plates being chain-riveted together. The inner surface carried a compressive load. To avoid plate crumpling, it was made as a cellular structure: an inner plate and webs formed three rectangular cells, effectively box girders in their own right. The character of a box girder is to resist torsional twisting, so a composite face built up of them <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>good</b> at resisting crumpling.|$|E
25|$|The fourth type of {{turnover}} is dysfunctional, {{which occurs}} when a high-performing employee leaves the organization. Dysfunctional turnover can be potentially costly to an organization, and could {{be the result of}} a more appealing job offer or lack of opportunities in career advancement. Too much turnover is not only costly, but it can also give an organization a bad reputation. However, there <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>good</b> turnover, which {{occurs when a}}n organization finds a better fit with a new employee in a certain position. Good turnover can also transpire when an employee has outgrown opportunities within a certain organization and must move forward with his or her career in a new organization.|$|E
25|$|Laser {{desorption}} electrospray ionization (LDESI) {{mass spectrometry}} is an ambient ionization technique applicable to {{plant and animal}} tissue imaging, live-cell imaging, and most recently to cell-by-cell imaging. This technique uses a mid-IR laser to ablate the sample which creates a cloud of neutral molecules. This cloud is then hit with the electrospray from above to cause ionization. The desorbed ions are then able to pass into the mass spectrometer for analysis. This method <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>good</b> for imaging in applications. The analyses can be desorbed through a pulsed laser irradiation without the need of a matrix. This method is best used with small organic molecules up to larger biomolecules as well.|$|E

25|$|Efforts {{to improve}} {{nutrition}} {{are some of}} the most effective forms of development aid. Breastfeeding can reduce rates of malnutrition and death in children, and efforts to promote the practice increase the rates of breastfeeding. In young children, providing food (in addition to breastmilk) between six months and two years of age improves outcomes. There <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>good</b> evidence supporting the supplementation of a number of micronutrients to women during pregnancy and among young children in the developing world. To get food to people who need it most, both delivering food and providing money so people can buy food within local markets are effective. Simply feeding students at school is insufficient. Management of severe malnutrition within the person's home with ready-to-use therapeutic foods is possible much of the time. In those who have severe malnutrition complicated by other health problems, treatment in a hospital setting is recommended. This often involves managing low blood sugar and body temperature, addressing dehydration, and gradual feeding. Routine antibiotics are usually recommended due to the high risk of infection. Longer-term measures include: improving agricultural practices, reducing poverty, improving sanitation, and the empowerment of women.|$|E
25|$|The {{transition}} from solitary living to group living (identified by John Maynard Smith {{as one of}} the seven major transitions in evolutionary history) brought with it many fitness benefits (increased anti-predator vigilance, foraging benefits etc.) and the opportunity to exploit a vast array of new ecological niches, but group living also has its pitfalls. Numerous studies have demonstrated an increase in contact-transmitted parasite load with group size increase, and thus research has been done on the role of social immunity in the evolution of early group living. Empirical evidence already exists, from both interspecific and intraspecific comparative studies, that an increase in population density drives an increase in personal immune effort (density-dependent prophylaxis). However, there <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>good</b> evidence that the evolution of social immunity leads to a trade-off between effort into personal immune responses vs. effort in social immune responses - physiological and genomic studies have shown that social conditions can lead to a reduction in personal immune effort. Personal immunity in the Australian plague locust (Chortoicetes terminifera) decreases upon an increase in population density and increases when artificially isolated. Genomic studies reveal that infected solitary S. gregaria express more genes involved in immunity than infected individuals in the gregarious phase, Bombus terrestris workers also upregualte immune-related genes when experimentally isolated and there are three times more immune-related gene families in solitary insects than in the eusocial honeybees.|$|E

500|$|The Audubon society, {{reviewing}} {{the importance of}} birds in 2013, obtained statements from many people with differing perspectives. Among them, the society's science director, Gary Langham, noted that {{what is good for}} birds <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>good</b> for humans. The writer David Allen Sibley observed that birds bring a little wildness into parks and gardens. The writer Barbara Kingsolver noted that birds are part of life on earth. The actress Jane Alexander wrote [...] "Birds remind us that there are angels." [...] The forensic ornithologist Carla Dove noted that birds are biological indicators of habitat health, climate change, and the coming of spring.|$|E
500|$|Home-town club Crawley Town's manager Francis Vines {{hoped to}} sign Wormull, {{describing}} {{him as a}} good all-round player who [...] "can play in the middle or wide right and passes the ball well, {{as well as being}} useful with set-pieces. He <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>good</b> in the tackle", capable of strengthening an already strong midfield. They were unable to match the offer– believed to be £800 a week– from Conference South club Hornchurch, dubbed the [...] "Chelsea of the Conference" [...] because they had a well-paid full-time professional squad despite playing only in the sixth tier of English football. A back injury restricted his Hornchurch appearances, and he had not played for several weeks when, in November 2004, the owner's business collapsed, the players' pay cheques were stopped, and most of the squad left.|$|E
