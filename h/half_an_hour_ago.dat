2500|$|McIntyre {{asked whether}} {{he was to be}} shot. Kelly replied, [...] "No, why should I want to shoot you? Could I not have done it <b>half</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>ago</b> if I had wanted?" [...] He added, [...] "At first I thought you were Constable Flood. If you had been, I would have roasted you in the fire." [...] Kelly asked if the police came out to shoot him. [...] "No", replied McIntyre, [...] "we came to {{apprehend}} you." [...] "What", asked Kelly, [...] "brings you out here at all? It is a shame to see fine big strapping fellows like you in a lazy loafing billet like policemen." ...|$|E
2500|$|During the interval, Spofforth made an {{announcement}} to his team-mates in the dressing-room: [...] "This thing can be done.!" [...] In spite of being reduced to fifteen for two early on, England {{made a good}} start in its pursuit of a victory target of 85. The score rose to 51 for two, with Grace and Ulyett hitting out strongly. Spofforth changed ends, and Neville Cardus wrote thus of this move: [...] "Now I was behind his arm; I could see his superb break-back. And he bowled mainly medium pace at this time. With each off-break I could see his right hand, {{at the end of}} the swing over, finish near the left side, 'cutting' under the ball. Sometimes his arm went straight over and continued straight down in the follow-through â€“ and then the batsmen had to tackle fierce topspin. There was the sense of the inimical in his aspect now. He seemed taller than he was <b>half</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>ago,</b> the right arm more sinuous. There was no excitement in him he was ... cold-blooded." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{consider}} you the cleverest rogue in existence," [...] said he. [...] "But {{even the}} cleverest may be trapped, in time, and your big mistake was in disposing of those pearls so openly. See here," [...] he added, taking {{from his pocket}} a small packet. [...] "Here are the famous Taprobane pearls--six of them--which were found in your room <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>hour</b> <b>ago.</b> They, also, {{were a part of}} the countess' collection." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The assassin studied out {{his plan}} {{with a good}} deal of pains. It was a good plan, very ingenious, and showed an {{intelligent}} mind, not a feeble one. It was a plan which was well calculated to ward off all suspicion from its inventor. In the first place, he marked a candle into spaces an inch apart, and lit it and timed it. He found it took three hours to burn four inches of it. I tried it myself for <b>half</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour,</b> awhile <b>ago,</b> up-stairs here, while the inquiry into Flint Buckner's character and ways was being conducted in this room, and I arrived in that way at the rate of a candle's consumption when sheltered from the wind. Having proved his trial candle's rate, he blew it out--I have already shown it to you--and put his inch-marks on a fresh one.|$|R
50|$|Henry Gustav Molaison, {{formerly}} known as patient H.M., was an amnesiac patient following the surgery of his hippocampus, hippocampal gyrus, and amygdala in order to relieve the symptoms of his epilepsy. Due to his surgery, Molaison developed anterograde amnesia which made him forgetful of recently occurring events. His amnesia made it so that he had severe difficulties remembering events that happened as little as <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>hour</b> <b>ago</b> in his life. Although Molaison was unable to learn consciously, he still had almost normal abilities {{when it came to}} his sensorimotor skills indicating that he may have held on to some remnants of his unconscious (implicit) previous experiences.|$|R

6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] {{she cried}} out, rhythmically accenting her blows in {{series of three}} to each shrill observation. [...] "I forbade {{you to talk to}} Li Faa. To-day you stopped on the street with her. Not <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>ago.</b> <b>Half</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> by the clock you talked.--What is that?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There," [...] he said, [...] "is the {{evidence}} that she can't have left this place by land. And here," [...] he went on, looking at the fisherman, [...] "is {{the evidence}} that she can't have got away by sea." [...] He stopped, and considered for a minute. [...] "She was seen running towards this place, <b>half</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> before I got here from the house," [...] he said to Yolland. [...] "Some time has passed since then. Call it, altogether, <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>ago.</b> How high would the water be, at that time, {{on this side of}} the rocks?" [...] He pointed to the south side--otherwise, the side which was not filled up by the quicksand.|$|R
6000|$|BRODIE. No, Jean, this {{is where}} it ends. Uncle, {{this is where}} it ends. And to think that not <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>ago</b> I still had hopes! Hopes!
