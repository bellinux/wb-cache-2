50|$|The {{coordinate}} transformation theory {{reveals that}} the Kirkendall effect {{is caused by a}} shift between the coordinate systems of diffusion equation like the Doppler effect relevant to a wave equation is caused by a shift between the fixed coordinate system and the moving one. Further, it was also found that the concept of intrinsic diffusion is an illusion in the diffusion history. All physical information in the given diffusion system is incorporated into the diffusivity. If we can know a diffusivity behavior in the given diffusion equation, the mathematical solution and/or numerical one at least is possible. In the diffusion problems, it is thus extremely dominant to know the diffusivity behavior. The diffusivity is defined by an interaction between a diffusion particle and the <b>diffusion</b> <b>field</b> near the diffusion particle itself. This indicates that the diffusivity should be essentially investigated in the quantum mechanics, since the behavior of a micro particle should be investigated by analyzing the Schrodinger equation.|$|E
5000|$|In 1947, Kirkendall {{found that}} an inert marker set {{at a point in}} a binary alloy moves from the initial sate point after the {{diffusion}} treatment. [...] The phenomena are so called Kirkendall effect and it was considered that we cannot understand it from the existing theory of binary interdiffusion in those days. As a result, a new concept of intrinsic diffusion was then introduced for understanding the Kirkendall effect in the interdiffusion problems. Based on the intrinsic diffusion concept, Darken derived a relation between an interdiffusion coefficient and intrinsic diffusion coefficients in a binary interdiffusion in 1948. At present, however, it is revealed that the so-called Darken equation itself is mathematically wrong in the derivation process. Although the concentration of diffusion particles is a real quantity in physics, the temperature is a thermodynamic state quantity. As far as the shape of heat conduction material is unchangeable during a thermal treatment, the coordinate system of heat equation set in a material is a fixed one, since the coordinate system is not influenced by variations of the material internal structure. On the other hand, strictly speaking, the coordinate system of diffusion equation set in the <b>diffusion</b> <b>field</b> (solvent) is a moving one, since the origin of coordinate system is generally influenced by such variations.|$|E

Our work is motivated by the following issue often encountered in sensor network sampling, namely increasing the temporal sampling density is often easier and less expensive than increasing the spatial sampling density of the network. For the case of sampling a <b>diffusion</b> <b>field,</b> we show that, to achieve trade-off between spatial and temporal sampling, the spatial arrangement of the sensors must satisfy certain conditions. We provide in this paper the precise relationships between the achievable reduction of spatial sampling density, the required temporal oversampling rate, the spatial arrangement of the sensors, and the bound for the condition numbers of the resulting sampling and reconstruction procedures.

40|$|Abstract. The Interdependence Theory {{is based}} on the concept that grain {{refinement}} of an alloy during the initial transient of solidification is governed by the simultaneous occurrence of growth of an already nucleated grain and the associated Constitutional Supercooling (CS) developing ahead of the growing grain. Nucleation of a new grain occurs when the maximum CS attained {{at the end of the}} <b>diffusion</b> <b>field</b> of the solute rejected in front of the growing grain, is larger than the nucleation undercooling ∆Tn of an inoculant particle present ahead of this point. The amount of grain growth plus the length of the <b>diffusion</b> <b>field</b> constitute the Nucleation-Free Zone (NFZ). The mathematical form of this theory is an analytical model which has been shown to be sensitive to the value of the growth rate v of the solid-liquid interface chosen to predict the as-cast grain size. This work presents the development and application of a varying growth rate expression rather than a constant growth rate used in the analytical model to improve its agreement with µMatIC, a numerical model of solidification which has been shown to effectively model grain growth and the evolution of the <b>diffusion</b> <b>field.</b> The possible range of values of growth rate that occurs during initial growth of a grain is obtained from numerical simulations.

30|$|Our {{motivation}} for considering <b>diffusion</b> <b>fields</b> {{is based on}} the fact that <b>diffusion</b> <b>fields</b> provide a suitable model for numerous natural phenomena in biology, physics and engineering: from the release of pollutants [8], to the modeling of biochemical leakages and nuclear wastes[9]. Our main focus is on the problem of estimating the sources of <b>diffusion</b> <b>fields</b> using spatiotemporal sensor measurements of the field. Such fields are spatially non-bandlimited, thus require an extremely dense set of samples in order to achieve any useful reconstruction of the field using classical linear reconstruction techniques. Consequently, considerable research efforts, from the signal processing community, have gone towards devising robust sensor data fusion schemes for diffusion field/source estimation. Many centralized solutions to this field/source estimation problem, such as [10 – 20], have been recently proposed. It is well known however that centralized estimation strategies over sensor networks can be vulnerable to single point failures, for instance, the network becomes inoperational if the fusion center (FC) fails. In addition, communicating with the FC typically involves long-range transmission from the sensor nodes which can result in bottlenecks due to contention. To this end, some decentralized and fully distributed algorithms have been proposed in the literature, where the aim has been to improve the network’s robustness to node failures whilst also reducing transmission costs by relying only on local communication between nodes. Lu and Vetterli, for example, propose a distributed adaptive sampling scheme [21], and van Waterschoot and Leus [22] develop a distributed scheme based on finite element method. A distributed field reconstruction method using hybrid shift-invariant spaces is proposed in [23], whilst a distributed extension of standard compressed sensing techniques is developed in [24].|$|R

The width of the needle decreases with increasing strength of drift. The angle between the needle and the plate is about 45 ° at high flow rate.

A detailed study of fluxes through the diffusive boundary layer (DBL) therefore requires concurrent information on the surface structure. Using natural sediment in a laboratory flume, we investigated the impact of small-scale sediment topography on diffusive oxygen flux through the DBL. Topographic maps of the sediment surface with 0. 1 mm horizontal resolution were acquired with a custom-made optical technique, and immediately afterward the oxygen <b>diffusion</b> <b>field</b> across the sediment-water interface was measured with microsensors in known orientation within the described topography. A method was developed to calculate the three-dimensional diffusive flux through the DBL, based on the combination of vertical O- 2 microprofiles and the high-resolution topographic data. Even though the sediment surface investigated was elaborately sculptured by fauna, the combined influence of increased surface area and horizontal concentration gradients within the DBL induced less than 10 % difference between one-dimensional and three-dimensional diffusive flux calculations. The relatively low impact of surface topography is explained by the geometry of the <b>diffusion</b> <b>field,</b> as well as effects of the rapid diffusion of O- 2 at small scales...|$|E

In this paper, we study the problem of estimating these sources (including their intensities, spatial locations, and activation time) from the spatiotemporal samples taken by a network of spatially distributed sensors.

For the case of known activation time, we present an annihilating filter based method to estimate the Euclidean distances between the sources and sensors, which can be subsequently used to localize the sources. For the case of a single source but with unknown activation time, we show that the <b>diffusion</b> <b>field</b> at any spatial location is a scaled and shifted version of a common prototype function, and that this function is the unique solution to a particular differential equation. This observation leads to an efficient algorithm that can estimate the unknown parameters of the source by solving a system of linear equations.
