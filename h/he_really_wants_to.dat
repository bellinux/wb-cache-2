500|$|... "Moment of Surrender" [...] {{was well}} {{received}} by critics {{after the release}} of No Line on the Horizon. David Fricke of Rolling Stone enjoyed the song, writing, [...] "The rising-falling effect of the harmony voices around Bono... is a perfect picture of where <b>he</b> <b>really</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> be, when he gets to the line about 'vision over visibility.'" [...] Blender considered it the high-point of the album, comparing it to the band's 1987 single [...] "I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For". Reviewer Rob Sheffield complimented the melding of bass, guitar, and vocals, calling it [...] "the kind of gimme-divinity anthem that U2 cut their teeth on, except it really does seem like they've gotten better at these songs now that they've picked up some bummed-out adult grit. Bono actually sounds scared of something in this song, and whether his nightmares are religious or sexual, the fear gives his voice some heft." [...] NME felt that it was the [...] "most impressive" [...] song on the album, describing it as a [...] "gorgeously sparse prayer built around Adam Clayton's heartbeat bassline and Bono's rough growl", and noting that despite its seven-minute length, it did not feel too long. Alexis Petridis of The Guardian was more critical of the song, saying it [...] "doesn't have enough of a tune to support the full seven-minute gospel treatment", a sentiment that The Times agreed with.|$|E

He confirmed to a Norwegian newspaper that he had been correctly quoted. The Norwegian minister of labour and migration, Bjarne Håkon Hanssen, responded that Krekar could leave at any time and that he would be given [...] "travel documents within the day. He'll also get money for airline tickets, taxi cab, and the whole deal. If <b>he</b> <b>really</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> go, that is." [...] Krekar is still living in Norway.|$|E

"But {{if he is}} sharp, father, and <b>he</b> <b>really</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> buy the ship," [...] {{returned}} Rosey, thoughtfully, [...] "it's {{only because}} he knows it's valuable property, and not because he likes it as we do. He can't take that value away even if we don't sell it to him, {{and all the while}} we have the comfort of the dear old Pontiac, don't you see?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The same evening, Tierney {{wrote to}} Dot Blake, {{and said in}} a postscript, [...] "I know you care for Ballindine; so do I, but I don't write to him.

[...] It would be imputed, I suppose, to some vague generality, to inattention to religious duties, to idolatry of the world, and so forth. But a Romish priest {{would be the last}} person, I should think, who could tell him fairly, in the present case, the cause of his affliction; and I question whether he would give a patient hearing to any one who told it him.' ...|$|E

On {{the other}} hand, the {{elimination}} of Comrade Repetto is pleasant. I know few men whom I would not rather meet on a lonely road than Comrade Repetto. He is one of nature's black-jackers.

But, once started, he is unable to resist the craving. The thing grips him like dram-drinking. He black-jacks now not because <b>he</b> <b>really</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to,</b> but because he cannot help himself.

"The sheik was declaiming {{against the}} obstinacy of his followers. <b>He</b> <b>really</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> take you, {{and was in}} vain trying to persuade his men that such clever people as the whites could {{disguise}} themselves {{so that they would}} not be known. The two men protested against the risk, and maintained that anyone could tell a white from a native a mile off. Really the sheik did not suspect you in the slightest, but I thought it was well to let him have a triumph over his followers, and so as he was going on I gave a little nod towards you and he caught it at once; but I could see at first he thought he was mistaken, and while the others were having their say I nodded to him and said, 'Yes it is he.'" ...|$|E

It's like the new edition of an old book that one has been fond of--revised and amended, brought up to date, but not quite the thing one knew and loved. However that may be at all events," [...] he pursued, [...] "I don't think, you know, that he's really playing, as you call it, any game. I believe <b>he</b> <b>really</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> go back and take up a career. He's capable of one, you know, that will improve and enlarge him still more. He won't then," [...] little Bilham {{continued}} to remark, [...] "be my pleasant well-rubbed old-fashioned volume at all. But of course I'm beastly immoral. I'm afraid {{it would be a}} funny world altogether--a world with things the way I like them. I ought, I dare say, to go home and go into business myself. Only I'd simply rather die--simply. And I've not the least difficulty in making up my mind not to, and in knowing exactly why, and in defending my ground against all comers. All the same," [...] he wound up, [...] "I assure you I don't say a word against it--for himself, I mean--to Chad. I seem to see it as much the best thing for him. You see he's not happy." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{next great}} benevolent {{movement}} is the ragged school system. From a miserable hole in Field Lane, {{they have grown}} up to a hundred and sixteen in number. Of these Lord Shaftesbury says, [...] "They have produced--I speak seriously--some {{of the most beautiful}} fruits that ever grew upon the tree of life. I believe that from the teachers and from the children, though many are now gone to their rest, might have been, and might still be, selected some of the most pure, simple, affectionate specimens of Christianity the world ever saw." [...] Growing out of the ragged school is an institution of most interesting character, called [...] "a place for repentance." [...] It had its origin in the efforts of a young man, a Mr. Nash, to reform two of his pupils. They said they wished to be honest, but had nothing to eat, and must steal to live. Though poor himself, he invited them to his humble abode, and shared with them his living. Other pupils, hearing of this, desired to join with them, and become honest too. Soon he had six. Now, the honest scholars in the ragged school, seeing what was going on, of their own accord began to share their bread with this little band, and to contribute their pennies. Gradually the number increased. Benevolent individuals noticed it, and supplies flowed in, until at last it has grown to be an establishment in which several hundreds are seeking reformation. To prevent imposition, a rigid probation is prescribed. Fourteen days the applicant feeds on bread and water, in solitary confinement, with the door unfastened, so that he can depart at any moment. If he goes through with that ordeal it is thought <b>he</b> <b>really</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> be honest, and he is admitted a member. After sufficient time spent in the institution to form correct habits, assistance is given him to emigrate to some of the colonies, to commence life, as it were, anew. Lord Shaftesbury has taken a deep interest in this establishment; and among other affecting letters received from its colonists in Australia, is one to him, commencing, [...] "Kind Lord Ashley," [...] in which the boy says, [...] "I wish your lordship would send out more boys, and use your influence to convert all the prisons into ragged schools. As soon as I get a farm I shall call it after your name." ...|$|E
