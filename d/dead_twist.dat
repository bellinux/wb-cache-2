40|$|Objective: The {{aim of this}} {{in vitro}} study was to {{determine}} the load and deflection at failure of different lingual retainers bonded with composite to enamel in a standardized three-point bending test. The results were rationalized with finite element analysis (FEA) models. Materials and methods: Four types of multistranded wires, <b>Dead</b> Soft Respond, <b>Twisted</b> ligature, Penta-One, Gold-plated Penta-One, and two glass fibre-reinforced composite retainers, Fibre 07 and Fibre 09, were bonded to enamel with composite and submitted to a three-point bending test. The load and deflection at failure and the mode of debonding were recorded. The stiffness of the wires was determined and all experimental data were used in FEA models to rationalize the observed values and mode of debonding. Results: Significant higher load and deflection were found for the most flexible retainers <b>Twisted</b> ligature and <b>Dead</b> Soft Respond. All retainers failed between the wire and composite, which was confirmed by FEA showing the highest stress in the composite around the retainer. The FEA models showed that the amount of composite used for bonding the retainers should be 2 - 4 mm. Conclusions: Based on the in vitro results, optimal bonding of lingual retainers can be achieved by flexible retainers, bonded with intrinsically strong composites. According to the FEA models the retainer should be bonded with 2 - 4 mm composite, leaving the critical ‘free-wire’ length for the success of the retainer system...|$|R
60|$|All {{this time}} {{the voices of the}} watch on deck chatting and {{laughing}} {{at the other end of}} the ship were distinctly audible, and I could see them gathered in a group, little dreaming of the dark doings which were going on within thirty yards of them. Oh! That I could have given them one word of warning, even though I had lost my life in doing it! but it was impossible. The moon was shining fitfully through the scattered clouds, and I could see the silvery gleam of the surge, and beyond it the vast weird desert with its fantastic sand-hills. Glancing down, I saw that the man who had been crouching on the deck was still lying there, and as I gazed at him a flickering ray of moonlight fell full upon his upturned face. Great heaven! even now, when more than twelve years have elapsed, my hand trembles as I write that, in spite of distorted features and projecting eyes, I recognised the face of Harton, the cheery young clerk who had been my companion during the voyage.

40|$|Curved and skewed I-girder bridges exhibit {{torsional}} displacements of {{the individual}} girders and of the overall bridge cross-section under dead loads. As a result, the girder webs can be plumb in only one configuration. If the structure is built such that the webs are plumb in the ideal no-load position, they generally cannot be plumb under {{the action of the}} structure's steel or total <b>dead</b> load; hence, <b>twisting</b> of the girders is unavoidable under dead loads. The deflected geometry resulting from these torsional displacements can impact the fit-up of the members, the erection requirements (crane positions and capacities, the number of temporary supports, tie down requirements, etc.), the bearing cost and type, and the overall strength of the structure. Furthermore, significant layover may be visually objectionable, particularly at piers and abutments. If the torsional deflections are large enough, then the cross-frames are typically detailed to compensate for them, either partially or fully. As specified in Article C 6. 7. 2 of the AASHTO LRFD Specifications, different types of cross-frame detailing methods are used to achieve theoretically plumb webs under the no-load, steel dead load, or total dead load conditions. Each of the cross-frame detailing methods has ramifications on the behavior and constructability of a bridge. Currently, there is much confusion and divergence of opinion in the bridge industry regarding the stage at which steel I girder webs should be ideally plumb and the consequences of out-of-plumbness at other stages. Furthermore, concerns are often raised about potential fit-up problems during steel erection as well as the control of the final deck geometry (e. g., cross-slopes and joint alignment). These influences and ramifications of cross-frame detailing need to be investigated and explained so that resulting field problems leading to needless construction delays and legal claims can be avoided. This dissertation addresses the influence of cross-frame detailing on curved and/or skewed steel I girder bridges during steel erection and concrete deck placement by conducting comprehensive analytical studies. Procedures to determine the lack-of-fit forces due to dead load fit (DLF) detailing are developed {{to assess the impact of}} different types of cross-frame detailing. The studies include benchmarking of refined analytical models against selected full scale experimental tests and field measurements. These analytical models are then utilized to study a variety of practical combinations and permutations of bridge parameters pertaining to horizontal curvature and skew effects. This research develops and clarifies procedures and provides new knowledge with respect to the impact of cross-frame detailing methods on: 1) constructed bridge geometries, 2) cross-frame forces, 3) girder stresses, 4) system strengths, 5) potential uplift at bearings, and 6) fit-up during erection. These developments provide the basis for the development of refined guidelines for: 1) practices to alleviate fit-up difficulties during erection, 2) selection of cross-frame detailing methods as a function of I-girder bridge geometry characteristics, and 3) procedures to calculate the locked-in forces due to DLF cross-frame detailing.

40|$| Histological {{reactions}} {{as part of}} the endoradicular {{influences of}} Tagetes on penetrated nematodes are not conspicuous. Tagetes cultures, unlike most other plants, normally grow well and have well-developed root systems without discoloration in soils with dense populations of Meloidogyne and Pratylenchus spp. Despite this healthy appearance Tagetes roots may show barely visible histological reactions after such nematode infestations. M. hapla larvae penetrate the root apex of T. patula {{in much the same way}} as that of tomato. They do not normally develop nor cause marked necrosis or swelling in the roots of T. patula. Occasionally, however, small syncytia or sometimes even small galls occur associated with a developing larva. Unlike tomato, T. patula develops few and very small syncytia and galls and only slowly, and the nematode often dies and syncytia often abort in T. patula. P. penetrans penetrates young roots of T. patula, T. minuta and red clover at random sites on their surface except at the apex and causes cortical lesions in all three plants. The lesions in T. patula are small, dark and necrotic but do not abort from surrounding cortex tissue; they normally harbour only 1 - 3 nematodes, often <b>dead,</b> dying or <b>twisted.</b> In T. minuta the lesions appear slower, are larger and less dark than in T. patula; the number of nematodes per lesion may be up to 38 and often occur outside lesions. Red clover lesions appear still slower, are usually larger and contain a large breeding population. Histological reactions, therefore, largely coincide with nematode development. The endoradicular effects are apparently instrumental in the nematode suppression by Tagetes spp. They are incorporated in or super-imposed upon the common plant-nematode relationships which are different for each association and may therefore influence the result. It is suggested that the special nematicidal principle in Tagetes is made up of more components, of which thiophenes recorded up to now from T. erecta, and that the components or their relative weights vary between Tagetes spp. Some other Compositae related closely to Tagetes spp. were also found to be effective against P. penetrans and also contained the same thiophenes as found in Tagetes or hitherto unidentified active principles. T. patula is probably superior to other Tagetes spp. in its effect against P. penetrans because necrosis appears earlier and more acutely. This may be a consequence of more rapid intoxication of the nematodes, as in root extracts. Ectoparasitic cortex feeders of the genus Tylenchorynchus are affected less and root-vessel feeders are evidently not influenced by the nematicidal principles in Tagetes roots, probably because they do not undergo the same type or degree of contact with the Tagetes tissue. The Tagetes effect, therefore, seems to be generally strong for endoparasitic root nematodes or cortical feeders, but varies even within this group with the different plant-nematode associations. The agricultural value of Tagetes as a source of organic matter, stains, therapeutics, or other chemicals, and as ornamentals is limited and has up to now supported only small-scale cultivation. The use of Tagetes crops for suppression of plant nematodes and the marked growth improvement obtained in main crops, is handicapped by the lack of value of the crop. Furthermore Tagetes spp. and cultivars are limited in their agricultural applicability. Nematode suppression is the primary determinant of their practical value so that T. patula particularly the cultivars Golden Harmony or Harmony are recommended. They are more effective against Pratylenchus and at least as effective against Meloidogyne populations, and appear to be as good or better than other Tagetes cultivars for growing and handling as a crop. Seed characteristics, rapid development as an autumn crop and winter-hardiness could all be improved, whereas a search for profitable use of the crop is desirable. Breeding of Tagetes spp. have resulted in a great assortment of ornamentals, and prospects seem good for the plant breeder of combining strong nematicidal effect with useful agricultural properties. The desired characters will depend on the type of agriculture. Tagetes grown as a full-season crop has been found effective by several workers and may cause striking growth and yield increments, it may find use in areas where valuable main crops are grown and where land rent is low, as in some tropical and subtropical countries. Tagetes as a spring crop does not seem promising in temperate climates due to its slow seedling growth. Even when sown densely, 10 cm apart on 15 May, minimum densities of Pratylenchus could be achieved only after about 2 months; these densities appear later when greater plant distances are taken (Fig. 10). Tagetes grown as an autumn crop has better possibilities. The degree of development of autumn Tagetes is evidently critical for its effect, and this varies strongly from year to year. Autumn Tagetes may be very effective in nematode suppression as well as in yield increase of main plants in certain years (Tables 23, 24 and 25), but the earliest sowing dates after an early pea crop varied in the period 1961 - 1968 from 6 July to 14 August, and a good development was obtained in only 4 out of 8 years (Table 6). Continuous autumn Tagetes, however, may be effective despite failure in certain years. Autumn Tagetes should be sown not later than the end of July and 10 rather than 25 cm apart is advisable. Simultaneous culture of Tagetes with a main crop appeared to be effective around and between trees and woody ornamentals and may be promising in more cases, especially since sowing at 60 cm apart completely suppressed nematodes, though slower than when closer sown. Sowing between rows is practized incidentally (Plate IIC and D). Sowing under cereals and other high crops to give the crop a quicker start after harvesting the main crop has not so far been promising, because only few weak plants survived. Autumn application after a main crop and application between rows of a main crop may be promising under certain conditions. The technical possibilities increase when climatic conditions allow a better growth in the autumn or when agricultural systems allow a full-season crop. Yield of main crops after Tagetes may be increased by nematological or other growth factors or both. Tagetes promoted growth of apple seedlings in soil with P. penetrans to 167 % of fallow infested soil, though Tagetes decreased growth in uninfested soil; allowance for the nitrogen used by Tagetes would lead to a higher growth promotion in infested soil (Table 27). The decline in nematode population continued markedly after the growth of Tagetes had been disrupted by removal of the tops. Direct mulch with a natural dosage of Tagetes roots suppresses P. penetrans much better than other mulches or fallow. It is probable that there is a significant aftereffect also under field conditions. Leaf mulches were also effective in suppressing P. penetrans, but Tagetes leaves were less effective than apple and no specific nematicidal effect of Tagetes leaves could be demonstrated. The results in uninfested soil show that cultivation of Tagetes and removal of tops decreases soil fertility in unfertilized soil (Table 27). The addition of root or leaf mulch generally increases soil fertility and therefore growth of test plants (Tables 30, 31, 32). These effects, however, are unspecific, and would have been smaller in fertilized soils, uninfested or infested. The dominance of nematicidal over non- nematicidal effects of Tagetes is clear for the growth of apple seedlings in soil infested with P. penetrans. The relative weight of these factors may of course be different in other plant nematode relationships. Our results, therefore, confirm or substantiate the marked Tagetes effect, but also the variation between plant-nematode relationships. The Tagetes effect is exceptional in nature, though not completely restricted to the genus Tagetes because it does occur in some genera ofthe Heleniae. The effect appears to be centred inside the roots and is evidently correlated with the presence in these plants of strongly nematicidal thiophenes, which are rare elsewhere in nature. The fact that it is conspicuous against endoparasitic polyphagous root nematodes and not against epidermal and vessel feeders is understandable from the difference in parasitic way of life. Histopathological reactions to nematode invasion vary between Tagetes spp. This may explain the stronger effect of T. patula on P. penetrans than of other Tagetes spp. The concept of nematode intoxication by nematicidal thiophenes and histopathological resistance phenomena may be interrelated and are not necessarily contradictory. Use of Tagetes spp. often markedly increases yield of main crops, but is limited by type of agriculture. In temperate regions Tagetes grown simultaneously with the main crop or grown in the autumn after the main crop is considered promising. Slow seedling growth, high light requirement and frost susceptibility of available cultivars are disadvantages. Tagetes has better prospects in tropical and subtropical agriculture...|$|R
