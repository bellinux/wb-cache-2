50|$|Batting pads {{are just}} one of the several {{protective}} layers worn by modern-day cricketers while batting. Other pads on the legs include a special <b>knee</b> <b>roll</b> to protect the knees or a thigh pad to protect the upper region of the leg. Within the professional game, players often insert extra padding beneath their pads to limit the impact from fast deliveries which can range in speed from 80 to 100 mph.|$|E
50|$|Cricket pads first {{appeared}} in the mid 18th century in England. They were developed to protect {{the lower part of the}} legs from the hard leather ball that was used to bowl deliveries in the game. The development of pads led to a change in the Laws of Cricket with the addition of the dismissal for LBW. It was introduced in 1774 because batsmen had begun using their pads to deflect balls away from their wickets. Batting pads protect the shins, knees and the lower thigh. At the base, there is a slot for the foot. Traditional pads were made from canvas which had cotton stuffing inserted between stitched-in cane wood strips that ran vertically up to the <b>knee</b> <b>roll.</b> The material would then be painted white with water-soluble canvas paint. Leather buckles were used to bind the pad to the leg. These natural material pads were quite heavy. By contrast, modern day pads are now made from durable and ultra light synthetic materials such as PVC for the outer and polyesters for the lining. Most pads use three velcro fastening straps making them easily adjustable and removable.|$|E

5000|$|In the Mishnah, the {{following}} manner of burning the criminal is described: The obligatory procedure for execution by burning: They immersed him in dung up to his <b>knees,</b> <b>rolled</b> a rough cloth into a soft one and wound it about his neck. One pulled it one way, one the other until he opened his mouth. Thereupon one ignites the (lead) wick and throws it in his mouth, and it descends to his bowels and sears his bowels.|$|R
5000|$|Initially {{the stock}} saddle was a [...] "park" [...] style saddle {{similar to the}} modern English showing saddle, with low set <b>knee</b> <b>rolls</b> and short flaps. However, this style of saddle did not suit the rugged Australian terrain and did little protect the rider’s legs from sweat. Thus the flaps were lengthened, thigh and knee pads added, the seat deepened and the cantle raised. A saddlemaker named Jack Wieneke {{developed}} a design that was popular {{for a number of}} years, but the design over time became too extreme and lost favour to more conservative styles.|$|R
50|$|The {{snowplough}} turn, {{also known}} as a wedge turn or the pizza slice, is a downhill skiing braking and turning technique taught to beginners. The front ski tips of the skis are together and the tails wide apart, with the <b>knees</b> <b>rolled</b> inwards slightly. By applying pressure against the snow with the inside edges of the skis speed is reduced, making turning in such a configuration and stopping completely possible. To turn, weight is shifted from the downhill, outside-of-the-turn ski to the uphill, inside-of-the-turn ski. As the turn is completed, the old uphill, inside ski then becomes the new downhill, outside ski.|$|R
5000|$|The English {{hunting saddle}} is the {{predecessor}} of all English-type riding saddles. As the sports of show jumping and eventing became more popular, saddle shape changed. Caprilli, Santini, and Toptani developed the [...] "forward seat," [...] {{in which the}} rider uses shorter stirrups and keeps his legs under him as he rode in two-point, with his seat bones hovering above the saddle. The shorter stirrup required a more forward flap, to match the greater knee angle of the rider. The protruding stirrup bars were uncomfortable in this new position, so they were recessed. The waist of the saddle was also made narrower. Additionally, padding was placed under the <b>knee</b> <b>rolls,</b> for extra security.|$|R
5000|$|The jumping saddle, {{sometimes}} called a [...] "forward seat" [...] or [...] "close contact" [...] saddle, {{is designed for}} show jumping, hunt seat equitation, foxhunting, and the show jumping and cross-country phases of eventing. Its most distinctive feature is a forward-cut flap that allows for a shorter stirrup length (although not as short as racing stirrups). The flap often has supportive padded <b>knee</b> <b>rolls,</b> especially for show jumping and cross-country, less so for equitation. The balance of the seat is further back and comparatively flat, with the cantle and pommel low {{so that they do}} not interfere with the rider's jumping position (and variations known as [...] "two-point position" [...] or [...] "half-seat").|$|R
50|$|Supportive padding in the seat, {{size and}} shape of <b>knee</b> <b>rolls</b> and the use of {{additional}} blocks behind the leg is also considered when developing a saddle. While a polo saddle is constructed with a minimum of padding so as to allow the polo player great freedom to twist and reach for his shot, a saddle used for jumping or eventing may have more padding to help give the rider support over fences. Another development is the monoflap saddle, in which both the sweat flap and saddle flap are made of lighter weight leather, stitched together around the edges leaving only a passgae point for the girth straps, thus reducing the thickness of leather between the rider and the horse, and giving a closer feel, while still protecting the horse's skin from straps.|$|R
5000|$|The {{following}} year, they {{recorded for}} Modern Records, and in 1948 for the Specialty and Supreme labels. However, Wynn's records were not commercially successful, {{and he began}} working as a sideman in T-Bone Walker's band, mainly playing the baritone saxophone. By the late 1940s, Wynn had developed an innovative performance style, involving dancing, stomping, and playing the saxophone while laying on his back. One reviewer said: [...] "He would kick, dance, shuffle, strut, go down on his <b>knees,</b> <b>roll</b> and literally provide his own mini-show on stage, all the while blowing wild solos on his sax. He {{was the first of}} the Los Angeles area sax players to perform these antics on stage...". [...] Wynn himself said: [...] "Jay McNeely was a little kid when he used to come in and watch me play at weekends. Two or three years later he was laying on his back and playing. He's a great musician but he got the clowning from me." ...|$|R
50|$|When performed, the toe {{should be}} {{the last part of}} the foot to leave the ground and the first part to hit it again. Although the step is a dynamic movement, care should be taken to step {{smoothly}} so as not to interrupt the air flow of wind instrumentalists. As the glide step rolls the foot from the heel to the toe, marchers executing the ankle <b>knee</b> step <b>roll</b> the foot from the toe to the heel.|$|R
60|$|It {{struck me}} that the air might be better nearer the floor, and I proved it when I dropped {{on my hands and}} <b>knees.</b> I <b>rolled</b> Uchino out of his {{blankets}} with a quick jerk, wrapped the blankets about my head, face, and mouth, arose to my feet, and dashed for'ard into the hall. After a couple of collisions with the wood-work I again dropped to the floor and rearranged the blankets so that, while my mouth remained covered, I could draw or withdraw, a thickness across my eyes.|$|R
60|$|For a time {{it seemed}} to Tarzan that Buto, the rhinoceros, would prove victor in the gory battle. Already had he {{accounted}} for four of the seven lions and badly wounded the three remaining when in a momentary lull in the encounter he sank limply to his <b>knees</b> and <b>rolled</b> over upon his side. Tarzan's spear had done its work. It was the man-made weapon which killed the great beast that might easily have survived the assault of seven mighty lions, for Tarzan's spear had pierced the great lungs, and Buto, with victory almost in sight, succumbed to internal hemorrhage.|$|R
50|$|The {{pay-per-view}} broadcast {{began with}} Bray Wyatt defeating Daniel Bryan. Early in the match, the referee saw Bray's Wyatt Family members Luke Harper and Erick Rowan attempting to interfere, so he ejected them from ringside. During the match, Wyatt targeted Bryan's head, ramming {{it into the}} ring-post. Bryan later mounted a comeback with a running tornado DDT off the ring apron, planting Wyatt's head on the floor. Wyatt managed to escape Bryan's Yes! Lock submission hold by biting Bryan's hand. To avoid Bryan's running <b>knee,</b> Wyatt <b>rolled</b> {{out of the ring}} to the floor. Bryan then attempted a Suicide Dive but Wyatt caught him and executed a Sister Abigail into the barricade. After another Sister Abigail in the ring, Wyatt scored the pinfall victory.|$|R
60|$|One fawn only {{followed}} her. The other {{took a step}} or two, sank to his <b>knees,</b> and <b>rolled</b> over on his side. When {{the wolves}} drew near quietly, {{without a trace of}} the ferocity or the howling clamor with which such scenes are usually pictured, the game was quite dead, one quick snap of the old wolf's teeth just behind the fore legs having pierced the heart more surely than a hunter's bullet. And the mother caribou, plunging wildly away through the brush with the startled fawn jumping at her heels, could not know that her mad flight was needless; that the terrible enemy which had spared her and let her go free had no need nor desire to follow.|$|R
60|$|Now {{there were}} a number of the archers of Sir Mellegrans lying hidden in the rocks at the sides of that pass. These, seeing how that battle was going and that Sir Launcelot had driven back their companions, {{straightway}} fitted arrows to their bows and began shooting at the horse of Sir Launcelot. Against these archers Sir Launcelot could in no wise defend his horse, wherefore the steed was presently sorely wounded and began plunging and snorting in pain so that Sir Launcelot could hardly hold him in check. And still the archers shot arrow after arrow until by and by the life began to go out of the horse. Then after a while the good steed fell down upon his <b>knees</b> and <b>rolled</b> over into the dust; for he was so sorely wounded that he could no longer stand.|$|R
60|$|The {{hippopotamus}} {{was indeed}} exhausted, and allowed {{itself to be}} dragged ashore at the next effort without opposition. As soon as it did so he was attacked with spears by the hunters, Jethro, and the boys. The latter found that {{they were unable to}} drive their weapons through the thick skin, and betook themselves to their bows and arrows. The hunters, however, knew the points at which the skin was thinnest, and drove their spears deep into the animal just behind the fore leg, while the boys shot their arrows at its mouth. Another noose had been thrown over its head as it issued from the water, and the peasants pulling on the ropes prevented it from charging. Three or four more thrusts were given from the hunters; then one of the spears touched a vital part--the hippopotamus sank on its <b>knees</b> and <b>rolled</b> over dead.|$|R
5000|$|Goaltenders wear special leg pads {{to protect}} their legs and knees. Leg pads have evolved {{significantly}} over the years. The earliest leg pads were {{very similar to the}} cricket pads from which they were adopted. They were constructed of leather and stuffed with deer hair. In the 1930s, leg pads became more specialized, becoming wider and thicker. In the 1940s, an extra roll of material, called a skip-over roll, was added to the outside edge of each pad face, extending from the lowest point of the pad covering the foot, called the boot break, to just below the <b>knee</b> <b>rolls.</b> In the 1950s, the skip-over roll was extended to {{the very top of the}} leg pad. In the 1980s, additional padding was added to protect the inside areas of the legs and knees. Toe foils, a plastic shield that was affixed to the bottom outside edge of the goalie pad, began to be used but were later not allowed by equipment regulations. Leg pad design and construction remained static until the 1990s when synthetic leathers and high density foams began to be used in pad construction. Advantages of synthetic materials were lighter weight, lower cost, a quick break-in period, and leg pads that could be manufactured in the colors of the goaltender's team. Some leg pad manufacturers replaced the leather toe strap with a toe bridge to affix the front of the leg pad to the front of the goalie skate. Starting around 2000, the [...] "box" [...] style leg pads became popular as goaltending playing technique evolved to a blocking style versus the reacting style of the past. In the [...] "box" [...] style pad, the edge between the pad face and the pad inside edge is square, keeping the pad face more perpendicular with the ice surface and maximizing the blocking area when the goaltender is in the [...] "butterfly" [...] position. Currently, ice hockey regulations require that leg pads be no wider than 11 in and can be no longer than 38 in. The NHL has also brought in rules stating that each goaltender will be measured for height, and then the height of allowable pads will be calculated in proportion to the height of the goaltender.|$|R
50|$|The spur is {{a refined}} tool, {{designed}} to allow the rider to transmit very subtle signals to the horse that are nearly invisible to any other observer. No matter the discipline, {{it is important that}} a rider has a correct position before using spurs, with a deep seat, legs lengthened to the extent allowed by the stirrups, heels down, with <b>knees</b> and thighs <b>rolled</b> in so that the rider has a solid base of support. A swinging or unstable leg may inadvertently jab the horse with the spur as the rider sits, thus irritating, distracting, or frightening the animal, and chronic misuse may deaden the horse to the leg aids. Improper use may also provoke dangerous or undesirable behaviors such as bucking or running away.|$|R
6000|$|... [Sidenote: Sir Tristram slays Sir Andred] At that {{blow the}} rage of Sir Tristram so flamed up in him that his eyes burned as with pure green fire. And in an instant, so quickly that no man wist what he did, he turned with amazing suddenness upon that knight who stood at his left hand, and he lifted up both hands that were bound, and he smote that knight such a blow upon the face that the knight fell down upon the ground and his sword fell out of his hand. Then Sir Tristram {{snatched}} the sword and, turning with astonishing quickness, he smote the knight upon his right hand such a buffet that he instantly fell down upon his <b>knees</b> and then <b>rolled</b> over upon {{the ground in a}} swoon. Then Sir Tristram turned upon Sir Andred, and lifting high the sword with both hands tied, he smote him so terrible a blow that the blade cut through his epulier and half through his body as far as the paps. At that great terrible blow the breath fled out of Sir Andred with a deep groan, and he fell down upon the ground and immediately died.|$|R
5000|$|This saddle {{is used in}} the United Kingdom, Australia, and elsewhere, {{for showing}} on the flat or over low fences, and is a direct {{descendant}} of the English hunting saddle. The show saddle is designed to show off the horse's conformation, most notably the shoulder, and is therefore a minimal saddle with a close fit and straight-cut flap. The seat is very flat, and there are no <b>knee</b> or thigh <b>rolls,</b> so the saddle offers little support to the rider. Like the American Saddle Seat saddle, the English showing saddle has a stirrup bar set farther forward and a cutback pommel that falls behind rather than over the withers, though the seat is less flat and the rider's center of balance is closer to that of a dressage saddle. Many show horses are also presented in fatter condition than in more athletic disciplines, so the billets are placed to help keep the saddle properly placed on a rounder animal, with the foremost billet on show pony saddles frequently being attached directly to the point of the front arch of the tree; this is known as a [...] "forward point".|$|R
60|$|This is {{the great}} duel between the single man and the bull. The matador advances, sword in hand, with the muleta, the red cloth for the passes, over his arm. Under the president's box {{he takes off his}} hat, and with fine gesture makes a grandiloquent speech, wherein he vows either to conquer or to die: the harangue is {{finished}} with a wheel round and a dramatic flinging of his hat to attendants {{on the other side of}} the barrier. He pensively walks forward. All eyes are upon him--and he knows it. He motions his companions to stand back and goes close to the bull. He is quite alone, with his life in his hands--a slender figure, very handsome in the gorgeous costume glittering with fine gold. He arranges the muleta over a little stick, so that it hangs down like a flag and conceals his sword. Then quite solemnly he walks up to the bull, holding the red rag in his left hand. The bull watches suspiciously, suddenly charges, and the muleta is passed over its head; the matador does not move a muscle, the bull turns and stands quite motionless. Another charge, another pass. And so he continues, making seven or eight of various sorts, to the growing approbation of the public. At last it is time to kill. With great caution he withdraws the sword; the bull looks warily. He makes two or three passes more and walks round till he gets the animal into proper position: the forefeet must be set squarely on the ground. 'Ora! Ora!' cry the people. 'Now! Now!' The bull is well placed. The matador draws the sword back a little and takes careful aim. The bull rushes, and at the same moment the man makes one bound forward and buries the sword to the hilt between the brute's shoulders. It falls to its <b>knees</b> and <b>rolls</b> over.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is very interesting," [...] she said, with a sigh, and then, suddenly; [...] "Look, Ghek!" [...] {{and pointed}} quickly {{back in the}} {{direction}} of the tower. The kaldane, still holding her turned half away from her to look in the direction she had indicated and simultaneously, with the quickness of a banth, she struck him with her right fist, backed by every ounce of strength she possessed--struck the back of the pulpy head just above the collar. The blow was sufficient to accomplish her design, dislodging the kaldane from its rykor and tumbling it to the ground. Instantly the grasp upon her wrist relaxed as the body, no longer controlled by the brain of Ghek, stumbled aimlessly about for an instant before it sank to its <b>knees</b> and then <b>rolled</b> over on its back; but Tara of Helium waited not to note the full results of her act. The instant the fingers loosened upon her wrist she broke away and dashed toward the hills. Simultaneously a warning whistle broke from Ghek's lips and in instant response the workers leaped to their feet, one almost in the girl's path. She dodged the outstretched arms and was away again toward the hills and freedom, when her foot caught in one of the hoe-like instruments with which the soil had been upturned and which had been left, half imbedded in the ground. For an instant she ran on, stumbling, in a mad effort to regain her equilibrium, but the upturned furrows caught her feet--again she stumbled and this time went down, and as she scrambled to rise again a heavy body fell upon her and seized her arms. A moment later she was surrounded and dragged to her feet and as she looked around she saw Ghek crawling to his prostrate rykor. A moment later he advanced to her side.|$|R
60|$|From the Bachelo a broad ravine with a {{flat bottom}} ran nearly {{straight}} to Salamgi, and along this Theodore’s road was made. It was believed, however, that guns had been laid to command this road, {{and it was not}} improbable that Theodore might make a sudden attack. It was therefore determined that the mountain guns, rocket trains, and baggage should proceed by this road, preceded by the six hundred Sappers and Miners; and that the infantry should at once climb the hills to its right, and should march along them, so as to clear them of any possible enemy. To cross the river the men had to wade, the first time that they have had to do so since they landed. Some wisely took off their trousers, others thinking vainly that the water would not reach above their <b>knees,</b> merely <b>rolled</b> their trousers up, and, of course, got thoroughly wet. Most of them took off shoes and stockings, but many stopped in the middle and put their boots on again, for the stones were so extremely sharp that wet shoes were preferable to cut feet. At last the troops were across, and after a short halt moved forward, the Sappers having gone on an hour previously with Colonel Phayre. After proceeding up the valley we prepared to climb the hill. On crossing it the 4th formed the advance, the men loading before they started, as it was impossible that we could tell when we might be attacked. Sir Charles Staveley, with General Schneider, the able and popular officer commanding the first brigade, with their staffs followed; and after them came the 4th—the little party of Engineers under Major Pritchard, the Beloochees, the Punjaubees, and two companies of the 10th Native Infantry; also a squadron of the 3d Native Cavalry, the only cavalry we had with us. We have had some stiff climbing since we entered Abyssinia, but this altogether surpassed any of our previous experience. In fact, when we got near the summit of the first range, we came to a spot which was almost impassable even for infantry, and quite so for the horses of the staff. Two or three officers endeavoured to drag their horses up, but the animals, although pretty well accustomed by this time to stiff places, were quite unable to get up, and one or two tumbled backwards and were nearly killed. The infantry therefore clambered up to the top; but we had to wait where we were for half-an-hour, until the Punjaub Pioneers cleared a sort of track up which we were able to scramble. When on the first level we had a halt for half-an-hour, for the troops were all very much exhausted by their climb, under one of the hottest suns I ever felt. They were now, too, beginning to suffer much from thirst, and the muddy water in the skins was drunk most eagerly. It tasted muddy, but was not otherwise bad; but we had to shut our eyes to drink it. While we were waiting here a messenger arrived from Colonel Phayre, saying that he held the head of the valley with the Sappers and Miners, and that the road was quite practicable. Sir Charles Staveley at once sent off an aide-de-camp to Sir Robert Napier, saying that the baggage and guns, which were waiting at the river for the receipt of this intelligence, might move forward in safety. We then marched four miles farther up a succession of rises to the place where it was hoped from the native accounts that we should find water; but there was only one small pool of very dirty water, with which, however, three or four skins were filled. The disappointment of the men, who were now suffering severely, was very great, but there was no help for it. Here, however, we met with a surprise, which to the commanding-officers quite dispelled any thought of thirst or discomfort; for here, to the astonishment and dismay of Sir Charles Staveley, he found Colonel Phayre and the 800 Sappers and Miners, who were supposed to be holding the head of the valley below us. This was now, we knew, crowded with our artillery, ammunition-baggage and supplies. This valley, as I before stated, ran straight to Magdala, and of course was visible for its whole length to the garrison of that fortress.|$|R
