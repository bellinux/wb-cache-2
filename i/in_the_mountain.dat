5|$|Apart {{from the}} forts, the {{garrison}} itself was heavily expanded {{during the initial}} construction years and became the largest garrison in Sweden, taking an exceptional position in Swedish military history of the 20th century; even {{at the start of}} the 21st century, Boden was the largest garrison city in the Swedish Army. Still, no other fortifications than the forts themselves were finished by 1908, and work now started to fill the holes in between them. It was realised that prepared positions were needed for the mobile batteries, and apart from those, three larger battery positions (sometimes called fästen, strongholds) were also constructed at Leåkersberget, Norra Åberget and Svedjeberget. These works were started in 1911 and were finished during the First World War. The last of the three strongholds was positioned <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountain</b> itself with embrasures <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountain</b> side, and Leåkersberget had parts of the battery position inside the mountain, but the gun emplacements outsidethe other positions were concrete fortifications above the ground, some inside a bunker and others behind a parapet.|$|E

5|$|Choughs can be locally {{threatened}} by the accumulation of pesticides and heavy metals <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountain</b> soils, heavy rain, shooting and other human disturbances, but a longer-term threat comes from global warming, which would cause the species' preferred Alpine climate zone to shift to higher, more restricted areas, or locally to disappear entirely.

The local extinction of the Alpine chough and the reduced range of red-billed chough in the islands may have been due to climate change or human activity.|$|E

Four of the state's universities, the Baylor Bears, Texas Longhorns, TCU Horned Frogs, and Texas Tech Red Raiders, compete in the Big 12 Conference. The Texas A Aggies left the Big 12 and joined the Southeastern Conference in 2012, which led the Big 12 to invite TCU to join; TCU was previously <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mountain</b> West Conference. The Houston Cougars and the SMU Mustangs compete in the American Athletic Conference. The Texas State Bobcats and the UT Arlington Mavericks compete in the Sun Belt Conference.

5|$|During the 2002 season, Air Force {{allowed an}} average of 360.7yards per game, fourth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mountain</b> West and 57th nationally.

Between 1990 and 2002, Air Force ranked second in terms of blocked kicks with 79. Virginia Tech was first, with 85.

He founded Wellington Rugby Football Club in 1874, and was an administrator and captain of the Somerset Rugby Football Union. After retiring as a rugby player, he continued to take part as an umpire. In 1884 he started mountaineering, and within two years he was well known <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountain</b> climbing community, and a well-regarded alpine explorer. In 1888, he and William Frederick Donkin travelled to the Caucasus Mountains in the Russian Empire {{in a bid to}} be the first ones to climb Koshtan-Tau.

5|$|If {{there is}} a pass <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountain</b> range, winds will rush through the pass with {{considerable}} speed because of the Bernoulli principle that describes an inverse relationship between speed and pressure. The airflow can remain turbulent and erratic for some distance downwind into the flatter countryside. These conditions are dangerous to ascending and descending airplanes. Cool winds accelerating through mountain gaps have been given regional names. In Central America, examples include the Papagayo wind, the Panama wind, and the Tehuano wind. In Europe, similar winds are known as the Bora, Tramontane, and Mistral. When these winds blow over open waters, they increase mixing of the upper layers of the ocean that elevates cool, nutrient rich waters to the surface, which leads to increased marine life.|$|E
5|$|In {{their first}} season <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mountain</b> West, the Bulldogs became co-champions with a 7-1 conference record. This was the Bulldogs' first {{appearance}} in the Hawaii Bowl. Coming into the 2012 season, Bulldogs' coach Tim DeRuyter said that his team would challenge for a Mountain West Conference title. After making good on that promise, the Bulldogs attempted to achieve their first bowl victory since the 2007 Humanitarian Bowl. A victory in the Hawaii Bowl would have given Fresno State a 10-win season {{for the first time}} since 2001, when quarterback Derek Carr's older brother David was the Bulldogs' quarterback.|$|E

5|$|Several major premodern Native American groups {{eventually}} {{gained control}} of lands along the river: the Yuhaviatam or Yuharetum people in the upper basin, the Payomkowishum in the southeastern basin, the Cahuilla in the desert areas of the watershed, and the Tongva people in the lower basin. The Yuhaviatam generally lived <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountain</b> headwaters of the Santa Ana River and its tributaries rimming the present-day Inland Empire basin, in present-day San Bernardino County, {{as well as in}} the foothills of the San Bernardino Mountains. The Tongva lived on the flat coastal plains of present-day Orange County south of the Santa Ana Mountains. They were also the larger of the two groups, controlling all the coastal lands from the San Gabriel Mountains in the north to Aliso Creek in the south, including all of the Los Angeles Basin.|$|E
5|$|The Luna Defense Line {{was planned}} {{to create a}} series of delaying battles from Caloocan to Angeles, Pampanga, as the Republic was {{constructing}} a guerrilla base <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mountain</b> Province.

American military observers were astonished by the Defense Line, which they described as consisting of numerous bamboo trenches stretching from town to town. The series of trenches allowed the Filipinos to withdraw gradually, firing from cover at the advancing Americans. As the American troops occupied each new position, they were subjected to a series of traps that had been set in the trenches, which included bamboo spikes and poisonous reptiles.|$|E
