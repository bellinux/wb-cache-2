But there are also examples differing from those Driver has mentioned that favour the idea of such virtues. Perhaps certain virtues of religious faith and the virtue necessary for dealing as best one can with moral dilemmas both require ignorance. However, some of the examples Driver does discuss raise the question whether virtue status is based solely on consequences, rather than perhaps having (in addition) a motivational component. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAn {{assessment}} of Cd 0. 9 Zn 0. 1 <b>S</b> <b>window</b> layer thickness {{and its impact}} on photoresponse uniformity in CdTe thin film photovoltaic (PV) devices is presented. A triple-wavelength laser beam induced current (LBIC) system provided a spatially resolved photocurrent mapping technique. Three diode lasers; λ = 405, 658, 810 nm gave photon absorption and carrier generation characteristics over the spectral range of the Cd 0. 9 Zn 0. 1 S/ CdTe devices. Two contrasting device structures were grown by metal-organic chemical vapour deposition (MOCVD), where the uniformity of the Cd 0. 9 Zn 0. 1 <b>S</b> <b>window</b> layer was known to vary: 1. uniform 240 nm Cd 0. 9 Zn 0. 1 S/ 2 μm CdTe and 2. a poorly nucleated 40 - 300 nm Cd 0. 9 Zn 0. 1 S/ 2 μm CdTe. Calculated photon penetration depths, δp allowed for the separation of identified defects within the device cross-section. Cd 0. 9 Zn 0. 1 S pin holes were identified in 240 nm Cd 0. 9 Zn 0. 1 S/ 2 μm CdTe where 405 nm photon ‘punch-through’ into the absorber material was observed. These pin holes also led to a localised reduction in photoresponse at λ = 658 and 810 nm. In the device structure where the Cd 0. 9 Zn 0. 1 <b>S</b> <b>window</b> layer thickness was known to vary from 40 to 300 nm, CdTe pin holes were identified where localised ∼ 50 μm regions of reduced photoresponse, at all wavelengths were observed. Local variations in both Cd 0. 9 Zn 0. 1 S and CdTe thickness were also identified where variable absorption led to a distribution of LBIC photoresponse. It was demonstrated that reduced photoresponse uniformity at all incident wavelengths was related to reduced device shunt resistance, Rsh and open-circuit voltage, Voc...|$|R

Quadratic discriminant classifiers are trained on features extracted from 1 or 4 <b>s</b> <b>windows.</b> It is shown that a simple rule applied to the acceleration norm entropy HnA produces the best performances compared to other classifiers trained on other feature sets. The simple rule is as follows with values given in bits: (0 <; HnA <; 1. 34), no movement; (1. 34 <; HnA <; 3. 87), tonic manifestations; (3. 87 <; HnA), tonic-clonic manifestations. For this classifier, features are extracted from 1 <b>s</b> <b>windows</b> and the misclassification rate is 11 % evaluated on 5 607 s of epileptic motor manifestations obtained from 58 seizures in 30 patients. A quantile normalization can improve the results with features based on absolute power spectral density but performances are not as good as the ones obtained with HnA.
