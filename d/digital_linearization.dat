Three main linearization methods, i. e. electrical analog linearization, optical linearization, and electrical <b>digital</b> <b>linearization</b> are presented and compared. Analog linearization can be achieved using analog predistortion circuits, and can be used for suppression of odd order nonlinear distortion components, such as third and fifth order. Optical linearization includes mixed-polarization, dual-wavelength, optical channelization and the others, implemented in optical domain, to suppress both even and odd order nonlinear distortion components, such as second and third order. Digital predistortion has been a widely used linearization method for RF power amplifiers.

40|$|Many {{communications}} signal formats are not {{power efficient}} {{because of their}} large peak-to-average power ratios (PARs). Moreover, {{in the presence of}} nonlinear devices such as power amplifiers (PAs) or mixers, the non-constant-modulus signals may generate both in-band distortion and out-of-band interference. Backing off the signal to the linear region of the device further reduces the system power efficiency. To improve the power efficiency of the communication system, one can pursue two approaches: i) linearize the PA; ii) reduce the high PAR of the input signal. In this dissertation, we first explore the optimal nonlinearity under the peak power constraint. We show that the optimal nonlinearity is a soft limiter with a specific gain calculated based on the peak power limit, noise variance, and the probability density function of the input amplitude. The result is also extended to the fading channel case. Next, we focus on <b>digital</b> baseband predistortion <b>linearization</b> for power amplifiers with memory effects.

40|$|Optical fiber {{networks}} {{have been in}} use for many decades to transport large amounts of data across long distances. Internet traffic grows at an exponential rate and demand for increased bandwidth and faster data rates is higher than ever. Radio frequency over fiber is used for a plethora of applications such as providing wireless access to remote and rural areas, phased array radars, and cable television to name a few. As signals are transmitted over longer distances, nonlinearities are incurred which degrades the performance and sensitivity of the link. Moreover as the data rates increase, it becomes a challenge to measure and monitor the signal integrity. 	This dissertation will cover two main topics: <b>digital</b> broadband <b>linearization</b> and performing wideband high speed measurements using time-stretch technology. Over {{the last few years}} there has been considerable interest in reducing the intermodulation distortions in optical links. The intermodulation distortions are caused by the nonlinear transfer function of the optical link. To reduce the nonlinearities, linearization of the optical link is performed. A novel digital post-processing algorithm has been developed to suppress nonlinearities and increase the dynamic range of the link. <b>Digital</b> broadband <b>linearization</b> algorithm has been implemented and demonstrated a record 120 dB. Hz 2 / 3 Spurious Free Dynamic Range (SFDR) over 6 GHz of bandwidth and is shown to suppress third order intermodulation products by 35 dB. By reducing the nonlinearities and improving SFDR, we have increased the sensitivity of the receiver. Afterwards, simulation of the real-time implementation of the <b>digital</b> broadband <b>linearization</b> algorithm onto a field-programmable gate array was performed by designing the architecture and translating the code into Verilog HDL. Simulations on collected data show comparable results in both Matlab and iSim which were used to evaluate the performance. 	In the second part of this dissertation, two applications using time-stretch are demonstrated: ultra-wideband instantaneous frequency estimation and high speed signal analysis measurements. By combining time-stretch technology and windowing and quadratic interpolation, ultra-wideband frequency measurements with improved frequency estimation are demonstrated. Moreover, multiple signal measurements are performed, and the frequency resolution can be tuned to measure signals close together. Lastly, time-stretch is used for measuring high speed signal integrity parameters such as bit error rate, jitter, and rise and fall times by taking advantage of the high sampling throughput and the ability to generate and analyze eye diagrams.

The thesis proposes two power amplifier linearization solutions : two-point architecture and adaptive digital predistortion using a [delta sigma] modulator for automatic inversion of power amplifier nonlinearity. Two-point architecture can be seen as a solution that extends the linearization bandwidth of the traditional feedback architecture while also offering decent <b>digital</b> predistortion <b>linearization</b> at much higher frequencies as well. It overcomes the bandwidth problem by combining Cartesian feedback and digital predistortion. As the Cartesian feedback loses its loop gain in high frequencies, the predistorted signal gradually takes over the linearization role. Effectively, this increases the operation bandwidth of the Cartesian feedback and allows wide-band transmission. For digital predistortion, the complexity involved in the implementation of adaptive algorithm and convergence issues in the look-up table training has limited its application in handset devices. Predistortion using a [delta sigma] modulator presented in this work eliminates these problems as it is based on open-loop look-up table training and does not require adaptive algorithm. by Hyun H.

40|$|This {{project has}} been {{oriented}} to improve the efficiency and the linearization of power amplifiers (PA) with the combination of crest factor reduction (CFR) techniques and digital predistortion techniques (DPD). These techniques have been applied to Filter Bank Multi Carrier (FBMC) signals, {{which is one of}} the candidate modulations for future 5 G systems. Since these signals are composed by a multicarrier modulation, they show a high Peak to Average Power Ratio (PAPR), that drive the RF amplifiers into saturation and thus cause distortion unless operation under excessive back-off is followed. The PAs are inefficient when they are operated far from the compression point (i. e. with a large back-off). These amplifiers are non-linear systems that add distortion to the signal. For this reason, we have employed the CFR techniques and DPD techniques to guarantee the linearization-efficiency trade off being required, thanks to the clipping of the signal peaks that cause non-linearities and the inversion of the non-linear response of the PA, that allow increasing the average power operation of the power amplifier. To validate the effectivity of these techniques, some simulation work has been conducted in Matlab and then the concepts have been evaluated in a real hardware environment. The results have show that these techniques can improve the communication systems of a base station (BS), given the fact that typical figures of merit such as the EVM or the ACPR of a base station transmitter that were not fulfilling the standard requirements, become significantly improved and fully compliant after applying the techniques. For FBMC signals with holes created to allocate LTE signals (primary system) in scenarios of spectral coexistence, we have also demonstrated the improvement of the primary system immunity to FBMC interference thanks to the <b>digital</b> <b>linearization</b> techniques (due to the enhanced Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio or SINR increase) ...|$|E
40|$|Wireless access {{networks}} consist of three sections, i. e., back-haul, front-haul, and wireless transmission, where the front-haul transmission systems are to distribute radio frequency (RF) signals to antenna towers. For current low-capacity wireless access, RF signals over coaxial cables, digital fiber-optic transmission, microwave point-to-point transmission, and narrowband radio-over-fiber (RoF) transmission {{have been used}} for the front-haul transmission systems. However, with the increase of demand of high capacity wireless access and also use of massive multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) antennas, low-cost, simple and broadband front-haul transmission systems are required in current 4 G and in particular the future 5 G wireless. RoF transmission system, which is based on optical subcarrier modulation, combines the advantages of both optical fiber and radio transmission, where the optical fiber has low loss, low cost, extremely high capacity, lightweight, and immunity to electromagnetic interference, and the radio transmission simplifies remote radio units (RRUs) at antenna towers. Furthermore, radio transmission based front-haul is transparent to RF signal frequency and wireless protocol, i. e., upgradable, in addition to simplified RRUs. Unfortunately, RoF is an analog optical transmission, and {{it is well known that}} any analog transmission is susceptible to nonlinear distortion. To be more specific, nonlinear distortion is the major limit for RoF transmission. In fact, all inline functional optical and electrical components used in RoF transmission systems may induce the nonlinear distortion. Specifically in RoF based front-haul systems, two key functions, i. e., RF power amplification and optical subcarrier modulation, are the main factors in introducing nonlinear distortions. The nonlinear distortions from RF power amplifiers (PAs) have been studied for decades. Therefore, the nonlinear distortions from the optical subcarrier modulation are the main concern in this thesis. The nonlinear distortions include harmonic distortions (HDs) and intermodulation distortions (IMDs). For narrow band RF signals, the HDs can be suppressed by RF filtering, but it may be impossible for the IMDs to be filtered out. For broadband RF signals, both HDs and IMDs could fall in the passband of RF signals and introduce crosstalk, and therefore both of them are required to be suppressed, i. e., linearization required. In the past decades, linearization for RF PAs has been investigated extensively, mainly focusing on signal processing based linearization, i. e., <b>digital</b> <b>linearization.</b> Unfortunately, the <b>digital</b> <b>linearization</b> is typically limited to the RF signals with up to 20 MHz bandwidth. Based on the current technologies of signal processing hardware, linearization for 1 GHz RF signals can be done, but the complexity and cost are beyond the practical applications. In order to explore broadband RoF transmission systems that support broadband front-haul, simple, low cost, and broadband linearization is pivotal. In this thesis, two linearization technologies for RoF transmission systems are investigated comprehensively, i. e., analog predistortion circuit (PDC) and dual wavelength optical linearization. Two novel PDCs are designed and investigated to suppress 3 rd order IMD (IMD 3) of RoF transmission systems. The PDCs have the advantages of broad bandwidth, compact size, and low cost. The first PDC is designed to have a bandwidth from 7 to 18 GHz, using two zero-bias Gallium Arsenide (GaAs) Schottky diodes as predistorter. The linearization using this PDC is verified in externally modulated RoF transmission systems. When a Mach-Zehnder modulator (MZM) is used for the optical subcarrier modulation, the input power at 1 dB compression point (P 1 dB) of the RoF transmission system is improved by 0. 4 and up to 2. 2 dB from 7 to 18 GHz. The spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) is improved by more than 10 dB from 7 to 14 GHz and 6 dB from 15 to 18 GHz. When an electro-absorption modulator (EAM) is used, the input P 1 dB is improved by 0. 8 and up to 3. 8 dB from 8 to 17 GHz. The SFDR is improved by more than 9 dB from 7 to 14 GHz and 4 dB from 15 to 18 GHz. The second PDC is designed to have an ultra broad bandwidth from 10 MHz to 30 GHz, using a dual Schottky diode as the predistorter. The linearization using this PDC is investigated in both directly and externally modulated RoF transmission systems. The SFDR at 8 GHz is improved by 11. 9 dB for a directly modulated RoF transmission. The SFDR is improved by more than 10 dB from 1 to 5 GHz and more than 5 dB from 1 to 30 GHz for an externally EAM modulated RoF transmission. Similarly, the SFDR is improved by more than 12 dB from 2 to 5 GHz and more than 5 dB from 2 to 30 GHz for an externally MZM modulated RoF transmission. When WiFi signals are transmitted over the externally modulated RoF systems for back-to-back (BTB) and 20 km single mode fiber (SMF), the error vector magnitudes (EVMs) are improved by 0. 4 and up to 5. 1 dB by using the PDC. Dual wavelength linearization (DWL) technique is investigated compressively to suppress 2 nd and 3 rd order nonlinearities of externally modulated RoF transmission systems simultaneously, including HDs and IMDs. The linearization is verified in both EAM and MZM modulated RoF transmission systems. Theoretical analysis is given for the first time to understand DWL technique. The experimental results agree with the theoretical analyses. In the externally EAM modulated RoF transmission systems, when the 2 nd order nonlinearity is maximally suppressed, 11. 5 and 1. 8 dB improvements of the SFDRs with respect to HD 2 and HD 3 respectively are achieved by using DWL simultaneously. 8. 5 and 1. 3 dB improvements of the SFDRs with respect to IMD 2 and IMD 3 respectively are also achieved. Correspondingly, 3 and 4 dB improvements of the input and output P 1 dBs respectively are obtained. When the 3 rd order nonlinearity is maximally suppressed, the SFDRs with respect to HD 3 and IMD 3 are improved by 8. 1 and 20. 4 dB, respectively, and corresponding 7. 7 and 11. 7 dB improvements of the input and output P 1 dBs respectively are achieved. Furthermore, IMD 5 is also suppressed, and the SFDR 5 with respect to IMD 5 is improved by 7. 1 dB. Moreover, the RoF transmission of WiFi signals at 2. 4 and 5 GHz are also linearized by using DWL technique. 3. 5 dB at 2. 4 GHz and 2. 8 dB at 5 GHz improvements of the EVMs are obtained. For an externally MZM modulated RoF transmission system, DWL is also investigated theoretically and experimentally. In the system, it is found that the SFDRs with respect to HD 2 and HD 3 are both improved at the same time when the even order nonlinearities are suppressed, in which the power of the RF signal and 3 rd order nonlinearity is increased by the same level. Thus, the SFDR 3 is still improved even the 3 rd order nonlinearity is increased. Compared to using a single 1553 nm laser, the SFDRs with respect to HD 2 and HD 3 are improved by 38. 4 and 12. 1 dB...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} a model order reduction technique based on Ridge’s regression for power amplifier (PA) behavioral models {{to be used}} in <b>digital</b> predistortion (DPD) <b>linearization</b> applications. Commonly, the DPD parameters’ extraction is performed by means of a least squares (LS) regression. With Ridge’s regression, the coefficients of the DPD are extracted defining a weighted cost function aimed at minimizing not only the mean square error, but also including a regularization term based on the square of the Euclidean norm of the coefficients’ vector. Taking advantage of this regularization and following a given criterium explained in this paper, it is possible to select the most significant basis functions of the DPD model and thus, not only improving the ovedetermined matrix problem, but also reducing the model’s order and consequently the computational complexity of the DPD linearizer.

Fibre-­‐based wireless access schemes employing sub-­‐carrier multiplexing radio over fibre links provide the unique capacity to support a number of services such as cellular network, common antennae television and wireless local area network applications simultaneously. The theory and design of a radio over fibre link was studied, with the objective of providing an economically viable high performance link to be used in a digital cellular system. The nonlinearity in the link system, especially in the optical source, revealed a limitation in the dynamic range performance when transmitting analog and multilevel digital signals over the fibre-­‐optic link channels. A <b>digital</b> baseband <b>linearization</b> technique using a radial basis function neural network that learns from the input-­‐output data samples of the link was presented for compensating the nonlinearity impairments. The bit error rate performance analysis of the link was performed using Monte-­‐Carlo and importance sampling techniques to reveal the overall system improvements with the addition of the neural network. The importance sampling technique realized the required bit error rate performance for a typical digital optical receiver in the radio over fibre link when transmitting digital signals.
