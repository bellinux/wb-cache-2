500|$|Davis {{characterized}} Sylvester as an [...] "absolute perfectionist". He {{was very}} self-conscious about his physical appearance, {{and when he}} obtained enough money from the successful Step II album, he spent part of it on cosmetic surgery to remove a bump on his nose, inject silicone into <b>his</b> <b>cheeks,</b> <b>and</b> have cosmetic work done on his teeth. He would also insist that all pictures of himself were meticulously airbrushed.|$|E
500|$|With Robey's {{popularity}} came an {{eagerness to}} differentiate {{himself from his}} music hall rivals, and so he devised a signature costume when appearing as himself: an oversized black coat fastened {{from the neck down}} with large, wooden buttons; black, unkempt, baggy trousers and a partially bald wig with black, whispery strands of unbrushed, dirty-looking hair that poked below a large, dishevelled top-hat. He applied thick white face paint and exaggerated the redness on <b>his</b> <b>cheeks</b> <b>and</b> nose with bright red make-up; his eye line and eyebrows were also enhanced with thick, black greasepaint. He held a short, misshaped, wooden walking stick, which was curved at the top. Robey later used the costume for his character, The Prime Minister of Mirth. The outfit helped Robey become instantly recognisable on the London music hall circuit. He next made a start at building his repertoire and bought the rights to comic songs and monologues by several well-established music hall writers, including Sax Rohmer and Bennett Scott. For his routines, Robey developed a characteristic delivery described by Cotes as [...] "a kind of machine-gun staccato rattle through each polysyllabic line, ending abruptly, and holding the pause while he fixed his audience with his basilisk stare." ...|$|E
2500|$|Edward and Gaveston’s homoerotic {{relationship}} {{provides the}} backdrop for the play. [...] When Gaveston plans to produce his masque, he describes “a lovely boy in Dian’s shape… / And in his sportful hands an olive tree/ To hide those parts which men delight to see” (1.2.60-63). Gaveston is deeply aware of the theatre's ability to eroticize young male actors. The Queen feels jealous of Gaveston and Edward’s relationship, noting: “For now my lord the king regards me not, / But dotes upon the love of Gaveston. / He claps <b>his</b> <b>cheeks</b> <b>and</b> hangs about his neck, / Smiles {{in his face and}} whispers in his ears” (2.2.49-52).|$|E
60|$|Elsie stooped <b>and</b> kissed <b>his</b> <b>cheek</b> <b>and</b> he put <b>his</b> hand on hers.|$|R
60|$|She smiled, <b>and</b> kissed <b>his</b> <b>cheek,</b> <b>and</b> {{still held}} <b>his</b> hand. 'Adrian,' she said.|$|R
60|$|Young Rags put the quid in <b>his</b> <b>cheek,</b> <b>and</b> {{went away}} humming a tune.|$|R
2500|$|She said, [...] "Indeed, {{he never}} used to pray or fast more {{than the rest of}} you, but I never saw a servant of God who feared Him more than Umar. He devoted his body and his soul to the people. All day he would sit tending to their affairs, and when night came he would sit up while {{business}} remained. One evening when he had finished everything, he called for his lamp - from which he used to buy the oil from his own money - and prayed two prostrations. Then he sat back on his folded legs, with his chin in his hands, and the tears ran down from <b>his</b> <b>cheeks,</b> <b>and</b> this didn't stop until dawn, when he rose for a day of fasting.|$|E
2500|$|Orr has a {{bucktoothed}} {{smile and}} frequently puts crabapples or horse chestnuts in <b>his</b> <b>cheeks</b> <b>and</b> rubber balls in his hands. He constantly teases Yossarian asking {{him if he}} wants to know why, to which Yossarian invariably says [...] "yes". Orr never gives any straightforward explanation for this other than he wants big cheeks and to detract from the peculiarity of this he keeps rubber balls in his hands. As he explains the latter, [...] "Every time someone asked me why I was walking around with crab apples in my cheeks, I'd just open my hands and show them it was rubber balls I was walking around with, not crab apples, and that they were in my hands, not my cheeks. It was a good story. But I never knew if it got across or not, since it's pretty tough to make people understand you when you're talking to them with two crab apples in your cheeks." ...|$|E
60|$|He was chiefly {{aware that}} Chitterlow was an {{overwhelming}} personality. He puffed <b>his</b> <b>cheeks</b> <b>and</b> blew.|$|E
60|$|The {{form was}} that of Luke Peterson, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>cheek</b> <b>and</b> temple were covered with blood.|$|R
60|$|Chattily, Carl went back, {{lifted her}} again, endured her kissing <b>his</b> <b>cheek,</b> <b>and</b> they started on.|$|R
60|$|The old rancher seemed {{genuinely}} shocked. Red tinged <b>his</b> <b>cheek</b> <b>and</b> a flame flared in his eyes.|$|R
60|$|He {{glanced at}} the cut on Gerald's forehead, noted the access of colour in <b>his</b> <b>cheeks,</b> <b>and</b> nodded.|$|E
60|$|He was sodden with wet, {{his face}} drawn and tired; a dark growth of beard covered <b>his</b> <b>cheeks</b> <b>and</b> chin.|$|E
60|$|She {{flashed a}} {{brilliant}} look upon him, {{which made the}} color steal into <b>his</b> <b>cheeks,</b> <b>and</b> his heart beat fast.|$|E
25|$|At {{age five}} Muldoon slipped while {{playing on the}} front gate, {{damaging}} <b>his</b> <b>cheek</b> <b>and</b> resulting in a distinctive scar.|$|R
60|$|A smile {{played on}} her lips, as she kissed <b>his</b> <b>cheek,</b> <b>and</b> entreated {{him to be}} of of good cheer.|$|R
60|$|He felt a zephyr curling about <b>his</b> <b>cheek,</b> <b>and</b> turned. It was Bathsheba's breath--she had {{followed}} him, {{and was looking}} into the same chink.|$|R
6000|$|... "Gentlemen----" [...] piped Sir John, {{with all}} the pippin hue gone from <b>his</b> <b>cheeks,</b> <b>and</b> rubbing his white hands {{together}} nervously.|$|E
60|$|Brooke nodded comprehendingly, but Barbara {{noticed that}} the blood was in <b>his</b> <b>cheeks</b> <b>and</b> he smiled in a very curious fashion.|$|E
60|$|The Major heaved his shoulders, and <b>his</b> <b>cheeks,</b> <b>and</b> laughed {{more like}} an over-fed Mephistopheles than ever, as he said the words.|$|E
6000|$|... "A new State, {{with that}} plump dandy, Decoud, {{for the first}} President," [...] mused Dr. Monygham, nursing <b>his</b> <b>cheek</b> <b>and</b> {{swinging}} <b>his</b> legs all the time.|$|R
6000|$|Hopping and {{skipping}} {{back up the}} Lone Little Path came Striped Chipmunk. When he saw Danny Meadow Mouse {{he stuck}} his tongue in <b>his</b> <b>cheek</b> <b>and</b> cried: ...|$|R
60|$|She {{bent forward}} to kiss <b>his</b> <b>cheek,</b> <b>and</b> he kissed hers. Then {{they looked at}} each other for an instant with clasped hands, and he turned away.|$|R
60|$|Dodo {{looked up}} in amazement into the sweet young face; the blood rushed to <b>his</b> <b>cheeks,</b> <b>and</b> the tears to his eyes.|$|E
60|$|Then an idea, a horrid idea, {{occurred}} to the cook. The colour left <b>his</b> <b>cheeks</b> <b>and</b> he gazed helplessly at the skipper.|$|E
6000|$|She evidently did {{not notice}} the quick flush that covered <b>his</b> <b>cheeks</b> <b>and</b> {{apparently}} dazzled his troubled eyelids, for she went on confidentially: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well--" [...] She {{looked at}} him, {{smoothing}} her muff {{with her hand}} a moment, and then she dropped a fond kiss on <b>his</b> <b>cheek</b> <b>and</b> obeyed him.|$|R
60|$|The {{consciousness}} of her near presence suddenly disturbed him. He turned round. Her warm breath was upon <b>his</b> <b>cheek,</b> <b>and</b> her white arms were twined about his neck.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Marvel {{pulled his}} mouth askew <b>and</b> {{scratched}} <b>his</b> <b>cheek</b> <b>and</b> felt <b>his</b> ears glowing. [...] "What {{will they be}} writing next?" [...] he asked faintly. [...] "Ostria, or America?" ...|$|R
60|$|She {{looked into}} his face so hard, that he felt the blood rush to <b>his</b> <b>cheeks,</b> <b>and</b> a dizzy {{sensation}} of being drawn forward.|$|E
6000|$|Was it {{death that}} spread the livid pallor over his {{forehead}} and <b>his</b> <b>cheeks,</b> <b>and</b> the dull leaden hue on his eyelids and his lips? ...|$|E
6000|$|But Stalky {{puffed out}} <b>his</b> <b>cheeks</b> <b>and</b> squinted down {{his nose in}} the style of Panurge, and all he said was, [...] "Oh, you abject burblers!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Dark was {{the flow}} of Oscar's hair, [...] Wildly it stream'd along the gale; [...] But Allan's locks were bright and fair, [...] <b>And</b> pensive seem'd <b>his</b> <b>cheek,</b> <b>and</b> pale.|$|R
60|$|For fully {{ten minutes}} he lay gasping for breath. The blood was flowing from a wound on <b>his</b> <b>cheek,</b> <b>and</b> {{it was a}} wonder {{that he had not}} been killed.|$|R
6000|$|... "Really, I don't {{know what}} you are talking about," [...] {{answered}} Tom. Then he shut up one eye, stuck his tongue into <b>his</b> <b>cheek,</b> <b>and</b> strolled into the dining room.|$|R
