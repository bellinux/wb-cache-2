5|$|Linezolid has no {{clinically}} {{significant effect on}} most Gram-negative bacteria. Pseudomonas and the Enterobacteriaceae, for instance, are not susceptible. In vitro, it is active against Pasteurella multocida, Fusobacterium, Moraxella catarrhalis, Legionella, Bordetella, and Elizabethkingia meningoseptica, and moderately active (having a minimum <b>inhibitory</b> <b>concentration</b> for 90% of strains of 8mg/L) against Haemophilus influenzae. It has also been used to great effect as a second-line treatment for Capnocytophaga infections.|$|E
5|$|By definition, antagonists display no {{efficacy}} {{to activate}} the receptors they bind. Antagonists do not maintain the ability to activate a receptor. Once bound, however, antagonists inhibit the function of agonists, inverse agonists, and partial agonists. In functional antagonist assays, a dose-response curve measures {{the effect of the}} ability of a range of concentrations of antagonists to reverse the activity of an agonist. The potency of an antagonist is usually defined by its half maximal <b>inhibitory</b> <b>concentration</b> (i.e., IC50 value). This can be calculated for a given antagonist by determining the concentration of antagonist needed to elicit half inhibition of the maximum biological response of an agonist. Elucidating an IC50 value is useful for comparing the potency of drugs with similar efficacies, however the dose-response curves produced by both drug antagonists must be similar. The lower the IC50 the greater the potency of the antagonist, and the lower the concentration of drug that is required to inhibit the maximum biological response. Lower concentrations of drugs may be associated with fewer side-effects.|$|E
25|$|Organisms {{are said}} to be {{susceptible}} to nitrofurantoin if their minimum <b>inhibitory</b> <b>concentration</b> is 32 /ml or less. The peak blood concentration of nitrofurantoin following an oral dose of nitrofurantoin 100nbsp&mg, is less than 1 μg/ml and may be undetectable. Its bioavailability is about 90% and the urinary excretion is 40% tissue penetration is negligible; the drug is well concentrated in the urine: 75% of the dose is rapidly metabolised by the liver, but 25% of the dose is excreted in the urine unchanged, reliably achieving levels of 200 μg/ml or more. In studies of dogs, the majority of urinary excretion is through glomerular filtration with some tubular secretion. There is also tubular absorption which is increased with urine acidification. However the activity of nitrofurantoin is also pH dependent and mean <b>inhibitory</b> <b>concentration</b> rises sharply with increased pH above 6. Nitrofurantoin cannot be used to treat infections other than simple cystitis.|$|E

25|$|In acute endocarditis, {{due to the}} fulminant {{inflammation}} empirical {{antibiotic therapy}} is started immediately after the blood has been drawn for culture. This usually includes vancomycin and ceftriaxone IV infusions until the microbial identification and susceptibility report with the minimum <b>inhibitory</b> <b>concentration</b> becomes available allowing for modification of the antimicrobial therapy to target the specific microorganism. It {{should be noted that}} the routine use of gentamicin to treat endocarditis has fallen out of favor due to the lack of evidence to support its use (except in infections caused by Enterococcus and nutritionally variant streptococci) and the high rate of complications.|$|E
25|$|The {{modes of}} action by which {{antimicrobial}} peptides kill microbes are varied, and may differ for different bacterial species. Some antimicrobial peptides kill both bacteria and fungi, e.g., psoriasin kills E. coli and several filamentous fungi. The cytoplasmic membrane {{is a frequent}} target, but peptides may also interfere with DNA and protein synthesis, protein folding, and cell wall synthesis. The initial contact between the peptide and the target organism is electrostatic, as most bacterial surfaces are anionic, or hydrophobic, {{such as in the}} antimicrobial peptide Piscidin. Their amino acid composition, amphipathicity, cationic charge and size allow them to attach to and insert into membrane bilayers to form pores by ‘barrel-stave’, ‘carpet’ or ‘toroidal-pore’ mechanisms. Alternately, they may penetrate into the cell to bind intracellular molecules which are crucial to cell living. Intracellular binding models includes inhibition of cell wall synthesis, alteration of the cytoplasmic membrane, activation of autolysin, inhibition of DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis, and inhibition of certain enzymes. However, in many cases, the exact mechanism of killing is not known. One emerging technique for the study of such mechanisms is dual polarisation interferometry. In contrast to many conventional antibiotics these peptides appear to be bactericidal instead of bacteriostatic. In general the antimicrobial activity of these peptides is determined by measuring the minimal <b>inhibitory</b> <b>concentration</b> (MIC), which is the lowest concentration of drug that inhibits bacterial growth.|$|E

2500|$|Bacteria usually acquire {{resistance}} to tetracycline from horizontal transfer {{of a gene}} that either encodes an efflux pump or a ribosomal protection protein. Efflux pumps actively eject tetracycline from the cell, preventing the buildup of an <b>inhibitory</b> <b>concentration</b> of tetracycline in the cytoplasm. [...] Ribosomal protection proteins interact with the ribosome and dislodge tetracycline from the ribosome, allowing for translation to continue.|$|E
2500|$|Theoretical {{reasons are}} given for believing {{mortality}} might be lower in patients treated with imipenem: first, less endotoxin is released by dying bacteria during imipenem treatment, and the minimum <b>inhibitory</b> <b>concentration</b> (MIC) for imipenem {{is lower than}} for ceftazidime. However, no clinically relevant difference was found in mortality between imipenem and ceftazidime treatments. [...] The MIC of meropenem is higher for B.pseudomallei than for many other organisms, and patients being haemofiltered will need more frequent or higher doses.|$|E
40|$|Propionibacterium acnes is {{the cause}} of {{inflammation}} in acne vulgaris and has been shown to produce potent neutrophil chemoattractants. Different strain of P. acnes that were sensitive or resistant to ampicillin, erythromycin, minocycline, and tetracycline were grown in the presence of subminimal <b>inhibitory</b> <b>concentrations</b> of the drugs, and their culture supernatants were assayed for neutrophil chemotactic activity. The presence of subminimal <b>inhibitory</b> <b>concentrations</b> of ampicillin failed to affect chemotactic factor production by any of the strains. Subminimal <b>inhibitory</b> <b>concentrations</b> of tetracycline, minocycline, and erythromycin all produced decreased neutrophil chemotactic activity in P. acnes culture supernatants. This inhibition of chemotactic activity was most pronounced in strains of P. acnes which were susceptible to the drugs.

2500|$|Plasma level {{monitoring}} of vancomycin is necessary {{due to the}} drug's biexponential distribution, intermediate hydrophilicity, and potential for ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity, especially in populations with poor renal function and/or increased propensity to bacterial infection. Vancomycin activity {{is considered to be}} time-dependent; that is, antimicrobial activity depends on the duration that the serum drug concentration exceeds the minimum <b>inhibitory</b> <b>concentration</b> [...] of the target organism. Thus, peak serum levels have not been shown to correlate with efficacy or toxicity; indeed, concentration monitoring is unnecessary in most cases. Circumstances in which therapeutic drug monitoring [...] is warranted include: patients receiving concomitant aminoglycoside therapy, patients with (potentially) altered pharmacokinetic parameters, patients on haemodialysis, patients administered high-dose or prolonged treatment, and patients with impaired renal function.

2500|$|For Burkholderia pseudomallei, some {{clinical}} antibiotic {{agents that}} are used to treat its infection, mellioidosis, can induce morphological changes such as filamentation and physiological changes in this bacteria. These antibiotics are the β-lactam antibiotics, fluoroquinolones, and antibiotics that inhibit the synthesis of thymidine. The ability of some β-lactam antibiotics to induce filamentation in gram negative bacteria is to inhibit penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). This inhibition stops the assembly of peptidoglycan network in bacterial cell wall. PBP-1 inhibition leads to rapid cell death. While PBP-2 and PBP-3 inhibition lead to morphological change, turn normal cells to spheroplasts and filamentous cells (elongated rods), respectively. PBP-3 forms the septum in dividing bacteria by involving transpeptidase so inhibition of this PBP-3 protein leads to the incomplete formation of septa in dividing bacteria resulting in the formation of long strands of bacteria (filaments). [...] Kang Chen et al. mentioned that the filament was induced by sublethal concentrations of ceftazidime, ofloxacin, or trimethoprim. At or below the minimal <b>inhibitory</b> <b>concentration</b> (MIC), filamentation occurred mainly at these concentration and bacteria remained as viable within the vacuoles of immortalized human macrophages, not rapidly killed. [...] However, the B.pseudomallei filaments revert to normal forms when the antibiotics are removed. Moreover, bacillary daughter cells maintained cell-division capacity and viability despite re-exposure to antibiotics such as ceftazidime. Thus, this developmental alteration may provide additionally survival advantages to bacteria. [...] Furthermore, for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, filamentation induced by antibiotics appears to trigger bacteria to change from a normal growth phase to a stationary growth phase. [...] Filamentous bacteria are also associated with an increase in endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, LPS) release and the immune system of patients needs to cope with this characteristic. Chloramphenicol antibiotic can induce the formation of filamentous cells, which contain multiple copies of unsegregated chromosomes. These chromosomes lead to the unsuccessful division of elongated cells, and the formation of bacterial filament. Moreover, the filamentation also depends on the expression levels of an efflux pump (MexAB-OprM) and the minimum <b>inhibitory</b> <b>concentration</b> of chloramphenicol.|$|E
40|$|The agar {{dilution}} method of in vitro susceptibility testing of fungi was analyzed with a Steers-type inoculum replicator, ten strains, and three drugs.

If the agar dilution minimal <b>inhibitory</b> <b>concentrations</b> were determined at first appearance of control growth, a commonly used end point, small variations in the time of reading (as could occur by variation in observer perception of when initial growth appears) induced large variations in the minimal <b>inhibitory</b> <b>concentrations</b> of 5 -fluorocytosine and ketoconazole, particularly with rapidly growing strains. Results at 35 and 30 °C were similar. The differences in results with the three drugs suggest different mechanisms of action.
