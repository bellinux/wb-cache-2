40|$|In this paper, the {{performance}} of a dynamic output feedback sliding mode controller (SMC) has been compared experimentally with that of a fuzzy logic controller (FLC) for the stabilization of a MBC 500 magnetic <b>bearing</b> <b>system.</b> The sliding mode controller with a state observer is designed for the unstable nonminimum phase magnetic <b>bearing</b> <b>system</b> based on the reduced order model of the system. The FLC uses error and rate of change of error in the position of the rotor as inputs and produces an output voltage to control the current of the amplifiers driving the magnetic <b>bearing</b> <b>system.</b> Both types of nonlinear control methods can handle the system resonant modes and maintain the magnetic <b>bearing</b> <b>system</b> stability without the use of any notch filters. The performances of the designed two types of nonlinear controllers are compared via real time experiment.

Experimental results have demonstrated that both nonlinear controllers can maintain the magnetic <b>bearing</b> <b>system</b> stability when the system is subjected to small to medium size disturbances.

40|$|The {{benefits}} of narrowband control theory for simple, open-loop stable systems are illustrated, {{and how the}} approach changes for magnetic <b>bearing</b> <b>systems,</b> which are open-loop unstable, is discussed. Magnetic <b>bearing</b> <b>systems</b> are good applications for narrowband control theory. Two sources of synchronous forces, the measurement error and the magnetic unbalance, are discussed. Both the measurement error and the magnetic unbalance manifest themselves as synchronous disturbances. It is shown that narrowband control theory for simple, open-loop stable systems provides excellent performance and good stability robustness. Because magnetic <b>bearing</b> <b>systems</b> are open-loop stable, the narrowband control approach becomes more complex. Disturbance accommodating control (DAC) theory is introduced as an effective approach to reduce vibrations in magnetic <b>bearing</b> <b>systems.</b> It is used to develop a control/estimation scheme that enables the rotor to spin about its center of mass {{in the presence of}} the measurement error disturbances...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, the {{structure}} and performance of a model based controller have been compared experimentally {{with that of a}} fuzzy logic controller (FLC) for stabilization of a MBC 500 magnetic <b>bearing</b> <b>system.</b> The model based controller was designed {{on the basis of a}} reduced order model of the MBC 500 magnetic <b>bearing</b> <b>system.</b> In this approach, notch filters are necessary to cancel the resonant modes of the active magnetic <b>bearing</b> <b>system.</b> The FLC uses error and rate of change of error in the position of the rotor as inputs and produces an output voltage to control the current of the amplifiers driving the magnetic <b>bearing</b> <b>system.</b> In this approach, no analytical model of the MBC 500 magnetic <b>bearing</b> <b>system</b> was required. This can greatly simplify the controller design process. Furthermore, the FLC can stabilize the magnetic <b>bearing</b> <b>system</b> without the use of any notch filters. In the experiment, both the model based controller and the FLC have been coded in C and implemented in real time via a Digital Signal Processor (DSP) card. Experimental results have demonstrated that, despite its simplicity, the FLC has higher disturbance rejection performance and better robust stabilty than the model based controller. This leads to the following open question which we believe is yet to be answered: Why does the FLC possess the common characteristics of high authority linear controllers without at the same time having the low stability robustness usually exhibited by such linear controllers? We believe an answer to the above question may be the first step to better controller design methods for stabilizing active magnetic <b>bearing</b> <b>systems.</b> Conference held: 9 - 11 December 2009, Christchurch, New Zealan...|$|R

The Reynolds equation governing the flow of lubricant in the clearance space between the journal and bearing together with the equation of flow through an orifice restrictor has been solved using FEM and Galerkin's method.

40|$|A hybrid {{superconductor}} magnet <b>bearing</b> <b>system</b> {{has been}} developed based on passive magnetic levitation and the flux pinning effect of high-temperature superconductivity. The rationale lies in the unique capability of a high-temperature superconductor (HTS) to enhance system stability passively without power consumption. Characterization experiments have been conducted to understand its dynamic behavior and to estimate the required motor torque for its driving system design. These experiments show that the hybrid HTS-magnet <b>bearing</b> <b>system</b> has a periodic oscillation of drag torque due mainly to the nonuniform magnetic field density of permanent magnets. Furthermore, such a system also suffers from a small superimposed periodic oscillation introduced {{by the use of}} multiple HTS disks rather than a uniform annulus of HTS material.

40|$|In {{the rotary}} compressor, the rolling piston and the {{contacted}} rotor-journal <b>bearing</b> <b>system</b> are basically moving components. Because of the inertia {{forces and the}} periodically changing gas force acting on the rolling piston and the rotor, the journal bearing suffers very large loads.

40|$|Accurate {{design of}} <b>bearing</b> <b>systems,</b> {{essential}} for long, reliable life, {{requires that the}} stress imposed on the rotating bearing elements be acceptable. This requires accurate calculation of the forces developed in the bearing elements due to the applied load. This is {{commonly referred to as}} the bearing load distribution. Calculation of the bearing load distribution has historically been achieved through Classical Bearing Theory. This method was developed through a combination of theoretical and experimental analysis. While results obtained through Classical Bearing Theory are generally acceptable for simple <b>bearing</b> <b>systems,</b> use of this method in 2 ̆ 2 real life 2 ̆ 2 designs can lead to substantial error. Use of Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is now being employed to analyze <b>bearing</b> <b>systems</b> too complicated for the Classical approach. While accurate results are obtainable for complex systems, FEA generally requires expensive computer system hardware and software, extensive model generation and modification time, and specialized training in the software. Complexity of most FEA software and inaccurate modeling can result in significant solution error. Therefore, a need exists to span the gap between the limited Classical Bearing Theory and the expensive, time consuming Finite Element Analysis. This 2 ̆ 2 bridge 2 ̆ 2 is the Variational Method here presented. This method possesses the best components of each of the previous procedures. The Variational Method is based on the minimization of potential energy of the <b>bearing</b> <b>system</b> using the Ritz Method.

40|$|Copyright © 2008 by SAGE PublicationsMagnetic {{bearings}} use magnetic {{forces to}} support various machine components. Because of the non-contact {{nature of this}} type of suspension, magnetic bearing technology offers a number of significant advantages over conventional bearings, such as rolling element and fluid film bearings. An active magnetic bearing basically consists of an electromagnetic actuator, position sensors, power amplifiers, and a feedback controller. All of these components are characterized by nonlinear behavior and therefore the entire system is inherently nonlinear. However, in simulations of the dynamic behavior of magnetic <b>bearing</b> <b>systems,</b> the nonlinearities are usually neglected to simplify the analysis and only linear models are used. Moreover, many control techniques currently used in magnetic <b>bearing</b> <b>systems</b> are generally designed by ignoring nonlinear effects. The main reason for simplification is the intractability of the complexity of the actual model. In fact, the inherent nonlinear properties of magnetic <b>bearing</b> <b>systems</b> can lead to dynamic behavior of a magnetically suspended rotor that is distinctly different from that predicted using a simple linearized model. Therefore, the nonlinearities should be taken into account. This literature review is focused on the nonlinear dynamics of magnetic <b>bearing</b> <b>systems</b> and it provides background information on analytical methods, nonlinear vibrations resulting from a rotor contacting auxiliary bearings, and other active topics of research involving the nonlinear properties of magnetic <b>bearing</b> <b>systems,</b> such as nonlinear self-sensing magnetic bearings and nonlinear control of magnetic bearings.

Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) {{are one of the}} most popular methods for classification in condition diagnosis of <b>bearing</b> <b>systems.</b> Regarding to ANNs performance, ANNs parameters have important role especially connectivity weights. In several running of learning processes with the same structure of ANNs, we can obtain different accuracy significantly since initial weights are selected randomly. Therefore, finding the best weights in learning process is an important task for obtaining good performance of ANNs. Previous researchers have proposed some methods to get the best weights such as simple average and majority voting.
