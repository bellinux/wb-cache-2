25|$|The video {{begins with}} a small boy and girl playing on a {{playground}} together, teasingly pushing each other around. The young girl {{is intended to be}} Clarkson as a child, presumably with her young male best friend. The boy <b>hands</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> beaded necklace, which she puts on admiringly. The shot closes in on the necklace, then pulls back to reveal it's still worn as a bracelet on the wrist of now-adult Clarkson, her boyfriend (played by Houston Rhines) shows up at her apartment door, presumably after an argument. Clarkson teases him with a set of keys, which she then throws down the toilet. The two are then shown sitting on a couch, reading magazines, when Clarkson grabs her boyfriend's magazine. The two are shown throwing various possessions of one another out of the apartment window, though in a playful manner. Such items include numerous articles of clothing, magazines, a guitar (which Clarkson tries to stop him throwing out), and a fishbowl (with the fish being taken out and put in a glass first, after which they look out the window). After throwing these items out the window, the two are seen sitting affectionately on the couch. Clarkson and her boyfriend are shown still fighting and bickering as they did as children, over the TV Guide and remote control. The latter portion of the video shows the two driving in a first generation Ford Bronco (with the necklace/bracelet hanging from the rear view mirror), eventually getting into an argument. Distracted by the tiff over directions, the Bronco nearly ends up in a head-on collision with an approaching car. After spinning out to avoid the crash, Clarkson simply grabs her boyfriend and pulls him into a kiss, where the video ends.|$|E

500|$|The {{original}} script gives more {{insight into}} Scully's visit to Scott Blevins' office. The scene that introduces Scully {{in the script}} is set just before her visit and {{takes place at the}} FBI Academy in Quantico, Virginia, where she teaches a small group of trainees about the physiology of homicide, specifically electrocution and death by cattle prod. Her attention is distracted by an agent who enters the room and <b>hands</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> note that reads, [...] "Your attendance is required in Washington at 1600 hrs. sharp". Scully checks her digital watch, which reads 1:03. The majority, at the least, of this scene was actually filmed but the scene was omitted from {{the final version of the}} episode. The next scene is that in which Scully reports to the receptionist at FBI headquarters; the script includes Scully showing her badge to the receptionist and dialogue for the role of the receptionist as she tells Scully, [...] "See Section Chief Blevins. Third floor, violent crime division." [...] In the final version of the episode, Scully's badge does not appear in any of the scenes and the receptionist does not speak.|$|E
2500|$|Despite Clare {{showing a}} more [...] "vulnerable" [...] {{side in the}} weeks prior to her departure, in episodes that aired in July 2008, Bradley {{discovered}} her original plan to manipulate money from himself and other men in Walford, and subsequently shunned her, leaving Clare [...] "feeling isolated and unwanted by her closest friends and family". Bissix has discussed her character's departure and the [...] "softer side" [...] to Clare that emerged: [...] "she does genuinely care for [...] When he turns against her, {{it turns into a}} bit of a drunken mission for her and she wrecks Dot's house. When Dot comes back, she finds her {{in a bit of a}} state and <b>hands</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> Christianity leaflet. [...] actually sits and tries to pray". Kris Green from Digital Spy has suggested that the programme [...] "only really ever scratched the surface with [...] " [...] and that there was still a lot that was undiscovered about the character, which Bissix has agreed with. She comments, [...] "This isn't a closed chapter. At the end of the day, she's been outed off the Square and with the character she is, she doesn't even know what's going on in her own head. Someone like Clare doesn't stick around Walford unless there's a reason. I like to believe in what I do and believe in my characters. I'm not going to stay in a job for no reason. Clare would definitely leave in this situation." [...] After one last [...] "huge row" [...] with Bradley and realising that she had no friends in Walford, Clare decided to leave, making her exit in an hour-long episode that aired on 7 August 2008. Discussing her exit, Bissix said, [...] "I leave Albert Square in the back of a Black Cab, of course! Which is how I left with Nigel 10 years ago so it feels kind of right. It’s better than going out in a [...] isn’t it? I don’t want to be killed off!" [...] She also revealed that she is hoping Clare Bates will return to EastEnders again one day, commenting, [...] "I don’t think it’s the end of Clare. I’m sure she’ll be back to cause trouble at some point." [...] In 2009, Bissix added that producers told her when she left in August 2008 that they were thinking of bringing her character back in a year or so. She added, [...] "but it's one of those things. I'll just have to wait and see." ...|$|E
