5|$|Polycystic {{kidney disease}} (PKD) is a slowly {{progressive}} disease affecting Persian and Persian-related breeds, in which fluid-filled cysts expand within the kidneys, destroying functional tissue. While renal cysts are observed {{with a low}} incidence in Maine Coons, PKD {{appears to be a}} misnomer in this particular breed. In a recent study spanning 8 years, renal cysts were documented by ultrasound in 7 of 187 healthy Maine Coons enrolled in a pre-breeding screening programme. The cysts were mostly single and unilateral (6/7, 85.7%) small (mean 3.6mm in diameter) and located at corticomedullary junction (4/6, 66.7%), thus different in size, numbers and location from those observed in Persian-related breeds. In the same study, not only did all six Maine Coon cats with renal cysts test negative for the PKD1 mutation, proving the disease in these cats to be unrelated to the PKD observed in Persians and related breeds, but gene sequencing of these cats failed to demonstrate any common genetic sequences. The presence of renal cysts, in the absence of other changes, does not appear to negatively impact the patients' quality of life, as those for which follow-up was available were reported alive and well in adulthood. Although the exact nature and clinical relevance of renal cysts in Maine Coons is currently unknown, its screening is still recommended for pre-breeding assessment. Ultrasonography is currently the only valid <b>diagnostic</b> <b>method</b> for its detection in this breed.|$|E
25|$|The {{enzyme-linked}} immunosorbent assay or ELISA is a <b>diagnostic</b> <b>method</b> for quantitatively or semi-quantitatively determining protein concentrations from blood plasma, serum or cell/tissue extracts in a multi-well plate format (usually 96-wells per plate). Broadly, {{proteins in}} solution are adsorbed to ELISA plates. Antibodies specific for the protein of interest are used to probe the plate. Background is minimised by optimising blocking and washing methods (as for IHC), and specificity is ensured via the presence {{of positive and negative}} controls. Detection methods are usually colorimetric or chemiluminescence based.|$|E
25|$|He {{introduced}} {{the concept of}} electron temperature and in 1924 invented the <b>diagnostic</b> <b>method</b> for measuring both temperature and density with an electrostatic probe, now called a Langmuir probe and commonly used in plasma physics. The current of a biased probe tip is measured {{as a function of}} bias voltage to determine the local plasma temperature and density. He also discovered atomic hydrogen, which he put to use by inventing the atomic hydrogen welding process; the first plasma weld ever made. Plasma welding has since been developed into gas tungsten arc welding.|$|E

25|$|Most {{immunodiagnostic}} tests will detect {{infection and}} have a sensitivity above 90% during all stages of the diseases. In addition antibody concentration quickly drops post treatment and no antibodies are present one year after treatment, {{which makes it a}} very good <b>diagnostic</b> <b>method.</b> In humans, diagnosis of fasciolosis is usually achieved parasitologically by findings the fluke eggs in stool, and immunologically by ELISA and Western blot. Coprological examinations of stool alone are generally not adequate because infected humans have important clinical presentations long before eggs are found in the stools.|$|E
25|$|Up to half {{of those}} {{infected}} display no symptoms, and diagnosis is difficult because the worm eggs are often missed in fecal examination. The methods of detection are through fecal examination, parasite-specific antibody detection, or radiological diagnosis, as well as laparotomy. In case of a suspected outbreak {{it may be useful}} to keep track of dietary history, which is also useful for exclusion of differential diagnoses. Fecal examination is generally not helpful because the worm eggs can seldom be detected in the chronic phase of the infection. Eggs appear in the feces first between 9–11 weeks post-infection. The cause of this is unknown, and it is also difficult to distinguish between the different species of fasciola as well distinguishing them from echinostomes and Fasciolopsis. Most immunodiagnostic tests detect infection with very high sensitivity, and as concentration drops after treatment, it is a very good <b>diagnostic</b> <b>method.</b> Clinically {{it is not possible to}} differentiate from other liver and bile diseases. Radiological methods can detect lesions in both acute and chronic infection, while laparotomy will detect lesions and also occasionally eggs and live worms.|$|E

2500|$|Computed {{tomography}} has {{an increased}} accuracy of diagnosis over X-ray, but no specific findings on a CT scan exist {{to establish a}} diagnosis. [...] Although CT scanning increases chances that diaphragmatic rupture will be diagnosed before surgery, the rate of diagnosis before surgery is still only 31–43.5%. Another <b>diagnostic</b> <b>method</b> is laparotomy, but this misses diaphragmatic ruptures up to 15% of the time. [...] Often diaphragmatic injury is discovered during a laparotomy that was undertaken because of another abdominal injury. Because laparotomies are more common in those with penetrating trauma then {{compared to those who}} experienced a blunt force injury, diaphragmatic rupture is found more often in these persons. Thoracoscopy is more reliable in detecting diaphragmatic tears than laparotomy and is especially useful when chronic diaphragmatic hernia is suspected.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present work is to set focus on the {{importance}} of built-in validation of <b>diagnostic</b> <b>methods</b> in zoonoses-surveillance programs.

Estimates of true prevalences are crucial for optimizing surveillance programs so they are both cost effective and provide the best possible tool for assessing consumer safety. Using 3 examples we illustrate some of the diagnostic challenges in zoonosis surveillance that potentially could be met by appropriate validation schemes and knowledge about the performance of the <b>diagnostic</b> <b>methods.</b> We recommend that estimates of within and between laboratory variation, analytical and diagnostic sensitivity and specificity are made accessible in the public domain as part of a quality-assurance system for <b>diagnostic</b> <b>methods</b> in surveillance programs.
