40|$|Graduation date: 1975 The {{quality and}} cost of wood {{particle}} composites are substantially determined by how the adhesive that bonds the composite is distributed on the particles. Distribution of the adhesive {{is controlled by the}} method of application. Currently the adhesive is applied by spraying it onto the particles. It was hypothesized that applying the adhesive as a foam would lead to improved adhesive distribution. An experimental system was developed for foaming a urea formaldehyde adhesive with liquid freon- 12 and for blending the foam with wood particles. This system was compared to systems for applying the adhesive as a spray and bulk liquid. Strength properties of wood particle composites made with <b>foamed</b> <b>adhesive</b> were found to be equivalent to those with adhesive applied as a spray. Applying <b>foamed</b> <b>adhesive</b> was superior to mixing particles with unfoamed adhesive. Strength properties were not correlated to adhesive distribution according to particle size. Foam and bulk liquid application produced adhesive distributions proportional to particle surface area. The spray application resulted in adhesive distributed disproportionately heavy on the larger particles relative to their surface area. Other factors, such as the number of particles not receiving adhesive and the uniformity of adhesive coverage on a particle surface, may explain the differences that occurred in strength properties...|$|E

Focusing on {{the demand}} for green buffer {{material}} with increasingly rapid growth of Express packaging market and main discuss the technology of foamed bamboo fiber and pay more attention on producing them. Add 40 g bamboo powder and bamboo pulp as the original reaction materials, and then contrast the foamed productions. The results show the bamboo pulp has a better buffer ability. Add different contents of photo starches and contrast {{the results of the}} experiments, and then it could conclude that 20 g photo starches could bond the bamboo fibers and adhesives well. By selecting different kinds of foamed reagents and researching the suitable ratio of them, it could concludes that organic <b>foamed</b> <b>adhesive</b> AC should be 0. 3 g, and inorganic <b>foamed</b> <b>adhesive</b> should be (3 gNaHCO 3 : 2 gNH 3 HCO 3 : 1 g(NH 3) 2 CO 3). By adding different contents of CaCO 3, it could conclude that 4 g is the best value. By contrasting the validity of microwaves oven and high temperature container, it could conclude that put the composites into the microwaves for 7 minutes will not only have a high quality, but also a short time. Finally cut the foamed bamboo fiber productions into small grains. Test the static buffer characteristics of the small grains, and then F-X, σ-ε, C-ε curves could be recorded...|$|E

This fact also can be apply for the companies operates in wood processing industry. In the wood processing industry play adhesives important role and they are important secondary materials in furniture industry also. Adhesives significantly contribute to improving the products quality and they are also the basis for the development of new improved wood products. The main goal of the article is to promote the possibility of <b>foamed</b> <b>adhesives</b> using as a chance for the costs saving during the production of solid wood panels. The methods of our research are focused on the increasing of <b>adhesive</b> volume by <b>foaming</b> technology using the standard STN 13 354.

It creates opportunities for applying of less volume of adhesive in bonded joints and on the other hand for obtaining the comparable strength requirements as the conventional volume of un-foamed adhesive.

40|$|The aim is {{to develop}} a {{lightweight}} particleboard with a target density between 300 kg/m' and 500 kg/m' for the furniture industry.

40|$|Wheat gluten (WG) and its components, gliadin and {{glutenin}} proteins, {{form the}} largest polymers in nature, which complicates the structural architecture of these proteins. Wheat gluten, gliadin and glutenin proteins in unmodified form showed few secondary structural features. Structural modification of these proteins using heat, {{pressure and the}} chemical chaperone glycerol resulted in a shift to organized structure. In modified gliadin, nano-structural molecular arrangements {{in the form of}} hexagonal closed pack (HCP) assemblies with lattice parameter of (58 Å) were obvious together with development of intermolecular disulphide bonds. Modification of glutenin resulted in highly polymerized structure with proteins linked not only by disulphide bonds, but also with other covalent and irreversible bonds, as well as the highest proportion of b-sheets. From a combination of experimental evidence and protein algorithms, we have proposed tertiary structure models of unmodified and modified gliadin and glutenin proteins. An increased understanding of gliadin and glutenin proteins structure and behavior are of utmost importance to understand the applicability of these proteins for various applications including plastics materials, <b>foams,</b> <b>adhesives,</b> films and coatings...|$|R

Objective: The goal {{of this study is}} to find statistical predictive model to determine the relationship between airborne hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) and selective psychrometric variables.

The air samples and psychrometric parameters were separately collected and determined in a working shift for three periods of 2 h, each at a flow rate of 2 l/min in an impinger containing a solution of reagent of dimethyl sulfoxide in tryptamine [US National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), 1994]. Results: There was a significant correlation between HDI concentration and relative humidity and dry bulb temperature (P 0. 05).

40|$|Roof coverings, {{particularly}} barrel tiles, {{have experienced}} significant damage {{over the last}} few years from storms, even weaker storms such as Category 1 Hurricane Wilma in 2005. Efforts have been made to ban mortar-set attachments in southern Florida in favor of adhesive sets. Moreover, some homeowners have generalized the poor performance of clay or concrete tiles in favor of one or the other. This study aims to address whether there is a significant difference in the uplift capacity and impact resistance of field and ridge tiles of clay and concrete with either mortar-set or adhesive-set attachments. The detailed experimental study revealed the strongest system to be concrete tiles with mortar, both for uplift capacity and impact resistance. Although concrete tiles bond to mortar much better than clay tiles, clay tiles adhere better to the <b>foam</b> <b>adhesive.</b> Concrete tiles were also shown to perform better than clay tiles when impacted by a traveling projectile. Test results do not support the ban on the use of mortar for hip and ridge tiles. It is suggested that any such ban on mortar should be limited to clay tiles only. The study also showed cyclic testing to more accurately represent the uplift capacity of tiles for real hurricane conditions. In contrast, the monotonic testing used by tile manufacturers across the industry was found to overestimate the uplift capacity of tiles by as much as 40 %. PublishedN/...|$|R

With an ever-increasing ageing population, it can be assumed that {{costs associated with the}} management and treatment of wounds will also continue to rise. The Business Service Authority (2014) reported that in 2013 between £ 160 and £ 185 million was spent on wound care dressings within primary care services in England, of which foam dressings accounted for £ 22. 6 million of the overall spend. Foam dressings are frequently used in wound care to assist with the management of wound exudate, helping to prevent maceration of the wound bed, protect the surrounding skin and prevent cross-infection caused by strikethrough. The aim of dressings is to provide an optimum environment at the interface with the wound bed to promote wound healing. With limited financial resources within health care, the cost-effectiveness of each type of wound dressing is high on the agenda. It is, however, important that costs are not considered in isolation; the outcomes (general health benefits) associated with interventions (e. g. wound healing and reduction in wound pain) must also be taken into account alongside close collaboration with the patient, and in some cases the carer (Rippon et al, 2008). This article provides a summary of the published literature relating to foam dressings, investigating their impact on healing rates, pain on dressing removal, fluid-handling capacity and their costeffectiveness.
