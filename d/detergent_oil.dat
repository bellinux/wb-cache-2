The effluents (liquid waste) of five industries like textile mill, oil refinery, soap and detergent, hydrogenated oil and rubber industry were used in this study. The study was carried out during 1998 - 2000. The results show that effluents from all five industries consist of higher concentration of metals (Cr, Mn, Fe, Cu, Co, Ni, As, Cd and Pb). Furthermore the germination of crops was more effected with the effluents of textile mill followed by soap and <b>detergent,</b> <b>oil</b> refinery and hydrogenated oil, where as less effects were observed from effluents of rubber industry. Therefore {{it was observed that}} effluent is not only unfit for irrigation but also for domestic uses due to presence of heavy and toxic metals and other harmful pollutants...|$|E

During dry season, its water {{quantity}} has been decreasing so the water flow is insufficient to dilute the pollutant from sewage and affecting the water quality. Some pollutant parameters that have exceeded the quality standard in the Gajahwong river are including BOD, COD, TSS, phosphates, and total coliform. The study is expected to show the relationship between the water quantity and water pollution parameters and how to mitigate it. Water availability at the river was analyzed by using Mock model and the result was presented in flow duration curve. Climate data including rainfall for 12 years period from 2001 to 2012 were collected. Thecondition of river water quality was analyzed using Pollution Index Method. Results show that dependable flow at 80 % probability was 0. 80 m 3 /s. Water quality conditions in the Gajahwong River from upstream to downstream have declined at moderately polluted level.

40|$|Biosurfactants are {{produced}} by bacteria or yeast utilizing different substrates as sugars, glycerol, or oils. They have important applications in the <b>detergent,</b> <b>oil,</b> and pharmaceutical industries. Glycerol {{is the product of}} biodiesel industry and the existing glycerol market cannot accommodate the excess amounts generated; consequently, new markets for refined glycerol need to be developed. The aim of present work is to optimize the production of microbial rhamnolipid using waste glycerol. We have developed a process for the production of rhamnolipid biosurfactants using glycerol as the sole carbon source by a local Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolate that was obtained from an extensive screening program. A factorial design was applied with the goal of optimizing the rhamnolipid production. The highest production yield was obtained after 2 days when cells were grown in minimal salt media at pH 6, containing 1 % (v/v) glycerol and 2 % (w/v) sodium nitrate as nitrogen source, at 37 °C and at 180 [*]rpm, and reached 2. 164 [*]g/L after 54 hours (0. 04 [*]g/L[*]h). Analysis of the produced rhamnolipids by TLC, HPLC, and FTIR confirmed the nature of the biosurfactant as monorhamnolipid.

40|$|Lipases {{catalyze}} hydrolysis of fat/lipid {{into their}} components. Microbial lipases are preferred than {{the animal and}} plant lipases because of their stability, specificity and unique properties. Microbial lipases are excreted {{by a variety of}} bacteria, fungi and yeasts. Lipases are used in various industries (pharmaceutical, food, <b>detergent,</b> <b>oil,</b> paper etc). At present the demand of industries for lipases are very higher, therefore we have to increase the production of enzyme form indigenous microbial strains in order to fulfill the various applications in industries. Normally microbial strain produces little amount of lipases to meet the cellular requirements but for the industrial purposes, the amount of lipases can be enhanced by the optimization technique. Different parameters (carbon sources, nitrogen sources, pH, temperature and incubation period) can be optimized in order to increase productivity of lipase. Lipase production is normally stimulated in presence of lipidic carbon sources (oil) into the culture media, which indicates the inducible nature of microbial lipases. By keeping the above points in mind, the present review is focused on optimization of culture medium constituents and growth conditions for increased growth of lipolytic fungi and productivity of extracellular lipase.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} an {{experimental study of}} calixarate overbased <b>detergent</b> <b>oil</b> additives, used to neutralise acidic by-products of engine combustion. Aspects {{of interest in this}} study include experimental synthesis of calixarenes and overbased detergents, physical and structural characterisation and monitoring of the synthesis process. Two types of calixarenes were prepared (6 and 8 phenolic units). A synthesis procedure of the calixarate overbased detergent was set up, based on adaptation of existing procedures used for other classes of overbased detergents. The procedure was also modified to suit a lab-scale. " 1 " 3 C NMR and UV-Vis spectroscopy have provided strong evidence for a precursor of the overbased detergent. The ionisation of the surfactants (stearic acid carboxylic group, and phenolic units) was clearly established. The synthesis process was monitored at the molecular and macroscopic level. The use of " 1 " 3 C-labelled compounds enabled a semi-quantitative study of the concentration evolution of each chemical during the synthesis. Langmuir- trough measurements and dynamic light scattering showed a decrease of particle size during the synthesis of the overbased detergent. The final calixarate overbased detergent was then fully characterised by these two methods. Based on the various information gathered (starting and final material characterisation, monitoring of the process), a mechanism was suggested. This involved a progressive solvation of calcium hydroxide, and breakdown of mixed calcium hydroxide and calcium carbonate.

40|$|Acinetobacter baumannii {{has emerged}} as a serious {{problematic}} pathogen due to the ever-increasing presence of antibiotic resistance, demonstrating a need for novel, broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapeutic options. Antimicrobial nanoemulsions are emulsified mixtures of <b>detergent,</b> <b>oil,</b> and water (droplet size, 100 to 800 nm) which have broad antimicrobial activity against bacteria, enveloped viruses, and fungi. Here, we screened the antimicrobial activities of five nanoemulsion preparations against four Acinetobacter baumannii isolates to identify the most suitable preparation for further evaluation. Among them, N 5, which contains 10 % (vol/vol) Triton X- 100, 25 % (vol/vol) soybean oil, and 1 % (wt/vol) cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC), showed the best efficacy against A. baumannii in both its planktonic and biofilm forms and was selected for further study. Our data demonstrate that, while the killing of planktonic forms of A. baumannii was due to the 1 % CPC component of our nanoemulsions, the breakdown of biofilms was achieved via the emulsified oil and detergent fractions. Furthermore, we documented the effect of ethanol and NaCl in combination with N 5 on planktonic A. baumannii. In killing curves of N 5 combined with other agents (ethanol or NaCl), a synergistic effect of a ≥ 2 -log decrease in CFU/ml was observed. The antibiofilm activity of N 5 was confirmed via a cell proliferation test and scanning electron microscopy. The effects of exposure to severe environmental conditions, which simulates the field conditions in Iraq and Afghanistan, were evaluated, and this exposure did not affect the overall antimicrobial activity of N 5. These studies lay a solid foundation for the utilization of nanoemulsions against the antibiotic-resistant forms of A. baumannii...|$|E

Greywater has potential to cause adverse environmental effects because of concentrations of nutrients and other oxygen-demanding materials, in particular. Greywater is typically the largest source of liquid waste generated by cruise ships (90 to 95 percent of the total). Estimates of greywater range from 110 to 320 liters per day per person, or 330,000 to 960,000 liters per day for a 3,000-person cruise ship.|$|R

The results were: 1. Eels kept in water containing crude oil showed marked degeneration of proximal renal tubules. There was some regeneration of tubular epithelial cells {{and an increase in}} hemosiderin-like substance in the interstitial tissue of the kidney and spleen, suggesting accelerated hemolysis. The increased deposition of hemosiderin-like substance seemed to be due to hemolytic activity of the benzine, toluene and xylene contained in crude oil. No marked changes were seen in the liver, gills, muscle, intestine or other organs examined. 2. Eels exposed to <b>oil</b> <b>detergents</b> also showed kidney damage, tubular necrosis and regeneration. Increased deposition of hemosiderin-like granules was evident.

Severe degeneration of the proximal renal tubules was observed with poor regeneration of the epithelial cells.
