5|$|Gene Kelly (1912–1996) was an American dancer, actor, singer, director, {{producer}} and choreographer whose work in motion pictures spans from 1942 to 1996. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> best known today for his performances in musicals, notably An American in Paris (1951) and Singin' in the Rain (1952).|$|E
5|$|Douglas's output {{included}} new churches, restoring and renovating existing churches, church furnishings, {{new houses}} and alterations to existing houses, {{and a variety}} of other buildings, including shops, banks, offices, schools, memorials and public buildings. His architectural styles were eclectic. Douglas worked during the period of the Gothic Revival, and many of his works incorporate elements of the English Gothic style. He was also influenced by architectural styles from the mainland of Europe and included elements of French, German and Dutch architecture. However <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> best remembered for his incorporation of vernacular elements in his buildings, in particular half-timbering, influenced by the black-and-white revival in Chester. Other vernacular elements he incorporated include tile-hanging, pargeting, and the use of decorative brick in diapering and the design of tall chimney stacks. Of particular importance is Douglas's use of joinery and highly detailed wood carving.|$|E
25|$|<b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> {{best known}} for his design input into the Royal College of Art.|$|E
5000|$|His {{early life}} <b>is</b> unknown. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> born on Ribeira Grande (now Cidade Velha) {{and was the}} first colonial {{governor}} who was born in Cape Verde. [...] <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>was</b> one of the first Portuguese people born in Cape Verde. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> likely a son of the explorer Diogo Afonso.|$|R
25|$|<b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> born around 1298.|$|R

25|$|Moore's media career covers fifty years, from KPFA in Berkeley in 1949 to his {{retirement}} from KTCA, Minneapolis-Saint Paul in 2000. Although {{the last eight}} years were spent as the CEO of Twin Cities Public Television <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> best remembered as a filmmaker.|$|E
25|$|<b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> {{best known}} today for being popularly {{supposed}} to have more pubs named after him than any other person - due, it is said, to his practice of setting up old soldiers of his regiment as publicans when they were too old to serve any longer.|$|E
25|$|River Troll– A troll {{who appears}} in The Seeing Stone. He {{lives in a}} nearby river, {{underneath}} local bridges. A reference to the many dumb trolls of faery tales, Jared tricks him into letting him and his siblings live and to eat the goblins chasing them. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> the same troll who ate Arthur Spiderwick's infant brother.|$|E
25|$|His {{contribution}} to the canal system was huge, and since <b>he</b> <b>was</b> responsible for {{three of the four}} longest canal tunnels built, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> the first great tunnelling engineer. Although it <b>is</b> not certain, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> also consulted on the Standedge Tunnel prior to its construction.|$|R
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> born in Ansley, Warwickshire.|$|R
50|$|Unlike many composers of the time, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> not a cleric, {{though there}} are links with St Albans Abbey (see below); <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> married, based on the record of women sharing his name in his parish, and he also owned a manor in Hertfordshire.|$|R
25|$|Thomas Seymour, 1st Baron Seymour of Sudeley, KG (c. 1508 – 20 March 1549) was {{the brother}} of the English queen Jane Seymour who was the third wife of King Henry VIII and mother of King Edward VI. He was also the fourth husband of Catherine Parr who was the sixth and last wife of Henry VIII. However, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> best known for his {{influence}} {{in the life of the}} future Queen Elizabeth I.|$|E
25|$|<b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> {{the second}} fastest bowler in Sri Lanka, behind Lasith Malinga. Despite {{not making it}} to the Caribbean he was {{selected}} in the Sri Lankan squad for a post World Cup tournament against Pakistan at Abu Dhabi. He made his One Day International debut in {{the first game of the}} series but failed to take a wicket. However, he made significant strides in the 2008 CB series, where he picked up 8 wickets at 35.75 each.|$|E
25|$|Arthur O. Gibbons (1859–1915) of Norwich, Connecticut was {{the last}} captain of the A. T. Gifford. He was unmarried, the son of Mrs. Mary A. (Gibbons) Murray of Norwich. He is presumably the same Arthur O. Gibbons who is listed as {{the master of the}} Francis Allyn (1897, 1899), the Ellen A. Swift (1902, 1906), and Charles W. Morgan (1908). <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> the same man as Arthur B. Gibbons who captained the Sarah W. Hunt in 1892 and 1893, and perhaps the Margaret, the Bertha (1902, 1911), and the T. Towner.|$|E
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> {{related to}} the {{sculptor}} Guido Mazzoni.|$|R
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> {{the son of}} William Coventre I.|$|R
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>was</b> born in Oviedo, {{where he}} spent his early life {{in the court of}} Alfonso II. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> {{associated}} with the crown from an early age. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> raised in Lugo, capital of the province of Galicia, of which his father, Ramiro, had been named governor. There <b>he</b> <b>was</b> educated, including in the military arts.|$|R
25|$|The most {{important}} of the known artists of the older generation is the Inscription Painter, of the younger representatives the Phineus Painter. The former is presumably the originator of the style; some 170 of the surviving vases are attributed to the very productive workshop of the latter. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> also the last representative of this style. The images are usually more decorative than narrative. Riders, animal friezes, heraldic pictures or groups of people are shown. A large lotus-palmette cross is frequently part of the picture. Mythological scenes are seldom, but when they occur they are in general of exceptionally high quality.|$|E
25|$|An early French {{supporter}} of American independence, Beaumarchais lobbied the French government {{on behalf of}} the American rebels during the American War of Independence. Beaumarchais oversaw covert aid from the French and Spanish governments to supply arms and financial assistance to the rebels in the years before France's formal entry into the war in 1778. He later struggled to recover money he had personally invested in the scheme. Beaumarchais was also a participant {{in the early stages of}} the French Revolution. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> best known, however, for his theatrical works, especially the three Figaro plays.|$|E
25|$|Lassus {{wrote in}} all the {{prominent}} secular forms of the time. In the preface to his collection of German songs, Lassus lists his secular works: Italian madrigals and French chansons, German and Dutch songs. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> the only Renaissance composer to write prolifically in five languages– Latin {{in addition to those}} mentioned above– and he wrote with equal fluency in each. Many of his songs became hugely popular, circulating widely in Europe. In these various secular songs, he conforms to the manner of the country of origin while still showing his characteristic originality, wit, and terseness of statement.|$|E
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> {{the son of}} Spurius Postumius Albinus Magnus.|$|R
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> {{the father}} of the {{instrument}} maker Antonio Bianchino.|$|R

25|$|In an anecdotal account, Simmons {{reported}} that a female marsh harrier courted a male to obtain access to food he had stored. She then took this food and fed it to chicks that had been fathered by another male. More extensive studies focused on possibly deceitful behaviour in the pied flycatcher, a species in which males may possess more than one territory. Females gain from mating with a male that has no other mates and males may try to deceive females about their mating status (mated or unmated). Females frequently visit the male, {{and if he is}} always alone on his territory <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> unmated. Thus, by repeated sampling of male behaviour, females are usually able to avoid mating with previously mated males.|$|E
25|$|Notes: 1) The {{story has}} some {{parallels}} to {{the legend of}} John Henry. 2) In this story it is learned that England's American colonies broke off into a new nation - the Federated Commonwealths of America - in 1738, and westward expansion began much sooner than in our history, {{due to the lack}} of indigenous humans in the regions to be colonized. 3) The character Trevithick is American rather than British, and appears to be 20 years older than his historic age, so <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> not the historical figure but an analog. In Turtledove works, it is common for historic figures to have fictitious offspring (as with Edward Wingfield's daughter and her own great-grandson Thomas Kenton above) as a result of the butterfly effect.|$|E
25|$|However, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> {{best remembered}} {{for one of}} the key second innings batting {{partnerships}} with Ian Botham during the famous Headingley Ashes game of 1981, where they put on 67 crucial runs for the 9th wicket. He followed this up by taking the key wicket of Allan Border who he clean bowled for a duck in the Australian second innings. He was the only England cricketer to play in both Centenary Test Matches against Australia in 1977 at Melbourne and 1980 at Lord's, alongside Greg Chappell, Dennis Lillee and Rodney Marsh for Australia. Old turned down an invitation from Tony Greig to play in Kerry Packer's rebel World Series Cricket, fearing the withdrawal of the traditional benefit season offered by Yorkshire. He subsequently joined the rebel South African Breweries English touring side in South Africa during 1982 effectively ending his Test career with the resulting 3-year ban from international cricket.|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} year, on 23 March 931 at Colchester <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> {{named as}} the fourth ealdorman {{on a list}} of witnesses; probably fifth on 20 June at Worthy in Hampshire, and fourth on 12 November at Lifton in Devon. He witnesses a further three extant charters of 932, on 30 August at Milton in either Kent or Dorset (fifth ealdorman), on 9 November at Exeter in Devon (seventh ealdorman), and on Christmas Eve at Amesbury in Wiltshire (as fourth ealdorman). Two subscriptions occur in 933, on 11 January (fifth ealdorman) and 26 January (fourth), respectively at Wilton and Chippenham, both in Wiltshire; two in 934, at Winchester and Nottingham on 28 May (eighth) and 7 June (fifth); and one in 935, on 21 December (fourth) at Dorchester. Simon Keynes' Atlas of Attestations lists this Uhtred as witness to nine more charters during Æthelstan's reign, three in 937, two in 938, and four in 939; he is the second ealdorman in all cases for the years 937 and 938, and in 939 he occurs fourth three times and fifth once.|$|E
25|$|Given lack of {{information}} on political preferences of his parents {{it is not clear}} whether Arellano inherited the Carlist outlook from his ancestors; it appears to be the case as most of the siblings got involved in Traditionalism. It is also neither known whether he was engaged in any of the three Traditionalist streams prior to their re-unification in the early 1930s. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> first noted as active within the public realm during the first electoral campaign of the Republic in 1931; engaged in Juventud Tradicionalista, he kept delivering harangues in favor of Carlist candidates in small locations like Sangüesa in Eastern Navarre. Already the following year he was recorded busy in Carlist propaganda beyond his native region, speaking at various meetings during Gran Setmana Tradicionalista in Catalonia. During that period he must have approached Tomás Domínguez Arévalo, the Carlist national political leader, 24 years his senior but native of Villafranca, just 9km away from Caparroso. When discussing the 1933 events scholars already refer to Arellano as Arévalo's protégé; indeed conde Rodezno remained Arellano's mentor for the next 20 years.|$|E
25|$|The main feud {{heading into}} No Mercy was between World Heavyweight Champion King Booker, Bobby Lashley, Batista, and Finlay. At SummerSlam, the {{pay-per-view}} {{two months before}} No Mercy, Batista defeated King Booker by disqualification after Queen Sharmell interfered, meaning Booker retained the World Heavyweight Title. The next week on SmackDown!, Batista and Lashley faced King Booker's Court (Booker, Finlay, and William Regal) in a three-on-two handicap match. Booker's Court controlled most of the match, isolating Batista and Lashley from each other. Towards {{the end of the}} match, Lashley tagged in Batista, who pinned Booker for the win after a Spinebuster. Two weeks later on the September 8 edition of SmackDown!, Batista faced Booker for the World Heavyweight Championship, which Booker won after Finlay interfered and hit Batista with a shillelagh. After the match, Finlay continued to attack Batista with the shillelagh and a steel chair. The next week on SmackDown!, Finlay began degrading Batista, saying <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> hiding in a hole licking his wounds. As Finlay was about to continue, Lashley came out and said that only someone like him would jump Batista from behind. SmackDown! General Manager Theodore Long then scheduled Finlay to wrestle Lashley later that night to determine the number one contender to the World Heavyweight Championship at No Mercy. Lashley defeated Finlay and became number one contender after Finlay was disqualified for hitting him with a shillelagh. On the September 22 episode of SmackDown!, Lashley teamed up with Batista to take on Finlay and Regal. Midway through the match, Batista and Finlay brawled outside the ring and into the crowd, leaving Regal on his own against Lashley. Lashley gained the pinfall after hitting Regal with a Spear. Later that night Batista was scheduked to wrestle Finlay at No Mercy. Two weeks later on the October 6 episode of SmackDown!, Booker faced off against Finlay and Batista faced off against Lashley, with both matches ending in a no-contest. This lead Theodore Long to schedule a Fatal Four-Way match between the four at No Mercy.|$|E
