In a statement, her parents disassociated themselves from her actions, saying that her decision to enter the porn industry was born of her residence {{in a foreign country}} which had a <b>different</b> <b>culture</b> than theirs, and that her actions did not reflect her upbringing. They {{also said that}} they hoped that she would leave pornography, saying that her image did not honor her family or her home country.|$|E
5|$|Manufacturers aim for a {{moisture}} content of 50-to-52 percent and a fat-in-dry-matter content of 35-to-40 percent. A {{study published in}} the International Journal of Food & Science Technology found that a 12.5:87.5 blend of vetch milk and bovine milk improved stretchiness and melting characteristics. Vetch is a legume that has seeds which are similar to lentils. An experiment published in the International Journal of Dairy Technology suggested that the level of galactose, a monosaccharide sugar that is less sweet than glucose and fructose, can be reduced using <b>different</b> <b>culture</b> techniques. An article in the International Journal of Food Engineering found that trisodium citrate, a food additive used to preserve and add flavor to foods, slightly improved the preferred qualities of pizza cheese. Research published in Dairy Industries International suggested that denatured whey proteins increased moisture retention, but that the improvements were very slight and not economically worthwhile relative to the minor improvements.|$|E
5|$|Kohlberg's stages are not {{culturally}} neutral, {{as demonstrated}} by its application {{to a number of}} <b>different</b> <b>cultures.</b> Although they progress through the stages in the same order, individuals in <b>different</b> <b>cultures</b> seem to do so at different rates. Kohlberg has responded by saying that although <b>different</b> <b>cultures</b> do indeed inculcate different beliefs, his stages correspond to underlying modes of reasoning, rather than to those beliefs.|$|R

25|$|Some {{scholars}} look at {{the linguistic}} relationships between the myths of <b>different</b> <b>cultures.</b> For example, {{the similarities between the}} names of gods in <b>different</b> <b>cultures.</b> One particularly successful example of this approach is the study of Indo-European mythology. Scholars have found striking similarities between the mythological and religious terms used in <b>different</b> <b>cultures</b> of Europe and India. For example, the Greek sky-god Zeus Pater, the Roman sky-god Jupiter, and the Indian (Vedic) sky-god Dyauṣ Pitṛ have linguistically identical names.|$|R

50|$|Individuals who employ {{cultural}} appropriation {{have the}} ability to produce works of considerable aesthetic merit.

40|$|Abstract The {{main goal}} {{of this paper is}} to show the role of culture in the Electronic Learning Environment. The diverse effect of {{influencing}} factors on student satisfaction in <b>different</b> <b>cultures</b> in Electronic Learning environment is proposed. A theoretical model has been proposed showing the moderating role of culture between the relationship of influencing factors and student e-learning satisfaction. Cultural differences change the perspectives of individuals’, keeping in view; the Hofstede’s cultural dimensions; power-distance, uncertainty avoidance, and individualism theoretical linkages are justified with the influencing factors namely Human Factor, Course Factor and Technological Factor using literature. Administration should consider the factors that have been pointed out in this study, for successful implementation of EL education system in <b>different</b> <b>cultures.</b> The proposed model can be justified by applying empirical research on the variables in <b>different</b> <b>cultures.</b> Individuals in <b>different</b> <b>cultures</b> have <b>different</b> perspective. The satisfaction level or criteria vary in <b>different</b> <b>cultures</b> in electronic learning environment. The cultural impact is not been measured yet considering the influencing factors...|$|R
25|$|He wrote: The Garden of Philosophy {{is exactly}} the step toward this direction. It is created to start from one centre. Around this centre point there are three rings. The first one is a {{complete}} ring around the centre point. The five figures (Abraham, Echnaton, Jesus, Buddha and Lao Tse) around the centre point are symbolizing <b>different</b> <b>culture</b> of the world. They made the ideas and became founder of main religions of the world. The centre of each religion has different name like Kamisama, Hotokesama, God or Allah but itself is not different. The second ring is the group of people from <b>different</b> <b>culture</b> and time who resulted in spiritual enlightenment {{and everyone in the}} same way they acted this result in practice in their society (Mahatma Gandhi, Daruma Taishi and Saint Francis). The third ring is a group of people of law in different country and different time. They made a law, which became mainstream of existing laws of today. They are Hamurabi, Justinianus and Shotoku Taishi.|$|E

25|$|The {{arguments}} for self-determination {{are based on}} Cabindans' cultural and ethnic background. Prior to the Treaty of Simulambuco, three kingdoms existed {{in what is now}} referred to as Cabinda: Cacongo, Ngoyo, and Loango. The Cabindans belong to the Bakongo ethnic group whose language is Kikongo. The Bakongo also comprise {{the majority of the population}} in Uíge and Zaire provinces of Angola. However, despite this shared ancestry, the Cabindans developed a very <b>different</b> <b>culture</b> and distinct variants of the Kikongo language.|$|E

25|$|Some {{scholars}} {{propose that}} myths from <b>different</b> <b>cultures</b> reveal the same, or similar, psychological {{forces at work}} in those cultures. Some Freudian thinkers have identified stories similar to the Greek story of Oedipus in many <b>different</b> <b>cultures.</b> They argue that these stories reflect the different expressions of the Oedipus complex in those cultures. Likewise, Jungians have identified images, themes, and patterns that appear in the myths of many <b>different</b> <b>cultures.</b> They believe that these similarities result from archetypes present in the unconscious levels of every person's mind.|$|R
50|$|Goans mediate between cultures, Goans live between <b>different</b> <b>cultures,</b> Goans are {{travellers}} {{from one}} part of the world to another. This, in my opinion, happened when East and West met in Goans under pressure with the Portuguese conquest. Since that time, our usefulness to the world, wherever we are, is that we can understand <b>different</b> <b>cultures</b> and help people from <b>different</b> <b>cultures</b> understand one another. The disadvantage is that if we don't work on it, we may end up not knowing who we are.|$|R
25|$|Guildford Grammar School traces its {{foundations}} to 1896 when Charles Harper, {{an influential}} Western Australian, {{established in the}} billiard room of his house (Woodbridge House) a school (under the guidance of Frank Bennett, the first headmaster) which was to cater to {{the educational needs of}} his children and those from the surrounding district. Harper's vision was to create a school based on the English public school system, whilst also attempting to accommodate the <b>different</b> <b>culture</b> of the modern colonial society.|$|E
25|$|The Galata Bridge was a {{symbolic}} {{link between the}} traditional city of Istanbul proper, site of the imperial palace and principal religious and secular institutions of the empire, and the districts of Galata, Beyoğlu, Şişli and Harbiye, where {{a large proportion of}} the inhabitants were non-Muslims and where foreign merchants and diplomats lived and worked. As Peyami Safa wrote in his novel, Fatih-Harbiye, a person who went from Fatih to Harbiye via the bridge set foot in a different civilization and a <b>different</b> <b>culture.</b> Apart from its place in fiction, the romantic appearance of the Galata Bridge made it the subject of many paintings and engravings.|$|E
25|$|When the Spanish {{arrived in}} western Nicaragua {{in the early}} 16th century, they found three {{principal}} tribes, each with a <b>different</b> <b>culture</b> and language: the Niquirano, the Chorotegano, and the Chontal. Each one of these diverse groups occupied much of Nicaragua territory, with independent chieftains who ruled according to each group's laws and customs. Their weapons consisted of swords, lances, and arrows made out of wood. Monarchy was the form of government of most tribes; the supreme ruler was the chief, or cacique, who, surrounded by his princes, formed the nobility. Laws and regulations were disseminated by royal messengers who visited each township and assembled the inhabitants to give their chief's orders.|$|E

25|$|While Christians in India do {{not share}} one common culture, their {{cultures}} {{for the most part}} tend to be a blend of Indian, Syrian and European cultures. It differs from one region to another depending on several factors such as the prevailing rite and tradition and the extent of time for which Christianity has existed in those regions. The ancient Saint Thomas Christians of Kerala have a distinctively <b>different</b> <b>culture</b> when compared to Christians {{in other parts of the}} country. Historical ties with the Assyrian Church and assimilation of Indian traditions have contributed to the development of a unique culture among these traditional Syrian Christians or Nasranis of Kerala. The use of ornamental umbrellas for Christian religious festivities illustrates an example of the indigenous character of Kerala's Syriac Christianity.|$|E
25|$|After {{the passing}} the Statute of Rhuddlan (1284), which {{restricted}} Welsh laws, King Edward I's ring of impressive stone castles {{assisted in the}} domination of Wales, and he crowned his conquest by giving the title Prince of Wales to his son and heir in 1301. Wales became, effectively, part of England, even though its people spoke a different language and had a <b>different</b> <b>culture.</b> English kings appointed a Council of Wales, sometimes presided over by {{the heir to the}} throne. This Council normally sat in Ludlow, now in England but at that time still part of the disputed border area in the Welsh Marches. Welsh literature, particularly poetry, continued to flourish, however, with the lesser nobility now taking over from the princes as the patrons of the poets. Many consider Dafydd ap Gwilym, who flourished {{in the middle of the}} 14th century, the greatest of the Welsh poets.|$|E
25|$|India has 29 {{states with}} <b>different</b> <b>culture</b> and civilizations {{and one of}} the most {{populated}} countries in the world. The Indian culture, often labeled as an amalgamation of several various cultures, spans across the Indian subcontinent and has been influenced and shaped by a history that is several thousand years old. Throughout the history of India, Indian culture has been heavily influenced by Dharmic religions. They have been credited with shaping much of Indian philosophy, literature, architecture, art and music. Greater India was the historical extent of Indian culture beyond the Indian subcontinent. This particularly concerns the spread of Hinduism, Buddhism, architecture, administration and writing system from India to other parts of Asia through the Silk Road by the travellers and maritime traders during the early centuries of the Common Era. To the west, Greater India overlaps with Greater Persia in the Hindu Kush and Pamir Mountains. Over the centuries, there has been significant fusion of cultures between Buddhists, Hindus, Muslims, Jains, Sikhs and various tribal populations in India.|$|E
