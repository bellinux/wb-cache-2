25|$|A {{version was}} {{broadcast}} on ABC on Australian television in 1957. It was aired live in Melbourne on 18 December 1957, and was kinescoped {{to be shown}} in Sydney on Christmas Day. It is not known if the <b>kinescope</b> <b>recording</b> still exists.|$|E
500|$|Paramount's {{television}} division, Television Productions, Inc., {{created the}} Paramount Television Network in 1948. A full-page advertisement announcing {{the newly created}} network, with KTLA as the flagship station, ran in Billboard on May 22 of that year. Filming of programs took place at KTLA; a coaxial cable link between KTLA and KFMB-TV in San Diego transmitted a live signal to San Diego viewers. Other television stations across the United States received Paramount programs via <b>kinescope</b> <b>recording</b> for airing; these filmed series allowed stations to [...] "fill in" [...] their schedules during hours when ABC, NBC, CBS and DuMont were not broadcasting shows, or when station managers preferred Paramount's filmed offerings {{to those of the}} four networks. Station managers at WBKB-TV in Chicago also had plans to distribute their own kinescoped programs.|$|E
50|$|Denzil Howson who {{was then}} Assistant Programme Manager at GTV9, was asked by Norman Spencer to develop a daily children's programme. A pilot of the show was <b>kinescope</b> <b>recorded</b> onto film. The program started on Melbourne's GTV-9 on 21 January 1957 (only {{two days after the}} {{official}} opening of GTV9), debuting from the Myer Emporium Lonsdale St store window, as the GTV9 studios in Bendigo Street, Richmond were still under construction. Normally the program was produced from GTV-9, but some editions were taped at ATN-7 in Sydney to help build the audience there.|$|R
50|$|CBS Television Quiz was aired live, {{prior to}} the {{adoption}} of <b>kinescopes</b> for <b>recording</b> programs and long before videotape. The show does not have any extant audio recordings or photographs, {{making it one of the}} few game shows to be completely lost.|$|R
50|$|In the studio, {{when two}} or three Electronicam cameras were used, a <b>kinescope</b> system <b>{{recorded}}</b> the live feed (as broadcast), so the Electronicam films could later be edited to match. The audio was recorded separately, onto either a magnetic fullcoat (1952, and all later) or as an optical soundtrack negative (pre-1952).|$|R
500|$|DuMont {{began with}} one basic disadvantage: unlike NBC, CBS and ABC, {{it did not}} have a radio network from which to draw big-name talent, {{affiliate}} loyalty or radio profits to underwrite television operations until the television medium itself became profitable. Most early television licenses were granted to established radio broadcasters, and many longtime relationships with radio networks carried over to the new medium. As CBS and NBC (and to a lesser extent, ABC) gained their footing, they began to offer programming that drew on their radio backgrounds, bringing over the most popular radio stars. Early television station owners, when deciding which network would receive their main affiliation, were more likely to choose CBS's roster of Lucille Ball, Jack Benny and Ed Sullivan, or NBC's lineup of Milton Berle and Sid Caesar over DuMont, which offered a then-unknown Jackie Gleason and Bishop Fulton J. Sheen. In smaller markets, with a limited number of stations, DuMont and ABC were often relegated to secondary status, so their programs got clearance only if the primary network was off the air or delayed via <b>kinescope</b> <b>recording</b> ("teletranscriptions" [...] in DuMont parlance).|$|E

5000|$|Though {{not exactly}} labeled as such, there were early {{precedents}} for [...] "television movies", such as Talk Faster, Mister, which aired on WABD (now WNYW) in New York City on December 18, 1944, and {{was produced by}} RKO Pictures, or the 1957 The Pied Piper of Hamelin, based on the poem by Robert Browning, and starring Van Johnson, {{one of the first}} filmed [...] "family musicals" [...] made directly for television. That film was made in Technicolor, a first for television, which ordinarily used color processes originated by specific networks (most [...] "family musicals" [...] of the time, such as Peter Pan, were not filmed but broadcast live and preserved on <b>kinescope,</b> a <b>recording</b> of a television program made by filming the picture from a video monitor - and the only (relatively inexpensive) method of recording a television program until the invention of videotape).|$|R
5000|$|The NTSC field refresh {{frequency}} in the black-and-white system originally exactly matched the nominal 60 Hz frequency of alternating current power {{used in the}} United States. Matching the field refresh rate to the power source avoided intermodulation (also called beating), which produces rolling bars on the screen. Synchronization of the refresh rate to the power incidentally helped <b>kinescope</b> cameras <b>record</b> early live television broadcasts, as it was very simple to synchronize a film camera to capture one frame of video on each film frame by using the alternating current frequency to set {{the speed of the}} synchronous AC motor-drive camera. When color was added to the system, the refresh frequency was shifted slightly downward by 0.1% to approximately 59.94 Hz to eliminate stationary dot patterns in the difference frequency between the sound and color carriers, as explained below in [...] "Color encoding". By the time the frame rate changed to accommodate color, it was nearly as easy to trigger the camera shutter from the video signal itself.|$|R
50|$|In 1964, Jan and Dean {{were signed}} to host {{what became the}} first multi-act Rock and Roll show that was edited into a motion picture {{designed}} for wide distribution. The T.A.M.I. Show became a seminal and original production - in essence {{one of the first}} rock videos - on its release in 1964. Using a high-resolution videotape process called Electronovision (transferred from television directly onto 35mm motion picture stock as a <b>kinescope),</b> new sound <b>recording</b> techniques and having a remarkable cast, The T.A.M.I. Show set the standard for all succeeding music film and video work, including many of the early videos shown by MTV 17 years later. The revolutionary technical achievements of The T.A.M.I. Show and the legendary list of performers (including a performance by James Brown that many critics have called the best of his career) marked a high point for Jan and Dean, as they were the hosts and one of the main featured acts as well. They became one of the main faces of mid-1960s music, until Berry's auto accident two years later, through their T.A.M.I. Show appearance.|$|R

5000|$|Thoroughbred owners began {{sending their}} {{successful}} Derby horses to compete {{a few weeks}} later in the Preakness Stakes at the Pimlico Race Course, in Baltimore, Maryland, followed by the Belmont Stakes in Elmont, New York. The three races offered the largest purse and in 1919 Sir Barton became the first horse to win all three races. However, the term Triple Crown didn't come into use for another eleven years. In 1930, when Gallant Fox became the second horse to win all three races, sportswriter Charles Hatton brought the phrase into American usage. Fueled by the media, public interest in the possibility of a [...] "superhorse" [...] that could win the Triple Crown began in {{the weeks leading up to}} the derby. Two years after the term was coined, the race, which had been run in mid-May since inception, was changed to the first Saturday in May to allow for a specific schedule for the Triple Crown races. Since 1931, the order of Triple Crown races has been the Kentucky Derby first, followed by the Preakness Stakes and then the Belmont Stakes. Prior to 1931, eleven times the Preakness was run before the Derby. On May 12, 1917 and again on May 13, 1922, the Preakness and the Derby were run on the same day. On eleven occasions the Belmont Stakes was run before the Preakness Stakes.On May 16, 1925, the first live radio broadcast of the Kentucky Derby was originated by WHAS and was also carried by WGN in Chicago. On May 7, 1949, the first television coverage of the Kentucky Derby took place, produced by WAVE-TV, the NBC affiliate in Louisville. This coverage was aired live in the Louisville market and sent to NBC as a <b>kinescope</b> newsreel <b>recording</b> for national broadcast. This broadcast was the first time Zoomar lenses were used on a broadcast TV sports show. On May 3, 1952, the first national television coverage of the Kentucky Derby took place, aired from then-CBS affiliate WHAS-TV. In 1954, the purse exceeded $100,000 for the first time. In 1968 Dancer's Image became the first (and to this day the only) horse to win the race and then be disqualified after traces of phenylbutazone, an analgesic and anti-inflammatory drug, were found in the horse's urinalysis; Forward Pass won after a protracted legal battle by the owners of Dancer's Image (which they lost). Forward Pass thus became the Eighth winner for Calumet Farm. Unexpectedly, the regulations at Kentucky thoroughbred race tracks were changed some years later, allowing horses to run on phenylbutazone. In 1970, Diane Crump became the first female jockey to ride in the Derby, finishing 15th aboard Fathom.|$|R
