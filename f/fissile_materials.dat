5|$|An {{important}} omission {{from the}} Atomic Energy of 1946 was {{any mention of}} non-governmental use of nuclear energy, since military applications overshadowed all others at the time. The restrictions of the act related to secrecy, the control of <b>fissile</b> <b>materials,</b> the ownership of patents and the operation of production facilities placed a number of legal roadblocks {{in the way of}} private nuclear power stations.|$|E
5|$|At Harwell, Pontecorvo {{continued}} {{to be involved in}} reactor design projects. As a member of the Power Steering Committee (PSC), he was involved in discussions of the production and use of <b>fissile</b> <b>materials,</b> and of the materials used in construction of reactors. In 1949, other Via Panisperna boys, particularly Emilio Segrè, began to press their claim over patents relating to the behaviour of slow neutrons, which were at the heart of nuclear reactor—and nuclear weapon—design. The American Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) therefore began looking into their backgrounds. It noted, from its 1943 Manhattan Project files, that Pontecorvo's siblings Guiliana, Laura and Gillo were communists, and that Pontecorvo and Marianne were probably communists too, and reported this to MI5 in Britain, and MI6's Kim Philby in Washington, D.C.|$|E
5|$|Oppenheimer, {{reviewing}} {{his options}} in early 1943, gave {{priority to the}} gun-type weapon, but as a hedge against the threat of pre-detonation, he created the E-5 Group at the Los Alamos Laboratory under Seth Neddermeyer to investigate implosion. Implosion-type bombs were determined to be significantly more efficient in terms of explosive yield per unit mass of fissile material in the bomb, because compressed <b>fissile</b> <b>materials</b> react more rapidly and therefore more completely. It was decided that the plutonium gun would receive {{the bulk of the}} research effort, since it was the project with the least amount of uncertainty involved. It was assumed that the uranium gun-type bomb could be more easily adapted from it.|$|E
50|$|Pakistan has blocked {{negotiation}} of a <b>Fissile</b> <b>Material</b> Cutoff Treaty as {{it continues to}} produce <b>fissile</b> <b>material</b> for weapons.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Fissile</b> <b>Material</b> Cutoff Treaty (FMCT) is a {{proposed}} international treaty to prohibit the further production of <b>fissile</b> <b>material</b> {{for nuclear weapons}} or other explosive devices. The treaty has not been negotiated and its terms remain to be defined. According to a proposal by the United States, <b>fissile</b> <b>material</b> includes high-enriched uranium and plutonium (except plutonium that is over 80% Pu-238). According to a proposal by Russia, <b>fissile</b> <b>material</b> {{would be limited to}} weapons-grade uranium (with more than 90% U-235) and plutonium (with more than 90% Pu-239). Neither proposal would prohibit the production of <b>fissile</b> <b>material</b> for non-weapons purposes, including use in civil or naval nuclear reactors.|$|R
50|$|In nuclear engineering, <b>fissile</b> <b>{{material}}</b> is material {{capable of}} sustaining a nuclear fission chain reaction. By definition, <b>fissile</b> <b>material</b> can sustain {{a chain reaction}} with neutrons of any energy. The predominant neutron energy may be typified by either slow neutrons (i.e., a thermal system) or fast neutrons. <b>Fissile</b> <b>material</b> {{can be used to}} fuel thermal-neutron reactors, fast-neutron reactors and nuclear explosives.|$|R
5|$|An Associate Professor of Radiology at the University of Rochester School of Medicine, Stafford L. Warren, was {{commissioned}} as a {{colonel in the}} United States Army Medical Corps, and appointed as chief of the MED's Medical Section and Groves' medical advisor. Warren's initial task was to staff hospitals at Oak Ridge, Richland and Los Alamos. The Medical Section was responsible for medical research, {{but also for the}} MED's health and safety programs. This presented an enormous challenge, because workers were handling a variety of toxic chemicals, using hazardous liquids and gases under high pressures, working with high voltages, and performing experiments involving explosives, not to mention the largely unknown dangers presented by radioactivity and handling <b>fissile</b> <b>materials.</b> Yet in December 1945, the National Safety Council presented the Manhattan Project with the Award of Honor for Distinguished Service to Safety in recognition of its safety record. Between January 1943 and June 1945, there were 62 fatalities and 3,879 disabling injuries, which was about 62 percent below the rate of private industry.|$|E
5|$|Occupational {{health and}} safety {{presented}} a challenge, because workers were handling a variety of toxic chemicals, using hazardous liquids and gases under high pressures, and working with high voltages, {{not to mention the}} largely unknown dangers presented by radioactivity and handling <b>fissile</b> <b>materials.</b> Accidents represented unacceptable numbers of work days lost, and a vigorous safety program was instituted. Since it did not matter where accidents occurred, this included safety off the job, in homes and in the schools. Safety indoctrination was included in job training, and safety training courses were held. Safety posters, manuals and films were distributed. In December 1945, the National Safety Council presented the Manhattan Project with the Award of Honor for Distinguished Service to Safety in recognition of its safety record. The Clinton Engineer Works also received an award of merit in the National Traffic Safety Contest. Many workers had to drive long distances over poorly built and inadequately maintained roads. There were 21 deaths from motor vehicles at the Clinton Engineer Works: two in 1943, nine in 1944, eight in 1945 and two in 1946. This represented a better road safety record than other towns of comparable size.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the need}} for a fission primary, and the {{difficulty}} of purifying weapons-grade <b>fissile</b> <b>materials,</b> the majority of arms control efforts to limit nuclear proliferation rely on the detection and control of the fissile material and the equipment needed to obtain it.|$|E
5000|$|The {{ratio of}} new <b>fissile</b> <b>material</b> in spent fuel to <b>fissile</b> <b>material</b> {{consumed}} from the fresh fuel {{is known as}} the [...] "conversion ratio" [...] or [...] "breeding ratio" [...] of a reactor.|$|R
40|$|Due to {{increasing}} terrorist threats and illegal proliferation of nuclear material and technology, {{there is a}} need for increased research in the area of detection of smuggled <b>fissile</b> <b>material,</b> some of which is designated by the International Atomic Energy Agency as special <b>fissile</b> <b>material.</b> This thesis focuses on a hypothetical scenario in which a terrorist organization has managed to smuggle an amount of special <b>fissile</b> <b>material</b> onto a personal recreational watercraft and sail it into a marina. If the boat could be forced to go through a detector system, then the contents could be interrogated and a determination made of whether any special <b>fissile</b> <b>material</b> was aboard. This thesis examines the hypothesis that active interrogation may be used successfully in the detection of special <b>fissile</b> <b>material</b> in such an environment. It shows that it is feasible to use an active neutron system to detect a significant quantity of special <b>fissile</b> <b>material</b> onboard a small boat via the differential dieaway technique. The MCNP Monte Carlo transport code was used to simulate the use of a pulsed neutron generator to induce fission in the <b>fissile</b> <b>material</b> and then estimate the detector response. The detector modeled was based on elastic scattering-induced recoil protons using pure hydrogen gas. There was a significant difference between the system with and without the presence of <b>fissile</b> <b>material,</b> and the estimated detector response for the system with <b>fissile</b> <b>material</b> present was shown to be sufficiently greater than the response due to background radiation only. Additionally, dose was estimated and found to be small enough that the system would not likely pose a significant radiological health risk to passengers on the boat...|$|R
50|$|Geometry/shape of the fissile material: If {{neutrons}} escape (leak from) the fissile {{system they}} are not available to cause fission events in the <b>fissile</b> <b>material.</b> Therefore, {{the shape of the}} <b>fissile</b> <b>material</b> affects the probability of occurrence of fission events. A shape with a large surface area, such as a thin slab, favors leakage and is safer than the same amount of <b>fissile</b> <b>material</b> in a small, compact shape such as a cube or sphere.|$|R
25|$|There is no {{evidence}} that civilian heavy water power reactors—such as the CANDU or Atucha designs—have been used to produce military <b>fissile</b> <b>materials.</b> In nations that do not already possess nuclear weapons, nuclear material at these facilities is under IAEA safeguards to discourage any diversion.|$|E
25|$|Materials {{which can}} sustain a chain {{reaction}} are called fissile. The two <b>fissile</b> <b>materials</b> used in nuclear weapons are: U-235, also known as highly enriched uranium (HEU), oralloy (Oy) meaning Oak Ridge Alloy, or 25 (the last digits of the atomic number, which is 92 for uranium, and the atomic weight, here 235, respectively); and Pu-239, also known as plutonium, or 49 (from 94 and 239).|$|E
25|$|The {{strategic}} importance {{of nuclear weapons}} is a major reason why the technology of nuclear fission is politically sensitive. Viable fission bomb designs are, arguably, within the capabilities of many, being relatively simple from an engineering viewpoint. However, the difficulty of obtaining fissile nuclear material to realize the designs {{is the key to}} the relative unavailability of nuclear weapons to all but modern industrialized governments with special programs to produce <b>fissile</b> <b>materials</b> (see uranium enrichment and nuclear fuel cycle.|$|E
25|$|As the <b>fissile</b> <b>material</b> {{growth rate}} {{does not meet}} this objective, it becomes {{necessary}} to look at alternative approaches for obtaining the <b>fissile</b> <b>material.</b> This conclusion is mostly independent of future technical breakthroughs, and complementary to the eventual implementation of the three-stage approach. It was realised {{that the best way}} to get access to the requisite <b>fissile</b> <b>material</b> would be through uranium imports, which was not possible without ending India’s nuclear isolation by U.S. and the NSG.|$|R
50|$|For a given mass of <b>fissile</b> <b>material</b> {{the value}} of k can be {{increased}} by increasing the density. Since the probability per distance traveled for a neutron to collide with a nucleus {{is proportional to the}} material density, increasing the density of a <b>fissile</b> <b>material</b> can increase k. This concept is utilized in the implosion method for nuclear weapons. In these devices, the nuclear chain reaction begins after increasing the density of the <b>fissile</b> <b>material</b> with a conventional explosive.|$|R
50|$|Critical mass {{experiments}} {{determine the}} quantity of <b>fissile</b> <b>material</b> required for criticality {{with a variety of}} <b>fissile</b> <b>material</b> compositions, densities, shapes, and reflectors. They can be sub-critical or super-critical, in which case significant radiation fluxes can be produced. This type of test resulted in several criticality accidents.|$|R
25|$|The Y-12 {{plant in}} Oak Ridge, Tennessee, where mass spectrometers called calutrons had enriched uranium for the Manhattan Project, was {{redesigned}} to make secondaries. Fissile U-235 {{makes the best}} spark plugs because its critical mass is larger, especially in the cylindrical shape of early thermonuclear secondaries. Early experiments used the two <b>fissile</b> <b>materials</b> in combination, as composite Pu-Oy pits and spark plugs, but for mass production, {{it was easier to}} let the factories specialize: plutonium pits in primaries, uranium spark plugs and pushers in secondaries.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of an {{accident}} (or sabotage), it is expected that a fusion reactor would release far less radioactive pollution than would an ordinary fission nuclear station. Furthermore, ITER's type of fusion power has little in common with nuclear weapons technology, and does not produce the <b>fissile</b> <b>materials</b> necessary {{for the construction of a}} weapon. Proponents note that large-scale fusion power would be able to produce reliable electricity on demand, and with virtually zero pollution (no gaseous CO2, SO2, or NOx by-products are produced).|$|E
25|$|Low fissile inventory. Because the fissile fuel is {{concentrated}} in a small core fluid, the actual reactor core is more compact. There is no fissile material in the outer blanket that contains the fertile fuel for breeding. Because of this, the 1968 ORNL design required just 315 kilograms of <b>fissile</b> <b>materials</b> to start up a 250 MW(e) two fluid MSBR reactor. This reduces {{the cost of the}} initial fissile startup charge, and allows more reactors to be started up on any given amount of fissile material.|$|E

500|$|The Manhattan Project {{began in}} October 1941, just before U.S. entry into World War II. Most {{of the project}} was {{concerned}} with producing the necessary <b>fissile</b> <b>materials,</b> but in early 1943, the project director, Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., [...] created the Los Alamos Laboratory, also known as Project Y, under the direction of Robert Oppenheimer to design and build atomic bombs. Within the Los Alamos Laboratory, responsibility for delivery lay with its Ordnance Division, headed by Captain William S. Parsons. With the Ordnance Division, the E-7 Group was created with responsibility for the integration of design and delivery. Led by physicist Norman F. Ramsey, it consisted of himself, Sheldon Dike and Bernard Waldman.|$|E
500|$|At Los Alamos, Slotin's duties {{consisted}} of dangerous criticality testing, first with uranium in Otto Robert Frisch's experiments, and later with plutonium cores. Criticality testing involved bringing masses of <b>fissile</b> <b>materials</b> to near-critical levels {{to establish their}} critical mass values. Scientists referred to this flirting {{with the possibility of}} a nuclear chain reaction as [...] "tickling the dragon's tail", based on a remark by physicist Richard Feynman, who compared the experiments to [...] "tickling the tail of a sleeping dragon". On 16 July 1945, Slotin assembled the core for Trinity, the first detonated atomic device, and became known as the [...] "chief armorer of the United States" [...] for his expertise in assembling nuclear weapons. Slotin received two small circular lead and silver commemorative pins for his work on the project.|$|E
500|$|The vast {{majority}} of the technetium-99m used in medical work is produced by irradiating dedicated highly enriched uranium targets in a reactor, extracting molybdenum-99 from the targets in reprocessing facilities, and recovering at the diagnostic center the technetium-99m produced upon decay of molybdenum-99. Molybdenum-99 in the form of molybdate [...] is adsorbed onto acid alumina (...) in a shielded column chromatograph inside a technetium-99m generator ("technetium cow", also occasionally called a [...] "molybdenum cow"). Molybdenum-99 has a half-life of 67hours, so short-lived technetium-99m (half-life: 6hours), which results from its decay, is being constantly produced. The soluble pertechnetate [...] can then be chemically extracted by elution using a saline solution. A drawback of this process is that it requires targets containing uranium-235, which are subject to the security precautions of <b>fissile</b> <b>materials.</b>|$|E
5000|$|According to Moir and Teller, [...] "once {{started up}} it needs no other fuel except thorium {{because it makes}} {{most or all of}} its own fuel." [...] This only applies to {{breeding}} reactors, that produce at least as much <b>fissile</b> <b>material</b> as they consume. Other reactors require additional <b>fissile</b> <b>material,</b> such as uranium-235 or plutonium.|$|R

500|$|Joining the Manhattan Project in late 1943, Uanna was {{initially}} {{assigned to the}} New England area, where he looked after security at 150 organizations, including key contractors Stone & Webster, General Electric, Westinghouse and American Cyanamid, and universities such as Harvard, Brown, Yale [...] and MIT. He was promoted to first lieutenant on July 25, 1943, captain on March 25, 1944, and ultimately major on June 25, 1945. In August 1944, he was appointed Security Officer for the large town and industrial installation built by the US Government at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, to enrich uranium for an atomic bomb. As such, he oversaw the physical security of the site, and {{was responsible for the}} security clearance of over 50,000 personnel.

500|$|Warren was duly {{commissioned}} as {{a colonel}} in the United States Army Medical Corps on November 3, 1943. He was appointed as chief of the MED's medical section and medical advisor {{to the director of}} the Manhattan Project, with Friedell as his deputy. Warren's office was initially located in New York City but moved to Oak Ridge, Tennessee soon after. Warren's initial task was to staff hospitals at Oak Ridge, Richland, Washington and Los Alamos, New Mexico. Warren's section was responsible for medical research, but also for the MED's health and safety programs. This presented an enormous challenge, because workers were handling a variety of toxic chemicals, using [...] hazardous liquids and gases under high pressures, working with high voltages used in novel ways, and performing experiments involving explosives, not to mention the largely unknown dangers presented by radioactivity and handling <b>fissile</b> <b>materials.</b> Yet in December 1945, the National Safety Council presented the Manhattan Project with the Award of Honor for Distinguished Service to Safety in recognition of its safety record.

500|$|In {{terms of}} regular nuclear testing, Kittens {{represents}} bomb component testing, while Tims and Rats were early subcritical hydronuclear tests. [...] Vixen is [...] "safety testing" [...] of a bomb; assuring {{that the core}} would not accidentally undergo criticality {{in the event of}} a fire or unintended crash. These are always messy (see the US equivalent at Plutonium Valley in Project 56), for a successful test subjects the core fuel to high explosives in the hope that it simply scatters rather than undergoes criticality. The differences in the sort of dangers presented by major vs the minor tests is that there was no critical explosion in the minor tests. [...] In the major tests, the bomb cores reached critical mass; the plutonium or uranium <b>fissile</b> <b>materials</b> [...] "burned" [...] into highly radioactive fission products, and those, along with the unspent fuel and activated bomb case, tower and soil if the explosion was close to the ground, are lofted into the stratosphere to be dropped eventually as fallout globally. In Vixen, an equivalent amount of plutonium fuel was simply smashed by explosives and spread about much more locally. [...] In Kittens, Tims and Rats, smaller amounts of various materials were similar exploded locally and spread about.|$|E
25|$|Breeder {{reactors}} {{are capable}} of producing more <b>fissile</b> <b>material</b> than they consume during the fission chain reaction (by converting fertile U-238 to Pu-239, or Th-232 to U-233).
