40|$|Negative {{symptoms}} are often enduring {{and lead to}} poor functional outcomes in individuals with schizophrenia. The cognitive model of negative symptoms proposes that low <b>expectancies</b> <b>of</b> success {{contribute to the development}} and maintenance of negative symptoms; however, longitudinal investigations assessing these beliefs and negative {{symptoms are}} needed. The current study examined whether an individual’s baseline <b>expectancies</b> <b>of</b> success – one’s beliefs about future success and goal attainment – predicted negative symptoms reduction over 18 months in individuals with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders (n= 118). Data were collected at baseline, 9 months, and 18 months as part of a randomized controlled trial of Illness Management and Recovery. A mixed effects regression analysis revealed a significant reduction in negative symptoms over time, with a significant interaction effect between time and baseline <b>expectancies</b> <b>of</b> success. After controlling for baseline negative symptoms, demographic variables, and treatment conditions, those with high and moderate baseline <b>expectancies</b> <b>of</b> success evidenced a significant reduction in negative symptoms at 18 months, while those with low baseline <b>expectancies</b> <b>of</b> success did not evidence reduced negative symptoms. Findings support the cognitive model of negative symptoms and suggest that <b>expectancies</b> <b>of</b> success may be a useful treatment target for interventions aimed at reducing negative symptoms...|$|R
40|$|Theoretical models <b>of</b> <b>expectancy</b> {{processes}} (e. g., Olson, Roese, & Zanna, 1996) have conceptualised {{the sources}} of information by which <b>expectancies</b> <b>of</b> others are formed, and suggest that expectancies {{have the potential to}} influence the cognitive, affective, and behavioural responses of both perceivers and targets. The main aim of this thesis was to examine expectancy effects within the coach-athlete relationship {{from the perspective of the}} athlete. Specifically, the aims were to examine: a) {{the sources of}} information that athletes deem influential when developing <b>expectancies</b> <b>of</b> a coach; b) the cognitive consequences <b>of</b> athletes' <b>expectancies</b> <b>of</b> coaches; c) the affective responses of athletes to initial <b>expectancies</b> <b>of</b> a coach; and d) the behavioural consequences <b>of</b> athletes' <b>expectancies</b> <b>of</b> their coach. In order to achieve these aims, the investigation employed a range of experimental methods including an explorative survey (study one); experimental designs, which involved obtaining athletes' ratings in response to a range of stimuli such as static photographs, written information, and dynamic video footage (studies two and three); and a field-based examination, which was assessed via a combination of notational analysis and questionnaire (study four). The main findings reveal that while static cues (e. g., gender) are deemed relatively unimportant during impression formation, dynamic cues (e. g., facial expressions) and third-party reports (e. g., reputation) are viewed by athletes as influential factors in the formation <b>of</b> <b>expectancies</b> about coaches. Specifically, the findings suggest that athletes' initial <b>expectancies</b> <b>of</b> an unknown coach's competency are influenced by the presentation of reputation information. Although the results show that coach gender also has a significant impact on athletes' <b>expectancies,</b> the effect <b>of</b> gender on athletes' expectancies was not as large as that of reputation information. In addition, reputation information is shown to significantly impact on athletes' positive affective responses to a coach. Finally, the results demonstrate that coach reputation impacts on athletes' attention, effort, and persistence during a training session. Overall, the research presented in this thesis provides support for the use of Olson et al. 's (1996) model <b>of</b> <b>expectancy</b> processes as a theoretical framework for the investigation <b>of</b> <b>expectancy</b> effects within the coach-athlete relationship. The thesis provides initial empirical support for the contention that athletes' <b>expectancies</b> <b>of</b> coaches impact on athletes' cognitive, affective, and behavioural responses. Such findings have important implications for coaching guidelines and the development of effective coach-athlete relationships. The proposal that third-party reports represent an influential source of information with regard to expectancy formation in sport has also received initial support.

40|$|According to the Sensitivity-to-mean-intentions (SeMI) model, dispositional victim {{sensitivity}} {{involves a}} suspicious mindset that is activated by situational cues and guides subsequent information processing and behavior like a schema. Study 1 tested whether victim-sensitive persons {{are more prone}} to form <b>expectancies</b> <b>of</b> injustice in ambiguous situations and whether these expectancies mediate the relationship between victim sensitivity and cooperation behavior in a trust game. Results show an indirect effect of victim sensitivity on cooperation after unfair treatment (vs control condition), mediated by <b>expectancies</b> <b>of</b> injustice. In Study 2 we directly manipulated the tendency to form <b>expectancies</b> <b>of</b> injustice in ambiguous situations to test for causality. Results confirmed that the readiness to expect unjust outcomes led to lower cooperation, compared to a control condition. These findings provide direct evidence that expectancy tendencies are implicated in elevated victim sensitivity and are of theoretical and practical relevance...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} the association between vulnerability to depression and smoking behavior in college students in 1214 college students (54 % female), and evaluated gender and <b>expectancies</b> <b>of</b> negative affect reduction as moderators or mediators of this relationship. Depression vulnerability predicted smoking in females, but not males. The relationship between depression vulnerability and smoking status was mediated by <b>expectancies</b> <b>of</b> negative affect reduction in females only. Female college students who are vulnerable to depression may smoke because they expect smoking to relieve negative affect. Smoking interventions for college females may increase in effectiveness by targeting depression and emphasizing mood regulation...|$|R

40|$|Background Musculoskeletal {{disorders}} including {{low back}} pain have major individual and socioeconomic consequences as it often leads to disability and long-term sick leave and exclusion from working life. Predictors of disability and return to work often differ, and the dominant knowledge is on predictors for prolonged sick leave and disability. Therefore {{it is also important}} to identify key predictors for return to work. The aim of the study was to assess if overall job satisfaction and <b>expectancies</b> <b>of</b> return to work predicts actual return to work after 12 months, among employees with long lasting {{low back pain}}, and to assess if there were gender differences in the predictors. Methods Data from the Cognitive interventions and nutritional supplements trial (CINS Trial) was used. Predictors for return to work were examined in 574 employees that had been on sick leave 2 – 10 months for low back pain, before entering the trial. Data were analysed with multiple logistic regression models stratified by gender, and adjusted for potential confounders. Results Regardless <b>of</b> gender high <b>expectancies</b> were a strong and significant predictor of return to work at 12 months, while high levels of job satisfaction were not a significant predictor. There were no differences in the levels <b>of</b> <b>expectancies</b> or overall job satisfaction between men and women. However, men had in general higher odds of returning to work compared with women. Conclusions Among individuals with long lasting low back pain high <b>expectancies</b> <b>of</b> returning to work were strongly associated with successful return to work. We do not know what factors influence individual <b>expectancies</b> <b>of</b> return to work. Screening expectancies and giving individuals with low expectancies interventions with a goal to change <b>expectancies</b> <b>of</b> return to work, such as CBT or self-management interventions, may contribute to increase actual return to work...|$|R
40|$|Despite the accumulating {{research}} on effects of alcohol advertising content on youths and the several {{studies that have}} explored media literacy intervention in different contexts, {{there is still a}} need to quantitatively model if media literacy significantly alters adolescents drinking expectancies and which component of media literacy significantly alters these drinking expectancies. To achieve this objective, the Solomon-four experimental research design was applied {{within the context of the}} theory of planned behaviour and the media literacy framework to examine the alcohol <b>expectancies</b> <b>of</b> media literate and illiterate adolescents. With a sample size of 860 adolescents in Lagos State, the paper hypothesized that there is no significant difference in the level of alteration caused by the various components of media literacy to the drinking <b>expectancies</b> <b>of</b> media literates and illiterates. The findings of the study revealed that there is a significant difference between media literacy treated and untreated adolescents; however, media literacy appears to exert a paradoxical effect on the drinking <b>expectancies</b> <b>of</b> adolescents. Based on this, the paper recommends that the operational media literacy framework as presented and used in Primark (2006) to be revisited and modified to avoid conflicting outcomes and that media literacy could be adopted as one of the ways to reduce alcohol drinking expectancy in youth...|$|R
