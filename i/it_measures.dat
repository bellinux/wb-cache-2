5|$|The {{planetary}} nebula NGC 5315 has a magnitude of 9.8 around a central star of magnitude 14.2, located 5.2degrees west-southwest of Alpha Circini. It is only visible as a disc at magnifications over 200-fold. Bernes 145 {{is a dark}} and reflection nebula first listed in the 1971 Bernes Catalog. The dark nebula component is easily visible in a large amateur telescope, and <b>it</b> <b>measures</b> 12by5arcminutes. The smaller reflection nebula component requires a larger instrument and averted vision to be seen.|$|E

5|$|The {{primary goal}} of AMiBA is to observe both the {{temperature}} and polarization anisotropies in the Cosmic Microwave Background at multipoles between 800 and 8,000 (corresponding to between 2 and 20 arcminutes on the sky), as well as observing the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect in clusters of galaxies, which has a maximum decrement around 100GHz. In its initial configuration, <b>it</b> <b>measures</b> up to multipoles of 3,000 with a resolution of around 6 arcminutes. The telescope only observes at night during good weather, using planets for calibration.|$|E
5|$|Although Exmoor {{witnessed}} {{the construction of}} a large number of monuments during the Bronze Age, only two stone circles survive in this area, the other being Porlock Stone Circle. The Withypool ring is located on the south-western slope of Withypool Hill, on an area of heathland. In diameter <b>it</b> <b>measures</b> 36.4 metres (119 feet, 6 inches) across. Around thirty small gritstones remain as part of the circle, which may originally have held around one hundred; there are conspicuous gaps on the northern and western ends of the monument. The site was rediscovered in 1898 and subsequently surveyed by the archaeologist Harold St George Gray in 1905.|$|E
5|$|Spores {{are roughly}} {{ellipsoidal}} in shape with a Q ratio (the fraction of length/width) of 1.6, and dimensions of 9.4–15.4 by 6.2–9.0μm. They have a small, oblique , lack oil droplets, and are smooth with thin walls, and hyaline (translucent). The spores are acyanophilous and strongly amyloid, meaning they stain with Methyl blue and Melzer's reagent, respectively. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored (rarely two-spored) and club-shaped with long, robust sterigmata up to 6.0μm long; they have clamp connections at their bases, and measure 35.3–49.6 by 10.3–14.4μm. Roridomyces austrororidus has {{two types of}} cheilocystidia (cystidia on gill edges). One is rare, broadly club-shaped, and tapers to a narrow stem; <b>it</b> <b>measures</b> 24.1–39.5 by 6.8–12.7μm. The other cheilocystidia are moderately dense to abundant, and form a sterile gill edge. They are cylindrical, measuring 27.5–70.4 by 5.4–10.4μm, and often have a swollen tip that splits into two, rarely three branches.|$|E

The east wall and window, with stone tracery and an ogee-topped light in a pointed arch, are from the 14th century. Some of the windows use atypical green glass, and some have frames made out of wood.|$|E

Entrance to the church is through a porch with a rounded arch at the west end of the south wall, and there is a vestry, with one window, at the west end of the north wall.|$|E
5|$|The tansy beetle (Chrysolina graminis) is {{a species}} of leaf beetle. <b>It</b> <b>measures</b> 7.7–10.5mm in length and has a {{characteristic}} bright metallic green colouration. The common name derives from the tansy plant on which they often feed as both larvae and adults. In addition to the nominotypical subspecies, which repeats the specific name, C. graminis graminis, there are five further distinct subspecies of tansy beetle, which, collectively, have a Palearctic distribution, although {{in the majority of}} countries where it is found the species is declining. In the United Kingdom it is designated as 'Nationally Rare' and this localised population, centred on York, North Yorkshire, {{has been the subject of}} much recent research.|$|E
