5|$|Twentieth-century feminist critics {{embraced the}} work, {{integrating}} it <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>history</b> {{of the novel}} and feminist discourse.

5|$|In 2004, the 1963 statute {{came under}} {{criticism}} because it states {{the sun in}} the state seal is setting rather than rising. A thorough investigation by the Indiana Historical Bureau <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>history</b> of the seal led to the discovery that original seal was created with the intention that the sun should, in fact, be depicted as rising. In both 2004 and 2005 legislation was introduced to change {{the wording of the}} statute, but as of 2008 no action had been taken to correct the error.|$|E
5|$|On 23 January 1967 {{when the}} formal new town {{designation}} order was made, the , {{area to be}} developed was largely farmland and undeveloped villages.

5|$|On January 28, 1905, {{an article}} {{ran in the}} Indianapolis News {{containing}} information {{on the origin of}} the seal, some of it dubious. The article received much attention and started an informal inquiry <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>history</b> of the seal, and namely to discover if the sun in the seal was rising or setting. Jacob Piatt Dunn, the preeminent Indiana historian of the time, consulted several history and arrived at the conclusion that the sun was rising. Dunn cited the fact the state was young, and the mountains were to the east of the state, not the west—clearly indicating the sun was rising.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{signs of}} human activity in Leigh are evidenced by a Neolithic stone axe found in Pennington and a bronze spearhead from south of Gas Street. A single Roman coin was found at Butts in Bedford. After the Roman departure from Britain, and <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>history</b> of Anglo-Saxon England, nothing was written about Leigh. However evidence {{for the presence of}} Saxons in what was a sparsely populated and isolated part of the country is provided by local township place names that incorporate the Old English suffix leah, such as Leigh, Tyldesley, Shakerley and Astley.|$|E
5|$|The third Marquess of Bute, again called John, {{inherited}} {{the title and}} castle in 1848. He was then {{less than a year}} old, and as he grew up he came to despise the existing castle, believing that it represented a mediocre, half-hearted example of the Gothic style. Bute engaged the architect William Burges, to undertake the remodelling of the castle. The two shared a passion in medieval Gothic Revivalism and this, combined with Bute's huge financial resources, enabled Burges to rebuild the property on a grand scale. Burges brought with him almost of all of the team that had supported him on earlier projects, including John Starling Chapple, William Frame and Horatio Lonsdale. Burges's contribution, in particular his research <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>history</b> of the castle and his architectural imagination, was critical to the transformation.|$|E
