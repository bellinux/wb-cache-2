Capillary gas chromatography–mass spectrometry was used for quantification purposes. The chemically protective glove did not allow any permeation up to 8 h for the solid-formulation and water-collection challenges, but permeation was detected in all other challenges. The <b>disposable</b> <b>glove</b> allowed the most permeation, and the solidformulation challenge with water collection necessitated that a dichlobenil equivalent be calculated because of the presence of its hydrolysis degradation product 2, 6 -dichlorobenzamide.

40|$|Introduction & aim Skin care is {{essential}} to the wellbeing of elderly and constitutes one of the cornerstones of nursing practice. Traditional washing with water and soap is still standard of care, but increasingly replaced by <b>disposable</b> wash <b>gloves</b> with cleansing lotion. Currently, there is few evidence on the effect of <b>disposable</b> wash <b>gloves</b> on skin hydration. Therefore, the objective {{of this study was to}} compare the effect of 2 washing methods on skin hydration in nursing home residents. Method Residents from 2 nursing homes were divided into 2 groups: 40 residents received the traditional washing method, while <b>disposable</b> wash <b>gloves</b> were provided to 105 residents. Skin hydration was measured using a MoistureMeter SC at 3 skin sites (cheek, hand and lower leg) and two time points (before and after 12 weeks of implementation). Residents characteristics, bath practices as well as environmental influences were recorded. Results The mean age was 85. 5 years. No differences were observed in personal characteristics between both groups. Significantly more residents in the control group had a weekly bath and used liquid soap. The mean room temperature was significantly higher in the control group, while humidity was lower. Total skin hydration did not differ between residents at the start of the study in both groups (p= 0, 213). After implementation, hydration in the intervention group was significantly higher at all skin sites and total skin (p< 0, 001). In both groups the percentage of residents with dry skin at the legs decreased, but a higher decrease was observed in the control group (14 % versus 9 % in the intervention group).

40|$|INTRODUCTION: NCHDs {{are exposed}} to {{a great number of}} {{blood-borne}} infections. Needle stick injuries are possibly the main route of acquiring such infections from a non-consultant hospital doctors (NCHDs) perspective. This study examines NCHDs experiences surrounding needle stick injuries. METHODS: A cross-sectional self-administered anonymous questionnaire survey was conducted on 185 NCHDs working in a clinical setting among seven teaching hospitals in Ireland. Implied consent was obtained. The data was analysed using Excel spreadsheets. Ethical approval was received. RESULTS: A response rate of 85. 4 % (158 / 185) was achieved. Findings of the study are shown in the manuscript table. CONCLUSIONS: A needle stick injury (NI) history is greater among surgical NCHDs than medical NCHDs.

40|$|Background Dry skin or xerosis is {{a common}} problem in elderly, {{therefore}} skin care {{is essential to the}} wellbeing of nursing home residents. Traditional washing with water and soap is still standard of care, but increasingly replaced by <b>disposable</b> wash <b>gloves</b> with cleansing lotion. However, {{there is a lack of}} evidence on the effect of <b>disposable</b> wash <b>gloves</b> on skin hydration. Aims and objectives The objective of this study was to compare the effect of two washing methods (traditional versus disposable bed bath) on skin hydration at stratum cornea level in nursing home residents. Method We’ve conducted an interventional study in which 145 residents from two nursing homes were divided into two groups: 40 residents received the traditional washing method (control group), while <b>disposable</b> wash <b>gloves</b> were provided to 105 residents (intervention group). Skin hydration was measured using a MoistureMeter SC at three skin sites (cheek, hand and lower leg) and two time points (before and after 12 weeks of implementation). Residents characteristics, bath practices as well as environmental influences were recorded. The study was approved by the Ethical Committee of AZ Sint-Niklaas hospital (Belgium, EC 14045). After an information session, residents or their legal representatives provided written informed consent. Results The mean age of the residents was 85. 5 years. No differences were observed in personal characteristics between both groups. Significantly more residents in the control group had a weekly bath and used liquid soap. The mean room temperature was significantly higher in the control group, while humidity was lower. Total skin hydration did not differ between residents at the start of the study in both groups (p= 0, 213). After implementation, hydration in the intervention group was significantly higher at all skin sites and total skin (p< 0, 001).

40|$|Background: no-rinse <b>disposable</b> wash <b>gloves</b> are {{increasingly}} implemented {{in health care}} to replace traditional soap and water bed baths without proper evaluation of (cost) effectiveness. Objectives: to compare bed baths for effects on skin integrity and resistance against bathing and costs. Design: cluster randomized trial. Setting: fifty six nursing home wards in the Netherlands. Participants: five hundred adult care-dependent residents and 275 nurses from nursing home wards. Methods: the experimental condition ‘washing without water’ consists of a bed bath with <b>disposable</b> wash <b>gloves</b> made of non-woven waffled fibers, saturated with a no-rinse, quickly vaporizing skin cleaning and caring lotion. The control condition is a traditional bed bath using soap, water, washcloths and towels. Both conditions were continued for 6 weeks. Outcome measures were prevalence of skin damage distinguished in two levels of severity: any skin abnormality/lesion and significant skin lesions. Additional outcomes: resistance during bed baths, costs. Results: any skin abnormalities/lesions over time decreased slightly {{in the experimental group}}, and increased slightly in the control group, resulting in 72. 7 % vs 77. 6 % of residents having any skin abnormalities/lesions after 6 weeks, respectively (p = 0. 04). There were no differences in significant skin lesions or resistance after 6 weeks. Mean costs for bed baths during 6 weeks per resident were estimated at € 218. 30 (95 %CI 150. 52 – 286. 08) in the experimental group and € 232. 20 (95 %CI: 203. 80 – 260. 60) in the control group (difference € 13. 90 (95 %CI: ? 25. 61 – 53. 42).
