40|$|Hypothesis: Modest, {{preoperative}} {{weight loss}} will improve perioperative outcomes among high-risk, morbidly obese patients undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Design A prospective, longitudinal assessment of characteristics and outcomes of gastric bypass patients. Setting All patients undergoing open or laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery for morbid obesity or its comorbid medical problems at Geisinger Medical Center in Danville, Pennsylvania, during a 3 -year period from May 31, 2002, to February 24, 2006, {{were included in}} this analysis.

Results: Of the 884 subjects, 425 (48 %) lost more than 10 % of their <b>excess</b> body <b>weight</b> prior to the operation.

40|$|Objectives: To {{describe}} {{food consumption}} frequency in {{adolescents in the}} context of the financial crisis in 2012, and to analyse potential fluctuations in <b>excess</b> body <b>weight</b> between 2008 and 2012. Method: A cross-sectional study of eating habits and <b>excess</b> body <b>weight</b> was conducted in adolescents aged 13 to 19 years old from public, subsidised and private secondary schools in Barcelona, Spain. The FRESC lifestyle risk factors survey was used, and food frequency consumption, food recommendations and body mass index were analysed according to gender, year of education and socioeconomic status. Results: Girls ate vegetables and fruits more frequently than boys, while the prevalence of junk food consumption was higher in boys. The prevalence of compliance with food recommendations was lower than 50 % for all foods, and gender and socioeconomic differences were found for eggs, red meat and soft drinks. Regarding <b>excess</b> body <b>weight,</b> boys had a higher prevalence than girls in the 2 years analysed. Furthermore, a reduction in <b>excess</b> body <b>weight</b> was observed among girls in secondary education in the highest socioeconomic groups (28. 7 % [95 % CI: 24. 8 - 32. 6 %] in 2008 to 20. 5 % [95 % CI: 17. 1 - 23. 8 %] in 2012).

MÉTODOS: As informações foram coletadas por meio de questionário desenvolvido e validado para adolescentes. Foram considerados insuficientemente ativos, os jovens que não acumulavam pelo menos 300 minutos/semana de atividades físicas moderadas ou vigorosas. Considerou-se para o uso excessivo de TV e computador/games um tempo > 2 horas/dia; para excesso de peso corporal, utilizou-se a tabela internacional de IMC para adolescentes. RESULTADOS: O excesso de peso corporal foi mais prevalente entre os rapazes (12, 7 % vs 7, 9 %, p OBJECTIVE: The {{objective of}} this study was to analyze the associations of body mass index (BMI) with physical activity, sedentary behaviors (TV, computer/videogames) in a representative sample (n= 5, 028) of adolescents (15 - 19 years) in the State of Santa Catarina, Brazil. METHODS: Data was collected using a validated health behavior questionnaire developed for adolescents. <b>Excess</b> body <b>weight</b> was determined according to the international BMI tables developed for adolescents. Students were classified as not being physically active if they reported having less than 300 minutes of moderate/vigorous physical activity (MVPA) per week. Two or more hours a day was considered excess screen time (TV, computer, games). RESULTS: <b>Excess</b> body <b>weight</b> was more prevalent (p< 0. 001) among boys (12. 7 %) than girls (7. 9 %), but inadequate physical activity was more prevalent (p< 0. 001) among girls (37 %) than boys (21 %). Less active boys had a greater chance (74 %) of having <b>excess</b> body <b>weight</b> when compared to active ones.

A sample of 1655 adults (18 - 64 years) from the ANIBES ("Anthropometric data, macronutrients and micronutrients intake, practice of physical activity, socioeconomic data and lifestyles") cross-sectional study was analysed. Fibre intake and dietary food sources were determined by using a three-day dietary record. Misreporters were identified using the protocol of the European Food Safety Authority. Mean (standard deviation) fibre intake was 12. 59 (5. 66) g/day in the whole sample and 15. 88 (6. 29) g/day in the plausible reporters.

40|$|<b>Weight</b> <b>excess</b> and/or {{central body}} fat {{distribution}} {{are associated with}} increased long-term renal risk, not only in subjects with renal disease or renal transplant recipients, {{but also in the}} general population. As the prevalence of <b>weight</b> <b>excess</b> is rising worldwide, this may become a main renal risk factor on a population basis, even more so because the risk extends to the overweight range. Understanding the mechanisms of this detrimental effect of <b>weight</b> <b>excess</b> on the kidneys is needed in order to design preventive treatment strategies. The increased risk associated with <b>weight</b> <b>excess</b> is partly attributed to associated comorbid conditions, such as hypertension, dyslipidaemia, insulin resistance and diabetes; however, current evidence supports a direct pathogenetic role for renal haemodynamics as well. <b>Weight</b> <b>excess</b> is associated with an altered renal haemodynamic profile, i. e. an increased glomerular filtration rate relative to effective renal plasma flow, resulting in an increased filtration fraction (FF). This renal haemodynamic profile is considered to reflect glomerular hyperfiltration and glomerular hypertension, resulting from a dysbalance between afferent and efferent arterial vasomotor balance. This unfavorable renal haemodynamic profile was found to be associated with renal outcome in experimental models and in human renal transplant recipients, and is associated with a blunted sodium excretion, and reversible by weight loss, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockade or by dietary sodium restriction.
