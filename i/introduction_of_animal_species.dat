40|$|The <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> <b>species,</b> transfaunation {{and habitat}} {{destruction}} {{are among the}} greatest threats for biodiversity. In fact, in the water systems of Latium the occurrence of allochthonous crayfishes Procambarus clarkii, Orconectes limosus and Astacus leptodactylus has been observed. The distribution of these species in Latium highlighted some differences between them: Orconectes limosus and Astacus leptodactylus are present in restricted areas, while Procambarus clarkii has a wide distribution throughout the region. The present study confirmed their ecological plasticity, strong capability of invasion and adaptation to new environments of all three species, due to their rapid growth, utilisation of different trophic resources and the frequency and length of their reproduction periods. These aspects can cause irreversible ecologic and economic damage. The eradication of Procambarus clarkii would be a difficult task, because of its wide distribution and the many records of the species, especially in the Province of Latina, where complex field irrigation systems are found. All the agencies for environmental protection should increase control activities, with a serious field effort. As regards the other two species, eradication would be easier due to their limited distribution. It is important to avoid the spreading of these species; {{this can be done}} through public opinion awareness-raising campaigns and a continuous control on the region, increasing research and supporting it with new laws concerning the introduction and treatment of alien species...|$|E

30|$|Despite the {{influence}} of shipping and canals, the most important pathways for the <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> non-native freshwater <b>animal</b> <b>species</b> to Europe have been stocking (30 % of species) and aquaculture (27 %) [37]. Stocking has been largely of fish to create new wild populations, while aquaculture introductions have arisen from the unintended escape of farmed species and their associated organisms (e.g. parasites). Aquaculture has also been important for <b>introductions</b> <b>of</b> marine species to the Atlantic coast, Baltic Sea, and Mediterranean, accounting for 24 %, 18 %, and 11 % of established species, respectively [36].|$|R

Through their impacts on natural ecosystems, agricultural lands, and water delivery systems, invasive species may also negatively affect human health and possibly even the economy...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT- The <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> {{non-native}} <b>animal</b> <b>species</b> is {{an important}} cause of loss of biodiversity. Tree squirrels as a taxon and grey squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis) in particular {{are among the most}} successful invasive alien species. Here we present the current situation (October 2010) of the grey squirrel in Italy. The grey squirrel was first reported in Piedmont in 1948. Subsequent major introductions were reported in Genova-Nervi (1966) and the Ticino Valley Regional Park in Lombardy (1999). In 2010, there were 24 areas with a (meta) population or nucleus of grey squirrels: 23 of these were in the three regions most affected by the invasive species Piedmont, Lombardy and Liguria. The number of known areas with grey squirrel presence has strongly increased in the last years. With the exception of the Genova-Nervi population, {{there is a lack of}} detailed knowledge on grey squirrel distribution and population size in areas where animals are now known or believed to be present. We underline the need for the immediate ban of squirrel trade and control or eradication actions...|$|R
40|$|The {{alteration}} of a habitat {{such as that}} caused by the <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> exotic <b>animal</b> <b>species</b> that displace the native ones, reducing their populations or leading them to extinction, can result in the disruption of species interactions which may have evolved during millions of years. The insular ecosystems are especially vulnerable to such disturbances, as they are usually less complex and have a lower number of species than the continental ones. In the present work I document {{the consequences of the}} disruption of plant-disperser interactions, caused by the <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> carnivorous mammals in the Balearic Islands, for the populations of two shrub species: Cneorum tricoccon L., with a distribution restricted to the western Mediterranean, and Daphne rodriguezii Texidor, endemic from Menorca island. Whereas carnivores have >replaced> the native dispersers (lizards) of the former, notably modifying its distribution -especially in Mallorca-, the plant-lizard mutualism disruption seems to have been dramatic for the second species, drastically reducing its populations except in an islet where lizards still persist.

40|$|The <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> {{non-native}} <b>animal</b> <b>species</b> is {{an important}} cause of loss of biodiversity, for this reason their population control has {{received a lot of}} attention in the scientific literature. While the number of introduced species of many taxa is constantly growing, the eradication of new populations (&ldquo;a posteriori&rdquo; action) and the regulation of the trade <b>of</b> live <b>animals</b> and plants (&ldquo;a priori&rdquo; strategies) is proceeding slowly. Tree squirrels as a taxon and grey squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis) in particular are among the most successful invasive alien species. Here we present the current situation (October 2010) of the grey squirrel in Italy. The grey squirrel was first reported in Piedmont in an area around the Stupinigi forests in 1948. Subsequent major introductions were reported in Genova-Nervi (1966) and the Ticino Valley Regional Park in Lombardy (1999). In 2010, there were 24 areas with a (meta) population or nucleus of grey squirrels: 23 of these were in the three regions most affected by the invasive species Piedmont, Lombardy and Liguria.

With the exception of the Genova-Nervi population, {{there is a lack of}} detailed knowledge on grey squirrel distribution and population size in areas where animals are now known or believed to be present. We underline the necessity to introduce immediately a ban on grey squirrel trade and, preferably, to all invasive species of the Sciuridae family, and to start immediate control or eradication actions...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn the {{tropical}} oceanic {{islands of the}} Pacific, vegetation patterns and dynamics {{are the result of}} plant dispersal capacities, the physical characteristics of the islands’ ecosystems, and natural disturbances. However, humans have profoundly modified native landscapes through habitat destruction and the <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> and plant <b>species.</b> The candlenut tree Aleurites moluccana (Euphorbiaceae) and the Polynesian bamboo Schizostachyum glaucifolium (Poaceae), intentionally introduced as useful plants by the first Polynesian migrants at least 1, 000 years ago, are now widely naturalized in the high volcanic islands of the Society archipelago (French Polynesia), but with an intriguing patchy distribution. The present study consists of a comparative analysis between the most recent, existing vegetation map and the known archeological sites on the island of Tahiti. Thirty-nine bamboo groves and 30 candlenut forests were identified and located using GIS and a Digital Elevation Model. The results show that the dispersal and distribution patterns of these two plant taxa are related to the presence and location of ancient sites of Polynesian occupation. The bamboo groves {{can be used as a}} bio-indicator of the presence of potential archeological sites. Their currently restricted distribution might reflect habitat requirements and poor dispersal capacities. The candlenut tree and the Polynesian bamboo are relicts of ancient Polynesian society that have persisted and remain integrated in the modern landscape. They can therefore be viewed as introduced species of high cultural heritage value...|$|R
40|$|In the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador, {{one of the}} {{greatest}} threats to the terrestrial ecosystem is the increasing number and areal extent of invasive species. Increased human presence on the islands has hastened the <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> plant and <b>animal</b> <b>species</b> that threaten the native and endemic flora and fauna. Considerable research on invasive species in the Galapagos Islands has been conducted by the Charles Darwin Foundation. We complement that work through a spatially- and spectrally-explicit satellite assessment of an important invasive plant species (Psidium guajava — guava) on Isabela Island that integrates diverse remote sensing systems, data types, spatial and spectral resolutions, and analytical and image processing approaches. QuickBird and Hyperion satellite data are processed to characterize the areal extent and spatial structure of guava through the following approaches: (1) QuickBird data are classified through a traditional pixel-based approach (i. e., an unsupervised classification approach using the ISODATA algorithm), as well as an Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) approach; (2) multiple approaches for spectral “unmixing” of the Hyperion hyper-spectral data are assessed to construct spectral end-members from QuickBird data using linear and non-linear mixture modeling approaches; and (3) landscape pattern metrics are calculated and compared for the pixel-based, object-based, and spectral unmixing approaches. The spectral–spatial characteristics of guava are interpreted relative to management strategies for the control of guava and the restoration of natural ecosystems in the Galapagos National Park...|$|R

40|$|Chile {{is located}} in the {{south-west}} corner of South America, with climates that vary from hot and dry in the north to mild cold in the south. This large range of climates enables Chile to produce a variety <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> and plant products. The Chilean economy is strongly based on the exports of agricultural products. Even though the economy was negatively affected by the Asian economic crisis in 1997 / 98, the economic sector is through a recovery process. Diversification is one important factor in the recovery process of the economy. The Chilean economy needs to diversify (products and markets), to spread the risk involved in the trade sector. Agriculture {{is one of the most}} important sectors in the Chilean economy. This sector is composed of fruit, crops, and livestock production. Within the latter sector, the main activities are beef cattle and dairy production. In the last few years, diversification of the current productive systems in Chile has been through the <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> new <b>animal</b> <b>species,</b> such as ostriches and deer. These activities are considered to be very new, and consequently are unknown to a vast number of people In addition to this, and in particular with regards to the deer industry in Chile, structure is almost non-existent, and its marketing channels and quality controls are unorganised. Deer farming is an opportunity to diversify the agricultural sector in Chile. As a new activity it must be developed either by domestic private or public institutions and/or by foreign investors. As any other business, this industry works within certain conditions, determined by the country's economy and situation of its sector, in this case agriculture. Deer have a highly efficient conversion rate from grass to protein when compared to other farmed animals. Deer products are commonly in demand in European and Asian countries. The farmed deer industry is a world-wide business, with New Zealand as the leader. In 1999 the New Zealand deer industry exported venison, velvet antler and co-products with a value of about NZ$ 210 million. For the year 2002 is forecasted that New Zealand deer exports will reach about NZ$ 270 million. The main markets for New Zealand deer products are Europe, USA and Asian countries. The deer industry in Chile is in an embryonic stage, and is a growing activity. However, it still needs further development in areas such as processes, transport, management practices, etc. This industry does not present a fixed structure, and deer products have to be marketed through traditional beef marketing channels. Regulations are almost non-existent, with the exception of minimal import, farming and slaughter regulations. Total farm gross margins results for deer farms in Chile suggest that deer farming in Chile is profitable (US$ 20, 982 for Farm A and US$ 10, 578 for Farm B). However, compared to New Zealand, the gross margins from Chilean farms are low. On a total farm and per hectare gross margin basis, New Zealand has higher gross margins compared to Chilean farms. However, on a stock units basis, Chilean farms have higher gross margins. This may be due to the fact that Chilean farms have a lower stocking rate than New Zealand. Even though gross margin results suggest that Chilean deer farms are profitable, this activity shows important issues that need to be addressed. These issues are related to infrastructure and regulations for deer production, and marketing and promotion of deer products. Probable reasons for New Zealand's higher profitability in the deer industry compared to Chilean deer farms are management practices and know-how of deer farming. The threat of new entrants in the Chilean deer industry is weak. The bargaining power of suppliers and buyers also is weak, because production and demand in the domestic market are very low. Rivalry within the industry is between deer farms and hunting operations, and is related to quality issues. In Chile, substitute products for deer products are mainly other protein sources for venison, and other herbal tonics for velvet. Strengths of the Chilean deer industry are represented by geographical and physical factors, and include the fact there are no presence of natural deer predators in Chile. The main weaknesses are related to the size of Chilean deer farms, low production levels and lack of a complete legislation. Land availability, increasing meat and healthier product consumption trends in Chile, are the main opportunities for the Chilean deer industry. The main threat to the industry in Chile is the variability of venison quality and lack of quality controls in the marketing process...|$|R
50|$|The advent <b>of</b> {{farming and}} <b>animal</b> {{husbandry}} <b>of</b> the Neolithic Revolution increased {{the scope of}} conflict between humans and animals. The crops and the produce formed an abundant and easily obtained food source for wild animals. Wild herbivores competed with domesticated ones for pasture. In addition, they were a source for diseases which affected livestock. The livestock attracted predators which found them an easy source to prey on. The inevitable human reaction was to eliminate such threats to agriculture and domesticated animals. In addition, land was converted to agricultural and other uses and forests cleared, all of which impacted wild animals adversely. A number <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> <b>species</b> were eliminated locally or from parts of their natural range.
