5|$|The {{head was}} {{conclusively}} seen on Westminster Hall {{as late as}} 1684, {{and it was on}} the south side of the Hall. Archaeological evidence also disproved its authenticity. The skull was pierced from the top, not from the bottom; and the skull had no trace of skin or hair, showing <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> embalmed.|$|E
5|$|In this context, Tătărescu {{chose to}} back the regime, as the PNL, like the National Peasants' Party, {{remained}} active in nominal clandestinity (as the law banning <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> enforced any further). Having personally signed the document banning opposition parties, he was expelled from the PNL in April 1938, and contested {{the legitimacy of the}} action for the following years. Allegedly, his ousting was recommended by Iuliu Maniu, leader of the National Peasants' Party's and, for the following years, the closest of Dinu Brătianu's political allies.|$|E
5|$|During {{a tour of}} the Philippines {{the month}} after the Yesterday and Today furore, the Beatles unintentionally snubbed the nation's first lady, Imelda Marcos, who had {{expected}} them to attend a breakfast reception at the Presidential Palace. When presented with the invitation, Epstein politely declined on the band members' behalf, as <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> his policy to accept such official invitations. They soon found that the Marcos regime was unaccustomed to taking no for an answer. The resulting riots endangered the group and they escaped the country with difficulty. Immediately afterwards, the band members visited India for the first time.|$|E

5|$|These moves {{were met}} with some criticism, as the {{preserved}} counties were created to sustain a stable and continuing layout, irrespective of interim local government reviews affecting principal areas. This led to some areas, such as the Aberconwy district, moving to a preserved county <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> administered by in the past, and therefore these moves went generally unreported due to the preserved county's limited status. The Boundary Commission proceeded to retain the eight preserved counties, and modified their borders in 2003 to match with the incumbent principal area boundaries. The 2003 arrangement brings towns such as Llandudno, Conwy and Betws-y-Coed into the preserved county of Clwyd.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, Savenko {{stated that}} the passed law on the state expert {{activity}} {{and the introduction of}} the profession of forensic expert psychiatrist actually destroyed adversary-based examinations and that the Serbsky Center turned into the complete monopolist of forensic examination, which <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> under Soviet rule. Formerly, the court could include any psychiatrist in a commission of experts, but now the court only chooses an expert institution. The expert has the right to participate only in commissions that he is included in by the head of his expert institution, and can receive the certificate of qualification as an expert only after having worked in a state expert institution for three years. The Director of the Serbsky Center Dmitrieva was, at the same time, the head of the forensic psychiatry department which is {{the only one in the}} country and is located in her Center. No one had ever had such a monopoly.|$|E
5|$|On June 22 the FIA {{produced}} {{a press release}} from Max Mosley, {{in the form of}} a question-and-answer session, in an effort to clarify the FIA's stand on the controversy. In it Mosley drew an analogy to a hypothetical situation where the engines from one manufacturer had oil starvation problems due to high lateral loading in one corner, and pointed out that those cars would simply have been forced to run slower as a result. He reiterated that the reason for not installing the chicane was purely that <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> tested and was thereby deemed unsafe. He pointed out that the alternatives that the FIA suggested were feasible, and wondered why the teams did not use the pitlane as an alternative, especially when, with only six Bridgestone cars, the Michelin teams could still compete for the points scoring seventh and eighth places.|$|E

25|$|The Australian Government {{had sought}} US {{military}} assistance in 1942, {{when it was}} faced {{with the possibility of}} Japanese invasion. While Australia had made a significant contribution to the Pacific War, <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> an equal partner with its US counterparts in strategy. It was argued that a British presence would act as a counterbalance to the powerful and increasing US presence in the Pacific.|$|E
25|$|Safety {{has also}} been a long-standing {{priority}} among classified employees, but <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> the large-scale concern that it became during the 1980s asbestos scare. Asbestos, a flaky white mineral, had been widely used in school construction between 1945 and 1973 on ceilings and as an insulator for pipes and boilers. Then in 1982, the Environmental Protection Agency ordered schools to be inspected for this cancer-causing substance.|$|E

While Svartholm did not really see any action in the Russo-Swedish War of 1788–1790 it did act as important staging ground and rallying point during several stages of the war.|$|E

25|$|One of Theodore Roosevelt's {{most popular}} books, Through the Brazilian Wilderness, recounted the father-and-son {{expedition}} into the Amazon Basin Brazilian jungle in 1913–14. Father and son went {{on what would}} {{become known as the}} Roosevelt-Rondon Scientific Expedition, exploring the Brazilian jungle with explorer Colonel Cândido Rondon. During this expedition, they explored the River of Doubt, later renamed Rio Roosevelt in honor of the President, as well as a branch of that river named the Rio Kermit in his honor. The source of the river had been discovered by Rondon earlier, but <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> fully explored or mapped.|$|E
25|$|By 1938, {{the only}} use the Germans {{had for the}} {{agreement}} was to threaten to renounce {{it as a way}} of pressuring London to accept Continental Europe as Germany's rightful sphere of influence. At a meeting on 16 April 1938 between Sir Nevile Henderson, the British Ambassador to Germany, and Hermann Göring, the latter stated <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> valued in England, and he bitterly regretted that Herr Hitler had ever consented to it at the time without getting anything in exchange. It had been a mistake, but Germany was nevertheless not going to remain in a state of inferiority in this respect vis-à-vis a hostile Britain, and would build up to a 100 per cent. basis.|$|E

25|$|The {{prohibition}} of absinthe in France would {{eventually lead to}} the popularity of pastis, {{and to a lesser}} extent, ouzo, and other anise-flavoured spirits that do not contain wormwood. Following the conclusion of the First World War, production of the Pernod Fils brand was resumed at the Banus distillery in Catalonia, Spain (where absinthe was still legal), but gradually declining sales saw the cessation of production in the 1960s. In Switzerland, the ban served only to drive the production of absinthe underground. Clandestine home distillers produced colourless absinthe (la Bleue), which was easier to conceal from the authorities. Many countries never banned absinthe, notably Britain, where <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> as popular as in continental Europe.|$|E
25|$|The US Forest Service first {{purchased}} land in {{this area}} in 1913 for Shenandoah National Forest, the precursor {{to the present day}} George Washington National Forest. The Forest Service has managed the Ramsey’s Draft area essentially as a wilderness since 1935 as much of <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> logged. A road more than three miles (5km) upstream from U.S. 250 constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s lasted until 1969, when rainwater from Hurricane Camille wiped out much of the road at the stream crossings. Another flood in November 1985 further eliminated the original road and changed the course of the stream in multiple areas, shortly after the area was officially designated a wilderness under the Virginia Wilderness Act of 1984.|$|E
25|$|Partridge was {{instrumental}} in the apprehension of the gang of murderers and body snatchers called the London Burkers, after the Edinburgh murderers Burke and Hare of three years earlier. On 5 November 1831, shortly after he had taken up the position of demonstrator of anatomy at King's College, the four members of the gang attempted to sell him the body of the so-called 'Italian Boy' for nine guineas. Both Partridge and the dissecting-room porter, William Hill, were suspicious of the fresh state of the body, which looked as if <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> buried, as well as of a cut on its forehead. Partridge is said to have delayed the gang members with the ruse of claiming to lack change for a fifty-pound note, whilst raising the alarm with his superior, Herbert Mayo. All four members of the London Burker gang were arrested while still awaiting payment.|$|E

25|$|The Provisional IRA {{claimed that}} they had put the bomb on the {{aircraft}} but that <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> intended to detonate but {{to show that they}} could get through the security at Belfast Airport. The way in which the bomb gained access to the aircraft remains unknown. Three police officers from the Royal Ulster Constabulary were on board the flight. The Chief Constable of Northern Ireland, James Flanagan together {{with his wife and two}} police officers with their families were travelling to London to attend an investiture; the two officers were to receive the British Empire Medal from Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace for their work during the Northern Ireland Troubles. The MP James Molyneaux, Chief Whip for the Ulster Unionist Party and a senior member of the Orange Order was also on the flight. Bob Rae, who would later become Premier of the Canadian province of Ontario and leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, was also a passenger.|$|E
25|$|According to anti-Castro militant Carlos Bringuier, Oswald {{visited him}} on August 5 and 6 {{at a store}} he owned in New Orleans. Bringuier was the New Orleans {{delegate}} for the anti-Castro organization Directorio Revolucionario Estudantil (DRE). Bringuier would later tell the Warren Commission that he believed Oswald's visits were an attempt by Oswald to infiltrate his group. On August 9, Oswald turned up in downtown New Orleans handing out pro-Castro leaflets. Bringuier confronted Oswald, claiming he was tipped off about Oswald's leafleting by a friend. A scuffle ensued and Oswald, Bringuier, and two of Bringuier's friends were arrested for disturbing the peace. Prior to leaving the police station, Oswald requested to speak with an FBI agent. Oswald stated {{that he was a}} member of the New Orleans branch of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee which he claimed had 35 members and was led by A. J. Hidell. In fact, Oswald was the branch's only member and <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> chartered by the national organization.|$|E
25|$|Although {{never tried}} {{for the murders}} of Fleszar, Schell, Skelton, Basom, Kalom or Phillips, {{physical}} and circumstantial evidence exists in each case indicating that Collins had indeed committed these murders. For example, {{in the case of}} Mary Fleszar, investigators discovered {{that at the time of}} her disappearance, Collins had worked part-time in the Eastern Michigan University administration unit, and that his office had been located directly opposite the hallway from the office where Fleszar had herself worked. One of the personal items missing from Fleszar's body was an Expo 67 Canadian silver dollar she is known to have worn around her neck; this item was discovered in Collins' dresser when police conducted a search of his room. When confronted with this finding, Collins reportedly denied any knowledge of the existence of this item and insisted <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> in his room; he had apparently neglected to dispose of this item as he had the personal possessions of other victims two days prior to his arrest.|$|E
