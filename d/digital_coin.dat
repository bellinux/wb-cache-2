40|$|Abstract. A fair {{exchange}} of payments for {{goods and services}} is a barter where one of the parties cannot obtain the item desired without handing over the item he offered. We introduce the concept of ripping <b>digital</b> <b>coins</b> to solve fairness problems in payment transactions. We demonstrate how to implement coin ripping for a recently proposed payment scheme [9, 8], giving a practical and transparent coin ripping scheme. We then give a general solution {{that can be used in}} any payment scheme with a challenge. We also indicate how fairness can be obtained by building a contract into the coin...|$|R
5000|$|A <b>digital</b> <b>coin</b> {{is defined}} as a chain of digital signatures. Each owner {{transfers}} the coin to the next by digitally signing a hash of the previous transaction and the public key of the next owner and adding these {{to the end of the}} coin. A payee can verify the signatures to verify the chain of ownership. With this approach, the payee is not able to ascertain that the transaction has not been publicly viewed by people accessing the internet. A common solution is to eliminate the trusted central counter party, or mint, that checks every transaction for double spending by introducing anonymization technology. In block chain technology, the coin is returned to the mint after every transaction for issuing a fresh new coin because only coins issued directly from the mint are trusted not to have been double spent. The problem with this solution is that the fate of the entire money system depends on the company running the mint, with every transaction having to go through the mint, just like a bank. The transactions can also be viewed by anybody with internet connectivity. Vic Coin have to find a mechanism for the payee to know that the previous owners of the coin did not sign any earlier transactions. In our case, the earliest transaction is the most significant; attempts to double spend in later transactions do not matter a lot. The only way to confirm the absence of a transaction is to be aware of all transactions. In the mint-based model, the mint was aware of all transactions and decided which arrived first. To accomplish this without a trusted party, transactions must be publicly announced, and need a system for participants to agree on a single history of the order in which was received. The payee needs proof that at the time of each transaction, the majority of master nodes agreed it was the first received ...|$|E
40|$|We propose three <b>digital</b> <b>coin</b> {{schemes for}} doing {{electronic}} transactions over the Internet. These schemes {{are based on}} one-way hash functions. The rst scheme uses an ordinary one-way single hash function chain, which forms {{the basis of a}} simple micropaymentscheme.

40|$|For {{real-world}} applications <b>digital</b> <b>coin</b> systems, i. e., off-line payment systems offering {{not only the}} unforgeability of conventional coins but also the anonymity of customers making purchases, {{need to have some}} additional features. One of these additional features is the hardware protection of the system, provided by dedicated tamper-resistant devices called observers which are used to physically prevent illegitimate copying of coins. Another essential feature for practical applications is anonymity-revocation mechanisms. Basically, <b>digital</b> <b>coin</b> systems guarantee perfect anonymity, i. e., the bank cannot link views of the withdrawal and payments in order {{to determine whether or not}} a customer spent her money at a certain shop. The customer’s privacy protection is the main difference between coin systems and those based on credit card or cheque based systems. While privacy protection is a desirable property of cash systems, perfect anonymity is not. Perfect anonymity makes possible perfect blackmailing or money laundering. To prevent such “perfect crime ” it must be possible to revoke the anonymity of customers in case of need. Anonymity revocation is done by a trusted third party. Cash systems that allow anonymity revocation are called fair. We present a coin system featuring both observer and fairness, showing that both concepts do not interfere with each other and can be implemented simultaneously without loss of security.

40|$|Abstract. Electronic {{payment is}} a key {{building}} block of distributed business applications in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). However, existing payment systems do not fulfill the requirements imposed by the highly dynamic and decentralized nature of MANETs. Either they rely on <b>digital</b> <b>coins</b> that suffer from usability problems, or they build on cellular phone technology which is bound to {{the availability of a}} fixed infrastructure. Therefore, we propose PAYFLUX, as a new system for electronic payment in MANETs. It is based on the light-weight Simple Public Key Infrastructure (SPKI) that allows for the decentralized creation and delegation of authorizations. Adopting the well-known abstraction of direct debits and enhancing it with new useful features, it offers good usability and can be easily integrated into the existing banking system. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{interference}} {{of fairness and}} observers in <b>digital</b> <b>coin</b> systems. Since copying of coins cannot be prevented cryptographically in anonymous off-line coin systems, double-spending detection {{is one of the}} major tasks. An observer is a tamper resistant device that prevents doublespending physically, i. e., Alice has no access to her coins and therefore she cannot copy them. <b>Digital</b> <b>coin</b> systems usually guarantee perfect anonymity. The bank cannot link views of the withdrawal and payments in order to determine wether or not a customer spents his money at a certain shop. Anonymity is one of the essentials of digital coins. The customer’s privacy protection is the main difference of coin systems from credit card or cheque based systems. While privacy protection is a desirable property of cash systems, perfect anonymity is not. Perfect anonymity enables criminals to do perfect blackmailing or money laundry, [vSN 92]. To prevent a perfect crime it has to be possible to revoke the anonymity of customers in case of need. Anonymity revocation is done by a trusted third party. Cash systems that allow anonymity revocation are called fair. We present a coin system which features both observer and fairness. This shows that both concepts do not interfere and can be implemented simultanously without loss of security. Unlike other fair off-line coin systems, fairness is realized with the help of the observer, which decreases the computational effort during the withdrawal...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. There {{has been}} a lot of {{off-line}} electronic cash systems proposed so far, which are based on the ‘digital coins ’ paradigm. Digital coins are anonymous, but not without drawbacks. Among the drawbacks are: large database requirement to record spent coins, customers must ‘carry ’ the coins prior payments, time consuming client side processing at payment (especially with multiple coins), and coin divisibility problems. Other proposals suggested account-based payment systems that are based on wire fund transfer, therefore the customers do not need to carry the coins nor divide coins. However, they only provide limited (or easily compromised) anonymity. In this paper we propose a novel solution, which we baptize ‘hybrid payment system ’ (HiPS). As its name implies, it is a hybrid of <b>digital</b> <b>coin</b> system and account-based payment system, and has the best features of both systems. Moreover, a judge can revoke complete anonymity in HiPS whenever required. (version: 9 June 2000...|$|E
40|$|The {{proliferation}} of technology emphasized {{new forms of}} payment.

Bitcoin or BTC is known as a <b>digital</b> <b>coin,</b> issued {{for the first time in}} 2009 and based on a peer to peer system. The difference from other forms of payment is that BTC is not controlled by any institution or central authority. BTC transactions have grown rapidly, ”asking" for regulation measures or legal approval of governments. Although BTC has become very popular, the market is poor and unfortunately of no confidence. There is a lack of regulation which can determine a number of risks associated with criminal financing activities. However, the legal status of Bitcoin is present in many European countries like Belgium, Bulgaria, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Lithuania, Norway, Poland, Slovenia, Switzerland or Turkey. Also, this type of currency has experienced a rapid evolution among coffee shops and restaurants...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} new {{micropayment}} {{scheme based on}} the use of &quot;electronic lottery tickets. &quot; This scheme is exceptionally efficient since the bank handles only winning tickets, instead of handling each micropayment. 1 Introduction We present a paradigm for micropayments: probabilistic payments with &quot;electronic lottery tickets. &quot; The probabilistic nature of lottery tickets makes payment of small values simple. For example, an electronic lottery ticket for a $ 10. 00 prize with a 1 / 1000 chance of winning has an expected value of one cent. A user can pay a vendor one cent by giving the vendor such a lottery ticket. With conventional payment schemes, a bank or broker must process each payment: the bank issues each <b>digital</b> <b>coin,</b> and processes it again when it is redeemed. Electronic lottery tickets are the first payment scheme in which the bank does not have to process each payment, since the bank only sees the &quot;winners. &quot; From a bank's point of view, lottery tickets are significantly more efficient than all previously known micropayment schemes...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Many {{electronic}} cash {{systems have been}} proposed {{with the proliferation of}} the Internet and the activation of electronic commerce. E-cash enables the exchange of <b>digital</b> <b>coins</b> with value assured by the bank’s signature and with concealed user identity. In an {{electronic cash}} system, a user can withdraw coins from the bank and then spends each coin anonymously and unlinkably. In this paper, we design an efficient anonymous mobile payment system based on bilinear pairings, in which the anonymity of coins is revocable by a trustee in case of dispute. The message transfer from the customer to the merchant occurs only once during the payment protocol. Also, the amount of communication between customer and merchant is about 800 bits. Therefore, our mobile payment system can be used in the wireless networks with the limited bandwidth.

40|$|A signcryption scheme {{combining}} {{public key}} encryptions and digital signatures in one logical step can simultaneously satisfy the security requirements of confidentiality, integrity, authenticity and non-repudiation {{and with a}} cost significantly lower than that required by the traditional "signature followed by encryption" approach. This thesis presents a new generic concept of time-stamped signcryption scheme with designated verifiability. Here an authenticated time-stamp {{is associated with the}} signcrypted text which can only be verifiable by a specific person, known as the designated verifier. The time-stamp is provided by a trusted third party, namely, Time Stamping System (TSS). The scheme is proved to be secure, as, no one, not even the signcrypter or TSS can produce a valid signcrypted text on behalf of them. We analyzed the security of the proposed scheme and found that it can withstand some active attacks. This scheme is resistant against both inside and outside attacks. The security of our scheme is based upon the hardness of solving Computational Diffie Hellman Problem (CDH), Discrete Logarithm Problem (DLP) and Integer Factorization Problem (IFP). The proposed scheme is suitable in scenarios such as, on-line patent submission, on-line lottery, e-cash, e-bidding and other e-commerce applications. Also we propose an e-cash system based on our proposed time-stamped signcryption scheme which confirms the notion of e-cash securities like anonymity of the spender, unforgeablity of the <b>digital</b> <b>coin,</b> prevention of double spending...|$|E

The first encryption takes place during the successful receipt of the coin, where a receive end number is used for encryption,which is unique for every receipt. The second step of encryption takes place during successful spending of the coin,where a spending end receive number is used for encryption, which is unique for every spending of the coin. These two unique numbers comprise the major part of encryption in this model, prevents double spending and preserves user anonymity. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{raise and}} propose {{solutions}} to the problem of guaranteeing that a user of incentive remailing services for anonymization cannot lose money if he does not get full service, i. e., if his message does not reach its destination. Applications such as voting over the Internet or reviewing of articles require anonymous delivery of messages. An anonymizing technique was proposed several decades ago by Chaum and is based on a group of volunteer agents called mixnet. However, mixnets are not yet widely known and used today, and one often mentioned reason is the lack of incentives for volunteers. A recently proposed solution is based on adding digital coins to messages, such that each volunteer can extract only the <b>digital</b> <b>coin</b> designated as a payment for her. However, registered volunteers can sabotage the system by extracting and using their coins without performing their task — which consists of forwarding anonymized messages. The main improvement we propose is to guarantee that no money is lost by the user without getting his message at the destination. This is an essential property for a viable service. Solutions described are based on handshaking mechanisms where each volunteer gets her payment (or key to decrypt the payment) from the agent to which she is expected to forward the message, or from the destination using a public board or a reply message. This ensures that a volunteer gets her financial support only if she fulfills her task. We discuss how techniques for nonrepudiation of receipt of a message, together with reputation systems, can address the remaining problems. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} high level network {{architecture}} for an economic system that integrates money, governance and reputation. We introduce a method for issuing, and redeeming a <b>digital</b> <b>coin</b> using a mechanism to create a sustainable global economy and a free market. To maintain a currency's value over time, and therefore be money proper, we claim it must be issued by the buyer and backed for value by the seller, exchanging the products of labour, in a free market. We also claim that a free market and sustainable economy cannot be maintained using economically arbitrary creation and allocation of money. Nakamoto, with Bitcoin, introduced a new technology called the cryptographic blockchain to operate a decentralised and distributed accounts ledger {{without the need for}} an untrusted third party. This blockchain technology creates and allocates new digital currency as a reward for "proof-of-work", to secure the network. However, no currency, digital or otherwise, has solved how to create and allocate money in an economically non-arbitrary way, or how to govern and trust a world-scale free enterprise money system. We propose an "Ontologically Networked Exchange" (ONE), with purpose as its highest order domain. Each purpose is defined in a contract, and the entire economy of contracts is structured in a unified ontology. We claim to secure the ONE network using economically non-arbitrary methodologies and economically incented human behaviour. Decisions influenced by reputation help to secure the network without an untrusted third party. The stack of contracts, organised in a unified ontology, functions as a super recursive algorithm, with individual use programming the algorithm, acting as the "oracle". The state of the algorithm becomes the "memory" of a scalable and trustable artificial intelligence (AI). This AI offers a new platform for what we call the "Autonomy-of-Things" (AoT).

40|$|Abstract — the {{majorities}} of contemporary proposed digital cash techniques have many disadvantages in being directly or indirectly account based or not anonymous and offer no offline peer-to-peer transferability. This is {{for the majority of}} users- in general- not acceptable. Such an approach fails to replace the role of cash in e-commerce systems. The basic result of this research is a new prepaid multi-hop (transferable) cash payment system solution based on hardware technology implementing an electronic wallet (e-wallet) to accommodate <b>digital</b> <b>coins.</b> Transparent cash transfer (exchange) protocol software can serve at any network device as Internet host, mobile device or any future general purpose communication link. The result is a peer to peer (P 2 P) electronic cash transfer equivalent to a physical cash transfer in public use. This e-cash system could be a possible alternative to the physical coins & bills. It is a multi-purpose inter-operable digital cash payment scheme for domestic usage. The system is suitable for low value (micro payments in the 1 cent range), as well as for larger payments, regardless of the communication platform or transmission medium...|$|R
