25|$|In 2012 {{researchers}} {{developed a}} method for storing electrical energy as chemical energy in higher alcohols (including butanol). These alcohols can then be used as liquid transportation fuels. The team led by James C. Liao genetically engineered lithoautotrophic microorganism known as Ralstonia Eutropha H16 to produce <b>isobutanol</b> and 3-methyl-1-butanol in an electro-bioreactor. Carbon dioxide is the sole carbon source for this process and electricity is used as the energetic component. The process they developed effectively separates the light and dark reactions that occur during photosynthesis. Solar panels are used to convert sunlight to electrical energy which is then converted using the microorganism to a chemical intermediate. The team {{is now in the}} process of scaling up the operation and believes this process will be more efficient than the biologic process.|$|E
25|$|Two major {{strategies}} used for monitoring and controlling V. pensylvanica include trapping with synthetic chemical attractants and tree shaking. Experiments on chemical attractants of V. pensylvanica and other generalist wasps show {{the effectiveness of}} using acetic acid in combination with these chemicals separately: <b>isobutanol,</b> heptyl butyrate, and butyl butyrate. Acetic acid alone {{did not have the}} same attractive effects as the chemical combinations. Using a vial dispenser, releasing up to an estimated 2.3 mg of heptyl butyrate per hour increased the number of yellowjackets attracted. In Hawaii, the Christmas tree is a large seasonal import each year. Over 90% of these trees contain live insects. Although V. pensylvanica typically resides in ground nests, queens occasionally choose these trees as overwintering sites. One potential strategy {{to reduce the number of}} yellowjackets and other generalist predators is applying preharvest permethrin sprays in combination with mechanical tree-shaking.|$|E
2500|$|... n-Butanol [...] or n-butyl {{alcohol or}} normal butanol {{is a primary}} alcohol with a 4-carbon {{structure}} and the chemical formula C4H9OH. Its isomers include <b>isobutanol,</b> 2-butanol, and tert-butanol. Butanol {{is one of the}} group of [...] "fusel alcohols" [...] (from the German for [...] "bad liquor"), which have more than two carbon atoms and have significant solubility in water.|$|E
2500|$|The {{octane rating}} of {{n-butanol}} {{is similar to}} that of gasoline but lower than that of ethanol and methanol. n-Butanol has a RON (Research Octane number) of 96 and a MON (Motor octane number) of 78 (with a resulting [...] "(R+M)/2 pump octane number" [...] of 87, as used in North America) while t-butanol has octane ratings of 105 RON and 89 MON. t-Butanol is used as an additive in gasoline but cannot be used as a fuel in its pure form because its relatively high melting point of 25.5°C (79°F) causes it to gel and solidify near room temperature. On the other hand, <b>isobutanol</b> has a lower melting point than n-butanol and favorable RON of 113 and MON of 94, and is thus much better suited to high fraction gasoline blends, blends with n-butanol, or as a standalone fuel.|$|E

50|$|Because CO2 {{is derived}} from the atmosphere, Cyanobacteria do not need plant matter to {{synthesize}} <b>isobutanol</b> (in other organisms which synthesize <b>isobutanol,</b> plant matter {{is the source of the}} carbon necessary to synthetically assemble <b>isobutanol).</b> Since plant matter is not used by this method of <b>isobutanol</b> production, the necessity to source plant matter from food sources and create a food-fuel price relationship is avoided.|$|E

50|$|S. cerevisiae cannot use five carbon sugars {{to produce}} <b>isobutanol.</b> The {{inability}} to use five-carbon sugars restricts S. cerevisiae from using lignocellulose, and means S. cerevisiae must use plant matter intended {{for human consumption}} to produce <b>isobutanol.</b> This results in an unfavorable food/fuel price relationship when <b>isobutanol</b> is produced by S. cerevisiae.|$|E
5000|$|Gevo has {{developed}} technology to retrofit existing ethanol production plants to produce <b>isobutanol.</b> Gevo’s Integrated Fermentation Technology, or GIFT, is an integrated technology {{platform for the}} efficient production and separation of <b>isobutanol.</b> GIFT consists of two components, proprietary biocatalysts that convert sugars derived from multiple renewable feedstocks into <b>isobutanol</b> through fermentation, and a proprietary separation unit {{that is designed to}} continuously separate <b>isobutanol</b> from water during the fermentation process.Gevo developed its technology platform to be compatible with the existing approximately 20 BGPY (Billion Gallons per Year) of global operating ethanol production capacity, as estimated by the Renewable Fuels Association. GIFT is designed to allow relatively low capital expenditure retrofits of existing ethanol facilities, enabling a rapid and cost-efficient route to <b>isobutanol</b> production from the fermentation of renewable feedstocks. Gevo is also developing biocatalysts to convert sugars derived from biomass to produce cellulosic <b>isobutanol</b> once the conversion technology is commercially viable. Gevo plans to expand its production capacity beyond its initial commercial facility to produce and sell over 500 million gallons of <b>isobutanol</b> by 2014.|$|E

50|$|<b>Isobutanol</b> — Without any modification, <b>isobutanol</b> has {{applications}} as {{a specialty}} chemical and a fuel blendstock. In the fuel blendstock market, <b>isobutanol</b> {{can be used}} to replace high-value blendstocks, such as alkylate, and can be blended in conjunction with, or as a substitute for, ethanol and other widely used fuel oxygenates. In November 2010, Gevo became the first company to receive EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) certification for <b>isobutanol</b> as a fuel blendstock after meeting the EPA’s standards under the Clean Air Act. The global gasoline oxygenate market is approximately 40 BGPY, based upon data from the International Energy Agency (IEA). While <b>isobutanol</b> {{can be used as a}} replacement for ethanol, its product properties are significantly differentiated from ethanol. As a gasoline blendstock, isobutanol’s low Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP), high energy content and low water solubility compared to ethanol make it a valuable product that can be sold directly to refiners and is compatible with existing engine and industry infrastructure, including pipeline assets. <b>Isobutanol</b> can also be sold for immediate use as a specialty solvent. This global market for butanol represents approximately 1.1 BGPY, based upon volume data from SRI.|$|E
50|$|Bacillus subtilis is a gram-positive {{rod-shaped}} bacteria.

Similar to E. coli, Bacillus subtilis is capable of producing <b>isobutanol</b> from lignocellulose, and is easily manipulated by common genetic techniques. Elementary mode analysis has also been used to improve the isobutanol-synthesis metabolic pathway used by Bacillus subtilis, leading to higher yields of <b>isobutanol</b> being produced.|$|E

50|$|E. coli has the {{capacity}} to use lignocellulose (waste plant matter left over from agriculture) in the synthesis of <b>isobutanol.</b> The use of lignocellulose prevents E. coli from using plant matter meant for human consumption, and prevents any food-fuel price relationship which would occur from the biosynthesis of <b>isobutanol</b> by E. coli.|$|E
50|$|Higher-chain {{alcohols}} have energy densities {{close to}} gasoline, {{are not as}} volatile or corrosive as ethanol, and do not readily absorb water. Furthermore, branched-chain alcohols, such as <b>isobutanol,</b> have higher-octane numbers, resulting in less knocking in engines. Although produced naturally during the fermentation of carbohydrates and {{may also be a}} byproduct of the decay process of organic matter, <b>Isobutanol</b> or C5 alcohols have never been produced from a renewable source with yields high enough to make them viable as a gasoline substitute before the 2008 Nature article that produced over 20g/L <b>isobutanol</b> from glucose in E.coli.|$|E
