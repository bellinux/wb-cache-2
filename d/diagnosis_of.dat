40|$|AbstractVarious formal {{theories}} {{have been proposed}} in the literature to capture the notions <b>of</b> <b>diagnosis</b> underlying diagnostic programs. Examples of such notions are: heuristic classification, which is used in systems incorporating empirical knowledge, and model-based diagnosis, which is used in diagnostic systems based on detailed domain models. Typically, such domain models include knowledge of causal, structural, and functional interactions among modelled objects. In this paper, a new set-theoretical framework for the analysis <b>of</b> <b>diagnosis</b> is presented. Basically, the framework distinguishes between ‘evidence functions’, which characterize the net impact of knowledge bases for purposes <b>of</b> <b>diagnosis,</b> and ‘notions <b>of</b> diagnosis’, which define how evidence functions are {{to be used to}} map findings observed for a problem case to diagnostic solutions. This set-theoretical framework offers a simple, yet powerful tool for comparing existing notions <b>of</b> <b>diagnosis,</b> as well as for proposing new notions <b>of</b> <b>diagnosis.</b> A theory <b>of</b> flexible notions <b>of</b> <b>diagnosis,</b> called refinement diagnosis, is proposed and defined in terms of this framework.

40|$|In this paper, {{diagnosis}} {{is viewed as}} a two-stage process: domain knowledge is rst interpreted in a diagnostic sense; next, observed ndings are interpreted with respect to this interpreted knowledge and a given hypothesis, yielding a diagnosis. A set-theoretical framework is briey discussed that captures this view on diagnosis; it is used to formalize various notions <b>of</b> <b>diagnosis,</b> those proposed in the literature included. Next, a theory <b>of</b> exible <b>diagnosis,</b> called renement diagnosis, is proposed and dened in terms of this framework.

40|$|Abstract Background We have {{previously}} shown {{that in the}} UK mortality in people with Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (AML) was nearly 50 % greater among the most socio-economically deprived. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine whether AML patients from lower socioeconomic classes had a lower chance of receiving a bone marrow transplant. Methods Using Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data, we identified all incident cases of AML admitted to UK hospitals between 1998 and 2007. We calculated the number of bone marrow transplantations undertaken in AML patients, stratifying our results by gender, age at <b>diagnosis,</b> year <b>of</b> <b>diagnosis,</b> degree <b>of</b> socioeconomic deprivation and co-morbidity. We used logistic regression to calculate odds ratios for bone marrow transplantation, adjusting for gender, age at <b>diagnosis,</b> year <b>of</b> <b>diagnosis,</b> degree <b>of</b> socioeconomic deprivation and co-morbidity score. Results We identified a total of 23 910 incident cases of AML over this 10 -year time period, of whom 1 140 (4. 8 %) underwent BMT. Bone marrow transplantation declined with increasing socioeconomic deprivation (p for trend Conclusion This large cohort study demonstrates that AML patients from lower socioeconomic classes are less likely to undergo bone marrow transplantation than their better off counter-parts. </p...|$|R

Blood tests are generally performed to exclude the possibility of another cause for weakness, such as {{a low level of}} potassium in the blood. An abnormally low level of sodium in the blood is often encountered in Guillain–Barré syndrome. This has been attributed to the inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone, leading to relative retention of water.|$|E
