Three different mass spectra are studied in detail, namely the exponential, discrete (two components), and power-law cases. It is found that the dynamical friction deceleration can be significantly stronger than in the equivalent classical case, with the largest differences (up to a factor of 10 or more in extreme cases) arising for test particle velocities comparable to the mass-averaged velocity dispersion of the <b>field</b> <b>particles.</b> The present results are relevant {{to our understanding of the}} dynamical evolution of globular clusters, in particular in the modelization of mass segregation and sedimentation of Blue Straggler stars and Neutron stars, and for the study of binary black holes in galactic nuclei.

40|$|Spin wave {{theory of}} {{magnetism}} and BCS theory of superconductivity are typical theories of the time before renormalization group (RG) theory. The two theories consider atomistic interactions only and ignore the energy degrees of freedom of the continuous (infinite) solid. Since the pioneering work of Kenneth G. Wilson (Nobel Prize of physics in 1982) {{we know that the}} continuous solid is characterized by a particular symmetry: invariance with respect to transformations of the length scale. Associated with this symmetry are particular <b>field</b> <b>particles</b> with characteristic excitation spectra. In diamagnetic solids these are the well known Debye bosons. This book reviews experimental work on solid state physics of the last five decades and shows in a phenomenological way that the dynamics of ordered magnets and conventional superconductors is controlled by the <b>field</b> <b>particles</b> of the infinite solid and not by magnons and Cooper pairs, respectively. In the case of ordered magnets the relevant <b>field</b> <b>particles</b> are called GSW bosons after Goldstone, Salam and Weinberg {{and in the case of}} superconductors the relevant <b>field</b> <b>particles</b> are called SC bosons. One can imagine these bosons as magnetic density waves or charge density waves, respectively. Crossover from atomistic exchange interactions to the excitations of the infinite solid occurs because the GSW bosons have generally lower excitation energies than the atomistic magnons. According to the principle of relevance the dynamics is governed by the excitations with the lowest energy. The non relevant atomistic interactions with higher energy are practically unimportant for the dynamics...|$|R

2500|$|Mean <b>field</b> <b>particle</b> {{methods are}} a broad class of {{interacting}} type Monte Carlo algorithms for simulating from {{a sequence of}} probability distributions satisfying a nonlinear evolution equation These flows of probability measures can always be interpreted as the distributions of the random states of a Markov process whose transition probabilities depends on the distributions of the current random states. A natural way to simulate these sophisticated nonlinear Markov processes is to sample {{a large number of}} copies of the process, replacing in the evolution equation the unknown distributions of the random states by the sampled empirical measures. [...] In contrast with traditional Monte Carlo and Markov chain Monte Carlo methods these mean <b>field</b> <b>particle</b> techniques rely on sequential interacting samples. The terminology mean field reflects the fact that each of the samples (a.k.a. particles, individuals, walkers, agents, creatures, or phenotypes) interacts with the empirical measures of the process. When the size of the system tends to infinity, these random empirical measures converge to the deterministic distribution of the random states of the nonlinear Markov chain, so that the statistical interaction between particles vanishes. In other words, starting with a chaotic configuration based on independent copies of initial state of the nonlinear Markov chain model, the chaos propagates at any time horizon as the size the system tends to infinity; that is, finite blocks of particles reduces to independent copies of the nonlinear Markov process. This result is called the propagation of chaos property. The terminology [...] "propagation of chaos" [...] originated with [...] the work of Mark Kac in 1976 on a colliding mean field kinetic gas model ...|$|E
2500|$|In physics, {{and more}} {{particularly}} in statistical mechanics, these nonlinear evolution equations {{are often used}} to describe the statistical behavior of microscopic interacting [...] particles in a fluid or in some condensed matter. In this context, the random evolution of a virtual fluid or a gas particle is represented by McKean-Vlasov diffusion processes, reaction–diffusion systems, or Boltzmann type collision processes. As its name indicates, the mean <b>field</b> <b>particle</b> model represents the collective behavior of microscopic particles weakly interacting with their occupation measures. The macroscopic behavior of these many-body particle systems is encapsulated in the limiting model obtained when the size of the population tends to infinity. Boltzmann equations represent the macroscopic evolution of colliding particles in rarefied gases, while McKean Vlasov diffusions represent the macroscopic behavior of fluid particles and granular gases.|$|E
2500|$|In other problems, the {{objective}} is generating draws from a sequence of probability distributions satisfying a nonlinear evolution equation. These flows of probability distributions can always be interpreted as the distributions of the random states of a Markov process whose transition probabilities depend on the distributions of the current random states (see McKean-Vlasov processes, nonlinear filtering equation). In other instances we are given a flow of probability distributions with an increasing level of sampling complexity (path spaces models with an increasing time horizon, Boltzmann-Gibbs measures associated with decreasing temperature parameters, and many others). These models {{can also be seen}} as the evolution of the law of the random states of a nonlinear Markov chain. [...] A natural way to simulate these sophisticated nonlinear Markov processes is to sample a large number of copies of the process, replacing in the evolution equation the unknown distributions of the random states by the sampled empirical measures.
