500|$|A {{review of}} American and Pacific golden plover records was begun in 1991, {{with the purpose}} of {{evaluating}} whether any individuals previously accepted as [...] "either American or Pacific" [...] could now be definitely assigned to one species or the other (and vice versa). The results (a small {{decrease in the number of}} accepted American golden plovers, and a small increase in the number of accepted Pacifics) were published in the committee's report for 1996, with a comment that a detailed paper on the subject was being prepared, although as of 2009, this has not been published. A review of <b>isabelline</b> <b>shrike</b> records commenced in 1986. This review, the results of which were published in 1989, established a racial identification for a number of adult isabelline shrikes previously accepted to species level. A further review, with the same aim, was begun in the late 1990s. A preliminary set of results of this review was published in 2003; four previously accepted individuals were rejected, including one, in Cambridgeshire in 1978, which is now thought have been a hybrid with red-backed shrike. The full results of this second review were published in 2007; some of the previous racial attributions were withdrawn, but the committee felt able to confidently assign a race for a number of more recent individuals, although it stressed that this could only be done with adult birds (the committee's 2005 report mentions that a further article is in preparation). A review of black-eared wheatears was conducted in 2002–04, with the aim of assigning individuals to the eastern and western races where possible; this was possible with nine records; both western hispanica and eastern melanoleuca were shown to have occurred.|$|E
5000|$|... (p. 349) <b>Isabelline</b> <b>shrike</b> (Lanius isabellinus) {{is split}} into two species, Daurian shrike (L. isabellinus sensu stricto) and Turkestan shrike (L. phoenicuroides) ...|$|E
500|$|The shrikes are {{a family}} of slender, long-tailed passerines, most of its members being in the genus Lanius, the typical shrikes. They are short-necked birds with rounded wings and a hooked tip to the bill. Most occur in open habitats. The affiliations of the masked shrike {{with other members of}} the genus are uncertain; the [...] "brown" [...] shrikes (brown, red-backed and <b>isabelline</b> <b>shrikes)</b> and {{tropical}} species like the Somali fiscal have both been suggested as possible relatives. The masked shrike has no subspecies.|$|R
5000|$|The red-tailed shrike (Lanius phoenicuroides) is {{a member}} of the shrike family (Laniidae). It was {{formerly}} considered conspecific with the <b>isabelline</b> <b>shrike</b> and the red-backed shrike.|$|E

50|$|Several {{issues of}} Dutch Birding have been {{dedicated}} to specific themes. These include an issue focussing on {{the identification of}} Western Palearctic swifts, one on Nearctic gulls in Europe, one on the <b>isabelline</b> <b>shrike</b> complex, and one on crossbill calls. Volume 25 no 1 contained four papers on pine buntings.|$|E
50|$|The term {{is found}} in {{reference}} to plumage colouring in the bird species names isabelline bush-hen, isabelline wheatear, and <b>isabelline</b> <b>shrike,</b> {{as well as in}} descriptions of birds. The genetic pigmentation disorder isabellinism seen in birds is derived from the colour word and is a form of leucism caused by a uniform reduction in the production and expression of melanin resulting in areas of plumage {{on the back of the}} bird, normally black, being strongly faded, or isabelline, in appearance. Isabellinism has been reported in several species of penguin.|$|E
50|$|Cemlyn has {{attracted}} a number of vagrant birds. It is most famous among twitchers as the site where a bridled tern spent several weeks in July 1988, and where the similarly rare (in a British context) sooty tern was present on and off in July 2005. Both species had at these times been seen by {{only a very small}} number of birders in Britain. Also at Cemlyn in 2005 were an American golden plover in May and a Terek sandpiper in June. In 1998, an <b>isabelline</b> <b>shrike</b> was present for most of the month of July.|$|E
5000|$|The {{brown shrike}} (Lanius cristatus) is {{a bird in}} the shrike family that is found mainly in Asia. It {{is closely related to}} the red-backed shrike (L. collurio) and <b>isabelline</b> <b>shrike</b> (L. isabellinus). The genus name, Lanius, is derived from the Latin word for [...] "butcher", and some shrikes are also known as [...] "butcher birds" [...] because of their feeding habits. The {{specific}} cristatus is Latin for [...] "crested", used in a broader sense than in English. The common English name [...] "shrike" [...] is from Old English scríc, [...] "shriek", referring to the shrill call.|$|E
