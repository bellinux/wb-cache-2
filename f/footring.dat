2500|$|South Gaulish samian {{typically}} has a redder {{slip and}} deeper pink fabric than Italian sigillata. [...] The best slips, vivid red and of an almost mirror-like brilliance, were achieved during the Claudian and early Neronian periods (Claudius, reg. AD 41–54; [...] Nero, reg. AD 54–68). [...] At the same period, some workshops experimented briefly with a marbled red-and-yellow slip, a variant that never became generally popular. [...] Early production of plain forms in South Gaul initially followed the Italian models closely, {{and even the}} characteristic Arretine decorated form, Dragendorff 11, was made. [...] But many new shapes quickly evolved, and by {{the second half of}} the 1st century AD, when Italian sigillata was no longer influential, South Gaulish samian had created its own characteristic repertoire of forms. The two principal decorated forms were Dragendorff 30, a deep, cylindrical bowl, and Dragendorff 29, a carinated ('keeled') shallow bowl with a marked angle, emphasised by a moulding, mid-way down the profile. [...] The <b>footring</b> is low, and potters' stamps are usually bowl-maker's marks placed in the interior base, so that vessels made from the same, or parallel, moulds may bear different names. [...] The rim of the 29, small and upright in early examples of the form, but much deeper and more everted by the 70s of the 1st century, is finished with rouletted decoration, and the relief-decorated surfaces necessarily fall into two narrow zones. [...] These were usually decorated with floral and foliate designs of wreaths and scrolls at first: the Dr.29 resting on its rim illustrated in the lead section of this article is an early example, less angular than the developed form of the 60s and 70s, with decoration consisting of simple, very elegant leaf-scrolls. [...] Small human and animal figures, and more complex designs set out in separate panels, became more popular by the 70s of the 1st century. [...] Larger human and animal figures could be used on the Dr.30 vessels, but while many of these have great charm, South Gaulish craftsmen never achieved, and perhaps never aspired to, the Classical naturalism of some of their Italian counterparts.|$|E
50|$|Under Süleyman the Magnificent (1520-66), {{demand for}} Iznik wares increased. Jugs, hanging lamps, cups, bowls and dishes were produced, {{inspired}} by metalwork and illuminated books {{as well as}} Chinese ceramics. Many large dishes were made with looser designs, incorporating ships, animals, trees and flowers. The dishes {{appear to have been}} made for display, as most have pierced <b>footrings</b> {{so that they can be}} hung up, but they have been observed also to be scratched from use. Designs in the 1520s include the saz style in which a long, serrated saz leaf, dynamically arranged, is balanced by static rosette forms. In the later 16th century, the quatre fleurs style used a repertoire of stylised tulips, carnations, roses and hyacinths.|$|R
50|$|The prehistoric archaeological finds {{from the}} Aschbach area {{are among the}} most {{important}} in the Kusel district. As early as 1884 to 1886, Regional Engineer Göring from Kaiserslautern had three barrows opened up. Many objects of worship and everyday use were unearthed, four neckrings, about 15 armrings, six <b>footrings,</b> several rings, many bronze pieces, urn shards and flint arrowheads. An exact itemization of the finds was compiled long ago by Fritz Kleinschmidt. The barrows dated from the Bronze Age, about 1500 BC. Also unearthed by archaeologists was an ironworks next to the path between the hiking car park and Kreuzfeld, south of the former baryte quarry. Other finds from early historical times, namely from Roman times, came to light between Aschbach and Nerzweiler, with what was supposedly the foundations of a Roman bath with six rooms.|$|R
5000|$|It {{is certain}} that {{the area around the}} village was settled as long ago as prehistoric times, bearing witness to which is a wealth of archaeological ﬁnds within the municipality’s limits. Two stone hatchets have been {{unearthed}} here, one near the village in the ﬁeld called “Im Flur” and the other towards the municipality’s southern limits in the Jungenwald (forest). Further ﬁnds from the New Stone Age have been potsherds from the Linear Pottery culture and the Rössen culture. Potsherds have also been found from the Iron Age, as has a bronze ring. Some of these objects were once kept at the former school in its own collection. Moreover, within municipal limits lies several groups of, numbering all together about 20, barrows. In 1884, out towards the boundary with Wolfstein, four Celtic graves were unearthed. Found there were neckrings, armrings and <b>footrings,</b> which can now be found at the Historisches Museum in Speyer. Unearthed in Lohnweiler, too, have been various ﬁnds from Roman times that are among the most important in the whole district. There have been Roman pieces of brick, potsherds and bronze coins with the emperor’s efﬁgy. Of the ﬁnds, author Helmut Bernhard wrote in 1990 “On an eastern slope over the Lauter hollow, an extensive estate complex has been known since 1973, from which, during building work several wall lines with hypocaust heating and cellars were dug up. Quite obviously, in this place the main building of a major estate was struck. On the broad sloped surface going down to the Lauter hollow stood the commercial buildings. In 1988, it was possible to unearth a slope wall and a major house. The complex, judging from the few ﬁnds, existed at least until the middle of the 4th century. The manor house’s cellar with two wall niches, a light shaft and stairways is preserved on a private property.” ...|$|R

An Iron Age mound, which {{was part of}} the Albessen group of barrows, was opened up in the 19th century, but has now disappeared. Grave goods were recovered and described (a bronze ring, a <b>footring,</b> armrings and a bronze figurine), but their whereabouts are likewise now unknown. In Gallo-Roman times, too, the area was settled, even if no archaeological ﬁnds from the time have been made in Herchweiler itself.

50|$|The {{outer shell}} {{is made from}} silver-gilt, the rim once had a U-sectioned strip of ungilded silver {{although}} this has now mostly been lost. This strip was originally attached using 4 clips {{in the shape of}} animal heads although 2 of these have also been lost.The bowl's gilt-silver exterior is decorated with Anglo-Saxon style interlaced fabulous creatures amid Continental style vines, the frontal gaze of some of the creatures on the bowl is a common occurrence in carvings of this type. These decorations show plants, grapes, fruit, animals and birds in both naturalistic and grotesque style.Another beaded band is riveted on in four places outside the rim. These rivets have square mountings, in one of which a piece of blue glass survives. The external base plate features five domed rivets. The interlaced cruciform decoration between these rivets has been made using a repoussé technique. The bowl may also once have had a <b>footring</b> made from gilded wire.|$|E
5000|$|Sigillata vessels, both {{plain and}} decorated, were {{manufactured}} at several centres in southern France, including Bram, Montans, La Graufesenque, Le Rozier and Banassac, {{from the late}} 1st century BC: of these, La Graufesenque, near Millau, was the principal producer and exporter. Although the establishment of sigillata potteries in Gaul may well have arisen initially to meet local demand and to undercut the prices of imported Italian goods, they became enormously successful in their own right, and by the later 1st century AD, South Gaulish samian was being exported not only to other provinces in the north-west of the Empire, but also to Italy and {{other regions of the}} Mediterranean, North Africa and even the eastern Empire. One of the finds in the ruins of Pompeii, destroyed by the eruption of Vesuvius in August AD 79, was a consignment of South Gaulish sigillata, still in its packing crate; like all finds from the Vesuvian sites, this hoard of pottery is invaluable as dating evidence.South Gaulish samian typically has a redder slip and deeper pink fabric than Italian sigillata. The best slips, vivid red and of an almost mirror-like brilliance, were achieved during the Claudian and early Neronian periods (Claudius, reg. AD 41-54; Nero, reg. AD 54-68).

This simple shape remained the standard Gaulish samian relief-decorated form, from all Gaulish manufacturing regions, for more than a century. Small relief-decorated beakers such as forms Déchelette 67 and Knorr 78 were also made in South Gaul, as were occasional 'one-off' or very ambitious mould-made vessels, such as large thin-walled flagons and flasks. [...] But the mass of South Gaulish samian found on Roman sites of the 1st century AD consists of plain dishes, bowls and cups, especially Dr.18 (a shallow dish) and Dr.27 (a little cup with a distinctive double curve to the profile), many of which bear potters' name-stamps, and the large decorated forms 29, 30 and 37.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the boundary layer and the emission spectrum from an accretion disk having a jet anchored at its inner radius, {{close to the}} black hole. We summarise our earlier work {{and apply it to}} the accretion disks of some blazars. We suggest that the 'accretion disk with jet' (ADJ) model could make the bridge between standard accretion disk models (suitable for quasars and FRII sources) and low-power advection dominated accretion disk models (suitable for some of the low- power BL Lacs and FRI sources). The jet is collimated within a very narrow region close to the black hole (nozzle). In our model it is assumed that the boundary layer of the disk is the region between radius R-ms - the last marginally stable circular orbit calculated for a Kerr geometry-and the radius R- jet, which gives the thickness of the 'footring', i. e. the base of the jet. We analyse the size of the boundary layer of the disk where the jet is fed with energy, mass, and angular momentum. As a consequence of the angular momentum extraction, the accretion disk beyond R-jet no longer has a Keplerian flow. A hot corona usually surrounds the disk, and entrainment of the corona along the flow could also be important for the energy and mass budget of the jet. We assume that the gravitational energy available at the <b>footring</b> of the jet goes into the jet, and so the spectrum from the accretion disk gives a total luminosity smaller than that of a 'standard' accretion disk, and our ADJ model should apply for blazars with low central luminosities. Variations of the boundary layer and nozzle may account for some of the variability observed in active galactic nuclei...|$|E
