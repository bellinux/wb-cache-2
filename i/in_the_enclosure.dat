40|$|The {{rates of}} {{ingestion}} of natural bacterial assemblages by natural populations of zooplankton (> 50 μm in size) were measured during a 19 -day period in eutrophic Frederiksborg Slotssø, Denmark, {{as well as}} in experimental enclosures (containing 5. 3 m 3 of lake water). The fish and nutrients of <b>the</b> <b>enclosures</b> were manipulated. <b>In</b> enclosures without fish, large increases in ingestion by zooplankton > 140 μm in size were found (up to 3 μg of C liter− 1 h− 1), compared with values less than 0. 3 μg of C liter− 1 h− 1 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>enclosures</b> with fish and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> open lake. Daphnia cucullata and D. galeata dominated the community of zooplankton of > 140 μm. Ingestion rates for zooplankton between 50 and 140 μm decreased after a period of about 8 days, in all <b>enclosures</b> and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lake, to values below 0. 1 μg of C liter− 1 h− 1. On the last 2 sampling days, somewhat higher values were observed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>enclosures</b> with fish present. The > 50 -μm zooplankton ingested 48 to 51 % of the bacterial net secondary production in enclosures without fish, compared to 4 % <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>enclosures</b> with added fish. Considering the sum of bacterial secondary production plus biomass change, 35 to 41 % of the available bacteria were ingested by zooplankton of > 50 μm <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>enclosures</b> without fish, compared with 4 to 6 % <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>enclosures</b> with added fish and 21 % <b>in</b> <b>the</b> open lake. Fish predation reduced the occurrence of zookplankton sized > 50 μm and thus left {{a large proportion of the}} available bacteria to zooplankton sized < 50 μm. In fact, there were 4. 6 × 103 to 5. 0 × 103 flagellates (4 to 8 μm in size) ml− 1 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>enclosures</b> with fish added as well as <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lake, compared with 0. 5 × 102 to 2. 3 × 102 ml− 1 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>enclosures</b> without fish.

30|$|Still, all <b>the</b> {{measurement}} locations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> National military museum {{were found}} to be similar or better than typical European “historic house museums”. <b>The</b> observed reduction <b>in</b> <b>the</b> photo-oxidizing load and risk inside <b>the</b> <b>enclosures</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Warehouse for foreign uniforms (1) and the contemporary history room <b>in</b> <b>the</b> main museum building (3) was an expected protective effect of <b>the</b> <b>enclosures.</b> <b>The</b> higher measured photo-oxidizing impact inside <b>the</b> wooden chest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> probative storage room (2) than in this room itself was thus surprising. This could be due to some unidentified oxidation impact, but probably more likely due to dust accumulation on the dosimeter glass, as the dosimeter was positioned horizontally besides rough textile materials (see Fig.  1, position 2 b). Although dust accumulation was probably not a risk for <b>the</b> objects <b>in</b> this case, this points to the possible damage risks that may occur when co-locating sensitive objects with objects or materials which off-gas or release harmful substances. The slightly higher acidic impact measured inside all <b>the</b> <b>enclosures</b> than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> respective rooms <b>in</b> <b>the</b> National military museum is typical. It is well known that the levels of gaseous organic compounds are usually higher inside than outside of enclosures [9, 12, 38]. This is due to the larger emitting surfaces as compared to the volumes and usually lower ventilation rates of enclosures as compared to rooms. The small differences between the measured acidic impact <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>enclosures</b> and <b>the</b> rooms <b>in</b> <b>the</b> National military museum indicated little risk related to organic acid off gassing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>enclosures.</b> This may be due to relatively low emitting materials and/or ventilation effects <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>enclosures.</b> <b>The</b> emission from materials is typically reduced as they age, and <b>the</b> aging of <b>enclosures</b> contribute to lower internal off gassing.|$|R

5|$|The {{expansion}} of funerary monuments {{began in the}} reign of Djoser, who built his complex entirely of stone and placed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>enclosure</b> a step pyramid under which he was buried: the Pyramid of Djoser. For {{the rest of the}} Old Kingdom, tomb and temple were joined in elaborate stone pyramid complexes. Near each pyramid complex was a town that supplied its needs, as towns would support temples throughout Egyptian history. Other changes came in the reign of Sneferu who, beginning with his first pyramid at Meidum, built pyramid complexes symmetrically along an east–west axis, with a valley temple {{on the banks of the}} Nile linked to a pyramid temple at the foot of the pyramid. Sneferu's immediate successors followed this pattern, but beginning in the late Old Kingdom, pyramid complexes combined different elements from the axial plan and from the rectangular plan of Djoser. To supply the pyramid complexes, kings founded new towns and farming estates on undeveloped lands across Egypt. The flow of goods from these lands to the central government and its temples helped unify the kingdom.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} large grazers (Daphnia) and {{nutrients}} (nitrogen and phosphorus) on epilimnetic ciliate communities were investigated in eight large in situ enclosures. Contrasts in Daphnia abundance {{were created by}} stocking planktivorous fish (Phoxinus eos) <b>in</b> four of <b>the</b> eight <b>enclosures.</b> Contrasts <b>in</b> nutrients were created by adding nitrate and phosphate to two enclosures with fish and to two enclosures without fish. Both the biomass and mean length of total zooplankton were significantly greater <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fish-free <b>enclosures</b> than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>enclosures</b> with fish. Addition of nutrients and fish produced a four-fold variation in concentration of total epilimnetic phosphorus and six-fold variation in algal biomass (Chl a).

Addition of nutrients did not increase ciliate abundance in enclosures with Daphnia, but ciliate mean lengths were larger in these enclosures. Ciliate abundance increased with increasing zooplankton biomass when Daphnia were lacking, but it declined rapidly when Daphnia were abundant, producing a hyperbolic pattern. When the data for all the treatments were considered together, there was no relationship between copepod biomass and ciliate abundance, but positive relationships, although not highly significant, cmcrged when <b>the</b> data for <b>enclosures</b> with and without fish were considered separately.

40|$|Fish {{predation}} {{was tested}} {{as a factor}} mediating the coexistence of Daphnia taxa <b>in</b> <b>the</b> shallow, hypertrophic Lake Blankaart. Naturally co-occurring populations of D. galeata and the hybrid D. galeata x cucullata were subjected to different levels of fish predation in in situ enclosures. In control <b>enclosures</b> without fish, <b>the</b> largest taxon D. galeata rapidly became dominant over the intermediate sized D. galeata x cucullata, mainly {{as a result of}} higher birth rates. In enclosures with fish, population densities of D. galeata dropped relative to D. galeata x cucullata, due to higher mortality rates. These results are <b>in</b> concordance with <b>the</b> 'temporal hybrid superiority hypothesis', and can be explained by a higher vulnerability of the large and more conspicuous D. galeata to the size selective predation exerted by visually hunting planktivorous fishes. After approximately one month, however, population growth rates of D. galeata and D. galeata x cucullata <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>enclosures</b> with fish converged, due to a relative reduction <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mortality rate of D. galeata. This suggests that, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> presence of fish, D. galeata may co-exist with hybrids due to a decrease in its relative vulnerability to visual predation with time. Indeed, both D. galeata and the hybrid showed strong reductions in adult body size <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>enclosures</b> with fish, but this size reduction tended to be stronger in D. galeata than in D. galeata x cucullata.

5|$|An Enclosure Act is a {{parliamentary}} authority to fence-off common land, thus making that land private property, while awarding commoners land in compensation. Inclosure {{is the name}} given to the parliamentary statute thus created. The enclosure process began in the 13th century and was supported by Acts of Parliament from 1640. In November 1833, the Isle of Ely intended to apply for Acts of Parliament to enclose the lands of Little Thetford. Officials arrived in the village armed {{with nothing more than}} a notice to be pinned on the Church of England's St. George's church door, but were prevented from doing so by a dozen villagers. They returned later with ten constables, authorised by Ely magistrates, and were confronted this time by 150stick-wielding protesters, who continued to prevent due process. When the clergyman, Henry Hervey Baber, arrived the following afternoon, he was prevented from carrying out his normal Sunday service. Villagers may have rebelled against the church at this time, perhaps believing it was acting on behalf of the establishment <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>enclosure</b> acts. This event may have been the trigger that, five years later, encouraged a strong Baptist following amongst the poorer villagers. About half the total area of Little Thetford was eventually enclosed in 1844, seven years after that of Stretham.|$|E

Pugin and he excavated around the keep, investigating how it was built. He descended into the well in a bucket in an unsuccessful search for treasure. Victor Child Villiers, 7th Earl of Jersey, leased the castle to the Corporation of Rochester in 1870 for use as a public park; when it opened to the public in 1872, Rochester Castle was presented as a picturesque ruin, with trees planted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>enclosure</b> and the walls overgrown with ivy. In 1884 the Corporation bought the castle for £6,572 (equivalent to £3.4million in 2009 terms). Between 1896 and 1904, George Payne carried out repairs. In {{the first quarter of the}} century the gardens acquired a German field gun and a tank from the First World War, and a bandstand, though they were removed by 1961. Ivy was removed from the keep between 1919 and 1931 and the planting in the castles scaled back. In 1960 the origin of Boley Hill was investigated archaeologically, but the excavations failed to provide firm dating evidence.|$|E

25|$|In 1348, {{while the}} black plague ravaged Europe, the Alcazaba and the castle of Gibralfaro took their final shape. The city had several gates that allowed {{passage through the}} walls, some of which still stand today, such as the Puerta Oscura (Dark Gate) and the Puerta del Mar (Sea Gate). Looming over the port, the Alcazaba was the Moorish citadel built on the hill called Mount Gibralfaro in {{the centre of the}} city, on whose summit was the castle.

On the north side, there was a metal gate that Smith assigned several men to guard. These men noticed 50–100 Iraqi fighters who had taken positions in trenches just beyond the gate. He summoned a Bradley fighting vehicle to attack their position. Three nearby M113 Armored Personnel Carriers came to support the attack. An M113 was hit, possibly by a mortar, and all three crewmen were wounded. The Bradley, damaged and running low on ammunition, withdrew to reload during a lull in the battle. Smith organized the evacuation of the injured M113 crewmen. However, behind the courtyard was a military aid station crowded with 100 combat casualties.

40|$|AbstractAn {{experimental}} study using mesocosms was conducted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> main shallow lake of a temperate wetland (Otamendi Natural Reserve, Argentina) to analyse {{the impact of}} zooplankton on phytoplankton and the microbial assemblages. The lake is characterised {{by the presence of}} a fluctuating cover of floating macrophytes, whose shading effects shape the phytoplakton community and the ecosystem functioning, which was absent during the study period. The experiment was run in situ using polyethylene bags, comparing treatments with and without zooplankton. The cascade effect of zooplankton on phytoplankton and the lower levels of the microbial food web (ciliates, heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNF) and picoplankton) were analysed. A significant zooplankton grazing on the nano-phytoplankton fraction (3 – 30 μm) was observed. Conversely, large algae (filamentous cyanobacteria, colonial chlorophytes and large diatoms) increased in all mesocosms until day 10, suggesting that they were not actively grazed by zooplankton during this period. However, from day 10 until day 17 this fraction decreased <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>enclosures</b> with mesozooplankton, probably due to an increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> abundance of large herbivores. The results of the experiment would also indicate a trophic cascade effect on the lower levels of <b>the</b> microbial community. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> treatment where zooplankton was removed, the abundance of ciliates followed the same increasing pattern as the abundance of HNF, but with a time lag in its response. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>enclosures</b> without zooplankton, HNF remained relatively constant throughout the experiment, whereas ciliates strongly decrease during the last week. Total picoplankton abundance increased <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>enclosures</b> with mesozooplankton, thus supporting the existence of a four-link trophic cascade (copepods–microzooplankton–HNF–picoplankton).
