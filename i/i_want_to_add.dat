A very brief example of this format might look like this: [...] Story: Returns go to stock [...] As a store owner In order to keep track of stock <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>add</b> items back to stock when they're returned.

40|$|ABSTRACT. This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the literary implications of Judith Butler's views on pornography. Butler chooses to argue againts a restrictive view of the performativity of injurious speech. She notes that pornography charts a domain of unrealizable positions and that the phantasmatic power of signs cannot, strictly speaking, constitute that reality. Butler also contemplates the possibility of a counter-speech, a kind of talking back that would implicate the emergence of an agency. Drawing on Angela Carter's famous theoretical essay on the marquis de Sade, <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>add</b> grist to Butler's mill, but also to suggest that the production of an agency can only be achieved if the talking back has a rhetorical dimension, that only rhetoric can constitute an appropriate tool to fight back the threat of injurious speech. I henceforth suggest that Carter's contentious analysis of Sade as a "moral pornographer " should be best described as a theory of ethical rhetoric. Can pornography be moral? How is the explicit description of sexua...|$|E
40|$|The Chattahoochee River {{begins in}} the Appalachian Mountains in {{northeast}} Georgia, flows through Atlanta, and then turns south to form the Georgia/Alabama state line. There are many dams along the river to help supply power, and many recreational areas. Most importantly, the Chattahoochee River provides 70 % of metropolitan Atlanta’s drinking water. With all of these benefits, we should be protecting the river, but we are not. The water is polluted and gets more polluted the further south you go.
