[...] "Jimmy Jimmy" [...] talks about Madonna's admiration for the neighbourhood bad boy. The Spanish [...] "La Isla Bonita" [...] and [...] "Love Makes the World Go Round" [...] deal with escapism from normal life, with the latter talking about anti-war and anti-poverty and using Latin drums and samba-influenced rhythms. [...] "White Heat" [...] deals with firmness and quotes Clint Eastwood's [...] "Make my day" [...] catchphrase.

500|$|Bowie himself remembered {{almost nothing}} of the album's production, not even the studio, later admitting, [...] "I know it was in LA because I've read it was". The singer {{was not alone in}} his use of cocaine during the sessions, Carlos Alomar commenting, [...] "if there's a line of coke which <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> you awake till 8 a.m. so that you can do your guitar part, you do the line of coke... the coke use is driven by the inspiration." [...] Like Bowie, Earl Slick had {{somewhat}} vague memories of the recording: [...] "That album's a little fuzzy—for the obvious reasons! We were in the studio and it was nuts—a lot of hours, a lot of late nights." ...|$|E
500|$|Kennedy {{made his}} first post-illness public {{appearance}} on July 9, when he surprised the Senate by showing up to supply the added vote to break a Republican filibuster against a bill to preserve Medicare fees for doctors. Though additionally ill from an attack of kidney stones and {{against the advice of}} some associates, Kennedy insisted on appearing during the first night of the 2008 Democratic National Convention on August 25, 2008, where a video tribute to him was played. Introduced by his niece, Caroline Kennedy, the senator said, [...] "It is so wonderful to be here. Nothing– nothing– <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> me away from this special gathering tonight." [...] He then delivered a speech to the delegates (which he had to memorize, as his impaired vision left him unable to read a teleprompter) in which, reminiscent of his speech at the 1980 Democratic National Convention, he said, [...] "this November, the torch will be passed again to a new generation of Americans. So, with Barack Obama and for you and for me, our country will be committed to his cause. The work begins anew. The hope rises again. And the dream lives on." [...] The dramatic appearance and speech electrified the convention audience, as Kennedy vowed that he would be present to see Obama inaugurated.|$|E

6000|$|... "Wonder {{how long}} this <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> last?" [...] came from Whopper, an hour later. [...] "Looks {{to me as if}} it <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> up a long time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You have?" [...] the Capataz de Cargadores {{repeated}} cautiously. [...] "Well, that is wonderful. And {{how long}} do you think you <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> it up?" ...|$|R
500|$|In her 2007 book, It's Not My Fault They Print Them, Catherine Deveny slates Paul and Dennis' acting ability stating: [...] "Stefan Dennis as the mustache-twirling panto villain Paul Robinson, is a genius. I {{just wanted}} to yell out 'He's behind you, he's behind you!' It takes sheer {{brilliance}} {{to be able to}} act that badly". Andrew Mercado, author of Super Aussie Soaps, describes Paul as being very similar to fictional character J. R. Ewing. Paul is referred to in Emily Barr's fictitious novel [...] "Out of My Depth", in which character Amanda is watching Neighbours, with scenes featuring Paul and Gail receiving disapproval from Harold, Amanda opines that she believes the couple are in love. Jaci Stephen writing for the Daily Mail commented on Paul's obsession with Rebecca stating: [...] "You can't help feeling that nothing short of a stake through the heart <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> Paul out of Rebecca's life." [...] Stephen later said [...] "Taking advice from Paul is like asking Charlie Sheen to be your spirit guide." [...] Paul Kalina of The Age said Dennis as Paul lightens things up and he prances about like [...] "a pantomime villain minus the moustache and cape." [...] Kalina added [...] "Erinsborough just would not be the same without him." [...] A TVTimes columnist stated [...] "He's no Brad Pitt and he's a devious beggar at the best of times, but Paul Robinson doesn't half get the ladies." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I am {{glad that}} {{you are not going to}} desert me, then," [...] she said, laughing. [...] "Mr. Morton {{declares}} that he <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> his engagement." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If he <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> to the shore, {{we might}} follow him on foot," [...] {{suggested}} Tom, after several minutes had passed, {{and while the}} rowboat was still clearly in view.|$|E
6000|$|... "I laughed, {{and asked}} him how he <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> this big estate private for our use. 'We want to wander free, you know, {{anywhere}} and everywhere.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> a good {{lookout for}} him in the future," [...] put in Alice. [...] "I don't wish to be scared out of my wits again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sir," [...] {{said the}} {{physician}} harshly, [...] "you appear to know some secrets in this black business. May I {{ask if you}} <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> them <b>to</b> yourself?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> that a secret, {{so as to}} fool our opponents," [...] {{broke in}} Tom. [...] "And he'll fool them all right enough, you can depend on W. P. Tubbs every time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> his dreadful {{secrets to}} himself," [...] cried Tom, mournfully. [...] "Alack! and too bad! But never mind, we'll {{all come to}} the wedding, Tubblets, and bring lemons if you say so?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{are going}} to live in Patty's Place next winter," [...] said Anne triumphantly. [...] "Live, mark you, not board! We've rented it, and Stella Maynard is coming, and her aunt <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> house for us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't {{know the}} money was bad," [...] he said, after a brief time of reflection. [...] "Is {{that the only reason}} why you <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> me here?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course not. Polly <b>is</b> n't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> marry anybody; she <b>'s</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> {{house for}} Will when he 's a minister, I {{heard her say}} so," [...] cried Maud, with importance.|$|R
6000|$|She {{replied in}} the affirmative. [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> 'em," [...] she said, [...] "but I can't get his apple-mill and press. I wish could; it <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> sold, they say." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{answered}} Mrs. Hastings, [...] "there {{is another}} one. Gregory <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> Tom Moran, anyway. Harry has {{one or two}} friends in this neighborhood who feel it more or less of an obligation on them to maintain his credit." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Mrs. Hastings, with a {{trace of}} dryness, [...] "there is another one. Gregory <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> Tom Moran, anyway. Harry has one or two friends in this {{neighbourhood}} who feel it more or less of an obligation on them to maintain his credit." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've {{arranged}} it {{all with}} Jerry," [...] said Ann. [...] "He's {{going to help me}} smuggle Ogden away to that friend of his I told you about who keeps the dog-hospital: and the friend <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> him until he reforms. Isn't it a perfectly splendid idea?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And do you suppose, sir," [...] Mr. Mulready {{asked with}} intense bitterness, [...] "that I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> you here doing nothing all your life, {{while you are}} pleased to watch me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's polite," [...] {{said the}} girl, indignantly. [...] "After giving you your clothes, too. What {{do you think}} my uncle will say <b>to</b> me? He <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> you here till Friday." ...|$|R
5000|$|Now I am {{very happy}} that in the great Confessions of the Christian world, our Confession—the Westminster Confession—has its Chapter 1 on the Word of God. … Now the Lord says, [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> my Word—it <b>is</b> like silver that has been tried. I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> that <b>to</b> all generations, all generations." [...] That means {{that no matter what}} the {{conditions}} <b>are,</b> God <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have on this earth some churches and some pastors until the last generation were taken away who will maintain this Word like we are doing here and like we are seeking to do throughout the whole Christian world.|$|R
6000|$|... "It was {{a present}} from Count Eulenfurst, marshal," [...] Fergus replied. [...] "He sent me two, {{but one of}} them he <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> for me until I return; for I could not part with Rollo, who is as good a horse as anyone can wish to ride; and I know his paces." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{struggle}} for naval supremacy {{is not merely}} a struggle in shipbuilding and expenditure. Much more is it a struggle in knowledge and invention. It is not the Power that has the most ships or the biggest ships that is going to win in a naval conflict. It is the Power that thinks quickest of what to do, is most resourceful and inventive. Eighty Dreadnoughts manned by dull men are only eighty targets for a quicker adversary. Well, {{is there any reason to}} suppose that our Navy <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> above the general national level in these things? Is the Navy bright? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's the housekeeper's grandson, Mr. Rouncewell by name," [...] said, he, [...] "and {{he is in}} {{love with}} a pretty girl up at the house. Lady Dedlock has taken a fancy to the pretty girl and <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> her about her own fair person--an honour which my young friend himself does not at all appreciate. However, he can't marry just yet, even if his Rosebud were willing; so he is fain {{to make the best of}} it. In the meanwhile, he comes here pretty often for a day or two at a time to--fish. Ha ha ha ha!" ...|$|E
60|$|He was now {{alternately}} {{putting his}} hands into his pockets as if he <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> them there a long time, and taking them out again and vehemently rubbing them all over his head.|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps it will {{be better}} to let it go, Sam. I don't want to stir up any more rows than are necessary. But after this I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> my eye on that fellow." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{now look}} here, Tim, you're not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> overdo it," [...] {{said the former}} moving-picture actor, warningly. [...] "If we <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> pull this stunt off you <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> {{perfectly}} sober. It's one drink and no more!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You'll {{have to come}} to Four Winds. It's {{the most}} {{beautiful}} harbor on the Island. There's a little village called Glen St. Mary at its head, and Dr. David Blythe has been practicing there for fifty years. He is Gilbert's great-uncle, you know. He is going to retire, and Gilbert is to take over his practice. Dr. Blythe <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> his house, though, so we shall have to find a habitation for ourselves. I don't know yet what it is, or where it will be in reality, but I have a little house o'dreams all furnished in my imagination--a tiny, delightful castle in Spain." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Look at them!" [...] he muttered. [...] "At last! The tocsin has sounded, and {{the rats}} {{have come out}} of their holes! Half a million and more of scum eating their way into the {{entrails}} of this great city of ours. For years we have tried to make the government see the danger of it. It is our cursed British arrogance which has shut the ears and closed the eyes of the men who govern our destinies. Supposing your invasion should take place, who <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> them in check? The sack of London would be well on its way before ever a German soldier set foot upon our coast." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Esther dear," [...] he said, [...] "I shall do {{just as you}} ask me. At {{the same}} time, please listen. I think that you are all absurdly frightened of Mr. Fentolin. Living here alone with him, you have all grown under his {{dominance}} to an unreasonable extent. Because of his horrible infirmity, you have let yourselves become his slaves. There are limits {{to this sort of}} thing, Esther. I come here as a stranger, and I see nothing more in Mr. Fentolin than a very selfish, irritable, domineering, and capricious old man. Humour him, by all means. I am willing to do the same myself. But {{when it comes to the}} great things in life, neither he nor any living person <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> from me the woman I love." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, you can't fool us, Tubblets," [...] {{whispered the}} fun-loving Rover. [...] "You <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> it a secret, but we read {{all about it}} in the London paper one of the fellows sent over." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, it's not {{the least}} use your looking as though you <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> edge away every moment," [...] she declared, laughing. [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> you {{for quite a long}} time, and make you tell me about everything." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "The game ended, and we won. Then {{it ended}} again, and we won again." [...] Tom Henderson [...] "They <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>going</b> {{until they got}} the outcome they wanted: the Russians winning." [...] Jim Forbes ...|$|R
