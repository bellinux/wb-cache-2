5|$|As in all Norwegian {{national}} parks, motorized {{land transport}} <b>is</b> <b>banned.</b> However, on Svalbard {{this does not}} include snowmobiles. On the other hand, cycling <b>is</b> <b>banned.</b> The Governor can, however, enforce temporary bans on snowmobiles or even all travel within the national park. Use of helicopters and aircraft for sight-seeing are also prohibited. Polar bears are protected, but anyone outside of settlements is required to carry a rifle to kill polar bears in self-defense, as a last resort, should they attack. Most flora and fauna are protected; the right to gather established with the freedom to roam does not apply in national parks, although there are some exceptions. Hunting is permitted after explicit permit from the Governor, and locals have more access to hunting rights than tourists. Fishing is not permitted, although dispensations can be given.|$|E

5|$|The {{product is}} {{regulated}} in different manners in various regions. In the US, {{the product is}} allowed {{to be used in}} ground beef, and it can be used in other meat products such as beef-based processed meats. The use of ammonia as an anti-microbial agent is approved by the Food and Drug Administration, and is included on the FDA's list of GRAS (generally recognized as safe) procedures, and is used in similar applications for numerous other food products, including puddings and baked goods. The product <b>is</b> <b>banned</b> in Canada due to the presence of ammonia in it, and it <b>is</b> <b>banned</b> for human consumption in the European Union. Some consumer advocacy groups have promoted the elimination of the product or for mandatory disclosure of additives in beef, while others have expressed concerns about plant closures that occurred after the product received significant news media coverage.|$|E

5|$|Recreational gold mining {{is popular}} along the Klamath {{and some of}} its tributaries, {{including}} the Salmon and the Trinity.

Common ways to professionally cheat at card games using sleight of hand include palming, switching, ditching, and stealing cards from the table. Such techniques involve extreme misdirection and years of practice. For these reasons, the term sleight of hand frequently carries negative associations of dishonesty and deceit at many gambling halls, and many magicians known {{around the world are}} publicly banned from casinos, such as British mentalist and close-up magician Derren Brown, who <b>is</b> <b>banned</b> from every casino in Britain.|$|E

5|$|Cosmetics {{testing on}} animals <b>is</b> <b>banned</b> in India, the European Union, Israel and Norway while {{legislation}} in the U.S. and Brazil is currently considering similar bans. In 2002, after 13 years of discussion, the European Union agreed to phase in a near-total ban {{on the sale of}} animal-tested cosmetics by 2009, and to ban all cosmetics-related animal testing. France, which is home to the world's largest cosmetics company, L'Oreal, has protested the proposed ban by lodging a case at the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg, asking that the ban be quashed. The ban is also opposed by the European Federation for Cosmetics Ingredients, which represents 70 companies in Switzerland, Belgium, France, Germany, and Italy. In October 2014, India passed stricter laws that also ban the importation of any cosmetic products that are tested on animals.|$|E
5|$|In some countries, YouTube is {{completely}} blocked, either {{through a long}} term standing ban or for more limited periods of time such as during periods of unrest, the run-up to an election, or in response to upcoming political anniversaries. In other countries access to the website as a whole remains open, but access to specific videos is blocked. In cases where the entire site <b>is</b> <b>banned</b> due to one particular video, YouTube will often agree to remove or limit access to that video in order to restore service. Businesses, schools, government agencies, and other private institutions often block social media sites, including YouTube, due to bandwidth limitations and the site's potential for distraction.|$|E
5|$|Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) asks Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) to {{accompany}} him to the Six Sigmas Retreat in Croton-on-Hudson, New York, following his Bush administration and CEO debacles. There, Jack meets with the Six Sigmas, six men who each embody a core feature of Six Sigma: teamwork, insight, brutality, male enhancement, hand-shake-fulness and play-hard. They disapprove of Liz's antics during the team building exercises and demand that Jack distance himself from her {{if he wants to}} succeed, which he does. Before his dinner speech, Jack psyches himself up in the men's room, completely forgetting that he is wearing a microphone and that everyone can hear him. Liz quickly takes the stage to draw attention away from Jack's embarrassment and finally ends up ripping her blouse open and dancing in front of everyone. She succeeds, and <b>is</b> <b>banned</b> from the retreat forever.|$|E
50|$|In many {{countries}} political parties or groups <b>are</b> <b>banned.</b> Parties may <b>be</b> <b>banned</b> for many reasons, including extremism and anti-democratic ideologies, on ethnic or religious grounds, and sometimes {{simply because the}} group opposes government policies, with the ban sometimes alleging wrongdoing as the cause. Germany, for instance, {{has a long history}} behind its modern practice of banning political parties. The Nazi Party <b>was</b> <b>banned</b> in 1923; after the Nazi Party came into power in 1933 opposing parties such as the Social Democrats and Communist Party <b>were</b> <b>banned,</b> the Nazi Party <b>was</b> again <b>banned</b> and the ban on other parties lifted after the Nazi defeat in 1945, and the Communist Party <b>was</b> again <b>banned</b> from 1956 to 1968.|$|R

This was {{due in part to}} comments that Dosanjh had made after the parade in 2007, suggesting a police investigation into reports of a parade float that had a picture of Talwinder Singh Parmar on it, the alleged mastermind behind the bombing of Air India Flight 182. Dosanjh also expressed concerns over some attendees wearing International Sikh Youth Federation T-shirts, a terrorist organization that <b>is</b> <b>banned</b> in India, Britain, the United States, and Canada.|$|E
5|$|Testing of {{cosmetic}} products on animals <b>is</b> <b>banned</b> in {{the member states}} of the European Community, although France protested the ban and has made efforts to have it lifted.

When testing toxicity of food additives, food contaminants, and some drugs and chemicals the FDA uses beagles and miniature pigs as surrogates for direct human testing. Minnesota was {{the first state to}} enact a Beagle freedom adoption law in 2014, mandating that dogs and cats are allowed to be adopted once they have completed with research testing.|$|E
