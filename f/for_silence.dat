5|$|The {{pre-production}} {{phase of}} the filmmaking <b>for</b> <b>Silence</b> went through a cycle of over two decades of set-backs and reassessments. After filming of The Wolf of Wall Street concluded in January 2013, Scorsese refused to follow it up with any film other than Silence. On April 19, 2013, Scorsese indicated that he would begin production on Silence in 2014. Irwin Winkler was then announced as a producer, as were Randall Emmett and George Furla, who would provide financing through their company Emmett/Furla Films. Soon thereafter, planning was made for the film to be shot in Taiwan.|$|E
5|$|Burnett and Loco stop by {{a frozen}} lake to allow Loco to relieve himself, but he springs a trap, {{shooting}} the ice surrounding Burnett and leaving {{him to die}} in the freezing water. Loco rides to his hideout and convinces the rest of his gang to confront Silence. Determined to take Pauline by force, Pollicut attempts to rape her as his henchman, Martin, tortures Silence by burning his right hand. Silence overpowers Martin and kills Pollicut. Loco and his gang arrive to look <b>for</b> <b>Silence,</b> just as the outlaws appear {{at the edge of town}} to collect the provisions, having been previously advised to do so by Burnett. Deciding to use them to draw out Silence, the gang herds the bandits into the saloon and captures Pauline. Loco tells Pauline to have Silence duel with him – if Silence wins, the outlaws will be set free; if he wins, they will be killed.|$|E

5|$|In 2009, {{with the}} {{production}} beginning to coalesce, Scorsese and a production crew went to Nagasaki, Japan, visiting the original sites {{that served as the}} setting for Endō's novel. Additional location scouting was conducted in Canada. However, Silence entered a state of development hell soon afterwards, and Scorsese decided to work on Shutter Island and Hugo instead. In December 2011, Scorsese stated that Silence would be his next film. By March, although he originally put it on the back burner and consequently dropped out, Scorsese signed back on to The Wolf of Wall Street and opted to direct it ahead of Silence. However, at the time, Scorsese's publicist stated that Silence would come first. In May, the film picked up another producer in the recently revived Cecchi Gori Pictures, which placed the project first on its slate of upcoming films. Cecchi Gori was involved in pre-production <b>for</b> <b>Silence,</b> but years of unrelated legal disputes had interrupted its association to the film.|$|E

40|$|Origin {{recognition}} complex (ORC) is a six {{subunit complex}} that functions as the replication initiator and is required <b>for</b> <b>silencing</b> the HML and HMR loci in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The roles of ORC 5 in replication initiation and silencing were investigated {{to determine whether}} the two roles were mechanistically coincident or separable. Some spontaneous revertants of orc 5 - 1 were functional for replication initiation, but not silencing. Other alleles of ORC 5 were obtained that were nonfunctional for replication initiation, but fully competent <b>for</b> <b>silencing.</b> The two types of alleles, when put in the same cell, complemented, establishing two separable functions for ORC 5. These data implied that replication initiation at HMR-E was not required <b>for</b> <b>silencing.</b> The data were consistent with a model in which different ORC species functioned at different origins within the genome and that only one Orc 5 p subunit functioned at any given origin...|$|R
40|$|The Set 1 -containing complex, COMPASS, methylates histone H 3 on lysine 4 (K 4) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Despite the {{preferential}} {{association of}} K 4 -trimethylated H 3 with {{regions of the}} genome that are transcribed by RNA polymerase II, transcriptional silencing {{is one of the}} few cases in S. cerevisiae where histone-methylation defects have a clear effect on gene expression. To better understand the role of COMPASS in transcriptional silencing, we have determined which members of COMPASS are required <b>for</b> <b>silencing</b> at the ribosomal DNA locus (rDNA), a telomere, and the silent mating loci (HM) using Northern analyses. Our findings indicate that most members of COMPASS are required <b>for</b> <b>silencing</b> at the rDNA and telomere, while none are required <b>for</b> <b>silencing</b> of endogenous genes at the HM loci. To complement gene-expression analysis, quantitative Western blot experiments were performed to determine the members of COMPASS that are required for methylation of histone H 3. While most are required for trimethylation, cells lacking certain COMPASS proteins maintain reduced levels of K 4 mono- and dimethylated H 3, suggesting that some COMPASS members have redundant function. Finally, we show Paf 1 is required <b>for</b> <b>silencing</b> and K 4 -methylated H 3 at the rDNA, suggesting a possible direct role for K 4 -methylated H 3 in gene silencing...|$|R

25|$|While many accipitrids are {{not known}} for their strong voices, golden eagles have a {{particular}} tendency <b>for</b> <b>silence,</b> even while breeding. Some vocalization, however, has been recorded, and these normally are centering on the nesting period. The voice of the golden eagle is considered weak, high and shrill, even being emphatically described as “quite pathetic” and “puppy-like”, and as somewhat incongruous considering the formidable size {{and nature of the}} species. Most known vocalizations seem to function as contact calls between eagles, sometimes adults to their offspring, occasionally territorial birds to intruders and rarely between a breeding pair. In Western Montana, nine distinct calls were noted: a chirp, a seeir, a pssa, a skonk, a cluck, a wonk, a honk and a hiss.|$|E

A shaft was dug well back in the defensive system and then a gallery was driven forward, with branch galleries dug at intervals. As the main gallery got close to German defences, the need <b>for</b> <b>silence</b> became paramount, to elude the Germans conducting a similar mining operation. Plans of the mine workings were kept, on which rival German works were plotted, based on mines already sprung and the reports of listeners.|$|E

25|$|Outside the Group, Metheny {{has shown}} {{different}} {{sides of his}} musical personality. He made the album Orchestrion (Nonesuch, 2010) with elaborate, custom mechanical instruments, allowing one person to compose and perform as a one-person orchestra. By contrast, his album Secret Story (Geffen, 1992) used orchestral arrangements found more often in movie soundtracks, such as his own The Falcon and the Snowman (EMI, 1985) and A Map of the World (Warner Bros., 1999). His solo acoustic guitar albums include New Chautauqua (ECM, 1979), One Quiet Night (Warner Bros., 2003), and What's It All About (Nonesuch, 2011). He explored {{the fringes of the}} avant-garde on Zero Tolerance <b>for</b> <b>Silence</b> (Geffen, 1994). This, too, was an album of solo guitar, but it was electric guitar, and to many fans and critics it was simply noise. Metheny had ventured into the avant-garde before on 80/81 (ECM, 1980), Song X (Geffen, 1986) with Ornette Coleman, and The Sign of Four with Derek Bailey (Knitting Factory, 1997). He recorded a more mainstream guitar duet with Jim Hall (Telarc, 1999), whose work has strongly influenced Metheny's. He collaborated with Polish folk singer Anna Maria Jopek on Upojenie (Warner Poland, 2002) and Bruce Hornsby on Hot House (RCA, 2005).|$|E

500|$|After La musica's final request <b>for</b> <b>silence,</b> {{the curtain}} rises on act 1 {{to reveal a}} {{pastoral}} scene. Orfeo and Euridice enter together with a chorus of nymphs and shepherds, who act {{in the manner of}} a Greek chorus, commenting on the action both as a group and as individuals. A shepherd announces that this is the couple's wedding day; the chorus responds, first in a stately invocation ("Come, Hymen, O come") and then in a joyful dance ("Leave the mountains, leave the fountains"). Orfeo and Euridice sing of their love for each other before leaving with most of the group for the wedding ceremony in the temple. Those left on stage sing a brief chorus, commenting on how Orfeo used to be one [...] "for whom sighs were food and weeping was drink" [...] before love brought him to a state of sublime happiness.|$|E
500|$|Singing can cease and restart suddenly, either rarely or frequently, {{and often}} ends abruptly. The song has been {{described}} as [...] "Tar-ran-tar-rar-tar-ran-tar-rar", [...] and consists of a series of pulses emitted at a rate of 240–250 a second. The tymbal covers are much larger than other species and also make the call louder and send it in a particular direction. There are two distinct phases of song, which the double drummer switches between at irregular intervals. One phase is a continuous call that can last for several minutes; during this period the frequency varies between 5.5–6.2kHz and 6.0–7.5kHz 4–6 times a second. In the other phase, the song is interrupted by breaks of increasing frequency resulting in a staccato sound. These breaks can be mistaken <b>for</b> <b>silence</b> as the difference in volume is so great, though the song actually continues at a much lower volume. During this staccato phase, which lasts for several seconds, the frequency remains around 5.75–6.5kHz. The frequency of the song is a high harmonic of the pulse repetition frequency, which makes for a particularly ringing sound. Double drummers congregate in groups to amplify their calls, which likely drives off potential bird predators.|$|E
500|$|The {{first draft}} {{libretto}} that Illica produced for Puccini resurfaced in 2000 after being lost for many years. It contains considerable differences {{from the final}} libretto, relatively minor {{in the first two}} acts but much more appreciable in the third, where the description of the Roman dawn that opens the third act is much longer, and Cavaradossi's tragic aria, the eventual [...] "E lucevan le stelle", has different words. The 1896 libretto also offers a different ending, in which Tosca does not die but instead goes mad. In the final scene, she cradles her lover's head in her lap and hallucinates that she and her Mario are on a gondola, and that she is asking the gondolier <b>for</b> <b>silence.</b> Sardou refused to consider this change, insisting that as in the play, Tosca must throw herself from the parapet to her death. Puccini agreed with Sardou, telling him that the mad scene would have the audiences anticipate the ending and start moving towards the cloakrooms. Puccini pressed his librettists hard, and Giacosa issued a series of melodramatic threats to abandon the work. The two librettists were finally able to give Puccini what they hoped was a final version of the libretto in 1898.|$|E
