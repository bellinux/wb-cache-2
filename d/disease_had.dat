5|$|After the {{assassination}} of the King at the Stockholm opera in 1792, support for the liberal arts was withdrawn. Bellman, already in poor health from alcoholism, went into decline, drinking increasingly heavily. His drinking very likely contributed to his gout, which troubled him badly in 1790. He also caught tuberculosis: the <b>disease</b> <b>had</b> already killed his mother, and by the winter of 1792, he was seriously ill.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, Ryan White spoke {{before the}} President's Commission on the AIDS Epidemic.

40|$|Patterns {{of sexually}} {{transmitted}} <b>diseases</b> <b>have</b> changed, but the incidence has not decreased. The commonest STD (nonspecific urethritis) {{has only recently}} become reportable. The ratio of gonorrhea to NSU has reversed. Common childhood <b>diseases</b> <b>have</b> now become sexually transmitted diseases, for example, molluscum contagiosum and warts. Some venereal <b>diseases</b> <b>have</b> become less virulent, but acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) is almost uniformly fatal. Most infectious enteric <b>diseases</b> <b>have</b> now become sexually transmitted diseases. The key to eradicating STD is intelligent and persistent public health personnel. Some STD are multisystem diseases; {{a broad range of}} interested consultants will be useful to the family physician...|$|R

5|$|In {{the early}} years of the 21st century {{epizootics}} in livestock caused by viruses continue to have serious consequences. Bluetongue disease, a disease caused by an orbivirus broke out in sheep in France in 2007.

5|$|Although {{societal}} {{awareness of}} AIDS had developed {{at a slower}} pace in Canada than in the United States, films regarding the <b>disease</b> <b>had</b> appeared nearly concurrently: both the first Canadian documentary and the first American feature-length film on the subject, Nik Sheehan's No Sad Songs and John Erman's An Early Frost respectively, were released in 1985. However, the majority of the early gay artists with AIDS had died by the time Hoolboom made Frank's Cock; as such, the film scholar Thomas Waugh considers Hoolboom a second-generation figurehead in AIDS activism and one of the earliest not coming from the gay community.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 19th century, as salvage {{operations}} became deeper and longer, an unexplained malady began afflicting the divers; they would suffer breathing difficulties, dizziness, joint pain and paralysis, sometimes leading to death. The problem was already well known among workers building tunnels and bridge footings operating under pressure in caissons and was initially called caisson disease; {{it was later}} renamed the bends because the joint pain typically caused the sufferer to stoop. Early reports of the <b>disease</b> <b>had</b> been made {{at the time of}} Charles Pasley's salvage operation, but scientists were still ignorant of its causes.|$|E
50|$|Aleutian <b>disease</b> <b>has</b> {{also more}} {{currently}} been found among free range mink throughout Europe and North America. It is {{speculated that the}} <b>disease</b> <b>has</b> been transferred from farmed mink {{to those in the}} wild. This is most commonly due to escapees within farms, who when free are hybridizing with wild mink. There are different strains of this <b>disease</b> which <b>have</b> been documented.|$|R

5|$|By {{the middle}} of the 20th century, heart <b>disease</b> <b>had</b> surpassed {{infectious}} disease as {{the leading cause of death}} in the United States, and it is currently the leading cause of deaths worldwide. Since 1948, the ongoing Framingham Heart Study has shed light on the effects of various influences on the heart, including diet, exercise, and common medications such as aspirin. Although the introduction of ACE inhibitors and beta blockers has improved the management of chronic heart failure, the disease continues to be an enormous medical and societal burden, with 30 to 40% of patients dying within a year of receiving the diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|For centuries, {{tracheotomy}} {{was considered}} the only reliable method for intubation of the trachea. However, because {{only a minority of}} patients survived the operation, physicians undertook tracheotomy only as a last resort, on patients who were nearly dead. It was not until the late 19th century however that advances in understanding of anatomy and physiology, as well an appreciation of the germ theory of <b>disease,</b> <b>had</b> improved the outcome of this operation {{to the point that it}} could be considered an acceptable treatment option. Also at that time, advances in endoscopic instrumentation had improved to such a degree that direct laryngoscopy had become a viable means to secure the airway by the non-surgical orotracheal route. By the mid-20th century, the tracheotomy as well as endoscopy and non-surgical tracheal intubation had evolved from rarely employed procedures to becoming essential components of the practices of anesthesiology, critical care medicine, emergency medicine, and laryngology.|$|E
5|$|LeHand {{was born}} in Potsdam, New York, to DanielJ. and MaryJ. (née Graffin) LeHand, who were the {{children}} of Irish immigrants. The parents began their family at age 16 with a son, also called Daniel, followed by Bernard, Anna and finally Marguerite, {{when they were in}} their 40s. When she was a young child, the family relocated to Somerville, a working class suburb of Boston, where LeHand was struck by rheumatic fever at age fifteen. It permanently damaged her heart, causing episodes of atrial fibrillation and leading to her premature death. Eleanor Roosevelt later stated that the <b>disease</b> <b>had</b> left her delicate and barred from strenuous exercise. She graduated from Somerville High School in 1917, where she took secretarial courses in preparation for a career. Although she never attended college, in 1937 Rosary College (now called Dominican University) recognized her professional achievements with an honorary Doctor of Laws, presented at the White House.|$|E

5|$|Whirling {{disease was}} first {{detected}} in fish in Johnson Lake in Banff National Park in May, 2016. CFIA Labs confirmed in August and Parks Canada announced the outbreak August 23, 2016. Although {{it was first}} discovered in Banff, {{it is not necessarily}} where the disease originated and spread. The Government of Alberta is currently sampling and testing fish in 6 different watersheds (Peace River, Athabasca, North Saskatchewan, Red Deer, Bow and Oldman) to see where the disease has spread. Initial sample fish were collected in 2016, and are currently being processed by the Government of Alberta and CFIA labs. Since testing began, it has been detected in the Upper Bow River, and in May 2017 it was confirmed that whirling <b>disease</b> <b>had</b> also been detected in the Oldman River Basin. The declaration does not mean that every susceptible finfish population within the Bow and Oldman River watersheds are infected with the disease.|$|E
5|$|Diseases {{introduced}} to the Americas by the conquistadors had a great impact upon indigenous populations. As the Spanish were occupied with the conquest of Mexico, these diseases ran ahead of them from 1519 onwards. A smallpox epidemic swept through Guatemala in 1520–1521, and {{is also likely to}} have spread throughout the Pipil region of El Salvador. By the time the Spanish arrived in the area in 1524, it is estimated that up to 50% of the native population of El Salvador had already been eliminated by the new diseases, against which they had no immunity. It is likely that <b>disease</b> <b>had</b> significantly weakened the Pipil by the time they fielded large armies against the Spanish at Acajutla and Tacuzcalco. Further waves of epidemic diseases spread across Mesoamerica in 1545–1548, and again in 1576–1581, reducing indigenous populations to just 10% of their pre-contact levels, making successful resistance against the European colonisers extremely difficult. The deadliest of the newly introduced diseases were smallpox, malaria, measles, typhus, and yellow fever. Their introduction was catastrophic in the Americas; it is estimated that 90% of the indigenous population had been eliminated by disease within the first century of European contact.|$|E
