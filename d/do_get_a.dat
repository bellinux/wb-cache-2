However, there is no direct rail link between the SIR and the subway system proper. SIR riders <b>do</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> free transfer to New York City Subway lines, and the line is included on official New York City Subway maps. Commuters who use the railway typically use the Staten Island Ferry to reach Manhattan; the line is accessible from within the Ferry Terminal and most of its trains connect with the ferry.|$|E

500|$|The {{production}} {{on the album}} was mainly handled by Easy Mo Bee and The Hitmen. Cheo H. Coker of Rolling Stone depicted the beats as [...] "heavy bottomed and slick, but B.I.G.'s rhymes are the showstoppers. The tracks only enhance them, whether it's the live bass driving a menacing undercurrent or [...] use of bluesy guitar and wah-wah feedback" [...] and that the production is used to [...] "push the rapper to new heights." [...] The production is mainly sample-based with the samples varying from the percussion of funk tracks to the vocals of hip hop songs. Steve Huey presented some criticism over the beats, stating that the [...] "deliberate beats <b>do</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> little samey, but it hardly matters: this is Biggie's show".|$|E

500|$|With {{his career}} on hold, Hunt {{continued}} recording new songs and demos, posting {{them on his}} MySpace page, while Popular gained exposure among listeners through online music sharing. In 2009, he released the compilation album Use in Case of Emergency as a free download through his website. It featured previously unreleased material recorded by Hunt prior to Popular. He also continued touring, worked on an autobiographical book of short stories, entitled Tales of Friction, and studied classical piano. Hunt also took up photography after his girlfriend purchased him a camera. He started {{out on the streets}} of Los Angeles, where he photographed subjects on street corners and discarded objects, including furniture and numerous couches he found abandoned on the streets. In an interview for PopMatters, he explained how his photographying of people there inspired him: [...] "It's sad as you can quite imagine. It's also kind of welcoming to me. Sometimes I <b>do</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> chance to talk to them and hear a bit of their story. I'm not the only one out here who had an idea of trying to make it happen. Some of us are luckier than others. Some of us are more prepared than others. That's just the truth of the situation." [...] Along with photography, he was stimulated creatively after reading Legs McNeil's 1997 book Please Kill Me: The Uncensored Oral History of Punk and relating to its themes of artistic frustration and rebelliousness.|$|E
500|$|All Hope Is Gone was {{generally}} well received by critics. Several music critics anticipated the album {{immediately after the}} release of Vol. 3: (The Subliminal Verses). In its review of Vol. 3, Allmusic stated, [...] "There's a sense that whatever Slipknot do next might be their ultimate broadcast to the faithful." [...] Copies of All Hope Is Gone intended for reviewers were pressed under the false name [...] "Rusty Cage" [...] {{to reduce the risk of}} the album leaking onto the Internet. Stephen Erlewine wrote in his review for Allmusic that the early [...] "cluster of cacophony" [...] of [...] "Gematria" [...] is [...] "so effective [...] that when things <b>do</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> little softer a little later on, the album threatens to collapse like a souffl√©" [...] and opined that [...] "one more power ballad like Snuff would be enough to derail the album.". He gave the album a rating of four out of five stars. Regarding the album's creation process, Darren Sadler of Rock Sound wrote, [...] "Slipknot raised their collective middle fingers, and created an album that stands out head and shoulders above everything else that will be released this year." [...] He compared the album's sound to those of other bands such as Stone Sour, Morbid Angel, and Meshuggah, and he gave the album a score of 9 out of 10. Ryan Ogle of Blabbermouth.net gave All Hope Is Gone 7.5 out of 10 stars. Ogle stated that the fans' views of the [...] "diversity" [...] of the album would be Slipknot's [...] "saving grace, or their misfortune", concluding, [...] "While it may not be as jaw-dropping or revolutionary as some might have hoped, it's by no means a bad release." [...] Reviewing for Blender, writer Darren Ratner observed a different theme in the lyrics when compared to previous Slipknot albums, noting that the band is able to [...] "make ugliness sound just a little bit pretty". Marc Weingarten of Entertainment Weekly gave the album a B+ rating, calling All Hope Is Gone [...] "a metal assault-and-battery on the hypocrisies of the modern world". Jim Kaz of IGN stated that the band's attempt to move from nu-metal to [...] "more classic metal elements" [...] was [...] "the best career move they could've made". Kaz gave All Hope Is Gone a score of 8.1 out of 10, writing, [...] " [...] effectively [...] upon the band's collective strengths." [...] Q noted that the band no longer resembled [...] "a threat to Western civilisation" [...] but claimed that the album delivered one shock; [...] "how listenable they've become", including [...] "Snuff" [...] in the top 50 downloads for August 2008.|$|E
2500|$|As {{part of the}} Delivering Quality First {{proposals}} {{submitted by}} the BBC in October 2011 {{and approved by the}} BBC Trust in May 2012, all children's programming on BBC One and Two would be moved permanently to the CBBC and CBeebies channels following the digital switchover. It was found that the majority of child viewers watched the programmes on these channels already and that only 7% of these children watched CBBC programmes on BBC One and Two only, it was made clear [...] "Children's programmes are absolutely fundamental to the BBC and that is why we have protected investment in them in the light of cuts elsewhere." [...] Children's programming on BBC One ended on 21 December 2012. The move was criticised by Teletubbies co-creator Anne Wood, who described the changes as [...] "ghettoising children's programmes" [...] and believe it was merely a cost-cutting measure. Wood said [...] "On the one hand it is inevitable. But it is dismissive of children. There {{is a certain amount of}} overlooking of the fact that children's programmes <b>do</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> wider audience than people are aware of... I have frequently had letters from older people who have enjoyed my programmes as much as children do. A lot of the reason older people like to watch children's programming is because it is life-enhancing." [...] Head of BBC Children's, Joe Godwin said: [...] "Our young viewers are our priority and the vast majority of children in the UK already tune in to CBeebies and CBBC to find their favourite BBC children's programmes. Far from being a 'cynical' move, we're just following where our audience has already gone." ...|$|E
