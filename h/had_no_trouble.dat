5|$|After {{becoming}} pregnant once, Catherine <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>trouble</b> {{doing so}} again. She may have owed her change of fortune to the physician Jean Fernel, who had noticed slight abnormalities in the couple's sexual organs and advised {{them how to}} solve the problem. Catherine quickly conceived again and on 2 April 1545 she bore a daughter, Elisabeth. She went on to bear Henry a further eight children, six of whom survived infancy, including the future Charles IX (born 27 June 1550); the future Henry III (born 19 September 1551); and Francis, Duke of Anjou (born 18 March 1555). The long-term future of the Valois dynasty, which had ruled France since the 14th century, seemed assured.|$|E
5|$|The Beatles arrived {{very early}} in the morning of 17 August 1960, but <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>trouble</b> finding the St. Pauli area of Hamburg, as it was so infamous. Unfortunately the Indra Club (64 Grosse Freiheit) was closed, so a manager from a {{neighbouring}} club found someone to open it up, and the group slept on the red leather seats in the alcoves. The group played at the club on the same night, but were told they could sleep in a small cinema's storeroom, which was cold and in very poor condition, the Bambi Kino (33 Paul-Roosen Strasse).|$|E
5|$|From 1210 on, Michael I Komnenos Doukas {{was engaged}} in a {{campaign}} of expansion, chiefly {{at the expense of}} the Latin Kingdom of Thessalonica to his east; after initial reverses, much of Thessaly was conquered. By 1214, Dyrrhachium and Corfu had been recovered from the Latins as well. The traditional view of historians is that these events marked Michael I's repudiation of the allegiance he had sworn to the Latin Empire, but historian Philip Van Tricht argues that both Michael and later Theodore remained, at least in theory, vassals of the Latin Empire until 1217. Michael was assassinated by a servant in late 1214 or in 1215. As Michael II was illegitimate and too young, Theodore <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>trouble</b> in sidelining the boy. According to the hagiography of St. Theodora of Arta, the boy and his mother spent the duration of his reign exiled in the Peloponnese.|$|E

5|$|Majungasaurus was {{the largest}} {{predator}} in its environment, while the only known large herbivores {{at the time were}} sauropods like Rapetosaurus. Scientists have suggested that Majungasaurus, and perhaps other abelisaurids, specialized on hunting sauropods. Adaptations to strengthen the head and neck for a bite-and-hold type of attack might have been very useful against sauropods, which would have been tremendously powerful animals. This hypothesis may also be supported by the hindlegs of Majungasaurus, which were short and stocky, as opposed to the longer and more slender legs of most other theropods. While Majungasaurus would not have moved as fast as other similar-sized theropods, it would have <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>trouble</b> keeping up with slow-moving sauropods. The robust hindlimb bones suggest very powerful legs, and their shorter length would have lowered the animal's center of gravity. Thus Majungasaurus may have sacrificed speed for power. Majungasaurus tooth marks on Rapetosaurus bones confirm that it at least fed on these sauropods, whether or not it actually killed them.|$|E
5|$|Their goal in Laos {{seemingly}} achieved, President Thieu and General Lãm {{ordered a}} withdrawal of ARVN forces beginning on 9 March {{that was to}} continue {{through the rest of}} the month, destroying Base Area 604 and any supplies discovered in their path. General Abrams implored Thieu to reinforce the troops in Laos and that they keep disrupting the area until the beginning of the rainy season. The battle was shifting to Hanoi's advantage. Anti-aircraft fire remained devastating and the PAVN <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>trouble</b> resupplying or reinforcing their troops in the battle area. As soon as it became evident that ARVN forces had begun a withdrawal, the PAVN increased its efforts to destroy these force before they could reach South Vietnam. Anti-aircraft fire was increased to halt or slow helicopter resupply or evacuation efforts, the undermanned firebases were attacked, and ARVN ground forces had to run a gauntlet of ambushes along Route 9.|$|E
5|$|With {{his goal}} tally nearly {{reaching}} 40 goals after spending two full seasons in Sporting's main team, Villa got his chance in Spain's top-flight when Sporting were in financial difficulty – newly promoted Real Zaragoza signed him for approximately €3million {{in the summer}} of 2003. The striker <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>trouble</b> adapting to playing at the higher level, netting 17 times in his first season at Zaragoza. His league debut came during Zaragoza's first La Liga game since his arrival, where the team were defeated 1–0 away by Galician side Deportivo de La Coruña while his first goal came two games later, an eighth-minute goal against Real Murcia which put Zaragoza 2–0 up in a match which ended 3–0. 4 December 2003 saw him net his first brace (two goals) in a 2–2 draw against Athletic Bilbao and on 25 April 2004, he scored his first hat-trick in a tight 4–4 draw against Sevilla which saw Villa score all four of Zaragoza's goals, putting his team ahead on two occasions.|$|E

5|$|Hitting a {{consistent}} goalscoring form during mid-season, Villa scored against Deportivo La Coruña, {{although he was}} sent off during the match after his second yellow card, received due to a foul on Daniel Aranzubia; as a result, he missed Valencia's next match against Real Valladolid, a game Valencia lost 2–1 at home. Ready to return from suspension, Villa suffered from an inflammation in the joint in his left knee due to a partial dislocation and would be ruled out for the next 15 days, missing games against Numancia, Recreativo de Huelva and Racing de Santander. When he finally returned from injury on 5 April 2009, he <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>trouble</b> recovering form, netting a brace in a match against Getafe which Valencia won 4–1. On 12 April, Villa was set to return to El Molinón, the home ground of Sporting de Gijón where he started his career. He admitted that the encounter would be very emotional for him but went on to score the second Valencia goal in a 3–2 win and kept a pre-match promise by not celebrating the goal. His goal against Villarreal brought his tally to 26, and he then scored another two against Athletic Bilbao, finishing with 28 goals after the last game of the season, thus equalling records set by the Argentinian Mario Kempes and the Montenegrin Predrag Mijatović, who also scored 28 goals in a Valencia shirt in 1978 and 1996, respectively. Kempes reached his tally of 28 goals in 34 games while Mijatović achieved it in 40, ultimately seeing Villa beat their percentages, as he achieved the 28 goals in 33 games, recording a goal ratio of 0.84 goals per game. That season saw Villa's best goal-scoring season at Valencia.|$|E
25|$|The Third Test at Adelaide {{finally saw}} Australia on top, but Border {{declared}} their innings on 514/5 with Matthews on 73 not out and Waugh on 79 not out after complaining about their slow scoring rate. In any case England <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>trouble</b> drawing the match on a slow, flat wicket, though Matthews did bowl the England captain Mike Gatting {{for a first}} ball duck.|$|E
25|$|Finally, Bayinnaung {{was able}} to marshal more {{manpower}} than any ruler in the region. He required every new conquered state to provide conscripts for his next campaign. Using both larger forces and superior firearms, he <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>trouble</b> reducing Manipur and the entire Shan world to tributary status. His larger forces and their greater fighting experience {{proved to be the}} difference against Siam, which too was a wealthy coastal power with a powerful well-equipped military.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{the success}} of Rand's 1943 novel The Fountainhead, she <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>trouble</b> {{attracting}} a publisher for Atlas Shrugged. This was a contrast to her previous novels, which she had struggled to place. Even before she began writing it, she had been approached by publishers interested in her next novel. However, her contract for The Fountainhead gave the first option to its publisher, Bobbs-Merrill Company. After reviewing a partial manuscript, they asked her to discuss a number of cuts and other changes. She refused, and Bobbs-Merrill rejected the book.|$|E
25|$|In 1973, {{approximately}} 2000 students {{auditioned for}} 20 {{places in the}} freshman class at Juilliard. Reeve's audition {{was in front of}} 10 faculty members, including John Houseman, who had just won an Academy Award for The Paper Chase. Reeve and Robin Williams were the only students selected for Juilliard's Advanced Program. They had several classes together in which they were the only students. In their dialects class with Edith Skinner, Williams <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>trouble</b> mastering all dialects naturally, whereas Reeve was more meticulous about it. Williams and Reeve developed a close friendship.|$|E
25|$|Jacob Johnson {{saved the}} lives of Colonel Thomas Henderson, the young editor of the Raleigh Star, and his friend Mr. Callum, when the {{enthusiastic}} group of fishermen capsized their fishing skiff on Walnut Creek near Hunter's Mill in December 1811. The third occupant of the skiff, Mr. William Peace, <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>trouble</b> getting to shore. Johnson jumped {{in the water and}} saved Henderson and Callum, to the detriment of his own health. He died several weeks later, ironically, while ringing the funeral bell at the State Capitol Building. He was buried at the Old City Cemetery in Raleigh, North Carolina.|$|E

In the 3rd Round, Russ Smith scored 27 points as Louisville crushed Colorado State 82-56. In the Sweet 16, Russ Smith scored 31 points to beat Oregon 77-69 for a trip to the Elite Eight.

Dodd left Little Rock the next day. As he left Union territory, the guard tore up Dodd's pass since {{he would no longer}} need it now that he was in Confederate land. He went to spend the night with his uncle, Washington Dodd, on the Middle Hot Springs Road southwest of Little Rock. The next day Dodd traveled through the woods and found himself back behind Union lines.|$|E
25|$|A year {{afterwards}} his situation, {{which had}} {{for some time}} been decidedly flourishing, showed signs of changing {{very much for the}} worse. The duchess of Orléans died, and he apparently had to give up his rangership, probably selling it to pay debts. But there was always a providence for La Fontaine. Madame de la Sablière, a woman of great beauty, of considerable intellectual power and of high character, invited him to make his home in her house, where he lived for some twenty years. He seems to have <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>trouble</b> whatever about his affairs thenceforward; and could devote himself to his two different lines of poetry, as well as to that of theatrical composition.|$|E

25|$|The BC Express was {{launched}} on the 24th of June and Captain Bucey took {{her up to}} Fort George on the 29th. He was so impressed by how well she handled in the Cottonwood and Fort George canyons that he took her up to the Grand Canyon the following week, where she <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>trouble</b> at all steaming over its infamous and deadly whirlpool. She continued to make trips between the Grand Canyon and Fort George until that September when the water levels dropped so low that Bucey decided that the Giscome Rapids were too unsafe to navigate. In October the water levels rose again and she made several trips between Fort George and Soda Creek before the season ended.|$|E
25|$|When Johnson {{arrived in}} a new town, he would play for tips on street corners or {{in front of the}} local barbershop or a restaurant. Musical {{associates}} have said that in live performances Johnson often did not focus on his dark and complex original compositions, but instead pleased audiences by performing more well-known pop standards of the day– and not necessarily blues. With an ability to pick up tunes at first hearing, he <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>trouble</b> giving his audiences what they wanted, and certain of his contemporaries later remarked on his interest in jazz and country music. He also had an uncanny ability to establish a rapport with his audience; in every town in which he stopped, he would establish ties to the local community that would serve him well when he passed through again a month or a year later.|$|E
25|$|Hamilton on his newer tyres {{was rapidly}} gaining on Alonso and Vettel {{at the front}} at over a second a lap. As the race entered the latter stages, the tyres of Alonso and Vettel began to totally wear out, and their lap times now dropped by 3 seconds a lap. Hamilton passed Vettel on lap 62, and Alonso two laps later to take the lead, but the tyres of the latter two were so worn that they were {{vulnerable}} {{to the rest of}} the field. Vettel decided to stop for new tyres on lap 64 and rejoined fifth behind Grosjean and Pérez, who had broken away from the battle between Rosberg, Webber and Räikkönen. Alonso decided to stay out on his totally worn tyres and was passed by Grosjean on lap 66, Pérez one lap later, and a charging Vettel on the penultmate lap. Lewis Hamilton <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>trouble</b> reeling off the last 6 laps once he had taken the lead and became the 7th different winner in 7 races. Grosjean and Sergio Pérez achieved their 2nd career podium finishes as they finished second and third respectively. Vettel recovered to 4th, only 2 seconds behind Pérez at the flag. A frustrated Alonso dropped to 5th ahead of Rosberg who had an up and down race finishing 6th, fending off Webber and Räikkönen. Kamui Kobayashi finished a respectable 9th place in the other Sauber with Massa getting the final point in 10th.|$|E
