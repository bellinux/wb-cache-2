40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} the integration of automated fixture design and automated <b>fixture</b> <b>assembly</b> activities. This is an important requirement due to the continually growing demand for efficient and agile manufacturing technologies. The concurrent fixturing approach developed in this research provides a framework for the integration and capability enhancement in these two areas. A one to one functional mapping of workholding capability to the fixture design domain has been devised. This is utilized in the hierarchical development of innovative fixturing hardware solutions which meet automation, integration and concurrency criteria. Issues of cost, complexity and rigidity are addressed. A device for programmable assembly assistance to the operator is proposed. At the CAD based automated fixture design stage, the same functional mapping is utilized to impose workholding constraints on a 3 D solid model representation of the workpiece. Design criteria used includes modeling of cutter path interference and surface conditions of the workpiece. Accessibility, surface incidence and topological constraints of the workpiece are processed. Optimal placement of the workpiece over the pallet is determined by shift and scan evaluation of all constraints based on which the fixture layout is automatically generated. The design approach has been implemented using the TWIN solid modeler on a Silicon Graphics workstation. Very fast processing times are demonstrated for 3 D workpieces of industrial complexity, using fixturability algorithms developed in this research. The output generated can be directly used as instructions for automated <b>fixture</b> <b>assembly.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In the {{development}} of a modular fixture design system, it is essential to have a modular fixture element database that can be integrated with a CAD system, in addition to the other considerations such as fixture configuration, interference checking, etc., which are also important to fixture designers. This paper describes a new method to create the fixture element database and model the fixturing towers (i. e. subassem-blies). By using this method, the database can be effectively created and is easy for use in <b>fixture</b> <b>assembly.</b> The modular <b>fixture</b> tower database is used to represent the subassembly of fixtures. This will simplify the <b>fixture</b> design and <b>assembly</b> process. A built-in interference checking methodology is embedded in the plan-ning stage that will ensure a collision-free fixture design. The system is developed using the knowledge-based system, ICAD, and interfacing with UG-II for modelling the workpiece.

40|$|Today’s Aerospace {{vehicles}} utilise numerous pyrotechnic {{devices to}} separate structural subsystems, deploy appendages and activate on-board operational subsystems. The firing of these pyrotechnical charges generates severe impulsive loads (so-called pyroshocks) {{that can cause}} failures in electronic components. There {{is a lack of}} computational techniques to predict the dynamic behaviour of complex structures when subjected to high frequency shock waves as well as a lack of damage and failure criteria for electronic equipment and so the projects must rely on testing to validate the design. Alcatel ETCA has developed a pyroshock test facility dedicated to the testing of electronic units. The facility utilises a resonant test <b>fixture</b> <b>assembly</b> that is excited by a detonating charge or a mechanical impact. The test <b>fixture</b> <b>assembly</b> can be a simple plate, a beam, a double plate assembly or a more complex structure. The test item attached to the fixture is subjected to the direct shock wave and to the resonant response of the test fixture, which simulates the desired pyroshock. The test set up is checked and tuned versus the test specification by using a dummy of the test item. When the desired pyroshock is achieved, the nominal tests are performed on the test item. Part I of this presentation describes the main characteristics of the test facility: test fixtures, excitation techniques, data acquisition, and data processing. Part II presents some test results and details the effects of variables upon the induced shock response spectra. The main variables are related to the design of the test fixture (type, size, material) and the characteristics of the excitation (amount of explosive, location of explosive, and so on) ...|$|R
