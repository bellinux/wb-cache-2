25|$|Kracht's 2012 novel Imperium follows on from Ich werde hier sein im Sonnenschein und im Schatten both in {{its very}} {{favourable}} reception by critics {{and in the way}} that it presents a reimagining of history that incorporates actual persons and historical reality while playing <b>fast</b> <b>and</b> <b>loose</b> <b>with</b> dates and details. In this sense the novel bears some similarity to Die Vermessung der Welt (Measuring the World) by Daniel Kehlmann, an author with whom Kracht corresponded while composing the distinctive narrative style of Imperium. The novel follows the travails of the historical figure August Engelhardt in the Bismarck Archipelago (now Papua New Guinea) {{at the beginning of the}} twentieth century. Engelhardt is an idealistic German emigrant who establishes a plantation on an island and founds a colony of cocoivores – radical vegetarians nourished exclusively on coconuts. Engelhardt's history is interspersed with cameo appearances by other figures from German cultural history, such as Hermann Hesse, Thomas Mann and Franz Kafka. The first of Kracht's novels not to be narrated in the first-person, the omniscient narrator informs us of the protagonist's thoughts and contextualises Engelhardt's life within the broader scope of twentieth-century history.|$|E

500|$|Fujishima was {{particularly}} interested in the concept of a goddess [...] "as a job", and turned to Norse mythology as he felt that it was relatively unknown in Japan. Thus Belldandy is based on Verðandi (or Verthandi), the Norse Goddess of the present, (whose name is literally translated as [...] "to become" [...] or [...] "becoming"), and {{she is one of the}} three Norns or [...] "fates" [...] from Norse mythology. Verdandi, when translated into Japanese, becomes ベルダンディー (Berudandī). As the Japanese phonetic system does not distinguish between [...] "b" [...] and [...] "v" [...] or [...] "r" [...] and [...] "l" [...] (although ヴ can describe [...] "v".), [...] "Belldandy" [...] can emerge as a product of consonant substitutions. Indeed, it was in the first chapter of the manga that her name was transliterated as Belldandy rather than Verdandi, and this romanization has stuck since. When the English translations were being prepared, Toren Smith considered returning the name to [...] "Verthandi", (which Smith had determined to be the correct translation of the Old Norse), but chose to stick with Belldandy on the grounds that Fujishima was already [...] "playing <b>fast</b> <b>and</b> <b>loose</b> <b>with</b> the mythos" [...] and thus felt that no further harm was likely to come from employing Fujishima's transliteration. (Nevertheless, in the Swedish translation of the manga, released in 2007, her name was returned to Verdandi).|$|E

500|$|Critics {{and fans}} alike criticized the writers' seeming {{disregard}} for the Lost timeline. Based on the actions and whereabouts of characters in the third season, fans could deduce when parts of Michael's flashbacks occurred in relation to events on the island.

Either the writers are playing <b>fast</b> <b>and</b> <b>loose</b> <b>with</b> the concept of time, or Michael had the busiest week {{in the history of the}} world." [...] Using Lostpedia as a reference, Nikki Stafford of Wizard pointed out that the chronology was not only almost inconsistent with the third season, but also with an earlier episode of the same season.

6000|$|They had {{the light}} {{preparations}} of young housekeepers to make, {{and they were}} off {{to the field of}} Pinney's work in a very few days after he had seen Matt, and told him that he would talk it over with his wife. At Quebec he found board for his family at the same hotel where Northwick had stopped in the winter, but it had kept no recognizable trace of him in the name of Warwick on its register. Pinney passed a week of search in the city, where he had to carry on his investigations with an eye not only to Northwick's discovery, but to his concealment as well. If he could find him he must hide him from the pursuit of others, and he went about his work in the journalistic rather than the legal way. He had not wholly [...] "severed his connection," [...] as the newspaper phrase is, with the Events. He had a <b>fast</b> <b>and</b> <b>loose</b> relation <b>with</b> it, pending a closer tie with his friend, the detective, which authorized him to keep its name on his card; and he was soon friends with all the gentlemen of the local press. They did not understand, in their old-fashioned, quiet ideal of newspaper work, the vigor with which Pinney proposed to enjoy the leisure of his vacation in exploiting all the journalistic material relating to the financial exiles resident in their city. But they had a sort of local pride in their presence, and with their help Pinney came to know all that was to be known of them. The colony was not large, but it had its differences, its distinctions, which the citizens were very well aware of. There are defaulters and defaulters, and the blame is not in all cases the same, nor the breeding of the offenders. Pinney learned that there were defaulters who were in society, and not merely because they were defaulters for large sums and were of good social standing at home, but because there were circumstances that attenuated their offence {{in the eyes of the}} people of their city of refuge; they judged them by their known intentions and their exigencies, as the justice they had fled from could not judge them. There were other defaulters of a different type and condition, whose status followed them: embezzlers who had deliberately planned their misdeeds, and who had fallen from no domestic dignity in their exclusion from respectable association abroad. These Pinney saw in their walks about the town; and he was not too proud, for the purposes of art, to make their acquaintance, and to study in their vacancy and solitude the dulness and weariness of exile. They did not consort together, but held aloof from one another, and professed to be ignorant each of the affairs of the rest. Pinney sympathized in tone if not in sentiment with them, but he did not lure them to the confidence he so often enjoyed; they proved to be men of reticent temper; when frankly invited to speak of their history and their hopes in the interest of the reputations they had left behind them, they said they had no statement to make.|$|R

Once the Globe piece was published, Brown took to Twitter to protest Houpt's description and characterization of the event. Brown released their unedited e-mail interview from the day before, where Brown describes having a friend re-record a line from a remote segment in which audio had been badly recorded when originally uttered by a local Little Italy butcher; the email goes on to recount that Brown himself informed the show's executive producer Lynda Shorten of the post-recorded audio, that the episode never aired, and that it was later entirely re-recorded because of the issue— none of which was mentioned in Houpt's Globe piece.|$|E

Maybe all those assumptions and conclusions will be eventually explained in one of those “ohhhhh, I get it now” summations a couple of episodes down the road, but maybe not.

Thus, these kinds of leaps aren’t really out of the question for them. (You can’t blame them, really. We’re already watching a show about fairy tales, for crying out loud.) But I didn’t really get “Dreamcatcher.” I’m not sure that I’m supposed to yet, and down the road I might change my mind and say, “you know, that was the episode I need to go back and watch now that I know what I know.” But for now, it just left me a little cold.

2500|$|The book sold very well, {{and while}} some {{anatomical}} experts hostile to Haeckel's evolutionary views expressed some private concerns that certain figures had been drawn rather freely, the figures showed what they already knew about similarities in embryos. The first published concerns came from Ludwig Rütimeyer, a professor of zoology and comparative anatomy at the University of Basel who had placed fossil mammals in an evolutionary lineage early in the 1860s and had been sent a complimentary copy. At the end of 1868 his review in the Archiv für Anthropologie wondered about {{the claim that the}} work was [...] "popular and scholarly", doubting whether the second was true, and expressed horror about such public discussion of man's place in nature with illustrations such as the evolutionary trees being shown to non-experts. Though he made no suggestion that embryo illustrations should be directly based on specimens, to him the subject demanded the utmost [...] "scrupulosity and conscientiousness" [...] and an artist must [...] "not arbitrarily model or generalise his originals for speculative purposes" [...] which he considered proved by comparison with works by other authors. In particular, [...] "one and the same, moreover incorrectly interpreted woodcut, is presented to the reader three times in a row and with three different captions as [...] embryo of the dog, the chick, [...] the turtle." [...] He accused Haeckel of [...] "playing <b>fast</b> <b>and</b> <b>loose</b> <b>with</b> the public and with science", and failing {{to live up to the}} obligation to the truth of every serious researcher. Haeckel responded with angry accusations of bowing to religious prejudice, but in the second (1870) edition changed the duplicated embryo images to a single image captioned [...] "embryo of a mammal or bird". Duplication using galvanoplastic stereotypes (clichés) was a common technique in textbooks, but not on the same page to represent different eggs or embryos. In 1891 Haeckel made the excuse that this [...] "extremely rash foolishness" [...] had occurred in undue haste but was [...] "bona ﬁde", and since repetition of incidental details was obvious on close inspection, it is unlikely to have been intentional deception.|$|E
