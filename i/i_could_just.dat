The story was based on his real life best friend, Lisa Hill, who was struck by lightning and killed {{when they were both}} eight years old. Paterson had asked his mother, Katherine Paterson, if he could write a screenplay of the novel, and she agreed [...] "not only because he's [...] son, but also because he's a very good playwright". Paterson had difficulty marketing the screenplay, mostly because of Leslie's death; [...] "if you can believe this, I did meet with some companies that asked if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> 'hurt' Leslie a little bit—put her in a light coma and then bring her out".|$|E

His decision to attend Michigan rather than Ohio State was influenced by family ties, including Bob Chappuis, who was Volk's uncle and {{finished second in the}} Heisman Trophy voting while playing for the undefeated 1947 Wolverines. Volk noted:"I had all these stories growing up. He [...] was my hero, so I always wanted to go to Michigan. ... And I didn't like Woody [...] anyway.

500|$|How to Grow a Woman {{from the}} Ground takes {{influence}} from different genres, “drawing equally from traditional bluegrass, progressive acoustic, and singer/songwriter traditions”, with one critic calling {{the majority of}} the album very “roots oriented”. The album has a bluegrass or progressive bluegrass core; bluegrass mandolinist Ronnie McCoury became the album’s official “bluegrass guru” to ensure that there was “someone who could make sure we didn’t do anything clichéd or trite”. In regard to [...] the album’s style, Thile said that “All in all, How to Grow a Woman from the Ground is a bluegrass record. There are definitely some musical things that are out of the ordinary, but it sounds like a bluegrass record to me. It’s not all like “Brakeman’s Blues,” but “Brakeman’s Blues” doesn’t sound out of place, and neither does “The Beekeeper” sound out of place. It’s all related.” Much of Thile's work on the album was influenced by his divorce, and Thile claims that he could relate to the title of the album, a Tom Brosseau song. Thile said that he [...] "got my ass kicked by the last relationship I was in. This girl just left. It created a pretty serious complex for me. [...] I’ve always been able to talk to girls, but I’m scared of them. I just could relate to it.

500|$|As {{the sets}} were {{being built in}} Las Vegas, {{producer}} Frank Mancuso, Jr., son of Paramount president Frank Mancuso, Sr., had the screenplay rewritten in secret, and gave Bakshi a new screenplay by screenwriters Michael Grais and Mark Victor that [...] "was barely the same". Larry Gross {{also contributed to the}} script, but his work would later go on to be uncredited. In interviews {{at the time of the}} film's release, Mancuso, Jr., who was best known for the Friday the 13th franchise, stated a desire to move away from horror films, and wanted to produce a film [...] "about what happens when someone creates a world, becomes defined by it, and then can't escape [...] a film about being trapped by your own creation." [...] Bakshi remembers that he got into a fight with Mancuso, Jr. and [...] "punched [...] in the mouth." [...] Paramount threatened Bakshi with a lawsuit if he refused to complete the film. [...] "I thought if I did the animation well, it would be worth it, but you know what? It wasn't worth it." [...] Bakshi also stated that he [...] "had a lot of animators there that I'd brought in and I thought that maybe <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> have fun animating this stuff, which I did." [...] Bakshi had developed the film as a mix of comedy and horror that he described as [...] "a hard R-rated story" [...] but Paramount wanted a PG-13 film, one of the reasons for the doomed and angry relationship between filmmaker and studio.|$|E

After forgetting the password to this account, he then registered the [...] "PewDiePie" [...] YouTube channel on 29 April 2010. After {{he dropped out of}} Chalmers, his parents refused to support him, and as a result he funded his early videos by selling prints of his Photoshop art, as well as working at a hot dog stand. On having to work at the stand, PewDiePie stated, [...] "the fact that I could make videos was so much more important to me than [...] I had to spend a few hours a day doing a job that wasn’t that prestigious." [...] Five years later, PewDiePie recalled, [...] "I knew people were big at other types of videos, but there was no one big in gaming, and I didn’t know you could make money out of it. It was never like a career that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> quit college to pursue. It was just something I loved to do. And here we are five years later and it’s exploded." [...] By December 2011, PewDiePie's channel had around 60,000 subscribers. Around the time his channel earned 700,000 subscribers, PewDiePie spoke at Nonick Conference 2012. On 11 July 2012, the channel reached 1 million subscribers, and it reached 2 million subscribers in September. In October, OpenSlate ranked the PewDiePie channel as the #1 YouTube channel. That December, PewDiePie signed with Maker Studios.|$|E
500|$|Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe {{wrote that}} the song [...] "is totally shameless and {{completely}} effective" [...] as it [...] "derives much of its charm from a hefty sample of Michael Jackson's 'Human Nature'". Joanne Dorken of MTV UK {{wrote that the}} sample gives [...] "the tune an instant eighties feel". Najah Goldstein of radio station WNOW-FM wrote that the song is [...] "shows a much softer side of Chris Brown", and further added that it's [...] "definitely a song for the ladies...maybe even for pop star Rihanna." [...] Margaret Wappler of Los Angeles Times wrote that [...] "the sentiment of the song is refreshingly complex." [...] Hannah Ash of The Harber Herald wrote that on F.A.M.E., [...] "She Ain't You" [...] and [...] "Up to You" [...] are [...] "the perfect sweet and cute love songs". While reviewing the album, Sean Fennessey of The Washington Post wrote that [...] "a more appropriate application appears on 'She Ain’t You', which interpolates Michael Jackson's 'Human Nature'. Jackson {{has long been the}} emotional, physical and musical forebear to Brown. But on 'She Ain’t You' he begs the comparison, and it isn’t pretty." [...] Jon Caramanica of The New York Times wrote that Brown [...] "has a really charmless way with a lyric, as on 'She Ain’t You'—"When I'm with her it's only 'bout the sex / With you I had a bad romance / And if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> trade her in I would"—and a voice nowhere near strong enough to make up for it." [...] The song was nominated for Song of the Year at the 2011 Soul Train Music Awards, and Top R Song at the 2012 Billboard Music Awards.|$|E

The other two singles released from the album were [...] "Hand on the Pump" [...] and [...] "Latin Lingo", the latter of which combined English and Spanish lyrics. The success of these singles led to the album selling two million copies in the US alone. Cypress Hill contributed the song [...] "Shoot 'Em Up" [...] to the soundtrack of the movie Juice.

Like her {{character}} in Annie Hall, Keaton had long relished photography as a favorite hobby, an interest she picked up as a teenager from her mother. While traveling in the late 1970s, she began exploring her avocation more seriously. [...] "Rolling Stone {{had asked me to}} take photographs for them, and I thought, 'Wait a minute, what I'm really interested in is these lobbies, and these strange ballrooms in these old hotels.' So I began shooting them", she recalled in 2003. [...] "These places were deserted, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> sneak in anytime and nobody cared. It was so easy and I could do it myself.

There is some point where I learnt enough about myself to know that I don't have the {{tolerance}} to create other hurdles as well." [...] In 1999, Cornell said about depression, [...] "No one really knows what run-of-the-mill depression is. You'll think somebody has run-of-the-mill depression, and then the next thing you know, they're hanging from a rope. It's hard to tell the difference. But I do feel that depression can be useful. Sometimes it's just chemical. It doesn't seem to come from anywhere. And whenever I've been in any kind of depression, I've over the years tried to not only imagine what it feels like to not be there, but try to remind myself that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> wake up the next day and it could be gone because that happens, and not to worry about it. And at the same time, when I'm feeling great, I remember the depression and think about the differences in what I'm feeling and why I would feel that way, and not be reactionary one way or the other. You just have to realize that these are patterns of life and you just go through them." ...|$|E
2500|$|From 1925 to 1928 he was passionately {{involved}} with Dalí. The friendship with Lorca {{had a strong}} element of mutual passion, but Dalí [...] rejected the erotic advances of the poet. With the success of [...] "Gypsy Ballads", came an estrangement from Dalí and the breakdown of {{a love affair with}} sculptor Emilio Aladrén Perojo. These brought on an increasing depression, a situation exacerbated by his anguish over his homosexuality. He felt he was trapped between the persona of the successful author, which he was forced to maintain in public, and the tortured, authentic self, which he could only acknowledge in private. He also had the sense that he was being pigeon-holed as a [...] "gypsy poet". He wrote: [...] "The gypsies are a theme. And nothing more. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> as well be a poet of sewing needles or hydraulic landscapes. Besides, this gypsyism gives me the appearance of an uncultured, ignorant and primitive poet that you know very well I'm not. I don't want to be typecast". Growing estrangement between García Lorca and his closest friends reached its climax when surrealists Dalí and Luis Buñuel collaborated on their 1929 film Un Chien Andalou (An Andalusian Dog). García Lorca interpreted it, perhaps erroneously, as a vicious attack upon himself. At this time Dalí also met his future wife Gala. Aware of these problems (though not perhaps of their causes), García Lorca's family arranged for him to take a lengthy visit to the United States in 1929–30.|$|E
2500|$|The {{integration}} of St Peter's College {{into the state}} education system also [...] " ... caused a 'church/state' separation of the [...] community from the institution". This was demonstrated particularly in the formal splitting of authority in the school between the school Board of Trustees and the Principal of the College, and the new role of the former in staffing matters. As the Christian Brothers did not own the school, they could not appoint their representatives on the Board. The proprietor's representatives where instead appointed by the school's owner, the Bishop of Auckland. In 1992 the Christian Brothers shifted from the college to a new community house in Queen Mary Avenue, Epsom, acquired because it was near St Peter's College. Brother L. H. Wilkes wrote about what this meant for the Christian Brothers community. [...] "For years the dread of leaving St Peter's house hung over the community at St Peter's. In 1991 it was down to months and in early 1992 it was down to weeks and to days. Nobody actually spoke definitely about leaving but everyone knew it was inevitable. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> not imagine the community in an ordinary house in an ordinary street ...". Some Brothers teaching at St Peter's College in the late 1980s moved to another community house in Mangere which soon closed. Apart from Brother Paul Robertson, the last Christian Brother to retain regular involvement with St Peter's College was Brother V. N. Cusack. He worked in the St Peter's tuckshop until 1997, arriving at 7.30am every school day to heat the pies.|$|E
