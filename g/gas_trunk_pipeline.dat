50|$|The natural <b>gas</b> <b>trunk</b> <b>pipeline</b> system {{stretches}} 10,138 kilometers. The major transit pipelines are the Central Asia-Center {{gas pipeline}} {{system and the}} Bukhara-Urals pipeline, which transport natural gas from Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan to Russia, and Orenburg-Novopskov pipeline and Soyuz pipeline from Orenburg processing plant to Europe. The Gazli-Bishkek pipeline transports natural gas from Uzbekistan to Kyrgyzstan. The Central Asia-Center and the Bukhara-Urals pipelines as also the Bukhara-Tashkent-Bishkek-Almaty pipeline are also main import pipelines. The main gas export goes to Orenburg processing plant in Russia. The export to Russia goes also through the Central Asia-Center and the Bukhara-Urals pipelines.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Long term {{service of}} oil and gas trunk {{pipelines}} in corrosion and hydrogenated environments can cause a degradation of the mechanical properties and correspondingly a decrease its lifetime. Effect of service about 30 years on the impact strength and hydrogen cracking {{of oil and}} <b>gas</b> <b>trunk</b> <b>pipeline</b> low alloyed steels is considered. In the case of the “bottom ” section of the oil pipe being in service, it has been not possible to evaluate the impact strength, due to the deflection into cracking parallel to the pipe wall. This is a symptom of so called hydrogen induced stratification, well known degradation phenomenon of industrial pipe lines transporting the crude oil containing the higher amount of the hydrogen sulfide and the sulfide-reduction bacteria. The different susceptibility to hydrogen cracking and impact strength for the upper and bottom of parts of exploited pipe has been explained as a result of hydrogen charging and hydrogen degradation of steel during the service. The results discussed in the paper show that inspection of the surfaces of installations to find corrosion or mechanical damage alone may not be sufficient for proper evaluating risk of failure. Since material can loss its initial mechanical properties, a thorough investigation of the properties of the metal being in service under the hydrogenation conditions for the long time is suggested...|$|E

40|$|Gas {{supplying}} {{process for}} consumers needs sufficient share {{of energy for}} upstream, midstream and downstream purposes. In spite of {{a huge amount of}} great investments into the industry it is still available to improve the efficiency of energy usage inside the industry. The biggest share of energy consumption is within transportation sector. Optimization of operating conditions of gas pipeline is a one of the cheapest ways for reducing energy consumption. Optimization doesn’t need any investments into the industry. It works only within operating parameters. Adjustable operating parameters of a gas pipeline are operative pressure, rotation speed of compressors, amount of operating units, gas temperature after a compressor station and others. The energy consumption depends on the combination of the parameters which determine an appropriate operation mode to provide the particular gas flow through a pipeline, the maximum capacity, the minimum energy consumption and others. From energy saving point of view it is possible to reduce energy demand in the gas industry due to optimization of the operation mode. A few approaches to achieving energy reduction through optimization are investigated in this work and presented in this article, such as saving energy through changing of loading between compressor stations, varying the depth of gas cooling and changing the loading of gas pumping units. The results of analyzing inside the study model reflect the possibility for improving efficiency of <b>gas</b> <b>trunk</b> <b>pipelines...</b>|$|R

It serves as a control element in thecomplex of buildings, belonging to the <b>trunk</b> <b>gas</b> <b>pipeline.</b> It is by compressor station operationparameters the pipeline operation mode is defined. Presence of CS allows to adjust an operation modeof the gas pipeline at gas consumption fluctuations, using the maximum of the gas pipeline storagecapacity. During the operation of compressor station there can occur some infractions of gas pumping unit(GPU) electro-receivers power supply, leading to a forced or emergency stop of at least one GPU ofCS.

Years of national and internationalexperience show that the use of wind power plants of low power (up to 5 - 6 kW) is almost alwayseconomically feasible in areas with average annual wind speed VAV. AN. of more than 3. 5 - 4. 0 m/s. Theuse of high-power wind power plants is justified in cases when VAV. AN. exceeds 5. 5 - 6. 0 m/s. In the master's thesis the possibility of wind power plants exploitation for uninterrupted operation ofauxiliary power plant (APP), which is a part of compressor station, is considered. In the first chapter of the thesis the condition and reliability of CS power supply system of trunk gaspipelines (TGP) is examined.
