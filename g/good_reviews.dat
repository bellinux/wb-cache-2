40|$|How {{should we}} (researchers) conduct and present a <b>good</b> <b>review</b> study? Although {{graduate}} students receive some guidance {{on how to}} write a research paper, they are rarely provided instruction about how to perform a review study. Due to their limited knowledge and experience, many students tend to think that a <b>good</b> <b>review</b> simply comprises reference to many previous research studies. In this paper, we point out that a <b>good</b> <b>review</b> study needs to be original, comprehensive, and easy to understand. Moreover, we offer directions for conducting a <b>good</b> <b>review</b> study, and provide key points drawn from interview data with young psychology researchers who have published review studies in peer-reviewed journals...|$|R

Alperson from Grand National Films, a newly established, {{independent}} studio, approached him to make movies for $100,000 a film and 10% of the profits. Cagney made two films for Grand National: Great Guy and Something to Sing About.

A third film, Dynamite, was planned, but Grand National ran out of money.|$|E
5|$|In October 1927, Memoirs of a White Crow Indian was {{accepted}} for publication by Century, and Marquis was prompted to take down his medical practice sign. However, this was premature, {{as it would be}} some time before royalties were forthcoming. Lack of funds drove Marquis to continue seeing patients and carrying out insurance medical examinations. He also needed to borrow money from relatives and cash in his war risk insurance policy. Memoirs of a White Crow Indian was published in April 1928 and received <b>good</b> <b>reviews.</b>|$|E

5|$|It did {{not seem}} to Dietz as if there was any {{relationship}} between critical praise and audience enthusiasm for January films. The best-rated, Disney's 2004 animated musical Teacher's Pet, was a commercial failure, as was 2001's The Pledge.

5|$|A Warrior Who Fought Custer was {{published}} in April 1931 to mostly <b>good</b> <b>reviews.</b> However, W. J. Ghent, writing in the New York Times, criticized the claim made by Wooden Leg that many of Custer's men had committed suicide rather than face death {{at the hands of}} the Indians. Although sales of the Wooden Leg book did well, better than Marquis had expected, this controversy was to prove a hindrance to his chances of future book publications. Marquis believed he had multiple Indian sources verifying this account, and there were no surviving whites to contradict it. He planned to develop the idea more fully in a future book, eventually to become Keep the Last Bullet for Yourself.|$|E
