40|$|In {{recent years}} several methodologies have been {{developed}} to combine and interpret ensembles of climate models with the aim of quantifying uncertainties in climate projections. Constrained climate model forecasts have been generated by combining various choices of metrics used to weight individual ensemble members, with diverse approaches to sampling the ensemble.

Therefore, a climate model forecast classification system can serve two roles: to provide a way for forecast producers to self-classify their forecasts; and to provide information on the methodological assumptions underlying the <b>forecast</b> <b>generation</b> and its uncertainty when forecasts are used for impacts studies.

30|$|A {{much simpler}} {{alternative}} {{is to use the}} Relative Intensity (RI) of seismicity, or the count of the number of earthquakes in the past. RI stands on the premise that earthquakes are more likely to occur in the future where historical seismic-ity is higher than elsewhere (Tiampo et al., 2002). As we describe in the present paper, RI can be modified into a smoothed seismicity model. The Proximity to Past Earthquakes (Rhoades and Evison, 2004), Cellular Seismology (Kafka, 2002) and others (e.g., Kagan and Jackson, 2000; Kossobokov, 2004; Helmstetter et al., 2006, 2007) also belong to the category of smoothed seismicity models, although they offer slightly different representations of the same basic hypothesis. Note that temporal changes in seis-micity rates are not taken into account in the RI <b>forecast</b> <b>generation.</b> Previous studies indicate that RI has considerable forecast performance despite its simplicity (Rundle et al., 2002, 2003; Tiampo et al., 2002; Holliday et al., 2005, 2006 a, b; Nanjo et al., 2006 a, b, c; Zechar and Jordan, 2008). The challenge we face is to move toward a systematic, prospective testing of the RI hypothesis under a well-controlled environment.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} a supplier who must predict future orders using forecasts provided by their customers. Our {{goal is to}} improve the supplier's operations through {{a better understanding of the}} customers's forecast behavior. Unfortunately, customer forecasts cannot be used directly. They may be biased since the customer may want to mislead the supplier into believing that orders may be larger than expected to secure favorable terms or simply because the customer is a poor forecaster. There are several unusual elements in our problem. Analysts typically observe the actual process which may be biased due to asymmetric loss function. Also units are discrete not continuous. We believe the forecasting process can be modeled in a multi stage process. The customer first computes the distribution of demand at a future date which we assume to follow an ARMA(1, 1) model. The customer then submits an integral forecast(multiples of lot sizes), which minimizes his expected loss due to forecast errors. We show that the customer may bias his forecasts under an asymmetric loss functions.

30|$|The {{fluctuating}} and stochastic {{nature of}} wind power imposes new challenges to supply adequacy in electric power systems [5, 6]. Load fluctuation or generation failure also causes a supply adequacy problem in conventional power systems. Based on static characteristics of load, {{the process of}} secure supply adequacy involves load <b>forecasting,</b> <b>generation</b> and grid planning, generation dispatch, etc. Planned generation usually consists of three types: on-line fast response generations (minutes) for frequency regulation, fast response generations such as hydro or gas for load following (hour), and slow response generations such as coal or nuclear for unit commitment (day). With large-scale wind generation in the system, the net load of the system exhibits two new features: increasing rate and range of variation; and increasing uncertainty of rate and range of variation. The study shows that these features will first impact load following requirements (increase), further on base load requirements (decrease) when the penetration grows, and yet at load level and on–off operation of conventional generations. Large-scale wind integration therefore requires a substantial increase for flexibility of response from conventional generations [1].|$|R

The need to mitigate climate change, achieve renewables energy targets, and use {{renewable sources of energy}} means that many countries are considering greater levels of wind generation in their power generation mix. The overall impact of wind generation on system costs and performance has only been studied recently, and often with limited actual data from power systems with increased wind penetration. The paper uses a unique dataset of half-hourly system demand, generation, wind <b>forecast</b> <b>generation,</b> and actual wind generation, along with Irish system marginal price (SMP) data from 2008 to autumn 2012. An econometric time-series model of SMP as a function of forecast and realized demand and wind generation is formed. The costs of balancing and system constraints are included in the cost of ‘uplift’, and thus the total cost of a variety of factors is included in our estimates for Ireland. Our results suggest that each 1 % increase in wind generation reduces SMP in Ireland by about 0. 06 %, while each 1 % wind forecast error increases SMP about 0. 02 %.

40|$|While the Chilean {{constitution}} {{guarantees the}} right of a clean environment and that environmental acts and policies to manage waste have been passed, waste generation has increased dramatically in the last decade in Chile and programmes to recycle, recover or reuse waste are not being implemented. The extent of Chile's waste management problem is vast. Among the existing problems for implementing waste management programmes in Chile is the lack of information on factors contributing to waste generation and the absence of waste <b>generation</b> <b>forecasts.</b> Recognising these waste generation factors is essential for implementing policies to reduce waste generation and waste <b>generation</b> <b>forecasts</b> are fundamental for planning waste management systems. This research aims to design an analysis tool to assess waste generating factors and <b>forecast</b> waste <b>generation</b> for a significant portion of Chile. Data for many variables indicating socio-demographic, economic, geographic and waste-related conditions were collected based on the existing literature. Using these variables, statistical methods identified Population, Percentage of Urban Population, Years of Education, Number of Libraries and Number of Indigents as the most important factors contributing to waste generation in Chile. A Multi-Layer Perceptron neural network modelled the relationship between these variables and waste generation with great accuracy (R² =. 819). The MLP network determined their respective contribution to waste generation and showed that they all contribute positively to waste generation. Using these variables, a Self-Organising Feature Map neural network clustered the 342 communes of Chile into three groups (with 91, 156 and 95 communes) from which representative communes were selected for data collection for <b>forecasting</b> waste <b>generation.</b> The most representative communes were not used due to lack of data. Therefore, secondary representative communes were selected, reducing the level of representativeness of the model from 230 (67. 3 %) communes to 167 (48. 8 %). Data was collected from the secondary communes and <b>forecasts</b> for waste <b>generation</b> up to the year 2010 were made. Recurrent networks were the best neural networks for <b>forecasting</b> waste <b>generation</b> using the selected variables for the three groups (R² = 0. 75, 0. 25 and 0. 80, respectively). These results were improved using Multi Layer Perceptrons and recurrent networks with Per Capita Waste Generation as a new input (R² = 0. 81, 0. 91 and 0. 98), showing extremely accurate forecasts for the validation periods. Forecasted rates show that by 2010, representative communes will generate 100, 240 and 2, 900 tonnes/month, reaching annual rates of 1 %, 0. 6 % and - 3 %, respectively. The forecasted results were used to obtain estimates for the represented communes of each group. Total waste generation from the represented communes will peak at 3, 800 tonnes/month and 18, 500 tonnes/month by 2010 and over 330, 000 tonnes/month by 2007. Extrapolating these results shows that Chile will peak at more than 500, 000 tonnes/month by 2007, an increase of 7. 6 % in total waste generation from 2002. Finally, it has been demonstrated that artificial neural networks have the potential to work with waste data to great accuracy despite the problems with the data. The proposed model represents a reliable tool for improving waste management not only for Chile, but also abroad...|$|R
