25|$|In 1928, H. A. Jones, the {{official}} {{historian of the}} RAF wrote that the battle showed that infantry co-operation would be a permanent feature of British air operations. Recognition flares had proved effective, although there had been too few and because of infantry were reluctant to risk revealing their positions to German artillery observers. Scheduled illumination was a failure and infantry began {{to wait for a}} call from the contact aeroplane, by signal lamp or by <b>klaxon.</b> RFC observers reported that direct observation was the most effective method and that flying low enough to be fired on worked best, although this led to many aircraft being damaged and one lost to a British shell. Artillery-observation was hampered by bad weather but the rolling countryside led to constant demands for sorties for counter-battery fire; when the weather grounded the RFC, attacks could fail for lack of observation.|$|E
25|$|He {{reached the}} Easter Cup final at Shelbourne {{and won the}} Spring Cup final at Harold's Cross Stadium and National Cup final at Shelbourne before {{travelling}} to England for the first time. In a solo trial prior to the 1929 English Greyhound Derby on 25 July, Mick broke the track record, reducing his odds from an initial 25–1 to becoming the 4–7 favorite to win {{by the time of}} the final, despite still being new off the board from Ireland. He was housed at the kennels of Paddy McEllistrim for the duration of the Derby. In the first round, Mick pulled away down the back straight, beating Captured Half by eight lengths and setting a time of 29.82, a new world record over that length. Father Browne sold Mick for £800, plus any prize money that the dog would win on the night, which at the time was more than the cost of buying a house in nearby Shepherd's Bush. By 8:45pm, when the final took place, some 40,000 spectators were in the ground. The lineup was four dogs; in trap one was Beadsman at 20–1; trap two was Palatinus at 3–1; trap three was Entomb at 9–2, and finally Mick the Miller in trap four, wearing the black jacket. Palatinus made the best start, at the first bend both Mick and Entomb attempted to move inside to the rail, but Beadsman collided with both of them, sending all three dogs sprawling. The no–race <b>klaxon</b> went off, and the race had to be restarted. None of the dogs was allowed to leave the track with until the race was re–run at 9:15pm, the only comfort given to Mick on a particularly hot summer's evening was a handkerchief soaked in cold water.|$|E

500|$|... "DNA" [...] is a mid-tempo electropop and R ballad, which {{incorporates}} {{influences of}} dubstep and runs {{for three minutes}} and 56 seconds. It contains an instrumentation consisted of a guitar riff, skittering and thumping drum beats, and spooky synthesisers accompanied with Little Mix's vocal performance. According to music website Popjustice, the song features [...] "a squeaky door effect" [...] and [...] "Cheiron-style slamming smashy noises." [...] Vicky Newman of the Shields Gazette said that the track has an urban edge to it. The song begins with a tinkling music box before Perrie Edwards starts singing the line [...] "Does he love you when you least expect it," [...] in a low register. After the second chorus, the song almost stops completely before a half-rapped, half-spoken middle eight, followed by a choral breakdown. The choral breakdown, described as [...] "Gothic" [...] by many critics, gives way to brief rave <b>klaxon</b> instrumentation. Viewed as a dark song by Little Mix and music critics alike, [...] "DNA" [...] sees the group depart from their fun and upbeat sound on previous single, [...] "Wings". It has been heavily compared to Katy Perry's [...] "E.T.", which was an influential factor in the song's development.|$|E

[...] Denson had helped raise Newsweek's circulation by 50 percent during his tenure, in part through innovative layouts and graphics, and he brought the same approach to the Tribune. Denson [...] "swept away the old front-page architecture, essentially vertical in structure" [...] and laid out stories horizontally, with unorthodox and sometimes cryptic headlines; large photos and information boxes.

2500|$|The {{first section}} {{is called the}} Introduction (I) or fanfare and is either 4, 8, or 16 bars long. The {{introduction}} is typically played in marcato style, typically using forte dynamics and chromatic alterations to catch {{the attention of the}} listener. The intro is almost never omitted from a march regardless of occasion. Examples of marches without an intro include Bugles and Drums and the Footlifter. Compared to the other sections of a march, the introduction is usually the shortest part. Introductions vary but some standard practices include: (a) tutti unison (Washington Post), (b) tutti rhythmic unison but with contrary motion (The Thunderer), (c) tutti rhythm but in four-part harmony (Semper Fi), and (d) Four-part independent (The <b>Klaxon).</b> [...] The introduction is commonly based on the Dominant to create clarity of key center in the first strain. (See Harmonic Progressions below). The intro isn't generally repeated, but examples where it is include Bravura, Rifle Regiment, and Washington Grays. The introduction generally starts in major because many marches are in major keys but examples of introductions in minor keys include the Gladiator, the Picadore, the Nobles of the Mystic Shrine, and Rolling Thunder.|$|E

The Royal Flying Corps (RFC) began operations {{on the night of}} [...] when 100 and 101 squadrons attacked German billets and railway stations. Mist rose before dawn and ended night flying early; there was a low cloud present at [...] when the infantry advanced, which made observation difficult.

2500|$|QI (Quite Interesting) is a British comedy panel game {{television}} {{quiz show}} created and co-produced by John Lloyd, and features permanent panelist Alan Davies. Stephen Fry was {{host of the}} show from its initial pilot, before departing after the final episode of the M series in 2015, with frequent QI panelist Sandi Toksvig replacing him prior {{to the beginning of}} the N series in 2016. The format of the show focuses on Davies and three other guest panelists answering questions that are extremely obscure, making it unlikely that the correct answer will be given. To compensate, the panelists are awarded points not only for the right answer, but also for interesting ones, regardless of whether they are right or even relate to the original question, while points are deducted for [...] "answers which are not only wrong, but pathetically obvious" [...] – typically answers that are generally believed to be true but in fact are misconceptions. These answers, referred to as [...] "forfeits", are usually indicated by a loud <b>klaxon</b> and alarm bell, flashing lights, and the incorrect answer being flashed on the video screens behind the panelists. Bonus points are sometimes awarded or deducted for challenges or incorrect references, varying from show to show. QI has a philosophy that [...] "everything is interesting if looked at in the right way"; many factual errors in the show have been corrected in later episodes or on the show's blog.|$|E
2500|$|Sky Screamer, a first-generation Intamin Freefall ride, was {{constructed}} in the Plaza de Fiesta section and opened in 1983. Consisting of a tower reaching [...] in height and a horizontal braking runout, Sky Screamer had an L-shaped appearance. It featured eight uniquely designed gondolas, each holding four riders. The gondolas used one set of wheels to go up the lift and down the drop (4 large wheels at each back corner), but used a different set in the transfer and loading and unloading area of the ride (smaller rollers located {{on the bottom of}} the gondola). Gondolas were lifted upward through a shaft in the tower's center by a lift chain. Once at the top, the gondola was disengaged from the lift chain and pushed forward into the drop position. The gondola was released into freefall following the sounding of a loud <b>klaxon</b> (which was audible throughout sections of the park and often lured visitors to the ride). A pair of guide rails ran downward along the outside of the tower before curving into the horizontal braking runout. The freefall drop into the horizontal curve applied a g-force of 4.5 on the riders. In late 1983, 50% more anti-rollback devices were installed. The additional anti-rollbacks were staggered on each side of the lift. These modifications were intended to improve stopping ability in wet conditions and were a response to a non-fatal accident on a similar ride at another park. In 1986, the ride's [...] "G-Block" [...] was moved farther down the horizontal braking runout. The end of [...] "H-Block" [...] was extended to the beginning of the station conveyors in 1994. Sky Screamer was dismantled on November 2, 1997.|$|E
