25|$|The {{decision}} to remove {{controls on the}} exchange rate had been expected {{to lead to a}} much higher foreign-exchange price, to encourage exports, and to permit import liberalization without a surging external deficit. But when the rate was set free, the price of dollars went down instead of going up. That initial effect could be explained by the tight restraints imposed on liquidity, which drove firms and individuals who held dollar balances to convert them to domestic currency in order to keep operating. This movement should presumably have gone into reverse when holdings of dollars ran out, but fully eighteen months later no reversal had occurred. Dollars remained too cheap to make exports profitable and too cheap for many producers to compete against imports for several reasons, including the continuing influx of dollars from the drug trade into street markets and then into the banking system. A second reason has involved the continuing low level of <b>domestic</b> <b>income</b> and production, and corresponding restraint of demand for imports as compared with what they would be in an expanding economy. But perhaps the most fundamental reasons have been the continuing squeeze on liquidity in terms of domestic currency and the resulting high rates of interest for borrowing domestic currency, which strongly favor borrowing dollars instead or repatriating them from abroad. All this means that the economy has had no foreign-exchange problem, but also that incentives to produce for export have been held down severely, when both near-term recovery and longer-term growth badly need the stimulus of rising exports.|$|E

The simultaneous {{existence of the}} urban informal sector and the urban unemployment has been explained interms of such efficiency wage relation. Two different production structures have been considered in this paper: first, formal capital is specific to the urban formal sector, while informal capital is mobile between the rural sector and the urban informal sector;second, formal capital is mobile between urban formal sector and the rural sector, while informal capital is specific to the urban informal sector. Our investigation shows that rural subsidization reduces unemployment and raises <b>domestic</b> factor <b>income</b> in both cases. However, such a policy may lower <b>domestic</b> factor <b>income</b> in the original models of Gupta(1997) and Grinols (1992). Subsidization to the urban formal sector raises unemployment and <b>domestic</b> factor <b>income</b> in the two different production structures. However, such a policy may produce ambiguous effect in the original model of Grinols(1991). Interestingly, subsidization to the urban informal sector leads to different effects in the two different cases.

Thus, our results have shown that the impact of development policies on unemployment and <b>domestic</b> factor <b>income</b> depends on the nature of the production structures. These theoretical results may guide the policy makers to pursue the development policy in a small open economy. Development policy, production structure,urban unemployment...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} the global {{financial}} crisis on the international trade patterns of developed countries {{has been one of}} the main focuses of recent studies. However, the dependence level of world trade on emerging markets increases every day. Therefore, it is important to study the level of the negative {{effect of the}} crisis on emerging economies and the level of their recovery potential. This paper empirically studies the effects of the financial crisis on changes in the trade elasticities of BRIICS (Brazil, Russia, India, Indonesia, China and South Africa) countries and Turkey. The imperfect substitute model (Goldstein and Khan 1985) for the export and import demand functions is used. The autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) approach to cointegration is applied to test the cointegration relationships between exports and imports and their determinants and in order to estimate the export and import elasticities in the countries under examination. The empirical results provide enough evidence to conclude that changes in the exchange rate did not play significant role in export and import demand functions before the global financial crisis and after. However, foreign and <b>domestic</b> <b>incomes</b> are found highly significant and elastic in export and import demand functions, respectively. It is found as well that the global financial crisis had increasing effect on export and import responsiveness to foreign and <b>domestic</b> <b>incomes</b> respectively, except for Turkey and Brazil in the export demand function and South Africa in the import demand function. ...|$|R
