40|$|Individuals with Parkinson’s disease (PD) {{have lower}} uric acid levels than those without PD, and the CC {{genotype}} and C minor allele {{of a single}} nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs 1014290 of SLC 2 A 9, are associated with lower uric acid levels. We investigated the association of rs 1014290 with uric acid metabolism in a cohort of PD cases (220) and controls (110) in a Han Chinese population. Uric acid levels were determined and rs 1014290 was assayed using a mutation-sensitive on/off switch technology. PD uric acid levels (291. 65 ± 76. 29 [*]μmol/L) were {{significantly lower than the}} controls (325. 73 ± 74. 23 [*]μmol/L, P< 0. 001, t-test). Individuals with rs 1014290 TT and CT genotypes <b>had</b> <b>higher</b> <b>uric</b> <b>acid</b> levels, and those with the CC genotype had the lowest uric acid levels among both control and PD cases. The CC genotype and the C minor allele were statistically more frequent in the PD group compared to the control group. Those with the CC genotype had a statistically significant higher risk of PD than those with the TT or TC genotype (odds ratio [OR] = 2. 249, 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1. 129 – 4. 480, and P= 0. 021). Thus, SLC 2 A 9 rs 1014290 is related to lower uric acid levels in PD patients and can be a risk factor for PD in the Han population...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Both hyperuricaemia {{and left}} {{ventricular}} (LV) hypertrophy {{are associated with}} the metabolic syndrome and increased cardiovascular risk. The relationship between uric acid levels and left ventricular mass in hypertension, however, is unclear. In this study, we have investigated this relationship in hypertensive patients without the metabolic syndrome. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, 367 nondiabetic, essential hypertensive patients (age 52 ± 14; 194 males and 173 females) free of clinically relevant cardiovascular complications and without the metabolic syndrome were consecutively recruited at a university hypertension clinic. In these patients, we measured plasma levels of uric acid, lipids, glucose and insulin at fast and after an oral glucose load (OGTT), renal function and performed both conventional and tissue Doppler echocardiography. RESULTS: Hypertensive patients with LV hypertrophy <b>had</b> <b>higher</b> <b>uric</b> <b>acid</b> levels and greater prevalence of hyperuricemia than patients with normal left ventricular mass. Uric acid levels were directly related with fasting and post-OGTT plasma insulin and with the HOMA index and inversely with 24 -h creatinine clearance. Uric acid was also significantly and directly related with the left ventricular mass and multivariate regression analysis showed that this relationship was independent from components of the metabolic syndrome and renal function in women, but not in men. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated uric acid levels are independently related to the left ventricular mass in hypertensive women without the metabolic syndrome. In these patients with a low cardiovascular risk profile, uric acid might {{contribute to the development of}} subclinical cardiac damage...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to study the biochemical and haematological indices of three age groups, suckling, weaned and lactating, of Sudanese dromedary camels. Forty eight samples were collected {{from each of the}} three groups. Suckling calves had higher (p> 0. 05) haemoglobin, packed cell volume, mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular haemoglobin, white blood cells count and phosphorus concentrations than the weaned calves which had higher levels of red blood cells count, magnesium, sodium and iron contents. When the haematological profile of the suckling calves was compared with that of their lactating dams, the formers were found to have higher (p> 0. 05) red blood cells count, total white blood cells count, haemoglobin and packed cell volume while the lactating dams had higher mean cell haemoglobin concentration. The serum biochemical indices of the suckling calves were compared with those of the weaned calves. The former group was found to have higher (p> 0. 05) total protein and creatinine while the latter <b>had</b> <b>higher</b> <b>uric</b> <b>acid</b> concentration.

Aims {{of the present study}} were to assess the prevalence of and factors associated with GD in unselected patients with NAFLD. Methods: A total of 161 consecutive patients with NAFLD diagnosed through compatible ultrasonography in the absence of known etiologies of liver disease (in all patients) and/or confirmed histologically (in 61 patients), was studied. Gallstone disease was diagnosed through ultrasound scanning or on the basis of previous cholecystectomy. Anthropometric and biochemical variables and concurrent diseases were compared in 32 NAFLD-GD patients and in 129 NAFLD patients without GD (controls) according to gender. Results: The overall prevalence of GD was 19. 88 %, higher in female patients (P< 0. 05), who were older (P < 001). The overall percentage of GD increased with age (P < 0. 05). The GD patients <b>had</b> <b>higher</b> <b>uric</b> <b>acid</b> (men), total cholesterol and apolipoprotein B (apo-B) serum concentrations (women, P < 0. 05); women also had a higher prevalence of hypertriglyceridemia (P < 0. 05). The age-corrected odds ratio of having GD by tertiles increased significantly with increasing uric acid (men) and with increasing total cholesterol, triglycerides and apo-B (women). At univariate continuous analysis GD was associated with insulin 120 min and uric acid in male patients; and with body mass index, insulin 120 min, apo-B, total cholesterol and triglycerides in female patients. On multivariate analysis it was found that among these factors only uric acid in men and apo-B in women were independently associated with GD in NAFLD. Conclusions: The prevalence of GD in NAFLD is more elevated than reported in the general population.

Aims {{of this study}} were to (1) assess whether severity of SDB is related to uric acid excretion in North American and Southeast European children and (2) evaluate the interaction between nocturnal hypoxemia and country of children's origin in uric acid excretion. Methods: Consecutive US and Greek children with snoring who were referred for polysomnography were recruited. Uric acid excretion expressed as uric acid-to-creatinine concentrations ratio in a morning urine specimen was the primary outcome measure. Results: One hundred and twenty-six US children (6. 8 +/- 0. 7 years old) and 123 Greek children (6. 4 +/- 2. 5 years old) were recruited. Forty-three US and 53 Greek participants had moderate-to-severe nocturnal hypoxemia (SpO(2) nadir < 90 %). Obstructive apnea-hypopnea index and SpO(2) nadir were related to uric acid excretion in Greek (but not US) children after adjustment by age, gender and body mass index z-score (p < 0. 05). There was a significant interaction between severity of hypoxemia and country of children's origin in uric acid excretion after adjustment by age, gender and body mass index z-score (p = 0. 036).

However, in today's society, the intake of fructose, primarily in the form of added sugars, has skyrocketed, while the intake of natural fruits high in vitamin C has fallen.

40|$|Background : {{cerebrovascular}} disease and ischemic cardiopathy {{can be considered}} as an epidemic and constitute the first cause of incapacities in developed countries. Multiple studies have shown the association between <b>uric</b> <b>acid</b> levels and {{cerebrovascular disease}}s. Objective : To correlate the levels of serum <b>uric</b> <b>acid</b> and incapacities in the acute phase of cerebrovascular disease. Methods : A correlational study was carried out with 217 patients with acute cerebrovascular disease. The patient’s incapacity level was measured by using the Barthel Index and those results were related with the serum <b>uric</b> <b>acid</b> levels and other variables. Results : Male patients <b>have</b> <b>higher</b> levels of <b>uric</b> <b>acid</b> (p= 0, 04; r= 0, 13). Age and Barthel index were p < 0, 001; r = - 0, 30 and <b>uric</b> <b>acid</b> levels and Barthel Index were p= 0, 03; r=- 0, 14. The principal predicting factors of incapacity in the acute phase of cerebrovascular disease were the <b>high</b> levels of <b>uric</b> <b>acid,</b> age and diabetes mellitus. Conclusions : It is shown that the highest is the level of <b>uric</b> <b>acid</b> at advanced age; the greatest is the risk of suffering from incapacity in acute phases of cerebrovascular diseases...|$|R
40|$|<b>Uric</b> <b>acid</b> {{has been}} linked with {{increased}} risk of chronic disease such as cardiovascular disease and this association {{has been attributed to}} a pro-inflammatory effect. Indeed, observational studies <b>have</b> shown that <b>high</b> <b>uric</b> <b>acid</b> is associated with high level of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the blood. However, whether <b>high</b> <b>uric</b> <b>acid</b> directly affects inflammation or rather represents a parallel defensive antioxidant mechanism in response to pathology that causes inflammation is unknown. To determine whether acute increase or decrease <b>uric</b> <b>acid</b> levels affects inflammation in healthy individuals, a randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind clinical study of <b>uric</b> <b>acid</b> or rasburicase with 20 healthy volunteers in each treatment-placebo group was conducted at the National Institute on Aging (NIA) Clinical Research Unit (CRU) at Harbor Hospital in Baltimore, MD. Change in inflammatory response was assessed by administering an oral lipid tolerance before and after the treatment of <b>uric</b> <b>acid,</b> rasburicase and placebo. Following <b>uric</b> <b>acid</b> administration, there was an accentuated increase in IL- 6 during the oral lipid tolerance test (P< 0. 001). No significant differences were observed after lowering of <b>uric</b> <b>acid</b> with rasburicase. No side effects were reported throughout the trial. In health individuals, acute increase in <b>uric</b> <b>acid</b> results in an increased IL- 6 response when challenged with lipid load. Such effect of amplification of inflammatory response may explain the higher risk of chronic diseases observed in subclinical hyperuricemia in observational studies.

40|$|Background: WHO {{estimated}} that the prevalence of metabolic syndrome was occured in 23 % of male population and 12 % of female population in the world. Hyperuricemia had a strong relationship with each component of metabolic syndrome. Earlier studies reported that physical activity {{played an important role}} to prevent hyperuricemia. Aim: To find out the assosiation between intensity of physical activity and serum <b>uric</b> <b>acid</b> levels in metabolic syndrome population. Methods: This study was an observational analytic study with cross-sectional design. This study was conducted in RW X, Padangsari, Banyumanik, Semarang in a population based sample aged over 40. The collected data are subject characteristics, serum <b>uric</b> <b>acid</b> levels, andintensity of physical activity. Global physical activity questionnaire (GPAQ), developed by WHO, was used to determine the intensity of physical activity. The Spearman test and chi- square test were used for the statistical analyses. Results: The data showed that 40, 6 % of 32 subjects with metabolic syndrome had light physical activity, 25 % had moderate physical activity and 34, 4 % had vigorous physical activity. The examination of serum <b>uric</b> <b>acid</b> levels showed that 40, 6 % of them <b>had</b> <b>high</b> serum <b>uric</b> <b>acid</b> levels.

40|$|One {{proposed}} {{mechanism by}} which alum enhances an immune response is by its ability to induce an inflammatory response that results in the release of <b>uric</b> <b>acid</b> from necrotic cells. <b>Uric</b> <b>acid</b> {{is thought to be}} a mediator in enhancing the immune response.

Two other groups were pretreated with allopurinol and were given ovalbumin + alum, or ovalbumin + <b>uric</b> <b>acid</b> 24 hours later. An additional two groups served as controls. On days 4, 7 and 10 post-injection, the numbers of Interleukin 4 (IL- 4) and Interferon-γ (IFN-γ) secreting spleen cells were determined by the ELISPOT assay. Serum <b>uric</b> <b>acid</b> levels were determined using an autoanalyser and nitric oxide using the Greiss reagent. The groups that received alum + ovalbumin or <b>uric</b> <b>acid</b> + ovalbumin <b>had</b> the <b>highest</b> numbers of IL- 4 and INF-γ secreting cells as compared to all the groups.

40|$|Humans {{and higher}} {{primates}} are {{unique in that}} they lack uricase, the enzyme capable of oxidizing <b>uric</b> <b>acid.</b> As a consequence of this enzyme deficiency, humans <b>have</b> <b>high</b> serum <b>uric</b> <b>acid</b> levels. In some people, <b>uric</b> <b>acid</b> levels rise above the solubility limit resulting in crystallization in joints, acute inflammation in response to those crystals causes severe pain; a condition known as gout. Treatment for severe gout includes injection of non-human uricase to reduce serum <b>uric</b> <b>acid</b> levels. Krystexxa® is a hyper-PEGylated pig-baboon chimeric uricase indicated for chronic refractory gout that induces an immunogenic response in 91 % of treated patients, including infusion reactions (26 %) and anaphylaxis (6. 5 %). These properties limit its use and effectiveness. An innovative approach {{has been used to}} develop a therapeutic uricase with improved properties such as: soluble expression, neutral pH solubility, high E. coli expression level, thermal stability, and excellent activity. More than 200 diverse uricase sequences were aligned to guide protein engineering and reduce putative sequence liabilities. A single uricase lead candidate was identified, which showed low potential for immunogenicity in > 200 human donor samples selected to represent diverse HLA haplotypes. Cysteines were engineered into the lead sequence for site specific PEGylation and studies demonstrated > 95 % PEGylation efficiency.

40|$|Albumen {{was removed}} from broiler eggs {{before the start of}} {{incubation}} to induce prenatal protein under-nutrition in chicken embryos. With this method, the direct effect of protein deficiency was investigated, differing from mammalian models manipulating the maternal diet where indirect, hormonal effects can interfere. Based on the estimated albumen/egg weight ratio, 10 % of albumen was removed with an 18 G needle, after making a hole at the sharp end of the egg with another 18 G needle. Eggs were taped thereafter. The sham group underwent the same procedure, except that no albumen was removed. Control eggs did not receive any treatment. The removal of albumen decreased both embryonic and post-hatch body weight up to day 7 compared with the control group. On embryonic day 18, embryos from the albumen-deprived group <b>had</b> <b>higher</b> plasma <b>uric</b> <b>acid</b> levels compared with the sham (P= 0. 016) and control (P= 0. 009) groups. Moreover, a lower plasma amino acid concentration was observed at hatch compared with the sham (P= 0. 038) and control (P= 0. 152) groups. These findings indicate an altered protein metabolism. At hatch, a higher mRNA expression of muscle ring finger- 1 (MuRF 1), a gene related to proteolysis, was observed in albumen-deprived chicks compared with the control and sham chicks, together with an up-regulated expression of atrogin- 1 (another atrogene) at this time point in the male protein-deficient chicks. These findings suggest that muscle proteolysis is transiently increased by the removal of albumen before the start of incubation. No evidence was found for altered protein synthesis capacity and translational efficiency in albumen-deprived chicks. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|In cirrhotic {{patients}} without renal failure, salt retention {{could result}} from a decreased effective intravascular volume or could be a primary event leading to increased intravascular volume.

40|$|Hereditary {{mutations}} in Tamm-Horsfall protein (THP/uromodulin) gene cause autosomal dominant kidney diseases characterized by juvenile-onset hyperuricemia, gout and progressive kidney failure, although the disease pathogenesis remains unclear. Here {{we show that}} targeted expression in transgenic mice of a mutation within the domain of 8 cysteines of THP in kidneys' thick ascending limb (TAL) caused unfolded protein response in younger (1 -month old) mice and apoptosis in older (12 -month old) mice. While the young mice had urine concentration defects and polyuria, such defects progressively reversed in the older mice to marked oliguria, highly concentrated urine, fibrotic kidneys and reduced creatinine clearance. Both {{the young and the}} old transgenic mice <b>had</b> significantly <b>higher</b> serum <b>uric</b> <b>acid</b> and its catabolic product, allantoin, than age-matched wild-type mice. This THP mutation apparently caused primary defects in TAL by compromising the luminal translocation and reabsorptive functions of NKCC 2 and ROMK and secondary responses in proximal tubules by upregulating NHE 3 and URAT 1. Our results strongly suggest that the progressive worsening of kidney functions reflects the accumulation of the deleterious effects of the misfolded mutant THP and the compensatory responses. Transgenic mice recapitulating human THP/uromodulin-associated kidney diseases could be used to elucidate their pathogenesis and test novel therapeutic strategies...|$|R

The aim was to investigate whether concentrations of <b>uric</b> and ascorbic <b>acids</b> were altered in such patients.

Afterwards, 13 patients with severe head trauma were monitored for up to 13 days in the intensive care unit.  RESULTS—Intraoperatively, concentrations of both ascorbic and <b>uric</b> <b>acids</b> were significantly <b>higher</b> in the bypass group than in patients with aneurysm, which might be attributed to chronic ischaemic conditions caused by the unilateral occlusion of the carotid artery. In the patients with trauma, mean values of <b>uric</b> <b>acid,</b> varying between 6 µM and 180 µM, did not correlate with type of injury (contusion or diffuse) or duration of monitoring time.
