Many of these particles probably derive from the thermosphere. The ion and electron energies can be as high as 4 and 1.2 megaelectronvolts, respectively. The density of low-energy (below 1 <b>kiloelectronvolt)</b> ions in the inner magnetosphere is about 2 cm−3. The particle population is strongly affected by the Uranian moons, which sweep through the magnetosphere, leaving noticeable gaps. The particle flux is high enough to cause darkening or space weathering of their surfaces on an astronomically rapid timescale of 100,000 years. This may be the cause of the uniformly dark colouration of the Uranian satellites and rings. Uranus has relatively well developed aurorae, which are seen as bright arcs around both magnetic poles. Unlike Jupiter's, Uranus's aurorae seem to be insignificant for the energy balance of the planetary thermosphere.|$|E

The value of the moment is about 1.3 T·m3, which is three {{times larger than the}} magnetic moment of Mercury. The magnetic dipole is tilted with respect to the rotational axis of Ganymede by 176°, which means that it is directed against the Jovian magnetic moment. Its north pole lies below the orbital plane. The dipole magnetic field created by this permanent moment has a strength of 719 ± 2 nT at Ganymede's equator, which should be compared with the Jovian magnetic field at the distance of Ganymede—about 120 nT. The equatorial field of Ganymede is directed against the Jovian field, meaning reconnection is possible. The intrinsic field strength at the poles is two times that at the equator—1440 nT.The permanent magnetic moment carves a part of space around Ganymede, creating a tiny magnetosphere embedded inside that of Jupiter; it is the only moon in the Solar System known to possess the feature.

Combined with the archival data, we now have broadband observations of this remarkable source from six separate epochs. Two of these new observations probe lower fluxes than seen previously, allowing us to extend {{our knowledge of the}} broadband spectral variability exhibited. The spectra are well fit by two thermal blackbody components that dominate the emission below 10 <b>kiloelectronvolts,</b> as well as a steep (Gamma approximately equal to 3. 5) power-law tail thatdominates above approximately 15 <b>kiloelectronvolts.</b> Remarkably, while the 0. 3 - 10. 0 <b>kiloelectronvolts</b> flux varies by a factor of approximately 3 between all these epochs, the 15 - 40 <b>kiloelectronvolts</b> flux varies by only approximately 20 percent. Although the spectral variability is strongest in the approximately 1 - 10 <b>kiloelectronvolts</b> band, both of the thermal components are required to vary when all epochs are considered. We also revisit the search for iron absorption features by leveraging the high-energy NuSTAR data to improve our sensitivity to extreme velocity outflows in light of the ultra-fast outflow recently detected in NGC 1313 X- 1. Iron absorption from a similar outflow along our line of sight can be ruled out in this case. We discuss these results in the context of super-Eddington accretion models that invoke a funnel-like geometry for the inner flow, and propose a scenario in which we have an almost face-on view of a funnel that expands to larger radii with increasing flux, resulting in an increasing degree of geometrical collimation for the emission from intermediate-temperature regions...|$|R

40|$|AbstractCollisional {{activation}} (CA) {{of large}} ions at <b>kiloelectronvolt</b> energies {{is accompanied by}} unexpectedly large losses of translational energy, which vary {{with the nature of}} the collision gas. Previous investigations have concentrated upon subsequent fragmentations occurring within a time window covering a few μs immediately following collision, using mass-analyzed ion kinetic energy spectrometry. In the present work, survivor ions were selected for specified values of translational energy loss, and their internal energy contents assessed via their subsequent unimoleculr fragmentation reactions within a later time window. Beam collimation was also applied when circumstances permitted to impose angular selection, thus minimizing cross talk between effects of collisional scattering and energy dispersion. It was shown that internal excitation of the reactant ion can account for {{only a small fraction of}} the observed loss of translational energy. The recoil energy of the target is thus the principal sink for the translational energy loss, since the latter was always chosen to be less than the lowest excitation energy of the target. This conclusion is shown to be consistent with theoretical models of the CA process. The practical implications of these conclusions for CA of large ions at <b>kiloelectronvolt</b> energies are discussed...|$|E

40|$|The {{majority}} of ultraluminous X-ray sources are point sources that are spatially offset from the nuclei of nearby galaxies and whose X-ray luminosities exceed the theoretical maximum for spherical infall (the Eddington limit) onto stellar-mass black holes. Their X-ray luminosities in the 0. 5 – 10 <b>kiloelectronvolt</b> energy band range from 10 [superscript 39] to 10 [superscript 41] ergs per second. Because higher masses imply less extreme ratios of the luminosity to the isotropic Eddington limit, theoretical models {{have focused on}} black hole rather than neutron star systems. The most challenging sources to explain are those at the luminous end of the range (more than 10 [superscript 40] ergs per second), which require black hole masses of 50 – 100 times the solar value or significant departures from the standard thin disk accretion that powers bright Galactic X-ray binaries, or both. Here we report broadband X-ray observations of the nuclear region of the galaxy M 82 that reveal pulsations with an average period of 1. 37 seconds and a 2. 5 -day sinusoidal modulation. The pulsations result from the rotation of a magnetized neutron star, and the modulation arises from its binary orbit. The pulsed flux alone corresponds to an X-ray luminosity in the 3 – 30 <b>kiloelectronvolt</b> range of 4. 9 × 10 [superscript 39] ergs per second. The pulsating source is spatially coincident with a variable source that can reach an X-ray luminosity in the 0. 3 – 10 <b>kiloelectronvolt</b> range of 1. 8 × 10 [superscript 40] ergs per second.

40|$|AbstractThe distributon P(ϵ) of {{internal}} energies deposited in W(CO) 6 +’ ions upon charge stripping (that is, electron detachment to yield the doubly charged ion {{in the course}} of a single <b>kiloelectronvolt</b> energy collision) was estimated by a thermochemical method from the measured relative abundances of the doubly charged fragment ions produced. The thermochemical information needed to estimate P(ϵ) was obtained by measuring the threshold translational energy losses associated with charge stripping of the singly charged fragment ions, W(CO) +n (n = 0 – 5). The P(ϵ) curve falls exponentially with increasing internal energy. The average energy transferred to W(CO) 6 +’ upon a 7. 8 -keV collision with O 2 is 19 eV, yielding W(CO) 62 + ions with an average of 4 eV {{of internal}} energy. In its general appearance, the P(ϵ) distribution associated with charge stripping is similar to the curves obtained from simple collisional activation of either W(CO) 6 +’ or W(CO) 62 + in <b>kiloelectronvolt</b> energy gaseous collisions. Given that charge stripping occurs by way of an electronic excitation process, this similarity in the energy deposition function is taken to indicate that electronic excitation is also the major mechanism for simple collisional activation in this system at zero scattering angle in the <b>kiloelectronvolt</b> energy regime. The internal energy distribution associated with a related charge-stripping process, charge inversion from the metal carbonyl anions to yield the corresponding cations, was also recorded. This reaction shows a large (∼ 7 eV) average internal energy deposition with a distribution that indicates near-zero probability of formation of unexcited ions. These data are tentatively interpreted in terms of vibrational electron detachment. The internal energy distribution associated with an exothermic process, charge exchange [W(CO) 62 + + O 2 → W(CO) + 6 + O 2 +’], was also characterized. Unexpectedly strong coupling of translational to internal energy is observed, and there is a large probability of depositing internal energies in excess of 10 eV, even though the exothermicity is only 3 eV. Finally, the internal energy distributions associated with the formation of doubly charged W(CO) 62 + ions by electron ionization have been measured. Unlike the distribution for charge stripping, but like that for singly charged ions generated by electron impact, this distribution shows considerable structrue, presumably due to Franck-Condon factors...|$|E
