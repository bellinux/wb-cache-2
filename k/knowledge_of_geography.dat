5|$|Tripathi {{started writing}} The Secret of the Nagas {{while the first}} part of the trilogy was being released. He relied on his <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>geography</b> and history to expand the {{locations}} visited in the story. The book was released on 12 August 2011, and was published by Westland Press. Before its release, the author confessed that many revelations would be present in the book, including the true nature of many characters. Two theatrical trailers were created for showing in multiplex cinema halls, as Tripathi believed that the film-going audience also reads his books, and that would create publicity.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{other great}} {{scholars}} {{of the age}} he travelled little and his <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>geography</b> came from his library of over one thousand books and maps, from his visitors and from his vast correspondence (in six languages) with other scholars, statesmen, travellers, merchants and seamen. Mercator's early maps were in large formats suitable for wall mounting but {{in the second half}} of his life he produced over 100 new regional maps in a smaller format suitable for binding into his Atlas of 1595. This was the first appearance of the word Atlas in a geographical context but Mercator used it as a neologism for a treatise (Cosmologia) on the creation, history and description of the universe, not simply a collection of maps. He chose the word as a commemoration of a King Atlas of Mauretania whom he considered to be the first great geographer. This King Atlas was a son of the Titan Atlas but the two myths very quickly coalesced.|$|E
500|$|Ptolemy, {{writing in}} his Geographia in about 150 AD, {{described}} how the Atlantic Ocean and Indian Ocean were great enclosed seas {{and believed that}} a vessel venturing into the Atlantic would soon reach {{the countries of the}} East. His map of the then known world was remarkably accurate but from the fourth century onwards, civilisation suffered a setback at the hands of barbarian invaders and <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>geography</b> took a backward step. In the seventh century, Isidore of Seville produced a [...] "wheel map" [...] in which Asia, Africa and Europe were arranged like segments in an orange, separated by the [...] "Mare Mediterranean", [...] "Nilus" [...] and [...] "Tanais" [...] and surrounded by [...] "Oceanus". It was not until the fifteenth century that Ptolemy's maps were used again and Henry the Navigator of Portugal initiated ocean exploration and maritime research. Encouraged by him, Portuguese navigators explored, mapped and charted the west coast of Africa and the Eastern Atlantic and this knowledge prepared the way for the great voyages of exploration that were to follow.|$|E

2500|$|Cubism by 1912 had {{abstracted}} {{almost to}} the point of total non-representation. In Du [...] "Cubisme" [...] Metzinger and Gleizes had realized that figurative aspects of the new art could be abandoned: [...] "we visit an exhibition to contemplate painting, not to enlarge our <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>geography,</b> anatomy etc. [...] 'Let the picture imitate nothing; let it nakedly present its motive, and we should indeed be ungrateful were we to deplore the absence of all those things – flowers or landscapes or faces – of which it could never have been anything other than a reflection'. Though Metzinger and Gleizes hesitate to do away with nature entirely: 'Nevertheless, let us admit that the reminiscence of natural forms cannot be absolutely banished; as yet, at all events. An art cannot be raised all at once to the level of a pure effusion.' [...] 'This is understood by the Cubist painters, who tirelessly study pictorial form and the space which it engenders'.|$|E
2500|$|The {{periodicals}} that Patrick Brontë read were a mine {{of information}} for his children. The Leeds Intelligencer and Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine, conservative and well written, but better than the Quarterly Review that defended the same political ideas whilst addressing a less refined readership (the reason Mr. Brontë did not read it), were exploited in every detail. Blackwood's Magazine in particular, {{was not only the}} source of their knowledge of world affairs, but also provided material for the Brontës' early writing. [...] For instance, an article in the June, 1826 number of Blackwood’s, provides commentary on new discoveries from the exploration of central Africa. [...] The map included with the article highlights geographical features the Brontës reference in their tales: the Jibbel Kumera (the Mountains of the Moon), Ashantee, and the rivers Niger and Calabar. [...] The author also advises the British to expand into Africa from Fernando Po, where, Christine Alexander notes, the Brontë children locate the Great Glass Town. [...] Their <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>geography</b> was completed by Goldsmith's Grammar of General Geography, which the Brontës owned and heavily annotated.|$|E

Another tablet eaten after lunch gave a student a complete <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>geography.</b> Another tablet made it possible for the eater to spell the most difficult words, and still another enabled him to write a beautiful hand.

Had I heard it mentioned I would have known nothing about it and cared as little. I know all about it now--its size, its standing, its military significance. Yesterday the news that the Germans have captured it in their second rush to Warsaw made my heart sink into my boots. I woke up in the night and worried over it. I don't wonder babies always cry when they wake up in the night. Everything presses on my soul then and no cloud has a silver lining." ...|$|E
60|$|With {{the general}} <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>geography</b> now possessed {{we may well}} wonder at the wild notion entertained both by Bonaparte and the French {{authorities}} {{that it would be}} possible, after conquering Egypt, to march an army through Syria, Persia, and the wild countries of the northern borders of India, and to drive the British altogether from that country. The march, even if unopposed, would have been a stupendous one, and the warlike chiefs of Northern India, who, as yet, were not even threatened by a British advance, would have united against an invading army from the north, and would, had it not been of prodigious strength, have annihilated it. The French had enormously exaggerated the power of Tippoo Sahib, with whom they had opened negotiations, and even had their fantastic designs succeeded, it is certain that the Tiger of Mysore would, in a very short time, have felt as deep a hatred for them as he did for the British.|$|E

6000|$|All pure {{mathematics}} is a priori, like logic. This was strenuously denied by the empirical philosophers, who maintained that experience {{was as much}} {{the source of our}} knowledge of arithmetic as of our <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>geography.</b> They maintained that by the repeated experience of seeing two things and two other things, and finding that altogether they made four things, we were led by induction to the conclusion that two things and two other things would always make four things altogether. If, however, this were the source of our knowledge that two and two are four, we should proceed differently, in persuading ourselves of its truth, from {{the way in which we}} do actually proceed. In fact, a certain number of instances are needed to make us think of two abstractly, rather than of two coins or two books or two people, or two of any other specified kind. But as soon as we are able to divest our thoughts of irrelevant particularity, we become able to see the general principle that two and two are four; any one instance is seen to be typical, and the examination of other instances becomes unnecessary.(1) ...|$|E

"The Germans have recaptured Premysl," [...] said Susan despairingly, {{looking up}} from her newspaper, [...] "and now I suppose {{we will have to}} begin calling it by that uncivilised name again.

'It might hurt his feelings and he has likely enough to worry him as it is. But you cannot cheer Cousin Sophia up, no matter how sarcastic you are, Mrs. Dr. dear. She sighed for the third time and groaned out, 'But the Russians are retreating fast,' and I said, 'Well, what of it? They have plenty of room for retreating, have they not?' But all the same, Mrs. Dr. dear, though I would never admit it to Cousin Sophia, I do not like the situation on the eastern front." ...|$|E
60|$|In Venice {{nothing in}} decay is strange. But it is startling {{to find her}} in her old age nourishing into fresh life an art that, after feebly {{preserving}} the memory of painting for so many centuries, had decorated her prime only with the glories of its decline;--for Kugler ascribes {{the completion of the}} mosaics of the church of St. Cyprian in Murano to the year 882, and the earliest mosaics of St. Mark's to the tenth or eleventh centuries, when the Greek Church had already laid her ascetic hand on Byzantine art, and fixed its conventional forms, paralyzed its motives, and forbidden its inspirations. I think, however, one would look about him in vain for other evidences of a returning prosperity in the lagoons. The old prosperity of Venice, was based upon her monopoly of the most lucrative traffic in the world, as we have already seen,--upon her exclusive privileges in foreign countries, upon the enlightened zeal of her government, and upon men's imperfect <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>geography,</b> and the barbarism of the rest of Europe, as well as upon the indefatigable industry and intelligent enterprise of her citizens. America was still undiscovered; the overland route to India was the only one known; the people of the continent outside of Italy were unthrifty serfs, ruled and ruined by unthrifty lords. The whole world's ignorance, pride, and sloth were Venetian gain; and the religious superstitions of the day, which, gross as they were, embodied perhaps its noblest and most hopeful sentiment, were a source of incalculable profit to the sharp-witted mistress of the Adriatic. It was the age of penances, pilgrimages, and relic-hunting, and the wealth which she wrung from the devotion of others was exceedingly great. Her ships carried the pilgrims to and from the Holy Land; her adventurers ransacked Palestine and the whole Orient for the bones and memorials of the saints; and her merchants sold the precious relics throughout Europe at an immense advance upon first cost.|$|E

25|$|The {{borders of}} Moravia cannot exactly be {{determined}} {{because of the}} lack of accurate contemporaneous sources.
