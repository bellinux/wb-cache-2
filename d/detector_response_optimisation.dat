40|$|It is {{well-known}} that in pinhole SPECT (single-photon-emission computed tomography), iterative reconstruction methods including accurate estimations {{of the system}} response matrix can lead to submillimeter spatial resolution. There are two different methods for obtaining the system response matrix: those that model the system analytically using an approach including an experimental characterization of the <b>detector</b> <b>response,</b> and those that make use of Monte Carlo simulations. Methods based on analytical approaches are faster and handle the statistical noise better than those based on Monte Carlo simulations, but they require tedious experimental measurements of the <b>detector</b> <b>response.</b> One suggested approach for avoiding an experimental characterization, circumventing the problem of statistical noise introduced by Monte Carlo simulations, is to perform an analytical computation of the system response matrix combined with a Monte Carlo characterization of the <b>detector</b> <b>response.</b> Our findings showed that this approach can achieve high spatial resolution similar to that obtained when the system response matrix computation includes an experimental characterization. Furthermore, we have shown that using simulated <b>detector</b> <b>responses</b> {{has the advantage of}} yielding a precise estimate of the shift between the point of entry of the photon beam into the detector and the point of interaction inside the detector.

The current study investigated whether compensation for these factors improves perfusion defect detectability, and compared {{the results for}} human observers with a previous study using a mathematical observer. Methods: Four methods were investigated: attenuation compensation (AC); attenuation and <b>detector</b> <b>response</b> compensation; attenuation and scatter compensation; and attenuation, <b>detector</b> <b>response,</b> and scatter compensation (ADSC). For ADSC, 4 three-dimensional postreconstruction Butterworth filter cutoff frequencies were investigated for a pixel size of 0. 62 cm: 0. 12, 0. 14, 0. 16, and 0. 22 pixel � 1. Five observers read images reconstructed using the 4 compensation methods. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) {{analysis was used to}} determine the area under the ROC curve in each treatment studied. Results: Reconstruction methods that incorporated scatter and <b>detector</b> <b>response</b> compensation had higher indices of detectability than AC alone. Over the range studied, a filter cutoff frequency of 0. 14 pixel � 1 was optimal. A comparison of human observer results with an earlier channelized Hotelling observer study performed with the same images showed excellent agreement in trend and ranking of defect detectability. Conclusion: Compensation for <b>detector</b> <b>response</b> and scatter improves defect detectability compared with AC alone, although detectability may depend on phantom population choice and noise level. An optimal filter cutoff was found that is lower than what is typically used in a clinical setting. The channelized Hotelling observer is a good predictor of human observer performance and may reduce the need for tedious, time-consuming studies with human observers...|$|R
40|$|We examine an Unruh-DeWitt {{particle}} detector that is coupled linearly to the scalar {{density of}} a massless Dirac field in Minkowski spacetimes of dimension d> 2 {{and on the}} static Minkowski cylinder in spacetime dimension two, allowing the detector's motion to remain arbitrary and working to leading order in perturbation theory. In d-dimensional Minkowski, with {{the field in the}} usual Fock vacuum, we show that the <b>detector's</b> <b>response</b> is identical to that of a detector coupled linearly to a massless scalar field in 2 d-dimensional Minkowski. In the special case of uniform linear acceleration, the <b>detector's</b> <b>response</b> hence exhibits the Unruh effect with a Planckian factor in both even and odd dimensions, in contrast to the Rindler power spectrum of the Dirac field, which has a Planckian factor for odd d but a Fermi-Dirac factor for even d.

We show that the <b>detector's</b> <b>response</b> distinguishes the periodic and antiperiodic spin structures, and the zero mode of the periodic spinor contributes to the response by a state-dependent but well defined amount.

40|$|The ex-core <b>detector</b> <b>response</b> {{calculation}} is {{an important}} part in reactor design. However, the response function cannot be measured by experiments quantitatively. Ex-core <b>detector</b> <b>response</b> simulation is therefore required. For decades, the SN code has been used as the dedicated tool. Nowadays, more and more engineers are expressing an interest in using the Monte-Carlo method instead of the SN method in simulations, as it is expected that the Monte-Carlo method will give higher accuracy. In this paper, the modeling and simulation of ex-core <b>detector</b> <b>responses</b> is briefly reviewed based on the Korean Kori Unit 1 reactor. Then, the differences between the SN simulation and Monte-Carlo simulation are compared. The sensitivity of computational conditions is also discussed. It is shown that the problem dependence of cross sections and meshing dependence of spatial discretization in the ex-core <b>detector</b> <b>response</b> calculations are not as strong as expected. However, the ray effect is the main shortcoming for the SN calculation. Based on the analysis, two benefits are shown by using MCNP for the direct 3 D calculation. Firstly, the impact of ray effect is eliminated without using the SN angular discretization. Secondly, the direct 3 D calculation is easier to perform based on the powerful ability of 3 D modeling and parallel computing of the Monte-Carlo code. The new DRF values are adopted in the dynamic control rod reactivity measurement of Kori Unit 1 reactor.

Unfortunately, the point reactor model fails to accurately predict <b>detector</b> <b>response</b> in common applications.

40|$|Searches for {{gravitational}} waves with km-scale laser interferometers often involve the long-wavelength approximation {{to describe the}} <b>detector</b> <b>response.</b> The prevailing assumption is that the corrections to the <b>detector</b> <b>response</b> due to its finite size are small and the errors due to the long-wavelength approximation are negligible. Recently, however, Baskaran and Grishchuk (2004 Class. Quantum Grav. 21 4041) found that in a simple Michelson interferometer such errors can be as large as 10 %. For more accurate analysis, these authors proposed to use a linear-frequency correction to the long-wavelength approximation. In this paper we revisit these calculations. We show that the linear-frequency correction is inadequate for certain locations {{in the sky and}} therefore accurate analysis requires taking into account the exact formula, commonly derived from the photon round-trip propagation time. Also, we extend the calculations to include the effect of Fabry–Perot resonators in the interferometer arms. Here we show that a simple approximation which combines the long-wavelength Michelson response with the single-pole approximation to the Fabry–Perot transfer function produces rather accurate results. In particular, the difference between the exact and the approximate formulae is at most 2 – 3 % for those locations in the sky where the <b>detector</b> <b>response</b> is greater than half of its maximum value. We analyse the impact of such errors on detection sensitivity and parameter estimation in searches for periodic {{gravitational waves}} emitted by a known pulsar, and in searches for an isotropic stochastic gravitational-wave background.
