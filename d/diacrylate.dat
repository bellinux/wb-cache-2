Irradiation {{of one or more}} diketones produces two distinct hydroxy o-quinodimethane (photoenol) intermediates. These intermediates are trapped via a Diels-Alder cycloaddition with appropriate dienophiles, e. g., <b>di(acrylates)</b> to give the corresponding in polyesters quantitative yields. When <b>di(acrylates),</b> tri(acrylates) and di and tri(methacrylates) or mixtures thereof with monoacrylate end-caps are used as the dienophile, the resulting polyesters have glass transition temperatures (Tg) as high as 200 C.

50|$|The process usually {{involves}} a dynamically reconfigurable digital photomask. A 3-D model is decomposed {{into a series}} of 2-D planes, the pattern of which is transmitted to the photomask. When shined through by UV light, the mask will transmit the image of the planes onto a lens which subsequently project it onto a photosensitive polymer resin such as 1,6-hexanediol <b>diacrylate</b> (HDDA) causing the liquid to cure in the light exposed areas. These process is repeated for each layer and assembled together to form a 3-D system. Non-polymer lattices can also be created from this process by additional processing. For instance, metallic structures can be created by electroless plating onto the base structure followed by removal of the polymer through thermal heating.

5000|$|End {{groups are}} an {{important}} aspect of polymer synthesis and characterization. In polymer chemistry, end groups are functionalities or constitutional units that are at the extremity of a macromolecule or oligomer (IUPAC). [...] In polymer synthesis, like condensation polymerization and free-radical types of polymerization, end-groups are commonly used and can be analyzed for example by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to determine the average length of the polymer. Other methods for characterization of polymers where end-groups are used are mass spectrometry and vibrational spectrometry, like infrared and Raman spectrometry. Not only are these groups important for the analysis of the polymer, but they are also useful for grafting to and from a polymer chain to create a new copolymer. One example of an end group is in the polymer poly(ethylene glycol) <b>diacrylate</b> where the end-groups are circled.|$|E

40|$|A novel {{method for}} {{producing}} inexpensive polymeric pseudocrown ethers in situ during free-radical polymerizations was investigated using molecular dynamics simulations. This scheme {{is based upon}} a template ion and exploits the tendency of oligomeric ethylene glycol <b>diacrylates</b> to form intramolecular cycles during polymerization. In the scheme, a template ion is used to induce the poly(ethylene glycol) <b>diacrylates</b> (PEGDA) to assume cyclic structures before polymerization with a comonomer. Experimental studies demonstrated that certain salts that were insoluble in nonpolar solvents were solubilized upon the addition of oligomeric poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) due to complexation. Further evidence of cation binding by oligomeric PEG was obtained by H- 1 NMR studies of PEG and its complexes with metal salts. To optimize the template ion synthesis approach, molecular dynamics simulations were performed on PEGDA containing between two and ten ethylene glycol repeating units, with and without the presence of cations. Simulation {{results indicated that the}} presence of the templating cation significantly decreased the mean end-to-end distance, thereby bringing the unsaturated endgroups into close proximity. The PEGDA ligand that resulted in the most effective templatization for Na+ contained four ethylene glycol repeating units.

Film formation is also aided by the tin carboxylates being able to form an intermolecularly associated structure. The tin acrylates can be used in conjunction with prepolymers, e. g. an epoxidized soya bean oil (Synocure 3111) and a urethane acrylate (Synocure 3134). The tin acrylates are less effective than tripropyleneglycol <b>diacrylate</b> (TPGDA) in reducing the viscosity of the prepolymers.

40|$|We {{report the}} {{synthesis}} of branched acrylic copolymers based on 2 -hydroxypropyl acrylate using reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization in tert-butanol at 80 °C. Three branching comonomers were investigated in this study:[*] ethylene glycol <b>diacrylate,</b> bisphenol A ethoxylated <b>diacrylate</b> and a disulfide-based <b>diacrylate.</b> The latter comonomer allows chemical degradation of the branched acrylic copolymers to produce thiol-functionalized primary chains. Gel permeation chromatography analysis of these degraded copolymer chains indicated low polydispersities (Mw/Mn < 1. 22), which confirmed that the living character of the RAFT chemistry was retained under branching conditions. RAFT allows significantly more than one branching agent per primary chain {{to be used in}} the copolymerization without causing gelation. This result was obtained with all three branching comonomers and differs from the near-ideal copolymerizations previously reported for the ATRP synthesis of branched methacrylic copolymers (Macromolecules 2006, 39, 7483 − 7492). Detailed HPLC analysis of the RAFT copolymerization of 2 -hydroxypropyl acrylate with bisphenol A ethoxylated <b>diacrylate</b> indicates near-statistical incorporation of the latter comonomer. We suggest that intramolecular cyclization is the primary reason for the apparent violation of classical Flory−Stockmayer gelation theory.

The organic-inorganic hybrid hydrogels so prepared contained the inorganic crosslinker POSS from 1 to 28 wt. %. The degradation properties of the hydrogels in a pH 7. 4 phosphate-buffered saline solution at 37 °C were studied using measurements of mass loss, cryogenic SEM, and ATR-FTIR spectroscopy. It was found that copolymerization of acrylated 1 kPEG-lactide with increasing amounts of POSS created a more porous network which was more resistant to hydrolysis. The ATR-FTIR technique was used to monitor the progress of degradation with exposure time through {{the changes in the}} carbonyl and C-H deformation bands of the lactide and the Si-C stretching band of the POSS. Increasing POSS incorporation resulted in decreased rate of degradation due to its hydrophobic nature and inertness to hydrolysis.

As far as the pure PEGDA oligomers are concerned, the final double-bond conversion was always found to be complete, {{with the exception of the}} lowest MW oligomers. By using oligomers having MWs up to 1000, after the u. v. curing process, films having a completely amorphous structure were obtained. Oligomers having MWs higher than 1000 show, after curing, a partial PEG crystallinity. The Tg values of amorphous films were found to decrease by increasing the MW of the oligomer, i. e. by decreasing the crosslinking density of the network. Good agreement with the Nielsen equation was observed. The equilibrium swelling values in water were found to increase by increasing the oligomer MW. The investigation of mixtures of PEGDA oligomers with a typical epoxy acrylate resin confirms the above reported results as far as the double-bond conversion, the thermal and the dynamic-mechanical behaviour are concerned. By changing the oligomer MW it is possible to change the properties of the u. v. cured films over a broad rang...|$|R
40|$|The {{fabrication}} of hydrogel microstructures based upon poly(ethylene glycol) <b>diacrylates,</b> dimethacrylates, and tetraacrylates patterned photolithographically on silicon or glass substrates is described. A silicon/silicon dioxide surface {{was treated with}} 3 -(trichlorosilyl) propyl methacrylate to form a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) with pendant acrylate groups. The SAM presence on the surface was verified using ellipsometry and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry. A solution containing an acrylated or methacrylated poly(ethylene glycol) derivative and a photoinitiator (2, 2 -dimethoxy- 2 -phenylacetophenone) was spin-coated onto the treated substrate, exposed to 365 nm ultraviolet light through a photomask, and developed with either toluene, water, or supercritical CO 2. As {{a result of this}} process, three-dimensional, cross-linked PEG hydrogel microstructures were immobilized on the surface. Diameters of cylindrical array members were varied from 600 to 7 micrometers by the use of different photomasks, while height varied from 3 to 12 micrometers, depending on the molecular weight of the PEG macromer. In the case of 7 micrometers diameter elements, as many as 400 elements were reproducibly generated in a 1 mm 2 square pattern. The resultant hydrogel patterns were hydrated for as long as 3 weeks without delamination from the substrate. In addition, micropatterning of different molecular weights of PEG was demonstrated. Arrays of hydrogel disks containing an immobilized protein conjugated to a pH sensitive fluorophore were also prepared. The pH sensitivity of the gel-immobilized dye was similar to that in an aqueous buffer, and no leaching of the dye-labeled protein from the hydrogel microstructure was observed over a 1 week period. Changes in fluorescence were also observed for immobilized fluorophore labeled acetylcholine esterase upon the addition of acetyl acholine...|$|R
