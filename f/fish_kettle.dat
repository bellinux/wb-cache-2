50|$|Cross Fork is {{a former}} logging town in Potter County, Pennsylvania, United States. The village today is very small, but during the early 1900s it had a {{population}} numbering in the thousands and was an important lumbering center. Today, the Cross Fork area is known for trout <b>fishing</b> on <b>Kettle</b> Creek and Cross Fork Creek, including a children's fishing derby held annually in May.|$|R

500|$|The town of Inchelium, Washington, home {{to around}} 250 Colville Indians, was {{submerged}} and later relocated. Kettle Falls, once a primary Native American fishing grounds, was also inundated. The average catch of over 600,000 salmon per year was eliminated. In one study, the Army Corps of Engineers estimated the annual loss was over [...] fish. In , the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation hosted a three-day event called the [...] "Ceremony of Tears," [...] marking {{the end of}} <b>fishing</b> at <b>Kettle</b> Falls. Within {{a year after the}} Ceremony, the falls were inundated. The town of Kettle Falls, Washington, was relocated.|$|R
50|$|The {{mouth of}} Popes Creek is plugged by a flood-tide delta {{making it an}} {{efficient}} trap for sediment and enriched run-off from three primary sources: farmed watersheds consisting of broad terraces and open upland slopes, erosion of the bluffs and beaches of the Potomac, and the creek bluff erosion itself. Agriculturally derived fill deposited in adjacent ravines {{to a depth of}} 2 meters is found covering stumps from the 17th century. Beaver dams and ponds dot the flood plains as well as several old mill ponds which interrupt the flow. Historically, the navigation of the creek has been limited to shallow-draft vessels with present depth up to one meter augmented by 0.3 to 0.4 meter tide. The tributary continues to shoal as the sea level rises driving Potomac silt more than a kilometer inland. Core drilling in the delta has indicated 15 meters of mollusk-bearing sediment, over peat and sand deposits dating back over 6000 years. The taking of oysters is abundantly evident. Aboriginal shell middens were found during archeological excavations, post structure and land preparation for the Visitors’ Center at the site of George Washington’s birthplace. The 18th century refuse pit at the birthplace containing food garbage yielded shucked oyster shells as well. Fishing at the creek mouth is highlighted by the white perch run. In Captain John Smith’s explorations the fish were so thick their heads stuck out of water, prompting his men to attempt to catch them in a frying pan. The entrance to the smaller estuaries would be clogged during spring migrations including shad runs. Later colonial inventories of the Popes Creek plantation list seine corks, lead, seine rope, a knot of perch lines, yielding to the more than adequate kitchen utensil, or <b>fish</b> <b>kettle,</b> serving up the local delicacy.|$|E
5000|$|There are Archaic (moa hunter) Māori {{sites on}} Strath Taieri, also {{downstream}} on the Taieri Gorge and at Deep Stream and Rocklands on the adjacent plateau to the south. [...] A principal Māori route {{from the coast}} to the interior lay along the valley. A cave {{was found in the}} district with its entrance blocked containing the bodies of a Māori woman and child. It is not clear if they were trapped deliberately or by accident. The remains have been associated with the later Classic period of which type there are several sites in the area. There are rock shelters with mostly domestic articles, wooden bowls, material for garments and gear for hunting weka or <b>fishing.</b> Charles <b>Kettle</b> saw the area from the top of Maungatua in 1847 and was impressed by the land's pastoral potential.|$|R
2500|$|Reyes' 2002 memoir White Grizzly Bear's Legacy: Learning to be Indian {{combines}} his own {{memories and}} research with notes from library and field research (including taped interviews) done {{by his mother}} before her death in a traffic accident in May 1978. Among other things, it describes traditional tribal <b>fishing</b> at <b>Kettle</b> Falls on the Columbia River and living in Inchelium, Washington at its old site. Both Kettle Falls and Old Inchelium were later flooded by the rising waters after the construction of Grand Coulee Dam (which also prevented salmon from reaching the Upper Columbia). His book also described the forced changes {{of life for the}} Sin Aikst/Lakes as conditions forced them away from traditional patterns and how they worked to preserve elements of their traditions. He explored the ambiguous [...] effect of institutions such as the Chemawa Indian School circa 1940, which simultaneously acculturated natives to the majority American culture while inspiring a sense of [...] "Indianness," [...] rather than affiliation with only individual tribes.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Kettle</b> of <b>Fish</b> (88-98) is {{the title}} of a {{compilation}} album by Fish released in 1998, providing a retrospective on his solo career plus two new songs. Unlike the previous best-of Yin and Yang (1995), this is a single disc and does not include any Marillion material. <b>Kettle</b> of <b>Fish</b> was Fish's first release under a new contract with Roadrunner Records, who signed Fish after the financially catastrophic Sunsets on Empire album and tour of 1997 had forced him to dissolve his own label Dick Brothers Record Company. (The Dick Bros. logo still appears on the back, but this appears to be strictly symbolical.) Roadrunner also re-released <b>Fish's</b> entire backcatalogue; <b>Kettle</b> of <b>Fish</b> was intended to draw attention to these titles, which explains the publication of another [...] "best-of" [...] compilation with just one studio album between this and the last one. The album was accompanied by an eponymous collection of video clips with slightly different tracks (see below). In Europe, the limited first edition of the album included a bonus CD-ROM with three videos and additional material.|$|R
25|$|Kane {{continued}} with one guide by horseback through the Grande Coulée to Fort Colvile, where he stayed for six weeks, sketching and painting the natives who {{had set up}} a <b>fishing</b> camp below <b>Kettle</b> Falls {{at this time of the}} salmon run. On September 22, 1847, Kane assumed command of a canoe brigade up the Columbia River and arrived on October 10 at Boat Encampment. The party had to wait for three weeks until a badly delayed horse trek from Jasper arrived. Then they switched, the horse team taking over the canoes and going down the Columbia River, and Kane's group loading their cargo on the horses and taking them back over Athabasca Pass. They managed to bring all 56 horses safely and without loss to Jasper's House, despite the heavy snow and intense cold. As the canoes that should have been awaiting them had already left, they were forced to set out on snowshoes and with a dog sled to Fort Assiniboine, where they arrived after much hardship and without food two weeks later. After a few days' rest, they continued to Fort Edmonton, where they spent the winter.|$|R
