40|$|In {{this study}} optical {{transmission}} measurements were performed in-situ during {{the growth of}} microcrystalline silicon (μc-Si:H) layers by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). The stable plasma emission was used as light source. The <b>effective</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>coefficient</b> of the thin μc-Si:H layers which were deposited on rough transparent conductive oxide (TCO) surfaces was calculated from the transient transmission signal. It was observed that by increasing the surface roughness of the TCO, the <b>effective</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>coefficient</b> increases which can be correlated to the increased light scattering effect and thus the enhanced light paths inside the silicon. A correlation between the in-situ determined effective absorbance of the μc-Si:H absorber layer and the short-circuit current density of μc-Si:H thin-film silicon solar cells was found. Hence, an attractive technique is demonstrated to study, on the one hand, the absorbance and the light trapping in thin films depending on the roughness of the substrate and, on the other hand, to estimate the short-circuit current density of thin-film solar cells in-situ, which makes the method interesting as a process control tool...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of {{the thickness of the}} nanostructured, mesoporous TiO 2 film on several parameters determining the performance of a dye-sensitized solar cell is investigated both experimentally and theoretically. We pay special attention to the effect of the exchange current density in the dark, and we compare the values obtained by steady state measurements with values extracted from small perturbation techniques. We also evaluate the {{influence of}} exchange current density, the solar cell ideality factor, and the <b>effective</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>coefficient</b> of the cell on the optimal film thickness. The results show that the exchange current density in the dark is proportional to the TiO 2 film thickness, however, the <b>effective</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>coefficient</b> is the parameter that ultimately defines the ideal thickness. We illustrate the importance of the exchange current density in the dark on the determination of the current–voltage characteristics and we show how an important improvement of the cell performance can be achieved by decreasing values of the total series resistance and the exchange current density in the dark...|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn this work, we {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} KrF nanosecond laser ablation on poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) in combination with pyrene. Three materials containing PMMA were studied: (1) one doped with pure pyrene, (2) one doped with methyl 3 -(1 -pyrenyl) propanoate (so called alkylpyrene derivative thereafter), and (3) one grafted with pyrene. This last new material was developed by covalently bonding pyrene molecules to PMMA side-chains. A comparative study was undertaken to determine and compare the respective properties of the PMMA dye containing pyrene during nanosecond laser ablation at 248 nm. Cavities were etched for each material with up to 20 pulses for fluences between 0. 03 and 1. 7 J/cm(2) in samples containing 1, 2, and 4 mol % chromophore. The threshold fluences and the <b>effective</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>coefficients</b> were obtained. It was observed that <b>effective</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>coefficients</b> increased and threshold fluences decreased with the chromophore percentages in each kind of sample. Ablation parameters were not significantly modified when the dopant was changed from pyrene to the alkylpyrene derivative. On the other hand, when pyrene molecules were grafted on the polymer, the threshold fluences decreased, whereas the <b>effective</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>coefficients</b> became similar at fluences above 0. 6 J/cm(2) ...|$|R

40|$|In the {{framework}} of a two-moment photo-hydrodynamic modelling of radiation transport, we introduce a concept for the determination of effective radiation transport coefficients based on the minimization of the local entropy production rate of radiation and matter. The method provides the nonequilibrium photon distribution from which the <b>effective</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>coefficients</b> and the variable Eddington factor (VEF) can be calculated. The photon distribution depends on the frequency dependence of the <b>absorption</b> <b>coefficient,</b> in contrast to the distribution obtained by methods based on entropy maximization. The calculated mean <b>absorption</b> <b>coefficients</b> are not only correct in the limit of optically thick and thin media, but even provide a reasonable interpolation in the cross-over regime between these limits, notably without introducing any fit parameter.

40|$|Mimicking green plants' and bacteria's {{extraordinary}} {{ability to}} absorb {{a vast number}} of photons and harness their energy is a longstanding goal in artificial photosynthesis. Resonance energy transfer among donor dyes has been shown to play a crucial role on the overall transfer of energy in the natural systems. Here, we present artificial, self-assembled, light-harvesting complexes consisting of DNA scaffolds, intercalated YO-PRO- 1 (YO) donor dyes and a porphyrin acceptor anchored to a lipid bilayer, conceptually mimicking the natural light-harvesting systems. A model system consisting of 39 -mer duplex DNA in a linear wire configuration with the porphyrin attached {{in the middle of the}} wire is primarily investigated. Utilizing intercalated donor fluorophores to sensitize the excitation of the porphyrin acceptor, we obtain an <b>effective</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>coefficient</b> 12 times larger than for direct excitation of the porphyrin. On the basis of steady-state and time-resolved emission measurements and Markov chain simulations, we show that YO-to-YO resonance energy transfer substantially contributes to the overall flow of energy to the porphyrin. This increase is explained through energy migration along the wire allowing the excited state energy to transfer to positions closer to the porphyrin. The versatility of DNA as a structural material is demonstrated through the construction of a more complex, hexagonal, light-harvesting scaffold yielding further increase in the <b>effective</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>coefficient.</b> Our results show that, by using DNA as a scaffold, we are able to arrange chromophores on a nanometer scale and in this way facilitate the assembly of efficient light-harvesting systems...|$|E
40|$|The {{absorption}} of incident laser beam is important when {{the quality of}} the laser machining is concerned, since the surface plasma acts as a medium between the workpiece and a laser beam.
