5|$|In this treatise, Archimedes {{counts the}} number of <b>grains</b> <b>of</b> <b>sand</b> that will fit inside the universe. This book {{mentions}} the heliocentric theory {{of the solar system}} proposed by Aristarchus of Samos, as well as contemporary ideas {{about the size of the}} Earth and the distance between various celestial bodies. By using a system of numbers based on powers of the myriad, Archimedes concludes that {{the number of}} <b>grains</b> <b>of</b> <b>sand</b> required to fill the universe is 8 in modern notation. The introductory letter states that Archimedes' father was an astronomer named Phidias. The Sand Reckoner or Psammites is the only surviving work in which Archimedes discusses his views on astronomy.|$|E
5|$|Oolitic sand: The {{lake and}} its shores contain oolitic sand, which are small, rounded, or spherical <b>grains</b> <b>of</b> <b>sand</b> {{made up of}} a nucleus (generally a small mineral grain) and {{concentric}} layers of calcium carbonate (lime) and look similar to very small pearls.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species have}} paired {{cerebral}} organs, sacs whose only openings {{are to the}} outside. Others species have unpaired evertible organs {{on the front of}} their heads. Some have slits {{along the side of the}} head or grooves obliquely across the head, and these may be associated with paired cerebral organs. All of these are thought to be chemoreceptors, and the cerebral organs may also aiding osmoregulation. Small pits in the epidermis appear to be sensors. On their head some species have a number of pigment-cup ocelli, which can detect light but not form an image. Most nemerteans have two to six ocelli, although some have hundreds. A few tiny species that live between <b>grains</b> <b>of</b> <b>sand</b> have statocysts, which sense balance.|$|E

5|$|Sand dunes are accumulations of {{windblown sand}} {{piled up in}} mounds or ridges. They form {{downwind}} of copious sources of dry, loose sand and occur when topographic and climatic conditions cause airborne particles to settle. As the wind blows, saltation and creep {{take place on the}} windward side of the dune and individual <b>grains</b> <b>of</b> <b>sand</b> move uphill. When they reach the crest, they cascade down the far side. The upwind slope typically has a gradient of 10° to 20° while the lee slope is around 32°, the angle at which loose dry sand will slip. As this wind-induced movement of sand grains takes place, the dune moves slowly {{across the surface of the}} ground. Dunes are sometimes solitary, but they are more often grouped together in dune fields. When these are extensive, they are known as sand seas or ergs.|$|E
5|$|The {{case is a}} tubular {{structure}} made of silk, secreted from salivary glands {{near the mouth of}} the larva, and is started soon after the egg hatches. Various reinforcements may be incorporated into its structure, the nature of the materials and design depending on the larva's genetic makeup; this means that caddifly larvae can be recognised by their cases down to family, and even genus level. The materials used include <b>grains</b> <b>of</b> <b>sand,</b> larger fragments of rock, bark, sticks, leaves, seeds and mollusc shells. These are neatly arranged and stuck onto the outer surface of the silken tube. As the larva grows, more material is added at the front, and the larva can turn round in the tube and trim the rear end so that it does not drag along the substrate.|$|E
5|$|FitzRoy's {{instructions}} set {{detailed requirements}} for geological survey of a circular coral atoll to investigate how coral reefs formed, {{particularly if they}} rose {{from the bottom of}} the sea or from the summits of extinct volcanoes, and to assess the effects of tides by measurement with specially constructed gauges. FitzRoy chose the Keeling Islands in the Indian Ocean, and on arrival there on 1 April 1836, the entire crew set to work, first erecting FitzRoy's new design of a tide gauge that allowed readings to be taken from the shore. Boats were sent all around the island to carry out the survey, and despite being impeded by strong winds, they took numerous soundings to establish depths around the atoll and in the lagoon. FitzRoy noted the smooth and solid rock-like outer wall of the atoll, with most life thriving where the surf was most violent. He had great difficulty in establishing the depth reached by living coral, as pieces were hard to break off and the small anchors, hooks, grappling irons, and chains they used were all snapped off by the swell as soon as they tried to pull them up. He had more success using a sounding line with a bell-shaped lead weight armed with tallow hardened with lime; this would be indented by any shape that it struck to give an exact impression of the bottom; it would also collect any fragments of coral or <b>grains</b> <b>of</b> <b>sand.</b>|$|E

25|$|Various {{attempts}} for refloating {{the ship}} were suggested. University of Sydney Honorary Associate Professor Rob Wheen suggested liquefying the sand under the ship by pumping seawater into it. This liquefaction should reduce the friction between <b>grains</b> <b>of</b> <b>sand</b> and in turn, {{friction between the}} ship and sand. Whether {{this would have been}} effective in this case is unknown as Pasha Bulker was lying on rock as well as sand and the ship would have had to be pulled up and over the rocks.|$|E

25|$|A {{more subtle}} form of scale {{symmetry}} {{is demonstrated by}} fractals. As conceived by Benoît Mandelbrot, fractals are a mathematical concept in which {{the structure of a}} complex form looks similar at any degree of magnification, well seen in the Mandelbrot set. A coast {{is an example of a}} naturally occurring fractal, since it retains similar-appearing complexity at every level from the view of a satellite to a microscopic examination of how the water laps up against individual <b>grains</b> <b>of</b> <b>sand.</b> The branching of trees, which enables small twigs to stand in for full trees in dioramas, is another example.|$|E
25|$|The {{observable}} universe is a spherical {{region of the}} Universe comprising all matter that can be observed from Earth at the present time, because electromagnetic radiation from these objects {{have had time to}} reach Earth {{since the beginning of the}} cosmological expansion. There are at least 2 trillion galaxies in the {{observable universe}}, containing more stars than all the <b>grains</b> <b>of</b> <b>sand</b> on planet Earth. Assuming the Universe is isotropic, the distance to the edge of the observable universe is roughly the same in every direction. That is, the observable universe is a spherical volume (a ball) centered on the observer. Every location in the Universe has its own observable universe, which may or may not overlap with the one centered on Earth.|$|E

This means that the highest part of the visible lines almost always faces approximately south. It is a very porous stone and acts as a giant filter. It is composed of very pure silica grains and {{a small amount of}} the iron mineral siderite in varying proportions, bound with a clay matrix. It oxidises to the warm yellow-brown colour that is notable in the buildings which are constructed of it.|$|E

25|$|Following the 1968 {{publication}} of Nova, {{there was not}} only a large gap in Delany's published work (after releasing eight novels and a novella between 1962 and 1968, Delany's published output virtually stopped until 1973), there was also a notable addition to the themes found in the stories published after that time. It was at this point that Delany began dealing with sexual themes to an extent rarely equaled in serious writing. Dhalgren and Stars in My Pocket Like <b>Grains</b> <b>of</b> <b>Sand</b> include several sexually explicit passages, and several of his books such as Equinox (originally published as The Tides of Lust, a title that Delany does not endorse), The Mad Man, Hogg and, Phallos can be considered pornography, a label Delany himself endorses.|$|E
25|$|Delany's {{eleventh}} {{and most}} popular novel, the million-plus-selling Dhalgren, {{was published in}} 1975 to both literary acclaim (from {{both inside and outside}} the science fiction community) and derision (mostly from within the community). Upon its publication, Delany returned to the United States at the behest of Leslie Fiedler to teach at the University at Buffalo as Butler Professor of English in the spring of 1975, preceding his permanent return to New York City that summer. Though he wrote two more major science fiction novels (Triton and Stars in My Pocket Like <b>Grains</b> <b>of</b> <b>Sand)</b> in the decade following Dhalgren, Delany began to work in fantasy and science fiction criticism for several years. His main literary project through the late 1970s and 1980s was the Return to Nevèrÿon series, the overall title of the four volumes and also the title of the fourth and final book. Following the publication of the Return to Nevèrÿon series, Delany published one more fantasy novel. Released in 1993, They Fly at Çiron is a re-written and expanded version of an unpublished short story Delany wrote in 1962. This would be Delany's last novel in either the science fiction or fantasy genres for many years.|$|E
500|$|In The Sand Reckoner, Archimedes {{set out to}} {{calculate}} the number of <b>grains</b> <b>of</b> <b>sand</b> that the universe could contain. In doing so, he challenged {{the notion that the}} number of <b>grains</b> <b>of</b> <b>sand</b> was too large to be counted. He wrote: [...] "There are some, King Gelo (Gelo II, son of Hiero II), who think that the number of the sand is infinite in multitude; and I mean by the sand not only that which exists about Syracuse and the rest of Sicily but also that which is found in every region whether inhabited or uninhabited." [...] To solve the problem, Archimedes devised a system of counting based on the myriad. The word is from the Greek [...] murias, for the number 10,000. He proposed a number system using powers of a myriad of myriads (100 million) and concluded that the number of <b>grains</b> <b>of</b> <b>sand</b> required to fill the universe would be 8 vigintillion, or 8.|$|E
