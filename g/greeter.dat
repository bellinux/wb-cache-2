5|$|In {{the summer}} and fall of 2011, several renovations took place, {{affecting}} primarily the high school. All front-facing windows of the high school were replaced with energy-efficient windows, and a permanent-storage building was constructed on the northeast side to store auditorium and maintenance supplies. In addition, many of the computers in the school were replaced with thin client computers. In 2013, the school's cardiovascular and weight lifting center was improved with more machines and equipment, increased space, new flat screen televisions, and other additions. In 2013 and 2014, the school's fields on the property were remediated due to the use of contaminated fill. The football field was completed with artificial turf, as well as the track and artificial turf baseball field; an artificial turf hockey field was to be completed by Labor Day. The lower soccer field will be reconstructed after the fall 2014 soccer season. Work on the softball field was finished in fall 2013. A security plan is to be submitted to the New York State Education Department; it includes plans to upgrade the main entrance doors and construct vestibules and <b>greeter</b> stations.|$|E

He married his dental hygienist, Betty, in Beverly Hills and had one daughter. His last wife, Rita, is the sister of Andre Agassi, and they had two children. According to Price's article, Rita's father, Mike Agassi, a 1952 Olympian on the Iranian boxing team who had become a successful casino <b>greeter</b> in Las Vegas, hated Gonzales {{so much that he}} considered having him killed. Gonzales had coached the young Rita until she had rebelled against her father's 5,000-balls-a-day-regimen and first moved in with, then married, on March 31, 1984, the much older Gonzales. Years before, Mike Agassi, already a tennis fanatic, had once served as a linesman for one of Gonzales's professional matches in Chicago.

500|$|Adams {{was educated}} at the Douglas County High School. She was not academically inclined, but was {{interested}} in the creative arts and sang in the school choir. Although she competed in track and gymnastics, she harbored ambitions of becoming a ballerina and trained as an apprentice at the local David Taylor Dance Company. She disliked her experience in high school and kept mostly to herself. After her graduation, she moved to Atlanta with her mother. She did not intend to go to college, which disappointed her parents, and she later regretted not getting more of an education. Realizing, at age 18, that she was not gifted enough to be a professional ballerina, Adams inclined towards musical theater, which she found was [...] "much better suited to [...] personality". One of her first jobs was in a community theater production of Annie, but she made no money in it. To support herself, Adams worked as a <b>greeter</b> at a Gap store. She also {{took a job as a}} waitress at Hooters, where she had to work wearing tight gym outfits, and customers frequently misbehaved with her. Adams left the job soon after she had saved enough money to buy a used car.|$|E
500|$|The {{voice of}} a guest at the tanning-party which Stewie is hosting was {{provided}} by Mike Barker. David A. Goodman comments on the DVD commentary that [...] "It's nice to hear Mike Barker back on Family Guy.," [...] as Barker had performed multiple voices of characters in previous episodes. Peter asking [...] "I'm going to prison, aren't I?" [...] when hiding in the tree after beating up Chris's bully caused {{a little bit of}} trouble for the show, though it was never edited when aired on TV. A sketch had been created showing Brian falling asleep when watching Late Night with Bib Fortuna while Stewie was still in the tanning booth, but it did not seem good enough to air, so it was never broadcast. When Stewie is being sprayed by Brian with sun-screen, Ralph Furley enters the room and mistakenly thinks he sees Brian ejaculating on Stewie. The cream was originally intended to keep squirting out of the bottle as if Brian were continuing to ejaculate despite Mr. Furley's presence, but the animation didn't look right and was removed. MacFarlane comments that he was amazed that broadcasting standards allowed them to get away with the scene, even though Brian's line, [...] "This isn't what it looks like" [...] was edited to keep the ejaculation illusion from being blatant (the TV version goes from Mr. Furley yelling, [...] "Brian" [...] and Brian reacting to Mr. Furley running out and saying, [...] "Never mind, I'll come back later!"). A deleted scene was made and designed to happen directly after Peter sickens Meg by farting in her face in which Peter steals Chris's lunch money and runs for the bus. The gag showing Dick Cheney as a Wal-Mart <b>greeter</b> had Cheney's greeting, [...] "Go fuck yourself" [...] bleeped out on TV, but not DVD. Peter falling to the floor after being pushed away from hitting Randy by Chris was very difficult to do, as it is difficult to do slow-motion in animation. The DVD version includes an extra scene in the car, in which Peter shows Chris how he looks like an anus by wearing a hoodie, pulling the hood on the drawstring tight around his mouth, and pushing a chocolate candy bar out of the hole to simulate defecation.|$|E

Hall of Famer Willie Mays, who had also taken a similar position, had already had action taken against him. Mantle accepted the position, regardless, as he felt the rule was [...] "stupid."

Prior to his death, Steve {{was an active}} part of the rebellion against the Devil. He chose the more passive path of rebellion over Tony's aggressive route, but still stood by him regardless. It is revealed in the first-season finale that Steve is still [...] "alive", and is now an angel (again). Subsequently, other demons follow 'The Way of Steve' {{in an attempt to}} emulate his path to Heaven. Steve appears to a human being to convince him to abandon the path to Hell. In [...] "The Devil and Sam Oliver," [...] he works as an unseen guardian angel to a klutzy Work Bench <b>greeter.</b> He appears to Sam and helps him translate symbols necessary to summon the Devil, but apparently misreads them. In the season two finale, when Sam appears ready to win a contest against the Devil, Steve breaks his hand and claims he's acting on orders from Heaven, and earns his wings as a full-fledged angel as a result.|$|E

He won with 59% of the vote in a field of ten candidates. The political left had hoped for some of the more progressive politics from Brown's earlier governorship, but found Brown [...] "more pragmatic than progressive, more interested in downtown redevelopment and economic growth than political ideology". As mayor, he invited the U.S. Marine Corps to use Oakland harbor lands for mock military exercises as part of Operation Urban Warrior.|$|E
