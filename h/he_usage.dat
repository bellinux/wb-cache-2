These nutrients can be artificially increased by <b>he</b> <b>usage</b> of fertilizers. A machine that helps to feed plants with fertilizers {{will be a great}} source to increase the rate of agriculture. Our machine is designed to meet these needs. Solid and powder fertilizers can be fed to plants by our machine. Fertilizers of different sizes can be served with this single machine. The main advantage of this machine is that dimensions of the machine can be adjustable according to the requirement...|$|E

40|$|As VLSI {{technology}} {{enters the}} nanometer era, the supply voltage is continually dropped. This condition helps {{to reduce the}} power dissipation, but make the power integrity problem become worse. Employing decoupling capacitances (decap) at floorplan stage has been a common approach to alleviate the supply noise problem. However, the decap budget is often overly estimated in previous researches. Besides the decap budget computation, the available floorplan space does not fully used in previous works. In one floorplan, it usually has many available spaces except the empty space {{that could be used}} to insert the decap without increasing the floorplan area. Therefore, our goal in this work is to develop a better model to calculate the required decap to solve the power supply noise problem of area-array based designs and to increase <b>he</b> <b>usage</b> of the available space in the floorplan to reduce the area overhead caused by decap insertion. The experimental results are encouraging. Compared with other approaches, our algorithm can reduce 52. 6 % decap budget on the MCNC benchmarks but still keep the power supply noise in the given constraint. The final floorplan areas with decap are also less than the numbers reported in previous papers...|$|E
