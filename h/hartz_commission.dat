40|$|In 2003 Chancellor Schroeder {{launched}} an ambitious structural reform package (Agenda 2010), that simultaneously reformed the pension {{system and the}} labour market (following the proposition of the <b>Hartz</b> <b>commission</b> report, of August 2002). This program reinforced a trend already visible since the year 2000, aimed at increasing competitiveness of the German economy by reducing production costs. This effort was rather successful, as figure 1 shows ( [...] .) ...|$|E
30|$|Germany {{experienced}} {{high unemployment}} rates of almost 10 percent between 1993 and 2004. By contrast, U.S. unemployment was about 5 percent. By 2004, almost 4.5 million Germans were unemployed {{according to the}} Federal Labor Agency. Less-skilled and older workers had higher unemployment rates; vocational school graduates and high school dropouts had unemployment rates of about 18 percent. In February 2002, the so-called <b>Hartz</b> <b>commission</b> suggested ways to modernize the labor market: improve employment services and active labor market programs, reform unemployment and social assistance benefit programs, and foster employment by deregulating the labor market.|$|E
30|$|The reforms raise several questions. First, {{given the}} {{difficulty}} of comprehensive labor reforms, does a partial liberalization targeted at some groups or sectors work? Second, do allowances in the labor code for more flexible forms of employment lead to a “two-tier” market and a legally sanctioned underclass? Third, do flexible and temporary forms of employment serve as a step toward advancement, or are people who enter through a midi- or mini-job experience scarred in ways that limit their future options? Germany’s experience appears to be promising, but these doubts will be raised in countries that try to adopt strategies {{similar to the one}} proposed by the <b>Hartz</b> <b>Commission.</b>|$|E
30|$|Empirical {{findings}} {{for the early}} 2000 s in Germany reveal high and persistent unemployment that was independent of the business cycle (Klinger and Rothe 2012). Furthermore, there were discussions regarding opportunities to measure the efforts of public job placement services {{and to make the}} job placement organisation more efficient. Therefore, the government stipulated four laws that were implemented in three waves in 2003, 2004 and 2005. In doing so, the government considered the working results of an expert commission, the so-called <b>Hartz</b> <b>commission.</b> Each of the Hartz I to IV reform laws consisted of various components that refer to the organisation and rules of the labour market. Essentially, three elements of these reforms aimed at an increase of the job-finding rate of unemployed workers: raising the effectiveness and efficiency of the Federal Employment Agency; more activation and higher self-responsibility of the unemployed (principle of ‘Promoting and demanding’); 2 easing of labour market policy (see for further details, e.g. Bieber et al. 2005; Jacobi and Kluve 2007; Klinger and Rothe 2012; Ochel 2005).|$|E
40|$|We {{compare the}} Hartz reforms in Germany {{with three other}} major labor market {{activation}} reforms carried out by center-left governments. Britain and Germany developed radically neoliberal “mandatory” activation policies, whereas in the Netherlands and Ireland radical activation change took a very different “enabling” form. The Irish and German cases were path deviant, the British and Dutch path dependent. We explain why Germany underwent “mandatory” and path deviant activation by focusing on two features of the policy discourse. First, the elite level discourse was “ensilaged” sealing policy formation off from dissenting actors. This is what the British and German cases had in common {{and the result was}} reform that identified long term unemployment as social delinquency rather than market failure. Second, although the German policy-making system lacked the “authoritative” features that facilitated reform in the British case, and the Irish policy-making system lacked the “reflexive” mechanisms that facilitated reform in the Dutch case, in both Germany and Ireland the wider legitimating discourses were reshaped by novel institutional vehicles (the <b>Hartz</b> <b>Commission</b> and FÁS) that served to fundamentally alter system-constitutive perceptions about policy.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we compare the Hartz reforms in Germany {{with three other}} major labor market {{activation}} reforms carried out by center-left governments. Two of the cases, Britain and Germany, involved radically neoliberal “mandatory ” activation policies, whereas in the Netherlands and Ireland radical activation change took a very different “enabling ” form. Two of the cases, Ireland and Germany, were path deviant, Britain and the Netherlands were path dependent. We explain why Germany underwent “mandatory ” and path deviant activation by focusing on two features of the policy discourse. First, the coordinative (or elite level) discourse was “ensilaged ” sealing policy formation off from dissenting actors and, until belatedly unwrapped for enactment, from the wider communicative (legitimating) discourse. This is what the British and German cases had in common {{and the result was}} reform that viewed long term unemployment as personal failure rather than market failure. Second, although the German policy-making system lacked the “authoritative ” features that facilitated reform in the British case, and the Irish policy-making system lacked the “reflexive ” mechanisms that facilitated reform in the Dutch case, in both Germany and Ireland the communicative discourses were reshaped by novel institutional vehicles (the <b>Hartz</b> <b>Commission</b> in the German case, FÁS in the Irish case) that served to fundamentally alter system-constitutive perceptions about policy. In the Irish and German cases “government by commission” created a realignment of advocacy coalitions with one coalition acquiring a new, ideologically-dominant and path deviating narrative. The findings suggest that major reform of labor market and welfare state policy may be much more malleable than previously thought. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{recent changes}} {{in the role of}} the German state in relation to welfare and housing and, to a lesser extent, recent state initiatives in tackling homelessness. The analysis leads to the conclusion that some of more radical changes apparent in other European countries are less relevant in the German context because the role of the central state (after the war) was never as strong as in some other countries, and because the German state (including the local state) has traditionally been less important as a direct provider of services and housing. While we can confirm a roll back of the state in the area of housing, {{recent changes in}} regard to welfare provision for unemployed and poor people are illustrative of'regulatory restructuring’and of a'roll out’of state intervention (Peck and Tickell 2002). At the same time as earnings-related elements of social security systems are being reduced and means-tested benefit systems are gaining in importance, a number of new techniques, sanctions and obligatory measures to promote activation and workfare have been introduced, thereby modernizing, intensifying and individualizing the influence of public administration on unemployed and poor citizens. The reform of the basic-income schemes following on the <b>Hartz</b> <b>Commission</b> recommendations will also lead to significant shifts of financial and administrative responsibilities between central, regional and local levels of the state. The responsibility for bearing the housing costs of long-term unemployed people will no longer be shared by all three state levels but become the sole responsibility of local authorities. However, with constantly shrinking powers to influence supply and allocation of housing, local authorities are not in a good position for taking over this responsibility. Germany, homelessness, housing, welfare reform, role of the state,...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, I {{examine the}} {{importance}} of ideas in causing institutional change in {{the political economy of}} Germany through government commissions. In doing so, the thesis addresses an important issue in the political science literature on institutions, namely to explain how transformative institutional change is possible in an institutional system that favours incremental change along a well-circumscribed institutional path. While institutional theorists have become adept at explaining institutional reproduction and stability, they find it difficult to conceptualise empirical instances of rapid institutional change. The purpose of this thesis is to provide a coherent theoretical explanation of transfonnative as well as evolutionary institutional change with reference to the causal importance of the ideas actors hold and to test this explanation with two detailed case studies. The case studies have been drawn from two instances of institutional change in the political economy of Germany between 1998 and 2005. Germany provides a particularly relevant test case as scholars, particularly proponents of the Varieties of Capitalism framework, have stressed the stability of the institutions of its political economy, arguing that they support distinct production regimes and generate comparative advantage that economic actors will want to preserve. This research found that the extent of institutional change depends on the commonality and specificity of the ideas embraced by actors. The more specific and the more widely shared the D, (4 new ideas, the more transformative the change in the political economy. I show that government commissions {{play an important role in}} institutional change by allowing actors to embrace new ideas and engage in problem-solving beyond their traditional interests, while legitimising their proposals. The case of the Bruhl Commission is an example of how a high level of commonality of new ideas led the commission to make recommendations that eventually amounted to transformative institutional change in Germany, i. e. the dissolution O"f 1 :iie 'Deutschland AG' or the network of interlocking cross-shareholdings of German films considered to be one of the founding pillars of Germany's political economy. The case study of the <b>Hartz</b> <b>Commission</b> shows how a lack of commonality of ideas among members of the commission resulted in recommendations that had a limited impact on changing unemployment protection in Germany and amounted to evolutionary institutional change.
