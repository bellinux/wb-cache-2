5|$|In 1953 Gielgud {{made his}} first Hollywood film, the sole {{classical}} actor in Joseph L. Mankiewicz's Julius Caesar, playing Cassius. Marlon Brando (Mark Antony) was <b>in</b> <b>awe</b> of him, and James Mason (Brutus) was disheartened at Gielgud's seemingly effortless skill. Gielgud, for his part, felt he learned much about film technique from Mason. Gielgud enjoyed his four-month stay in California, not least, as Morley comments, for the relaxed attitude there to homosexuality.|$|E
5|$|Later, Scully and Mulder meet Doggett, who has now fully recovered, at the hospital. He {{tells them}} that Harrison {{will make a}} full {{recovery}} as well but that she is transferring herself off of the X-Files. Mulder attempts to give Doggett the Apollo medallion, but Doggett insists that it be given to Harrison instead. Mulder and Scully then present it to Harrison together, who accepts it <b>in</b> <b>awe.</b>|$|E
5|$|Salih quickly {{gained the}} {{allegiance}} {{of the entire}} body of Kilab, who were <b>in</b> <b>awe</b> of his escape, and moved against Aleppo. Mansur's ghilmān staved off Salih's forces at Aleppo's outskirts, encouraging Mansur to assemble a larger army composed of his ghilmān, craftsmen from the suq and men from Aleppo's lower-class neighborhoods, including many Christians and Jews. On 13 August, Salih routed the Aleppine force, killing some 2,000 of Mansur's soldiers, and capturing Mansur and his senior commanders.|$|E

5|$|Their {{first two}} days at sea are {{unproductive}} and they return to port each night. On the third day, Hooper wants to bring along a shark proof cage. Initially Quint refuses, considering it a suicidal idea, but he relents when Hooper offers him a hundred dollars. On the ocean, the shark finally shows up. Hooper guesses the animal {{must be at least}} twenty feet long, and is visibly excited and <b>in</b> <b>awe.</b> After several unsuccessful attempts by Quint to harpoon the shark, Hooper goes underwater in the cage. He resolves to first take photos of the shark, before trying to kill it with a bang stick. However, the shark attacks the cage, and, after ramming the bars apart, kills and eats Hooper.|$|E
25|$|Jandamarra {{was held}} <b>in</b> <b>awe</b> by other Aboriginal people who {{believed}} he was immortal, his body simply a physical manifestation of a spirit that resided in a water soak near Tunnel Creek. It was believed that only an Aboriginal person with similar mystical powers could kill him. Police chasing Jandamarra were also <b>in</b> <b>awe</b> at his ability to cross the rugged ranges with no effect on his bare feet, despite their boots being cut to shreds by the sharp rocks.|$|E

60|$|Maud gazed unrecognizingly {{upon her}} nearest girl friends. They seemed {{something}} alien in that moment; and they, gazing upon her white face and unrecognizing eyes, spoke <b>in</b> <b>awed</b> whispers.|$|R
60|$|But that bid for glory was a failure. Most of {{the boys}} could say that, and so that cheapened the {{distinction}} too much. The group loitered away, still recalling memories of the lost heroes, <b>in</b> <b>awed</b> voices.|$|R
25|$|It is Christmas Eve. Family {{and friends}} have {{gathered}} in the parlor to decorate the beautiful Christmas tree {{in preparation for the}} party. Once the tree is finished, the children are sent for. They stand <b>in</b> <b>awe</b> of the tree sparkling with candles and decorations.|$|E
25|$|In {{the left}} hand corner is a knight, {{seemingly}} just rumbled from his sleep, looks up <b>in</b> <b>awe</b> at Christ. He wears a Coif and is clad in armor covered with a thin red tunic. He has a dagger attached to his belt, and holds a long sword and shield with a rounded shield boss.|$|E
25|$|North side: The March Through Georgia depicts men singing as {{they make}} their way easily through enemy territory. Sherman {{can be seen in the}} background, {{accompanied}} by staff members Colonel Lewis M. Dayton, Colonel James C. McCoy, and Captain Joseph C. Audenried.

60|$|The parted lips {{remained}} motionless <b>in</b> <b>awed</b> silence, and one brown fist still clutched the shirt {{with as much}} tenacity as ever; but the other yielded itself quite willingly to the wonderful white hand, strong but soft.|$|R
60|$|She felt no shame, but {{a certain}} exaltation {{as she looked}} into the faces about her. She gazed unrecognizingly upon her nearest girl friends, and they, gazing upon her white face and unresponsive eyes, spoke <b>in</b> <b>awed</b> whispers.|$|R
60|$|No more protests were made. We sat <b>in</b> <b>awed</b> silence, gazing with timid {{curiosity about}} the room, the stained, {{plastered}} walls of which were well-nigh covered with a motley assortment of pictures, chromos, and advertisements, pasted on without much regard for order or character.|$|R
25|$|David G. Bromley {{described}} Prem Rawat {{and other}} founders of new religions as being held <b>in</b> <b>awe</b> by their early followers, who ascribe extraordinary powers {{to them that}} set them apart from other human beings. When describing the difficulty of charismatic leaders in proving to be above normal human failings such as not to suffer ill health or indulge in worldly pursuits, he used Rawat's marriage as an example.|$|E
25|$|Following {{his second}} {{win in the}} UFC, he faced Matt Hughes at UFC 50 for the vacant UFC Welterweight Championship. Despite a {{competitive}} performance against the much more experienced fighter, St-Pierre tapped out to an armbar with only 10 seconds remaining in the first round. The loss {{was the first of}} St-Pierre's career and he has since admitted that he was <b>in</b> <b>awe</b> of Hughes going into the title bout.|$|E
25|$|In {{accordance}} with {{his role as}} founder of the Levites, Levi {{is referred to as}} being particularly pious. The Blessing of Moses, which some textual scholars attribute to a period just before the deuteronomist, speaks about Levi via an allegorical comparison to Moses himself, which hagaddah take to support the characterisation of Levi (and his progeny) as being by far the greatest of his brothers in respect to piety. The apocryphal Prayer of Asenath, which textual scholars believe dates from some time after the first century AD (scholarship in regards to the dating is currently quite contentious, with dates ranging from near the first century, to the fourth or fifth centuries), describes Levi as a prophet and saint, able to forecast the future, understand heavenly writings (astrology? weather trends?), and someone who admonishes the people to be forgiving, as well as <b>in</b> <b>awe</b> of God. The Book of Malachi argues that the Levites were chosen by Yahweh to be the priests, because Levi as minister of God, was specified only the true religious regulations, was reverent, revered Yahweh, was <b>in</b> <b>awe</b> of the God's name, upheld peace, was a model of good morality, and turned many people from sin.|$|E
60|$|John {{entered the}} tent, and sat {{exhausted}} upon a box. Walter hastened {{to get some}} food, which he set before him, and poured out a large cup of wine and water, and then stood, looking on <b>in</b> <b>awed</b> silence, while John devoured his meal.|$|R
60|$|So {{people knew}} fairies in those days, my dear, and loved them, {{together}} {{with all the}} ryls and knooks and pixies and nymphs and other beings that belong to the hordes of immortals. And a fairy tale was a thing to be wondered at and spoken of <b>in</b> <b>awed</b> whispers; for no one thought of doubting its truth.|$|R

25|$|We {{really hit}} it off and we would go fishing every day. I was <b>in</b> <b>awe</b> of all these great songs he’d written, and he would play them on the {{acoustic}} guitar really hard, Johnny Ramone style, all six strings. He had this bitter resentment that drenched every step he took and every word that he spoke. His songs were just filled with that envy {{of people that are}} better looking, that are more successful. It was just really inspiring to be around someone that just hated everything that much. It was just great.|$|E
25|$|Back at Storybrooke Elementary School, Snow resumes {{her role}} as teacher, and {{introduces}} her new assistant Shirin to the class. Realizing that the students are struggling, Shirin suggests that Snow embrace her past to inspire them. Taking a cue from Isaac Newton, Snow uses her experience as an archer and the students are <b>in</b> <b>awe,</b> winning her confidence with them. At {{the end of the}} school day, Shirin later meets up with the Oracle, where they are coordinating plans to search for Aladdin, as Shirin is revealed to be Princess Jasmine.|$|E
25|$|They came fifth for a {{third time}} in four years in 1979, with the {{following}} four weeks of Finals in 1979 proving to be a turning point for the club and the beginning of their great success in the 1980s. Inspired by Mortimer and led by Test captain George Peponis, the Bulldogs disposed of Cronulla, Wests and Parramatta to make the Finals with some of Mortimer's tries leaving the public <b>in</b> <b>awe</b> of his genius. St George won the Grand Final 17-13 with the Bulldogs staging a great second half comeback after being down 17-2 at the break.|$|E

60|$|In {{a moment}} Chauvelin {{was on his}} feet and with eyes dilated, lips parted <b>in</b> <b>awed</b> bewilderment, he was gazing towards the open window, where astride upon the sill, one leg inside the room, the other out, and with the moon shining full on his suit of delicate-coloured cloth, his wide caped coat and elegant chapeau-bras, sat the imperturbable Sir Percy.|$|R
60|$|Instantly {{the island}} trembled {{and with a}} weird groaning noise it moved upward--slowly, very slowly, but with a steady motion, while all the company stood by <b>in</b> <b>awed</b> silence. It was a {{wonderful}} thing, even to those skilled in the arts of magic, wizardry and sorcery, to realize that a single word could raise that great, heavy island, with its immense glass Dome.|$|R
25|$|Although cleverer {{than the}} Prince, Baldrick, knowing {{his place in}} the medieval pecking-order, holds him <b>in</b> <b>awe.</b> He often leads cheers in the Prince's honour (along with Lord Percy, who tries hard to join in), fills his head with illusions of grandeur, and often ends up doing his dirty work. This {{included}} carrying the decapitated body of Richard III and sleeping with the Spanish Infanta, Edmund's fiancée, making her unchaste in hopes that this would prevent the marriage. The latter task resulted in several injuries, including a seriously blackened eye. When Baldrick is abandoned by Edmund in the final episode, a tear falls from his eye.|$|E
25|$|The New York Times {{music critic}} Anthony Tommasini, who ranked Schubert as the fourth {{greatest}} composer, wrote of him:You {{have to love}} the guy, who died at 31, ill, impoverished and neglected except by a circle of friends who were <b>in</b> <b>awe</b> of his genius. For his hundreds of songs alone – including the haunting cycle Winterreise, which will never release its tenacious hold on singers and audiences – Schubert is central to our concert life.... Schubert's first few symphonies may be works in progress. But the Unfinished and especially the Great C major Symphony are astonishing. The latter one paves the way for Bruckner and prefigures Mahler.|$|E
25|$|Arriving at Cajamarca, Pizarro sent an embassy, led by Hernando de Soto, with 15 {{horsemen}} and an interpreter; {{shortly thereafter}} he sent 20 more horsemen led {{by his brother}} Hernando Pizarro as reinforcements {{in case of an}} Inca attack. Atahualpa was <b>in</b> <b>awe</b> of these men dressed in full clothing, with long beards and riding horses (an animal he had never seen). In town Pizzaro set a trap for the Inca and the Battle of Cajamarca began. The Inca forces greatly out numbered the Spanish; however, the Spanish superiority of weapons and tactics {{and the fact that the}} most trusted Inca generals were in Cusco led to an easy defeat and the capture of the Incan Emperor.|$|E
