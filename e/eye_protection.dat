5|$|Communication plans {{should be}} made {{beforehand}} to inform of mitigation actions being undertaken. Spare parts and back-up systems should be in place prior to ash fall events to reduce service disruption and return functionality as quickly as possible. Good preparedness also includes the identification of ash disposal sites, before ash fall occurs, to avoid further movement of ash and to aid clean-up. Protective equipment such as <b>eye</b> <b>protection</b> and dust masks should be deployed for clean-up teams in advance of ash fall events.|$|E
5|$|Since looking {{directly}} at the Sun can lead to permanent eye damage or blindness, special <b>eye</b> <b>protection</b> or indirect viewing techniques are used when viewing a solar eclipse. It is technically safe to view only the total phase of a total solar eclipse {{with the unaided eye}} and without protection; however, this is a dangerous practice, as most people are not trained to recognize the phases of an eclipse, which can span over two hours while the total phase can only last a maximum of 7.5 minutes for any one location. People referred to as eclipse chasers or umbraphiles will travel to remote locations to observe or witness predicted central solar eclipses.|$|E
50|$|The abducens nerve {{controls}} {{the movement of}} a single muscle, the lateral rectus muscle of the eye.

5|$|Viewing the Sun during partial and annular eclipses (and during total eclipses {{outside the}} {{brief period of}} totality) {{requires}} special <b>eye</b> <b>protection,</b> or indirect viewing methods if eye damage is to be avoided. The Sun's disk can be viewed using appropriate filtration to block the harmful part of the Sun's radiation. Sunglasses do not make viewing the Sun safe. Only properly designed and certified solar filters {{should be used for}} direct viewing of the Sun's disk. Especially, self-made filters using common objects such as a floppy disk removed from its case, a Compact Disc, a black colour slide film, smoked glass, etc. must be avoided.|$|E

40|$|Compliance with {{universal}} precautions by nurses and laboratory technicians in hospitals {{is very important}} because it prevent cross infection and decrease costs of antibiotics and antipyretics. Also, it decreases spread of infection, which leads to decrease morbidity and mortality rate. A cross-sectional descriptive design was used for conducting this study. The sample of the study consisted of 150 nurses and lab technicians working at morning shift in a hospital at Mansoura City, Dakahlia Governorate. Data were collected using a questionnaire sheet and an observation checklist. The study revealed that majority (86. 66 %) of the studied sample of nurses and lab technicians aged less than 30 years. Also, majority of the studied sample have poor knowledge about sign and symptom and transmission of AIDS. In addition, about 94 % of the studied samples have poor knowledge about signs, symptoms and mode of transmissions of hepatitis B and C virus infection. All of the studied sample reported {{that there are no}} <b>eye</b> <b>protections</b> in the hospital. Positive correlations between nurses' and lab technicians' practice and available supplies in the hospital were found, but the relations were not statistically significant. The exception was the item of the infection prevention ways which has a significant statistical relation.

25|$|Glasses, {{also known}} as {{eyeglasses}} or spectacles, are devices consisting of glass or hard plastic lenses mounted in a frame that holds {{them in front of}} a person's eyes, typically using a bridge over the nose and arms which rest over the ears. Glasses are typically used for vision correction, such as with reading glasses and glasses used for nearsightedness. Safety glasses provide <b>eye</b> <b>protection</b> against flying debris for construction workers or lab technicians; these glasses may have protection for the sides of the eyes {{as well as in the}} lenses. Some types of safety glasses are used to protect against visible and near-visible light or radiation. Glasses are worn for <b>eye</b> <b>protection</b> in some sports, such as squash. Glasses wearers may use a strap to prevent the glasses from falling off during movement or sports. Wearers of glasses that are used only part of the time may have the glasses attached to a cord that goes around their neck, to prevent the loss of the glasses.|$|E
25|$|Protective eyewear is {{beneficial}} to those exposed to ultraviolet radiation. Since light {{can reach the}} eyes from the sides, full-coverage <b>eye</b> <b>protection</b> is usually warranted {{if there is an}} increased risk of exposure, as in high-altitude mountaineering. Mountaineers are exposed to higher-than-ordinary levels of UV radiation, both because there is less atmospheric filtering and because of reflection from snow and ice.|$|E
25|$|In the European Community (EC), <b>eye</b> <b>protection</b> {{requirements}} are specified in European standard EN 207. In addition to EN 207, European standard EN 208 specifies requirements for goggles for use during beam alignment.

Finally, European standard EN 60825 specifies optical densities in extreme situations.|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} of {{personal protective equipment}} (PPE) and its contribution to increase personal safety in usual work places has to be proven by tests. One potential hazard for people are electric fault arcs occurring with short-circuits in electric power installations. There are very high risks for persons especially in case of direct exposure, e. g. during live working or working in the vicinity to live parts. Particularly radiation and convective heat is converted. With the box test according to IEC or EN 61482 - 1 - 2 a method for testing protection textiles and clothing against the thermal hazards of electric fault arcs has already been existing and used in certification for several years. But as shown by arc accidents the face is also particularly affected by severe damages. Protective equipment for <b>eye</b> and face <b>protection</b> which is also tested for arc resistance and protection is necessary. Based on basic investigations test principles for <b>eye</b> and face <b>protection</b> equipment against the thermal hazards of electric fault arcs have been developed and laid down in a new German test guide. The test set-up of the box test is suitable. It has been adapted and modified by a test head where test samples such as visors, visorhelmet combinations, face shields etc. are placed. The tests are carried out in accordance to the box test method of protective clothing (IEC/EN 61482 - 1 - 2). The paper gives information on tests made according to this test guide. Furthermore general conclusions are drawn on how to test and how to standardize tests of PPE for <b>eye</b> and face <b>protection.</b> The principles will be introduced in E DIN 58118 becoming a supplementation to the German edition of EN 166. It can also be the base for an international or European standard later on...|$|R
5000|$|The {{plica semilunaris}} {{is a small}} fold of bulbar {{conjunctiva}} on the medial canthus of the eye. It functions during movement of the eye, to help maintain tear drainage via the lacrimal lake, and to permit greater rotation of the globe, for without the plica the conjunctiva would attach directly to the eyeball, restricting movement. It is the vestigial remnant of the nictitating membrane (the [...] "third eyelid") which is drawn across the <b>eye</b> for <b>protection,</b> and is present in other animals such as birds, reptiles, and fish, but is rare in mammals, mainly found in monotremes and marsupials. Its associated muscles are also vestigial. [...] It is loose, thus eye movements are not restricted by it.

25|$|Polycarbonate is {{commonly}} used in <b>eye</b> <b>protection,</b> {{as well as in}} other projectile-resistant viewing and lighting applications that would normally indicate the use of glass, but require much higher impact-resistance. Polycarbonate lenses also protect the eye from UV light. Many kinds of lenses are manufactured from polycarbonate, including automotive headlamp lenses, lighting lenses, sunglass/eyeglass lenses, swimming goggles and SCUBA masks, and safety glasses/goggles/visors including visors in sporting helmets/masks and police riot gear (helmet visors, riot shields, etc.). Windscreens in small motorized vehicles are commonly made of polycarbonate, such as for motorcycles, ATVs, golf carts, and small planes and helicopters.|$|E
25|$|Like other {{corrosive}} {{acids and}} alkalis, drops of sodium hydroxide solutions can readily decompose proteins and lipids in living tissues via amide hydrolysis and ester hydrolysis, which consequently cause chemical burns and may induce permanent blindness upon contact with eyes. Solid alkali can also express its corrosive nature {{if there is}} water, such as water vapor. Thus, protective equipment, like rubber gloves, safety clothing and <b>eye</b> <b>protection,</b> should always be used when handling this chemical or its solutions. The standard first aid measures for alkali spills on the skin is, as for other corrosives, irrigation with large quantities of water. Washing is continued for at least ten to fifteen minutes.|$|E
25|$|Tattooing is {{regulated}} {{in many countries}} because of the associated health risks to client and practitioner, specifically local infections and virus transmission. Disposable plastic aprons and <b>eye</b> <b>protection</b> can be worn depending on the risk of blood or other secretions splashing into the eyes or clothing of the tattoist. Hand hygiene, assessment of risks and appropriate disposal of all sharp objects and materials contaminated with blood are crucial areas. The tattoo artist must wash his or her hands and must also wash the area that will be tattooed. Gloves must be worn at all times and the wound must be wiped frequently with a wet disposable towel of some kind. All equipment must be sterilized in a certified autoclave before and after every use. It is good practice to provide clients with a printed consent form that outlines risks and complications as well as instructions for after care.|$|E
