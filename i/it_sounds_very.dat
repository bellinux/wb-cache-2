500|$|A {{minority}} of apparently more discerning listeners felt that Connotations {{was the right}} music for its time and place. Composer Arthur Berger states, [...] "I think [...] wrote exactly the piece he wanted to write {{because he wanted to}} make a statement about the new Philharmonic Hall in New York—it wasn't going to be a temple of easy listening, as it were, but a place for serious music-making." [...] Minna Lederman Daniel, a music writer and editor of Modern Music magazine, told Copland, [...] "I think Connotations was the right place for the people and the occasion—indeed the only one properly related to them. It sounds a good deal like certain aspects of the building—big, spacious, clear, long-lined, and <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>very</b> like you... To those familiar with your music, the characteristic, identifying moods are perfectly apparent. The special Copland eloquence is there." ...|$|E
2500|$|The PMO {{answered}} {{only two}} {{questions of the}} RTI application, saying it has only one classified document pertaining {{to the death of}} Shastri, which is exempted from disclosure under the RTI Act. It sent the rest of the questions to the Ministry of External Affairs and Home Ministry to answer. The MEA said the only document from the erstwhile Soviet Government is [...] "the report of the Joint Medical Investigation conducted by a team comprising R. N. Chugh, Doctor in-Attendance to the PM and some Russian doctors" [...] and added no post-mortem was conducted in the USSR. The Home Ministry referred the matter to Delhi Police and National Archives for the response pertaining to any post-mortem conducted on the body of Shastri in India. Sunil Shastri, son of the former Prime Minister, called the transferring of application as [...] "absurd" [...] and [...] "silly joke". [...] "He (Lal Bahadur Shastri) died as sitting Prime Minister. <b>It</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>very</b> silly that MHA is referring the matter of death of second Prime Minister of India to a district level police." [...] He also demanded that [...] "It should be looked into by highest authorities like President, Prime Minister and home minister." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Drink this, dear," [...] he begged, [...] "and don't be alarmed. <b>It</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>very</b> terrible, {{but believe}} me {{there is nothing to}} be feared." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{heard the}} story long ago," [...] Beatrice observed, [...] "only of course <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>very</b> {{differently}} then, and we never dreamed that it would really be produced." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Does <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> <b>very</b> base?" [...] asked Acton, candidly. [...] "I {{suppose it}} does, and I {{thank you for}} telling me so. Of course, I don't mean it literally." ...|$|R
5000|$|The song [...] "Bludfuk" [...] {{was given}} that name in mutual {{agreement}} between Jake and Mike Varney <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>very</b> similar to [...] "fuck" [...] and seemed very offensive to Varney.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm afraid <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>very</b> rude, but I hope {{from the}} bottom of my heart that I shall never set eyes on any of you again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Say it again, Phoebe. <b>It</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>very</b> grand. Whipped {{cream is}} a truer {{exponent}} of milk than cheese, {{especially when it}} tastes of soap-suds. Is that it?' ...|$|E
60|$|ELLIE. Goodbye, Hesione. I'm very sorry. I see {{now that}} <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>very</b> {{improbable}} as I tell it. But I can't stay {{if you think that}} way about me.|$|E
6000|$|<b>It</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>very</b> pleasant, I {{was obliged}} to admit. [...] "And I {{know some of the}} lady-society already," [...] I added. [...] "One of them came in the same {{carriage}} with me" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And you are {{the little}} girl that I {{remember}} when I was a boy at Mr. Folliott's?" [...] he said. His voice was clear, and rather loud, but <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>very</b> pleasantly in that sad old house.|$|R
60|$|Twice {{before the}} hour of midnight they heard that same quaint and merry laugh {{proceeding}} from the lighted room, through the open window. Once <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>very</b> low and very prolonged, as if {{in response to a}} delightful joke.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{sure her}} name's Lurella, for {{she wanted to}} know. Besides, there's as much sense in it {{as there is in}} any name. <b>It</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>very</b> well. Lurella. It is mere {{prejudice}} that condemns the novel collocation of syllables." ...|$|E
6000|$|Lord Tennyson is {{probably}} the most extensive Involuntary Bailee at present living. The term [...] "Involuntary Bailee" [...] {{may or may not be}} a correct piece of legal terminology; at all events, <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>very</b> imposing, and can be easily explained.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I'm afraid <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>very</b> immoral, but {{whatever}} his crimes were, I should never like Alec less. You see, he's been so awfully good and kind to me, I can look on with fortitude while he plays football with the Ten Commandments.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{is always}} so interested," [...] Lois said, [...] "in things which {{she does not}} understand. You talked so well this afternoon, Mr. Saton. I am afraid I could not follow you, but <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>very</b> {{brilliant}} and very wonderful." ...|$|R
50|$|The second book, The Sin of Joost Avelingh, was {{the first}} one he {{published}} under the nom de plume of Maarten Maartens. He chose that name because <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>very</b> Dutch, was easy to remember and for non-Dutch speakers also easy to pronounce.|$|R
5000|$|The bird's call {{is like a}} tzii or tzee. <b>It</b> <b>sound</b> <b>very</b> [...] "metallic" [...] {{and it is a}} {{very short}} and not exactly a song at all. It nests on trees or on the ground and lays about four to five eggs.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing like {{a little}} Law to cow the ruffians, my dear!" [...] she remarked confidentially to Clara. [...] "You saw how he quailed when I {{mentioned}} the Habeas Corpus? Not that I've any idea what it means, but <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>very</b> grand, doesn't it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But if {{you were}} to ask me my advice, I should say: take your courage in both hands and try your luck at {{something}} else. <b>It</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>very</b> hard, {{but let me tell you}} this: I would give all I have in the world if someone had given me that advice when I was your age and I had taken it." ...|$|E
6000|$|Alton {{glanced down}} at her in swift surprise, and then his face became a mask again. [...] "Well," [...] he said slowly, [...] "when I {{think we would have}} been beaten without it, {{somebody}} lent us enough dollars to carry us through. <b>It</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>very</b> simple, but it has made a new man of me. To have dragged down all the men who trusted me would have hurt me horribly." ...|$|E
60|$|In a {{few minutes}} they heard Drummer's long roll. Then again and again. The third time it broke off right in the middle, and right away a terrible fuss started down at the big chestnut-tree. They could hear Drummer's voice, and <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>very</b> angry.|$|R
50|$|George Lucas's Star Wars {{series has}} notable {{influences}} from the New Gods. At a 1972 dinner that included comics writer/editor Roy Thomas and comic shop owner Ed Summer, George Lucas told his story for Star Wars, after which Roy Thomas noted that <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>very</b> similar to Jack Kirby’s New Gods.|$|R
50|$|Myers next {{offered the}} song to Sonny Dae & His Knights, a novelty all-white musical {{group led by}} Italian-American Paschal Vennitti. The group's {{subsequent}} recording, on the Arcade Records label (owned by Haley's manager, Jack Howard), was a regional success, although <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>very</b> different from what Haley would later record.|$|R
6000|$|N.B.--Where I {{have put}} an [...] "A" [...] {{is that a}} {{dominant}} eleventh, or what? or just a seventh on the D? and if the latter, is that allowed? <b>It</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>very</b> funny. Never mind all my questions; if I begin about music (which is my leading ignorance and curiosity), I have always to babble questions: all my friends know me now, and take no notice whatever. The whole piece is marked allegro; but surely could easily be played too fast? The dignity must not be lost; the periwig feeling.|$|E
6000|$|Many Regiments possess special rights, such as wearing collars with undress uniform, or a bow of ribbon {{between the}} shoulders, or {{red and white}} roses in their helmets on certain days of the year. Some rights are {{connected}} with regimental saints, and some with regimental successes. All are valued highly; but none so highly as {{the right of the}} White Hussars to have the Band playing when their horses are being watered in the Lines. Only one tune is played, and that tune never varies. I don't know its real name, but the White Hussars call it:--"Take me to London again." [...] <b>It</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>very</b> pretty. The Regiment would sooner be struck off the roster than forego their distinction.|$|E
6000|$|... "Never mind, you'll {{give more}} {{pleasure}} in this quiet way," [...] said Mr. Irwine. [...] "In {{this sort of}} thing people are constantly confounding liberality with riot and disorder. <b>It</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>very</b> grand to say that so many sheep and oxen were roasted whole, and everybody ate who liked to come; but in the end it generally happens that no one has had an enjoyable meal. If the people get a good dinner and a moderate quantity of ale {{in the middle of the}} day, they'll be able to enjoy the games as the day cools. You can't hinder some of them from getting too much towards evening, but drunkenness and darkness go better together than drunkenness and daylight." ...|$|E
6000|$|Dr. Lawton: [...] "Yes, I too. <b>It</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>very</b> much as if I were Brutus also." [...] He stirs his tea {{and stares}} round at the company. [...] "It {{seems to me}} that I have met these conspirators before. That's what makes Boston insupportable. You're always meeting the same people!" ...|$|R
50|$|Although {{the song}} was <b>very</b> popular, <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>very</b> {{familiar}} to older music fans. And with good reason. The chorus of Manau's single was actually a cover of the melody line from Alan Stivell's famous 1970s folk hit Tri Martolod. Stivell promptly sued the group. Manau maintains that {{the song was}} simply a baseline, and was modified enough to not be considered plagiarism.|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't {{remember}} anything definitely until I {{woke up in}} that chapel," [...] Graham continued, [...] "but when they searched me {{and found that the}} pocketbook had gone, Fischer, the big American, muttered some woman's name. I was queer just at the moment, but <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>very</b> much to me like Miss Van Teyl's. He rang her up on the telephone." ...|$|R
6000|$|Many Regiments possess {{special rights}} such as wearing collars with undress uniform, or a bow of riband between the shoulders, or {{red and white}} roses in their helmets on certain days of the year.

6000|$|It is {{possible}} that an education entirely urban {{is not the best}} conceivable preparation for descriptive articles upon the country. On the other hand, your professional nature-lover is sometimes a little over-familiar with his subject. He knows the names of all the things, and he does not spare you. Besides, he is subtle. The prominent features are too familiar to him, and he goes into details. What respectable townsman, for instance, knows what [...] "scabiosa" [...] is? <b>It</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>very</b> unpleasant. Then the professional nature-lover assumes that you know trees. No Englishman can tell any tree from any other tree, except a very palpable oak or poplar. So that we may at least, as an experiment, allow a good Londoner to take his unsophisticated eyes out into the sweet country for once, and try his skill at nature-loving, though his botany has been learned over the counter of flower-shops, and his zoology on Saturday afternoons when they have the band in the Gardens. He makes his way, then, over by Epsom Downs towards Sutton, trying to assimilate his mood to the proper flavour of appreciation as he goes, and with a little notebook {{in the palm of his}} hand to assist an ill-trained memory. And the burthen of his song is of course the autumn tints.|$|E
6000|$|It was, said he, Joss {{that the}} light was so bad at the hour of the last {{round-up}} when our main fleet had {{come down from the}} north and shovelled the Hun round on his tracks. Per contra, had it been any other kind of weather, the odds were the Hun would not have ventured so far. As it was, the Hun's fleet had come out and gone back again, none the better for air and exercise. We must be thankful for what we had managed to pick up. But talking of picking up, there was an instance of almost unparalleled Joss which had stuck in his memory. A soldier-man, related to one of the officers in one of our ships that was put down, had got five days' leave from the trenches which he spent with his relative aboard, and thus dropped in for the whole performance. He had been employed in helping to spot, and had lived up a mast till the ship sank, when he stepped off into the water and swam about till he was fished out and put ashore. By that time, the tale goes, his engine-room-dried khaki had shrunk half-way up his legs and arms, in which costume he reported himself to the War Office, and pleaded for one little day's extension of leave to make himself decent. [...] "Not a bit of it," [...] said the War Office. [...] "If you choose to spend your leave playing with sailor-men and getting wet all over, that's your concern. You will return to duty by to-night's boat." [...] (This may be a libel on the W.O., but <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>very</b> like them.) [...] "And he had to," [...] said the boy, [...] "but I expect he spent the next week at Headquarters telling fat generals all about the fight." ...|$|E
60|$|Long after, Jan told Christina {{the whole}} story, but <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>very</b> improbable, and Christina--though, of course, {{she did not}} say so--did not quite believe it, but thought Jan was trying to explain away that strange month of his life during which he had wooed Dame Toelast. Yet it {{certainly}} was strange that Nicholas, for the same short month, had been so different from his usual self.|$|R
25|$|Also in 2002, Akita {{released}} Merzbeat, {{which was}} seen as a significant departure from his trademark abstract style in that it contains beat-oriented pieces. This has sparked some controversy among fans, though some reviewers pointed out that <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>very</b> similar to Aqua Necromancer (1998) which features samples of progressive rock drumming. Merzbird (2004) and Merzbuddha (2005) followed in a similar vein with sampled beats combined with Merzbow's signature harsh noise.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>it</b> all <b>sounds</b> <b>very</b> interesting," [...] he remarked, [...] "but I {{should think}} it must be deadly for you. Your father invents no end of {{wonderful}} things, doesn't he?" ...|$|R
