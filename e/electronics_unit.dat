5|$|The top ten drivers {{competed for}} pole {{position}} in Q3 {{and it was}} a battle between the two Mercedes. Lewis Hamilton set his fastest time first with Rosberg right behind him. A much better time in the third sector of the track allowed Rosberg to take his sixth consecutive pole position almost four-tenths ahead of his teammate. Sergio Pérez held third spot for much of the session but was beaten to it by Kimi Räikkönen during the second turn of runs. The two were followed by Daniel Ricciardo and Valtteri Bottas on the third row of the grid. Following a gearbox change after qualifying, Romain Grosjean was demoted five places on the grid. Roberto Merhi and Will Stevens also received five place penalties: Stevens for a change of the Control <b>Electronics</b> <b>unit,</b> Merhi for changes made to his suspension. Both would start the race from the back row of the grid.|$|E

2500|$|The {{committee}} {{investigating the}} crash were {{satisfied that the}} destructive error in 1989 was not relevant to the 1994 crash. Information provided from Boeing to the investigation led to the following conclusion regarding FADEC performance: [...] "Data from the Digital <b>Electronics</b> <b>Unit</b> (DECU) of the second engine showed no evidence of torque or temperature exceedance and the matched power conditions of the engines post-impact indicate {{that there was no}} sustained emergency power demand. No other evidence indicated any FADEC or engine faults." [...] It was expected that in a FADEC engine runaway, engine power would become asynchronous and mismatched. The investigation found the engines at the crash to have matched settings, decreasing the likelihood of a FADEC malfunction being involved.|$|E

2500|$|Each {{thyristor}} valve will typically contain tens or {{hundreds of}} thyristor levels, each operating at a different (high) potential with respect to earth. [...] The command information {{to turn on the}} thyristors therefore cannot simply be sent using a wire connection – it needs to be isolated. [...] The isolation method can be magnetic (using pulse transformers) but is usually optical. [...] Two optical methods are used: [...] indirect and direct optical triggering. [...] In the indirect optical triggering method, the low-voltage control electronics sends light pulses along optical fibres to the high-side control electronics, which derives its power from the voltage across each thyristor. [...] The alternative direct optical triggering method dispenses with most of the high-side electronics, instead using light pulses from the control electronics to switch light-triggered thyristors (LTTs), although a small monitoring <b>electronics</b> <b>unit</b> may still be required for protection of the valve.|$|E
