25|$|The {{family moved}} often, {{following}} General Macedonski's postings. Born in Bucharest, Macedonski-son {{was the third}} of four siblings, the oldest of whom was a daughter, Caterina. Before the age of six, he was a sickly and nervous child, who {{is reported to have}} had regular tantrums. In 1862, his father sent him to school in Oltenia, and he spent most time in the Amaradia region. The nostalgia he <b>felt</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> landscape later made him consider writing an Amărăzene ("Amaradians") cycle, of which only one poem was ever completed. He was attending the Carol I High School in Craiova and, according to his official record, graduated in 1867.|$|E
25|$|The forced {{resignation}} {{was a major}} {{setback for}} Eakins. His family was split, with his in-laws siding against him in public dispute. He struggled to protect his name against rumors and false charges, had bouts of ill health, and suffered a humiliation which he <b>felt</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> rest of his life. Eakins' popularity amongst the students was such {{that a number of}} them broke with the Academy and formed the Art Students' League of Philadelphia (1886–1893), where Eakins subsequently instructed. It was there that he met the student, Samuel Murray, who would become his protege and lifelong friend. He also lectured and taught at a number of other schools, including the Art Students League of New York, the National Academy of Design, Cooper Union, and the Art Students' Guild in Washington DC. Dismissed in March 1895 by the Drexel Institute in Philadelphia for again using a fully nude male model, he gradually withdrew from teaching by 1898.|$|E

25|$|Toole {{tried to}} {{maintain}} a sense of normalcy and enrolled in Tulane {{in the fall of}} 1968 with the hopes of acquiring a Ph.D. He took a course studying Theodore Dreiser, on whom he had lectured while at Hunter, and was particularly interested in Dreiser's close relationship with his mother and his anti-Catholic beliefs. The assassinations of Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968 added to his feelings of grief and heightened his paranoia. Several of Toole's longtime friends noticed he had an increasing sense of feelings of personal persecution. Toole went to see his friend Bob Byrne at his home in August 1968, where he again expressed sadness and humiliation that his book would not be published. Toole told Byrne that people were passing his home late in the night and honking their car horns at him, that students whispered about him behind his back, and that people were plotting against him. Byrne had a talk with him, which he <b>felt,</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> time being, calmed him down.|$|E
25|$|Arriving at Bakri on 17 January, the Australians {{established}} strong defensive {{positions and}} the following day, with assistance from an anti-tank regiment, repulsed a heavy Japanese attack that had been supported by armour. As the Japanese <b>felt</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> 2/29th Battalion's flanks, their position grew increasing tenuous {{and they were in}} danger of being surrounded. The arrival of the 2/19th allowed the 2/29th to withdraw, but further flanking moves by the Japanese cut off the withdrawal route. Fighting their way through several Japanese road blocks and almost constant air attack, they found the river crossing at Parit Sulong in Japanese hands and despite several efforts to wrest control of it, the combined Australian and Indian force had to break track and head into the jungle in an effort to reach Yong Peng, which was still in British hands. In the process, they had to leave their wounded behind with a handful of medical personnel, trusting that they would be cared for by the Japanese. In the end, all but two of the 135 men were executed by their captors. Of the two survivors, one was Lieutenant Ben Hackney of the 2/29th Battalion, who was later captured by the Japanese, but who survived the war as a prisoner.|$|E

[...] Like Roger Williams, he also made an effort to learn their language and acted as interpreter many times; he was paid 26 shillings for his services in one instance.

He said, [...] "After seeing this film I can see that most of the characters I have played before were contrived. They had no 'folks', as the character of Ziegfeld had in this picture.

500|$|Reviewing the {{published}} Coleman material, The Independent Richard Canning {{suggests that the}} influence of these early works is often discernible in Larkin's poetry. Likewise Stephen Cooper, in his 2004 book Philip Larkin: Subversive Writer, argues that the stylistic and thematic influences of Trouble at Willow Gables and Michaelmas Term at St Brides anticipate the poetry's recurrent concern with rebellion and conformity. Among examples, Cooper cites Marie's refusal in Willow Gables to compromise with an unjust authority as reflecting the sentiments expressed in Larkin's poem [...] "Places, Loved Ones" [...] (1954). The reader, says Cooper, [...] "is invited to identify with Marie's plight {{in a manner that}} foreshadows the empathy <b>felt</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> rape victim in 'Deception (1950). When Marie, having escaped from the school, discovers that her freedom is an illusion, she longs to return to the familiar paths. These sentiments are present in poems such as [...] "Poetry of Departures" [...] (1954), [...] "Here" [...] (1961), and [...] "High Windows" [...] (1967).|$|E

Michael C. Hall called the ending a [...] "really bold stroke" [...] that would reset the stage of the series just as the Dexter Morgan character began to feel he could live with an emotional connection to his wife and family. Hall also said of the ending, [...] "More than anything I <b>felt</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> audience. I think {{this is the kind of}} thing that's really going to tie people in knots." ...|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reaction}} {{towards the}} character was generally mixed. In a DVD {{review of the}} first series, Michael Mackenzie of Home Cinema thought Macfadyen {{was not a very}} good actor and believed [...] "he seems to be in some sort of contest with Keanu Reeves to see how long he can maintain the same lifeless facial expression," [...] but thought the character himself, particularly his personal life, mostly worked well for the most part as it continues [...] "as a standard soap opera." [...] In review of the second series, Dennis Landmann of MovieFreak praised the [...] "drama and intensity that builds around his character," [...] noting Tom's somewhat [...] "haunted soul" [...] and the last five minutes of the last episode [...] "were so powerful they affected how I <b>felt</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> next couple of days; I kept thinking about the character and the tragic events that happened to him." [...] In the third series, Mackenzie praised the episode where Tom tries to clear his name, but thought his exit was [...] "not particularly satisfying." [...] However, David Blackwell of Enterline Media thought that his farewell scene was [...] "one of [...] best moments of the first two episode (in addition to the way Tom acts in the opening episode)." ...|$|E
