25|$|To {{throw off}} the press and keep his {{intentions}} hidden, Rickey got heavily involved in Gus Greenlee's newest foray into black baseball, the United States League. Greenlee started the league in 1945 {{as a way to}} get back at the owners of the Negro National League teams for throwing him out. Rickey saw the opportunity as a way to convince people that he was interested in cleaning up blackball, not integrating it. <b>In</b> <b>midsummer</b> 1945, Rickey, almost ready with his Robinson plan, pulled out of the league. The league folded after the end of the 1946 season.|$|E
25|$|The 2004 {{season began}} frustratingly for Kabir, as injury {{prevented}} him from playing {{until the end of}} May. However, some good performances <b>in</b> <b>midsummer</b> brought him a place in the squad for the Champions Trophy tournament in September, and he retained his place for the winter tour of South Africa (see above). Kabir's performances in early 2005 were unspectacular, but nevertheless he was named in the 14-man squad for that summer's triangular one-day series with Australia and Bangladesh. He played in none of the games, however, and was replaced by Matt Prior for the three-game ODI series against Australia which immediately followed.|$|E
25|$|P. gibbosus {{is a part}} of a mimicry {{group with}} a wide variety of other wasps that also exhibit black and yellow banding and coloring. It has been {{observed}} that mimicry is high in spring and early summer, generally absent <b>in</b> <b>midsummer,</b> and infrequent in late summer. This implies that some members of the mimicry group, including P. gibbosus, may be selected to avoid the midsummer season when insectivorous birds are abundant and have not yet learned to avoid the models which the mimics resemble. The colony cycle of P. gibbosus lines up with this scheduling in such a way that minimizes the amount of predation the species faces.|$|E

25|$|The burrows of a {{southern}} hairy-nosed wombat can have air temperatures around of 14°C in midwinter to 26°C <b>in</b> <b>midsummer,</b> the wombat's preferred thermo-neutral zone, while the ambient temperatures outside range from down to around 2°C in Winter and up to 36°C or above during Summer. Warrens can make surface conditions in habitats of low humidity and high temperatures better for the wombat. A wombat retires deep in the burrow after foraging. The next night, the wombat moves to the entrance to check if conditions are right before emerging again. In the evening, wombats leave their burrows as the ambient temperature and burrow temperature are the same. In the early morning, when the surface temperature is lower, they retire.|$|E
25|$|On {{only seven}} or eight {{occasions}} did Rodrigo {{pay a visit to}} the royal court between September 1141 and March 1152. During this period he continued to visit the Portuguese royal court also. Later, according to the Chronica, in a not unusual display of mercy, Alfonso invited the disgraced count to court and regaled him with gifts of gold and silver as he customarily did his regular courtiers, thus reconciling him to himself. In 1147 Rodrigo joined the royal army that marched to re-conquer Almería from the Muslims, but like many of the Galicians initially present he left <b>in</b> <b>midsummer</b> after taking part in the Siege of Oreja (at least until 25 July).|$|E
25|$|Malmö, {{like the}} rest of {{southern}} Sweden, has an oceanic climate. Despite its northern location, the climate is surprisingly mild compared to other locations in similar latitudes, or even somewhat farther south, mainly because of the Gulf Stream. Because of its northern latitude, daylight extends 17 hours <b>in</b> <b>midsummer,</b> to only around 7 hours in midwinter. The actual sunshine is measured at 1,700 hours per annum in Falsterbo a bit further south and 1,592 hours per annum in Lund somewhat north, according to the 1961–1990 averages. For 2002–2014, the sunshine is measured at 1,895 hours per annum in Falsterbo and 1,803 hours per annum in Lund. The sunshine data in the weather box is based on the 2002–2014 data for Falsterbo which most closely resemble those for Malmö.|$|E

25|$|In {{the summer}} of 425 BC, an Athenian fleet {{commanded}} by Eurymedon and Sophocles, with Demosthenes aboard as an advisor, sailed from Athens to campaign in Sicily and assist Athens' democratic allies at Corcyra. Demosthenes held no official position at the time, but was a strategos-elect for the Hellenic year that would begin <b>in</b> <b>midsummer</b> 425, and the two generals had been instructed {{to allow him to}} use the fleet around the Peloponnese if he wished. Once the fleet was at sea, Demosthenes revealed his plan, which he had previously kept secret; he wished to land at and fortify Pylos, which he believed to be a particularly promising site for a forward outpost. (Pylos was a good distance from Sparta by march, and commanded an excellent harbour in the Bay of Navarino.). The generals rejected this plan, but Demosthenes caught a stroke of luck when a storm blew and drove the fleet to the shore at Pylos. Even then the generals refused to order the fortification of the promontory, and Demosthenes was similarly rebuffed when he attempted to appeal directly to the troops and subordinate commanders; only when the boredom of waiting out the storm overcame the Athenians did they set to work building fortifications. Once they began, however, the Athenians worked hard and quickly, and the promontory was fortified and defensible within a few days. The fleet sailed off towards Corcyra, where a Spartan fleet of 60 ships was operating, leaving Demosthenes with five ships and their complements of sailors and soldiers to defend the new fort.|$|E
25|$|Poland's Chief of State, Józef Piłsudski, {{felt the}} time was right to expand Polish borders as far east as feasible, to be {{followed}} by a Polish-led Intermarium federation of Central and Eastern European states as a bulwark against the re-emergence of German and Russian imperialism. Lenin, meanwhile, saw Poland as the bridge the Red Army had to cross to assist other communist movements and bring about other European revolutions. By 1919, Polish forces had taken control of much of Western Ukraine, emerging victorious from the Polish–Ukrainian War. The West Ukrainian People's Republic, led by Yevhen Petrushevych, had tried to create a Ukrainian state on territories to which both Poles and Ukrainians laid claim. At the same time in the Russian part of Ukraine Symon Petliura tried to defend and strengthen the Ukrainian People's Republic, but as the Bolsheviks began to gain the upper hand in the Russian Civil War, they started to advance westward towards the disputed Ukrainian territories, causing Petliura's forces to retreat to Podolia. By the end of 1919, a clear front had formed as Petliura decided to ally with Piłsudski. Border skirmishes escalated following Piłsudski's Kiev Offensive in April 1920. The Polish offensive was met by an initially successful Red Army counterattack. The Soviet operation pushed the Polish forces back westward {{all the way to the}} Polish capital, Warsaw, while the Directorate of Ukraine fled to Western Europe. Meanwhile, Western fears of Soviet troops arriving at the German frontiers increased the interest of Western powers in the war. <b>In</b> <b>midsummer,</b> the fall of Warsaw seemed certain but in mid-August, the tide had turned again, as the Polish forces achieved an unexpected and decisive victory at the Battle of Warsaw. In the wake of the Polish advance eastward, the Soviets sued for peace and the war ended with a ceasefire in October 1920.|$|E
500|$|The above opening {{sentence}} {{of the novel}} has a symbolic function: Russian critic Vadim K. Kozhinov argues that the reference to the [...] "exceptionally hot evening" [...] establishes not only the suffocating atmosphere of Saint Petersburg <b>in</b> <b>midsummer</b> but also [...] "the infernal ambience of the crime itself". Dostoyevsky {{was among the first}} to recognize the symbolic possibilities of city life and imagery drawn from the city. I. F. I. Evnin regards Crime and Punishment as the first great Russian novel [...] "in which the climactic moments of the action are played out in dirty taverns, on the street, in the sordid back rooms of the poor".|$|E
