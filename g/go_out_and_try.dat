5|$|Feeling {{the need}} to seek out truth creates a {{separation}} between {{the mind of a}} poet and the mind of a philosopher. The poem reconciles the two by allowing the pursuer of truth to reflect on his time of simply enjoying nature and God's presence. However, the philosopher aspect is dominant and the individual must <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>try</b> to help humanity. Nature can be soothing, but the narrator must reject the Edenic quality of nature because such a state is not yet appropriate. The Edenic imagery figures into many of Coleridge's poems and is reinforced with the image of myrtle trees and takes on many forms within his poetry. In Reflections, to dwell in an Edenic state is a paradise in which the narrator leaves voluntarily because he cannot ignore the problems of the world like a coward. Instead, the individual is compelled to join with humanity and even the lowest form of benefiting humanity is superior to doing nothing at all.|$|E

Instead, Benno retreats more and more into Sandra's dream, where he is free to do whatever he wants, but in real life, the sand in his apartment is piling up, eventually trapping him.

5000|$|Armitage {{joined the}} cast of Spooks as the {{character}} Lucas North for series 7, which began on 27 October 2008 in the UK. Armitage notes that the character, who spent eight years in a Russian prison, has a personable exterior, but is psychologically damaged. [...] "I love films {{with a combination of}} action and good characters. That's why Lucas is interesting as I get to play someone with a complex psychology who <b>goes</b> <b>out</b> there <b>and</b> <b>tries</b> to save the world." [...] During the filming of series 7 Armitage allowed himself to be subjected to waterboarding to film a flashback sequence. In July 2010, Armitage completed filming of series 9, his final series. In this last series, his character's real name was revealed as John Bateman, who had murdered the real Lucas North shortly before North began employment with MI5. Bateman had stolen North's identity and taken his place.|$|R

5000|$|... "Listen to What the Man Said" [...] was {{recorded}} in early 1975 by Wings during their New Orleans sessions for Venus and Mars. It was a song which Paul McCartney had high hopes for, but early recordings did {{not live up to}} the song's potential. McCartney said in 1975 of his initial opinion of the song, [...] "It was one of the songs we’d gone in with high hopes for. Whenever I would play it on the piano, people would say ‘Oh, I like that one.’ But when we did the backing track, we thought we didn't really get it together at all." [...] After Mason added guitar overdubs, the band was still dissatisfied. However, once Scott recorded the sax solo, judgements were changed. Although several takes of the solo were recorded, the very first take was the one that was used. McCartney said of Tom Scott's impact on the track, [...] "Someone said jazz musician ‘Tom Scott lives near here.’ We said, yeah, give him a ring, see if he turns up, and he turned up within half an hour! There he was, with his sax, and he sat down in the studio playing through. The engineer was recording it. We kept all the notes he was playing casually. He came in and I said ‘I think that’s it.’ He said ‘Did you record that?’ I said yes, and we listened to it back. No one could believe it, so he <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>tried</b> a few more, but they weren’t as good. He’d had all the feel on this early take, the first take." [...] The effect of a kiss smack heard on the track {{was recorded}} by engineer Alan O'Duffy, who taped Linda doing it.The end of the song also features a small link used to transition into the next song on Venus and Mars, [...] "Treat Her Gently/Lonely Old People".|$|R

While running down the stairs, trying to catch it, he stumbles and gets hurt and sent to the hospital. The same old lady that he was delivering the washing machine for comes and visits him. He gets scared thinking she came to be paid for the broken washing machine, but it turns out, she only wanted {{to see if he was}} alright. As they talk she tells him her life story, as well as the story about one poor orphan child Natasha from her village.

60|$|Walter {{had some}} idle notion {{in his head}} that it was Puritanical to speak courteously to servants, and despising Diggory for his cowardice and stupidity, he was {{especially}} overbearing with him, and went on rating {{him all the time}} he was putting on his boots, to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>try</b> to catch some fish for the morrow's dinner, which was likely to be but scanty. As soon as he was gone, Diggory, who had listened in sulky silence, began to utter his complaints.|$|E

He added that he had never expected to go to Europe, but that he had begun to run down lately, and his doctor thought he had better <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>try</b> Carlsbad.|$|E

60|$|Some {{time after}} this, as I was at work, and very melancholy, {{she begins to}} ask me what the matter was, as {{she was used to}} do. I told her my heart was heavy; I had little work, and nothing to live on, and knew not what course to take. She laughed, and told me I must <b>go</b> <b>out</b> again <b>and</b> <b>try</b> my fortune; it might be that I might meet with another piece of plate. 'O mother!' says I, 'that is a trade I have no skill in, and if I should be taken I am undone at once.' Says she, 'I could help you to a schoolmistress that shall make you as {{dexterous}} as herself.' I trembled at that proposal, for hitherto I had had no confederates, nor any acquaintance among that tribe. But she conquered all my modesty, and all my fears; and in a little time, by the help of this confederate, I grew as impudent a thief, and as dexterous as ever Moll Cutpurse was, though, if fame does not belie her, not half so handsome.|$|R

500|$|... "Quick Sand" [...] is a {{shuffling}} rock {{song that}} addresses the plight of illegal immigrants to Arizona. It depicts six migrants travelling through extreme climates in the Sonoran Desert to reach Devil's Highway {{in an attempt to}} cross the Mexico – United States border. They journey from Tamaulipas and through the mountains along Devil's Highway. Partway into the journey, the migrants are abandoned by their coyote guide and subsequently lose one another one by one. They experience thirst, hunger, injury, and fear, culminating with the only two surviving migrants being turned away by a vigilante at the border. Cooder said of the route's background and the narrative in an interview, [...] "t's been a migrant trail for 200 years. People <b>go</b> <b>out</b> there <b>and</b> <b>try</b> to do it on foot, but if you make one mistake <b>and</b> <b>go</b> five minutes <b>out</b> of your way, you become disorientated and dehydrated. And they find these mummified bodies out there. The heat has just baked them through. And the people who live through it often refer to having a vision of the Virgin of Guadalupe flying overhead. This is a very common vision when the dehydration sets in." ...|$|R
60|$|Accordingly, the sloop of war Sophia, {{commanded}} by Captain Lockyer, {{was sent to}} Barrataria to treat with Lafitte, and when this vessel arrived off {{the mouth of the}} harbor, which she could not enter, she began firing signal guns in order {{to attract the attention of}} the people of the colony. Naturally enough, the report of the Sophia's guns created a great excitement in Barrataria, and all the people who happened to be at the settlement at that time crowded out upon the beach to see what they could see. But the war-vessel was too far away for them to distinguish her nationality, and Lafitte quickly made up his mind that the only thing for him to do was to row out to the mouth of the harbor and see what was the matter. Without doubt he feared that this was the United States vessel which had come to break up his settlement. But whether this was the case or not, he must <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>try</b> the effect of fair words, for he had no desire whatever to defend his interests by hard blows.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{to come to}} {{the point}} now: I find, after {{studying}} the situation, that the old varsity players and undergraduates of this university have been lacking in--let us be generous and say, college spirit. I do not need to go into detail; {{suffice it to say that}} I know. I will admit, however, that I attended the game between the old varsity and the new candidates. I sat unobserved in a corner, and a more unhappy time I never spent in this university. I confess that my sympathies were with the inexperienced, undeveloped boys who were trying to learn to play ball. Put yourselves in their places.

60|$|He is dead but thirty years, and one {{asks how}} a great society could have tolerated him? Would we bear him now? In this {{quarter of a}} century, what a silent {{revolution}} has been working! how it has separated us from old times and manners! How it has changed men themselves! I can see old gentlemen now among us, of perfect good breeding, of quiet lives, with venerable grey heads, fondling their grandchildren; and look at them, and wonder at what they were once. That gentleman of the grand old school, {{when he was in}} the 10th Hussars, and dined at the prince’s table, would fall under it night after night. Night after night, that gentleman sat at Brookes’s or Raggett’s over the dice. If, in the petulance of play or drink, that gentleman spoke a sharp word to his neighbour, he and the other would infallibly <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>try</b> to shoot each other the next morning. That gentleman would drive his friend Richmond the black boxer down to Moulsey, and hold his coat, and shout and swear, and hurrah with delight, whilst the black man was beating Dutch Sam the Jew. That gentleman would take a manly pleasure in pulling his own coat off, and thrashing a bargeman in a street row. That gentleman has been in a watchhouse. That gentleman, so exquisitely polite with ladies in a drawing-room, so loftily courteous, if he talked now as he used among men in his youth, would swear so as to make your hair stand on end. I met lately a very old German gentleman, who had served in our army at the beginning of the century. Since then he has lived on his own estate, but rarely meeting with an Englishman, whose language—the language of fifty years ago that is—he possesses perfectly. When this highly bred old man began to speak English to me, almost every other word he uttered was an oath: as they used it (they swore dreadfully in Flanders) with the Duke of York before Valenciennes, or at Carlton House over the supper and cards. Read Byron’s letters. So accustomed is the young man to oaths that he employs them even in writing to his friends, and swears by the post. Read his account of the doings of young men at Cambridge, of the ribald professors, one of whom “could pour out Greek like a drunken helot”, and whose excesses surpassed even those of the young men. Read Matthews’s description of the boyish lordling’s housekeeping at Newstead, the skull-cup passed round, the monks’ dresses from the masquerade warehouse, in which the young scapegraces used to sit until daylight, chanting appropriate songs round their wine. “We come to breakfast at two or three o’clock,” Matthews says. “There are gloves and foils for those who like to amuse themselves, or we fire pistols at a mark in the hall, or we worry the wolf.” A jolly life truly! The noble young owner of the mansion writes about such affairs himself in letters to his friend, Mr. John Jackson, pugilist, in London.|$|E

One of the fastest qualifiers in the sport and a tenacious racer, he excels across a wide range of areas. He has been described as having an aggressive driving style, which at times results in a tendency to lock up the front wheels. Hamilton explained how his driving style was influenced by watching his hero, Ayrton Senna, saying [...] "I think it’s partly because I watched Ayrton Senna when I was young and I thought 'this is how I want to drive when I get the opportunity' <b>and</b> I <b>went</b> <b>out</b> there <b>and</b> <b>tried</b> it on the kart track. My whole approach the racing has developed from there". Hamilton has received plaudits for his ability to adapt to variances in the car set-up and changing track conditions and throughout his career, he has typically used less fuel than his team-mates as a result of his ability to carry momentum through corners despite instability in the car. Hamilton has received praise for his ability to produce fast laps at crucial moments, particularly in qualifying and has been compared to his hero, Ayrton Senna, in raw speed.|$|R
