40|$|The {{present study}} {{was carried out in}} order to {{investigate}} the effect of summer and winter natural ventilation air exchange on psychrometric results in closed and open type poultry houses and the possibility of increasing its efficiency. This research had been conducted in three poultry houses located at different altitude that had different dimensions, construction and insulation levels. Inside and outside air temperature and relative humidity measured by sensors and averages were calculated for 2 hourly periods in 24 hours in summer and winter season. The data obtained from the experiments indicated a significant relationship between the efficiency of ventilation and structural dimensions. The necessary summer ventilation rate was calculated as 4. 5 m 3 h- 1 kg- 1 body mass and the inside and outside dry-bulb temperature difference was accepted as 2 oC. The natural ventilation design characteristics and structural dimensions necessary to increase the efficiency of natural ventilation system in poultry houses should be with the roof slope not less then 20 o– 30 o, the ridge provided with continuous capped ventilation opening, the proportion of the effective outlet area to <b>effective</b> <b>inlet</b> <b>area</b> (A 2 /A 1) at least 1 / 2 or 1 / 3, the ridge height of the building not less then 4 - 5 m and the building width not exceed 12 meters...|$|E
40|$|A {{piezoelectric}} fan is {{a flexible}} cantilever beam whose vibration is actuated {{by means of}} a piezoelectric material. Such fans have been employed for the enhancement of heat transfer by increasing the fluid circulation in regions which are otherwise stagnant. The main focus of past studies has been to predict and describe the heat transfer achievable using these devices, as well as the flow field generated by vibrating cantilevers. In order to directly compare these fans with their traditional counterparts such as small axial fans, the present work casts the performance of piezofans in terms of a characteristic often used to represent conventional fans, namely the fan curve. The primary focus {{of this paper is to}} determine the relationship between the pressure and the flow rate generated by miniature piezoelectric fans. Experimental measurements are obtained for fans with operating frequencies of 60 and 113 Hz. The maximum flow rate conditions yield nearly 30 l/min, while the greatest static pressure generated is found to be 6 Pa. The performance is highly dependent on both the vibration amplitude and frequency. Predictive relationships are developed to describe the experimental trends and provide insight into the sensitivity of pressure and flow rate to these operating parameters. These fans are directly compared to two commercially available axial fans, both in terms of overall performance and efficiency with which energy is imparted to the fluid. Piezoelectric fans are found to compare quite favorably using either of these performance metrics with a nearly order-of-magnitude increase in fan efficiency. A secondary focus of this paper is to explore the effects of fan installation details on fan performance. The proximity of surrounding walls is considered through the use of three different enclosures within which the fan is mounted. <b>Effective</b> <b>inlet</b> <b>areas</b> from which the air enters the fan are also identified. This paper provides a practical framework for determining the optimal placement and configuration for these fans in prototypical applications...|$|R
40|$|A {{simplified}} flowpath {{analysis of}} a single-tube airbreathing pulse detonation engine is described. The configura-tion consists of a steady supersonic inlet, a large plenum, a valve, and a straight detonation tube (no exit nozzle). The interaction of the filling process with the detonation is studied, and it is shown how the flow in the plenum is coupled with the flow in the detonation tube. This coupling results in total pressure losses and pressure oscillations in the plenum caused by the unsteadiness of the flow. Moreover, the filling process generates a moving flow into which the detonation has to initiate and propagate. An analytical model is developed for predicting the flow and estimating performance based on an open-system control volume analysis and gasdynamics. The existing single-cycle impulse model is extended to include the effect of filling velocity on detonation tube impulse. Based on this, the engine thrust {{is found to be}} the sum of the contributions of detonation tube impulse, momentum, and pressure terms. Performance calculations for pulse detonation engines operating with stoichiometric hydrogen–air and JP 10 –air are presented and compared to the performance of the ideal ramjet over a range of Mach numbers.

40|$|Three {{hydrogen}} electrode-supported, large-scale solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs) {{with different}} composite air electrodes, namely LSM-YSZ, LSC-GDC, and LSCF-GDC (LSM, LSC, and LSCF cells, respectively), were compared for performance and degradation {{in the same}} three cell stack with an H 2 O/H- 2 ratio of 90 / 10. The initial SOEC performance increased in the following order: LSM, LSCF, and LSC. The three cells were operated at a constant current density of 0. 50 A cm(- 2) for 640 h during hydrogen production at 750 degrees C. After the operation, the 10 cm x 10 cm large-scale single cell was divided equally into four subparts from the two diagonal parts with the steam or air <b>inlet</b> <b>area</b> and steam or air outlet area for post-mortem analysis. Delamination mainly occurred in the steam and air <b>inlet</b> <b>areas</b> of the LSM and LSC cells, with more severe delamination in the steam <b>inlet</b> <b>area</b> than that in the air <b>inlet</b> <b>area.</b> Agglomeration of Ni in the Ni-YSZ hydrogen electrode was observed in the LSM and LSCF cells, whereas honeycomb Ni was observed in the steam and air <b>inlet</b> <b>areas</b> of the LSC cell.

40|$|The {{changes in}} the anode and cathode {{potentials}} of a phosphoric acid fuel cell under various conditions were studied using a single cell equipped with four reversible hydrogen electrodes located near the inlets and outlets. When pure hydro-gen gas {{was used as a}} fuel, the polarizations under load were homogeneous in the plane of the cell. However, when the re-formate gas was used, inhomogeneity in the plane arose under load. The cathode and anode potentials hifted in the posi-tive direction at the fuel outlet area. The potential shifts increased with an increase of fuel utilization or due to CO poisoning. The voltage loss due to CO poisoning (CO loss) caused an increase not only of the anode polarization but also of the cathode polarization in the fuel <b>inlet</b> <b>area.</b> The increase of cathode polarization at the fuel <b>inlet</b> <b>area</b> was due to current convergence into the fuel <b>inlet</b> <b>area.</b> The potential shifts at the fuel outlet can be attributed to he acidity change of electro-lyte there.

40|$|The Crew Exploration Vehicle Parachute Assembly System (CPAS) {{is being}} {{designed}} {{to land the}} Orion Crew Module (CM) at a safe rate of descent at splashdown with a cluster of two to three Main parachutes. The instantaneous rate of descent varies based on parachute fly-out angles and geometric <b>inlet</b> <b>area.</b> Parachutes in a cluster oscillate between significant fly-out angles and colliding into each other. The former presents a sub-optimal <b>inlet</b> <b>area</b> and the latter lowers the effective drag area as the parachutes interfere with each other.

An axisymmetric RBCC engine was used to determine specific impulse efficiency values based upon both full flow and gas generator configurations.

40|$|Natural {{ventilation}} {{driven by}} a solar chimney attached to a single-room building was studied experimentally using a small-scale model. The experiments were performed using a recently developed fine-bubble technique in which fine hydrogen bubbles are produced electrolytically in salt solution to simulate the buoyancy effect in the chimney caused by temperature differences. During the experiments, one sidewall of the solar chimney was uniformly "heated", corresponding to a uniformly distributed solar radiation incidence. Velocities at the room inlet were measured by a particle tracking method; in turn, the average flow rate through the solar chimney system was determined. Parameters studied in the experiments were the cavity width of the solar chimney, the solar radiation intensity, the ventilation <b>inlet</b> <b>areas,</b> and the solar chimney height. Results showed that for a given building geometry and <b>inlet</b> <b>areas,</b> there is an optimum cavity width at which maximum ventilation flow rate can be achieved.
