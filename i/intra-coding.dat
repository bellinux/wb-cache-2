Classic periodic <b>intra-coded</b> frames can add some protection and additionally facilitate random access, but within mobile networks with bandwidth constraints their disadvantages may outweigh their advantages. By analyzing the received video quality across {{a variety of}} video clips it becomes apparent that, for semi-active video sequences, cyclic <b>intra-coded</b> line placement results in superior video quality in the face of errors. For more active sequences, the quality gain is reduced but, for an equivalent constant bitrate, usually remains better than periodic <b>intra-coded</b> frames.

30|$|After the {{template}} frame is constructed, detecting all the transition effects for locating slow-motion replays {{can be done}} effectively. One possible way is to generate the processing units by the similar procedures in {{the template}} training phase, that is, some refined processing units are extracted, and their DC frames are compared with the template frame based on the similarity of colors and masks. Nevertheless, the misses of detecting the effects may occur. In order to find all the transition effects related to the slow-motion replays, we choose a rather conservative way by matching the frames near the detected scene-change frames with the template. Because the number of scene changes is large in a video, we employ the <b>intra-coding</b> rate of P frames to reduce such cases of matching. According to Figure 5, the <b>intra-coding</b> rate in a P frame is usually quite high. Therefore, when we construct the template of the transition effect in this video, we also calculate {{the average of the}} largest <b>intra-coding</b> rate in the effect and scale this value by a factor (0.7) as the threshold. Given a scene-change frame, we check the intra coding rates of P frames in around 2 seconds’ span. If the <b>intra-coding</b> rate of P frame is higher than this threshold, the matching of these DC frames with the template frame will be done to determine whether a transition effect happens here. This method can effectively avoid skipping the possible transition effects and an efficient implementation can also be achieved. Again, the matching is basically executed by comparing the luminance values of pixels covering the effect in the template frame.|$|E

30|$|The high {{efficiency}} video coding (HEVC) standard supports a flexible coding tree unit (CTU) partitioning structure, and thus coding efficiency is improved significantly. However, {{the use of}} this technique inevitably results in greatly increased encoding complexity. In order to reduce the complexity of <b>intra-coding,</b> we propose a hybrid scheme consisting of fast coding unit (CU) size decision and fast prediction unit (PU) mode decision processes. An adaptive method is utilised to measure the homogeneity of video content thus avoiding unnecessary rate distortion (RD) evaluations. The depth range to be tested is narrowed based on the partitioning parameters of the spatially adjacent CUs and the temporally co-located CU. Furthermore, the mode correlation between neighbouring frames and between adjacent coding levels in the same quad-tree structure is taken into account to predict the most probable directional mode. The number of candidate PU modes is further decreased according to the Hadamard cost. Experimental results illustrate that our scheme achieves a significant reduction in computational complexity of HEVC <b>intra-coding.</b> Compared with the HM encoder, the encoding time is reduced by up to 71 % with negligible degradation in coding efficiency.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—With {{the growing}} demands for 3 D and multi-view video content, {{efficient}} depth data coding becomes a vital issue in image and video coding field. In this paper, we propose a simple depth coding scheme using multiple prediction modes exploiting temporal correlation of depth map. Current depth coding techniques mostly depend on <b>intra-coding</b> mode that cannot get {{the advantage of}} temporal redundancy in the depth maps and higher spatial redundancy in inter-predicted depth residuals. Depth maps are characterized by smooth regions with sharp edges that {{play an important role}} in the view synthesis process. As depth images are more sensitive to coding errors, use of transformation or approximation of edges by explicit edge modelling has impact on view synthesis quality. Moreover, lossy compression of depth map brings additional geometrical distortion to synthetic view. In this paper, we have demonstrated that encoding inter-coded depth block residuals with quantization at pixel domain is more efficient than the <b>intra-coding</b> techniques relying on explicit edge preservation. On standard 3 D video sequences, the proposed depth coding has achieved superior image quality of synthesized views against the new 3 D-HEVC standard for depth map bit-rate 0. 25 bpp or higher.

30|$|As {{mentioned}} earlier, for I-frames, the bitstream of the HL scheme only contains high bit-depth information. Intuitively, {{this will}} result in bandwidth inefficiency if the receiver uses a low bit-depth display device, {{especially in the case}} where a small GOP size is adopted and the data in the I-frames dominate the bitstream. To improve the coding efficiency in such situations, we combine the HL scheme with the LH scheme to form a hybrid LH-HL scheme in which the intra-MBs and inter-MBs are encoded by the LH scheme and the HL scheme, respectively. It means that intra-mode-encoding path in the LH scheme and inter-mode-encoding path in the HL scheme are combined in the LH-HL scheme. For every high bit-depth MB in the LH-HL scheme, either intra-mode or inter-mode is chosen by comparing the R-D cost. It means that the R-D cost of <b>intra-coding</b> by the LH scheme and the R-D cost of inter-coding by the HL scheme will be compared. If the R-D cost of <b>intra-coding</b> by the LH scheme is smaller, then this MB is encoded as intra-mode; otherwise, it is inter-mode and encoded by the HL scheme. The combined LH-HL scheme tries to improve the coding performance of the HL scheme in the above situation.|$|E

It has spurred the development of broadband access and slowly gained increasing prominence especially for multimedia-rich Internet contents. Operators are now under pressure to efficiently use available resources for delivering targeted contents in a reliable and consistent manner. The present work proposes a new strategy to select <b>intra-coded</b> frames that best represent the entire video. The proposed approach, tri-step approach, uses low-level image features to select representative key frames which enable random access to any part of the video sequence while avoiding the overhead incurred to transmit periodic <b>intra-coded</b> frames. The first step discriminates non-transition frames by checking adjacent frame characteristics using low level features. The second step refines our selection of key frame by dropping non-commonly browsed frames, being the non-informative frames. The final step verifies the remaining frames if they are far apart in time to maintain the efficiency of video delivery over low bit rate channel. Thirteen video sequences, obtained from MPEG- 4 industry forum, are used in the experiments. A framework, named the Video Browsing and Retrieval (VBaR), is developed and it allows user to analyze input videos at their full control. Experimental results, using the proposed framework, show the ability to effectively select <b>intra-coded</b> frames in video delivery.
