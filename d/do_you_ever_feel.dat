60|$|Now, {{every man}} and woman of us here, who has one spark of good feeling in them, will surely agree, that coming to shame is dreadful; {{and that there is}} no pain or torment on earth like the pain of being ashamed of oneself: nothing so painful. And I will prove it to you. You call a man a brave man, if he is afraid of nothing: but there is one thing the very bravest man is afraid of, and that is of disgrace, of coming to shame. Ay, my friends, so terrible is the torment of shame, that you may see brave men,--men who would face death in battle, men who would have a limb cut off without a groan, you may see such, in spite of all their courage, gnash their teeth, and writhe in agony, and weep bitter tears, simply because they are ashamed of themselves, so terrible and {{unbearable}} is the torment of shame. It may drive a man to do good or evil: it may drive him to do good; as when, rather than come to shame, and be disgraced, soldiers will face death in battle willingly and cheerfully, and do deeds of daring beyond belief: or it may drive him to do evil; rather than come to shame, men have killed themselves, choosing, unhappy and mistaken men, rather to face the torment of hell than the torment of disgrace. They are mistaken enough, God knows. But shame, like all powerful things, will work for harm as well as for good; and just as a wholesome and godly shame may {{be the beginning of a}} man's repentance and righteousness, so may an unwholesome and ungodly shame be the cause of his despair and ruin. But judge for yourselves; think over your past lives. Were <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> once--were it but for five minutes-- utterly ashamed of yourself? If <b>you</b> were, <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>feel</b> any torment like that? In all other misery and torment one feels hope; one says, 'Still life is worth having, and when the sorrow wears away I shall be cheerful and enjoy myself again:' but when one has come to shame, when one is not only disgraced in the eyes of other people, but disgraced (which is a thousand times worse) in one's own eyes; when one feels that people have real reason to despise one, then one feels for the time as if life was not worth having; as if one did not care whether one died or not, or what became of one: and yet as if dying would do one no good, change of place would do one no good, time's running on would do one no good; as if what was done could not be undone, and the shame would be with one still, and torment one still, wherever one was, and if one was to live a million years: ay, that it would be everlasting: one feels, in a word, that real shame and deserved disgrace is verily and indeed an everlasting torment. And it is this, and the feeling of this, which explains why poor wretches will kill themselves, as Judas Iscariot did, and rush into hell itself, under the horror and pain of shame and disgrace. They feel a hell within them so hot, that they actually fancy that they can be no worse off beyond the grave than they are on this side of it. They are mistaken: but that is the reason; the misery of disgrace is so intolerable, that they are willing, like that wretched Judas, to try any mad and desperate chance to escape it.|$|R

S. adolescent population, {{and suicide}} {{is the second}} {{leading cause of death}} among adolescents. The prevalence of sexually transmitted infections (STI) among U. S. adolescents ranges from 14 - 43. 9 %, and while rates of adolescent pregnancy have declined in the U. S. in the last decade, the U. S. rates are still high relative to other developed countries. There are currently no studies that examine the association between depression, suicidality, and risky sexual behavior (RSB) among adolescents. Using national data from the CDC's 2009 and 2011 Youth Risk Behavior Surveys (YRBS), our objectives were to: determine if adolescents who are depressed and suicidal are {{more likely to engage in}} risky sexual behavior than those without depression and those with depression without suicidal behaviors. Methods Participants in this cross-sectional study were adolescent YRBS respondents in grades 9 - 12 who were sexually active (N= 12, 311). Depression was measured through a single question, (“During the past 12 months, <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>feel</b> so sad or hopeless almost every day for two weeks or more in a row that <b>you</b> stopped <b>doing</b> some usual activities?”). Depression with suicidality was measured as a positive response to the question regarding depression, plus a positive response to one or more of the three questions about suicidality (“During the past 12 months, <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> seriously [consider/plan/attempt] suicide?”), and analyzed as a trichotomous variable. RSB was assessed using binary variables for each behavior: condom nonuse, birth control nonuse, drug/alcohol use at last sexual intercourse, or having had 4 + sexual partners. An additional dichotomous variable was created to examine the odds of engaging in any RSB. Logistic regression was conducted to determine the association between depression, suicidality, and RSB, and results were stratified by gender. Participants who were not sexually active (N= 16, 994) or missing information on depression/suicidality status or RSB (N= 2, 409) were excluded from analysis. Results Depressive symptoms were reported by 44. 0 % of sexually active girls and 25. 5 % of sexually active boys, and suicidal ideation was reported by 27. 1 % of girls and 18. 0 % of boys. Sixty-two percent of sexually active boys and girls engaged in at least one risky sexual behavior. Boys who were depressed and suicidal were 1. 63 (95 % CI: 1. 22 - 2. 18) times more likely to engage in risky behavior as those who were depressed only. They were 2. 35 (95 % CI: 1. 81 - 3. 05) times more likely to have not used a condom the last time they had sex, 2. 39 (95 % CI: 1. 81 - 3. 16) times more likely not to have used birth control, and 2. 02 (95 % CI: 1. 36 - 2. 49) times more likely to have used alcohol or drugs the last time they had sex, compared to boys who were depressed only. Girls who were depressed and suicidal were 1. 49 (95 % CI: 1. 20 - 1. 84) times more likely to engage in risky behavior as those who were depressed only. They were 1. 39 (95 % CI: 1. 15 - 1. 70) times more likely to have not used a condom the last time they had sex, 1. 44 (95 % CI: 1. 17 - 1. 76) times more likely not to have used birth control, and 1. 42 (95 % CI: 1. 13 - 1. 75) times more likely to have had 4 + sexual partners, compared to girls who were depressed only. Eighty-one percent of boys who reported binge-drinking reported engaging in at least one RSB, compared to 56. 6 % of boys who were not binge-drinkers, and 76. 8 % of girls who reported binge-drinking reported engaging in at least one RSB, compared to 57. 0 % of girls who were not binge-drinkers. Conclusion Adolescents who are depressed and suicidal are at increased odds for engaging in RSB. Although causality cannot be established, involvement in any RSB is cause for concern and should be part of the clinical assessment of depression and suicidality among adolescent boys and girls...|$|R

40|$|<b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>feel</b> {{as though}} there aren’t enough hours {{in the day to}} {{accomplish}} the things you “have to ” and “should do, ” let alone the things you “want to”? While you might want {{to increase the amount of}} time your family spends together, the hands on the clock move very quickly and make it difficult to accomplish. How do you make the most of your time at home together? Strong families make it a priority to spend time together. Whether it is working on household chores, running errands, or playing a game, they show commitment to each other. When you or your partner spend many hours of the week away from home, it is often more difficult to enjoy time at home because of the pressure to accomplish everything that didn’t get done during the week. Research indicates that the partner left at home with children has a more difficult task than those without children. Juggling the multiple schedules and individual needs tends to create greater challenges. Children may feel neglected or disappointed when a parent can’t participate in their daily activities. Communication is key to helping them understand the choices and evaluate the expectations. Talk about what you can do with them and how to keep in touch when you are away. You need to ask yourself several questions: Why is your family so busy? Are the activities or involvements helping to strengthen your family, or are they causing you to spend more time apart? Is your lifestyle really worth it? What are your choices? Why are you making this decision? How can you best manage your time...|$|E
40|$|<b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>feel</b> {{overwhelmed}} by {{a constant stream}} of information? It can seem like there is a barrage of new email and text messages arriving, phone calls, articles to read, and knocks on the door. Putting these pieces together to keep track of what’s important can be a real challenge. The same information overload is of concern in many computational settings. For example, telecommunications companies want {{to keep track of the}} activity on their network, to identify the overall network health, and spot anomalies or changes in behavior. Yet, the scale of events occurring is huge: many millions of network events per hour, per network element. And while new technologies allow the scale and granularity of events being monitored to increase by orders of magnitude, the capacity of computing elements to make sense of these (processors, memory and disks) is barely increasing. Even on a small scale, the amount of information may be too large to store in an impoverished setting (say, an embedded device), or be too big to conveniently keep in fast storage. In response to this challenge, the model of streaming data processing has grown in popularity. In this setting, the aim is no longer to capture, store and index every minute event, but rather to quickly process each observation to create some summary of the current state. Following its processing, an event is dropped, and is no longer accessible. The summary that is retained is often referred to as sketch of the data. Coping with the vast scale of information means making a number of compromises: the description of the world is approximate, rather than exact; the nature of queries to be answered must be decided in advance, rather than after the fact; and some questions are now insoluble. However, the ability to process vast quantities of data at blinding speeds with modest resources can more than make up for these limitations. As a consequence, streaming methods have been adopted in a number of domains, starting with telecommunications, but spreading to search engines, social networks, finance, and time-series analysis. These ideas are also finding application in areas where traditional approaches are applicable, but the rough and ready sketching approach is more cost-effective. Successful applications of sketching involve a mixture of algorithmic tricks, systems know-how, and mathematical insight, and have led to new research contributions in each of these areas. In this article, we introduce the ideas behind, and applications, of sketching, with a focus on the algorithmic innovations. That is, we describe some algorithmic developments in the abstract, and then indicate the subsequent steps needed to put them into practice, with examples. We will see four novel algorithmic ideas, and discuss some emerging areas...|$|E
40|$|Background One of {{the main}} {{challenges}} in suicide prevention is that it cannot be predicted. Significant number of patients attempt suicide while being under psychiatric treatment. Lethality and intent of each risk factor varies and remains inconsistent. Though structured instruments have also been useful with limited success search for newer methods remains an urgent clinical need. We believe risk is multifactorial and a scale based upon fundamental domains of biological, psychological, social, environmental, spiritual and clinical origin can elucidate more specific factors. Scale for impact of suicidality- Management, Assessment 2 ̆ 6 Planning of care-brief screener (SISMAP-bcs) is 23 item scale which is valid, reliable and easy to administer. In this study {{we are trying to}} examine significant risk factors for suicide based upon findings of this scale. Method This is open level, naturalistic study. Consenting psychiatric patients from out patient and in-patient facility of a tertiary psychiatric hospital were recruited. All patients were assessed on of clinical, phenomenological and psychopathological parameters using standard psychometric tools and SIS-MAP brief screener was used for assessment of suicide-related variables. We completed assessment of 79 patients, in this sample 37 were males. mean age was 38. 26 (SD 14. 78, range 19 - 75). 44 patients were hospitalized and 35 were on outpatient treatment. The score of SISMAP cut-off score is 6 for outpatient treatment, 7 and 8 for decision based upon clinical judgment and 9 and above for hospitalization. A score of 8 and above was suggestive of high risk. Out findings suggest significant factors for suicide. 1) Shorter duration of illness (r= 0. 0334, p 3 ̆c 0. 05) 2) Severity of depressive symptoms (r= 0. 62, p 3 ̆c 0. 001) 3) severity of psychotic symptoms (r= 0. 413, p= 0. 014). 4) Being single (f= 3. 071, p= 0. 042). 5) Suicide being reason for admission (f= 4. 238, p= 0. 008). 6) History of physical assault (f= 5. 078, p= 0. 031) and 7) Interpersonal problem in family (f= 7. 931, p= 0. 008). The scale also identified the questions, which were most significant. Few such questions are 1) is your family supportive of your problem? 2) When you have thoughts about hurting yourself or about death, 3) can you control these thoughts? 4) Do you savor your lifesatisfying moments? 5) Do you find it difficult to know where to find/access health care services? 6) <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>feel</b> like there is no meaning or purpose in your life? Conclusion The The study shows that some of the clinically relevant factors which were indicative of high suicidality. The study also identifies significant risk factors associated with high risk of suicide. We conclude that a number of clinical factors, which suggest high risk, can be captured by multidimensional assessment scale in routine clinical work.
