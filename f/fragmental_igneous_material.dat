40|$|On a grey but fine Saturday {{morning the}} field party {{gathered}} at {{the offices of the}} New Cliffe Hill Quarry at the start of an excursion aimed at exploring two facets of Charnwood Forest’s Precambrian geology. At the Old Cliffe Hill Quarry, rocks representing the very final intrusive stage of Precambrian magmatic activity are well displayed. By contrast, at Whitwick Quarry, a diverse assemblage of massive to <b>fragmental</b> <b>igneous</b> rocks is related to the earlier, extrusive phase of volcanic activity that was responsible for the accumulation of the volcano-sedimentary sequences forming the eastern outcrops of the Charnian Supergroup. Both quarries also offer sections through the highly irregular unconformity between Precambrian and Triassic rocks, and in particular they reveal the details of ‘wadis’, which are remnants of the Charnwood landscape as it existed about 240 million years ago. Safety regulations precluded the close examination of the higher quarry faces, but good examples of the range of lithologies abounded in the various piles of quarry waste, and were augmented by information obtained during previous visits by the excursion leader...|$|R

50|$|The {{material}} forming LaBarge Rock was injected in {{the form}} of a stock. Over geologic time crustal movement brought these injected igneous rocks to the surface of the earth.

50|$|Although {{commonly}} referred to as a plateau, the Millevaches Massif is actually more like a shallow dome, deeply dissected by streams and rivers, and slightly tilted, with the south-eastern edge elevated and more exposed.

40|$|Abstract: The {{emplacement}} of <b>igneous</b> <b>material</b> into upper crustal {{rocks of}} sedimentary basins {{is likely to}} be strongly controlled by the geometry of the pre-existing basin structures. These controls are investigated using examples from the Tertiary igneous complexes of Skye, part of the Sea of Hebrides basin of NW Scotland. The basin consists of an array of half-graben related to SE-dipping normal faults. These pre-volcanic, Mesozoic structures are traced near the igneous complexes using geological relationships preserved unconformably beneath the widespread basaltic lava fields. The unconformity represents a period of Cretaceous uplift and denudation of the basin and its flanks, entirely pre-dating the Tertiary volcanism of NW Scotland. This unconformity seals stratigraphically the major basin faults, preserving field relationships that permit the tracing of these faults in the country rocks to the Tertiary intrusions. The major Camasunary fault is separated from the Raasay fault via a series of minor graben, linked by a series of steep, NW-SE-trending faults that transfered Mesozoic displace-ments between the principal fault strands. A broad range of <b>igneous</b> <b>material</b> of various compositions was intruded into part of the Mesozoic Sea of Hebrides basins and their flanks during Palaeocene times. Different emplacement styles and different structural controls are found. The major gabbroic centres {{do not appear to be}} controlled b...|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} first {{measurements}} of vanadium (V) stable isotopes for six reference materials - USGS PCC- 1, BHVO- 2, BCR- 2, BIR- 1 a, GSP- 2 and AGV- 2 - plus the widely available carbonaceous chondrite Allende. We present standard addition and matrix spiking tests {{to assess the}} robustness and reproducibility of our data. Standard addition utilised an enriched 50 V solution designated VISSOX (Vanadium Isotope Standard Solution OXford). We further assessed the veracity of the method by spiking collected sample matrices with {{the same amount of}} a V standard solution, whose isotopic composition was defined as 0 ‰. Standard addition and matrix spiking tests recorded no appreciable artificial isotope fractionation. We estimate that the best currently attainable long-term reproducibility of stable 51 V/ 50 V isotope measurements in complex matrices is 0. 15 ‰, which is in the same order as the reproducibility achievable with standard solutions. Finally, a large range of ∼ 1. 2 ‰ in stable V isotopic composition was documented, with ∼ 0. 5 ‰ of that variation in high temperature <b>igneous</b> <b>materials</b> alone. The range and resolving power of V stable isotopes, with respect to <b>igneous</b> <b>material,</b> compared favourably with the magnitude of fractionation reported for other non-traditional stable isotope systems, which bodes well for the utility of this new system. © 2011 The Authors.

50|$|One key {{question}} {{about the nature of}} Tharsis has been whether the bulge is mainly the product of active crustal uplifting from buoyancy provided by the underlying mantle plume or whether it is merely a large, static mass of <b>igneous</b> <b>material</b> supported by the underlying lithosphere.

The enormous sagging weight of Tharsis has generated tremendous stresses in the crust, producing a broad trough around the region and an array of radial fractures emanating {{from the center of the}} bulge that stretches halfway across the planet.|$|R

50|$|The {{breakup of}} Gondwana {{began in the}} early Cretaceous (about 184-132 Mya). South America began to drift westward from Africa as the South Atlantic Ocean opened, {{resulting}} in complete open marine conditions by 110 Mya. During this, the Owambo Basin was reactivated as a pull-apart rift basin pulling apart from the east to the west, but received compression from the opening of the Damara Belt to its south. This created rotational seismic wrench systems across the basin profile. These wrench systems allowed for intrusions of continental igneous deposits: sills and dikes, along with pegmatites from metasomatized country rock.

40|$|Progress in {{petrography}} {{and chemical}} characterization of <b>igneous</b> lithic <b>material</b> and artifacts {{have been used}} to infer culture history, land use patterns, and potential exchange networks across British Columbia in recent years. This thesis examines the petrographic and geochemical characteristics of igneous flake samples collected from the Punchaw Lake Village site (FiRs- 1), located west of Quesnel, British Columbia. The flakes are primarily composed of trachydacite and dacite of one or more unknown provenances. The primary objective {{of this study was to}} determine the possible sources of these <b>igneous</b> <b>materials</b> used in the production of the artifact assemblage.

The geochemical data were subjected to multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analysis to aid the interpretations of the results. Results indicate that the lithic sample from Punchaw Lake Village site originates from more than one rock type, suggesting that the site inhabitants may have engaged in exchange and/or movement throughout the Nechako Plateau.

40|$|NOTE: Text or symbols not renderable {{in plain}} ASCII are {{indicated}} by [ [...] . ]. Abstract is included in. pdf document. The Manicouagan-Mushalagan Lakes structure {{is an area}} of anomalous geological features in the Grenville Province terrain of northeastern Canada. Three features of this structure have been revealed by geological studies: (1) The Grenville gneisses and anorthosites which outcrop in the area between the arcuate lakes have been shock metamorphosed. (2) The shocked Grenville gneisses are covered by a thin, discontinuous layer of shock breccia and thin outcrops of Ordovician limestone. (3) An annular-shaped body of Permo-Triassic, igneous, andesitic rock, which shows no signs of shock metamorphism, overlies the shocked gneisses, the shock breccia and the Ordovician limestone. This rock (monzonite) is 800 feet thick at a maximum. The shocked basement rocks in the structure were most probably caused by the impact of an extraterrestrial body, but the origin of the igneous rock unit is not completely understood. This latter unit has been hypothesized to be either (1) a shock-melted breccia or (2) a later, secondary igneous event occurring at the crater site due to disruptions of the earth's thermal regime around the impact site. A geochronological study of this structure was made to determine which, if either, of the above modes of formation for the <b>igneous</b> <b>material</b> is likely. 		 [ [...] . ] data for the <b>igneous</b> <b>material</b> and rock units related to it yield a well-defined crystallization age of [ [...] . ]. [ [...] . ] data for this unit indicate that it has experienced no subsequent metamorphism. Argon isotopic ages obtained for a series of shock-sequence anorthosites do not indicate a well-defined time of shock metamorphism; the ages could characterize a system shocked at anytime between 320 and 210 m. y. ago which then suffered a secondary gas loss. It is shown that anorthosites yielding ages between 280 and 320 m. y. probably underwent complete or nearly complete outgassing at the time of shock. These latter ages should therefore yield a good impact age. The time interval within which the impact took place is thought to be 280 - 320 m. y. ago. The [ [...] . ] data show unexpected evidence for the occurrence of a secondary event at about 100 - 110 m. y. which affected the anorthosites in the crater but not the igneous monzonite. Since {{it is not possible to}} say with certainty when the meteoritic impact took place, the difference between the monzonite formation time and the impact time is unclear. The suggested impact time is, however, significantly earlier than the crystallization time of the <b>igneous</b> <b>material.</b> This suggests that a secondary formation mode for this material is more likely than an impact melt formation mode. A secondary mode is also compatible with evidence that the monzonite formed in a subsurface environment with [ [...] . ]...|$|R
