40|$|In the {{extrusion}} {{blow moulding}} process, the strength and weight of a <b>hollow</b> <b>article,</b> such as a bottle, is controlled by an open loop control process called parison programming. The article thickness is increased and decreased by opening and closing the gap of the annular die from which the parison is extruded. The die gap is regulated according to a gap-time profile which an operator determines during start up by trial and error. An optical sensor has been developed which can measure the thickness profile of the parison on-line just prior to its enclosure in the mould. The device will help operators to program the gap-time profile for optimum use of plastic by providing rapid feedback on {{the formation of the}} parison. It also represents an important step toward the development of closed loop control for container thickness distribution. The device determines thickness by striking the parison at an angle with a laser beam and measuring the separation between the beams that reflect from the outer and inner surfaces of the parison wall. A prototype was built and tested. The prototype uses three lasers at different angles and can make up to 250 point measurements during a one second scan. A personal computer uses specially developed software to reconstruct the profile of the parison wall from the raw data with an accuracy of $ pm$ 5 %...|$|E

5|$|The {{industry}} expanded {{rapidly in}} the 1940s because World WarII created a huge demand for inexpensive, mass-produced products. In 1946, American inventor James Watson Hendry built the first screw injection machine, which allowed much more precise control over the speed of injection {{and the quality of}} articles produced. This machine also allowed material to be mixed before injection, so that coloured or recycled plastic could be added to virgin material and mixed thoroughly before being injected. Today, screw injection machines account {{for the vast majority of}} all injection machines. In the 1970s, Hendry went on to develop the first gas-assisted injection moulding process, which permitted the production of complex, <b>hollow</b> <b>articles</b> that cooled quickly.

40|$|The {{method of}} obtaining of {{cylinder}} necks by block pressing with the backpressure on an internal surface of preform is presented. The finite element method carries out the calculated analysis of traditional block pressing and block pressing with a backpressure of cylinder necks on tubular preforms in a spherical matrix. Finite shapes of products are defined at traditional block pressing and block pressing with a backpressure. The backpressure usage eliminates fracture of the preform metal at a deforming and heightening of cylinder necks. Force conditions of the preforms forming, the stress-strain state of metal and exact sizes of cylinder necks are calculated. Backpressure operation leads to heightening of intensity of strains and a reinforcement of metal after block pressing. The aforesaid ensures reliability of a screw joint of the block pressed articles with other details. The further explorations of block pressing with a backpressure are necessary to lead in a direction of obtaining of cylinder necks on the <b>hollow</b> <b>articles</b> with a bottom, and also determinations of effect of width of a wall of preform on cylinder necks forming. ?????? ?????? ????????? ???????? ??????? ? ??????????? ??????????????? ?? ?????????? ??????????? ?????????. ??????? ??????? ????????? ???????? ????????? ?????? ????????????? ?????? ? ?????? ? ???????????????? ???????? ?? ????????? ?????????? ? ??????????? ???????. ??????????? ???????? ????? ??????? ??? ???????????? ?????? ? ?????? ? ????????????????. ?????????? ??????????????? ????????? ?????????? ??????? ??? ?????????????? ? ??????????? ?????? ????????. ?????????? ??????? ?????? ???????????????? ???????, ??????????-??????????????? ????????? ??????? ? ?????? ??????? ????????. ???????? ??????????????? ???????? ? ????????? ????????????? ?????????? ? ?????????? ??????? ????? ??????...|$|R

The definition of strategic culture as the political and institutional confidence and processes to manage and deploy military force, coupled with external recognition of the EU as a legitimate actor in the military sphere, lends itself to a reappraisal around four core questions. First, military capabilities: establishing a European strategic culture is vital in order to rationalize the acquisition of capabilities necessary for the range of humanitarian and peacekeeping tasks envisaged. Equally, without military capabilities, all talk of a strategic culture would ring <b>hollow.</b> This <b>article</b> discusses how much closer the EU has come to acquiring those essential capabilities. Second, while the EU has gained significant experience of, albeit limited, military/policing experiences and established a growing reputation and some credibility for ad hoc action, to what extent and in what quarters have these experiences engendered a sense of reliability and legitimacy for autonomous EU action? Third, given that so far operations in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Balkans have depended on an integrated civil–military effort, do the policy-making processes of the EU now ensure the appropriate level and depth of civil–military integration?

40|$|Rotational {{moulding}} is {{a method}} for producing <b>hollow</b> plastic <b>articles.</b> Nowadays the advantages which it has to offer {{in terms of the}} economic production of quite complex, stress-free articles has made it a very competitive alternative to blow moulding and injection moulding. Rotational moulding is unique amongst plastics moulding processes because the heating, shaping and cooling of the plastic all take place inside the mould with no application of pressure. In this research, oil palm empty fruit bunch fibre reinforced polyethylene (EFB-PE) composites which is using high density polyethylene (HDPE) have been produced using a rotational moulding as the compounding equipment. Three levels of EFB were employed; 5 %, 10 %, 15 % and 20 % of the total weight of the sample. Two types of coupling agent, maleic anhydride polyethylene (MaPE) and vinyl trimethoxy silane (VTMS) were used. Overall, both coupling agents imparted considerable improvement in the impact strength and tensile modulus, MaPE showed the highest enhancement. However, only MaPE treated EFB-PE was observed to improve flexural strength and tensile strength. The effect of different fiber length size (75 - 150, 150 - 250, 250 - 400 ~m) was also investigated; the result showed that all mechanical properties decreased with increasing filler loading. These have been attributed by the poor dispersion of the fiber in matrix and the presence of fiber bundles that remain intact even after several types of surface treatment were carried out. Thus, the role of EFB as reinforcing agent is not fully realized...|$|R
40|$|AbstractEvaluation {{of thermal}} shock stress {{intensity}} factors {{is a problem}} of interest in many industries. Many structures experiencing thermal shock can be accurately idealised to comprise finite length elastically/thermo-elastically restrained plates and finite length elastically/thermo-elastically restrained <b>hollow</b> cylinders. This <b>article</b> describes how a ‘user-friendly‘ Compliance Adjusted Weight Function (CAWF) approach can be used to assess mode I stress intensity factor associated with the creep-free thermal shock of such structure with edge and semi-elliptical surface cracks. Based upon a mechanical weight function philosophy, the CAWF approach utilises a mechanical weight function analysis, available mechanical weight functions/geometry factors attributed to an equivalent semi-infinite cracked structure, a crack-free finite element analysis and an elastic Line-Spring analysis of compliance. The need for deriving different weight functions at each configuration of boundary restraint is therefore removed and the results of several verification exercises highlight that the CAWF approach is suitable for estimates within 5 – 10 % of benchmark fracture mechanics finite element values. This suitability of the CAWF approach is valid {{for a wide range of}} cracked plate configurations, cracked hollow cylinder configurations and boundary restraint. An exception to this suitability is observed when examining semi-elliptical surface crack configurations and a free or near free boundary restraint condition. Adjustments to correction for this ‘free boundary effect’ are discussed elsewhere...|$|R
40|$|International audienceRotational Molding is {{the best}} method for {{producing}} large <b>hollow</b> plastic <b>articles</b> without weld lines, such as kayak, tanks, large bins, etc. But it is a quite complex and empirical process. Constant quality in technical parts requires the mastery of the process by controlling on line the main physical phenomena. One of these of first importance is heat transfers. During the processing time, polymer powder melts, then the phenomena of particle coalescence and melt densification occur. After cooling, the molded part is obtained. The understanding of sintering phenomenon, linked to polymer structure, may explain surface defects and bubbles in rotationally molded parts. This presentation {{is divided into two}} parts: the first part deals with the relationship between the material structure, the process and the final properties; the second part deals with the modelization of heat transfers during the process. Firstly, material properties such as polymer structure, rheological parameters and surface tension were studied and linked to sintering kinetics. The sintering phenomenon was investigated, including coalescence and densification, in order to examine the effect of particle size and shape. Moreover, existing sintering models were compared to experimental data and were improved. Secondly, sintering kinetics were bound to final parts properties. Indeed, samples were molded with a pilot-scale rotational molding machine. On these samples, some defects were detected such as inner roughness and bubbles. Samples mechanical properties were also studied. The effect of particle size and shape on samples properties was examined taking into account the sintering. Quantitative relationships were stablished. This work enabled us to model the sintering phenomenon and to bind its kinetics with polymer structure, rheological properties and final parts properties. An experimental analysis of heat transfer in rotational molding process was also lead. By using an instrumented mold associated with an original radio transmission data acquisition system, we demonstrate that the rotational nature of the process implies complex heat transfer evolutions in the mold. The crystallization of the material was modeled with accuracy by coupling heat transfer equation to a kinetic model determined by calorimetry. Moreover, a thermal model was developped by using a static heated plate in order to validate the numerical results. This modelization took into account the sintering phenomenon...|$|R
