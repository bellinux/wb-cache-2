50|$|The {{principal}} photography commenced on 12 December 2013 in Hyderabad and {{the first}} schedule <b>was</b> <b>wrapped</b> up nearly on 26 December 2013. The second schedule began in January 2014 and some crucial scenes were shot in that schedule at Hyderabad. The second schedule <b>was</b> <b>wrapped</b> up on 11 January 2014. After a gap due to Akkineni Nageswara Rao's death, Naga Chaitanya joined the film's shoot in February 2014. In mid-February 2014, {{it was reported that}} the film is in its third and last major schedule and majority of the talkie part was said to <b>be</b> <b>wrapped</b> up with patchwork and songs remained to be shot. The shooting continued at Annapurna Studios where some crucial scenes on the lead were shot. At the same time, it was announced that the talkie part of the film would <b>be</b> <b>wrapped</b> up by April 2014 and after shooting the songs in abroad, the film's shoot will <b>be</b> <b>wrapped</b> up thus making it a summer release.|$|R
5|$|Alison Hendrix {{returns home}} from rehab {{to find her}} husband Donnie drunk and chastises him. When she catches him trying {{to leave the house}} {{in the middle of the}} night, she persuades him not to give up on their marriage. In an effort to open up to him, she confesses that she played a role in the death of their {{neighbour}} Aynsley, and is shocked when Donnie responds by confessing that he accidentally shot and killed Dr. Aldous Leekie, the director of the Dyad Institute, the night before. When Alison asks what he did with Leekie's body, Donnie leads her to their garage where Leekie's corpse <b>is</b> <b>wrapped</b> in the trunk of their car.|$|E
5|$|The {{ceremony}} is often held weeks, months, or {{years after the}} death so that the deceased's family can raise the significant funds needed to cover funeral expenses. Torajans traditionally believe that death is not a sudden, abrupt event, but a gradual process toward Puya (the land of souls, or afterlife). During the waiting period, {{the body of the}} deceased <b>is</b> <b>wrapped</b> in several layers of cloth and kept under the tongkonan. The soul of the deceased is thought to linger around the village until the funeral {{ceremony is}} completed, after which it begins its journey to Puya.|$|E
5|$|The {{expression}} of genes {{is influenced by}} how the DNA is packaged in chromosomes, in a structure called chromatin. Base modifications can be involved in packaging, with regions that have low or no gene expression usually containing high levels of methylation of cytosine bases. DNA packaging and its influence on gene expression can also occur by covalent modifications of the histone protein core around which DNA <b>is</b> <b>wrapped</b> in the chromatin structure or else by remodeling carried out by chromatin remodeling complexes (see Chromatin remodeling). There is, further, crosstalk between DNA methylation and histone modification, so they can coordinately affect chromatin and gene expression.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} {{fragmented}} votive life-size sculptures of little children lying {{on their side}} and holding a pet animal or a small object were also recovered at the temple site; among {{the best known of}} these is a sculpture of a royal child holding a dove with his right hand; the boy's head is shaved, his torso is bare and his lower body <b>is</b> <b>wrapped</b> in a large cloth. The socle of this sculpture is inscribed with a dedication from Baalshillem, the son of a Sidonian king to Eshmun, which illustrates the importance of the site to the Sidonian monarchy. These votive sculptures appear to have been purposely broken after dedication to Eshmun and then ceremoniously cast into the sacred canal, probably simulating the sacrifice of the sick child. All of these sculptures represent boys. A limestone bust of a Kouros dating from the 6thcentury BC was found at the site, but unlike the archaic Greek kouroi this figure is not bare.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon is seen wearing {{clothing}} {{appropriate for}} his location: over his uniform {{he wears a}} long topcoat which <b>is</b> <b>wrapped</b> firmly around him, in which he keeps his gloveless right hand warm. He retains {{a piece of his}} dignity in the gold-trimmed black bicorne he wears on his head. The mule Napoleon rides is undernourished, tired from its ordeal in struggling through the Alps. On the left of the mule is his guide, Pierre Nicholas Dorsaz, who must constantly push himself and the mule forward, and who leans heavily on the shaft of wood he clutches in his left hand to allow himself to continue moving forward. His clothes are weather-beaten, his face ruddy from the cold. He is not allowed the luxury of riding an animal, for he must be able to navigate independently, on the ground.|$|E
5|$|Nomura {{redesigned}} Cloud for {{his appearance}} in Kingdom Hearts. He is depicted with a claw and a crimson cape, and {{the blade of}} his sword <b>is</b> <b>wrapped</b> in bandages. Stating that Cloud's left arm was inspired by Vincent Valentine, Nomura explained {{that he wanted to}} give the character a more demon-like appearance due to his ties to the dark side in the game. Nomura stated that he wanted to leave the question of whether Cloud was searching for Aerith open to the player's interpretation. Teruaki Sugawara, the game's voice director, recommended Takahiro Sakurai, Cloud's Japanese voice actor, to Nomura for the role. Nomura had originally asked Sakurai to play the protagonist of The Bouncer, Sion Barzahd, but found that his voice best suited Cloud after hearing him speak. Sakurai received the script without any accompanying visuals, and first arrived for recording under the impression that he would be voicing a different character than the one featured in Final Fantasy VII.|$|E

5|$|Slow-motion {{photography}} {{shows that}} the muscles have passive flexibility. They are first stretched while the frog {{is still in the}} crouched position, then they are contracted before being stretched again to launch the frog into the air. The fore legs are folded against the chest and the hind legs remain in the extended, streamlined position {{for the duration of the}} jump. In some extremely capable jumpers, such as the Cuban tree frog (Osteopilus septentrionalis) and the northern leopard frog (Rana pipiens), the peak power exerted during a jump can exceed that which the muscle is theoretically capable of producing. When the muscles contract, the energy is first transferred into the stretched tendon which <b>is</b> <b>wrapped</b> around the ankle bone. Then the muscles stretch again at the same time as the tendon releases its energy like a catapult to produce a powerful acceleration beyond the limits of muscle-powered acceleration. A similar mechanism has been documented in locusts and grasshoppers.|$|E
5|$|This emblem was in turn {{replaced}} by a new one in 1950. The central feature of this symbol is a crossed hammer and sickle, a universal Communist symbol symbolizing the unity of workers and peasants. Below this symbol, a sun is shown rising behind a globe. The insignia is framed by ears of wheat, each ear ending in flowers; clover {{on the left and}} flax on the right. A red ribbon <b>is</b> <b>wrapped</b> around the ears of wheat, reminiscent of the red flag used by the Communist movement. The base of the emblem shows the letters БССР. The ribbon features the phrase Workers of the World, Unite! The left side inscribed in Belarusian, the right side in Russian. The red star of Communism is featured above the hammer and sickle. The 1950 version was designed by Ivan Dubasov, a People's Artist of the USSR. Article 119 of the Constitution of the Byelorussian SSR defines the design of the emblem.|$|E
5|$|Before marriage, women {{used to wear}} a Kirgi (sari) and Baju (blouse). The Kirgi is a {{piece of}} cloth not longer than four feet, and about three feet wide. It was wrapped around the body from the waist down. A jacket with long sleeves called a Baju, was used to cover {{the upper part of the}} body. This dress was a sign of the bride's virginity and was worn during the Ros ceremony. The Kirgi was wrapped around the waist, but the end of the sari is not thrown over the shoulder. To wear the sari with its end thrown over the shoulder, known as Worl, is the {{exclusive}} right of a married woman. Married women used to wear sarees the general way. The Salwar kameez is another form of popular dress for females. The Mangalorean Catholic bride's wedding sari is known as a Sado. It is usually a red-coloured Banarasi sari which is made of finely woven silk and is decorated with elaborate engravings. In olden days, the bride wore on her head a red cloth, three feet square. Gold ornaments were absent in those days: the bride went to the church dressed as a virgin girl. In modern times, the bride wears (in place of the Kirgi) a red sari, but the end of the sari is not thrown over the shoulder; it <b>is</b> <b>wrapped</b> around the waist. The bride wears a few gold ornaments, some rings on the fingers, earrings, and at least two of the Dantoni (golden combs). Other ornaments worn by the bride in the olden days included Kanti, Chakrasar, Kap, Karap, Mugud, Kanto, and Dantoni.|$|E
