40|$|Motor-manual {{tree felling}} is {{commonly}} practiced {{in many regions}} of the world. Trees falling in unwanted directions cause severe accidents and extra work in motor-manual logging. Different kinds of manual tools can help force trees to fall in the desired direction, but their capacity are uncertain {{due to a lack}} of suitable evaluation methods. Reliable recommendations of felling tools’ limits could help reduce human injuries and damage to property. The objective of this study was, therefore, to develop and evaluate a realistic and convenient method for studying felling tools’ capacity in terms of the potential torque they can generate. A theoretical model of torque components was constructed and the mechanics of the falling tree and of the studied equipment were explained. The developed method uses real trees, which were cut at 1. 65 m above stump height to create trial stems. Trial stems were anchored to a neighboring tree and then cut as if they were to be felled. Standardized forces were applied to a forestry jack, <b>felling</b> <b>lever,</b> and wedge, and their effects on the trial stem were recorded by a load cell in the anchoring line. The method proved suitable for the evaluation of forestry jacks, while it needs improvements to evaluate felling levers and wedges thoroughly. Methodological improvements are suggested and practical applications are discussed and demonstrated in terms of the forestry jack’s capacity to deal with trees with unfavorable angles of inclination...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{with this}} study has been to build general models of the mechanics in tree felling with chain-saw and to compare felling torque for different tools. The theoretical models are completed and validated with a comparative study. The study includes {{a great number of}} felling tools of which some are used with different methods. Felling torque was measured using a naturally like measuring arrangement where a tree is cut at about 3. 7 m height and then anchored with a dynamometer to a tree opposite to the felling direction. Notch and felling cut was made as ordinary with exception that the hinge was made extra thin to reduce bending resistance. The tree was consequently not felled during the trials and several combinations of felling tools and individuals could be used on the same tree. The results show big differences between tools, methods and persons. The differences were, however, not general, but could vary depending on conditions (first of all tree diameters). Tools and methods that push or pull on the stem are little affected {{by the size of the}} tree, while tools that press on the stump are very much dependent of a large stump-diameter. Hand force asserted on a simple pole is consequently a powerful tool on small trees. For trees of medium size there are several alternative methods with different sizes and brands of <b>felling</b> <b>levers</b> and wedges. Larger and more ungainly tools and methods like tree pusher, winch, etc. develop very high felling torque on all tree sizes. On large trees also the felling wedge and especially the use of several wedges together develop very high felling torque...|$|R
5000|$|In China Shakes the World, James Kynge {{describes}} the phenomenon:...in the several weeks beginning in mid-February 2004, when, {{slowly at first}} but with mounting velocity, manhole covers started to disappear from roads and pavements around the world. As Chinese demand drove {{up the price of}} scrap metal to record levels, thieves almost everywhere had the same idea. As darkness <b>fell,</b> they <b>levered</b> up the iron covers and sold them to local merchants, who cut them up and loaded them onto ships to China. The first displacements were felt in Taiwan, the island country just off China's southeast coast. The next were in other neighbors such as Mongolia and Kyrgyzstan... Wherever the sun set, pilferers worked to satisfy China's hunger. More than 150 covers disappeared during one month in Chicago. Scotland's [...] "great drain robbery" [...] saw more than a hundred vanish in a few days. From Montreal to Gloucester to Kuala Lumpur, unsuspecting pedestrians stumbled into holes.|$|R
2500|$|Australia {{were set}} 416 runs for victory, in 1970 no Test team had ever {{made such a}} total to win a Test match and Bill Lawry {{announced}} there was [...] "no way" [...] they could win. It quickly became apparent that Australia would not be breaking any batting records as John Snow (7/40) soon dismissed Ian Redpath and both Chappells, Doug Walters <b>fell</b> to Peter <b>Lever,</b> one of Alan Knott's three catches, and Australia were 21/4. Bill Lawry (60 not out) and Keith Stackpole (30) took them to 60/4 by stumps, but Stackpole was caught off Snow the next morning, followed by Marsh for a duck. Willis (1/1) took his first Test wicket, Garth McKenzie retired hurt after being hit in the face by a rising ball from Snow and retired from Test cricket just two wickets short of Richie Benaud's Australian record haul of 248. Snow finished off the tail, bowling Gleeson for a duck and Connolly three balls later and Australia were all out for 116, Lawry carrying his bat throughout the debacle. It was a superb piece of fast bowling from Snow, aggressive, hostile and decisive.|$|R
5000|$|I had {{not seen}} an Englishman bowl either faster or better than Snow at Sydney since Tyson...In a fast bowler rhythm and {{accuracy}} generally go hand in hand. When everything is absolutely ticking, so to speak, a strong fellow like Snow finds not only an extra yard of pace but seems able to keep an unerring eye on the target. The merit of Snow is that in this form is not only that that high arm and loose wrist get the utmost life and lift from the pitch but that he is so extraordinarily straight.:E.W.
