25|$|In 1560, several {{score of}} Spanish conquistadors, {{and a hundred}} Indian slaves, march down from the newly conquered Inca Empire in the Andes {{mountains}} into the jungles to the east, {{in search of the}} fabled country of El Dorado.

On New Year's Eve, reaching the end of his supplies and unable to <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>without</b> more information, Pizarro orders a group of forty men to scout ahead by raft down river. If they do not return to the main party within one week with news of what lies beyond, they will be considered lost.

500|$|Played on the MCG, the December 1867 intercolonial between Victoria and New South Wales {{ended in}} a sound victory for the former, principally due to Wills' nine-wicket haul and Richard Wardill's century. Wills had been Victoria's {{preferred}} captain for over a decade. Writing in his sports column, Hammersley claimed that, as a paid cricketer, Wills lacked [...] "moral ascendancy" [...] over amateurs. When he lost the captaincy to Wardill, an amateur, {{on the eve of}} the March 1869 match against New South Wales, he refused to play under him, or, indeed, anyone else. The Victorians condemned Wills and resolved to <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>without</b> him, after which he retracted his decision not to play. This was the last intercolonial played on the Domain and Victoria recovered from Wardill's diamond duck to win by 78 runs. Wills scalped 7 wickets in a single innings.|$|E

On October 24, the band began a tour in support of the album, during which they began playing at small venues at college arenas. The tour lasted for six weeks. In November 2005, it was announced that guitarist Ben Harper had parted ways with the band. Key explained that the band went through [...] "a lot of the highest and lowest points" [...] and that making an album [...] "would be on the highest list, and losing a member would be on the lowest." [...] He also added, [...] "It's really been a long journey together, you know, so obviously, parting ways with Ben was a really unpleasant experience. It was either <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>without</b> him, or don't go on at all. And, at the core, we decided that we had something too great to let go of, and that we had to kind of make a last resort and move on without him." [...] Harper was replaced by Ryan Mendez.|$|E

Prince Mohamed bin Hussein told the country's chiefs [...] "We have money, and you will have your share if you join us. If not, we will <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>without</b> you". The chiefs agreed to mobilize their tribes. 6,000 royalist regulars and 50,000 armed tribesmen known as [...] "the Fighting Rifles" [...] surrounded San'a, captured its main airport and severed the highway to the port of Hodeida, a main route for Russian supplies. In a battle twelve miles east of the capital, 3,200 soldiers of both sides were killed, and an entire republican regiment reportedly deserted to the royalists. Bin Hussein gave them an ultimatum: [...] "Surrender the city or be annihilated". Iryani went to Cairo for what the Egyptian official press agency called [...] "a medical checkup". Foreign Minister Hassan Makki also left Yemen, leaving the government in charge of Amri. Amri declared a 6 p.m. curfew and ordered civilians to form militia units [...] "to defend the republic". In Liberation Square, six suspected royalist infiltrators were publicly executed by a firing squad, and their bodies were later strung up on poles.|$|E

500|$|The {{official}} summary {{synopsis of}} the film was published in The Moving Picture World. It states, [...] "A country girl becomes hopelessly stage struck when a company of barnstorming actors, presenting Shakespearean plays, appears in her home town. She applies for an engagement to {{the star of the}} organization and is finally offered a small part. Forbidden by her father to follow the career of her choice, she runs away and joins the company. Disillusionment soon follows. The stars dissatisfied with her attempts at acting, and the hard work and bad hotels soon tax her strength. While playing a one-night stand in a little town, the company is treated to a square meal by a prosperous young drummer [...] who is greatly attracted by the country girl's youth and beauty. The company get into financial straits, and have their baggage seized. Entirely without funds they start to walk to the next town. 'Walking the ties' is as new form of exercise for our heroine, and halfway on the journey she begs the company to <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>without</b> her, as she is too weary and sick to continue. Sitting alone and weeping bitterly on the steps of a forlorn little railway station, the girl is surprised to see, getting off the train, her new acquaintance, the drummer. He insists upon buying her a ticket for home and starting her off at once. The girl is welcomed back home by her father and when a few weeks later she receives together an offer of a New York engagement and an offer of marriage from the young drummer - she decides to accept the latter, and to appear in the future as - just a wife." ...|$|E

2500|$|In casting Good Morning, Miss Bliss, Peter Engel {{knew the}} success of the show would not hinge on Miss Bliss herself, but on her students.

[...] Engel insisted that the show could not <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>without</b> Zack Morris, but {{he turned out to be}} one of the most difficult characters to cast. Engel's casting director, Shana Landsburg, finally happened across fourteen-year old Mark-Paul Gosselaar and was immediately struck by the teen's charisma, charm, and good looks. After a quick read-through, Gosselaar was immediately given the role.|$|E
