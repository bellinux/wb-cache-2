5|$|<b>Feral</b> {{cats are}} {{domestic}} cats that {{were born in}} or have reverted to a wild state. They are unfamiliar with and wary of humans and roam freely in urban and rural areas. The numbers of <b>feral</b> cats is not known, but estimates of the US <b>feral</b> population range from 25 to 60million. <b>Feral</b> cats may live alone, but most are found in large colonies, which occupy a specific territory and are usually associated with a source of food. Famous <b>feral</b> cat colonies are found in Rome around the Colosseum and Forum Romanum, with cats {{at some of these}} sites being fed and given medical attention by volunteers.|$|E
5|$|<b>Feral</b> {{horses are}} born {{and live in}} the wild, but are descended from domesticated animals. Many populations of <b>feral</b> horses exist {{throughout}} the world. Studies of <b>feral</b> herds have provided useful insights into the behavior of prehistoric horses, as well as greater understanding of the instincts and behaviors that drive horses that live in domesticated conditions.|$|E
5|$|<b>Feral</b> {{dromedary}} populations {{occur in}} Australia, {{where it was}} introduced in 1840. The total dromedary population in Australia is 0.5 million as of 2005. Nearly 99% of the populations are <b>feral,</b> and have annual growth rate of 10%. Most of the Australian <b>feral</b> camels are dromedaries, {{with only a few}} Bactrian camels. Most of the dromedaries occur in Western Australia, with smaller populations in the Northern Territory, Western Queensland and northern South Australia.|$|E
5|$|<b>Feral</b> zerg are zerg {{not under}} the control of any higher entity. These zerg will simply devolve into predatory behavior: acting on the lowest {{intellectual}} level, consuming other animals for nourishment, attack everything around them. Control can be re-asserted over <b>feral</b> zerg by a Broodmother or other command strains however.|$|E
5|$|The largest {{threat to}} the {{ecosystem}} is grazing by <b>feral</b> sheep (Ovis aries), cattle (Bos primigenius), and goats (Capra hircus) introduced to the island in the late 18th century. <b>Feral</b> animal competition with commercial grazing was severe enough that a program to eradicate them existed {{as far back as}} the late 1920s, and continued through to 1949. One of the results of this grazing was the increased prevalence of herbaceous and woody plants, both endemic and introduced, that were resistant to browsing. The <b>feral</b> animals were almost eradicated, and numbered a few hundred in the 1950s. However, an influx of local hunters led to the <b>feral</b> species being valued as game animals, and in 1959 the Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources, the governing body in charge of conservation and land use management, changed its policy to a sustained-control program designed to facilitate the sport.|$|E
5|$|A {{population}} of <b>feral</b> Mandarin ducks {{have been present}} on the river since 1978. Kingfishers and grey herons can also be seen. Otters are common {{near the mouth of}} the river.|$|E

5|$|Empire: Total War is a turn-based {{strategy}} and real-time tactics computer game developed by Creative Assembly {{and published by}} Sega. The fifth installment in the Total War series, the game was released in 2009. The game, which focuses on the early modern period of the 18th century, was announced at the Leipzig Games Convention in August 2007. The Mac OS X version of the game was released by <b>Feral</b> Interactive on 10 June 2014. The Linux version was released, also by <b>Feral</b> Interactive, on 8 December 2014.|$|E

5|$|In 1903, three kakapo {{were moved}} from Resolution Island {{to the nature}} reserve of Little Barrier Island {{north-east}} of Auckland, but <b>feral</b> cats were present and the kakapo were never seen again. In 1912, three kakapo were moved to another reserve, Kapiti Island, north-west of Wellington. One of them survived until at least 1936, {{despite the presence of}} <b>feral</b> cats for part of the intervening period.|$|E
5|$|In {{the mid-1960s}} {{a small group}} of Cuban iguanas was {{released}} from a zoo on Isla Magueyes, southwest of Puerto Rico, forming an independent free-ranging <b>feral</b> population. As of 2000, there has been talk of removing or relocating this population of iguanas by the US Department of Interior. This <b>feral</b> population is the source for 90% of the captive Cuban iguanas held in private collections and was the source for part of a study on animal communication and evolution conducted by Emilia Martins, a biologist at Indiana University.|$|E

5|$|Predators of {{the corn}} crake on its European {{breeding}} grounds include <b>feral</b> and domestic cats, introduced American mink, <b>feral</b> ferrets, otters and red foxes, and birds including the common buzzard and hooded crow. In Lithuania, the introduced raccoon dog has also been recorded taking corn crakes. When chicks are exposed by rapid mowing, they may be taken by large birds including the white stork, harriers and other birds of prey, gulls and corvids. At undisturbed sites, nests and broods are rarely attacked, which {{is reflected in the}} high breeding success.|$|E

5|$|Public {{attitudes towards}} <b>feral</b> cats vary widely, ranging from seeing them as free-ranging pets, to {{regarding}} them as vermin. One common approach to reducing the <b>feral</b> cat population is termed 'trap-neuter-return', where the cats are trapped, neutered, immunized against {{diseases such as}} rabies and the feline Panleukopenia and Leukemia viruses, and then released. Before releasing them back into their <b>feral</b> colonies, the attending veterinarian often nips the tip off one ear to mark it as neutered and inoculated, since these cats may be trapped again. Volunteers continue to feed and give care to these cats throughout their lives. Given this support, their lifespans are increased, and behavior and nuisance problems caused by competition for food are reduced.|$|E
5|$|Sheep {{were among}} the first animals to be domesticated by {{humankind}} (although the domestication of dogs may be over 20,000 years earlier); the domestication date is estimated to fall between 11,000 and 9,000 B.C in Mesopotamia. Their wild relatives have several characteristics, such as a relative lack of aggression, a manageable size, early sexual maturity, a social nature, and high reproduction rates, which made them particularly suitable for domestication. Today, Ovis aries is an entirely domesticated animal that is largely dependent on humans for its health and survival. <b>Feral</b> sheep do exist, but exclusively in areas devoid of large predators (usually islands) and not on the scale of <b>feral</b> horses, goats, pigs, or dogs, although some <b>feral</b> populations have remained isolated long enough to be recognized as distinct breeds.|$|E
5|$|Suggested {{conservation}} {{work for}} the future includes habitat restoration and predator population control. A healthy balance of mature and young forests still exists on {{the southern end of}} Amami, so that area should be protected. Restricting logging would also help to keep more forest available for the rabbits to live in by leaving more forest standing, as well as disturbing the surrounding environment more. An end to the building of forest roads used for logging and travel would further protect the amami rabbit, as they cause population and habitat fragmentation, destroys their prime habitat and allows predators easier access to the middle of forests where a majority of the rabbit population exists. Controlling the populations of mongooses, <b>feral</b> dogs, and <b>feral</b> cats is another approach that could help bolster the rabbit population. Eradication of the mongooses and <b>feral</b> cats and dogs is needed, as well as better control of pets by local island residents.|$|E
5|$|The Banker {{horse is}} a breed of <b>feral</b> horse (Equus ferus caballus) living on barrier islands in North Carolina's Outer Banks. It is small, hardy, {{and has a}} docile temperament. Descended from domesticated Spanish horses and {{possibly}} brought to the Americas in the 16th century, the ancestral foundation bloodstock may have become <b>feral</b> after surviving shipwrecks or being abandoned on the islands {{by one of the}} exploratory expeditions led by Lucas Vázquez de Ayllón or Sir Richard Grenville. Populations are found on Ocracoke Island, Shackleford Banks, Currituck Banks, and in the Rachel Carson Estuarine Sanctuary.|$|E
5|$|The DLC was {{included}} {{as part of}} <b>Feral</b> Interactive's port for OS X, released on April 26, 2012. The Missing Link was subsequently included with other additional content in the director's cut edition of the base game, released on its original platforms and Wii U. The port's developers applied the technical and gameplay enhancements first developed for The Missing Link to Human Revolution. The director's cut was released on October 25, 2013 for PC, Xbox 360, PS3 and Wii U. An OS X port, again handled by <b>Feral</b> Interactive, was released on April 16, 2014.|$|E
5|$|The Sable Island horse, {{sometimes}} referred to as the Sable Island pony, is a type of small <b>feral</b> horse found on Sable Island, an island off the coast of Nova Scotia, Canada. It is a small type, often pony sized, but with a horse phenotype and horse ancestors, and usually dark in color. The first horses were released on the island in the late eighteenth century, and soon became <b>feral.</b> Additional horses were later transported to improve the herd's breeding stock. They were rounded up for private use and sale for slaughter, which by the 1950s had placed them in danger of extinction.|$|E
5|$|The greater Phoenix {{region is}} home to the only {{thriving}} <b>feral</b> population of rosy-faced lovebirds in the U.S. This bird is a popular birdcage pet, native to southwestern Africa. <b>Feral</b> birds were first observed living outdoors in 1987, probably escaped or released pets, and by 2010 the Greater Phoenix population had grown to about 950 birds. These lovebirds prefer older neighborhoods where they nest under untrimmed, dead palm tree fronds.|$|E
5|$|The {{indigenous}} population {{believed that the}} pigeon became extinct due to predation by <b>feral</b> cats and, to a lesser extent, <b>feral</b> dogs. As Choiseul has no indigenous carnivorous mammals, the ground-dwelling pigeon was particularly susceptible to the introduced cats. If the pigeon existed on islands that <b>feral</b> cats had never reached, {{it is believed that}} the clearance of its forest habitat would have led to its local extinction. As there have been no substantiated reports since 1904 despite multiple searches, the IUCN has declared it extinct. As several ornithologists had visited Choiseul and the nearby islands prior to Meek without noting any sign of the bird's existence, {{it is likely that the}} Choiseul pigeon was already close to extinction in 1904.|$|E
5|$|Austin Hobart Clark {{reported}} that juvenile Cuban macaws were green, {{though he did}} not provide any source for this claim. It is unclear whether green birds spotted on the island were in fact juvenile Cuban macaws or if they were instead <b>feral</b> military macaws (Ara militaris).|$|E
5|$|Cats {{have a high}} {{breeding}} rate. Under controlled breeding, {{they can}} be bred and shown as registered pedigree pets, a hobby known as cat fancy. Failure to control the breeding of pet cats by neutering, {{as well as the}} abandonment of former household pets, has resulted in large numbers of <b>feral</b> cats worldwide, requiring population control. In certain areas outside cats' native range, this has contributed, along with habitat destruction and other factors, to the extinction of many bird species. Cats have been known to extirpate a bird species within specific regions and {{may have contributed to the}} extinction of isolated island populations. Cats are thought to be primarily responsible for the extinction of 33 species of birds, and the presence of <b>feral</b> and free-ranging cats makes some otherwise suitable locations unsuitable for attempted species reintroduction.|$|E
5|$|Conway is {{regularly}} invited {{to tell his}} stories at other fan conventions, including I-CON, Eurofurence, ConClave, and Camp <b>Feral!.</b> Gross sales from recordings of his Story Hours were over US$2600 in 2004; no profit was realized, as the intention was to increase membership and awareness of Anthrocon.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{potential}} prey-predator relationship, {{the presence of}} predaceous dingoes {{does not appear to}} heavily influence emu numbers, with other natural conditions just as likely to cause mortality. Wedge-tailed eagles are the only avian predator capable of attacking fully-grown emus, though are perhaps most likely to take small or young specimens. The eagles attack emus by swooping downwards rapidly and at high speed and aiming for the head and neck. In this case, the emu's jumping technique as employed against the dingo is not useful. The birds try to target the emu in open ground so that it cannot hide behind obstacles. Under such circumstances, the emu can only run in a chaotic manner and change directions frequently to try and evade its attacker. Other raptors, monitor lizards, introduced red foxes, <b>feral</b> and domestic dogs, and <b>feral</b> pigs occasionally feed on emu eggs or kill small chicks.|$|E
5|$|Domestic {{horses were}} brought to Canada by humans, but some have since {{established}} <b>feral</b> populations. There are approximately 2,000 wild horses in western Canada and another 300 on Sable Island. See free-roaming horse management in North America.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{scarcity}} of water, the Namib Desert Horse sometimes goes without water {{for as long}} as thirty hours in summer and has been known to go close to 72 hours without water during the winter, significantly longer than most horses, even other <b>feral</b> herds. A 1991 study suggested that in 75 years of genetic isolation and water scarcity the population had developed physiological mechanisms which improved their ability to conserve water. In 1993, a second study showed that the physiological water-conservation ability did not differ between Namib Desert Horses and other populations when dehydrated for periods of up to 60 hours, but suggested that the Namib Desert Horse would show improved conservation ability when dehydration periods were extended to upwards of 72 hours, a common occurrence in their <b>feral</b> state.|$|E
5|$|Extant wild equines have {{scattered}} ranges across Africa and Asia. The plains zebra {{lives in}} lush grasslands and savannas of Eastern and Southern Africa, while the Mountain zebra inhabits mountainous areas of southwest Africa. The other equine species tend to occupy more arid environments with more scattered vegetation. The Grévy's zebra {{is found in}} thorny scrubland of East Africa, while the African wild ass inhabits rocky deserts of North Africa. The two Asian wild ass species live in the dry deserts of the Near East and Central Asia and the Przwelski's wild horse's habitat is the deserts of Mongolia. Only {{the range of the}} plains and Grévy's zebras overlap. In addition to wild populations, domesticated horses and donkeys are widespread thanks to humans. In certain parts of the world, populations of <b>feral</b> horses and <b>feral</b> donkeys exist, which are descended from domesticated animals that were released or escaped into the wild.|$|E
5|$|<b>Feral</b> {{horses are}} {{documented}} as {{living in the}} Pryor Mountains by the early 1700s, although {{they may have been}} there since the late 1600s. By the late 1800s, thousands of <b>feral</b> horses inhabited the area. In the early 1900s, many of the unbranded horses were rounded up, to allow domesticated livestock to graze the range without competition, and by 1964 there were only around 200 horses left. In 1964, the BLM announced that the horses would be removed altogether, to the outrage of the public. The controversy continued until 1968, when the BLM was legally stopped from removing all of the horses, and the area declared a Wild Horse Refuge. After the 1971 signing of the WFRHBA, the BLM spent the 1980s and 1990s conducting population studies and developing management and adoption policies; during this time, numerous genetic studies were also completed.|$|E
5|$|Hog Island sheep are a {{breed of}} sheep descended from animals first brought to Virginia's Hog Island in the 18th century. During the 1930s and 1940s, storm {{conditions}} forced the island's residents to evacuate, leaving some sheep behind. These sheep adapted to the environment free of human intervention, becoming <b>feral.</b>|$|E
5|$|Horses {{have been}} present in the American West since the 1500s, when they arrived with Spanish explorers. Many escaped, were {{released}} by the Spanish or stolen by Native Americans. Their descendents crossed with horses who escaped from or were released by other European settlers, including draft breeds brought by farmers and wagoneers and lighter riding horses brought by the United States Cavalry. Horses of French descent also moved {{across the border from}} Canada to contribute to the herds. The mixture of these breeds created the Mustang present in the western portion of the US today. By the early 1970s, it was assumed that due to crossbreeding, the original Spanish stock had been eliminated from <b>feral</b> herds. In 1971, the Wild and Free-Roaming Horse and Burro Act was passed, giving the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) the authority to manage the <b>feral</b> horse populations in the American West.|$|E
5|$|Mad Max is an action-adventure {{video game}} {{based on the}} Mad Max franchise. Developed by Avalanche Studios and {{published}} by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment, it was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One in September 2015. <b>Feral</b> Interactive published the game's OS X and Linux versions.|$|E
5|$|Phasianidae {{consists}} of the pheasants and their allies. These are terrestrial species, variable in size but generally plump, with broad, relatively short wings. Many species are gamebirds or have been domesticated as a food source for humans. Two species are native to Tasmania, and three commonly domesticated species are <b>feral</b> in King Island.|$|E
5|$|Several {{species of}} storm petrel are {{threatened}} by human activities. One species, the Guadalupe storm petrel, {{is thought to have}} gone extinct. The principal threats to storm petrels are introduced species, particularly mammals, in their breeding colonies; many storm petrels habitually nest on isolated mammal-free islands and are unable to cope with predators like rats and <b>feral</b> cats.|$|E
5|$|Shackleford was foaled on February 25, 2008. He {{was named}} after Shackleford Banks, a barrier island system in North Carolina, home to a herd of <b>feral</b> Banker horses and a place often visited by his owners.|$|E
