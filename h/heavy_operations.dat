Another four auxiliary strips were begun in November: O'Donnell and San Fernando near Clark, San Marcelino northwest of Subic Bay, and Ternate west of Cavite (Ternate and San Fernando were never finished). No strips were planned on Bataan, despite its prominence in strategic war planning. In August and October 1941, the War Department allocated US$9,273,000 (approximately $150 million in 2015 dollars) to construct and improve airfields, most of which was spent constructing a concrete runway at Nichols Field (the only hard-surfaced runway in the Philippines). Additional graded strips were also added or extended to the grass runways at Clark Field, {{with the rest of}} the allocated funds used to build the auxiliary fields. The auxiliary strips were dirt-surfaced and without maintenance, servicing, communications, or control facilities. The dust clouds generated by takeoffs at all strips except Nichols seriously hampered flight operations, with numerous mishaps that destroyed many aircraft, killed pilots, and reduced the assigned strength of already tiny combat missions. The use of expedients to cut down the dust, including a molasses mixture deposited by a tank truck, was unsuccessful.Del Monte Field was operated by FEAF on the island of Mindanao.

50|$|The {{thousand}} foot lift of {{the cable}} railway was not continuous. The initial two and later three sections of the Ashley Planes railroad was capable of operation as a funicular railroad or a cable railroad, for its hoist houses all used a pusher cart called a 'barney' hooked into a continuous cable {{in the same way}} as a modern ski lift uses a continuous cable. Like a ski lift, the railway was operated from a standing engine by an operator in control of a winch, clutch and brake. A helper spotted cars below a short local drop to an area upslope of the 'barney house', where the cable and pusher cart would drop into on one end (heading down) and rise out of on the other to engage the freight cars and push them upwards. The axle on the barney's telescoped so that at the barney house entrance the barney's wheels slide inside and dropped under the plane of the standard width railroad tracks so the barney could slide away and let gravity take the consist onto the marshaling yard. When using furnicular action, as it did sending returns down during its early years the rails split connecting two pairs of tracks bulging out in a vase-like shape in a passing area, so the railway could ship freight downhill east to west as well as the <b>heavy</b> <b>operations</b> west to east which predominated until its closing. In the earliest years of operation, there was no back track to return cars to the bottom for refilling, and they had to be returned on the Planes, thus slowing and complicating the lift operations. When stopping cars from rolling free, the barneys had to be positioned below the cars, and since the upsides are uphills from the barney house opening, that meant a latch (brake system) had to hold a string of empties above the barney before it emerged from hiding its little tunnel. It also means the barney was moving down hill and away from the latched cars which would then accelerate and bang into the small barneys with considerable force, part of which was transmitted via the cables to everything in the system. It was actually easier to lift cars waiting at a latch for a barney than it was to drop cars down safely onto a moving barney.In the 1860s, the LH&S completed tracks along the right bank of the Lehigh through the Lehigh Gorge to Mauch Chunk (now Jim Thorpe, PA) and its trackage to the Delaware Valley, especially the Delaware Canal to Philadelphia markets and rail connections at Easton via the industrial centers of Allentown and Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. These inclined plane railbeds were used for the transportation of anthracite coal. The railroads were in use until 1948.|$|E

One problem of the protection-by-hardware approach is that system calls become very slow because <b>heavy</b> <b>operations</b> are required to safely switch the privilege levels of user programs. To solve the problem, we design an operating system that protects itself with a type theory. In our approach, user programs are written in a typed assembly language and the kernel performs typechecking before executing the programs. Then, the user programs can be executed in the kernel mode, because the kernel knows that the typechecked programs do not violate safety of the kernel. Thus, system calls become mere function calls and can be invoked very quickly. We implemented Kernel Mode Linux (KML) that realizes our approach. Several benchmarks show effectiveness of KML. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Consider the {{situation}} where a low power device with limited computational power has to perform cryptographic operation {{in order to do}} secure communication to the base station where the computational power is not limited. The most obvious way is to split each and every cryptographic operations into resource consuming, <b>heavy</b> <b>operations</b> (which are performed when the device is idle) and the fast light weight operations (which are executed on the fly). This concept is called online/offline cryptography. In this paper, we show the security weakness of an identity based online offline encryption scheme proposed in ACNS 09 by Liu et al. [7]. The scheme in [7] is the first identity based online offline encryption scheme in the random oracle model, in which the message and recipient are not known during the offline phase. We show that this scheme is not CCA secure. We show the weakness in the security proof of CCA secure online/offline encryption system proposed by Chow et al. in [2]. We propose a new provably secure identity based online offline encryption scheme in which the message and receiver are not known during the offline phase. Since all the CCA secure identity based online/offline encryption schemes are shown to have weakness, ours is the first provably secure scheme with the aforementioned properties...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} an FPGA-based {{scheme to}} accelerate mpiBLAST, {{which is a}} parallel sequence alignment algorithm for computational biology. Recent rapidly growing biological databases for sequence alignment require highthroughput storage and network rather than computing speed. Our scheme utilizes a specialized hardware configured on an FPGA-board which connects flash storage and other FPGAboards directly. The specialized hardware configured on the FPGAs, we call a Data Stream Processing Engine (DSPE), take a role for preprocessing to adjust data for high-performance multi- and many- core processors simultaneously with offloading system-calls for storage access and networking. DSPE along the datapath achieves in-datapath computing which applies operations for data streams passing through the FPGA. Two functions in mpiBLAST are implemented using DSPE to offload operations along the datapath. The first function is database partitioning, which distributes the biological database to multiple computing nodes before commencing the BLAST processes. Using DSPE, we observe a 20 -fold improvement in computation time for the database partitioning operation. The second function is an {{early part of the}} BLAST process that determines the positions of sequences for more detailed computations. We implement IDP-BLAST (In-datapath BLAST), which annotates positions in data streams from solid-state drives. We show that IDP-BLAST accelerates the computation time of the preprocess of BLAST by a factor of three hundred by offloading <b>heavy</b> <b>operations</b> to the introduced special hardware...|$|E

S. military, successful treatment options {{need to be considered}} and used as quickly as possible. Plantar fasciitis can be successfully treated in up to 90 % of patients using conservative measures. Operative intervention might need to be considered for those in whom conservative measures have failed. The present report is a review of 105 consecutive uniport endoscopic plantar fascial release procedures performed by the principal investigator during a 9 -year period. The following data were collected and analyzed: gender, age, weight, height, body mass index, medical treatment facility, procedure laterality, preoperative pain levels, postoperative pain levels at 3 months, first ambulatory day in the controlled ankle motion boot, return to activity as tolerated, and complications. Three major points were of interest: evidence of improvement in chronic plantar fasciitis when treated with uniport endoscopic procedures; the patient attributes associated with self-reported pain levels 90 days postoperatively; and the patient attributes associated with the average time until patients were able to return to activities as tolerated in a controlled ankle motion boot. It was noted that 44. 5 % of those with a body mass index of 29. 80 kg/m 2 or greater reported a postoperative pain level of 0; and 96. 3 % of those with a body mass index of 25. 53 kg/m 2 or less reported postoperative pain levels of 0.

40|$|The {{demand for}} {{aviation}} {{has been steadily}} growing {{over the past few}} decades and will keep increasing in the future. The anticipated growth of traffic demand will cause the current airspace system, one that is already burdened by <b>heavy</b> <b>operations</b> and inefficient usage, to become even more congested than its current state. Because busy airports in the United States (U. S.) are becoming 2 ̆ 2 bottlenecks 2 ̆ 2 of the National Airspace System (NAS), it is of great importance to discover the most efficient means of using existing facilities to improve airport operations. This dissertation aims at designing an efficient airport surface operations management system that substantially contributes to the modernized NAS. First, a global comparison is conducted in the major airports within the U. S. and Europe in order to understand, compare, and explore the differences of surface operational efficiency in two systems. The comparison results are then presented for each airport pair with respect to various operational performance metrics, as well as airport capacity and different demand patterns. A detailed summary of the associated Air Traffic Management (ATM) strategies that are implemented in the U. S. and Europe can be found towards the end of this work. These strategies include: a single Air Navigation Service Provider (ANSP) in the U. S. and multiple ANSPs in Europe, airline scheduling and demand management differences, mixed usage of Instrument Flight Rule (IFR) and Visual Flight Rules (VFR) operations in the U. S., and varying gate management policies in two regions. For global comparison, unimpeded taxi time is the reference time used for measuring taxi performance. It has been noted that different methodologies are currently used to benchmark taxi times by the performance analysis groups in the U. S. and Europe, namely the Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) and EUROCONTROL. The consistent methodology to measure taxi efficiency is needed for the facilitation of global benchmarking. Therefore, after an in-depth factual comparison conducted for two varying methodologies, new methods to measure unimpeded taxi times are explored through various tools, including simulation software and projection of historical surveillance data. Moreover, a sophisticated statistical model is proposed as a state-of-the-art method to measure taxi efficiency while quantifying the impact of various factors to taxi inefficiency and supporting decision-makers with reliable measurements to improve the operational performance. Lastly, a real-time integrated airport surface operations management (RTI-ASOM) is presented to fulfil the third objective of this dissertation. It provides optimal trajectories for each aircraft between gates and runways with the objective of minimizing taxi delay and maximizing runway throughput. The use of Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MIP) formulation, Dynamic Programming for decomposition, and CPLEX optimization can permit the use of an efficient solution algorithm that can instantly solve the large-scale optimization problem. Examples are shown based on one-day track data at LaGuardia Airport (LGA) in New York City. In additional to base scenarios with historical data, simulation through MATLAB is constructed to provide further comparable scenarios, which can demonstrate a significant reduction of taxi times and improvement of runway utilization in RTI-ASOM. By strategically holding departures at gates, the application of RTI-ASOM also reduces excess delay on the airport surface, decreases fuel consumption at airports, and mitigates the consequential environmental impacts...|$|E
