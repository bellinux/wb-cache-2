5|$|The footage shows Jamal and Muhammad {{crouching}} {{behind the}} cylinder, the child screaming {{and the father}} shielding him. Jamal appears to shout something <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cameraman, then waves and shouts <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Israeli outpost. There is a burst of gunfire and the camera goes out of focus. When the gunfire subsides, Jamal is sitting upright and injured and Muhammad is lying over his legs. Enderlin cut a final few seconds from the footage that shows Muhammad lift his hand from his face. This cut became the basis {{of much of the}} controversy over the film.|$|E

Starting on 3 September, the IV Squadron, assisted by the armored cruiser , conducted a sweep into the eastern Baltic <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Svenska Högarna islands.

5|$|Another torque is {{produced}} by the finite width of the contact patch and the lean of the tire in a turn. The portion of the contact patch towards {{the outside of the}} turn is actually moving rearward, with respect to the wheel's hub, faster {{than the rest of the}} contact patch, because of its greater radius from the hub. By the same reasoning, the inner portion is moving rearward more slowly. So the outer and inner portions of the contact patch slip on the pavement in opposite directions, generating a torque that tends to turn the front wheel <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> turn, and therefore tends to decrease the turn radius.|$|E

5|$|Braidwood {{regarded}} Westminster Hall as {{safe from}} destruction by 1:45am, {{partly because of}} the actions of the floating fire engine, but also because a change <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wind kept the flames away from the Hall. Once the crowd realised that the hall was safe they began to disperse, and had left by around 3:00am, by which time the fire near the Hall was nearly out, although it continued to burn towards the south of the complex. The firemen remained in place until about 5:00am, when they had extinguished the last remaining flames and the police and soldiers had been replaced by new shifts.|$|E

5|$|Coprinopsis variegata can attack soil bacteria, such as {{species of}} Pseudomonas and Agrobacterium, {{and use them}} as {{nutrient}} sources. The fungus achieves this by growing specialized hyphae <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bacteria, sensing them with some chemoattractive mechanism not yet fully understood. The fungus then secretes compounds to digest the bacteria while growing assimilative hyphae to absorb the nutrients. The process is relatively rapid, and bacterial colonies can be assimilated in less than 24 hours.|$|E
