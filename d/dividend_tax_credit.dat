40|$|The French {{income tax}} {{structure}} {{is based on}} the concept of an integrated tax system. The system utilizes a <b>tax</b> <b>credit</b> at the shareholder level to eliminate or mitigate the double taxation that would otherwise apply to a <b>dividend.</b> The <b>tax</b> <b>credit</b> is automatically available to a French shareholder receiving a dividend from a French corporation. The "precompte mobilier " (or precompte) is a mechanism that provides for the integration of the <b>tax</b> <b>credit</b> to the shareholder with the taxes paid by the corporation.

In addition, if a corporation pays a dividend from earnings that have been retained for more than five years, the corporation loses the benefit of any taxes previously paid in the computation of the precompte.

40|$|This thesis {{develops}} {{and tests}} {{a number of}} hypotheses examining the relationship between ?shareholder dividend taxation? and market value of a sample of UK firms? equity. Specifically, this thesis tests for evidence of ?shareholder dividend taxation? impounded into share prices. This issue has many corporate financial implications. Understanding what affects corporate distributions {{is central to the}} understanding of the firm as there are potential implications regarding the allocation of resources and investment decisions. If share prices incorporate dividend taxation, this affects firms? cost of equity capital. An ongoing ?shareholder <b>dividend</b> <b>tax?</b> capitalisation debate in the US has produced conflicting results as to existence or degree of capitalisation. This lack of consensus in the US raises the issue of the position with respect to UK companies, particularly with the clear differences between the two countries tax systems. The common element linking the majority of the US models is that they are derived from the Ohlson (1995) valuation model. Ohlson (1995) demonstrates that given certain restrictive assumptions equity value can be modelled by the book value of equity (BV) and the level of net earnings (NI). The model predicts that BV and NI are positively related to equity value; however issues of ?shareholder <b>dividend</b> <b>tax?</b> capitalisation may affect the relative importance of the relationship between equity value and the components of BV (ISC and RE). To relax some of the restrictive assumptions of the Ohlson (1995) model, the valuation models used in this thesis include a number of control factors. In addition, the sensitivity of the results has been assessed by using a range of deflators to control for scale factors and models were estimated over RE/BV quintiles and dividend payout ratio based quintiles. The sample comprises all non-financials from the Financial Times All Share Index for the period 1994 - 2000. This period was chosen to include the Finance Act (1997) abolition of repayment of <b>dividend</b> <b>tax</b> <b>credits</b> to <b>tax</b> exempt shareholders. Imposing a survivorship requirement is designed to overcome criticisms of prior research. Similarly, estimating over a balanced sample maintained a constant industry composition, which in turn controls for earnings persistence. The results are mixed; there is some evidence in support of ?shareholder <b>dividend</b> <b>tax?</b> capitalisation in UK equities but this is sensitive to the year examined, the specific model used and the hypothesis tested. Two sub-hypotheses were developed to test the main hypothesis of this study; one provides considerable evidence in support of ?shareholder <b>dividend</b> <b>tax?</b> capitalisation, the second very little. The supporting evidence relates to the hypothesised relative changes in the RE coefficients pre and post 1997, but little support is evident for the absolute magnitude hypothesised i. e. comparison of the RE and ISC coefficients pre and post 1997.

40|$|Australian {{residents}} are tax-advantaged, relative to American investors, in {{their access to}} imputation <b>tax</b> <b>credits</b> on Australian stocks. This paper provides evidence consistent with a difference in dividend valuations between Australian stocks and their American Depositary Receipts (ADRs). The ex-dividend drop-off ratio is lower for ADRs relative to their underlying Australian stocks and this difference is most pronounced for stocks that have imputation <b>tax</b> <b>credits</b> and high <b>dividend</b> yields. Consistent with dividend capture trading in the Australian market, the difference in drop-off ratios is driven by both temporarily higher Australian cum-prices and temporarily lower Australian ex-prices. Abnormal trading volume about the ex-day is present in both markets and in the Australian market the abnormal volume is greater for <b>dividends</b> with imputation <b>tax</b> <b>credits.</b> Dividend-related trading leads to price differences across the markets on the ex-dividend day.
