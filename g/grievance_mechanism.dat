40|$|This major {{research}} paper explores operational-level <b>grievance</b> <b>mechanisms</b> established by mining multinational corporations (MNCs) to complement {{and act as}} an alternative to judicial and non-judicial resolution processes currently addressing human rights issues. This type of mechanism has great potential to better address human rights complaints and ultimately mitigate the varied negative impacts mining MNCs have on local communities. To position the discussion in its broader context, the international legal framework from the perspective of international human rights law is presented. Subsequently, the Canadian framework is discussed as an example of national provisions affecting MNCs extraterritorially. This example demonstrates how the current national laws, court decisions, as well as non-judicial mechanisms fail to ensure that victims of human rights abuses committed by Canadian MNCs abroad receive proper adjudication and redress in Canada. Consequently, the background and definition of such <b>grievance</b> <b>mechanisms</b> is presented as well as three sets of criteria used to assess their effectiveness. In order to examine the question of site-level <b>grievance</b> <b>mechanisms</b> critically, two case studies of corporate <b>grievance</b> <b>mechanisms</b> established by mining MNCs are discussed and analysed...|$|R

Conflict and its management within them is an essential element of this concern. It is widely reported in the literature that existing legal remedies are an inadequate way of responding to many of these disputes. Thus, we aim to provide what we believe are improved internal guidelines and resolution procedures coupled with negotiation decision support for condominium disputants to help guide them through the grievance process...|$|E

40|$|The {{right to}} an {{effective}} remedy for victims {{of human rights abuses}} perpetrated by companies remains weak in international law. A host of substantive and procedural legal issues prevent victims from seeking redress in national and international courts. This problem is particularly acute where victims seek redress for abuses perpetrated by private military and security companies. The nature of these companies’ activities and their regular deployment overseas make it difficult to hold them accountable for human rights abuses. This article examines whether non-judicial mechanisms can provide effective remedies against these private military and security companies for their human rights abuses where judicial remedies have failed. The article establishes the parameters of an effective remedy under international human rights law and proceeds to assess whether two specific examples of non-judicial remedies, the International Code of Conduct Association for Private Security Providers’ <b>grievance</b> <b>mechanism</b> and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s National Contact Point system, offer human rights-compliant remedies.

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in conflict studies {{have led to}} relatively robust conclusions that inequality fuels conflict when it overlaps with salient group identities. Central to quantitative studies supporting this relationship is a stipulated causal chain where objective group – or horizontal – inequalities are translated into grievances, which in turn form a mobilization resource. All these studies are however limited by their use of objective measures of inequality, which leaves them unable to directly test the assumed <b>grievance</b> <b>mechanism.</b> In four papers I argue that objective asymmetries are not enough to trigger conflict. For people to take action on horizontal inequalities, {{they will have to}} be aware of them and consider them unjust. In the first paper, Perceptions, Horizontal Inequalities and Civil Conflict, I use data from the World Values Survey to show that perceived rather than objective economic inequality between sub-national regional groups is associated with increased risk of civil war. In the second paper, Injustice {{is in the eye of}} the beholder: Perceived Horizontal Inequalities and Communal Conflict in Africa, I analyse 20 countries covered by the Afrobarometer Surveys. I conclude that combined objective and perceived economic ethnic inequality, political ethnic inequality, and particularly perceived political ethnic inequality, increase the risk of between-group conflict. In the third paper, Expectations, Grievances and Civil Unrest in Emerging Petrostates. Empirical Evidence from Tanzania, I present evidence suggesting that those who feel that their region has been treated unfairly by the government are most prone to support and participate in civil unrest. I base my conclusions primarily on survey data collected in 2015. In a final article, From Silence to Storm. Investigating Mechanisms Linking Structural Inequality and Natural Resources to Mobilization in Southern Tanzania, I rely on 35 semi-structured interviews to argue that natural gas mismanagement triggered group grievances, which in turn fuelled civil unrest...|$|E

40|$|Having {{organized}} {{as a local}} of the Mine Workers' Union of Canada (MWUC) {{only a few days}} previously, the miners ot the Souris coalfield walked off the job on September 8, 1931 to reinforce their demands for increased wages and improved working conditions. The seasonal and fluctuating nature of the Saskatchewan industry, the reduction in reali­zation by operators from the sale of lignite, wage reductions in late 1930 and early 1931, and certain unsatisfactory work­ing and living conditions may be identified as underlying causes of the dispute. Three factors ultimately precipitated the wildcat strike: the absence of any established <b>grievance</b> <b>mechanism,</b> the coal operators' refusal to recognize the MWUC, and the refusal of James Sloan, MWUC president, to accede to demands {{for the establishment of a}} conciliation board under The Industrial Disputes Investigation Act. On September 29 some 300 to 400 striking miners and their families clashed with police on the streets of Estevan, Saskatchewan in a bloody riot resulting in three deaths, a number of injuries, and the conviction of several participants on charges arising out of the confrontation. The tragic events of "Black Tuesday" helped bring about a settlement, but not an altogether desirable one. The authorities, it would seem, beginning in early October, launched a campaign aimed at placing the bulk of responsibility for affairs on "outside agitators," at depriving the miners of the support and assistance of anyone from outside the district, at undermining unity among the miners, and at bringing the parties together under their scarcely impartial auspicies. The result was a settlement which, while granting some con­cessions to the miners, was violated in varying degrees at once by the operators. Not surprisingly, before a royal commission set up to examine the causes of the strike had completed its report, there was talk among miners of further strike action. It is also not altogether surprising that there was no official inquiry into the riot itself...|$|E
40|$|Voluntary Sustainability Standards (VSS) {{might develop}} into a viable {{alternative}} to public regulation. However, it turns on the (regulatory) circumstances whether that holds true in practice. If public regulation on CSR topics is lacking, governments are unable to agree upon certain topics on a global level or diverging public regulation exists, VSS can be helpful to set global standards. Obviously, private standards will especially be helpful if they are commensurate with local public legislation (and e. g. treaties) and/or are accepted by local governments. If one neglects this, numerous domestic structures might exist that frustrate VSS. Furthermore, governments have to remain vigilant as to whether these private regimes do not result in market disruption, consumer detriment or hamper trade. VSS might also compete with public arrangements which might limit the uptake of VSS. However, if public regulation exists VSS might be a viable alternative if compliance with not too compelling public norms by market participants is rather poor and the public policymaker is aiming to incentivize the better performing part of the market to embark on higher standards and thus only desires to regulate the less performing part of the market. However, of paramount importance is the effectiveness of VSS in order to be {{a viable alternative to}} public regulation. The effectiveness of VSS should be assessed using an integrated multi-disciplinary (comparative) approach entailing legal, impact-assessment, legitimacy, governance and behavioural aspects. Only effective VSS in the aforementioned sense are a true alternative to public regulation. Beyond that, the legal perspective in connection with (the effectiveness of) VSS is discussed, featuring FSC and UTZ Certified as an example. It is important from this perspective that VSS have a clear and sufficiently selective objective and sufficiently specific norms, are regularly evaluated, entail ‘conflict of law rules’ and an effective <b>grievance</b> <b>mechanism,</b> provide sufficient means for monitoring and enforcement and contribute to a more balanced risk attribution between producers and (ultimate) buyers...|$|E
40|$|There is {{increasing}} certainty about the global reality {{of climate change}} and its negative effects on society. In Africa, owing to {{a way of life}} that is culturally and collectively dependent on land and its natural resources, actual and projected evidence shows that indigenous peoples are affected than other populations by the adverse impact of climate change. Indigenous peoples will also be adversely affected by the impact of climate change response measures, particularly adaptation process in accessing funds and the REDD+ mitigation initiatives on their land. Consequently, this thesis examines the extent of protection accorded to indigenous peoples‟ land tenure and use against the backdrop of relevant global, national and regional climate change regulatory frameworks. Using Zambia, Tanzania and Nigeria as case studies, the thesis finds that there is a trend towards inadequate protection of indigenous peoples‟ land tenure and use in the domestic climate change regulatory framework for addressing the adverse effects of climate change and response measures in Africa. The inadequate protection of land use and tenure has negative implications for indigenous peoples‟ participation, carbon rights (a new form of property rights in the forests) and benefit-sharing, as well their access to <b>grievance</b> <b>mechanism</b> and remedies. In response to the inadequacy, the thesis demonstrates that it is incompatible with the obligations of states and a breach of crucial rights guaranteed to indigenous peoples under regional human rights instruments. The thesis then highlights the potential in the regional climate change regulatory framework and particularly, the promotional, protective, interpretive and assembly entrusted functions of the African Commission on Human and Peoples‟ Rights (the Commission) as specific channels by which the regional application of human rights can protect the land rights of indigenous peoples in the context of climate change in Africa. Notwithstanding these potentials, reforms are necessary at the international, national and regional levels for effective protection of indigenous peoples‟ land rights in the context of climate change impact in Africa. These reforms include the reconceptualization of principles of „sovereignty‟, „country-driven‟ and „national legislation‟ at the international level, and at the national level, the creation of a new stand-alone regulatory framework or harmonisation of national legislation relating to climate change to respect indigenous peoples‟ land rights. At the regional level, there is need for an improved interaction between climate change related institutions and initiatives with human rights mechanisms and an official regional policy statement on the protection of indigenous peoples‟ land rights in the light of climate change impact in Africa.

Currently, {{little is known about the}} functioning of these <b>grievance</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> This dissertation presents an empirical study of an academic ombud. Using normative pragmatics and a social context approach to disputing as an analytic framework, 50 disputants who pursued grievances through an academic ombud were interviewed at various stages of the disputing process. This study offers a processual account of disputants' experiences with the dispute process by combining interview data with multi-perspectival analyses (member checks, artifacts) and triangulation with quantitative survey data. Additionally, design features of the ombud office are examined for their ability to achieve the goals of the office given the context of the dispute. The study concludes that the flexibility of the ombud is a strength for dealing with the varied grievances brought to the office. Disputants are generally satisfied with the process, and have a restored sense of faith in the organization having gone through the ombud. The social context of academics, however, prevents the ombud process from reconciling relationships between disputants. The study further concludes that any design of disputing systems must take into account the social context of tile disputing arena. The framework generated by combining tile study of design features with social context provides researchers and practitioners a more productive way of analyzing and designing disputing systems...|$|R
40|$|Papua New Guinea (PNG) {{stands at}} a {{critical}} moment in its development. With Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth of over 20 per cent expected for 2015, following the start of production from the massive PNG Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) project, the country has {{a unique opportunity to}} leverage significant sustainable and equitable improvements in levels of health, education, income and other elements of inclusive human development. At the same time, the country also faces considerable risks. If poor choices are made, the impact of the high growth rates will be limited, even detrimental to the development prospects of Papua New Guineans and the nation and the lives of people living in poverty. This report aims to provide information and national as well as international case study experiences to assist decision-making in the country. The report has four purposes: (1) Review the extent to which Papua New Guinea’s revenues from extractive industries have led to practical human development outcomes; (2) Reveal lessons from other countries that can be useful for Papua New Guinea; (3) Highlight some specific innovations from Papua New Guinea’s experience that can contribute to development in other countries; and (4) Stimulate, inform and shift the debate in the country to enable leaders to make appropriate choices for the wellbeing of citizens. Papua New Guinea’s 40 year history of Independence has been dominated by the extractives sector. Large-scale mine and oil production (worth at least K 150 billion since Independence) has driven formal sector growth, underpinned budgets that have improved health and education outcomes, as well as provided significant improvements in incomes and livelihoods for some. At the same time however, this production has sparked civil strife, caused massive environmental damage, arguably distorted the economy, and brought about a range of negative impacts on communities. Valuable lessons are being learnt (and have potential international relevance), but still the risk remains that the existing model of economic growth in the country will not deliver sustained improvements in wellbeing {{for the majority of the}} population. The report reviews the state of human development in Papua New Guinea in terms of the three pillars of sustainable development – economic, social and environmental – and specifically examines the ways in which the extractive industries have contributed – positively and negatively – to these related but distinct pillars. While there have been some measurable achievements in terms of improvements in human development (increases in life expectancy, per capita income and educational achievement), many of the indicators are less positive. Despite 14 consecutive years of economic growth, there has been little change in poverty levels in the country. In fact the level of inequality in the country has increased. There is much that is positive about the contribution of the extractives sector to Papua New Guinea’s development, including significant revenue flows to government, cutting edge innovations to enhance revenue and transparency at the national level, as well as the involvement of some communities in some operational decision-making. There remains however, considerable scope for improvement. Other positive impacts include recent initiatives addressing service delivery, governance, and policy direction that provide useful guides to future action. The report reviews the significant amount of national and international experience and recent policy development throughout the extractives sector, much of which has been driven by the realization that mineral and oil wealth has not always been a positive force for a country’s national development. The term ‘resource curse’ captures the international view that growth based on a dominant extractives sector can, if not managed well, lead to a range of negative effects, including stunted economic growth, corruption, weak institutions, conflict, human rights abuses, and poor human development outcomes. There is also, however, experience that suggests the ‘resource curse’ is not inevitable: that there are particular political, institutional and economic mechanisms that can be used to better connect resource wealth with sustainable human development. Papua New Guinea is on the frontline of innovation in some of these areas, and valuable lessons can inform international best practice and decision-making. Based on a review of the state of human development and the experience of the extractives sector in Papua New Guinea, along with case studies and lessons from the national and international experience, the report presents a range of policy options – framed around a United Nations Development Program’s Strategy on Extractive Industries and Human Development. This aims to assist in better translating minerals and oil revenues into more sustainable and inclusive forms of human development. For this to happen, countries should seek to capture as much of the resource revenue as possible through transparent and accountable systems - without losing the foreign investment - and use this to boost human development through effective service delivery to the largely rural-based population, while working to reduce the negative social, economic and environmental impacts. Policy options to do this include ways of making policy frameworks and operation-specific negotiations more effective and more inclusive, refinements in institutional governance and service delivery, improvements to transparency and management of revenue flows (though mechanisms such as the Sovereign Wealth Fund and the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative), the establishment of a formal sector-specific <b>grievance</b> <b>mechanism,</b> a focus on building economic diversification into non-extractive sectors (especially agriculture and tourism), novel environmental management approaches, better integration of corporate community development contributions, and improvements in data collection and management processes. Taken singularly, or preferably as a whole, these options provide the basis for enhancing the contribution of the sector to sustainable human development. They are offered as a basis for public and policy dialogue and debate, which should then form the basis for action. The report recognises that it is only the timely actions of stakeholders in the country – governments, leaders, politicians, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), development partners, citizens and the private sector – that will make a practical and real difference to human development outcomes in Papua New Guinea. Papua New Guinea has a unique window of opportunity to make some of these decisions now. The country needs to grasp this opportunity. falsePublishedPort MoresbyUnited Nations Development Programm...|$|E
40|$|Die Berichterstattung über die Nachhaltigkeitsleistung von Organisationen gewinnt zunehmend an Bedeutung und wird seitens unterschiedlicher Stakeholdergruppen immer deutlicher gefordert. Zur Erstellung des Nachhaltigkeitsberichts ziehen bereits 90 Prozent der weltweit größten Unternehmen den Berichtsrahmen der Global Reporting Initiative heran. Im Mai 2013 wurde die bereits vierte Version dieses Berichtsrahmens („G 4 Sustainability Reporting Guidelines“) veröffentlicht. In der vorliegenden Arbeit werden der alte Berichtsrahmen (G 3. 1) und der neu eingeführte Berichtsrahmen (G 4) der GRI gegenübergestellt und die damit verbundenen Veränderungen in der Nachhaltigkeitsberichterstattung erläutert. Als Basis für diese Gegenüberstellung wurden die englischsprachigen Versionen der beiden Berichtsrahmen herangezogen. Einführend werden die Grundlagen der Nachhaltigkeitsberichterstattung erläutert. Im Hauptteil der Arbeit werden die beiden Berichtsrahmen detailliert betrachtet und deren Unterschiede ausführlich beschrieben. In Kapitel sieben erfolgt eine zusammenfassende Darstellung der Unterschiede zwischen der Version G 3. 1 und der Version G 4 im Überblick. Bereits an der Zielsetzung des Berichtsrahmens ist eine Neuorientierung der GRI zu erkennen. In der alten Version wurden die Implementierung des GRI-Berichtsrahmens als {{international}} anerkanntes Rahmenwerk zur Erstellung von Nachhaltigkeitsberichten einerseits, und die Förderung der Transparenz der Berichte andererseits als die wesentliche Ziele definiert. Mit der Überarbeitung des Berichtsrahmens bzw. der Einführung des neuen Berichtsrahmens soll vordergründig eine Anpassung an die neuen internationalen Rahmenbedingungen erfolgen. Zusätzlich sollen auch die Vergleichbarkeit und die Glaubwürdigkeit der Nachhaltigkeitsberichte erhöht werden. Trotz des stärkeren Fokus auf Wesentlichkeit, wurden die Prinzipien der Nachhaltigkeitsberichterstattung ohne bedeutende Veränderungen in den neuen Berichtsrahmen übernommen. Unterschiede konnten im Hinblick auf die Festlegung der Berichtsgrenzen festgestellt werden. Entsprechend der neuen Version ist für jeden Aspekt einzeln festzulegen, inwieweit dieser relevant für andere in Verbindung mit der berichterstattenden Organisation stehenden Unternehmen ist. Neben der inhaltlichen Überarbeitung nahezu aller Standardangaben sind auch Neuerungen in Bezug auf die Klassifizierung dieser vorgenommen worden. Im Gegensatz zum alten Berichtsrahmen wird in der Version G 4 zwischen sogenannten Allgemeinen Standardangaben und Spezifischen Standardangaben (Angaben zum Managementansatz und Leistungsindikatoren) unterschieden. Da eine Differenzierung zwischen Kern- und Zusatzindikatoren im neuen Berichtrahmen nicht mehr vorgenommen wird, sind folglich alle Leistungsindikatoren als gleichbedeutend anzusehen. Zusätzlich zu den im alten Berichtsrahmen beschriebenen Standardangaben werden in der neuen Version auch Angaben zu Ethik und Integrität sowie detailliertere Informationen zu unternehmensinternen Beschwerdemechanismen und zur gesamten Lieferkette gefordert. Im Vergleich zum alten Berichtsrahmen beinhaltet die Version G 4 detailliertere Informationen zur Vorgehensweise bei der Erstellung des Nachhaltigkeitsberichts sowie hinsichtlich der Verwendung des Berichtsrahmens. Insgesamt stellt die neue Version G 4 einen anwenderfreundlicheren Berichtsrahmen dar, der einen kompakteren Überblick über die Anforderungen an einen Nachhaltigkeitsbericht bietet. on sustainability is {{a growing}} international trend.

In addition to a synoptical comparison of the differences between the old and the new version, in chapter seven the author summarizes the most significant changes for reporting organizations resulting from the implementation of G 4. In the old version the GRI defined two major goals: the implementation of G 3. 1 as an inter-national accepted sustainability reporting framework and the enhancement of transparency. With the revision of the framework, the GRI tries to obtain an adaption to the new international overall conditions as well as to increase comparability and credibility of sustainability reports. In the new version, organizations are required increasingly to report only about material aspects. Despite the greater emphasis of materiality as the most important reporting principle for preparing a sustainability report, the information concerning the reporting principles have not been revised. According to the old framework, the organization has to define which other companies or organizations have to be included into the report. The GRI offers a decision tree to separate organizations with significant influence or control from those without any influence. Following the new version, the organization has to identify these so called report boundaries for every aspect separately. The comparison between the new and the old version additionally shows strong distinctions in terms of the classification of Standard Disclosures. In contrast to G 3. 1, in G 4 the GRI differentiates General Standard Disclosures from Specific Standard Disclosures (Disclosures on Management Approach und Indicators). In the new version of the framework the GRI does not differentiate between core indicators and additional indicators any longer. Therefore organizations are obliged to treat all indicators as equal important. In addition to the revision of most Standard Disclosures, for instance Disclosures for Governance, the GRI implemented new Disclosures for Ethic and Integrity and requires Information about the organization’s <b>Grievance</b> <b>Mechanism</b> and Supplier Assessment. Besides to the new format (two books instead of many books), the version G 4 offers a more detailed description and information in terms of the use of the reporting framework and the preparation of sustainability reports. As a result of these revisions, the new framework is more user-friendly, provides a better overview and presents the information in a more compact manner. ...|$|E

This article focuses upon one element of this wider discourse, namely the increased adoption within the international community of complaint and <b>grievance</b> <b>mechanisms</b> that operate outside the traditional legal framework...|$|R
