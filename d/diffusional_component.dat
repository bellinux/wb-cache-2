40|$|A {{new method}} of extracting {{information}} about bacterial speeds from photon correlation spectroscopy is presented. This method has the advantage that an estimation of the translational speed distribution is directly varied so as to achieve a best least-squares fit to the experimental autocorrelation function. The theory of spline approximations to continuous functions is briefly outlined. The importance of the previously disregarded <b>diffusional</b> <b>component</b> of bacterial motion is discussed.

40|$|Fluorescence {{correlation}} spectroscopy {{is used to}} monitor the self-association of SDS and DTAB monomers at single-molecule resolution. Tetramethylrhodamine- 5 -maleimide (TMR) has been chosen as a probe because rhodamine dyes {{have been shown to}} bind surfactant micelles. Correlation functions obtained by FCS experiments have been fit using conventional discrete <b>diffusional</b> <b>component</b> analysis as well as the more recent maximum entropy method (MEM). Hydrodynamic radii calculated from the diffusion time values increase with surfactant concentration as the monomers self-associate. Effects of several solution additives on the self-association property of the surfactants have been studied. Urea and glycerol inhibit self-association, and arginine shows a dual nature. With SDS, arginine favors self-association, and with DTAB, it inhibits micelle formation. We propose surfactant self-association to be a “supersimplified” model of protein aggregation...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn several organisms solute {{transport}} is {{mediated by the}} simultaneous operation of saturable and non-saturable (diffusion-like) uptake, but often {{the nature of the}} diffusive component remains elusive. The present work investigates the nature of the diffusive glucose transport in Olea europaea cell cultures. In this system, glucose uptake is mediated by a glucose-repressible, H+-dependent active saturable transport system that is superimposed on a <b>diffusional</b> <b>component.</b> The latter represents the major mode of uptake when high external glucose concentrations are provided. In glucose-sufficient cells, initial velocities of d- and l-[U- 14 C]glucose uptake were equal and obeyed linear concentration dependence up to 100  mM sugar. In sugar starved cells, where glucose transport is mediated by the saturable system, countertransport of the sugar pairs 3 -O-methyl-d-glucose/d-[U- 14 C]glucose and 3 -O-methyl-d-glucose/ 3 -O-methyl-d-[U- 14 C]glucose was demonstrated. This countertransport was completely absent in glucose-sufficient cells, indicating that linear glucose uptake is not mediated by a typical sugar permease. The endocytic inhibitors wortmannin-A and NH 4 Cl inhibited neither the linear component of d- and l-glucose uptake nor the absorption of the nonmetabolizable glucose analog 3 -O-methyl-d-[U- 14 C]glucose, thus excluding the involvement of endocytic mediated glucose uptake. Furthermore, the formation of endocytic vesicles assessed with the marker FM 1 – 43 proceeded at a very slow rate. Activation energies for glucose transport in glucose sufficient cells and plasma membrane vesicles were 7 and 4  kcal mol− 1, respectively, lower than the value estimated for diffusion of glucose through the lipid bilayer of phosphatidylethanolamine liposomes (12  kcal mol− 1). Mercury chloride inhibited both the linear component of sugar uptake in sugar sufficient cells and plasma membrane vesicles, and the incorporation of the fluorescent glucose analog 2 -NBDG, suggesting protein-mediated transport. Diffusive uptake of glucose was inhibited by a drop in cytosolic pH and stimulated by the protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine. The data demonstrate that the low-affinity, high-capacity, <b>diffusional</b> <b>component</b> of glucose uptake occurs through a channel-like structure whose transport capacity may be regulated by intracellular protonation and phosphorylation/dephosphorylation...|$|E

40|$|Cytoplasmic dynein, the 1. 2 MDa motor driving minus-end-directed motility, {{has been}} {{reported}} to move processively along microtubules, but its mechanism of motility remains poorly understood. Here, using S. cerevisiae to produce recombinant dynein with a chemically controlled dimerization switch, we show by structural and single-molecule analysis that processivity requires two dynein motor domains but not dynein’s tail domain or any associated subunits. Dynein advances most frequently in 8 nm steps, although longer as well as side and backward steps are observed. Individual motor domains show a different stepping pattern, which is best explained by the two motor domains shuffling in an alternating manner between rear and forward positions. Our results suggest that cytoplasmic dynein moves processively through the coordination of its two motor domains, but its variable step size and direction suggest a considerable <b>diffusional</b> <b>component</b> to its step, which differs from Kinesin- 1 and is more akin to myosin VI...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The present {{experiments}} {{were designed to}} evaluate coupling of water and nonelectrolyte flows in porous lipid bilayer membranes (i. e., {{in the presence of}} amphotericin B) in series with unstirred layers. Alterations in solute flux during osmosis, with respect to the flux in the absence of net water flow, could be related to two factors: first, changes in the <b>diffusional</b> <b>component</b> of solute flux referable to variations in solute concentrations at the membrane interfaces produced by osmotic flow through the unstirred layers; and second, coupling of solute and solvent flows within the membrane phase. Osmotic water flow {{in the same direction as}} solute flow increased substantially the net fluxes of glycerol and erythritol through the membranes, while osmotic flow in the opposite direction to glycerol flow reduced the net flux of that solute. The observed effects of osmotic water flow on the fluxes of these solutes were in reasonable agreement with predictions based on a model for coupling of solute and solvent flows within the membrane phase, and considerably in excess of the prediction for a diffusion process alone...|$|E

Increasing temperature from 15 to 30 °C increased GABA uptake, diminished the maximal value of the relaxation time constant of the presteady-state currents and increased the amplitude of the current associated with the transport of GABA. The curve of the presteady-state charge versus voltage was shifted toward negative potentials by increasing the temperature, while the maximal amount of charge (Qmax) remained constant; the τ versus V curve was also negatively shifted by increasing temperatures. Analysis of the outward (α) and inward (β) rate constants as functions of temperature showed that they are affected differently, with a Q 10 = 3. 4 for α and Q 10 = 1. 5 for β.

30|$|In {{the entire}} group, the microcirculatory {{variables}} that increased after the fluid challenge were the RBC velocity {{and the corresponding}} coefficient of variation. The RBC velocity reflects microvascular convective oxygen transport. The relevance of fluid-induced changes in the RBC velocity is uncertain. Fluids might produce tissue edema, which condition could increase diffusional distances with the subsequent reduction in PVD and diffusional oxygen transport [24]. In patients with septic shock, {{a significant difference in}} sublingual PVD and heterogeneity has been reported between survivors and nonsurvivors, but the RBC velocity was similar in both of those patient outcomes [2]. These results suggest that diffusional determinants are more critical to tissue oxygenation than convective parameters. In the present study, the increase in RBC velocity occurred {{in the face of an}} unchanged PVD, suggesting that fluid challenge actually increased microvascular oxygen transport. Moreover, in fluid-responsive patients, sublingual PVD and RBC velocity improved in parallel with the increase in cardiac output. In addition, the reduction in the coefficient of variation associated with the RBC velocity could have contributed an improvement of the tissue oxygenation because of the critical role of heterogeneity in oxygen extraction [25]. Although most of the microvascular variables behaved similarly, our analysis and the present discussion are based mainly on the PVD. This parameter is the microcirculatory variable that best summarizes the convective and <b>diffusional</b> <b>components</b> of microvascular oxygen transport. The PVD reflects primarily diffusional influences, because the vascular density determines the diffusional distances along with the surface area available for oxygen exchange. In addition, PVD takes into account a convective component, such as the presence of continuous flow.|$|R

Preincubation with cal A (100 nM) reduces the initial taurine influx by about 20 %, but {{has no effect on}} the <b>diffusional</b> <b>component</b> of the taurine influx or on the taurine release from cells suspended in isotonic or in hypotonic medium. Thus, cal A-sensitive phosphatases only affect taurine transport mediated by the Na+-dependent taurine transporter.

The Michaelis–Menten constant for binding of Na+ to the taurine transporter is concomitantly increased from 96 ± 11 to 129 ± 8 mM and the Na+:taurine coupling ratio for activation of the transport cycle is reduced from 3. 3 ± 0. 6 to 2. 4 ± 0. 2.

Application {{of these models}} to overgrowths and veins in the Kodiak accretionary complex suggests that the Kodiak Formation deformed continuously by a grain-boundary diffusion-limited mechanism, accompanied by episodic pore fluid diffusion of quartz from the matrix to vertical fluid-filled fractures near {{the base of the}} accretionary wedge. These processes produced two types of syntectonic crystal textures within the Kodiak Formation: overgrowths containing displacement-controlled fibers, and throughgoing veins composed of face-controlled elongate blocky quartz crystals. Based on textural observations, displacement-controlled quartz growth in overgrowths is rate-limited by either diffusion along a cohesive interface or the rate of matrix strain. The magfiitude of elongation recorded by displacement-controlled crystal growth varies smoothly (elongation of 1 to 3) from the shallowest to the deepest structural levels of the Kodiak Formation, suggesting that the <b>diffusional</b> <b>component</b> of deformation in the accretionary wedge increases with depth.

However, decreases in bilayer hydration resulted in dramatically reduced diffusion coefficient values for both probes with substantially greater impact on Ns-R diffusion. These data suggested that hydration dependent diffusional differences could {{be a function of}} relative probe location along the bilayer normal. In this communication, we have addressed the relative effect of the rhodamine substituent on Ns-R diffusion complex by examining the diffusional dynamics of free rhodamine B under the same conditions used to evaluate Ns-R complex and phospholipid diffusion.

This suggests a regulatory step in the absorption of sorbitol in the small intestine. The mechanism of intestinal transport of sorbitol was studied in vitro in jejunal fragments obtained by endoscopy or by surgery. The intracellular concentration (C) of sorbitol was measured at stationary state {{in the presence of}} 10 mmol sorbitol in the incubation medium (M). The ratio C/M was less than 1 (0. 66 +/- 0. 04, mean +/- SEM) and was not modified by phloridzin (0. 63 +/- 0. 06) or metabolic inhibitors (0. 59 +/- 0. 03) but was diminished by ouabain (0. 5 +/- 0. 05, p less than 0. 05).

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedA one-dimensional analytical model for axial deformation of continuous fiber reinforced metal-matrix composites under both thermal cycling and isothermal creep, {{with or without}} externally applied stresses, has been developed. Fibers in the model {{are considered to be}} non-creeping, therm-elastic solids, whereas the matrix is considered to be thermo-elastic-plastic and creeping. The model accounts for the strain history of the composite, and allows for changing matrix creep mechanisms via the use of unified creep laws. The use of unified creep laws allows separation of the overall instantaneous creep strain rate into dislocation creep and <b>diffusional</b> creep <b>components,</b> which can be further separated into power law breakdown, pipe diffusion controlled power law, volume diffusion controlled power law, Coble and Nabarro-Herring creep. Additionally, the model allows for the incorporation of time-dependent interfacial sliding near the extremities of the fiber due to the existence of interfacial shear stresses. Based on a recent study, interfacial creep has been represented as being controlled by diffusional flow with a threshold stress (Bingham flow). The interfacial creep law allows simulation of non-isostrain deformation across the interface, and thus the model is capable of explaining experimental observations of strain incompatibility across the interface near fiber-ends. It is envisioned that such a model will be useful in discerning the predominant matrix creep mechanism at a variety of time periods for a given applied stress and temperature, and thus make it possible for the generation of transient deformation mechanism maps for composites[URL]...|$|R

Diffusion couples were assembled with α-phase (FCC) Cu-Ni-Zn alloys and annealed at 775 °C. The annealed couples were analyzed for concentration profiles by electron probe microanalysis and interdiffusion fluxes and interdiffusion coefficients were determined over selected composition ranges by Dayananda-Sohn analysis. The interdiffusion analysis {{was carried out by}} using a computer program, MultiDiflux, developed by Dayananda and Ram-Mohan. In the Cu-Ni-Zn couples, interdiffusion fluxes of Ni and Cu were observed to be enhanced up the concentration gradient of Zn. ^ Applicability of the MultiDiflux program for the interdiffusion analysis of quaternary diffusion couples was assessed {{with the aid of a}} test couple characterized by an arbitrarily selected set of constant quaternary interdiffusion coefficients. The MultiDiflux program was also utilized for the determination of quaternary interdiffusion coefficients from profiles of two experimental Cu-Ni-Zn-Mn diffusion couples investigated at 775 °C. The quaternary interdiffusion coefficients evaluated over selected composition ranges from the test as well as the experimental Cu-Ni-Zn-Mn couples were checked for their acceptability by regenerating the concentration profiles from error function solutions for n-component diffusion couples derived by Ram-Mohan and Dayananda through a transfer matrix method (TMM). The TMM methodology was implemented in the MultiDiflux program and used successfully for all the quaternary couples. In the Cu-Ni-Zn-Mn couples, the interdiffusion flux of Ni was enhanced up the concentration gradients of Mn and the interdiffusion flux of Cu increased up the gradient of Zn. Also, the main interdiffusion coefficients of Zn and Mn were observed to be one order of magnitude larger than that of Ni. ^ Analytical expressions were developed for spatial and temporal evolution of concentration profiles in single-phase multicomponent multilayered diffusion assemblies (MDAs) assembled with a number of finite alloy-layers of various compositions sandwiched between two bulk terminal alloys. The expressions were successfully used for the prediction of concentration profiles in an experimental Cu-Ni-Zn MDA assembled with a single sandwiched layer and annealed at 775 °C. The analytical expressions were also used to simulate evolution of concentration profiles and diffusion paths for a ternary MDA containing a single finite middle layer as a function of layer thickness (h) and time (t). The diffusion path of such an MDA varies with time and each path configuration is associated with a unique h/ t ratio. <b>Diffusional</b> interactions among <b>components</b> may lead to either depletion or accumulation of individual components in the middle layer of an MDA. ^ The MultiDiflux program was also employed for the determination of ternary interdiffusion coefficients for the (β) Ni-Ru-Al alloys from diffusion couple assembled with NiAl and RuAl disks and annealed at 1100 °C. ...|$|R

This is an important functional parameter because it determines whether regions within the heart are normoxic or dysoxic. Although the heterogeneity of the supply side of oxygen has been primarily described by flow heterogeneity, the <b>diffusional</b> <b>component</b> of oxygen supply should not be ignored, especially at high resolution (tissue regions < 1 g). Such oxygen diffusion {{does not seem to}} take place from arterioles or venules within the heart, but seems to occur between capillaries, in contrast to data recently obtained from other tissues. Oxygen diffusion may even become the primary determinant of oxygen supply during obstructed flow conditions. Studies aimed at modelling regional blood flow and oxygen consumption have demonstrated marked regional heterogeneity of oxygen consumption matched by flow heterogeneity Direct, non-invasive indicators of the balance between oxygen supply and consumption include NADH videofluorimetry (mitochondrial energy state) and microvascular PO 2 measurement by the Pd-porphyrin phosphorescence technique. These indicators have shown a relatively homogeneous distribution during physiological conditions supporting the notion of regional matching of oxygen supply with oxygen consumption. NADH videofluorimetry, however, has demonstrated large increases in functional heterogeneity of this ratio in compromised hearts (ischemia, hypoxia, hypertrophy and endotoxemia) with specific areas, referred to as microcirculatory weak units, predisposed to showing the first signs of dysoxia.

40|$|We {{validate}} {{here the}} Two-Phase Thermodynamics (2 PT) method for calculating the standard molar entropies and heat capacities of common liquids. In 2 PT, the thermodynamics {{of the system}} is related to the total density of states (DoS), obtained from the Fourier Transform of the velocity autocorrelation function. For liquids this DoS is partitioned into a <b>diffusional</b> <b>component</b> modeled as diffusion of a hard sphere gas plus a solid component for which the DoS(υ) → 0 as υ → 0 as for a Debye solid. Thermodynamic observables are obtained by integrating the DoS with the appropriate weighting functions. In the 2 PT method, two parameters are extracted from the DoS self-consistently to describe diffusional contributions: the fraction of diffusional modes, f, and DoS(0). This allows 2 PT to be applied consistently and without re-parameterization to simulations of arbitrary liquids. We find that the absolute entropy of the liquid can be determined accurately from a single short MD trajectory (20 ps) after the system is equilibrated, making it orders of magnitude more efficient than commonly used perturbation and umbrella sampling methods. Here, we present the predicted standard molar entropies for fifteen common solvents evaluated from molecular dynamics simulations using the AMBER, GAFF, OPLS AA/L and Dreiding II forcefields. Overall, we find that all forcefields lead to good agreement with experimental and previous theoretical values for the entropy and very good agreement in the heat capacities. These results validate 2 PT as a robust and efficient method for evaluating the thermodynamics of liquid phase systems. Indeed 2 PT might provide a practical scheme to improve the intermolecular terms in forcefields by comparing directly to thermodynamic properties...|$|E

We interpret the results in terms of three classes of water: buried water well inside of the dendrimer surface, surface water associated with the dendrimer-water interface, and bulk water well outside of the dendrimer. We studied the dynamic and thermodynamic properties of the water at three pH values: high pH {{with none of the}} primary or tertiary amines protonated, intermediate pH with only the primary amines protonated, and low pH with all amines protonated. For all pH values we find that both buried and surface water exhibit two relaxation times: a fast relaxation (1 ps) corresponding to the libration motion of the water and a slow (20 ps) <b>diffusional</b> <b>component</b> related to the escaping of water from one domain to another. In contrast for bulk water the fast relaxation is 0. 4 ps while the slow relaxation is 14 ps. These results are similar to those found in biological systems, where the fast relaxation is found to be 1 ps while the slow relaxation ranges from 20 to 1000 ps. We used the 2 PT MD method to extract the vibrational (power) spectrum and found substantial differences for the three classes of water. The translational diffusion coefficient for buried water is 11 - 33 % (depending on pH) of the bulk value while the surface water is about 80 %. The change in rotational diffusion is quite similar: 21 - 45 % of the bulk value for buried water and 80 % for surface water. This shows that translational and rotational dynamics of wate...|$|E
40|$|The {{processes}} {{that govern the}} regulated transport of long-chain fatty acids across the plasma membrane are quite distinct compared to counterparts involved in the transport of hydrophilic solutes such as sugars and amino acids. These differences stem from the unique {{physical and chemical properties}} of long-chain fatty acids. To date, several distinct classes of proteins have been shown to participate in the transport of exogenous long-chain fatty acids across the membrane. More recent work is consistent with the hypothesis that in addition to the role played by proteins in this process, there is a <b>diffusional</b> <b>component</b> which must also be considered. Central to the development of this hypothesis are the appropriate experimental systems, which can be manipulated using the tools of molecular genetics. Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae are ideally suited as model systems to study this process in that both (i) exhibit saturable long-chain fatty acid transport at low ligand concentrations, (ii) have specific membrane-bound and membrane-associated proteins that are components of the transport apparatus, and (iii) can be easily manipulated using the tools of molecular genetics. In both systems, central players in the process of fatty acid transport are fatty acid transport proteins (FadL or Fat 1 p) and fatty acyl coenzyme A (CoA) synthetase (FACS; fatty acid CoA ligase [AMP forming] [EC 6. 2. 1. 3]). FACS appears to function in concert with FadL (bacteria) or Fat 1 p (yeast) in the conversion of the free fatty acid to CoA thioesters concomitant with transport, thereby rendering this process unidirectional. This process of trapping transported fatty acids represents one fundamental mechanism operational in the transport of exogenous fatty acids...|$|E
40|$|Unconjugated {{bilirubin}} (UCB) {{is currently}} believed {{to cross the}} placenta only by passive diffusion. To assess whether carrier-mediated transport might be involved, the uptake of [(3) H]-UCB by basal (bTPM) and apical (aTPM) plasma membrane vesicles from human placental trophoblast at term was investigated. In both types of vesicles, the uptake of [(3) H]-UCB into an osmotically sensitive space was temperature-dependent, independent {{of the presence of}} Na(+), and not affected by changes in membrane potential. The uptake of [(3) H]-UCB by aTPM, but not bTPM, was activated by ATP hydrolysis and inhibited by vanadate. Thus, the exact contribution of both inside out and right-side out bTPM to UCB uptake could not be distinguished, while only inverted aTPM were expected to carry out ATP-dependent UCB uptake. In bTPM and aTPM, uptake of free (unbound) [(3) H]-UCB (B(f)) consisted of a dominant, saturable, presumably carrier-mediated process and a <b>diffusional</b> <b>component</b> that became predominant only at B(f) near or above aqueous solubility limit for UCB (70 nM). For bTPM, K(m) = 7. 2 nM; V(max) = 9. 8 pmol/ 20 s/mg protein; and diffusion coefficient (K(D)) = 0. 14 ml/ 20 s/mg protein. For aTPM in the presence of 9. 5 m M ATP, K(m) = 18 n M; V(max) = 131 pmol/ 20 s/mg protein; and K(D) = 0. 47 ml/ 20 s/mg protein. The uptake of [(3) H]-UCB by bTPM was cis-inhibited by estrone- 3 -sulfate and estradiol- 17 beta-glucuronide and trans-stimulated by unlabelled UCB and bromosulphopthalein. ATP-dependent UCB uptake by aTPM was cis-inhibited by doxorubicin, cholic acid, methotrexate and pronenecid. These findings suggest the presence of distinct transporters in the two domains of human placental trophoblast that could cooperate to transfer UCB from the foetus to the maternal circulation...|$|E
40|$|The placental uptake of L-alanine was {{studied by}} using {{purified}} brush-border membrane vesicles from rat trophoblasts. Saturation curves {{were carried out}} at 37 degrees C in buffers containing 100 mM (zero-trans) -NaSCN, -NaCl, -KSCN, -KCl, or -N-methyl-D-glucamine gluconate. The uncorrected uptake results were fitted by non-linear regression analysis to an equation involving one <b>diffusional</b> <b>component</b> either one or two saturable Michaelian transport terms. In the presence of NaCl, two distinct L-alanine transport systems were distinguished, named respectively System 1 (S- 1; Vm 1 about 760 pmol/s per mg of protein; KT 1 = 0. 5 mM) and System 2 (S- 2; Vm 2 about 1700 pmol/s per mg; KT 2 = 9 mM). In contrast, {{in the presence of}} K+ (KCl = KSCN) or {{in the absence of any}} alkali-metal ions (N-methyl-D-glucamine gluconate), only one saturable system was apparent, which we identify as S- 2. When Na+ is present, S- 1, but not S- 2, appears to be rheogenic, since its maximal transport capacity significantly increases in the presence of an inside-negative membrane potential, created either by replacing Cl- with the permeant anion thiocyanate (NaSCN > NaCl) or by applying an appropriate K+ gradient and valinomycin. alpha-(Methylamino) isobutyrate (methyl-AIB) appears to be a substrate of S- 1, but not of S- 2. For reasons that remain to be explained, however, methyl-AIB inhibits S- 2. We conclude that S- 1 represents a truly Na(+) -dependent mechanism, where Na+ behaves as an obligatory activator, whereas S- 2 cannot discriminate between Na+ and K+, although its activity is higher in the presence of alkali-metal ions than in their absence (Na+ = K+ > N-methyl-D-glucammonium ion). S- 2 appears to be fully developed 2 days before birth, whereas S- 1 undergoes a capacity-type activation between days 19. 5 and 21. 5 of gestation, i. e. its apparent Vmax. nearly doubles, whereas its KT remains constant...|$|E

Jlysmc {{can be described as}} the sum of a saturable process with a Kt of 3 mM and a Jmax of 2. 25 micromole/cm 2. hr and a <b>diffusional</b> <b>component</b> corresponding to a lysine permeability of 0. 014 cm/hr. Also Jlysms is well described as the sum of a saturable process and a diffusional contribution described by the same permeability as for Jlysmc. 2. The effects of the transmural p. d. on Jlysmc indicate that at 60 mM this flux includes a diffusional contribution, which corresponds to a lysine permeability of 0. 014 cm/hr. 3. The passage of an electrical current across the gut wall changes the electrical conductance as expected for a cation-selective epithelium. The effect of a mucosa to serosa current on the Jms value of mannitol provides confirmation of the expected current effect on transepithelial volume flow. These effects on conductance and solute flux, together with the electrostatic effect on lysine movements, suffice to account for the p. d. effects on Jmc, Jms, and Jsm of lysine. 4. Jlyssm is in a saturable manner stimulated by increasing concentrations of D-glucose. At higher (10 mM) concentrations of lysine this effect leads to a net secretion of lysine. Qualitatively and quantitatively these effects are consistent with the model of a glucose-induced fluid circuit between the mucosal solution and the lateral intercellular spaces. 5. All observations are consistent with a paracellular, transepithelial pathway for lysine, which includes the lateral intercellular spaces. 6. The transport of lysine across the basolateral membrane is analysed.

40|$|Atomistic {{molecular}} dynamics simulations {{are used to}} study generation 5 polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimers immersed in a bath of water. We interpret the results in terms of three classes of water:[*] buried water well inside of the dendrimer surface, surface water associated with the dendrimer−water interface, and bulk water well outside of the dendrimer. We studied the dynamic and thermodynamic properties of the water at three pH values:[*] high pH {{with none of the}} primary or tertiary amines protonated, intermediate pH with only the primary amines protonated, and low pH with all amines protonated. For all pH values we find that both buried and surface water exhibit two relaxation times:[*] a fast relaxation (∼ 1 ps) corresponding to the libration motion of the water and a slow (∼ 20 ps) <b>diffusional</b> <b>component</b> related to the escaping of water from one domain to another. In contrast for bulk water the fast relaxation is ∼ 0. 4 ps while the slow relaxation is ∼ 14 ps. These results are similar to those found in biological systems, where the fast relaxation is found to be ∼ 1 ps while the slow relaxation ranges from 20 to 1000 ps. We used the 2 PT MD method to extract the vibrational (power) spectrum and found substantial differences for the three classes of water. The translational diffusion coefficient for buried water is 11 − 33 % (depending on pH) of the bulk value while the surface water is about 80 %. The change in rotational diffusion is quite similar:[*] 21 − 45 % of the bulk value for buried water and 80 % for surface water. This shows that translational and rotational dynamics of water are affected by the PAMAM−water interactions as well as due to the confinement in the interior of the dendrimer. We find that the reduction of translational or rotational diffusion is accompanied by a blue shift of the corresponding libration motions (∼ 10 cm- 1 for translation, ∼ 35 cm- 1 for rotation), indicating higher local force constants for these motions. These effects are most pronounced for the lowest pH, probably because of the increased rigidity caused by the internal charges. From the vibrational density of states we also calculate the enthalpies and entropies of the various waters. We find that water molecules are enthalpically favored near the PAMAM dendrimer:[*] energy for surface water is ∼ 0. 1 kcal/mol lower to that in the bulk, and ∼ 0. 5 − 0. 9 kcal/mol lower for buried water. In contrast, we find that both the buried and surface water are entropically unfavored:[*] buried water is 0. 9 − 2. 2 kcal/mol lower than the bulk while the surface water is 0. 1 − 0. 2 kcal/mol lower. The net result is a thermodynamically unfavored state of the water surrounding the PAMAM dendrimer:[*] 0. 4 − 1. 3 kcal/mol higher for buried water and 0. 1 − 0. 2 kcal/mol for surface water. This excess free energy of the surface and buried waters is released when the PAMAM dendrimer binds to DNA or metal ions, providing an extra driving force...|$|E
40|$|Tese de Doutoramento em CiênciasPlants are {{essential}} for energy input into the living world. As photoautotrophic multicellular organisms, higher plants represent complex mosaics of highly differentiated tissues that fulfil specific functions. These specializations are accompanied by a loss of tissue autonomy making it indispensable for different cell types to collaborate even over long distances. Plants produce carbohydrates by the fixation of carbon dioxide during photosynthesis {{that takes place in}} the chloroplasts of mesophyll cells of mature leaves. Heterotrophic cells in the roots, reproductive structures, storage and developing organs rely on the supply of this assimilated carbon for their growth and development. Plant sugar transporters {{play a crucial role in}} assimilate partitioning, ensuring efficient phloem loading at source tissues and the adequate supply of carbohydrates to sink tissues. Morphogenesis, development, and ultimately plant productivity depend on a constant and fine regulation of plant sugar transporters expression and activity, which allows coordinate exchanges between the different cells, tissues and organs. The studies presented in this work, aim for a better understanding of the biochemical and molecular mechanisms involved in the transmembrane transport of photoassimilates in higher plants, how this critical cellular process is regulated and how it may help plants to cope with harsh physiological conditions such as limited sugar availability and increased salinity. Special attention was devoted to the study of photoassimilate transport in Olea europaea and Vitis vinifera. These plant species represent two of the most important agricultural and economical crops in the World. Chapter 1 presents a General Introduction regarding transport of photoassimilates and its regulation in higher plants. In Chapter 2 the biochemical and molecular events occurring during olive fruit development and maturation, in particular fatty acid and triacylglycerol synthesis are revised, as well as the key role of mannitol and monosaccharide transporters in providing carbon skeletons for the corresponding biosynthetic pathways and energy for cellular metabolism in general. This leads the way to Chapter 3, in which the identification and characterization of a H+-dependent mannitol transport system in cultured cells of O. europaea is presented. In the scope of this work, a partial cDNA sequence of the corresponding gene was cloned and named OeMaT 1 (O. europaea mannitol transporter 1). Results show that mannitol/H+ symport activity in cultured cells is well correlated with OeMaT 1 transcription that is strongly induced by high concentrations of NaCl in the culture medium resulting in a dramatic increase of mannitol transport activity. Together with the down-regulation of mannitol dehydrogenase activity, this results in the increase of intracellular mannitol accumulation in order to compensate the decrease of external water activity, thus providing a tolerance mechanism to salinity in O. europaea. O. europaea, as a stachyose and raffinose producing plant, translocates these oligosaccharides throughout the phloem. At sink tissues, in particular olive fruits, stachyose and raffinose are converted into the constituent monosaccharides by the combined action of extracellular α-galactosidase and invertase activities. The uptake of the resulting glucose, fructose and galactose into olive fruit cells is mediated by the monosaccharide/H+ symporter, OeMST 2. Expression of OeMST 2 cDNA in an hxt-null Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain restored its capacity to grow on and transport with high affinity glucose. Kinetic and energetic studies performed in the transformed yeast confirmed the role of OeMST 2 as a monosaccharide/H+ symporter. OeMST 2 was shown to be strongly expressed throughout fruit maturation, where it is believed to play a crucial role in the massive accumulation of monosaccharides into olive fruits. These results are presented and discussed in Chapter 4. In O. europaea cultured-cells, besides H+-dependent transport (saturable), at least partly mediated by OeMST 2, a superimposed diffusional transport (linear) component represents the major mode of uptake at high external glucose concentrations. In Chapter 5, the nature of this low-affinity, high-capacity, <b>diffusional</b> <b>component</b> is studied providing the bases to understand its physiological significance for the plant. The involvement of a facilitated diffusion through a mercury-sensitive hydrophilic channel whose transport capacity may be regulated by intracellular protonation and phosphorylation/dephosphorylation is postulated. In addition to their function as metabolic resources, sugars are also important regulators of many processes associated with plant growth, maturation, senescence, stress responses, and in the integration of environmental inputs. Their regulatory activities include both the repression and induction of many genes involved in essential metabolic processes. The ability to sense alteration of sugar concentrations is important in the context of resource allocation allowing the plant to tailor its metabolism to face wildly fluctuating sugar levels. Results presented in Chapter 6 show that sugar transport in cultured-cells of V. vinifera is tightly regulated by sugar levels in the medium. The data indicate that VvHT 1 (V. vinifera hexose transporter 1), a high-affinity monosaccharide/H+ symporter previously identified in grape berry during maturation, mediates most of glucose transport activity in grape cultured-cells. High glucose levels repress VvHT 1 expression involving both a hexokinase-dependent decrease of VvHT 1 transcription and a hexokinase-independent post-transcriptional regulation. The same pattern of regulation was observed for OeMST 2 expression (chapter 4), supporting the role of hexokinase as a sugar sensor mediating a glucose repression pathway of monosaccharide transporters expression at least in some plant species. V. vinifera is a particularly attractive and convenient working model to study the regulation of monosaccharide transporters expression and activity by sugars. The presence of both positive (inducing) and negative (repressing) sugar response cis elements in the VvHT 1 promoter region suggests that this transporter is under complex control by sugars. Moreover, grape berry development and ripening is characterized by massive sugar import into the berries. In Chapter 7, a general overview of the biochemical events that occur throughout berry development and ripening is presented. Although sugars are either partially or completely transformed during wine production, sugar import and accumulation into the ripening berry is a major parameter determining wine quality. Sugar status is directly related to the final alcoholic content of wine, and regulates several genes responsible for the development of its aromatic and organoleptic properties. In conclusion, the mechanisms of sugar transport into sink cells of two important plant species were studied in detail at a biochemical and molecular level. Mannitol uptake revealed to be a critical response process to high salinity in O. europaea as well in providing mannitol as an efficient carbon and energy source for cellular growth and development. Monosaccharide transport was shown to be highly regulated by sugar levels both at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level. A solid set of results support the role of hexokinase as a sugar sensor responsible for the activation of the pathway leading to the transcriptional repression of some monosaccharide carriers. In heterotrophic cell cultures, glucose uptake revealed to be mediated by the operation of a saturating high-affinity H+-dependent transport system superimposed to a low-affinity/high capacity diffusion-like transport. While the former is the result of the fairly known plant monosaccharide carriers’ activity, the latter transport mode for sugars may represent a new and exciting research area in plant biology as it seems to involve the activity of a channel-like protein structure yet to be identified at the molecular level. The careful characterization of the membrane transport processes (and how they are regulated) underlying resource allocation is crucial to fully understand source - sink regulation and to be in a position to manipulate the complex interactions for agricultural benefit. As plantas são essenciais para a introdução de energia e de componentes estruturais nos sistemas vivos. Como organismos multicelulares e fotoautotróficos, as plantas superiores representam complexos mosaicos de tecidos altamente diferenciados que desempenham funções específicas. Esta especialização é acompanhada por uma perda de autonomia dos tecidos tornando indispensável a interacção das células, ainda que separadas espacialmente. As plantas produzem hidratos de carbono por intermédio da fixação de CO 2 nos cloroplastos das células do mesófilo das folhas maduras. As células heterotróficas das raízes, das estruturas reprodutivas e dos órgãos de armazenamento ou em desenvolvimento, como as folhas jovens, dependem do fornecimento deste carbono assimilado. Os transportadores de açúcar desempenham um papel crucial na distribuição dos fotoassimilados, garantindo a sua incorporação eficiente nos vasos condutores (floema) ao nível dos tecidos produtores, bem como o fornecimento adequado ao nível dos tecidos heterotróficos (descarregamento do floema). A morfogénese, o desenvolvimento e, consequentemente, a produtividade vegetal, dependem de mecanismos de regulação sensíveis da expressão e actividade dos transportadores de açúcar, permitindo assim trocas organizadas entre os tecidos autotróficos e os tecidos heterotróficos. Os estudos apresentados no presente trabalho de tese, pretendem contribuir para a compreensão dos mecanismos bioquímicos e moleculares envolvidos no transporte transmembranar de fotoassimilados nas plantas superiores e de como este processo celular é regulado, permitindo à planta responder a condições fisiológicas adversas, tais como disponibilidade limitada de açúcares ou salinidade elevada. É dedicada atenção especial ao estudo do transporte de fotoassimilados em Olea europaea (oliveira) e Vitis vinífera (videira), duas espécies vegetais de grande importância económica e agrícola. Após uma Introdução Geral sobre o transporte de açúcares e a sua regulação em plantas (Capítulo 1), no Capítulo 2 é apresentada uma revisão sobre os eventos bioquímicos e moleculares que ocorrem ao longo do desenvolvimento e amadurecimento da azeitona. Atenção especial é dada à síntese de ácidos gordos e triglicerídeos, bem como ao papel chave dos transportadores de manitol e de monossacarídeos na disponibilização de esqueletos de C para as respectivas vias biossintéticas e de energia para o metabolismo celular. No Capítulo 3 são apresentados e discutidos resultados sobre a identificação e caracterização de um sistema de transporte de polióis dependente de H+ em células em suspensão de O. europaea. No âmbito deste trabalho, foi clonada uma sequência parcial de cDNA denominada OeMaT 1 (O. europaea mannitol transporter 1). A actividade do simportador manitol/H+ demonstrou estar correlacionada com a transcrição do gene OeMaT 1 que é fortemente induzida por elevadas concentrações de NaCl presentes meio de cultura, resultando num incremento significativo da actividade de transporte do manitol. Em paralelo, elevadas concentrações de NaCl, provocam a diminuição da actividade da enzima manitol desidrogenase, responsável pelo primeiro passo de conversão intracelular do manitol, resultando na acumulação intracelular deste composto de modo a compensar a diminuição de actividade da água no espaço extracelular. Foi então demonstrado que o manitol, para além do seu papel em O. europaea como importante fonte de carbono e energia, actua como soluto compatível uma vez que a sua acumulação intracelular constitui um mecanismo de tolerância à salinidade. O. europaea produz estaquiose e rafinose ao nível dos tecidos fotossintéticos e transporta estes oligossacarídeos ao longo do floema. Ao nível dos tecidos heterotróficos, em particular nos tecidos do fruto, a estaquiose e a rafinose são convertidas nos monossacarídeos constituintes por intermédio da actividade de α-galactosidases e invertases extracelulares. A incorporação da glucose, frutose e galactose nas células da azeitona é mediada, pelo menos em parte, pelo transportador OeMST 2, que medeia o co-transporte de monossacarídeos com H+. A expressão do cDNA OeMST 2 numa estirpe mutante de Saccharomyces cerevisiae deficiente no transporte da glucose (“hxt-null”) restaurou a capacidade da levedura crescer em meio com glucose e de transportar o açúcar com elevada afinidade. Estudos cinéticos e energéticos conduzidos na levedura transformada confirmaram o papel da proteína OeMST 2 como simportador de monossacarídeos com H+. O respectivo gene, OeMST 2, revelou ser fortemente expresso ao longo do amadurecimento da azeitona, onde deve desempenhar um papel crucial na acumulação de monossacarídeos. Estes resultados são apresentados e discutidos no Capítulo 4. Em células em suspensão de O. europaea, para além do sistema de transporte activo do tipo monossacarídeo/H+ (saturável), mediado, pelo menos em parte, pelo transportador OeMST 2, uma componente difusional (linear) representa o único modo de transporte na presença de elevadas concentrações de glucose extracelular. No Capítulo 5 pretende-se clarificar a natureza desta componente de transporte difusional, de baixa afinidade e de elevada capacidade, bem como contribuir para a compreensão da relevância fisiológica deste mecanismo para a planta. É postulado o envolvimento de transporte do tipo difusão facilitada mediado um canal hidrofílico sensível ao mercúrio, regulado por protonação intracelular e fosforilação/desfosforilação, estrutura proteica ainda por identificar ao nível molecular. A possibilidade dos monossacarídeos poderem ser transportados por canais semelhantes a aquaporinas pode representar uma mudança significativa do paradigma do transporte transmembranar de açúcares nos seres vivos. Para além de actuarem como precursores metabólicos, os açúcares constituem importantes moléculas reguladoras de inúmeros processos associados com o crescimento, a maturação, a senescência, e a resposta ao stresse, bem como com a integração de vários sinais ambientais. Algumas das actividades reguladoras dos açúcares incluem a repressão e indução de vários genes envolvidos em processos metabólicos essenciais. A capacidade de percepção do açúcar permite à planta adaptar o metabolismo de acordo com a sua disponibilidade no meio extracelular, mecanismo importante no contexto da distribuição de fotoassimilados. No Capítulo 6 são apresentados resultados que mostram que o transporte de açúcares em células em suspensão de V. vinifera é rigorosamente regulado pelos níveis de açúcar do meio de cultura. Neste modelo celular o transporte da glucose é mediado por um simportador do tipo monossacarídeo/H+ de elevada afinidade, VvHT 1 (V. vinifera hexose transporter 1), previamente identificado na uva durante o processo de amadurecimento. A transcrição do gene VvHT 1 é fortemente reprimida por elevadas concentrações de glucose ou de 2 -desoxiglucose, mas não pelo análogo não fosforilável 3 -O-metil-D-glucose ou por glucose na presença de manoheptulose, sugerindo o envolvimento de um mecanismo de repressão dependente da hexocinase. A 3 -O-metil-D-glucose ou a glucose na presença de manoheptulose induzem a diminuição da actividade transportadora pela redução da quantidade de VvHT 1 na membrana plasmática, sem afectar os níveis de transcritos do respectivo gene, sugerindo o envolvimento de um mecanismo de regulação pós-transcricional independente da hexocinase. Pela primeira vez em plantas foi mostrado que os transportadores de açúcares podem ser regulados pelo próprio substrato ao nível transcricional e pós-transcricional. Um padrão de regulação semelhante foi observado para a expressão do gene OeMST 2 (Capítulo 4), suportando o papel da hexocinase como sensor de glucose responsável pela activação da via de repressão da expressão de transportadores de monossacarídeos pela glucose, pelo menos em algumas espécies vegetais. V. vinifera é um modelo vegetal particularmente atractivo para o estudo da regulação da expressão de transportadores de monossacarídeos pelos níveis de açúcar. A presença de vários elementos cis de resposta a açúcares no promotor do gene VvHT 1 sugere que a sua expressão está sujeita a uma complexa regulação pelos níveis de açúcar. O processo de desenvolvimento e amadurecimento da uva é caracterizado pela acumulação de elevadas concentrações de açúcares no vacúolo das células do mesocarpo. No Capítulo 7 é apresentada uma revisão sobre os eventos bioquímicos e moleculares que ocorrem durante este processo. O transporte e acumulação de açúcares nas uvas constituem dois dos principais parâmetros que determinam a qualidade do vinho, embora presentes em quantidades residuais no produto final. Com efeito, os níveis de açúcar das uvas estão directamente relacionados com o teor alcoólico final do vinho e regulam a expressão de inúmeros genes responsáveis pelo desenvolvimento das propriedades aromáticas e organolépticas do fruto e, consequentemente, do vinho. No seu conjunto, os resultados obtidos no presente trabalho de tese permitiram contribuir para a elucidação dos mecanismos envolvidos no transporte de açúcares em duas espécies vegetais de elevada importância económica, a videira e a oliveira. A caracterização detalhada dos processos de transporte transmembranar de açúcares, e da sua regulação, é crucial para uma melhor compreensão dos mecanismos de interacção entre os tecidos produtores e consumidores das plantas, podendo a sua manipulação contribuir no futuro para o aumento da produtividade das espécies vegetais.
