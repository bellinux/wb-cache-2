5|$|On December 12 the Dukes faced {{off against}} another local rival, Robert Morris. In a 59–54win, B.J. Monteiro again {{led the team}} with 17points. Monteiro's {{continued}} high level of play prompted some analysts, as well as fans, to wonder whether the approaching return of Melquan Bolding would send Monteiro back to the bench, or <b>if</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> would lose their starting position. Four days later the Dukes held off the Canisius Golden Griffins in a double overtime 86–77 victory at home. Bill Clark and Damian Saunders both contributed double doubles while B.J. Monteiro scored a career high 27 points.|$|E
5|$|This led {{to further}} {{complications}} in the writing process. For a few days, {{it was thought that}} Monk and Dr. Kroger would work to solve the case, but upon realizing that Monk {{would not be able to}} go back to a clinical detachment with Dr. Kroger, they eliminated this idea. So instead, Dr. Kroger does appear in more scenes than he normally does, but he stays out of the investigation scenes. As a result, Monk and Dr. Kroger do not break into Francis Merrigan's office to snoop around, though that would have been the typical thing to do <b>if</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> were there. Rather, they simply peer through the sliding glass door that opens from Merrigan's office into the courtyard.|$|E
5|$|After {{all that}} has been said and done, {{what are we to}} make of Lloyd George’s legacy as a war leader? On the home front he {{achieved}} varied results in tackling difficult, and in some instances, unprecedented problems. It would be hard to have improved on his dealings with labour and the program to increase homegrown food, but in the sectors of manpower, price control and food distribution he adopted the same approach as his predecessor, taking action only in response to the changing nature of the conflict. In the vital area of national morale, while he did not have the technical advantages of Churchill, his personal conduct damaged his ability to do more to inspire the nation. All things considered, it is unlikely that any of his political contemporaries could have handled matters at home as effectively as he did, although it can be argued that <b>if</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> had been in charge, the difference would not have been sufficient to change the final outcome. In his conduct of the war he did advance the cause of the Entente significantly in some ways, but in determining strategy, one of the most important tasks for which a prime minister must be responsible, he was undeniably a failure. To sum up, while Lord George's contributions outweighed his mistakes, the margin is too narrow, in my opinion, to include him In the pantheon of Britain's outstanding war leaders.|$|E

25|$|Formerly, {{scholars}} {{believed that}} the myth of Ishtar's descent took place {{after the death of}} Ishtar's lover Tammuz and that Ishtar had gone to the underworld to rescue him. However, the discovery of a corresponding myth about Inanna, the Sumerian counterpart of Ishtar, has shed some light on the myth of Ishtar's descent, including its somewhat enigmatic ending lines. In the Sumerian version of the story, Inanna can only return from the Underworld <b>if</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> is taken there as her replacement. A horde of galla demons follow her out of the Underworld to ensure this. However, each time Inanna runs into someone, she finds him to be a friend and lets him go free. When she finally reaches her home, she finds her husband Dumuzid, the Sumerian equivalent of Tammuz, seated on his throne, not at all grieved by her death. In anger, Inanna allows the demons to take Dumuzid back to the underworld as her replacement. Dumuzid's sister Geshtinanna is grief-stricken and volunteers to spend half the year in the underworld, during which time Dumuzid can go free. The Ishtar myth presumably had a comparable ending, Belili being the Babylonian equivalent of Geshtinanna.|$|E

Meanwhile, Khiêm had been putting pressure on Khánh for over two months by charging him and the Buddhists of seeking a [...] "neutralist solution" [...] and [...] "negotiating with the communists". At the same time, Khánh's relationship with the Americans—particularly Ambassador and retired General Maxwell Taylor—had broken down over a series of policy disputes and personal arguments, and the Americans were trying to encourage Khánh's colleagues to overthrow him so that more hawkish policies could be enacted. The other generals wanted to overthrow Khánh and were aware that Thảo—who was widely distrusted—was planning to make a move. They anticipated trouble in trying to keep their subordinates, who were becoming impatient with Khánh's ongoing tenure, from joining Thảo. Between January and February, Thảo continued to finalize the details of his own counter-coup, using the contacts he had cultivated over the past decades.|$|E

The ruling junta appealed to Thảo in newspaper advertisements and broadcasts to follow orders to report, but he ignored them. Due to his Catholicism, Thảo was able to recruit Diệm loyalists such as Phát. In mid-January 1965, the regime called for him to report to his superiors in the ARVN, warning that he would be [...] "considered guilty of abandoning his post with all the consequences of such a situation" [...] if he failed to do so.

Janis {{described his}} relationship to Horowitz during that period as a surrogate son, and he often traveled with Horowitz and his wife during concert tours. Davis was invited {{to become one of}} Horowitz's students after receiving a call from him the day after he won the Franz Liszt Competition. At the time, Davis had a contract with Columbia Records and a national tour planned. Horowitz claimed that he had only taught three students during that period.

I stopped work with them, because they did not progress." [...] According to biographer Glenn Plaskin, [...] "The fact that Horowitz disavowed most of his students and blurred the facts regarding their periods of study says something about the erratic nature of his personality during that period".

2500|$|In 2012, Tom Perrotta of The Wall Street Journal called Radwańska [...] "the most tactically sound, subtle {{tennis player}} in the world." [...] Over the years she has been given the nicknames [...] "The Magician", [...] "Ninja" [...] and [...] "The Professor", {{due to the fact}} that she can pull off the most {{difficult}} shots in the game with ease. Radwańska's game is founded on variety, mobility, and a tendency to anticipate her opponent's actions. She often uses this style to construct rallies—either opening the court up for a winner, or prompting a surprised opponent to hit a misplaced return. Her primary weapons include a mixture of slices and lobs, along with her ability to hit the ball at a variety of angles. She also makes use of a disguised drop shot, often swung with the same motion as a normal stroke during a rally. She is also noted for her crouching shots, during which she quickly drops in place to return or redirect a low ball, along with her use of an overhead backhand while on defense. In fact, she is known for having invented her distinctive squat position shot, where she sits so low on her haunches that she can play half-volleys with a horizontal racket. “I’m not sure if I invented it,” says Radwanska, “but I was definitely one of the first ones. When I watch TV, I can hear commentators say that was my shot, even <b>if</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> is playing, so it’s nice to hear I can put something new into tennis”.|$|E

She also said that she was planning on going on tour to support the album around February and that she wanted the initial phase to be a [...] "smaller club tour". Simpson said in a January 2008 interview that the album celebrated her love of life and described how working with Timbaland, Hugo and Kenna was a change of pace; she also said that she wrote or co-wrote all of the songs on the album: [...] "This is my art and it's personal. <b>If</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> writes the song without my input, it doesn't feel honest." [...] The lyrics on Bittersweet World are [...] "more abstract" [...] than on past albums, according to Simpson, but she was [...] "still singing about things I've gone through or friends went through", calling the subject matter [...] "diverse and universal". According to Simpson, having already achieved two number one albums caused her to feel less pressure in making Bittersweet World, and she felt she had more freedom to do what she wanted with the album. She said that the album was recorded over the course of about a year, concluding around January 2008. Much of the songwriting was done in the studio; Simpson sometimes went to the beach before going to the studio in order to clear her mind.|$|E
