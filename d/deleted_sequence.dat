50|$|The {{structural}} models {{shown in}} figures 1-3 for IFNγ are all shortened at their C-termini by 17 amino acids. Full length IFNγ is 143 amino acids long, the models are 126 amino acids long. Affinity for heparan sulfate resides solely within the <b>deleted</b> <b>sequence</b> of 17 amino acids. Within this sequence of 17 amino acids lie two clusters of basic amino acids termed D1 and D2, respectively. Heparan sulfate interacts with both of these clusters. In the absence of heparan sulfate {{the presence of the}} D1 sequence increases the rate at which IFNγ-receptor complexes form. Interactions between the D1 cluster of amino acids and the receptor may be the first step in complex formation. By binding to D1 HS may compete with the receptor and prevent active receptor complexes from forming.|$|E
40|$|We have {{isolated}} a {{simian virus}} 40 deletion mutant, F 8 dl, that lacks the sequences from 0. 168 to 0. 424 map units. The <b>deleted</b> <b>sequences</b> represent over 60 % of the coding region for large T antigen. Despite this deletion, F 8 dl abortively transformed rat cells {{as efficiently as}} wild-type simian virus 40. From this result, we conclude that {{the region of the}} simian virus 40 genome between 0. 168 and 0. 424 map units is not essential for abortive transformation. Since abortive transformation requires the expression of the simian virus 40 maintenance functions, we also infer that the <b>sequences</b> <b>deleted</b> from F 8 dl are not required to maintain transformation...|$|R

50|$|According to an {{interview}} with writer Steven E. de Souza, for the Den of Geek web site in December 2013, the original cut of Judge Dredd was rated NC-17, {{and had to be}} re-cut and submitted to the MPAA five times in order to get an R rating. This was before Stallone and the studio tried to cut the film even further to get a PG-13 rating. For example, the scene where Rico kills news reporter Hammond and his wife was originally longer, and showed them getting hit by bullets in slow-motion. The scene where the ABC Warrior robot kills Judge Griffin by ripping his arms and legs off while Griffin screams was also deleted for these reasons. This scene was not to be shown onscreen, but director Cannon wanted to make the film more and more violent (just like original comic was, which he was a fan of) despite the fact that studio and Stallone wanted a PG-13, with more focus on humour. Probably the most infamous <b>deleted</b> <b>sequence</b> is the one where Dredd fights and shoots clone Judges during the ending. This scene was deleted for unknown reasons, however, some promotional stills show parts of it, with clones waking up and Dredd shooting one of them. There was also a magazine article about this <b>deleted</b> <b>sequence.</b> Some of the other parts were cut out as well, by Stallone and the studio. Cannon was so disheartened over his constant creative disputes with Stallone that he swore he would never again work with another big-name actor. He also stated that the final version was completely different from the script, due to the changes Stallone demanded. In later interviews, Stallone said he felt the film was supposed to be an action comedy film, and demanded rewrites to make it even more comedic. The director and screenwriter, however, had intended a darker, more satirical approach, which led to many difficulties behind the scenes.|$|E

5000|$|The {{method is}} based on the {{principle}} of α-complementation of the β-galactosidase gene. This phenomenon of α-complementation was first demonstrated in work done by Agnes Ullmann in the laboratory of François Jacob and Jacques Monod, where the function of an inactive mutant β-galactosidase with <b>deleted</b> <b>sequence</b> was shown to be rescued by a fragment of β-galactosidase in which that same sequence, the α-donor peptide, is still intact. [...] Langley et al. showed that the mutant non-functional β-galactosidase was lacking in part of its N-terminus with its residues 11—41 deleted, but it may be complemented by a peptide formed of residues 3—90 of β-galactosidase. M13 filamentous phage containing sequence coding for the first 145 amino acid was later constructed by Messing et al., and α-complementation via the use of a vector was demonstrated by the formation of blue plaques when cells containing the inactive protein were infected by the phage and then grown in plates containing X-gal.|$|E

40|$|Mycobacterium africanum {{is thought}} to {{comprise}} a unique species within the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. M. africanum has traditionally been identified by phenotypic criteria, occupying an intermediate position between M. tuberculosis and M. bovis according to biochemical characteristics. Although M. africanum isolates present near-identical sequence homology to other species of the M. tuberculosis complex, several studies have uncovered large genomic regions variably deleted from certain M. africanum isolates. To further investigate the genomic characteristics of organisms characterized as M. africanum, the DNA content of 12 isolates was interrogated by using Affymetrix GeneChip. Analysis revealed genomic regions of M. tuberculosis deleted from all isolates of putative diagnostic and biological consequence. The distribution of <b>deleted</b> <b>sequences</b> suggests that M. africanum subtype II isolates are situated among strains of “modern” M. tuberculosis. In contrast, other M. africanum isolates (subtype I) constitute two distinct evolutionary branches within the M. tuberculosis complex. To test for an association between <b>deleted</b> <b>sequences</b> and biochemical attributes used for speciation, a phenotypically diverse panel of “M. africanum-like” isolates from Guinea-Bissau was tested for these deletions. These isolates clustered together within one of the M. africanum subtype I branches, irrespective of phenotype. These results indicate that convergent biochemical profiles can be independently obtained for M. tuberculosis complex members, challenging the traditional approach to M. tuberculosis complex speciation. Furthermore, the genomic results suggest a rational framework for defining M. africanum and provide tools to accurately assess its prevalence in clinical specimens...|$|R

40|$|Molecular {{analysis}} of dystrophin Kobe showed that exon 19 of the dystrophin gene bearing 52 -bp deletion was skipped during splicing, although the known consensus sequences at the 5 ' and 3 ' splice sites of exon 19 were maintained (Matsuo, M., T. Masumura, H. Nishio, T. Nakajima, Y. Kitoh, T. Takumi, J. Koga, and H. Nakamura. 1991. J. Clin. Invest. 87 : 2127 - 2131). These {{data suggest that}} the <b>deleted</b> <b>sequence</b> of exon 19 may function as a cis-acting element for exact splicing for the upstream and downstream introns. To investigate this potential role of exon 19, an in vitro splicing system using artificial dystrophin mRNA precursors (pre-mRNAs) was established. Pre-mRNA containing exon 18, truncated intron 18, and exon 19 was spliced precisely in vitro, whereas splicing of intron 18 was almost completely abolished when the wild-type exon 19 was replaced by the dystrophin Kobe exon 19. Splicing of intron 18 was not fully reactivated when dystrophin Kobe exon 19 was restored to nearly normal length by inserting other sequences into the deleted site. These results suggest that the presence of the exon 19 sequence which is lost in dystrophin Kobe is more critical for splicing of intron 18 than the length of the exon 19 sequence. Characteristically, the efficiency of splicing of this intron seemed to correlate with the presence of polypurine tracks within the downstream exon 19. Moreover, an antisense 31 -mer 2 '-O-methyl ribonucleotide complementary to the 5 ' half of the <b>deleted</b> <b>sequence</b> in dystrophin Kobe exon 19 inhibited splicing of wild-type pre-mRNA in a dose- and time-dependent manner. This first in vitro evidence that dystrophin pre-mRNA splicing can be modulated by an antisense oligonucleotide raises the possibility of a new therapeutic approach for Duchenne muscular dystrophy...|$|E
40|$|Transmissible {{gastroenteritis}} (TGE) is a coronavirus-induced {{disease of}} pigs, characterised by diarrhoea and vomiting. The incidence {{of the disease}} had been decreasing since the late 1980 s when deletion mutant variants (porcine respiratory coronavirus, PRCoV) of the virus emerged, repressing TGE gradually. Although disease manifestations are infrequent, the virus is still present in pig herds, causing sporadic outbreaks in a milder form. Identification and characterisation of the spike genes from TGEV and PRCoV, detected in such outbreaks, were performed in Hungary. Analysis of the amplified partial gene sequences showed that TGEV was present in herds with TGE clinical signs together with PRCoV.

The 59 amino acid deletion reduced LANA episome persistence by ~ 14 -fold, while sequentially smaller deletions resulted in ~ 3 -fold, or no deficiency. Three distinct LANA regions reorganized heterochromatin, one of which contains the <b>deleted</b> <b>sequence,</b> but the deletion did not abolish LANA's ability to alter chromatin.

We fused these promoter mutations to the coding sequences of either the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase or the dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) gene and tested {{the ability of a}} cotransfected EIa gene to stimulate EIV expression. All of the mutations tested were stimulated in these assays, implying that no specific sequence is required for stimulation. Two mutant promoters, deleted for either the TATA box or the region residing between - 39 and - 177 upstream from the cap site of EIV mRNA, did show a reduced level of stimulation by the EIa products. To assess the effects of the EIA gene products on expression from an EIV promoter integrated into the chromosome, we isolated CHO cell lines containing EIV-DHFR chimeric genes. After introduction of the EIa gene with a second selectable marker, expression from all mutant EIV-DHFR genes was increased. Surprisingly, one mutant promoter, <b>deleted</b> for <b>sequences</b> between - 39 and - 177, lost the ability to respond to the EIa region on passage of cells, although deletions in any part of the region still retained this ability.

Deletion of the RRE during reverse-transcription lead to the reconstitution of a functional hygromycin phosphotransferase gene in the target cell.

Real-time quantitative PCR of genomic DNA of cells transduced with the RRE-deleting vectors that were selected using an independent drug resistance marker, which measured both functional and nonfunctional recombination events, indicated that the overall efficiency of RRE deletion of hygromycin phosphotransferase gene, was between 73. 6 % and 83. 5 %...|$|R
