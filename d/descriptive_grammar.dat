5|$|Although {{there is}} no {{standard}} or official writing system for Ottawa, a widely accepted system is used in a recent dictionary of Ottawa and Eastern Ojibwe, a collection of texts, and a <b>descriptive</b> <b>grammar.</b> The same system is taught in programs for Ojibwe language teachers. One of its goals is to promote standardization of Ottawa writing so that language learners are able {{to read and write}} in a consistent way. By comparison, folk phonetic spelling approaches to writing Ottawa based on less systematic adaptations of written English or French are more variable and idiosyncratic, and do not always make consistent use of alphabetic letters. While the modern orthography is used in a number of prominent publications, its acceptance is not universal. Prominent Ottawa author Basil Johnston has explicitly rejected it, preferring to use a form of folk spelling in which the correspondences between sounds and letters are less systematic. Similarly, a lexicon representing Ottawa as spoken in Michigan and another based on Ottawa in Oklahoma, use English-based folk spellings distinct from that employed by Johnson.|$|E
5|$|Explorer Samuel de Champlain was {{the first}} European to record an {{encounter}} with Ottawa speakers when he met a party of three hundred Ottawas in 1615 {{on the north shore}} of Georgian Bay. French missionaries, particularly members of the Society of Jesus and the Récollets order, documented several dialects of Ojibwe in the 17th and 18th centuries, including unpublished manuscript Ottawa grammatical notes, word lists, and a dictionary. In the 19th century, Ottawa speaker Andrew Blackbird wrote a history of the Ottawa people that included a description of Ottawa grammatical features. The first linguistically accurate work was Bloomfield's description of Ottawa as spoken at Walpole Island, Ontario. The Odawa Language Project at the University of Toronto, led by Kaye and Piggott, conducted field work in Ottawa communities on Manitoulin Island in the late 1960s and early 1970s, resulting in a series of reports on Ottawa linguistics. Piggott also prepared a comprehensive description of Ottawa phonology. Rhodes produced a study of Ottawa syntax, a dictionary, and a series of articles on Ottawa grammar. Valentine has published a comprehensive <b>descriptive</b> <b>grammar,</b> a volume of texts including detailed analysis, as well as a survey of Ojibwe dialects that includes extensive description and analysis of Ottawa dialect features.|$|E

40|$|Genes {{are highly}} {{structured}} objects. Identifying genetic structure is experimentally costly and in general, is only partially determined in the lab. As such, genomic databases such as GenBank are vastly underspecified. We describe various Case Based Reasoning (CBR) techniques, {{designed to take}} advantage of the homologous nature of genes, in order to discover regulatory features not present in the GenBank nucleic acid sequence database. We build a classification hierarchy reflecting the evolutionary relationship between genes. A sequence based CBR technique uses neighboring genes within the hierarchy as cases in order to predict the presence and location of regulatory features not listed in GenBank. Using a grammatical model of gene structure, we describe each gene with an instance <b>grammar,</b> and induce <b>descriptive</b> <b>grammars</b> of gene classes from these instance <b>grammars.</b> <b>Descriptive</b> <b>grammars</b> then serve as cases that enable us to identify regulatory features not present within the instance g [...] ...|$|R

50|$|Some <b>descriptive</b> <b>grammars</b> treat {{adverbial}} and adjectival participles {{as distinct}} lexical categories, while others include {{them both in}} a single category of participles.

We present the data drawing together observations from standard <b>descriptive</b> <b>grammars,</b> examples from corpus searches of reputable sites and work with informants, and show that the observed picture departs in some respects from the standard view in <b>descriptive</b> <b>grammars.</b> Data from the interaction with NP-internal coordination throws up some intriguing challenges. The restrictions on the prenominal domain which we explore appear to place the problem squarely at the interface of syntax and morphology: are we dealing with morphological constructions, cases of phrasal affixation, or some form of restricted lexical constructions? What weight should be given to tests such as the Coordination Criterion (Miller, 1992 a) ? In sum, we consider that the data we discuss pose a challenge t...|$|R
