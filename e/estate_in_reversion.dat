6000|$|Meanwhile I am consoling {{myself for}} your absence by finding my [...] {{advantage}} in it--shining like Hesperus when Hyperion has departed; [...] sitting with our Hebrew prophet, {{and making a}} study of his head, in [...] the hours when {{he used to be}} occupied with you--getting credit with [...] him as a learned young Gentile, who would have been a Jew if he could [...] --and agreeing with him in the general principle, that whatever is [...] best is for that reason Jewish. I never held it my forte to be [...] a severe reasoner, but I can see that if whatever is best is A, and B [...] happens to be best, B must be A, however little you might have [...] expected it beforehand. On that principle I could see the force of a [...] pamphlet I once read to prove that all good art was Protestant. [...] However, our prophet is an uncommonly interesting sitter--a better [...] model than Rembrandt had for his Rabbi--and I never come away from him [...] without a new discovery. For one thing, it is a constant wonder to me [...] that, with all his fiery feeling for his race and their traditions, he [...] is no straight-laced Jew, spitting after the word Christian, and [...] enjoying the prospect that the Gentile mouth will water in vain for a [...] slice of the roasted Leviathan, while Israel will be sending up plates [...] for more, ad libitum, (You perceive that my studies had taught [...] me what to expect from the orthodox Jew.) I confess that I have always [...] held lightly by your account of Mordecai, as apologetic, and merely [...] part of your disposition to make an antedeluvian point of view lest [...] you should do injustice to the megatherium. But now I have given ear [...] to him in his proper person, I find him really a sort of [...] philosophical-allegorical-mystical believer, and yet with a sharp [...] dialectic point, so that any argumentative rattler of peas in a [...] bladder might soon be pricked in silence by him. The mixture may be [...] one of the Jewish prerogatives, for what I know. In fact, his mind [...] seems so broad that I find my own correct opinions lying in it quite [...] commodiously, and how they are to be brought into agreement with the [...] vast remainder is his affair, not mine. I leave it to him to settle [...] our basis, never yet having seen a basis which is not a [...] world-supporting elephant, more or less powerful and expensive to keep. [...] My means will not allow me to keep a private elephant. I go into mystery [...] instead, as cheaper and more lasting--a sort of gas which is likely to [...] be continually supplied by the decomposition of the elephants. And if [...] I like the look of an opinion, I treat it civilly, without suspicious [...] inquiries. I have quite a friendly feeling toward Mordecai's notion [...] that a whole Christian is three-fourths a Jew, and that from the [...] Alexandrian time downward the most comprehensive minds have been [...] Jewish; for I think of pointing out to Mirah that, Arabic and other [...] incidents of life apart, there is really little difference between me [...] and--Maimonides. But I have lately been finding out that it is your [...] shallow lover who can't help making a declaration. If Mirah's ways [...] were less distracting, and it were less of a heaven to be in her [...] presence and watch her, I must long ago have flung myself at her feet, [...] and requested her to tell me, with less indirectness, whether she [...] wished me to blow my brains out. I have a knack of hoping, which is as [...] good as an <b>estate</b> <b>in</b> <b>reversion,</b> if one can keep from the temptation of [...] turning it into certainty, which may spoil all. My Hope wanders among [...] the orchard blossoms, feels the warm snow falling on it through the [...] sunshine, and is in doubt of nothing; but, catching sight of Certainty [...] in the distance, sees an ugly Janus-faced deity, with a dubious wink [...] on the hither side of him, and turns quickly away. But you, with your [...] supreme reasonableness, and self-nullification, and preparation for [...] the worst--you know nothing about Hope, that immortal, delicious [...] maiden forever courted forever propitious, whom fools have called [...] deceitful, as if it were Hope that carried the cup of disappointment, [...] whereas it is her deadly enemy, Certainty, whom she only escapes by [...] transformation. (You observe my new vein of allegory?) Seriously, [...] however, I must be permitted to allege that truth will prevail, that [...] prejudice will melt before it, that diversity, accompanied by merit, [...] will make itself felt as fascination, and that no virtuous aspiration [...] will be frustrated--all which, if I mistake not, are doctrines of the [...] schools, and they imply that the Jewess I prefer will prefer me. Any [...] blockhead can cite generalities, but the mind-master discerns the [...] particular cases they represent.|$|E
50|$|When John's younger brother, Sir Henry Norreys, was {{beheaded}} in 1536 for his supposed adultery {{with the}} queen, Anne Boleyn, John and his wife, Elizabeth, {{took over the}} care of Henry's orphaned children Henry and Mary.

The children were brought up by their childless uncle, Sir John Norreys. Henry's patrimony was restored to him by an Act of 1539 by King Henry VIII, and in December 1542 his uncle Sir John Norreys of Yattendon, was licensed to settle his <b>estates</b> <b>in</b> <b>reversion</b> on Henry, who was his ward, and on Margery, the younger daughter of John Williams, 1st Baron Williams of Thame, and their heirs.

40|$|Both the {{acridine}} half-mustard, ICR 191, and the nonalkylating azaacridine derivative, ICR 364 -OH, induce {{three classes}} of frameshift mutations in the histidine operon of Salmonella typhimurium. (i) One class is completely stable <b>in</b> <b>reversion</b> tests and {{is presumed to}} represent deletion of {{one or a few}} critical nucleotide pairs or two nearby frameshifts. One extended deletion was found out of 11 stable mutations. (ii) Of two spontaneously reverting classes which also are considered to predominantly involve base deletions, one is unaffected <b>in</b> <b>reversion</b> with ICR 191, nitrosoguanidine, and diethylsulfate, and the other is induced to revert with ICR 191. (iii) A third class, considered to predominantly involve base additions, responds <b>in</b> <b>reversion</b> tests with ICR 191 as well as with nitrosoguanidine and diethylsulfate. Other investigators have shown that one mutant of this class is a “plus” frameshift and that nitrosoguanidine acts <b>in</b> <b>reversion</b> to delete a guanine plus cytosine base pair. Although such plus frameshifts are found with high frequency among mutations selected from acridine-treated bacteria or when strong selection pressure is applied for their detection <b>in</b> <b>reversion</b> tests, data from this laboratory indicate that this class of plus frameshifts is rare among mutations derived spontaneously or after treatment with a variety of other mutagens. Finally, we demonstrate that the alkylating ICR 191 and the nonalkylating ICR 364 -OH preferentially cause mutations in different chromosome regions and that their spectra of activity only partially overlap that found for spontaneous frameshift mutations...|$|R

60|$|I. For {{the first}} of these, that the best things are yet behind, and <b>in</b> <b>reversion</b> for believers; this is {{manifest}} by the natural exercise of this grace. For 'hope that is seen, is not hope; for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for? But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it' (Rom 8:24,25). Hope lives not by sight, as faith doth; but hope trusteth faith, as faith trusts the Word, and so bears up the soul in a patient expectation at last to enjoy what God has promised. But I say, the very natural work of this grace proveth, that the believer's best things are behind <b>in</b> <b>reversion.</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the implications of}} mean <b>reversion</b> <b>in</b> stock prices for longterm investors such as pension funds. We start with a general definition of a meanreverting price process and explain how mean <b>reversion</b> <b>in</b> stock prices is related to mean <b>reversion</b> <b>in</b> stock returns. Subsequently, we show that mean reversion makes stocks less risky for investors with long investment horizons. Next, we consider a mean-variance efficient investor and show how mean <b>reversion</b> <b>in</b> stock prices affects such an investor’s optimal portfolio weights. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings for the investment decisions of long-term investors...|$|R
