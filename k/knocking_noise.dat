6000|$|The {{minister}} {{paused and}} {{seemed about to}} resume, when a scuffling and <b>knocking</b> <b>noise</b> drew all eyes toward the pew of the Gerrish family. Mr. Gerrish had risen and flung open the door so sharply that it struck against the frame-work of the pew, and he stood pulling his children, whom Mrs. Gerrish urged from behind, one after another, into the aisle beside him. One {{of them had been}} asleep, and he now gave way to the alarm which seizes a small boy suddenly awakened. His mother tried to still him, stooping over him and twitching him by the hand, with repeated [...] "Sh! 'sh's!" [...] as mothers do, till her husband got her before him, and marched his family down the aisle and out of the door. The noise of their feet over the floor of the vestibule died away upon the stone steps outside. The minister allowed the pause he had made to prolong itself painfully. He wavered, after clearing his throat, as if to go on with his sermon, and then he said sadly, [...] "Let us pray!" ...|$|E
5000|$|A type of sawmill {{without a}} crank is known from Germany called [...] "knock and drop" [...] or simply [...] "drop" [...] -mills. In these drop sawmills, the frame {{carrying}} the saw blade is knocked upwards by cams as the shaft turns. These cams are let into the shaft {{on which the}} waterwheel sits. When the frame carrying the saw blade is in the topmost position it drops by its own weight, making a loud <b>knocking</b> <b>noise,</b> {{and in so doing}} it cuts the trunk.|$|E
5000|$|Once {{the player}} has played their turn, they must say [...] "Last card" [...] {{if they only}} have one card left. If {{you think that you}} can finish your cards in one turn you say [...] "cards" [...] If they fail to do so, there is a penalty (see Endgame). An {{alternate}} method of doing this is 'knocking'. If a player thinks he can win on his next turn, he must warn the other players by making a <b>knocking</b> <b>noise</b> on the table or by saying 'knocking' (or both). If they fail to do so, there is a penalty.|$|E

50|$|The Scaled Hammer Action II {{has been}} {{described}} as being harder, more substantial and heavier compared to the previous versions. It is also widely criticized for its characteristic <b>knocking</b> <b>noises</b> when played at medium to high velocities, and considered as being heavier than a generic acoustic piano keys.|$|R
5000|$|For the 2001 model year, {{the engine}} design was {{slightly}} altered to produce [...] @ 4,750 rpm and [...] @ 3,250 rpm. Also, the previously leaky intercooler was redesigned. This problem was addressed as a recall in earlier models. A cast iron block was {{used instead of}} aluminum. These upgrades were critical {{in order to support}} the 8 psi (0.55 bar) of boost delivered from the stock Eaton M112 roots supercharger. Another engine revision came in the 2003 Model Year when a weakness in the heads, the lack of sufficient threads for spark plugs, was addressed and fixed, although [...] "piston slap", a mild <b>knocking</b> <b>noise</b> while the engine is cold, was still present. At {{the other end of the}} drivetrain, the final drive ratio was shortened to 3.73:1 with a 9.75 inch rear end in 2001. Also, in 2001 the drive shaft was increased in size to a 4.5 in aluminum unit, from the previous 3.5 in steel unit. The specially developed 295/45ZR-18 Goodyear Eagle F1-GS unidirectional tires were upgraded utilizing a new generation F1 GS rubber compound. With these engine and drivetrain revisions, Car and Driver magazine drove a Lightning from zero to 60 mi/h km/h in 5.2 seconds. For 2003, the Lightning's cargo capacity was raised from 800 lb to 1350 lb.|$|E
5000|$|The four wake up {{some time}} later (now all with flaming flatulence), and on the stroke of midnight hear a <b>knocking</b> <b>noise</b> from the front door. Richie answers it with some apprehension, and finds a teenage girl named Doreen wearing a Halloween Devil's mask, causing Richie {{to think that she}} is the Devil. He invites her in and asks for twenty-five years of {{non-stop}} sex in exchange for giving her his earthly soul. Richie tells everyone to [...] "clench" [...] after he farts fire again, then he tells Eddie to offer Doreen some of his blood to drink as it's [...] "90 percent proof". Reacting to the increasingly strange situation, Doreen then removes her mask and reveals herself as Dave's daughter. She has been sent by her mother to find out why her father is out so late. Eddie cuts his wrist and blood starts rapidly shooting out, and Dave grabs a glass to get the devil's drink only to stop when he recognizes his daughter - and then asks her if she had any [...] "tips for the 3:30 at Chepstow". Spudgun farts fire after he is allowed to [...] "unclench" [...] while a blood-soaked Eddie collapses into unconsciousness. Spudgun breaks wind again, and the jet of flame from his rear end detonates the box of explosive carrots Eddie had prepared earlier. The explosion ends in a freeze-frame and the credits roll.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. There are errors {{during the}} {{manufacturing}} and assembling of horizontal driving machine (HDM). So the exceptional <b>knocking</b> <b>noise</b> is generated during some products running. The failure rate of product quality is rising as well. The forward and reverse driving noise of HDM was tested and analyzed. Pictures was collected by universal tool microscope. The {{results show that}} hot runner is not smooth enough to reduce transferring pressure and increase the shrinkage of worm pouring gate. The situation leads to slight conical degree of product and pitch deviation at worm pouring gate. As the pitch makes worm inset slightly worm gear when clockwise rotating, the noise and vibration was produced consequently in this direction. The proposals were given, such as strengthening the maintenance of hot runners, controlling and inspecting product conical degree, and optimizing HDM mould and increasing its accuracy, and so on...|$|E
50|$|The Mug House has {{featured}} in the local news several times {{over the last few}} years due to stories that the pub is in some way haunted. The past few landlords have all claimed that there are regularly strange occurrences at the pub such as glasses smashing or dull <b>knocking</b> <b>noises</b> coming from the beer cellar at night. This has only increased the popularity of the pub.|$|R
60|$|The {{sound of}} Hicks's descent had hardly ceased when {{clapping}} and <b>knocking</b> <b>noises</b> were heard again, {{and the face}} of the troublesome little wretch reappeared. He waved Mr. Watterson aside with his left hand, and in default of specific orders the latter allowed him to mount to the deck again. Hicks stayed himself a moment, and lurched to where Staniford and Dunham sat with Lydia.|$|R
50|$|Plas TegYvette {{gives the}} girls {{a tour of}} the house, where she speaks out. They hear <b>knocking</b> <b>noises</b> {{throughout}} the house. They then decide to have a séance. Nicola then leaves the group and retreats to the taxi and psychologist Professor Geoffrey Beattie. During the séance objects are thrown around the room, supposedly by a squire who used to work at the house. Cheryl feels something touch her arm just before the séance. After the séance, the group split to find more ghosts. Cheryl and Kimberley go downstairs, while Sarah and Yvette stay upstairs. When Cheryl and Kimberley return, Cheryl's finger is flicked, presumably by the ghost.|$|R
40|$|Different {{types of}} rocks {{generate}} acoustic emission (AE) signals with various frequencies and amplitudes. How to determine rock types by their AE characteristics in field monitoring is also useful {{to understand their}} mechanical behaviors. Different types of rock specimens (granulite, granite, limestone, and siltstone) were subjected to uniaxial compression until failure, and their AE signals were recorded during their fracturing process. The wavelet transform was used to decompose the AE signals, and the artificial neural network (ANN) was established to recognize the rock types and <b>noise</b> (artificial <b>knock</b> <b>noise</b> and electrical noise). The results show that different rocks had different rupture features and AE characteristics. The wavelet transform provided a powerful method to acquire the basic characteristics of the rock AE and the environmental noises, such as the energy spectrum and the peak frequency, and the ANN was {{proved to be a}} good method to recognize AE signals from different types of rocks and the environmental noises...|$|R
50|$|Later, the Landlord mysteriously appears, {{ostensibly to}} check on the students. Suspicious of him, the Doctor tests him by asking who the Prime Minister is and names several, {{including}} Harriet Jones. The Landlord, however, evades the question and leaves. As night falls, the <b>knocking</b> <b>noises</b> grow, and Bill's friends start to disappear. All the exits from the house are sealed tight, preventing any of them from leaving and separating the remaining ones. Bill and Shireen see Pavel half-absorbed in the wall, and the Landlord appears, striking a tuning fork which causes Pavel to disappear completely. The Doctor discovers the house's woodwork infested with insect-like creatures he calls Dryads. They are responsible for drawing the others into the woodwork prior to consuming them. The Doctor and Harry soon find evidence that every twenty years, a new set of students have been brought to the house to feed the Dryads. The Landlord arrives and admits that he needs the Dryads to keep his daughter Eliza alive in the tower.|$|R
500|$|The defence's {{witnesses}} {{included some}} of those who had cared for Elizabeth Parsons and who presumably still believed that the ghost was real. [...] Other witnesses included the carpenter responsible for removing the wainscotting from Parsons' apartment and Catherine Friend, who to escape the <b>knocking</b> <b>noises</b> had left the property. [...] One witness's testimony caused the court to burst into laughter, at which she replied [...] "I assure you gentlemen, it is no laughing matter, whatever you may think of it." [...] Thomas Broughton was also called, as was a priest surnamed Ross, one of those who had questioned the ghost. [...] Judge Murray asked him [...] "Whether he thought he had puzzled the Ghost, or the Ghost had puzzled him?" [...] John Moore was offered support by several esteemed gentlemen and presented Murray with a letter from Thomas Secker, Archbishop of Canterbury, who sought to intercede on his behalf. [...] Murray placed the letter in his pocket, unopened, and told the court [...] "it was impossible it could relate to the cause in question." [...] Richard James and Richard Parsons also received support from various witnesses, some of whom although acknowledging Parsons' drink problem, told the court they could not believe he was guilty.|$|R
5000|$|Stewart {{engaged in}} harsh rhetoric with competitors. One of his editorials {{provoked}} Zantzinger McDonald of The American Manufacturer, a rival Democratic sheet, to enter Stewart's office and point a pistol at him. Stewart either bravely fended off his foe or {{dropped to the}} floor in fear, depending on whose account is to be believed. On the possibility of a further encounter with McDonald, Stewart wrote, [...] "I am ready in true Yankee fashion to <b>knock</b> the <b>noise</b> out of this sprig of nobility to the entire satisfaction of his friends...a native mechanic against one of the silk stocking nobility." [...] Stewart gave his age at the time as 22.|$|R
5000|$|The Amygdaloids {{were offered}} a {{recording}} {{deal with the}} music production company, <b>Knock</b> Out <b>Noise.</b> In June 2008 they did basic tracking for a new CD (producer, engineer, Stuart Chatwood; executive producer, Tim Sommer). A pre-release version of the CD called Brainstorm was issued in March 2009. It contains 17 songs, 14 by LeDoux and three by Volk. Grammy Award Winner Rosanne Cash sings duets with LeDoux {{on two of the}} songs, [...] "Mind Over Matter" [...] and [...] "Crime of Passion". The official release was June, 2010 and is called Theory of My Mind. [...] It includes an additional song, [...] "Theory of My Mind", that was written by LeDoux and featuring Simon Baron-Cohen (autism researcher from Cambridge, UK) on bass.|$|R
5000|$|Addington Bruce (1908) {{noted that}} the {{earliest}} records that document the haunting have large discrepancies from later reports. Accordingto Bruce the original records from the 18th century reduce the [...] "haunting" [...] to nothing more than some alleged creaking <b>noises,</b> <b>knocks,</b> footsteps or groaning sounds. Bruce commented that [...] "we are, therefore, justified in believing that in this case, {{like so many others}} of its kind, the fallibility of human memory has played an overwhelming part in exaggerating the experiences actually undergone." [...] He suggested that Hetty had produced the phenomena fraudulently.|$|R
6000|$|The Czarina was small, broad, and brown-looking, {{without the}} {{slightest}} [...] dignity or appearance. You had only {{to look at her}} to detect her low [...] origin. She might have passed for a German actress, she had decked [...] herself out in such a manner. Her dress had been bought second-hand, [...] and was trimmed with some dirty looking silver embroidery; the bodice [...] was trimmed with precious stones, arranged in such a manner as to [...] represent the double eagle. She wore a dozen orders; and round the [...] bottom of her dress hung quantities of relics and pictures of saints, [...] which rattled when she walked, and reminded one of a smartly harnessed [...] mule. The orders too made a great <b>noise,</b> <b>knocking</b> against each other.|$|R
5000|$|The young painter Hippolyte Schinner {{falls from}} a {{step-ladder}} {{while working in}} his atelier and is <b>knocked</b> unconscious. The <b>noise</b> of his fall alerts two of his neighbours, Adélaïde Leseigneur and her mother Madame de Rouville, who occupy the apartment immediately below. The two women revive the young man and an acquaintance is struck up. Inevitably, the young painter {{falls in love with}} Adélaïde and over the following weeks he pays frequent visits to her apartment. There he is always warmly welcomed, but he cannot help noticing the unmistakable signs of poverty - a poverty that the two women are at obvious pains to hide. Hippolytes suspicions are aroused. The mother and her daughter have different surnames; they are reluctant to reveal anything of their past; and what is Hippolyte to make of the two old friends of the mother, the Comte de Kergarouet and the Chevalier du Halga, who regularly visit her to play cards for money, but who always lose to her as though on purpose? ...|$|R
5000|$|Cajun/zydeco, country, R and B {{and rock}} 'n’ roll, and their fusion {{of all these}} into [...] "swamp pop," [...] were ever present {{influences}} in Southern Louisiana childhood. In high school, he was a disc jockey at the local radio station, KEUN, and the rhythm guitarist of two bands: the Deadbeats and the Countdowns. Although he remained an avid music fan in later life, he did not actively play guitar for many years. In 2004, LeDoux and NYU Biology Professor Tyler Volk began performing as a cover band for small parties around NYU, and in 2006 they formed The Amygdaloids. The original band also included Daniela Schiller, then an NYU postdoctoral fellow, and graduate student Nina Curley. The bands lyrics, mostly written by LeDoux, are based on neuroscientific, psychological, and philosophical themes, and offer scholarly insights {{into the role of}} mind and brain in daily life. Their inaugural CD, Heavy Mental, was released in 2007 and included such tunes as [...] "Mind-Body Problem,” [...] "An Emotional Brain,” and “Memory Pill.” On their second CD, Theory of My Mind (<b>Knock</b> Out <b>Noise</b> label), LeDoux and Grammy winner Rosanne Cash sing “Crime of Passion” and “Mind over Matter,” both written by LeDoux. In 2012, the band released All in Our Minds, an EP in which all songs had “mind” in their title. Anxious, a companion to LeDoux’s book with the same title, was released in 2015 and explores some of the same scientific themes as the book, but through song. The band’s unique focus on original songs about mind and brain has landed them considerable press. They play regularly in New York City, and have also performed in Washington DC, San Antonio TX, Indianapolis IN, and Lafayette LA, as well as in Montreal, Canada. LeDoux and Amygdaloids’ bassist Colin Dempsey perform as an acoustic duo called So We Are.|$|R
5000|$|One day in November, 1709 (or 1749 {{according}} to other {{versions of the}} story), a woman, washing her clothes by the shore of Lake Maracaibo saw a small wooden tablet floating towards her. She picked it up thinking it might be of some use and took it home with her, along with the clothes. The following morning, while preparing coffee, she heard knocks as if somebody was calling her. She went {{to see what had}} happened and was astonished to see the tablet shining, with the image of Our Lady of Chiquinquirá now upon it. In a variant of the tradition, the woman first saw no more than the outline of the Virgin on the tablet, and for this reason hung it on a wall of her house; later, on Monday, 18 November, she heard <b>knocking</b> and strange <b>noises</b> coming from inside her house, and upon investigation found the tablet dazzlingly bright, illuminated by lights which shone like a rainbow. Surprised and filled with a strong emotion, she ran out of her house, shouting “Milagro! Milagro!” - hence the name [...] "El Milagro" [...] (which means Miracle in Spanish) given to the avenue where this woman's house stood. Later on, many people arrived to witness the prodigy.|$|R
6000|$|There {{are many}} other {{elements}} in this article on which I should love to linger. But the matter which I wish to point out is that in that sentence is perfectly revealed the whole truth of what our Chamberlainites, hustlers, bustlers, Empire-builders, and strong, silent men, really mean by [...] "commonsense." [...] They mean <b>knocking,</b> with deafening <b>noise</b> and dramatic effect, meaningless bits of iron into a useless bit of wood. A man goes on to an American platform and behaves like a mountebank fool with a board and a hammer; well, I do not blame him; I might even admire him. He may be a dashing and quite decent strategist. He may be a fine romantic actor, like Burke flinging the dagger on the floor. He may even (for all I know) be a sublime mystic, profoundly impressed with the ancient meaning of the divine trade of the Carpenter, and offering to the people a parable {{in the form of}} a ceremony. All I wish to indicate is the abyss of mental confusion in which such wild ritualism can be called [...] "sound common sense." [...] And it is in that abyss of mental confusion, and in that alone, that the new Imperialism lives and moves and has its being. The whole glory and greatness of Mr. Chamberlain consists in this: that if a man hits the right nail on the head nobody cares where he hits it to or what it does. They care about the noise of the hammer, not about the silent drip of the nail. Before and throughout the African war, Mr. Chamberlain was always knocking in nails, with ringing decisiveness. But when we ask, [...] "But what have these nails held together? Where is your carpentry? Where are your contented Outlanders? Where is your free South Africa? Where is your British prestige? What have your nails done?" [...] then what answer is there? We must go back (with an affectionate sigh) to our Pearson for the answer to the question of what the nails have done: [...] "The speaker who hammered nails into a board won thousands of votes." ...|$|R
