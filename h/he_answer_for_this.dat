5000|$|Arguably {{the most}} internationally {{well-known}} incident {{from the show}} was a contestant in the Big Game who failed to answer a single question, using his entire 20 second time limit {{trying to think of}} an answer to his first question - [...] "What does a musician value the most?".

6000|$|Meanwhile {{the hapless}} negro is the {{fruitful}} subject of reprisals in other quarters. John Pettit, whom Tom Benton paid his respects to, you will recollect, calls the immortal Declaration [...] "a self-evident lie"; {{while at the}} birthplace of freedom--in the shadow of Bunker Hill and of the [...] "cradle of liberty," [...] {{at the home of}} the Adamses and Warren and Otis--Choate, from our side of the house, dares to fritter away the birthday promise of liberty by proclaiming the Declaration to be [...] "a string of glittering generalities"; and the Southern Whigs, working hand in hand with proslavery Democrats, are making Choate's theories practical. Thomas Jefferson, a slaveholder, mindful of the moral element in slavery, solemnly declared that he trembled for his country when he remembered that God is just; while Judge Douglas, with an insignificant wave of the hand, [...] "don't care whether slavery is voted up or voted down." [...] Now, if slavery is right, or even negative, he has a right to treat it in this trifling manner.

40|$|Poverty {{remains an}} endemic state of man. The curse imposed by an angry god on Adam and his {{descendants}} describes the human fate. Man experienced over history, with rare exceptions, toil, hard-ship and oppression. The uncertain and stringent conditions of life challenged man’s awareness. <b>He</b> sought <b>for</b> <b>answers</b> explaining <b>this</b> fate {{and these were}} couched {{in the form of}} myths and legends. An imaginative human mind invoked a fall from graceor a curse imposed by gods. Such orientations naturally affected man’s expectations of liberation from the grinding burden of toil and hardship. The resto-ration of grace appeared to be the crucial condition <b>for</b> such liberation. <b>This</b> elementary message emerged over the centuries in very dif-ferent forms and in widely varying detail. The basic story of man’s fate conveyed by ancient myths still persists with a subtle and per-vasive influence. The dominant ideologies of our time promise the restoration of(at least secular) grace with the liberation from human bondage topoverty. This promise of liberation should be realized by a collective action imposing a set of explicitly designed political institutions as the dominant mechanism for the coordination ofsociety, The ancient themes still reverberate under new labels in various branches of sociology or social psychology. But their influential repercussions on the intelligentsia market have been challenged for 200 years by the evolution of economic analysis. This analysis, ini-tiated by the Scottish philosophers of the 18 th century, offered a revolutionary insight into the social context ofman’s life This insigh...|$|R
5000|$|Serote's {{poems about}} places, {{particularly}} his Alexandra poems, {{grapple with the}} problems of squalor, violence, death, destitution, exploitation and the Black People's quest for identity and a sense of community. In the poem Alexandra, the speaker's inner-child addresses his 'mother'; [...] "Alexandra, my beginning was knotted to you, just like you knot my destiny". Alexandra (the place) is forever connected to the speaker, just like a mother would be forever connected to her child. The personification of Alexandra (the place) as mother-figure allows the speaker to emphasize the bond he has with the place; wherever he goes he carries the 'throb' of Alexandra deep within him - it has made him who he is. He was nourished on the [...] "dirty waters of (her) dongas" [...] and when he is thirsty he cries out <b>for</b> <b>this</b> 'mother', this mother who frightens him and whom he suspects to be cruel. <b>He</b> pleads <b>for</b> <b>answers</b> from <b>this</b> 'mother'; [...] "Do you love me Alexandra?" [...] and [...] "What have you done to me?" [...] Despite not receiving <b>answers</b> <b>he</b> cannot leave although others have distanced themselves from the memories and walked over him to go to [...] "far places". He is a product of his roots, he has been shaped by this 'mother' Alexandra, and he acknowledges that in the end he will always find his way back to her to lie amid the rubble, [...] "simple and black". The speaker of the poem creates an image to the reader, what his life was like during the apartheid times in South Africa.|$|R
