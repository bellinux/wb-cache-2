Harry goes to the party to find Annie, but is instead told by Tracy that they have a son together, whom she gave up for adoption over twenty years ago. Adrianna, who had previously stolen money from Naomi's purse, claims to have found it and gives it back. Naomi checks her phone messages and learns that Ethan is cheating on her. Naomi asks Ethan if he is really cheating on her, and leaves the party after he fails to answer. Annie leaves with Silver for another party on the beach, where she apologizes to Ethan for revealing that he was cheating on Naomi. When she asks why he told the truth about Dixon not starting the fight, he replies that he <b>is</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the good guy he used to be. Annie, Silver, Dixon and Navid {{spend the rest of the}} night swimming at the beach. In the closing scenes, Kelly talks to the father of her four-year-old son, Adrianna pays her drug dealer with money she stole from Naomi, and Ethan visits Naomi's house.|$|E
5|$|When Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) is irritated that Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) {{will not}} fulfill his {{landlord}} responsibilities and fix the dangerously substandard office wiring, {{he comes up}} with a plan to pretend that magnetic power is affecting the office and thus get the repairs as well as a week off from work for his wife Pam (Jenna Fischer) (whom he <b>is</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> extra nice to in the wake of not telling her about his new job plans). Dwight calls Jim's bluff and rents an overcrowded bus for the staff to work on, but Jim harnesses the office workers' love of a local pie stand to please Pam. Dwight eventually gets angry and climbs into the roof of the bus, refusing to drive any further. Pam suspects something else is wrong and asks Jim to talk to him. Jim learns that Dwight thought his magnetic power prank was real as he suspects he is infertile, which he has convinced himself explains why he was not the father of Angela Martin's (Angela Kinsey) baby. Jim tells Dwight he is like a father to the entire office, and Dwight then drives everyone to the pie stand where they have a great finish to their day.|$|E

500|$|Marissa Higgins, {{writing for}} xoJane, {{contended that the}} show [...] "didn't {{accomplish}} anything with their portrayal of sexual assault" [...] {{and said that she}} disliked the way that the story ended with Doggett effectively quitting her job as van driver in order to avoid further contact with Coates. Emma Eisenberg, of Salon, criticized the scenes depicting Doggett growing up in Waynesboro as being [...] "riddled with excessive Appalachian clichés". She went further by calling Doggett's mother unrealistic in her attitude towards sex: [...] "the mothers I met [...] wanted their daughters to understand sex and to make informed choices". Eisenberg claimed that, therefore, Doggett's mother's speech about sex − [...] "it’s like a bee sting, in and out, over before you knew it was happening" [...] − was not representative of people in Waynesboro at that time. Chloe Stillwell completely disagreed with Eisenberg and insisted that the character of Doggett was realistic: [...] "Eisenberg's argument completely misses the point that perhaps the show <b>is</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> as real as possible, and acknowledging that there are real life Pennsatuckies in this world isn't to disenfranchise Appalachia." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{describing}} the film's accuracy, Burton explained, [...] "it's {{not like a}} completely hardcore realistic biopic. In doing a biopic you can't help but get inside the person's spirit a little bit, so for me, some of the film <b>is</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> through Ed a little bit. So it's got an overly optimistic quality to it." [...] Burton acknowledged that he probably portrayed Wood and his crew in an exaggeratedly sympathetic way, stating {{he did not want}} to ridicule people who had already been ridiculed for a good deal of their life. Burton decided not to depict the darker side of Wood's life because his letters never alluded to this aspect and remained upbeat. To this end, Burton wanted to make the film through Wood's eyes. He said in an interview, [...] "I've never seen anything like them, the kind of bad poetry and redundancy– saying in, like, five sentences what it would take most normal people one [...] Yet still there is a sincerity to them that is very unusual, and I always found that somewhat touching; it gives them a surreal, weirdly heartfelt feeling." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{principal}} photography {{produced a}} high demand for extras as zombies. In {{an interview with}} MTV News, special effects artist Greg Nicotero stated that while anyone was welcome to audition, the producers of the show were looking specifically for people who possessed exceptional height and thin features. Casting for extras took approximately three days. Once accepted, the extras {{would be sent to}} [...] "zombie school" [...] for training and preparing for filming. Nicotero stated that [...] "it was interesting because I initially thought my experience with zombie movies is you just let them do whatever they want to do. George [...] always said, 'You show 50 people one movement, then you have 50 people doing all the same thing.' So we sort of just lined them up and said, 'Let's see what your zombie walk would look like,' and then they would do it and we would say, 'Try this or try that.' You know, sort of fine tuning everybody." [...] Alongside with Darabont, Nicotero had previously collaborated with Romero on several occasions, and looked at the structure of the zombies in his films for inspiration. [...] "It's not that I'm against [...] It's just not what I grew up with. It's interesting, too, because a couple takes we did, where a couple of the zombies kind of broke into a run, and after one take Frank's like, 'Did they run too fast? They shouldn't be running. Slow them down.' This <b>is</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> creepy and moody and, you know, you're building up all this kind of scary tension." ...|$|E

Roland G. Fryer, Jr., at Harvard University has noted that, [...] "There is necessarily a trade-off between doing well and rejection by your peers when you come from a traditionally low-achieving group, especially when that group comes into contact with more outsiders."

2500|$|Due to all {{of these}} threats a {{recovery}} plan was issued for endangered karst invertebrates. The plan was not issued until 1994, six years after it was listed endangered. Increased education on the distribution of the invertebrates and the threats that led to its endangerment took place during the six years before the plan was issued. Surveys were taken to help define the taxonomy and distribution of all karst fauna. One of these studies was conducted be the Texas department of transportation that studied the karst environment along highway 45 in Texas. Two surveyors (Elliott and Reddell) from the U.S. Fisheries and Wildlife Department took extensive surveys that helped better define the distribution and habitat of karst invertebrates. Also numerous fire ant control studies took place. The USFWD funded a study that included three types of treatments. The first included using nearly boiling water to pour in their mounds. The others included the chemicals Logic and Amdro. These chemicals are poisonous to arthropods and may end up killing the endangered species that <b>is</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> saved. Initially the treatments were affective, but areas were quickly re-infested.|$|E

2500|$|It is well {{documented}} that emotion influences many memory variables such {{as the amount of}} memory recalled and attributions of nostalgia. The issue regarding emotion and TOT is how it influences the tip-of-the-tongue state and the information that <b>is</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> recalled. It is common for individuals to ascribe emotions to TOTs. It is suggested that the majority of individuals experience TOTs negatively. It has been shown that experiencing an emotion predicts TOT memory performance later. Emotional TOTs {{are more likely to be}} recalled later than TOTs that had no emotional experience attached. Emotion and TOT are related to the metacognitive theory that is mentioned above. In this theory, TOTs inform our cognitive system if the information we are trying to recall is accessible. Thus, emotions may play a role in experiencing TOT. Some research has shown that questions that elicit emotional arousal create TOTs more so than questions that aren’t emotionally arousing. [...] It has also been found that emotional arousal can extend to subsequent questions or information being recalled even if they are not emotionally arousing themselves. It was found that emotional arousal increased the likelihood of experiencing TOT. Neuroimaging has also found activation in some areas that are associated with emotion; specifically in the anterior cingulate cortex.|$|E
2500|$|Like a Prayer {{received}} critical acclaim. Stephen Thomas Erlewine, from AllMusic, said {{in retrospect}} {{that it was}} Madonna's [...] "most explicit attempt at a major artistic statement", and that though she <b>is</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> [...] "serious" [...] Madonna delivers a range of well-written pop songs, making the album her [...] "best and most consistent". In The New Rolling Stone Album Guide, Barry Walters wrote that with its more substantial songs that [...] "covered topics such as spousal abuse and familial neglect", Like a Prayer [...] "effectively upped Madonna's ante as a serious artist". Annie Zaleski, from the entertainment website The A.V. Club, praised the album for [...] "being bold enough to delve into her parental issues", and called it [...] "Madonna's first truly substantial record, the dividing line between her chirpy club-kid days and the mature sounds and themes that increasingly marked her '90s work". In Rolling Stone, reviewer J. D. Considine wrote that Madonna's fame {{up to that point}} had been built more on [...] "image than artistry", but that with Like a Prayer Madonna was asking, successfully, to be taken seriously; [...] "Daring in its lyrics, ambitious in its sonics, this is far and away the most self-consciously serious album she's made. There are no punches pulled, anywhere". Considine concluded his review hailing the album [...] "as close to art as pop music gets ... proof not only that Madonna should be taken seriously as an artist but that hers {{is one of the most}} compelling voices of the Eighties." [...] Robert Christgau from The Village Voice lamented the [...] "kiddie psychedelia" [...] of [...] "Dear Jessie" [...] and was unmoved by [...] "Promise to Try" [...] and [...] "Act of Contrition", but felt all the other songs were memorable, especially the [...] "cocksucker's prayer" [...] of [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] and the [...] "thrilling", independence-themed [...] "Oh Father" [...] and [...] "Express Yourself". Lloyd Bradley of Q said, [...] "musically it's varied, unexpected and far from instantly accessible; lyrically, it's moving, intelligent and candid." [...] Edna Gundersen from USA Today wrote that album was [...] "Lyrically [...] a confessional feast, with Madonna's Catholic upbringing as the main course. Songs are rife with religious overtones, spiritual and hymnal arrangements and a host of references to joy, faith, sin and power". NME critic David Quantick hailed it as [...] "a brilliant, thoughtful, startling and joyful example of popular music." ...|$|E

60|$|It is {{necessary}} to make this first point clear: that in Great Expectations Dickens was really {{trying to be a}} quiet, a detached, and even a cynical observer of human life.

He <b>is</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> reasonable; but in spite of himself he is inspired. He <b>is</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> detailed, but in spite of himself he is gigantic.
