50|$|<b>Dysprosody</b> {{is usually}} {{attributed}} to neurological damage, such as brain tumors, brain trauma, brain vascular damage, stroke and severe head injury. To {{better understand the}} causes of the disease, 25 cases of <b>dysprosody</b> diagnosed between 1907-1978 were examined more closely. It was found that the majority developed <b>dysprosody</b> after a cerebrovascular accident, while another 6 cases developed after a head trauma. In that same study, 16 of the patients were female, while 9 were male. However, there has been no conclusive evidence that gender affects the onset of <b>dysprosody.</b> There has been no evidence that ethnicity, age, or genetics has any impact on the development of <b>dysprosody.</b>|$|E
50|$|Over time, {{there have}} also been cases of people {{suffering}} from <b>dysprosody</b> gaining their native accent back with no course of treatment. Since {{the part of the brain}} responsible for <b>dysprosody</b> has not definitely been discovered, nor has the mechanism for the brain processes which cause <b>dysprosody</b> been found, there has not been much treatment for the disease by means of medication.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dysprosody</b> {{works on}} a {{linguistic}} level in that it specifies the intent of one’s speech. For example, prosody is responsible for verbal variations in interrogative versus declarative statements and serious versus sarcastic remarks. Linguistic <b>dysprosody</b> refers to the diminished ability to verbally convey aspects of sentence structure, such as placing stress on certain words for emphasis or using patterns of intonation to reveal the structure or intention of an utterance. For example, individuals with linguistic <b>dysprosody</b> may have difficulty distinguishing the production of interrogative and declarative sentences, switching or leaving out the expected rising and falling shift, respectively. Thus, linguistic <b>dysprosody</b> alters an individual’s vocal identity and impairs verbal communication.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} types of <b>dysprosody</b> which have been classified. The most common types of <b>dysprosody</b> are associated with dysarthria and developmental coordination disorder, which affect motor processing in speech. Among the most studied types are: ...|$|E
50|$|In {{the past}} decade {{research}} on <b>dysprosody</b> has begun to focus on its relationship to other, more common diseases such as Parkinson's disease. Scientists believe that studying the connections between <b>dysprosody</b> and these better understood conditions may help them pinpoint specific {{areas of the brain}} responsible for prosody. Recent research has looked into the development of <b>Dysprosody</b> in connection with Parkinson's Disease, not only looking at voice and speech issues, but also the effects on cognitive-linguistic and prosody perception and production.|$|E
50|$|After {{experiencing}} brain injury, {{some people}} may begin speaking in an accent not native to their country of origin, as discussed in the preceding sections, but more common forms of <b>dysprosody</b> consist of alterations in vocal pitch, timing, rhythm, and control, not necessarily resulting in a foreign dialect. In addition, {{there have been some}} cases in which seizures began to develop in patients also suffering from <b>dysprosody,</b> but no decisive conclusions connecting <b>dysprosody</b> and seizure activity have been made.Dysprosody can last for differing durations, from a few months to years, although the reason seems to be unclear.|$|E
5000|$|Prosody {{refers to}} the {{variations}} in melody, intonation, pauses, stresses, intensity, vocal quality, and accents of speech. As a result, prosody has {{a wide array of}} functions, including expression on linguistic, attitudinal, pragmatic, affective and personal levels of speech. [...] People diagnosed with <b>dysprosody</b> most commonly experience difficulties in pitch or timing control. Essentially, people diagnosed with the disease can comprehend language and vocalize what they intend to say, however, they are not able to control {{the way in which the}} words come out of their mouths. Since <b>dysprosody</b> is the rarest neurological speech disorder discovered, not much is conclusively known or understood about the disorder. The most obvious expression of <b>dysprosody</b> is when a person starts speaking in an accent which is not their own. Speaking in a foreign accent is only one type of <b>dysprosody,</b> as the disease can also manifest itself in other ways, such as changes in pitch, volume, and rhythm of speech. It is still very unclear as to how damage to the brain causes the disruption of prosodic function. The only form of effective treatment developed for <b>dysprosody</b> is speech therapy.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Dysprosody</b> is [...] "characterized by {{alterations}} in intensity, in {{the timing of}} utterance segments, and in rhythm, cadency, and intonation of words." [...] These differences cause a person to lose the characteristics of their particular individual speech. While the individual's personality, sensory comprehension, motor skills, and intelligence all remain intact, their grammar as well as vocal emotional capacity can be affected. Prosodic control is essential to speech delivery because it establishes vocal identity, since each individual’s voice has unique characteristics. There {{are two types of}} <b>dysprosody,</b> linguistic and emotional, that each present with slightly different symptoms. It is possible that one can present with both forms of <b>dysprosody.</b>|$|E
50|$|The most {{effective}} {{course of treatment}} for <b>dysprosody</b> has been speech therapy. The first step in therapy is practice drills which consist of repeating phrases using different prosodic contours, such as pitch, timing, and intonation. Typically a clinician will say either syllables, words, phrases, or nonsensical sentences with certain prosodic contours, and the patient repeats them with the same prosodic contours. Treatment following {{the lines of the}} principles of motor learning (PML) was found to improve the production of lexical stress contrasts. Once a patient is able to effectively complete this drill, they can start with more advanced forms of speech therapy. Upon completion of therapy, most people can identify prosodic cues in natural situations, such as normal conversation. Speech therapy has proven {{most effective}} for linguistic <b>dysprosody</b> because therapy for emotional <b>dysprosody</b> requires much more effort and is not always successful. One way that people learn to cope with emotional <b>dysprosody</b> is to explicitly state their emotions, rather than relying on prosodic cues.|$|E
50|$|Parkinson's disease, or {{sometimes}} referred to as PD, is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder that involves the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the brain. While common symptoms of PD are tremors, rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability, <b>dysprosody</b> is also a common issue in individuals diagnosed with PD. A common characteristic feature of <b>dysprosody</b> in Parkinson's is monopitch, or an inability to vary pitch when speaking.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Dysprosody</b> is {{the rarest}} {{neurological}} speech disorder. It {{is characterized by}} alterations in intensity, in the timing of utterance segments, and in rhythm, cadence, and intonation of words. The changes to the duration, the fundamental frequency, {{and the intensity of}} tonic and atonic syllables of the sentences spoken, deprive an individual's particular speech of its characteristics. The cause of <b>dysprosody</b> is usually associated with neurological pathologies such as brain vascular accidents, cranioencephalic traumatisms, and brain tumors.|$|E
50|$|In another {{reported}} case in 2004, a patient presented with <b>dysprosody</b> under interesting circumstances. The patient underwent surgery {{to correct a}} Reinke's edema, which originates in the vocal folds of the larynx. After the surgery, however, she began speaking in a foreign German accent. Neurological examinations were carried out on the patient through magnetic resonance imaging, but the results were completely normal. The only conclusion the doctors could make was that the surgery somehow changed the patient's vocal identification causing the new voice pattern. It was possible that the patient suffered a lack of oxygen to the brain during the surgery, which would have gone undetected by the resonance imaging, causing <b>dysprosody.</b> Although most causes of <b>dysprosody</b> are due to neurological damage, this case study shows {{that there can be}} other causes which are not necessarily neurologically based.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dysprosody,</b> {{which may}} {{manifest}} as pseudo-foreign accent syndrome, {{refers to a}} disorder in which {{one or more of}} the prosodic functions are either compromised or eliminated completely.|$|E
5000|$|Several {{studies have}} been {{performed}} investigating the link between Parkinson's and <b>dysprosody.</b> They have concluded that PD patients tend to struggle with specific areas of prosody; Parkinson's patients are less able to produce the loudness, pitch, and rhythm patterns required for expressing certain emotions, such as anger. In general, the voice modulations needed to express strong emotions are particularly difficult for PD patients. Abnormal pauses in speech are also a characteristic of Parkinsonian <b>dysprosody,</b> including both pauses in general speech and intra-word pauses. A decrease in speech rate can also be observed in Parkinson's patients.|$|E
50|$|There {{are also}} more {{involved}} diagnostic evaluations for which contain both productive and comprehensive parts. In the productive part, the patient is asked to say sentences with certain instructions. In the comprehension section, the patient is asked to listen to sentences being said and then answer questions about how they were stated.In order to determine linguistic <b>dysprosody,</b> a patient is asked to read sentences that can either be a statement or a question using both declarative and interrogative intonations. How the patient uses prosodic contours to distinguish between asking a question and saying a statement is recorded. During the comprehension section of the evaluation, a clinician reads simple sentences with either a declarative or interrogative intonation and the patient is asked to identify whether the sentence is a question or a statement. Evaluation of these two parts can determine if the patient has linguistic dysprosody.Emotional <b>dysprosody</b> can be diagnosed by having a patient state a neutral sentence with different emotions, such as happy, sad, and angry. Patients with <b>dysprosody</b> {{will not be able}} to convey the emotions very well or differentiate their speech between the different emotions significantly. During the comprehension part, a clinician will say a sentence with specific emotional intonations and the patient must indicate the correct emotion. These techniques ultimately allow for the diagnosis of <b>dysprosody</b> and the degree of its severity in the patient.|$|E
50|$|Scientists have {{attributed}} major {{control of}} the temporal aspects of prosody, including rhythm and timing, to the left hemisphere of the brain. On the other hand, pitch perception, such as singing and linguistics related to emotion, {{are believed to be}} organized in the right hemisphere. This belief {{led to the development of}} the “Functional Lateralization” hypothesis, stating that <b>dysprosody</b> can be caused by lesions in either the right or left hemispheres. It further states that the left is responsible for acoustic and temporal aspects of prosody, while the right is responsible for pitch and emotion. This hypothesis, however, has also been a cause for concern as studies have shown that people with left hemispheric damage exhibit prosodic deficiencies associated with the right hemisphere as defined by the functional lateralization hypothesis and vice versa. It has also been found that damage to the medulla, cerebellum, and basal ganglia may cause <b>dysprosody.</b> These conclusions have led scientists to believe that prosodic organization in the brain is extremely complex and cannot be attributed to hemispheric divisions alone. Although not well understood yet, studies to identify prosodic organization in the brain continue, primarily through the examination of damaged brain areas in patients suffering from <b>dysprosody</b> and their resulting vocal deficiencies. In addition, <b>dysprosody</b> has been associated with several other diseases, including Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, gelastic epilepsy (gelastic seizure), and behavioral disorders such as apathy, akinesia and aboulia. Understanding these disorders and the areas of the brain affected in each case is key in conducting further studies of <b>dysprosody.</b> Scientists are continuing to study these patients in the hope of creating more concrete connections between areas of brain damage and prosodic abnormalities, which will hopefully someday lead to a full understanding of prosodic organization in the brain.|$|E
50|$|Brain imaging studies {{related to}} speech {{functions}} have yielded {{insights into the}} subtle difference between aprosodia and <b>dysprosody.</b> The major differences in these result from functions which are characterized as belonging mainly {{to the left or}} right hemisphere. Several of the functions have been described as dominant and lateralized functions of the corresponding hemispheres, while some have been found to arise from communication between the two hemispheres. While the ability to express or be receptive to affective prosody is similar in <b>dysprosody</b> and aprosodia, {{a significant difference in the}} characterization of them is dominant vs. non-dominant hemispherical damage.|$|E
50|$|Emotional <b>dysprosody</b> {{deals with}} a person's ability to express {{emotions}} through their speech {{as well as their}} ability to understand emotion in someone else's speech. Whenever we speak, whether we realize it or not, there are nonverbal aspects of our speech that reveal information about our feelings and attitude. There has been strong evidence that <b>dysprosody</b> does affect the ability to express emotion, however the severity may vary depending on what part of the brain has been damaged. Studies have shown that the ability to express emotional information is dependent on motor, perceptual, and neurobehavioral functions all working together in a specific way. A person suffering from <b>dysprosody</b> {{would not be able to}} accurately convey emotion vocally, such as through pitch or melody, or make any conclusion about another person's feeling through his speech. Regardless of the inability to vocally express feeling through prosodic controls, emotions are still formed and felt by the individual. Since there are many different factors which contribute to emotional understanding of speech, it makes it much more complicated to understand.|$|E
50|$|Studies {{have also}} shown a {{progression}} of <b>dysprosody</b> {{in patients with}} PD over time. Abnormalities in speech rate, pauses, and variation range in speech become worse as the disease progresses. It {{is important to note}} the degradation of prosody in PD over time is independent of motor control issues, and is thus separate from those aspects of the disease. Studies have shown that normal treatment for PD can help with the <b>dysprosody</b> symptoms, however there is usually an improvement in pitch control only and not in the volume and emotional aspects of the disease. These treatments include medications such as L-DOPA as well as electrophysiological treatments.|$|E
50|$|Several {{psychiatric}} conditions, such as autism spectrum disorder, clinical depression, and schizophrenia {{are characterized}} by distinctive prosodic patterns. Several studies found an atypical neural processing of expressive <b>dysprosody</b> in individuals diagnosed {{with one of the}} autism spectrum disorders.|$|E
50|$|The first {{documented}} {{occurrence of}} <b>dysprosody</b> {{was described by}} Pierre Marie, a French neurologist, in 1907. Marie described {{the case of a}} Frenchman who started speaking in an Alsatian accent after suffering from a cerebrovascular accident which caused right hemiplegia.|$|E
50|$|When {{studies of}} <b>dysprosody</b> first began, {{diagnosis}} involved an untrained ear determining impairments in the prosodic elements. However, {{over time and}} as <b>dysprosody</b> has been studied more closely, a more concrete method of diagnosis has been developed. One diagnosis technique is a rating scale, such as the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination. The exam is a subjective rating system of volume (from loud to normal to soft), voice (from normal to whisper to hoarse), speech rate (from fast to normal to slow) and intonation which is rated {{on a scale from}} 1-7. One indicates no sentence intonation, four is given when sentence intonation is limited to abrupt pauses, and seven indicates normal intonation.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dysprosody</b> is an {{impairment}} in the prosodic {{elements such as}} rhythm, timing, melody, stress, pitch and intonation. It primarily results from neurological damage that {{can be caused by}} tumors, stroke, or severe head injury. There have been several hypotheses proposed discussing the area of the brain responsible for prosodic control, but since prosodic elements are so diverse, its organization in the brain is still unclear. There are different types of <b>dysprosody,</b> including linguistic and emotional, which present different symptoms. The only course of treatment proven to be effective is speech therapy, although normal speech may naturally resume. Currently, there has been more research regarding dysprosody's link to other diseases, in particular Parkinson's disease, but also Huntington's disease, and gelastic epilepsy to name a few.|$|E
50|$|There {{can also}} be some {{emotional}} and mental side effects to <b>dysprosody.</b> Each individual has a distinct voice characterized by all the prosodic elements. Once a person loses control of the timing, pitch, melody, etc. of his speech, he can also {{feel a sense of}} loss of personal identity, which can sometimes lead to depression.|$|E
50|$|Interestingly, lesions {{exclusively}} to Broca's area (the {{foot of the}} inferior frontal gyrus) do not produce Broca's aphasia, but instead mild <b>dysprosody</b> and agraphia,sometimes accompanied by word-finding pauses and mild dysarthria. Not much is known about what other areas must be damaged {{in order to produce}} Broca's aphasia, but some maintain damage to the inferior preorlandic motor strip (the motor cortex region responsible glossopharyngeal muscle control) is also necessary.|$|E
50|$|Since the {{discovery}} of <b>dysprosody,</b> scientists have been attempting to declare a particular {{area of the brain}} responsible for prosodic control. It was long believed that the right hemisphere of the brain was responsible for prosodic organization, ultimately leading to a grossly oversimplified hemispheric model. This model argued that the organization of language, centered in the left hemisphere, parallels the organization of prosody in the right hemisphere. Since its release, however, very few studies have given the model any substantial support.|$|E
50|$|The next {{documented}} {{report of}} <b>dysprosody</b> occurred in 1919 by Arnold Pick, a German neurologist. He noticed a 29-year-old Czechoslovakian had started {{speaking in a}} Polish accent following a stroke. Pick's patient also suffered from right hemiparesis, a lesser version of hemiplegia, and aphasia after the stroke. Pick noticed {{that not only was}} the accent altered, but the timing of the speech was slower, and the patient spoke with uncharacteristic grammatical mistakes. Pick later wanted to follow up on his research but was not able to, since the patient had died with no autopsy performed.|$|E
5000|$|Monrad-Krohn was {{interested}} in various language disorders, in particular <b>dysprosody,</b> and he introduced the term aprosody to that field. [...] He wrote a book entitled 'The Clinical Examination of the Nervous System', of which seven editions were reproduced as texts to be read {{in the study of}} the area. These are now considered antiquarian, and are collectors' items. He was also particularly interested in reflexes. His 1918 thesis was based on observations of abdominal reflexes. In 1922 he undertook a major study of facial reflexes in patients with leprosy, and the paralysis displayed by them. The facial mimicry displayed by them despite their paralysis, termed [...] "paradoxical emotional hypermimia" [...] was given the name [...] "Monrad-Krohn Sign".|$|E
50|$|The most well {{documented}} account of <b>dysprosody</b> was in 1943 by G. H. Monrad-Krohn. A woman, Astrid L., in Norway {{was hit with}} a shell fragment during an air raid in 1941 through her left frontal bone, leaving her brain exposed. She was unconscious for four days and when she regained consciousness at the hospital, she was hemiplegic on her right side, was suffering from seizures, and was aphasic. Initially she could only speak in monosyllables, yes and no, but then started to form sentences. When first starting to speak again, she also spoke with uncharacteristic grammatical errors, but over time they became much less pronounced and eventually she gained back full fluency of speech. However, she sounded as though she was speaking her native Norwegian with a German accent. It was two years later that she was admitted to the Neurological University Clinic in Oslo, Norway and seen by Dr. Monrad-Krohn. Krohn examined the patient and noted that there was no noticeable difference in her fluency, motor functions, sensory functions, or coordination. Upon examination of her skull, he found a large scar on the left fronto-temporo-parietal region. This was not as helpful as Krohn would have liked. Since the scar was so extensive, it was impossible for Krohn to pinpoint the exact region of the brain which was causing this altered speech. Krohn then ran tests on Astrid to assess her language comprehension. He found that in addition to her altered speech patterns, she had trouble finding the Norwegian words for trivial objects, such as light switch and match box. She also had to repeat the examiner's questions aloud before answering, had to say words out loud to herself before writing them down, and had difficulty comprehending written instructions. Krohn could not understand how she had acquired a foreign accent; it could not be attributed to any known disorder or disease. For those who suffer from this type of <b>dysprosody,</b> {{it is interesting to note}} that sometimes the accents they speak are from countries to which the person has never been. This fact is very puzzling for neuroscientists, since dialects and accents are considered to be an acquired behavior of learning pitches, intonations and stress patterns.|$|E
40|$|Research {{carried out}} in the last two decennia has shown that right brain damage could disturb the {{production}} and reception of suprasegmentals. Dextrals with right hemispheric lesions may find it difficult to intone speech and/or to discriminate between various intonations or accentuations. However, right brain damage does not invariably entail some kind of <b>dysprosody.</b> Detailed investigation of a righthanded male with right temporo-parietal excision failed to uncover any prosodic deficit. Moreover, critical review of the positive cases reported so far indicates that <b>dysprosody,</b> when it occurs following injury to the right hemisphere, results from a neuro-motor deficit or from disturbed auditory discrimination. As a consequence, it cannot be considered a specific language disturbance. Moreover, <b>dysprosody</b> may also result from damage to the left hemisphere in dextrals. Accordingly, there is little evidence to support a recent claim that the right hemisphere is dominant for affective prosody {{in much the same way}} as the left hemisphere is dominant for propositional speech. © 1985 The International Christian University Language Sciences Summer Institute.

40|$|Key {{features}} of apraxia of speech (AOS) include phoneme distortions and <b>dysprosody.</b> Descriptions of <b>dysprosody</b> {{have focused on}} lexical stress, specifically equalization of stress across syllables within words. However, lexical stress is a feature of stress-timed languages such as English but not syllable-timed languages such as French. This study aimed to make an acoustic comparison of lexical stress production in healthy and apraxic speakers of Australian English or French to ask whether measures of lexical stress are useful for AOS diagnosis cross-linguistically. Eight French (four AOS speakers and four control participants) and 18 Australian English (nine AOS speakers and nine control participants) speakers were recorded repeating 40 two and three syllable words that, in English, receive first or second syllable stress. All words occurred in both languages (e. g., habitat). The pairwise variability index (PVI) of vowel duration was used to quantify degree of variation across syllables within words. For {{each of the four}} word types, the AOS groups had lower PVI values than the control participants. Overall, AOS speakers had mean PVI values closer to zero than the control participants.

40|$|Much of {{the recent}} {{emphasis}} on prosody (the melody and rhythm of speech) and its disorders (<b>dysprosody)</b> has been on cognitive-affective functions attributed to cortical areas of the right cerebral hemisphere, with little further behavioral or neuroanatomical specification. This focus is in-appropriately narrow both {{from the perspectives of}} neuropathogenesis and neurobehavioral phenomenology, and it is based on a limited view of prosody. Current models of brain organization for prosody propose lateralized rep-resentation based on functional (affective vs. linguistic) or featural (timing vs. pitch) properties of prosodic material. However, a role for subcortical structures in prosody is being increasingly described, and prosodic func-tions are now known to span a broad range in communication.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{physiological}} impairments secondary to Parkinson’s Disease (PD) negatively impact speech production. Individuals with PD display vocal, prosodic, resonant, and articulatory abnormalities which reduce communicative effectiveness. Prosody is a broad term which refers to the alterations in pitch, duration, and loudness used by speakers to convey important linguistic and paralinguistic information during speech. Little is known about the prosodic abnormalities associated with PD relative to healthy older adults; however, it {{is well known}} that individuals with PD display impairments in their ability to modulate the acoustic cues (pitch, duration, intensity) associated with prosodic inflection in speech. Literature presently lacks sufficient evidence to support treatment paradigms commonly used to address <b>dysprosody</b> in PD. Thus, there is a significant need to develop and investigate potential evidence-based treatment paradigms for <b>dysprosody</b> associated with PD. ^ The present study aimed to examine the potential treatment effects the SpeechVive device has on treating <b>dysprosody</b> in PD. Acoustic recordings were obtained from 15 individuals with PD during a reading task. Participants read the passage at the start of the study and 12 weeks later, after wearing the SpeechVive device for the intervening weeks. Main outcome measures examined productions of contrastive stress, intonation contours, rate, and patterns of pausing. The results revealed that participants increased vocal intensity levels during the production of stressed words and improved standard deviation of pitch during the productions of intonation contours. Lastly, the device was found to improve participants’ abilities to pause relative to syntactic boundaries. ...|$|E
