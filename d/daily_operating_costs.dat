Prior work proposes using energy stor-age devices to reduce these costs by periodically releasing energy to lower the electric gridâs peak demand.

40|$|Unlike {{conventional}} vehicles {{propelled by}} {{internal combustion engine}} (ICE), an electric vehicle (EV) is powered by an electric motor with rechargeable battery packs. EVs can offer significant potential for increasing energy efficiency in transportation, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and relieving reliance on foreign oil import. In addition, the large-scale adoption of EVs presents an opportunity to provide electric energy storage (EES) -based ancillary services for ensuring grid-wide frequency stability by smoothing the natural intermittency of renewable energy sources (RES). However, the charging of EVs would {{have an impact on}} the distribution grid because they consume a large amount of electrical energy and this demand of electrical power can lead to additional, large and undesirable peaks in the electrical power consumption. Many simulation-based studies have suggested that, if no regulation on EV charging is implemented, even a 10 % penetration of EVs may cause unacceptable impacts on the grid. Among a variety of EV charging strategies, the decentralized âvalley-fillingâ approach, which is the most popularly researched, have been shown to be the most versatile for a given daily load profile prediction in that it achieves the maximum load factor and minimizes the <b>daily</b> <b>operating</b> <b>costs</b> of utilities simultaneously. However, the decentralized valley-filling charging strategy has a number of technical limitations that can be resolved by applying the techniques for real-time systems where the satisfaction of timing constraints are as important as the correctness of system outputs.

40|$|Executive Summary In {{every home}} {{irrespective}} of its size, location, age, or efficiency, {{heat in the}} form of drainwater or dryer exhaust is wasted. Although from a waste stream, this energy has the potential for being captured, possibly stored, and then reused for preheating hot water or air thereby saving operating costs to the homeowner. In applications such as a shower and possibly a dryer, waste heat is produced {{at the same time as}} energy is used, so that a heat exchanger to capture the waste energy and return it to the supply is all that is needed. In other applications such as capturing the energy in drainwater from a tub, dishwasher, or washing machine, the availability of waste heat might not coincide with an immediate use for energy, and consequently a heat exchanger system with heat storage capacity (i. e. a regenerator) would be necessary. This study describes a two-house experimental evaluation of a system designed to capture waste heat from the shower, dishwasher clothes washer and dryer, and to use this waste heat to offset some of the hot water energy needs of the house. Although each house was unoccupied, they were fitted with equipment that would completely simulate the heat loads and behavior of human occupants including operating the appliances and fixtures on a demand schedule identical to Building American protocol (Hendron, 2009). The heat recovery system combined (1) a gravity-film heat exchanger (GFX) installed in a vertical section of drainline, (2) a heat exchanger for capturing dryer exhaust heat, (3) a preheat tank for storing the captured heat, and (4) a small recirculation pump and controls, so that the system could be operated anytime that waste heat from the shower, dishwasher, clothes washer and dryer, and in any combination was produced. The study found capturing energy from the dishwasher and clothes washer to be a challenge since those two appliances dump waste water over a short time interval. Controls based on the status of the dump valve on these two appliances would have eliminated uncertainty in knowing when waste water was flowing and the recovery system operated. The study also suggested that capture of dryer exhaust heat to heat incoming air to the dryer should be examined as an alternative to using drying exhaust energy for water heating. The study found that over a 6 -week test period, the system in each house was able to recover on average approximately 3000 W-h of waste heat daily from these appliance and showers with slightly less on simulated weekdays and slightly more on simulated weekends which were heavy wash/dry days. Most of these energy savings were due to the shower/GFX operation, and the least savings were for the dishwasher/GFX operation. Overall, the value of the 3000 W-h of displaced energy would have been $ 0. 27 /day based on an electricity price of $. 09 /kWh. Although small for today s convention house, these savings are significant for a home designed to approach maximum affordable efficiency where <b>daily</b> <b>operating</b> <b>costs</b> for the whole house are less than a dollar per day.

The proposed EMS is for grid connected microgrid consisting of solar PV plant, battery energy storage system (BESS) and fuel cell. In this work, a novel ramp-rate control strategy is proposed where the energy storage is used to control the ramp-rate of PV output power within the desirable level. In addition, a novel âmix-modeâ operating strategy is proposed to reduce the microgridâs <b>daily</b> <b>operating</b> <b>cost.</b> The objective functions in the proposed strategies are solved using linear programming and mixed integer linear programming.

40|$|AbstractSafety, security, and {{sustainability}} of energy supply chains {{are among the}} main concerns of industrialized countries, and, therefore, distributed generation has significantly increased {{its share of the}} energy market, thanks to the possibility to simultaneously meet electrical, thermal and cooling demand, thus increasing the overall source-to-final-use conversion efficiency. The efficiency of a distributed generation system is influenced both by the individual performance of the plant components as well as by their interconnection, and is very sensitive to the control strategy adopted in the different plant sections. This last remark is particularly relevant for distributed generation systems, that are subject to rapid gradients in both the thermal and electrical loads, and in the values of the energy vector. In this respect, the introduction and the correct management of energy storage systems is a key point for trigeneration plants. In fact, energy storage brings on the one side advantages as for the reduced components sizes, but more importantly allows for a substantial decoupling of the thermal and electrical demands, making load following less of a stringent requirement. An optimization methodology, based on energy fluxes simulation, and on the application of the graph theory as in previous works by some of the authors, is used to identify the optimal set-points for each component. The optimization algorithm searches for the plant management envelope that minimizes a prescribed objective function. Specifically, two different optimization criteria are considered: i) economic optimization that minimizes the total <b>daily</b> <b>operating</b> <b>cost</b> and ii) primary energy use optimization, that minimizes the total daily amount of primary energy used by the plant.

40|$|Distributed {{generation}} is attracting more attention {{as a viable}} alternative to large centralized generation plants, driven by the rapidly evolving liberalization and deregulation environments. This interest is also motivated by the need for eliminating the unnecessary transmission and distribution costs, reducing the greenhouse gas emissions, deferring capital costs and improving the availability and reliability of electrical networks. Therefore, distributed {{generation is}} expected to play an increasingly important role in meeting future power generation requirements and to provide consumers with flexible and cost effective solutions for many of their energy needs. However, the integration of these sources into the electrical networks can cause some challenges regarding their expected impacts on the security and the dynamic behaviour of the entire network. It is essential to study these issues and to analyze the performance of the expected future systems to ensure satisfactory operation and to maximize the benefits of utilizing the distributed resources. The thesis focuses on some topics related to the dynamic simulation and operation of distributed generating units, specifically fuel cells and micro-turbines. The objective of this dissertation is to put emphasis on the following aspects: Dynamic modelling of fuel cells: Analyzing electrical power systems requires suitable dynamic models for all components forming the system. Since fuel cell units represent new promising sources, the research ascribes special consideration to developing models that describe their dynamic behaviour. It is envisaged to develop a simple and flexible model for stability studies and controller-design purposes in addition to an exhaustive nonparametric model for detailed analysis of the fuel cells. Simulation {{of a large number of}} DG units incorporated into a multi-machine network: With large numbers of distributed sources, it is expected that decentralized generation impacts the dynamic behaviour of the high voltage network. Therefore, it is intended to investigate the case, where several fuel cells and micro-turbines are integrated into the distribution system of a multi-machine network. This can help in studying the operation of the entire network and highlighting the mutual impact of the high-voltage and low-voltage networks on each other. Dynamic modelling and simulation of hybrid fuel cell/micro-turbine units: The hybrid configuration of fuel cells and micro-turbines exhibits many advantages enabling this technology to represent a considerable percentage of the next advanced power generation systems. The dynamic performance of such units, however, is still not fully understood. Hence, it is desirable for understanding their behaviour to highlight the dynamic interdependencies between the fuel cell and the micro-turbine, the overall system transient performance, and the dynamic control requirements. Dynamic equivalents of distribution power networks: The need for fast and simplified analysis of interconnected power networks obligates developing robust dynamic equivalents for certain electrical power subsystems. Nonparametric dynamic equivalents will avoid the identification of complicated mathematical models, which would adequately reflect the performance of the replaced network under various operating conditions. For distribution systems, the equivalent model has to take into consideration the characteristics of distributed generating units which are mostly connected to the network through inverters and in some cases their operating principles are not based on the electromechanical energy conversion mechanism. Impact of distributed generation on the stability of power systems: The existence of distributed sources with large numbers can impact the stability of the power system considerably. Angle-stability, frequency stability as well as voltage stability can be affected when the power from these units increases. It is essential to study this impact to ensure secure operation of the power system. Therefore, it is envisaged to study the performance of a hypothetical network and to demonstrate different stability classes at different penetration levels of the distributed generating units. Online management of fuel cells and micro-turbines for residential applications: The optimal management of the power in distributed generation for residential applications can significantly reduce the <b>operating</b> <b>cost</b> and contribute towards improving their economic feasibility. The management process, however, has to be accomplished in the online mode and to account for all decision variables that affect the setting values. Therefore, it is aimed to develop an online intelligent strategy to manage the power generated in fuel cells and micro-turbines when used to supply residential loads in order to minimize the <b>daily</b> <b>operating</b> <b>cost</b> and achieve an overall reduction in the electricity price...|$|R

The following range of variables is examined: (1) project life from 2 to 30 years; (2) interest rate from 0 to 15 percent per year; and (3) <b>operating</b> <b>cost</b> gradient from 5 to 90 percent of the initial <b>operating</b> <b>costs.</b> A numerical example plus tables and graphs is given to help calculate project life cycle costs over a wide range of variables...|$|R
3000|$|TablesÂ  8, 9 and 10 {{show that}} with the {{increase}} of the robustness budget Î (Î [...] c, Î [...] h [...] and Î [...] nl [...]), the <b>operating</b> <b>cost</b> of the robust case increases. When Î [...] c [...] is adjusted from 0 to 1 (Î [...] h [...] = 1 and Î [...] nl [...] = 2), the <b>operating</b> <b>cost</b> increases by 2.33 %. When Î [...] h [...] is adjusted from 0 to 1 (Î [...] c [...] = 1 and Î [...] nl [...] = 2), the <b>operating</b> <b>cost</b> increases by 0.07 %. When Î [...] nl [...] is adjusted from 0 to 2 (Î [...] c [...] = 1 and Î [...] h [...] = 1), the <b>operating</b> <b>cost</b> increases by 5.94 %. The differences in the <b>operating</b> <b>cost</b> show that the fluctuation of net electrical load has the more significantly effect on the <b>operating</b> <b>cost</b> of the CCHP microgrid than the fluctuation of the cooling or thermal.|$|R
