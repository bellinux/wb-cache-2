5|$|The {{provenance}} of {{the manuscript}} before the seventeenth century is unclear. From a signature on the flyleaf we <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> in van Vliet's collection in 1659. It was auctioned in 1666, after his death, and probably was purchased by Franciscus Junius, from whose library {{it came to the}} Bodleian as part of the Junius donation (Holt 1878, pp. liv–lvi).|$|E
5|$|Two Israeli sappers {{were sent}} to mine {{the area of the}} {{quarantine}} station, but did not <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> already under Syrian control. Their vehicle was blown up, but they managed to escape alive. On the same day, the Syrian company that attacked the water station from Tel ad-Dweir proceeded towards Sha'ar HaGolan and Masada. Its advance was halted by the village residents as well as a platoon of reinforcements armed with 20 mm cannons. The company retreated to its position and commenced artillery fire on the two kibbutzim.|$|E
5|$|The Countess sends Sandor {{to fetch}} her {{a model to}} paint; he returns with Lili (Nan Grey). Countess Zaleska {{initially}} resists her urges but succumbs and attacks her. Lili survives the attack and is examined by Dr. Garth through hypnosis; she reveals enough information to let Dr. Garth <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> Countess Zaleska that attacked her, but suffers heart failure and dies. The Countess gives up fighting her urges and accepts that a cure is not possible; she lures Dr. Garth him to Transylvania by kidnapping Janet (Marguerite Churchill), his secretary, whom he has a playfully antagonistic relationship with, but now realizes that he cares for her. Zaleska intends to transform Dr. Garth into a vampire to be her eternal companion. Arriving at Castle Dracula in Transylvania, Dr. Garth agrees to exchange his life for Janet's. Before he can be transformed, Countess Zaleska is destroyed when Sandor shoots her through the heart with an arrow as revenge for her breaking her promise to make him immortal. He takes aim at Dr. Garth but is shot dead by a Scotland Yard policeman who, along with Von Helsing, have followed Dr. Garth from London.|$|E

On enquiry, he came <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not uncommon to kill girls {{in such a manner}} in kulin (orthodox upper caste) Brahmin families. He was so shocked that he vowed not to go in for polygamous marriage, a system in vogue in orthodox upper caste society in those days.|$|E

From the diary of Erik XIV, {{it is known that}} Abraham Stenbock and Ivar Ivarsson were sentenced to death right away, and that on 14 May the court let Erik <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> willing to also sentence Svante Sture to death. According to Peterson, Erik Sture was sentenced to death, too. All prisoners were then sent to Uppsala Castle for further investigation.|$|E

25|$|This {{consists}} of an India-rubber contrivance which the female easily adjusts in the vagina before copulation, and which spreads a thin tissue of rubber before {{the mouth of the}} womb so as to prevent the seminal aura from entering. … Conception cannot possibly take place when it is used. The full enjoyment of the conjugal embrace can be indulged in during coition. The husband would hardly be likely to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> being used, unless told by the wife. … It places conception entirely {{under the control of the}} wife, to whom it naturally belongs; for it is for her to say at what time and under what circumstances, she will become the mother, and the moral, religious, and physical instructress of offspring.|$|E
25|$|The {{boat was}} located and {{excavated}} at Hasholme, {{on the north}} bank of the River Foulness in the broad river channel. The boat was situated in mostly waterlogged clay (silty-clay, silt, and sand) deposits, which greatly helped {{the preservation of the}} timbers. Apart from the boat itself, the excavations did not produce any major associated artifacts, {{with the exception of a}} single pottery shard. For dating purposes two techniques, tree-ring dating and radiocarbon 14C/thermoluminescence, were employed. Both methods gave rather comparable results of some time between 750 and 390 BC, which approximately correlates with the later European Iron Age. Based on reconstruction of the landscape around the site, we <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> dominated by mixed oak, birch, and alder woodland, with some meadows and marshes, as well as many river tributaries and oxbow lakes.|$|E

Wick and Lonnie Trumbull, both 20, were bludgeoned with a {{piece of}} lumber as they slept in their {{basement}} apartment in Seattle's Queen Anne Hill district on June 23, 1966 near the Safeway store where Bundy worked at the time, and where the women regularly shopped. Trumbull died. In retrospect, Keppel noted many similarities to the Chi Omega crime scene. Wick, who suffered permanent memory loss {{as a result of the}} attack, later contacted Ann Rule: [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> Ted Bundy who did that to us," [...] she wrote, [...] "but I can't tell you how I know." [...] In the absence of incriminating evidence, Bundy's involvement remains speculative.|$|E

[...] While visiting with Ono in March 1974, McCartney, on leaving, asked [...] "hat will make you come back to John?" [...] McCartney subsequently passed her response to Lennon while visiting him in Los Angeles. [...] "John often said he didn't understand why Paul did this for us, but he did." [...] In 2012, McCartney revealed that he did not blame Ono for the breakup of the Beatles and credited Ono with inspiring much of Lennon's post-Beatles work.|$|E
500|$|Labyrinth {{has become}} a cult film. Brian Henson remembered his father Jim Henson as being aware that Labyrinth and The Dark Crystal both had cult followings {{by the time of}} his death in 1990, saying, [...] "he was able to see all that and <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> appreciated." [...] Academic Andrea Wright wrote that Labyrinth has managed to {{maintain}} audience popularity long after its initial release to a greater extent than The Dark Crystal. Since 1997, an annual two-day masquerade ball called the [...] "Labyrinth of Jareth" [...] where revelers come dressed in costumes inspired by the film has been held in Hollywood. Labyrinth has a significant Internet fan following, and as of September 1, 2015, Fanfiction.net hosts over 8,900 stories in its Labyrinth section.|$|E
500|$|There {{were also}} reports that MGM had {{retained}} {{a copy of}} the original version. Iris Barry of the Museum of Modern Art claimed that a copy was locked in the MGM vaults, although Thalberg denied it. It was also reported that John Houseman had a private screening at MGM and that MGM owned two copies stored in a vault in a Utah salt mine. Lotte Eisner once claimed that in the 1950s and 1960s, several cans of films labeled [...] "McTeague" [...] were found in MGM's vaults and destroyed by executives who did not <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> footage from Greed. MGM executive Al Lewin said that several years after the film's release Stroheim asked him for the cut footage.

500|$|Pulvermacher {{patented}} {{the chain}} battery in the US in 1853. [...] This was soon {{followed by the}} wearable chain battery belt, or electric belt. [...] Electric belts became enormously popular in the US, far {{more so than in}} Europe. [...] This led to the company headquarters being moved to Cincinnati by the 1880s as the Pulvermacher Galvanic Company, but still calling themselves Pulvermacher's of London for the prestige of a European connection. [...] Early models had to be soaked in vinegar before use as in England, but later on models that worked purely by galvanic action with body sweat were introduced. [...] Since the device was being sold essentially as a quack cure it was only necessary to generate enough electricity that the wearer could feel it, no matter how slightly, and <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> working.|$|E
500|$|... "Burn" [...] was {{considered}} a [...] "window to Usher's inner thoughts", along with the controversial track [...] "Confessions" [...] and [...] "Confessions Part II". The song is about breakups and ending relationships. According to Matt Cibula of Popmatters, [...] "Burn" [...] is constructed from [...] "two-step concept". In the lyrics [...] "You know that it's over / You <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> through / Let it burn / Got to let it burn", Usher breaks up with his woman but found her sad about feeling bad {{about what happened to}} their relationship. However, Usher says that she must deal with it before she can accept the truth. For the lines [...] "It's been fifty-eleven days / Umpteen hours / I'm gonna be burnin' / Till you return", the direction changes after Usher realized that breaking up with her was a huge mistake and that he wanted her back.|$|E
500|$|Casting {{director}} Rick Millikan was {{tasked with}} finding a suitable actor {{to play the}} part of the beggar. Millikan's only instructions were to look for [...] "a small all-Indian man with no legs." [...] Eventually, Gurdeep Roy, better known as Deep Roy was chosen to play the part. Deep Roy was a noted stunt man who had notably played Droopy McCool of the Max Rebo Band in Return of the Jedi. Deep Roy, however, is not an amputee and so a cart with a false bottom was created. Anytime there was a scene where the beggar had to move, blue screen technology was used to add the background in during post-production. The cart featured a distinct [...] "squeak" [...] that Paul Rabwin described as [...] "creepy". He noted, [...] "There was a squeak that had to let us <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> him. It had to scare us [...] Finally we came up with what we thought was just the right squeak and John [...] said 'Okay, that's the one.'" ...|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "The Only Exception" [...] was {{generally}} well received by music critics. Kyle Anderson, {{a writer for}} MTV, commented that the music video is [...] "by far the most visually interesting and complex clip the group has ever produced." [...] Anderson further stated that [...] "despite {{the complexity of the}} video, the whole process was remarkably efficient". She remarked that based on the video's outcome that it was [...] "a little bit surprising" [...] to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> directed by a first-time director. Mike Sheffield of Spin viewed the music video as a [...] "love story" [...] and described it as being [...] "Valentine's Day + epic Emo balladry = Paramore's brand new video for 'The Only Exception'". Chesbro said that he was happy with the final product of the music video and that directing the video made him become more interested in directing videos, saying, [...] "I'd really like to do more videos now [...] This video turned out so perfect that I'm worried nothing else will turn out as good. But if this is my only video, I was super-proud {{to be a part of}} it." ...|$|E
500|$|Henry Johnson survives, however, {{under the}} watchful eye of Dr. Trescott, who treats the injured man out of {{gratitude}} for saving his son's life. [...] Hagenthorpe, a leading figure in town, urges Trescott to let Henry die, stating that he [...] "will hereafter be a monster, a perfect monster, and probably with an affected brain. No man can observe you as I have observed you and not <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a matter of conscience with you, but I am afraid, my friend, that it is one of the blunders of virtue." [...] Ultimately Trescott decides to move Henry, who has sustained disfiguring injuries to his face and psyche, to a local negro household, but Henry's presence proves troubling for the family's well-being, and he is moved to another. [...] One night Henry absconds, visiting various people around town and leaving terrified neighbors in his wake, including Bella Farragut, who he attempts to court as if no time has passed since they last met. [...] Not welcome anywhere else, Henry is eventually moved to the carriage-house in the newly built Trescott home. [...] Despite Dr. Trescott's protection, Henry is branded a monster by the townspeople, who avoid the Trescotts as a result. [...] Although previously Henry's friend, Jimmie now mocks him, daring his friends to approach the disfigured man. [...] Once the leading doctor in Whilomville, Trescott's reputation suffers greatly, as does that of his wife, who no longer receives visitors.|$|E
500|$|In 1996, Gore became {{involved}} in a finance controversy over his attendance at an event at the Buddhist Hsi Lai Temple in Hacienda Heights, California. In an interview on NBC's Today the following year, Gore said, [...] "I did not <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a fund-raiser. I {{knew it was a}} political event, and I knew there were finance people that were going to be present, and so that alone should have told me, 'This is inappropriate and this is a mistake; don't do this.' And I take responsibility for that. It was a mistake." [...] In March 1997, Gore had to explain phone calls which he made to solicit funds for Democratic Party for the 1996 election. In a news conference, Gore stated that, [...] "all calls that I made were charged to the Democratic National Committee. I was advised {{there was nothing wrong with}} that. My counsel tells me there is no controlling legal authority that says that is any violation of any law." [...] The phrase [...] "no controlling legal authority" [...] was criticized by columnist Charles Krauthammer, who stated: [...] "Whatever other legacies Al Gore leaves behind between now and retirement, he forever bequeaths this newest weasel word to the lexicon of American political corruption." [...] Robert Conrad Jr. was the head of a Justice Department task force appointed by Attorney General Janet Reno to investigate Gore's fund-raising controversies. In Spring 2000, Conrad asked Reno to appoint an independent counsel to continue the investigation. After looking into the matter, Reno judged that the appointment of an independent counsel was unwarranted.|$|E
