40|$|Background The {{removal of}} well-fixed {{acetabular}} components following THA (total hip arthroplasty) {{is a difficult}} operation and could be accompanied {{by the loss of}} acetabular bone stock. The optimal method for fixation is still under debate. The aim of this pilot study was to compare the tear-out resistance and failure behavior between osseo-integrated and non-integrated screw cups. Furthermore, we examined whether there are differences in the properties mentioned between <b>screw</b> <b>sockets</b> and cemented polyethylene cups. Hypothesis Tear-out resistance and related mechanical work required for the tear-out of osseo-integrated <b>screw</b> <b>sockets</b> are higher than in non-integrated <b>screw</b> <b>sockets.</b> Patients and methods Ten human coxal bones from six cadavers with osseo-integrated <b>screw</b> <b>sockets</b> (n = 4), non-integrated (implanted post-mortem, n = 3) <b>screw</b> <b>sockets</b> and cemented polyethylene cups (n = 3) were used for tear-out testing. The parameters axial failure load and mechanical work for tear-out were introduced as measures for determining the stability of acetabular components following THA. Results The osseo-integrated <b>screw</b> <b>sockets</b> yielded slightly higher tear-out resistance (1. 61 ± 0. 26 kN) and related mechanical work compared to the non-integrated <b>screw</b> <b>sockets</b> (1. 23 ± 0. 39 kN, P = 0. 4). The cemented polyethylene cups yielded the lowest tear-out resistance with a failure load of 1. 18 ± 0. 24 kN. Compared to the screw cups implanted while alive, they also differ on a non-significant level (P = 0. 1). Osseous failure patterns differed especially <b>for</b> the <b>screw</b> <b>sockets</b> compared to the cemented polyethylene cups. Discussion Osseo-integration did not greatly influence the tear-out stability in cementless <b>screw</b> <b>sockets</b> following axial loading. Furthermore, the strength of the bone-implant-interface of cementless <b>screw</b> <b>sockets</b> appears to be similar to cemented polyethylene cups. However, given the high failure load, high mechanical load and because of the related bone failure patterns, removal should not be performed by means of tear-out but rather by osteotomes or other curved cutting devices to preserve the acetabular bone stock...|$|R

5000|$|Hex <b>socket</b> <b>screw</b> {{heads are}} usually made by {{stamping}} {{the head with}} a die, plastically deforming the metal. Other ways to generate the hex socket include linear broaching and rotary broaching. Broaching the heads with a linear broach is essentially the metalworking analog of mortising wood with a mortising machine; a hole is drilled and then the corners are broached out. This operation often leaves little telltale curled chips still attached {{at the bottom of the}} socket. These are negligible for most applications.|$|R
