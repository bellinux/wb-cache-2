25|$|In {{the last}} decades of her life, the {{telephone}} became her only means of communication with the outside world, <b>even</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> children and close friends. She often talked up to six or seven hours {{a day on the}} phone, but she hardly spent any time with anyone in person in her final years. A documentary, Calling Hedy Lamarr, was released in 2004 and featured her children, Anthony Loder and Denise Loder-DeLuca.|$|E
25|$|On one hand, Enăchiuc's {{proposition}} can {{be criticized}} for {{the method of}} transliteration. Symbols that characteristically appear in the same context throughout the codex are regularly transliterated with different letters, so that the patterns in the original code are lost in the transliteration. On the other hand, Enăchiuc is criticized as a linguist and historian. She provided the only linguistic source of a hitherto unknown state of the Romanian language, and her text (<b>even</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> glossary) raises so serious doubts both in its linguistic and historic authenticity that they render her work unscientific.|$|E
500|$|<b>Even</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> {{influence}} upon {{future generations}} of feminist artists, Nevelson's opinion of discrimination within the art world bordered {{on the belief that}} artists who were not gaining success based on gender suffered from a lack of confidence. When asked by Feminist Art Journal if she suffered from sexism within the art world, Nevelson replied [...] "I am a woman's liberation." ...|$|E
50|$|That <b>evening,</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> back {{broken and}} her keel forced {{up through the}} engine room, the ship bilged. Fortunately, she {{suffered}} no personnel casualties.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I hope so,' {{and with}} a hearty kiss, Kitty went thoughtfully downstairs to meet several little friends whom she had asked to spend the <b>evening</b> <b>with</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R
60|$|As Mrs. O'Halloran sat that <b>evening,</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> work in her hand, on the terrace; <b>with</b> <b>her</b> husband, {{smoking a}} cigar, beside her. She paused, several times, as {{she heard a}} burst of laughter.|$|R
500|$|Marcia Overstrand is the powerful, {{ambitious and}} wilful ExtraOrdinary Wizard of the series. She is {{characterized}} as stern, bad-tempered and intimidating, {{but with a}} good heart beneath. Her affection towards her apprentice Septimus is manifest in the novels, as is the responsibility she feels to protect him and his sister, <b>even</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> own life. She {{is described as a}} tall woman, with long, dark curly hair and deep-green eyes, and generally wears a deep purple tunic with purple python-skin boots. Her symbol and source of power, an Akhu-Amulet, which makes her ExtraOrdinary Wizard, hangs around her neck. Her haughty and vain characterization has been praised as a [...] "well-written stand-alone".|$|E
500|$|Lim {{dominated}} Tan through beatings, threats, and lies. [...] He {{persuaded her}} to prostitute herself {{to supplement their}} income. [...] He also convinced her {{that he needed to}} fornicate with young women to stay healthy; thus, Tan assisted him in his business, preparing their clients for his pleasure. [...] Lim's influence over Tan was strong; on his encouragement and promise that sex with a younger man would preserve her youth, Tan copulated with a Malay teenager and <b>even</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> younger brother. [...] The boy was not her only sibling to be influenced by Lim; the medium had earlier seduced Tan's younger sister and tricked her into selling her body and having sex with the two youths. [...] Despite the abuses, Tan lived with Lim, enjoying the dresses, beauty products and slimming courses bought with their income.|$|E
500|$|The {{performances}} of multiple cast members were frequently {{mentioned in the}} reviews. Lou Lumenick of New York Post asserted that Ehle was [...] "outstanding", a view that was analogous to that of The Boston Globe journalist Wesley Morris, who praised not only Ehle's performance, but {{the work of the}} [...] "undercard" [...] such as Cranston, Gould, and Colantoni, among others. Similarly, Peter Travers of Rolling Stone called Ehle the [...] "best in show". As Los Angeles Times Kenneth Turan summed up, [...] "Two-time Tony-winning actress Jennifer Ehle comes close to stealing the picture with this quietly yet quirkily empathetic performance." [...] In regards to Law, The Philadelphia Inquirer Steven Rea stated that the actor portrayed the character with a [...] "nutty" [...] confidence; Mick LaSalle from the San Francisco Chronicle agreed with Rea's thoughts. Damon provided the film's [...] "relatable heart", according to Forrest Wickman of Slate, who concluded that <b>even</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> controlled performance, Winslet [...] "lives up to her head-of-the-class reputation even in an unusually small role".|$|E
50|$|Bachelor Jason meets an {{attractive}} lady at the Gaucho club, and spends {{the rest of}} the <b>evening</b> <b>with</b> <b>her,</b> but on the pretext of spending time with him too, this lady is just using him.|$|R
60|$|She {{was to have}} dined {{out that}} <b>evening</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> aunt, but when the time to dress came, she pleaded a violent headache, and persuaded Lady Thurwell, who was a good-natured little woman, to take an excuse.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Very well,' cried she, {{and kept}} the doors {{carefully}} locked for seven days and on the eighth the brothers returned as before. Then, after spending one <b>evening</b> <b>with</b> <b>her,</b> they departed {{as soon as they}} had done breakfast.|$|R
500|$|Critical {{reception}} to Jo {{has been}} generally positive. Diana Steenbergen of IGN favored Jo from the beginning, deeming her [...] "tough and direct, and also female, something the boys don't {{have a lot}} of in their lives right now". She also believed that Jo and Dean had a [...] "natural chemistry" [...] between them, which continues <b>even</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> reappearance in the fifth season. However, Steenbergen was confused by Jo's anger at Sam and Dean over John Winchester's involvement in her father's death, feeling that the show's producers may have added it to the story as an excuse for Jo's removal from the series. While Tina Charles of TV Guide was at first unsure about the character, she wrote that by the episode [...] "No Exit", [...] "Tal did step things up and kinda won me over". She believed that while Jo did not make a good love interest for Dean, she was good in a [...] "sisterly or friendly fellow-ghostbuster way", deeming her as [...] "someone they can count on in a pinch". Overall, Charles felt that Jo [...] "fit into that world, whether she was a little overzealous or not".|$|E

2500|$|Following her {{announcement}} of an exploratory committee and candidacy filing on January 20, 2007 with the FEC, she began fundraising and campaigning activities. For several months Clinton led opinion polls among Democratic candidates by substantial margins until Senator Barack Obama pulled close to or <b>even</b> <b>with</b> <b>her.</b> Clinton then regained her polling lead, winning many polls by double digits; by autumn 2007 she was leading all other Democratic candidates by wide margins in national polls. [...] She placed {{third in the}} Iowa caucus to Barack Obama and John Edwards, and trailed considerably in polls shortly thereafter in New Hampshire before staging a comeback and finishing first in the primary there.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Two points I liked,' {{she said}} to Robert, who spent the <b>evening</b> <b>with</b> <b>her,</b> while Owen was dining with Mr. Currie--'one that he {{accepted}} the Holt as a charge, not a gift--the other that he never professed to be marrying for my sake.' ...|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Banks came in {{the next}} <b>evening</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> daughter, and condoled with the {{housekeeper}} on the affliction which had already been noised about Seabridge. Mrs. Church, who had accepted her as an ally, but with mental reservations, softly applied a handkerchief to her eyes.|$|R
60|$|The {{next day}} Mary Powlett {{was unable to}} go off as usual to Marsden as George was in great pain from his scald. She went down to church, however, in the <b>evening</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> father, Bill Swinton taking her place by the bedside of the boy.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Even</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> {{views on}} matrimony, Nadezhda von Meck was {{resigned}} {{to it as}} a means of social stability and procreation, and her own marital experience may have forced her to recognize its benefits. This realization may have also been why she strove to marry off her children as soon as possible—to ensure their stability in the event of her demise. Even in marriage, though, she considered sexual relations between men and women to be mutual exploitation. Russian radical thinkers of the period, such as Nikolay Chernyshevsky and Dmitry Pisarev, espoused views not far removed from Nadezhda von Meck's. Both men considered marriage to be a pillar of bourgeois society and called for its abolition. [...] Meck especially respected Pisarev's work, as well as 19th-century positivism in general.|$|E
2500|$|GameInformers Lix Lanier {{stated that}} no villain, male or female, has {{the charm of}} GLaDOS: [...] "If she's not trying to kill Chell, she's likely belittling her with passive-aggressive {{comments}} {{that would make a}} sorority girl proud. <b>Even</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> robotic voice, it's clear that 'You look great by the way, very healthy' is no compliment." [...] GamePros Chris Holt discussed GLaDOS as an icon of feminism, and wrote that as opposed to being an [...] "archetypal villain", she is a [...] "prototypical bound woman". He added that [...] "A female protagonist murdering a female villainess (or vice versa) is not what is interesting to us as critics, but it's the idea that despite her seemingly robotic, unemotional and unstoppable nature, GLaDOS appears vulnerable, sympathetic, and even a victim herself". He wrote [...] "GLaDOS has been augmented because of the danger she presents to a presumably misogynistic society" [...] and that [...] "by destroying these cores, Chell is stripping her of the layers that society has deemed necessary for her to wear" [...] and making her [...] "far more dangerous". He added that Chell and GLaDOS serve as opposing sides of femininity; where Chell is [...] "dutiful and does every task assigned of her", GLaDOS is [...] "aggressive and seemingly dangerous to the order of a male-dominated society". He also described Chell as a [...] "domestic icon" [...] while he described GLaDOS as a [...] "progressive, intelligent working woman" [...] and that by killing her, [...] "Chell {{can be seen as the}} dutiful 'safe' woman conquering the 'dangerous' feminist". He also cited the use of poems by Emily Dickinson, whom he compares to GLaDOS in how both were reclusive and were essentially disembodied voices.|$|E
60|$|His lordship crimsoned. On {{the subject}} of his son he could be angry in earnest, <b>even</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> ladyship, as already we have seen.|$|E
6000|$|But let me {{turn from}} fancy-pictured scenes [...] To that whose {{pastoral}} calm before me lies: [...] Here nothing harsh or rugged intervenes; [...] The early <b>evening</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> misty dyes [...] Smooths off the ravelled edges of the nigh, [...] Relieves the distant <b>with</b> <b>her</b> cooler sky, [...] And tones the landscape down, and soothes the wearied eyes.|$|R
60|$|Lord Ormersfield {{came down}} {{encouraged}} by {{his visit to}} the invalid, whom he had found dressed and able to converse nearly as usual. She begged him to come to dinner the next day, and spend the <b>evening</b> <b>with</b> <b>her,</b> promising <b>with</b> a smile that if he would bring Louis, their aunt should chaperon Mary.|$|R
50|$|It {{would be}} Monroe's last {{day on the}} set. She left the party with Wally Cox, and had {{borrowed}} the fur-trimmed grey suit she had worn while filming that day, because she was to attend a Muscular Dystrophy fundraiser at Dodger Stadium that <b>evening,</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> former husband Joe DiMaggio, and co-star Dean Martin's young son, Dean Paul Martin.|$|R
60|$|At this question, {{or series}} of questions, {{the young girl}} turned quite round, and, waiting until I was <b>even</b> <b>with</b> <b>her,</b> she {{continued}} her walk at my side, although still holding her companion's hand.|$|E
6000|$|As the cab started {{he looked}} over his {{shoulder}} at Anne through the front window. [...] "Well worth trying," [...] he said to himself. [...] "It's the way to be <b>even</b> <b>with</b> <b>her.</b> And it's the way to be free." ...|$|E
60|$|Reddy grinned {{more than}} ever, which wasn't a bit nice of him. Instead of being sorry that Old Granny Fox had {{had such a}} fright, he was {{planning}} how he would get <b>even</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> when she should scold him for his own carelessness.|$|E
5000|$|On 21 July 2014, Sophia Patsalides was {{internally}} {{selected to}} represent Cyprus at the 12th annual Junior Eurovision Song Contest in Malta.

60|$|There was {{a certain}} shock in all this. He recurred to his last <b>evening</b> <b>with</b> <b>her,</b> when in her {{paroxysm}} of agony she had thrown herself at his feet. Much as he had desired such an outcome, it puzzled him to find <b>her</b> in love <b>with</b> some one else. It {{was not at all}} like books.|$|R
60|$|She felt {{from his}} eyes that he {{knew what she was}} {{suffering}}, and was <b>even</b> suffering <b>with</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R
60|$|The {{good woman}} asked no {{questions}} concerning {{the parents of the}} child it was proposed she should keep, and her silence on this point may have been due to the fact that, <b>even</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> grandson's aid, it was difficult to understand all the boys said.|$|E
6000|$|... "Curse her," [...] says master, in a fury, {{lifting up}} his maim'd arm--"curse her! but I will be <b>even</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> one day. I am sure of Matilda: I {{took care to}} put that {{beyond the reach of}} a failure. The girl must marry me, for her own sake." ...|$|E

60|$|There {{could hardly}} be a happier {{creature}} {{in the world than}} Mrs. John Knightley, in this short visit to Hartfield, going about every morning among <b>her</b> old acquaintance <b>with</b> <b>her</b> five children, and talking over what she had done every <b>evening</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> father and sister. She had nothing to wish otherwise, but that the days did not pass so swiftly. It was a delightful visit;--perfect, in being much too short.|$|R
50|$|In 1970, Mayer {{suffered}} a stroke {{in the early hours}} following a Thanksgiving <b>evening</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> family. She {{was rushed to the hospital}} and though surviving, spent the next seven years in rehabilitation needing to re-learn such simple tasks as the alphabet and basic motor functions. Thirty years later, having regained the ability to walk and speak, Mayer considers herself 90% recovered.|$|R
60|$|Phineas {{could not}} find another moment in which to speak to her. Though he spent the <b>evening</b> <b>with</b> <b>her,</b> and stood over her as she sang at the Earl's request, and pressed her hand as she went to bed, and was up to see her start in the morning, he could not draw from her either a word or a look.|$|R
