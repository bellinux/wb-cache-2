40|$|For large {{financial}} institutions, {{credit risk}} {{has been the}} biggest problem of its development. At present, the credit risk management in the international large-scale financial institutions has formed {{a complete set of}} theoretical system and measurement model. Compared with them, there is still a big gap between China's and foreign financial institutions and commercial banks in this area. Therefore, the measurement and evaluation of the credit risk of China's commercial banks is a topic of concern and discussion in the academic and financial system. How to make more effective management of credit risk and constantly improve the efficiency of credit risk management of commercial banks is also one of popular topics of extensive research. This paper analyzes the current situation of credit risk management of C bank Chongqing branch in China, and makes use of the KMV model to evaluate the credit of some customers of the bank. Compare the evaluation results with the results of the bank's <b>internal</b> <b>rating</b> <b>system,</b> and find the problems in the credit risk management and internal rating of C bank Chongqing branch. The main difference between KMV model and internal rating in C bank Chongqing branch is that the data for KMV model is more dynamic. The analysis of the customer combined with every point in the stock market, bond market and the variability of foreign exchange market. So it’s more accurate and timely. On the contrary, the timeliness of the internal rating method is poor. It is mainly based on static customer financial data, audit reports and other customer rating. Although it is also able to better reflect the customer's credit situation, it cannot quickly and accurately grasp the trend of customer change {{due to the lack of}} timeliness. From this dissertation, we found that the strengthening of commercial bank credit risk supervision and management has some significance in the development of China's credit risk areas. Also, determine the cause and level of credit risk is the foundation of credit risk measurement management. Based on the analysis of KMV model, it is found that the model can improve and supplement the <b>internal</b> <b>rating</b> <b>system</b> of C bank Chongqing branch, and strengthen the dynamic monitoring and timeliness of the <b>internal</b> <b>rating</b> <b>system...</b>|$|E
40|$|The credit {{business}} {{is an essential}} part of each banks' activities. With regard to the increasing regulatory obligations, the risk management and the associated minimum capital requirements gain in importance. Banks have got the possibility to determine their credit risk by an <b>internal</b> <b>rating</b> <b>system.</b> It is current practice to make use of quantitative methods to develop the sys-tem. This paper will focus on rating systems calibrated using the discriminant analysis and the logistic regression. Both methods will be presented on a theoretical basis and will be applied in a practical testing. In the first step, the borrowers are divided into rating classes.

The requirement of the microregulation of the banking system and the increasing need of more accurate expectations on the exposure at the loss of financial institutions are probably going to push up research on firm insolvency. Nevertheless, a better knowledge on the causes of firms' failure is not only wished for an improvement of financial sphere functioning.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of the Basel II Capital Accord has encouraged financial institu-tions to build internal rating systems assessing the credit risk of their various credit portfolios. One of the key outputs of an <b>internal</b> <b>rating</b> <b>system</b> is the probability of default (PD), which reflects {{the likelihood that a}} counterparty will default on his/her financial obligation. Since the PD modeling problem basically boils down to a discrimination problem (defaulter or not), one may rely on the myriad of clas-sification techniques that have been suggested in the literature. However, since the credit risk models will be subject to supervisory review and evaluation, they must be easy to understand and transparent. Hence, techniques such as neural networks or support vector machines are less suitable due to their black box nature.

40|$|Recent {{financial}} crises and especially large corporate bankruptcies, have led bank managements and financial authorities to follow and monitor both financial and real sector risks, and {{to focus on}} firm failures. Bank of International Settlements, has therefore, taken the decision to include the necessity for banks to employ <b>internal</b> <b>rating</b> <b>systems</b> among BASEL II criteria. Thus, risk assessment and <b>internal</b> <b>rating</b> <b>systems</b> criteria would be made operational by the individual European Union banking systems, {{by the end of}} 2007, and January 2008 in Turkey, at the latest. Financial and operational information of the firms, makes up the input to the risk analysis. This information can be aggregated to portray the sectoral trends, and/or focused upon on a firm basis to understand firms’ financial behaviours. Finance theory summarizes firms’ risks under financial distress and firm failure. There have been a myriad of works under these two headings, particularly in the United States, after the Great Depression. While early studies have focused upon the differences in the financial ratios of financially sound and failed firms, especially with the advances in computing capacity, the last two decades have witnessed an increasing use of machine learning methods in the failure prediction. Therefore, machine learning methods can be considered as having great potential in failure prediction and being good candidates as decision aids for policy-making. This study considers financial distress and firm failure on theoretical grounds, gives a compact but elaborate explanation of machine learning schemes, and analyzes the results of these schemes run with data obtained from the database of Real Sector Data Division of the Central Bank.

40|$|In {{order to}} manage model risk, {{financial}} institutions {{need to set}} up validation processes so as to monitor {{the quality of the}} models on an ongoing basis.

We use two models provided by vendors, a model developed by the National Bank of Belgium, and the Altman Z-score model to investigate model power, the extent of disagreement between models in the ranking of firms, and the design of internal rating systems. We also examine the potential gains from combining the output of multiple models. We find that the power of all four models in predicting bankruptcies is very good at the one-year horizon, even though not all of the models were developed using bankruptcy data and the models use different statistical methodologies. Disagreements in firm rankings are nevertheless significant across models, and model choice {{will have an impact on}} loan pricing and origination decisions. We find that it is possible to realize important gains from combining models with similar power. In addition, we show that it can also be beneficial to combine a weaker model with a stronger one if disagreements across models with respect to failing firms are high enough.

In other words, the model's purpose is to provide as good an approximation as possible of what constitutes the true underlying risk relationship between a set of inputs and a target variable. These parameters are used for regulatory capital calculations to determine the capital needed that serves a buffer to protect depositors in adverse economic conditions. In order to manage model risk, financial institutions need to set up validation processes so as to monitor the quality of the models on an ongoing basis. Validation is important to inform all stakeholders (e. g. board of directors, senior management, regulators, investors, borrowers, …) and as such allow them to make better decisions.

40|$|According to Basel II (Revised International Capital Framework), {{banks have}} to hold {{adequate}} capital to cover losses resulting from specific sources of risk, among them credit risk. Credit risk refers {{to the possibility of}} a loss occurring due to counterparty failure, against that, the bank has taken credit exposure. The minimum amount of capital that banks should hold against credit risk can be calculated using a standardized approach - based on assessments developed by external Rating Agencies and approved by Authority – or using a Internal Rating Based (IRB) approach - based on the use of an <b>internal</b> <b>rating</b> <b>system.</b> In this framework a strategic variable is the Loss Given Default (LGD), which quantifies the loss which is subject to a credit institute in case of counterparty default, usually referred to any exposure of bank’s client; LGD can also be interpreted as the complement to one of the recovery rate. The aim {{of this paper is to}} illustrate an actuarial model for LGD estimation in a IRB approach – i. e. based on a credit institute’s database – by means of a semi-markov approach to describe the recovery process. In fact, creditor’s recovery process can be represented as a multistate model with a finite number of states, where each state corresponds to a possible step of the recovery process. Unlike classical Markov models, the proposed methodology joins the multistate model with a semi- markov probabilistic structure, in which the transition probabilities among states take into account, not only the status previously occupied, as in Markov models, but also the permanence time in the last visited state. The semi-Markov models are an evolution of Markov processes as integrate the information on time spent in the most recent visited state. The semi-Markov model captures a large amount of information, so it seems more adequate for the problem to be treated. In fact, in financial sense, recovery rate is the present value of the cash flows associated with different steps of recovery process, until the settlement, for any unit of exposure. Therefore, to quantify the loss incurred by the creditor, a key variable is the time required to settle each recovery step. Once defined the probabilistic structure, the estimation of LGD needs to define cash flows – usually called rewards - associated with each system state, making a distinction between the rewards associated with permanence in a state and those associated with transitions among different states. When a set of rewards are defined, it is possible to determine LGD on t periods; this measure can be extended to the entire portfolio of outstanding loans, obtaining the Total Loss Given Default (TLGD). Finally it is proposed an application of the model to estimate semi-markov transition probabilities, LGD and TLGD for bankruptcy proceedings, characterized by 12 steps of recovery. Finally, for an entire portfolio of outstanding loans of a financial institution, semi-Markov approach has been compared with Markov approach...|$|E

The quality and the explanatory ability of <b>internal</b> <b>rating</b> <b>systems</b> can be different.

The analyses has proved that the usage of <b>internal</b> <b>rating</b> models increase profitability through substantial savings in equity, which allows the banks to accelerate lending activities in the banking practice. A comparison of standardized approach and foundation <b>internal</b> <b>rating</b> based approach demonstrates that requirement of equity capital can be decreased from 30 to 40 %.

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{quantification}} of potential impacts of credit risk management approaches on the financial performance using collaterals as techniques to reduce credit risk of commercial bank. The requirement to coordinate regulation of the capital adequacy has resulted from fears of central banks of the most developed countries that the capital held by banks to cover even a small loss is not sufficient. Due to the interconnection of financial markets, {{there is a possibility}} that transfer problems of individual banks and problems caused by external shocks could threaten the entire system. The article is focused on quantitative analyses of selected methods of credit risk management using collaterals in the intention of Basel II and quantification of their impact on determining the amount of equity that bank must hold. To set the optimal amount of equity related with the risk portfolio is the one of the most important precondition to increase efficiency and competitiveness of commercial banks. To explain better the usage of internal rating models and techniques reducing credit risk, the amount of capital requirements for the simulated portfolio are calculated and the obtained results within a standardized and foundation IRB approaches are compared. The achievement of higher capital requirements of Basel II doesn't automatically mean that a bank would be safe and also profitable. The equity growth is a necessary but not sufficient condition for achieving greater security of the banking sector. In the article, methods of analysis, synthesis, and analysis of causes, induction and deduction are used. In the empirical analysis two methods of Basel II have been used and the results of calculating capital requirements have been calculated. Finally, the methods of comparison have been applied and the question which method provides the highest demand for capital has been raised and compared with other methods. A simple and a comprehensive approach of Standardized Approach and foundation approaches of Internal Rating Based Approach with and without collateral instruments have been put into this comparison. The equation of approaches to credit risk management confirmed the specified hypothesis that quality <b>internal</b> <b>rating</b> <b>system</b> strongly supports the bank's financial performance. The calculations of the working team show that the use of internal rating models brings a significant increase in earnings and profitability through a significant saving in equity in banking practice. The current results demonstrate that the requirement of capital could decrease by approximately 30 %, which means using of an internal rating model could increase the profitability on equity up to 13 %, depending on the structure of the assets, the amount of the interest margins and the profitability ratio. Even saving capital through "the improved credit risk management", which was considered one of the important stabilizing elements in this system, does not work in banking practice and therefore the system of internal ratings should be adjusted to the new regulatory conditions...|$|E

We show that optimal policies provide incentives to specialize: sophisticated banks should be directed towards low-risk loan portfolios and be allowed to grow, whereas banks with less developed <b>rating</b> <b>systems</b> should be regulated as niche players that absorb a maximum of the unavoidable systematic risk in the banking sector. The coexistence of two capital adequacy standards dominates a market structure in which all banks migrate to one regulatory regime. We analyze the moral hazard problem that sophisticated banks may misreport the true risk of their assets, and show that it will reduce the optimal level of differentiation between the two types of banks, but not eliminate the advantage of two coexisting standards. We address the problem of banks deploying <b>internal</b> <b>rating</b> <b>systems</b> without information sharing, and show that this may accelerate the adoption of differentiated regulation...|$|R
40|$|WP 04 / 2011; Based on new {{regulations}} of Basel II Accord in 2004, banks and financial nstitutions have now {{the possibility to}} develop <b>internal</b> <b>rating</b> <b>systems</b> {{with the aim of}} correctly udging financial health status of firms. This study analyses the situation of Italian small firms that are difficult to judge because their economic and financial data are often not available. The intend of this work is to propose a simulation framework to give a rating judgements to firms presenting poor financial information. The model assigns a rating judgement that is a simulated counterpart of that done by Bureau van Dijk-K Finance (BvD). Assigning rating score to small firms with problem of poor availability of financial data is really problematic. Nevertheless, in Italy the majority of firms are small and there is not a law that requires to firms to deposit balance-sheet in a detailed form. For this reason the model proposed in this work is a three-layer framework that allows us to assign ating judgements to small enterprises using simple balance-sheet data...|$|R
40|$|The {{internal}} ratings-based approach under Basel II allows {{banks to}} use their <b>internal</b> <b>rating</b> <b>systems</b> to determine capital requirements for credit risk, subject to explicit supervisory approval. The probability of default {{is one of the}} key parameters used in the calculation of regulatory capital. All banks must provide supervisors with an internal estimate of the probability of default. This paper proposes a dynamic hierarchical Bayesian model for the estimation of the probability of default in the presence of missing data, a common occurrence in financial applications. Our framework not only allows us to impute such missing information but also to account for both serial and cross-sectional correlations in the estimation of the probability of default. We can also measure the impact of a stress situation on the credit rating. Our model is applied to data on obligors of a domestic bank in South Korea between 2000 and 2003. For comparison, we also consider a hierarchical Bayesian model with a stationary time correlation structure and a classical logistic regression model...|$|R
40|$|Under a new Basel capital accord, bank {{regulators}} {{might use}} quantitative measures when evaluating the eligibility of <b>internal</b> credit <b>rating</b> <b>systems</b> for the <b>internal</b> ratings based approach. Based {{on data from}} Deutsche Bundesbank and using a simulation approach, we find {{that it is possible}} to identify strongly inferior <b>rating</b> <b>systems</b> out-of time based on statistics that measure either the quality of ranking borrowers from good to bad, or the quality of individual default probability forecasts. Banks do not significantly improve system quality if they use credit scores instead of ratings, or logistic regression default probability estimates instead of historical data. Banks that are not able to discriminate between high- and low-risk borrowers increase their average capital requirements due to the concavity of the capital requirements function...|$|R
40|$|Driven by {{the need}} to {{allocate}} capital in a profitable way and by the recently suggested Basel II regulations, financial institutions are being more and more obliged to build credit scoring models assessing the risk of default of their clients. Many techniques have been suggested to tackle this problem. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) is a promising new technique that has recently emanated from different domains such as applied statistics, neural networks and machine learning. In this paper, we experiment with least squares support vector machines (LS-SVMs), a recently modified version of SVMs, and report significantly better results when contrasted with the classical techniques.
