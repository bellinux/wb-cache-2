40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the scalability of the parallel video decoding on heterogeneous many core architectures. As benchmark, we use a highly parallel H. 264 /AVC <b>video</b> <b>decoder</b> that generates a large number of independent tasks. In order to translate task-level parallelism into performance gains both the <b>video</b> <b>decoder</b> and the architecture have been optimized. The <b>video</b> <b>decoder</b> was modified for exploiting coarse-grain frame-level parallelism in the entropy decoding kernel which has been considered the main bottleneck. Second, a heterogeneous combination of cores is evaluated for executing different type of tasks. Finally, an evaluation of the memory requirements of the whole system has been carried out. Experiments conducted using a trace-driven simulation methodology shows that the evaluated system exhibits a good parallel scalability up to 68 cores. At this point the parallel <b>video</b> <b>decoder</b> is able to decode more than 200 HD frames per second using simple low power processors. Postprint (published version...|$|R

30|$|For noisy channels, most VLCs {{could not}} be reconstructed, and in some cases, the <b>video</b> <b>decoder</b> reconstructs the wrong {{coefficients}} because it lost the synchronization with the video encoder. To overcome this problem, this article proposes two error-resilient video methods. The first method is to resynchronize the <b>video</b> <b>decoder</b> using resynchronization patterns.
