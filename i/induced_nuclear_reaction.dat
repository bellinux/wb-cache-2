40|$|Abstract. The {{field of}} the uncharted {{territory}} of high-intensity laser interaction with matter is confronted with new exotic phenomena and, consequently, opens new research perspectives. The intense laser beams interacting with a gas or solid target generate beams of electrons, pro-tons and ion. These beams can <b>induce</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>reactions.</b> Electrons also generate ions high-energy photons via bremsstrahlung processes which can also <b>induce</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>reactions.</b> In this context a new research do-main began to form {{in the last decade}} or so, namely nuclear physics with high power lasers. The observation of high brilliance proton beams of tens of MeV energy from solid targets has stimulated an intense re-search activity. The laser-driven particle beams have to compete with conventional nuclear accelerator-generated beams. The ultimate goal is aiming at applications of the laser produced beams in research, tech-nology and medicine. The mechanism responsible for ion acceleration are currently subject of intensive research in many laboratories in the world. The existing results, experimental and theoretical, and their per-spectives are reviewed in this article in the context of IZEST and the scientific program of ELI-NP. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{statistical}} {{theory of}} light nucleus reaction (STLN) is proposed to describe both neutron and light charged particle <b>induced</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>reactions</b> with 1 p-shell light nuclei involved. The dynamic of STLN {{is described by}} the unified Hauser-Feshbach and exciton model, of which the angular momentum and parity conservations are considered in equilibrium and pre-equilibrium processes. The Coulomb barriers of the incident and outgoing charged particles, which seriously influence the open reaction channels, could be reasonably considered in the incident channel and the different outgoing channels. In kinematics, the recoiling effects in various emission processes are taken strictly into account. Taking $^ 9 $Be(p, xn) reaction as an example, we calculate the double-differential cross sections of outgoing neutrons and charged particles using PUNF code {{in the frame of}} STLN. The calculated results agree very well with the existing experimental neutron double-differential cross sections at $E_p= 18 $ MeV, and indicate that PUNF code is a powerful tool to set up file- 6 in the reaction data library for the light charged particle <b>induced</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>reactions</b> with 1 p-shell light nuclei involved.

40|$|Energetic {{and intense}} neutron {{exposures}} in near-plasma {{components of a}} (D,T) -fusion reactor are expected to cast strong demands on the functionality and integrity of materials. To describe and quantify this radiation exposure damage parameters as defined {{in the frame of}} the dpa-concept are appropriate. They combine the probability for the production of a primary recoil atom (PKA) in a neutron <b>induced</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>reaction</b> with the number of stable defects in the evolving cascade of displaced lattice atoms. Calculations of such parameters and damage production rates are commonly based on the well established NRT-Lindhard model. However, due to its inherent deficiencies, i. e. restrictions of the underlying physics and insufficiencies of the modelling, the NRT model is not appropriate for light mass, mono- and polyatomic materials in blankets of (D,T) -fusion reactors. Therefore, this work has focused on computer simulations of collision cascades within the bounds of the binary collision approximation (BCA) using the code Marlowe. Because of the specific requirements, the code had to be modified and extended significantly, particularly by a consistent treatment of ionic interactions and a new implementation of rectangular geometries. In this way, it is now possible to evaluate adequately the primary defect state in polyatomic, ionic materials and selected heterogeneous structures, without consuming to much computing time for the simulations.
