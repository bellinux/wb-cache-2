40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a new approach}} to programming autonomic systems. Autonomic functions are integrated into element objects at design time using a special language called JSpoon. JSpoon extends element classes with management attributes representing configuration, performance, status and fault information. The JSpoon compiler generates respective code and interfaces to instrument the data in a common Modeler repository, provided by NESTOR [28]. JSpoon programs access and manipulate management data without distinction between "agent" and "manager" roles. JSpoon further supports integration of plug-in <b>knowledge</b> <b>modules</b> that can interpret and control element operations. These <b>knowledge</b> <b>modules</b> are used to incorporate autonomic operations with elements. This design-time approach offers several substantive advantages over current alternatives. Management is integrated with the element development life-cycle. Instrumentation is compiler-generated and may be flexibly designed by element developers, while being consolidated into a unified global management data model. <b>Knowledge</b> <b>modules</b> can be seamlessly integrated with third party elements augmenting these elements with the logic for autonomic behavior...|$|R

Fluid power {{transmission}} and control, fuzzy control and related fault-tolerant control technology, {{which have been}} widely used, as the core of control and {{power transmission}}. At {{the same time the}} hydraulic system is developing to be large-scale and complicated, which makes the high reliability and safety more and more important. There {{is no doubt that the}} researches conducted in the hydraulic system of fault tolerant control field will create significant value in application. This article summarizes the <b>Knowledge</b> <b>Modules</b> of Hydraulic Fault (KMHF), which is the necessary premise to carry out researches on the fault-tolerant techniques based on <b>Knowledge</b> <b>Modules</b> of Hydraulic Fault. On this basis, this article takes the pressure-flow compound control module as an example, introduces the principle design, analyzes the static and dynamic of their pressure /flow control unit. Especially, the paper employs the simulation tools-AMESim, to conduct simulation calculation and analysis of the pressure perception control module which is based on <b>Knowledge</b> <b>Modules</b> of Hydraulic Fault. Besides, this paper has carried out experiments on the automatic hydraulic drill platform to research the test fault-tolerant control performance of the pressure perception control module. The simulation and test results show that the new fluid fault-tolerant technique based on <b>Knowledge</b> <b>Modules</b> of Hydraulic Fault proposed in this article practically improves the reliability and safety of the hydraulic system, and has great value for application...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{the levels of}} CHD knowledge and self-reported health behaviours in first year female HSC students attending South Lanarkshire College in Scotland. Identify if a relationship exists between the students levels of CHD knowledge and their self-reported health behaviours and identify if a significant difference exists in the CHD knowledge and health behaviours of students who have undertaken a CHD <b>knowledge</b> <b>module</b> {{as part of their}} course of study compared to students who have not undertaken the CHD <b>knowledge</b> <b>module</b> as part of their course of study. As {{it has been suggested that}} knowledge may be a pre-requisite to positive health behaviour change, which is a key component in the prevention of CHD. Methods: First year Health and Social Care Further Education College Students at a Scottish College were asked to complete a modified CHD knowledge and self-reported health behaviour questionnaire. One-point was awarded for each CHD knowledge question answered correctly, these points were then totaled and students were given a coronary heart disease knowledge score out of a possible score of 52. One-point was also awarded for each positive health behaviour reported, which were then totaled and students were given a health behaviour score out of a possible score of 10. These scores were then used for comparison between the students. Results: One-hundred and eight students took part in the study. Students who received the CHD <b>knowledge</b> <b>module</b> had significantly greater CHD knowledge scores than the students who did not receive the CHD <b>knowledge</b> <b>module</b> (p= 0. 0001). However, there was no significant difference between the health behaviour scores of students who had received the CHD <b>knowledge</b> <b>module</b> and students who had not received the CHD <b>knowledge</b> <b>module</b> (p= 0. 742). No relationship was found between the CHD knowledge scores and health behaviour scores of all the students (p= 0. 185). Conclusion: CHD education may be an effective intervention for increasing CHD knowledge in female students. However, this increased CHD knowledge did not promote positive lifestyle behaviours in these female students, suggesting that other interventions may be required to promote positive lifestyle behaviours...|$|E

An ITS typically consists of several modules that are connected to each other. This research focuses {{on the distribution of}} the ITS module that provides expert knowledge services. For the distribution of such an expert <b>knowledge</b> <b>module</b> we need to use an architectural style because this gives a standard interface, which increases the reusability and operability of the expert <b>knowledge</b> <b>module.</b> To provide expert knowledge modules in a distributed way we need to answer the research question: ‘How can we compare and evaluate REST, Web services and Plug-in architectural styles for the distribution of the expert <b>knowledge</b> <b>module</b> in an intelligent tutoring system?’. We present an assessment method for selecting an architectural style. Using the assessment method on three architectural styles, we selected the REST architectural style as the style that best supports the distribution of expert knowledge modules. With this assessment method we also analyzed the trade-offs that come with selecting REST. We present a prototype and architectural views based on REST to demonstrate that the assessment method correctly scores REST as an appropriate architectural style for the distribution of expert knowledge modules...|$|E

The objective is to minimize the sum of maximum earliness and tardiness of jobs. In order to optimize the problem exactly a mathematical model is proposed.

SEBASTIAN has been used to implement four distinct decision support systems; an architectural overview is provided for one of these systems. Preliminary assessments indicate that SEBASTIAN fulfills all original design objectives, including the re-use of executable medical knowledge across diverse applications and care settings, the straightforward authoring of <b>knowledge</b> <b>modules,</b> and use of the framework to implement decision support applications with significant clinical utility...|$|R
40|$|The basic {{requirement}} for scheduling the continuous casting in a steel making factory is {{to optimize the}} strain of the converters. The "automatic continuous casting program" supplies insufficient advises, {{because this is not}} capable of handling time restrictions. It has to be optimized by two encapsulating <b>knowledge</b> based <b>modules</b> {{to come up with a}} complete workable solution. A plan developed for the continuous casting is guided by process data, scenarios describing the surrounding situation, and the depending plan for the converters. This planning process has to include resources, observing terms, and trouble handling. The possibility of including the experience of the masters of continuous casting and converters is important for improving the work of the Al modules. The evaluation of the given situation is done in the first <b>knowledge</b> based <b>module</b> according to the process data and the describing scenarios.
