50|$|Most often, {{the power}} is {{conveyed}} by a roller chain, known as the <b>drive</b> <b>chain</b> or transmission chain, passing over a sprocket gear, with {{the teeth of the}} gear meshing with the holes in the links of the chain. The gear is turned, and this pulls the chain putting mechanical force into the system. Another type of <b>drive</b> <b>chain</b> is the Morse chain, invented by the Morse Chain Company of Ithaca, New York, United States. This has inverted teeth.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The roller <b>chain</b> <b>drive</b> of {{the machine}} for supplementing {{traditional}} Chinese pills has movement characteristics of gear drive and belt drive, and its movement is a little complex, so interior point penalty function method is applied in the optimum design of chain. First of all, the optimizing mathematical model is built by applying the interior point penalty function method, and the design variables, the target function and constraints are proposed, and then the optimal solution for key parameters of <b>drive</b> <b>chain</b> is obtained by the iterative, which will provide the reference and basis for the research on big drive power and the least rows number of <b>drive</b> <b>chain...</b>|$|R

50|$|Both {{can be used}} to move objects by {{attaching}} pockets, buckets, or frames to them; chains are often used to move things vertically by holding them in frames, as in industrial toasters, while belts are good at moving things horizontally in the form of conveyor belts. It is not unusual for the systems to be used in combination; for example the rollers that drive conveyor belts are themselves often driven by <b>drive</b> <b>chains.</b>|$|E

Dust clogs <b>drive</b> <b>chain</b> and other parts and must be removed by hand. Picks and bucket lips become overheated by friction and be resharpened or replaced frequently. Addition of oscillating and rotating water jets to pick-and-bucket machine keeps down dust, cools cutting edges, and flushes machine.

500|$|<b>Chain</b> <b>drive,</b> endless power-transmitting: The Greek Philon of Byzantium (3rd or 2nd century BC) {{described}} a <b>chain</b> <b>drive</b> and windlass {{used in the}} operation of a polybolos (a repeating ballista), [...] "but the <b>chain</b> <b>drive</b> did not continuously transmit power from shaft to shaft and hence they were not in the direct line of ancestry of the chain-drive proper". A continuously <b>driven</b> <b>chain</b> <b>drive</b> first appeared in 11th century China. Perhaps inspired by chain pumps which had been known in China since at least the Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD) when they were mentioned by the Chinese philosopher Wang Chong (27– c. 100 AD), the endless power-transmitting <b>chain</b> <b>drive</b> was first used in the gearing of the clock tower built at Kaifeng in 1090 by the Song Chinese politician, mathematician and astronomer Su Song (1020–1101).|$|R

50|$|The Hetton {{colliery}} {{railway used}} steam locomotives from the outset; four built in 1820 {{and one in}} 1822. They were developments of George Stephenson's earlier Killingworth design. These were of 0-4-0 arrangement with two vertical cylinders, one above each axle, and the wheels coupled by <b>drive</b> <b>chains.</b> They used steam springs for suspension, there not yet being a way of forging an adequate steel spring to carry {{the weight of a}} locomotive.|$|E
50|$|Although the <b>drive</b> <b>chains</b> held up admirably, {{the car was}} {{not without}} its problems. The {{tremendous}} amount of power at the front wheels caused massive torque steer, resulting in difficulty in keeping the car in a straight line. The rear engine contributed to unloading of the front wheels, which in turn caused the front engine to overspeed. Visibility was poor as well due to tire smoke from {{both ends of the}} car. This coupled with engine oil spray out of the valve cover breathers because of the pressure of the superchargers.|$|E
50|$|The {{efficiency}} of converting {{a unit of}} fuel to rotation of the driving wheels includes many points of friction loss and heat loss through the exhaust or cooling system. Friction inside the engine happens along the cylinder walls, crankshaft rod bearings and main bearings, camshaft bearings, <b>drive</b> <b>chains</b> or gears, plus other miscellaneous and minor bearing surfaces. An electric motor has internal friction only at the main axle bearings. Friction outside the motor/engine includes loads from the generator / alternator, power steering pump, A/C compressor, transmission, transfer case (if four-wheel-drive), differential(s) and universal joints, plus rolling resistance of the pneumatic tires.|$|E
5000|$|In 1922 {{the belt}} drive was {{replaced}} by a conventional three-speed gearbox and <b>chain</b> <b>drive.</b> [...] The <b>chain</b> <b>drive</b> car was in 1923 joined by a shaft drive model with the engine turned through 90 degrees.|$|R
40|$|It {{is shown}} {{analytically}} that pulse solitary waves {{in a chain}} with Lennard-Jones type nearest neighbor interaction are strongly localized and marginally stable in the high energy limit. In a damped and periodically <b>driven</b> <b>chain</b> we obtain numerically families of states whose behavior {{is similar to that}} of equally many oscillators. We observe a period doubling sequence in a one-solitary wave family and bifurcation to (quasi-) periodic motion in a family of two solitary waves. We conclude that the damped and <b>driven</b> <b>chain</b> admits asymptotically stable states living on a low-dimensional manifold in phase space. These results depend sensitively on the shape of the driving term...|$|R

5000|$|Plymouth {{locomotives}} {{were first}} built in 1910 by the J. D. Fate Company, which became Fate-Root-Heath in 1919.The J.D. Fate patent application filed in 1917 shows theengine driving a clutch and a {{continuously variable transmission}} that allowed varying the speed through zero to reverse the locomotive. The output of the transmission drove a transverse jackshaft through a chain drive, with additional <b>drive</b> <b>chains</b> to the two driving axles. [...] All early Plymouth locomotives used this drive scheme. [...] The Fate-Root-Heath patent application filed in 1925 shows a far-more conventional 4-speed transmission and reverse gears driving the jackshaft and final chain drive to the 2 driving axles.|$|E
5000|$|Storm 2's next {{battle was}} to prove {{one of the}} most {{controversial}} of all. Storm 2 charged into Typhoon 2 and used its lifting arm. Typhoon 2 ran away, before smashing part of the arena wall. The plan was to edit out this part of the fight as if it never happened, although Typhoon 2 refused to spin, so Mentorn allowed Typhoon 2 to repair. Team Storm were surprised at this, but once the wall was fixed, the fight carried on much the same (although the part of the fight showing Typhoon 2 careering into the wall was still shown in the televised fight) until, at the end of the fight, a small panel fell off Storm 2. Cease was called, and, after a difficult judges decision, Typhoon 2 was given the win. Team Storm were deeply annoyed by this, especially since Typhoon 2 was listed as [...] "no damage", despite the fact that its <b>drive</b> <b>chains</b> were scattered all over the arena floor. Team Storm were also saddened by the fact that the show concentrated on Storm 2's aforementioned panel and not Typhoon 2's <b>drive</b> <b>chains,</b> despite losing the latter having a larger difference than losing a small panel. Some Storm 2 supporters called for Gary Cairns, captain of Team Typhoon, to hand his trophy to Team Storm, but the decision stood. The booing from the crowd (save for the small group of Typhoon 2 supporters, who were cheering in delight) was so loud that Mentorn had to add canned applause to hide the booing.|$|E
50|$|Sometimes {{the power}} is output by simply {{rotating}} the chain, {{which can be used}} to lift or drag objects. In other situations, a second gear is placed and {{the power is}} recovered by attaching shafts or hubs to this gear. Though <b>drive</b> <b>chains</b> are often simple oval loops, they can also go around corners by placing more than two gears along the chain; gears that do not put power into the system or transmit it out are generally known as idler-wheels. By varying the diameter of the input and output gears with respect to each other, the gear ratio can be altered. For example, when the bicycle pedals' gear rotate once, it causes the gear that drives the wheels to rotate more than one revolution.|$|E
50|$|Because their {{polymerization}} is stochastically <b>driven,</b> <b>chain</b> {{lengths in}} any real population of synthetic polymers will obey a statistical distribution. In that case, {{we should take}} N to be an average value. Also, many polymers have random branching.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} tandem {{crankset}} {{is a set}} of four cranks. Both left cranks have spiders and chainrings to be connected by a timing chain, and only one of the right cranks has a spider for the <b>drive</b> <b>chain.</b>|$|R
50|$|A <b>drive</b> <b>chain</b> was {{developed}} to replace the belt drive and although production was delayed by the First World War the Model 16 as it became known gained a Sturmey Archer gearbox and had a racing heritage that included 21 world records.|$|R
5000|$|Following this {{singular}} success, {{the company}} offered steam tricycles with boilers between {{the front wheels}} and two-cylinder engines. They were built in small numbers, evidently a favorite of young playboys. They were later joined by a larger tractor, able to pull trailers (sometimes called a [...] "steam drag"). This larger vehicle introduced the so-called De Dion or [...] "dead" [...] axle; an axle beam carried {{the weight of the}} vehicle with the non weight-bearing driveshafts or <b>drive</b> <b>chains</b> articulated separately alongside it.(footnote: The live axle carries the weight by a rigid tube around the driveshaft, both parts fastened together.) On July 22, 1894, Paris-Rouen race, it averaged 18.7 km/h over the 126 km (78 mi) route, but was disqualified for needing both a driver and a stoker.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{interest}} of simplicity, all models used a friction-drive transmission. A roller (a metal wheel with a rubber surface vulcanized to increase its grip) on the front sprocket shaft was pressed against the machined rear surface of the engine flywheel, thus driving the sprocket shaft, the <b>drive</b> <b>chains</b> and the rear wheels. Moving the shift lever set the drive roller to various positions on the flywheel, either nearer the center or nearer the edge, effectively changing the [...] "gear ratio" [...] for climbing hills or driving on level roads. Moving the roller past the center point spun it backwards to give reverse gear. The front sprocket drive shaft was free to slide forward and backwards slightly, just enough to allow the roller {{to move away from}} the flywheel. The [...] "clutch pedal" [...] worked differently from most other cars, in that the operator had to hold their foot on the pedal to keep the roller pressed against the flywheel (the catalog claimed that the weight of the operator’s foot was sufficient to provide forward motion). Removing the foot from the pedal allowed the roller to spring back from the flywheel, effectively providing [...] "neutral" [...] so the car could be cranked without moving forwards.|$|E
40|$|International audienceOff-line robot dynamic {{identification}} methods use the Inverse Dynamic Identification Model (IDIM), which calculates {{the motor}} torques that are linear {{in relation to}} the dynamic parameters of both links and <b>drive</b> <b>chains,</b> and use linear least squares technique (IDIM-LS technique). For most robots, the only available data are the motor position and the motor torques which are calculated as the product of the known current reference signal by the joint drive gains. Then the accuracy of links parameters may be limited by noise and error modeling in the <b>drive</b> <b>chains.</b> The Kuka LWR robot (industrial version IIWA: Intelligent Industrial Work Assistant) gives the possibility for an industrial robot to investigate this problem using the joint torque sensors data, measured at the output of the harmonic drive geared <b>drive</b> <b>chains,</b> to identify only the links inertial parameters without the errors coming from the <b>drive</b> <b>chains.</b> This paper focuses on the comparison of the accuracy of the identification of the dynamic parameters of the rigid model of the LWR 4 + version, which is very popular in robotics research, using measures of the motor positions and the motor currents, or the torque sensors measurements or both side data. This paper is giving a first complete and reliable identified rigid dynamic model of the LWR 4 +, publicly available for the robotics community. Moreover, this work shows {{for the first time the}} strong result that motor torques calculated from motor currents can identify the links inertial parameters with the same accuracy than using joint torque sensors at the output of the joint <b>drive</b> <b>chains...</b>|$|E

5000|$|The rear {{suspension}} pivot (like the Hesketh V1000) was co-axial with the drive sprocket to maintain constant chain tension. This feature meant that (i) a smaller <b>drive</b> <b>chain</b> {{could be used}} and/or (ii) the chain was less stressed and therefore less likely to break.|$|R
