The <b>heatshield</b> on the Stardust SRC was a 0. 83 m sphere cone, fabricated from a single piece of 5. 82 cm-thick PICA. The <b>heatshield</b> performed successfully during Earth reentry of the SRC in January 2006. Material response analyses of the full, axisymmetric PICA <b>heatshield</b> were run using the Two-Dimensional Implicit Ablation, Pyrolysis, and Thermal Response Program (TITAN). Peak surface temperatures were predicted to be 3385 K, while the temperature at the PICA backface remained at the estimated initial cold-soak temperature of 278 K. Surface recession and temperature distribution results from TITAN, at several points in the reentry trajectory, were mapped onto an axisymmetric finite element model of the <b>heatshield.</b> We used the finite element model to predict the thermal stresses in the PICA from differential thermal expansion. The predicted peak compressive stress in the PICA <b>heatshield</b> was 1. 38 MPa. Although this level of stress exceeded the chosen design limit for compressive stresses in PICA tiles for the design of the Orion crew exploration vehicle <b>heatshield,</b> the Stardust <b>heatshield</b> exhibited no obvious mechanical failures from thermal stress.

Conceptual studies have been undertaken to determine if new, nanostructured materials (composites of existing TPS materials and nanostructured composite fibers) could improve the performance of TPS. To this end, we have studied various candidate <b>heatshields,</b> some composed of existing TPS materials (with known material properties), to provide a baseline for comparison with others that are admixtures of such materials and a nanostructured material.

Early assessments of the environments led engineers down the path to "fly as we've always flown", with the heritage Mars <b>heatshield</b> material, SLA- 561 V. Screening tests in arc jet facilities in stagnation model configurations substantiated the claims that the SLA- 561 V could survive high heating rates expected on the <b>heatshield,</b> albeit, with a melting surface. However, due to the size and mass of the vehicle, along with the need to reenter at angle of attack, high heating and high shear in turbulent flow was predicted on the leeward side of the vehicle.

40|$|The Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle {{will one}} day carry astronauts to the Moon and beyond, and Orion's <b>heatshield</b> is a {{critical}} component in ensuring their safe return to Earth. The Orion <b>heatshield</b> is the structural component responsible for absorbing the intense heating environment caused by re-entry to Earth's atmosphere. The <b>heatshield</b> is primarily composed of Avcoat, an ablative material that is consumed during the re-entry process. Ablation is primarily characterized by two processes: pyrolysis and recession. The decomposition of in-depth virgin material is known as pyrolysis. Recession occurs when the exposed surface of the <b>heatshield</b> reacts with the surrounding flow. The Orion <b>heatshield</b> design was changed from an individually filled Avcoat honeycomb to a molded block Avcoat design. The molded block Avcoat <b>heatshield</b> relies on an adhesive bond to keep it attached to the capsule. In some locations on the <b>heatshield,</b> {{the integrity of the}} adhesive bond cannot be verified. For these locations, a mechanical retention device was proposed. Avcoat ablation was modelled in CHAR and the in-depth virgin material temperatures were used in a Thermal Desktop model of the mechanical retention device. The retention device was analyzed and shown to cause a large increase in the maximum bondline temperature. In order to study the impact of individual ablation modelling parameters on the <b>heatshield</b> sizing process, a Monte Carlo simulation of the sizing process was proposed. The simulation will give the sensitivity of the ablation model to each of its input parameters. As part of the Monte Carlo simulation, statistical uncertainties on material properties were required for Avcoat. Several properties were difficult to acquire uncertainties for: the pyrolysis gas enthalpy, non-dimensional mass loss rate (Bc), and Arrhenius equation parameters. Variability in the elemental composition of Avcoat was used as the basis for determining the statistical uncertainty in pyrolysis gas enthalpy and Bc. A MATLAB program was developed to allow for faster, more accurate and automated computation of Arrhenius reaction parameters. These parameters are required for a material model {{to be used in the}} CHAR ablation analysis program. This MATLAB program, along with thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) data, was used to generate uncertainties on the Arrhenius parameters for Avcoat. In addition, the TGA fitting program was developed to provide Arrhenius parameters for the ablation model of the gap filler material, RTV silicone...|$|R
40|$|Modeling of roughness-dominated {{transition}} {{is a critical}} design issue for both ablating and non-ablating thermal protection systems (TPS). Ablating TPS, used for planetary-entry and earth-return missions, first experience recession under high-altitude, low-Reynolds-number conditions. Such laminar-flow ablation causes {{the formation of a}} surface microroughness pattern characteristic of the TPS material composition and fabrication process. For non-ablating TPS, such as the overlapping-tile, metallic <b>heatshields</b> proposed for future reusable launch vehicles, the surface roughness pattern is established a priori by the engineering design and assembly procedure. In both cases, these distributed surface roughness patterns create disturbances within, and alter the mean velocity profile of, the laminar boundary layer flowing over the surface. As altitude decreases, Reynolds number increases, and flow field conditions capable of amplifying these roughness-induced perturbations are eventually achieved, i. e., transition onset occurs. Boundary layer transition to turbulence results in more severe heat-transfer rates.
