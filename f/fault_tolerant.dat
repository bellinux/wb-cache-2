25|$|Quasi-opportunistic {{supercomputing}} aims {{to provide}} a higher quality of service than opportunistic resource sharing. The quasi-opportunistic approach enables the execution of demanding applications within computer grids by establishing grid-wise resource allocation agreements; and <b>fault</b> <b>tolerant</b> message passing to abstractly shield against {{the failures of the}} underlying resources, thus maintaining some opportunism, while allowing a higher level of control.|$|E
25|$|The scarce {{resources}} {{in a telephone}} switch are the connections between layers of subswitches. The control logic has to allocate these connections, and most switches {{do so in a}} way that is <b>fault</b> <b>tolerant.</b> See nonblocking minimal spanning switch for a discussion of the Charles Clos algorithm, used in many telephone switches, and a very important algorithm to the telephone industry.|$|E
25|$|The Domain Name System delegates the {{responsibility}} of assigning domain names and mapping those names to Internet resources by designating authoritative name servers for each domain. Network administrators may delegate authority over sub-domains of their allocated name space to other name servers. This mechanism provides distributed and <b>fault</b> <b>tolerant</b> service and was designed to avoid a single large central database.|$|E
25|$|Find an {{efficient}} (high-performance and <b>fault</b> <b>tolerant)</b> method to enforce Global serializability (global conflict serializability) in a heterogeneous distributed environment of multiple autonomous database systems. The database systems may employ different concurrency control methods. No limitation should {{be imposed on}} the operations of either local transactions (confined to a single database system) or global transactions (span two or more database systems).|$|E
25|$|The {{objective}} of Byzantine fault tolerance {{is to be}} able to defend against Byzantine failures, in which components of a system fail with symptoms that prevent some components of the system from reaching agreement among themselves, where such agreement is needed for the correct operation of the system. Correctly functioning components of a Byzantine <b>fault</b> <b>tolerant</b> system will be able to provide the system's service, assuming there are not too many faulty components.|$|E

2500|$|Commitment {{ordering}} (or Commit ordering; CO) is {{the only}} high-performance, <b>fault</b> <b>tolerant,</b> conflict serializability providing solution that has been proposed as a fully distributed (no central computing component or data-structure are needed), general mechanism that can be combined seamlessly with any local (to a database) concurrency control mechanism (see technical summary). Since the CO property of a schedule is {{a necessary condition for}} global serializability of autonomous databases (in the context of concurrency control), it provides the only general solution for autonomous databases (i.e., if autonomous databases do not comply with CO, then global serializability may be violated). Seemingly by sheer luck, the CO solution possesses many attractive properties: ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{signalling}} {{technology used}} {{on all three}} SkyTrain lines to run trains automatically was originally developed by Alcatel, and loaded from a 3.5" [...] diskette. There are four systems called the VCC (Vehicle Control Computer) with three divided over the mainline {{and one for the}} storage yard. VCC1 controls trains from Waterfront to Royal Oak; VCC2 controls trains from Royal Oak to King George (it now also controls a portion of the Millennium line); and VCC3 controls trains in the yard. Each VCC is a cluster of three IBM rack-mount computers with Intel-IA32 processors and proprietary hardware, configured in a <b>fault</b> <b>tolerant</b> setup. For every command that is sent to a VCC, {{at least two of the}} computers must agree with the action, otherwise an error is generated and the command is ignored. The VCCs communicates with the train's VOBC (Vehicle On Board Computer), whose data is transmitted through leaky coax cable laid along the tracks. There are up to two VOBCs per married-pair trains, i.e., 4-car train would have two VOBCs. If the VCCs fail or communication between the VCC and the VOBC is lost, the train will 'time-out' and (EB) emergency-brake through a Quester Tangent BAM (Brake Assurance Monitor) that controls propulsion and braking systems. The VCCs have a command-line-console, but normally the trains are controlled through a system known as the SMC, which also provides scheduling. All commands from the SMC are verified to be safe by the VCC before execution. However if the SMC fails, the system can still be operated through the VCC. This is known as 'degraded mode'. The SkyTrain HMU (Health Monitoring Unit) developed by Quester Tangent [...] provides monitoring and diagnostic functionality for vehicle maintenance by connecting to CAN vehicle network and providing a maintenance display in the Hoslter Panel.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the area}} of <b>fault</b> <b>tolerant</b> control systems, the main {{contribution}} of Jakob Stoustrup has been to introduce a number of optimization based methods in order to solve fault diagnosis and <b>fault</b> <b>tolerant</b> control problems.The results include explicit methods for time-varying, non-linear, and uncertain systems {{for the design of}} fault diagnosis and <b>fault</b> <b>tolerant</b> control systems. Inspired by his previous work in {{the area of}} robust control theory, Jakob Stoustrup and his co-workers has proposed a general architecture for the modeling and design of fault diagnosis and <b>fault</b> <b>tolerant</b> control systems, handling the above-mentioned challenges.|$|E
