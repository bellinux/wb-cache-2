The lace monitor (Varanus varius) and red fox (Vulpes vulpes) are nest predators. Baby birds may perish by overheating in very hot weather, or by being drowned in the hollows after heavy rain.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the course}} of his lifetime, Grinsell {{examined}} and catalogued around 10,000 barrows and advanced the archaeological understanding of such monuments. His use of non-excavatory <b>fieldwork</b> influenced much British archaeology {{in the latter part of}} his 20th century, while his willingness to pay attention to other sources of information, such as folklore and place-names, has been deemed to be ahead of his time.|$|E

5|$|A {{field study}} of the {{invasion}} of the pathogen Phytophthora cinnamomi into the Brisbane Ranges National Park in Victoria in 1971 indicated that Epacris impressa was moderately susceptible to the pathogen. Inoculation of seedlings confirmed this. <b>Fieldwork</b> in the Brisbane Ranges National Park in 1985 showed that there was some evidence that E. impressa seedlings were able to recolonise areas that had been infested with P. cinnamomi a decade before.|$|E
5|$|According to Perry Link, {{pressure}} on Western institutions also takes more subtle forms, including academic self-censorship, whereby research on Falun Gong is avoided {{because it could}} result in a denial of visas for <b>fieldwork</b> in China. Ethan Gutmann also noted that media organizations and human rights groups also self-censor on the topic, given the PRC government's attitude toward the practice, and the potential repercussions that may follow for making overt representations on Falun Gong's behalf.|$|E

5|$|Archaeologists {{have been}} aware of ancient sites in the area since at least the 1940s; early work {{occurred}} at Aspero on the coast, a site identified as early as 1905, and later at Caral further inland. In the late 1990s, Peruvian archaeologists, led by Ruth Shady, provided the first extensive documentation of the civilization with work at Caral. A 2001 paper in Science, providing a survey of the Caral research, and a 2004 article in Nature, describing <b>fieldwork</b> and radiocarbon dating across a wider area, revealed Norte Chico's full significance and led to widespread interest.|$|E
5|$|Carson rose {{within the}} Fish and Wildlife Service, by 1945 supervising a small writing staff and in 1949 {{becoming}} chief editor of publications. Though her position provided increasing opportunities for <b>fieldwork</b> and freedom in choosing her writing projects, it also entailed increasingly tedious administrative responsibilities. By 1948, Carson {{was working on}} material for a second book, and had made the conscious decision to begin a transition to writing full-time. That year, she took on a literary agent, Marie Rodell; they formed a close professional relationship that would last the rest of Carson's career.|$|E

5|$|<b>Fieldwork</b> in 1996 {{turned up}} a spectacularly {{complete}} theropod skull preserved in exquisite detail (FMNH PR 2100). On top of this skull was a dome-shaped swelling nearly {{identical to the one}} described by Sues and Taquet as Majungatholus atopus. Majungatholus was redescribed as an abelisaurid rather than a pachycephalosaur in 1998. Although the name Majungasaurus crenatissimus was older than Majungatholus atopus, the authors judged the type dentary of Majungasaurus too fragmentary to confidently assign to the same species as the skull. Further <b>fieldwork</b> over the next decade {{turned up a}} series of less complete skulls, as well as dozens of partial skeletons of individuals ranging from juveniles to adults. Project members also collected hundreds of isolated bones and thousands of shed Majungasaurus teeth. Taken together, these remains represent nearly all the bones of the skeleton, although most of the forelimbs, most of the pelvis and the tip of the tail are still unknown. This <b>fieldwork</b> culminated in a 2007 monograph consisting of seven scientific papers on all aspects of the animal's biology, published in the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology Memoirs. The papers are in English, although each has an abstract written in Malagasy. In this volume, the dentary described by Lavocat was re-evaluated and determined to be diagnostic for this species. Therefore, the name Majungatholus was replaced by the older name Majungasaurus. Although the monograph is comprehensive, the editors noted that it describes only material recovered from 1993 through 2001. A significant quantity of specimens, some very complete, were excavated in 2003 and 2005 and await preparation and description in future publications. The dentary was made the neotype specimen after a 2009 petition to the ICZN.|$|E
5|$|Outside {{of these}} {{breeding}} efforts, Finnish horses were widely kept in semi-feral conditions through the mid-19th century. Ethnologist Kustaa Vilkuna describes how all horses regardless or sex and age were let out on forest pastures {{for the summer}} after the spring <b>fieldwork</b> was finished. The pasture was scarce and the terrain challenging, with both rocky ground and wetlands. Vilkuna considers this practice {{an important factor in}} making the Finnhorse an easy-keeping, hardy breed.|$|E
5|$|Palatography {{involves}} {{the painting of}} a colored substance onto the tongue which is then transferred onto the palate during articulation. A picture is then taken of the palate to record the location of contact and, if another palatogram is to be taken, the mouth is washed out and the tongue repainted. A particularly low cost method that is often used in <b>fieldwork,</b> {{it can be difficult}} to collect large amounts of data.|$|E

50|$|The {{project began}} when canvassers {{walked off the}} job at the Campaign for the Restoration and Regulation of Hemp, citing {{mismanagement}} and late paychecks. The campaign spread {{a few weeks later}} to Grassroots Campaigns, Inc., a fundraiser for NGOs and political action committees, with workers alleging violation of the Portland sick day ordinance, as well as extremely high turnover due to their $130 a day fundraising quota. The campaign then spread to <b>Fieldworks,</b> LLC, a field organizing contractor. Union supporters discovered that the voter registration drive <b>Fieldworks</b> was employing them in was funded by AFSCME and several other trade unions.The union has attracted controversy for militant demands submitted to management, including a demand for free medical marijuana from the chief petitioners of the Campaign for the Restoration and Regulation of Hemp.|$|R
5|$|Remains of Brachytarsomys mahajambaensis {{were found}} during <b>fieldwork</b> in northwestern Madagascar {{that started in}} 2001.
