Both {{mainstream}} press and science fiction reviewers generally credit Eccleston and his <b>incarnation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> character as helping to re-establish the show following its hiatus between 1996 and 2005. The character's interactions with his archenemies, the Daleks, were particularly praised. Eccleston won several awards for his single series including the 2005 National Television Award for best actor.|$|E

5|$|The {{belief of}} many {{followers}} that their founder was the <b>incarnation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Supreme God has also drawn criticism. According to Professor Raymond B. Williams, Swaminarayan was criticized because he received large gifts from his followers and dressed and traveled as a Maharaja {{even though he}} had taken the vows of renunciation of the world. Swaminarayan responded that he accepts gifts for the emancipation of his followers.|$|E
5|$|George is a {{supporting}} character {{who appeared in}} various adaptations of the BBC sitcom Blackadder, played by Hugh Laurie. Each series saw a different <b>incarnation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> character, because each was set in a different period of history.

The character was added to the series as a replacement for the Lord Percy Percy character, who did not appear in the third instalment because Tim McInnerny, the actor playing him, feared being typecast.|$|E

5|$|In the prologue, John {{identifies}} Jesus as the Logos (Word). In Ancient Greek philosophy, {{the term}} logos meant {{the principle of}} cosmic reason. In this sense, it {{was similar to the}} Hebrew concept of Wisdom, God's companion and intimate helper in creation. The Hellenistic Jewish philosopher Philo merged these two themes when he described the Logos as God's creator of and mediator with the material world. The evangelist adapted Philo's description of the Logos, applying it to Jesus, the <b>incarnation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Logos.|$|E

2500|$|<b>The</b> number <b>of</b> {{previous}} <b>incarnations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Doctor was {{at first}} unclear within the series. In the Fourth Doctor story <b>The</b> Brain <b>of</b> Morbius, <b>the</b> Doctor participates in a mental ‘duel’ with another Time Lord and the machine to which their minds are connected begins to project <b>the</b> faces <b>of</b> <b>the</b> [...] "losing" [...] contestant’s regenerations in chronologically descending order. As the Doctor is overpowered by Morbius, the images change successively to those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> third, second and first Doctors, then eight further faces appear. It was <b>the</b> intention <b>of</b> producer Philip Hinchcliffe and script editor Robert Holmes that images were even earlier <b>incarnations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Doctor. However, the narrative does not explicitly confirm that the faces do represent <b>incarnations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Doctor, even though, as the faces are shown, Morbius cries [...] "How far Doctor? How long have you lived?", indicating {{that they are not}} <b>incarnations</b> <b>of</b> Morbius, but rather that it is the Doctor's past being shown.|$|R

5|$|The Ninth Doctor is an <b>incarnation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Doctor, {{the protagonist}} of the BBC science fiction {{television}} programme Doctor Who. He is portrayed by Christopher Eccleston during the first series of the show's revival in 2005. Within the programme's narrative, the Doctor is a time travelling, humanoid alien from a race known as the Time Lords. When the Doctor is critically injured, he can regenerate his body but in doing so gains a new physical appearance and with it, a distinct new personality.|$|E
5|$|The Smallville <b>incarnation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{character}} is first introduced as a morally ambiguous character, who walks {{a fine line}} between good and evil. Lex is an inquisitive person, and it is that curiosity that drives him to attain as much power as possible as the series progresses—it will ultimately lead him to being Clark's greatest enemy. Michael Rosenbaum has been nominated for and won a Saturn Award and a Teen Choice Award for his portrayal of Lex Luthor on Smallville. After seven seasons as a series regular, Michael Rosenbaum left the show, but reprised the role for the two-hour series finale.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} {{to release a}} Game Boy <b>incarnation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mega Man series came {{after the release of}} Mega Man 3 on the NES. Early reports of Dr. Wily's Revenge were made in February 1991 in both the magazine GamePro and Steven A. Schwartz's book The Official Guide to Mega Man. The North American version of this game and the first DOS Mega Man game share a similar cover art. Instead of being an all new illustration, the Dr. Wily's Revenge North American artwork is a simple touch-up of Mega Man 3s regional cover, with the surrounding landscape and robot masters cropped out of the picture.|$|E

5|$|The first <b>incarnation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Doctor {{was portrayed}} by William Hartnell. During Hartnell's tenure, the episodes were {{a mixture of}} stories set on earth of the future with {{extraterrestrial}} influence, on alien planets, and in historical events without extraterrestrial influence, such as Marco Polo, one of the lost serials. In his last story, The Tenth Planet, the Doctor gradually grew weaker {{to the point of}} collapsing {{at the end of the}} fourth episode, leading to his regeneration.|$|E
5|$|The {{late nineteenth}} century was marked by a great {{increase}} in the number of local historical societies in India and a similar {{increase in the number}} of Indians who could speak and write English, to the extent that by the 1920s the entire journal could have been filled with work by Indian contributors. Volumes for 1925 to 1932 were published under the authority of the Council of the Royal Anthropological Institute (1933, not). The first <b>incarnation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Antiquary ceased publication in 1933 with volume 62, number 783 (Dec. 1933), two years after Richard Temple's death in 1931. Several early volumes of the journal were reprinted by Swati Publications in Delhi, 1984.|$|E
5|$|The series {{used the}} first <b>incarnation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Blackadder theme by Howard Goodall (with the {{exception}} of the unaired pilot, which featured a different arrangement). For the opening theme, a trumpet solo accompanied by an orchestra was used. For the end titles, the theme gained mock-heroic lyrics sung by a baritone (Simon Carrington, a member of the King's Singers). In the final episode, the theme was sung with altered lyrics by a treble, in a more reflective style. The series' incidental music was unusually performed by pipe organ and percussion.|$|E
50|$|Guns formed his own <b>incarnation</b> <b>of</b> L.A. Guns in 2006, which {{initially}} featured Paul Black on lead vocals. This version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{band was}} active through 2012.
