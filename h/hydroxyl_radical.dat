5|$|The {{reactive}} {{oxygen species}} produced in cells include hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), hypochlorous acid (HClO), and free radicals such as the <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>radical</b> (·OH) and the superoxide anion (O2−). The <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>radical</b> is particularly unstable and will react rapidly and non-specifically with most biological molecules. This species is produced from hydrogen peroxide in metal-catalyzed redox reactions such as the Fenton reaction. These oxidants can damage cells by starting chemical chain reactions such as lipid peroxidation, or by oxidizing DNA or proteins. Damage to DNA can cause mutations and possibly cancer, if not reversed by DNA repair mechanisms, while damage to proteins causes enzyme inhibition, denaturation and protein degradation.|$|E
5|$|These {{reactive}} {{oxygen species}} and their reaction products, such as the <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>radical,</b> are very harmful to cells, as they oxidize proteins and cause mutations in DNA. This cellular damage might contribute to disease and is proposed as one cause of aging.|$|E

High concentrations of oxygen also increase the formation of other free radicals, such as nitric oxide, peroxynitrite, and trioxidane, which harm DNA and other biomolecules. Although the body has many antioxidant systems such as glutathione that guard against oxidative stress, these systems are eventually overwhelmed at very high concentrations of free oxygen, and the rate of cell damage exceeds the capacity of the systems that prevent or repair it. Cell damage and cell death then result.|$|E

Inhaled particulate matter can trigger formation of <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>radicals,</b> {{which have been}} implicated {{as one of the}} causes of particulate-induced lung disease. The extreme reactivity of <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>radicals</b> presents challenges to their detection and quantification. Here, three fluorescein derivatives [aminophenyl fluorescamine (APF), amplex ultrared, and dichlorofluorescein (DCFH) ] and two radical species, proxyl fluorescamine and tempo- 9 -ac have been compared for their usefulness to measure <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>radicals</b> generated in two different systems: a solution containing ferrous iron and a suspension of pyrite particles. Results APF, amplex ultrared, and DCFH react similarly to the presence of <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>radicals.</b> Proxyl fluorescamine and tempo- 9 -ac do not react with <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>radicals</b> directly, which reduces their sensitivity. Since both DCFH and amplex ultrared will react with reactive oxygen species other than <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>radicals</b> and another highly reactive species, peroxynitite, they lack specificity. Conclusion The most useful probe evaluated here for <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>radicals</b> formed from cell-free particle suspensions is APF due to its sensitivity and selectivity. </p...|$|R
40|$|A {{new method}} for the {{determination}} of <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>radicals</b> is proposed.

In the hybrid molecule, the nitroxide quenches the fluorescence of anthracene strongly. The reaction of <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>radicals</b> with dimethyl sulfoxide generates quantitatively methyl radicals, which then combine with the nitroxide moiety of the hybrid molecules to result in an increase in the fluorescence intensity. The fluorescence increase is proportional to the concentration of <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>radicals.</b> The proposed method is capable of detecting <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>radicals</b> generated in the Fenton system.

25|$|Both {{the harmful}} effects of {{radiation}} upon biological systems (induction of cancer and acute radiation injuries) and the useful effects of radiotherapy involve the radiation chemistry of water. The vast majority of biological molecules are present in an aqueous medium; when water is exposed to radiation, the water absorbs energy, and as a result forms chemically reactive species that can interact with dissolved substances (solutes). Water is ionized to form a solvated electron and H2O+, the H2O+ cation can react with water to form a hydrated proton (H3O+) and a <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>radical</b> (HO.). Furthermore, the solvated electron can recombine with the H2O+ cation to form an excited state of the water, this excited state then decomposes to species such as hydroxyl radicals (HO.), hydrogen atoms (H.) and oxygen atoms (O.). Finally, the solvated electron can react with solutes such as solvated protons or oxygen molecules to form respectively hydrogen atoms and dioxygen radical anions. The fact that oxygen changes the radiation chemistry might be one reason why oxygenated tissues are more sensitive to irradiation than the deoxygenated tissue at the centre of a tumor. The free radicals, such as the <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>radical,</b> chemically modify biomolecules such as DNA, leading to damage such as breaks in the DNA strands. Some substances can protect against radiation-induced damage by reacting with the reactive species generated by the irradiation of the water.|$|E
