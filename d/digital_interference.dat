40|$|The spread {{spectrum}} modulation presents a more robust interference rejection capability than the non code-based modulations. However, the increasing {{of the communication}} services has augmented {{the power of the}} interference signals. In particular, the unlicensed bands such as the Industrial Scientific and Medical (ISM) can seriously saturate the interference rejection capability of the {{spread spectrum}} systems. To overcome this drawback it is possible to resort to an Interference Canceller (IC) previously to the detection.

However, in general both criteria present a high computational burden which reduces their real feasibility. In addition, the communication scenery can be corrupted by Gaussian or Non-Gaussian noise, which makes more complex the structure of the optimum detector.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} combines various holographic techniques with application on the two- and {{three-dimensional imaging}} of ophthalmic tissue, fingerprints, and microsphere samples with micrometer resolution. <b>Digital</b> <b>interference</b> holography (DIH) uses scanned wavelengths to synthesize short-coherence interference tomographic images. We used DIH for in vitro imaging of human optic nerve head and retina. Tomographic images were produced by superposition of holograms. Holograms were obtained with a signal-to-noise ratio of approximately 50 dB. Optic nerve head characteristics (shape, diameter, cup depth, and cup width) were quantified {{with a few}} micron resolution (4. 06 - 4. 8 microns). Multiple layers were distinguishable in cross-sectional images of the macula. To our knowledge, {{this is the first}} report of DIH use to image human macular and optic nerve tissue. Holographic phase microscopy is used to produce images of thin film patterns left by latent fingerprints. Two or more holographic phase images with different wavelengths are combined for optical phase unwrapping of images of patent prints. We demonstrated <b>digital</b> <b>interference</b> holography images of a plastic print, and latent prints. These demonstrations point to significant contributions to biometry by using <b>digital</b> <b>interference</b> holography to identify and quantify Level 1 (pattern), Level 2 (minutia points), and Level 3 (pores and ridge contours). Quantitative studies of physical and biological processes and precise non-contact manipulation of nanometer/micrometer trapped objects can be effectuated with nanometer accuracy due to the development of optical tweezers. A three-dimensional gradient trap is produced at the focus position of a high NA microscope objective. Particles are trapped axially and laterally due to the gradient force. The particle is confined in a potential well and the trap acts as a harmonic spring. The elastic constant or the stiffness along any axis is determined from the particle displacements in time along each specific axis. Thus, we report the sensing of small particles using optical trapping in combination with the digital Gabor holography to calibrate the optical force and the position and of the copolymer microsphere in the x, y, z direction with nm precision...|$|E

40|$|The spread {{spectrum}} modulation presents a more robust interference rejection capability than non-code–based modulations. However, {{the increase of}} the communication services has aug-mented {{the power of the}} interference signals. One example is unlicensed bands such as the 2. 4 – 2. 5 GHz one, where the DS-CDMA communications of the IEEE 802. 11 b standard are interfered with by other Industrial Scientific and Medical (ISM) services. One way of improv-ing the interference robustness of the DS-CDMA receivers is introducing an interference canceler (IC) before the despreading stage. The optimum criterion to estimate or detect the interference is the maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) one. However, it requires a high computational burden and a complete knowledge of the statistical model, which reduce its feasibility. To overcome these drawbacks this article proposes an interference canceler based on Fuzzy Logic that allows (1) suppressing both analog and <b>digital</b> <b>interferences,</b> and (2) easily controlling the complexity versus performance trade-off. In other words, the design of the fuzzy canceler follows a down/ top strategy; that is, a first low complex design is possible just departing from linguistic infor-mation and, in a second stage, we refine it, incorporating the available statistical information into its structure. Finally, to assess the proposed fuzzy canceler we have derived asymptotic performance bounds. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. 1...|$|R

40|$|<b>Digital</b> <b>interference</b> {{microscopy}} {{is a new}} {{measuring technique}} with submicron horizontal resolution and nanometric vertical resolution, {{that can be used}} for the three-dimensional analysis of surface defects and device features in many microelectronics applications on bulk materials and epitaxial layers. In this paper we show how certain defects can be analysed on III-V materials and devices using two different interferometric techniques. The choice of the technique depends on the height and the slope of the surface features to be measured. We show that small defects less than λ/ 2 in height, or surfaces with shallow continuous slopes upto one or two microns high are best profiled with the phase stepping technique (PSM) because of the high vertical resolution of 1  nm and the higher speed and precision. This is illustrated by studies of the surface polish of InP wafers, defects after chemical etching of tin doped InP, defects on an epitaxial layer of GaAs on InP and quantum dot structures on GaAs. For measuring devices which contain mesas and grooves with step heights greater than λ/ 2, the peak fringe scanning (PFSM) method is the better choice. The vertical resolution is slightly less (4  nm), but the vertical range is higher (upto 15  μm) as demonstrated with the measurement of an etched groove in a laser/detector device on a quaternary layer on InP, and a MESFET device on GaAs. Compared with electron microscopy and the new near field scanning techniques, <b>digital</b> <b>interference</b> microscopy has the advantages of ease of use and speed of analysis and being able to resolve certain problems that are difficult or not possible by other means, such as profiling deep narrow etched grooves, or measuring the relief of a surface hidden under a transparent layer.

30|$|It {{used to be}} a {{fundamental}} belief that radio units cannot transmit and receive concurrently {{at the same time and}} frequency resources due to the self-interference (SI) [4], i.e., the duplexing of transmission and reception must be done by either frequency division duplex (FDD) or time division duplex (TDD). Both FDD and TDD have the disadvantage of wasting time and frequency resources [5]. However, recent advances in signal processing have made it possible to reduce the effect of SI, allowing IBFD wireless communications [6, 7].

The effectiveness of any <b>digital</b> <b>interference</b> cancellation technique depends strongly {{on the quality of the}} available channel estimates for both the SI and desired communication channels [12 – 14].

In this regard, a maximum-likelihood (ML) approach was proposed in [13] to jointly estimate the residual SI and communication channels by exploiting the known transmitted symbols and both the known pilot and unknown data symbols from the other intended transceiver.
