500|$|Even {{to the end}} of his life, Speer {{continued}} to question his actions under Hitler. In his final book, Infiltration, he asks, [...] "What would have happened if Hitler <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> to make decisions that required the utmost hardness?... How far would I have gone?... If I had occupied a different position, to what extent would I have ordered atrocities if Hitler had told me to do so?" [...] Speer leaves the questions unanswered.|$|E
500|$|Coincidentally Larry Hama, then {{an editor}} at Marvel, had begun to design {{characters}} and background for a series concept he was pitching that would be entitled Fury Force, about a team of futuristic super-soldiers affiliated with S.H.I.E.L.D., an existing Marvel Universe property combining military and science fiction genre elements. As Hama tells it, he got the job of writing for the series because Marvel had asked every other available creator to write it {{and no one else}} would. Unable to find other writing work, he later said that, [...] "If they <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> to write Barbie, I would have done that, too." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} {{published by the}} Evening Standard in two parts on 22 and 23 April 1970, McCartney said: [...] "The album was finished a year ago, but {{a few months ago}} American record producer Phil Spector was called in by Lennon to tidy up some of the tracks. But a few weeks ago, I was sent a re-mixed version of my song 'The Long and Winding Road' with harps, horns, an orchestra, and a women's choir added. No one <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> what I thought. I couldn't believe it." [...] The Beatles' usual producer, George Martin, called the remixes [...] "so uncharacteristic" [...] of the Beatles, while Johns, who was denied a production credit by Lennon, described Spector's embellishments as [...] "revolting … just puke".|$|E

500|$|Geoff Ryman wrote several award-winning {{novels and}} short stories that {{prominently}} feature LGBT characters: The protagonist of The Child Garden (1989), an outsider {{because of her}} resistance to genetic manipulation and her lesbianism, enters into {{a relationship with a}} similarly outcast lesbian polar bear. Lust (2001) follows a gay man who finds that his sexual fantasies are magically coming true. Was (1992) includes a gay actor with AIDS and a mentally-challenged abused child, linked by their connection to The Wizard of Oz books and film. In a Locus magazine interview Ryman claimed that the gay and SF genre markets are incompatible: “In 1990, if you <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> which was the worst thing to be labeled as, gay or an SF writer, I'd have said gay: kills you stone-dead in the market. Then Was came out.... They had it in the gay section of bookstores and they had stuff in gay magazines, but they didn't say SF — at which point I realized that being a science fiction writer is worse than being gay." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{the filmmakers}} watched the 1950 comedy film Champagne for Caesar to study Ronald Colman's {{performance}} as a possible model for Basil, they immediately decided to cast Vincent Price, who also starred in the film, as Ratigan. A veteran actor for fifty-two years, Price was willing to an audition commenting [...] "If anybody but Disney <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me,</b> I would have been offended." [...] Following a voice test, veteran voice artist Candy Candido recorded his dialogue for Fidget in one hour. To heighten the pitch, the tape recording of his voice was sped up. Candido's natural voice was kept for one character shouting [...] "Get off, you eight-legged bum." ...|$|E
2500|$|Keaton {{met with}} more {{success in the}} medium of still photography. Like her {{character}} in Annie Hall, Keaton had long relished photography as a favorite hobby, an interest she picked up as a teenager from her mother. While traveling in the late 1970s, she began exploring her avocation more seriously. [...] "Rolling Stone <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> to take photographs for them, and I thought, 'Wait a minute, what I'm really interested in is these lobbies, and these strange ballrooms in these old hotels.' So I began shooting them", she recalled in 2003. [...] "These places were deserted, and I could just sneak in anytime and nobody cared. It was so easy and I could do it myself. It was an adventure for me." [...] Reservations, her collection of photos of hotel interiors, was published in book form in 1980.|$|E

2500|$|In 1913 Man Ray and Samuel Halpert, {{another of}} Henri's students, started an artist's colony in Ridgefield, New Jersey. This colony was often also {{referred}} to as 'Grantwood' and comprised a number of clapboard shacks on a bluff on the Hudson Palisades opposite Grants Tomb, across the Hudson River in Manhattan. Kreymborg moved to Ridgefield and launched [...] with Skipwith Cannell, Wallace Stevens, and William Carlos Williams in 1915. Pound had, along with the Des Imagistes poems, written to Kreymborg suggesting that he contact 'old Bull' Williams, that is William Carlos Williams. Williams did not live far from Ridgefield, and he became involved in the magazine. Soon there was a group of artists associated with the magazine. Marianne Moore came to Ridgefield for picnics, and from 1915 Marcel Duchamp occasionally visited. Regarding Marianne Moore, she was asked in an interview whether Alfred Kreymborg was her American discoverer, to which she replied, [...] "It could be said, perhaps; he did all he could to promote me. Miss Monroe and the Aldingtons <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> simultaneously to contribute to Poetry and The Egoist in 1915. Alfred Kreymborg was not inhibited. I was a little different from the others. He thought that I might pass as a novelty, I guess." ...|$|E
