50|$|In 1928, Ray Kell {{from the}} United States' General Electric proved that <b>flying</b> <b>spot</b> <b>scanners</b> could work outdoors. The {{scanning}} light source must be brighter than other incident illumination.|$|R
50|$|The {{only way}} in {{practice}} {{to approach the}} theoretical sharpness possible in a digital imaging system such as a camera is to use more pixels in the camera sensor than samples in the final image, and 'downconvert' or 'interpolate' using special digital processing which cuts off high frequencies above the Nyquist rate to avoid aliasing whilst maintaining a reasonably flat MTF up to that frequency. This approach was first taken in the 1970s when <b>flying</b> <b>spot</b> <b>scanners,</b> and later CCD line scanners, were developed which sampled more pixels than were needed and then downconverted, which is why movies have always looked sharper on television than other material shot with a video camera. The only theoretically correct way to interpolate or downconvert is by use of a steep low-pass spatial filter, realized by convolution with a two-dimensional sin(x)/x weighting function which requires powerful processing. In practice, various mathematical approximations to this are used to reduce the processing requirement. These approximations are now implemented widely in video editing systems and in image processing programs such as Photoshop.|$|R
40|$|The angular Instantaneous Field Of View (IFOV) of {{rotating}} mirror is constant in <b>flying</b> <b>spot</b> <b>scanners</b> {{and as a}} result the more area is viewed by mirror with going out of nadir condition and it will cause gradually compression of the effective pixel size at the extremities of scan line. This error is known as panoramic error that is so more sensible in sensors which have high angular Field Of View (FOV). Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensorwith high FOV (110 o) has been complicated by the so-called bowtie effect. The source of error is panoramic distortion that is exacerbated by Earth curvature. This effect causes an overlap of the satellite scan lines producing a data repetition. Bow-tie prevents reaching both real shape and area of objects especially those that are far from the nadir and can be considered as a great systematic error especially for snow maps, dust and cloud researches. Due to lack of heeding utilization geometric source and mathematical transformations of panoramic distortion, former proposed algorithms for correction of bow-tie phenomenon were unnecessarily complicated. In this paper, a rigorous model is proposed in order to remove MODIS bowtie effect. The model is based on geometry projection of panoramic error with Earth curvature. The proposed method requires no ephemeris information and is established from the parameters of MODIS platform. The validity of the algorithm is verified by a scene including Urmia Lake in Iran. The results retrieved by the method demonstrated high both speed and accuracy...|$|R

50|$|P.M.G Toulon, a French {{inventor}} {{working at}} Westinghouse Electric during the 1950s and 1960s patented {{a system in}} 1952 (US Patent 3198880) which used a slow spinning disc with a spiral track of photographically 1.5 millimeter wide recorded frames, along with a <b>flying</b> <b>spot</b> <b>scanner,</b> which swept over them to produce a video image. This {{was intended to be}} synchronously combined with playback from a vinyl record. It appears a working system was never produced. It has similarities with the tape based Electronic Video Recording system, which was released for professional use.|$|E
50|$|The exposed film, either 35mm or 17.5mm (35mm {{split in}} half, to save expense), {{travelled}} {{in a continuous}} band from the camera, usually atop a remote broadcast vehicle, into a machine that developed and fixed the image. The film was then run through a <b>flying</b> <b>spot</b> <b>scanner</b> (so called because it moved a focused beam of light {{back and forth across}} the image), and electronically converted from a negative to a positive image. Depending on the equipment, the time from camera to scanner could be a minute or less. An optical soundtrack was recorded onto the film, between the perforations and the edge of the film, at the same time the image was taken to keep the sound and image in synchronization.|$|E
5000|$|In 1963, Crest Digital {{developed}} the first 35/32 printing equipment {{for use in}} motion picture labs. [...] The first closed captioning for the hearing impaired direct for home video cassette and videodisc release was introduced by Crest Digital (then called Crest National) in 1984. The company introduced the world's first 65/70mm <b>flying</b> <b>spot</b> <b>scanner</b> film transfer system, “Ultrascan 70™” in 1991. In 2002, the first Cineglyph HD large-format telecine was introduced. Royal Philips Electronics and Crest Digital partnered in May 2002 to develop and install the first Super Audio CD (SACD) hybrid disc production line {{in the country at}} Crest Digital's Hollywood facilities, with a production capacity of 3 million discs per year. Crest Digital also did the first MPEG encoding for in-flight films.|$|E

50|$|In a <b>flying</b> <b>spot</b> <b>scanner</b> (FSS) or {{cathode-ray}} tube (CRT) telecine, a pixel-sized {{light beam}} is projected through exposed and developed motion picture film (either negative or positive) and collected {{by a special}} type of photo-electric cell known as a photomultiplier which converts the light into an electrical signal. The beam of light “scans” across the film image {{from left to right}} to record the horizontal frame information. Vertical scanning of the frame is then accomplished by moving the film past the CRT beam. In a colour telecine the light from the CRT passes through the film and is separated by dichroic mirrors and filters into red, green and blue bands. Photomultiplier tubes or avalanche photodiodes convert the light into separate red, green and blue electrical signals for further electronic processing. This can be accomplished in “real time”, 24 frames per second (or in some cases faster). Rank Precision-Cintel introduced the “Mark” series of FSS telecines. During this time advances were also made in CRTs, with increased light output producing a better signal-to-noise ratio and so allowing negative film to be used.|$|E
50|$|Luna 3 was {{the first}} {{successful}} three-axis stabilized spacecraft. During most of the mission, the spacecraft was spin stabilized, but for photography of the Moon, the spacecraft oriented one axis toward the Sun and then a photocell was used to detect the Moon and orient the cameras towards it. Detection of the Moon signaled the camera cover to open and the photography sequence to start automatically. The images alternated between both cameras during the sequence. After photography was complete, the film was moved to an on-board processor where it was developed, fixed, and dried. Commands from the Earth were then given to move the film into a <b>flying</b> <b>spot</b> <b>scanner</b> where a spot produced by a cathode ray tube was projected through the film onto a photoelectric multiplier. The spot was scanned across the film and the photomultiplier converted {{the intensity of the}} light passing through the film into an electric signal which was transmitted to the Earth (via frequency-modulated analog video, similar to a facsimile). A frame could be scanned with a resolution of 1000 (horizontal) lines and the transmission could be done at a slow-scan television rate at large distances from the Earth and a faster rate at closer ranges.|$|E
50|$|The BBC's {{television}} service {{dates back}} to 1936 and was originally a nearly live-only medium. The hours of transmission were very limited and {{the bulk of the}} programming was transmitted either live from the studio, or from outside broadcast (OB) units; film was a minor contributor to the output. When the first television broadcasts were made, there were two competing systems in use. The EMI electronic system (using 405 lines) competed with the Baird 240-line mechanical television system. Baird adopted an intermediate film technique where the live material was filmed using a standard film camera mounted on a large cabinet which contained a rapid processing unit and an early <b>flying</b> <b>spot</b> <b>scanner</b> to produce the video output for transmission. The pioneer broadcasts were not, however, preserved on this intermediate film as the nitrate (celluloid) stock was scanned while still wet from the fixer bath and never washed to remove the fixer chemicals. Consequently, the film decomposed very soon after transmission; nothing is known to have survived.No studio or OB programmes from 1936 to 1939 or 1946 to 1947 have survived because there was no means of preserving them. Historical 'firsts' from this era; the world's earliest television crime drama Telecrime (1938-39 and 1946) or Pinwright's Progress (1946-47, the world's first regular situation comedy), only remain visually as a handful of still photographs.|$|E
40|$|Scan-in scan-out <b>flying</b> <b>spot</b> {{scanning}} system recognizes three {{different levels of}} transmissivity within a frame.
