5|$|The Canadian National Vimy Memorial {{site has}} {{considerable}} sociocultural significance for Canada. The idea that Canada's {{national identity and}} nationhood were born out of the Battle of Vimy Ridge is an opinion that is widely repeated in military and general histories of Canada. Historian Denise Thomson suggests that {{the construction of the}} Vimy memorial represents the culmination of an increasingly assertive nationalism that developed in Canada during the interwar period. Hucker suggests that the memorial transcends the Battle of Vimy Ridge and now serves as an enduring image of the whole First World War, while expressing the <b>enormous</b> <b>impact</b> of war in general, and also considers that the 2005 restoration project serves as evidence of a new generation's determination to remember Canada's contribution and sacrifice during the First World War.|$|E
5|$|The prince's {{early death}} (and the later demise of his younger brother) had an <b>enormous</b> <b>impact</b> on PedroII: on a {{personal}} level, on his future conduct as monarch, and on the empire. In his eyes, the deaths of his only sons seemed to presage {{the end of the}} imperial system. Although the emperor still had a legal successor in his daughter Isabel, in the male-dominated society of the time he had little confidence that a woman could rule Brazil. He was fond and respectful of the women in his life, but he did not consider it feasible that Isabel could survive as monarch. He did nothing to prepare Isabel for the responsibilities of ascending the throne, nor did he attempt to encourage acceptance of a female ruler among the political class.|$|E

30|$|Much less {{is known}} about the {{introduction}} and spread of non-native lower plants and fungi, and about changes in the number of non-native species in Europe over time. It is known that these taxa can have <b>enormous</b> <b>impacts,</b> with perhaps the most damaging examples being diseases of crops and livestock. The potato famines that occurred across Western Europe during the nineteenth century, for example, were caused by the invasive potato blight (Phytophthora infestans) [35], introduced from North America.|$|R

25|$|In {{the first}} half of the 18th century, eminent French writers were invited to become members of the Académie Française, but the Academy in {{practice}} served largely to glorify the royal family and to keep writers under gentle control, rather to stimulate innovation in literature. Neither Rousseau nor Voltaire were chosen; only one of the great Philosophes of the enlightenment, Montesquieu, was elected a member. His 1748 book The Spirit of the Laws, proposing a separation of powers between the executive, legislature and courts, had an <b>enormous</b> <b>impact</b> on political thinking outside France, especially in England and the United States.|$|E
30|$|Demographic {{change has}} an {{insidious}} yet predictable {{effect on the}} economy. Ageing in the industrialized countries will undermine the foundation of human capital, and increasing life expectancy will place enormous pressures on public welfare. Two of the most populous countries in the world, China and India, will become global heavyweights in education and qualification: China in the next decade, India somewhat later. The <b>enormous</b> <b>impacts</b> of demographic change will emerge over time in different ways.

25|$|The disease nagana or African animal trypanosomiasis (AAT) causes gradual health {{decline in}} {{infected}} livestock, reduces milk and meat production, increases abortion rates, and animals eventually {{succumb to the}} disease (annual cattle deaths caused by trypanosomiasis are estimated at 3 million). This has an <b>enormous</b> <b>impact</b> on the livelihood of farmers who live in tsetse-infested areas, as infected animals cannot be used to plough the land, and keeping cattle is only feasible when the animals are kept under constant prophylactic treatment with trypanocidal drugs, often with associated problems of drug resistance, counterfeited drugs, and suboptimal dosage. The overall annual direct lost potential in livestock and crop production was estimated at US$4.5 billion.|$|E
25|$|Straight Outta Compton is {{the debut}} studio album by American hip hop group N.W.A, {{released}} August 8, 1988 on group member Eazy-E's record label Ruthless Records. Production for {{the album was}} handled by Dr. Dre with DJ Yella giving co-production along with Arabian Prince Co-Production work on the project. The album has been viewed as the pioneering record of gangsta rap with its ever-present profanity and violent lyrics. This was the group's only release with rapper Ice Cube prior to his 1989 departure. It has been considered {{to be one of}} the greatest and most influential hip-hop records by music writers and has had an <b>enormous</b> <b>impact</b> on the evolution of hip hop.|$|E
25|$|The Asia Minor Expedition and Catastrophe, {{as well as}} the {{uprooting}} of {{the ethnic}} Greek population from Anatolia after three thousand years of presence, had an <b>enormous</b> <b>impact</b> on the Greek psyche. The Smyrna Catastrophe has been considered as the worst incident of modern Greek history, and as an incident of the same magnitude as the Fall of Constantinople for the Greeks. The matters related to the refugees halted the Greco-Turkish relations for many decades. The issues concerning the missing Greeks were soon raised in the International Red Cross, without any success and cooperation from the Turkish side. To this day, the Greek citizens who were born in Asia Minor have to apply for a visa in order to enter Turkey (something that does not apply to Greek citizens born in Greece).|$|E

40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} {{restructuring}} process {{and changes in}} temporal model of working time in European countries. It argues that changing demands on working time have <b>enormous</b> <b>impacts</b> on establishing work-life balance and that – {{to a great extent}} – the consequences are shouldered by women. In assessing these changing demands, it is crucial to consider the occupational context, in particular the level of autonomy in determining their working time, the skills, the dedication to work. Women working in semi-skilled and low-skilled occupations are more likely to adhere to traditional gender roles and suffer much more from externally-imposed temporal frameworks and organisational changes...|$|R
25|$|Regardless of {{the medium}} of introduction, {{biological}} invasions have a considerable effect on the landscape. The goal of eliminating invasive species is not new; Plato wrote {{about the benefits of}} biotic and landscape diversity centuries ago. However, the notion of eliminating invasive species is difficult to define because there is no canonical length of time that a species must exist in a specific environment until it is no longer classified as invasive. European forestry defines plants as being archaeotypes if they existed in Europe before 1500 and neophytes if they arrived after 1500. This classification is still arbitrary and some species have unknown origins while others have become such key components of their landscape that they are best understood as keystone species. As a result, their removal would have an <b>enormous</b> <b>impact</b> on the landscape, but not necessarily cause a return to conditions that existed before the invasion.|$|E

40|$|Very {{recently}} a point-like source was detected {{near the center}} of Cassiopeia A supernova remnant by the Chandra first light observation and subsequently confirmed by a long ROSAT observation.

Although the currently available data cannot determine whether this point source is a neutron star or a black hole, the future prospect for distinguishing between these cases is bright.
