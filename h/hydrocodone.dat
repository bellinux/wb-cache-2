25|$|It is also {{similar to}} <b>hydrocodone,</b> differing {{only in that}} it has a {{hydroxyl}} group at carbon-14.|$|E
25|$|Dihydrocodeine is {{the parent}} drug {{of a series}} of {{moderately}} strong narcotics including, among others, <b>hydrocodone,</b> nicocodeine, nicodicodeine, thebaine and acetyldihydrocodeine.|$|E
25|$|The clandestine {{conversion}} of morphine to ketones of the hydromorphone class or other derivatives like dihydromorphine (Paramorfan), desomorphine (Permonid), metopon, etc. and codeine to <b>hydrocodone</b> (Dicodid), dihydrocodeine (Paracodin), etc. is more involved, time-consuming, requires lab equipment of various types, and usually requires expensive catalysts and {{large amounts of}} morphine at the outset and is less common but still has been discovered by authorities in various ways during the last 20 years or so. Dihydromorphine can be acetylated into another 3,6 morphine diester, namely diacetyldihydromorphine (Paralaudin), and <b>hydrocodone</b> into thebacon.|$|E
25|$|Among the narcotics, it is opiates such as {{morphine}} and codeine, and opioids such as diacetylmorphine (Heroin), <b>hydrocodone</b> (Vicodin; Hycodan), oxycodone (Percocet; Oxycontin), hydromorphone (Dilaudid), and oxymorphone (Opana).|$|E
25|$|Dr. Jason Payne-James, a {{forensic}} pathologist, has believed that Ledger might have survived if <b>hydrocodone</b> and oxycodone {{had been left}} out of the combination of drugs that the actor took just prior to his death.|$|E
25|$|Medical {{examiners}} {{concluded that}} musician Prince died on April 21, 2016, from an accidental fentanyl overdose. The drug was among many identified in counterfeit pills recovered from his home, especially some that were mislabeled as Watson 385, {{a combination of}} <b>hydrocodone</b> and paracetamol.|$|E
25|$|According to {{subsequent}} {{news reports}} the toxicology tests also showed levels of painkillers <b>hydrocodone,</b> oxycodone, and tramadol, {{as well as}} anti-anxiety drugs alprazolam and diazepam. Mays had suffered from hip problems and was scheduled for hip replacement surgery {{the day after he}} was found dead.|$|E
25|$|Morphine is a {{precursor}} {{in the manufacture}} in {{a large number of}} opioids such as dihydromorphine, hydromorphone, <b>hydrocodone,</b> and oxycodone as well as codeine, which itself has a large family of semi-synthetic derivatives. Morphine is commonly treated with acetic anhydride and ignited to yield heroin.|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{possibility}} of convulsions at high doses for some users, recreational use can be very dangerous. Tramadol can cause a higher incidence of nausea, dizziness, loss of appetite compared with opioids, which could deter recreational use. Compared to <b>hydrocodone,</b> fewer persons choose to use tramadol recreationally.|$|E
25|$|Three known {{kinds of}} opioid receptors have been identified: mu (μ), kappa (κ) and delta (δ). Synthetic opioid and opioid-derivative drugs {{activate}} these receptors (possibly by {{acting on the}} PAG directly, where these receptors are densely expressed) to produce analgesia. These drugs include morphine, heroin (diacetylmorphine), pethidine, <b>hydrocodone,</b> oxycodone, and similar pain-reducing compounds.|$|E
25|$|At 1:02p.m. on December 21, 2011, Waltman {{turned himself}} in for arrest in St. Petersburg, Florida on two {{outstanding}} charges of possession of a controlled substance (<b>hydrocodone)</b> and one charge of possession of drug paraphernalia. He was not jailed, and released from the sheriff's office at 2:24p.m. after posting a $2,150 bond.|$|E
25|$|Opioid {{medications}} such as <b>hydrocodone,</b> oxycodone, and morphine {{are used}} for insomnia {{that is associated with}} pain due to their analgesic properties and hypnotic effects. Opioids can fragment sleep and decrease REM and stage 2 sleep. By producing analgesia and sedation, opioids may be appropriate in carefully selected patients with pain-associated insomnia. However, dependence on opioids can lead to long-term sleep disturbances.|$|E
25|$|The methyl {{group that}} makes {{morphine}} into codeine {{can be removed}} or added back, or replaced with another functional group like ethyl and others to make codeine analogues of morphine-derived drugs and vice versa. Codeine analogues of morphine-based drugs often serve as prodrugs of the stronger drug, as in codeine and morphine, <b>hydrocodone</b> and hydromorphone, oxycodone and oxymorphone, nicocodeine and nicomorphine, dihydrocodeine and dihydromorphine, etc.|$|E
25|$|Xanax and <b>hydrocodone</b> {{were also}} found in Chris Benoit's system, at levels {{investigators}} called consistent with therapeutic use. Elevated levels of synthetic anabolic steroid testosterone cypionate were found in his urine; investigators believed that the level found suggested it had been taken recently. While the synthetic anabolic steroid testosterone cypionate was found in his urine, {{there was no evidence}} of GHB contrary to speculation. Benoit also tested negative for blood alcohol.|$|E
25|$|The {{production}} of opium {{has not changed}} since ancient times. Through selective breeding of the Papaver somniferum plant, {{the content of the}} phenanthrene alkaloids morphine, codeine, {{and to a lesser extent}} thebaine has been greatly increased. In modern times, much of the thebaine, which often serves as the raw material for the synthesis for <b>hydrocodone,</b> hydromorphone, and other semisynthetic opiates, originates from extracting Papaver orientale or Papaver bracteatum.|$|E
25|$|While {{the use of}} paracetamol, aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, {{and other}} NSAIDS {{concurrently}} with weak to mid-range opiates (up to about the <b>hydrocodone</b> level) has been said to show beneficial synergistic effects by combatting pain at multiple sites of action, several combination analgesic products {{have been shown to}} have few efficacy benefits when compared to similar doses of their individual components. Moreover, these combination analgesics can often result in significant adverse events, including accidental overdoses, most often due to confusion that arises from the multiple (and often non-acting) components of these combinations.|$|E
25|$|On April 12, 2009, Chambers {{was found}} dead in her home near Santa Clarita, California. Documents found with her body {{identified}} her as Marilyn Ann Taylor. She was discovered by her 17-year-old daughter. The LA County Coroner's autopsy revealed Chambers died of a cerebral hemorrhage and an aneurysm related to heart disease. Chambers was ten days away from her 57th birthday. The painkiller <b>hydrocodone</b> and the antidepressant citalopram were found in her bloodstream, but not enough to cause death. Upon her death, the Associated Press reported she was survived by her daughter, sister and brother. Her ashes were scattered at sea.|$|E
25|$|On May 1, 2003, Hulette {{died in the}} townhouse {{they shared}} in Marietta, after mixing pills of <b>hydrocodone,</b> and Alprazolam (Xanax) with vodka. Luger was arrested after {{a search of the}} {{residence}} revealed a number of illicit controlled substances, including anabolic steroids, OxyContin, synthetic growth hormone, testosterone, and Alprazolam. He was charged with 13 felony counts of drug possession. He was released the following day on $27,500 bail. Hulette's death was eventually ruled accidental. Luger pleaded guilty to the charges and was fined $1,000, sentenced to five years probation, and ordered to undergo periodic drug tests.|$|E
25|$|At {{the press}} conference held by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation on July 17, 2007, it was {{announced}} that three different drugs were found in Nancy Benoit's system: <b>hydrocodone,</b> hydromorphone and Xanax. All three drugs were found to be at levels investigators considered normal for therapeutic treatment (as opposed to recreational use or abuse.) A blood-alcohol level was found at 0.184. Dr. Kris Sperry, the medical examiner, added it was impossible to say whether any of the blood findings was due to ingestion of alcohol or the post-mortem process. It was also ruled out that Nancy was sedated by Chris before she was murdered.|$|E
25|$|Jackson {{was said}} to have used propofol, as well as {{alprazolam}} (an antianxiety agent), and sertraline (an antidepressant). Other drugs named in connection with him included omeprazole, <b>hydrocodone,</b> paroxetine, carisoprodol, and hydromorphone. After his death, police found several drugs in his home, which included propofol. Some of these drugs had labels made out to Jackson under pseudonyms, while others were unlabeled. A 2004 police document prepared for the 2005 People v. Jackson child abuse trial alleged that Jackson was taking up to 40 alprazolam pills a night. Alprazolam was not found in his bloodstream at his time of death. Dr. A.J. Farshchian, Michael Jackson's friend and confidante, has claimed that Jackson was scared of drugs.|$|E
25|$|Animal {{and human}} studies and {{clinical}} experience {{back up the}} contention that morphine {{is one of the}} most euphoric drugs known, and via all but the IV route heroin and morphine cannot be distinguished according to studies because heroin is a prodrug for the delivery of systemic morphine. Chemical changes to the morphine molecule yield other euphorigenics such as dihydromorphine, hydromorphone (Dilaudid, Hydal), and oxymorphone (Numorphan, Opana), as well as the latter three's methylated equivalents dihydrocodeine, <b>hydrocodone,</b> and oxycodone, respectively; in addition to heroin, there are dipropanoylmorphine, diacetyldihydromorphine, and other members of the 3,6 morphine diester category like nicomorphine and other similar semi-synthetic opiates like desomorphine, hydromorphinol, etc. used clinically in many countries of the world but in many cases also produced illicitly in rare instances.|$|E
25|$|Opioids {{are being}} used more {{frequently}} {{in the management of}} non-malignant chronic pain. This practice has now led to a new and growing problem with addiction and misuse of opioids. Because of various negative effects the use of opioids for long term management of chronic pain is not indicated unless other less risky pain relievers have been found ineffective. Chronic pain which occurs only periodically, such as that from nerve pain, migraines, and fibromyalgia, frequently is better treated with medications other than opioids. Paracetamol and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs including ibuprofen and naproxen are considered safer alternatives. They are frequently used combined with opioids, such as paracetamol combined with oxycodone (Percocet) and ibuprofen combined with <b>hydrocodone</b> (Vicoprofen), which boosts the pain relief but is also intended to deter recreational use.|$|E
25|$|Opioids include opiates, {{an older}} term {{that refers to}} such drugs derived from opium, {{including}} morphine itself. Other opioids are semi-synthetic and synthetic drugs such as <b>hydrocodone,</b> oxycodone and fentanyl; antagonist drugs such as naloxone; and endogenous peptides such as the endorphins. The terms opiate and narcotic are sometimes encountered as synonyms for opioid. Opiate is properly limited to the natural alkaloids found in the resin of the opium poppy although some include semi-synthetic derivatives. Narcotic, derived from words meaning 'numbness' or 'sleep', as an American legal term, refers to cocaine and opioids, and their source materials; it is also loosely applied to any illegal or controlled psychoactive drug. In some jurisdictions all controlled drugs are legally classified as narcotics. The term can have pejorative connotations and its use is generally discouraged where that is the case.|$|E
25|$|Morphine is {{the most}} {{abundant}} opiate found in opium, the dried latex extracted by shallowly scoring the unripe seedpods of the Papaver somniferum poppy. Morphine is generally 8–14% of the dry weight of opium, although specially bred cultivars reach 26% or produce little morphine at all (under 1%, perhaps down to 0.04%). The latter varieties, including the 'Przemko' and 'Norman' cultivars of the opium poppy, are used to produce two other alkaloids, thebaine and oripavine, which {{are used in the}} manufacture of semi-synthetic and synthetic opioids like oxycodone and etorphine and some other types of drugs. P. bracteatum does not contain morphine or codeine, or other narcotic phenanthrene-type, alkaloids. This species is rather a source of thebaine. Occurrence of morphine in other Papaverales and Papaveraceae, as well as in some species of hops and mulberry trees has not been confirmed. Morphine is produced most predominantly early in the life cycle of the plant. Past the optimum point for extraction, various processes in the plant produce codeine, thebaine, and in some cases negligible amounts of hydromorphone, dihydromorphine, dihydrocodeine, tetrahydro-thebaine, and <b>hydrocodone</b> (these compounds are rather synthesized from thebaine and oripavine).|$|E
500|$|Goldstein {{was found}} dead in his New York City {{apartment}} on August 28, 2009. Drug paraphernalia, including a crack pipe and a bag of crack, were found nearby. The New York medical examiner subsequently determined that Goldstein's death was an accident caused by [...] "acute intoxication" [...] from a combination of cocaine, oxycodone, <b>hydrocodone,</b> lorazepam, clonazepam, alprazolam, diphenhydramine and levamisole. Haley Wood denied rumors that an alleged recent separation from Goldstein had contributed to his relapse, saying that the couple had still been together at the time.|$|E
2500|$|Semi-synthetic opioids: {{created from}} either the natural opiates or {{morphine}} esters, such as hydromorphone, <b>hydrocodone,</b> oxycodone, oxymorphone, ethylmorphine and buprenorphine; ...|$|E
2500|$|Attachment, removal or {{modification}} of functional groups to positions 3 or 6 (dihydrocodeine and related, <b>hydrocodone,</b> nicomorphine); {{in the case}} of moving the methyl functional group from position 3 to 6, codeine becomes heterocodeine, which is 72 times stronger, and therefore six times stronger than morphine ...|$|E
2500|$|It was {{discovered}} in 1953, that humans and some animals naturally produce minute amounts of morphine, codeine, and possibly some of their simpler derivatives like heroin and dihydromorphine, in addition to endogenous opioid peptides. [...] Some bacteria are capable of producing some semi-synthetic opioids such as hydromorphone and <b>hydrocodone</b> when living in a solution containing morphine or codeine respectively.|$|E
2500|$|Toxicology reports {{released}} on July 17, 2007, revealed that at their time of death, Nancy had three different drugs in her system: Xanax, <b>hydrocodone,</b> and hydromorphone, {{all of which}} were found at the therapeutic rather than toxic levels. Daniel was found to have Xanax in his system, which led the chief medical examiner to believe that he was sedated before he was murdered. Benoit was found to have Xanax, <b>hydrocodone,</b> and an elevated level of testosterone, caused by a synthetic form of the hormone, in his system. The chief medical examiner attributed the testosterone level to Benoit possibly being treated for a deficiency caused by previous steroid abuse or testicular insufficiency. There was no indication that anything in Benoit's body contributed to his violent behaviour that led to the murder–suicide, concluding that there was no [...] "roid-rage" [...] involved. Prior to the murder–suicide, Benoit had been given illegal steroids not in compliance with WWE's Talent Wellness Program in February 2006. Benoit received nandrolone and anastrozole. During the investigation into steroid abuse, it was revealed that other wrestlers had also been given steroids.|$|E
2500|$|Approved {{indication}} for dihydrocodeine is {{the management}} of moderate to moderately severe pain as well as coughing and shortness of breath. [...] As {{is the case with}} other drugs in this group, the antitussive dose tends to be less than the analgesic dose, and dihydrocodeine is a powerful cough suppressant like all other members of the immediate codeine family (see below) and their cousins <b>hydrocodone,</b> oxycodone and ethylmorphine, whole opium preparations, and the strong opioid hydromorphone.|$|E
2500|$|After {{a flurry}} of further media speculation, on 6 August 2008, the US Attorney's Office in Manhattan closed its {{investigation}} into Ledger's death without filing any charges and rendering moot its subpoena of Olsen. With the clearing of the two doctors and Olsen, and {{the closing of the}} investigation because the prosecutors in the Manhattan US Attorney's Office [...] "don't believe there's a viable target," [...] it is still not known how Ledger obtained the oxycodone and <b>hydrocodone</b> in the lethal drug combination that killed him.|$|E
2500|$|In 2011, Buchanan, {{along with}} Democratic Representative Ed Markey of Massachusetts, {{introduced}} the Pill Mill Crackdown Act of 2011, {{legislation that would}} require money seized from so-called pill mills to be directed to drug treatment programs; [...] "increase fines and sentences for those convicted of running pill mills"; and make <b>hydrocodone</b> drugs such as Vicodin more difficult to obtain. The bill received bipartisan support in both the House and the Senate (where introduced companion bill was introduced), but never {{made it out of}} committee.|$|E
2500|$|Two {{weeks later}} on 6 February 2008, the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner of New York {{released}} its conclusions, {{based on an}} initial autopsy of 23 January 2008 and a subsequent complete toxicological analysis. The report concludes, in part, [...] "Mr. Heath Ledger died {{as the result of}} acute intoxication by the combined effects of oxycodone, <b>hydrocodone,</b> diazepam, temazepam, alprazolam and doxylamine." [...] It states definitively: [...] "We have concluded that the manner of death is accident, resulting from the abuse of prescribed medications." ...|$|E
2500|$|On August 27, 2008, Knight {{was arrested}} on drug and aggravated assault charges after leaving a Las Vegas strip club. When police arrived on the scene, Knight was beating his girlfriend of three years, Melissa Isaac, and brandishing a knife. [...] Reports also alleged that he was under the {{influence}} of both ecstasy and <b>hydrocodone.</b> On December 5, 2008, Knight was cleared of all charges. Knight's attorney, David Chesnoff, said the prosecution had [...] "discovery problems and witness problems". When Knight was asked about the positive verdict he replied [...] "God is good, Happy Holidays".|$|E
2500|$|Codeine {{was once}} {{viewed as the}} [...] "gold standard" [...] in cough suppressants, but this {{position}} is now questioned. Some recent placebo-controlled trials have found {{that it may be}} no better than a placebo for some causes including acute cough in children. Thus, it is not recommended for children. Additionally, {{there is no evidence that}} <b>hydrocodone</b> is useful in children. Similarly, a 2012 Dutch guideline regarding the treatment of acute cough does not recommend its use. (The opioid analogue dextromethorphan, long claimed to be as effective a cough suppressant as codeine, has similarly demonstrated little benefit in several recent studies.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Oxycodone is {{the most}} widely recreationally used opioid in America. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services {{estimates}} that about 11 {{million people in the}} US consume oxycodone in a non-medical way annually. In 2007, about 42,800 emergency room visits occurred due to [...] "episodes" [...] involving oxycodone. Diverted oxycodone may be taken orally or ingested through insufflation; used intravenously, or the heated vapors inhaled. In 2008, recreational use of oxycodone and <b>hydrocodone</b> were involved in 14,800 deaths. Some of the cases were due to overdoses of the acetaminophen component, resulting in fatal liver damage.|$|E
