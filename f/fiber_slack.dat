30|$|The current mean force-elongation curves (Figure  4) {{were rather}} linear: Pearson’s linear {{correlation}} coefficients were R[*]=[*] 0.998 and R[*]=[*] 0.999 for the fast and slow loading rates, respectively. Low stiffness, or toe region, was either absent or small, {{as indicated by}} the intercept of the linear regression that was not significantly different from zero at the fast rate (student’s t-test; P[*]=[*] 0.095) and only slightly different from zero at the slow rate (P[*]=[*] 0.037). The lack of toe region was probably due to the initial tension (approximately 0.3 kN) acting on the AT at the onset of muscle contraction. Due to the initial tension, possible <b>fiber</b> <b>slack</b> is removed and tendon is stretched within the linear region {{from the beginning of the}} contraction. This explains why the current average hysteresis is low (5 %) and comparable to those achieved during mechanical testing of isolated tendons (Ker. 1981).|$|E
40|$|When {{inorganic}} phosphate (Pi) is photogenerated from caged Pi during isometric contractions of glycerinated rabbit psoas muscle fibers, the released Pi binds to cross-bridges and reverses the working stroke of cross-bridges. The consequent force decline, the Pi-transient, is exponential and probes the kinetics of the power-stroke and Pi release. During muscle shortening, {{the fraction of}} attached cross-bridges and the average strain on them decreases (Ford, L. E., A. F. Huxley, and R. M. Simmons, 1977. Tension responses to sudden length change in stimulated frog muscle <b>fibers</b> near <b>slack</b> length. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 269 : 441 - 515; Ford, L. E., A. F. Huxley, and R. M. Simmons, 1985. Tension transients during steady state shortening of frog muscle fibers. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 361 : 131 - 150. To learn {{to what extent the}} Pi transient is strain dependent, muscle fibers were activated and shortened or lengthened at a fixed velocity during the photogeneration of Pi. The Pi transients observed during changes in muscle length showed three primary characteristics: 1) during shortening the Pi transient rate, Kpi, increased and its amplitude decreased with shortening velocity; Kpi increased linearly with velocity to > 110 s- 1 at 0. 3 muscle lengths per second (ML/s). 2) At a specific shortening velocity, increases in [Pi] produce increases in Kpi that are nonlinear with [Pi] and approach an asymptote. 3) During forced lengthening Kpi and the amplitude of the Pi transient are little different from the isometric contractions. These data can be approximated by a strain-dependent three-state cross-bridge model. The results show that the power stroke's rate is strain-dependent, and are consistent with biochemical studies indicating that the rate-limiting step at low strains is a transition from a weakly to a strongly bound cross-bridge state...|$|R
40|$|Four {{manifestations of}} excitation-contraction (E-C) {{coupling}} {{were derived from}} measurements in cut skeletal muscle fibers of the frog, voltage clamped in a Vaseline-gap chamber: intramembranous charge movement currents, myoplasmic [Ca 2 +] transients, flux of calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), and the intrinsic optical transparency change that accompanies calcium release. In attempts to suppress Ca release by direct effects on the SR, three interventions were applied: (a) a conditioning pulse that causes calcium release and inhibits release in subsequent pulses by Ca-dependent inactivation; (b) a series of brief, large pulses, separated by long intervals (greater than 700 ms), which deplete Ca 2 + in the SR; and (c) intracellular application of the release channel blocker ruthenium red. All these reduced calcium release flux. None was expected to affect directly the voltage sensor of the T-tubule; however, all of them reduced or eliminated a component of charge movement current with the following characteristics: (a) delayed onset, peaking 10 - 20 ms into the pulse; (b) current reversal during the pulse, with an inward phase after the outward peak; and (c) OFF transient of smaller magnitude than the ON, of variable polarity, and sometimes biphasic. When the total charge movement current had a visible hump, the positive phase of the current eliminated by the interventions agreed with the hump in timing and size. The component of charge movement current blocked by the interventions was greater and had a greater inward phase in <b>slack</b> <b>fibers</b> with high [EGTA] inside than in stretched fibers with no EGTA. Its amplitude at - 40 mV was on average 0. 26 A/F (SEM 0. 03) in <b>slack</b> <b>fibers.</b> The waveform of release flux determined from the Ca transients measured simultaneously with the membrane currents had, as described previously (Melzer, W., E. Rios, and M. F. Schneider. 1984. Biophysical Journal. 45 : 637 - 641), an early peak followed by a descent to a steady level during the pulse. The time at which this peak occurred was highly correlated with the time to peak of the current suppressed, occurring on average 6. 9 ms later (SEM 0. 73 ms). The current suppressed by the above interventions in all cases had a time course similar to the time derivative of the release flux; specifically, {{the peak of the}} time derivative of release flux preceded the peak of the current suppressed by 0. 7 ms (SEM 0. 6 ms). The magnitude of the current blocked was highly correlated with the inhibitory effect of the interventions on Ca 2 + release flux. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS...|$|R
40|$|A laser {{diffraction}} technique {{has been developed}} for registering small changes in sarcomere length. The technique is capable of resolving changes as small as 0. 2 A in isolated frog skeletal muscle fibers. The small sarcomere lengthening that accompanies the drop in tension in the latent period of contraction was investigated. We suggest this lengthening be named latency elongation (LE). The LE is present in a completely <b>slack</b> <b>fiber</b> and must, therefore, {{be caused by a}} forcible lengthening process. Furthermore, the LE is dependent on the existence of an overlap between thin and tick filaments. The rate of elongation and the time interval between stimulation and maximum elongation may vary along the fiber. The maximum elongation was 3 - 5 A per sarcomere. At any instant the drop in tension {{is a product of the}} sum of sarcomere lengthenings along the fiber and the slope stiffness of the series elasticity. The latency relaxation (LR) could be registered in the sarcomere length range from 2. 2 mum to 3. 6 - 3. 7 mum. The amplitude went through a sharp maximum at 3. 0 - 3. 1 mum. In the sarcomere length range from 2. 2 to 2. 8 mum the delay from onset to maximum LR was nearly proportional to the distance from the Z-line to the overlap zone. A working hypothesis is presented. It is suggested that the LE is caused by a lengthening of the thin filaments...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanical}} {{roles of}} sarcomere-associated cytoskeletal lattices were investigated {{by studying the}} resting tension-sarcomere length curves of mechanically skinned rabbit psoas muscle fibers {{over a wide range}} of sarcomere strain. Correlative immunoelectron microscopy of the elastic titin filaments of the endosarcomeric lattice revealed biphasic extensibility behaviors and provided a structural interpretation of the multiphasic tension-length curves. We propose that the reversible change of contour length of the extensible segment of titin between the Z line and the end of thick filaments underlies the exponential rise of resting tension. At and beyond an elastic limit near 3. 8 microns, a portion of the anchored titin segment that adheres to thick filaments is released from the distal ends of thick filament. This increase in extensible length of titin results in a net length increase in the unstrained extensible segment, thereby lowering the stiffness of the <b>fiber,</b> lengthening the <b>slack</b> sarcomere length, and shifting the yield point in postyield sarcomeres. Thus, the titin-myosin composite filament behaves as a dual-stage molecular spring, consisting of an elastic connector segment for normal response and a longer latent segment that is recruited at and beyond the elastic limit of the sarcomere. Exosarcomeric intermediate filaments contribute to resting tension only above 4. 5 microns. We conclude that the interlinked endo- and exosarcomeric lattices are both viscoelastic force-bearing elements. These distinct cytoskeletal lattices appear to operate over two ranges of sarcomere strains and collectively enable myofibrils to respond viscoelastically over a broad range of sarcomere and fiber lengths...|$|R
