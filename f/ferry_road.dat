5|$|As {{one of the}} few routes into hilly central Westchester, {{the river}} and its {{associated}} roads saw frequent skirmishes. In November 1777, three young men with Patriot sympathies were walking near the river crossing on the Dobbs <b>Ferry</b> <b>Road</b> (now Ashford Avenue) when they came upon a group of horsemen affiliated with Kipp's Regiment, one of the county's most-feared Loyalist militias.

5|$|In {{the late}} 1800s, {{there was an}} old <b>ferry</b> <b>road</b> near the mouth of Little Wapwallopen Creek. A {{railroad}} bridge also crosses the creek. Historically, a road ran from a small settlement on Big Wapwallopen Creek to an even smaller one on Little Wapwallopen Creek, near where Church Road presently is. The Glen Brook Water Company once had plans to construct a dam on the creek and also on its tributary Pond Creek. The Wilkes-Barre Ice Company and the Hazleton Ice Company also dammed a stream in the creek's watershed in 1912 and 1916 respectively, forming the Ice Ponds.|$|E
5|$|The Confederate {{plan was}} for Pillow to push McClernand away and {{take control of}} Wynn's Ferry and Forge Roads, the main routes to Nashville. Buckner was to move his {{division}} across Wynn's <b>Ferry</b> <b>Road</b> and act as rear guard {{for the remainder of}} the army as it withdrew from Fort Donelson and moved east. A lone regiment from Buckner's division—the 30th Tennessee—was designated to stay in the trenches and prevent a Federal pursuit. The attack started well, and after two hours of heavy fighting, Pillow's men pushed McClernand's line back and opened the escape route. It was in this attack that Union troops in the West first heard the famous, unnerving rebel yell.|$|E

5|$|Every {{road that}} is {{maintained}} by DelDOT, including Interstate, U.S., and state routes, is assigned a maintenance road number (also {{known as a}} reference number). The maintenance road numbers are only unique in a specific county and some roads can be designated with multiple road numbers. For example, Bryants Corner Road in Kent County is designated as Road 205, Road 103, and Road 219. Suffixed maintenance road numbers exist near their parent roads, often for a short alignment. For example, Woodland <b>Ferry</b> <b>Road</b> in Sussex County is designated Road 78, while Old Sailor Road, a short road branching off from it near Laurel, is designated as Road 78A. The maintenance road numbers are signed with little white markers at intersections showing the two roads that intersect each other and on auxiliary plates below warning signs approaching intersections.|$|E

5|$|According to legend, Sherwood's sons put {{her body}} near the fireplace, and a wind {{came down the}} chimney.

Sherwood lies in an unmarked grave under some trees in a field near the intersection of Pungo <b>Ferry</b> <b>Road</b> and Princess Anne Road in Virginia Beach. Stories about the Devil taking her body, unnatural storms, and loitering black cats quickly arose after her death, and local men killed every feline they could find; this widespread killing of cats might have caused the infestation of rats and mice recorded in Princess Anne County in 1743. Her home on Muddy Creek stood for over 200 years. After being burned {{several times in the}} 20th century by vandals, all that was left in 2002 were the brick chimneys, which were bulldozed in November 2002.

5|$|Not {{everything}} was going well with the Confederate advance. By 9:30a.m., as the lead Union brigades were falling back, Nathan Bedford Forrest urged Bushrod Johnson to launch an all-out attack on the disorganized troops. Johnson was too cautious to approve of a general assault, but he did agree to keep the infantry moving slowly forward. Two hours into the battle, Gen. Pillow realized that Buckner's wing was not attacking alongside his. After a confrontation between the two generals, Buckner's troops moved out and, combined with the right flank of Pillow's wing, hit W. H. L. Wallace's brigade. The Confederates took control of Forge Road and a key section of Wynn's <b>Ferry</b> <b>Road,</b> opening a route to Nashville, but Buckner's delay provided time for Lew Wallace's men to reinforce McClernand's retreating forces before they were completely routed. Despite Grant's earlier orders, Wallace's units moved to the right with Thayer's brigade, giving McClernand's men time to regroup and gather ammunition from Wallace's supplies. The 68th Ohio was left behind to protect the rear.|$|E
5|$|On May 23, 1839, Waller married Philadelphian Julia Ellmaker. He {{first met}} Ellmaker while visiting friends in Philadelphia {{during his time}} at the Princeton Theological Seminary.

He lived at the corner of 5th and Market Streets in Bloomsburg, although at one point he owned much of the land between 4th Street, the Susquehanna River, Railroad Street, and <b>Ferry</b> <b>Road</b> in Bloomsburg. In 1871, he suffered a driving accident and was temporarily injured. He was in another accident in 1875 and due to this, he needed to walk with crutches for the remainder of his life. Waller also suffered from rheumatism and neuralgia due to extensive traveling. He retired from being a minister on April 16, 1871. He died in on December 7, 1893, at the age of 79. The services for his death were held in his home. The historian J.H. Battle made note of Waller's hospitality. He was interested in geology and another Presbyterian minister gave him a large mineralogy-related collection in 1848.|$|E
