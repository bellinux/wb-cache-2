40|$|The {{status of}} {{mammography}} screening experience and {{factors related to}} utilization were examined in six towns serviced by physician staffs at five hospitals. Data were collected via random digit dial telephone interview of a probability sample of 1184 women, aged 45 - 75 years. The results showed that 55 % of the women reported <b>ever</b> <b>having</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> mammogram. Of those who <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> mammogram, 21 % reported that the mammogram {{in the past year}} was their first one. Of those women who are over 50 and <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> mammogram, 57 % reported one in the past year. Analyses demonstrated that a combination of demographic factors, certain beliefs and knowledge, <b>having</b> <b>a</b> regular physician, social interaction and media exposure are independently related to <b>ever</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> mammogram, and to having one in the past year. Despite anecdotal and empirical evidence that the proportion of women <b>ever</b> <b>having</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> mammogram <b>has</b> substantially increased in the past several years, increasing utilization among older and lower-income women provides a challenge for public health...|$|R

Filipa Jodelka of The Guardian observed that [...] "David's family went on to pronounce him wicked and cast him out into darkness." [...] Writers kept the paternity of Kylie's baby a secret up until birth. On-screen the child, named Lily, has a paternity test taken {{in which it is}} revealed that David is her biological father. David then boasts about the result to Nick to cause further trouble. Producer Stuart Blackburn said that he used the story to [...] "push Kylie to the edge". It also created the opportunity for writers to revisit David's bad persona. He said the revelation damages their relationship but his team were keeping the possibility of the pair reuniting. Kylie is angry at herself and David. Blackburn explained [...] "in her head she's a screw-up, and she'll be furious with herself for imagining she could <b>ever</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> normal life. If there's hope for Kylie and David, they must accept each other for who they really are." ...|$|E
500|$|Johnson {{was again}} praised by Wisden {{in its report}} on the 1948 tour. [...] "Indebtedness for the smooth running of the tour and general harmony of the team was due largely to the manager, Mr Keith Johnson, {{hard-working}} and always genial," [...] it said. [...] "Paying tribute to the loyalty of the players, Mr Johnson said {{there had not been}} a discordant note in the party throughout the tour." [...] Flanagan labelled Johnson as [...] "conscientious, reserved, dignified, extraordinarily industrious and scrupulously trustworthy". He {{went on to say that}} [...] "No organization, no body corporate, no individual could ever hope to have a more loyal, a more devoted, or a more conscientious officer...Although to the world in general all the praise and glory for the unequalled triumph the tour proved to be goes to Sir Donald Bradman, only those who travelled with the team will <b>ever</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> proper conception of the part played in that triumph by Keith Johnson." [...] Bradman said that Johnson [...] "created friends and goodwill everywhere both for himself and the team, and no side could have wished for a better Manager". On the journey back to Australia, the players presented Johnson with a silver Georgian salver, with their signatures engraved on the memento.|$|E
500|$|Although, after Keats's death, {{recognition}} of the merits of his poetry came slowly, by mid century, despite widespread Victorian disapproval of the alleged [...] "weakness" [...] of his character and the view often advanced [...] "that Keats's work represented mere sensuality without substance", some of his poems began to find an appreciative audience, including [...] "To Autumn". In an 1844 essay on Keats's poetry in the Dumfries Herald, George Gilfillian placed [...] "To Autumn" [...] among [...] "the finest of Keats' smaller pieces". In an 1851 lecture, David Macbeth Moir acclaimed [...] "four exquisite odes,—'To a Nightingale,' 'To a Grecian Urn,' 'To Melancholy,' and 'To Autumn,'—all so pregnant with deep thought, so picturesque in their limning, and so suggestive." [...] In 1865, Matthew Arnold singled out the [...] "indefinable delicacy, charm, and perfection of [...] Keats's [...] in his Autumn". John Dennis, in an 1883 work about great poets, wrote that [...] "the 'Ode to Autumn', ripe with {{the glory of the}} season it describes—must <b>ever</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> place among the most precious gems of lyrical poetry." [...] The 1888 Britannica declared, [...] "Of these [...] perhaps the two nearest to absolute perfection, to the triumphant achievement and accomplishment of the very utmost beauty possible to human words, may be that to Autumn and that on a Grecian Urn".|$|E

500|$|After {{looking at}} agriculture, Cochrane {{considers}} {{the relationship between}} animals and genetic engineering. The question of whether an animal has a right not to be genetically engineered, he suggests, makes no sense, as live animals are not engineered, and embryos have no interests, so cannot have rights. Instead, Cochrane considers whether animals have a right {{not to have been}} engineered, arguing {{that it is not the}} case that they always do, and that if [...] "genetic engineering gives the animals lives with opportunities for well-being that are similar to or better than ordinary members of their species, then it is ordinarily permissible." [...] Cochrane then addresses four reasons to oppose this claim; first, the notion that genetic engineering instrumentalizes animals, second, the idea that genetic engineering is repugnant, third, that genetic engineering reveals a flaw in character (see virtue ethics) and fourth, that genetic engineering denies the dignity of animals. Cochrane finds none of these arguments reason to abandon the principle. Cochrane considers whether animals may <b>ever</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> right not to have been engineered. He argues that animals have a right not to be engineered such that they have lives not worth living. He then rejects some reasons for believing that animals have a right not to be engineered with diseases or disabilities, but concludes that they do, as engineered animals have an interest [...] "in having been engineered with sufficient opportunities for well-being", an interest which is strong enough to ground a concrete right. However, Cochrane argues that he is not advocating perfectionism, as he is concerned not with equal capacities between members of a species, but equal opportunities for well-being. Finally, Cochrane considers the possibility of engineering nonsentient, non-conscious livestock, arguing that, ordinarily, there is no wrong in engineering nonconscious entities.|$|E
500|$|Soon after sobering up, Stewie {{stretches}} {{and takes}} out a Jenny Craig Anytime Bar from his shopping bag. [...] Brian loses his temper with Stewie for not revealing that he had been storing food the entire time, and Stewie punishes him by only offering one of the Bars he doesn't want to eat himself (though Brian is happy to have it). After Brian calms down, Stewie asks Brian why he has a gun, noting that Brian is a staunch gun control proponent and seems like the last person who would <b>ever</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> gun. Brian doesn't {{want to talk about it}} at first, but eventually admits to Stewie's shock and disbelief that he has the gun in case he ever feels he has to commit suicide. Brian confesses that he cannot find his purpose in life, and finds comfort in knowing he has the option of killing himself. He admits that the Scotch was to be a last drink. Stewie then admits that he would be lost without Brian, claiming he is the only person in the world that he really cares about; he tells a skeptical Brian that his earlier ranting against Brian was only an attack because Brian verball attacked him, and he finally tells Brian he loves him. Brian tells Stewie he loves him back. In addition, Stewie reminds Brian that maybe making someone else happy is enough, because it is the best gift one person can give, for which Brian thanks him. Stewie falls asleep as Brian reads the beginning of David Copperfield to him. The following morning, the vault door opens, and Brian carries a sleeping Stewie and their belongings out of the room in silence. The episode plays the closing credits without music as well.|$|E

[...] However, he did consider that the expected completion of the road tunnel then under construction would make for much easier road access into Wainuiomata. [...] As the Hutt Valley portal of the tunnel was near Gracefield Station (off the end of Tunnel Grove), it would be prudent to consider the possibility of the increased importance of the Hutt Valley Industrial Line to serve Wainuiomata.|$|E

They wanted to do a strategic plan for the government of Sweden. I was on that case and looked at other governments. So I went around to other governments in Europe in 1976 and I was looking at Britain. I was looking at France. I was looking at other countries, and I could see that they were stymied by concentrations of power that prevented competition. And I thought, hmm, as bad as they are, ours was worse because we had very little room for private sector competition to the extent that we had government-controlled or union-controlled companies, and so you really didn't get the competition or the growth... And I said, well, if I <b>ever</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> chance, I'll change that." ...|$|E

[...] Christian thought that [...] "and Berlin" [...] would be an appropriate name for a band, and so when the band was looking for a name Christian suggested [...] "And Berlin," [...] which was then modified to [...] "Anberlin." ...|$|E

2500|$|Though plagued {{since its}} {{inception}} by low overall Nielsen ratings, Passions was historically top-rated in key demographics, namely the female 12–17 demographic; Passions and Days of Our Lives usually occupied the top two positions among all soaps in this age group. The series was not renewed by NBC for a full ninth season in 2007, with NBC instead deciding to extend its morning news and talk show Today to a fourth hour. NBC began shopping the series to other networks. In April 2007, Satellite provider DirecTV bought exclusive broadcasting rights from NBC to continue airing Passions, with most principal cast members staying on. As the series {{was coming to an}} end on NBC, the Passions Live talk show hosted by Eric Martsolf premiered in August 2007 every Thursday night on original-programming channel The 101, giving fans the chance to telephone the show and interact live with Passions cast members, making Passions the first and only soap opera to <b>ever</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> live talk show in U.S. history. Passions Live continued to air on Thursday nights after the series moved to DirecTV, until October 2007. The live show was also streaming live on the official Passions website at NBC.com. Passions ended its NBC run on September 7, 2007, and new episodes began airing on The 101 on September 17, 2007, making Passions both the first soap opera broadcast on a direct broadcast satellite service and the first series to make such a transition from broadcast television. The series ran Monday to Thursday at 2:00 pm ET/11 am PT on DirecTV, with repeats airing later in the day and on weekends. NBC.com continued to maintain Passions official website after the move to DirecTV. Initially, new episodes were only available on DirecTV and not at NBC.com or for purchase at iTunes. On September 27, 2007, DirecTV announced they would provide an [...] "All Access Pass to Passions" [...] to view all new episodes at NBC.com for a monthly fee. This service began on October 1, 2007 for $19.99 a month then reduced to $14.99 a month when Passions schedule was cut from four episodes a week to three episodes a week. After the series moved to DirecTV, the subscription service added a special feature where a trivia question relating to Passions would pop up, on each episode airing on The 101, for viewers to use their remote control to answer. Passions was the first soap opera to ever have this type of feature.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To examine {{differentials}} {{and time}} trends in self-reported Pap test rates by migrant status from the 1989 / 90 and 1995 Australian National Health Surveys (NHS). Method: Unit record data for females with {{the variables of}} interest were extracted from the 1989 / 90 and 1995 NHS and combined. The dichotomous outcome variables were 2 ̆ 7 <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> Pap test and 2 ̆ 7 <b>had</b> <b>a</b> Pap test within three years 2 ̆ 7. The principal study factor was country-of-birth, but language spoken at home (English or not) was also examined.
