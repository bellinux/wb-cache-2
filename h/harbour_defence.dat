5|$|The <b>harbour</b> <b>defence</b> {{companies}} {{were responsible for}} local defence and {{for the security of}} the ships and submarines moored in the harbour. These companies and the <b>harbour</b> <b>defence</b> boats used to patrol the river were under the command of Harbour Commander Korvettenkapitän Kellerman. The 333rd Infantry Division was the German Army unit responsible for the defence of the coast between St Nazaire and Lorient. The division had no troops based in the town, but some were located in villages nearby and would be able to respond to any attack on the port.|$|E
5|$|The {{area was}} not {{substantially}} reoccupied until Alfred the Great decided {{to rebuild the}} harbour as a defence against raiders. He built the town that later became Christchurch, {{on the north side}} of the harbour. Access to Salisbury up the River Avon made this a more strategic place. The Head may have been used for <b>harbour</b> <b>defence</b> at this time. In the 11th century, some of the iron-ore rich stones found at the Head were used in the construction of Christchurch Castle. These reddish-coloured stones can still be seen in the base of the now ruined castle.|$|E
5|$|Iron Duke {{remained}} {{on active duty}} {{for only a few}} more years; in 1930, the London Naval Treaty specified that the four Iron Duke-class battleships be scrapped or otherwise demilitarised. Iron Duke was therefore converted into a gunnery training ship; her armour and much of her armament was removed to render her unfit for combat. She served in this capacity until the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, when she was moored in Scapa Flow as a <b>harbour</b> <b>defence</b> ship. In October, she was badly damaged by German bombers and was run aground to avoid sinking. She continued to serve as an anti-aircraft platform {{for the duration of the}} war, and was eventually refloated and broken up for scrap in the late 1940s.|$|E

5|$|The unusual {{behaviour}} of {{the bombers}} concerned Kapitän zur See Mecke. At 00:00 on 28 March, {{he issued a}} warning {{that there might be}} a parachute landing in progress. At 01:00 on 28 March, he followed up by ordering all guns to cease firing and searchlights to be extinguished in case the bombers were using them to locate the port. Everyone was placed on a heightened state of alert. The <b>harbour</b> <b>defence</b> companies and ships' crews were ordered out of the air raid shelters. During all this a lookout reported seeing some activity out at sea, so Mecke began suspecting some type of landing and ordered extra attention to be paid to the approaches to the harbour.|$|E
5|$|Both {{ships were}} {{assigned}} to the Channel Fleet upon commissioning in 1865. Scorpion was refitted in 1867 with a flying bridge that connected the forecastle to the poop, above the tops of the turrets, and her sailing rig was reduced to a fore-and-aft rig. The ship recommissioned in 1868 for another tour with the Channel Fleet. She arrived in Bermuda in November 1869 where she became the local guard ship. In 1873 a proposal was made to remove her poop and forecastle, masts and deck fitting to convert her to a <b>harbour</b> <b>defence</b> monitor with all-around fire, but this was deemed too expensive and the project was abandoned in 1878. At some point during her service in Bermuda her rigging was removed and she was reduced to simple pole masts. The ship was fitted with searchlights and quick-firing guns in 1890. Scorpion was sunk as a target in 1901; she was raised in 1902 and sold in February 1903 for £736. She sank while under tow to Boston, Massachusetts.|$|E
25|$|The RAN's 20th Minesweeping Flotilla was {{assigned}} {{the task of}} sweeping Australian waters for mines. The flotilla was based at Cairns, Queensland and was commanded from the sloop HMAS Swan. Clearance operations began in December 1945, and were generally conducted by Bathurst class corvettes. Ships involved included HMAS Swan, Ararat, Cowra, Deloraine, Echuca, Katoomba, Lithgow, Mildura and Warrnambool as well as <b>harbour</b> <b>defence</b> motor launches 1323, 1328, 1329 and general purpose vessels 960 and 963.

5000|$|During the First World War, the harbour {{was used}} as a naval base to cover the [...] "Western Approaches", an anti-submarine net was added and further {{upgrades}} were applied to <b>harbour</b> <b>defences.</b> After the Irish War of Independence, under the Anglo-Irish Treaty the <b>harbour</b> <b>defences</b> remained in the control of British government. These Treaty Port installations, including Fort Camden, were handed-over to the Irish authorities in July 1938. The fort was renamed Fort Meagher for Thomas Francis Meagher - who had fought in the Young Irelander Rebellion of 1848.

25|$|Reilly {{would have}} an even greater success in January 1904, when he and Chinese {{engineer}} acquaintance Ho Liangshung allegedly stole the Port Arthur <b>harbour</b> <b>defence</b> plans for the Japanese Navy. Guided by these stolen plans, the Japanese Navy navigated through the Russian minefield protecting the harbour and launched a surprise attack on Port Arthur {{on the night of}} 8–9 February 1904 (Monday 8 February – Tuesday 9 February). Yet the stolen plans did not help the Japanese much. More than 31,000 Russians ultimately perished defending Port Arthur, but Japanese losses were much higher, losses that nearly undermined their war effort.|$|E
25|$|Jervois then {{served as}} Governor of New Zealand from 1883 to 1888. In this role, Jervois {{provided}} advice on <b>harbour</b> <b>defence,</b> guided the colonial government on Imperial matters, {{was active in}} the country's social life, and worked to promote equality. He officiated at the opening of Auckland University College in 1883, declaring that it would be accessible to all New Zealanders, and recognised the service of nurses in the Zululand conflict, awarding a Royal Red Cross to a New Zealand woman for the first time. He also engaged with the Maori leadership. He also {{served as president of the}} New Zealand Institute and patronised many sporting institutions, including the New Zealand Amateur Rowing Association.|$|E
25|$|Commissioned {{into the}} Royal Canadian Navy on 1 April 1921 at Halifax {{it took two}} months to make CH-15 and her sister operational. By July 1921 both boats were {{functioning}} and exercised {{with the rest of}} the Canadian armed forces practicing <b>harbour</b> <b>defence.</b> While in service the submarine was used primarily for training anti-submarine warfare. After arguing that remaining at Halifax during the winter months would be detrimental to the vessels' status, CH-15 and her sister, accompanied by , wintered at Bermuda. The two submarines returned to Halifax in April 1922. Following the election of Mackenzie King government, the Naval Service was required to cut expenditures. Upon their return it was found that the government had refused to pay for the upkeep of the submarines and they were paid off on 22 June 1922.|$|E
50|$|In 1907 the War Office {{decided to}} hand all {{submarine}} mining duties over to Militia units and the Volunteer submarine miners were converted into electrical engineers to continue manning the electric searchlights of the <b>harbour</b> <b>defences.</b> The Liverpool unit was briefly retitled the Mersey Division Electrical Engineers.|$|R

25|$|As D-Day approached, Allied {{planners}} {{moved on}} to tactical deceptions (roughly {{under the umbrella of}} Fortitude) to help cover the progress of the real invasion forces. The D-Day naval deceptions (Taxable and Glimmer) were planned for the eve of the Normandy landings to develop threats against the Pas-de-Calais involving No. 218 Squadron and No. 617 Squadron of the Royal Air Force and <b>Harbour</b> <b>Defence</b> Motor Launch's of the home fleet. Titanic was intended as an accompaniment to these deceptions, as well as to create general confusion for the defending forces on the morning of D-Day. It simulated paratrooper drops (using dummies and small numbers of SAS personnel). The idea for Titanic originated from a plan submitted by David Strangeways (head of the tactical deception unit of 21st Army Group) which in turn was a rewrite of a plan from the Supreme HQ Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF) Ops (B).|$|E
25|$|The Official History {{records that}} the AA {{artillery}} in Tobruk was 'incessantly in action against attacks of all kinds, from all heights, but especially by dive-bombers'. The regimental historian notes that these Stuka attacks concentrated on gun positions, {{which was a}} serious threat to HAA sites, whose instruments could not cope with the rapid height changes. The gunners devised a tactic of opening fire with short fuzes just before the dive started, to force the pilots to fly through a ring of bursts. The battery cooks, drivers and clerks then joined in, firing machine-guns and captured 20mm Breda guns. This aggressive method was known as 'Porcupine', and was so effective that the Luftwaffe changed to high-level bombing. Each mobile HAA troop established at least one alternative site and the guns were regularly switched between them, the empty sites being rigged up as dummies. The two available gun laying (GL Mk I) radar sets had to be positioned away from the vulnerable gun sites and used for early warning to supplement the single RAF radar, and a ring of searchlights operated round the harbour at night. <b>Harbour</b> <b>defence</b> was by pre-arranged barrages by five of the six HAA troops, the sixth troop remaining on watch for other raiders. 152 Battery dug in west of the harbour engaged 1000 enemy aircraft in a six-month period. 4th AA Brigade recorded that there was a steady decline in numbers of aircraft attacking as the siege went on, with the attackers switching to high-level and night attacks. In the last two months of the siege, troops of HAA guns took it in turn to move out to the perimeter and take on ground targets under the control of 9th Australian Division. Their long-range harassing fire made up for the shortage of medium artillery. In September 1941, the batteries of 51st HAA Rgt were relieved and left Tobruk by sea to rejoin RHQ for rest and refit in Palestine.|$|E
500|$|<b>Harbour</b> <b>defence</b> craft {{included}} the anti-submarine vessels [...] and Bingera; the auxiliary minesweepers HMAS Goonambee and pleasure launches converted to channel patrol boats (and armed with depth charges), namely , Lolita, Steady Hour, , [...] Marlean, and and four unarmed auxiliary patrol boats.|$|E
50|$|A Pacific Command {{was created}} in 1942 also, and was disbanded in 1945. During the war a range of coastal defences were constructed, {{including}} <b>harbour</b> <b>defences</b> for Vancouver.

500|$|Wivern burst {{one of her}} 9-inch guns in 1867, {{but none}} of the 13 people in the turret was injured. She was given the same sort of refit as her sister ship in Devonport {{beginning}} in August 1868. The ship became the guard ship at Hull from January through October 1870 and was then placed in [...] from 1870 until 1880. That year she was sent to Hong Kong where she became the <b>harbour</b> <b>defence</b> ship. Wivern became a distilling ship in 1898 and was sold in May 1922 for scrap.|$|E
500|$|The gunboat [...] was nearby bombarding enemy positions, and {{diverted}} to the Saien following the explosion.

500|$|The Kriegsmarine (German navy) had {{at least}} three surface ships in the Loire estuary: a destroyer, an armed trawler and a Sperrbrecher (minesweeper), the latter being the guard ship for the port. On {{the night of the}} raid there were also four <b>harbour</b> <b>defence</b> boats and ten ships from the 16th and 42nd Minesweeper flotillas berthed in the basin, while two tankers were berthed inside the Normandie dock. [...] The 6th and 7th U-boat flotillas, {{commanded}} by Kapitänleutnant Georg-Wilhelm Schulz and Korvettenkapitän Herbert Sohler respectively, were permanently based in the port. It is not known how many submarines were present {{on the day of the}} raid. The submarine base had been inspected by the U-boat Commander in Chief, Vizeadmiral Karl Dönitz, the day before the raid. He asked what would they do if the base was subject to an attack by British Commandos. Sohler replied that [...] "an attack on the base would be hazardous and highly improbable".|$|E
500|$|In his report, Bruat {{informed}} {{his superiors}} that [...] "verything {{may be expected}} from these formidable engines of war." [...] The effectiveness of the ironclad batteries in neutralizing the Russian guns, though still debated by naval historians, nevertheless convinced French Emperor Napoleon III to order more ironclad warships. Their success at Kinburn, coupled with the devastating effect new shell-firing guns had had on wooden warships at the Battle of Sinop earlier in the war led most French naval officers to support the new armoured vessels. Napoleon III's programme produced the first sea-going ironclad, , initiating a naval construction race between France and Britain that would last until {{the outbreak of the}} Franco-Prussian War in 1870. The British Royal Navy, which had five ironclad batteries under construction, laid down another four after the victory at Kinburn, and replied to Gloire with a pair of armoured frigates of their own, [...] and [...] France built a further eleven batteries built to three different designs, and the Russian Navy built fifteen armoured rafts for <b>harbour</b> <b>defence.</b>|$|E
500|$|During {{the night}} of 8 June, Horthy left the naval base of Pola in the upper Adriatic with the {{dreadnought}} battleships [...] and [...] At about 23:00 on 9 June 1918, after some difficulties getting the <b>harbour</b> <b>defence</b> barrage opened, the dreadnoughts [...] and , escorted by one destroyer and six torpedo boats, including 76T, also departed Pola and set course for Slano, north of Ragusa, to rendezvous with Horthy {{in preparation for a}} coordinated attack on the Otranto Barrage. About 03:15 on 10 June, while returning from an uneventful patrol off the Dalmatian coast, two Italian Navy (...) MAS boats, MAS 15 and MAS 21, spotted the smoke from the Austrian ships. Both boats successfully penetrated the escort screen and split to engage the dreadnoughts individually. MAS 21 attacked Tegetthoff, but her torpedoes missed. Under the command of Luigi Rizzo, MAS 15 fired two torpedoes at 03:25, both of which hit Szent István. Both boats evaded pursuit although Rizzo had to discourage 76T by dropping depth charges in his wake. The torpedo hits on Szent István were abreast her boiler rooms, which flooded, knocking out power to the pumps. Szent István capsized less than three hours after being torpedoed.|$|E
50|$|The {{location}} of the site reflects the prevailing view of Sir Joseph John Talbot Hobbs that potential enemies would mount seaborne rather than aerial attacks. The Artillery Barracks were designed to service the two batteries at Arthur (Arthur Head) and Forrest (North Fremantle) Forts, {{as part of the}} Fremantle <b>Harbour</b> <b>defences</b> prior to World War I.|$|R
50|$|Southsea Common {{is a large}} {{expanse of}} mown {{grassland}} parallel to the shore from Clarence Pier to Southsea Castle.
