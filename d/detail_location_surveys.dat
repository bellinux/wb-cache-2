40|$|Because {{the cost}} of {{third-party}} construction quality assurance (CQA) of geomembrane liner installations is typically comparable to {{the cost of}} the geomembrane liner, CQA must be optimized to obtain the most benefit for the owner, rate payers, and environment. A regulation-based CQA protocol usually includes testing the material, observing the quality control (QC) program ofthe liner installer, and performing destructive tests on samples of the geomembrane seams. Another well-established type of third-party CQA is leak <b>location</b> <b>surveys</b> using an electrical leak location method. This paper compares representative costs, benefits, and results of the two types of CQA used on geomembrane liners where both types were used. The relative merits of the two types of CQA are discussed. Examples of direct cost benefits are also presented. A large percent of regulation-based CQA is the destructive testing of double wedge welded seams. Industry experience has shown that these welds seldom fail, and they require the test area to be repaired using a much longer length of inferior extrusion welding. Leak <b>location</b> <b>surveys</b> have shown that construction damage caused while placing protective drainage material on the geomembrane is a far more significant problem than double wedge welded seam failure. A much better cost benefit can be realized if {{a significant part of the}} resources spent on destructive testing of seams is used for electrical leak <b>location</b> <b>surveys</b> to eliminate construction damage...|$|R
40|$|Industrial <b>location</b> <b>surveys</b> {{typically}} generate large {{data sets}} {{with information on}} the characteristics of the companies and plants involved {{as well as on the}} relative importance of different locational push and pull factors. Since for the majority of companies locational choice results from the consideration of a range of factors, discriminant analysis can be used to reveal the important groupings of factors which distinguish the choices made by alternative subgroups of firms in a sample or population. This paper uses the results of the 581 -firm 1980 S�o Paulo industrial <b>location</b> <b>survey</b> to examine some of the issues and specification choices which arise in using the discriminant model for this purpose. The results presented highlight the plant characteristics and the locational pull factors which distinguish industrial moves from the S�o Paulo metropolitan area out to surrounding cities from moves within the area. ...|$|R

40|$|Location-awareness {{is crucial}} to many {{applications}} of sensor networks. Existing <b>location</b> <b>surveying</b> approaches either rely on an inflexible infrastructure or suffer from high computation and communication load. In this paper, we present Non-intEractive <b>lOcation</b> <b>Surveying</b> (NEOS) to address certain deficiencies in the existing approaches. The key contribution of NEOS is twofold: (i) it employs a mobile beacon to introduce mobility-differentiated time-of-arrival (MDToA) observations, a special form of time difference of arrival (TDoA), at the node side and (ii) it involves simple computations and entails no node-to-node communication. MDToA enables us to devise flexible and robust positioning algorithms; the resulting computational load fully obeys the processing constraints of sensor nodes. Furthermore, the non-interactive feature of NEOS allows of a substantial reduction on the nodes energy consumption. We have implemented a preliminary prototype of NEOS using CricketMotes. Our experiments with this prototype demonstrate a location accuracy within 2 cm in a 16 m^ 2 area...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Being a part {{of social}} life, Shopping Centers become more popular and they {{represent}} the environments where consumption comes into prominence. However, in the recent years, Shopping Centers are seen as places combining consumption activities and time killing activities. Since number of Shopping Centers is at peak in big cities, attempts are made to open Shopping Centers in places other than big cities in accordance with population density, economic and social data. However, {{it is observed that}} geographical location and neighborhood relations are not taken into consideration in <b>location</b> <b>surveys</b> in cities other than major cities. Yet, such variables have major role at decision making stage. In this study a model based on geographical information system (GIS) was created and decision making process was analysed with the purpose of <b>location</b> <b>survey</b> of Shopping Centers to be opened across the geographical regions by taking population density, economic and social data, quality of life, geographical and spatial data.
