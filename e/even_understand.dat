The line was later changed from [...] "non-fictional" [...] to [...] "non-Brazilian". Groening was confused {{as to the}} reason for the change, since he liked the original so much. In fact, he did not <b>even</b> <b>understand</b> what the new line implied.|$|E
500|$|Antiscience and neo-Luddite {{conspiracy}} theorists emphasize technology forecasting in their New World Order conspiracy theories. They {{speculate that the}} global power elite are reactionary modernists pursuing a transhumanist agenda to develop and use human enhancement technologies {{in order to become}} a [...] "posthuman ruling caste", while change accelerates toward a technological singularity—a theorized future point of discontinuity when events will accelerate at such a pace that normal unenhanced humans will be unable to predict or <b>even</b> <b>understand</b> the rapid changes occurring in the world around them. Conspiracy theorists fear the outcome will either be the emergence of a Brave New World-like dystopia—a [...] "Brave New World Order"—or the extinction of the human species.|$|E

It was shocking to find myself in that situation, where I was that celebrity person." [...] At the 2013 Social Star Awards, PewDiePie greeted his fans personally despite security warning him against doing so.

500|$|With a {{new name}} and label, the band {{released}} its second album, New American Gospel, in September 2000. Patrick Kennedy of Allmusic compared the band to Pantera stating, [...] "The essential signatures of post-Pantera metal are in abundance on Lamb of God's inaugural album. New American Gospel provides a mighty oak upon which gritty American metal's faith is maintained, effectively bridging the '90s' insistence upon drill-sergeant technicality and the old school's determined focus on riff construction." [...] Chris Adler commented: [...] "This is a classic record. We had all the elements come together to make one of the heaviest, yet contagious records of our career. It was difficult to contain us—we didn't <b>even</b> <b>understand</b> at the time what we had created." ...|$|E

[...] "The food was delicious," [...] Shabazz {{recalled}} in 1992, [...] "I'd never tasted food like that." [...] After dinner, the woman asked Sanders {{to come to the}} Muslims' lecture. Sanders agreed. After the speech, the nurse's aide invited Sanders to join the Nation of Islam; Sanders politely declined. When the woman asked her why she chose not to join the Nation of Islam after visiting, Sanders replied that she did not know she had been brought there to join. [...] "Besides, my mother would kill me, and additionally I don’t <b>even</b> <b>understand</b> the philosophy." [...] The Malloys were Methodists, and when she was 13, Sanders had decided she would remain a Methodist {{for the rest of her}} life.|$|E

500|$|The album {{features}} aggressive multi-tracking of D'Angelo's voice, {{a technique}} {{similar to the}} production of Sly & the Family Stone's There's a Riot Goin' On (1971) and Marvin Gaye's Let's Get It On (1973). The multi-tracking on Voodoo significantly affected the clarity of D'Angelo's vocals. In Voodoos liner notes, Saul Williams wrote of its heavy use of multi-tracking, stating [...] "You might respond, 'Lyrics? Yo, I can't <b>even</b> <b>understand</b> half the shit that D'Angelo be saying. That nigga sounds like Bobby McFerrin on opium'. And I'd say, 'You're right. Neither can I. But I am drawn {{to figure out what it}} is that he's saying. His vocal collaging intrigues me'". Music writers have also noted the production style and sound of Voodoo as reminiscent of the sound of the P-Funk opus Mothership Connection (1975), Gaye's downtempo disco-soul record I Want You (1976), and Miles Davis's jazz fusion works In a Silent Way (1969) and Bitches Brew (1970).|$|E

2500|$|According to Antonia Parvanova, {{one of the}} {{difficulties}} of dealing legally {{with the issue of}} DV is that men in many male dominated societies do not understand that inflicting violence against their wives is against the law.

2500|$|When {{tradition}} {{thus becomes}} master, {{it does so}} {{in such a way}} that what it 'transmits' is made so inaccessible, proximally and for the most part, that it rather becomes concealed. Tradition takes what has come down to us and delivers it over to self-evidence; it blocks our access to those primordial 'sources' from which the categories and concepts handed down to us have been in part quite genuinely drawn. Indeed it makes us forget that they have had such an origin, and makes us suppose that the necessity of going back to these sources is something which we need not <b>even</b> <b>understand.</b> (Being and Time, p. 43) ...|$|E

2500|$|Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly, in {{reviewing}} the new film states that the Star Trek franchise had [...] "devolved into a near-irrelevant cultural joke, likely to inspire giggles and unprintable curses from even its most ardent supporters." [...] Leonard Nimoy wondered in 2003 {{whether or not the}} franchise [...] "had run its course". Director J. J. Abrams argued [...] "people [...] <b>even</b> <b>understand</b> what Star Trek means anymore", and joked that a parody like Galaxy Quest which [...] "mocks the paradigm" [...] made the task of producing a credible Star Trek film that much more challenging. Even on set, Abrams felt nervous [...] "with all these tattooed faces and pointy ears, bizarre weaponry and Romulan linguists, with dialogue about 'Neutral Zones' and 'Starfleet'". In covering the relaunch film, Jensen remarked the series' optimistic nature ran counter to an increasingly cynical culture, and that the film had been delayed from December 2008 to May 2009 to [...] "rehab" [...] the series' image.|$|E
