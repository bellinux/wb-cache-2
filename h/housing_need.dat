According to the City of Calgary, [...] "Beginning in 1992 with the first Biennial Count of Homeless Persons, The City focused its research efforts on issues of poverty and shelter. An Affordable Housing Strategy was prepared in 2002, which called for {{a greater understanding of}} <b>housing</b> <b>need</b> in Calgary. The Calgary Committee to End Homelessness was formed in 2007 consisting of government representatives as well as business and community leaders. The result was Calgary's 10-Year Plan to End Homelessness, which was released in 2008 and is being implemented by the Calgary Homeless Foundation." [...] Alberta and Calgary have been leaders within Canada in addressing homelessness. Calgary was the first among Canada's large cities to adopt a ten-year plan to address the issue. As a result, the city experienced an 11.4% decrease in homelessness between 2008 and 2012.|$|E
2500|$|Early {{resistance}} from potential host communities over financial impact concerns {{meant that the}} committee had two choices: to stop the project {{and wait for the}} problems to be resolved, or push ahead, utilizing the powers granted in the Lanham Act powers to overrule local resistance, [...] but creating a great deal of friction that could potentially effect the project's future success. [...] The <b>housing</b> <b>need</b> was so great, though, that the only viable choice was the second one, and they pushed forward to find a site. [...] Consciously attempting to avoid conflict, the committee tried to assure potential host communities that projects built within the mutual ownership program would pay real taxes, and not make payments in lieu of taxes as outlined in the Lanham Act of 1940. [...] They also petitioned the United States Congress to provide additional funds to host communities {{that would allow them to}} expand public services and facilities without imposing additional local taxes. But the financial concerns of the residents only served to exacerbate other local fears about the new project. [...] Many defense workers took these other fears very personally.|$|E

2500|$|The defense {{workers of}} the Kearny Shipyards had {{realized}} early in 1940 that a great <b>housing</b> <b>need</b> was developing in the northern New Jersey area. These workers were early, and vocal, supporters of the National Housing for Defense Act of 1940, {{also known as the}} Lanham Act, and the mutual housing program. In January, 1941, a report on the housing requirements of the northern New Jersey area indicated that 1000 units were needed immediately, and the Defense Housing Coordinator approved the construction of a 300 unit project in the Newark/ Harrison area, and a 700 unit project [...] "to be built as a project itself sponsored by a responsible committee of the defense workers who will live in them." [...] The housing committee had seven working policies that it had developed, and that it wanted applied to the workers' housing, all of which they believed conformed with the original intentions of the Lanham Act of 1940 ("The housing is to be wherever feasible of a permanent nature, and after the emergency has passed these homes are to be disposed of, and in that way the Government is to recoup the initial investment... and they will be available for permanent homes." [...] The cost per unit was set at, and not permitted to exceed, $3000.00.) and fit well within the mutual housing program.|$|E
2500|$|On November 30, 1941, {{just eight}} {{days prior to}} the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor {{and the start of}} direct United States {{involvement}} in the Second World War, tenants of the last mutual ownership project (Winfield Park, New Jersey) began to move into their new homes. The outbreak of war ignited the smoldering debate over permanent vs. temporary housing for the defense workers. Early shortages of materials, equipment and manpower for construction, along with the early retreat of the allied forces on all fronts, added support to the argument that emergency housing should be only of temporary nature, and not built in support of long-term postwar goals. The construction of temporary housing quickly became the program's emphasis. But the mutual housing program was based on long-term financial planning for the construction of permanent housing, and could not function with this new temporary construction emphasis. [...] Support for centralizing the defense housing effort was also increasing, and resulted in the February 24, 1942 establishment of the National Housing Agency by Executive Order of the President. Those individuals sympathetic to centralization were not very supportive of experimental housing programs. Even prior to the formal outbreak of war, the entire defense housing program, under pressure from Congressional conservatives and industry officials, began to make a significant switch to private sector initiatives to get the defense housing job done. Supporters of this new direction strongly believed that private industry was far more efficient, and [...] "..could utilize a few lots here and a favorably located site there, wholly unsuitable for large-scale Government projects." [...] Congressional support of the private construction industry came in the legislative form of Title IV of the Lanham Act, passed in the Spring of 1941. This legislation provided 100% financing for speculative builders of housing for workers in defense areas. Obviously Title IV was meant to serve the same housing market as the mutual housing program. Evidence also suggests that the staff of the NHA was far more conservative than had been the staff of the FWA. This swing to the right was completed when 700 members of the consolidated staff were laid off; many of those leaving were among the most progressive, and many programs, including the mutual housing program, were officially ended. This newly consolidated agency moved quickly to develop programs that were especially supportive of private initiative programs for solving the defense <b>housing</b> <b>need,</b> and generally supportive of Title IV. [...] Colonel Lawrence Westbrook noted in 1945 testimony that the NHA had destroyed the mutual housing program even at a time when requests for expansion of the program were pouring in from across the nation. Although news of the mutual housing concept had spread quickly through the labor union network, and many committees had been organized by workers to aid the implementation of the plan locally, all committees had to be told that the program was experimental in nature and no more staff could be made available to work with them.|$|E

40|$|The {{accuracy}} of forecasting of <b>housing</b> <b>needs</b> and demand {{is crucial to}} the preparation of development plan because residential land constitutes a greater share of the developed area of cities. Presently, many common methods are based on aggregate method, headship rates, household size, backlog and other accounting methods. Many of these methods have their strengths and weaknesses contributed by the assumptions and â€˜intelligent guessesâ€™ used in the calculations. This paper aims to explore alternative method of forecasting <b>housing</b> <b>needs</b> and demand by using Life Cycle Matrix. As a household undergoes change of stages in family life cycle, oneâ€™s <b>housing</b> <b>needs</b> and demand are experiencing gradual change. Therefore, it is essential to consider the life cycle change of a household in the analysis and forecasting of <b>housing</b> <b>needs</b> and demands. Life Cycle Matrix was initiated in Japan in 1980 s to estimate <b>housing</b> <b>needs</b> based on population cohort and household distribution pattern.

40|$|Purpose – Despite {{the role}} of post {{conflict}} housing reconstruction in establishing the development of peace in conflict affected countries, there are many issues which hinder its success. While the inconsideration of <b>housing</b> <b>needs</b> in post conflict housing reconstruction has directly or indirectly given rise {{for most of the}} issues, the countries emerging from conflicts face many challenges in addressing such <b>housing</b> <b>needs.</b> Therefore, {{the purpose of this paper}} is to explore the management of <b>housing</b> <b>needs</b> in post conflict housing reconstruction. This paper aims to focus on identifying the challenges in addressing <b>housing</b> <b>needs</b> within the context of post conflict housing reconstruction in Sri Lanka. Design/methodology/approach – The study used the grounded theory approach to collect and analyse the data collected through 37 in-depth interviews, conducted with policy makers, practitioners, academics and housing beneficiaries in Sri Lanka. Primary data were verified through a documents review. Findings – The paper reveals that addressing <b>housing</b> <b>needs</b> in post conflict housing reconstruction in Sri Lanka is challenging, due to several factors. These include the socio economic profile of conflict affected people, conflict sensitive issues, donor requirements, limited availability of finance, weakened government administration, extent of housing and infrastructure damage, attitudes of affected people, land-related issues and shortage of labour and material. Originality/value – A number of studies have identified the challenges of post conflict reconstruction. This study particularly identifies the challenges of addressing <b>housing</b> <b>needs</b> in post conflict housing reconstruction. These findings are useful for policy makers to develop strategies in addressing <b>housing</b> <b>needs</b> in post conflict housing reconstruction...|$|R

Data was collected through un-structured interviews conducted with 37 participants, comprising policy makers, practitioners, academics and beneficiaries who engaged in post conflict housing reconstruction in Sri Lanka. Gaps were mainly found in conflict sensitivity, measures related to physical housing, performance of implementing agencies, policy and practice issues. On the job training, application of ‘do no harm’ principles, enhanced beneficiary participation, enhanced accountability, effective monitoring, enhanced knowledge sharing, adequate drinking water facilities, irrigation development and initiatives for material manufacturing were suggested as recommendations to minimise these gaps.

40|$|Post {{conflict}} housing reconstruction {{plays an}} important role in establishing the country’s development and prospect of peace. Despite this importance, it was identified that there are inconsistencies between the provision of built <b>housing</b> and the <b>needs</b> of the users. Therefore many post conflict housing reconstruction projects lead to dissatisfaction on the part of residents and remodelling by themselves or rejection and abandonment. Hence it is important and necessary to address conflict affected communities’ <b>housing</b> reconstruction <b>needs</b> in post conflict housing reconstruction. With regard to this, it is worthwhile to examine the concept of <b>housing</b> <b>needs</b> in general and to explore the <b>housing</b> <b>needs</b> of conflict affected communities. Therefore this paper aims to present a synthesis of <b>housing</b> <b>needs</b> literature relevant to usual and post conflict contexts. In relevance to <b>housing</b> <b>needs</b> in general, <b>housing</b> preferences in a market context and adequate housing measures were identified. Following this, <b>housing</b> <b>needs</b> of conflict affected communities were identified. In a market context, <b>housing</b> <b>needs</b> were exhibited in terms of the subjective preferences of households. Adequate housing was recognized as part of the right to an adequate standard of living in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in the 1966 International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Hence adequate housing measures identified certain aspects of housing that must be taken into account for this purpose in any particular context. Whilst most housing considerations of conflict affected communities were similar to adequate housing measures, conflict affected communities gave greater importance to their social, cultural and religious values in post conflict housing reconstruction. In addition they considered the aspects of safety and security as being vital, and various perceptions of these communities in relation to housing reconstruction and post occupancy evaluation were important in post conflict housing reconstruction. Nevertheless, no relevant data on special <b>housing</b> <b>needs</b> of disadvantaged groups in post conflict environments were found...|$|R
