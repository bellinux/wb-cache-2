He claimed he had {{purchased}} 10 vials of <b>hashish</b> <b>oil</b> for $150 for his own use. He was also in possession of $619.45 which {{he claimed to have}} received from a government program. Despite Oakes' protests that the vials were meant for pain relief and that the money he had was from a workers' compensation cheque, Section 8 of the Narcotic Control Act (NCA) established a 'rebuttable presumption" [...] that possession of a narcotic inferred an intention to traffic unless the accused established the absence of such an intention.|$|E

50|$|After {{revisions}} to cannabis rescheduling in the UK, the government moved cannabis {{back from a}} class C to a class B drug. A purported reason was the appearance of high potency cannabis. They believe skunk accounts for between 70 and 80% of samples seized by police (despite the fact that skunk can sometimes be incorrectly mistaken {{for all types of}} herbal cannabis). Extracts such as <b>hashish</b> and hash <b>oil</b> typically contain more THC than high potency cannabis flowers.|$|R
40|$|Cannabis, or {{marijuana}} (MJ), {{is perhaps}} the most widely used illegal drug in the United States and worldwide. Approximately one in two young Americans (18 – 25 years) have tried marijuana at least once in their lifetime, and one in six has used within the past month (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration 2006). All forms of the drug (<b>hashish,</b> resin, <b>oil)</b> are extracted from the plant Cannabis sativa, in particular the buds of female plants. Ingestion of the drug by humans occurs through three prin-cipal routes: smoking in a cigarette, pipe, or bong (often with tobacco as a burning aid); inhalation of vapors from the rap-idly heated drug; or oral ingestion in a fat-rich substance. In all forms of the drug, the primary psychoactive ingredient is delta- 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), although there are about 60 other cannabinoid compounds in the resin of C...|$|R

40|$|Plant {{poisoning}} occurs less commonly in {{dogs and}} cats than in herbivorous livestock, but numerous cases have been documented worldwide, most of them caused by common and internationally widely cultivated ornamental garden and house plants. Few cases of poisoning of cats and dogs {{have been reported in}} southern Africa, but many of the plants that have caused poisoning in these species elsewhere are widely available in the subregion and are briefly reviewed in terms of toxic principles, toxicity, species affected, clinical signs, and prognosis. The list includes Melia azedarach (syringa), Brunfelsia spp. (yesterday, today and tomorrow), Datura stramonium (jimsonweed, stinkblaar), a wide variety of lilies and lily-like plants, cycads, plants that contain soluble oxalates, plants containing cardiac glycosides and other cardiotoxins and euphorbias (Euphorbia pulcherrima, E. tirucalli). Poisoning by plant products such as macadamia nuts, onions and garlic, grapes and raisins, cannabis (marijuana, dagga) or <b>hashish</b> and castor <b>oil</b> seed or seedcake is also discussed.

40|$|Biochemical complexity. Cannabis sativa L. {{is one of}} {{the species}} with the most {{numerous}} and diverse uses in economy. It can be grown in most climates, is drought resistant, and requires little fertilizers, minimal pesticides or herbicides. Hemp is a very important plant by economical point of view for fibres, seeds, oils, {{as well as for the}} chemical constituents with large medical valences and uses in some diseases therapy or in amelioration of certain health troubles. This plant has an extremely complex and diverse chemical constitution. The hemp plants and the crude drug products thereof (marijuana, <b>hashish,</b> and hash <b>oil)</b> are characterized by a wide variety of chemical compounds. There are almost 500 (483 compounds, according to Grotenhermen and Russo, 2002; 525 compounds, according to Radwan et al., 2009) different identifiable chemical substances. The best-known and most specific class of hemp constituents is represented by the C 21 terpenophenolic cannabinoids. Other phenol compounds include flavonoids, spiroindans, dihydrostilbenes, phenanthrenes, and dihydrophenanthrenes. The hemp specific flavour is due to volatile terpenes of essential oils, monoterpenes representing 47. 9 to 92. 1 %, and sesquiterpenes 5. 2 - 48. 6 % of total terpenes (Mediavilla and Steinemann, 1977). This specific flavour is used in training up of the dogs in view to track down the drug storehouses. The physiological role of volatile oils and resin is less known, probably they contribute to insect attraction or they act as protective mechanisms against animals. Also, the ether oils diminish the plant transpiration at high temperatures...|$|R

40|$|The {{legal status}} of {{cannabis}} for personal use {{is one of the}} most controversial policy issues in the European Union. Although cannabis is a classified narcotic drug placed under control by the United Nations and by all EU Member States, the measures adopted to control it at national level vary considerably, as shown in the table below. Cannabis extracts — marijuana, <b>hashish</b> and cannabis <b>oil</b> — are classified as narcotic drugs under both Schedules I and IV of the 1961 United Nations Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs. Art. 36 requests State Parties to “adopt such measures as will ensure that …possession… of drugs contrary to the provisions of this Convention… shall be punishable offences when committed intentionally [...] . ”. The active principles of cannabis, the cannabinoids THC and specifically dronabinol (delta- 9 -THC), are classified as psychotropic substances under Schedules I and II respectively of the 1971 United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances. Art 22 of this echoes the terms of the 1961 Convention above, stating that “each Party shall treat as a punishable offence, when committed intentionally, any action contrary to a law or regulation adopted in pursuance of its obligations under this Convention… “. Finally, the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic of 1988, Art. 3 requests establishment of a criminal offence for possession of drugs for the purposes of trafficking (Art. 3. 1 (a) (iii)), and for the possession for personal consumption (Art. 3. 2). This latter has been the subject of a wide range of interpretations and analyses; see ELDD’s Legal Reports for example the EMCDDA thematic paper “Illicit drug use in the EU: legislative approaches”, section 1, and Chapter 7 of A Cannabis Reader, EMCDDA Monograph 8; Cannabis Control in Europe...|$|R
40|$|Cannabis use is common, {{controversial}} and its clinical toxicology is likely under-recognised. A 56 -year-old man presented with disabling shortness of breath. He smoked up to 7 g cannabis daily for 25 years (maximum 63 875 g) plus {{large amounts of}} <b>hashish</b> <b>oil.</b> Chest x ray suggested giant bullae. CT of the chest revealed over 40 bullae, the largest being 11 cm in diameter. Osteoporosis with multiple vertebral crush fractures was noted on plain films and bone densitometry (t=− 3. 19). His dental health was poor. Hypertension, complicated by a large occipital stroke was shown by CT of the brain, and increased vascular age (69. 8 years) found by pulse wave analysis. The case is significant as it indicates the potential severity of cannabis lung damage and suggests that significant cannabis exposure may cause osteoporosis and accelerated vascular ageing.

40|$|Therapeutic {{cannabis}} {{administration is}} increasingly used in Western countries {{due to its}} positive role in several pathologies. Dronabinol or tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) pills, ethanolic cannabis tinctures, oromucosal sprays or table vaporizing devices are available but other cannabinoids forms can be used. Inspired by the illegal practice of dabbing of butane <b>hashish</b> <b>oil</b> (BHO), cannabinoids from cannabis were extracted with butane gas, and the resulting concentrate (BHO) was atomized with specific vaporizing devices. The efficiency of "cannavaping," defined as the "vaping" of liquid refills for e-cigarettes enriched with cannabinoids, including BHO, was studied as an alternative route of administration for therapeutic cannabinoids. The results showed that illegal cannavaping would be subjected to marginal development due to the poor solubility of BHO in commercial liquid refills (especially those with high glycerin content). This prevents the manufacture of liquid refills with high BHO concentrations adopted by most recreational users of cannabis to feel the psychoactive effects more rapidly and extensively. Conversely, "therapeutic cannavaping" could be an efficient route for cannabinoids administration because less concentrated cannabinoids-enriched liquid refills are required. However, the electronic device marketed for therapeutic cannavaping should be carefully designed to minimize potential overheating and contaminant generation...|$|E
