[...] "A {{lot of people}} doubted my dad's abilities, and Kevin's had doubters and naysayers," [...] Dodd commented. [...] "But both [...] {{were willing to take}} risks, and both were very resilient. My <b>dad</b> <b>would</b> always try new things. You could never pin him down. Kevin's career is similar." [...] David Evanier, author of Roman Candle: The Life of Bobby Darin (...) , said [...] "You can put Kevin's obsessiveness about getting the film made right up there with Bobby's obsessiveness. He's also the ideal person to play Bobby. He has an uncanny physical resemblance to him, and he also has Bobby's intensity and dark side. Also, there's the connection with his mother. Bobby's mother's belief in him sent him soaring. Kevin's mother wanted him to make this film. Kevin sees the film as an act of devotion to his mother." ...|$|E

500|$|One {{day after}} his father {{died of a heart}} attack or stroke, Favre decided to play in a December 22, 2003, Monday Night Football game against the Oakland Raiders. The Packers {{traveled}} to Oakland where Favre passed for four touchdowns in the first half and 399 total yards in a 41–7 victory over the Raiders on international television (even receiving applause from [...] "Raider Nation"). He completed 73.3% of his passes and finished the game with a passer rating of 154.9 with having recorded a perfect 158.3 rating with four touchdowns and over 250 yards passing by halftime (a feat accomplished by only four other passers in NFL history). Afterwards, Favre said, [...] "I knew that my <b>dad</b> <b>would</b> have wanted me to play. I love him so much and I love this game. It's meant a great deal to me, to my dad, to my family, and I didn't expect this kind of performance. But I know he was watching tonight." [...] After the game, he went to his father's funeral in Pass Christian, Mississippi. Favre won an ESPY Award for his Monday Night Football performance.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to Scuzzlebutt, [...] "Volcano" [...] included the first appearances of recurring characters Randy Marsh and Ned Gerblanski. In this first appearance, Randy is identified {{only as the}} South Park geologist, {{and it is only}} in the episode [...] "An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig" [...] that he is first introduced as Stan's father. Parker, who provides the voice of Randy Marsh, said the design, voice, and personality of the character are based on his real-life father, who works as a geologist for the United States Geological Survey. Parker said his father is very calm in real life and Randy's relaxed reaction to learning of the volcano—calmly sipping his coffee—is [...] "about how my <b>dad</b> <b>would</b> react to anything". The look of the Ned character was based on a drawing Parker made in high school, although the character did not originally have a voice box. The voice was inspired by a waitress who worked at a Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant in Boulder, Colorado, where Parker and Stone would visit while attending the University of Colorado. The duo said they would go to the restaurant just to hear her voice, but that it was so low they would lose their appetite when she took their orders. Stone and Parker had trouble creating the right voice for the character; they tried putting the microphone directly on their throat, and also bought an actual voice box, but ultimately decided that the best way to provide the character's voice was with natural voice simulation.|$|E
2500|$|Premiered in December 1981, {{the film}} was well {{received}} by critics, and after a limited release on December 4, On Golden Pond developed enough of an audience to be widely released on January 22. With 10 Academy Award nominations, the film earned nearly $120 million at the box office, becoming an unexpected blockbuster. In addition to wins for Hepburn (Best Actress), and Thompson (Screenplay), On Golden Pond brought Fonda his only Oscar - for Best Actor (he was the oldest recipient of the award; it also earned him a Golden Globe Best Actor award). [...] Fonda was by that point too ill to attend the ceremony, and his daughter Jane accepted on his behalf. She said when accepting the award that her <b>dad</b> <b>would</b> probably quip, [...] "Well, ain't I lucky."

2500|$|Spielberg {{liked the}} story outline {{presented}} by Lucas and Boam, but wanted a first draft {{before making a}} decision to move forward. He was planning direct the film Rain Man, but an Indiana Jones project would take precedence. Boam signed a contract on April 14, 1987. He wrote his first draft that summer, and turned it in on September 15, with another revision on September 30. It {{was at that time}} that Spielberg made a commitment to direct the Indiana Jones film over Rain Man, based on reading one of Boam's unfinished drafts. Spielberg said, [...] "We licked it with Boam". Spielberg brought actor Sean Connery in to portray Henry Jones, Sr., and Connery provided substantial input into the character, who Lucas originally conceived as an eccentric professor – [...] "an Obi-Wan Kenobi type." [...] Boam wanted to expand the father character, making him more central to the plot. He said that in Meyjes' original script, [...] "the father was sort of a MacGuffin... they didn't find the father until the very end. I said to George, 'It doesn't make sense to find the father at the end. Why don't they find him in the middle?'" [...] He wanted the father-son relationship to be the main point, rather than the Grail. With the input of Spielberg and Connery, Boam altered the senior Jones from [...] "a somewhat crotchety old character" [...] to a man with more [...] "vitality". Connery wanted the father to have a prior sexual relationship to the same female archeologist that Indiana Jones sleeps with. Boam incorporated this into the script, with Indiana's reaction to learning that he and his father slept with the same woman defused through humor. Boam said, [...] "He's a bit humbled and surprised that his <b>dad</b> <b>would</b> be able to attract this young attractive woman... but he isn't appalled by it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1969, Haggard {{released}} [...] "Okie From Muskogee," [...] with lyrics ostensibly {{reflecting the}} singer's {{pride in being}} from Middle America where people are conventionally patriotic, don't smoke marijuana, don't take LSD, don't protest by burning draft cards or otherwise challenge authority. In the ensuing years, Haggard gave varying statements regarding whether he intended the song as a humorous satire or a serious political statement in support of conservative values. In a 2001 interview, Haggard called the song a [...] "documentation of the uneducated that lived in America at the time." [...] However, he made several other statements suggesting that he meant the song seriously. On the Bob Edwards Show, he said, [...] "I wrote it when I recently {{got out of the}} joint. I knew {{what it was like to}} lose my freedom, and I was getting really mad at these protesters. They didn't know anything more about the war in Vietnam than I did. I thought how my dad, who was from Oklahoma, would have felt. I felt I knew how those boys fighting in Vietnam felt." [...] In the country music documentary series Lost Highway, he elaborated: [...] "My dad passed away when I was nine, and I don't know if you've ever thought about somebody you've lost and you say, 'I wonder what so-and-so would think about this?' I was drivin' on Interstate 40 and I saw a sign that said '19 Miles to Muskogee.' Muskogee was always referred to in my childhood as 'back home.' So I saw that sign and my whole childhood flashed before my eyes and I thought, 'I wonder what <b>dad</b> <b>would</b> think about the youthful uprising that was occurring at the time, the Janis Joplins.... I understood 'em, I got along with it, but what if he was to come alive at this moment? And I thought, what a way to describe the kind of people in America that are still sittin' in the center of the country sayin', 'What is goin' on on these campuses?'" [...] In the American Masters documentary about him, he said, [...] "That's how I got into it with the hippies.... I thought they were unqualified to judge America, and I thought they were lookin' down their noses at something that I cherished very much, and it pissed me off. And I thought, 'You sons of bitches, you've never been restricted away from this great, wonderful country, and yet here you are in the streets bitchin' about things, protesting about a war that they didn't know any more about than I did. They weren't over there fightin' that war any more than I was." ...|$|E

Unusually for an independent British movie it ran in major multiplex chains across the country and broke box office records in north England (beaten in takings in some movie houses only by Charlie and the Chocolate Factory for the whole year) but received some snobbish anti-Catholic reviews in the British national press.

40|$|AbstractIn the {{companion}} article, we proposed that fullerene cages with head-to-tail dihedral angle discrepancies do not self-assemble. Here we show why. If an edge abuts a pentagon {{at one end}} and a hexagon at the other, the dihedral angle about the edge increases, producing a dihedral angle discrepancy (DAD) vector. The DADs about all five/six edges of a central pentagonal/hexagonal face are determined by the identities—pentagon or hexagon—of its five/six surrounding faces. Each “Ring”—central face plus specific surrounding faces—may have zero, two, or four edges with DAD. In most Rings, the nonplanarity induced by DADs is shared among surrounding faces. However, in a Ring that has DADs arranged head of one to tail of another, the nonplanarity cannot be shared, so some surrounding faces would be especially nonplanar. Because the head-to-tail exclusion rule is an implicit geometric constraint, the rule may operate either by imposing a kinetic barrier that prevents assembly of certain Rings or by imposing an energy cost that makes those Rings unlikely to last in an equilibrium circumstance. Since Rings with head-to-tail <b>DADs</b> <b>would</b> be unlikely to self-assemble or last, fullerene cages with those Rings would be unlikely to self-assemble...|$|R
