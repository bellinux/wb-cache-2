5|$|The writers {{had wanted}} an episode where Burns becomes {{bankrupt}} and shows what Burns {{would be like}} as {{a person in the}} real world. The idea with the recycling plant was that Burns did not have any sort of evil plan, he <b>just</b> <b>could</b> not help being himself. Burns really was trying to change and this was reflected in the end when he tried to give Lisa her share of the profits, with Lisa refusing. Burns was drawn without his trademark scowl for this episode. The staff joked about this being a suitable series finale, due to the episode ending with Homer suffering from another heart attack after Lisa tells Homer what 10% of Burns' $120,000,000 check really is.|$|E
25|$|On March 9, 1987, LaMarche's {{father was}} murdered, {{shot to death}} by a lifelong friend in a Toronto hotel lobby, in front of dozens of witnesses. This sent LaMarche into {{depression}} and alcoholism for the next two years, effectively stalling his stand-up career. After getting sober on Inauguration Day in 1989, LaMarche embarked again into the world of his first love, standup comedy, {{in the early part of}} 1990. However, just as he was regaining lost momentum, tragedy struck once more, as his 18-year-old sister was killed in a car accident in September of that year. At this point, though he remained sober, LaMarche decided he <b>just</b> <b>could</b> not do standup comedy anymore.|$|E
25|$|Papua New Guinea, who had {{qualified}} for this tournament through the extra {{chance in the}} World Cup Qualifying Series, got their first win in an extremely close-run match with Uganda. After young pace bowler Emmanuel Isaneez had taken four for 48 to reduce Papua New Guinea to 203 all out, Papuan Hitolo Areni responded with four quick wickets, as Uganda crumbled to 16 for 4 – and then 153 for 9. Kenneth Kamyuka then showed the Papuans how to stay on strike, as his batting partner Isaneez faced three deliveries in their partnership of 49. However, Kamyuka <b>just</b> <b>could</b> not hit the runs quickly enough, and Uganda ended on 202 for 9 – thus claiming the wooden spoon.|$|E

25|$|In {{the opening}} {{race of the}} season, it was a solid start for the Williams team to {{celebrate}} its 30 years in Formula One as Nico Rosberg finally took his first podium finish while Nakajima scored his first points in Formula One in just his 2nd race for Williams. However, the remaining races saw the team slipping backwards and often struggling to score points. But the new Singapore Grand Prix saw Rosberg finish in a shock second place in front title contender of Lewis Hamilton. Williams were looking set to clinch their first victory since the 2004 Brazilian Grand Prix but Rosberg <b>just</b> <b>could</b> not overtake another shock podium finisher and winner Fernando Alonso. Thus, a first victory for Rosberg was denied but still it was his best finish in Formula One until the 2012 Chinese Grand Prix where he finished first after starting from pole position. The team eventually finished the season with 26 points, convincingly beaten by the Toyota F1 team.|$|E

A poem said that the kindness of Zhang Fu De moved Mazu whose in turned sent Ba Xian to picked him up to heaven.|$|E
25|$|Regrettably {{there was}} jealousy between Rear Admiral Seivers and Gordon. Seivers {{had been born}} at Copenhagen and served the King of Denmark in his navy about the year 1708. Having been engaged by Peter the Great as captain, he was {{sometimes}} employed on board, sometimes in the yard, as Under-Equipage Master. He was reported {{as a man of}} excellent sense, general knowledge and very exact and methodical in his conduct. He was also able to speak and write most European tongues and was fluent in Russian. But he <b>just</b> <b>could</b> not stand Thomas Gordon. Seivers refused to suffer Rear Admiral Gordon to be present at discussions upon the executions of any orders even when required by the Tsar. He felt that Peter the Great esteemed Gordon before him and indeed the Tsar appointed Gordon to take charge of a fleet over his head on the strength of his having been a British officer and trained in a better navy than Sievers had. Unlike Seivers, Gordon could not speak Russian but was fluent in Dutch.|$|E

25|$|Game Five old Munster rivals meet in Limerick, The Cork Admirals @ U.L Vikings {{is always}} a game Coach O' Sullivan has pencilled in his diary. Despite a dismal season {{last year for the}} Cork team they had bounced back this season rejuvenated, {{recording}} impressive victories, including a 26-0 win over the Rhino's, second seed in the north. The Vikings went to work on Cork scoring 34 points in the first half, a ten-yard rushing touch down by 2008 and 2009 shamrock bowl M.V.P Adrian Garvey and a spectacular 45 yard touch down pass by the Marc Ashworth / Sean Goldrick unit. The Admirals <b>just</b> <b>could</b> not get the ball moving especially not with the intense pressure coming from the Viking front 4, made up of Alan O' Carroll, Glen Carr, Kieran Coen and this year's d-line addition Ian Cahill who has fitted in comfortably with the three league veterans. Other scores included a 6-yard toss form Ashworth to Curtin and on Craig Switzers first ever offensive play he scored a 75-yard touchdown sweep on his rivals. The second half of the game was a struggle for both teams as it was littered with flags due to the Vikings indiscipline and a defensive stand from the Admirals they were able to control the Vikings and keep them scoreless in the second half, making the second half finish the same as the first 34-0, pushing the Vikings 5-0 record.|$|E

500|$|For {{the role}} of Reese, various other {{suggestions}} were made for the role including rock musician Sting. Cameron chose Michael Biehn for the role. Biehn was originally skeptical about the part, feeling that the film was silly. After meeting with Cameron, Biehn stated his [...] "feelings about the project changed".

500|$|Galland's {{position}} as General der Jagdflieger {{brought him into}} gradual conflict with Göring as the war continued. In 1942–44, the German fighter forces on all fronts in the European Theatre of Operations (ETO) came under increasing pressure and Galland's relationship with Göring began to turn sour. The first distinct cracks {{began to appear in}} the spring, 1943. Galland suggested that the fighter forces defending Germany should limit the number of interceptions flown to allow sufficient time for re-grouping and to conserve air strength. Only by conserving its strength and its precious resources—the fighter pilots—could the Luftwaffe hope to inflict damage on the bombers. Göring refused. He demanded every raid be countered in maximum strength regardless {{of the size of the}} Allied fighter escort. According to head of production and procurement Erhard Milch, who was also present at the meeting, [...] "Göring <b>just</b> <b>could</b> not grasp it." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed reviews. Rowan Kaiser, {{writing for}} The A.V.

[...] While wishing that it had come earlier in the season, the reviewer wrote that [...] "its intense style and emotional stakes {{put it on the}} shortlist of best Veronica Mars episodes." [...] Price Peterson of TV.com praised the dream sequences for their beauty, but criticized them for their complexity.

500|$|How to Grow a Woman {{from the}} Ground takes {{influence}} from different genres, “drawing equally from traditional bluegrass, progressive acoustic, and singer/songwriter traditions”, with one critic calling {{the majority of}} the album very “roots oriented”. The album has a bluegrass or progressive bluegrass core; bluegrass mandolinist Ronnie McCoury became the album’s official “bluegrass guru” to ensure that there was “someone who could make sure we didn’t do anything clichéd or trite”. In regard to [...] the album’s style, Thile said that “All in all, How to Grow a Woman from the Ground is a bluegrass record. There are definitely some musical things that are out of the ordinary, but it sounds like a bluegrass record to me. It’s not all like “Brakeman’s Blues,” but “Brakeman’s Blues” doesn’t sound out of place, and neither does “The Beekeeper” sound out of place. It’s all related.” Much of Thile's work on the album was influenced by his divorce, and Thile claims that he could relate to the title of the album, a Tom Brosseau song.
