25|$|Using these variables, {{the optimal}} diet model can predict how predators choose between two prey types: big prey1 with <b>energy</b> <b>value</b> E1 and {{handling}} time h1, and small prey2 with <b>energy</b> <b>value</b> E2 and handling time h2. In order to maximize its overall rate of energy gain, a predator {{must consider the}} profitability of the two prey types. If {{it is assumed that}} big prey1 is more profitable than small prey2, then E1/h1 > E2/h2. Thus, if the predator encounters prey1, it should always choose to eat it, because of its higher profitability. It should never bother to go searching for prey2. However, if the animal encounters prey2, it should reject it to look for a more profitable prey1, unless the time it would take to find prey1 is too long and costly for it to be worth it. Thus, the animal should only eat prey2 if E2/h2 > E1/(h1+S1), where S1 is the search time for prey1. Since it is always favorable to choose to eat prey1, the choice to eat prey1 is not dependent on the abundance of prey2. But since the length of S1 (i.e. {{how difficult it is to}} find prey1) is logically dependent on the density of prey1, the choice to eat prey2 is dependent on the abundance of prey1.|$|E
40|$|The {{dramatic}} increase in bio-ethanol production in Canada has resulted in millions of tones {{of different types of}} new co-products: wheat dried distillers grains with solubles (DDGS), corn DDGS and blended DDGS (e. g. wheat:corn = 70 : 30). In the determination of <b>energy</b> <b>values,</b> NRC- 2001 described a chemical approach in which the equations for truly digestible nutrients are developed based on the chemical composition of native feeds. It is questionable whether this chemical approach described by NRC 2001 accurately estimates the <b>energy</b> <b>values</b> of these co-products (DDGS) for dairy cows from bio-ethanol production for dairy cows. The objectives of this study were: (1) to determine the effect of DDGS type and bio-ethanol plant on <b>energy</b> <b>values</b> (DE(3 x,) ME(3 x) NE(L 3 x,) NE(m,) NE(g)) using a biological approach (in situ assay), and (2) to investigate the relationship between the NRC chemical summary approach and the biological approach on prediction of <b>energy</b> <b>values.</b> The results showed significant effects of DDGS type on TDN(1 x) and <b>energy</b> <b>values</b> (DE(3 x,) ME(3 x,) NE(L 3 x,) NE(m,) NE(g)) with the highest in corn DDGS and the lowest in wheat DDGS. (2) The differences between the NRC chemical approach and the biological approach were significant for the predicted truly digestible nutrients (tdNDF, tdCP, tdFA and tdNFC).

2500|$|The terms zero-point {{radiation}} {{or ground}} state energy are also sometimes used interchangeably.

A vacuum can be viewed not as empty space but as the combination of all zero-point fields. In quantum field theory this combination of fields is called the vacuum state, its associated zero-point energy is called the vacuum energy and the average <b>energy</b> <b>value</b> [...] is called the vacuum expectation value (VEV) also called its condensate.|$|E
2500|$|The {{idea that}} [...] "empty" [...] space {{can have an}} {{intrinsic}} energy associated to it, {{and that there is}} no such thing as a [...] "true vacuum" [...] is seemingly unintuitive. It is often argued that the entire universe is completely bathed in the zero-point radiation, and as such it can add only some constant amount to calculations. Physical measurements will therefore reveal only deviations from this value. For many practical calculations zero-point energy is dismissed by fiat in the mathematical model as a term that has no physical effect. Such treatment causes problems however, as in Einstein's theory of general relativity the absolute <b>energy</b> <b>value</b> of space is not an arbitrary constant and gives rise to the cosmological constant. For decades most physicists assumed that there was some undiscovered fundamental principle that will remove the infinite zero-point energy and make it completely vanish. If the vacuum has no intrinsic, absolute value of energy it will not gravitate. It was believed that as the universe expands from the aftermath of the big bang, the energy contained in any unit of empty space will decrease as the total energy spreads out to fill the volume of the universe; galaxies and all matter in the universe should begin to decelerate. This possibility was ruled out in 1998 by the discovery that the expansion of the universe is not slowing down but is in fact accelerating, meaning empty space does indeed have some intrinsic energy. The discovery of dark energy is best explained by zero-point energy, though it still remains a mystery as to why the value appears to be so small compared to huge value obtained through theory - the cosmological constant problem.|$|E
