5000|$|In 1974 {{the band}} issued its last single, [...] "Flash" [...] / [...] "Back Seat Drivin'" [...] on the {{independent}} Earth label. For single the group were Butler, Ferguson, McInerney and Wharton. After its release they worked regularly around Sydney and rural New South Wales. Later in 1974, McInerney left to join Richard Clapton's backing band, he {{was replaced by}} Rob Harris who stayed {{for a few months}} to be replaced by Rob Cody. In August 1975 Ferguson, Wharton and Cody all left to <b>form</b> <b>Flash</b> Harry's Iceberg. The latter day line-up of The 69'ers was Butler, Ian Cameron on guitar, Tom Callaghan on drums and Lindsay Osborne on bass guitar. The group finally broke up in February 1976.|$|E
50|$|In 2004, the American {{businessman}} Malcolm Glazer made {{an attempt}} to buy the club, but was rebuffed by the PLC board {{because of the large}} amount of borrowing his bid would rely on. They felt that he would mortgage the club's future to pay for his bid. Shareholders United, together with the Independent Manchester United Supporters Association, organised demonstrations before matches, first before an important league match against Arsenal in {{an attempt to}} show the board that supporters were against the takeover, and later before a Champions League match against Milan, when thousands of supporters marched to demonstrate to Glazer that they would not welcome him if he bought the club. They also encouraged members to <b>form</b> <b>flash</b> mobs, where large groups congregated at shops owned by the club's sponsors to temporarily prevent the shops from trading. The purpose of this was an attempt to warn the sponsors that supporters would boycott their products if they continued their links with the club after a takeover.|$|E
40|$|Present {{investigation}} {{deals with}} the steam system used to provide process heat in pulp industries. Steam loss in the process, {{is a major problem}} faced by the industries. A well designed steam distribution system can reduce the losses and improve the efficiency of the steam system, thus reducing energy cost. Energy {{is one of the main}} factor which accounts for the cost in the pulp industry. Especially in times of high energy price volatility, improving energy-efficiency should be a primary concern for pulp industry. This paper provides information on the effective steam consumption and recovery technologies in the pulp industry. In order to provide guidelines for energy conservation, analysis is carried out on the Briquette-fired industry boiler and steam system. The huge amount of heat in <b>form</b> <b>flash</b> steam has been wasted, due to thermodynamics constrains. The flash steam generated contains up to half of the total energy of the condensate. After analysis the scheme is adopted as flash evaporation and chemistry disposal technology to recover the condensate water and used as a feed water for the boiler. The results indicate that there is increase in boiler efficiency from 63 % to 78 %. Fuel consumption reduction is observe...|$|E

The mustang {{turned in}} the gate, slid to a stop, and stood quivering, restive, tossing its {{thoroughbred}} head, black as a coal, with freedom and fire in every line. Mescal leaped off lightly. A gray <b>form</b> <b>flashed</b> in at the gate, fell at her feet and rose to leap about her. It was a splendid dog, huge in frame, almost white, wild as the mustang.|$|R
2500|$|One {{variation}} of impression-die forging is called [...] "flashless forging", or [...] "true closed-die forging". In {{this type of}} forging, the die cavities are completely closed, which keeps the workpiece from <b>forming</b> <b>flash.</b> The major advantage to this process is that less metal is lost to flash. Flash can account for 20 to 45% of the starting material. The disadvantages of this process include additional cost due to a more complex die design {{and the need for}} better lubrication and workpiece placement.|$|R

50|$|In the United States, early <b>forms</b> of <b>flash</b> fiction can {{be found}} in the 19th century, notably in the figures of Walt Whitman, Ambrose Bierce, and Kate Chopin.|$|R
50|$|The {{workpiece}} {{is placed}} into the forge. Then {{the impact of}} a hammer causes the heated material, which is very malleable, to conform to the shape of the die and die cavities. Typically only one die is needed to completely form the part. Extra space between the die faces causes some of the material to be pressed out of the sides, <b>forming</b> <b>flash.</b> This acts as a relief valve for the extreme pressure produced by the closing of the die halves and is later trimmed off of the finished part.|$|R

They disbanded by 1973 with Dowding and Eastick <b>forming</b> <b>Flash</b> in 1974 with Mick Pealing on vocals. In May 1975, Dowding, Eastick and Pealing formed Stars with Graham Thompson on bass. As a country, rock band they were touted as Australian rock'n'roll cowboys {{and played the}} local pub and club circuit. They were noticed by pop group, Little River Band's guitarist Beeb Birtles, they signed to Mushroom Records and relocated to Melbourne. Birtles produced their debut single, [...] "Quick on the Draw" [...] which reached the Australian Kent Music Report top 30 in July 1976. Durant joined in August on guitar and became their principal songwriter.|$|R

5000|$|In 1971 Banks, singer Colin Carter, bassist Ray Bennett {{and drummer}} Mike Hough <b>formed</b> <b>Flash</b> and {{sessions}} began {{for a first}} album for Sovereign/Capitol Records, with Tony Kaye guesting on keyboards. The record appeared in 1972 (called simply Flash) and had a warm reception, with the single, [...] "Small Beginnings" [...] rising to #28 on the Billboard Charts. Subsequent to Kaye's involvement, Flash continued without a keyboardist. Flash recorded and released its second album (In the Can) in November that same year, with the singles [...] "Lifetime" [...] and [...] "Children of the Universe" [...] (from the first album) receiving significant airplay. A third album,Out of Our Hands was released in 1973. Due to on-going personal tensions within the band, including Banks meeting a new girlfriend, singer Sidonie Jordon, and wanting to form a band with her, Flash broke up while on tour in America in 1973.|$|R

40|$|The {{feasibility}} of thermosonic gold wire bonding on Cu coupons with Sn/Cu metallizations was studied by evaluating shear strength and microstructure of balls bonded on different Sn metallization samples. The 0. 85 ± 0. 08 lm and 5. 34 ± 0. 21 lm thick metallizations were produced by dipping the Cu coupon in 250 C molten Sn solder for 1 s (sample 1) and 30 s (sample 2), respectively. Cu 6 Sn 5 intermetallic compounds are formed during dipping. After wire bonding, Au-Cu-Sn layers are {{found on the}} ball-coupon interface of both samples. The highest ball shear force observed was 40 gf (1 gf = 9. 81 mN) and was achieved on sample 1 using 520 mW and 40 gf of ultrasonic power and bonding force, respectively. The shear fracture goes through the Au ball. The Sn is squeezed out of the contact zone during wire bonding and <b>forms</b> <b>flashes</b> that extend 5 lm and 25 lm beyond the contact zone for samples 1 and 2, respectively...|$|R
