5|$|Making {{contemporary}} political points {{in this way}} through reinterpretation of distant historical episodes was now common. In 17th century France, {{the fall of the}} powerful Cardinal Mazarin was celebrated in a political pamphlet that also drew parallels with the career of Sejanus, L'Ambitieux ou le portraict d'Aelius Sejanus en la personne du Cardinal Mazarin (Paris, 1642). In England other royal favourites were seen <b>in</b> <b>these</b> <b>terms</b> too. George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, is the target of an anonymous manuscript Roman tragedy, The Emperor’s Favourite. The prudent need for anonymity, is suggested by the arrest of Sir John Eliot, who was sent to the Tower of London for his outspoken criticism of the Duke in the 1626 parliament, comparing him to Sejanus.|$|E
5|$|The {{defeated}} Scots {{appealed to}} Pope Boniface VIII to assert {{a claim of}} overlordship to Scotland in place of the English. His papal bull addressed to King Edward <b>in</b> <b>these</b> <b>terms</b> was firmly rejected on Edward's behalf by the Barons' Letter of 1301. The English managed to subdue the country by other means, however. In 1303, a peace agreement was reached between England and France, effectively breaking up the Franco-Scottish alliance. Robert the Bruce, the grandson of the claimant to the crown in 1291, had sided with the English in the winter of 1301–02. By 1304, most of the other nobles of the country had also pledged their allegiance to Edward, and this year the English also managed to re-take Stirling Castle. A great propaganda victory was achieved in 1305 when Wallace was betrayed by Sir John de Menteith and turned over to the English, who had him taken to London where he was publicly executed. With Scotland largely under English control, Edwardinstalled Englishmen and collaborating Scots to govern the country.|$|E

25|$|Following {{the sudden}} {{death of her}} only sister Emilia from typhoid, Spielrein's mental health started to deteriorate, and at the age of 18 she {{suffered}} a breakdown with severe hysteria including tics, grimaces, and uncontrollable laughing and crying. After an unsuccessful stay in a Swiss sanatorium, where she developed another infatuation with one of the doctors, she was admitted to the Burghölzli mental hospital near Zurich in August 1904. Its director was Eugen Bleuler, who ran it as a therapeutic community with social activities for the patients including gardening, drama and scientific lectures. One of Bleuler's assistants was Carl Jung, afterwards appointed as deputy director. In the days following her admission, Spielrein disclosed to Jung that her father had often beaten her, and that she was troubled by masochistic fantasies of being beaten. Bleuler ensured that she was separated from her family, later requiring her father and brothers to have no contact with her. She made a rapid recovery, and by October was able to apply for medical school and to start assisting Jung with word association tests in his laboratory. Between October and January, Jung carried out word association tests on her, and also used some rudimentary psychoanalytic techniques. Later, he referred to her twice in letters to Freud as his first analytic case, although in his publications he referred to two later patients <b>in</b> <b>these</b> <b>terms.</b> During her admission, Spielrein fell in love with Jung. By her own choice, she continued as a resident in the hospital from January to June 1905, although she was no longer receiving treatment. She worked as an intern alongside other Russian students there including Max Eitingon, as well as expatriate psychiatrists who were studying with Bleuler, including Karl Abraham.|$|E

Once we begin to see est <b>in</b> <b>these</b> <b>terms,</b> much that fails to fit the scheme of therapy or religion or science begins to make sense." ...|$|E

Although these equations bear some resemblance in form to the centrifugal and Coriolis effects found in rotating reference frames, nonetheless these are not the same things. For example, the physical centrifugal and Coriolis forces appear only in non-inertial frames of reference. <b>In</b> contrast, <b>these</b> <b>terms,</b> that appear when acceleration is expressed in polar coordinates, are a mathematical consequence of differentiation; <b>these</b> <b>terms</b> appear wherever polar coordinates are used. <b>In</b> particular, <b>these</b> <b>terms</b> appear even when polar coordinates are used in inertial frames of reference, where the physical centrifugal and Coriolis forces never appear.|$|R

Drawing a parallel to the [...] "controlled folly" [...] described in Castaneda's A Separate Reality, Rhinehart argues that in almost all cases, enlightenment is linked to humor: [...] "One can rarely have an enlightenment experience except under the impact of nonsense ... Every time we laugh {{we are in a}} way experiencing a mini enlightenment, a tiny letting go of some attachment to some bit of belief or sense. Full enlightenment, <b>in</b> <b>these</b> <b>terms,</b> is accepting what is, which leads to experiencing fully whatever one is experiencing." ...|$|E

The Roller as berlin-blue, brownish-yellow, coppery-purple and light cinnamon. The Spotted Eagle as chocolate-brown, pale wood-brown and reddish liver-brown. The Golden Oriole had lead-colour toes, other parts oil-green, brocoli-brown and wine-yellow. The Cuneate-Tailed Gull was smoke-brown and pearl-grey, the Turnstone had ferruginus portions, the Little Auk was livid-brown and sooty-brown, while the American Bittern was leaden-brown.

[...] The [...] maximum possible duration of a total solar eclipse is seven minutes and 31.1 seconds. The only total eclipse visible in Jerusalem in this era fell later in the year, on 24 November 29 CE at 11:05 AM.

500|$|Of Locke's major {{claims in}} the Essay Concerning Human Understanding and Some Thoughts Concerning Education, two played a {{defining}} role in eighteenth-century educational theory. The first is that education makes the man; as Locke writes {{at the opening of}} his treatise, [...] "I think I may say that of all the men we meet with, nine parts of ten are what they are, good or evil, useful or not, by their education." [...] In making this claim, Locke was arguing against both the Augustinian view of man, which grounds its conception of humanity in original sin, and the Cartesian position, which holds that man innately knows basic logical propositions. In his Essay Locke posits an [...] "empty" [...] mind—a tabula rasa—that is [...] "filled" [...] by experience. In describing the mind <b>in</b> <b>these</b> <b>terms,</b> Locke was drawing on Plato's Theatetus, which suggests that the mind is like a [...] "wax tablet". Although Locke argued strenuously for the tabula rasa theory of mind, he nevertheless did believe in innate talents and interests. For example, he advises parents to watch their children carefully to discover their [...] "aptitudes," [...] and to nurture their children's own interests rather than force them to participate in activities which they dislike—"he, therefore, that is about children should well study their natures and aptitudes and see, by often trials, what turn they easily take and what becomes them, observe what their native stock is, how it may be improved, and what it is fit for." ...|$|E
