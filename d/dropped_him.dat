5|$|The {{next year}} Andretti raced once for the Williams team, after their driver Carlos Reutemann {{suddenly}} quit, before replacing the seriously injured Didier Pironi at Ferrari {{for the last}} two races of the year.

5|$|Carlsen {{was close}} to winning the 2006 Norwegian Chess Championship outright, but a last-round loss to Berge Østenstad <b>dropped</b> <b>him</b> into another tie for first place with Agdestein. It also {{prevented}} Carlsen from beating Agdestein's record as the youngest Norwegian champion ever. Nonetheless, in the playoff held from 19–21 September, Carlsen won 3–1. After two draws at standard time controls, Carlsen won both rapid games in round two, securing his first Norwegian championship win.|$|E

5|$|McGee's first post-TUF {{fight was}} against UFC veteran, Ryan Jensen at UFC 121. Early {{in the first}} round, McGee {{was hit with a}} stiff shot that <b>dropped</b> <b>him</b> and later {{suffered}} a minor cut below his eye.

5|$|With 100 {{points from}} the first four races, Nico Rosberg {{remained}} {{on top of the}} Drivers' Championship, while Hamilton's retirement <b>dropped</b> <b>him</b> behind Räikkönen, who now trailed Rosberg by 39 points, four points ahead of Hamilton.

5|$|Hamilton {{started from}} pole position, but was {{overtaken}} by Rosberg {{at the first}} corner. Rosberg held the lead {{for the remainder of}} the race, barring brief periods during pit stops, and won by over three seconds. Hamilton remained ahead of Williams driver Felipe Massa to claim the runner-up position. Ferrari driver Sebastian Vettel had been holding third position for much of the first half of the race, but a delay due to a stuck wheel nut during his pit stop <b>dropped</b> <b>him</b> into fourth place. Former World Champions Kimi Räikkönen and Fernando Alonso were eliminated on the first lap, after Räikkönen lost control of his Ferrari at the second turn and collided with Alonso.

5|$|Media {{attention}} was also {{directed at the}} teams' offensive capabilities. Boston College quarterback Matt Ryan was named the Atlantic Coast Conference Player of the Year in the week {{leading up to the}} game. In {{the first half of the}} 2007 season, Ryan had been prominently mentioned in candidate lists for the Heisman Trophy, college football's highest individual award. Although Ryan's late-game comeback in their previous game against Virginia Tech had made him a front-runner, the team's two subsequent losses to unranked teams <b>dropped</b> <b>him</b> from contention for the Heisman. Excellent performances in a division-clinching win at Clemson and against Miami seemed to return Ryan to Heisman-candidate form, however, and heading into the ACC Championship Game, Ryan appeared to be the biggest offensive threat for Boston College.|$|E
5|$|Morris {{was given}} another life on 136, when Laker <b>dropped</b> <b>him</b> at square leg from the bowling of Compton. Bradman was given another life at 108; he {{advanced}} two metres down the pitch towards Laker and missed, but Evans fumbled the stumping opportunity. Australia reached tea at 1/292 with Morris on 150. The pair had added 171 during the session. Morris was eventually dismissed by Yardley for 182, after hitting a tired-looking shot to mid-off, having partnered Bradman for {{a stand of}} 301 in 217 minutes. He struck 33 fours in 290 minutes of batting. Australia still needed 46 for victory, {{and went on to}} win by seven wickets with 15 minutes to spare, setting a new world record for the highest successful Test run-chase.|$|E
5|$|Thanatos– The former God of Death, {{father of}} Erinys, and main {{antagonist}} of Ghost of Sparta. Ruler of the Domain of Death, Thanatos {{is responsible for}} imprisoning and torturing Kratos' brother Deimos. While Kratos and Deimos were battling, Thanatos snatched Deimos from the battle and <b>dropped</b> <b>him</b> {{on the edge of}} a cliff. Deimos was saved by Kratos, who united with his brother to fight the God of Death, who transformed into a winged beast. Thanatos mocked Kratos for Ares' mistaken decision and eventually killed Deimos, but was killed in turn by an angered Kratos. The character was voiced by Arthur Burghardt in Ghost of Sparta.|$|E

5|$|The Australian onslaught {{against the}} spinners {{prompted}} Yardley {{to take the}} new ball and replace Compton with his fast men. Bradman reached 50 in 60 minutes and Yardley <b>dropped</b> <b>him</b> soon after. Australia reached 202—halfway to the required total—with 165 minutes remaining, after Morris dispatched consecutive full tosses from Laker to the fence. Bradman then hooked two boundaries, but suffered a fibrositis attack, which put him in significant pain. Drinks were taken during a delay for treatment, and Morris had to shield Bradman from the strike until the skipper’s pain had subsided. Australia reached 250 shortly before tea, with Morris on 133 and Bradman on 92. Bradman then reached his century as the second-wicket stand passed 200.|$|E
5|$|The Red Bull of Mark Webber was {{the first}} to pit, on lap12. Webber had passed Barrichello and Piquet in {{separate}} manoeuvres to take ninth, but his pit stop <b>dropped</b> <b>him</b> back down to 18th position. Massa and Alonso came in to pit on lap14, from third and fourth. Kovalainen took the lead of the Grand Prix when Hamilton and Räikkönen paused their battle to take harder tyres and fuel on lap15. By the time Kovalainen and Heidfeld had pitted on laps17 and 18, Hamilton had established a commanding lead: 6.9seconds over Räikkönen and 14.1seconds over Massa. Räikkönen began to pull back Hamilton's lead over the next ten laps, before losing 1.4seconds on lap30.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton began lapping fastest, {{recording}} a 1:32.869 on lap38, {{more than a}} second faster than first-placed Vettel. Lap45 saw three drivers set consecutive new fastest laps; Kubica's 1:32.366 was beaten by Webber with a 1:32.014s. They were then superseded by Räikkönen, who set a 1:31.691. On lap49 Webber attempted to pass Hamilton at the first chicane, but the two cars touched wheels. Webber was forced down the escape road, and when he emerged in front of Hamilton, he returned the position. Räikkönen continued {{to move through the}} field; he passed Coulthard and Piquet in separate manoeuvres to take ninthposition. Nakajima attempted to pass Coulthard into turnnine, but succeeded only in turning into the Red Bull RB4, sending it into the gravel trap. Coulthard pitted for a new front wing, which <b>dropped</b> <b>him</b> to 17th. Vettel crossed the finish line on lap53 by 12.5seconds over Kovalainen, becoming the youngest driver in Formula One history to win a Grand Prix. The one-stop strategies used by Kubica and Alonso paid off as they finished in third and fourth, respectively. Heidfeld, Massa, Hamilton and Webber rounded out the top eight. Räikkönen finished in ninthposition, setting the fastest laptime of 1:28.047 on the final lap.|$|E
50|$|Siver {{defeated}} Andre Winner via {{first round}} arm-trap rear-naked choke after <b>dropping</b> <b>him</b> with a counter punch at UFC 122, earning Submission of the Night honors.|$|R
60|$|It {{was quite}} true that Mr. Arthur Rangely had asked Victoria to <b>drop</b> <b>him</b> at the Inn. But {{when they reached}} it he made another request.|$|R
