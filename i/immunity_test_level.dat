40|$|Abstract—Nowadays new {{safety related}} systems design {{includes}} electromagnetic analysis (EMA) during their development. Each {{of these systems}} is composed by smaller apparatuses that contain electronic components able to emit electromagnetic (EM) waves. On the other hand, the usage of smaller integrated circuit increases their susceptibility to EM interference. Companies often underestimate the importance of emissions lower than standard limits. A method based on near-field (NF) to far-field (FF) transformation is introduced in order to evaluate radiated emission leakage. This study is an important novelty to analyze electromagnetic issues {{in the case of}} safety related systems. Moreover, authors present how this method is positioned to current standards. Effectively, NF-FF is proposed for site survey analysis on assembled systems where EM leakages should be mitigated to avoid EM attacks. Tools and measurements presented here can be used to sketch the virtual EM (VEM) interface of device-under-test (DUT) in terms of emissions amplitude, frequency and direction. An opponent could use this information to jam these systems utilizing an attack model based on a circular antenna presented here. The results indicate that it is feasible to use this methodology to analyze EM radiated emissions starting from NF information. Compared with current <b>immunity</b> <b>test</b> <b>levels,</b> the EM attack planned on VEM interface characteristics can be deemed efficiently against safety related systems. 1...|$|R

40|$|Direct power {{injection}} (DPI) and {{bulk current injection}} (BCI) methods are defined in IEC 62132 - 3 and IEC 62132 - 4 as the electromagnetic <b>immunity</b> <b>test</b> method of integrated circuits (IC). The forward power measured at the RF noise generator when the IC malfunctions is used as the measure of immunity level of the IC.

In this paper, the power transfer efficiencies of DPI and BCI methods are derived and validated experimentally with <b>immunity</b> <b>test</b> setup of a clock divider IC.

This thesis provides information on the equivalence between in-house and conventional <b>immunity</b> <b>test</b> techniques. Three techniques were evaluated, namely: 1. E-field radiation with a log periodic antenna (conventional test technique); 2 E-field radiation with an inhouse designed and constructed modified TEM cell (in-house test technique); 3. Current injection using a complete off the shelf EMCO current probe device (in-house test technique). After the transfer data of the EMCO probe was verified, the modified TEM cell design, construction and equivalent measurement tests were performed. These tests revealed that within the respective bandwidth of interest, the devices produced results that are equivalent to each other within 0. 9 dB. Hence equivalence between in-house and conventional test techniques is possible...|$|R

40|$|Smart Grid {{components}} {{often are}} subject to considerable conducted current disturbances in the frequency range 2 – 150 kHz and, as a consequence, {{it is necessary to}} provide reliable <b>immunity</b> <b>test</b> methods. The relevant basic standard IEC 61000 - 4 - 19 that is currently under discussion focusses on frequency domain test methods. It is remarked in this contribution that in the context of frequency domain testing the chosen frequency spacing is related to the resonance response of the system under test which, in turn, is characterized in terms of resonance frequencies and quality factors. These notions apply well to physical system but it is pointed out by the example of an actual smart meter <b>immunity</b> <b>test</b> that smart grid components may exhibit susceptibilities that do not necessarily follow a resonance pattern and, additionally, can be narrowband. As a consequence it is suggested to supplement the present frequency domain test methods by time domain tests which utilize damped sinusoidal excitations with corresponding spectra that properly cover the frequency range 2 – 150 kHz, as exemplified by the military standard MIL-STD- 461...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a {{bulk current}} {{injection}} (BCI) <b>immunity</b> <b>test</b> is designed that conforms to the effects induced in the equipment under test (EUT) by a radiated electromagnetic disturbance (EMD). This is done by adopting a statistical description of the EMD and by comparing currents induced by BCI and distributed field-coupling (i. e., radiation) in the input pins of the EUT. Closed-form results are obtained that enforce equivalence of the aforementioned test procedures in terms of specific statistical estimates (e. g., expected value and dispersion) {{as well as for}} worst-case radiation-induced effects. A distributed-parameter circuit model of the system under test is adopted, composed by the EUT, auxiliary equipment (AE), and a wiring harness. In the analysis, the EMD is described via plane waves with random parameters and a uniform multiconductor transmission line model is used for the wiring harness. The EUT and AE are represented via lumped impedance matrices. Injection-probe feeding-conditions assuring equivalence are derived analytically, and involve a frequency piecewise-linear profile of the RF voltage source.
