50|$|In caricatures and cartoons, Jews {{are usually}} {{depicted}} as having large <b>hook-noses,</b> dark beady eyes with drooping eyelids. Exaggerated or grotesque Jewish facial features were a staple theme in Nazi propaganda and, less frequently, in Soviet propaganda. The Starwars character Watto has been likened to traditional antisemitic caricatures.|$|R
2500|$|Christie {{occasionally}} inserted stereotyped {{descriptions of}} characters into her work, particularly {{before the end}} of the Second World War (when such attitudes were more commonly expressed publicly), and particularly in regard to Italians, Jews, non-Europeans, and sometimes Americans, the last usually as impossibly naïve or uninformed. For example, she described [...] "Hebraic men with <b>hook-noses</b> wearing rather flamboyant jewellery" [...] in the first editions of the collection The Mysterious Mr Quin (1930), in the short story [...] "The Soul of the Croupier"; in later editions, the passage was edited to describe [...] "sallow men" [...] wearing same.|$|R
60|$|October 21.--Walked in {{the morning}} with Sir William Knighton, and had much {{confidential}} chat, not fit to be here set down, in case of accidents. He undertook most kindly to recommend Charles, when he has taken his degree, to be attached to some of the diplomatic missions, which I think is best for the lad after all. After breakfast went to Windsor Castle, met by appointment my daughters and Lockhart, and examined the improvements going on there under Mr. Wyattville, who appears to possess a great deal of taste and feeling for Gothic architecture. The old apartments, splendid enough in extent and proportion, are paltry in finishing. Instead of being lined with heart of oak, the palace of the British King is hung with paper, painted wainscot colour. There are some fine paintings and some droll ones; among the last are those of divers princes of the House of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, of which Queen Charlotte was descended. They are ill-coloured, orang-outang-looking figures, with black eyes and <b>hook-noses,</b> in old-fashioned uniforms.|$|R
60|$|The {{tell-tale}} blood {{sprang to}} the youth's brow {{as he read}} and perceived {{the meaning of the}} man's remarks. At this Redhair and <b>Hook-nose</b> nodded to each other significantly.|$|E
60|$|The {{place was}} very full of people--so full that there seemed {{scarcely}} room for another guest; but by some almost imperceptible motion the red-haired man {{made a little}} space close to himself. The man next to him, with a <b>hook-nose,</b> widened the space by similar action, and Miles, perceiving that there was room, sat down.|$|E

The Swan of Padua [Algarotti, with his big <b>hook-nose</b> and dusky solemnly greedy countenance] is going, I think, to Paris, to profit by my absence; the Philosopher Geometer [big Maupertuis, in red wig and yellow frizzles, vainest of human kind] is squaring curves; poor little Jordan [with the kindly hazel eyes, and pen that pleasantly gossips to us] is doing nothing, or probably something near it. Adieu once more, dear Voltaire; do not forget the absent who love you. FREDERIC." [...] [OEuvres de Frederic, xxii. 57.] ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Little {{men have}} a decided {{inclination}} for big women, and [...] vice versâ; and indeed in a little man the preference for [...] big women will be so much the more passionate if he himself [...] was begotten by a big father, and only remains little through [...] the influence of his mother; because he has inherited from his [...] father the vascular system and its energy which was able to [...] supply a large body with blood. If, on the other hand, his [...] father and grandfather were both little, that inclination will [...] make itself less felt. At {{the foundation of the}} aversion of a [...] big woman to big men lies the intention of Nature to avoid [...] too big a race.... Further, the consideration as to the [...] complexion is very decided. Blondes prefer dark persons or [...] brunettes; but the latter seldom prefer the former. The [...] reason is, that fair hair and blue eyes are in themselves a [...] variation from the type, almost an abnormity, analogous to [...] white mice, or at least to grey horses. In no part of the [...] world, not even {{in the vicinity of the}} Pole, are they [...] indigenous, except in Europe, and are clearly of Scandinavian [...] origin. I may here express my opinion in passing that the [...] white colour of the skin is not natural to man, but that by [...] nature he has a black or brown skin, like our forefathers the [...] Hindus; that consequently a white man has never originally [...] sprung from the womb of Nature, and that thus there is no such [...] thing as a white race, much as this is talked of, but every [...] white man is a faded or bleached one. Forced into this strange [...] world, where he only exists like an exotic plant, and like [...] this requires in winter the hothouse, in the course of [...] thousands of years man became white. The gipsies, an Indian [...] race which immigrated only about four centuries ago, show the [...] transition from the complexion of the Hindu to our own. [...] Therefore in sexual love Nature strives to return to dark [...] hair and brown eyes as the primitive type; but the white [...] colour of the skin has become second nature, though not so [...] that the brown of the Hindu repels us. Finally, each one also [...] seeks in the particular parts of the body the corrective of [...] his own defects and aberrations, and does so the more [...] decidedly the more important the part is. Therefore [...] snub-nosed individuals have an inexpressible liking for [...] <b>hook-noses,</b> parrot-faces; and it is the same with regard to [...] all other parts. Men with excessively slim, long bodies and [...] limbs can find beauty in a body which is even beyond measure [...] stumpy and short.... Whoever is himself in some respects very [...] perfect does not indeed seek and love imperfection in this [...] respect, but is yet more easily reconciled to it than others; [...] because he himself insures the children against great [...] imperfection of this part. For example, whoever is himself [...] very white will not object to a yellow complexion; but whoever [...] has the latter will find dazzling whiteness divinely [...] beautiful.' (You will note that he perceives he has [...] practically contradicted this a few lines before, and that [...] evidently he has gone back and stuck in that saving clause [...] about a white skin being second nature.) 'The rare case in [...] which a man falls in love with a decidedly ugly woman occurs [...] when, beside the exact harmony of the degree of sex explained [...] above, the whole of her abnormities are precisely the [...] opposite, and thus the corrective, of his. The love is then [...] wont to reach a high degree....' ...|$|R
6000|$|The full {{significance}} {{of his position}} suddenly burst upon him. The thought of being led home a prisoner, or conveyed to the police-station handcuffed, maddened him; {{and the idea of}} being thus unjustly checked at the very outset of his independent career made him furious. For a few moments he stood so perfectly still and quiet that the detectives were thrown slightly off their guard. Then there was an explosion of some sort within the breast of Miles Milton. It expended itself in a sudden impulse, which sent Redhead flat on the table among the crockery, and drove <b>Hook-nose</b> into the fireplace among the fire-irons. A fat little man chanced to be standing in the door-way. The same impulse, modified, shot that little man into the street like a cork out of a bottle, and next moment Miles was flying along the pavement at racing speed, horrified at what he had done, but utterly reckless as to what might follow! ...|$|E
6000|$|... [Note.--I {{really must}} break in here. Her aunt's [...] "grand manner" [...] makes me sick. It is nothing (between ourselves) but a <b>hook-nose</b> and a stiff pair of stays. What daunted Nugent Dubourg, {{when he first}} {{found himself in the}} old lady's presence, was the fear of discovery. He would no doubt have learnt from his brother that Oscar and Miss Batchford had never met. You will see, if you look back, that it was, in the nature of things, {{impossible}} they should have met. But is it equally clear that Nugent could find out beforehand that Miss Batchford had been left in ignorance of what had happened at Dimchurch? He could do nothing of the sort--he could feel no assurance of his security from exposure, until he had tried the ground in his own proper person first. The risk here was certainly serious enough to make even Nugent Dubourg feel uneasy. And Lucilla talks of her aunt's [...] "grand manner!" [...] Poor innocent! I leave her to go on.--P.] ...|$|E
60|$|With {{momentary}} suspicion {{he examined}} his weapons, and the packet {{which he had}} received from the Countess, and kept in a secret pocket of his upper coat, bound close about his person. All was safe; and the very operation {{reminded him of the}} duties which lay before him. He left the apartment where they had supped, and went into another, wretched enough, where, in a truckle-bed, were stretched two bodies, covered with a rug, the heads belonging to which were amicably deposited upon the same truss of hay. The one was the black shock-head of the groom; the other, graced with a long thrum nightcap, showed a grizzled pate, and a grave caricatured countenance, which the <b>hook-nose</b> and lantern-jaws proclaimed to belong to the Gallic minister of good cheer, whose praises he had heard sung forth on the preceding evening. These worthies seemed to have slumbered in the arms of Bacchus as well as of Morpheus, for there were broken flasks on the floor; and their deep snoring alone showed that they were alive.|$|E
60|$|So on one Monday {{morning he}} sallied {{out to the}} Paragon about two o'clock. At that hour he knew Miss Todd would be surely at home; for at half-past one she ate her lunch. In the {{regularity}} of her eatings and her drinkings, Miss Todd might have been taken as an example by all the ladies of Littlebath. Sir Lionel's personal appearance has been already described. Considering his age, he was very well preserved. He was still straight; did not fumble much in his walk; and had that decent look of military decorum which, {{since the days of}} Cæsar and the duke, has been always held to accompany a <b>hook-nose.</b> He had considered much about his toilet; indeed, he did that habitually; but on this occasion he had {{come to the conclusion that}} he had better make no unusual sacrifice to the Graces. A touch of the curling-iron to his whiskers, or a surtout that should be absolutely fresh from the tailor's hands, might have an effect with Miss Baker; but if any impression was to be made on Miss Todd, it would not be done by curled whiskers or a new coat. She must be won, if won at all, by the unsophisticated man.|$|E
6000|$|Clement August, {{expensive}} Kurfurst of Koln (Elector of Cologne, {{as we call}} it), {{who does}} the hospitalities here at Bonn, in a grand way, with [...] "above {{a hundred and fifty}} chamberlains" [...] for one item,--glance at him, reader; perhaps we shall meet the man again. He is younger Brother of the elegant ambitious Karl Albert, Kurfurst of Bavaria, whom we have transiently heard of: sons both of them are of that [...] "Elector of Bavaria" [...] who haunts us in the Marlborough Histories,--who joined Louis XIV. in the Succession War, and got hunted about at such a rate, after Blenheim especially. His Boys, prisoners of the Kaiser, were bred up in a confiscated state, as sons of a mere private gentleman; nothing visibly ahead of them, at one time, but an obscure and extremely limited destiny of that kind;--though now again, on French favor, and the turn of Fortune's inconstant wheel, they are mounting very high. Bavaria came all back to the old Elector of Bavaria; even Marlborough's [...] "Principality of MINDELHEIM" [...] came. [At the Peace of Baden (corollary to UTRECHT), 1714. Elector had been [...] "banned" [...] (GEACHTET, solemnly drummed out), 1706; nothing but French pay to live upon, till he got back: died 26th February, 1726, when Karl Albert succeeded (Michaelis, ii. 255).] And the present Kurfurst, who will not do the Pragmatic Sanction at all,--Kurfurst Karl Albert of Baiern, our old Karl Philip of Mannheim's genealogical [...] "Cousin;"--we heard of abstruse colleaguings there, tendencies to break the Pragmatic Sanction altogether, and reduce it to waste sheepskin! Not impossible Karl Albert will go high enough. And this Clement August the cadet, he is Kurfurst of Koln; by good election-tactics, and favor of the French, he has managed to succeed an Uncle here: has succeeded at Osnabruck in like fashion;--poor old Ernst August of Osnabruck (to whom we once saw George I. galloping to die, and who himself soon after died), his successor is this same Clement August, the turn for a CATHOLIC Bishop being come at Osnabruck, and the French being kind. Kurfurst of Koln, Bishop of Osnabruck, ditto of Paderborn and Munster, ditto now of Hildesheim; richest Pluralist of the Church. Goes about here in a languid expensive manner; [...] "in green coat trimmed with narrow silver-lace, small bag-wig done with French garniture (SCHLEIFE) in front; and has red heels to his shoes." [...] A lanky indolent figure, age now thirty; [...] "tall and slouching of person, long lean face, <b>hook-nose,</b> black beard, mouth somewhat open." [...] [Busching (Beitrage, iv. 201-204: from a certain Travelling Tutor's MS. DIARY of 1731; where also is detail of the Kurfurst's mode of Dining,--elaborate but dreary, both mode and detail). His Schloss is now the Bonn University.] Has above one hundred and fifty chamberlains;--and, I doubt not, is inexpressibly wearisome to Friedrich Wilhelm in his Majesty's present mood. Patience for the moment, and politeness above all things!--The Trio of Vigilance had no difficulty with Friedrich; brought him on board safe again next day, and all proceeded on their voyage; the Kurfurst in person politely escorting as far as Koln.|$|E

The results show the importance of Caridean shrimps, especially Crangon crangon, as a food source for perciform fish species in inshore waters.

Dr & Mrs Jobson, & Mrs Brames Hall assembled in a room in Wesley’s house, London, & was intended to commemorate the Wesleyan Missionary Jubilee. The Maoris, in charge of the interpreter, visited England to gain an idea of its greatness & resource; the expedition was undertaken with the sanction of the New Zealand Government. The received the most hospitable reception from the Queen & from the highest persons in the Kingdom. The Queen was godmother of a Maori boy born during the visit- November 1863 - The picture indicates the meeting of the civilised Maori with the Missionary, to whose labours his advancement is due. It was intended that it should hang in the Mission Hall & Mr Swales, a publisher in Darlington, undertook to publish a jubilee print from it. But the scheme fell through. [Text obscured] … The picture, for which Mr Smetham received one hundred & fifty guineas was sent to New Zealand for sale, the price asked being 200 guineas.
