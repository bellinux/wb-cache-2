5000|$|The {{mechanic}} installs {{the solid}} lifter and rotates the <b>engine</b> <b>crank</b> until the cam {{is on the}} [...] "base circle" [...] (not on any intake or exhaust cam lobe). An adjustable-length push-rod checking tool is then installed on the valve location being checked. The pushrod length checking tool is extended until there is no slop (zero lash). Then, the checking tool is removed and measured. The mechanic then adds [...]030-.090" [...] of additional length, depending on the specifications of the lifter being installed. [...] A more typical pre-load range used and recommended by most mechanics is {{in the neighborhood of}} [...]030-.060" [...] The length of the adjustable length push-rod plus the desired pre-load chosen then becomes the desired push-rod length that should be installed, which will keep the hydraulic lifter in the middle of its total piston-travel range. Example: Adjustable push-rod at zero lash = 9.0". Desired pre-load = [...]050". 9.0" [...] + [...]050" [...] = 9.050" [...] push-rods should be installed.|$|E
50|$|The {{frame was}} made of box-cut steel and had a banana-shaped rear swingarm. It had a single mono shock on the rear with a single disc brake. The front {{suspension}} was a traditional telescopic fork (that could be preloaded) also with a single disc brake. The wheels were tri-spoke Enkei mag-type wheels. The engine was a single-cylinder water-cooled two-stroke engine. It had a six-speed close ratio gearbox with a kick-start. The engine featured AETC (Automatic Exhaust Timing Control), basically a valve in the exhaust port of the engine. At low RPM it restricted the exhaust gases so the engine produced more torque; at high RPM (approx 7800 RPM) it opened up to increase top RPM power. The exhaust also had an expansion chamber to give better top-end power. Maximum power was 36 hp (27 kW) at the <b>engine</b> <b>crank,</b> and top speed was 180 km/h; top speed was limited to 180 km/h (but able to be bypassed) due to the gearing allowing the motor to hit the rev limiter in top gear. Modified bikes {{have been known to}} exceed 200 km/h. At such point the gears hit their physical limitations.The bike featured a full fairing which was unusual for such a small bike.|$|E
5000|$|The {{cars were}} rated very {{conservatively}} at [...] and 450 lbft Nm of torque. Actual output was well over [...] Some people have claimed it to produce 600 or more horsepower, citing extensive testing {{to prove the}} results, though nothing has been actually proven. However, {{it is very easy}} to coax such power out of the semi-hemi engine due to it being factory de-tuned for street-ability purposes. These horsepower claims have been proven from many dynamometer test results over the years with factory stock engines; some rebuilt to factory specs, and others pulled directly from the cars themselves immediately after purchase, though specific output tends to vary per engine due to testing parameters. The 429 Drag Pack option from Ford at the time (which was a normal 429 SCJ and not the Boss version which made more power) had , which was quite impressive for the time, however {{it should be noted that}} these ratings were strictly <b>engine</b> <b>crank</b> horsepower, and not actual wheel horsepower figures. The manufacturers and dealers only listed [...] because of legal issues and rising insurance costs so customers would be lured into buying these cars without the stiff fees from an insurance company, though no manufacturer has ever stated this to be true, assumingly so to prevent possible lawsuits. Despite the high horsepower and torque ratings, the car was at home in the high RPM range (the engine is said to be able to rev up to 9,000rpm for extended periods of time, which is impressive given the engines massive 7.0L displacement, though were factory limited to 6,200rpm for insurance purposes [...] ), and suffered a (poor by today's standards) 0-60 time because of this. However, it quickly made up for that once it got moving. The car unrestricted is said to be able to exceed speeds of up to 175mph, [...] though no actual claim has been proven due to the rarity, value and collectibility of the car, making anyone who owns one reluctant to try it.|$|E

The clutch modifies the torque transmitted to the {{synchronous machine}} [6, 8] and the diesel engine speed [8]. When locking the clutch, a maximum speed difference of 10 − 5 is acceptable. Similar to the studies in [6, 7], the diesel <b>engine</b> <b>cranking</b> dynamics are avoided. To avoid the unnecessary diesel <b>engine</b> <b>cranking</b> dynamics, the <b>engine</b> rest state is simulated at a speed of 0.3 p.u. Thus, although the engine is considered stopped, the simulated value would remain at 0.3 p.u. Since the cranking delay will affect the readiness of the DG to provide frequency regulation, a 0.5  s delay is added as cranking time to the DG model [6, 7]. Thus, the diesel engine start will be delayed by 0.5  s when the speed increases from 0.3 p.u.|$|R

40|$|In modern {{heavy duty}} trucks the battery {{is a central}} component. Its {{traditional}} role as an energy source for <b>engine</b> <b>cranking</b> has been extended to include powering a number of elec- trical components on the truck, both during driving and during standstill. As a consequence of this {{it is important to}} know how much a battery in use has aged and lost in terms of ca- pacity and power output. The difficulty in measuring these factors on a battery in use causes problem, since heavy duty truck batteries are often replaced too early or too late, leading to unnecessary high replacement costs or truck standstill respectively. The overall goal of the effort, of which this thesis is a part, is to use a model of the cranking behaviour of a heavy duty truck engine, which depends on the battery condition, to estimate the ageing and wear of a heavy duty truck battery. This thesis proposes a modelling approach to model the components involved in <b>engine</b> <b>cranking.</b> In the thesis work, system identification is made of the systems forming part of the cranking of a heavy duty truck engine. These components are the starter battery, the starter motor and its electrical circuit and the internal combustion engine. Measurement data has been provided by Scania AB for the evaluation of the models. The data has been collected from crankings of a heavy duty diesel engine at different temperatures and battery charge levels. For every cranking lapse the battery voltage and current have been measured as well as the engine rotational speed. A starter battery model is developed and evaluated. The resulting battery model is then incorporated into two different <b>engine</b> <b>cranking</b> models, Model 1 and Model 2, including a starter motor model and an internal combustion engine model apart form the battery model. The two cranking models differ in several aspects and their differences and resulting evalu- ations are discussed. The battery model is concluded to be sufficiently accurate during model verification, however the two cranking models are not. Model 2 is verified as more correct in in its output than Model 1, but neither is sufficiently accurate for their purpose. The conclusion is drawn that the modelling approach is sound but development of Model 2 is needed before the model can be used in model-based condition estimation. ...|$|R
