40|$|Local {{chickens}} are one {{of national}} assets which need serious consideration, because they have some advantages than imported ones. These local chicken are still used as raw material for some traditional foods or ceremonies. But {{the quality of their}} carcasses was still low, so that it was needed to observe them in the practices (at the slaughtering houses and the market). The observations were conducted in some regions; Surakarta and Sukoharjo (Middle Java), Yogyakarta city, Sleman and Bantu! (Yogyakarta Special Province). This research was focussed on chemical, physical and microbiological determination on local chicken carcasses, which were sold in the market and evaluastion on slaughtering houses in the five research locations. The results depicted, the local chicken carcasess had higher protein and calorie content, lower fat content than imported ones. Based on sensory evaluation, these chicken carcasses showed good physical appearance. The results on texture and colour test depicted, {{there were no significant differences}} among the. But the microbiological test poniled out, that all samples were containinted by Escherichia coil, Staphylococcus sp and Salmonella sp. The field observation on the slaughtering houses showed, that all houses did not implement the principles of <b>equipment</b> <b>lay-out,</b> processing flow, good sanitation and waste handling and hygienic material handling...|$|E
40|$|Introduction In {{biochemical}} industries, most {{processes are}} carried out in a batch or fedbatch reactor. Think for example of the production of beer, penicillin or bakers yeast. These types of processes are characterized by their time-varying nature and their recipe-based processing. Furthermore, measuring all important state-variables is either impossible or very expensive. On-line control of these processes therefore is usually limited to the control of temperatures, pH, flows, and easily measurable states. Most of the processes are controlled by standard recipes, stating what to do {{at a certain time}} instant. Here, models are usually not constructed for control purposes but for process optimization which leads to optimized recipes or an optimal process <b>lay-out</b> (<b>equipment</b> sizes, etc.). The modeling of biochemical processes serves in practice only three main purposes: 1. Training of operators, 1 2. Fault diagnosis, 3. Process optimization. These three reasons for...|$|R
40|$|In the Peruvian Amazon basin rivers are {{the only}} link among the small communities, {{scattered}} on a wide territory. With that in mind {{and according to the}} needs of local communities, a health care network system based on mobile clinic units onboard small crafts has been conceived, within a cooperation programme between the Universidad Católica Santo Toribio de Mogrovejo (Perú) and the University of Trieste (Italy). This way, patients along the inland waterways can be reached. Ships to be operated in this service, must be especially designed to sail in different environmental conditions: in shallow water during dry season, against high currents during wet season and eventually in rivers showing both phenomena. Moreover, manoeuvrability and landing are subjects of major interest in ships designed for these regions. Within this frame, a study has been carried out to define main characteristics for a small clinic ship. General arrangement plans including medical <b>equipment</b> and clinic <b>lay-out</b> have been drawn. Then, according to clinic platform needs, the major engineering aspects of the ship have been studied to a concept design level: main dimensions have been defined and hull geometry has been optimized for waterway navigation; scantling of all the ship’s structures has been completed, based on the most recent rules issued by classification societies and according to EC guidelines for inland navigation; propellers and propulsion plant have been studied on the whole, considering shallow water effect...|$|R
